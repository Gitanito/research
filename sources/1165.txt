A FRENCH VIEW OF THE S.P.R.
Bv M. SAGE.
[The following is part of an article written by M. M. Sage
for a Turkish psychical review, which was founded about a
year ago under the editorship of M. M. Baha. The article
has been published separately at Constantinople, in its original
French form, under the title " Coup d'Q^il d'Ensemble sur
rilltat Actuel du Psychisme," and with M. Sage's permission
we reprint here his sketch of the rise of modern Spiritualism
and the work of the S.P.R.

Ed.]
Vers le milieu du 19'' siecle une religion nouvelle naquit aux
Etats-Unis dAmerique. C'etait une religion terre-a-terre et sans
po6sie comme la race qui la concevait et qui la repandait. Nean-
moins elle aurait faib son chemin comme tant d'autres dont les
origines furent tout aussi modestes et tout aussi brumeuses : a ses
debuts elle chemina meme a pas de geant. Mais la froide raison,
qui rfegne enfin quelque peu, lui coupa les ailes et le Spiritisme,
quoi qu'en disent ses fervents, vegete malingre, empoisonne par
I'Escroquerie et la Folie.
Que se passa-t-il au juste a Rochester? Nous n'en saurons jamais
rien. Peut-etre les so3urs Fox furent-elles I'occasion et le moyen de
ph6nomenes authentiques. Mais, fines mouches, que le sens moral
ne genait pas, elles virent tout de suite le profit qu'elles pouvaient
en tirer : elles en firent de I'argent, travaillant au lieu et place des
esprits, quand ceux-ci ne voulaient pas travailler pour elles.
4 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. Jan., mi.
Nous sommes dans un monde vraiment etraiige, ou iion seulement
les petites causes peuvent engendrer des effets immenses, mais encore
oil des causes peu morales ou franchement imniorales peuvent
engendrer de tres grands biens. Le Bien nait du Mai, comme le
Mai nait souvent du Bien : le Mai ne pent etre d6truit, ce serait
detruire I'Univers. Troublant mystere !
La banale aventure des sceurs Fox etait en elle-meme si peu de
chose que dix ans apres elle aurait du tout au plus eveiller I'atten-
tion de quelque historien de la folie. Eh bien ! Elle a cre6 une
agitation qui changera peut-etre la face de la Terre. Les Spirites,
dupeurs et dupes, ont taut crie sur les toits qu'il existe tout un
monde de phenomenes du plus haut interet pour Fhomme, qu'on a
fini par les entendre. Ces phenomenes sont tres nombreux et tres
divers, et peut-etre bien, en effet, qu'en eux est la clef de mysteres
comme : la Vie, I'Homme et sa destinee. Si vraiment la plupart
sont authentiques, leur etude est le premier b6gaiement d'une
psychologic digne de ce nom. II y a 20 ans on en riait; il y a
10 ans on disait : C'est etrange ! Aujourd'hui on est serieux chez
les vrais savants et, plus ou moins haut, on dit : Tout de meme
c'est peut-etre vrai. Et si c'est vrai, surement rHumanit6 a double
un cap sur la mer tempetueuse qu'elle parcourt.
Avec et apres les scaurs Fox, I'histoire du spiritisme, c'est Thistoire
du Mensonge. Cependant au milieu de cette interminable liste de
mediums indignes, il y a quelques figures troublantes, deux surtout
:
D. D. Home et W. Stainton Moses. On a pu soupconner le premier
de fraude, on n'en a jamais fait la preuve. Mais ce qui fera
toujours reflechir les esprits sans parti pris, ce seront surtout les
experiences severes que William Crookes fit avec lui : la modification
du poids des objets par simple contact du bout des doigts du
medium, et le jeu d'un accordeon dans une cage. Les precedes
d'experimentation employes ont ete a ce point irreprochables que
les critiques les plus aigues n'ont pu en entamer le compte-rendu.
Ne pouvant rien objecter, Frank Podmore a mieux aime avoir Fair
d'ignorer le dernier de ces deux phenomenes : cela ne lui fait pas
honneur.
La vie de Stainton Moses n'est pas moins troublante que celle de
D. D. Home. Stainton Moses manquait assurement de sens critique.
11 a pu se tromper lui-meme, il a pu tromper dans un etat second,
mais il n'a pas trompe consciemment. Peut-etre n'a-t-il pas trompe
du tout. Suspendons notre jugement.
Quoi qu'il en soit, du jour ou Crookes s'est occupe de ces
Jan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.li. 5
phenomenes il a fallii les discuter serieusement. C'6tait un grand
pas.
Ce pas fut depasse quelques annees apres par un autre bien plus
important: la f'ondation de la "Societe des Recherches psychiques."
II y avait a I'Universite de Cambridge quelques jeunes gens unis
entre autres par la torturante inquietude du grand Inconnu. lis
veoeraient particulierement un de leurs maitres, Sidgwick, ame
loyale, bienveillante et noble s'il en fut. Les jeunes gens s'associerent,
sous la presidence de ce maitre aime, pour rechercher par des
methodes rigoureuses ce qu'il pouvait y avoir de fonde dans les
phenomenes etranges dont tout le monde parlait alors. Les adh6rents
leur vinrent vite. Stainton Moses fut du nombre au d6but, mais
I'esprit de ce pasteur anglican avait ete coule dans un moule tout
autre que celui de la science. Les minutieuses et striates methodes
adoptees I'irriterent : il ne comprenait pas qu'il lallut prouver mille
fois encore ce qui a ses yeux I'etait surabondamment. II etait ne
pour precher, non pour critiquer et cribler : il se retira done. Ce
fut dommage, car quel merveilleux sujet on avait la ! Je ne croix
pas cependant — et je I'ai dit plus haut — que Stainton Moses
craignit personnellement d'etre pris en faute, comme tant d'autres
qui battent en retraite avec de grands airs indignes, quand on les
serre de trop pres. Mais Stainton Moses n'etait pas de son temps.
Disons un mot de ces premiers pionniers de la Societe, dont
I'oeuvre, comme toutes celles qui sont hautes, grandira par le recul,
au lieu de diminuer. Je crois qu'on parlera d'eux plus tard comme
on parle a present des Galilee, des Newton, des Descartes.
Gurney est mort jeune et ce fut une perte grave. C'est lui qui
a ete I'auteur principal de I'ouvrage maintenant classique : Fantdmes
des Vivants. II avait un esprit froid, clair, penetrant et sans parti
pris, largement ouvert. Tres sensible et tres delicat, les horreurs
de ce monde le rendaient amer et I'idee d'un Dieu de boute lui
seml>lait peu soutenable. Mais il voulait bien croire a un monde
meilleur, si I'existence de ce monde pouvait etre etablie par des
faits.
Gurney fut pessimiste par temperament, F. Myers fut tout le
contraire. Myers fut le poete, I'enthousiaste, celui qui a la foi.
Mais il fut aussi celui a qui la bonne vieille foi sentimentale ne
peut pas suffire. II avait un coeur, mais aussi un cerveau aussi
exigeant que le coeur. Son oeuvre est grandiose, mais un peu
informe ; dans son style il y a trop de recherche. Plus de sobriety,
plus de nerf le feraient lire avec plus de piaisir. Myers a rassemble
6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1911.
les faits par milliers ; il a fait ce qu'il a pu pour separer le grain
de I'ivraie. Malgre cela, tous ces faits impressionnent surtout par le
nombre. Enfin Myers, obeissant a un besoin de son esprit, s'est
trop hate de syst6matiser.
Frank Podmore n'est pas sympathique a tout le monde et
cependant son ojuvre, plus ingrate, est tout aussi grande et tout
aussi utile, au point oil en etaient et oil en sont encore les
recherches psychiques, que celle des deux premiers. Sa vie d'ecrivain
et de savant pent se resumer en ce mot : il critiqua. II prit les
travaux de ses collegues et les fit sonner, pour savoir s'ils avaient
une felure. II a peut-etre exagere quelquefois. Hypnotise par un
detail, il n'a pas toujours bien vu I'ensemble. Mais sans Frank
Podmore la Societe des Recherches psychiques aurait peut-etre d6vie,
au lieu de s'6lever toujours a plus de rigueur. Ses critiques aigues
et parfois mordantes ont toujours paru cote a cote avec les m6moires
qu'il dissequait sans pitie. Et jamais on ne lui en a voulu.
D6cid6ment nous ne sommes plus ici dans I'habituel milieu des
savants. Sous ses critiques on sent neanmoins que Podmore a un
esprit plus ouvert a la verite qu'on ne serait tente de la croire.
Passons a Richard Hodgson. Voici a mon avis le plus grand
chercheur psychique qui ait encore exists ! II n'a pas seulement
observe, il a experimente. Avec lui le psychisme est entre dans
le laboratoire. Hodgson a eu le bonheur de decouvrir, comme
principal sujet, une femme presque aussi admirable que lui : M™'^
Piper. Ces deux noma R. Hodgson-M""* Piper passeront entrelaces
a la posterite. Hodgson n'a couru ni apres I'argent ni apres la
gloire : il a vecu pauvre et meme besogneux en un pays oil rien
n'est estime que I'argent. II a cherch6 aprement le vrai dans la
peine et dans la gene : il a prie la v6ritable priere de demain, la
seule que Dieu aura pour agreable. Sa recompense"? II est parti
tout a coup de ce monde, sur de I'immortalit^, si svir que lui, le
sceptique d'antan, disait ; "J'ai peine a attendre la Mort. Quand
elle viendra je I'accueillerai avec des fleurs a la main." II a eu la
mort souhaitee de Tennyson
:
" Sunset and evening star, '
'
And one clear call for me !
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea."
Hodgson ne mourut pas, il franchit le passage d'un saut. Mais
la mort de F. Myers fut lente et penible, et merveilleusement belle.
II disait : J'ai les sensations de l'exil6 qu'on va rappeler dans la patrie.
Jan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.R. 1
A ces noms il faiidrait ajouter encore ceux de M'"' Sidgwick et
d'Oliver Lodge. Mais tous les deux soiit encore parmi nous.
Myers donnait a la Societe presque tout son temps et beaucoup
d'argent ; sa mort porta un coup terrible a celle-ci : elle chancela
un instant. Mais elle ne tarda pas a se ressaisir et aujourd'hui
elle continue normalement sa marche glorieuse. Les principaux
ouvriers du jour sont : M™° Sidgwick, Sir Oliver Lodge, M^"''
Alice Johnson, M"'' Verrall, M'' J. G. Piddington, M'' Feilding.
J'en oublie sans le vouloir.
II serait tres injuste de dire que la Societe des Eecherches
psychiques a fait tout le travail serieux qui a ete fait en matiere
de recherches psychiques depuis 30 ans. De puissants cerveaux s'y
sont appliques en dehors d'elle, un peu partout et d'une maniere
plus ou moins suivie. Mais c'est cette Societe qui, par sa tenacite,
son amour de la critique, son attitude toujours digne, son souci
d'avoir recours aux methodes les plus strictes, a petit a petit
conquis sinon les corps savants, du moins beaucoup de leurs
membres les plus eminents. II y a dix ans, par exemple, dans un
congres de psychologie, nul n'aurait ose presenter un cas de
psychisme pur : aujourd'hui on ecoute avidement dans ces congres
les voix les plus incompetentes en la matiere.
Qu'on me permette done de resumer a grands traits les travaux
de la Societe des Recherches psychiques, du moins ceux dont je
me souviens sans reflexions ni recherches prealables. N'oublions pas
que le sujet est immense.
Tout d'abord les investigateurs voulurent savoir ce qu'il y avait
de vrai dans les stupefiantes merveilles operees par les nombreux
mediums payes, devant des naifs sortis de tous les milieux. Ce fut
una campagne decourageante : ils ne trouverent rien qu'impudentes
mystifications d'une part et inguerissable niaiserie d'autre part. II
fallut laisser de c6t6 les mediums et se rabattre sur les faits
spontanes.
Alors commen^a une enquete vaste et serree sur ces cas d'appari-
tions, d'impressions estranges et intenses, cas nombreux signales en
tout temps et en tout pays, se produisant chez certaines personnes
pendant que d'autres tres eloignees traversent, a I'insu des premieres,
une crise aigue, surtout la crise derniere, celle d'avant la mort. Ces
cas ne se produisent pas quand il plait a I'observateur. Seuls peu-
vent les observer ceux a qui ils surviennent. On ne pent done
qu'en recueillir des recits. Mais le recit vaut ce que vaut I'obser-
vateur. Ce qu'il convient de peser ici, c'est done la valeur mentale
8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., I9il.
du percipient. Guiney et ses collaboiateurs s'y attacherent avec
passion : ils rejeterent tout ce qui a premiere vue paraissait insufE-
sant : puis ils s'astreignirent a visiter individuellement les gens dont
ils avaient retenu les narrations, leur posant les questions les plus
minutieuses et cherchant a se rendre compte de leur valeur morale.
Ainsi s'6difia le livre Fantomes des Vivants, k partir duquel on a
considere la telepathie sinon comme scientifiquement etablie, du
moins comme tout a fait probable. On connait le succes de cet
ouvrage.
On essaya ensuite de faire la meme enquete a propos des fantfimes
des Marts. Car les vivants n'apparaissent pas seuls aux vivants
:
les morts apparaissent aussi. Les recits plausibles, dus a des
personnes dignes de foi, furent beaucoup moins nombreux. Et, fait
reniarquable, les cas, assez frequents pendant les premieres semaines
qui suivent la mort, deviennent de plus en plus rares au fur et a
mesure que la date de la mort recule davantage ;
quand la mort
date d'un an, il ne s'en pr6sente presque plus. Done la rarete
relative des faits fit que la societe ne put donner un pendant au
livre Fantomes des Vivants par le livre Fantomes des Morts. Les
narrations retenues apres passage au ciible furent simplement soumises
aux lecteurs des Proceedings de la Societe par la plume de M™" Sidg-
wick. Cette enquete est a reprendre.
Le magnetisme et I'liypnotisme firent I'objet de travaux nombreux.
Mais ici les psychistes n'ont plus le monopole.
Le magnetisme conduisait tout naturellement aux experiences de
transmission de pensee. Dans les laboratoires d'abord, puis entre
des localites distantes, avec des sujets tres divers, les experiences
proprement dites out ete multipliees. II est prouve maintenant que
la pensee peut se transmettre d'un esprit a un autre sans I'inter-
vention des organes du corps ; la distance et la matiere interposees
ne semblent pas constituer des obstacles. Certes nous ne conniiissons
presque pas les modalites du phenomene. Pour connaitre ces
modalites il faudrait coiniaitre la nature de Fame : nous sommes
loin de la. Mais le phenomene existe. Cependant on a pu se
rendre j
compte tout de suite que ce qui se ti'ansmet est ind6pendant
des mots, signes ordinaires de la pensee. Transmettre un mot est
presque impossible, a moins d'eveiller le souvenir de ce mot par
une image. C'est l'id6e, dans le sens etymologique de ce terme,
qui se transmet. Constatation tres instructive ! Souvent I'agent
n'arrive pas a transmettre au percipient I'idee exacte qu'il a en
vue ; mais ce dernier en per9oit nettement une foule d'autres, par-
Jan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.R. 9
faitement exactes, qu'oii n'a pas eu I'intention de lui envoyer. Tr^s
communes sont les hallucinations du percipient, sous I'influence
d'une idee transmise : il semble bien que les fantdmes dont il a
et6 question plus haut soient des hallucinations analogues. De
meme I'etude des seances de M'"" Piper, de M'"" Verrall etc. laisse
I'impression qu'il s'agit ainsi d'une transmission de pensee. Apres
tout on concoit tres bien (t priori que s'il existe des esprits humains
desincarnes, et que si ces esprits peuvent quoiqu'imparfaitement
communiquer avec nous, ce soit par une transmission de pensee.
Mais cette pensee, pour parvenir a notre conscience normale doit
franchir I'epaisse barriere de la chair : la est I'obstacle. L'attention
des psychologues ne saurait trop se porter vers la transmission de
pensee.
Les maisons hantees ont de bonne heure preoccupe la Societe.
La hantise semble bien etre un fait de la nature. Mais les
aspects en sont multiples, les causes peut-etre tres diverses. II
faudra de nombreux travaux et sans doute un temps tres long
avant que nous puissions en discourir en connaissance de cause.
Le professeur Barrett — que j'aurais du ranger plus haut parmi
les premiers et les plus actifs pionniers de la Societe — a tout
specialement etudie le cas des sourciers. II y a d'etranges individus
qui, en passant au-dessus d'une nappe d'eau souterraine, que rien ne
decele aux sens, eprouvent des impressions revelatrices, impressions
qui feront, par exemple, tourner entre leurs mains une baguette de
coudrier. Voici un phenomene alfirrae depuis les origines de
I'humanite et bien propre a mettre au nombre des superstitions
ancestrales. On aurait tort de le faire. Barrett a demontre par
I'experimentation que le phenomene est reel, quelque incomprehensible
qu'il soit. Certains sourciers se pretendent capables de decouvrir aussi
les metaux precieux caches sous terre : mais ceci est plus douteux.
Quelques rares memoires ont paru aussi sur les delires, les hallu-
cinations des mourants, certains phenomenes inexpliques et con-
comitants de la mort. Ces memoires montrent qu'il y a encore la
un vaste champ a explorer, champ plein de promesses. Mais c'est
pour le moment terre inconnue.
Enfin I'ceuvre capitale de la Societe est I'etude de la mediumnite
de M""" Piper. Cette 6tude dure depuis plus de 20 ans deja et se
poursuit toujours. Hodgson y a consacre presque exclusivement les
quinze dernieres annees de sa vie : durant tout ce temps il n'a pour
ainsi dire pas perdu son medium de vue. Les premiers memoires
sensationnels sur le sujet sont de lui. Mais d'autres nombreux ont
10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., I9il.
paru en outre : la bibliotheque de tout ce qui a ete publie sur M""*
Piper est deja fournie. Et on en publiera longtemps encore : le
plus interessant est peut-etre encore a venir. Meme s'il fallait
attendre un siecle I'apparition d'un autre sujet pareil, nous n'aurions
pas trop de temps pour mediter sur les documents accumules.
Qu'on m'excuse si je n'essaie pas de donner un apercu de cette
mediumnit6 extraordinaire ! mais cela ne se pent pas dans ce
sommaire raj^ide.
II fut un temps oil Ton disait: "s'il existe des etres humains
ayant depouille le lourd vetement de la chair et se communiquant a
nous, que ne prouvent-ils leur identite en rappelant des incidents de
leur vie sur terre 1 Que diable, ceci est elementaire et doit etre
facile !
" Eh bien ! on peut dire sans exagerer que plusieurs centaines
de communicants ont prouve leur identite par I'intermediaire de
M"" Piper, d'une maniere qui paraitrait plus que suffisante, s'il
s'agissait d'liommes vivants. Mais une fois qu'on I'a tenu, ce criterium
la'a plus paru suffire. Certes, pour attribuer a la telepathie tons les
resultats obtenus, il faut 61argir le cadre de cette hypothese a tel
point qu'il u'en reste plus rien. Mais enfin notre esprit, entraine
trop loin de ses voies ordinaires, aime mieux admettre une in-
vraisemblable telepathie que d'une hypothese plus transcendantale.
Et puis ces seances ne sont pas une eau pure : c'est une eau trouble
charriant des quantites de choses, que nous ne demelons pas. L'esprit
du medium, quoique amen6 a une grande passivit6, n'est pas aneanti.
On le sent agir, broder malgre lui, deformer. Ceci n'est pas
etonnant, c'est le contraire qui le serait. Si on pouvait communiquer
clairement et sans obstacle de ce monde au suivant, ce serait que ce
raonde et le suivant n'en font qu'un. Or, certes, ils en font deux;
ils se touchent, mais ne se confondent pas.
Or done, une complication heureuse s'est produite depuis la mort
de F. Myers. On objectait sans cesse : "Sans doute il y a dans
vos compte-rendus une foule de details ayant appartenu en propre
au communicant pretendu et que le medium n'a pu acquerir norma-
lement. Nous accordons meme que le consultant les ignorait
jusqu'en sa subconscience. Mais ces details pouvaient se trouver
dans la conscience normale, voire dans la subconscience de quelque
personne vivant quelque part sur la planete. C'est peut-etre la tout
simplement que le medium les a t6lepathiquement puises." Combien
de fois en son vivant Myers s'etait trouve en face de ce raisonnement,
dont on sent toute la faussete sans pouvoir le ret'uterl Eh bien, il
semblerait que Myers, maintenant qu'il est au dela du voile, a
Jan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.R. n
trouve un nioyen de rendre caduc ce raisonnement specieux, et ce
moyen est celui des "messages fragmentes." ^ C'est en effet a Myers
que les esprits de M""^ Piper font I'honneur de la decouverte,
Quand a nous pour qui la personnalite posthume de Myers est tout
juste une hypothese, croyons-en ce qui nous plaira. Toujours est-il
que les messages fragnientes existent, nombreux deja, et qu'ils sont
un fait nouveau. Voici schematiquement en quoi ils consistent.
Le communicant — disons Myers, si nous voulons — au lieu d'envoyer
son message par un seul medium, I'enverra par trois, quatre, quel-
quefois cinq mediums, n'en donnant a chacun qu'un fragment incom-
prehensible pour lui. Mais ensuite un chercbeur —supposons M'""
Johnson ou J. G. Piddington — rapprochera ces fragments, ces
details en apparence incoherents et verra que, reunis, ils forment
un sens parfaitement clair. Ainsi exposee, la chose est aussi simi)le
que geniale; mais, dans la pratique, etant donnees les difificultes de
toute sorte, entre autres la grande difficnlte d'envoyer les mots
meme d'une phrase, celui qui etudie les textes doit avoir beaucoup
de patience et de perspicacite. Quoi qu'il en soit un nombre deja
grand de ces messages a et6 publie et appartient a la critique. Ils
ont ete obtenus surtout par I'intermediaire de M™" Piper, de M'"
Verrall et de M""= Holland. Cette derniere habite I'lnde, M'"=
Verrall habite Cambridge, M™" Piper est a Londres ou a Boston :
ces dames ne communiquent pas entre elles, de cela on est sfir.
Mais ces messages, formant un tout evident, n'ont pu etre coucus
que par un seul et meme esprit. Lequel? Voici le point capital.
Supposer que ce serait celui de I'un des mediums qui I'aurait
concu et communique subconsciemment aux autres confine a I'absurde.
Alors ? Alors la seule hypothese raisonnable est que ces messages
sont bien ce qu'ils affirment etre et que leur origine est dans I'esprit
de Myers ou de Hodgson. Done Myers et Hodgson existeraient et
penseraient encore tout en n'etant plus parmi nous.
En conclusion, j'ignore quelle sera la conviction des generations a
venir, quand elles auront cultive ces champs immenses du psychisme,
ou nous ouvrons a peine aujourd'hui quelques sentiers au milieu de
la brousse. Mais pour I'instant une seule hypothese rend compte
de tous les faits entrevus ou prouves : c'est que I'ame est une entite
diff^rente du corps, actionnant celui-ci pour un temps, mais pouvant
tres bien exister sans lui. Que la personnalite humaine survit a la
mort du corps est la premiere et la plus essentielle v^rite illuminant

respondence " qui, du reste, n'est pas lui-meme tres explicite.

nos yeux. Mais il y a dans ces phenomenes la clef de bien d'autres
mysteres et un jour viendra oil tout le savoir humain evoluera
autour d'eux.
On s'etonnera sans doute que je n'aie rien dit des phenomenes
physiques du psychisme ; coups frappes, passage de la matiere a
travers la matiere, materialisations, dematerialisations, et tant d'autres.
Bien que ces phenomenes soient les premiers qui aient attire I'atten-
tion, ils sont encore les plus incertains de tous. Je sais, nombre
d'hommes de valeur s'affirment convaincus de leur realite, mais
jusqu'ici la Societe des Recherches psychiques n'a trouve que fraude
sur ce chemin. Le medium a effets physiques le plus celebre est la
Napolitaine Eusapia Palladino. Feilding, Baggally et Carrington
etaient recemment revenus de Naples convaincus de la realite d'au
moins la plupart de ces phenomenes. Puis cette femme s'est rendue
en Amerique ou elle s'est fait prendre en train de frauder avec une
habilete consommee : tout est remis en question. Au reste ces
phenomenes ont en eux une part de grossierete qui ne les rend pas
seduisants.
En tinissant j'exprime encore une fois ma conviction que le
psychisme sera la grande preoccupation de demain. Mais nos savants
actuels ne sont pas propres a ces recherches : a des recherches plus
hautes il faut des hommes plus hauts. II faudra chercher comme
Ton prie, par un divin devoir, non pour gagner de la gloire ou de
I'argent. Le vrai psychiste devra etre un savant et un saint. Or
cette race n'est pas commune encore. Aujourd'hui le saint est tout
autre chose qu'un savant et le savant n'est pas un saint.
NOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.
In May, 1910, The Journal of Abnormal Psychology became the official
organ of the newly-formed American Psycho-pathological Association.
This change in the status of the Journal will, it is anticipated, lead
to the publication of articles of a more distinctly medical kind than
those which have hitherto appeared. At the present time consider-
able activity is being shown by American investigators in regard to
Freud's work in psycho-pathology and psycho-therapeutics, and it is
promised that contributions dealing with the psycho-neuroses from
the point of view of the Freud school will appear from time to time.
No part of Freud's Avork is more fundamental than his theory of
dreams ; but that his views are not going to be accepted without
challenge is shown by the appearance of a long article by Dr. Morton
Prince on " The Mechanism aud Interpretation of Dreams," in which
Jan., 1911. Notes on Current Periodicals. 13
he contests several of Freud's conclusions (Journal of Abnormal
Psychology, Oct. -Nov., 1910). In the same number Dr. Ernest Jones
gives an abstract of a paper contributed by him to the American
Journal of Psychology, April, 1910, on "Freud's Theory of Dreams."
A brief examination of these two articles will bring out the main
points on which Dr. Prince differs from Freud and his followers.
According to Freud every adult dream represents the fulfilment
of a repressed wish. The wish has been repressed because it is
inacceptable to consciousness, and the repressing force is regarded
as a "censor" that prevents its subsequent re-emergence into con-
sciousness. But during sleep the activity of the censor is so far
relaxed that the repressed wish is allowed to manifest itself in con-
sciousness provided that the thoughts are so distorted as to be
unrecognisable. The true meaning of the dream (the latent content)
has to be extracted from the dream as remembered by the dreamer
(the manifest content), and this can be done only by an elaborate
process of psycho-analysis. Distortion of the latent content is brought
about by four different mechanisms: (1) Condensation. Every element
in the manifest content represents several in the latent thoughts, and
vice versa. (2) Displacement. The psychical intensity of a given
element in the manifest content shows no correspondence with that
of the associated elements in the latent content. (.3) Dramatization.
The manifest content depicts a situation or action, a fact that
exercises a selecting influence on the mental processes to be pre-
sented. (4) Secondary elaboration. This is the alteration undergone
by the dream processes during the apprehension of them in conscious-
ness. It particularly affects parts of the dream that have been
insufficiently distorted during the dream making. Its action continues
after waking, so that the memory of a dream becomes more altered
the greater is the period that has elapsed since it was experienced.
The forgetting of dreams is, like the distortion of the latent content,
a manifestation of the activity of the censor. In every dream appears
some incident of the preceding da}'. This incident may be insignificant
in itself, but it has obtained psychical significance by becoming, on
the day of its occurrence, associated with significant experiences or
memories. A recent or conscious wish is inadequate to cause a
dream unless it is associated with a repressed unconscious one. It is
probable that the groundwork of every dream is of infantile origin.
The function of a dream is to protect sleep by stilling the activity
of unconscious mental processes that otherwise would disturb it.
Dr. Prince's observations confirm those of Freud up to a certain
14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1911.
point only. He finds that running through every dream there is an
intelligent motive, but he does not think that every dream can be
interpreted as the imaginary fulfilment of a wish. On the contrary,
he finds that some dreams are rather the expression of the non-
fulfilment of a wish, or of the fulfilment of a fear or anxiety. And
when the dieam is the fulfilment of a wish, it is not of a repressed
wish, but rather of an avowed and justified wish. He is unable to
find any evidence of repression or of a "censor," and he cannot
accept the view that the amnesia following the dream differs in
principle from that observed for dissociated states in general. He
admits the distinction between the latent and the manifest content,
but he thinks that the latent content is merely a logically connected
series of memories, of which the manifest content is a symbolical
representation. The distortion of the true dream thoughts in the
manifest content is only such as is required by the conditions of
symbolism. Dr. Prince finds no evidence of the distortion being the
work of a "censor," and he regards dreams as being only a j^articular
type of the phenomena of hallucinatory symbolism. As regards the
characteristics of the symbolism he has found evidence of "condensa-
tion," "dramatization," and "secondary elaboration," but he has not
observed the "displacement" of the emotion pertaining to the true
dream thought to an inconsequential element in the manifest dream
content.
Freud insists that in every dream some incident of the preceding
day appears. Dr. Prince, working with a subject who could be put
into several hypnotic states, discovered that ideas which passed
through the mind just before going to sleep invariably appeared in
the dreams. This conclusion does not invalidate that of Freud, and
if it is corroborated by other observers it may prove an important
advance in our knowledge of the sources of the content of dreams.

REVIEW.
An Introduction to the Study of Hypnotism : Experimental and llierapeutic.
By H. E. WiNGFiELD, M.D. (Bailliere, Tindall & Cox, London,
1910. 5s. net.)
" This little book," says Dr. Wingfield in his Preface, " is an attempt
to supply a simple answer to the question, 'What is Hypnotism?'
. . . It makes no effort to range itself with the many larger works
on the subject, but intends rather to serve as an introduction to
these. . . . Those who are already familiar with the subject will,
I fear, find nothing new in these pages. It is intended solely for
Jan., liill.

those who as yet kno,w iiathing-pf hypnctisifi, wd to such inquirers
it may prove of some service." In spite of the author's modest
disclaimer, the book may, we think, prove of more service to a
serious inquirer than some of greater pretensions. In any science,
and especially one which is still in so rudimentary a state as hypno-
tism, it is important that books intended for those who know little
or nothing of it should be written by men who are entitled to
speak with authority as to what is known, what is only conjectured,
and how the student may best approach the subject. We need
liardly say that the book before us fulfils this condition.
Hypnotism still suffers from its long-time association with quacks
and charlatanry of all kinds, —an association which was in great
measure forced on it through its treatment by the mass of scientific
men of former generations. During the last thirty years much has
been done to raise its status, and we may claim that the work of
our Society, of which Dr. Wingfield himself has long been a dis-
tinguished member, has played a part in producing this result. "It
is to Myers," he writes, "that we owe the recognition of the supreme
importance of the subconsciousness, and of the part it takes in producing
the phenomena of hypnotism": and one notices here, as elsewhere,
that certain cases first published by the S.P.R. are now qtioted as
classic instances known to all the world, and affording a welcome
relief to the once ubiquitous, if mythical, Hebrew-speaking servant-
maid, without whom no gentleman's psychology could formerly be
considered complete.
Meanwhile the Psycho-Medical Society ^ has done, and is doing,
much to spread enlightenment. But the advance, even within the
medical profession, is still confined to a comparatively narrow circle,
as was shown by the recent discussions of faith-healing in the
medical press; and since experts in hypnotism are not—speaking
generally —recognised by the profession as are experts in other
branches, it is still difficult for the ordinary medical practitioner to
find out where to apply for reliable information on the subject. Dr.
Wingfield's book will, we think, help to remove this difficulty by its
clear, scientific and moderate statement of what has been attained,
while its hopeful though sober view of possible developments should
rouse interest in all who care for the progress of the healing art.
He gives a brief description of the main methods of hypnosis
used by some of the most famous operators of the present day,
explaining to what types of patients and what kinds of disorders
they are likely to be best suited ; and describes some of the typical
phenomena of hypnotism, illustrating them from his own experiments.
The medical aspect is only briefly considered, but this chapter has
an interesting reference to the work of Freud, which is now attracting
so much attention. It indicates further the types of cases that are,
and those that are not, likely to benefit from hypnotic treatment.
The thorny subject of the dangers of hypnotism is dealt with in an
^Formerly called "The Medical Society for the Study of Suggestive Thera-
peutics," the foundation of -which was announced in the Journal for January,
J 907.
16 J-owrnul of ^Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 19H.
eminently saue,'iashio:i. . ^\'•hil,^3 sbo^^ing - that- they may be greatly
exaggerated, Dr. Wingfield admits that in this, as in all other methods,
there are possible risks ; but he shows that they are not of a more
mysterious oi' alarming nature than the risks of other methods ; for
they are as well known to experts as other risks, and are quite as
easy to avoid by care and common sense.
His general conclusion is one that holds not in hypnotism only,
but in all varieties of the healing art. Other influences in addition
to the special form of treatment are often required. Many patients
"owe their troubles to their unhealthy manner of life. Work they
regard as an evil to be avoided as much as possible, and when they
are sufficiently wealthy to be independent of it, . . . they have no
regular occupation of anj- kind except pleasure-seeking. . . . Their
one hope of lasting cure lies in work and contact with the realities
of life. If they can engender in themselves some human interest,
they may forget their own sorrows in those of others. . . . We must,
if possible, induce [the patient] to take up some absorbing form of
labour, for in work, and in work alone, will [he] find permanent
salvation. . . . 'Travaillons sans raisonner, c'est le seul moyen de
rendre la vie supportable.'
"
Yet one is left with the impression that the author of this book finds
some pleasure in the exercise of his reason as well as in his work.
CORRECTIONS.
In the account of experiments in thought-transference by Miss
Eamsden and Miss Statkowski, printed in the last Joivnial, it was
stated (p. 392) that "on several occasions Miss Ramsden used a
picture post-card and tried to convey the scene on it to Miss
Statkowski." Miss Eamsden tells us that this is an error ; that
on the two occasions (in Experiments I. and III., see p. 393)
where picture post-cards are referred to, she was looking at the
actual view itself when trying to convey the impression of it to
Miss Statkowski, and that she only used the post-cards as records
of what she had been seeing.
On p. 393, Miss Ramsden's description of the scene she looked
at in Experiment III. I'uns : "There was a statue of Japanese
stone on an island in the pond." " Stone " is here a misprint
for "storks" which is the word written on the original post-card.
The experiment was thus more successful than would appear
from the way it was stated in the Journal, for Miss Statkowski's
first clear impression was " a big bird with outspread wings
sitting on a stone," and the two big birds standing on a small
island built of stones were one of the main features in the
scene that Miss Ramsden was looking at.

CASE.
L. 1183. Veridical Dream.
Thk following account was sent to ns by Major Nelson :
The Manor House, Stoke D'Abernon,
Surrey, Avgust 29th, 1910.
Playing golf last week I happened to mention to my opponent, a
member of the Psychical Research Society, a strange incident that
occurred to me last Xmas Eve, or rather in the early hours of
Xmas Day.
I ought to tell you that I never dream. I believe as a child
I had nightmares like other children, but since then a dream has
been to me an unknown quantity.
With this knowledge you will understand why Avhat occurred last
Xmas made so deep an impression. The whole of that day and the
next my mind was obsessed by the incident, but I kept it entirely
to myself.
On the morning of the 27th I dreamed again, and at dinner the
same night the conversation turned upon dreams. Then for the
first time I communicated my strange experiences to two ladies
sitting on either side of me, Mrs. Rowan Hamilton, of Killyleagh
Castle, Co. Down, and her niece by marriage, Mrs. Sidney Rowan
Hamilton.
On the 28th I wrote to Mr. Sandwith, the Rector of St. Bar-
tholomew's, Smithfield, whom I had not seen for some considerable
time, and asked him if he had been worried about some child. He
18 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt. Feb., 1911.
replied by coming down to Stoke, and was amazed when I told him
what had occurred, and proceeded to tell me what had been going
on in his parish.
There is no possible explanation of how I could liave been cog-
nizant of the fact that Mr. Sandwith had been worried, for I had
never heard of the child or of the German.
His letter was written after his visit in reply to my question,
and at my request he wrote setting forth the particulars. I enclose
the orio-inal documents. a •
° A. Nelson, Major.
P.S. —I am, or rather was, by no means well acquainted with the
passage from Scrijiture; yet it is verbatim correct.
Major Nelson sent us witli this letter the original records
he had made of his two dreams at the time, vi'hich were as
follows :
The Manor House, Stoke D'Abernon,
Surrey, Xmas Day, '09.
Last night I dreamed a dream so strange and vivid that I wisli
to record the occurrence while I can remember the details.
I dreamed that I was in the drawing-room of 12a, Chartei'honse
Square, alone. Suddenly the door opened and Sandwith came in
and said: "Look here. Nelson, you can help me—I wish you would
come—I am terribly distressed about this j^oor child, a soldier's
child too." I got up and followed him to the dining-room. He
knelt down at the table and motioned me to kneel beside him.
Then he said, " Now, I want you to repeat every word I say after
me." I cannot remember the exact words, but the gist was that
God would intervene to save some child—whether from danger or
death I know not—for I cannot recall the words.
Suddenly Sandwith stopped speaking English, and began to pray
in German. I was unable then to repeat his words, for I know no
German, and as I was telling him so, I awoke. T.-r

I have had another dream of startling significance, and record it
at once.
I dreamed that I asked myself what could possibly be the mean-
ing of so extraordinary a request on Sandwith's part. Lnmediately
there came into my mind or fell upon my ear—I know not which
—these words :
" If two of you shall agree upon earth as touching
anything they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father
which is in Heaven."
Feb., 1911. Case. 19
Mr. Sandwith, after visitinp; Major Nelson and hearing of
his dream, sent him the following statement of the circum-
stances, which he forwarded to us
:
12a Charterhouse Square, E.G.,
Dec. 30, '09.
Here are the particulars. I have for a fortnight or so before
Christmas been considerably worried over the marriage of a German,
not a naturalized Englishman, to a girl in this Parish.
I spoke to the girl's father about it, and wrote to the Bishop
of London asking whether the production of a licence would
guarantee the validity of the marriage, if the contracting parties
eventually resided in Germany.
The Bishop said he thought so, but that I had better go to
Doctors' Commons and state the facts, in case they had overlooked
the point of the man not being a naturalized Eng'lishman.
I asked the father of the girl to accompany me, but he said
he felt satisfied. This added considerably to my worry, as I felt
he was the proper person to safeguard his daughter's future, and
any interference on my part was a delicate matter. As the Bishop's
letter was addressed to me personally through his Chaplain, "you
had better go to Doctors' Commons," I regarded it as a personal
direction from my Bishop and went, and asked for a written
statement from the Chancellor of the Diocese that all was in order.
This I duly received, and the marriage was solemnized on
Christmas Day at 10.20 a.m.
^\. F. G. Sandwith.
We have also received from Mrs. Eowan Hamilton, of Killy-
leagh Castle, County Down, the following statement
:
Nov. 9, 1910.
With reference to your letter dated 29th Oct., 1910, to Major A.
Nelson regarding the dream described by him, I wish to corroborate
his statement to you dated 29th August, 1910.
LiNA PtOWAN Hamilton.
A similar statement has been received from Mrs. Sidney Eowan
Hamilton, to whom Major Nelson also spoke of his dream.
In reply to questions tending to elicit what normal causes
might have produced the dream, Major Nelson states that he
had never helped Mr. Sandwith in any way in his parochial
20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., mi.
work. He also says that Mr. Sandwith assured him that he
had not thought of him in connection with his difficulty.
He adds
:
Nov. 4, '10.
The only connection that I can conceive between the fact of Mr.
Sandwith's being worried and my dream is the existence of some
lines on the subject of prayer written in a iriend's Prayer Book,
which I sent to Mr. Sandwith, before writing them in the book, to
ask whether the theology was sound, in September, 1909.
This statement of Major Nelson's is of psychological interest
as possibly throwing light on the mechanism of the dream.
It seems as if the telepathic impulse had been the primary
cause of the dream ; that the thought of the German and
Mr. Sandwith thus telepathically aroused had called up, through
a normal process of association of ideas with the latter, the
additional notion of prayer, and that the three conceptions
were combined into the dream idea of Mr. Sandwith reciting a
prayer in Gierman.
KEPOPtT ON A FURTHER SERIES OF SITTINGS
WITH EUSAPIA PALLADINO AT NAPLES.
I.
General Repokt.
By the Hon. Evekaed Feilding and W. Markiott.
Naples, Dcccmher 5fh, 1910.
Wrrii a view to attempting to confirm either the favourable
report on Eusapia Palladino issued by Messrs. Feilding,
Baggally and Carrington, published in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.
(Part LIX., November, 1909), or the unfavourable one by
Mr. W. S. Davis in the American S.P.R. Journed for August,
1910, a short series of five sittings was held in Naples in
November and December, 1910. The sitters were as follows:
Seances I. and II. —Count and Countess Perovsky-Petrovo-
Solovovo and Mr. Feilding.
Seance III.—Count Solovovo, Mr. W. Marriott, Mr. Feilding.
„ IV.—As in No. III. and Countess Solovovo.
V.—Mr. Marriott and Mr. Feilding.
At Stance I. the control was at the time considered so
unsatisfactory that, although fraud was not specifically proved,
i"EB., 1911. Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. 21
neither Count Solovovo nor Mr. Feilding is disposed to attach
any evidential importance to the few small phenomena which
occurred.
Seance II. was the only one at which, with the possible
exception of table levitations, any phenomena of the slightest
interest occurred. They were, however, of so insignificant a
character that, especially in the light of the possible fraud at
the first Seance, and the undoubted fraud in the last three,
none of the three sitters is disposed to draw any positive
conclusions. Seances III., IV., and V. were in the opinion of
all those present unquestionably mainly, and in the opinion
of Mr. Marriott wholly, fraudulent. The medium evaded
throughout any effective control, frequently making it impossible
for the sitter on her left side to prevent her from releasing
her left hand or foot, and took advantage of this to make
constant use of thetn, as well as of her elbow, for the
production of spurious phenomena. Such phenomena con-
sisted of (1) .shaking movements of the curtain, throwings of
it over her shoulder, surreptitious pulliugs at it with her hands
or elbow, kickings at it with her feet. (2) Touches with her
left foot on her neighbours. (3) Upsetting of the cabinet table
with her elbow. (4) Moving of a chair with her foot. (5)
Lifting of the cabinet table with her hand after effecting its
release,—not by substitution, but merely by removing it from the
back of the controller's hand, this position being the only form
of control she would usually permit. As regards this last effect^
it may be added that though Messrs. Feilding and Marriott
distinctly saw the movement of the medium's hand and arm
against a background of luminous paint, Countess Solovovo,
who was controlling the hand in question on the table and
under the curtain, had the distinct impression of its continuous
grasp. Count Solovovo is inclined to consider the hypothesis
of some abnormal suggestive influence on the part of the medium
to account for this impression.
With this tentative exception, all the sitters are agreed
that the whole of the above-named phenomena were entirely
fraudulent. As regards the table movements, consisting, in the
last three seances, of only one total and two partial levitations,
Mr. Marriott is strongly of opinion that these also were
fraudulent, inferring from the position of the hands that they
22 Journcd of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., I9ii.
were accomplished by a balance of the table between the left
hand and foot, and by an upward throw of her (E. P.'s) fingers
respectively. Mr. Feilding, who was actually observing the
hands at the time, disputes the conclusion that these actions
did, in fact, take place, but is not disposed to lay any stress
upon a few phenomena sporadically occurring among others of
an unquestionably fraudulent character. He is further of
opinion that the table movements were the only phenomena
which in any way resembled the occurrences at the former
Naples series of experiments, and states that the conditions of
control permitted were wholly different from those permitted
in that series.
The seances in question appear identical with the seances
described by Mr. Davis. The medium pleaded illness and
fatigue throughout, and although it had been intended to hold
a series of ten or twelve seances, it was not thought worth
while to continue any longer in the circumstances.
At the termination of the series Eusapia was informed of
the negative conclusions which had been arrived at and of the
spurious nature of the phenomena which had been presented.
While not disputing the justice of these conclusions, she stated
that she had no recollection of anything that transpired after
the close of the table movements which usually occupy the
first part of her sittings, after which the light is reduced for
other phenomena. She pleaded her state of health as an
excuse for her failure to give satisfaction. She nevertheless
accepted her full fee.
IT.
Statement by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.
December, 1910.
Whilst substantially agreeing with the above report, I feel
bound to make the following reservations and observations
:
With regard to Seance II. some of the things which happened
impressed me favourably. I was twice touched on my right
side ; a little table in the " cabinet " was suddenly and violently
overturned ; and one of the objects which then fell off it
moved along the floor for a very appreciable period of time.
The hand and foot control seemed to me very satisfactory ;
at
least we repeatedly said so at the time, and 1 wrote so in my
Feb., 1911. Farther Sittings tvith Eusapia Palladino. 23
notes the day after. I think in such incidents it is the im-
pression felt at the time of the occurrence (I am spealving of
experienced enquirers only) which must really count—not the
one produced by subsequent unfavourable circumstances (unless
revealing sources of error hitherto unsuspected), or even merely
" as time goes on." Of course into my expressed conviction
of the efficacy of the hand-control there entered even at the
time an appreciable element of uncertainty due to the fact that,
as usual, E. P. did not allow her hand to be grasped (I will
revert to this point). In my note on the sitting in question
I say also that " the conviction I here express . . . does not
apply to the possible hypothetical use of an apparatus."
With regard to Seance III. and the incident in connection
with mv wife controllino- it should be noted that at the time
the table was lifted up as if by Eusapia's hand, lier right hand
tvas linked with F.'s on. the table imcovered and dimly visible (as
stated in my note written out on the next day), whereas her
left was under th.e curtain (also upon the table) and invisible.
Our impression at the time (as expressed by F.) was that
substitution was impossible " (see my next day note). And to
quote my wife's words in her written statement (made the
next day) :
" I positively deny having lost contact with E. P.'s
hand a single moment durino; the incident described."
I may mention that before our sittings had begun I had
said to Mr. Feilding that it seemed to me very desirable to
make some decisive step in advance with regard to the con-
ditions of the " phenomena," and in view of all the doubts
and discussions to which the question of hand-holding with
E. P. gives rise, I suggested tliat we should " count" only
those " phenomena " which should occur tvith at least one of
the medium's hands visible. Neither of us seemed afterwards
inclined to adhere unreservedly to so high a standard ! But
in the incident under consideration we seem to have come
within measurable distance of it ! And thoufrh the unavoidable
lack of information as to certain particulars—for instance as
to the exact distance separathig Eusapia's two hands—is much
to be regretted, this occurrence has on the whole seemed to
me to be very instructive and tending to give support to the
theory that a " medium " is occasionally able—whether con-
sciously or unconsciously—to induce in the person controlling
24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1911.
him something like a tactile hallucination, for which view
there is to my mind very strong evidence on record in the
"chair-threading" experiments with Samhor.^
With regard to the table movements, I agree with Mr.
Feilding in thinking most of them inconclusive ; but I con-
sider that one partial table-levitation (away from Eusapia) which
we witnessed at the end of the third sitting, in a bright
light, three persons (Mr. Feilding, Mr. Meeson, the stenographer,
and myself) controlling E. P. and Mr. Marriott looking on, was
rather remarkable, and I thought it difficult at the time to
admit that Mr. Marriott's explanation (as given in the report)
could be the true one. I may add that from what he told me
I inferred that he had not actually seen E. P. throw up the table
with her fingers, but had concluded that this was her method.
On the whole, and though I am by no means absolutely
certain that any table movements and levitations we witnessed
were genuine, I think that here is matter for further investi-
gation. The conditions under which these things occur make
me think that they are or may be suitable for scientific
enquiry and I hope they may be investigated again. Even an
exposure of E. P.'s levitations so extremely damaging to her
mediumistic reputation as W. S. Davis's does not explain
everything, and gives us no right whatsoever to answer the
question definitely in the negative.
On the other hand, E. P.'s " cabinet phenomena," as I
have witnessed them (both in Naples in 1910 and in St.
Petersburg in 1898), have left me under the impression
that here matters ought to be seriously mended before we in-
vestigate them further. I agree with Mr. Marriott in thinking
^ These experiments (at least those made with this special aim by myself and
my friends) have absolutely convinced me that either passage of matter
through matter is a fact, or that a medium's hand, even when very well held
(not in the least as Eusapia's hands are), can liberate itself, and afterwards
return to its original position without the controller becoming aware of it.
And after some conversations I had on the subject with Mr. Marriott (an
expert in conjuring) I am even more than before inclined to see in this "chair-
threading" some unusual form of "supernormal suggestion," and shall not
believe this to have been a trick in the ordinary sense of the word until I
have been shown the same thing by a regular conjurer.
On the other hand, I still maintain that we have no good evidence whatever
of the possible production of collective hallucinations at spiritistic seances,
visual or other (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXI., pp. 436-482).
Feb., 1911. Further Sittings tvith Eusapia Palladino. 25
that the hand control she usually admits when such " pheno-
mena " occur is practically non-existent. She thi'ows every
obstacle in the way of this hand control. In my experience,
at least, she constantly objected to my holding even her thumb
or her little finger. She constantly complained of my squeez-
ing her hand too much. She insisted on her hands being
covered (with the curtain), and even asked that they should
be brought nearer to one another, and this at the most
successful sitting of the series,—the 2nd •
The hand-sub-
stitution I noticed repeatedly. Apart from this, she constantly
changes the respective positions of her limbs—both feet and
hands. The latter especially are a regular perijctuum mobile.
Now this circumstance is extremely important, for as tlie
conditions of the control are perpetually and ceaselessly
changing, illusions of memory as to the exact conditions under
which something occurred are eminently apt to spring up.
Of course the presence of a shorthand writer will to a great
extent eliminate this source of error ;
but, seeing that no
shorthand writer was present at the great majority of obser-
vations in the case of E. P., my present impression is that the
great bulk of the evidence re her " cabinet-phenomena " is of
no decisive importance.
In my experience, then, with such control as E. P. admits,
complete conviction in the trice sense of the word is strictly speahing-
unattainable. And what, I ask, is the use of " relative convic-
tion " like the one, say, I felt as to the efficacy of the control
at Seance II. ? The fact that I had this impression at the
time is interesting ; but it does not carry us one step further.
At most we are driven to the " supernormal suggestion " theory.
At future scientific stances E. P. must either allow her hands
to be plainly visible to all, or allow them to be grasped (as
Sambor invariably did, as I have said, during the experiments-
with the " chairs," thus giving something amounting to absolute
conviction). The foot-control, in which she places her foot
upon that of her neighbour, should also be done away with.
These demands are eminently reasonable. It is simply prepos-
terous to assert that they could act negatively on the " pheno-
mena." Enough time, money and work has already been spent,
and strictly speaking to no avail. A new departure must be
made at last.
26 Journal of Society fur Psychical Research. Feb., 1911.
If E. P. consents to the above conditions, well and good
;
if she does not, she must either be left alone ; or—a course
of action I should recommend—in future experiments we should
no longer investigate the " cal)inet-phenomena " themselves, hut
the conditions of tJic control at the time sticlh ''phenomena " are
occurring. Any " manifestations " taking place with both of
E. P.'s hands invisible (supposing they are controlled as un-
satisfactorily as they are now) should not be taken into account
at all. And particular attention should be given to making
clear whether anything will happen with either one or hotli, of
the medium's hands risihle. In the former case we shall
have to give full weight to the " supernormal suggestion
"
theory ; and only in the latter —if positive results are obtained
—shall we really have to face the hypothesis of a new " physical
force" and the like. If, on the contrary, after a new series
of experiments it is clearly shown that no " cabinet-phenomena
"
occur when both the medium's hands are visible, this negative
conclusion will be also very important and will make it
probable that in former experiments too we need not look
beyond errors of observation, illusions of memory, etc. (coupled
perhaps sometimes with some kind of " suggestion ") to account
for the most puzzling of Signora Palladino's performances.
Of course the question of the foot-control too is of vital
importance, since I, for my part, have little doubt, that the
medium's feet may more than once have played a fundamental
part in " spirit " touches and grasps.
III.
Detailed Account of the Table-Lifting Incident.
(«) Extract from Mr. Feilding's Notes on Stances
III. and IV. {November 26 and 28, 1910.)
December 1, 1910.
In the course of the two s«^ances the " phenomena " pro-
duced consisted of a few raps of doubtful origin, apparently
nofc in the table ; a few slides of the table of about an inch
at a time, not shown to be fraudulent but under unsatisfactory
conditions ;
an upsetting of the cabinet table to all appearances
accomplished by [E. P.'s] elbow; bulgings of the dress (quite unlike
Feb., 1911. Further Sittings with Easapia Palladino. 27
any bulgings which 1 have previously seen) and apparently
done with the foot ; a few movements of the curtain clearly
seen to have been done with the hand after substitution had
been effected; a movement of a chair close to tlie medium,
evidently done by the foot after substitution had actually been
notified ; and the lifting of the cabinet table clearly seen by
Marriott and myself against a card of luminous paint to have
been done with the hand controlled by Countess Solovovo.
Also one total and two or three partial levitations, as to which
there is a difference of opinion between Marriott and the rest
of us. It would be absurd to lay stress on small matters of
this kind following on a series of purely fraudulent phenomena.
The chief point of interest is the lifting of the cabinet table
visibly by Eusapia's hand, notwithstanding that the Countess
insisted on her not having lost control of the hand in question.
No substitution had been effected, her right hand being visible
in mine, and the only apparent alternatives are either the
formation of a tluidic hand on Countess Solovovo's (a theory
put forward by Cavaliere Chiaja) to lift the table ; or else a
mere lapse in her observation. Taking the case on its own
merits, the latter is of course the more reasonable assumption.
(h) Note on Seaxce of November 28, 1910.
By Count Solovovo.
Nuvemhcr 29 fh, 1910.
My wife controlling all the time on E. P.'s left, E., Mr.
Marriott, Meeson, then E. again on her right.
The seance may be safely put down as—to say the least—of
an extremely suspicious character throughout, with, however,
one exception. At a certain moment when an attempt was
being " mediumistically " made to pick up something in the
cabinet from the floor, E., who was controlling E. P. on her
right, saw against a luminous background E. P.'s left arm pro-
ducing the movement. Mr. Marriott, who was under the table
holding E. P.'s feet, saw the same thing. The medium's right
hand, linked with E.'s, was on the table uncovered and dimly
visible. The medium's left hand, which my wife controlled,
was also upon the table, but covered with part of the curtain.
On E. asking my wife whether she had not let E. P.'s hand
go, she emphatically denied it, stating that E. P., though not
28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., I9ii.
allowing her to hold her hand all the time in the proper sense,
did not withdraw it for a single moment, and repeatedly
clutched at it.
As F. said at the time, substitution was impossible. I also
dimly saw E. P.'s right hand linked with his over or on the table.
My wife's conviction that at the time she had not released
the medium's hand was absolute. But it is of course possible
that after being told over and over again by that cleverest of
conjurers, Mr. Marriott, that she was mistaken, she may feel less
certain about the matter. But we should not allow such
suggestions to work—whether one way or the other ; and in
justice to E. P. my wife's original and complete conviction
should be put on record.
(c) Note by Countess Solovovo.
Novemher 29th, 1910.
I positively deny having lost contact with Eus. P.'s hand a
single moment during the incident described, and, as my hand
with her left one was under the curtain, on the table, whereas
her right was visible, though it is true very dimly, and held
by F., and not near enough to mine to touch me with it, she
was not able to make one of her hands do duty for two.
[In reply to questions, the following further details of the
incident were sent to us by Countess Solovovo.—Ed.]
January IQtli, 1911.
(1) I was holding E. P.'s hand very lightly, because she
complained of being squeezed too tightly each time I tried to
hold her hand fully in mine, and most of the time she had
her hand on my hand and pressed it very strongly each time
a movement occurred, or was patting it, but not for a second
did I lose contact with it ; and when Mr. Feilding said :
" She
is using her hand, because I saw it clearly trying to lift up
the little table," I did not think he was speaking of the hand
/ held (I was so sure of having had it on mine all the
time), and when he told me I must have let it go, I posi-
tively denied it, and up till now I am as sure as one can
be of anything that she did not use the hand that was in
mine (or on mine). . .

(2) Her hand was not motionless, for, as I said before, she
moved it about over mine, patted me, pressed my hand very
strongly sometimes, sometimes let me hold hers fully in mine,
then would turn my hand down and put hers over, but all
the time without taking it off' entirely ; and when her hand
was over mine, I several times turned my hand and felt with
my fingers if her fingers were on my hand, and each time I
felt them I tried to do the same thing with my thumb, and
I felt also that it was the same hand I held all the time.
Our hands were on the table and covered by the end of the
left part of the curtain.
(3) My attention was all the time concentrated on holding
her hand, as I was sure of her foot, Mr. Marriott controlling
both feet under the table. He told me a few days later
that most likely my attention had been too much concen-
trated on holding her hand, and that on account of the
tension of my mind I had not remarked when she had
slipped away from me ; but I am sure that if I had said
my mind had been quite free during the time I held her,
and that I was not entirely and only occupied in observing
the hand I held, Mr. Marriott would have said I had been
" distraite," and had not remarked when Eusapia took away
her hand.
I think also that, had she taken away her hand for a
short time and afterwards brought it back again, I should
have felt a difference in my sensations before and after she
had removed her hand, whereas I felt no difference at all,
and continued feeling her hand in or on mine.
The little table was not lifted on to the table we sat at
(as far as I remember, perhaps I am wrong); it seems to me
it was lifted behind tlie curtain and then fell down again.
But it was only Mr. Feilding and Mr. Marriott who could see
what was going on behind the curtain ; I could not, as I was
not sitting facing the opening in the middle of the curtain,
but just behind it ; that is, the left half of the curtain was
opened in the middle, near E. P.'s head and shoulder, and, as
I was sitting on her left-hand side, I could not see what was
going on inside the cabinet unless 1 bent very much forward,
and at that moment I was absorbed only in attending to the
hand I held.
30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1911.
My impression is that she did not use her left hand in
lifting the little table, and during all the sitting it seemed to
me she was trying very hard to move the objects, but not
with her physical hands, but with some inner power, and she
seemed to suffer and to be very tired each time something
had moved.
I think this is all I remember of the sitting ; it is very
incomplete, but I have a very bad memory for details, and
remember only my impressions.

Comments on the Above.
By Alick Johnson.
Countess Solovovo's careful and detailed description of her
sensations during this incident seems to me to show clearly that
it was not, as Mr. Feilding suggests, through any " mere lapse
in her observation " that she let Eusapia's hand go ; while
the fact that the hand had somehow become free was proved
by the joint observations of Mr. Feilding and Mr. Marriott.
A lapse of attention or observation is a thing that frequently
occurs in ordinary life ;
everybody must be familiar with the
experience of failing to notice an object directly within his
view when he is thinking of something else. In some cases this
may almost amount to what is called a " negative liallucination."
But this is quite different from what Countess Solovovo
describes. Instead of failing to notice the presence of an
object, she had a clear perception of its presence while it was
absent : that is, she had a distinct and full-blown positive
hallucination or illusion, lasting evidently for a perceptible
period of time.
I am especially interested in this, because I have long
been convinced that a similar experience happened to me
during my second sitting with Eusapia at Cambridge in
1895. On that occasion Eusapia was standing up, Mr.
Myers standing on one side and holding her right arm and
hand, and I on the other side holding her left arm and hand,
my right arm being interlaced with her left. The two other
persons present were sitting on the floor behind her, so as to
see her dimly outlined against the white ceiling, the room
Feb., 1911. Farther Sittings ivith Easapia Palladiiw. 31
being extremely dark The.se witnesses saw an elongated
object proceeding from her body, moving about and often
changing in shape and length. It was too dark for them to
see how it was attached to her, or how the controllers were
holding her ; but if her left arm had got free, it could easily
have executed all the movements, and in doing so would have
presented just the appearance they described. The evidence
that the arm was not free depended solely on my conviction
that I was holding it. I was certain at the time that I was
holding it ; but later, in view not only of the systematic
frauds discovered, but also of my observations of various illu-
sions experienced at these sittings, I became convinced that
my impressions as to holding her arm on that occasion were
purely hallucinatory.
The evidence for this is, of course, not so clear as in Countess
Solovovo's case, since at the Cambridge sitting it was too dark
for the witnesses actually to see whether the elongated object
was Eusapia's arm or not ; and as they supposed at the time
that I was holding the arm, they took the object to be
something else. At the Naples sitting there was more light,
for the background was of luminous paint instead of an ordinary
white-washed ceiling, and here the arm that lifted the small
table was seen to be attached normally to Eusapia's left shoulder.
If it had been too dark to see this, the sitters would probably
have regarded the movement as supernormally performed, on
the strength of Countess Solovovo's conviction—apparently so
well founded—that she was holding Eusapia's left hand.
In my paper " On the Education of the Sitter " {Proceedings,
Vol. XXL, pp. 483-511) I brought forward evidence derived
from various different sources in support of the hypothesis
that some mediums have an unusual power of imposing illusions
and hallucinations on their sitters, and that this may account
for some of the most remarkable records of apparently telekinetic
phenomena. The case described above tends to confirm this
hypothesis. It does not, of course, explain all the phenomena
reported on good evidence to have occurred in the presence of
Eusapia ; but it suggests that those which depend ibr their
authenticity on the testimony of one witness as to the control
exercised—and a considerable proportion of the best cases come
under this definition—must be seriously discounted.

Note on the Report. •
_
By W. W. BaCxGally.
I should like to make a few remarks on the above Eeport.
Both the American sittings and those lately held with Eusapia
Palladino differ materially in many respects, but principally in
the following, from those held by Mr. Feilding, Mr. Carrington
and myself in Dec. 1908. In the American and in the
recent Naples sittings no phenoinena were obtained under the
following conditions :
" when both the medium's hands were
distinctly visible away from or quietly resting on the seance
table, or both hands clearly seen when being held by the
controllers and at the same time her body was in view down
to her feet." In these cases the supposition that the phenomena
were produced fraudulently through the substitution or release
of one of her hands or feet could not be entertained.
It was the phenomena under the above test conditions,
which we obtained at our seances in Dec. 1908, that greatly
impressed me, and I laid particular stress on them (and gave
some examples) in my final note in the Eeport of our Naples
sittings. So far I have not met with any satisfactory explana-
tion of how Eusapia could have produced these phenomena by
normal means. It is certain that no accomplice was present,
and we had satisfied oui'selves by examination that no apparatus
was being used.
I am afraid I cannot accept Miss Johnson's theory that
Eusapia possesses the power of inducing a continuous halluci-
nation of the sense of touch in tlie minds of her sitters.
Experienced investigators are well aware that a temporary
hallucination of this nature can be induced when a medium's
hand is surreptitiously removed for a moment from the con-
troller's hand. We were unceasingly on our guard against
such an occurrence at our Naples sittings. It should be noted
that Mr. Feilding states that the conditions of control permitted
in the recent sittings were wholly different from those permitted
in the former Naples sittings. In a letter that I have received
from Mr. Feilding, he says :
" Everything this time was different
[from our previous seances] and exactly like the reports given
of the American conjurers' sittings."

GENERAL MEETING.
The 137th General Meeting of the Society was held at Morley
Hall, George Street, Hanover Square, London, W., on Tuesday,
January 31st, 1911, at 5 p.m., Mr. H. Arthur Smith in
the cliair.
The Chairman announced that Mr. Andrew Lang had been
elected President of the Society for the year 1911.
Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S., then read a paper on
" Poltergeists : Old and New," which will, it is hoped, be
published later in the Proceedings. The following is a summary
of it:
The author remarked on the appropriate coincidence that
the announcement of Mr. Andrew Lang's acceptance of the
Mab., 1911. General Meeting. 37
Presidency of the Society for the ensuing year synchronized
with the reading of a paper on a subject to which Mr. Lang
had devoted so much attention and historical research.
There was no exact English equivalent for Poltergeist, but
as the German word foltcrcr meant a boisterous fellow, so
foltergdst was a boisterous ghost. It is a convenient term to
express those apparently meaningless noises, disturbances, move-
ments of objects and ringings of bells (even when the wires are
severed) for which no assignable cause can be found. The
phenomena are sporadic, breaking out unexpectedly, lasting a
few days or months and terminating as suddenly. They differ
from hauntings, inasmuch as ghostly forms are not seen, and
are associated not so much with a particular locality as with a
particular (and usually young) person in a particular room.
They appear to have some intelligence behind them, as response
to a definite number of raps, or other sounds, asked for by
the investigator, can usually be obtained. The phenomena take
place equally well in broad daylight, under the searching gaze
of investigators, or at night time. Of the genuineness and
inexplicable nature of the phenomena there can be no manner
of doubt, in spite of occasional attempts at their fraudulent
imitation. This latter, the author pointed out, sometimes occurs
after the original phenomena have passed away, and usually
when the psychic has been taken to a new locality.
The S.P.R. Journal for 1884, and the Proceedings for 1896
contain lengthy reports on " Poltergeists," by the late Mr.
Podmore, but these reports arrived, in the opinion of Professor
Barrett, at contradictory conclusions, and hence the necessity
for a reconsideration of the whole subject.
Professor Barrett had been led to devote a considerable
time to the investigation of the subject owing to two remark-
able cases of poltergeist occurring in Ireland, in one of which
he was a spectator of the phenomena, and in the other, a
recent case, he obtained the evidence of several trustworthy
eye-witnesses. This latter is
Tlic Enniscorthy Case.
Enniscorthy is a town in Co. Wexford, and the phenomena
broke out in July, 1910, on the arrival of a young carpenter
at some lodgings in the town. High testimony is borne to
38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mak., I9ii.
the character and truthfulness of this young man, named J.
Eandall, by the rector of his parish, who had known him for
several years. Eandall's account of the phenomena, which lie
wrote at the request of the author, agrees with the evidence
of two independent and intelligent eye-witnesses who were
present during part of the disturbances. Here the phenomena
took place after Eandall had retired to bed at night ; the bed-
clothes were pulled off, a heavy bed dragged into the middle
of the room, no one being near it, Eandall himself was lifted
off the bed and deposited on the tloor in the presence of the
witnesses, a chair ran across the room, no one touching it,
and loud knockings were heard in the room. These disturb-
ances continued for three weeks, until Eandall moved to another
house, and have not recurred in his new lodgings.
The Dcrrygonnclly Case.
Derrygonnelly is a hamlet some nine miles from Enniskillen,
in the N.W. of Ireland. The phenomena here broke out in a
small farmer's cottage in 1877, and consisted of objects being
thrown down and out of the house, loud knockings, stones
dropped in the room, etc. The author was able to visit the
spot whilst the disturbances were in progress, and had the
advantage of two scientific friends who assisted him in the in-
vestigation. No assignable cause could be found for the noises
heard in their presence, though a careful watch was kept both
inside and outside the cottage. In this case the knocks re-
sponded to the given number requested, even when that number
was silently willed. A full report of these occurrences was
published by the author in the Dublin University Magazine
for December, 1877. The medium or centre of the disturbances
was in this case the eldest daughter of the farmer, a girl
nearly 20 years old ; the phenomena ceased after two or three
months.
The " Atlantic Monthly " Case.
This case, described in one of the best American Eeviews,
the Atlantic Montldy for August, 1868, is one of the most
remarkable and evidential, if the testimony of the writer of the
article in the Atlantic Monthly is accepted. Here the pheno-
mena broke out on the arrival of a young servant girl in the
house of a family in Massachusetts, ceased when she was
Mar., 1911. General Meeting. 39
temporarily absent, returned on her return, and lasted some
ten weeks. The phenomena took place during the day, and
also in the bedroom at night, when the girl had retired to
rest. They were such that she could not possibly have pro-
duced them fraudulently. For instance, the bells of the house
rang during the day repeatedly and for long periods, even
after the wires had been severed ; the clappers of the bells
were seen to be vigorously moving, no one touching them,
and the bells suspended 11 feet above the floor. A heavy
stone slab, no one touching it, was seen to rise off its
support and fall back with such force as to break into
two, and this in day-light under the eyes of witnesses,
whilst the servant girl was wringing out some clothes. Other
startling noises and movements of furniture occurred, and no
doubt whatever was left in the minds of the eye-witnesses of
the genuineness and inexplicable nature of the phenomena.
Prof. Barrett then briefly related the case of a poltergeist
occurring on the Pacific coast at Portland, Oregon, fully detailed
in the Journal of the American Society for Psycliiccd Rcsearcli
for September and November, 1910. Here, after the original
disturbances had ceased, and the psychic, a boy, had been
moved to another house, fraudulent imitation of the phenomena
occurred, and the lad confessed to the fraud and even to some
of the original disturbances. The confessions of children must,
however, be received with caution, as shown in cases of children
accused of witchcraft, where they often confessed to the per-
formance of impossible feats, and were thereupon burnt to
death.
Among historic cases the Cideville parsonage poltergeist,
•which occurred in 1850, is perhaps the best attested, the
amazing and voluminous evidence being given on oath at a
trial ; it is narrated in Dale Owen's Footfalls on the Boundary
of Another World, as is also the famous Bealings bells case
in Suffolk in 1834. The Epworth poltergeist at the Wesleys'
parsonage in 1716, and the Tedworth poltergeist in 1661,
when Mr. Mompesson's children were the nucleus of the
phenomena, are well known, the latter being fully described
and investigated by Glanvil, one of the earliest Fellows of the
Royal Society. A complete tabular statement of poltergeists
old and new has been begun by the author. •
'
40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., I9il.
The paper ends with a summary of the conclusions to which
the author had been led, the essentially weak, temporary and
fugitive nature of the phenomena being pointed out. The dis-
turbances resemble practical jokes by mischievous children in the
unseen, and there are doubtless more such children there than
on earth. But no satisfactory explanation of the phenomena is
possible at present ; our duty being to collect, scrutinize, and
classify evidential cases, and where possible promptly investi-
gate the occurrences before they cease.
EEPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1910.
The membership of the Society has, as usual, increased con-
siderably this year. 23 new Members were elected and 2
Associates became Members; 126 new Associates were elected
and 4 Members became Associates. On the other hand, the
total loss in numbers from deaths, resignations, and other causes
was 24 Members and 94 Associates, leaving a net increase of
37. The total membership has now reached 1267, the numbers-
being distributed as follows: Members, 301 (including 24
Honorary and Corresponding Members); Associates, 966 (in-
cluding 11 Honorary Associates).
The Society has suffered two great losses this year in the
deaths of Professor William James and Mr. Frank Podmore,
papers in memory of whom, read at a recent meeting, will be
published in the next Part of the Proceedings.
Two Parts only of Procccdvnrjs were issued during the year, in
March and August ; but their total bulk amounted to only a
few pages less than the three Parts issued last year. They
gave the completed results of work, the progress of which
was referred to in last year's report, viz. accounts of Mr.
Dorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper in America, a second report on
Mrs. Holland's automatic writing, and Mrs. Verrall's paper on
a new group of automatic writers, the "Macs."; also a report,,
edited by Miss Verrall, of an earlier series of sittings with
Mrs. Piper, carried out under the supervision of Dr. Hodgson
and completed only a few weeks before his death. The record
of these sittings seems to constitute the most valuable part of
the voluminous material collected by Dr. Hodgson since his own
Mae., 1911. Report of the Council. 41
latest paper on Mrs. Piper, published in the Proceedings,
Vol. XIII.
The last Part of the Proccedvu/s contained also Mr. H.
Arthur Smith's Presidential Address for tlie year, and a
valuable discussion of some of the recent developments in
psychotherapy by Dr. Mitchell, to whom we are also indebted
for many of the "Notes on Current Periodicals" which appear
from time to time in the Journal to inform our readers of
important articles published elsewhere, bearing more or less
directly on psychical research.
The general growth of work has made it necessary to add
to the staff, and in June the Council appointed Miss Verrall
as Assistant Eesearch Officer, the appointment to date from
Michaelmas. Since then, Miss Verrall has, among other things,
been occupied in organising some series of experiments, and
has helped in the investigation of cases by personal interviews
with the witnesses. She has further read papers on psychical
research to two literary debating societies in London.
Much useful work of the latter kind has also been done by
Mr. Baggally, who during the year gave a lecture and read
three papers on Cross-Correspondences and other subjects ta
various societies in Brighton. Mr. Baggally has also been
indefatigable in rendering help in the investigation of some
difficult cases where expert assistance was especially wanted.
Miss Miles and Miss Eamsden have been continuing the
experiments in thought-transference, which they have carried
on at intervals for some years, with each other and a few of
their friends. Some of these were printed in the Journal for
December, 1910, and we are hoping for further results in this
important field.
It is interesting to note the extent to which psychical
research is influencing contemporary thought all over the world.
Thus, a Turkish psychical review was founded about a year
ago, to which one of our Honorary Associates, M. Sage, was
asked to contribute a sketch of the S.P.R. Slowly but surely
also its theories are permeating the more conservative field of
English science, as witness the serious and respectful treatment
of the subject at the present day in such journals as Nature.
The medical profession too shows a growing appreciation of
our work. Thus, the British Medical Journal for June 11th,.

44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., I9ii.
1910, reports an address delivered to the Dorset and West
Hants Branch of the British Medical Association by its Presi-
dent, Dr. T. F. Gardner, in which lengthy and emphatic
reference was made to the great services rendered to psychology
by the scientific treatment of it by the S.P.E.
The altered attitude of the profession is no doubt partly due
to the efforts of the Psycho-Medical Society, some of the leaders
of which were recruited from the ranks of our Council ; Dr.
Lloyd Tuckey having been elected as President in the first
year of its existence, Dr. Bramwell in 1908, and Dr. Mitchell
in the current year (1911).
Both the production and the investigation of automatic scripts
are steadily being continued, and some papers on the subject
will, it is hoped, shortly be published. Experience has shown
that it is necessary to study these scripts with great care
and to compare them in a laborious and detailed way with
one another before their real significance can be made out.
For not only do later scripts often throw light on obscure
passages in the earlier writings of the same automatist, but
the scripts of different automatists are sometimes found to-
be interrelated over a long period. The complicated nature
of these cases and the variety of psychological factors involved
make it necessary to proceed with caution, and if the experi-
ments are interrupted by premature disclosure and hasty
publication, much of their interest and value will inevitably
be lost. We hope that the results of the work will prove
valid for future generations as well as for ourselves ; but for
this they must be founded on the rock and not on the sand.
Such foundations cannot be hurried and must not be scamped.
The Account of Eeceipts and Expenditure for the year calls
for little remark. The total annual subscriptions—our most
important source of income—amount to a little more than last
year. The legacy of £100 from Mr. Eobert Hannah was
received this year. The sale of publications has slightly fallen
oiT in England but decidedly improved in America, with the
result that the total received is almost exactly the same as
last year. The Edmund Gurney Fund has, by resolution of
the Council, been merged in the general funds of the Society,,
so that a separate account of it will no longer appear.
On the expenditure side we note a considerable increase in
Mab., 1911. Report of the Council. 45
the cost of printing—about £116 more than last year—which
is the consequence of an increased literary output.
Some welcome gifts to the Endowment Fund for Psychical
Eesearch have been received this year, as noted in the Account
of that Fund, but it has not yet reached the point desired.
Two General and four Private Meetings of the Society (for
Members and Associates only) were held during the year.
The dates and subjects of the papers read were as follows

Podmore.

ality, with Eeport of a Case," by Dr. T. W. Mitchell.

Le Sjnriiisme dans ses Bapports avec la Folie. By Dr. Marcel
ViOLLET. Bloud et Cie. Paris, 1908. 120 pp.
Dr. Viollet has set himself no easy task. Writing as an expert
in mental diseases, he has attempted to set before the general
thinking jniblic some account of certain mental disorders which he
considers may be traced directly or indirectly to a belief in spiri-
tualism or to taking part in spiritualistic seances.
The subject is approached in a broad-minded spirit, and hostile
criticism is disarmed by the author's sympathy with any scientific
inquiry into supernormal phenomena, and by his willingness to
admit that there may be real facts underlying spiritistic theories,
however grotesque. In the concluding paragraphs the author hopes
that the book will appeal to the conscientious inquirer; and there
can be no doubt that a knowledge of psychology, abnormal as
46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae.,1911.
well as normal, is indispensable for any complete view of the
whole field of psychical research.
Dr. Viollet's description and classification of some of the types
met with at spiritualistic seances are in no way exaggerated.
Nothing is sadder than to see those who are mentally ill-equipped
at best for the ordinaiy experiences of life, being specially attracted
like moths to a candle by the mysterious glamour of spiritualism^
and coming away with their wings singed, more than ever unfitted
to deal with objective realities.
Dr. Viollet j^oints out clearly why it is that occurrences at
spiritualistic seances are of such danger to feeble types of mind
;
for, from their very nature, such phenomena as rappings, phantasms,
levitations, Avhether or not fraudulent or hallucinatory, ^ produce
sense impressions which come into consciousness without any apparent
logical sequence, i.e. apparently without any of the ordinary relation-
ships between cause and eff'ect which we are accustomed to expect in
our ordinary perceptions of realities. The sitter may then jump to
the conclusion that he is surrounded by invisible and mysterious
beings with unlimited powers, who may at any moment produce
results of an entirely unpredictable and capricious kind. This
credulity and attitude of expectant attention, combined with emotional
stress, may undoubtedly cause some dissociation of the higher cerebral
functions, and thus lead to a breakdown of the reasoning and critical
powers with which the sense perceptions are ordinarily interpreted.
Passing from the consideration of spiritistic phenomena, Dr. Viollet
points out how a belief in spiritualistic doctrine may endanger the
integrity of the reason. He deals, indeed, chiefly with extreme forms
of the doctrine, which are little, if at all, in vogue among English
spiritualists. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the starting
point of insane delirium in many cases relates to spiritistic beliefs.
Dr. Viollet defines delirium as the holding of false ideas, but in
order that a belief in false ideas can constitute an insane delirium
it must also so afiect the conduct of the holder as to alter his
relations to objective realities.
The major portion of the book is taken up by classification and
descrij>tion of spiritistic insanities or insanities with spiritistic colour-
ing. From the alienist's point of view, however, the classification
^ It is remarkable that in liis references to these phenomena the author
makes no attempt to discriminate between those for whose occurrence there is
some evidence, and those which are alleged to occur on the slightest possible
grounds, or have again and again been discovered to be fraudulent.
Mae., 1911. Notices of Books, etc. 47
is open to criticism, and many of the illustrative cases are not of
great value to the general reader.
Two clear warnings can nevertheless be drawn from the work under
discussion. First, that the investigation of spiritistic phenomena is
dangerous for any one of hysterical or psychasthenic constitution,
and may cause such permanent mental dissociation as to constitute
actual insanity. Secondl}', that some forms of actual insanity, notably
paranoia or dementia proecox, may, through accidental circumstances,
have delusions or hallucinations of a spiritualistic nature. These cases
are a danger not only to themselves, but also to others, if they are
admitted unawares into spiritualistic circles. It is very desirable
that they should not be encouraged, as they often are by well-
meaning but ignorant persons, to have to do with mediums.

New Evidences in Psychical Research. By J. Akthur Hill.
(William Rider & Son, Ltd., London, IDIL 3s. 6d. net.)
In the opening sentence of his preface Mr. Hill remarks that "it
is desirable in the interests of psychical research that experiences
of apparently supernormal nature should be put on record if they
reach a fairly high evidential level." The greater part of his book
consists of some careful records of certain cases of this kind, which
have come under his own observation. They include various types
of psychical phenomena, the most important contribution, both in
quantity and quality, being the record of a series of sittings held
by Mr. Hill himself and by various friends of his with Mr. Watson,
a professional medium. Mr. Watson is described as "a ' normal
clairvoyant ' who sees '
spirit-forms,' describing them, giving names
and various identifying details, and sometimes obtaining a con-
siderable amount of impressional or automatic script"; he does not
go into trance. He knew the principal sitter, Mr. Knight (a
pseudonym) by his real name, Mr. Knight having written to make
an appointment ; so far as was ascertained he knew nothing of
the other sitters, but there are several points in this connexion
upon which Mr. Hill might with advantage have been more
explicit. It is not always clear, for instance, whether the sitters
lived in the same town as the medium or in one which he was
accustomed to visit. The communications received in these sittings
consist mostly of the names, age, place of habitation, etc., of various
of the sitters' deceased relatives. The percentage of error is sur-
prisingly small (these sittings, it seems, were above the level usually
4S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., I9li.
attained by the medium); name after name is given with hardly
a mistake. This absence of error, taken in conjunction with the
fact that almost all the information is such as might by the
expenditure of sufficient labour be obtained by normal means, is
undoubtedly a suspicious circumstance. On the other hand the
sitters, though sceptically inclined, became convinced of the medium's
honesty ; he was never detected in any suspicious act ; it is not
easy in some cases to see how he could have obtained the necessary
information in the time and with the means at his disposal, and
in other cases, judging from the details given, it seems hardly
possible that he should have done so.
In discussing various explanations of these phenomena, Mr. Hill
says that he does not find the theory of thought-transference from the
sitter wholly satisfying, and tentatively suggests the theory that
the mind of the medium is somehow put cn rapport with the person,
alive or dead, about whom informatiou is given, by means of an
"object" connected with that person, the "object" being sometimes
the sitter himself He mentions as an instance a case in which a
medical diagnosis, said to be accurate, was given by a trance medium
from a lock of hair belonging to a patient about whose condition
the sitter knew nothing; he does not, however, state whether the
accuracy of the diagnosis was corroborated by a medical man.
In the remaining chapters of the book, Mr. Hill records some
interesting cases of telepathy and veridical hallucinations. He also
includes "a selection of cases giving an idea of recent S.P.R. in-
vestigation," which he thinks will " be useful to readers who have
no time for the study of very length}^ reports." It is for such readers
that the book has been written, and it seems well adapted to
this purpose. H. DE G. V.
The "Special Number" of The Practitioner for January, 1911,
deals with the subject of Neurasthenia, and niany of our readers
may be interested in the article contributed by Dr. Lloyd Tuckey
on the " Treatment of Neurasthenia by Hypnotism and Suggestion."
The disease is no doubt among those to which hypnotic or suggestive
treatment is especiall}' applicable, but unfortunately many patients
only seek it after they have tried everything else, and the more
long-standing is the case, the more difficult it is to cure. Neverthe-
less, in the hands of skilled and experienced practitioners, a large
number of cases have greatly benefitted. Dr. Tuckey gives a brief
account of several such in his own practice, explaining his methods
and principles of treatment and urging other medical men to try the
effect of it; for, he says, "The good results I have gained, and perhaps
better, are, I believe, attainable by any physician who will honestly
and sympathetically make trial of hypnotism." His clear and
moderate statements add weight to this appeal, while his judicious
comments on various theories of suggestion, and in particular the
stress he lays on the necessity for studying the psychological aspect
of it, are interesting and instructive.

on these subjects in special medical Parts of the Pro-
ceedings, to appear from time to time.
(c) To consider the possible bearings of these studies
on Psychical Eesearch proper.

NOTES ON PART LXII. OF PROCEEDINGS.
By Sir Oliver Lodge.
There are several striking things in the recent issue of the
Pi-occediwjs for March 1911. I will pick out two of them
for comment.
On page 43 there are seven sentences quoted by Professor
Pigou from Mrs. Verrall's script, all having some sort of
reference, more or less direct, to Dr. Verrall's three Greek
words now commonly referred to among members of the S.P.E.
as " the one horse dawn." Wluit must strike anybody looking
at those sentences is their apparently entire disconnexion from
each other. If they had arrived through different automatists
it would hardly have been possible to detect any connexion
between them, and after it had been pointed out we could
hardly have called it a cross-correspondence without a great
deal of emphasis on the word " cross," and very little on the
word " correspondence."
Mr. Balfour indicates his perception of this fact at the
bottom of page 48 ;
but the fact is so important as to be
worthy of special attention. There is, I suppose we may say,
an undoubted idea, or at least a unifying phrase, underlying
all these fragments, yet not only would they be insufficient
separately to convey that idea, they fail to show that they
April, 1911. Notes on Part LXII. of Proceedings. 53
contain any common idea at all. Had they occurred in the
scripts of separate automatists, in the customary way, they would
have been useless. I doubt if even a subsequent statement
as to the underlying meaning would have sufficed to enable
the fragments to be picked out from a mass of other
material. Their fragmentary character is so complete that
the ingenuity of composing them would have been wasted
;
unless indeed, as is often the practice of our collaborators,
some clue or key-word, or other hint, had been associated
with each of the fragments, so as to enable them to be
specially picked out and subsequently compounded. The
whole discussion between Mr. Balfour and Professor Pigou is
very instructive from the point of view of a student of
all such cryptic utterances, whose aim is to ascertain their
originating sources.
The other matter which excites my admiration is the
ingenious imitation of idea-conveying scripts, perpetrated by
the Piev. M. A. Bayfield on pages 85-87. In this excellent
parody or parallel—which surely is in every way legitimate
—
the idea latent in Mr. Bayfield's thought is expressed with
what must be considered rather over-clearness for purposes of
a complex cross-correspondence, since the first four lines
supposed to be obtained by the first automatist suggested at
once the rats in Hamelin town botli to myself and to a
friend to whom I read those four lines. And a few lines
further on the word " Piper " and subsequently the word " Hamel "
clinch it. Hence, on the usual (overstrained) hypothesis,
telepathy from this first automatist to the others would have
to be assumed ;
though indeed the others do not get it nearly
so clearly.
It seems to me that this experiment of producing imitation
script is one which more of us ought to try, although it is
unlikely that we could produce such good stuff as Mr. Bayfield
has produced. He speaks of being able to do it in five
minutes, by abandoning all control of his thoughts. 1 have
just tried myself to write three imitation scripts, such as might
be supposed to come through three different automatists, all
based upon a single idea which was not to be given clearly
to any one of them and yet which was to be unmistakably
there when pointed out. The process of writing them, in my
54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, I9ll.
case, can hardly be described as abandoning all control of my
thouo'hts : I should describe it more like this. I sit in front
of the fire with a pencil and pad, and keep one idea fairly
before me, restraining it, however, from coming out too clearly,
and not curbing but rather encouraging any side-issues or
lateral deflexions of thought which may arise ; not referring
to any book, of course, but merely jotting down reminiscences
carelessly and without any eftbrt to get them accurate.
The chief effort is not to get them too clearly ; the second
is to allow and rather encourage wandering thoughts (this
indeed is rather difficult) ; and third, to imitate roughly some
of the familiar manner and ejaculations of authentic script.
It took me not five minutes but twenty minutes, and the
result is not at all brilliant. I ({uestion whether it is wortii
printing, but I append it because it enabled me to realise
clearly the attitude of a hypothetical communicator attempting
to convey in this manner an idea which in his mind was
•definite, but which he did not wish to express too clearly,
and which could only be stated at all by selecting from such
fragments of notions as semi-spontaneously cropped up in the
minds he v/as trying to influence ; the thoughts in that case
getting only too easily out of control because they would not
be his own thouglits at all but the thoughts of the several
automatists.
And that brings me to the chief point of what I have to
say. Mr. Bayfield seems to think that the wanderings and
divarications in the scripts signify casual impulses of a sub-
liminal self—the subliminal self of the actual writer. I do
not of course know much about a subliminal self, but I suggest
that the vaguenesses and errors in script correspond very closely
with what we may imagine to be the difficulty of utilising
and controlling another person's thoughts, in some telepathic
manner, for the purpose of conveying some idea which is not
in his mind at all, and without putting it in his mind. The
difficulty of telepathic control of an automatist's hand, when
the automatist is not in the least entranced and has no idea of
what is being communicated, must be very great ; and the
amount of wandering and vagueness and indistinct allusiveness
which we perceive in real scripts seems to me entirely justified
by the supposed and ostensible circumstances of the case.
April, 1911. Notcs on Part LXIL of Proceedings. 55
My three scripts, produced all at one sitting, are far too
coherent to be good imitations. If they are all to be produced
through one person, they should be produced at different times,
when that person was in different moods and amid different
surroundings. They would then have a better chance of
being a fair imitation of the real thing ;
though even then
the method and design and difficulties are too artificial to
be satisfactory. The difficulties are self-constructed and not
real ones ; whereas in the production of real script—on what
is now my own working hypothesis in the Holland-Verrall
cases—where a surviving mind is trying to influence an alien
terrestrial mechanism which is normally controlled by another
mind, the difficulties are real.
With this prelude I subjoin the three imitation-scripts,
the result of my own mental activity. I propose to send
explanatory annotations upon them next month, and have
added reference numbers for that purpose.

All I need say in conclusion is this,—that in all the
imitation cross-correspondences,—whether those old obscure
ones produced through the indirect agency of Dr. Verrall,
or the recent more intelligible ones, the direct result of the
mental activity of Mr. Bayfield,—the influence of a single
mind in each case is an essential feature, and is more or
less manifested by the writings themselves.
In other words, the writings do not solely represent the
uncontrolled subliminal meandering of an automatist ;
they
do represent vague and random thoughts coerced or guided
into something like coherence by the action of one purposive
intelligence.
If this be admitted, the moral is obvious, though I have
no wish to express it too emphatically at the present stage.

DUAL PERSONALITY IN TRK CASE OF
WILLIAM SHARP.
The recently published Life of William Sharp (Fiona Macleod) ^
by his wife, contains much of interest and instruction from a
psychological point of view.
" My chief aim (says Mrs. Sharp in her preface) in writing
about my husband, and in giving a sketch of his life, has been
to indicate, to the best of my ability, the growth and develop-
ment in his work of the dual literary expression of himself."
In two important respects the case differs from what is
generally regarded as the normal type of multiple personalities :
(1) The two personalities of William Sharp were in a sense
co-ordinate : there was no clear and marked superiority—either
moral or intellectual—of one over the other, nor did the alter-
nation between them appear to be associated with any
pathological element. Like most men gifted with genuine
artistic powers, both were sensitive and highly strung; but
neither seems to have shown any serious want of balance or
of self-control. Both produced literary work of value ;
though
Fiona's far excels in originality and power of imagination.
(2) The distinction between marked alternations of mood,
which carry with them a greater or less degree of variation
in character, and actual alternations of personality, is generally
held by psychologists to depend on whether or not there is a
breach of memory between the different mental states. Recent
hypnotic work, however, such as that of Boris Sidis, is tending
to throw doubt on these hard and fast distinctions and to show
that breaches in memory—even if far-reaching in their effects
on character and action—may be not an essential feature, but
only the result of training and suggestion. There was, at all
events, no breach of memory between William Sharp and Fiona
Macleod, and the view that they were two personalities seems
to turn on their own clear and unwavering impression that so
it was—an impression apparently never divorced from their
belief in their underlying unity.

The whole case is well worth studying in full in the original. AVe
"ive here some extracts from the book to show its salient features.
(P. 125.) During much of the .suffering and tedium of those long
weeks [a serious illness which he went through in the spring of
1886, being then in his 31st year] the sick man passed in a dream-
world of his own ; for he had the power at times of getting out
of or beyond his normal consciousness at will. At first he imagined
himself the owner of a gipsy traveUing-van, in which he wandered
over the to him well-known and rauch-ioved soHtudes of Argyll,
resting where the whim dictated and visiting his many fisher and
shepherd friends. Later, during the long crises of the illness, though
unconscious often of all material surroundings, he passed through
other keen inner phases of consciousness, through psychic and dream
experiences that afterward to some extent were woven into the
Fiona Macleod writings, and, as he believed, were among the original
shaping influences that produced them. For a time he felt himself
to be practically dead to the material world, and acutely alive " on
the other side of things" in the greater freer universe. He had
no desire to return, and rejoiced in his freedom and greater powers;
but, as he described it afterward, a hand suddenly restrained him :
"Not yet, you must return." And he believed he had been "freshly
sensitised," as he expressed it; and knew he had—as I had always
believed—some special work to do before he could again go free.
The illusion of his wanderings with the traveU'ing van was
greatly helped by the thoughtfulness of his new friend Ernest Rhys,
who brought him branches of trees in early leaf from the country.
These I placed upright in the open window ; and the fluttering
leaves not only helped his imagination but also awoke " that dazzle
in the brain," as he always described the process which led him
over the borderland of the physical into the " gardens " of psychic
consciousness or, as he called it, "into the Green Life."
(P. 223.) From [about 1893, when F. M. first began to write] till
the end of his life there was a continual play of the two forces in
him, or of the two sides of his nature ; of the intellectually observant,
reasoning mind—the actor—and of the intuitively observant, spiritual
mind—the dreamer—which differentiated more and more one from the
othei-, and required diff'erent conditions, different environment, different
stimuli, until he seemed to be two personalities in one. It was a
development which, as it proceeded, produced a tremendous strain on
his physical and mental resources; and at one time between 1897-8
threatened him with a complete nervous collapse.
Apbil, 1911. Dual Personality in the Case of William Sharp. 59
And there was for a time distinct opposition between these two
natures which made it extreme!}' difficult for him to adjust liis life, for
the two conditions which were eijually imperative in their demands upon
him. His preference, naturally, was for the intimate creative work
which he knew grew out of his inner self; though the exigencies of life,
his dependence on his pen for his livelihood—and, moreover, the keen,
active interest " William Sharp " took in all the movements of the day,
literary and political, at home and abroad—required of him a great
amount of applied study and work.
(P. 244.) [Extract from a letter to his wift^, written while staying
alone in the Isle of Arran, and dated Feb. 20, 1895.] "There is
something of a strange excitement in the knowledge that two people
are here : so intimate and yet so far-off. For it is with me as
though Fiona were asleep in another room. I catch myself listening
for her step sometimes, for the sudden opening of a door. It is
unawaredly that she whispers to me. I am eager to see what she
will do—particularly in The Mountain Lovers. It seems passing
strange to be here with her alone at last."
(P. 275.) During his absence [in New York, in November, 1896],
F. M.'s romance, Green Fire, was published. The title was taken
from a line in " Cathal of the Woods," "0 green fire of life,
pulse of the world, 0 Love !
" And the deeper meaning of the
expression "Green Life"—so familiar to all who knew "Fiona
Macleod "—is suggested in a sentence at the close of the book
:
"Allan knew that strange nostalgia of the mind for impossible things.
Then, wrought for a while fiom his vision of green life, and flamed
by another green fire than that born of earth, he dreamed his
dream."
(P. 285.) [Extract from a letter to his wife, written in the spring
of 1897.] "More and more absolutely, in one sense, are W. S. and
F. M. becoming two persons—often married in mind and one nature,
but often absolutely distinct. I am filled with a passion of dream
and work."
(P. 292.) The production of the Fiona Macleod work was accom-
plished at a heavy cost to the author as that side of his nature
deepened and became dominant. The strain upon his energies was
excessive ; not only from the necessity of giving expression to the
two sides of his nature ; but because of his desire that, while under
the cloak of secrecy F. M. should develop and grow, the reputation
of William Sharj) should at the same time be maintained. More-
over, each of the two natures had its own needs and desires, interests
60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1911.
and friends. The needs of each were not always harmonious one
with the other, but created a complex condition that led to a severe
nervous collapse. The immediate result of the illness was to cause
an acute depression and restlessness that necessitated a continual
change of environment. In the early part of 1898 he went in turn
to Dover, to Bournemouth, Brighton, and St. Margaret's Bay. He
was much alone, except for the occasional visit of an intimate friend
;
for I could go to him at the week ends only, as I had the work in
London to attend to. The sea, and solitude, however, proved his
best allies.
(P. 297.) [From a letter to his wife, dated May, 1898.] "To-day
I took a little green leaf o' thorn. I looked at the sun tlirough it,
and a dazzle came into my brain —and I wished, ah ! I wished I
were a youth once more, and was '
sun-brother ' and '
star-brother
'
again—to lie down at night, smelling the earth, and rise at dawn,
smelling the new air out of the East, and know enough of men and
cities to avoid both, and to consider little any gods ancient or
modern, knowing well that there is only '
The Red God ' to think
of, he who lives and laughs in the red blood. . . .
" There is a fever of the '
green life ' in my veins—below all the
ordinary littlenesses of conventional life and all the commonplace of
exterior : a fever that makes me ill at ease with people, even those
I care for, that fills me with a weariness beyond words and a nos-
talgia for sweet impossible things.
" This can be met in several ways—chiefly and best by the
practical yoking of the imagination to the active mind—in a word,
to work. If I can do this, well and good, either by forced absorp-
tion in contrary work (e.g. Cajsar of France), or by letting that go
for the time and let the more creative instinct have free play : or by
some radical change of environment : or again by some irresponsible
and incalculable variation of work and brief day-absences.
" At the moment, I am like a man of the hills held in fee : I am
willing to keep my bond, to earn my wage, to hold to the foreseen :
and yet any moment a kestrel may fly overhead, mocking me with a
rock-echo, where only sun and wind and bracken live —or an eddy of
wind may have the sough of a pine in it —and then, in a flash —there's
my swift brain-dazzle in answer, and all the rapid falling away of these
stupiil half-realities, and only a wild instinct to go to my own."
(P. 301.) During the years that F. M. developed so rajjidly her
creator felt the necessity pressing hard on him to sustain, as far as
he could, the reputation of W. S. He valued such reputation as he
April, 1911. Dual Personality in the Case of William SItarp. 61
had and was anxious not to let it die away ;
yet there was a great
difference in the method of production of the two kinds of work.
The F. M. writing was the result of an inner impulsion ; he wrote
because he had to give expression to himself whether the impulse
grew out of pain or out of pleasure. But W. S., divorced as much
as could be from his twin self, wrote because he cared to, because
the necessities of life demanded it. He was always deeply interested
in his critical work, for he was a constant student of Literature in all
its forms, and of the Literature of different countries—in particular
of France, America and Italy. This form of study, this keen interest,
was a necessity to W. S. . . .
[In 190'J an attempt was made by some of William Sharp's friends
to have him put on the Civil Pension List. His limited means and
continued ill-health made the matter a serious one from a financial
point of view ; but it appeared that the pension would not be granted
unless he would allow his jealously guarded secret of the identity of
Fiona Macleod to be divulged to the House of Commons. The
following is an extract from the letter he wrote to Mr. Alexander
Nelson Hood, explaining that he could not accept the pension on
this condition :]
(P. 346.) "Rightly or wrongly, I am conscious of something to
be done-—to be done by one side of me, by one half of me, by
the true inward self as I believe—(apart from the overwhelmingly
felt mystery of a dual self, and a reminiscent life, and a woman's
life and nature within, concurring with and oftenest dominating the
other) —and rightly or wrongly I believe that this, and the style so
strangely born of this inward life, depend upon my aloofness and
spiritual isolation as F. M. To betray publicly the private life and
constrained ideal of that inward self, for a reward's sake, would be
a poor collapse. And if I feel all this, as I felt it from the first
(and the nominal beginning was no literary adventure, but a deep
spiritual impulse and compelling circum.stances of a nature upon
which I must be silent) how much more must I feel it now, when
an added and great responsibility to others has come to me, through
the winning of so already large and deepening a circre of those of
like ideals or at least like sympathies in our own country, and
in America—and I allude as much or more to those who, while
caring for the outer raiment, think of and need most the spirit
within that raiment, which I hope will grow fairer and simpler and
finer still, if such is the will of the controlling divine wills that
above the maze, watch us in our troubled wilderness.

" That is why I said that I could not adopt the suggestion, despite
promise of the desired pension, even were that tenfold, or any
sum. As to 'name and fame,' well, that is not my business. I am
glad and content to be a '
messenger,' an interpreter it may be.
Probably a wide repute would be bad for the work I have to do.
Friends I want to gain, to win more and more, and, in reason, '
to
do well ' : but this is always secondary to the deep compelling
motive. In a word, and quite simply, I believe that a spirit has
breathed to me, or entered me, or that my soul remembers or has
awaked (the phraseology matters little) —and, that being so, that
my concern is not to think of myself or my '
name ' or '
reward,'
but to do (with what renunciation, financial and other, may be
necessary) my truest and best."
(P. 409.) It was our habit, when talking to one another of the
" F. M." writings, to speak of Fiona as a separate entity. ... It
was William's habit also to write and post to himself two letters
on his birthday [_ie. one from W. S. to F. M., and one from F. M.
to W. S.] —letters of admonition and of new resolutions. On the
12th September, 190."), he brought me the two birthday letters when
they reached him, and gave them to me to read, saying, with a
smile, " Fiona is rather hard on me, but she is quite right."
(P. 42.3.) In surveying the dual life as a whole, I have seen
how, from the early partiall}' realised twin-ship, " W. S." was the
first to go adventuring and find himself, while his twin, "F. M.,"
remained passive, or a separate self. When " she " awoke to active
consciousness "she" became the deeper, the more impelling, the
more essential factor. By reason of this severance, and of the
acute conflict that at times resulted therefrom, the flaming of the
dual life became so fierce that " Wilfion " —as I named the inner
and third Self that lay behind that dual expression—realised the
imperativeness of gaining control over his two separated selves and
of bringing them into some kind of conscious harmony. This was
what he meant when he wrote to Mrs. Janvier in 1899, "I am
going through a new birth."
For, though the difference between the two literary expressions
was so marked, there was, nevertheless, a special characteristic of
"Wilfion" that linked the dual nature together—the psychic quality
of seership if I may so call it. Not only did he, as F. M., "dream
dreams" and "get in touch with the ancient memory of the race"
as some of "her" critics have said; but as W. S. he also saw visions
by means of that seership with which he had been dowered from
April, 1911. Dttal Personality in the Case of William Sharp. 63
childhood. And though, latterly, he gave expression to it only
under shelter of the Fiona Macleod writings—as for instance in Tlie
Divine Adventure, because he was as sensitive about it as he was to
the subtler, more imaginative side of his dual self—a few of his
friends knew William Sharp as psychic and mystic, who knew
nothing of him as Fiona Macleod.
(P. 424.) It is true, as I have said, that William Sharp seemed
a different person when the Fiona mood was on him ; but that he
had no recollection of what he said in that mood was not the case.
That he did not understand it, is true. For that mood could not
be commanded at will. Different influences awakened it, and its
duration depended largely on environment. " W. S." could set him-
self deliberately to work normally, and was, so far, master of his
mind. But for the expression of the "F. M." self he had to wait
upon mood, or seek conditions to induce it. But, as I have said,
the psychic, visionary power belonged exclusively to neither ; it
influenced both, and was dictated by laws he did not fully under-
stand. For instance, "Lilith," "The Whisperer," "Finis," by W. S.
and "The Woman with the Net," "The Last Supper," "The Lynn
of Dreams " by F. M. were equally the result of direct vision.
I remember from early days how he "would speak of the momen-
tary curious " dazzle in the brain " which preceded the falling away
of all material things and preluded some inner vision of Great
Beauty, or Great Presences, or of some symbolic import—that
would pass as rapidly as it came. I have been beside him when he
has been in trance and I have felt the room throb with heightened
vibration. I regret now that I never wrote down such experiences
at the time. They were not infrequent, and formed a definite
feature in our life.
DUBLIN SECTION OF THE SOCIETY FOE PSYCHICAL
RESEAECH.
Eepokt for the Year 1910.
The work of the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical
Eesearch during the past year in many respects shows con-
siderable progress when compared with the preceding year.
The annual general meeting was held on January 28th, 1910,
and the first ordinary meeting of the session on February 10th.
A series of ten meetings was arranged from February lOtli
to June 2ord, and a programme of work for each meeting was
previously arranged by the Committee. In this series some
64 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. April, 1911.
interesting contributions and papers were given by the members,
including an address by Dr. Dolierty and papers by Miss de
Eobeck, Mr. Pemberton, and Mr, Wilson.
For the series of meetings arranged for the Autumn Session,
from October 27th to December 8th, a full programnie was
issued beforehand to the members, giving the particulars of
the principal business of the meetings, including the titles of
the addresses, etc. This plan was most successful, and the
average attendance of the members was almost double that of the
meetings held in the earlier portion of the year. In this
Autumn series of meetings the addresses of Dr. Doherty, Mr.
Haslam, and Miss Miles were of special interest. Miss Miles
gave a most interesting paper on " Telepathy at a distance,"
which was all the more appreciated because she had taken the
trouble of coming from London to deliver it.
The success attending the plan of announcing beforehand the
full particulars of the programme for each meeting to the
members has been so marked that the Committee will continue
this course for the present year.
The Committee desire to place on record the very great loss
that the Society has sustained by the sudden death of our
Vice-Chairman, Mr. .John Ellard Gore.
During the past year there has been a notable increase in
the number of our members. At the beginning of the year the
number of members on the roll of the vSociety was about 80,
the number is now over 110.
Some private experimental work has been recently attempted
by small sections of the members, Init the results, so far as
brought before the Section, though encouraging, have not been
of a very definite character.
The Society is most fortunate in having the constant guidance
and sympathetic assistance of its chairman. Professor Barrett.
His whole-hearted interest in its researches and his constant
efforts on its behalf give courage and hope to the Committee
to continue experimental work.

CKOSS-COEEESPONDENCES.
A Reply to Mr. Gerald Balfour.
By Professor A. C. Pigou.
In the Proceedings of last March Mr. Gerald Balfour con-
tributed an elaborate and valuable article in criticism of
^irguments put forward in a paper published by me in June,
1909. I hope at some time to be able to reconsider the whole
problem of cross-correspondences in the light, both of the
criticisms which my paper has evoked, and also of the large
mass of new evidence that has accumulated since it was
written. There is, however, little prospect of my being able
to do this in the near future, and I am unwilling to leave
Mr. Balfour's argument wholly unanswered for an indefinite
time. I venture, therefore, to ask for sufficient space in the
Journal to permit of a brief provisional discussion.
Mr. Balfour begins by giving a summary statement of my
thesis, which seems to me, if I may say so, to be entirely
just. He then examines in turn each of the three principal
stages of the argument, and decides that it " fails at almost
every point." While frankly admitting that his criticism is
successful at several points, I am not inclined to cede my
main position. In this reply I will, as far as possible, follow
the order of the criticism, using in each case the summary
statement of my argument as given there.
My first proposition was :
" The Piamsden-Miles experiments
show that the production of a simple cross-correspondence is
not outside the known powers of the subliminal self." The
argument ran as follows. In the experiments in question, the
supraliminal consciousness of one person endeavoured to trans-
fer a particular impression to another person. It sometimes
happened, however, that a different impression—one which had
passed through the supraliminal consciousness of that person in
the course of the day-—was in fact transferred. Nobody would
deny that the '
agent ' in this case—the question whether the
'
agent ' acted with intention I postpone—was the subliminal
consciousness. Hence, we have experimental evidence that A.'s
subliminal consciousness may affect B. in a particular way when
A.'s supraliminal consciousness is endeavouring to affect him in
Mat, 1911. Cross-Correspondences. 67
quite a dijfcnmt way. This fact, I argued, nialccs it prohoMc—
I never put the case higher than this—that A.'s subliminal
consciousness could affect B. when A.'s supraliminal conscious-
ness was not endeavouring to affect him in any way. Mr.
Balfour replies that " the attitude of A.'s supraliminal con-
sciousness may have been a conditio sine quel non. of there
being any thought-transference at all" (p. 41). I admit the
force of this criticism, and I agree that, in order to establish
my proposition securely, we need to take account, not merely
of the Eamsden-Miles experiments, but also of other psychical
phenomena. Mr. Balfour, however, as I understand him, while
rightly criticising my argument, does not deny the proposition
which it was intended to support. He recognises that more
conclusive evidence in its favour could easily be adduced. I
had referred to the existence of this evidence as a matter of
common knowledge, but had mistakenly supposed that the
argument from the Kamsden-Miles experiments could be made
water-tight without direct appeal to it.
My second proposition is summarised as follows. " The
results of Dr. A^errall's attempts to get a certain Greek phrase
reproduced in Mrs. Verrall's automatic script show that the
subliminal consciousness can also produce the complementary
element in a complementary correspondence." Apart from
certain general comments on my attitude towards '
intention,'
which will be discussed under the next head, Mr. Balfour's
principal criticism consists in the suggestion that the comple-
mentariness present in this correspondence may have resulted
directly from the activity of Dr. Verrall's supraliminal con-
sciousness. "It might result incidentally from thought-trans-
ference from a consciousness which, without any deliberate
intention to produce complementariness, dwells now on one,
now on another, aspect of the idea to be transferred, with
corresponding modification of the impressions produced " (p.
46). He supports this suggestion by reference to a particular
instance, where it would seerd that " Dr. Verrall, from his
examination of the script, knew that something was wanting
and tried successfully to supply it" (p. 47). I had not
thought of this explanation, and recognise that, in view of it,
a smaller part of the complementariness in Mrs. Verrall's script
should be attributed to subliminal activity than I had at first
68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1911.
supposed. Mr. Balfour himself, however, does not contend that
the whole of the complementariness present should be attributed
to supraliminal activity operating in the way described. Apart
from the argument about intention, which I have postponed,
he would not, I think, deny that there is a sufficient amount
of complementariness in the script, not susceptible of explan-
ation by reference to this activity, to justify my second
proposition.
It is in connection with the third proposition that we reach
the fundamental point in dispute. Mr. Balfour states the pro-
position thus. " The complementary element exhibited iu what
for shortness' sake we may call the A-^errall case, is comparable
in all essentials with the complementary element in the best
cross-correspondences recorded in the Froceedinr/s up to the date
of Professor Pigou's paper" (p. 39). He rejects this proposition
upon the ground that these cross-correspondences differ from
the Verrall case in the essential fact that their structure shows
evidence of purpose, while the Verrall case does not show such
evidence. In the course of his discussion of this point, and
also in earlier parts of his paper, he criticises the ambiguity,
as he considers it, of my whole attitude towards the question
of purpose or intention. On tliis matter there has, as it seems
to me, been a certain amount of misunderstanding, and I will,
therefore, begin by trying to mal^e my position somewhat more
clear.
The supraliminal consciousness is known to all of us, and
what is meant by '
intention '
on the part of such a conscious-
ness is well understood. Behind the supraliminal consciousness,
and somehow connected with it, there exists a something that
we commonly call the subliminal consciousness or self, but
which, since we do not know that it is conscious in any
ordinary sense, it would perhaps be better to call the sicbli/ninal
heing. Of the nature of this being we are almost entirely
ignorant. Throughout my paper I avoided the question whether
it acts with '
purpose ' or '
intention,' because, in connection
with such an entity, I cannot attach any clear meaning to
these terms. To ask the question seems to me to imply a
tacit assumption that A.'s subliminal being is a second '
con-
sciousness '
of the same kind as his supraliminal consciousness,
endowed like it with conscious cognition and volition, acting
Mat, 1911. Cross- Corresponde n ces. 69
through the same processes and differing from it merely
numerically. This, I may add in passing, is my answer to Mr.
Balfour's question concerning the A^errall case : Why is the
argument from absence of intention valid against origin in Dr.
Verrall's conscious self, and not equally valid against subliminal
origin?" (p. 45). It is not equally valid for the same
reason that it would not be equally valid against mechanical
origin. We are not justified in speaking about the subliminal
being as if it were merely an extra supraliminal consciousness,
whose structure we understand. It is to my mind a negative
concept—that background of consciousness to whose unexplained
and mysterious action we refer those psychical effects which
persons produce but which they do not seem to produce by
supraliminal activity. Kegarding the matter in this way, I
naturally preferred to ask whether the cross-correspondences
for which discarnate origin is claimed differ in any marked
degree from the A^errall cross-correspondence where incarnate
origin is admitted, rather than to ask whether either or both
of the groups of cross-correspondences under review are probably
the result of purpose. I was simply avoiding a difficulty not
relevant to the matter in hand. If no marked difference appears
between the Verrall cross-correspondence and these other cross-
correspondences, and if the complementariness in the Verrall
cross-correspondence is attributed to subliminal activity, then
the complementariness in the other cross-correspondences ought
also to be attributed to this cause. Of course, were we to
decide that the structure of the correspondences in the one
case points to intention on the part of the subliminal being,
we should be bound, having already argued that the structure
in the two cases is similar, to decide that intention is pointed
to in the other case also. But, in order to determine whether
two structures are similar, it is not necessary to determine
whether a particular arrangement, which is common to both
structures, came by accident or came by design.
In the preceding paragraph I have been concerned to ex-
plain and defend my method. I now turn to the issue of
fact, Mr. Balfour holds that some of the recorded cross-corre-
spondences do differ from the A^errall case in a marked degree,
and he points out particular characteristics which, in his view,
they possess and the Verrall case does not possess. The
70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9ii.
question whether the alleged distinguishing characteristics are
valid evidence of design seems to me, as I have said, to be
of secondary importance, but the question whether distinguish-
ing characteristics exist is, of course, fundamental. In the
imaginary examples of extreme cases, which Mr. Balfour gives
on p. 52 of his paper, such characteristics undoubtedly do exist.
The complementary element is much stronger and much more
exact than it is in the Verrall case. This, I imagine, nobody
would deny. Nor was it ever my intention to suggest that
the Verrall case could be regarded as analogous to any possible
cross-correspondence. My thesis was much less ambitious.
After examining a good number of the cross-correspondences
that have actually occurred, I came to the conclusion that, in
strength and exactness, the complementary element present in
them was not markedly superior to that present in the Verrall
case. Whether I was right or wroncf in this is an issue of
fact upon which different people will naturally judge differently.
It is an issue, too, I need hardly say, upon which Mr. Balfour's
opinion should carry great weight. Without a renewed and
lengthy study of the published cases I could not at this time
undertake a defence of the conclusion which I reached con-
cerning it nearly two years ago—and other work presses heavily.
For the present, therefore, I must leave the matter so.
AN INCIDENT IN MRS. HOLLAND'S SCRIPT.
By Alice Johnson.
In my first report on the automatic writing of Mrs. Holland,.
I quoted a piece of script produced by her in India on
January l7th, 1904,-' the concluding part of which was as
follows
:
"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers"—^ •
Dear old chap you have done so much in the past three
years—I am cognisant of a great deal of it but with
strange gaps in my knowledge—If I could only talk with
you—If I could only help you with some advice—I tried
more than once did it ever come—There's so much to be
learnt from the Diamond Island experiment
—
well meaning but very ignorant—bound to be tinged by
the channels through which tliey are conveyed—Help me
—give me the help if not yet of your belief of your

MAt, 1911. An Incident in Mrs. Holland's Script. 71
sympathy —Take the message to you all I cannot yet fully
and [ending in illegible scribble].
I stated in a foot-note to this script that I was unable to
conjecture the meaning of the phrase " Diamond Island experi-
ment ;
" and Mrs. Holland, who was accustomed to tell me of
any facts within her knowledge that could throw light on the
script, had made no comment on it. Nor did it convey any-
thing, as far as I could learn, to those who read the Proceedings.
On Nov. 24th, 1908, Mrs. Holland, being in England, came
to see me and told me among other things that she thought
this phrase must be an allusion to wireless telegraphy, since
Diamond Island (which she believed to be near Diamond
Harbour at the mouth of the Hoogli river) had a wireless
station on it. Some time later Mrs. Verrall, hearing of this
interpretation, pointed out to me that it followed that the
whole of this part of the script was intended to be addressed
to Sir Oliver Lodge, and I then perceived that most of the
message evidently was intended for him. But on communi-
cating with him on the subject, though he recognised the
appropriateness of the general tone and substance of the message,
'
the phrase " Diamond Island " awoke no chord in his memory.
He told me, however, that the Lodge-Muirhead system was at
work between Burma and the Andaman Islands, and he wrote
to his friend and partner in this matter, Dr. Alexander Muir-
head, F.E.S., on Feb. 24, 1910, to ask:
Do you remember whether anj' wireless experiments were conducted
across the mouth of the Hoogli or anywhere in that neighbourhood ?
If so, can you name the place 1 ... I should rather like to know
whether they tested the Andaman installation first at the Hoogli
—
or wherever it was. They must have tried it somewhere ... Is
there a wireless station on the Hoogli, do you know?
Dr. Muirhead replied on Feb. 26, 1910:
I believe Mr. Simpson, the man who put up the Andaman Wire-
less, has been conducting some experiments between a pilot boat
. . . and Calcutta. . . . The Andamans circuit is between Diamond
Island, at the mouth of the Irrawaddy in Burma, and Port Blair . . .
Thus it appears that Mrs. Holland's conjecture of a con-
nection between Diamond Island and wireless telegraphy was
correct, but that she had located it wrongly, viz., at the mouth
of the Hoogli, whereas it is really situated at the mouth of the
Irrawaddy, in Burma. From enquiries made with Sir Oliver
72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9ll.
Lodge's help, I find that towards the end of August, 1904,
operations were begun for linking up the Settlement of Port
Blair in the Andaman Islands with the general telegraph system
of India by establishing wireless telegraph stations at Port Blair
and at Diamond Island, which was already connected by cable
to the mainland. The distance to be spanned was o05"2 miles.
The system chosen was the Lodge-Muirhead, with which pre-
liminary experiments had already been carried on for three
months in the early part of 1904; the 150 feet masts were
made in the Calcutta workshops, the scientific apparatus being
supplied by the Lodge-Muirhead Co. in England. The work,
which was executed by the Indian Government Telegraph
Department, went on for several months, the circuit being in
complete working order first on Feb. 10th, 1905.
This installation was an event of some importance in the
history of wireless telegraphy, for it was one of the first
installations in the British Empire connecting different land
stations ; the main developments of wireless telegraphy having
previously been for the purpose of connecting shore stations
with ships.
Sir Oliver Lodge of course knew of the Burma-Audamans
installation, but had entirely forgotten that the Burma end of
the installation is on Diamond Island ^ (which is a very small
island, not marked on most atlases).
When I questioned Mrs. Holland about her knowledge of
these matters, she told me that she had known at or about
that time that the Lodge-Muirhead system of wireless telegraphy
was being experimented with in India, but she could not say
whether it was before or after the date of the script, which
had conveyed no meaning to her when it was written.
In reply to a question what normal means of acquiring
information about experiments on Diamond Island existed in
India in January, 1904, Mr. M. G. Simpson, of the Govern-
ment Telegraph Department, who had superintended the setting
up of the installation, wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge from Calcutta
on April 18 th, 1910 :
... In 1902 I was at home, but some of my officers did some
wireless experiments in July at Diamond Harbour. They were not
1 From a letter on the subject which he has recently found, it appears that
the geographical fact did actually come under his eye, but awakened no conscious
attention, in March, 1903.
Mat, 1911. An Incident in Mrs. Holland's Script. 73
very successful, but a paragraph or two appeared in the local press
about them. I came out here in December 1902, and in 1903,
January, I put up a little temporary station at Sanger Island at the
mouth of the river and another on a small Government steamer, the
"Guide," and we worked out to the Sandheads where the pilot
vessel is stationed 40 miles from Sanger. This was reported in due
course and found its way into the papers. During the whole of
1903 there was a weekly financial paper. Capital, in Calcutta con-
stantly jibing at Government for their dilatoriness with regard to
wireless and urging them to come to terms with the Marconi Co.
In Jan., '04, apparatus began to arrive from Elmers End [Messrs.
Muirhead & Co.'s works in Kent] and in February we started out
from Calcutta to try and link up Diamond Island with the Andamans.
I can't be quite certain now, but I think it is more than probable
information of this intention appeared in the local press. At first
we established communication over a short distance. Elephant Point
to Amherst, and it was not till April, 1904, any actual experimenting
was done on Diamond Island.
The script referring to the Diamond Island experiment was
written, as stated above, iu January, 1904 ; but from
Mr. Simpson's letter it appears not impossible that Mrs. Holland
may already have seen references to the subject in one of the
Indian papers. She herself knows nothing in detail of wireless
telegraphy, and she could not remember that any of the friends
she was accustomed to see at that time had spoken to her of the
subject or took any interest in it. It happened, however, that
she had heard a lecture by Marconi in 1901 or 1902, and had
rather regretted that an Italian was (as she supposed) ahead of
Englishmen in the subject. Consequently she was pleased when
she heard of the Lodge-Muirhead system being used. She
wrote to me on March 19th, 1910 :
I am sorry that I cannot be certain, after the lapse of so many
years, if I heard or read any mention of the Lodge-Muirhead system
before writing the script of Jan. 17th, 1904.
My impression is that I must have seen some newsj^aper reference
to it, since I am as sure as I can be, when dealing with anything
so far away, that I did not hear any conversation about it.
I left India in April, 1904, and returned there more than two
years later.
My ignorance of the matter is shown b)'' my belief—until just
lately—that Diamond Island was near Diamond Harbour in Bengal,
instead of in Lower Bui'ma, where it is really situated.
It is clear then that Mrs. Holland's reference to the " Diamond
Island experiment " cannot be regarded as strictly evidential,
since she may have had normal knowledge of it.
74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 191i.
The script nevertheless is remarkably appropriate in several
respects as a message to Sir Oliver Lodge. It was written on
Jan. I7th, 1904, the third anniversary of Mr. Myers's deaths
which was also the end of Sir Oliver Lodge's three years'
Presidency of the S.P.E. I take the phrase—" you have done
so much in the past three years " to refer to this. The tone
of affectionate intimacy running through the whole script is
also especially appropriate.
Mrs. Holland knew the date of Mr. Myers's death and that
Sir Oliver Lodge had been President of the S.P.Pi. in 1903;
but when I asked her if she knew in January, 1904, that
he was an intimate friend of Mr. Myers's and that he had been
President for three years, she replied
:
Feb. 20th, 1910.
... I did not realise then that Sir Oliver Lodge was an intimate
friend of Mr. Myers's. There were references to him, of course, in
[Hitman Personalifii\, especially in reference to early experiments with
Mrs. Piper; but I did not know there was a friendship of long
standing, and I certainly did not know in Jan., 1904, that he became
President of the S.P.E. after Mr. Myers's death. I am surprised to
hear that he held it for three years, —I thought it had been for
two ... It never struck me before that this message was to Sir
Oliver Lodge. . . .
It is further significant that, as Sir Oliver Lodge tells me,
Mr. Myers had been keenly interested in his work in wireless
telegraphy and it was while with Mr. Myers and stimulated
by him that he devised the fundamental plan for " tuning " which
in some form or another is necessarily used in all systems of
wireless telegraphy and was first patented by him in 1897.
The term " syntony " was invented for him by Mr. Myers and Dr.
A. T. Myers. Sir Oliver Lodge had, as is well known, been ex-
perimenting for years on the theoretical side of the subject,
and it was partly, or even largely, his discoveries between 1888
and 1894 which, in the energetic hands of Mr. Marconi, in
1896 and onwards, led to the development of wireless telegraphy
for practical purposes. Mr. Myers had been much interested in
this development and anxious that the results of his friend's work
should not be unduly exploited by others.
While the script is thus thoroughly characteristic of the
relation between Mr. Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge, the fact
that it is connected in point of time with the first important
Mat, 1911. An Incident in Mrs. Holland's Script. 75
cross-correspondence between Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Yerrall
—
the " Selwyn Text Incident " —seems to lend weight to the
supposition that what we may call the " Diamond Island script
"
may have been at least partially inspired by him.
I may add that the patent referred to above for "Improve-
ments in Syntonised Telegraphy without Line Wires " is the
one which, by Mr Justice Parker's judgment delivered in the
Chancery Division of the High Court on April 28th, 1911, has
just been renewed to Sir Oliver Lodge for another term of seven
years.

Contemporary Notes on the Above by the Author.
The subject is Gilbert Murray's verse translation of the
JSiirpolytus of Euripides.
(1) Here an attempt to give the first syllable of the name
Hippolytus is mixed up with a reminiscence of Dr. and Mrs.
Verrall's " One horse dawn." The fleeting and probably absurd
idea is also indicated that the second syllable of the name
may be derived from \vw, to loose.
(2) Here an attempt is made to refer to the sea-shore, and
the title of one of George Meredith's novels makes its gratui-
tous appearance. The phrase, " the unseaswept sands," occurs
in a speech of the Nurse to Phiedra.
(3) This is part of two successive lines in one of the
choruses
:
" There roamed a steed in (Jichalia's wild,
A maid without yoke, without master."
(4) Is part of an ejaculation of the wounded Hippolytus
—
" Oh a spear, a spear, to rend my soul to its rest."
(5) Then an attempt is made to get the name Epidaurus,
on the sea-coast of which the catastrophe to the chariot
occurred, but it is shunted off by the idea or obsession of
G. B. Dorr.
Mat, 1911. Imitation Gross-Correspondence. 17
(6) Begins an attempt to get the notion of a paternal
curse, mingled with the attempt to give the name Murray.
(7) " Curse from the water " would have appeared to give
too complete an allusion to one of the main motives of the
Play. What appears is a truncated line from one of the
choruses, which does not really refer to any main episode,
«
" The curse from the Cretan water." This curse is supposed
to reach Athens by means of the mooring cables of Cretan
ships at the Pirceus.
(8) Is a fragment of another line from one of the choruses
—
" And the cry of Dictynna is still."
(9) Here begins an attempt to give the name "Gilbert";
the reference to a hard g drawing attention to that word of
the otherwise meaningless sentence.
(10) "Only the half, belike, hath fallen on us," is a line
spoken by Phaedra.
(11) The second syllable of "Gilbert" is here misinterpreted
into repeated " buts," and then the whole name takes the form
of "filberts."
(12) " Dictynna's sea-wild eyes" occurs in one of the choruses.
(13, 14) Here are other references to the Cretan curse creep-
ing by the shore-liung cable line.
(15) Is an appro.ximate quotation from a chorus
—
" What joy hath her bridal brought her ?
"
(16) "By the working of my will" is a statement of
Aphrodite concerning the emotion of Phaedra.
(17) Is a reminiscence of the iEneid, -with a change of
gender to make it applicable to Phtedra.
(18) Is an ejaculation of Hippolytus.
(19) Is some vague reminiscence unknown, but the idea of
looking over the sea probably suggests the next sentence.
(20) Ariadne in Naxos, sister of Phtedra, deserted wife of
Theseus.
(21) Is from a song called "Doughty Deeds," suggested by
(22) Hippolytus' contempt for Aphrodite: "I greet her
from afar ;
my life is clean." ^
^The scribe's memory seems to be at fault here. The line is misquoted froui
"If doughty deeds my lady please" (by Robert Cuiininghame-Graham of
Gartmore), the context Iseing :
" Nae maiden lays her skaith to me,
I never loved but you."
Thus the words would apply better to Hippolytus" devotion to Artemis than
to his contempt for Aphrodite.

(23) Was intended and imagined to be a quotation, "Oh
unrighteous Sire," but " bride " has been accidentally miswritten
for " sire
"
—an instance of mere aphasia.
(24, 25) Are quotations ; the first is from Hippolytus'
address to Artemis ; the second—totally disconnected except
as containing the same word—is a false remembrance of a
line in a speech by the Nurse,—-" Mistress, a sharp swift terror
struck me low." Probably the adjectives are misquoted be-
cause of W. S. Gilbert's " short sharp shock " in The Mikado.
(26) Is from a speech of Artemis.
(27) Is part of a line from one of the choruses referring
to the tears of the sisters of Phaeton,
—" Gleams a drop of amber
in the wave."
(28) Is from the introductory declamation of Aphrodite.
(29) The reference both to the Firth and to the Dictionary
is another attempt to give the name " Murray."
Independent Solution of the Imaginary Scripts.
By the PiEv. M. A. Bayfield.
The key to these scripts is Professor Gilbert Murray's
translation of the Hipiiolytus of Euripides.
The passages numbered 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18,
19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27 are quotations from the play (some
exact, and some slightly inaccurate), and distributed as they
are over the three scripts, they make the identification of the
subject unmistakable.
{Scribe A.) The opening words refer to the well-known " one-
horse dawn" experiment; but the words, "no not one," hint at
the Hvo horses of Hippolytus' chariot, and serve to distinguish
the present experiment. " Sandra Belloni " leads up to " the
unseaswept sands " of the Trozen race-course. " Epic Epi
Dorr " is an attempt at " Epidaurus," which is twice mentioned
in the poem, and the sound of the syllable -daur- of Epidaurus
causes the emergence of the name and initials of Mr. G. B.
Dorr. "A murrain on tliee " (Shakespeare ?) looks like an
attempt at " Murray." " Peace after storm " may refer to the
conclusion of the play, but is capable of other allusions.
{Scribe B.) In " 4 gills," etc., we have the first syllable of
" Gilbert " (" only half the word as yet "), and the whole name is
Mat, 1911. Imitation Cross-Correspondence. 79
hinted at by " filberts that is better," since filbert rhymes with
Gilbert. The script now wanders. (13) and (14) refer to a
passage in the play (pp. 39 f.) from which (7) and (15) are
quotations. (17) " fato profugus " (a Virgilian phrase meaning
'
a man exiled by fate ') seems to be intended, by the altera-
tion from profug?/.s into the feminine profugrt, to refer to
Phjedra's fateful fiight with Theseus from Crete. (See the
play, p. 4, middle.)
(Scribe C.) (21), (22), (23) I cannot place; they do not occur
in the poem. The "Mistress" addressed in (24) is Artemis;
that in (25), a misquotation for "Mistress, a sharp swift terror,"
is Phaedra, a distinction pointed out by the script. " To the
far red west" {i.e. far west of Greece) leads up to "Moray
Firth no not the sea," by which the name " Murray " is
suggested ; and this interpretation is confirmed by the words,
" Look for it in the Dictionary," which follow, pointing
apparently to the Dictionary edited by another Dr. Murray.
If these admirably constructed scripts were genuine, they
would no doubt greatly strengthen the evidence for spirit
control in those we have from the autoniatists. Not from the
absence of any duplication of the quotations from the play
—
for that, as I have before contended, might easily happen on
the telepathic hypothesis in a subject of this extent—but
because of the apparently deliberate halving of the name
" Gilbert Murray " between two automatists. If this striking
feature should occur as unmistakably in, say, half-a-dozen real
scripts, it would be highly unreasonable to assign it either to
chance or to any power which—as yet at any rate—we have
any ground for supposing to be possessed by the subliminal
consciousness. But the only genuine cross-correspondences
which present a similar apparently purposive apportionment
are (so far as my memory serves me) the "Ave Eoma Im-
mortalis " case, and the incident in Proc, Vol. XXIV., p. 297,
where a short poem is halved between two automatists, and
even in these cases the evidence of design is not so marked
as in the scripts now before us.
It may be observed that these latter suggest a comparison
{not, however, intended by their author, I believe) with the
imaginary scripts which, as aclvocatns diaboli for the nonce, I
ventured to propound in Proc., Part LXII. If my own scripts
80 Joarnal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9il.
can be considered to represent at all fairly the bulk of the
genuine correspondences—I do not myself think they cover
the whole ground—the obvious contrast between the two
imaginary types may serve to give precision to the point at
issue between the " telepathists " and the " spiritists." Since a
subliminal self can, as we know, communicate to other auto-
matists such simple but suggestive messages as " Ancient
Mariner "—" Hamlet "—" Excalibur," or " cross-bow and alba-
tross "—" spectre ship "—" Alas, poor ghost !
"—" white samite,"
etc., etc., scripts of such a type as that which I offered, loith
complementary features vjhicli vjoald only hy chance he identical,
seem to be easily within the range of telepathy between the
living. On the other hand, such an explanation, though it
might be applied to one or two, would altogether fail to account
for a series of correspondences of Sir Oliver Lodge's type, with
its arbitrary splitting of a composite expression (" Gilbert
Murray"); and in proportion as the genuine correspondences
approach this model, we are gently but surely pushed towards
a belief in the intervention of disearnate spirits. Any alternative
theory would seem to require—if I may borrow a humorous
suggestion of Miss Alice Johnson's—the assumption of periodical
committee-meetings of subliminals.
Supplementary Note bv Sir Oliver Lodge.
On Mr. Bayfield's remark concerning the evidential value
which such an item as the distribution of the names of Gilbert
and Murray would have had in a real case, I suggest that the
names Leo, Harold, Silvia, have actually been distributed among
real scripts (see Proceed inys, Vol. XXII., p. 278).

NOTE ON PAPtT LXII OF " PROCEEDINGS." ^
By F. C. Constable.
Theee would appear to be a general iuipression that those
who refer cross-correspondences to telepathy are in direct
opposition to those who explain them as referable to com-
munication with the disembodied or discarnate. I try to
show that this opposition is not real but apparent.
I think our ordinary definition of telepathy is erroneous
and that the terms, '
subliminal,' '
subliminal consciousness,'
'
subliminal self,' are used very loosely in relation to telepathy :
this possibly is why the general impression referred to exists.
Mr. Podmore is held to be marked above others as relying
on telepathy,—in contradiction to reliance on connnunication
from the disembodied,—for explanation of cross-correspondences.
And, as I have good reason to believe that, had he remained
with us, his work would have been constructive and not
destructive, I try to show that his theory carries us farther
than it is believed to.
Now Mr. Podmore accepted telepathy as a fact of human
experience so, with this assumption, let us consider what con-
clusions follow directly, in human reason, the assumption made.
We may consider, very generally, the abnormal facts involved
in telepathy.
Something happens to B in Australia and A in England
sees what happened. He sees it not subject to the law of
the inverse square. B in Australia says something and A in
1 See Journal for Ajiril, 1911, p. 52.
84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1911.
England hears what is said. He hears it not subject to the
normal law of hearing {not subject we may, roughly, say to
the law of the inverse square), and in neither case is A
affected through his normal organs of sense. Indeed, the
ordinary definition of telepathy infers communication between
man and man otherwise than through the normal organs of
sense.
Now I lind from these inherent ingredients of telepathy
direct proof that the percipient A is a personality 7iot subject
to the law of the inverse square and not conditioned by the
normal organs of sense. For by no possibility can a normal
human personality in England see what takes place in Aus-
tralia : A, a normal human personality, subject to the laws of
(our) space cannot by any possibility see what takes place
thousands of miles distant as clearly and of the same apparent
size as if it were near him. In the same way A, a normal
human personality, cannot hear at a distance beyond the
normal bounds of hearing.
I do not pretend in any way to allege we can determine
(deline the characteristics of) a personality free from the bonds
of the inverse square and free from the limits of the normal
organs of sense. But I do allege we have human experience
of the existence of such personalities,—the facts of telepathy are
explainable only if such personalities exist. We arrive at the
fact of the existence of these personalities, but cannot determine
them, except so far e/s they eire manifest to ns in our universe
of s'pace emd tivie.
1 would suggest, therefore, that telepathy is an expression
for communion Ijetween us as (relatively) spiritual selves,
manifest in communication between ns as normal human beings
through our normal organs of sense. For if there be inter-
course of any kind between A and B, where A and B are
not conditioned by the normal organs of sense, and are not
subject to tlie law of the inverse square (that is, are not
conditioned by the space of our universe), they must be
personalities which, to us, are (relatively) spiritual. Bear in
mind that both Gurney and Myers deny direct transference of
ideas (and feeling) between us as normal human beings : they
refer telepathic effects to impulses on us as normal human
beings which emerge (phenomenally ?) in audible, visual or
June, 1911. Note on Part LXII. of " Proceedings." 85
tactile ideas. Gerald Balfour, also, has pointed out that
the facts of telepathy can only be accounted for by the
existence of the self unconditioned as I have said,—a spiritual
self. And a great scientist—whose name now escapes me—
has said that telepathy is necessarily false because, if true, we
must exist as spiritual selves,—and spiritual selves, he informs
us, do not exist.
With the above definitions of telepathy, and of the mani-
festation to us of telepathic communion (definitions I have
deduced from Kant's reasoning), I think we can consider more
closely the relation between Podmore's theory and those based
on communion with the disembodied.
" With the development of cross-correspondences the problem
became more complicated. In these Mr. Podmore recognizes
the directive action of an intelliijence other than that of the
automatists, but he fails—as others of us have failed—to find
sufficient evidence for believino' the intellioence at work to be
that of a discarnate spirit" {Proceedings, Part LXII., p. 77).
Mr. Podmore, I think, admits the '
directive force of an
intelligence.' But this intelligence uses its directive force free
from the conditioning of soace and of the normal organs of
sense; it is not a normal material intelligence, a subject of
human body and brain and one conditioned in our space. It
is true he denies that the intellis;ence is discarnate, and so
makes it incarnate. But at the same time (for he accepts
telepathy) he makes it use its '
directive force ' free from the
conditioning of its incarnation.
The point I make is this :
—If telepathy be a fact, there
must be communion between personalities unconditioned by
the normal organs of sense and free from the conditioning of
space,—as shown in so-termed cases of clairvoyance. It
follows directly, I suggest, that the communicators (agents and
percipients) must also be unconditioned by the normal organs
of sense and not subject to the .(laws of the) space of our
universe : they must be (relatively) spiritual selves. And from
this (following Gurney and Myers) we find what we term
'
transference of ideas ' must result from this (spiritual) com-
nmnion (these impulses, in Myers's words). The ideas emerge
in the human understanding in phenomenal relation to the
(relatively) noumenal impulses.
86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1911.
The scientist above referred to is reasonable in denying
telepathy because, if telepathy be a fact of human experience,
it proves the existence in each one of us of a (relatively)
spiritual self. Human personalities are no more than partial
and mediate manifestations in our universe of these (relatively)
spiritual selves.
But what bearing has this argument on cross-correspondences ?
I think it has a direct bearinfr.
If we refer back transference of ideas otherwise than through
the normal organs of sense to communion between ourselves
as spiritual selves, we admit this communion between spiritual
selves when incarnate. This, it is true, does not prove the
possibility of communion between the incarnate and the dis-
carnate, but I think it constitutes evidence pointing to such
possibility.
We find, therefore, that those who rely on telepathy do not,
thereby, put the possibility of communion with the disembodied
out of court,—they, on the contrary, open the door for the
admission of evidence of such communion.
If, as I argue at length elsewhere, limits do not disappear
in the limitless, but are suhsumed under it, so that human
knowledge and human memory are not lost to us when dis-
embodied, but merely subsumed under fuller knowledge, fuller
memory, then communion between the embodied and dis-
embodied is possible. How prove it ? Some of us know (or
feel or intuit) the fact, but the knowledge (?) is useless to
others as evidence, for it is outside cognition. How, then,
get human evidence in proof ? I think one method, now
pursued, of trying to find evidence of design, where the design
itself cannot be referred to the embodied, is most hopeful.
Take an extreme, probably impossible, instance. In 1912
five different scripts are obtained which are, each, meaningless
in themselves, but related to one another by internal evidence:
(1) June, (2) 1914, (3) England, (4) Birmingham, (5) Volcano.
The year 1914 arrives, and in June a volcano breaks out
at Birmingham in England. I think in such a case, if the
five scripts were earmarked as from some one disembodied,
many would find definite evidence of communion from the
dead,—there is the evidence of design which originates with
the disembodied.
June, 1911. Note on Part LXIL of " Proceedings." 87
But, assuming there be communion with the disembodied,
the evidential '
script ' is never pure : the communications from
the disembodied can never be more than plums or currants
in a pudding of normal human ideas,—we must have our
Piddingtons and Johnsons for separation. So, even if relying
on design, we must rely also on the cumulative force of
evidence. To prove his law of gravity the falling apple was
not enough for Newton : he had to wait six (fourteen ?) years
to know that the moon imitates the apple.
Eeferring to imitation cross-correspondences Sir Oliver Lodge
says :
—" . . . The writings do not solely represent the uncon-
trolled subliminal meandering of an automatist ;
they do
represent vague and random thoughts coerced or guided into
something like coherence by the action of one purposive in-
telligence " {Journal for April, 1911, p. 56).
With this statement many, perhaps most of us, will agree.
But when Mr. Podmore recognizes '
the directive action of an
intelligence other than that of the automatists,' is he not also
in agreement? I think he is. And the admission (by those
who rely on telepathy) that there is action of one purposive
mind, seems to me to constitute a definite step towards
acceptance of communion with the disembodied.
What we want is cumulative evidence that this purposive
mind is a mind (?) of the disembodied. But I deny that we
ever determine this mind. All we can do is to arrive at
evidence proving its existence,—we can '
know '
it only so far
as manifest in our Lilliputian universe.

CASE.
L. 1184. Dream.
The following case of an apparently telepathic dream was
received through Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of Caius College,
Cambridge, who collected all the evidence concerning it, and
writes on April 16th, 1911:
The following account was written out by myself and signed by
Mrs. Woollacott on October 2iid, 1910, after I had heard her
account of the case. Her husband subsequently wrote to his sister,
Mrs. Hewett, and she writes the letter dated October 4th con-
firming the fact of the accident. Subsequently Miss Poupard wrote on
November 11th an account of her dream, and sent it to Mrs.
88 Joitmal of Society for Psychical Researclt. Juxe, 1911.
Woollacott for me. Miss Poupard also returned the postcard, which
had been sent her from Dubh'n and which was the only communication
she received from Mrs. Woollacott before her visit to Pinner.
If telepathy is present, the evidence suggests Mrs. Woollacott as
the agent, as she was aware of the accident before Miss Poupard's
dream. ^
Mrs. Woollacott's account is as follows :
WooDsiDE, Pinner Hill, Pinner.
I was staying in Kingstown with my sister-in-law, Mrs. Hewett,
from July 29tli to August 20th, 1910. My only communication
while there with Miss G. Poupard was a postcard sent by me, saying,
"We are here. Where are you?" I returned on August 20th, and
on Tuesday, August 30th (or Wednesday 31st), I received from
Mrs. Hewett a letter, saying that my nephew Stanlej', aged 11, had
had a narrow escape from drowning in the swimming baths (on
Tuesda}', August 23rd). As he was getting out up the steps he
slipped and fell back, and had a struggle to get out, not being a
swimmer. No serious results followed.
On September 11th Miss Poupard visited me at my home in-
Pinner, and told us of a curious dream she had had. She had
seen in a dream in the stop-press column of a newspaper my name,
Woollacott. As an unusual name she looked at it and saw that
it referred to me and to my nephews, who seemed to be aged 17
(correct) and 12. In her dream she seemed to be present near a
bridge over some water, and my younger nephew fell into the
water and was drowned. .
Nanette Woollacott.
111 reply to Mr. Woollacott's request for Mrs. Hewett s
testimony, she wrote to him as follows :
Mount Clarence, Kingstown, Co. Dublin, Oct. 4, 1910.
... I really have forgotten near)}' all about Stanley's accident.
He was at the Baths and slipped coming up the steps, and fell into
th(^ deep water, and seems to me to have been saved by a miracle.
He was really more frightened, I think, than anything else, and
looked like death when he managed to get home to me. His friend
William was with him.
This took place about 11.30 in the morning on the Tuesday
following the Saturday Nan went home. I can't remember the date.
It was not in the paper, but similar cases are happening every
day, and there was a case very much like it, only worse, a few
June, 1911. Case. 89
weeks before Nan and the boys were here, which was in the
paper. Only yesterday a clergyman was drowned at Dalkey.
Stanley has not been bathing since
Miss Poupard's account of her dream was as follows
:
41 G-EORGK St., Baker St., W.,
Nov. 11/10.
I had a dream in the first week of September, which impressed
me very much at the time.
In my dream I was reading a newspaper, when the stop-pi'ess
news attracted my attention ; I read that an accident had happened
to one of Mrs. WooUacott's nephews. As I read I seemed to see
the occurrence—the boy appeared to fall from a bridge or other
structure into some water, being either killed in the fall, or
drowned.
The strange part of it was that I had no idea my friend Mrs.
Woollacott had any nephews, yet in my dream there were distinctly
two, their ages being about twelve and seventeen.
The dream was such a vivid one, that I related it to Mrs.
Woollacott when I saw her a week or two later, and to my
astonishment found that an accident practically identical to the one
I described had happened to one of her two nephews.
Gertrude Poupard.
The postcard referred to by Mr. Stratton, addressed by Mrs.
Woollacott to Miss Poupard, was sent to us with the other
papers. It has the postmark "Kingstown, Au. 7, 10."
The following are further questions put by Mr. Strattou to
Mrs. Woollacott, with her answers to them, which were in-
cluded in a letter from her, dated May 8th, 1911:
(1) What letters or messages, if any, passed between you and
Miss Poupard between your return to Pinner and her visit to you"?
Ans. Only an invitation to visit us.
(2) Could the incident at the baths have been mentioned in such
a way as is suggested in the last cpiestion 1 Ans. No.
(3) Did Miss Poupard know any of the Hewetts ? Ans. No.
(4) Is it certain that Miss Poupard told you of her dream before
she heard from you of the accident? Ans. Quite cei'tain.
(5) Did she in particular mention the seeing of the name before
you told her anything? Ans. Yes.
(6) Is it certain that the accident was mentioned in no paper?
Ans. Yes.
90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 191i.
(7) If any one was present when Miss Poupard told you her
dream, can he or she confirm your answers to (4) and (5) 1
Ans. No one present.
The following are questions put by Mr. Stratton to Miss
Poupard, with her answers to them, dated May 10 th, 1911:
(1) Did Miss Poupard know that [Mrs. Woollacott was] staying
with a sister-in-law 1 Ans. I knew that Mrs. AVoollacott was staying
at Kingstown with a relative, but I did not know it was a sister-
in-law.
(2) Can Miss Poupard trace the dream of the accident to any-
thing that she had been reading or hearing 1 Ans. No, I cannot
recall having read or heard of anything likely to lead up to such
a dream.
(3) Has she ever had such a dream or impression before, whether
verified or not? Ans. Yes, I have had some impressive dreams at
different times, but cannot usually recall them in detail, as in the
present case.
CASE OF llECURRENT HALLUCINATIONS ASSOCIATED
WITH ILL-HEALTH.
The following report of a series of hallucinations was com-
municated to us by an Associate of the Society, Mr. Edward
Wight, M.R.C.S., of 9 Eegency Square, Brighton, who writes
concerning it :
Maij 21, 1911.
The old lad3% " Sister Agatha," who writes her experiences, is a
patient of mine, a member of an Anglican sisterhood, and she was
under my care during the time she had the hallucinations in
February of this year. She used to tell me of her " night visitors,"
as she laughingly called them, when I went to see her in the
morning, and when she got stronger I got her to write down the
whole story for me.
I should mention that Sister Agatha is possessed of an eminently
sane, well-balanced mind, as I think you would gather from the
way in which she records her experiences, and her buna-fides is above
reproach. During February last she was suffering from a weak
action of the heart, and as this improved under treatment, her
experiences ceased.
I think the hallucinations are of interest, and perhaps worthy of
record in that
June, 1911. Halhicinatiovs Associated ivitlt lU-Hcaltli. 91
(1) They only occur during ill-health, and always cease when
health improves.
(2) More than one special sense is involved, there being halluci-
nations of sight, hearing, and touch at the same time.
(3) They can all be referred back to definite past impressions on
the mind, and in one or two instances to impressions that had been
forgotten for many years {e.g. the Markham's Hlstoyy illustration
incident).
(4) My patient is never tempted to give them an objective exist-
ence, nor is she frightened or upset by them.
Since February she has been quite free from these experiences, as
her health has improved.
Edward Wight.
" Sister Agatha's " own account of her experiences is as
follows :
I have been asked to note a few cases of hallucination I have
experienced in illness with more or less of fever. They always
occurred at night, and generally after a first sleep or doze.
The first I can remember was when I was about ten years old
(1846) in intermittent fever. I had been made much worse by
the ringing of church bells near me all day, and remember my
head ached badl}' in the evening. I was awaked when it was
dark by something, and saw a M'oman standing by my bed with a
little child in her arms and a basket of flowers in her hand. She
put the child down upon the bed. I don't think I was at all
fiightened.
When I was twenty-five I had a serious two years' illness—an
afi"ection of the upper part of the spine from over-strain in nursing.
I have never completely recovered from this, and over-exertion
always brings on a severe pain, which used to be treated with a
blister at the back of my neck. I mention this because it was after
the pain and its remedy I had my next two experiences. In 1871,
after several days' suffering, a Sister came to me during the evening
to consult me about some refractory girls in her department of the
work. We talked for a long time, and especially of one in whom
I was particularly interested. It was dark when the Sister left me,
but my fire was not quite out. I dozed and was awakened to
vivid consciousness by feeling my bed heaving up in the middle as
if some one was under it. I sat up for a moment and thought of
an earthquake, which had once shaken my bed, but no ! this was
quite a different movement. I looked cautiously over the side of
92 JotLrnal of Society for Psychical Research. June, l9ll.
the bed, and was startled to see the head and shoulders of the girl
\VQ had been talking about emerging from under it, almost witliin
reach of my hand. The red glow of the dying fire showed her to
me distinctly, her sunny hair, rosy cheeks, and snowy cap. She was
looking up at me, and I particularly noticed the shine of the two
jiins with which she fastened the bib of her apron to her
shoulders. I said, " Child, how dare you !
" and as I spoke sprang
past her, and seizing a box of matches from a candlestick on the
mantelpiece, I lighted the candle and a gas jet above it. Then I
turned to face the girl. She was gone. I looked under the bed;
there was no one there, no one in the room. I went to the door ;
it was locked.
The next hallucination was in enteric fever in South Africa, 1886.
The dear friend who was taking care of me and my household
came to say good-night. After she left me I was thinking lovingly
of her devotion and goodness, and must have gone to sleep bless-
ing her name—Marianne Browne, for by and Ijy I awoke to see three
apparitions in turn, each iiaving something to do with the name
Browne. First, there was Brown the carpenter busy at work
planing wood, with his big basket of tools beside him, on the floor
between my bed and the wall, where, in fact, there was hardly
room for a mouse. Then small brown hens were running and peck-
ing about at the other side of my bed.
The third brown thing was, I think, a hare, but I don't distinctly
remember. I know there were three brown apparitions with a doze
between each.
In 1892 or 1893 I had an attack of low fever and extreme weak-
ness of the heart. It was about nine o'clock one evening, and my
fire was fairly good. My bed was at some distance from it in a
rather large room. I had been to sleep, and waked to see a child
al)0ut two j^cars old standing in the ruddy glow between me and
the hearthrug. It had golden curls and a little white garment
falling off its shoulders; its face was towards me. I just said
drowsily " 0, you sweet little thing !
" and went to sleep again. I
awoke atrain with a start to see standing in the middle of the room
the exact counterpart of a figure I remember having seen at school
in one of the illustrations of Mrs. Markham's History of England, a
man in tights, with very long, pointed shoes, the points fastened,
I think, with a button just below the knee. I didn't like this
visitor quite so well as the child, Itut I don't think I was exactly
frightened, and soon went to sleep again.
Juke, I'ju. Hallucinations Associated tvith Ill-Health. 93
The next apparition startled me very much, chiefly, I think,
because it was close to me—a woman bending over me with a
shawl over her head. This may have been the recollection of a real
fright I had when ill with enteric fever in Natal.
A veiled Sister, who paid me a visit during the night, thought I
looked too ghastlj', and bent over me closely to ascertain if I
breathed. I awoke with a terrible start, and I had somewhat of a
return of it with this imaginary person.
In February of this year, 1911, my heart was very weak, and I
had alternate attacks of feverish restlessness and exhaustion. I had
not slept much for several nights when one night I was aroused
out of sleep by hearing a knock at my door. My room is
never perfectly dark, because there is a lamp in the road outside,
which shines a little through the Venetians. I said, " Come in !
"
raising myself to look at the door. As I did so it opened, and a
lady, in black dress, jacket, and hat, walked in. She lield a little
satchel in her right liand, keeping the handle of the half-opened
door in her left. I saw every detail of the dress, face, and figure
distinctly. The face was that of a friend who had lately called
upon me, but the figure and dress were those of a person in the
house. " Who are you ?
" I asked, and receiving no reply, said
rather imperiously "Wait a moment," and, springing out of bed,
lighted a candle on the mantelpiece and then turned I'ound. Tliere
was no one there, and the door was shut.
I put out the candle, went back to bed, and was soon asleep
again.
By and by I opened my eyes and saw my landlady standing close
to me with a pretty little black kitten in her arms. I was not in
the least alarmed until the kitten sprang away, running across the
fender, rattling the fire-irons as she went. I didn't see her do this,
I onlj' heard her.
I did not light my candle this time, and said to myself as I
turned to go to sleep, " I don't suppose there will be anything
more." Almost immediately, as it seemed to me, I opened my eyes
again and saw my dear sister-in-law, who had lately stayed with
me, quietly taking her tea at a little taVjle which usually stands
close to my bedside. It was not there then, but had been used as
a tea table by a caller once. Again the face and figure were of two
different people.
I was quite complacent this time, but was roused again before
long with a violent start. I distinctly felt some one shake me by
94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1911.
the shoulder. I looked up and saw the tSister who had frightened
me so by her nocturnal visit in Natal, 1886, standing near me
with her arms full of branches of yellow flowers, and smilingly
offering a bunch to me. These were the last peoi:)le I saw in this
illness. The next night was rather a lively one, in quite a different
way. Numberless inanimate things took life, or at least motion,
and jumped upon my bed—for instance, a parcel and my coal
scuttle, filled with small but very good and bright-looking coals,
quite different to those I use. These things did not alarm or liurt
me. They only amused me, and I said to myself, as I always do
when I have visitations, "Fever!"
I have now related every incident of the kind that has occurred
in my life of 75 years. They have each one made a vivid impres-
sion upon me that has not faded in the very least ; but they have
never haunted me, indeed never recur to my mind, unless, as has
seldom happened, I have related them to an intimate friend. I
never expect hallucinations, even when I know I am feverish, and
when they come I am never alarmed beyond the occasional first
start. I was laughed at when I told my first childish experience,
so did not mention it again for many years. The next, in 1871,
when I felt the heaving of my bed and saw a figure emerging
from under it, did startle me very much, and I think I should
record my belief that I was spared a shock to my nei'ves then
and a recurrence of nervous fright because I conquered it at once,
in the only possible way, and then put out the lights and composed
myself to sleep. On subsequent occasions I have never kept a
light burning or called any one, or locked a door to save my
nerves, so the nervousness has passed away.
In answer to questions as to the details of the appearances,
and how far they compared in vividness witli the vision of
real objects, Dr. Wight replied :
9 Regency Square,
Brighton, Man 24, 1911.
I put your question to Sister Agatha to-day, and she tells me
that the apparitions are not "outlined in light," or in any way
different from ordinary living figures in appearance, when she sees
them ; but I don't think that she sees real objects in her room at
the same time as the apparition, as far as I can make out. Of
course, in one hallucination she thought she saw her door open
June, 1911. Hallucinations Associated with Ill-Health. 95
after hearing a knock, and before the apparition appeared ; but as
her door did not open, I take it that it was a visualised memory
of her door, and not the real door that she was looking at.
In another hallucination that she records she thought she saw
a friend pouring out tea by her little round table by her bed,
when all the time the table was really in another part of the room.
But it had been by her bed, and she had seen a different friend
pouring out tea by it a little time before. . . .
She tells me that at the time of the apparitions it has never
occurred to her as being curious that she could see them so clearly
in the dark, so though the apparitions are "self-luminous," the
lighting has no abnormal appearance. . . .
Edward Wight.
NOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.
The Journal of AhiGrmad Psychologij, Feb.-March, 1911, contains
several papers bearing on the controversy between the followers of
Freud and those neurologists who have not been convinced of the truth
of Freud's views. Dr. Morton Prince's article on Dreams, referred to
in the Notes on Current Periodicals in this Journal, January, 1911,
has brought forth some remarks from Dr. Ernest Jones, which are
replied to by Dr. Prince. Dr. Jones formally denies that there is in
Dr. Prince's article any evidence that he employed psycho-analysis
at all. He says that the material that Dr. Prince offers as the
result of his studies, and which he terms the latent content of the
dreams, is of a kind that ever}' psycho-analyst will recognise as
belonging to the first stages of any investigation into the sources
of dreams, but which is cfuite unlike the latent content as revealed
by psycho-analysis. Yet Dr. Jones accepts Dr. Prince's confirmation
of "a part, and by no means the least important part, of Freud's
theory of dreams." Dr. Prince, in his reply, points out that the
correctness of this confirmation depends entirely upon whether he
had discovered the true underlying dream-thoughts. If he did
discover these, then his psycho-analysis was sufficient; if he did not
discover them his interpretations are valueless and should not be
claimed as confirming Freud's views.
Dr. Prince says that his investigation was not undertaken in
order to test the validity of the Freud metliods, but in order to
study the psychology of di'eams. He desired to make use of any
and every method that might help in obtaining data from which
96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, I9il.
sound conclusions could be drawn, and he still thinks that his
interpretations of the dreams were logically sound and justified,
Avhether he employed Freud's method or not.
Dr. Jones says that "up to the present no one who has taken
the trouble to acquire the psycho-analytic method has failed to
confirm Freud's theory in all essential particulars." Dr. Prince re-
torts :
" No one who has shown by his writings that he is thoroughly
trained in and conversant from first-hand knowledge M'ith all the
phenomena of abnormal, experimental and functional psychology has
accepted Freud's theory."
Dr. A. Friedlander, of Frankfort, contributes a paper on Hysteria
and Modern Paycho-analysis, in which he gives a useful review of the
opinions of many continental workers both for and against Freud's
views. He also points out the harmful results which follow when
scientific views are proclaimed to the world as established facts
before thej' are tested and discussed by specialists in their special
journals and periodicals. Such unwarranted popularisation, of which
some of Freud's followers have been guilty, causes harm to the
patients, to the science, and to the representatives of the new
doctrine.
In tlie April-May, 1911, number of the same peiiodical there is
a short abstract of Dr. Savage's Harveian Oration on Experimental
FsydiAiliKjy and Hyjmotism, delivered before the Eoyal College of
Physicians of London on October 18, 1909. The reviewer says "Dr.
Savage's oration is of interest to American science, not because the
address makes a substantial contribution to our knowledge of experi-
mental psychology or of hypnotism, but because it may be regarded
as indicative of the stage of development psychotherapy has
attained in Great Britain." He concludes that "the condition of
psychotlieiajjy in Great Britain, judged by this oration, is nothing
short of deplorable. It is not that Di'. Savage is not sincere and
open-minded enough. The difficult}' is with the rank and file of
the profession, who are so conservative that a Harveian oration must
degenerate into a plea that scientific men should not reject new truth,
simply because it is new. May his sincerity fertilise the sterile
soil upon which he has strewn rather unpromising seed !

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
The 36th Private Meeting of the Society for Members and
Associates only was held in the Council Chamber at 20
Hanover Square, London, W., on Friday, July 7th, 1911, at
4 p.m. ; Sir Oliver Lodge in the chair.
Mrs. A. W. Verrall read a paper on " Cross-correspondence
as a Vehicle for Literary Criticism," of which the following
is an abstract
:
Assuming that tlie evidence previously presented (in Pro-
ceedings) has established the existence—at least in certain cases
of purposive supplementary cross-correspondence—of intelligent
direction of the phenomena of concordant automatism, this
paper is an attempt to determine some characteristics of the
directing intelligence. If, as was suggested by Miss Johnson
in a paper read in March last (and now published in
Proceedings, Part LXIIL), this intelligence contains a factor
not identifiable with the subliminal self of any one of the
automatists, though acting in concert with their minds, the
discovery of its characteristics might carry us a step further
by affording means of comparison with the known character-
istics of the automatists concerned. Such an intelligence,
however, manifested through the memories and associations of
the automatists, is thereby conditioned, and some similarity
of mental processes may be necessary for the successful pro-
duction of the phenomena. Still, if there is present in the
intelligence a factor not identifiable with any of the living
human factors with which it is combined, it is reasonable to
look for evidence of its possession of individual tastes,
interests, or capacity,—for evidence, in short, of idiosyncrasy or
personality.
For this purpose in this paper the phenomena of cross-
correspondence are isolated from all their accompaniments, and
Jolt, 1911. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 99
an examination is made, not of the methods used in the
several scripts for the emergence of the transmitted topic, but
of the actual topics chosen for transmission.
Literary topics are numerous ; five cases are examined in
detail.
(1) Mjytunes Trident. {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV. p. 177.)
This topic, originally emerging in Mrs. Piper's trance as one of
several appropriate reminiscences of the Aeneid provoked by
Mr. Dorr's reading of the opening lines of Book I., was spon-
taneously selected by Myersp as the subject of a cross-
correspondence. It had in fact appeared some sixteen days
earlier in Miss Verrall's script. The cross-correspondence is of
the simple kind ;
intelligence is shown in the choice of a topic
already associated by the control with a literary knowledge not
possessed by the automatist through whom the choice was
made.
(2) The Invocation to Sahrina in Milton's " Comus." (Pro-
ceedings, Part LXIII. p. 253.) A few lines from this were
read by Mr. Dorr to Myersp, who accepted Mr. Dorr's sug-
gestion to use the subject for cross-correspondence. The second
line appeared in Mrs. Holland's script, not long after Miss
Verrall's script had contained a paraphrase of the concluding
portion of the invocation, which had not been read to Mrs.
Piper. Here the cross-correspondence is supplementary, and
the complete correspondence shows a knowledge of the context
of the passage originally selected.
(3) Sesame and Lilies. {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV. p. 264.) A
cross-correspondence on Euskin's Sesame and Lilies was found
to occur between the scripts of some new experimenters, Mr.
and Miss Mac on the one hand, and on the other of Mrs. and
Miss Verrall, a comparison between whose scripts had already
led to the detection of an incomplete cross-correspondence on
tliat subject. Both sets of scripts contained allusions unintel-
ligible to the automatists, but subsequently found to be
appropriate and to show an acquaintance with Euskin's works
exceeding that consciously possessed by them.
(4) French Poems. {Proceedings, Part LXIII. p. 320.) A
double and partly supplementary cross-correspondence on a
French poem, each of its two stanzas being combined with a
second topic—a rose—unconnected with the poem, was produced
100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, I9ii.
between the scripts of Miss Verrall, and of Mr. and Miss Mac.
The poem, " La vie est breve," was known to the automatists
concerned. "With both parts of the cross-correspondence were
associated allusions to other French poets : the Mac script
alluded to a poem by Malherbe, the H.V. script referred to
Gautier and Hugo as presenting comparable types. This state-
ment, at the time unintelligible, was explained by the subsequent
discovery of two poems, unknown to the automatists, by Hugo
and Gautier respectively, which are appropriately combined
in the one script with the double topic of the cross-corre-
spondence which, in the other, had been associated with
Malherbe. Thus the French poem, which was the subject of a
cross-correspondence, was accompanied by allusions to parallel
literary passages outside the range of the automatists' reading.
(5) Criticism of Rcnan. This case will, it is hoped, shortly
be published. It may be briefly summarised thus : A cross-
correspondence between the scripts of Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.
Willett led to the discovery of an inaccuracy in Eenan's
account of the vision of St. Paul. Neither script alone was
intelligible ; Mrs. Verrall's drew attention to " what Eenan
wrote " about St. Paul's vision : Mrs. Willett's two days later
gave instructions to send to Mrs. Verrall the words " Eikon
Eenam (sic)." Kenan's account was unknown to both automatists,
but reference to his book, Zes Apotres, showed that his
rationalistic explanation depends on the seeing by St. Paul of
a visual image, an " Eikon," which is not asserted in the
narrative of Acts, upon which Eenan bases his statement.
From the examination of these five cases, it would seem
that one characteristic of the intelligence directing the cross-
correspondence is a wide and deep interest in literature, the
authors laid under contribution being Virgil, Milton, Euskin,
Gautier, Hugo, Eenan. To none of the automatists were all
the selected passages known ; to all the automatists some
were unknown ; in one case was shown not merely knowledge
of recorded facts, but literary judgment. If the directing
intelligence is to be identified with the subliminal activities
of the automatist, it must be credited with the power of
producing an original criticism of a subject, in which the
normal personality took no particular interest, contained in a
book which the normal personality had never read.
July, 1911. Notes on Part LXIII. of " Froceedings." 101
NOTES ON PART LXIII. OF " PROCEEDINGS."
We print below information and suggestions which have been
sent to us by members of the Societj' on the literary sources
of various passages in the scripts published in the last part
of Proceedings. Any one who studies these scripts with care
will recognise that they do not by any means give a full
representation of the ideas existing at the time in the mind
of the automatist and which are emerging, through the writing,
partially and indirectly, and sometimes in a curiously veiled
and symbolic form. The attempt to discover as far as we
can what is the complete idea which is struggling to emerge
may be compared with the methods of " psycho-analysis " used
by Dr. Freud and his school to discover the hidden feelings
and lapsed memories of their patients, —the ideas which are
dominant in their minds. " These psycho-analytic procedures
(writes Dr. Mitchell ^) are the most delicate instruments of
psychical diagnosis which we at present possess
;
" but he
points out that the procedures are diagnostic, rather than
curative. Somewhat similarly, our elaborate analyses of the
quotations and allusions to literary topics in the scripts, which
may no doubt to many readers appear over-elaborated and
tedious, are directed in the first instance to finding out the real
thoughts of the intelligence guiding the script, irrespective of
the question of what that intelligence is.
Willett Scripts of February, 1910.
(p. 123) Haggi Babha. Mr. C. A. Goodhart suggests that
the phrase in Mrs. Willett's script of February 4, 1910,
" There was the door to which I found no key and Haggi
Babba too," may refer to an episode in Chapter V. of James
Morier's " The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan." In this
story Hajji Baba, the son of a celebrated barber of Ispahan,
being taken prisoner by the Turcomans, is forced to assist
them to invade his native city. Reaching the gate of the
royal caravanserai, he finds it locked, and the door-keeper
refuses to open till he gives his own name, pretending that
he is a messenger come to announce the return of Hajji Baba
1 ProeeecZm<;s, Vol. XXIV. p. 678.
102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, I9ll.
with a caravan. He thus effects an entry for the phmdering
Turcomans. The incident is referred to again in Chap. XLIX.
where the door-keeper speaking to Hajji, of whose part in
the affair he is ignorant, remarks :
" It was on account of
your name, which the dog's son made use of to induce me
to open the gate, that the whole mischief was produced."
This passage in Mrs. Willett's script was interpreted as
relating to the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, in
which " Sesame " was the magic word that caused the door
to open ; for there are undoubted references in the same script
to the cross-correspondence " Sesame and Lilies." It is also
connected with the pun on Mr. Dorr's name. But there may
possibly be a further reference, as suggested by Mr. Good-
hart, to this adventure of Hajji Baba's, where the only key
he possessed to the gate of the caravanserai was his own name.
(p. 123) "The shining souls, shining by the river brim."
Miss Dallas writes
:
When reading Mrs. Willett's script of Feb. 4, 1910, I have been
struck by a close resemblance between the ideas in that script from
the words, "the shining souls," etc., to "Peak," and the ideas in
Cantos XXX. and XXXI. of the Paradiso. I can best show what
seems to me to be the connection by supposing that the thoughts
of the control from this point ran in some such sequence as the
following
:
The word " Lethe " suggests not only the passage in the Aeneid
where the river is named, but also Cantos XXX. and XXXI. of the
Paradiso, because in the latter Dante borrows the imagery of Virgil
and applies it in a slightly different connection.
Whilst Virgil speaks of troops of ghosts fluttering as in meadows
on a serene summer day, when the bees sit on various blossoms
and swarm around snow-white lilies, all the plain buzzing with their
humming noise, and tells us that they quaff' the streams of
oblivion, Dante tells us of angehc spirits who issue from a river not
of oblivion but of light, and describes them as "living sparks,"
dropping "on every side into the blossoms, like rubies set in gold"
(Canto XXX.).
These "shining souls, shining by the river brim" are in the next
canto (XXXI. 7) compared to bees among the flowers. Thus " the
pain forgotten " is not the only appropriate thought called up by
the mention of the .river of Lethe ; there is " another connection,"
Jolt, 1911. Notes on Part LXIII. of " Proceedings."
which cannot perhaps be fully given, but which can be indicated in
certain words.
One of these is the word " Rose." Immediately before Dante
uses the comparison of the angels with bees, he speaks of the
Church triumphant under the symbol of a white rose, "adorned
with so many leaves " {i.e. souls of the blessed) ;
these souls are
visited by ascending and descending angels, " che volando vede."
The memory of these cantos naturally leads on to the thought of
"Love the essential essence," for these cantos form the climax of
the whole Divine Comedy, of which the theme is Love, human love
leading up to and becoming one with the Divine. Careful con-
sideration of Dante's prayer and thanksgiving to Beatrice (XXXL
79-90) will show the appropriateness of the reference to Tennyson's
lines :
"Love's too precious to be lost,
A little grain shall not be spilt."
After a pause in the script comes the exclamation, " Darien the
Peak peak PEAK."
Is there anything in Canto XXXI. which could naturally have
led to this reference to Keats' sonnet, " On first looking into
Chapman's Homer'"? I think that there is. Canto XXXI. closes
with a description of the Mount of Paradise. Dante is bidden to
" look upon the circles, even to the remotest," and doing so he sees
the summit of the mountain aglow, and " on this side and on that
the light is shorn away, so was that pacific oriflamme quickened in the
midst, on either side in equal measure tempering its flame." In
other words he sees a perfect peak at the summit of the mountain.
The words " pacifica oriafiamma " may suggest a connection with
" Stout Cortez—when with eagle eyes
He stared at the Pacific—and all his men
Look'd at each other with a wild surmise
Silent, upon a peak in Darien."
But the connection is more than a connection in the sound of
words. Both Dante and Cortez were entering upon a new experience,
and a new world of life.
Myers urges that the occasion should be noted, " Let him remember
the occasion" (p. 12-1). The silence of the followers of Cortez finds
a correspondence in the Paradiso, for we are told that Dante did
not dare to try to express the delightsomeness of the vision which
he saw. '
.
• -
Whether or not I am correct in supposing that these cantos of
104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1911.
the Paradiso suggested the allusions in the script, it is certain that
the script has suggested to me the passages in the Paradiso ; and
this may perhaps be an argument in favour of the correctness of
my interpretation.
H. A. Dallas.
The river alluded to by Miss Dallas was seen by Dante in
the highest of the heavenly spheres as " a light, in river form,"
which, after he had bathed his eyes in it,
''
into roundness
seemed to change its length." This is interpreted ^ as the
stream of Time, afterwards seen in its true shape as the circle
of Eternity. It has no connection with the Lethe which flows
through the Earthly Paradise on the Mount of Purgatory,
Dante's crossing of which is described in Furgatorio XXXI.
See Mrs. Verrall's comments (pp. 214-217) on the absence of
any allusion to Dante's Lethe in the Willett scripts, and the
supplying of this omission in her own script of Feb. 15,
1910.
(p. 124) "Not spilt like water on the ground."
Miss A. E. Marten tells us that there is a hymn,^ the second
verse of which is
:
" Not spilt like water on the ground,
Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,
Not wandering in unknown despair.
Beyond Thy Voice, Thine Arm, Thy Care
;
Not left to lie like fallen tree,
Not dead, but living unto Thee."
The repetition of " Not—not " in the script a few words after
the quotation is a further confirmation of this source.
(p. 149) "Which only I remember, which only you forget."
This was interpreted by Mrs. Verrall (see p. 206) as an
allusion to the refrain of Swinburne's Itylus. Miss Verrall
observes that a closer verbal parallel is to be found in Christina
Eossetti's poem, " One sea-side Grave," as follows
:
" Unmindful of the roses,
Unmindful of the thorn,
A reaper tired reposes
Among his gathered corn :
So might I till the morn.

.. ,
.". Cold as the cold Decembers,
Past as the days that set,
While only one remembers
: And all the rest forget,
—
But one remembers yet."
In reference to this suggestion, Mrs. Verrall writes :
I do not think that the quotation from C. Rossetti—with which
I was not acquainted—is a certain source of the Willett script, though
it may have contributed. Note in the first place that the name
Swinburne emerges immediately after the " remember . . . forget,''
and that the two following allusions to his poems greatly add to
the likelihood of its being a poem of Swinburne's that suggested the
" remember . . . forget."
Again, the C. Rossetti poem does not (like Itylus) give the con-
trast between / and rjou, but only between "one" and "the rest."
On the other hand, the rhythm of the script is that of the
Rossetti poem, and I think a recollection of this poem may have
influenced the script ; but I think there is much more evidence that
Swinburne's poem was intended than C. Rossetti's. I considered and
rejected another poem of C. Rossetti's ^ on the ground that auf
Swinburne aut nulhis was indicated by the script, since the passage
is on the face of it ascribed to him, and it reproduces the double
contrast between persons (first and second) and actions (remember
and forget) which he makes in Itylus.
Holland Script of Nov. 10, 1909.
(p. 241) "Oh singer of Persephone from the far meadows
desolate—Hast thou forgotten Sicily ?
"
Miss Edith Moggridge tells us that this phrase is clearly
derived from the first three lines of a villanelle by Oscar Wilde,
called " Theocritus," which opens thus
:
" 0 singer of Persephone !
In the dim meadows desolate.
Dost thou remember Sicily ?
"
Miss Moggridge adds that a phrase occurring later in the
same script
:
" The torture of the whirling wheel wherein the power of the
philter lay
'
^ Song, "When I am dead, my dearest."
106 Journal of Society for Psycltical Researclt. July, 1911.
seems to be connected with the third triplet of the same
villanelle
:
" Simaetha calls on Hecate
And hears the wild dogs at the gate
;
Dost thou remember Sicily?"
since this refers to Theocritus, Idyll 11. 30,
" And as whirls this brazen wheel, so restless . . . may he turn
and turn about my doors. My magic wheel, draw home to me
.
the man I love !
" ^
The last sentence is the refrain of the Idyll.
Simaetha is a girl who, deserted by her lover, is using the
charm of the whirling wheel to bring him back. In this charm
a wry-neck was attached to the wheel and whirled round with
it, it being supposed that the effect produced on the bird was
transferred to the faithless lover.
The discovery of this connection with Theocritus throws a
certain doubt on the interpretation of the script offered in
Proceedings, as alluding to Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone.
It seems not unlikely, however, that Mrs, Holland had botli
poems in mind, and so produced a sort of composite represen-
tation of them. Two further points may be noted: (1) "The
dim meadows desolate " of 0. Wilde's poem are the Elysian
fields, which brings Mrs. Holland's script into closer connection
with Miss Verrall's quoted on the same page ; (2) Mrs.
Holland's misquotation :
" Hast thou forgotten Sicily ?
" seems
intended to express that contrast between memory and forget-
fulness which was shown to be an item in this complex of
cross-correspondences {op. cit. pp. 271 and 286).
Omar Khayyam.
In regard to the allusions to Omar Khayyam in Mrs.
Verrali's "Note on the Cross-Correspondence 'Cup'" (pp.
304-19), Miss Lucy M. Corry points out that for some of those
in Mrs. Piper's script closer parallels are to be found in the
fourth edition of the poem than in the hrst edition, with
which alone Mrs. Verrall has compared them. Myersp's phrase
(p. 310), "No man ever came back from whence he has gone
to tell us of the shore," suggests Stanza LXIV. (fourth edition) :
1 Translation liy Andrew Lang
—
Theocritus, Bion and Moschm (Golden
Treasury Ed. p. 13).
July, 1911. Notes on Part LXIII. of Proceedings." 107
" Strange, is it not 1 that of the myriads who
Before us pass'd the door of Darkness through
Not one returns to tell us of the Road,
Which to discover we must travel too."
This stanza does not occur in the first edition, but seems
closer to Myersp's sentence than the stanza quoted by Mrs.
Verrall on p. 311.
Again, the phrase " the wine of life," used by Hodgsonp
(p. 309), occurs in Stanza VIII. of the fourth edition, which
is missing from the earlier editions.
Oa the other hand, the word " Dawn," mentioned by
Hodgsonp in this connection (p. 309), which occurs in the
second stanza of the first edition, quoted by Mrs. Verrall, does
not occur in the description of the sunrise as given in the first
two stanzas of the fourth edition.
Miss Corry suggests that the phrase " Persian Garden
"
used in these Piper sittings (pp. 307-8) is probably derived
from the cantata by Liza Lehmann on selected stanzas
from the Eubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, called " In a Persian
Garden."
CASE.
L. 1185. Dream.
The following case of a veridical dream was received through
Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of Caius College, Cambridge. Dr. E. G.
Markham, now Assistant Medical Officer of Health at Burnley,
gives an account of his dream as follows
:
April 30th, 1911.
During the night of Dec. 5th, 1909, I had a dream which was so
peculiar as to impress itself on my memorj', and the next morning
I mentioned it to the people with whom I was staying at the time,
and also the same day wrote to my fiancie, and told her to remind
me, on the following day, to narrate it to her, but gave her no
particulars.
As far as I can now remember, the dream was as follows
:
A physician. Dr. L., and I were standing at a bedside. I
recognised the patient to be a certain Nurse W. who was at that
[time] a nurse at the Prince of Wales's General Hospital, Tottenliam.
The Doctor, after examining her chest, asked me to do so as well,
and then asked my opinion about the disease present, stating that
108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, I9li.
he himself thought that she was suffering from heart disease, but
certain other signs suggested more serious mischief.
During my residence at this hospital, this particular nurse had
always been considered as one of the strongest, and it was this fact
that impressed the dream on my memory. The next day, Dec. 7th,
I met my fiande and narrated the dream to her, and to my astonish-
ment found that the nurse about whom I had dreamt had actually
been examined and advised to leave the hospital.
R. G. Markham.
Miss Wilson, now Mrs. Markham, writes as follows
:
, The Prince of Wales's General Hospital,
Tottenham, Man, 1910.
As far as my memory permits, the following are facts concerning
a dream and an actual occurrence :
On Dec. 7th, 1909, I received a letter from Dr. Markham, in
which he stated that he had had a peculiar dream, and that he
specially wanted to tell me about it. We met on the same after-
noon, and I then reminded him about the dream. It was to this
effect :
—He dreamt that he was standing by the bedside of Nurse W.
(a nurse at above hospital, well known to us both), and that the
Senior Physician, Dr. L., was examining her chest.
At the conclusion of his examination, the Physician turned to
Dr. Markham and said :
" Yes, there is certainly some heart trouble there, and, in my
opinion, something else even more serious, as there are all the
symptoms one would expect to find from a growth in that neighbour-
hood."
Dr. Markham then remarked to me how singular it seemed that he
should have dreamed of that particular nurse, as she was apparently
one of the strontjest and most robust of all the nurses. When he
had finished telling me of his dream, I said :
" How very strange,
for Nurse W. is ill and has been sent off duty, and has actually
been examined by Dr. L. He has expressed his opinion that her
illness is due to heart trouble, and requires that she shall be
X-rayed, as he suspects a growth also, somewhere in the chest."
The dates, as far as I can ascertain, are :
I received the letter from Dr. Markham Dec. 7th, 1909.
I met him on the same afternoon, Dec. 7th, 1909.
Dr. L. saw Nurse W. on Dec. 3rd, 1909.
Nurse W. finally left hospital about Dec. 12th, 1909.

DE. VAN EENTERGHEM ON THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN.
By T. W. Mitchell, M.D.
An interesting address by Dr. van Renterghem of Amsterdam
on " The Rehabilitation of the Family Physician," is reported
in the Transactions of the Psycho-Medical Society, Vol. II., Part I.
The subject of Dr. van Eenterghem's discourse is one wliich he
believes to be of great importance to physicians and to the
public. He points out that within recent times there has been
a diminution of the esteem in which the medical profession is
held by the public. He examines the causes that have led to
this evil, which more especially affects the general practitioner,
and he proposes a remedy.
He says that at the present day the general practitioner has
to fight for his very existence against the encroaching army of
specialists and a growing horde of quacks and charlatans. He
thinks specialism tends to produce a class of men who are
wanting in that broad outlook on life and disease which was
so characteristic of the great physicians of former times, and
he is not surprised that the specialist often fails to cure the
patients who consult him. But a patient who finds that the
specialists can do nothing for him is apt to lose all faith in
official medicine and soon drifts into the hands of the charlatan
or faith-healer. Not infrequently these succeed where the
specialist has failed. According to Dr. van Renterghem the
specialist's failure in these cases is due to his ignorance or
neglect of the mental aspects of the disorders which he has
been called upon to treat, and the success of the charlatan is
due to psychical influences consciously or unconsciously employed.
He believes that suggestion, direct or indirect, is the curative
agency in all these cases, and he puts forward a strong plea
for such a reform of medical education as would ensure that
110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, jply, I9li.
every qualified practitioner should have had adequate instruc-
tion in the principles and practice of psychotherapeutics. The
man who has been vioil grounded in medical psychology, and
has a practical knovfledge of psychotherapy in its various forms,
will thereby be better armed against the difficulties of his
profession, and will be able to replace the marvels of quackery
by good and solid cures produced by conscious suggestion. In
this way Dr. van Kenterghem thinks the medical profession
may regain the place in the public esteem which it occupied
in former times.
In the course of his address Dr. van Eenterghem gives an
interesting account of his own career. He tells how he took
up the study of Hypnotism after reading Beaunis' La Sovi-
namhulismc Provoqu4. This work excited his interest so much
that he decided to go to Nancy to study under Liebeault. On
his return he made extensive use of hypnotism in his practice for
some months, and then, in conjunction with Dr. van Eeden, set
up as a psychotherapeutic specialist in Amsterdam. He describes
the changes of method which he found necessary in the course
of his experience of nervous patients, and gives an account of
the various psychotherapeutic pi^ocedures which he makes use
of at the present time. In many cases he finds that sugges-
tion alone is not sufficient, but has to be supplemented by
moral treatment, re-education, and the treatment known as
psycho-analysis.
Dr. van Eenterghem is perhaps over sanguine as regards the
possibility of restoring to the family physician his old status
by means of the reform of medical education which he recom-
mends, but his address as a whole is well worthy of perusal
by all who are interested in psychotherapeutics. Medical men
who are ignorant -
of the applications of suggestion as a cura-
tive agent will find here a good introduction to this subject.
EEVIEW.
Beligion and Immortality. By G. Lowes Dickinson. (J. M.
Dent & Sons, London, 1911. pp. 88. Price Is. net.)
This little book, the third of a series by the same author,
entitled Modern Problems, contains three essays, two of which have
already appeared in the Hihhert Journal, while the third, " Is
Immortality Desirable 1 " was the Ingersoll Lecture delivered at
July, 1911. Revietv. Ill
Harvard University in 1909. The circumstances of its production
have involved some degree of repetition in the arguments of the
book, but there is a coherent thread running through the whole,
which naturally gives a more lucid and complete presentation of
Mr. Dickinson's philosophical position than can be gathered from
any of the essays separately, while his writings must always be
read with pleasure for their style, even by those who are not
altogether in sympathj' with his line of thought.
The subject matter of the book is not, of course, one with which
psychical research is directly concerned, but it is interesting to see
how strongly the author is influenced by the root ideas that have
always inspired it. In his first essay, on "Faith and Knowledge,"
he observes that the leaders of free thought seem now to be both
more sceptical and more believing than they used to be ;
they
question more and they affirm more. The Positivism adopted by
their predecessors is now seen to be not a science, but a
philosophy, and a philosophy as little established, as open to
question, as any other. " Our knowledge, it may be admitted, is
liut a flickering lamp sheltered by a paper shade from the winds
of infinite space .... our experience is limited by our senses and
by the structure of our mind ; and we have no philosophy that is
demonstrably true." Does it follow that we need preserve an
attitude of pure agnosticism ? Of such an attitude Mr. Dickinson
says, " If it gives no light or inspiration, neither does it foster
superstitions or dreams. It is a shining brazen rampart against
the tides of human credulity." Nevertheless, it is not a desirable
attitude, even for the chosen spirits of mankind, for it tends to
stop all growth—Imagination being defined by the writer as a
principle of growth. He explains further that he means by
imagination "a tentative apprehension, not caring much about the
intellectual forms in which it finds expression, but caring very
much about the substance with which it imagines it comes into
contact"; and he maintains that modern free thinkers are charac-
terised by this imagination, or faith, though they are not satisfied
with any of the traditional forms of religion. He tries to formulate
something of the content of a faith that will satisfy them. "It
must (he says) be one which brings them into some kind of
friendly relation to the universe. . . . They must feel that human
life and human purposes .... contribute to and express some-
thing of [the] essence [of the cosmic process]." Then comes the
question whether individuals have, as a matter of fact, any cosmic
significance save as a means to something else. This question
either cannot be answered at all, "or it can only be answered by
science ; and in that case the only method to pursue is that which
is being pursued, in the face of much discouragement from men of
science, by the Society for Psychical Eesearch."
To this point, the question of the significance of the individual,
he returns in his second essay, on "Optimism and Immortality."
Optimism, the conviction that life is worth living, seems instinctive
in most men, but we cannot assume that they will continue
112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, l9il.
indefinitely to hold it. Nor have they always held it in the past.
At the beginning of the Christian era the Western world passed
through a crisis. "Not one man or two, here and there, but
many men everywhere, were asking that fatal and terrible
question, —Why 1 the question that, once it makes itself heard,
shatters like a trump of doom the society that cannot give it an
answer. Roman society had no answer ; and if the West was
redeemed, it was only by an influx of barbarians whose brutal
passion for life was unable even to understand the question asked
by the great civilisation they destroyed." Mr. Myers suggested
the same parallel between that era and the present age ^ that Mr.
Dickinson goes on to draw, though he did not attribute its
redemption to the same cause. Mr. Dickinson discusses what hypo-
theses we ought logically to be able to accept if we are to justify
optimism to our reason, and prominent among these he places the
conviction of the importance of the individual. Optimism involves
a belief in the ultimate triumph of good on the whole. But the
doctrine of general i)rogress, so prevalent in the eighteenth century,
finds too little support in actual experience to hold the field. We
see that gains are often counter-balanced by losses, and it is hard to
estimate the result. Even the conception of progress, so long as it
is confined to the race and ignores the individual, ceases to satisfy
our ethical needs. " Optimism (says Mr. Dickinson) is doomed unless
we can believe that there is more significance in individual lives
than appears upon the surface." It is necessary then that science
should lay aside its prejudices, and consider with an open mind all
evidence which may seem to bear on the question of survival after
death.
The third essay, "Is Immortality Desirable'?" was noticed in the
Journal (for June, 1909) when it was first published. Mr. Dickinson
maintains that the question is a practical one, which has a direct
bearing on the pursuit of positive knowledge ; for unless men think
it really important to know the truth, they will neither pursue it
themselves nor encourage those who do. He endeavours to show
that there is a kind of immortality which, if it were a fact, would
be a very desirable one, and he pleads for a serious consideration of
the evidence offered on this subject by the Society, especially that
contained in the automatic scripts produced during the last few
years.
The book culminates in a kind of epilogue, written in the poetic
prose in which Mr. Dickinson excels, called " Euthanasia : being
Lines from the Note-book of an Alpinist." The Alpinist, or
philosopher, who seems to sum up the whole thought of the book,
records his impressions, first "in the hut," and finally "on the
summit": "I could not see the god, but I heard the music; and,
hearing it, I overcame fear."

OBITITAEY.
Lieutenant-Colonel G. L. Le Mesurier Taylor.
By the death of Leutienant-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor on
October 5th, the Society has lost an old and faithful member
—
one much interested in its work, and who has himself con-
tributed not a little in various ways to its progress. Colonel
Taylor joined the Society very early, and in 1888 became a
member of the Finance Committee, on which he continued to serve
till his death. He was elected a member of the Council in 1901,
and was a most regular attendant until his health began to fail.
But Colonel Taylor's services were not confined to administra-
tive work ;
they were always at the disposal of the Society for
investigations, and he wrote excellent reports, most careful and
methodical, on the cases he looked into. Readers of the Pro-
ceedings and Journal are acquainted with some of these, but
there are many more in the archives of the Society, which,
giving negative or inconclusive results, have been relegated to
oblivion with the cases to which they refer. He also himself
assiduously collected cases whicli have appeared from time to
time in the Journal and Proceedings. His most important piece
of original work in connexion with psychical research is an
" Experimental Comparison between Chance and Thought-Trans-
ference in Correspondence of Diagrams," which was published
in Proceedings, Vol. VI. The experiment was well devised and
carried out, and the recorded result is of permanent value.
Colonel Taylor inclined strongly to spiritistic hypotheses,
though he kept an open mind, and he had himself in a private
circle witnessed striking instances of movements of objects ap-
parently without contact. He gave an account of some of these
and of other experiences in a paper published in Proceedings,
Vol. XIX., under the title " Report on Various Spiritualistic
Phenomena." He for a long time has kept careful notes of
the trance speaking of a friend of his, Mrs. Home, who
was one of the autoniatists concerned in the cross-corre-
spondences centring round " seven," of which an account was
given in Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.
Colonel Taylor's genial and sympathetic presence at business
meetings and social gatherings will be much missed by his
colleagues in psychical research.
Oct., 1911. Confessions of a " Telepathist." 115
CONFESSIONS OF A "TELEPATHIST."
We think that those of our members who do not regularly
see the Daily News may be interested in reading the follow-
ing articles and letters, concerning some early experiments of
the Society, which appeared in tliat paper during September.
We therefore, with the kind permission of the Editor of the
Daily News, reproduce them here. It may be remarked that
this is not the first time Mr. Blackburn has published his
so-called " Confession." He wrote similar articles in John Bull
in 1908-9 and now returns to the charge. He writes in
the Daily News of Sept. 1st, 1911:
For nearly thirty years the telepathic experiments conducted by
Mr. G. A. Smith and myself have been accepted and cited as the
basic evidences of the truth of Thought Transference.
Your correspondent " Inquirer " is one of many who have pointed
to them as a conclusive reply to modern sceptics. The weight
attached to those experiments was given by their publication in
the first volume of the proceedings of the Society for Psychical
Research, vouched for by Messrs. F. W. H. Myers, Edmund Gurney,
Frank Podmore, and later and inferentially by Professor Henry
Sidgwick, Professor Romanes, and others of equal intellectual emi-
nence. They were the first scientifically conducted and attested
experiments in Thought Transference, and later were imitated and
reproduced by " sensitives " all the world over.
I am the sole survivor of that group of experimentalists, and as
no harm can be done to anyone, but possible good to the cause of
truth, I, with mingled feelings of regret and satisfaction, now
declare that the whole of those alleged experiments were bogies,
and originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how
easily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when
seeking for evidence in support of a theory they were wishful to
establish.
And here let me say that I make this avowal in no boastful
spirit. Within three months of our acquaintance with the leading
members of the Society for Psychical Research Mi*. Smith and
myself heartily regretted that these personally charming and
scientifically distinguished men should have been victimised ; but it
was too late to recant. We did the next best thing. We stood
aside and watched with amazement the astounding spread of the
fire we had in a spirit of mischief lighted.
116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1911.
The genesis of the matter was in this wise. In the hxte seventies
and early eighties a wave of so-called occultism passed over
England. Public interest Ijecanie absorbed in the varied alleged
phenomena of Spiritualism, Mesmerism, and thought-reading; "pro-
fessors " of the various branches abounded, and Brighton, where I
was editing a weekly journal, became a happy hunting ground for
mediums of every kind. I had started an exposure campaign, and
had been rather successful. My great score was being the first to
detect the secret of Irving Bishop's thought-reading. In 1882 I
encountered Mr. G. A. Smith, a youth of 19, whom I found giving
a mesmeric entertainment. Scenting a fraud, I proceeded to in-
vestigate, made his acquaintance, and very soon realised that I had
discovered a genius in his line. He has since been well known as
a powerful hypnotist. He was also the most ingenious conjurer I
have met outside the profession. He had the versatility of an
Edison in devising new tricks and improving on old ones. We
entered into a compact to " show up " some of the then flourishing
professors of occultism, and began by practising thought-reading^
Within a month we were astonishing Brighton at bazaars and kin-
dred charity entertainments, and enjoyed a great vogue. One of
our exhibitions was described very fully and enthusiastically in
Light, the spiritualistic paper, and on the strength of that the
Messrs. Myers, Gurney, and Podmore called on us and asked for a
private demonstration. As we had made a strict rule never to
take payment for our exhibitions, we were accepted by the society
as private unpaid demonstrators, and as such remained during
the long series of s(^ances.
It is but right to explain that at this period neither of us knew
or realised the scientific standing and earnest motive of the gentle-
men who had approached us. We saw in them only a superior
type of the spiritualistic cranks by whom we were daily pestered.
Our first private seance was accepted so unhesitatingly, and the
lack of reasonable precautions on the part of the "investigators"
was so marked, that Smith and I were genuinely amused, and felt
it our duty to show how utterly incompetent were these "scientific
investigators." Our plan was to bamboozle them thoroughly, then
let the world know the value of scientific research. It was the
vanity of the schoolboy who catches a master tripping.
A description of the codes and methods of communication in-
vented and employed by us to establish telepathic rapport would
need more space than could be spared. Suffice it that, thanks to
Oct., 1911. Confessions of a " Telepathist." ' 117
the ingenuity of Smith, they became marvellously complete. They
grew with the demands upon them.
Starting with a crude set of signals produced by the jingling of
pince-nez, sleeve-links, long and short breathings, and even blow-
ing, they developed to a degree little short of marvellous. To this
day no conjurer has succeeded in approaching our great feat, by
which Smith, scientifically blindfolded, deafened, and muffled in two
blankets, reproduced in detail an irregular figure drawn by Mr.
Myers, and seen only by him and me.
The value of a contribution such as this should lie not so' much
in describing the machinery as in pointing out how and where
these investigators failed, so that future investigators may avoid
their mistakes.
I say boldly that Messrs. Myeirs and Gurney were too anxious
to get corroboration of their theories to hold the balance impar-
tially. Again and again they gave the benefit of the doubt to
experiments that were failures. They allowed us to impose our
own conditions, accepted without demur our explanations of failure,
and, in short, exhibited a complaisance and confidence which, how-
ever complimentary to us, was scarcely consonant with a strict
investigation on behalf of the public.
That this same slackness characterised their investigations with
other sensitives I am satisfied, for I witnessed many, and the pub-
lished reports confirmed the susspicion. It is also worthy of note
that other sensitives broke down or showed weakness on exactly
the same points that Smith and I failed—namely, in visualising
an article difficult to describe in words signalled by a code. A
regular figure or familiar object was nearly always seen by the
percipient, but when a splotch of ink, or a grotesque irregular figure,
had to be transferred from one brain to the other, the result was
always failure. We, owing to a very ingenious diagram code, got
nearer than anybody, but our limitations were great.
Smith and I, by constant practice, became so sympathetic that
we frequently brought off startling hits, which were nothing but
fiukes. The part that fortuitous accident plays in this business
can only be believed by those who have become expert in the art
of watching for and seizing an opportunity. When these hits were
made, the delight of the investigators caused them to throw otf
their caution and accept practically anything we off"ered.
I am aware it may be reasonably objected that the existence of a
false coin does not prove the non-existence of a good one. My

suggestion as the result of years of observation is that the majority
of investigators and reporters in psychical research lack that accu-
rate observation and absence of bias which are essential to rigorous
and reliable investigation. In fine, I gravely doubt not the bona
fides, but the capacity, of the witnesses. I could fill columns tell-
ing how, in the course of my later investigations on behalf of the
Society for Psychical Research, I have detected persons of other-
wise unimpeachable rectitude touching uj) and redressing the weak
points in their narratives of telepathic experiences.
Mr. Frank Podmore, perhaps the most level-headed of the
researchers—and to the end a sceptic—aptly puts it :
'•
It is not the
friend whom we know whose eyes must be closed and his ears
muffled, but the '
Mr. Hyde,' whose lurking presence in each of us
we are only now beginning to suspect."
I am convinced that this propensity to deceive is more general
among " persons of character " than is supposed. I have known
the wife of a bishop, when faced with a discrepancy in time in a
story of a death in India and the appearance of the Avraith in
England, deliberately amend her circumstantial story by many hours
to fit the altered circumstances. This touching-up process in the
telepathic stories I have met again and again, and I say, with full
regard to the weight of words, that among the hundreds of stories
I have investigated I have not met one that had not a weak link
which should prevent its being accepted as scientifically established.
Coincidences that at first sight appear good cases of telepathic
rapport occur to many of us. I have experienced several, but I
should hesitate to present them as perfect evidence.
At the risk of giving offence to some, I feel bound to say that
in the vast majority of cases that I have investigated the principals
are either biassed in favour of belief in the supernatural or not
persons whom I should regard as accurate observers and capable of
estimating the rigid mathematical form of evidence. What one
desires to believe requires little corroboration. I shall doubtless raise
a storm of protest when I assert that the principal cause of belief
in psychic phenomena is the inability of the average m.'in to observe
accurately and estimate the value of evidence, plus a bias in favour
of the phenomena being real. It is an amazing fact that I have
never yet, after hundreds of tests, found a man who could accurately
describe ten minutes afterwards a series of simple acts which I
performed in his presence. The reports of those trained and con-
scientious observers, Messrs. Myers and Gurney, contain many
V
Oct., 1911. Confessions of a " Telepathist." 119
absolute inaccuracies. For example, in describing one of my " ex-
periments," they say emphatically, "In no case did B. touch
S., even in the slightest manner." I touched him eight times, that
being the only way in which our code was then worked.
In conclusion, I ask thoughtful persons to consider this proposi-
tion : If two youths, with a week's preparation, could deceive trained
and careful observers like Messrs. Myers, Gurney, Podmore, Sidgwick,
and Romanes, under the most stringent conditions their ingenuity
could devise, what are the chances of succeeding inquirers being
more successful against " sensitives " who have had the advantage
of more years' experience than Smith and I had weeks 1 Further,
I would emphasise the fact that records of telepathic rapport in
almost every instance depend upon the statement of one person,
usually strongly predisposed to belief in the occult.
Douglas Blackburn.
August 3Qth, 1911.
The Editor of light, Mr. E. W. Wallis, replied in the issue of
September 2nd :
(To the Editor of " The Daily News.")
Sir, —Mr. Douglas Blackburn has supplied you with a by no means
modest though a very ingenious account of his past misdeeds. . . .
Mr. Blackburn now says :
" One of our exhibitions was described
very fully and enthusiastically in "Light," the spiritualistic paper, and
on the strength of that the Messrs. Myers, Gurney, and Podmore called
on us and asked for a private demonstration." But, Sir, the only
description of the proceedings of Messrs. G. A. Smith and Douglas
Blackburn which I can find in " Light " is one written and signed by
Mr. Blackburn himself ("Light," August 26th, 1882). In this com-
munication he says :
" I have had the satisfaction of experiencing
some demonstrations of mind-sympathy which are, I believe, almost
without precedent." Describing Mr. Smith's experiment, Mr. Black-
burn proceeds :
" He places himself en rapport with myself by taking
my hands ; and a strong concentration of will and mental vision on my
part has enabled him to read my thoughts with an accuracy that
approaches the miraculous. . . . The sympathy between us has been
developed to such a degree that he rarely fliils to experience the taste
of any liquid or solid I choose to imagine." There is more of the
same kind of writing. The letter I have quoted finished with a
statement that spiritualists and scientific inquirers would be welcomed
at some private seances that were about to be held.
120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., I9il.
In the "Proceedings" of the Society for Psychical Research, in which
the results of the experiments made by Messrs. Smith and Blackburn
were published, a note was appended to the report stating that Mr.
Blackburn had written to the Society (of which he became an associate
member), "to the effect that he had obtained remarkable results in
thought-reading, or will-impression." After corresponding with Mt.
Blackburn, who sent "a paper recording in detail his experiments with
Mr. Smith," Messrs. Myers and Gui-ney decided to go to Brighton to
investigate.
. Mr. Blackburn at that time seemed honest, and was regarded as
" a very painstaking observer." He claimed that by strongly con-
centrating his will and mental vision he established such mind-
sympathy with Mr. Smith that the latter was able to read his thoughts
with " an accuracy " that "approached the miraculous." To-day Mr.
Blackburn assures us that his letter to " Light " was an enthusiastic
way of misleading the public, that he and Mr. .Smith only employed
"codes," that there was no thought-reading about the business.
, . . As for the rest of Mr. Blackburn's statements with reference
to Messrs. Myers and Gurney, what can be thought of a man
who waits until he is " the sole survivor " of the group of
experimentalists before he—"in the cause of truth," forsooth
—
publicly charges them with incompetency and unreliability ? In my
opinion, by his own showing he surrenders every claim to respect-
ful attention. And when he makes the claim that for nearly thirty
years his experiments with Mr. Smith " have been accepted and cited
as the basic evidences of the truth of thought-transference," one can
only smile and pity. Fortunately telepathy does not rest upon any
such flimsy basis.
E. W. Wallis.
(Editor of "Light.")
On Sept. 4th, 1911, the Editor of the Daily News published
the following interview v^^ith Mr. G. A. Smith
:
"Let me say at once," he began, "that Mr. Blackburn's story is
a tissue of errors from beginning to end. In the first place I most
emphatically deny that I ever in any degree, in any way, when
working thirty years ago with Mr. Blackburn, attempted to bam-
boozle Messrs. Myers, Gurney and Podmore. Had such a thing
been possible I had too much admiration and respect for them and
too much respect for myself to try. These gentlemen, long before
they met us, had spent years in investigating psychic phenomena,
Oct., ]911. Confessions of a " Telepathist." 121
and were aware of every device and dodge for making sham
phenomena. They were on the watch not only for premeditated
trickery, but for unconscious trickery as well. You could not
deceive them, and the quack mediums hated them in consequence.
Were it not for the teaching of Myers and Gurney on
the unreliability of human evidence Mr. Blackburn could not say
what he has said. He is merely repeating what they taught him.
The finest expositions of such unreliability are by Myers and
Gurney. They were so highly equipped for this work that the
best trick mediums could never do their tricks in their presence.
I was most closely associated with both men, being private secretary
to each in turn, and speak the things I know."
" Can you give me examples of the errors you allege in Mr.
Blackburn's article 1
"
" Unfortunately it is only too easy. Let me detail a few. He
says Myers, Gurney and Podmore called on us and asked for a
private demonstration. This is not so ; it was Blackburn who first
approached the Psychical Research Society, and sent them an account
of his experiments with me and offered a demonstration. He says
his first score was his detection of the secret of Irving Bishop's
thought-reading ; where and when did he detect this and what
record is there of his discovery 1 Prof. Barrett, whose judgment
he is now deriding, was the first to do this.
" He says we formed a compact to '
show up ' the professors.
We did no such thing. Blackburn at that time was a serious
investigator, and assuredly I was. . . .
"He says I was the most ingenious conjurer he ever met outside
the profession, whereas I am the worst conjurer in the world. . . .
He says we had a code of signals. We had not a single one
;
we never contemplated the possibility of coding until we learnt it
from Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney themselves. He says we practised
together and brought off startling hits. We never did anything of
the kind. He did once say what a journalistic sensation might be
made by pretending the phenomena were done by trickery. He
has waited, it appears, until he thought all were dead who took
part in the experiments in order to pretend this."
"Do you recall, Mr. Smith, what Mr. Blackburn calls 'our great
feat,' by which you, scientifically blindfolded, deafened, and muffled
in two blankets, reproduced in detail an irregular figure drawn by
Mr. Myers and seen only by him and Mr. Blackburn ?
"
" Yes, I recall it perfectly, and the discussion which followed,
122 Journal of Society for PsyrMcal Research. Oct., loil.
when Mr. Gurney said the only possible way of doing it by trickery
was to conceal the drawing in a pencil case and pass it into my
hand. I was amused to read two years ago in a weekly paper
containing some statements by Mr. Blackburn that he gave this
very explanation of how the '
trick ' was done !
" .
" It was no trick then, Mr. Smith ?
"
"No, it was a bona fide experiment, and the successful result was
either due to chance or telepathy. I think it most unlikely it was
due to chance ;
the drawing so closely resembled the original. The
conditions under which the experiment was carried out were at once
too stringent and too simple to admit of conjuring, and the best
answer to those who deny it was telepathy is to ask them to repeat
the experiment in the presence of equally qualified observers and
under similar conditions."
Mr. Smith, when questioned as to the accuracy of Mr. Black-
burn's statement that he had touched hira (Mr. Smith) eight
times, '
that being the only way our code was then worked,'
denied that Mr. Blackburn had ever touched him.
"... We had no code," he said. " The whole object of the
experiment was to obtain thought transference, and all touchings
were out of the question. Whenever there was any touching or
contact of any description it is always minutely recorded by the
observers —see the records of the Psychical Research Society.
" Further—and this is most important—none of the experiments
in which Blackburn was concerned have been put forward by the
Psychical Eesearch Society in any authoritative work. So far from
this being the case the journals of the society ^ contain the following
statement made when Mr. Blackburn's '
confessions ' first appeared :
This so-called confession hid no relation to tlie facts. It would he a
mistake to suppose that these experiments icere ever regarded, as Mr.
Blackburn asserts, as the bed-rock foundation of all the later expteriments
which are said to prove the existence of telepathy. On the contrary the
experiments in question were not reprinted (as otiiers were) in " Phantasms
of the Living" nor in any other standard work of the kind. Nor is it
true that the conditions tvere thoucjht ideal. In the first scries contact
was allotved, and as to the second the experimenters state that it would
no doubt be an exaggeration to affirm, that the possibility of (auditm-y)
signals ivas absolutely excluded. We shall endeavour so to vary tlie con^-
ditions of subsequent experiments as to exclude this hypiothesis completely."
1
The statement which Mr. Smith quotes was, as a matter of fact, contained
not in the Journal, but in a leaflet printed separately and issued to enquirers.
Oct., 1911. Covfessions of a " Telepathist." 123
"... The council of the society discussed whether his articles
should be replied to, but decided to treat him and his confessions
with the contempt both merit. They thought it would be playing
his game to treat him seriously."
Mr. Blackburn wrote on the following day :
The fact that Mr. G. A. Smith is alive supplies another argument
in support of my pet theory, that most human evidence is unreliable.
I was informed of his death when I was in Africa, and since my
return two persons who claimed to know him corroborated inde-
pendently, while a letter I addressed to him was returned "not
known." Had I been aware of his existence I should not have
opened up the subject, for I am aware that Mr. Smith, as he
con6rms in to-day's interview, spent many of the years that have
elapsed since our acquaintance in close association with leading
members of the Society for Psychical Eesearch in a fiduciary
capacity. I am also aware that that position was the legitimate
reward for his services in connection with our telepathic " experi-
ments " and his undoubted power as a remarkable hypnotist.
While pleased to learn that the bright, amusing, and ingenious
confrere of thirty years ago is in the prime of life, I am sorry that
I should have unintentionally forced him into having to defend a
position he has occupied so long. I have been reproached for
postponing my confession until after the death of the principals.
I am satisfied that in doing this I showed my regard for those
gentlemen—Mr. Smith included—and my desire to avoid giving
them pain. That Mr. Smith should have to bear the brunt of the
attack is unfortunate, but quite accidental on my part.
But now to business. Mr. Smith gives a categorical denial to
my story ; declares that he was a genuine sensitive, and I also the
possessor of psychic power. He could do no less, and I cannot
blame him. He was a plucky controversialist in those younger
days, and I am prepared to see him put up a tough fight now.
In most controversies there is a tendency to obscure the main
issue by the introduction of minor details. Let us clear the decks
of unnecessary lumber, such as the question whether I first approached
the S.P.R., or they me. It is sufficient that we met. It is also
agreed that Smith and I conducted many alleged telepathic experi-
ments. It is a fact that those experiments were considered of
sufficient importance then to be given first place in the official
report. Mr. Smith also knows that they excited great interest,
124=- Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1911.
and that he and I were made much of by many men of scientific
eminence. To attempt to belittle the importance of those experi-
ments now is childish. No doubt greater things have been brought
off since, but we were the pioneers, and I am satisfied that we
unintentionally gave scores of subsequent exjjerimenters the cue how
to become "telepathic sensitives."
Mr. Smith denies that we employed a code. My reply is that
without one it would have been impossible for me to convey to
him the figures drawn by the members of the committee for trans-
ference from my brain to that of the blindfolded, blanket-muffled,
sensitive Smith. Let us dismiss all the other successful experiment5
—any one of which I will undertake to repeat to-day under identical
conditions, with the aid of any intelligent confederate—and confine
ourselves to "our great feat," which Mr. Smith tells your inter-
viewer he recalls perfectly. That feat, if genuine, would establish
telepathy beyond cavil. All others sink into insignificance in com-
parison. It was a master stroke, and so great was the impression
produced by it, both upon the " best trained and best qualified
observers in London " and ourselves, that we decided to retire upon
our laurels, feeling certain we could never hope to repeat or equal
it. It was the best and last thing I did. As Mr. Smith repudiates,
participation in the invention, I will take full credit or otherwise
for it. I ask that readers will note very carefully every detail in
the ensuing description of the trick, for it is they who will have ta
give the verdict.
The committee had realised the possibility of conveying by signals
a description of a regular figure or any object capable of being
described in words, and I would direct the attention of those who.
have access to the printed copies of the early figures Smith and I
produced. It will be noticed that so long as the figures were
describable in words they were fairly accurate reproductions ; but
the more irregular and indescribable they became the greater and
wider were the discrepancies between the original seen by me and
the copy produced by Smith. Now I put it as a fair question : If
Smith could, see what I saw, as he professed, why is it that he
could see plainly an equilateral triangle, but fail to see it if one
of the sides or angles was "wobbly" and out of shape? Again,
if he could reproduce with reasonable accuracy the silhouette of a.
man's head, easily described by a code, why did he fail when
that same head was touched up with black ink protuberances, with,
the nose under the chin, a big ear on the back of the head, and
Oct., 1911. Confessions of a " Telepathist." 125
so on 1 The reason was simple. Our code was confined to regular,
or fairly regular, figures. It would have taken hours to spell out
a full description of that figure by the sounds, movements, intervals
of time, bogus mesmeric passes that stirred his hair, and the
numerous, almost imperceptible, signals that formed perhaps the
most complex and efl'ective code ever used by conjurers. I doubt
whether any person could write at leisure a description of such an
object so accurately as to enable another one to reproduce the.
figure from that description.
This reasonable point of view occurred to the committee, and
they abandoned regular figures for complex indescribables. Need
I say that we failed again and again ? In fact, we ceased any
attempt to "transfer" them. I had a signal, which I gave Smith
when the drawing was impossible. We made a pretence of trying
hard, but, after a time, would give up on the stock explanation of
" absence of rapport." Mr. Smith is angry with me for holding in
light esteem the capacity of Messrs. Myers and Gurney for taking
precautions against deception. I confess that their irregular drawings
completely snuiTed out the psychic power which, according to Mr.
Smith, I possessed without knowing it. As a matter of fact, the
committee were beginning to have grave doubts when the "great
feat " I shall now describe saved our reputations and enabled me at
least to carry out my bat.
These were the conditions : Smith sat in a chair at a large table.
His eyes were padded with wool, and, I think, a pair of folded kid
gloves, and bandaged with a thick dark cloth. His ears were filled
with one layer of cotton-wool, then pellets of putty. His entire
body and the chair on which he sat were enveloped in two very
heavy blankets. I remember, when he emerged triumphant, he
was wet with perspiration, and the paper on which he had success-
fully drawn the figure was so moist that it broke during the
examination by the delighted observers. Beneath his feet and
surrounding his chair were thick, soft rugs, rightly intended to
deaden and prevent signals by feet shutHes—a wise precaution, for
in our early experiments my feet did marvellous things. Smith
being rendered contact proof and perfectly insulated, my part
began.
At the farther side of the room—a very large dining-room
—
Mr. Myers showed me, with every precaution, the drawing that I
was to transmit to the brain beneath the blankets. It was a tangle
of heavy black lines, interlaced, some curved, some straight, the
1'2G Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., I9ii.
sort of thing an infant playing with a pen or pencil might produce,
and I am certain absolutely indescribable in words, let alone a code.
I took it, fixed my gaze on it, pacing the room meanwhile and
going through the usual process of impressing the figure upon my
retina and brain, but always keeping out of touching distance with
Smith. These preliminaries occupied perhaps ten or more minutes,
for we made a point of never hurrying. I drew and redrew the
figure many times openly in the presence of the observers, in order,
as I explained and they allowed, to fix it on my brain. I also
drew it, secretly, on a cigarette jDaper. By this time I was fairly
expert at palming, and had no diflSculty, while pacing the room
collecting " rapport," in transferring the cigarette paper to the tube
of the brass protector on the pencil I was using. I conveyed to
Smith the agreed signal that I was ready by stumbling against the
edge of the thick rug near his chair.
Next instant he exclaimed: "I have it." His right hand came
from beneath the blanket, and he fumbled about the table, saying,
according to arrangement: "Where's my penciH"
Immediately I placed mine on the table. He took it and a long
and anxious pause ensued.
This is what was going on under the blanket. Smith had
concealed up his waistcoat one of those luminous painted slates
which in the dense darkness gave sufficient light to show the figure
when the almost transparent cigarette paper was laid flat on the
slate. He pushed up the bandage from one eye, and copied the
figure with extraordinary accuracy. It occupied over five minutes.
During the time I was sitting exhausted with the mental eff'ort
quite ten feet a^vay.
Presently Smith threw back the blanket and excitedly pushing
back the eye bandage produced the drawing, which was done on
a piece of notepaper, and very nearly on the same scale as the
original. It was a splendid copy.
I ask a discriminating public to compare my explanation with
Mr. Smith's. He says :
" It was a bona fide experiment, and the
successful result was either due to chance or telepathy. I think it
most unlikely that it was due to chance, the drawing so closely
resembled the original. The conditions under which the experiment
was carried out were at once too stringent and too simple to admit
of conjuring, and the best answer to those who deny it was telepathy
is to ask them to repeat the experiment in the presence of equally
qualified observers, and under similar conditions."
Oct., 1911. Confessions of a " Telepathist." ' 127
I do not wish to take advantage of an obvious slip, for Mr. Smith
can hardly mean what he says in the last few lines quoted. How
can those who doubt the experiment prove it? I will put it in the
way Mr. Smith probably meant.
I challenge Mr. Smith or any other person to reproduce that
experiment under the same conditions ; I to draw the figure and
insulate both the experimenters, also to examine their clothes, etc.
I also stipulate that the experiment shall take place in an apartment
not known to the experimenters till they enter it. If under those
conditions an irregular figure can be produced bearing a reasonable
resemblance to the original I will not only admit that our great
feat was genuine, but will immediately proceed to cultivate that
psychic power which Mr. Smith insists I must possess, but of which
so far I am unconscious.
In conclusion, I wish to convey to Mr. Smith my sincere regret
for having unintentionally forced him into his present position. I
have always retained a pleasant recollection of our short association,
and during a very variegjited life have been more than once able to
amuse and bewilder friends by practising some of the feats of leger-
demain he taught me, but which he now so modestly repudiates.
Douglas Blackburn.
A further interview with Mr. G. A. Smith was published
in the Daily Neivs on Sept. 6th, in which he denies Mr.
Blackburn's statement
:
" It is the most amazing piece of invention ever brought to my
notice," [he] said. . . . "All the essential points of Mr. Blackburn's
article are untrue, and I deny the whole story from beginning
to end.
"There were in all 31 telepathic experiments in which Mr. Black-
burn and I were concerned, and these are recorded in the '
Proceedings
of the Psychical Research Society.' Mr. Blackburn has especially
directed attention to the experiment which produced what in the
'Proceedings' referred to (Vol. I., Third Report on Thought Trans-
ference) is known as Figure 22. Let me Cjuote from that report,
which is signed by Mr. Gurney, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Mr. Podmore,
and Professor Barrett.
We have noiv to consider- u-hethcr it was jmsible that any information
of the character of the designs drawn could have reached Smith through
ike ordinary avenues of sense. Of the five recognised gateways of knotu-
ledge, four—tasting, smelling, touch, and sight—^vere excluded by the

conditions of the experiment. There remains the sense of hearing, which
was hut partially interfered, with bij the bandage over the eyes and the ears.
But the iiformation can certainly not have been conveyed by speech; our
ears were as near to Mr. Blackburn as Mr. Smith's, and our eyes would
have caught the slightest moveivmt of his lips.
Alluding to the hypothesis of a code of audible signals other than
oral speech, the report continues :
Let our readers, who may he familiar with the Morse or any other code
of signals, try in some such ivay to convey a description of some of our
drawings to a friend who is blindfolded, and has not seeji the original;
tue venture to assert that, even if audible signs were allowed, several
minutes at least would be required to convey the notion of the figures
correctly. It is probably no exaggeration to say that several scores, if
not hundreds, of precise signs would be required to convey an idea
as exact as that implied in many of Mr. Smith's representations,
. , . and since our attention, during this part of the experiment, was
concentrated on the relation between Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Smith we
are at a loss to conceive hoiv any signalling, sufficient in amount to
convey the required ideas, could have passed undetected. . . . However,
with the view of removing all doubts that might arise as to possible
auditory communications, we on one occasion stopped Mr. Smith's ears
with putty, then tied a bandage round his eyes and ears, then fastened
a bolster-case over the head, and over all threw a blanket which enveloped
his entire head and trunk. Fig. 22 was now draicn by one of us and
shown outside the. room to Mr. Blackburn, who on his return sat behind
Mr. Smith, and in no contact with him whatever, and as perfectly still
as it is possible for a human being to sit who is not concentrating his
attention on keeping motionless to tite exclusion of every other object. In
a few minutes Mr. Smith took up the pencil ami gave the successive
reproductions shotvn below.
"Now," said IMr. Smith, "it is for the readers of the 'Daily News''
to choose betAveeii the report of Messrs. Gurney, Myers, Podmore,
and Professor Barrett, and that of Mr. Blackburn. He says he was
shown the drawing inside the room ;

outside ; he says he took it and paced the room ;

as perfectly still as it is possible for a human being to sit,
" In view of the infinite precautions shown to have been taken,
is it credible that Mr. Blackburn should have been able to copy the
complicated design on a cigarette paper and conceal it in the end
of a pencil case ? Is it likely that the observers would have per-
Oct., 1911. Confessions of a " Telcpathist." 129
mitted him to place that pencil on the table for me to take 1 He
could not have copied the drawing, concealed it in the pencil-case,
and placed the pencil on the table, and all the time remained '
as
perfectly still as it is possible for a human being to sit.'
"
Questioned about the luminous slate which Mr. Blackburn says
was used, Mr. Smith replied :
" That is a grotesque untruth ; I absolutely deny it. Even had
trickery, as Mr. Blackburn alleges, been involved, there was no neces-
sity for a luminous slate. I had quite sufficient light to see to draw
what I wanted to draw. No wonder Mr. Blackburn says that had
lie been aware of my existence he would never have opened up
the subject ! His excuse that he waited thirty years until he thought
all those who knew the facts were dead hardl}^ accords with his
professed desire for the truth.
"... He claims to possess '
the most complete and effective
code ever used by conjurers.' Further, he undertakes to repeat
to-day, with the aid of any intelligent confederate, any one of the
thirty-one drawings of experiments in thought transference published
•in 1882 by the Psychical Research Society, in which he acted as
agent. Let him substantiate his claims. . . . You have only to
look at the drawings drawn by me and reproduced in Vol. I. of
the Psychical Research Society's Proceedings to see that it is most
difficult to describe them in speech or writing. It is for Mr. Black-
burn to do what he claims he can do. He has appealed to demon-
stration; let demonstration decide."
In the same issue is published a brief interview with Pro-
fessor Barrett, in which he gives " an emphatic verdict i'or Mr.
Smith."
"Mr. Blackburn," he said, . . . "thought Mr. Smith was dead
and apparently he thought I was dead too, for he described himself
as the sole survivor of those who were present at the experiment.
Now I was present at that experiment, and yon may say that not only
I, but Myers and Gurney, had the most absolute confidence in Mr.
Smith. . . . After the experiment Mr. Smith visited me in Dublin,
and I carried out there a series of extremely drastic tests with him."
Professor Barrett denied that the theory of thought-transfer-
ence rested largely on the Smith-Blackburn case. His own
experiments, he said, began years before, and in those experi-
ments he was joined by many other researchers. He concluded
130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1911.
with a reference to the more recent " experiments of Miss Miles
and Miss liamsden, who established the fact of thought-trans-
ference at increasing distances—even when one was in Bristol and
the other in the Highlands. All these and many other indis-
putable cases are fully recorded in the papers of the Society."
An interview with Mr. Feilding was published on Sept. 7th,
in which he " endorsed the statement of Mr. Smith published in
the " Daily News " on Monday [Sept. 4th], and paid a tribute
to him as a careful, painstaking experimenter who was interested
in telepathy, but was at the same time always slightly sceptical
about experiments."
"How these experiments could be faked interested Gurney and
Smith very much," said Mr. Feilding, "and they used to make
experiments in faking and then, in testing an exposition, try every
means to obviate the methods they had discovered. Gurney was
extraordinarily ingenious in discovering means of communication, and
some of the things which Mr. Blackburn says actually happened
were only invented in order to prevent them being used
" I am perfectly satisfied with the possibility of [telepathy] taking
place, and should like to say that in the event of any readers of this
correspondence believing themselves able to show telepathic power,
I should be grateful, on my return from abroad, to have the oppor-
tunity of conducting experiments with them."
In the issue of Sept. 8th, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick wrote:
(To the Editor of "The Daily News.")
Sept. 6th, 1911.
Sir, ... As Mr. Smith has replied effectively to what he mildly
characterises as Mr. Blackburn's " tissue of errors," I need add little
except that all communication of the leading workers in psychical
research with Mr. Blackburn ceased not long after the experiments in
question, and that, on the other hand, the connection of Mr. G. A.
Smith with the work of the society was long and intimate. He took
part not oidy in experiments, but in inquiries, investigations, and
clerical work, and acted for some considerable time as Mr. Gurney's
valued private secretary and assistant.
Mr. Blackburn may have been, as he seems to imply, engaged in
psychical research, whether honestly or dishonestly, for many years,
but it has not been in connection with the Society for Psychical
Kesearch. I should doubt his having made any investigations for
Oct., 1911. Confessions of a " Telepathist." 131
the society, or having ever attended any experiments published in
its "Proceedings" except those in which he now asserts that he
played the part of fraudulent telepathic agent. What are we to
think of a man who makes a virtue of withholding a confession till
he believes (fortunately erroneously) that all who could contradict
him are dead 1
I may add that the experiments in which Mr. Blackburn was
concerned form but a very small part of those on which the case
for telepathy rests. Anyone may convince himself of this by studying
the numerous volumes of the "Proceedings" of the Society for
Psychical Research. There have been many experiments by different
agents and percipients.
Still, as Mr. Smith points out, but little is yet known of the process
or of the conditions that ensiu'e success ;
and, in the opinion of
myself and my colleagues, further experiments in transferring
diagrams or other definite images or ideas are much to be desired.
The Society for Psychical Research is always glad to hear of experi-
ments being tried, and its officers are always willing to give any
advice and assistance to would-be experimenters that they can.

Sir, —In a letter received by me this morning, you are good
enough to ask my opinion on two points—(1) the series of experi-
ments in thought-transference in which Mr. Douglas Blackburn took
part some thirty years ago ; and (2) the reliability of the criteria
generally on which the believers in telepathic communication base
their conviction.
As regards the first point, I have no first-hand knowledge of
the experiments in question, and no opinion to give on the article
by Mr. Blackburn.
As to the second point, the experiments in which I have been
personally concerned are so complicated, and at present so tentative,
that it is impossible within the limits of a newspaper article to
present the evidence which they afford for telepathic communication,

and on a subject so novel and so little understood an opinion un-
supported by evidence would be valueless. The full evidence for the
phenomena known as " cross-correspondences "
—correspondences, that
is, between the automatic writings of persons at a distance from one
another and with no means of normal communication—is set forth
in the recent volumes of the "Proceedings" of the Society for
Psychical Research, and is summarised by Mr. Frank Podmore in
his last book, "The Newer Spiritualism," published in 1910.
Further experiment is much to be desired, and those of your
readers who are interested in the subject can confer no greater
benefit on psychical research than by themselves carrying out experi-
ments on thought transference at a distance,- and so adding to the
reliable criteria for telepathic communication.

COERESPONDENCE. , ;
On Professor Barrett's " Poltergeists: Old and New."
{To the Editor of the S.P.R. Journal.)
August Ibth, 1911.
May I be allowed to make a few observations on Professor
Barrett's article, " Poltergeists Old and New," in this month's
Proceedings 1
I shall confine my remarks to the first two cases, viz. those alleged
to have happened at Enniscorthy and Derrygonnelly respectively, as
the first of these was specially reported for Prof Barrett, and the
second was personally observed by him. Let us take the Ennis-
corthy case first, as investigated by Mr. N. J. Murphy, whose report
Prof Barrett designates as "admirable." If this merely means that
the report is that of an educated and conscientious eye-witness, who
has given us his experiences in a temperate and convincing manner,
I, for one, thoroughly agree with Prof. Barrett's description. I
have no doubt whatever that Mr. Murphy saw what he describes.
But if I am asked if Mr. Murphy's report helps us to account for
the causes of what he saw, and particularly in the direction of the
exclusion of human agency, I am afraid I shall have to say that it
falls somewhat short of excellence in this respect. I submit that
before we can call the "Poltergeist" to our aid in this particular
Oct., 1911. Correspondence. 133
case, we must place it beyond all reasonable doubt that the
manifestations were not due to human agency alone. As far as I
am concerned, while I cannot positively assert that Randall was
the agent, the investigation of the occurrences being such as it
is, I cannot say that I am any farther on the road to believing
that " Poltergeists " do or do not exist than I was before I read
Prof. Barrett's observations on this case.
Mr. Murphy, by his own account, knew pretty well what par-
ticular phenomena to expect. They may be roughly stated as raps,
removal of Randall's bedclothes, and the moving of Sinnott's heavy
bedstead.
Now, one would imagine that anyone on the point of setting
forth to investigate the causes of certain unexplained happenings
would make up his mind to keep a particular look-out for any loop-
hole for human agency, especially on the part of the subject of the
manifestations. For instance, one might imagine him saying
:
" Randall's bedclothes are liable to sudden removal. Well, then, if
I insist on seeing the bedclothes laid over him piece by piece when
he gets into bed, the clothes then tucked in, Randall lying with his
arms outside, so that I can see his hands, and if I sit so near the
bed that I can detect any stealthy or sudden movement of his
body or lower limbs—then, if the bedclothes glide off him and
under the bed, I shall have to report that no human agency,
directed in any ordinary channel, was the cause." On the other
hand, what do we find in Mr. Murphy's report 1 It is true that
the bedclothes and room are examined before Randall gets into bed,
but this is all. For anything the report says to the contrary,
Randall lies down, disposing the bedclothes as he likes, and possibly
completely covered by them, except his head. If he did so, what
could prevent him from passing a loose bottom end of the upper
sheet along the far side of the bed, and pulling it, aided by stealthy
movements of his feet, until it gradually glided off him over the
foot of the bed, drawing with it the superincumbent blankets, etc. 1
On July 29th bedclothes would probably be fairly light. Personally
I cannot help feeling amused at the apparent importance attached
by Mr. Murphy to the way in which the bedclothes "appeared to
be actually going back under the bed much in the same position
one would expect bedclothes to be if a strong breeze were blowing
through the room at the time." I may say I also think this im-
portant, though probably for reasons different from those of Mr.
Murphy. If the occupant of the bed were himself drawing the
134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., I9il.
bedclothes over the foot of the bed, by holding a loose lower end,
the clothes would naturally tend to go under the bed towards the
unseen hand reaching down over the far side and underneath the
bedstead. No doubt Randall would have scorned the action, but a
pin inserted at the top of the bedclothes would have materially
assisted their passage together off the bed, and could have been
instantly withdrawn from the clothes while Mr. Murphy was
making a " thorough search under the bed for strings or wires."
After this, Mr. Murphy "adjusted the clothing again properly on
the bed." This time, as Randall had not had the disposing of the
bedclothes, there would be no opportunity of drawing them off the
bed, unless he himself accompanied them, and it is a great pity
that a light was only struck "just in time to see Randall slide
from the bed," i.e. just when gravity might be expected to take up
what the "Poltergeist" had so ably begun. Any process of
wriggling, or working body and bedclothes downwards, that might
possibly be supposed to have occurred under cover of pretended
struggles to resist the force which was drawing him from the bed,
if any such wriggling, etc., occurred, would have been hidden
or obscured by the partial darkness. Anyhow, I confidently deny
the existence of any merely visual indication by which anybody
can tell whether a man who is sliding gradually oft' a couch, at
the same time professing to resist the force that is compelling him,
is doing so voluntarily or not.
Again, it is significant that no movement of the other heavy
bedstead took place under Mr. Murphy's observation. According
to the servant, the only movement of the bedstead of which she
had heard occurred when it was occupied by "the two young men"
(p. 385), i.e. Sinnott and the third lodger. Randall himself is our
only authority for the assertion that it moved with three men in
it, including himself (p. 388). This, of course, would practically
exclude his agency, but, in face of the servant's story, who, one
would think, would have mentioned the greater rather than the lesser
marvel, had she ever heard of it, and having regard to the fact
that no statement of any kind from Randall's room-mates is at
present forthcoming, I prefer to reserve my opinion on this point.
I can only say that if the bed with the two men in it moved while
Randall was in his own bed, I do not see why he should not have
moved it by a stout cord passed round a leg near the floor by its
middle. At any moment, by releasing one end, he could have
drawn away and hidden the cord. No doubt the bedstead was a
Oct., 1911. Gorrespondence. 135
heavy one, but one can move by traction objects which appear beyond
one's strength when only a combination of lifting and pushing is
applied.
I regret that I am unable to see why Randall's "terribly frightened
condition precludes any supposition that he was privy to any human
agency being employed to effect the manifestation." If a sweeping
assertion like this is to hold good, I do not see why the law should
not at once determine the precise amount of guilty or innocent
bearing necessary to "preclude any supposition" that an accused
person is or is not guilty of the crime. I maintain that it is equally
open to us to argue that Randall's fright might be due to the fact
that, having previously made a great fuss about his abnormal
experiences, and knowing these to be of his own contriving, he
viewed the introduction of an investigator of superior calibre to
the former witnesses of his marvels with considerable trepidation.
As regards the Derrygonnelly case, we are, I think, on firmer
ground, as Prof. Barrett was himself a witness of the manifestations.
I can only say that while Prof. Barrett's brief summary does not,
to my mind, exclude the possibilit}' of human agency for the
phenomena, any difficulties I may meet with would possibly be
cleared up had I access to the fuller account in the Dublin University
Magazine.
I will only make one observation. It is on the test applied
personally by Prof. Barrett to the " Poltergeist " or other agent.
He says, "I mentally asked it, no word being spoken, to knock a
certain number of times, and it did so. To avoid any error or
delusion on my part,^ I put my hands in the side pocket of my
overcoat and asked it to knock the number of fingers I had open."
I can only say how much I regret that Prof Barrett did not keep
on with his first test. He could easily have avoided " any error or
delusion " by asking his friend to count the raps given in answer to
his mental invitation. If the "agent" had given, say, 15, 3, 26, 9 raps
on four separate occasions in response to Professor Barrett's four
separate mental invitations, the fact that some other than human
agency must be concerned would be practically established. Instead
of doing this, Prof. Barrett, to my mind most unfortunately, abandons
the test after one successful result, which might, of course, be due to
pure chance, and adopts another, which can be easily seen to be far
more open to error.
Had Prof Barrett written, " In order to increase the chance of
. . . - . . ^The italics are mine. —H. G, A. M,
136 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt. Oct.,1911.
error or delusion on my part, I," etc. I think his words would have
suited his action better, for the following reasons
:
(«) He at once limited the agent to a choice from among ten
numbers, by employing his ten fingers, thus lessening the value of
the test.
{h) He set himself to do two things at once, i.e. to inhibit any
muscular action of his fingers which would increase or diminish the
number held out in his pockets, and at the same time to count the
raps given by the agent.
Now, let anyone lie in bed uncertain of the time, and try to
resolve not to clasp or unclasp any of his fingers, so that he may
be absolutely certain whether he has moved one of them or not, and
at the same time listen to a neighbouring clock and tell the time.
I am certain that the result would be either that he would know
he had not moved a finger but be not quite sure whether it was 11
or 12 that struck, or that he would have heard the clock correctly but
would have some doubt about the absolute immobility of his fingers.
Now, in the first test, he would only have to think, say 41, and
stow it away in his memory, perhaps with the aid of some
tag, e.g. " My brother's age—41," and then set himself to count the
raps. In this case the act of deciding upon the number thought of
is over and irrevocable. In the second test, the act of fixing and
maintaining a certain number of fingers in position is coincident with
the counting of the raps, a most potent incentive to unconscious
self-deception, either in opening or closing an extra finger to meet
the number of raps, or miscounting the raps to suit the number of
fingers. —I am, Madam, Your obedient servant,

The Editor having kindly sent me a proof of the above letter, I
desire to remove a misconception which Major Moore appears to
have formed in reference to my experiments with the Derrygonnelly
poltergeist. The number (from 1 to 10) which I wished rapped was
silently thought of in each case, and the corresponding lumiber of
fingers opened simply as a record in place of pencil and paper. To
have selected a high number, such as Major Moore suggests, would
have given rise to uncertainty in counting and have been less
desirable on other grounds.
As regards the Enniscorthy poltergeist Major Moore's criticisms
will, I hope, be answered by the observers who were present. I
will only state that his hypotheses appear to me quite as incredible
as any supernormal theory. W, F. Barrett,

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
The 37th Private Meeting of the Society for Members and
Associates only was held in the Council Chamber at 20
Hanover Square, London, W., on Tuesday, October 31st, 1911,
at 4 p.m. ; Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S., in the chair.
Dr. T. W. Mitchell read a paper on " Some Types of
Multiple Personality," which it is proposed to publish in the
next Part of Proceedings.
This Meeting was the first one held in connection with the
Medical Section of the Society, the formation and constitution
of which were announced in the Journal for last April.
Many medical men already belong to the Society, and it is
hoped that the formation of this Section may induce others to
join, and may lead to further co-operation with the medical
profession, in so far as the subjects dealt with by it and by
140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., I9il.
the Society for Psychical Eesearch trench on each other's
provinces.
The objects of the Medical Section, as stated in its con-
stitution, are
:
{a) To promote the study of the psychological side of
medicine, especially the principles underlying different forms of
treatment by suggestion and other psycho-therapeutic measures,
dissociations of consciousness, and analogous problems.
(h) To publish original contributions by medical men on
these subjects in special medical Parts of the Proceedings, to
appear from time to time.
(c) To consider the possible bearings of these studies on
Psychical Eesearch proper.
The Committee appointed by the Council to manage the
affairs of the Section are the following
:
J. Milne Bramwell, M.B., 17 Wimpole Street, London, W.
C. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D., 88 Park Street, Grosvenor Square,
London, W.
H. E. WiNGFiELD, M.D., 44 Welbeck Street, London, W.
Maurice B. Wright, M.D., 17 Wimpole Street, London, W.
Hon. Secretary, T. W. MITCHELL, M.D., Hoath Cottage,
Hadlow, near Tonbridge.
Any qualified medical practitioner who is already a Member
or Associate of the Society for Psychical Eesearch may
become a member of the Medical Section on sending his or
her name to the Hon. Secretary of the Section and requesting
to be enrolled as such, no extra subscription being required.
Any other qualified medical practitioners who wish to join
must first be elected as Members or Associates of the S.P.E.
The next Part of the Proceedings to be published will be
the first of the Special Medical Parts, in which Dr. Mitchell's
paper, read at the meeting referred to above, will appear.
THE CASE OF ANNA BUETON.
By Helen de G. Verkall.
The latest issue of the Proceedings of the American Society
for Psycliiccd^ Eesearch (Vol. V., Part 1., April, 1911) contains
an interesting report by Professor J. H. Hyslop, on " A Case
Nov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 141
of Hysteria." The subject, Anna Burton,^ a girl about twenty
years old, produces physical phenomena of the usual medium-
istic type ostensibly under spirit control. None of the
investigators—none at least of those who had any opportunity
for a prolonged examination of the case—have any doubt that
in her normal condition Miss Burton is perfectly honest, and
she has freely submitted herself to every suggested test. The
development of the case is thus described by Mrs. Milton, with
whom Miss Burton lives :
" Being greatly interested in spirit
phenomena, ... I decided to make some experiments in my
own home, ... a very favourable opportunity having presented
itself. A child of thirteen summers—Miss Anna Burton
—
came to make her home with me. She seemed gifted with
occult powers, as little raps indicated during her sleeping hours.
Feeling that the child was too young to sit for development,
I gradually interested her in the phenomena, and after two
years of play and study we decided to sit for development."
Mrs. Milton was present at all the sittings referred to in
this report, with one exception. On that occasion the
phenomena took place as usual and they were also unaffected
by any precautions taken against the possibility of fraud on
her part. It is, therefore, almost certain that she is in no
way concerned in their production : nevertheless it appears to
me that it would be desirable in case of further investigation
to exclude from the sittings all persons except those having a
purely scientiiic interest in the observation of the phenomena.
The seances were held at first in a dim light, but soon
instructions were given by raps that they should be held in
the dark. Shortly afterwards, in accordance with further in-
structions, music was provided in the shape of a phonograph.
The phenomena produced under these circumstances include raps,
levitation of a table weighing about 100 lbs., movements of
various small objects such as a bell and tambourine, ostensibly
without contact, the tying of the medium to her chair with a
38 foot clothes-line, whistlino- and siniiing in various voices.
At these sittings the medium's hands were sometimes held,
but there was no attempt to impose rigorous test conditions.
In June, 1908, the case came under the observation of two

142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1911.
medical men, Dr. Smyth and Dr. Hamilton. In the course
of a long series of sittings they were able to prove, by means of
flashlight photographs, that some, at any rate, of the phenomena
were produced by the direct agency of the medium. In one
photogj-aph she appears holding the tambourine in her hand
;
in another she has it in her teeth and is evidently in the act
of tossing it into the air. But these discoveries did not destroy
the psychological interest of the case, since the experimenters
satisfied themselves that the phenomena were not to be
explained by conscious and deliberate fraud, but were produced
by the medium when she was in a condition of " hysteria,"
defined by Professor Hyslop as " physiological and mental
conditions that limit or eliminate normal consciousness."
It was at this stage of the proceedings that Professor Hyslop's
own investigation of the case began. In conjunction with Dr.
Smyth and Dr. Hamilton he held a large number of sittings,
with a view to ascertaining more exactly the nature of the
phenomena, the method of their production, and the physical
and mental condition of the medium. By means of " severe
tests for anaesthesia " the experimenters convinced themselves
of the genuineness of Miss Ikirton's trance. The anaesthesia
appears to have varied in regard to the area affected, being
sometimes confined to one arm, sometimes extending over the
whole hoily from the neck downwards. In view of the
importance of this question in its bearing on the psychological
aspect of the case, it is unfortunate, 1 think, that the report
does not state more precisely the nature of the tests applied
and the degree of anaesthesia that was observed. Upon the
question of " motor dissociation," as Professor Hyslop calls it,
greater precision would also have been desirable. It frequently
happened that one of Miss Burton's hands was held, the other
being left free for the production of phenomena. Under these
circumstances the experimenters sometimes failed to observe any
sympathetic muscular action in the hand under control corre-
sponding to such movements of other parts of Miss Burton's
body as would have been necessitated by the nature of the
phenomena (assuming, as the experimenters now did, that these
were piodiiced by her direct agency). But where the muscular
force which Miss Burton needed to exert was not great, it is
surely possilile that any sympathetic muscular action which was
Nov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 143
set up would be too slight to be perceptible without some much
more delicate test than was supplied by merely clasping the
medium's hand in complete darkness. On one occasion, when
an attempt was made to levitate the table—an action requiring
considerable muscular effort—Professor Hyslop observed " con-
vulsive muscular movements of the right hand," which he was
holding.
But apart from the question of anaesthesia or motor dissocia-
tion, there is evidence in the nature of the phenomena to
show that Miss Burton is not in a normal state during the
seances. She then appears to possess faculties which ostensibly
she does not possess at other times, and which it is difficult
to suppose she has had any means of acquiring. She displays, for
example, a delicacy and accuracy of touch, which seem to amount
almost to a faculty of " seeing in the dark." Dr. Hamilton
relates how, on one occasion " with the room in total darkness,
and while sitting at the right of the medium, I was made
aware of the presence of a foreign body in my left eye, which
began paining me very much and caused me to speak about
it. Immediately a hand came out of the darkness and began
stroking my eye in a very unusual manner, with unusual
delicacy of touch. The invisible hand placed the tips of the
index and middle fingers on the upper eyelid at the outer
canthus, and by a delicate stroke with an inward and rolling
motion carried the finger tips to the inner canthus, and then
beginning over again repeated the act several times until the
foreign body was removed. The hand that carried out the opera-
tion seemed to know the moment that the object was removed
from the eye. The skill in handling the eye was very striking
and impressed me very much. I had years before made a
practice of eye surgery, and my impressions about the skill
used were based upon considerable experience with manipula-
tions of the eye." At another time Dr. Hamilton asked " the
control," when the room was in darkness, " to touch the
extended tip of his right forefinger pointed straight up in the
air, and this she did several times with unerring accuracy,
even when he placed his other fingers and thumb around it,
with the purpose of seeing whether she would touch around
or feel for the finger." Drs. Hamilton and Smyth " tried to
accomplish this test with each other, but found that, when
144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1911.
the forefinger which was to be touched was moved a number
of inches from where it had been located before, it was impos-
sible to touch the forefin£;er without touchino- some of the
other fingers surrounding it."
In the trance-singing and whistling there seems also to be
evidence of some extension of faculty. It is impossible to prove
that the medium does not possess the required skill in her
normal state, but the presumption is strongly against it. Unless
in trance, she has never been known to whistle " except to call
a dog," but the trance-whistling shows considerable technical
skill. In the trance-singing the extension of faculty is not so
marked, but in the case of both singing and whistling the observers
found a curious difficulty in localising the sound. That it is
produced by her throat and lips may be inferred from the
fact that movements of her larynx have been observed during
the singing, and all attempts to produce whistling whilst her
lips were held have failed. But the sound often appeared to
come from a place about three or four feet from the ascer-
tained position of the medium's head. Of this phenomenon
the experimenters have no explanation to offer. It may be
compared with the difficulty experienced in localising raps
(see below).
Another phenomenon which frequently occurs is the appear-
ance of lights. Of these no satisfactory explanation is at
present forthcoming. As they always appear in close proximity
to the medium and only when her hands are not controlled,
and as a smell of phosphorus has been observed, the pre-
sumption must be that, like the other phenomena, they are
produced by normal means. But attempts to trace the material
employed have so far failed, nor have the experimenters been
able to reproduce the effects observed by means of such pre-
parations of phos^jhorus as Miss Burton might be supposed to
have at her disposal On several occasions Miss Burton was
carefully searched ^ before the seance, she was dressed in clothes
specially provided, and her hands were washed. Nothing sus-
picious was discovered and the lights occurred as usual. The
only incident which appears to offer any indication as to how
this phenomenon is produced occurred at one of the earlier
^ The method of searching, which was thorough, is described in detail ; Mrs.
Milton took no part in it.
Nov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 145
sittings. " Dr. Smyth suspected that she might have matches in
her mouth, and suddenly seized her and forced her mouth open,
finding the saliva saturated with phosphorescent light, and it
ran out into her lap, still showing the light in her lap. But
he did not find a trace of a match in her mouth and no
evidence that anything else had been prepared for the situa-
tion." On the occasions when Miss Burton was searched, her
mouth also was examined and nothing suspicious was found.
But the examination presumably took place in the light. It
would have been interesting to examine her mouth in the
dark both before the seance and during the production of lights
to see whether any trace of phosphorescence could be found.
Another phenomenon upon which the experimenters came to
no certain conclusion is the production of raps. These were
very frequent, instructions as to the manner of conducting the
seance being given in this way. Professor Hyslop is inclined
to think that they are supernormal in origin on account of
" the versatility with which they were produced and apparently
located in different places, either spontaneously or at request."
He relates that once raps were heard, which he and Mrs.
Milton independently located at a distance of ten or twelve
feet from the medium, and on another occasion whilst he was
standing by the window, six feet from Miss Burton, raps
were located on the sill ; he could see Miss Burton distinctly,
and detected no motion of her hands or feet. He experi-
mented with raps normally produced under similar circum-
stances, and found no such error of location as must be
assumed in the case of the trance raps, unless we ascribe
them to some supernormal physical agency. The presumption
must be that the effect was due to some sensory illusion on the
part of the observers as to the locality of the sound. But as
the case stands at present no certain inference can be drawn.
Miss Burton has also produced whilst in trance a considerable
amount of automatic writing, some of which is of interest from
a psychological aspect, but not provably beyond wdiat may be
explained by coincidence and subconscious memory.
If we accept the conclusion of the investigators as to the
genuineness of Miss Burton's trance—and it seems hardly possible
that they should have been mistaken on this point—the case
raises several interesting psychological problems. It is evident
14G Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., I9il.
that wheu in trance Miss Burton is perfectly aware of the
fraudulent nature of her phenomena. On one occasion '
the
controls ' were asked to stop and start the phonograph " under
test conditions;' that is to say, when Miss Burton's hands and
feet were held. After some unsuccessful attempts this was
done, whereupon Professor Hyslop called for the light, " and at
once there began a vigorous struggle on the part of Miss
Burton to get free. I managed to hold her, and when the
light was turned up . . . there on the key of the machine
was one of the pieces of rope which usually lies on the
table, tied in a knot, and probably put under the armpits
for pulling and relaxing it suitably to start and stop the
machine." Miss Burton's left hand had been free for a short
time just before the phenomenon occurred, and she had evidently
used this opportunity to attach the rope. Her struggle to
free herself makes it almost certain that she was aware of
what she had done, and wished to remove the rope before
it could be seen. Again, if we suppose that the lights are
produced by any normal means, preparations must be made
before the sittings. There is some reason for thinking that
Miss Burton occasionally lapses into trance at unexpected
times, and it may be then that she procures the required
materials.
But the whole question of the relation between Miss
Burton's various mental states is by no means clear at present.
Professor Hyslop thinks that there is evidence of what he
calls " subliminal honesty." He mentions as an indication of
this that, although when Miss Burton's hands were held,
" there were constant automatic efforts to obtain their release,"
the hands would be voluntarily restored to control " It is
certain," he says, "from the repeated efforts to do things
honestly and under test conditions, that at least one, or some
of her secondary personalities, are perfectly honest, and we can
escape the hypothesis of outside agencies inspiring automatic
actions to do them only by supposing that one of these
secondary personalities is tricky wlien the others are honest."
It appears to me that such expressions as Professor Hyslop
uses suggest a much more complete " differentiation of
personality " than there is evidence to show exists in the
present case. Phenomena similar to that which Professor
Kov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 147
Hyslop describes in regard to Miss Burton's hands, may be
observed in the case of persons whose psychological condition
is normal, when they are trying to break themselves of an
acquired habit. In proportion as the attention is concentrated
or relaxed, the habit will be checked or will assert itself.
Now, ex hi/pothcsi, Miss Burton, when in a " hysterical" condition,
has formed a habit of producing physical phenomena fraudu-
lently, but her normal self is honest. According to the
report of the investigators, the depth of the trance varies,
and sometimes during the sittings the medium appears not
to be in trance at all. Under these circumstances, it is to
be expected that there should be alternations between " normal
"
honesty and " hysterical " fraud. Professor Hyslop's theory
seems to imply that there is a complete separation between
Miss Burton's normal self and the " trance personalities." If he
has evidence to prove this supposition, which, from the nature
of the case, seems an unlikely one, this is not apparent from
the report.
But however that may be, the phenomena are certainly
worth careful study, as an instance of the way in which faculties
may be subconsciously developed. It is unfortunate that
there was no opportunity for scientific investigation of the
case during its early stages. It would have been interesting
to note the process of development. Would it not be possible
to repair this omission to some extent by suggesting new types
of phenomena to be produced, and noting what response, if
any, is obtained ?
Professor Hyslop calls attention in his report to the many
difficulties which beset investigators in such a case as this,
and if we take these difiiculties into account it is not surpris-
ing that many questions should be left unanswered. But
it is greatly to be hoped that further investigation may be
possible, especially with a view to determining the precise
nature and extent of the hyperaesthetic faculties possessed by
Miss Burton in trance, and, secondly, to determine whether
there is any evidence of supernormal physical powers, e.g.
in regard to the production of raps or lights. A clear answer
to these questions might be of great interest as throwing
light upon the various problems presented by other alleged
mediumistic phenomena.

REVIEW.
Psychical Research. By Peofkssor W. F. Barrett, F.KS. ("Home
Universit}' Library of Modern Knowledge." Williams & Norgate,
London, 1911. Pp. 255. Price Is. net).
At this era, it is extremely pertinent that a little book on Psychical
Research, written by a man of high repute who is a veteran Re-
searcher and has had exceptional opportunity of acquiring first-hand
acquaintance with the subject, should find a place in the "Home
University Library of Modern Knowledge." In Professor Barrett's
opinion the Society has reached a definite and critical point in its
history, and it is well that some information as to its jjurpose should
once more be presented in a popular shape to a public which still
has but a confused notion of its aims and work.
Perhaps for serious educative purposes the earlier chapters are the
most useful and admirable in the note they strike ; the average man
or woman takes no observation, has piobably no suspicion of the
powers which lie beneath the surface within the personality, and of
which, in these chapters, examples and demonstrations are given ; the
result of this ignorance being that inexplicable occurrences are dismissed
with a shrug of the shoulders by the incredulous, and by the credulous
are promptly relegated to the agency of spirits—^just as do races of a
low degree of development, with whatever in the physical world they
cannot understand. To have it proved that a part of these events, at
least, certainl}^ spring from unrecognised faculties within ourselves is,
even wlien only simple things such as the jjenchde and planchette are in
cpiestion, a step on the way towards a point of view at once more
intelligent and more interested. At the same time, the philosophic
attitude of mind, which in face of mystery sets about first and fore-
most to seek a cause within the realm of nature, is not likely to be
acceptable to all. There are many who, separating habitually the
supernatural from the sphere of human activity, find in that division
itself support to their religious faith. That the great need in average
men and women is an education in the nature of proof may be
obvious ; but unfortunately there are many who do not desire that
things which appear obscure and miraculous should be brought into
the light of every day ; on the contrary, as the Jews of yore, they
demand a "sign." That wonder may lurk close to them in the
field and on the roadside, in the street and hy the hearth, is not
native to their ideas ; the " sign " must be something outside the
course of nature, and in their estimation would fail of its purpose if
proved not to be supernatural and tamely brought into order under
Nov., 1911. Revieiv. 149
law. For that word supernatural, Professor Barrett would substitute
supernormal, —the term, originated by Mr. Myers, which is generally
used in the publications of the Society ;
indeed, a minor, yet most
excellent, work of the Society lies in the correction of loose and
misleading expressions, stereotyped into our tongue by an original
ignorant misuse of a good word.
A chapter in the book specially interesting is that on Thought-
transference, particularly in reference to the Misses Creery. In this
connection, Professor Barrett remarks that " freshness of interest . . .
appears essential to success," and that "the best results Avere obtained
. . . when there was no weariness or anxiety for success." [The italics
are added.] This is an important statement. May we not enlarge
its meaning and extend its application ? More than once it has
occurred to the present writer that any conscious attempt towards
the exercise of uncommon psychical power may be gradually de-
structive of it, and mislead the mind. To discover in oneself an
occult gift tends almost inevitably towards efforts that perhaps over-
strain it. Perhaps this might lend an initial explanation of the frauds
of mediums, of the apparently irreconcilable facts in the histories of
some of them. It is the experience of the present writer that in
these gifts is something elusive, furtive, delicate and shy—something
that giving itself slips away again and will endure no constraint.
"Life loves no looker-on at her great game."
And those who think to steal a march upon her, should beware.
Ought not all habitual experimenters, in spite of unimpeachable moral
character, to proceed warily, holding themselves a little in suspicion ?
An eagerness and " anxiety for success " grows with success ; and
possibly this anxiety once admitted into the mind may vitiate the
result, without coming within measurable distance of "collusion on
the part of those concerned."
If a small criticism on a delightful little book may be permitted,
it would seem that, here and there, Professor Barrett forsakes his
own vigilant standard and the unbiassed mind. As, for example,
when he speaks of something, appearing in the script of an automatic
writer, of a type which was " wholly alien to the character of my
friend." This is a warm-hearted tribute which we entirely respect
and credit. But is it not set down a little too lightly 1 For after
all, what is a "character"? Is it anything more than an uncertain
shape thrown up into relief from an immense incalculable background
unknown even to the possessor and in itself unfathomable by human
powers? It is not only "clouds of glory" we trail with us when we
150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., i9ii.
come. An element of sturdy .scepticism is not to be despised or
resented. We human beings are too much the victims of unguessed
influences, of unforeseen impulse and incredible negligences, to venture
to be certain of ourselves—or of others.

fessor Barrett in accounting for the phenomena in Enniscorthy,
attested to by Mr. Devereux and myself, in July, 1910. He says:
" Mr. Murphy knew pretty well what phenomena to expect." I
confess I did expect to witness some phenomenal occurrence, but I
also went to the house in Court Street convinced that I would
detect fraud or trickery of some kind, and that I might possibly be
the means of exposing it. My companion, Mr. Owen Devereux, was
even more full of this idea than I was, he being up to that night a
confirmed unbeliever in the possibility of producing sounds or mani-
festations by any other than the ordinary human or scientific agencies.
Major Moore must have a poor opinion of my powers of observation
if he believes that I could be imposed upon in the simple way he
describes. He takes it for granted that I would sit in the room
within three feet of Randall's bed and not detect the gyrations
necessary for removing the clothing by the method assumed by him.
Again the Major assumes that " Randall lies down in bed disposing
of the bedclothes as he likes." Now Randall did not "dispose of
the bedclothes as he liked." My first act on entering that room
that night was to pull everything off the bed and scatter them
about the floor. We [Mr. Devereux and myself] even turned up
the mattress. We then " dressed " the bed in the ordinary way,
laying on sheet, blankets, pillow, etc., just as a housemaid would do.
The boys got into bed without ever disturbing the clothes from the
way we disposed of them. Every one knows that there is no real
darkness at that time of year ;
any twisting or convulsions of the
body or movements of the hands would have been too easily dis-

cernible. Another point : the silence (after the candle was extin-
guished and conversation ceased) was intense. I defy any one, even
Major Moore himself, to lie in bed in a still room and even only
move his toes beneath the bedclothes without making sufficient noise
to attract the attention of a watcher sitting three feet from his
bed. Again the clothes did not actually " go over the foot of the
bed " as described by Major Moore. They went off diagonally, as I
explained to Professor Barrett the day he visited Enniscorthy. The
Major says I attach too much importance to the fact that " the
clothes were actuallj' going under the bed, as if the wind was
blowing them under it." The loose ends of the sheets or blankets
were never at any time within reach of RandalVs hands, even if he sat
ripright in bed, a thing he could not possibly do without attracting
the attention of my companion and myself. The clothes went off
the bed diagonally, that is over the left-hand bottom corner ; and
instead of going under the bed from the bottom, they went under
from the side, going about two feet from the point perpendicular
to the edge of the bed. From this it will be apparent that if
Randall was the agent, he should reach over the right-hand side of
the bed and pass his hand along the bottom to within two feet of
the outer edge or half under the bed. [But] the right-hand side of
PumdalVs bed was pushed uj) close against the ivall that divided Mr.
Redmond's room from that of his lodgers. The " pin " theory is too
ridiculous to give it a moment's thought. Whilst I was "searching for
strings or wires," my companion was watching every movement on
the part of Randall.
Again, on the second occasion, the Major says that when Mr.
Murphy had the adjustment of the clothes on the bed, Randall could
not repeat the first performance. [He could do it] just as easily,
because, as stated already, it was I who adjusted the clothes on
both occasions. Now the Major is driven to resort to another cause
to account for the effect of Randall being removed from the bed.
He says any wriggling that might possibly have occurred to effect
this would be concealed by the partial darkness. I think I disposed
of this argument in my challenge to Major Moore to lie in bed in
a still room and larely move his toes without making sufficient noise
to attract a watcher.
As to Randall moving [the bedstead] with a cord or rope, I am
a fairly strong man of average physique, and I would not be able
to move a bed with two boys in it in the way Major Moore suggests.
Randall is a mere stripling—how could he do it? One of the

castors was missing, and the uncastored leg tore a little rut along
the boards in its movement round the room. I myself saw this
mark on the boards of the floor of the bedroom.
[In regard to] Randall's apparent nervousness, —I may call it sheer
terror, —if [he] were carrying on [such] a scheme that night, it is
much more likely that his condition would cause him to bungle
the whole thing rather than that he should successfully accomplish
it. Nothing short of sheer fright could produce the profuse per-
spiration and trembling, frightened condition in which I saw Randall
on that night.
Randall and Sinnott were two simple youths just up from the
country ; never previously (to use a favourite expression in this part
of the country) " away from their mothers' apron strings." This
is especially true of Randall. He is a candid, straightforward youth
with a good countenance denoting intelligence. Is it probable that
[he] could carry out a system of scheming and deceive two men
in their sober senses who went there extremely suspicious of him?
I may add that Mr. Devereux and myself are life-long total abstainers.

[In justice to Mr. Murphy we insert his reply to the criticisms of
Major Moore in the previous number of the Journal. Like most
inexperienced investigators, he seems both to underestimate the
difficulty of exact observation in a poor light and to assume that
where he did not detect any fraud, it could not have existed.

THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE IN CEOSS-
COREESPONDENCES.
By Helen de G. Vereall.
In criticisms of recent reports on automatic writing, it is some-
times contended that too much ingenuity has been exercised
in the discovery of supposed cross-correspondences, and that by
an exercise of similar ingenuity similar connexions could be
found in any group of such rambling and disjointed writings
as those with which these reports are concerned. In that case
chance alone might be sufficient to account for the resemblances
between the scripts. A careful and unprejudiced examination
of the evidence could not fail, I think, to convince any reader
that this explanation will not cover the whole ground. Neverthe-
less, it seemed to us worth while to try the experiment of
producing some pieces of writing in imitation of automatic script,
with a view to seeing what connexions, if any, could be dis-
covered between them.
The method of experiment made it practically certain that
any connexions that occurred must have been purely accidental,
and two questions arose in regard to them: (I) How many
instances could be found in which the same topic occurred in
two or more scripts produced at approximately the same time ;
and (2) whether these coincidences were such as to suggest the
same sort of deliberate purpose or design in the selection and
fitting together of topics as has been claimed for the more
complex of the cross-correspondences.
154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, lOil.
The result of a single experiment could not in any case
be conclusive, but if several connexions suggestive of design
had been found under circumstances in which there was good
reason for thinking that design had played no part, we should
have had to reconsider our interpretation of the complex cross-
correspondences. Apart from this possibility, it seemed that in
other ways also a comparison between scripts produced auto-
matically and non-automatically might be of interest.
The experiment was conducted on the following lines : I chose
as subjects six people, none of whom had any reason to suppose
themselves endowed with automatic faculty. In our present
ignorance of the conditions under which telepathic and kindred
mental phenomena occur, it is obvious that we cannot with
certainty exclude the influence of a supernormal agency, but in
this case the probability of such an influence has been so far
reduced that it may reasonably be ignored. Three of the writers,
A, B and C, were more or less familiar with tlie recent publica-
tions of the Society, the other three, D, E and F, were not.
All remained ignorant of one another's identity, until the con-
clusion of the experiment. To all I gave the following instruc-
tions :
Clioose any literary work with wliich you are familiar. Open it at
random. Choose from the pages at which the book opens any phrase
or word which you think suggestive. Starting from this point write
down whatever thoughts occur to you. Let your mind range as widely
as possible, so that a variety of topics may be introduced. Put down
anything that comes into your mind, even if it has no apparent
connexion with your preceding thoughts. If what occurs to you is
obviously suggested by some external circumstance, e.g. a sudden
noise, an explanatory note should be added.
Please repeat this experiment on six different occasions with six
different books.
Each piece of writing should cover about half a sheet of foolscap
paper, and should be fuUii dated (see specimen).
In the case of quotations, plea.se give references when known, and add
notes on such points—-if any—-as seem to you to require them, c.ij. if
there is some personal association between two apparently disconnected
thoughts.
Please do not show your writing to any one or talk of the experi-
ments until they are concluded.

I appended the following specimen " script " to show the sort
of document I hoped to get. . .

etc.-—(Finished at 11.40 a.m.)
My reasons for suggesting tliis method of procedure were
that (1) I wanted to give tlie writings a literary trend, since
cross-correspondences have been mainly upon literary topics ;
(2) I wanted to give some scope to the personal taste and
knowledge of the writers, but at the same time I did not want
their choice of passages to be entirely deliberate, because in that
case they would have been very likely, consciously or uncon-
sciously, to select or avoid certain topics according to some
preconceived theory of what would be suitable for the purpose
in view.
One point that is brought out clearly by the results obtained
is the great differences that exist between one mind and another
in their faculty of ranging freely over a large field of more or
less closely associated topics. I hud, in my own case, that, when
I switch off my attention, so to speak, my mind " wanders
"
naturally, and it will sometimes light in succession upon topics
between which 1 can detect no association. The connecting
links, supposing that they exist, must be purely sub-conscious.
But it seems that all minds do not work on these lines. The
writer whom I here call C evidently had great difficulty in
getting her mind away from the original starting-point. Her
scripts almost all revolve closely about this leading idea ; to one
of them she appends a note, " unless I cudgelled my brains a

little, no '
loose ideas '
would occur to me, so I find it hard to get
anything at all." Mr. .^. A. Hill, who has lately tried a similar
experiment, says that two friends of his, although " well-
acquainted with the form of genuine script," could get no
results whatever :
" Somehow they seem to be watching their
own minds too closely and the mind shuts itself up." Perhaps
in these cases there is, as it were, a more complete barrier between
the conscious and subconscious mind, so that ideas cannot emerge
into consciousness except by an effort of tlie will, which, having
once seized upon an idea, clings to it.
If we compare these imitation scripts, as I shall call them,
with real, i.e. automatic, script, several differences may be
observed.
(1) In the imitation scripts, the association between one idea
and another is usually apparent, i.e. having been formed in one
conscious mind it can be instantly perceived by another conscious
mind. But in automatic script this is not the case. There is
frequently no apparent connexion between the various topics
alluded to in a single piece of writing.
(2) This predominance of the conscious mind explains also the
fact that the imitation scripts are more clearly traceable to the
contemporary thoughts of the writers. Allusions are made to
books which they have lately read, or to approaching public
events, e.g. the Coronation, the Parliament Bill, etc. It is
noticeable that automatic writing as a rule shows little or no
trace of what may be occupying the conscious mind of the
automatist at the moment, and allusions to public events are
rare. These characteristics may be partly due to self-suggestion,
as obviously such allusions would be of little use for evidential
purposes.
(3) In the imitation scripts, although the range of ideas is
equally wide, there is much less variety of form. They have
rather the effect of a summary or of rough notes.
With many of the variations of form which are to be found
in real scripts we need not here concern ourselves, but some
are important, because they involve variations in emphasis.
Particular words or phrases may be emphasised
(a) by repetition (see e.g. Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXII., p. 97,
where the idea of laurel is repeated in various forms
eight times in Mrs. Verrall's script).
Dec, 1911. Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 157
(h) by a claim of success made in the script or a direct
statement that a certain '
message ' is important (see
e.g. ProG. S.P.B., Vol. XXIL, p. 228, " F. W. H. M.
has sent the message through at last ").
(c) by variations of handwriting or type (see e.g. Proc.
S.P.R., Vol. XXIV., p. 207, where the word 'yellow'
is thus emphasised both in Mrs. Holland's and in
Mrs. Verrall's scripts).
{cl) by statements that a word or phrase is intended as a
cross-correspondence. Numerous illustrations of this
may be found, especially in Mrs. Piper's script.
Emphasis of one kind or another, especially of the last
kind, has therefore been an important factor in the evidence
for design in cross-correspondences. In her second report on
Mrs. Holland's script {Proc. S.P.P., Vol. XXIV., p. 203) Miss
Johnson says :
" in most of the cases which I have here
counted as cross-correspondences, the passages in the scripts
are marked out by some phrase which seems meant to call
attention to them, such as '
Eemember the word and the
date '
; or by some device such as the repetition of a word,
or its being written in specially large letters. It is here as
if the intelligence guiding the script—whether it be the sub-
liminal self of the automatist or some external intelligence
—
is putting up a signal to apprise us of its intentions ; and
the signal greatly reduces the probability that the coincidence
is only due to chance." In the imitation scripts, on the other
hand, we find no emphasis except by repetition, and of that
only a few clear instances. Each word or topic has an almost
equal claim to consideration, and the probability of chance-coin-
cidences is thereby increased. This increase it is impossible
to estimate exactly, a rough comparison being all that the
case admits, but evidently the larger the field of material,
the larger the scope for coincidence must be.
Cross-correspondences, again, vary immensely in their com-
plexity, and I have found nothing in the imitation scripts
which can be compared with the more complex, e.g. " Light
in West" (Proc. S.P.B., Vol. XXIL, p. 24:1) or "Sevens" (Proc.
S.P.P., Vol. XXIV, p. 222). Even in cross-correspondences
of the simplest type there is always at least one other factor
in addition to a coincidence of topic. This factor may be
158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, l9il.
(1) coincidence of date (see e.g. Froc. S.P.B., Vol. XXIV., p. 215,
"The Blue Flower"), (2) coincidental allusions to a second
topic not connected with the first by any obvious association
of ideas (see e.g. Froc. S.F.F., Vol. XXIV., p. 186, "Exile and
Moore "), (3) the intervention of a third automatist (see e.g.
Froc. S.F.B., Vol. XXIV., p. 207, "Yellow"), (4) the fact that
other cross-correspondences have occurred in the same pieces
of script, though not necessarily between the same automatists
(see e.g. Froc S.P.B., Vol. XXII., p. 87, "Giant and Dwarf").
In so far as it was possible I have applied this two-factor
standard in the analysis of the imitation scripts. With this
limitation I have included every coincidence that seemed at all
worth counting. If I also am accused of showing too much
ingenuity, I shall willingly plead guilty to the charge, for of
course my object is to weight the evidence for chance in
the case of the cross-correspondences.
Analysis of Scripts.
As I have stated above, the whole number of scripts pro-
duced was thirty-six. All those which I discuss are given in
full in the Appendix, including at least one specimen from each
writer, so that the varieties of style, etc., may there be judged.
Here I only quote relevant extracts, but wlierever any omissions
have been made they are marked. The whole period covered
by the experiment was about two months and a half, from the
first script on April 5, 1911, to the last on June 21, 1911.
As might have been expected, I found in the scripts several
allusions to the same matters of contemporary interest; e.g. four
writers refer to Women's Suffrage. Such coincidences are
obviously produced by the same normal cause acting on several
different minds ;
therefore, since they are not to be attributed
either to chance or to a supernormal agency, they do not
concern us here. I also found many rather vague coin-
cidences of topic, such as we might expect between people
sharing, to some extent, the same literary interests. If, in
accordance with the scheme that I had adopted, some corro-
borative factor were to be sought, the most obvious to look
for here was a coincidence of date. There are six coin-
cidences of date, two pieces of script having been produced by
different writers on April 9, 1.3, 21, and 30, and May 4
Dec, 1911. Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 159
and 9. Between the scripts of Ap. 9 I can trace no con-
nexion, nor between those of Ap. 13. The scripts written
on the four remaining dates exhibit certain coincidences which
I will now describe. For convenience of reference I have
numbered the scripts A 1 to 6, B 1 to 6, etc. The opening
phrase of each script, i.e. the phrase selected by the writer
(see above, p. 154), is printed in italics. For the purposes of
this paper these phrases may be regarded as an integral part of
the script. For, since there was no communication between
the writers during the experiment, the fact of selection does
not add in any way to the probability of coincidences.
I. Hell and Virgiliax Hexameters.
A 5. Ap. 21, 1911.
Trochee trips from long to short ^
—trips him up and sends him flying
off to Hell a Manichee.- . . . Lucretian hexameters would not do
it nor Virgilian for the matter of that—it is entirely a question of
polyschematism and polypragmosyny will not be an efficient sub-
stitute. . . .
B3. Ap. 21, 1911.
Long is the ivay and hard that out of Hell leads up to Heaven.^
Facilis descensus Averni Sed revocare gradum.'* Flectere si nequeo
superos, Acheronta movebo."' Lethe. Poppies. Bees round the
lihes.'* . . . College days. Eheu fugaces.^
A, starting with a quotation from Coleridge, passes imme-
diately to the idea of Hell. Later on he alludes to Virgilian
hexameters.
B begins his script with a quotation about Hell. The idea
is twice repeated (Averni, Acheronta) in the form of Virgilian
hexameters. The allusion to Virgil is further emphasised by
reference to '
bees round the lilies.' We have here a coin-
cidence of date and a double coincidence of topic, '
Hell ' and
'
Virgilian hexameters.' The coincidence of the allusion to
Virgil is weakened by the fact that A and B are both
classical scholars. On the other hand, the closing words of
B's script, " College days. Eheu fugaces," are not inappropriate
1 Coleridge. ^ Browning, The Spanish Cloister. ^ Milton, Paradise Lost.
^Virgilian allusions; "Easy is tlie descent to Avernus, but to retrace our
steps [is not easy]." "If I cannot persuade the powers of Heaven, I will

160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, I9il.
when we consider that A and B were college friends. Possibly
A's remark that " it is entirely a question of polyschematism
(multiplicity of form) and polypragmosyny (meddlesomeness) will
not be an efficient substitute " is intended to indicate an
intelligently-devised, complex cross-correspondence ! But the
allusion in that case is obscure and scarcely justified by the facts.
II. Dawn and Sleep.
B6. April 30, 1911.
Night the shadow of light
And life the shadow of death.'^
A literary paradox, but the idea is not new. rt? olSev d to ^r^v

Consciousness is remembrance. Sleep and unconsciousness. . . .
In B's script the most prominent ideas are death and sleep,
but dawn is also mentioned, " the one horse dawn." In E's
script dawn is prominent and sleep is mentioned once. Death
is not alluded to, unless we consider it implied in the two
quotations from Adoncds, the secondary title of which is A71
Megy on the Death of John Keats. Since dawn and sleep
are ideas which might naturally occur in conjunction, the
coincidence would have been hardly worth mentioning, if no
confirmation of it could be found. But E's script of Ap. 28,
1911 (immediately preceding the script of Ap. 30) contains the
following passage
:
. . . He does but deceive you with his filed tongue.'^ Ulysses.

The dim-clustered isles in the blue sea.^ . . . 5td XafXTrporaTov

This script is linked with that of Ap. 30 by the fact that
it also contains a quotation from Pauline, in which moreover
the idea of dawn is implicit. The passage runs
:
" Yet say I never morn broke clear as those,
On the dim-clustered isles in the blue sea."^
The script of Ap. 28 also alludes to Ulysses and contains
a quotation from Euripides, so that regarding this script as
linked by internal evidence with the succeeding script of
Ap. 30, we have a correspondence between both of these and
B's script of Ap. 30 in regard to the ideas of dawn, sleep,
Ulysses and Euripides.
III. Moonlight.
"Death and his brother Sleep" (see above, B 6, Ap. 30)
are also alluded to in C 2.
C2. May ^, 1911.
" When on my bed the moonlight falls. . . . The words were hard to
understand."* . . . Death and Sleep in Homer. The bronze head of
" Hypnos " [Sleep]. And all the glimmering moorland rings with
jingling bridle reins.^ . . .
The stanzas from Li Memoriam include the lines :
When in the down I sink my head,
Sleep, Death's twin brother, times my breath
;
Sleep, Death's twin brother, knows not Death,
Nor can I dream of thee as dead.
I can find no other connexion between C 2 and B 6. The
coincidence is perhaps slightly strengthened by the fact that
C 2 is the first piece of script written by C after Ap. 30,
1 Browning, Pauline.
-Euripides, Medea; "Stepping delicately through serenest air."
''The quotation from Pauline in the earliest script contains implicitly the
idea of dawn, explicitly alluded to in the next script ; the second quotation
leads up to the idea of sleep.
^Tennyson, In Memoriam, LXVII.-LXIX. C has proceeded on a slightly
different system from the other writers, heading her scripts with quotations
of some length, not mere phrases.

162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, I9il.
the date of B 6, her previous script being dated Ap. 11, so
that the allusion to In Memoriam may be said to have emerged
at the first opportunity.
Moreover C 2 contains a point of connexion with E 4,
written on the same day, and the two coincidences in C 2,
—
(«) with B 6, (b) with E 4,—may be regarded as corroborating
one another.
£4. May i, 1911.
Moonlight cold which maketh mad.'^ The moon on the sea shore
making the sand grey. ...
C 2 begins
:
When on my bed the moonlight falls,
and the stanzas quoted include the lines,
The mystic glory swims away ;
From off my bed the moonlight dies.
In both scripts therefore—C 2 and E 4—it is the opening
phrase that introduces the idea of moonlight. There is no further
connexion between these two scripts, but E4 (May 4) contains
the words " A gipsy with fair hair. Gipsy dress," and C's next
script (C 3, May 10) opens with a quotation from Borrow's
Lavengro and turns entirely on the idea of gipsies. I should
not have thought this last coincidence worth mentioning at all
if it had not been for the strong emphasis on " gipsies " in
C's script. The word " moonlight " - only occurs in one other
script, D 2, where it occurs twice.
D2. Ap. 13, 1911.
. . . People driving home by moonlight. . . . What does moon-
light do to people ?
The question with which this script closes is appropriately
answered by the opening phrase of E 4 on May 4, " Moonlight
cold which maketh mad." The only other connexion that I can
see between D 2 (Ap. 13) and E 4 is that E 4 contains the
phrase " a road in Sussex," and D 2 was written in Sussex,
as were all D's scripts. There is no other allusion to Sussex
in any of the scripts.
1 Browning, Paracelsus.
" The word '
moon ' occurs in two of B's scripts, which do not appear to be
otherwise connected with the scripts discussed iu this section.
Dec, 1911. Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 163
Summing up then, we have in B 6 (Ap. 30) an allusion
to " Death and his brother Sleep," which forms part of a
correspondence with E's script of the same date. On May
4, C, in the next piece of script written by her after
Ap. 30, alludes to " Sleep, Death's twin brother," and this
script is connected through the idea of " moonlight " with
E's script of the same date. Or, putting it in another way, B 6
and C 2, which are connected with one another by the allusion
to " Death and his brother sleep," are each connected with
a contemporary script by E. " Moonlight " which forms the
connecting link between C and E is also referred to in D 2,
the closing words of which are in the form of a question
appropriately answered by the opening words of E 4.
IV. " OxE OF OUR Conquerors."
E5. May 9, 1911.
A pure polar aristocracy inflicting the woes of tuintriness upon us.^
L'lle des Pingouins. The Budget of 1909. ... A night of May
leaning upon June is no more than a deliberate wink.-
F4. May 9, 1911.
Mark me; it will all end in satire upon povr old England.^
Juvenal. . . .
E 5 and F 4, both written on May 9, both quote from
Meredith's One of Our Conquerors. The two quotations are
not from the same part of the book, and there is no connexion
of thought between them. The only other link between these
two scripts—a slight one—is that E's quotation turns on the
notion of satire upon England, the idea of satire being repeated
in the allusion to Juvenal. E refers to L'Me des Pingouins,'^
an example of satire, and in particular of satire upon France.
E 5 opens and closes with a quotation from Meredith, the
opening quotation being from Bcauchamp's Career. This novel
is also mentioned in E's first script, part of which has been
already quoted (see p. 160). It ends with the words "The
love scene in '
Lord Ormont and his Aminta.' Sailor Nevil
Beauchamp. A midshipman." E 1 may therefore be regarded
1 Meredith, Beauchamp's Career.

as connected by internal evidence with E 5. The only possible
connexion I can trace between E 1 and F 4 is that they both
refer implicitly to Henry VIII., E 1 in the words
:
. . . The destruction of monasteries. Robert Aske. He does but
deceive you with his filed tongue. . . ?
and F 4 in the words
:
. . . Wolsey. Richard 2 Cromwell being mixed up with Oliver
Cromwell. " Had I but served my God as I have served my
king." . .
.3
The force of the coincidence is diminished in this case by the
fact that (a) F wrote two other scripts on May 9, which
have no connexion with E 5. F 4 is the earliest of the three
scripts written on that day; the second, F 5, is dealt with
below ;
{h) E mentions Meredith in one other script and F
mentions him in two other scripts, besides those quoted above.

There is no coincidence of dates between these scripts,
but there are three or perhaps four coincidences of topic.
They both open with a quotation describing how unhappiness
may produce the same physical effects as old age ; A's quotation
is from Byron, whom he quotes again in connexion with the sea
in a later passage of the script ; F's quotation is from Scott, but
is immediately followed by a quotation from Byron about the
sea. Both writers make other allusions to the sea and ships.
There is perhaps a further connexion through the idea of suicide.
In F's script suicide is mentioned with some emphasis
:
. . . suicide. The man who meets me periodically in Holborn and
asks the way to the river. '
One more unfortunate '
i
etc. Is it
right to rescue a suicide 1 . . .
A's script contains two allusions which might easily be
associated with the idea of suicide.
(a) "The hemlock. Socrates."
The fact that the suicide was in this case compulsory weakens
the connexion of thought with F.
(b) Troutbeck.
Mr. John Troutbeck is well known as the Coroner for West-
minster. If F's acquaintance in Holborn had drowned himself
in the river (clearly F credited him with this purpose) it would
most probably have fallen to Mr. Troutbeck's lot to hold the
inquest over his remains.
Conclusion,
The above are the only coincidences which seem to me worth
recording. Other very slight connexions occur, but they do not
even approximate to the standard of the simplest cross-corres-
pondences. The question now arises : is there anything in these
coincidences which could possibly be interpreted as indicating
intelligence or design ?
In the Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script {Proc. S.P.R.,
Yol. XXIV., pp. 258 ff.) Miss Johnson divides cross-correspond-
ences into two kinds : those of the target-type, where we find
more or less successful shots at the same idea in several scripts,
and those in which the scripts " present the appearance ... of a
mosaic, . . . showing unmistakeable traces of a pattern, and that
^ The poem describes a girl who has drowned herself.
160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, I9ii.
pattern tilled in by several different hands, whose efforts overlap,
but each of whom contributes something different from that
contributed by any of the others." Miss Johnson goes on to
point out that " we find a number of gradations between [these
two types]."
As I have already indicated, cross-correspondences of the most
complex type, where we have " strong evidence of the design or
agency of some intelligence which was cognisant of the whole
scheme, as finally revealed," and where it is " difficult to attribute
so complete a knowledge of [the scheme] to the subliminal con-
sciousness [of any one of the automatists concerned]," are not to
be found in the imitation scripts. In their case the connexions
are mostly of the simplest " target type." The best shots perhaps
are the two allusions to One of Our Conquerors. It is a curious
coincidence that two writers should quote fi^om the same not
very widely-read novel on the same day, but it does not
suggest anything beyond chance, especially when we take into
account that both the writers in question—as is shown by their
scripts—have Meredith often in their thoughts. There is more-
over a lack of design shown in the absence of any connexion
between the two quotations, and what we may call by analogy
the attempt to introduce a second connexion through the idea of
'
satire ' must be considered a coup vicmepii. Again in the scripts
which I have analysed in §§ I., II. and V., there are coincidences,
sometimes fairly close coincidences, of topic, but there is no
evidence of design, and the scripts are in no way complementary
to one another ;
they do not contain utterances incomplete in
themselves, but forming, when united, an intelligible and coherent
whole.^
The incident most deserving the name of a cross-corre-
spondence is the one described in § III. p. 161, centring round
the idea of '
moonlight.' I do not claim for this '
cross-corre-
spondence '
that it is an ambitious effort, but it is successful
so far as it goes. Assuming, for the moment, a supernormal
agency, this agency may with some plausibility be found in
the subconscious mind of D, as a consideration of dates will
show. On Ap. 13 D's script closes with the question "What
1 Unless we admit the allusions to suicide (see above). There is no apparent
significance in the name Troiitbeck in A's script, unless it is to be considered in
connexion with F's script.
Dec , 1911. Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 167
does moonlight do to people ?
" On May 4 C and E both
begin their scripts with allusions to moonlight. Design might
be argued from the following considerations: (1) the form of
E's allusion to moonlight, which supplies the answer to D's
question ; (2) the position of the question and answer, the one
at the end, the other at the beginning of a script; (3) the
fact that the allusion to moonlight in C's script (again in the
opening words) is made through a quotation, which includes
the phrase " Sleep, Death's twin brother," one of the elements
contributing to a coincidence between two scripts of B and E
on Ap, 30; (4) the fact that the word 'moonlight' does not
occur in any other of the thirty-six scripts under consideration,
and therefore we have no irrelevant allusions to discount.
I assumed here, for the sake of argument, the intervention
of a supernormal agency ;
setting aside this assumption, as we
are bound to do according to the hypothesis upon which this
whole experiment is founded, the conclusion to be drawn from
this incident is that pure chance will occasionally give us a
fairly good '
cross-correspondence ' of a simple type. But after
all necessary discount for this possibility has been made, the
evidence for the intervention of some supernormal agency in
the production of automatic script remains but little affected.

since seeing the proofs, has told me of certain circumstances
which suggest that some of the coincidences detected by Miss
Verrall are not merely accidental, but due to telepathy. With
a view to testing this interpretation, I shall be glad if any readers
of the Journal (not only the six writers) will let me know if they
find in the scripts here printed phrases that seem to have a
special appropriateness to themselves. It is clear that if the
scripts fit the circumstances of several persons equally well,
as is perhaps not unlikely to be the case in such various and
discursive productions, this would increase the probability tliat
the appropriateness in any one case is accidental.
CASE.
P. 282. Dream.
The following case of a fulfilled prediction of death was
sent to us by Mr. Severin Lauritzen, an Associate of the
Society. The fact that Mr. Lauritzen knew of his friend's
wish to die, and often recalled the latter's remark that he
" would soon be free," detracts from the evidential force of
the premonition ; but we print the case as an instance of a
remarkable coincidence, unusually well attested.
Mr. Lauritzen writes :
HoLTK, Denmark, October list, 19 IL
I had a friend, Mr. F. F., who once in conversation said to me :
" Well, it canuot be long uow before I shall be free," meaning,
"before I shall die." About a year later I dreamt that he said to
me; ''Well, in four years I shall be free," giving no date in my
dream. He died February 11th, 1911, 11.30 a.m., from heart and
kidney trouble, 61 years old, very nearly four years and four days
after my dream.
I enclose a leaf cut from a memorandum book in which I wrote
a note of my dream a few days after its occurrence. The first few
words I translate literally :
"Sunday, February 10th, 1907. —About three days ago I dreamt
that F. F. full of joy told me that he should be free in four years." ^
'Of this contemporary note, sent to us by ]\lr. Lauritzen, we obtained au
independent translation, as follows: "Sunday, Feb. 10, 1907. About three
days ago I dreamt that F. F. expressed his joy at the prospect of being fiee
from this life in four years. There was nothing remarkable in this dream,
because F. F. had last summer quite quietly let fall the words that he hoped
soon to be set free, or something like it. . . .
174 Joxivnal of Society for Psychical Research. Uec, I9ii.
The rest of the note says only that the dream would not seem
very remarkable, because F. F. last year had remarked that he should
soon be free ; ihat another acquaintance from our college days, who
died many years ago, also appeared in the dream ; that this man
looked very strong and healthy, though when living he looked very
frail and delicate ; and that I never felt specially attached to him
and very seldom thought of him.
My dreams are of the common vague and blurred kind, but the
more I thought of this dream the more I felt impressed by it, so
in a few days it became quite clear to me that I ought to take it
down on paper. Having done this, I at once made one of my
daughters, Miss Helga Lauritzen, and my son-in-law, Mr. J. A. Kemp,
read the note and sign it. At the foot of it you will find written
Bead 10/;2 07. [Sigried] Helga Lauriten. J. A. Kemp.
The point that impressed me most was the vivid distinctness of
the information about "the four j'ears." I remember that I was
startled—even in the dream —with this distinctness, because I had
often recalled F. F.'s utterance the year before my dream, that he
should soon be free, and whenever it came into my head I found
myself adding "I wonder when."
Mr. F. F., a lonely man of ample means, never married, and lived
in a big villa at the sea shore some seventeen miles in a straight line
from my residence. He was a deep thinker, keen and witty, and
lived only for his philosophy. This was of a very original sort,
void of all prejudices, following no old grooves, and he would
prosecute his ideas " to the bitter end " in all its logical con-
secpiences. He often astonished me with the results of his pure
thinking, because they coincided in many respects with my own,
only arrived at by studying facts from psychical research. This is
a vert/ uncommon thing, I believe. Still he hated—curiously
enough—what he called Spiritism, though he knew next to nothing
of it and absolutely nothing of psychical research. He was rarely
ill and never called a physician himself. In his last illness, when
his friends forced one upon him, he treated him rather de haul en
las, to tell the truth. He astonished this physician by saying :
" I
am most curious as to finding out soon what the next life is really
like." Once he said to me and other friends assembled :
" If you
told me I was to die in ten minutes, I should die in five for joy."
Of course, I could not but think of Dr. Hodgson, who could " hardly
wait to die," hut he was a psychical researcher, F. was not. From
this you will understand that Mr. F. was no common man. I and
Dec, 1911. Case. 175
my family were the only people in all the world he felt really
attached to.
I only mention these circumstances because some will think,
perhaps, that it is somewhat significant that just this man should
figure in, or impress me in, the only dream in mij life I ever deemed
vmihij of being written down, and that this dream should turn out
to be veridical.
I add a fresh corroboration from Miss H. L. and Mr. J. A. Kemp.

We corroborate the above. The signatures on the note-book leaf
are ours. We never heard that Mr. Lauritzen ever wrote down
any other dream.
Helga Lauritzen.
J. A. Kemp.
Mr. Lauritzen sent us part of a Danish newspaper, the
'
Ncitionaltidencle, of Feb. 15, 1911, which contains an announce-
ment of the death of Mr. F. F. on Feb. 11, 1911. In reply
to a question, he wrote
:
October iSth, lOlL
You ask me whether Mr. F. knew anything about my dream.
No, nothing whatever. In more than one respect it would not
have been expedient or wise to tell him, so I took care not to do
it. And nobody else could tell him, not even the two witnesses
who signed the note in my note-book, because when I had
written the note I presented it to them in a casual way, simply
asking them to read and sign it. They thought so little of it that
they forgot all about it until I again presented it to them when
Mr. F. got dangerously ill. Only then they remembered that they
had read and signed it themselves. And in his last illness Mr. F.
admitted none of his friends to his bedside ;
only the doctor and the
women who nursed him were there. In fact I was somewhat re-
buked by all of my family that I never mentioned my dream ; if I
had, they said, they might possibly have been able to do more for
him during the last years of his life. But I don't think it would
have made any difference—" Wenn die Herren vom Rathhause
kommen, sind sie am kliigsten!" as the Gei-mans say.

SOME EECENT HYPNOTIC EXPEEIMENTS.
By professor W. F. BARRETT, F.Ii.S.
During a visit to Sweden last September, Dr. Sydney Almtz
—
who is lecturer on p.sychology at the University of Upsala, an
Hon. Associate of the S.P.E., and Hon. Sec. of the Swedish
Institute for Psychological Eesearch—kindly invited me to spend
a day or two with him in order to witness some experiments
on a good hypnotic subject who had been under his treatment.
Accordingly I went to Upsala, and heard from Dr. Alrutz
that nearly twelve months before he had cured, by means of
hypnosis, a labouring man, who had for some time previously
been incapacitated from work by a complication of hysteria and
neurasthenia with other disorders. The man was so grateful
for the wonderful and complete cure of the distressing nervous
symptoms which had been wrought and for his restoration to health
Jan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 179
and work, that he placed himself at the disposal of Dr. Alrutz
for experimental investigation, and for several naonths Dr.
Alrutz had hypnotised the man regularly.
In the course of these experiments Dr. Alrutz was led to
reconsider the theory of the older mesmerists that the analgesia,
or entire freedom from pain, which could be locally induced in the
subject, was not necessarily due to suggestion but to some specific
emanation from the fingers of the mesmeriser. Furthermore,
Dr. Alrutz believed that he had discovered that certain materials
were more or less opaque and intercepted this emanation, whilst
others were transparent and permitted it to pass freely. Metal
and glass sheets he found transparent, whilst paper, cardboard,
cotton wool, etc., were more or less opaque.
In the afternoon of September 13th Dr. Alrutz took me to
his well-equipped laboratory in the University, where he had
arranged for his subject to attend. The subject, a heavily-built
and intelligent labouring man of middle age, was placed in a
reclining chair, and Dr. Alrutz gazed into his eyes, pointing
his fingers to them, and made a few passes down the body.
In two minutes the subject was sound asleep, but in what is
called the nloi stage of hypnosis. He could hear my voice, and
answered questions Dr. Alrutz put to him ; but he did not
understand a word of English, in which language Dr. Alrutz
and I conversed.
Before being hypnotised the man had removed his coat and
turned up the shirt sleeves over each arm, and when hypnotised
Dr. Alrutz asked me to test each of his arms to see if they
were sensitive to heat and cold, pricking, etc. This I did
;
both arms appeared to be normal, and responded to these tests,
as shown by the man rubbing the spots that had been pricked
or touched with a hot body. A thick, large, black velvet
cloth, through which 1 found nothing could be seen, was then
thrown over the man's head, face and shoulders, and tucked
in so that nothing, could be seen by the subject, even if his
eyes had not been closed as they were during the hypnotic
state. Without speaking, Dr. Alrutz then fixed, by means of
a strong stand and clip, a curved sheet of zinc over the subject's
right arm ;
and, with another stand and clip, a curved sheet of
cardboard was fixed over the subject's left arm. Passes were
then silently made by Dr. Alrutz for a minute and a half from
180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.
the shoulder to the fingers of the subject's right arm, over the
zinc shield. I was then asked to test the arm again ; it was
now completely analgesic, not the slightest sensation appeared
to be experienced by the subject from pricking, tickling, or the
application of heat to his bared right arm. The left arm, which
had not been stroked, was also tested, and seemed somewhat
more sensitive than normally. Dr. Alrutz told me he usually
found that as one member of the body became analgesic, the
other corresponding member appeared to rise in sensitiveness.
Eeverse passes from fingers to shoulder were then made by
Dr. Alrutz over the subject's right arm. A curious thing was
now witnessed. The subject began rubbing his arm, and said
he now felt various pricks and other sensations, apparently
from the tests made some little time before, which he had not
felt at the time. Dr. Alrutz has found the emergence of these
sensations follows a definite order: not according to the sequence
in which the tests wei'e made. The pain sense emerges first,
then follows the cold sense, and lastly the warmth sense emerges;
and this order is followed quite independently of the order in
which the tests were previously made.
In order to test the degree of sensitiveness of the subject
to the pain sense, Dr. Alrutz has invented an ingenious instru-
ment which he terms the " Algesimeter," or measurer of pain.
He has sent me one of the instruments to exhibit to-day, and
it may be useful for our medical section. It consists of a
needle point protruding from what looks like a small silver
pencil case. The point is pressed forward by a light spring,
the pressure of which can be accurately adjusted by means of
a screw. This pressure can be made to vary from 2 grammes
(about 30 grains), which produced no sensation of a prick on
my own arm, to a pressure of 6 grammes or more (about 100
grains), which caused a painful jDrick.
The left arm encircled by the cardboard shield was now
stroked for one and a half minute by Dr. Alrutz, the passes
being made as before in silence, from the shoulder to the fingers,
and about two inches above the encircling screen. Testing
this arm after the passes had been made, I found it retained
its normal sensitiveness to the various tests applied.
According to Dr. Alrutz, this showed that the metal screen
was transparent to some force that passed from his fingers to
Jan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 181
the subject, and produced analgesia, whilst the cardboard screen
was opaque, as no such effect was produced by similar passes
down the left arm. Unknown to the subject, I quietly changed
the position of the two screens, and asked Dr. Alrutz to repeat
the experiment. On testing each arm again I found the results
corresponded to the changed position : the left arm was now
analgesic, and the right arm having the cardboard over it was
sensitive.
By reverse passes, and blowing on the arms, Dr. Alrutz
reduced both to a similar condition, and a glass screen was
substituted for the metal. This also appeared to transmit the
force, for the arm beneath was rendered analgesic. Dr. Alrutz
then asked me to make the passes down the subject's arm, and
note the results obtained ;
they corresponded to those previously
described.
The subject was then awakened, and as he had to return
to his work, we postponed further experiments till the evening,
when he came to Dr. Alrutz's house about 9 p.m. He was
first allowed to have a long hypnotic sleep on the sofa, and after
some three-quarters of an hour was awakened greatly refreshed.
He was then placed on an arm-chair and rehypnotised by
Dr. Alrutz, an opaque, large black velvet cloth being again
thiown over his head and shoulders. To avoid any possible
information being conveyed by air currents or warmth, a thick
piece of plate glass was now fixed over his extended right
hand, and above the glass Dr. A. stroked his middle finger silently,
the subject being quite unaware of what he was doing. Testing
each finger by Dr. Alrutz's needle (algesimeter), I found every
finger sensitive, except the middle finger which had been stroked.
This was absolutely analgesic to the most severe tests. Upward
passes were then silently made over the finger, sensitiveness
was at once restored, and the subject began rubbing his finger.
It was very curious to observe the apparent emergence of
sensations caused by pricks made perhaps two or three minutes
previously. Again we tried the metal and cardboard screens,
with precisely similar results as in the earlier experiments.
Dr. Alrutz considered that this established the transparency
of certain substances and the opacity of others to the mesmeric
influence, and as a proof stuck a strip of card nearly four
inches wide on to the middle and upper surface of the metal
182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.
screen.^ On stroking the arm over which the metal screen
with cardboard strip had been fixed, Dr. Alrutz showed me
how completely the strip of card had shielded that part of the
arm, which under the card remained sensitive, whilst the rest
covered by the metal alone was insensitive. The subject of
course could not see what was being done, and was unaware
of the nature of the experiment.
I was, however, extremely doubtful of Dr. Alrutz's theory,
and believed the results he had shown me were really due to
some suggestion unconsciously conveyed to the subject. Accord-
ingly I asked Mrs. Alrutz, who had been present at our last
experiments, to take the metal screen outside the room and
fix the cardboard strip in some fresh position, on the under
side of the metal screen, so that neither Dr. Alrutz nor
I should know where it was. This was done, and the screen
fetched by me from outside, Mrs. Alrutz meanwhile having
retired to her own room at another part of the house. The
screen was again fixed over the arm of the subject and stroked
as before. It was then removed laterally so as to expose the
arm, which was then tested as before with the needle. No
difference in sensitiveness was found in any part of the arm ;
the screen was now turned up and the position -of the card
noted ; the part of the arm below where it had been fixed was
in exactly the same insensitive state as the rest of the arm.
The result even of this single experiment apparently negatives
the hypothesis of the variable transparency of different screens,
when their position is unknown to both hypnotist and subject.
Some other explanation must, I think, be found, and we may
assume as the most probable explanation that when the nature
of the screen is known to the operator, a telepathic impression,
or some faint sensible impression, of the expected result is
unconsciously conveyed to the subject, and self-suggestion
results. Dr. Alrutz, however, has been so long and assiduously
engaged in these experiments that it is somewhat presumptuous
on my part to differ from the conclusions he may have
arrived at, in consequence of a single experiment. Hence I
await the pubhcation of his results with interest.^
^
Dr. Alrutz informs me it was not a piece of card, but a collection of
some twenty strips of filtering paper.
-Dr. Alrutz, to whom I submitted a copy of this paper, adds a note iiere
stating that possibly the result obtained in my experiment may be due to the
Jan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 183
The foregoing experiments on the production of local
analgesia by passes, avoiding as far as possible all self-
suggestion on the part of the subject, and excluding any
conscious suggestion from the operator, are a confirmation of
the numerous experiments recorded in the Eeports of the
Committee on Mesmerism which were published in the early
years of our Society. Of that Committee I was an active
member, and took part with Mr. Gnrney in nearly all the
experiments. We were strongly convinced that conscious or
unconscious suggestion could not explain the results, and that
a prima facie case on behalf of the older mesmeric theory of
a specific influence appeared to be established.
Subsequently Mr. Gurney continued the investigation, and
"by his masterly treatment raised the difficult problems of
hypnotism to a higher scientific standing than ever before
attained. I wish to draw special attention to Mr. Gurney's
paper on " Hypnotism and Telepathy " published in the fifth
volume of our Proceedings. He there discusses the evidence
on behalf of a specific mesmeric influence, especially in thera-
peutical cases, citing the conversion of Dr. Liebeault of [N^ancy
to a belief in such an influence, mainly from the therapeutic
results obtained upon hypnotising forty-six children under four
years of age, the majority under three years. Dr. Liebeault
considers various hypotheses, and concludes that " the organic
changes produced must have been due to a transmitted nervous
influence." It is true he largely modified or even abandoned
this conclusion, in later years.^
Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick took part in similar experiments
a few years later, the subject being in the normal state, and
spreading of the effect in the cerebral centres (see his article " Halbspontane
Erscheinungen in der Hypuose," Zeitschri/t filr Psychologie, 1909), or more
probably to the subject falling into a deeper hypnotic sleep, when complete
analgesia spontaneously occurs. Certainly it was difficult, as Dr. Alrutz points
out, to keep the subject in the light hypnotic sleep. Or the result, he
suggests, may have been due to telepathic action from my mind counteracting
the assumed physical effect.
1 Miss .Johnson has pointed out to me that Mr. Gurney knew only of Dr.
Liebeault's earlier experiments, published in 1883. In consequence of later test
experiments Dr. Liebeault, I understand, gave up the effluence theory and con-
cluded that the results were due to suggestion alone, and published his
conclusion in his Th&rapeutique Suggestive in 1891. Mr. Myers in his Human
Personality, Vol. I., p. 444, refers to this; but on p. 484 Mr. ilyers, returning to
the problem of the influence of mesmeric passes, remarks on two different lines
of observation "which point to the probability of their possessing some specific
potency . . . some specific sensibility to human proximity per se.''
184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.
in the eighth volume of our Proceedings in 1890 Mrs. Sidgwick
and Miss Johnson published an important paper, the latter
part of which records and discusses numerous experiments
somewhat similar to those by Dr. Alrutz. In this lengthy
and valuable investigation by Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Johnson,
107 experiments were made on the production of local analgesia
in a subject in the normal state, the operator being Mr. Smith.
As in the earlier experiments made by Mr. Gurney and myself,
the subject sat behind an opaque screen, with his hands spread
out on a table, and could not see either his own hands or
those of the operator. In twenty-five cases Mr. Smith merely
pointed to the selected finger ; in nineteen of these the linger
was rendered absolutely insensitive to pain. In twenty-one
further experiments a glass screen was placed over the subject's
hand to prevent any possible sensory detection of the finger
Mr. Smith pointed to, and of these eighteen were completely
successful ; the mere pointing of the operator to a particular
finger rendering it quite anaesthetic. Furthermore in 57 other
trials, Mr. Smith did not even point to the finger but only
looked at it from a greater or less distance, and of these
cases 22 were successful.
After discussing various explanations Mrs. Sidgwick and
Miss Johnson state that " they believe the true explanation of
the results is thought transference, or mental suggestion received
in some unconscious or subliminal manner by the subject's
mind and acting on his organism in the same way that an
ordinary verbal suggestion may act." Certainly this appears
to be the explanation of hypnosis induced at a distance, and
it may be the true explanation of local analgesia. On the other
hand, I do not know of any experiments where mere verbal sug-
gestion by the operator to a subject in the normal state causes
the finger, or other part suggested, to become absolutely insensi-
tive to pain.^ It is most desirable that experiments should
be made to settle this question, and I hope Dr. Alrutz, who
has at his command a suitable subject, will carefully examine
Mrs. Sidgwick's and Miss Johnson's conclusion. Mr. Gurney,
we know, was opposed to it, though his untimely death occurred
lit is true Dr. Wingfield has shown (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 281) that his
subjects produced not only muscular rigidity, but sometimes local anaesthesia,
in their arms, by the subject himself gazing at, or stroking, or even intently
thinking of, his own arm.
Jan., 1912. Some Recent Hyjmotic Experiments. 185
before the important experiments were made upon which Mrs.
Sidgwick's conclusion was based.
Mr. Myers, in his admirable review of the facts of
hypnotism in the fifth chapter of his Human Personality,
thinks that Mrs. Sidgwick's experiments " removed Gurney'»
main objection to the telepathic explanation "; ^ but he adds
later on on the same page :
" It is by no means improbable
that effluences,—as yet unknown to science, but perceptible by
sensitive persons as the telepathic impulse is perceptible,—
should radiate from living human organisms " ; hence he con-
cludes :
" I see no reason to assume that the varied and con-
cordant statements made by patients in the Zoist and early
mesmeric works merely reflect subjective fancies."
Further, there appears to me indubitable evidence of some
supernormal means of detection by a sensitive of any inanimate
object over which passes have been made, or which has been
pointed at by the mesmeriser. Time will not allow me to
narrate the experiments which I and others have made on thi&
point, and which Gurney corroborated long ago at Deans Yard.
They are referred to in Vol. I. of our Proceedings, pp. 260-
262, and also are recited by Mr. Gurney in his paper in
Vol. V.
At Upsala last September I asked Dr. Alrutz to let me
repeat some of his experiments when he was not in the room..
This I did, and the results obtained were the same. Then he
begged me to try an experiment the effect of which I did not
know, and see if my result accorded with that he himself had
previously obtained. The experiment was as follows: On
restoring the arm of the subject to its normal sensibility by
reverse passes, to continue those reverse passes for a minute
or two after sensibility had returned, and note the result.
Dr. Alrutz having left the room I hypnotised the patient by a.
few passes, his eyes closed, and his vision appeared insensitive.
The black velvet cloth was thrown over his head and shoulders
and carefully adjusted so that all normal vision was impossible.
The arm was rendered insensitive to pain by downward passes^
and restored to sensitiveness by a few upward passes, all made
in absolute silence and without any contact with the patient,
the metal screen being over the bared arm. Then the reverse
1 Human Personality, Vol. I. , p. 208.
186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.
passes were continued for another minute or more. I expected
to find it unchanged, and was much surprised to discover it
was now in an extremely hyperaesthetic state. Tested with
the lowest pressure of Dr. Alrutz's needle, pain was evidently felt
;
the touch of any light object, even a feather, produced discomfort
and irritation in the subject. I recalled Dr. Alrutz, and he
told me I ought to have obtained exactly the results observed,
as again and again he had found similar hyperaesthesia, induced
by a continuance of the reverse passes.
Here neither myself nor the subject knew what the result
would be, for the subject was unaware of what I was going to
do. Dr. Alrutz having spoken to me in English, and I took
special care not to communicate any information through the
senses to the subject during the experiment. We may, of
course, assume that extreme hyperaesthesia in the subject
enabled him to detect when my fingers were moving up or
down his arm ; but this seems as improbable as the theory of
a specific effiuence.
•
If there be such an ettluence it would appear to have a
polarity like magnetism. Stroking a knitting needle with the
one end of a bar magnet induces magnetic polarity in the
knitting needle, a couple of reverse strokes demagnetises it, but
continuing the reverse strokes it is remagnetised with the
opposite polarity. Ts the common knowledge of this fact, in
the subliminal depths of the hypnotist, the cause of the some-
what similar effects produced in an ignorant subject ? We need
more experiments made, with wider knowledge, scrupulous care,
and above all, with an open mind, one freed from the tyranny
of false or inadequate hypotheses.
How injurious to the progress of knowledge, and yet how
persistent, hasty generalisations and inadequate hypotheses have
been, is seen in the pages of history. Throughout the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries the doctrine of symimtliy, the alleged
attraction between certain animate and inanimate bodies, para-
lysed scientific progress. Every inexplicable occurrence was
put down to this doctrine. Then in the seventeenth and part
of the eighteenth century Descartes' theory of vortices became
the learned rationalistic philosophy. Then came the turn of
electricity, always still the refuge of the ignorant. Then we
had the doctrine of a purely material evolution, and now
Jan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 187
vitalism is again besiinnino; to be heard. Has not the doctrine
of suggestion in hypnotism—true as it undoubtedly is —been
pushed too far ? Have not the therapeutic results of the
modern hypnotists using this doctrine lamentably fallen short
of those obtained by the older mesmerists ? How far is this
due to an inadequate view of the facts ? And in our own
ranks are we not in danger of pushing too far the doctrine
of telepathy and of the subliminal self, pervasive and true as
they both are ? Let us remember the warning long ago uttered
by Francis Bacon against the danger of worshipping the " idol
of the tribe," i.e. " the tendency to support a preconceived opinion
by neglecting all that is opposed to it." The secrets of Nature,
as Bacon tells us, can only be discovered by receptivity and
obedience, keeping the eye steadily fixed on the facts of Nature,
and receiving the images of those facts simply as they arc
without distortion through preconceived ideas.
P.S.—In returning the MS. of this paper, which I had sent
to Dr. Alrutz, he wishes me to add that his experiments have
extended over a somewhat wider range than those hitherto
recorded in our Proceedings. He informs me he has carefully
examined the motor phenomena produced by passes, the power
of cold to restore sensitiveness, the order in which the different
effects return, the effect of telepathy without passes or pointing,
end of passes without any knowledge of what would occur, the
affect of rcqjport between the subject and the operator, and
the varied problems which belong to the analgesic condition of
the subject. These, and other experiments which time prevented
Dr. Alrutz demonstrating to me, must of course be taken into
consideration before arriving at a conclusion. Meanwhile, in a
letter just received from Dr. Alrutz, he says that for the
present he does not wish to commit himself to any theory,
or even any definite explanation of the facts, but desires to
keep an open mind. Nevertheless, he adds that, as different
persons, without knowing what to expect, get the same results
with the same kind of passes,—even when he is not in the
room, and is unaware of the experiments that are being made,
—
he fails to see how unconscious telepathic suggestion can
account for these cases. He admits that it is a vera causa,
but not the only cause.
188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1 912.
Writing to me in a letter dated Dec. 1, 1911, Dr. Alrutz
says :
I showed the hypnotic experiments you witnessed to the Society
of Physicians of Upsala last week. The sight of the crowded hall,
many members of the faculty of medicine being present, made the
subject nervous ;
however, he went to sleep all right, though he
was disagreeable the whole hour my demonstration lasted. Never-
theless, most of the experiments were more or less distinctly
successful. At last I put him into the deep sleep, to show that
analgesia and anaesthesia then occur spontaneously. Then I threw
the black cloth over his head, and wrote "Wake up" on a piece of
paper, and silently willed him to wake up and get up, —a rash thing
to try in the presence of these seventy to eighty strange nervous
systems! I had to wait about one and a half minutes, when he threw
off the black cloth, got up wide awake, and left the room. I had
made this experiment several times before, even from an adjoining
room. —Yours sincerely,
Sydney Alrutz.

Cambridge. In estimating what evidence exists for any real
foreseeing of the future (apart from normal inference from
knowledge of the present), it is, of course, necessary to take
into account premonitions that are not fulfilled. These are
obviously much more likely to be forgotten than those which
appear to be fulfilled. But the interest of the present case
lies in the fact that Mr. Hutchinson's foreboding was shared
by his little son, who apparently had no normal means of
knowing anything about it. We therefore classify the case
provisionally as one of telepathy between the father and child.
Mr. Stratton writes in sending it : .
November 20th, 1911.
Prof, and Mrs. Newall, from whom I heard the story, both
assured me that the written account (dated Nov. 10) agreed en-
tirely with the story told them when Dr. Hutchinson was visiting
them on Oct. 14.
Jan., 1912. Case. 189
Mr. Hutchinson's account is as follows :
St. Anne's, Lowestoft,
Nov. Wth, 1911.
Dear Mrs. Newall,
I forward you the few notes you wish for, but I trust you
will forgive me for having been so long in sending them. I plead
the usual excuse of overwork.
On the kind invitation of Professor Newall to see the Observatory
at Cambridge, I decided to motor over from Lowestoft on Saturday,
14th October.
On Friday—the day previous to the trip—I had an unaccountable
restless feeling that some disaster would take place on the journey.
So strong did this feeling become that I decided to insure myself
and car against all risk before undertaking the trip. I had some
diflBculty in effecting this insurance, as the time was short ;
however,
the agents were able to put the matter through for me, and I had
my policy complete by 8.30 p.m. the same evening.
As I only had a very short time to spend in Cambridge, I decided
to start from my house at 5 o'clock in the morning.
I awoke at 4.15 a.m., and immediately started to dress, but before
completing my toilet I heard my son (a little fellow of six years
old) crying for me in a most piteous manner.
I went upstairs to see him—as he sleeps in a room by himself
at the top of the house—and he immediately threw his arms round
my neck, hugging me tightly and begging me not to undertake
the journey. I told him not to be foohsh, as I shuuld be back with
him the next day. I was unable to comfort him, so I brought him
down to his mother, and I understand from her that soon after
my departure he went off to sleep.
I might state here that it was a most unusual thing for the boy
to wake up at that hour of the morning, nor had he been told
anything very much about my intended trip.
As regards my journey to Cambridge and back, it was entirely
uneventful, and I am unable to account in any way for the curious
and persistent feeling I had that a calamity of some kind would
take place during my absence from home.
I might point out that I have driven a motor-car for over ten
years and have never taken out an insurance policy before, and
would not have done so now except for the above related facts.
During the past ten years I have driven all over England and
190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.
Scotland and have never met with an accident, nor had the same
peculiar apprehension before undertaking a journey.
Yours very sincerely,
Donald Hutchinson.
In reply to Mr. Stratton's enquiries Mr. Hutchinson wrote
to him :
Nov. mh, 1911.
. . . With regard to your query re my son, I can say unhesitatingly
that he knew nothing whatever regarding my forebodings, as I
had been particularly careful not even to mention them to my
wife. ...

THE BUPtTON CASE.
By Professor J. H. Hyslop.
Miss Verrall's summary of this case ^ presents a few inquiries
to which an answer is perhaps due. The first is whether the
struggle between her two hands is sufficient evidence of the
motor dissociation alleged in the case. I would say that this
was not the only evidence and not the most important evidence
given to sustain that claim. Far more important were the two
or three instances in which her hands were used without any
knowledge that they were so used. Twice she put her own hand
against her face and thouglit it was some one else touching
her face, the face beino' sensitive and the hands anaesthetic.
On another occasion she observed the lights which had been
made by her own hand without conscious knowledge of the
same. The struggle between the hands was only a constant
phenomenon illustialing the case and not the only evidence of
it. Besides, the phenomenon is quite commonplace in psycho-
pathology. Dr. Boris Sidis describes it quite fully in the Hanna
Case. I have often remarked it in automatic writing when
normal consciousness existed. I have seen it here in more than
one form. First, I have seen it when the subject did not know
^ See Journal, November, 1911, p. 140.
Jan., 1912. The Burton Case. 191
what the hand was writing, but knew that it was writing.
Secondly, I have seen it when the subject knew consciously
what the hand was writing, though not knowing that it was
writing. That is, there was no sensation of the writing, and no
revelation of the contents by sensation at the time. Thirdly, I
have seen cases of it where the subject knew the contents
before the writing was done, and yet wrote them out auto-
matically. The phenomenon is thus a very frequent one, and
the only interest of the case of Miss Burton is that it was
connected with physical phenomena of the orthodox type.
The query regarding the examination of the mouth in the
dark for phosphorus as well as in the light does not take account
of the fact that we had shown that she could not have produced
the lights if she had had any amount of phosphorus. We did
not examine her mouth so much for phosphorus as for other
apparatus. We should have been willing, but for the conjurer's
ill-directed objections, to have given her all the matches desired
and yet she could not have produced the lights with them, or
with phosphorous oil. Besides, what would have enabled her to
produce the lights four feet distant when both hands were held ?
Or the large light behind her when the hands were held ?
The lights of the fire-tly and glow-worm are exactly like those
produced by Miss Burton, or perhaps better, hers were like
those, and science, I believe, conjectures that they are due to
some form of oxydization of phosphorus. But they have no
resemblance to the lights produced by matches or phosphorous
oil.
The analogy of the person struggling in temptation, or the
phenomena of conversion, does not apply to the case of motor
dissociation unless you assume that one of the terms in the
competing impulses is subconscious. What we usually assume,
rightly or wrongly has not been determined, is that in conversion
both impulses to do and to resist a thing are conscious. This
was not the case with Miss Burton, and is not the case
where the struggle is between subconscious and conscious
impulses. We take for granted here that we understand the
struggle in conversion and similar phenomena, when the fact
is that a whole group of such phenomena has not been studied
at all from the point of view of abnormal psychology. Much
talk about subconscious processes has been indulged in, but little
192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.
or nothing done to make them intelligible. We can just as
well turn them round and ask whether they are not due to
the same influences as the automatism associated with the
supernormal, though not affording the crucial evidence of this,
and though they might afford this if rightly studied. The
comparison may be just, but the explanation implied by it
may not be so apparent.
Miss Verrall's summary makes no mention of the incidents
of mental phenomena that were quite as striking as the raps
and lights. They were particularly the name of Professor
Newbold, those of Imperator and Hector, not known by Miss
Burton, and the interesting cross-reference with Whirlwind, to
say nothing of a few others less striking. Then there was the
checking of these claims by the admissions and supernormal
information regarding the case as obtained through Mrs.
Chenoweth. These are very important features of the case,
without taking any account of the subconscious mental states
that illustrate so well the conditions affecting the transmission
of anything supernormal at all.
The query regarding the tests for anaesthesia I would answer
by saying that our reason for not describing them in detail
was simply that no test will ever satisfy the layman in this
matter. Anaesthesia is a very simple matter for the psycho-
pathologist to determine, and the conjurer would not accept
that authority. We applied severe tests many times, but we
ourselves did not attach any value to them, as we know that
faked anaesthesia is the suspicion of all who do not know how
easy it is to determine it. Our tests were not simple ones.
They rested primarily upon a complicated system of reactions
extending over long periods, and these are manyfold better
than any such tests as were applied to Mrs. Piper, and that
astonish the layman. Our tests were of a kind that it is best
not to reveal, as it would only help to prepare other cases
for protection against them.

EEPOET ON SITTINGS WITH CHARLES BAILEY, THE
AUSTRALIAN APPOET MEDIUM.
By W. W. Baggally.
EOR some years past accounts have appeared in the Spiritualistic
Press of alleged wonderful apports brought about through the
mediumship of Mr. Charles Bailey in Australia. In these
accounts it is stated that tablets and cylinders covered with
cuneiform characters have been instantly transported from
mounds on the site of ancient Babylon into the room where
Bailey was, also ancient coins from Egypt, live animals from
India, Africa and other parts of the world.^ These accounts
have drawn the attention of some European savants interested in
the investigation of so-called spiritualistic physical phenomena, and
at their invitation Bailey has given seances in Milan and Eome.
Only last year he gave a series of seances under the auspices
of Professor Willy Eeichel at Grenoble, France. Amongst the
members of the committee on this occasion were Mons. Guillaume
de Fontenoy, Colonel de Eochas, several doctors and engineers.
This committee issued a report, in which it is stated that Bailey
resorted to fraud." Immediately after his sittings at Grenoble
Bailey came to England, and in the month of May this year
(1911) he commenced to give public seances in London.
The first time I attended one of his seances was on the
14th of June, 1911. These seances were held at the furnished
flat occupied by Mrs. Foster Turner, who in her circulars styles
herself the Australian World-famed Psychological Demonstrator
and Court Clairvoyante. I went unaccompanied. A lady and
I were evidently the only strangers present ; the other sitters
consisted of a gentleman who calls himself Professor Abbott (and
has the management of Bailey's and Mrs. Foster Turner's stances,
acting as a kind of secretary to receive the fees from the sitters,
etc.), Mrs. Foster Turner and some members of her family or
friends who apparently resided in the same flat. We all waited
in the drawing-room till the medium should arrive. In a short
time we were told that he had come and was waiting in another
room. We were then asked to go into the seance room before
Bailey entered it. I found that a large cage stood in the middle
of the room, large enough to admit of the medium standing up

in it, and giving room for him to move about. Tiie base of the
cage measured about five feet square, and the height about six
feet ; the cage was made of wooden supports on which had been
nailed with tacks some kind of netting with a small mesh
through which the medium could be well seen. I had no
opportunity at the first seance of examining this cage, as the
sitters had hardly entered the seance room when they were
requested to take their seats by Mrs. Foster Turner, who pointed
to a chair which she informed me I should occupy, and then
she pointed to another chair next to mine which she asked
the lady visitor to occupy. I made no demur on occupying
my seat, as I intended at first simply to watch the proceedings,
and to be present at several subsequent seances. It struck
me as a suspicious circumstance that the lady and I, the only
strangers present, should be asked to take seats away from the
opening of the cage. One side of the cage hung on hinges and
served as a door.
Owing to my position, it would have been difficult for me
to be aware (in the complete darkness that prevailed during
the time that apports were supposed to be brought by the
alleged controls) whether the door had been opened by a
confederate to hand objects into the cage to Bailey. After
we had taken our seats the medium entered the room and sat
on a chair in the cage. I made the observation that he had
not been examined. He thereupon took off his coat, and com-
menced slapping himself over his body to show that there was
nothing hidden about his person, making at the same time the
remark that if he had a live bird concealed about him it would
be killed. He asked me to enter the cage and examine him.
I proceeded to feel over his body, but as several ladies were
present I could not thoroughly examine him. It was not my
intention to submit him at my first seance to a thorough
examination, as I wished him to believe I was satisfied
with my imperfect one, and I desired that he should gain
confidence in me. I attended the seance under a pseudonym
and assumed ignorance of spiritualistic physical phenomena.
After the examination I was requested to lock the cage with
a padlock which was handed to me, and to keep the key in
my possession. I proceeded to do this, and resumed my seat.
Almost immediately after the medium appeared to go into a
trance—said, " Good evening, friends." Several persons present
196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.
replied :
" Good evening, Dr. Whitcomb." This Dr. Whitcomb,
I was informed, was a spirit who had taken control of the
medium. The medium then stood up, and the alleged Dr.
Whitcomb proceeded to deliver a long speech which purported
to be an explanation (for the benefit of those of the sitters
who were not acquainted with spiritualistic phenomena) of the
method used by the Hindoo spirits for the transportation of
the objects from Australia, India, etc. We were told that the
Hindoo controls first etherealized or dematerialized the objects,
and then by means of vibrations in the intervening ether they
transported the objects to the seance room. The objects being
in a dematerialized condition, passed through the walls of the
seance room ; the place in the wall through wliich they passed
being also dematerialized. After the objects had entered the
cage, the Hindoo controls re-materialized them. Light caused
vibrations in the ether, and interfered with the vibrations
necessary for the re-materialization, hence the necessity for
darkness at the time the apports took place. " Dr. Whitcomb "
having concluded his lucid explanation, another alleged control,
named Professor Denton, addressed a few words to the sitters.
The medium then sat down, and requested that the light
should be put out and that the sitters should sing. The extin-
guishing of the light resulted in total darkness. After one or
two hymns had been sung the medium asked for light ; on it
being obtained he made a movement in the air with his left
hand as if trying to catch something—he then opened his hand,
and in it was a live bird. He informed us that it had been
transported from Australia. The bird was a very small one
;
it rested on the palm of his hand motionless, evidently in a
benumbed condition, as if it had been, for some time previously,
in a constrained position. The alleged control said that the
bird did not move because it had been hypnotized by the
Hindoo spirits who had brought it—they always hypnotized
the birds before they dematerialized and re-materialized them.
After a short time the bird flew from the medium's hand and
clung to the netting on one side of the cage. Bailey then
became controlled by an alleged Hindoo spirit named Abdullah,
who sang a love song in what purported to be Hindustani, and
which he translated into broken English. Abdullah's broken
English presented a curious feature ; at a moment of forgetful-
ness he uttered a long sentence in quite correct English, quite
Feb., 1912. Report on Sittings ivitli Charles Bailey. 197
out of keeping with his previous language. At the request of
Abdullah the light was put out again, another hymn was sung
by the sitters, and when the light was again raised a nest with
a small egg rested in both of the medium's hands. Abdullah
informed us that the egg and nest had come from India, and
that the nest was an edible one. After this Bailey remained for
a short time on his chair inside the cage in an alleged state of
trance. He then came to himself, and we were informed that
the seance was at an end.
During the seance I stood up in the darkness and
leaned forward, placed one hand on the part of the cage
where the hinges of the door were, and my other hand on
the top of the cage. I did not feel the door open, but I
did feel a sudden thump on the woodwork of the cage, and I
came to the provisional conclusion that a side of the top of
the cage had been slightly lifted up and then let down, and
that the apports had been introduced in this manner by a
confederate. By my subsequent experiences, however, at further
seances, I have formed the opinion that the apports were
hidden about Bailey's person, and I will proceed to give, later
on, my reasons for this conclusion.
The next sitting was to be a test one, under the control
of a committee formed by Dr. Abraham Wallace, who kindly
invited me to join it.
Amoncrst the members of this committee were the Hon.
o
Everard Feilding, Dr. Abraham Wallace, his son, a friend of
Dr. Wallace who is a professor of Oriental languages, a well-
known conjurer, and some medical men, friends of Dr. Wallace.
Mrs. Foster Turner and Professor Abbott were also present.
The test seance took place on July the 6th. Mr. Feilding
and I, before the seance began, thoroughly examined the cage.
We found no evidence of its being a trick one. The netting
in several places was rather loosely tacked to the wooden
supports and could have allowed of very small objects being
passed into the cage. But all these defects were remedied
by re-tacking the netting where it had not been properly
nailed. I thoroughly examined the carpet upon which stood
the cage : it had been screwed to the floor by means of screws
through the carpet, and I found no openings in the carpet
except those made by the screws. I also examined the chair
on which Bailey was to sit : it was a plain, cane chair with
198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.
nothing secreted about it. After I had finished my inspection
we were informed that Bailey had arrived and was in an
adjoining room. A committee of examination consisting of
Dr. Abraham Wallace, the well-known conjurer and myself
was appointed. Professor Abbott was also present at the
examination. We proceeded to the room where Bailey was,
and requested him to remove his clothes. He at once com-
plied. Dr. Wallace, in the presence of the other members of
the examining committee, felt all over his naked body. Bailey
through an accident has broken his left rib ; this rib stands out
in a lump and any person examining him by feeling over his
clothes would easily take this lump to be an object concealed
about his person. I proceeded to thoroughly examine his
clothes as they lay on the floor, including his stockings and
boots, carefully taking note that the heels were not hollow
screw heels in which any small object could be concealed.
The interior of his watch was also examined. All the pockets,
lining of his clothes, etc., were submitted to careful scrutiny.
Every part of the clothing was pressed strongly by me against the
floor, so that a live bird or egg (if it had been concealed there)
would have been destroyed. The examination was a thorough
one so far as it went, but it was not complete as it was not
a surgical one, and to this Bailey said he had never submitted
nor would he submit to it on this occasion. The examination
was, therefore, not an absolutely complete one.
After Bailey was dressed J)r. Wallace and I led him into
the cage in the seance room, taking care that he should not
lay hold of any object on his passage from the room where
he had been examined to the cage. Bailey having seated
himself in the cage the same order of procedure followed as at
my first seance. He went into an alleged trance ; the supposed
controls, Dr. Whitcomb and Professor Denton, made speeches,
and the Hindoo control began to speak in what purported to be
Hindustani. Dr. Wallace at this point said to the professor
of Oriental languages, who was sitting by his side, " Now, you
speak to him in Hindustani." This gentleman addressed a few
words in that language to the supposed Abdullah, who imme-
diately ceased to address us in his alleged Hindustani and
began to talk in broken English. This looked rather suspicious.
Abdullah then asked that the light should be put out, and
that the sitters should sing. I had been appointed to lock
Feb., 1912. Report on Sittings with Charles Bailey.
the door of the cage, to keep the key of the padlock in my
possession, and to sit close to the opening of the cage. At
the time of intense darkness, when the apports were supposed
to come from India or Australia, etc., I stood up, placed one
hand on the part of the cage where it opened and one hand
on the top. This time I felt no motion in the wooden frame-
work, altliough both Mr. Feilding and I heard on two occasions
sounds like the creaking of wood, probably produced by Bailey
wri"crlino- about in his chair. That he was moving could be
distinctly heard, notwithstanding the sound ot the singing.
Abdullah requested that the electric light should be put up.
On this being done the sitters saw what appeared to be a
nest held by the medium in both his hands, and within the
nest was a small blue egg and a blackbird's egg. Bailey took
these eggs out of the nest one at a time, and placed them
close to" the netting for us to see them better. On a doubt
being expressed whether they were real eggs and not made
of chalk or marble, Bailey asked me to open the cage; he
then broke one of the eggs between his fingers and the other
on the palm of one of the medical gentlemen. He then handed
them out. They were undoubtedly real eggs, and the contents
smelt quite fresh. Bailey said that it was not the custom
of the Hindoo controls to destroy the eggs they brought, as
they objected to destroy life in any form, and that they
returned them to the nests of the parent birds after the
seances, but on this occasion the controls consented to have
them broken, as it was a test seance. One of the gentlemen
present remarked that blackbirds' eggs were not laid at this
time of the year. Bailey replied that the small blue egg
had come from Africa and the blackbird's egg from an island,
the name of which he gave, but which I do not remember.
Some of the members present remarked that the eggs were
fresh, and it was curious that the blackbird's egg, if it had
been laid some time ago, should not be addled. One of the
members of the committee thereupon remarked that he knew a
method by which eggs could be preserved fresh for a long time.
I obtained possession of the nest, which consisted of
fine palm fibres. I had noticed that while Bailey had it
in his two hands he kept his hands together so that they
formed a hollow in which the nest rested. The medium gave
me the impression that he kept the nest in the hollow of
200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.
his hands in order that it should not lose its form—in fact,
when I obtained it I found the fibres loosely held together,
and soon lost the form of a nest. I flattened the fibres between
the palms of my hands : they presented so slight a thickness,
and were so pliant, that they could have been placed within
the lining of any part of the medium's clothing, and that
part of the lining could have been squeezed and rumpled
about without the fibre being felt. We might have verified
whether any part of the lining of Bailey's clothes had become
unstitched, but subsequent events prevented our doing so.
After he had handed out the nest and eggs, he remained
for a very short time within the cage in a state of alleged
trance. He soon came to himself, and straightway left the
room. The committee then discussed the results. The opinion
of the majority of the members was that inasmuch as Bailey
had not been submitted to a surgical examination, the phenomena
did not offer sufficient evidence of their being of a supernormal
nature. We then proceeded to call Bailey back to the seance
room to discuss the results with him, but it was found that
he had left the house. His sudden departure gave the
impression that he was reluctant to discuss the matter.
After this disappointing test seance Dr. Wallace and I left
Mrs. Foster Turner's house together. I then suggested to Dr.
Wallace that it would be advisable to put Bailey inside a bag,
the bag to be of such a form as to cover the whole body
including the head ; the part of the bag above the medium's
neck, and covering his head, to be of fine meshed netting sa
that he could breathe freely. This bag would preclude the
necessity of submitting Bailey to the severe examination which
he had informed us he had never undergone, and to which he
said he would never submit. If Bailey obtained live birds
outside the bag, and within the cage, without the bag or the
cage showing at the end of the seance any defect or any
aperture through which the birds could have been thrust,
then the phenomena would be worthy of serious considera-
tion. Dr. Wallace and I arranged that we should take such
a bag to a subsequent seance. Bailey was not informed by
us that we intended to do so. I set to work and had a bag
made at my own home : it consisted of black satinette, except
the part which was to cover the medium's head, which was
of mosquito netting—the holes in the meshes being so fine
Feb., 1912. Report on Sittings luith Charles Bailey. 201
that they would not admit of small objects being passed through
them. Had a blade of very fine grass or an object of any such
shape appeared at this seance and been claimed by the medium
to be an apport, we should not have attached any evidential
value to it. 1 superintended the making of the bag myself.
I took care that the parts which required to be sewn together
should be doubled over each other several times, and then twice
sewn through along their lengths with very strong thread.
Dr. Wallace and I attended the seance of the 13th July. I
had the bag ready in a leather hand-bag which I placed by
my side in the seance room. Bailey entered the room and
took a seat within the cage. I then suggested in a low voice
to Dr. Wallace that we should show the satinette bag to Bailey,
and ask him whether he would consent to be put into it.
Dr. Wallace thought it would be better to wait till the medium
was controlled by the alleged Dr. Whitcomb. On Bailey being
controlled by this supposed spirit I took the bag out of the
leather hand-bag. Dr. Wallace then asked " Dr. Whitcomb "
whether he would allow the medium to be put into it, at the
same time pointing out that the test seance had not been a
satisfactory one, as the examination on that occasion had not
been an absolutely complete one, but that if Dr. Whitcomb
consented, and live birds were produced within the cage and
outside the bag without any injury to the bag or cage, the
necessity of the severe examination would not be required.
We also said that if the apports of live birds were supernormal,
they would be phenomena of such an important nature that
they required to be carried out under scientific tests. The
alleged Dr. Whitcomb absolutely refused. Thereupon there
followed for about an hour a heated discussion between Dr.
Wallace, myself, and the alleged control, but no amount of
reasoning would convince Dr. Whitcomb. His refusal was
what I had anticipated. Amongst his reasons for not allowing
the medium to enter the bag he stated that the material of
the bag would not allow the animal magnetism to pass
through it. I fail to see why the bag would act in this
manner, while Bailey's clothes, which were of a thicker texture
than the bag, allowed the so-called animal magnetism easily to
pass through them. Professor Abbott made the suggestion that
the part of the netting which was intended to cover Bailey's
head should be removed, and that the bag should be tied only
202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.
round the medium's neck. We pointed out that this would
not prevent small objects from being passed through the aperture
of the bag where Bailey's neck was. Some of the sitters present,
who evidently were earnest spiritualists, were greatly disap-
pointed at Dr. Whitcomb's refusal to allow the medium to be
placed in the bag. At one moment Dr. Wallace and I decided
to leave the house, as it appeared useless for us to continue
the investigation. We, however, changed our minds and re-
mained in the seance room. The alleged Professor Denton
then controlled Bailey. This control, at the end of his speech,
stated that the experiment of putting Bailey in a bag made
wholly of mosquito netting might be tried at a future seance;
he did not know that anything would take place, but we might
try. The sitters at this seance had so far obtained no
phenomena for their fees of 10/6 for each person, but only
the benefit of hearing a long, heated discussion between Dr.
Wallace, myself, and the alleged Dr. Whitcomb, and a speech
from the so-called Professor Denton.
It was getting late when Abdullah, the Hindoo control, took
possession of the medium, repeated a few words which sounded
like. Hindustani, and then asked that the light should be put
out. A hymn was sung by the sitters, during which a rattling
sound was heard within the cage as if pebbles were being thrown
about on the floor. On the light being obtained it was found
that several small pieces of copper ore were lying on the carpet
inside the cage. This copper ore, the medium said, had come
from Australia. Shortly after. Bailey came out of his supposed
trance and retired into an adjoining room. The pieces of copper
ore were collected. Dr. Wallace and I found that when held
in our hands they did not make more than one small handful.
It will be observed from the description of the seances, that I
attended, that the apports were on each occasion few in number,
and that they could occupy, when placed together, a small
compass. In the advertisements in Light respecting the Bailey
seances it was stated that no fees would be charged unless
results were obtained, but I noticed that Professor Abbott
generally collected the fees from the sitters before the seances
began ; he evidently was sure that results would be obtained
on every occasion.
After the above seance was over, Dr. Wallace and I had a
conversation with Bailey, and he consented to be placed at the
Feb., 1912. Report on Sittings with Charles Bailey. 203
next seance of the 27tli of July in a bag of fine meshed
mosquito netting which was to envelop his body and head.
I also had this bag made under my supervision at my house.
I so planned it that Bailey should in no way be constrained
within it. The base consisted of a piece of carpet three feet
square, the borders of which were doubly and securely sewn
to the mosquito netting. The carpet served as a base on
which to place the medium's chair. The bag was nine feet in
height, thus giving sufficient material for its mouth to be tied
at different places above the medium's head with strong cords,
and to be then attached to the central upper wooden bar of
the cage, and allowed complete freedom to Bailey's feet, and
also allowed him to stand up if he so desired.
Dr. Wallace and 1, provided with this bag, attended the
seance on the 27th of July. "We placed it in the cage with
the medium's chair resting on the said piece of carpet ; this
was done before Bailey entered the cage. When he entered
and sat down it took only a short time to draw the bag up
around his body and above his head. We then made a knot
in the material of the bag itself above the medium's head, and
also tied the mouth in several places with strong cord and
attached it to a nail in the upper wooden bar of the cage.
Again at the beginning of this sitting the proceeding follows
the same order as at previous seances ; the medium goes into
an alleged trance, a speech is made by the supposed Dr.
Whitcomb, followed by one from the so-called Professor Denton
;
then some words are spoken by the alleged Hindoo control in
broken English and in what sounds like Hindustani. The
supposed spirit asks that the light be put out ;
hymns are
sung, and we await tlie promised apport—but this time we
wait patiently, as the test conditions are severe and are new
to the controls. One hymn after another is sung, and no
apport comes. A considerable time elapses, the patience of the
sitters is exhausted ; the light is put up—no apport is to be
seen. The seance is, in fact, a complete failure. The supposed
Dr. Whitcomb again takes control, and says the reason of non-
success is that too much material of the bag hangs about the
head of the medium : the natural explanation being, that Bailey
had been unable to get an object outside the bag which he
might have had concealed about his person. This was, I under-
stand, the first of Bailey's seances in England at which the
204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.
Hindoo controls had been unable to produce an apport. I
spoke to the supposed Dr. Whitcomb, and in formed him that
the inconvenience caused to the medium by the material of
the bag being close to liis head could be easily overcome, and
that I should arrange the bag in such a manner at a future
seance that no part of it should come in contact with Bailey's
body. We arranged to have the next seance on the following
evening, the 28th of July.
Previous to this seance I called on Dr. Wallace at his
professional residence, and we tied four cords to the upper
part of the bag at a height of about five and a half feet from
the base of the bag at places which corresponded to the four
corners of the square of carpet, which, as I have said, formed
the base. We then drove to the residence of Mrs. Foster
Turner and arrived there about half an hour before the seance
began. I had ample time to again thoroughly examine the
cage and re-taek the netting that covered it at those places
where there was any possibility of a very small object being
introduced by a confederate from outside. I also tested the
screws by which the cage was fixed to the floor. We then
placed the bag on the floor within the cage and placed the
cane chair on the piece of carpet ready for Bailey's use. I
must not omit to say that I again carefully examined the
carpet of the seance room ; found no holes or unsewn seams.
The cane chair I also re-examined, and found nothing secreted
in it. There were several sitters at this seance. After they
had taken their seats Bailey entered the room and took his
seat in the cage. Dr. Wallace and I then raised the sides
of the bag and fastened the four corners where the cords were
attached to nails in the four corner supports of the cage. We
then securely tied up the mouth of the bag in different places,
and fastened it to the nail in the upper transverse wooden
bar of the cage. I then locked the cage, put the key in my
pocket, and took my chair and guarded the door. Bailey was
then absolutely unconstrained ; no part of the bag touched his
person, he was free to move or stand up within the bag—in
fact, it was as if Bailey were sitting in two cages, one within
the other. We had thus met every condition which the supposed
controls had said were unfavourable to the manifestations.
I need not repeat in detail the order of the procedure : it was
the same as the previous seances. Speeches from the alleged
Feb., 1912. Re])ort on Sittings xvith Charles Bailey. 205
Dr. Whitcomb and Professor Denton, a few words in broken
English and supposed Hindustani from the so-called Abdullah,
and then the light was put out. We had previously strongly
impressed on Bailey the seriousness of the test, and told him
that if an apport of live birds took place between the net
bag and the cage without any defect being found in the bag
or cage, it would be of great scientific value, and would lead
greatly to his pecuniary interest, as we should then publish
a favourable report. He had not sat for more than five
minutes in the darkness when we heard what sounded like
the chirping of a bird. The supposed control said, " Put up
the light at once," and there, outside the net bag and within
the cage, was a live bird. This bird appeared rather high up
in the cage in the anterior left side ; it then flew to the back
of the cage and clung to the netting. Abdullah said, " Put
out the light again, there is another bird coming." In a very
short time he asked for the light to be raised, and we then
saw another live bird clinginGf to the interior surface of the
netting of the cage, and outside of the bag. This manifestation
impressed us all a good deal, as neither the netting of the
cage nor of the bag, which was clearly seen through the
netting of the cage, showed any defect. Both Dr. Wallace
and I then said to Abdullah, " Take the greatest care that the
medium does not inadvertently make a rent in the netting of
the bag, as then all will be spoilt and the evidential manifes-
tation which we appear to have obtained will not then count."
We had been informed by Professor Abbott that on a previous
occasion a live tish had been obtained as an apport, and Bailey
had told us that growing plants had been transported at his
Australian seances which, on each successive occasion that the
light had been put out and relit, had been found to have grown
larger and larger. In the hope of getting these apports a pot
of earth and a basin of water had been placed by Dr. Wallace
in the space between the bag and the cage. Dr. Wallace asked
Abdullah to try and obtain these apports. Bailey thereupon
stood up and began to address, in excited tones in alleged
Hindustani, another imaginary Hindoo personality, as if he
were trying strongly to induce him to bring these apports.
Bailey was standing up at the time that the fierce altercation
was taking place between the two supposed Hindoo spirits.
He suddenly fell flat on the floor in what purported to be a
206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.
fainting iit. His feet tore a large rent in the front of the
bag. Now, inasmuch as this rent did not exist before the
birds had appeared, Dr. Wallace and I agreed that, provided
there were no other defect or hole in the netting of the bag^
or of the cage, we should not consider this rent as militating
against the evidence for the supernormality of the phenomena.
We untied the mouth of the bag and cut the four cords which
held it to the upper parts of the four supports of the cage.
We got Bailey out of the bag, and Dr. Wallace carried him
and placed him on a bed in an adjoining room. I remained
in the seance room, and proceeded to examine very carefully
the netting of the bag, and found that Bailey had made a
hole at the top right-hand anterior corner of the bag, through
which he had evidently thrust the two small birds. I noticed
that the feathers of the birds were rufHed, and, in fact, some
of the tail feathers of one of the birds were broken. The hole
had been artfully made where it could not be readily seen,.
i.e. near to the cord which tied the bag at the upper right-hand
anterior corner. The tying of the bag with this cord had formed
some folds in the netting, and hidden amongst the folds I
found the hole. This was doubtless the reason we had not
detected it after the two birds had appeared and before Bailey
had made the large rent at the time of his falling on the floor in
his alleged fainting fit. The hole was shown to Dr. Wallace on
his return to the seance room. He and I then came to a defi-
nite adverse conclusion as to the genuineness of Bailey's apports.
The circumstantial evidence obtained at this and the
previous seances which I have described points to deliberate
fraud. I will recapitulate the evidence and state the motives
which, in my opinion, actuated Bailey's conduct during the
course of the seances. When Bailey knew that he was not
to be thoroughly examined by a committee at the first seance,
he got the apport of a live bird. At the test seance, when
he was aware that a committee would examine hira, he did
not get live birds, but only two small eggs, which together
occupied a small space. He informed the committee that he
would never submit to an absolutely complete examination.
The supposed nest obtained at the test seance was made of
palm fibres, which fibres could have been flattened out and
could have been easily hidden in the lining of his clothes.
Unknown to the committee Bailey hastily left the house after
Feb., 1912. Report on Sittings with Charles Bailey. 207
this seance was over ;
consequently his clothes could not be
examined in order to ascertain whether any part of their
lining had been unsewn. At the next sitting, when he was
unexpectedly confronted with the satinette bag, he absolutely
refused to be placed in it. The pieces of copper ore which
were supposed to have been an apport were found, when put
together, to occupy only a small space. The heated discussion
carried on by Dr. Wallace and myself with the supposed
control, Dr. Whitcomb, when we pointed out how damaging
to Bailey's reputation would be our disclosure that he would
not submit to proper tests, evidently impressed Bailey ; he
therefore consented to be put in a mosquito net bag at a
subsequent seance. Professor Abbott, who had the management
of the sitting, tried to induce us to apply an imperfect test,
i.e. that the bag should be tied only round the medium's
neck and not over his head. On July the 27th, when Bailey
was put in the mosquito net bag which enveloped his whole
body and head, the seance was a complete failure ;
evidently
because the medium did not risk making a hole in the bag
to pass the apports through. The reason given by the sup-
posed spirit, Dr. Whitcomb, for the non-appearance of an apport
was, as I have stated, that too much material of the bag
enveloped Bailey's head. I pointed out that, if that was the
cause of the difficulty experienced by the alleged Hindoo controls
in producing an apport, 1 could easily overcome it, and that
the netting of the bag would be arranged at the next sitting
so that no part of it would touch the medium's body or
head. Bailey was then apparently unable to think of any
further reasons for not being placed in a bag, and saw that
Dr. Wallace and I were determined that proper tests should
be applied, and that if he did not consent to them his reputation
would be damaged amongst the members of the spiritualistic
body, from whom he obtains his living. There was also a
strong incentive for him to produce the phenomena, which,
if not detected to be fraudulent, would redound to his repu-
tation, as Dr. Wallace, who holds a prominent position in the
spiritualistic world, had informed him of his intention to publish
a favourable report if the results were good. Bailey was thus
brought to bay ; he therefore consented to be put in the bag
on the following evening of the 28ih of July; and determined
to produce apports between the bag and the cage. He did so
208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.
by artfully making a hole at the time of darkness in a corner
of the bag between the folds of the netting, which hole he
hoped would not be detected, and through which he thrust
the two birds. After the exclamations of amazement and
satisfaction made by many of the sitters at the appearance of
the birds, and when he thought that the sitters had come
definitely to the conclusion that the apports were of a super-
normal nature, he deliberately fell on the floor in a pretended
fainting fit, hoping thereby to tear the bag to pieces by the
weight of his body, and thus confuse the issue ; but he only
succeeded in makins; a rent in the front of the bag.
I must now make mention of another suspicious circum-
stance. Bailey at the time that the apports take place, is sup-
posed to be sitting quietly on his chair. At the time that
the light was put out at the last sitting I stood up and placed
one hand on the part of the opening of the cage, and my other
hand on the top. I felt the wooden framework of the cage
move as if tugs were being given to it—this was no doubt
the moment when Bailey was making the hole in the bag for
the two birds to be put through. The cords attaching the
bag to the cage caused the framework to move.
The most incriminating circumstance, however, is the following:
On my return home with the bag, I most carefully examined it,
and in the interior I found pieces of down from birds' feathers.
I emphasize the fact that these pieces of down were in the
interior of the bag and not on the exterior. This shows
that the birds were with Bailey inside the bag before they
appeared outside and between it and the cage. I submitted
these pieces of birds' down to the Public Analyst for Bourne-
mouth, Mr. Eichard A. Cripps, and the following is his report
:
St. Stephen's House, Westminster,
November 4th, 1911.
Dear Sir,
I have carefully examined the specimens which you left with
me and have detected one small mass of birds' feather fluff and a
few isolated strands of the same.
Yours faithfully,
E. A. Cripps.
The circumstantial evidence which I have laid before my
readers undoubtedly points to fraud having been practised by
Bailey at the sittings which I attended. ,

NOTE AS TO THE MARCH MEETING OF THE SOCIETY.
The paper to be read at the Meeting on March 28 th is a
sequel to two articles already published in the Procccdvngs,
Vol. XXII. pp. 397-407, and Vol. XXIV. pp. 150-169. Mr.
Piddington would be glad if members who intend to come
to the meeting would read these two papers beforehand, as by
doing so they would make it much easier both for him and for
Mr. Balfour to explain a somewhat complex case. It may be
added that, in spite of its title, the paper deals only incidentally
and slightly with classical subjects.

GENERAL MEETING.
The 139th General Meeting of the Society was held in the
Large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Monday,
February 19th, 1912, at 8.30 p.m., Sir William Crookes
in the chair.
De. L. Forbes Winslow read a paper on " The Need for
Advance in P.sychology," of which the following is an abstract
:
Dr. Winslow referred to the work of his father, the dis-
tinguished alienist. Dr. Forbes Winslow, who in 1848 started
the Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mented Pathology,
which he edited for sixteen years, after which it was continued
under the editorship of the writer for eight years. He was a
pioneer in the application of psychology to the medical treatment
of the insane, and especially in pointing out the importance
of the question of possible insanity in criminal cases. In
1842 he published a little treatise on The Plea of Insanity in
Criminal C((scs, which had considerable iniiuence in altering
and humanising legal procedure, and his whole life-work and
Mak., 1912. General Meeting. 213
writings gave a great impetus to the scientific study of mental
disease.
Dr. Winslow laid stress on the importance of the mental
factor and the efficacy of suggestion in the treatment also of
the greater number of physical disorders, especially those of
nervous and neurasthenic origin, and he reiterated the view
—
now so generally recognised—that many patients are cured
merely by faith in their physician. This, he said, was
emphatically the case in his own experience, and he thought
it unfortunate that many doctors still tried to deter their
patients from trying the effect of suggestive treatment.
He also lamented the absence of any definite instruction
and training for medical students in the subject, such as
can now be obtained in a certain number of foreign medical
schools. He went on to treat of individual cases to which
suggestion could be applied, and referred to fifteen cases of
inveterate stammering which—after other methods had been
tried in vain—had been placed under his care. These were
treated by " indirect suggestion," the device used being that
the symptoms of the patient were induced by suggestion in
another hypnotised person, who exhibited them in hypnosis,
but was free from them as soon as he awoke from the hypnotic
condition. The patient, seeing his symptoms apparently trans-
ferred to another person, imagined that they had passed away
from himself, and the effect of this idea on him was actually
to prevent their recurrence.
Dr. Winslow said that his attention had been originally
drawn to this plan by Professor Lombroso, in a case of " Folic
de doute," at which they had met in consultation. Further
developments of the method, however, in dealing with other
forms of nervous disorder, and especially with cases of stam-
mering, were based on his own personal investigations. He
had met with great success, for instance, in the case of
a father and sou, the latter aged fifteen, both stammerers.
The boy was cured at the first attempt, after three minutes,
and the father was improved. The first case, said Dr. Winslow,
which he had tried was that of a boy of twelve, who, after
an attack of scarlet fever five years ago, had not been able
to speak, but could only make painful efforts to articulate.
He put the boy in a chair, opposite to the so-called " medium "
to whom his symptoms were to be " transferred," the two
214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1912.
holding each other's hands. He then hypnotised the " medium,"
and asked the boy his own name, to which he replied in his
usual unintelligible manner. He then repeated the question
to the " medium," who imitated the boy's attempt exactly,
making the same grimaces. Dr. Winslow next asked the
" medium " to speak as the boy ought to have spoken, and
the " medium " gave the boy's name clearly and distinctly.
Turning suddenly to the boy, Dr. Winslow then asked, " What
is your name ?
"
and he replied in a perfectly clear way.
After the " medium " was awakened, the boy again gave
his own name clearly and properly.
The cure was permanent and twenty other cases of the same
kind were brought to him for treatment. Out of the first
twelve of these, nine made a complete recovery. These cases,
with many others treated by the writer, were proof of the
efficacy of suggestion, which no doubt was also the explanation
of the remarkable results obtained by the early mesmerists.
To-day it is applied with increasing success to an even wider
range of cases than those with which they dealt.
Dr. Winslow again expressed the view that the medical pro-
fession in England were comparatively backward in availing
themselves of the methods of psycho-therapy, which had made
further advance in France, Belgium and America than in
England.
In regard to the use of hypnotism or suggestion to relieve
pain, he stated that he had the records of twenty cases, in ten
of which suggestion had been tried to assist the effect of an
anaesthetic used for an operation, while in the other ten the
anaesthetic was used alone. Suggestion proved helpful in two
respects: (1) the time taken to produce complete anaesthesia
was reduced from 19 to 10 minutes; (2) the shock of the
operation to the patient was considerably lessened.
At the close of the paper, Dr. Winslow gave a demonstration
of the method of " transference " to which he had referred. The
boy who had been cured of stammering, as described, was brought
on to the platform with the man—also a former hypnotic
patient of Dr. Winslow's—who played the part of " medium."
It was shown that the boy could repeat his name quickly and
clearly and answer questions without stammering ; while the
man, when hypnotised, imitated his former way of speaking.
Dr. Winslow then offered to try the effect of this method
31AE., 1912. General Meeting. 215
of suggestion on members of the audience ; he asked that any
person present who had a headache or rheumatic pains, etc.,
should come forward and he would try to cure it. In response
to this invitation, three ladies in turn came forward. The
man, after being hypnotised, appeared to suffer the pains
—
in the throat, the forehead and the shoulder—which they
respectively mentioned, and they were instructed to look at
him and imagine that the pain was passing from them into
him. After a few minutes he was awakened and declared
himself free from pain. Two of the ladies said they felt no
further pain after this experiment, while the third said she
felt better than before.
The audience were greatly interested in seeing these
•experiments.
TtEPOET OF THE COUNCIL FOE THE YEAE 1911.
The total membership of the Society has slightly diminished
this year. 21 new Members were elected (including one
Honorary and 3 Corresponding Members), and 4 Associates,
became Members; 69 new Associates were elected, and 4
Members became Associates. On the other hand, the total
loss in numbers from deaths, resignations, and other causes
was 25 Members and 85 Associates, leaving a net decrease of
12. The total membership is now 125 5, the numbers being
distributed as follows : Members, 301 (including 2 8 Honorary
and Corresponding Members); Associates, 954 (including 11
Honorary Associates).
During the four previous years, 1907-1910, the total
number of persons belonging to the Society has been respec-
tively 1138, 1190, 1230, 1267. Thus it will be seen that
the present figures exceed those of any other year except
1910, so that the slight falling off shown in 1911 does not
seem a matter for any anxiety.
Three Parts of Proceedings were issued during the year, in
March, June, and August, with an Appendix to the last Part,
published in December, completing Vol. XXV.
One of the most important events of the year has been
the formation of a Medical Section of the Society, which was
instituted by the Council in March and announced in the
Journal for April. There is already a considerable increase
216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1912,
in the number of medical members, the list of accessions
including more than one distinguished American and Con-
tinental name, and it is hoped that, as the Section and its
work become better known, and as medical men become more
interested in the study of suggestion and the psychological
side of medicine, many more will join it. The problems of
suggestion and of multiple personality and minor dissociations
of consciousness are of far-reaching importance in psychical
research ;
they press on us, indeed, more and more urgently
as our work advances, and especially in relation to the growing
evidence obtained through automatic writing relating to the sur-
vival of personality after death. In automatic phenomena, as
Mr. Myers long ago pointed out, the normal types and the
abnormal or pathological types throw light on one another ;:
in both cases we see certain extensions and certain restrictions,
of faculty, and it is conceivable that further knowledge may
lead to a more complete control over the whole field of
mental life, which will enable us to cultivate the favourable
and check the injurious processes of automatism.
The first meeting in connection with the Medical Section
was held in October, when Dr. Mitchell, the Hon. Secretary
of the Section, read a paper on " Types of Multiple Per-
sonality," which is shortly to be published in a special Medical
Part of the Proceedings.
The production of automatic scripts by the various auto-
matists whose names are familiar to the Society has continued
during the year, and two reports on the subject were read at
Private Meetings, one of which has appeared since in the
Proceedings, and the other will, it is hoped, be published
later. This year also was published the first report, by Sir
Oliver Lodge, of the work of a new automatist, Mrs. Willett,.
whose script shows many features of interest. All the scripts
are being carefully studied and analysed, and there is much
important matter in them which will be reported to the
Society in the course of time ;
but, as explained last year, a
great deal of time and labour must be spent on them before
their full significance can be either perceived or expounded in
an intelligible form.
In regard to the important question of what part may be
played by chance in the production of cross-correspondences
between the scripts, a series of experiments was carried out
Mae., 1912. Rei^ort of the Council. 217
by Miss Verrall to test what de.^ree and kinds of similarity
would appear between a number of writings produced by
different persons, independently of each other, and under
circumstances in which it was unlikely that telepathy between
the writers would exert any influence. These experiments, an
account of which was printed in the December Journal, had
some analogy to certain others tried many years ago by
Colonel Taylor to test whether chance would produce any-
thing like the results found in a successful series of tele-
pathic experiments in reproducing diagrams or drawings.^ In
both cases, as might have been expected, a few marked
coincidences appeared in the course of the whole series. But
it was found that they were considerably rarer, and—in the
case of Miss A^errall's experiments—considerably less detailed
and therefore more easily explicable by chance than in those
cases where there was reason for thinking that some super-
normal agency was at work.
Other experiments tried by Miss A'errall with various
members of the Society during the year in automatic writing
and other forms of automatism, with a view to finding evidence
of telepathy, have not so far produced any results of interest.
While it is extremely important to obtain further evidence
of telepathy,—both in order to contirm that obtained by the
Society during its early years, and to throw much-needed
light on the nature of telepathy,—it seems that the faculty,,
in a form sufficiently marked for purposes of evidence, is
by no means common. It is therefore very desirable that
it should be cherished wherever it appears, and that as many
persons as possible should make a serious effort, through fairly
prolonged trials, to discover if they themselves possess it.
The Council hope that many members of the Society will
make the attempt, and, in case of a fair measure of success,,
will communicate with the Secretary.
They wish also to impress on members the fact that it is
as desirable as ever to collect well-authenticated cases of spon-
taneous telepathy, and of veridical apparitions, such as those
seen at the time of death, when the death is unknown to the
percipient. Cases of this kind have been within recent years
very rarely reported to the Society. This can hardly be
because they have ceased to occur ; it is more probably because
1 See Proceeding.'^, Vol. VI. pp. 398-405.
218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1912.
people imagine that their occurrence is so far established that it
has ceased to be a matter of importance or interest. But, as
in the case of experimental telepathy, though there is strong
evidence for the facts, we are ignorant of their real nature
and meaning,—of the laws and conditions governing them ; and
we cannot hope to advance in knowledge unless we are con-
stantly accumulating more facts to work on.
So much attention has of late years been concentrated on
the automatic scripts, the raw material of which, from the
nature of the case, can only be studied by a comparatively
small number of persons, that members of the Society in
general may have felt that their active co-operation in its
work was less needed than before. The Council wish to assure
them that this is by no means their view, but that much
remains to be done in the collection and investigation of
phenomena, especially of the more simple and straightforward
types which many members may have opportunities of meeting
with.
Much assistance has, as usual, been rendered during the year
by Mr. Baggally in following up and investigating a number
of different cases reported to the Society. His experiments
with the Australian apport medium, Mr. Bailey, were de-
scribed at a recent meeting of the Society, and have since
been reported in the Journal. Apart from their importance
in throwing light on this particular case, these experiments,
tlnough the ingenuity with which they were devised and the
thoroughness with which they were carried out, may well
serve as a model to future investigators in similar cases.
Mr. Baggally has also been engaged in a lengtliy and laborious
investigation of an alleged Poltergeist, the phenomena in con-
nection with which are said to have been going on for
several years. They appear to be of an unusual and remark-
able character, and we hope to complete the evidence for the
-case later.
A considerable advance has been made during the year in
dealing with the mass of accumulated records of Piper sittings.
A large selection of these was published in the Proceedings
last year ; most of the others do not seem to be of sufficient
importance to warrant their publication ; but a type-written copy,
with certain omissions, is being prepared, which will be acces-
sible to serious students of the subject at the Eooms of the
Mar., 1912. Report of the Council. 219
Society. The preparation is a lengthy matter, because the
records include many private details relating to the personal
affairs of some of the American sitters, who are not willing
that these should go beyond the individuals to whom the
original records were entrusted. It is therefore necessary to
have all these details cut out from the type-written copy
referred to. The Council believe, however, that this will not
detract much from the interest of the records, whether from
the evidential point of view or as a psychological document.
The Society has suffered a great loss during the year by
the death, on October 5 th, of one of its earliest and most
zealous members, Lieutenant-Colonel Gr. L. Le M. Taylor.
Colonel Taylor spared no time and trouble in the work in
which he was so deeply interested, and his reports were a
model of clearness, scientific accuracy and impartiality. An
account of his work was printed in the October Journal. It
was announced later that he had left to the Society a legacy
of £300, which has since been received.
It has already been reported that the Society has been
fortunate enough to benefit considerably under the will of one
of its former members, Mr. H. A. Kay. This gentleman, who
died in January, 1908, devised and bequeathed to the Society
his residuary real and personal estate. After payment of duties,
costs, and certain prior legacies, this residue was found to
consist of 10 shares of £12 10s. each, and £100 4 per cent,
preference stock in the Prescot Gas Company; £175 4 per
cent, debenture stock, and 300 deferred shares of the nominal
value of 5s. each in the South Staffordshire Tramways Company
;
a reversionary interest expectant on the death of ]\Iiss Margaretta
Kay in a sum of £1100; and also certain house property,
originally of copyhold tenure but since enfranchised, in the
small town of Prescot, Lancashire.
The Prescot Gas shares and stock and South Staffordshire
debentures have been retained, and produce a steady income.
Having regard, however, to the circumstances of the case and
of the Society, the Council deemed it desirable to convert
into present cash the reversionary interest referred to ; and in
pursuance of a resolution to this effect the sale was effected
in October last, and produced the net proceeds of £392 2s.,
which sum was at once invested in authorised securities. In
view, also, of the fact that the house property is old, and that

its management involved a considerable amount of trouble in
the matter of repairs and renewal of tenancies, the Council
resolved that this property, the rents of which have been
received up to the present time, should also be sold, and the
proceeds invested in proper securities. The sale was effected,
partly by auction, partly by private contract, in December
last. By reason of the necessity of procuring the concurrence
of the Charity Commissioners in the conveyances, the contracts
have not yet been completed, but no difficulty is anticipated
;
and the Society may expect very shortly to receive between
£2000 and £3000 for investment from this source. The
total net benefit may be estimated as considerably over £3000.
For the successful carrying through of the long and com-
plicated business connected with this bequest, through which
it has now been brought into the most convenient practical
form, the Society is greatly indebted to the labours of our Hon.
Treasurer, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, and our legal member of
Council, Mr. Sydney C. Scott.
The Council are of opinion that the Library is not made
use of so much as it might advantageously be by students of
Psychical Research. The accommodation for readers is at
present, perhaps, somewhat cramped, and the Council are
looking out for opportunities of making more commodious
arrangements.
We may add that an interesting and significant event of
the. year has been the inclusion of a book by Professor, now
Sir William, Barrett, on Psychical Besearch in the " Home
University Library of Modern Knowledge." It is a notable
advance that the promoters of such a series should recognise
that the public both need and desire instruction on the subject.
Two General and four Private Meetings of the Society (for
Members and Associates only) were held during the year.
The dates and subjects of the papers read were as follows

fessor W. P. Barrett, F.E.S.
March 28th. "The Automatists' Knowledge as a Factor

Personality ami Telepathy. By F. C. Constable. (Kegan Paul,
Trench, Triibner & Co. London, 1911. 330 pp. 7s. 6d. net.}
Mr. Constable's theory is that human personality, as we know it
in this Avorld, is a partial manifestation of a spiritual self existing
out of time and space and called by him the intuitive self. Thi&
theory he deduces from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Part L
of his book is mainly occupied in justifying this, and in
attempting to show that memory is a function of the intuitive self,
which, in relation to the human personality, stores up intuition in
time, so that the human personality has potentially a full storage
of ideas of its past experiences to M^ork with. Readers who do
not care for abstruse discussions are told that they may omit this
part and confine themselves to Parts IL and IIL, and perhaps
therefore we maj^ be pardoned for not attempting in this brief
notice to deal with it further.
The main purpose of the whole book is to prove that we, as
incarnate beings, or, as Mr. Constable expresses it, as human per-
sonalities, can know from experience in this world that the intuitive
self exists. He makes a special point, it must be observed, of
limiting the expression " human personality " to mean the partial
manifestation of the intuitive self in our universe. This is of
course a mere Cjuestion of definition, and no doubt the definition is
a convenient one for the statement of Mr. Constable's arguments.
But it is rather confusing to give a new meaning to an expression
already in common use. The readers of Mr. Constable's book, for
instance, who are familiar with Mr. Myers's Human Personality and
its Survival of Bodily Death must constantly bear in mind that,
when Mr. Constable speaks of human personality, he does not
mean what Mr. Myers does. Mr. Myers means a conscious entity
which, though in the body here survives, as he endeavours to show,.
224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1912.
the death of the body. Mr. Constable means a conscious entity
compounded as it were of soul and body, the self as incarnate and
subject to the conditions of this world, so that by definition it
cannot as a human personality survive bodily death. Mr. Myers, in
using the phrase, wishes to emphasize the persistence of the real
self through the death of the body. Mr. Constable, on the other
hand, wishes to emphasize the limiting nature of the conditions
belonging to this world, among which he includes, as already said,
space and time. His intuitive self may—he believes it does—survive
the dissolution of the body and brain, but this dissolution necessarily
involves, according to his definition, the death or destruction of
what he calls the human personality (p. 90).
Telepathy is another word used by Mr. Constable somewhat
differently from most of us, for he includes in it potentially pure
clairvoyance—the perception of material phenomena otherwise than
either through the senses or through other minds. He defines
telepathy as in the first place the timeless and spaceless communion
between intuitive selves and between intuitive selves and the
external, and in the second place, when manifested in incarnate
human Ijeings, as communication between them or between them
and the external otherwise than through the normal organs of
sense.
That telepathy is a fact he holds to be sufficiently proved by
the investigations of the Society for Psychical Research, and using
chiefiy the material collected by the Society, Parts II. and III.
of his book are mainly occupied in showing how it carries with
it evidence of the existence of the intuitive self, and how obseiwed
facts fit into his theory. In experimental cases telepathy can be
manifested only in limited and particular ways, while among spon-
taneous cases we should expect to find all possible manifestations of
telepathy in operation. Spontaneous cases, therefore, as (in his
view) theoretically more important, take precedence in his book, and
the discussion of them occupies Part II., while Part III. deals with
experimental telepathy and other psychical phenomena in which
volition is an element.
It is evident that there is much in common between Mr. Constable's
notion of an "intuitive self" and Mr. Myers's "subliminal self,"
as Mr. Constable himself admits. It is therefore not surprising to
find that Mr. Constable's interpretations of the phenomena he deals
with are to a great extent similar to those already familiar to readers
of the Proceedings and of Phantasms of the Living and Mr. Myers's
book. He has, however, thought the questions out for himself,
which gives a certain freshness and originality to his way of looking
at things, and therefore, though we cannot say the book is easy
reading, we think that thoughtful readers may find it suggestive,
even when they are not disposed to accept the author's philosophical
theories.

A Poltergeist Ciise, -------
A POLTERGEIST CASE.
The following case was reported to us by a gentleman who
called at the Eooms in October, 1911, to consult the Secretary
with regard to an investigation of the disturbances described.
These were occurring in a house in a London suburb, and had
been brought to his notice by a girl, hereafter referred to as
" C," who was employed by his mother as a daily servant.
C. lived in the " haunted " house as the ward of the tenant,
Mr. H., and shared a bedroom with his daughters, A. and B.,
but for reasons which will be shown in the appended accounts,
our informant, here called Mr. Henry Brown, wishes her identity
to be concealed. We therefore substitute assumed names for the
real names and addresses, which were sent to us, of all the
persons concerned.
The Secretary fully discussed the case in conversation with
Mr. Brown on two or three occasions. Immediately after the first
interview, on October 13th, 1911, he wrote, at her request, the
following account
:
[The house] has been tenanted by the present family for fourteen
vears, and no trouble was experienced until a month ago. Then
began the knockings, which I shall presently describe, and they have
continued with more or less regularity ever since. Mr. H., the
householder, is quite at a loss to account for them, nor have I yet
heard any explanation other than a supernatural one from any one
else. The diagram below [representing the top floor of the house]
will dve some idea of where the " srhost " is located. He has made
his home in a small six-roomed house of the ordinary London type,
and, ordinarily, haunts the top back room. To the rear of the

" haunted " room is another back room in which the boys of the family
sleep. In front of it is the bedroom occupied by the parents. In
the corner of the " haunted " room is a bed, in which three girls
sleep (ages about IG) [C, however, was about 19]. The letters A,
B, and C mark the position of the pillows [and of the girls referred
to by the corresponding initials], the eldest girl occupying A. A
fireplace juts out from the middle of the western wall, and there is
some odd furniture round the western corners of the room. The
window is at The arrows in the diagram point itpstairs. The
houses on either side of the "haunted" one are occupied.
These knockings began, as I say, about a month ago. At first
the parents thought it was imagination on the part of the girls, and
April, 1912. A Poltergeist Case. 227
ridiculed their fears. In course of time they became convinced that
something was wrong, and took up the floor. I understand that no
trace of vermin or mechanical instruments was found. The knock-
ings continued even when the floor was up, and a few days later
the parents called in the police. By this time the floor had been
relaid. According to one of the girls, the policemen made them
hold up their hands. They placed a mirror so as to reflect from
under the bed. And they saw the boards tremble, but only that.
They were quite at a loss to account for the noises, and were unable
to end the nuisance. The information up to this point was given
me by one of these girls [C], who works for my mother as a daily
servant. Her story is corroborated by Mrs. H.
As matters had become serious, I, who do not believe in spiritualism,
agreed to visit the house with a friend who does (Mr. F. W.). I
must confess that I, being a student of physics (among other things),
was decidedly sceptical. I was convinced in my own mind that the
affair was a practical joke. However, I was anxious to see the
trouble ended, and we arranged to visit the room on Tuesday last.
It is significant to note that the phenomena now ceased for a few
days.
Last night, however, about half-past eleven, we were sent for
in post haste. The " ghost " was on the war path. We hurried
down, and were fortunate enough to hear the entertainment. My
father accompanied us and witnessed the business as well. The
knockings came intermittently as on previous occasions. When we
looked under the bed we heard them still, but saw nothing. But,
when my father actually got under the bed, the noises ceased. The
" ghost " would talk no longer. But he promptly resumed conversa-
tion when his sphere of influence was left undisturbed.
I was bound to confess, of course, that there was something here
that I could not explain in terms of physical science, for the girls
were absolutely still during many of the knockings. The boys were
in the middle of the room with nothing in their hands. Nothing
was to be seen, but my father says he felt vibrations. I personally
did not, and did not try to do so. I quite believe, nevertheless,
that a disturbance which would produce so large a volume of sound
could easily give rise to perceptible vibrations. As the matter was
altogether beyond me, I left it to my spiritualistic friend, Mr. W.
He began by telling the spirit that he wished to speak to it.
He said the code would be : one knock = no ; two knocks = doubtful
;
three knocks = yes. The "spirit" answered promptly and decisively
228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1912.
"yes" or "no" to every question, never giving two knocks for
doubtful, and never leaving a question unanswered.
Here follows a detailed account (of which the original con-
temporary notes were afterwards sent to us) of communications
made by raps in response to Mr. W.'s questions. The com-
municator, after purporting to be the spirit of a . man named
Jack Morgan, who was, however, known to be living, claimed
identity with his younger brother, who had died two years ago,
and asserted, as his reason for causing the disturbances, that he
wished the three girls to sleep apart. The communications are
of a trivial nature ; the correct statements that were made
referred to the age of Mr. Henry Brown, the number of persons
bearing his surname in the I'oom, and the initial of the
surname of one of his friends, Mr. E., who was present.
Mr. Brown continues : • . .
•
. ;. .
I may add that the "ghost" is not only candid in regard to
his misleading statements (admitting that he is a fraud), but very
ready with his answers. He has, moreover, been taught a comic
song, and he will rap out an accompaniment to some of the lines
in fine style. He can now manage it unassisted. He imitates the
roll of a kettledrum with marvellous reality, and can make a noise
like sawing wood. He will knock on the floor, the wall, or the
underneath part of the mattress, on request. Thus lie combines
with his versatility an obliging disposition. I forgot to mention
that he confessed himself unable to rap anywhere except under the
bed, and in answer to my question whether he was willing that
his noises should have scientific investigation, he said " N^o." How-
ever, I have so far disregarded his wishes as to relate his doings
to Miss Newton.
Some of the noises are quite loud, some feeble. Some are sharp
and distinct, some slightly muffled. The thuds on the floor are,
on the whole, much louder than the taps on the wall. I cannot
account for them m3'se]f, and I keep an open mind in regard to
their possible supernatural nature.
I quite understand that my statements may be discredited b}'
subsequent investigation, but I am absolutelj^ convinced of the
accuracy of what I have related. The girl who works for my
mother [C] told me that after we had left, the noises continued
until 5.0 a.m., and that they saw wisps of straw floating in the
air. I do not, of course, make myself responsible for other people's
April, 1912. A Poltergeist Case. 229
statements. I have, indeed, tried to distinguish between what I
have investigated for myself and what is merely report, and between
what I know to be correct and what I merely believe to be correct.
If the girls can be persuaded to sleep together to-night, I hope,
on Miss Newton's suggestion, to sprinkle flour under the bed to
try and detect signs of mechanical knocking. I will do my level
best to ensure that the girls be not given any idea that they are
under suspicion. I am willing to do everything in my power to
unravel the mystery, and cordially welcome any assistance whatever.
Henry Brown.
The following day Mr. Brown wrote :
October lith, 1911.
I did not last night visit the house ...
Our maid [C] tells me this morning that the three girls slept
last night in the same room but in three separate beds. All they
heard was a few small taps in the same corner of the room. They
will, however, sleep together to-night, and send for me if anything
is heard. Their father tore up the mattresses yesterday, but found
no sign of anything suspicious. She says that occasionally the
sounds are much louder than any 1 heard the night before last.
On one occasion [the] father burnt brimstone in the corner, and the
following night some tremendous bangs were heard. Perhaps the
brimstone was an unhappy choice. One can quite understand any
self-respecting evil spirit taking it as an indelicate hint.
I must confess that the more I consider the phenomena, the more
difficult I find it to accept your theory that it is the girls. It
would want something as heavy as an ordinary flat iron to make
some of these sounds, and such an instrument could not be
manipulated as delicately as the "roll of the drum," for instance,
would seem to suggest. Indeed, it is not merely a roll, but a
regular tattoo. Of course, various instruments may be in use. I
forgot to mention, too, that the visitant can knock on the under-
neath part of the mattresses. A girl in bed could hardly do that.
At the same time, I willingly recognise that your experience of
this sort of thing is worth more than my convictions, and I will
accordingly investigate along the lines you have suggested. Still, I
feel I ought to keep a very close watch on other members of the
household.
I regret to say that the news of this affair is spreading all over
the neighbourhood. It has not yet, however, reached the papers.
I would fui'ther add that the noises did not come at unexpected

times when no one was on the look-out. Whenever a question was
asked on Thursday night, it was always promptly answered, save
when some one was under the bed.
The following day Mr. Brown wrote
:
mh October, 1911.
Referring to the mysterious noises at the house in ... , I have
made a further investigation and, I believe, got to the bottom of
the mystery. Of course, I will not claim to be certain, but I will
ask you to consider the subjoined remarks and to favour me with
your opinion in the matter. . . .
I went down to the house at 12.0 midnight Saturday, with Mr.
W., my father, my sister, and another friend, hereinafter named as
Mr. E. We took down a large mirror and a powerful acetylene
lamp, to show us what was going on under the bed ; also a supply
of flour. The girls had not gone to bed when we arrived. Outside
the house was a large and excited crowd, engaged in furious
discussion. I went in, had a quiet talk with Mr. H., telling him
what we were going to do, and asked that the girls might go to bed.
They had scarcelj' settled down when the knocking began. Mr.
W. had started putting questions to the " ghost " before I was able
to get upstairs, as I first made an examination of the other rooms.
I had wished to reserve this questioning as a last resource, since
you had said that nothing reliable usually came of it. But Mr. W.
. . . forestalled me. He announced that he would put to the ghost
a series of questions. Would it answer them? Yes! The questions
were of such a nature that we could verify the accuracy of the
answers.
We oinit the details that follow. The first question was
ambiguously answered ; the rest referred to personal matters
connected with Mr. W., who was a stranger to Mr. H.'s
household. Mr. Brown continues :
Out of the nine questions one, the first, may have been answered
either correctly or wrongly. We do not know. The remainder
were either answered incorrectly or not answered at all, either one
way or the other. Obviously our ghost was not so well informed
as on last Thursday evening. Meanwhile, we had been experiment-
ing. We found that when any one looked under the bed, or shone
a light under it, the knocking ceased. So we sprinkled the flour
under there.
April, 1912 A Poltergeist Case. 231
In reply to further questions we were told that the visitant died
a natural death, but would give no particulars of it. That he was
not now happy, but some day hoped to be. He agreed this
knocking would make it longer before he was happy, and that it
would be to his advantage not to come and knock. He admitted
we knew something about it, and believes it would be better for
himself if he did not come. But he will not go away. He under-
stands he is acting again.st his own interests, and he is making
himself unhappy. He has a reason for doing so. It is not to
annoy the girls but to send a message. This will satisfj' him, and
he will promise to send a sensible one and not such a one as last
time. The message [was] Be careful, B. Do please.
He answers further questions to the effect that he has a special
interest in B., and if she promises to be careful he will not worry
any more. She understands what he means. If another lady took
the place of one of those in the bed he could not come. (Note ! I
had arranged beforehand for my sister to take the place of these girls
•one by one, and see what effect it had on the knocking.) He said
that this banging made him tired. That he was not so fresh after it.
During this second lot of questions, I kept a very close eye on
the girls. They were all absolutely still. The one in position
marked A had both hands showing. B. had
one hand showing, but was lying on her back
in such a way that I could have detected
the slightest movement of either arm. C.
was lying on her right side, with her back
touching the wall, her right arm underneath her
and her left arm under the bedclothes, but
in such a position that I could have detected
a small movement. (I will not, in this case,
.say the slightest movement.) Well, we carried
•on the spirit conversation to the point which
I have reported. I then tuld the girls to put their hands together.
•C. was the only one who demurred. She said, " What ! Have we
got to hold our hands together ? Oh Lor !
" She had considerable
trouble in getting her right hand from underneath her. As she did
so, I noticed a tinge of colour cross her face. But this may have
been due to exertion and not necessarily to a guilty conscience.
When her hand appeared, I noticed she wore a ring on the finger
next to the little one [on] the right hand.
Now after we had their hands together we could get no more
ABC

knocks. I said nothing of what I suspected. Mr. W. suggested
that the spirit had said all he wanted to say and was now sati.sfied.
So far as I could see, every one else accepted this view. I next
had the bed moved. In the far corner, . close up to the walls, the
flour bore marks of having been pressed or beaten down. Its
appearance was consistent with the supposition that the girl C. had
knocked on it with her ringed finger, the sharp clear taps being
caused by the ring, . but the muffled ones by her knuckles. I now
examined the wall at the side of the bed. It apparently had some
traces of flour on it. My father pointed out that the plaster there
had been scraped, and this was probably some of the debris. But
the scrape appeared to be an old one. The debris would have been
brushed away by now. And even allowing that only the finest of
the plaster dust would have stuck to the wall, I think this powder
was too fine to be that. I next had to consider whether it was flour
scattered there while my father was sprinkling. Well, it was only
on the wall [by the side of the bed] ; there was none on the wall
[at the head]. And again, it was close up to the corner and nowhere
else. I therefore concluded that in all probability it was flour brushed
up to this particular area b}^ the sleeve of a nightdress, especially as
some of the dust was ahove the scoreil mark on the distempered
wall.
To return to the tlooi-, the flour had been shaken away from a
circular area of about 10 ins. diameter, about 8 ins. from each wall.
The flour had been compressed in the position indicated in the diagram
[not reproduced]. I next examined the under side of the mattress,
for, after the flour was put down, most of the knocks were made
on the under side of the mattress. I found some flour there, well up
in the corner. It was too thick, I am sure, to be accounted for by
supposing that it had lodged there when the floor was sprinkled.
I think it was first caked slightly on the floor by pressure, and then
transferred to the corner of the mattress. In short, the evidence of
the flour seems to point almost exclusive!}' to the guilt of the girl C.
I believe she did the " sawing " by scraping the ring backwards and
forwards along the floor. The kettledrum could also be caused by
the ring, but that would not be so simple. Still, she has had five
weeks' practice. The ring is of this pattern.
It is all metal—no stone.
Well, I left the house with my mind pretty
well made up. But I said nothing of my suspicions. For during
Saturday I had read Chap. V. of Mr. Podmore's book. Studies in
April, 1912. . A Poltergeist Case. 233
Psychical Research, and the article on Poltergeists in the 7th edition
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and I formed a strong opinion that
the people who do this sort of thing do it not out of cussedness, but
because they cannot help themselves. Therefore they ought not to be
made to suffer for it. So I thought it urgently necessary to keep
the culprit's identity secret, while it was not urgently necessary that
all the rag-tag and bob-tail of . . . should know all about it. . . .
I decided on this course of action before I left the house last night.
I returned [home] and found that my sister had similar suspicions
to my own, though on different grounds. She said that just before
we left, the girl C. came to her in great agitation and concern, with
bloodshot eyes, and tremulously asked "What have they found out?
"
And she was the only one of the family who did not come down to
the door to see iis out. I therefore took my sister into my confidence
and availed myself of her help.
Our next step' was to test whether a girl lying in this position could
make so much noise with a ring like this. We found it would be not
only possible but easy, which possibly accounts for the fact that the
noises have been heard for so many weeks. . . .
Mr. Brown here explained that he tried to obtain a private
interview with C, in the hope of inducing her to confes.s, but
in spite of his efforts to see her, she managed to avoid him.
He continued :
In the forenoon I had revisited Mr. H. to test the accuracy of
some of her statements. And I found that the tale about two police-
men having come in to investigate was an entire fabrication. I
therefore cannot accept any of her statements, but I have enough
first-hand information to pint [her] under grave suspicion. Indeed, I
might fairly say I have found her guilty, but on circumstantial
evidence.
Later he adds :
I have just been down to see the girl's guardian. . . . We told him
(for Mr. E. was with me) that we were pretty sure we understood
the cause of all we had seen and heard. But we could not explain
to him without casting suspicion on some one, and this we cuuld not
do. We warned him against anything in the nature of a dramatic
exposure, as this might cause a nervous breakdown or worse.
For the future, I made the following recommendations: (1) If
nothing more happens, do nothing, say nothing, reveal nothing, be
wary. (2) If the knocking recurs, shift the positions of the girls in
234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1912.
the beds. Make them change places. (3) If this does not stop it,
push the bed right close up against the wall, but do this only as a
last resource, as it might give rise to suspicions. (4) If the knock-
ing still continues, send me a note at once. He quite approved of
this . . .
In response to our request for the several vpitnesses' inde-
pendent statements, Mr. Brown vs^rote :
October 22nd, 1911.
Mr. W. told me he was making out a report, but I understood
it was because he differed from the rest of us, believing that a
spirit made the noises. I think you can trust him for a faithful
account of the matter from the spiritualistic point of view, and he
may quite likely throw further light on the subject. Unfortunately
we have all been discussing the pros and cons of the case together,
a,nd have more or less modified each other's views. But, broadly,
my father and sister and Mr. E. incline to my own views, and Mr.
W. holds to his own.
I am asking the others of us to furnish accounts of the matter.
As for Mr. H., I doubt if I can get much out of him, ... he knows
less of the happenings on the nights when we were there than we
ourselves do, as he was not present at the investigations. I think
I shall do best to ask him for an account of what happened previous
to our coming, and for some information about the girls. . . .
I doubt if the affair has quietened down sufficiently to make it
advisable to approach the suspected girl for a confession. It has not
yet reached the local papers. But rumours of the affair are still
rife in . . . and, needless to say, very much garbled and highly
coloured. For example, the "ghost" is credited with making
the floor jump up and down, breaking an iron bedstead in two, and
so on and so forth. Indeed, there seems to be no limit to what
some people are capable of believing.
Discussing the difticulties of explaining the deception, he
adds
:
The whole of the difficulties are only disposed of by supposing
that a spirit took possession of the girl's mind and caused her to
do these things. But then, at once, another difficulty arises. For,
according to Podmore, this would imply a state of secondary con-
sciousness. And I can say, most emphatically, that the girl was
not only quite herself during both investigations, but very much
herself. Henry Brown.
April. 1912 A Poltergeist Case. 235
We received corroborative accounts from Miss Dora Brown
and Mr, Edward Brown on October 27 th, 1911. Miss Brown
writes as follows
:
My brother, Mr. H. Brown, has asked me to write you my
account of the knocking we heard at a house in . . . I believe
tny brother has already mentioned that the girl C, whom we
suspected to be the perpetrator of the knocking, is in service
at our house. For three weeks she came to work every morning
with tales of mysterious knocking, which she said commenced
directly she, and the two girls with whom she slept, went to bed.
Apparently these noises were not heard except when the three
girls were in the bed, and when heard continued for anything from
one to three hours.
The girl seemed very upset, and began to look ill. This my
mother put down to fright and insufficient sleep, and so sent her
to bed one Friday afternoon. She slept from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and
my father and brother promised to go to the house to try and
account for the knocking. However, nothing was heard for the next
few nights.
On the following Thursday, when the girl came to work, she
said the knocking had come again and had lasted from 11.30 p.m.
till 4 a.m. Also, there was a sawing noise and the mattress was
torn. It appeared that many of the neighbours had been in and
heard the noises, and the bed tipped when a woman sat on it;
also, there was something said about the police being called in, but
my brother proved the latter to be incorrect. When the girl left
to go home on Thursday evening, she promised to send word if the
knocking was heard that night. She sent about 12.30, and my
father, brother, and two gentlemen friends went to the house. On
their return they told me they had heard the noises themselves,
and all except my brother, Mr. H. Brown, seemed to think they
were due to a spirit, as Mr. AV. had received answers to questions,
which he put in a code recognised by spiritualism. My brother
declined to agree with the spirituabsm idea, but said he could not
at that stage give a theory. On the night following (Friday) the
girls slept apart, and nothing was heard. It was then arranged
that they should again sleep together, and the four gentlemen and
myself should go to the house the next night (Saturday), as my
brother, since the Thursday, began to think one of the girls must
be making the noises, so wished to experiment by dusting the flour
236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil, 1912.
under the bed, and thought he might find me useful. My own
reason for going, however, was as follows: Mr. W., who has some
belief in spiritualism, had accounted for the knocks only occurring
when three girls were in the bed by saying that a spirit obtained
its power to knock from the three girls, the energy from two being-
insufficient.. He apparently thought this explained the tale of the
bed tipping when a fourth female sat on it. Myself, I thought it
would be interesting to note if the bed tipped when I made the
fourth person. It did not do so, and I have now come to the con-
clusion that, with only two occupants in the bed, the guilty party
could not lie close enough to the wall to knock without exciting
suspicion.
The above were the only reasons which induced me to join the
party on the Saturday, for until then I felt (luite convinced that the
spirit theory was the correct solution to the mystery, and on
arriving at the house I was surprised to find there seemed nothing
supernatural about the sounds.
When I entered the room I noted the three girls lying on a double
bed in one corner of the room. The bed was against the wall, and
our servant C. lay next to the wall, B. in the centre, and A. on
the outside. Immediately I glanced at the bed my brother's theory
came to. my mind, and I decided to watch C, not because I thought
her guilty, but because I saw she was the only one whom my
brother could fairly accuse as such. I then sat on a chair facing
the bed, and Mr. H., jun. (it was evident the H. family believed a
spirit to be responsible for the noises) asked several questions and
received a satisfactory number of taps in reply. Then Mr. W.
asked several questions, mostly questions which our maid, the girl
C, would be in the position [to answer] correctly; these were
answered correctly, but of the questions which touched things she
would not be likely to have an intimate knowledge of, the majority
of the answers were wrong. During these questions, I noticed C.
remained in one position on her right side, slightly turned from
the wall, her left hand outside the counterpane. From her position
I did not think her able to do more than knock on the wall, but,
on lying in the same position on different beds at home, I found I
was able to make all the sounds that I heard on the Saturday,
including the sawing noise, which can be done with either a thimble
or a ring. The girl C. was wearing a ring on her right hand. One
of the questions asked by Mr. W. required a number for an
answer. The taps commenced steadily, but suddenly stopped short,
April, 1912. A Poltergeist Case. 237
and C. raised herself a little in bed^ saying at the same time:
"Oh, get up, Sid j
you know it won't go if any one gets on the
floor." Sidney H. replied: "I'm not on the floor." At which the
girl lay down, and the tapping continued. The boy S. H. was
sitting in a corner where it would be difiicult for C. to see him,
but I should think the Misses H. could see him more easily from
where they lay. After a few more questions, my father went under
the bed to sprinkle down the flour ; but the girls understood that
this was to see if the noise went on with him under the bed. It
did not do so, and having finished with the flour Father came out,
and further questions were asked and replies given. Finally, the
supposed spirit was asked to give a message, which I believe you
are already acquainted with, and after which nothing more could
be got from it.
The gentlemen then left the room. I remained while the girls
dressed to see that the flour was not tampered with. When the
girls got out of bed they remarked about the flour, and A. and
B. H. were a trifle curious and amused ;
C, however, seemed a
trifle concerned. AYhen dressed the girls were sent into an adjoin-
ing room by themselves. The gentlemen then came back to the
bedroom, moved out the bed, and inspected the floor and wall, the
results of which my brother has communicated to you. Having
finished their investigation, the gentlemen again left the room, and
the girls leturned to complete their dressing. C. immediately rushed
to me and exclaimed: "Oh! Miss Dora, what have they found out?"
Her manner was so agitated, and she seemed so upset, that my
suspicions were considerably aroused. The other girls seemed quite
calm ; but C. was pale, trembling, and her eyes slightly bloodshot.
I told her we couldn't make anything of it, and she seemed relieved.
For several days after the above occurrence nothing was heard,
and then one morning the girl had been in about two hours, and
for several minutes stood looking into the fire. She then looked
up, and said they had heard the raps the previous night ; three
soft knocks on one occasion. I should think this untrue, judging
from her manner and from the fact that she usually spoke of the
knocking immediately she arrived in the morning ;
also, she spoke
to no other member of the family about it, and I thought she
seemed glad that I let the matter drop. About a week after, I
visited [the house]. She again told me she had heard knocking. She
told no one else, and she this time said it [was] under the chest of
drawers. I questioned her as closely as possible without arousing
her suspicions, but could get nothing very definite from her ; but
from what I gather [from] the other girls she (C.) was seated on a
chair near the chest of drawers sewing.
The above remarks are correct to the best of my recollection.
Dora Brown.
The following account is signed by Mr. Edward Brown and
Mr. E.:
238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1912.
On Thursday, Oct. 12th, about midnight, I went to . . . with
Mr. W. and my son. The house in question was a small one of six
rooms, including the back addition. We were at once asked upstair*
to the back room, in which were several people, besides the three
young women in the bed. We were given every facility to-
investigate.
I had at first assumed that the affair was a fraud, but the trick
was worked so neatly that I became convinced that some super-
natural power was at work. Several questions were put in a code
of knocks, and answers were given which were mostly right. But
there is nothing mysterious about that, as the girl C, who slept
next to the wall, had been daily maid to my wife for some months,
and most of tlie questions were about family affairs. No communi-
cation could be got from what I will term the spirit when I went
under the bed, where the knocking appeared to be done. Neither
could we get any knocks, either on the wall or on the floor, if I
looked under, which roused my suspicions again. But, as I said
before, it was so well worked that for the time being we were
bewildered, and we left promising to come again if sent for.
We called again, accompanied by Mr. E. and my daughter, on
Saturday, October lith. The girls had not yet retired, so we
waited awhile. As soon as they got into bed the knocking began.
I made a careful examination of the adjoining rooms, and found
nothing suspicious. I then joined the party. Mr. W. was com-
municating with the " spirit " as before, but directly I got under
the bed all was quiet, so I sprinkled the floor with flour. After
communicating for two hours we made the girls dress, and my son
examined the bedding and floor. We found a circle of about ten
inches cleared away as if by force of air, and three marks, evidently
where the tips of the fingers had struck the floor. There was a
small irregular patch of flour about three-quarters of an inch wide
on the underneath part of the mattress, not far from the corner.
And there was some white powder on the lower part of the wall
near the corner, which may have been flour or may have been
plaster scraped down in moving the bed. AVe felt there was nothing,
further to lie done, for the messages had stopped coming directly
the girls were told to hold their hands together.
When we announced that the disturbance would now cease, the
girl C. came to my daughter in an agitated manner and asked what
we had found out. I think it has been hinted to her clearly that
it must not occur again, and it has now ceased.
Edward Brown.
I agree with the above account.
Arthur Everett.
Mr. W.'s account, which was sent to Mr. Brown on October
31st, 1911, is as follows:
On Thursday, the r2th October, I proceeded to the house in...
Street, and made my way to a room on the first floor, in which the
April, 1912. A Poltergeist Case.
knocks -were said to be heard. Arrived there, I found some ten
or twelve people who had congregated to hear the knocks. In a
bed in this room were three young ladies, the gas was full alight,
and no secrecy maintained. Upon our entering, one of the party
already in the room asked the author of the knocks (which throughout
this paper I shall refer to as the spirit for the sake of clearness
and brevity) to knock, whereupon I heard four very loud knocks.
It was then requested to saw, and I heard a sound which was an
exact representation of a hand-saw at work. This knocking was in
close vicinity to the bed. Directly after knocking was heard on the
opposite side of the room, and one of my companions asked if there
was anybody in the next room. He was informed that it was the
next house, and was the children's bedroom. The knocking then
sounded from various parts of the room, once hitting the mattress
from underneath, then knocking on the frame of the bed, sometimes
also on the wall. I then proceeded to put questions to the spirit.
(As some time has lapsed since the above happened, I do not
guarantee that the order in which I now state the facts was the
order in which I heard them on the said night.) My first remark
was, " I want you to answer me some questions ; if your answer is
yes, knock three times ; if no, knock once ; if you are doubtful,
knock twice." I then said, "Do you understand and three knocks
came in response. (When I speak of the answer being yes throughout
this paper, I mean that three knocks came, similarly no or doubtful.)
I then asked if this spirit was a male spirit. The answer came
"Yes." In reply as to whether it claimed to be anything super-
natural, the answer was "No." By questions I then obtained the
following information. It said it was the spirit of a person who died
two years ago at the age of eighteen by a natural death, that it
knew the three girls who were the occupants of the bed, had an
interest in them and refused to refrain from knocking. It stated
that it was aware that it was annoying people, but gave a decisive
" No " when asked to desist. In answer to my question as to
whether it would refrain from annoying the girls, it gave a very
emphatic NO. I asked if it could continue to knock if there were
only two girls in the bed, and the answer was NO. I therefore
advised that two girls should sleep in the bed and the other by
herself. TMs was done, and I was afterwards told that no knocking
was heard. Among the answers to my questions it told us the age
of one of my friends which nobody in the room knew except his
father] how many people they had left in their house and how
many people I had left in my home. The answer to the latter
question was not known by anybody in the room other than myself,
as three people who usually slept in my home were not in the
house on that night. All the questions were answered correctly.
On leaving the room with my friends four very loud knocks were
heard, and I went back and said "Good-night," when the four
knocks again came as loud as before. The knockings that I heard
did not come from one place only, sounding from the wall at the
240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil, 1912.
end of the room, sometimes from the wall at the side of the bed,
once from the wall on the opposite side of the room from the bed,
several times on the bed itself, when I felt the bed shake, and one
knoi^k was on the under side of the mattress, apparently about the
centre.
On one occasion the eldest girl sat up affrighted, the knock being
right against her head. On first enquiring whether it had a message
it wished to communicate, it replied -"No," but when we afterwards
asked it for a message, it sent the following :
" Devil is," when I
refused to take any more of the message and accused it of sending
nonsense, to which it agreed.
It gave its name as Morgan.
I think it was arranged with one of the girls by one of my friends
that they should again sleep together on the Saturday night to
see if the knocking came again, and I arranged to go round on
that evening.
I went round to the house about midnight, and found that the
girls had not retired to bed. They did so, however, while I was
there, and the knocking commenced directly.
I at once went up to the room, while my friends investigated the
room adjacent and underneath this bedroom.
When I entered the room I believe all three girls were sitting up
in bed. The brothers of the girls commenced to ask it questions
[and answers were given as before by ra]3s]. My friend then told the
girls to put their hands together, and I again asked it a question.
It did not answer, and after they had again resumed their natural
positions, it still did not knock in answer to our questions, and has
not, I believe, again been heard. We afterwards examined the floor,
and found that the floor was clear of flour in a circle of about
ten inches, when I remarked that this—meaning the floor clear of
flour—showed the knock was a material one, there being no marks
on the flour to show that the knock had come from the top of
the boards.
Fred. Wilson.
Later, in reply to a question put by the Secretary, Mr. W.
added, " in my opinion the raps were not produced by either
of the girls. In coming to this decision I have considered
the matter carefully."
We heard from Mr. Brown on March 26 th, 1912, that no
further disturbances have occurred.

DOWSING EXPEEIMENTS WITH ME. J. E.
By W. W. Baggally.
Just previously to my departure for the Continent for my
summer holiday in July last (1911) I received a letter from
the Secretary of the S.P.E. to the effect that she had had a
communication from Mr. J. E., of Lewes, saying that he was
desirous that the Society should investigate his powers as a
dowser, and that he had successfully located the spot where
a spring of water was afterwards found in a garden in the
neighbourhood of Lewes. The Secretary wrote to me to ask
whether, as I resided in Brighton, not far from Lewes, I would
undertake the investigation of the case. I replied that I should
be pleased to do so. I wrote to Mr. E. and asked him whether
it would be convenient for me to visit him in September on
my return to England, and on the 16th of September I received
a reply from him as follows
:
Please excuse my long delay in replying to yours of the 29th
of July, as I have been away from home since the time you
mentioned that you would be away. I shall be at liberty during
next week, and after that I shall again be away for a week or so.
If we can arrange a time, I shall be very pleased to meet you and
show you what I can do [in the way of dowsing]. The garden in
question is enclosed and locked, and in the occupation of Mr. W. W.,
grocer, of , Lewes. He will let us have the key if he knows
what day you are coming, and no doubt will tell you how he
obtained the water and the quantity.
244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1912.
I replied that I should do myself the pleasure of calling on
him on the 22nd of September. I accordingly went to Lewes
early in the afternoon of that day. On enquiry I found that
Mr. E.'s residence is situated on the outskirts of the town. I
was enquiring at a shop for the way to Mr. E.'s house when
a passer-by informed me that he was Mr. W. W., the owner
of the garden where the spring of water had been found, and
that he knew that I was coming to Lewes that day. I arranged
with him to have a preliminary view of the garden before I
called on Mr. E. He accompanied me to the garden. This
garden is about two acres in extent. It is used by Mr. W.
as a market garden, and it forms part of what is known as
the Landport Allotments.
On examining the spot where the water was located by
Mr. E., I found that the water did not spring from the ground,
but that a pump had been placed over the spot, and by means
of this pump the water is obtained. In reply to my questions,
Mr. W. informed me that Mr. E. was not a professional dowser,
but a man of means, who had retired from business, and who
had, he believed, made his money by farming. Mr. W. had
heard that Mr. E. had the dowsing faculty, aird as he had been
inconvenienced by the want of water in his garden, he had
requested Mr. E. to try his dowsing powers. Mr. E. had
located water in several parts of the ground, amongst them in
the one where the pump stood. His men had dug for the
water at this spot, as it was conveniently situated in the middle
of the garden, and they had found the water at the depth of
ten feet from the surface of the ground. When digging, the
men had found that the ground was loam, with veins of flint,
and at the depth of ten feet, when they came to the water,
there was sand. Mr. W. had had no other experiences of Mr.
E.'s dowsing powers, and it was the first time that water had
been found in the garden. On my enquiry whether there were
any springs of water in the neighbourhood, Mr. W. informed
me that there was one on the other side of the hedge on the
east of the garden. This spring had been there a long time,
and it was at a distance of about a hundred yards from where
the pump stood. ,
•
The market garden is at the bottom of a valley surrounded
by hills of chalk formation. The chalk formation is about two
Mat. 1912 Dou'sing Experiments with Mr. J. E. •245
hundred yards away on the west side of the garden, and on
the east side the chalk hills are at a distance of about a mile.
The Eiver Ouse runs through the valley, and is situated about
a quarter of a mile from Mr. W.'s garden towards the east.
The following sketch will show roughly the position of the
market garden relatively to the surrounding hills, and also to
the river
:
Mr. W. told me that the surface of the ground where the
water stood was ten feet above the level of the river.
After I had made these preliminary enquiries and examina-
tion, Mr. W. accompanied me to Mr. E.'s residence, which is
not far from the garden and on the side of the hill on the
west of the valley. Mr. E., in the course of the conversation
I had with him, imparted the following information.
The first time he discovered he had the dowsing faculty was
when he accompanied the late Mr. Joseph Long (who, I under-
stood, was a professional dowser well known in Lewes) over
the property which a friend was about to purchase. Mr. Long
was proceeding to go over the property for the purpose of
discovering water, and he had previously given a twig to
Mr. E. to hold, when to the latter's surprise the twig turned
simultaneously with that held by Mr. Long. I asked Mr. E.
whether, when this took place, he was watching Mr. Long. He
replied that he was not quite sure, but to the best of his
recollection he was not doing so. Mr. E. informed me that
he did not often use his dowsing powers, but at Wopsbourne
Farm, Shettield Park Estate, near Newick, he had located water
at places where Mr. Long had previously located it. He did
not know at the time the places where Mr. Long had dis-
covered the water. Mr. E. had also been successful in finding
water at Mr. Gaston's house, Westlands, top of Chailey Common,
Mid-Sussex.

246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1912.
I formed a very favourable opiuioii as to Mr. E.'s honesty.
We held an interesting conversation as to whether the dowsing
faculty in certain persons was due to their being influenced by
the electrical condition of the ground, which might presumably
be diflerent where water or metals lay below from that of other
ground where they were absent ; or whether it was due to the
possession of a clairvoyant faculty by the dowsers. The late
Mr. Long held to the theory that it was due to electrical action,
as when he wore india-rubber soles to his boots he lost the
power. Mr. E., however, found that his wearing india-rubber
soles made no difference. He had noted that the twig rose
when he passed over water, but it bent downwards when he
passed over iron, as in the case of an iron pipe concealed
underground. He had formed no opinion as to the cause of
the twig's motion. He thought that a holly twig was the
most sensitive.
We discussed the manner in which the force acted. Mr. E.
pointed out that if it were electrical, its strength would be
inversely as the square of the distance from the underground
stream. Therefore a twig would begin to be affected before the
dowser arrived at the spot directly over the stream. He had
found that this was not tlie case. The twig became suddenly
affected only when he came to the spot immediately over the
stream.
After our conversation Mr. E. volunteered to try some ex-
periments. He proceeded to walk down the inclined path
which led from his house to Mr. W.'s market garden, holding
at the time the ends of a forked twig of hazelwood, one end
in each hand. I followed him. The twig did not rise till he
got to within a few yards of the garden. He then told me
that there was water under that spot. As I was following him
down the path I hid, unknown to him, a sovereign under a
stone. I did this with the object of trying whether he possessed
the clairvoyant faculty of discovering hidden gold coins, which
Professor Barrett has reported to our Society that Miss Clarissa
Miles possesses. Before entering the garden I asked Mr. E.
to retrace his steps, not informing him what object I had in
view. He was holding the twig, as previously described, in
his hands. He passed over the spot where the sovereign was
without the twig moving. One experiment of this nature is
Mat, 1912. Dousing Experiments %vith Mr. J. E. 247
not, of course, sufficient to test whether or not Mr. E. possesses
clairvoyant powers. I hope to try some further experiments
with him on these lines. He has consented to try them with
me.
On again descending the garden path, Mr. E., at his own
suggestion, closed his eyes. When he came to the spot under
which he had previously said that water existed, he passed
over it and the twig did not move. There was a sheet of old
iron lying at the side of the path. To show me that iron
caused the twig to bend downwards, he approached it, and
when he stood over it the twig bent down. I told him that
experiments of this nature were unevidential, and that unless
lie dowsed for water or metals at places where the water or
metals were concealed and afterwards the places were dug to
prove to me that he had dowsed correctly, there was no evidence
of anything supernormal. He quite agreed with me.
We then entered the garden. It is nearly square in form
and has paths running at the four sides. He proceeded to
dowse along the west path. The twig indicated the presence
of water at two places. When the twig rose Mr. E. marked
the place by drawing a line across the path with his boot.
He then proceeded a step or two, and when the twig resumed
its normal position he made another line with his boot. The
place between the two lines indicated, he said, the width of
the stream. He marked in this manner the width of streams
in two places.
I asked him to trace the course of one of the streams. He
did so walking diagonally across the garden, the twig remaining
raised in his hands as he stepped over the vegetables which
lay in his path. While he was on the other side of the garden
with his back turned to me (I remaining on the west path),
I, unnoticed by him, erased with my foot the four lines which
he had made to mark the width of the two streams. I then
made four other lines at different parts of the paths and then
called him back and requested liim to go over the west path
again and verify the width of the streams. He acceded to my
request, but instead of the twig rising over the places under
which he had previously said water existed, it missed them and
rose over the new places which I myself had marked with
fresh lines.
248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1912.
I will now state the conclusions I arrived at as to the
experiments I witnessed on this occasion ; but before doing so,
I will make a few brief observations as to the position and
nature of the ground of the garden and its relation to the
surrounding country.
As shown in the sketch, the soil on which the garden stands
is alluvium. The garden is in a valley at the foot of chalk
hills, down the surface of which the rain water would naturally
descend to the valley and accumulate under the ground. The
Eiver Ouse runs through this valley. The level of the water
of this river is ten feet below the surface of the ground where
the pump stands. Now the depth that had to be dug to
reach the water in the garden was ten feet, so that the level
of the river and that of the water under the pump correspond.
In my opinion it would not have mattered at which spot
Mr. E. had indicated the existence of water, as it would have
been found in any part of the garden. I was confirmed in
this conclusion by the fact that (as Mr. W. told me) when the
liiver Ouse is up, the water in the pump rises correspondingly.
The old spring on the outer east side of the garden, which I
was told existed there, was not flowing when I was shown the
spot. This was due to the dry weather that prevailed this
summer, in consequence of which rain water had not descended
for some time down the surface of the hills into the valley below.
Without forming an opinion whether Mr. E. possesses genuine
dowsing powers or not, I came to the conclusion that the
action of the twig in his hands in these experiments was due
to auto-suggestion on his part. With his eyes open he passed
over a place under which he said water existed, and the twig
then moved ; but when he closed his eyes and passed over the
same place the twig failed to move. The turning down of the
twig when he stood on the iron sheet was due to the latter
being in his view, and he then through unconscious self-
suggestion caused the twig to move downwards. In the same
way the four new lines which I had made in the garden path,
which lines he saw and thought that he had made himself,
caused him by auto-suggestion to miss the places under which
he originally had declared there was water, and also caused
him to move the twig over the new places marked out by me.
I have only one more observation to make. On one occasion.
May, 1912. Doivsing Experiments tcith Mr. J. E. 249
after the twig had risen in Mr. E.'s hands and he still ilrnily
held the two ends, he asked me to watch one end of the twig
as he gradually opened his hand. On his doing so I saw the end
of the twig which had been in his hand give one or two turns
as if unrolling itself. He remarked that this was a proof that
he had not raised the twig himself, but that the twig had done
so of its own accord. In fact, he said, when he used a slender
twig, the two ends had sometimes been broken off' flush to
his two hands. I immediately tried an experiment with one
of the twigs which he had asked me to carry when we started
from his house. I held it firmly in the same manner as he
held his twig, and I caused the forked end to rise upwards.
I found that this action caused the two ends to remain in a
twisted condition in my hands, and as I held them firmly, they
could not untwist till I loosened my hold. I can well conceive
that the two ends of a slender twig could be broken off' by
twisting up the forked end. This breaking off' of the ends of
the twig has been put forward as evidence by dowsers that
they do not move the twig themselves. But neither the twisted
condition nor the breaking off of the ends of a twig, when the
forked end is raised, offers to my mind any evidence of inde-
pendent action on the part of the twig.
I would not imply by what I have written that I am of
opinion that the dowsing power does not exist ; for I have
not had sufficient experience to come to any conclusion on
this subject, either adverse or favourable.
CASE.
G. 286. Collective.
The following account of a supposed apparition of a cat was
sent to us on March 4tli, 1912, by an Associate of the Society,
to whom the principal witnesses are personally known. The
names and addresses of all those concerned have been given to
us, but since allusion is made below to matters of private family
history, pseudonyms are used here. It will be observed that
the case was recorded within a week of its occurrence.
Juhj \2th, 1909.
My sister, H. L. Green, had a very favourite cat called Smoky, a
pure-bred blue Persian of peculiar shade and small. There was no
250 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research. May, 191l'.
other cat in the village in the least like her. This spring she
became ill, and died about the middle of June, 1909. The gardener
buried her, and planted a dahlia over her grave. Shortly before
Sniok}' died she had been worried by a dog, and had her ribs
broken, so that she walked quite lame. This injury was the final
cause of her death.
On Tuesday, July 6th, 1909, my sister and I were at breakfast, and
I was reading a letter aloud to her. I was sitting with my back to
the window, v.'hich was on my sister's left. Suddenly I saw her
looking absolutely scared, and gazing out of the window. I said
"What is the matter^" and she said " There's S/ho/j//, walking across
the grass!" We both rushed to the window, and saw Smoky, look-
ing very ill, her coat rough and staring, and walking lamely across
the grass in front of the window, three or four yards from it. My
sister called her, and as she took no notice, she ran out after her,
calling her. I remained at the window, and saw the cat turn down
a path leading to the end of the garden. My sister ran after her,
calling her, but to her surprise, Smoky did not turn nor take any
notice, and she lost sight of her among the shrubs. About ten
minutes afterwards, my sister and a friend living with us saw
Smoky again, going through a hedge in front of the window. My
sister again went out after her, but could not find her. She was
next seen about half-an-hour afterwards by the servant, in the
kitchen passage. She ran to get her some milk and followed her
with it, but the cat walked away, and from that moment she dis-
appeared completely. We made every enquiry of the neighbours,
but no one had seen her, or any cat like her. Of course we
thought there had been some mistake about her death, though our
friend, the gardener, and the boy had all seen her dead. The
gardener was so indignant at the supposition that he had not buried
the cat, that lie went to the grave, took up the plant, and dug up
the body of Smoky.
We are quite mystified at the occurrence, which was witnessed
by four people, namely B. J. Green, H. L. Green, Miss Smith, and
Kathleen B. (servant). When last seen the cat was walking towards
House, next door, where she had lived all the winter and
spring. But when my sister went over there, the people at
House had seen nothing of her. When my sister frst ran out after
her, the cat nm away in front of her, moving fast, but on one side,
as she did before she died.
B. J. Green.
May, 1912. Case.
The account is also signed by Miss H. L. Green and Miss
D. W. Smith. Miss B. J. Green says in a letter :
" We did
not ask tlie little maid to sign it, as we did not wish her to
dwell on the occurrence."
The difficulty in such a case is to exclude the possibility
that what was seen was a real cat ; the percipients were
evidently aware of this difficulty, and, as stated above, at once
made enquiries amongst their neighbours, but with a wholly
negative result. The peculiar appearance of the cat and the
nature of the surroundings in which it was seen make it
improbable that in a small country place a real animal could
have escaped all previous and subsequent observation. In reply
to our enquiries ^liss Green writes :
March 9tli, 1912.
Our garden is a fairly large one, over half an acre, and is eutirelj'
surrounded by a wall. The high road runs on two sides of it, and
on the other sides are our own house and Uvo houses with gardens,
both belonging to relations. Neither of these houses had any cat
in the least like ours, nor had the people seen one in their gardens.
There is a "spinney" about 100 yards up the road, but none nearer,
and each time the cat was seen it was going in the opposite direction
to this wood—-once towards tlie end of our own garden, where it
seemed to go into a beech hedge which screens the stable, etc. (My
sister examined all this part, but could see nothing.) The last time,
it was going towards the wall separating our garden from that of
House (my cousin's house, in which my sister had lived for nine
months while the owners were away ;
they had lately returned to
it). It did not jump upon the wall, but seemed to disappear as
it got near it. A tree on the other side of the wall shades this
part of the garden. . . .
When I saw it, I was at a large window, which reaches within
half a foot of the floor. Outside is a verandah, with glass tiles,
about two yards in width ;
beyond this a grass-plot with flower-
beds. When my sister and I saw the cat, she was on the grass,
just beyond the verandaii, in full sight from the window. I stood
•at the window, while my sister ran out after her, and I saw the
cat walk slowly across the grass towards a path which bounds
the grass-plot. My sister says she rem down this path, but I could
not see this, as a holly- hedge hid the path from me.
I may add that I have never in my life seen anything super-
normal, nor had our friend, Miss Smith ; but my sister has twice
252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1912.
seen curious " visions " or apparitions, though she is the most practi-
cal, "common-sense" person imaginable. Our father was Scotch
(Gallowa}'), our mother English.
I have wondered sometimes whether my sister's sight of the cat
could have been conveyed to the other percipients telepathically, so
that they saw what was present to her vision.
In reply to a letter asking for a further account of her
sister's visions Miss B. J. Green writes
:
March Uth, 1912.
In reply to your enquiry about my sister's experiences, I will
write down (from her dictation) exactly what they were.
As a young girl of eighteen to twenty she spent two or three
years with cousins at C- . [The] house was supposed to be
haunted by an old lady, but nothing was said to my sister about this,
and it was only after her expeiience that she was told of the
supposed haunting.
My sister was in the habit of sitting up late in her room, studying
or reading. One night when she was doing so, she heard, as she
thought, her cousin coming along the passage to her door, which
was open. She hastily blew out her light and kept quiet, fully
expecting a scolding ! But the steps returned down the passage
again. Next morning she said laughingly to her cousin, " You
nearly caught me last night ; I suppose you saw me blow out my
light." Her cousin said, "I never came down your passage at all;"
but made no further remark, and my sister supposed it must have
been a servant, but, feeling a little nervous, she took care to go
to bed in good time. Some time afterwards she woke up with
the feeling of a " presence " in the room, and, looking up, saw a
figure bending over her. She was really alarmed, and hid her face
in the bed-clothes. When she looked up the figure was gone. This
time my sister was both alarmed and angry, and at breakfast next
morning she told the story, and said she was going to cjuestion the
nurse and other servants about it. Then our cousin begged her not
to do so, and told her that the house was said to be haunted, and
that queer things had often been heard there. After this my
sister locked her door ; but she was a very sensible, non-imaginative
girl, and she heard nothing further of the "ghost." At the end
of two or three years she came home, and did not visit C
again for several years. Then she stayed in the same house, but
on the lower floor, and though she remembered the story, and half
expected to see the old lady, she saw and heard nothing whatever.
Mat, 1912 Case. 253
The third time she stayed there she had a very curious experience.
This was two years later. She slept on the upper floor, but in a
different room, and as she had seen nothing on her last visit, she
expected no apparition at all. One night she woke up quite sud-
denly. She looked up, and there, over her shoulder, against the
wall, was a man's head—the head only. It was quite clearly seen,
as if it were lighted in some way, though the room was dark. It
was a young face, with short beard^ and very sad eyes, as if they
had tears in them. She was so startled that she called out "Go
away, go away !
" and hid her face for a moment. When she
looked up the face was gone.
She has always said, since, that she is very sorry she was not
brave enough to speak to the apparition.
Her next (and last) experience was, I think, the most curious of all.
She went, a year or two later, to stay with a married half-sister
near B who was in very great trouble and in some personal
danger. After staying with her about a month my sister was anxious
to come home, and had almost decided to do so. Early one morn-
ing (it was getting quite light enough to see plainly) she woke up
with the same sensation of a " presence," and saw kneeling by her
bedside, with eyes fixed on her with an entreating expression and
hands clasped, a woman's figure. She recognised the likeness in the
face, partly to a picture of my half-sister's own mother (which hung
in another half-sister's house), and partly to my eldest half-sister (not
the one she was staying with). She felt quite certain, in a sort of
flash, she says, that it was my half-sister's own mother who was
there, and asking her to remain with her daughter. The figure
disappeared almost directly (my sister thinks she started up, or i)ut
her hands up, she is not quite sure wliich), and it just went. But
she took it as a real request, and stayed on as long as she was
needed. (The reason she thought of leaving was because her presence
did not seem to benefit my half-sister as she had hoped.)
These are all the things she has seen. But please do not imagine
that she is hysterical or nervous. She is a trained nurse, very
accurate, and particularly calm and quiet in manner. She is the only
one of our family who has "seen anything" (except for my share
in "Smoky's" apparition), and I think any one who knew her would
say that she was a most unlikely " ghost seer." But she is a person
of strong will and has much influence over others, and it was this
quality which made me think that my vision of "Smoky" might
have been telepathic from hers.

My father's first wife died more than two years before he married
again, and about six years before my sister was born.
B. J. Greex.
I have read over this account and can vouch for its accuracy.
Helen L. Green.
In a subsequent letter Miss B. ' J. Green writes:
March 29th, 1912.
There is one more observation I should like to make re the
" Smoky " story. My sister is not sentimental about animals, and
though very sorrj' for the cause of Smoky's death, she was rather
relieved when the suffering was ended, as she knew the cat could
not recover from her injuries. She had certainly not fretted over
her death. I note this lest any one reading the account should
imagine that my sister was in any hysteiical grief over the cat's
death.
Miss H. L. Green's earlier experiences, whether subjective in
origin or not, add to the probability that her vision of the cat
was hallucinatory, since they show that she is subject to vivid
visual hallucinations. It should be noted that she was the
first person to see the " apparition " of the cat, which lends
colour to her sister's suggestion that we may have here a case
of collective hallucination resulting from suggestion ;
—verbal
suggestion, however, rather than telepathic, seeing that the i
three subsequent percipients all knew, when they saw the cat,
that it had been seen by Miss H. L. Green.
The same explanation does not necessarily apply to each of
the three appearances of the cat. The hypothesis that what
was seen was a real cat mistaken for Smoky is most plausible
in regard to the servant and least plausible in regard to the
Misses Green ;
inversely, the evidence for collective hallucination
and suggestion is in their case strongest. It is difficult to
think that two persons, having good normal eyesight, could be
completely mistaken as to the identity of an animal presenting
several marked peculiarities, with which they were perfectly
familiar and which they had on this occasion an excellent
opportunity of observing. On the other hand it may well be
that Miss H. L. Green, having experienced, as on previous
occasions, a vivid subjective hallucination, was able to convey
it to her sister. The case gains much in value from the fact
that those concerned are thoroughly competent observers, as
may be judged from the reports printed above.

DUBLIN SECTION OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL
EESEARCH.
Report for the Year lOlL
Since the last Annual General Meeting on January 26th,
1911, the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research
has had another year of fairly successful work, taking into
consideration that definite results and advances in positive
knowledge of occult phenomena are so dilficult to obtain. But
increased interest has been displayed by the Members in all
branches of the subject, and there has been an increased
attendance at the meetings. There are now 105 members on
the list after writing off the names of a few who have resigned,
and of several others who had not paid their subscriptious
for the previous year. The Committee note with pleasure
that the more recent members who have joined appear to
be just as keen in their interest in the subject of Psychical
Research as the older members. Since last year we have
changed our place of meeting, and our new quarters at No.
8 Dawson Street appear to be most suitable for our purposes
;
we find the Secretary of the Y^M.C.A. most obliging and
anxious to meet our wishes and always ready to assist person-
ally in making arrangements for the comfort of our meetings.
The Committee are pleased to observe that our Library
has been fairly well patronised by the members and several
new books have been added during the year. During the
year j>ist closed, we have had thirteen sectional meetings
(besides the Annual General Meeting) at which addresses and
papers were given by the Members, always followed by general
discussion. Of these thirteen papers and addresses, three were
given by Sir William Barrett, the subjects being (1) Polter-
geists, (2) Recent work in connection with Psychical Research,
and (3) Mesmeric Effluence versns Hypnotic Suggestion. Some
of these papers received prominent notice in the public press.
It is a matter for congratulation that at the end of the
financial year ending December olst, 1911, the Dublin Section
was in a state of financial prosperity, the Hon. Treasurer having
reported that he had a balance of £12 6s. 2d. in hand after
discharging all our liabilities.
The Dublin Section received with very great pleasure the
announcement that its highly-esteemed chairman. Professor
Barrett, had had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him.

REVIEW.
The Evidence for the Supernatural: a critical study made with uncommon
sense." By Ivor Ll. Tuckett, M.D. (Kegan Paul, Trench,
Triibner & Co., Ltd. London, 19n. 400 pp. Price 7s. 6d. net.)
This book is disappointing. A rumour—perhaps false—preceded it
that Dr. Tuckett considered that he had demolished the work of
the S.P.R. We therefore awaited the appearance of the book with a
little anxiety and a good deal of curiosity, thinking he might have
discovered weak points in our treatment of psychical research which
had escaped our own notice. It turns out, however, that he mainly
addresses himself to readers of such works as Mr. Beckles Willson's
Occidtism and Common Sense or the popular psychic treatises of Mr.
Thomson Jay Hudson, and his treatment of his subject is corre-
spondingly superficial.
Dr. Tuckett does not appear to have much acquaintance at first
hand with the work of our society, but he has devoted a long
appendix to criticism of the first Report on Mrs. Piper—that in
Vol. VI. of the Proceedings, which gives an account of her English
sittings in LS89—which he selected for careful reading. He
classifies and discusses weak points which he observes in the evidence
given in this report, but they are weak points which we have
never overlooked and therefore add nothino; to our knowledge. The
newest thing in his treatment of S.P.R. evidence is an attempt in this
appendix to show that bias in the estimation of evidence has been
exhibited by tlie founders of the Society generally, and by Mr. Mj'ers,
Professor William James, Dr. Hodgson, Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr. Leaf,
Mr. Piddington and Mr. Podmore in particular. Whether he succeeds
in this we must leave his readers to judge, but we may readily agree
with him (p. .354) that " However much we may think we are on
our guard against the fallacies connected with [bias], we are still
liable to be its victims. This is true of every human being "
—
including, as Dr. Tuckett would fully admit, himself.
He concludes his review of Mrs. Piper's case by " a few remarks
about cross-correspondences," although, as he admits, he has " not
made any detailed study of the subject." His limitation of his
study of Mrs. Piper to her earlier sittings has led him into an amus-
ing slip, for he assumes that as there was contact in these there
was also contact later, so that muscle-reading will explain some
s\;ccesses in 1907. This is typical of his somewhat loose method of
dealing with the evidence.
Dr. Tuckett's main aim is to show that supernormal explanations of
phenomena are often adopted on insufficient grounds. This naturally
leads him to choose weak cases as illustrations ; but unfortunately
he then seems sometimes to confuse them with strong ones. With
the aim itself the S.P.R. has no quarrel, but it is to be regretted
that a man with a scientific training which might have enabled him
to deal usefully with the subject should have undertaken the task
without adequate information. In the absence of this his criticisms
fail to have any real value. E. M. S.

CASES.
L. 1187. Eeciprocal.
The following case of a reciprocal telepathic impression occurring
to two persons at the same time has been communicated to us
by Mr. W. W. Baggally. Both Miss Emma Steele and Mr.
Claude Burgess, the lady and gentleman concerned in the
case, are known personally to Mr. Baggally.
Miss Steele writes as follows
:
16 & 17 SillWOOD Place,
Brighton, March Ulh, 1912.
Mr. Claude Burgess, who is an invalid, had been staying at
my private hotel, at the above address, for some months. He left
on February 15th to take up his residence at No. 10 Belgrave
Place, Kemp Town, Brighton. In the interval between the date of
his leaving and the night of the 5th inst., when I had the remark-
able dream (if it can be called a dream) which I am about to relate,
I had not seen Mr. Burgess and nothing had occurred to cause me
to think particularly about him.
On the above night I retired to rest at my usual time. I awoke
finding myself standing in the middle of my room and answering,
"All right, I'm coming," to Mr. Burgess, who, I thought, called
three times :
" Miss Steele ! Miss Steele ! Miss Steele !
"
By the time I had put on my dressing gown and lighted the gas
I was fully awake. I then remembered Mr. Burgess was no longer
in the house. I looked at the clock and noticed it was exactly
3 a.m. When I came downstairs next morning, I told my cook
my dream, and remarked I hoped nothing had happened to Mr.
Burgess. During the next day, Wednesday, 6th March, in the after-
noon, a man called while I was out and left a note from Mr.
Burgess, which I enclose. I was much surprised by its contents.
It struck me most forcibly getting it from him, as he is paralysed
and has to write with great difficulty with his left hand. He veiy
seldom writes now, so it must have made a great impression on him
seeing me as he relates in his letter. Emma M. Steele.
The letter from Mr. Burgess to Miss Steele referred to
above, which is now in our possession, was as follows
:
10 Belgrave Place, Brighton.
My dear Emma,
I had a funny dream about you last night. I dreamed
that you appeared at about 3 a.m. Just a glimpse of you. It's
funny, isn't it 1 Yours, Claude Burgess.
260 Jouimal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.
Miss Steele's cook made the following statement to Mr
Baggally :
March 13//t, 1912.
On Wednesday morning, the 6th March last, Miss Emma Steele
came down from her bedroom at 8.30. I saw she was looking pale.
I asked her if she were not well. She replied that she had had a
strange dream. She heard Mr. Burgess call her three times. She
told me that she suddenly jumped np and put her dressing gown
on. By the time she had put on her dressing gown and lit the gas
she remembered Mr. Burgess had left the house. She said it was
about 3 o'clock a.m. when she heard Mr. Burgess call.
(Signed) Sarah Pollard.
The following statement was written by Mr. Baggally on
March loth, 1912, from Mr. Claude Burgess's dictation:
On Tuesday night, 5th March, 1912, I woke up at about 3 a.m.
with a start. I saw Miss Emma Steele standing at the door of
my bedroom. I had closed the door, but she appeared to have
opened it. She was attired in her ordinarj' dress.
I was much surprised. It was an absolutely distinct apparition.
I had not been thinking of her the previous day and I cannot tell
why she appeared to me.
The apparition lasted about five seconds. I was not at all
frightened and went to sleep immediately after.
I was so struck by what I had seen that, next morning, the
(jtli March, at about 11 o'clock, I wrote a letter to Miss Steele
which I handed to Mr. WilHam Watkins, the proprietor of the
establishment where I now reside, for him to send to Miss Steele.
In this letter I told Miss Steele that I had dreamed that she had
appeared to me on the previous night.
(Signed) Claude Burgess.
In reply to Mr. Baggally's personal enquiries, Mr. Claude
Burgess stated that it was the first time that he had had a
hallucination of this kind, and he had not had one since.
Statement hij Mr. Williavi Watldns.
10, Belgrave Place,
Brighton, March IWi, 1912.
Mr. Claude Burgess delivered to me a letter which he had written
to Miss Steele, at about 11 a.m. on March 6th, which I handed to
a man of the Church Army Labour Home to take to Miss Steele.
The same morning at 8 a.m. Mr. Burgess told me he had dreamt
of Miss Steele. William Watkins.

Statement hy Mr. Bagijcilly.
I called on the afternoon of the 13th March, 1912, at the offices
of the Church Army Labour Home, St. James Street, Brighton, and
saw the Secretary, who showed me an entry in their books confirming
the fact that, at the recjuest of Mr. William Watkins, a man in
their employ had delivered a letter to Miss Emma Steele of
16 Sillwood Place, Brighton, in the afternoon of 6th March, 191:2.
I have interviewed all the persons connected with this case and
they confirmed their respective statements. W. W. B2\GGALLY.
In reply to our further questions as to whether Mr. Burgess's
experience was a dream or a waking hallucination, Mr. Baggally
wrote to us on April 1st, 1912 :
I had an interview with Mr. Burgess to-day, and the following
is the information I received from him respecting the points you
raise. He said to me :
"(1) I used the word dream in my letter to Miss Steele for
want of a better word. (2) I woke up and then had the vision of
Miss Steele. (3) I did not notice anything in the room at the
time I had the vision. The room appeared dark. (4) Miss Steele
appeared to me in a bright light, not self-luminous or phos-
phorescent, but just as she would have appeared in daylight. She
appeared to me in the part of the room where the door was."
Mrs. Baggally sends us the following statement enclosed in
a letter dated April 27th, 1912:
I was in the drawing-room of Miss E. Steele's sister on the
evening of Wednesday, March Gth, when Miss Emma Steele came
in, saying in an excited manner, " Where is Mr. Baggally ^ He will
be so interested in this."
She held in her hand a letter from Mr. Burgess, and proceeded
to tell me that the previous night she had heard, as she thought,
Mr. Burgess fall on the floor of the bedroom over her own. She
sprang out of bed. Finding herself in the middle of the room she
heard him call " Miss Steele " three times. She then suddenly
remembered that Mr. Burgess was no longer living in her hotel.
She struck a light, looked at the clock and found it was 3 o'clock.
The following morning she felt so tired that when giving orders to
her cook, the latter noticed her fatigue and commented upon it.
She told the cook the reason was that she heard Mr. Burgess
apparently calling her at 3 o'clock.
Miss Steele proceeded to say that Mr. Burgess had, curiously
262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, June, 1912.
[enough], sent her that afternoon the note which at that moment
she held in her hand and in which he told her that he dreamt
she had appeared to him at 3 a.m. the previous night.
Miss Steele appeared much impressed and wondered if anything
had happened to Mr. Burgess. I informed my husband that same
night on his return home, [of] what Miss E. Steele had told me.
Laura E. Baggally.
On my return home on the evening of March 6th my wife
related to me what appears in her statement above.
W. W. Baggally.
A LETTER oivinii' a short account of the two foUowino- cases
appeared in lAnht on March 16, 1912. The Editor kindly
foi'warded a letter of enquiry addressed by us to his correspondent
and we are now able to print a more detailed report of the
incidents together with several corroborative statements. The
names of those concerned have been submitted to us, but by
their request pseudonyms are used here.
L. 1188. Reciprocal Dreams.
Mrs. Barnard writes on Feb. 21, 1912, in a letter to a
friend, which has been sent to us
:
Francis and George have had measles at school. I was anxious
about them.... On Sunday, Feb. 11, we were up nearly all night;
Grace, aged three, had croup and Baby Betty had influenza. D.
[Mrs. Barnard's husband] looked after Grace and I the baby. My
thoughts were often with Francis ; twice during the night I lay down
on my bed and slept a little ; each time I woke up telling Francis
to be careful of Betty. I thought he could not sleep and wanted
to put his head on my shoulder and could not because of Betty.
To-day [Feb. 21 i]
he writes, "I only had two nights when I could
not sleep. You seemed quite close all night, only Betty would come
between. You would not put her down. Do tell me what you did
all Sunday night. You and Betty were with me all night. Were
you thinking of me? You ought to have been asleep."
Upon the evidence of this letter alone, it might seem that the
date referred to by Francis Barnard was Sunday, Feb. 18, not
Feb. 11, but his statement, printed below, makes it clear that
the earlier date is meant, when his illness was at its height.
In reply to a request for his corroboration of Mrs. Barnard's
^ The letter was received on Fel). "21, 1912.
June, 1912. Cases. 263
statement Mr. Barnard writes in a communication received by
us on April 2, 1912 :
On Feb. 11 we were both up with sick children the greater part
of the night. L. [Mrs. Barnard] had Baby Betty in her arms all
night, sometimes in bed. We were both worried about the two boys
at school with measles. L. v/as under the impression that Francis'
head ached. She wanted him to put his head on her shoulder, but
was afraid he would hurt the hahy. Francis' next letter said that
his mother was with him all night, but the baby was in the way.
I am very sorry we burnt the letter for fear of infection of measles.
We have also obtained a statement from Francis Barnard
(aged 13) as follows :
Jpril 15, 1912.
In February, 1912, George and I had measles at school; on
Sunday, Feb. 11th, I felt very bad and worse as night came on and
whether sleeping or waking I felt my mother was close beside me
and Baby B. was in her arms and much in the way. Afterwards I
found she had been up all that night with baby, who was ill, and
thought and dreamt of me all night. She thought I wanted to put
my head on her shoulder and could not because of B. She woke
Daddy up saying "Mind B. You Avill hurt her." When I came home
I was very surprised, for this was just what had happened. The
second thing that surprised me was that mother knew that I was in
the big dormitory the third bed from the door. This was just where
I was. No one could have told her. I could not write and no one
else did. I was moved when I was ill in there and was not in my
own room. [Signed] Francis Barnard.
In regard to the last part of Francis Barnard's statement
Mrs. Barnard writes on April 15, 1912:
No one told me he [Francis] was not ill in his own room. I
all the same knew he was in the big Dormitory and his bed was
the third on the door side. This I told him the day he returned
and he was astonished. I know his own room so well and I have
only once been in the big Dormitory.
L. 1189. Dream.
In her letter of Feb. 21, 1912, quoted above, Mrs. Barnard
also writes
:
Another curious dream happened last Friday [Feb. 16]. I
ilreamed my aunt Miss R. was being pulled up and down in a lift
;
the lift was not painted and looked like zinc. Miss W. was pulling
204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.
her up and down. My mother told me it was silly of Miss W. to
try to do it, she nearly had an accident the week before ; she hoped
neither I nor Uncle J. would ever pull her up.
I have not seen this aunt for fourteen years ; I never hear from
her. She is living in a hut in the New Forest, which is built on
the ground floor. Miss W. ... I have not seen for twenty years.
Now I told D. [Mr. Barnard] about it and he made great fun of a
lift being wanted on a ground floor house. Monday [Feb. 19]
Uncle J. writes: "Your aunt has had built a sky parlor and has a
lift to pull her up and down. Miss W. is now living with her and
can manage the lift, which went quite wrong last week."
The letter from the uncle, Mr. E., was not preserved, but
Mr. Barnard corroborates Mrs. Barnard's statement. In the
communicatiou referred to already, received by us on April 2,
1912, he writes:
L. [Mrs. Barnard] told me of the dream of the lift two days
before Mr. E.'s letter came. I chaffed her about requiring a lift on
a ground floor. Two days afterwards Mr. E 's letter came, which
she showed me M'ith great triumph.
Owing to various circumstances ifc has not been possible to
obtain any iuformation as to whether Mrs. Barnard's impression
in regard to the appearance of the lift was correct.
P. 283. Premonitory Dream.
The following case of an apparently prophetic dream was sent
to us by the percipient, the Hon. J. Connon Middleton.
Mr. Middleton writes on April 17, 1912:
Winchester House,
Old Broad Street, London, E.G.
It may be of some interest to you to learn that on the 23rd
March I booked my passage to New York on the White Star liner
"Titanic." About ten days before she sailed I dreamt that I saw
her floating on the sea, keel upwards, and her passengers and crew
swimming around her.
Although I am not given to dreaming at all, I was rather im-
pressed with this dream, but I disclosed it to no one, as my friends
besides my wife and family knew that I was about to sail on the
"Titanic," and I did not want to cause them any possible uneasiness.
The following night, however, I had the A^ery same dream, and I
must admit that then I was somewhat uncomfortable about it. Still
June, 1912. Cases. 265
I said nothing to any one and liad all my trunks packed, business
affairs arranged, had given up my room at the hotel, and in fact
had completed all my plans to sail on the 10th instant. I merely
awaited the receipt of a cable from some business friends about
certain matters which would require my presence in America. The
cable came a few days before the date of sailing (on the 4th April,
to be exact), but it suggested that I should postpone my sailing for
a few days. I thereupon cancelled my ticket, and then—that is,
more than a week before the sailing of the "Titanic"—I told my
wife and several friends of the vivid dreams I had had on two
consecutive nisihts.
I may mention that, previous to cancelling my passage, I felt
most depressed and even despondent, but ascribed this feeling to
the fact of my having to leave England—home-sickness, in fact !
Parenthetically I may mention that my brother, whom I had not
seen for twenty-five years, was to arrive from the East on the
evening of the 10th, and I would thus have missed seeing him by
a few hours, and, as things have turned out, never [seen] him again.
Beyond a few passing remarks very little was said or thought
about my dreams, and you may imagine the state of my mind (not
to mention my deep gratitude for my personal escape) and that of
my friends when the wireless message of the disaster flashed to this
country. Among the friends to Avlioni I told my dreams days before
the 10th was the inventor of submarine signalling.
I have my ticket, cables, etc., in support of what I have written,
but I do not know whether what I have said is of any interest to
your Society, but if it is, I shall be glad to send you any copies
you may wish or show you the originals.
I may add that crossing the Atlantic is nothing new to me, as I
have crossed it a dozen times during the past few years, and I never
remember having any feeling of uneasiness when about to do so or
during the passage.
The followiug corroborative statements from the friends to
whom Mr. Middleton related his dream have been sent to us :
10.45 a.m., AiJril loth, 1912.
I, William James Feddon, Merchant, in the City of London,
E.G., hereby declare that a fortnight ago a friend of mine Avho was
to be a passenger on board the s.s. "Titanic," advertised to sail
from Southampton on the 10th April, said to me that he was glad
his intended voyage thereon was not to take place, for the reason
that he had on two occasions dreamt that the ship was being
266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.
wrecked. The cause of his not going was owing to the fact that
he had received cable instructions to postpone his saihng, and as a
consequence the ticket taken for the " Titanic " was cancelled.
Wm. Jas. Feddon.
mil April, 1912.
Dear Mr. Middleton,
In reply to your letter of the 19th inst. I beg to say that
I recall that, about ten days previous to the "Titanic" disaster, you
told me at breakfast that you had had a dream for two consecutive
nights of seeing a large vessel bottom up and people swimming
about it. I remember remarking to you that, according to tradition,
if you had the same dream for three nights, the incident must come
to pass. This is all I recall.
Yours A'ery truly,
LuciEN L Blake,
(Consulting Engineer, Submarine Signal Company).
April 23rd, 1912.
Mr. Middleton told me, about April the 5th or 6th, on more than
one occasion, that he had had a most curious dream about the
"Titanic" being wrecked and going down in mid-ocean. He said
he saw most distinctly the ship sinking and on her side, and all the
people in the water struggling. He said it was an awful sight and
had quite unnerved him. I asked him several questions about it
at the time, as I was rather impressed by the way it had got on
his nerves, as he is a strong-minded man, and especially as I did not
believe in dreams myself. I asked him where he was ; and he said
he seemed to be floating in the air just above the wreck, and said he
could see all the people in the water, all around. He said he had
cancelled his ticket. I thought a great deal of what he had told
me, and I told others about it at the time.
Jesse H. Curling.
On May 2, 1912, Mrs. Middleton came to 20 Hanover
Square and saw Miss Newton. Miss Newton's report of the
interview is as follows
:
[Mrs. Middleton] said that her husband told her that on two
consecutive nights he had dreamed of a ship " turned turtle " and
numbers of people struggling in the water, he himself floating above
but not in the water. She asked him not to sail in the " Titanic,"
but he laughed and said how foolish it would seem if he postponed
his business on account of a dream. He telephoned during the
morning that he had received a cable to delay his departure, and
June, 1912. Cases. 267
that consequently he had cancelled his berth on the " Titanic."
Mrs. Middleton describes him as a sensible business man, who has
never attached importance to dreams, premonitions, impressions, etc.
She said, "he never dreams," and, most emphaticallj', that he had
never had a dream of this kind before.
In a letter written on May 1, 1912, Mr. Middleton, referring
to the date at which he related his dream, says
:
I did not tell my wife about [the dream] until I had cancelled
my ticket, which was on the 4th, as I felt sure that had I done so
it would have caused her a great deal of worry, and in fact it was
not my intention to tell her anything about it at all, had I not
received the cable which altered my plans. I am positive of the
fact that on April 4th I told my wife, because that was the day
on which I received the cable. I had previously told my friends,
Feddon, Curling and Blake, and while I cannot recall the exact date
of this, I think it was about four or five days before I had received
the cable from America.
It will be seen that there is some discrepancy in these
statements as to the exact date at which Mr. Middleton
related his dream. In his original letter of April 17, 1912,
he says that he told no one of his dream until after he had
received the cable (April 4), but on May 1 he writes that he
had told three friends of it before that date. The statements
from Mr. Feddon and Mr. Curling imply that Mr. Middleton
had cancelled his passage at the time when he spoke to them
of his dream, and therefore corroborate Mr. Middleton's original
statement ; Mr. Blake's statement leaves this C|uestion open.
There is also a discrepancy between the statements of Mr.
and Mrs. Middleton. Both agree that April 4 was the day
on which Mrs. Middleton heard of the dream, but whereas Mr.
Middleton maintains throughout that he did not mention the
matter to his wife until he had decided to cancel his passage,
Mrs. Middleton says that she heard of the dream on the
morning of April 4 before the cable had been received. All
the witnesses, however, are agreed that they heard of the dream
some time before the wreck of the " Titanic," which, it will
be remembered, happened on the night of April 14-15, 1912,
and the above discrepancies are only worth pointing out as
an instance of the difficulty of getting exact testimony in a
matter of this sort, even in regard to quite recent events.

Mr. Middleton has also submitted to us the cable which
caused him to delay his departure, marked with the date of
receipt, 9.4:0 a.m., April 4, 1912, and his ticket for the
" Titanic."
A SITTING WITH ZENO.
[The following report of a sitting with a Bond Street clairvoyant,
who describes himself as " Professor Carl Zeno, Japanese Psycho-
Telepathist," was given by a member of the Society in a letter
addressed to Sir Oliver Lodge.
—
Ed.]
I had a sitting with Zeno last Thursday. It was a long
sitting, and I had a very good opportunity of detecting the
method by which he ascertains the contents of the folded
papers which are placed on the table by his clients. It is by
substitution. He notes carefully the colour of the paper on
which the question is written and the manner in which it is
folded. He then leaves the room and provides himself with
another piece of paper of a similar colour, and folded in a
manner to resemble that on the table. He then returns to
tlie room with his piece of paper concealed in the palm of one
of his hands. This paper he substitutes for the client's paper.
In your case I have not the slightest doubt that the substitution
took place, as you suspected (after you had placed your paper
on your forehead) when he put it on the table, " quickly taking
it from your forehead to the table."
My main object in visiting Zeno was not to ascertain
whether he possessed supernormal powers, but to find out
whether he resorted to fraud. I, therefore, did not insist on
having the piece of paper constantly in my possession, as this
would have prevented his carrying out his tricks, but followed
his instructions when he told me to place my finger on the
paper, to hold his hand when the paper was in it, etc.
He resorted to two substitutions with me, and only answered
the questions on two of my papers.
In the first case, after I had written two questions on a
piece of paper which he handed to me—which questions I, of
course, took care he should not see, he asked me to fold the
paper, and I placed it on the table in front of me (this paper
I will call No. 1). He then, not having touched the paper,
June, 1912. A Sitting luith Zeno. 269
left the room. I then placed on the table another folded
piece of paper, on which I had written a question before I
went to Zeno. This paper had a slight yellow tinge and its
siirface was of a crinkly nature, but not too noticeable. I
placed this last paper (which I will call jSTo. 2) by the side
of the other paper, about eight inches away from it.
Zeno returned to the room, took his seat, and began writing
on his large pad, making at the same time a series of remarks,
some of a fishing nature and some of a vague, general nature
as to the contents of the two papers which lay on the table.
His guesses were all wrong. He then told me to keep my
mind away irorn what I had written. When he thought my
attention was distracted, he placed his left hand for a second
on paper No. 1, took it up, and left in its place the piece of
paper which had been concealed in his left palm. On his
lifting his hand up, the substituted paper was not in the same
position as paper No. 1 had been, but about two inches nearer
to his wrist. He then took hold, with his left hand, of the
large pad, which he held with its back to me. I was able,
for an instant, just as he was lifting the pad up to this
position, to glance over it, and I saw my piece of paper under
his left thumb and between it and the pad. The pad when
in a vertical position served as a screen, and while he was
pretending to write he opened my paper, read the two ques-
tions, then folded the paper and concealed it in his right hand.
On his lowering the pad, my paper was, of course, no longer
to be seen. He then, with his right hand, gave a push to the
substituted paper on the table, and at this moment he must
have changed it for No. 1, which he had concealed in his
right hand. This was so cleverly done that I confess I did
not actually follow the process. He now knew the nature of
my questions in paper No. 1, and was able to develop them.
My questions were: (1) "Shall I sell my rubber shares?"
(2) "Have I done well in taking a house in Bradford?" Zeno
said, " This is something of a business nature. It has to do
with a liquid. It is rubber. Do not sell the shares. They
will go down, but there will be a rise in value, and you will
not suffer a loss."
I replied, " It is about rubber. Thank you. I will take
'
your advice."
270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.
He then said, " There is a B. Do you connect it with
anything ?
"
I replied, " Yes. It is Bradford."
Zeno then said, " It is something about a house. You will
make a profit." He evidently thought I had bought a house
in Bradford, whereas I have only rented one.
I exclaimed, " Mr. Zeno, you are a wonderful man. When
did you first become aware that you possessed these great
telepathic powers?"
He did not reply to my question, but by the expression of
his face I saw that he was gratified.
He then attacked the question on paper No. 2. He
requested me to put my finger on it, while he also put one of
his fingers on it. He proceeded to make a number of wrong
guesses. He said the question had to do with a business
promoter, of whom I was to beware.
My question was, " How shall I cure my persistent
indigestion ?"i
He asked me to give him an inkling of the contents of the
paper. I replied that it had to do with a person.
After a series of unsuccessful fishing questions on his part,
he left the room. I then verified that the paper had not
been changed.
Zeno re-entered the room, recommenced to talk and to write
on his pad, which lay flat on the table. He placed two of
his right-hand fingers on paper No. 2, and appeared to be en-
deavouring to read its contents clairvoyantly. On his lifting
his hand, I became aware that he had made a substitution.
His right hand remained closed. I also noticed that the folded
piece of paper on the table was not mine. It was of a lighter
colour, white and not slightly ,
yellow, and had not the crinkly
surface. I made no remark.
After a short time Zeno lifted the substituted paper, which
he had placed on the table, with his left hand. He closed his
hand over the paper, and asked me to hold his left hand with
the paper in it in both of my own hands. I followed his
instructions. He made the remark that he felt I was highly
magnetic. I said I had been told that before. He asked
me to take my mind away from the question. I said I
1 1 had written this question on the spur of the moment, not because it
represented my state of liealth.
June, 1912. A Sitting with Zeno. 271
would look at some object in the room and think of it. I
turned my head slightly to tlie right, away from where Zeno
sat, but I did not lose sight of him. I noticed him lower
his right hand, which held my paper, behind the table, so that
I could no longer see his hand. I then heard the crinkly
paper being opened, and saw him bend his eyes down and
read the question on my paper. He kept his eyes down a
considerable time. I was surprised that he failed to take the
precaution of talking to drown the sound of the paper at the
time of its being opened. After this manoeuvre he was, of
course, able to tell me that my question had to do with a
personal matter. He advised me to consult a medical man.
If he did me no good he would himself prescribe some herbal
remedy. The way that he replaced my paper on to the table
was simple enough. He refolded my paper under the table,
hid it in the palm of his right hand, which he brought above
the table. He then with the fingers of his rio-ht hand laid
hold of the paper in his left hand, which he had held rather
high above the table. On briniiinq' his rioht hand down on
to the table he concealed the substituted paper and let my
paper go free from his palm.
I saw Mr. F. before I called on Zeno. He thought
that the trick might have been effected by means of a con-
federate who spied the contents of the papers through a peep-
hole in the little room when Zeno left it and Mr. Y. and
you [Sir Oliver Lodge] (at his request) opened the papers to
refresh your memories of their contents.
I had heard that Zeno used tablets on which the questions
were to be written. It occurred to me that he resorted, possibly,
to the Baldwin trick of having tablets with carbon paper con-
cealed in them which would record the writing.
I took precautions to meet both these eventualities, but found
that neither of them occurred at my sitting.
A PROPOSED HYPNOTIC CLINIC AT LIVEEPOOL.
By C. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D.
LiVEKPOOL has always taken an important part in pioneer work
of all kinds, and so we need not be surprised to learn from
the accompanying circular that the physicians of that city who
272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.
are interested in the medical use of hypnotism are about to
start a clinic or dispensary where the sick will be treated by
hypnotism and where medical students may learn the principles
and practice of psycho-therapeutics.
It is a movement greatly to be commended and fills a want
much felt by patient and practitioner. It begins under the
admirable auspices of the Liverpool branch of the Psycho-
Medical Society, of which Dr. Betts Taplin (of 76 Kodney
Street, Liverpool) is President, and it deserves the support of all
who take an interest in the scientific development of this^ im-
portant branch of medicine. , -. .:.
Tlie growth of modern hypnotism may be said to date from
the establishment on very modest lines of Dr. Liebeault's clinic
at JSTancy in 1806.
The prospectus which is being issued by the Liverpool Psycho-
Medical Society is as follows :
In response to a growing demand for a Psycho-Therapeutic
Clinic where the poorer classes can receive treatment by Hypnotic
suggestion in those cases where it is indicated, the Liverpool branch
cf the Psycho-Medical Society of Great Britain have decided to
issue an appeal to those of tlieir acquaintances and friends who are
interested in the subject, witli a view of ascertaining what amount
of support they can rely upon towards starting and maintaining such
an Institution in Liverpool.
It is estimated that a sum of £100 will cover the first cost of
furnishing, etc., and an annual subscription list of £150 will be
ample for maintaining it.
In the event of sufficient public support being forthcoming, a
Committee will immediately be formed from the Subscribers to act
in conjunction with the Honorary Medical Officers, whom the Liver-
pool Society are prepared to supply.
May we ask for your kind support in the shape of a donation or
subscription, no matter how smalll
Any of the tmdersigned Physicians will be very pleased to receive
your replj^ and to give any further information you may desire.

PEIVATE MEETING FOE MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
The 40th Private Meeting of the Society for Members and
Associates only was held in the Council Chamber at 20
Hanover Square, London, W., on Monday, July 8th, 1912,
at 4 p.m. ; Mr. H. Arthur Smith in the chair.
The Rev. M. A. Bayfield read a paper on " Some Cases
of the Relief of Pain by Non-hypnotic Suggestion," which will
be printed later in the Journal.
An account was also read of a case of sudden cure by self-
suggestion of a long-standing malady, apparently of hysterical
origin. The patient, who had been bedridden for five years,
heard a voice which told her to get up and walk at certain fixed
hours. This case, which will shortly be printed in the Journal,
was compared with one recently published by Dr. Edwin Ash,
in his book. Faith and Svggcstion, in which the patient, who
seemed to be in a dying condition, made an even more sudden
and complete recovery after seeing a vision of an angel who
predicted it. In both these cases the hallucination took a
definitely religious form, which was probably the one best
fitted to appeal to the subliminal self of the patients.
ON THE ALLEGED EXPOSURE OF D. D. HOME
IN FRANCE.
By Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.
The question whether the famous medium D. D. Home was ever
exposed in the fifties or sixties, in the course of his sittings
at the Court of Napoleon III., and even expelled from France
in consequence, though it has, strictly speaking, no bearing on
the question of the genuineness of his " phenomena " in general,
has always seemed to me an interesting one from the historic
point of view. Hitherto it had remained an open question. In
their review of Mme Home's D. D. Home, his life and mission,
Messrs. Myers and Barrett say {H.V.U. Journal, June, 1889, Vol. IV.,
p. 102) that they "have tried in France to get at the fountain-
head of the story but without success " ; and they suggest that
the narrative above referred to may have been " a form of the
report spread in 1858 {Life, p. 106) [and undoubtedly false]
that Home was then in a French prison." If so, they thought
it refuted by the fact that five years later Home presented to
July, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 275
the Empress of the French a copy of one of his works, and
received a letter of thanks from M. Hinard, the Empress's secre-
tary, the original of which Messrs. Barrett and Myers saw—as
they did see most of the documents so profusely reproduced in
D. D. Home, his life and mission, and, presumably, in The gift
of D. D. Hovbc (by the same author).-' In Modern Sjyiritualisiii,
Vol. II., p. 230, foot-note, Mr. Podmore thinks "no testimony
has ever been adduced which even remotely approaches first-
hand for the alleged exposure." It has been asserted to have
taken place sometimes at the Tuileries, sometimes at Biarritz
or Compiegne, the date always remaining utterly vague. Still,
it was an extremely vivacious legend, and used to creep up
again and again from time to time, only to be disproved once
more. As M. Guy de Fontenay wrote lately in the IntermMiairc
des cherchetirs et curieux, Vol. LXIV., No. 1306, col. 454:
" Eeserve faite des personnes qui s'interessent a I'histoire des
phenoinenes dits psychiques. Home n'est guere connu que pour
'
le coup des Tuileries,' ou, durant une seance obscure, le
fameux medium aurait mis son pied nu dans la main de
rimperatrice afin de simuler une poignee de main d'outre-tombe !
Cent fois dementie et jamais prouvee, cette galegeade merite
de survivre au meme titre que toutes les legendes pittoresques,
lesquelles, a force de passer de bouche en bouche, finissent
quoique fausses par devenir plus vraies qu'une verity impopulaire.
Toutefois les gens avertis et serieux n'y ont jamais cru."
Such being tlie case, I was not a little interested when I
saw in the Paris Temps of September 4th, 1911, an article
referring to a very detailed account of Home's exposure printed
in a recently published book by Comte Fleury and M. Louis
Sonolet : La 8ociM6 ehi Second Umpire; 1851-1858. I hastened
to order the book, and found in it some six or seven pages
(179-186) dealing with Home's (then called Huvic) sijour in
Paris "in the winter of 1857-58," and ending as follows:
II y aurait encore nonibre d'histoires a raconter sur Hume et
ses mystifications, qui troublerent tant de gens a I'epoque. Le baron
Morio de I'lsle, prefet du palais, qui le surveillait depuis longtemps,
^ By the way, hardly anything is said in either of these books about the alleged
episode—a circumstance perhaps the more worthy of notice, as much space is
devoted to recounting and ridiculing the many often grotesque and absurd
rumours and racontars circulated about the most celebrated of physical
mediums.

se chargea un soir a Biarritz de dessiller les yeiix de TEmpereur et
de rimperatrice et de montrer a tous que le pretendu surnaturel de
Hume, auquel les apparences pretaient parfois una vraisemblance,
n'etait que de la pure charlatanerie,
Un soir, a Biarritz, Hume proposa a I'Imperatrice d'evoquer I'esprit
de la duchesse d'Albe. La souveraine s'y refusa.
Une des personnes presentes demanda alors a un ami mort de
venir lui serrer la main.
Hume, renverse sur le dossier de son fauteuil, agite de mouve-
ments convulsifs, ne se doutait guere qu'il etait I'objet d'une attention
toute particuliere.
Le baron Morio de I'lsle s'etait place de facjon a suivre les moindres
gestes du medium et, en se baissant pour tacher d'apercevoir sous
la table I'apparition de I'Esprit, il fut saisi de surprise en voyant, a
cote de la place occup6e par Hume, un Soulier vide.
Un Soulier d'homme remarquablement etroit et qui avait dll etre
furtivement abandonne par son proprietaire.
Aussitot il fit un signe au general de Waubert de Genlis et, sans
echanger une parole, il lui designa sous la table cette singuliere
decouverte.
Au moment meme, le prodige s'operait, et la personne interessee
declara qu'elle avait senti sous la table la pression d'une main glacee.
Hume se calma. Ces messieurs, qui ne le perdaient pas de vue, le
virent se redresser et glisser doucement son pied dans la chaussure vide.
Immediatement, M. Morio de I'lsle alia trouver I'Empereur
:
— Sire, lui dit-il, on joue ici une com6die qui a trop longtemps
dure. Qu'on rapporte les lumieres, je vous en supplie, et faites dire
a Hume de se retirer. Je vous expliquerai tout.
L'Empereur acquiesca a ce qui lui 6tait demande. II pretexta que
la soiree s'etait suffisamment prolong^e et on congedia Hume.
Le baron Morio de I'lsle, alors, expliqua la petite scene qu'il avait
surprise. On n'eut pas de peine a comprendre que, grace a une
conformation particuliere, Hume sortait de sa chaussure son pied
gante, sans doute, d'une peau moite, et offrait cette pression peu
sympathique aux plus jolis doigts du monde.
Dans la nuit meme, on lui fit dire que ses ruses etaieut decouvertes
et qu'il eut a quitter immediatement la France, avec I'ordre exprfes
de n'y jamais rentrer.
Le medium etait en proie a une violente attaque de nerfs. Les
Esprits troubles, pretendait-il, se vengeaient sur lui. Mais, des qu'il
eut compris, il se calma et decampa.
II s'embarqua pour I'Amerique et on ne le revit plus.
July, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 277
It seemed to me very desirable to try at once to establish
the truth of so comparatively circumstantial a story, if truth
there were. I therefore wrote to Miss Johnson, who agreed and
suggested that I should communicate on the subject with M.
Sage, an Hon. Associate of the Society, 33, rue de Coulmiers,
Paris.
I complied with this suggestion, and here wish to express
to M. Sage my most cordial and best thanks for the very great
help he has afforded me.
The first thing to do was, of course, to write to the authors
of La Societe du Second Umpire, asking them on what authority
they made so categorical a statement. This I did. Count
Fleury has never replied, but M. Sonolet has sent me the two
following letters
:
56, EuE Notre Dame des Champs,
[no date].
Monsieur,
Vous m'avez demande sur quelles bases mon collaborateur
le comte Fleury at moi nous etions appuyes pour raconter dans
notre ouvrage " La Societe du Second Empire " de quelle facon fut
demasque le medium Hume, un soir qu'il donnait une seance de
spiritisme aux Tuileries [sic].
Les sources dont nous avoiis tire ce recit sent surtout orales.
Mon collaborateur tient le recit de la scene de plusieurs temoins, soit
directement, soit par I'entremise de son pere, le general comte Fleury,
grand-ecuyer et ami de Napoleon III, bote assidu des soirees des
Tuileries. C'est par lui que nous sont venus les noms du Baron
Morio et du general de Genlis, etc.
En outre, nous avons consulte les memoires de Mme Carette et
de Mile de Tascher, qui furent, de par leurs fonctions a la Cour,
familieres des Tuileries.
Veuillez agreer, etc.,
Louis Sonolet.
56, Rue Notre Dame des Champs,
[no date].
Monsieur,
J'ai re(('u de votre part la visite de Monsieur Sage qui s'est
montre fort aimable et avec qui j'ai eu grand plaisir a causer. Je
n'ai fait aucune difficulte pour lui avouer que le comte Fleury et
moi ne pouvions fournir aucune preuve veritablement absolue de
A 2
278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.
la fourberie du medium Hume dans I'afFaire de Biarritz. En effet,
deux seuls temoins ont vu ou cru voir la supercherie : ce sont
M. Morio de I'lsle et le general Waubert de Genlis. Or, tons deux
sont morts et nous ne pouvons plus avoir que des temoignages de
seconde main.
Veuillez agreer, etc.,
Louis Sonolet.
On the other hand, M. Sage vs^ent to see Count Fleury, who
v^^as also unable to give him any precise information, saying
that bis book " vv^as not a work of science, but a work of
vulgarisation"; that he had heard the "exposure" talked
about in his family and in his "milieu"; that his father believed
in it ; and referring M. Sage to memoirs of the time (see
further on). An interview with M. Sonolet was equally barren
of results. M. Sage wrote to me on December 11th, 1911:
M. Sonolet ... a recueilli I'incident qui nous occupe de la
bouche du Comte Fleury, mais il n'a jamais eu le moindre docu-
ment ecrit. II croit meme pouvoir affirmer qu'il n'en existe pas,
d'imprime tout an moins. Et . . . il ajoute :
" Peut-etre existe-t-il
des lettres privees : il faudrait vous adresser aux families." " Mon-
sieur," lui ai-je repondu, " il n'y avait pas de texte ecrit, vous en
avez ciee un et soyez sur que les historiens de I'avenir n'oublieront
pas de s'y referer. Plusieurs journalistes I'ont deja fait. . .
."
M. Sonolet n'a jamais In nuUe part que Home fut revenu en
1864, et il convient que si tel etait le cas, cela infirmerait fort
I'incident de Biarritz.
Count Fleury having in his conversation with M. Sage also
referred him, among other memoirs, to those of Madame
Carette, M. Sage went to see this lady. She said to him she
knew the incident of the exposure very well, had heard it
related by her friends, and had been very intimate with
Madame Morio de I'lsle (apparently the widow of the " Prefect
of the Palace "), who died three years ago. She was, however,
unable to supply details, and advised M. Sage to look through
her memoirs. This he did thoroughly, but found nothing of
interest. He therefore concludes that Mme Carette's memory
is at fault. He also looked through the memoirs of Mile
Tascher de la Pagerie (to which Count Fleury had also
referred him) ; of Count Hilbner, Austrian Ambassador in
July, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 279
Paris from 1851 till 1859; of the Duchesse de Dino ; but
did not find anything about the " demasquage " in any of them.
On the whole, therefore, it appeared that our little enquiry
was taking a turn rather favourable to Home's reputation. It
seemed plain that the two author's of La SocUtd du Second
Emiyirc had made a series of precise and categorical statements
rather on hearsay than on any positive evidence ; and I was
already looking forward to framing my conclusions in some
way such as that in the future the story of Home's alleged
French exposure should be entirely ignored, unless some quite
new and satisfactory testimony were brought forward, when it
turned out that hitherto unknown and contemporaneous refer-
ences to the incident were to be found in some letters of Dr.
Barthez, physician to the Emperor Napoleon III., published in
the Bevuc dc Paris under the title of " La famille Imperiale a
Saint-Cloud et a Biarritz." Here are the passages which
interest us (1912, No. 1, pp. 80-84):
5 se])temhre 1857.
J'ai vu M. Hume, ce fameux medium qui 6voque les esprits. J'etais
tres curieux de le connaitre. Aussitofc que son arrivee a Biarritz a
ete sue, I'Imperatrice I'a envoye chercher et nous a cause de lui. La
croyance entiere qu'elle a en lui, ranimation, la violence avec lesquelles
elle en parle m'ont fait de la peine. La evidemment est I'un des
cotes faibles de cette femme, si remarquable d'ailleurs par ses qualites,
physiques, morales et intellectuelles.
J'ai compi'is de suite le cote dangereux de cette faiblesse et tout
le parti que les ennemis de Leurs Majest6s peuvent tirer de cette
croyance en repandant I'opiuion qu'elles consultent les esprits et les
revenants pour la direction des affaires de I'Empire. Cette crainte
est d'ailleurs celle de bien des personnes de la societe du chateau.
Tout cela m'avait done fort attriste et fort mal dispose au sujet de
M. Hume. Aussi des qu'il entra, me deplut-il souverainement. Son
air simple, timide, demi-gauche me parut cacher un savoir-faire tres
habile. Je voyais entre ses yeux et sa bouche une contradiction
d'expression qui lui donnait uu air de faussete tres desagreable : en
un mot sa figure appelait une paire de claques plutot que de
I'enthousiasme ;
aussi, profitant de quelques paroles de Sa Majeste
sur I'obstacle que la presence d'incredules met a Taction des gens de
I'autre monde, je me suis retire sans rien dire, et n'ai pas assiste a

I'ai bien vu, et bien examine et je suis reste convaincu que son air
demi-simple cache une leelle faussete. Cej^endant cette seconde
impression a ete moins mauvaise que la i^remiere.
Apres diner, on s'est mis en seance, et d'apres quelques paroles
qui m'avaient ete dites, j'ai compris que je devais rester. Je me
suis done mis, avec tous, autour de la table, les mains dessus, et de
suite j'ai senti la table remuer et se tremousser ;
puis on a frappe
sous la table, repoudant a des coups par d'autres coups dictes evi-
demment par une intelligence; on a gratte, grataille a droite et a
gauche, on a tire la robe de Sa Majeste ; on a enleve une sonnette
de la main d'un monsieur qui etait a cote de moi pour la porter
ailleurs ; un accordeon maiuteuu par une seule main de M. Hume
a joue un air ravissant et tres juste ; tout cela se passait sous la
table ;
mais, au bout d'un quart d'heure, tout s'est arrete, I'esprit a
fait entendre qu'il voulait s'expliquer au moyen de coups frappes
sous la table ; il a fait ecrire une phrase qui voulait dire que nous
etions trop nombreux ; il a designe les personnes dont il ne voulait
plus la presence ;
je me suis trouve du nombre, ce qu'expliquait
naturellement I'expression narquoisement inciedule que je sentais
exister sur ma figure ; et je dus m'eu aller. J'ai su ce matin que le
reste de la soiree n'avait rien presente de plus remarquable, sinon
C[u'une table avait saute de ses quatre pieds.
Tu vas me demander ce que je pense de cela. Ces faits je les ai
vus et entendus, ils sont vrais, comnie il est vrai que je sors de
dejeuner ; ils sortent de la regie commune et de ce que je puis juger
par les connaissances physiques que je possede : c'est-a-dire que je ne
peux pas les expliquer. Mais de la a conclure qu'ils sont le produit
d'un sortilege ;
que des esprits, des revenants sortent de leurs tombeaux
))0ur venir faire de telles farces sur une table, tu me permettras de te
dire qu'il y a loin Entre ces faits et I'explication qu'on en donne,
il y a un abime qu'il m'est absolument impossible de franchir quant
a present. Je reste ignorant, completement ignorant de la maniere
dont ces choses se passent. Mais tant qu'il faudra que cela se j^asse
sous une table, a I'abri du regard ; tant qu'on ne me permettra pas de
scruter, de fouiller, d'examiner; tant qu'on s'opposera a ce que
j'emploie, pour me renseigner et pour eviter I'erreur, les moyens
d'investigation c[ue j'ai a ma disposition, tant qu'on me dira que ma
qualite d'incroyant s'oppose aux manifestations d'outre-tombe, je dirai
que j'ai parfaitement le droit de ne pas croire a des esprits et de
soup^onner I'existence de moyens tres naturels, mais qui m'echappent.
En somme, M. Hume me parait etre un tres habile homme, habile

d'esprits, et cela sans calembour, ce ne sont pas les esprits d'outre-
tombe qu'il sait evoquer, ce sont les esprits vivants qu'il sait attirer
et empaumer. Ceci est clair pour moi, et pour d'autres aussi. Mais . . .
mais . . . que ne fait pas la necessite de flatter les gens !
25 septemhre 1857.
Je te dirai pour t'amuser qu'on a fini par saisir I'un des precedes
au moyen desquels M. Hume evoque les esprits. L'lmperatrice en
est reduite a dire que le Hume d'aujourd'hui n'est plus le Hume
d'autrefois, qu'il a perdu son pouvoir, et qu'il cherche a le reraplacer
par des subterfuges. La chose est fort simple. M. Hume a des
souliers fins, faciles a oter et a remettre ; il a aussi, je crois, des bas
coupes qui laissent les doigts libres. Au moment voulu il ote un de
ses souliers, et avec son pied tire une robe par-ci, une robe par-la, fait
tinter une sonnette, cogne d'un cote ou d'un autre, et la chose une
fois faite remet prestement sa chaussure. Cela a ete vu par M. Morio
qui en a fait une belle relation ecrite et signee avec tons les details
necessaires pour etablir I'authenticite de sa decouverte. Hume a vu
qu'on devinait son aff'aire et il faisait, je t'assure, piteusc figure. II est
sorti se disant malade, et, toute la nuit, il a eu des attaques de nerfs
et des visions, a ete entoure d'esprits. Enfin comme on le jugeait
sur le point de mourir, on a ete chercher le pretre et le medecin
(le dit Hume vit ici avec une famille etrangere, qui I'heberge, le soigne,
le mijote. C'est Tartufi'e et M. Orgon; Tartuffe au lieu d'etre un
faux devot est sorcier — Orgon est une polonaise). Le lendemain, la
mort paraissant toujours imminente, on supplie le medecin du chateau
de venir au secours du moribond ; ce qu'il fait en grande hate. Alors
je vois mon homme etendu sur un lit et entoure d'une famille inquiete,
eploree. Lui il a les yeux rouges, la figure gonflee, bouleversee par ci,
calme par la. Enfin cette figure de faussete dont je t'ai parle prece-
demment. II me fait un tas de contes sur ses soufFrances, sur les esprits
qui le tourmentent, etc. Malheureusement il avait le pouls le plus
naturel du monde. Puis il s'est mis k avoir une extase, son ceil a
tourne en Fair, est devenu fixe : evidemment les esprits revenaient
et allaient le tourmenter a nouveau. Alors je le prends par le bras,
je le secoue un pen rude et lui dis a I'oreille : "Aliens, monsieur
Hume, pas de betises, laissez done tons ces esprits tranquilles, vous
savez bien que je n'y crois pas." Alors I'extase a cesse, il m'a regarde
dans le blanc des yeux, il a bien vu que je me moquais un peu de lui
et du coup les esprits se sont envoles. Je me suis retire en affirmant
a la famille desolee qu'il n'y avait aucun danger, qu'il s'agissait d'une

simple attaque nerveuse et qu'il fallait mettre toute inquietude de c6te.
Je n'ai pas manque de rendre compte de ma visite m6dicale, j'ai
meme redige une consultation ecrite que j'ai remise a M. Morio de
rile pour joindre a son recit ecrit. Du coup les seances d'evocation
des esprits ont cesse au chateau et nous esperons que cet indigne
charlatan est demonetise. Cependant Sa Majeste ne peut pas digerer
qu'un homme ait eu le front de se moquer a ce point d'elle et de

M. Sage having sent a letter to Dr. Barthez, c/o the Revue
dc Paris, received the followino-
;
LlAUROU, PAR EXCIDEUIL,
DoRDOGNE, 24 Janvier 1912.
Monsieur,
Je viens de recevoir par la Direction de la Eevue de
Paris, la lettre par vous adressee a mon pere, le Docteur Barthez.
Mais mon pauvre pere est mort en 1891, a I'age de 80 ans, et je
n'ai d'autres documents manuscrits sur le sujet dont vous me
parlez, le d6masquage de M. Home, c|ue les lettres de mon pere,
pubH6es en partie, par la Revue. II en avait ete lui-meme temoin,
a Biarritz, et nous avait souvent reparle de cette histoire. Lui
seul, aurait pu vous donner peut-etre, d'autres details plus circon-
stancies cpie ceux que vous pourrez lire, dans la Revue de Paris.
Regrettant done de ne pouvoir vous satisfaire, je vous prie.
Monsieur, etc.
C. PouQUET nee Barthez.
In a further letter dated January 31st, 1912, Mme Pouquet
suggested to M. Sage to try to see the original MSS. of Dr.
Barthez's correspondence, now in the hands of M. Calmann
Levy, the well-known Paris publisher, saying the Revue had
left out a good deal. M. Sage saw M. Levy, but the latter
declined to show him the MSS.
Letters sent by me to General Morio of 31, rue d'Armaille,
Paris, and to M. H. de Waubert de Genlis, 12, Rond-Point
des Champs Elysees ; also to the Figaro, the Gaulois, and the
Tnterrji^d-iairc des chcrcJieurs et mrieux produced nothing of
interest.
On December 11th, 1911, M. Sage had written to me:
Je ne vois . . . qu'un moyen de tirer I'afFaire au clair, de savoir
non pas si Home a fraude (cela on ne le saura jamais), mais s'il a
ete soupQonne et expulse : c'est d'interroger I'lmperatrice.
July, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 283
And he advised me to apply in this connection to Mr.
Feilding, which I did.
Mr. Feilding having made enquiries, heard from a friend
of his in the Empress's entourage, that Her Majesty had lately
expressed, in conversation on the subject, her firm belief in
the genuineness of Home's performances, and had said that, in
her opinion, the stories of a gloved foot under the table were
false. She related two incidents that had occurred during
Home's sittings
:
(1) In one of the salons of the Tuileries a heavy arm-chair
had begun to jump about by itself in the middle of the room
when no one was near it ;
(2) On another occasion Home raised himself in the air with
the chair he was sitting on, to about the height of a table,
and the Empress sitting next to him touched the feet of the
chair when it was in the air, and consequently felt sure that
there was no trickery.
With this letter I consider the enquiry to have been carried
as far as it can be, and that it must now be regarded as
closed.
Now let us briefly discuss the new evidence before us.
•
I will first give M. Sage's criticisms on Dr. Barthez's letter
:
Paris le 6 feerier 1912.
. . . r. Le Docteur Barthez avoue qu'il etait tres prevenu
contre Home et meme centre tous les phenomenes de cette nature :
cet etat d'ame n'etait guere favorable a I'impartialite.
2°. II ne semble pas avoir assiste a la seance on Home aurait ete
demasque. Nous sommes done ramenes toujours a M. Morio de I'lsle,
lequel aurait ecrit un "tres beau rapport."
3°. Mais Home — Barthez le dit —avait beaucoup d'ennemis
parmi les courtisans, qui craignaient de lui voir prendre une
influence politique par " ses esprits."
4°. Le Dr. Barthez ne fait pas allusion a une expulsion. II donne
a entendre que I'lmperatrice — et peut-etre I'empereur — ne fut pas
si convaincue que cela du demasquage : ce fait expliquerait le retour
de Home en 1863. Mais si Home "s'expulsa" de lui-meme, c'est
que sa conscience n'etait peut-etre pas tres nette.
f)\ II faudrait trouver le "beau rapport" de M. Morio de I'lsle.
Mais oil le prendre, s'il existe encore? La publication des lettres
284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.
du Dr. Barthez fera peut-etre sortir de I'ombre d'aiities documents^
si tant est qu'elles attirent quelque attention.
It certainly seems extremely probable that there was no
expulsion. Here are the reasons for it. Let us note, first,
that the date of September, 1857, assigned to the exposure
by Dr. Barthez, is entirely in accordance with a passage of
Mme Home's Life, where she says (p. 99) that in September,
1857, the French court was at Biarritz, and that an Imperial
invitation telegraphed to Home at Baden-Baden cut short his
stay there. The agreement is even more complete, for a little
further on Mme Home prints a letter signed " Ch. Lavigerie,
priest. Professor of the Faculty of Theology in Paris " (pre-
sumably identical with the future Cardinal and Archbishop of
Algiers), and dated September 24th (1857), whereas Dr.
Barthez, as we have seen, speaks of the exposure and of
Home's real or supposed illness on September 25th. Father
Lavigerie's above-mentioned letter begins as follows
:
Sir—I learn from the vicar of Biarritz that your health is in a
critical condition, and although I have not the honour of being
personally known to you, I nevertheless take the liberty of coming
as priest to offer you the consolations of my office, etc.
From which it undoubtedly follows that Mme Home's
chronology appears to be quite sound in a particularly striking
and interesting instance, and vfe are therefore, so it seems to
me, entitled to give it credit in general. And accordingly we
see that from Biarritz Home went to Bordeaux {Life, p. 100),
then to Paris, then to the Chateau de Eambures, the resi-
dence of the Marquis and Marquise de Fontenelles, then to
Paris again till the end of the year. In January, 1858,
Mme Home says. Home " accepted a royal invitation to the
court of Holland" (p. 101). He then returned to Paris, and
early in 1858 left for Italy (pp. 105, 106).i
1 Meanwhile "Paris and the Paris journals," Mme. Home says, "were lend-
ing ready credence to an infamous falsehood concerning him. He had been
arrested on—the scandal-mongers knew not what charge—and was in the
prison of Mazas. " Baron de Pontalba, one of Home's friends, wrote to him
at Rome to apprise him of this calumny. (The Baron's letter is given in full
on p. 106 of the Life.) Home in the meantime had written from Rome to some
of his friends in Paris, and one of them, M. Henri Delaage, "a well-known
author," showed the letter he had received to the Paris correspondent of Le
Nord, which newspaper contradicted the story of Home's imprisonment, and
thereupon "the spread of the Mazas slander was stopped" (Life, p. 107).
July, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 285
I do not quite see where the expulsion could be located.
In any case, when Messrs. Fleury and Sonolet say (p. 186)
that after the Biarritz exposure Home " s'embarqua pour
I'Amerique et on ne le revit plus," they are completely mis-
taken. Home did not start for America—at least, did not do so
then. But it is interesting to note that Madame Home speaks of
a journey he made to America in March, 1857,—i.e. before the
"exposure"-^ {The gift of D. D. Home, p. 199 and elsewhere)
to bring to France a young sister whom the Empress had
offered to take under her protection and educate at her expense.
This Miss Christine Home, Madame Home says, was placed in
the Sacre Co3ur convent {Life, p. 83). I have tried to verify
the fact independently, but have been unable to do so.
We see further that, whatever the " exposure " may have been.
Home came back to France and had intercourse with the Court
circles and the Imperial couple, and also gave sittings, several times
in the course of later years. In spite of Messrs. Sonolet and
Fleury's assertion that after 1858 " he was seen no more," we find
him in France, not only that very year, in May {Life, p. 109), after
a visit to Eome where he had become engaged (pp. 107-108 )>
but again in the autumn of 1859 (p. 118). In the interval
he had gone to Eussia, where (in St. Petersburg) he had married
Mile Kroll, sister of Count Koucheleff-Besborodko (p. 115).
On that occasion he received a wedding-gift from the Emperor,
Alexander II., to whom he had given seances. Among the
Kussians of distinction whose acquaintance he then made was
the celebrated poet Count Alexis Tolstoy (then A.D.C. to the
Emperor). Their friendship was of long duration and is a well-
known fact. Then we find Home in France again in July,
1860 {Life, p. I7l : at the Chateau de Cergay, near Paris); in
September, 1860, at Biarritz (p. 174); in February, 1862, "in
the South of France" (p. 193), where the first Mrs. Home
died; in 1863 in Paris (p. 199), where, the second Mrs. Home
says, he holds seances at the Tuileries in obedience to a sum-
mons from the Empress. Be this as it may, he sends Her
Majesty in March of the same year a copy of his work,
Incidents in my Life, and receives a letter of thanks—given in
full—from the Empress's secretary (p. 199, see above). In
November, 1863, Home went to Eome only to be expelled a
^ He sailed for America a second time in 1864 [Life, p. 232).
286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.
few weeks later by order of the Papal Government. (Was not
this undoubted fact, which was discussed in the British House
of Commons, the origin of the later rumour as to his expul-
sion from France?) In April, 1864, Mrs. Home says, he was
again in Paris giving seances at the Tuileries (p. 209). Mrs.
Home quotes a letter he then received from ISTubar Pasha, the
famous Egyptian statesman, who was also in Paris at the time.
She says more sittings were given at the Tuileries during
Home's stay of three weeks in Paris in the summer of 1865
(p. 239). (See on same page two letters sent to Home by
Princess Caroline Murat by command of the Empress Eugenie
in July, 1864, and June, 1865 —the latter making mention of
Home's sister—from which it undoubtedly follows that he was
then continuing to enjoy the Imperial favour.) All this tends to
show that the Empress's present favourable opinion is no isolated
fact suddenly springing up into existence after the lapse of
many years, but seems to be, so far as one can judge, in
accordance with Her Majesty's past attitude.
These circumstances undoubtedly show that in any case there
are in the " exposure " story features almost certainly belonging
to the domain of legend ; also that this " exposure " can hardly
have been of an utterly crushing nature.
Still, there was undoubtedly something in it. And much as
I disapprove of the inaccuracies to be found in the narrative
given in La SocUU du Second Empire, and of the slip-shod
way in which its authors have approached a serious subject, I
feel compelled to admit that the general accordance of Messrs.
Fleury and Sonolet's account with that of Dr. Barthez seems
to call for reflection. It does not appear that the latter's
letter (which at any rate was published only several months
after the appearance of the first work) supplied them with the
information about the Biarritz episode. (Note in this connec-
tion the absence of General W. de Genlis's name from the
Barthez account.) The coincidence is therefore the more
remarkable.
Another feature to be borne in mind is that the character
of the trickery attributed to D. D. Home appears to tally so
well with the suspicions which enter one's mind when reading
descriptions of some of his performances. From the days of
my early youth, when I was still something of the enthusiastic
July, 1912. On the alleged Exjwsure of D. D. Home. 287
neophyte, it had always seemed to me that action by Home's
feet was often not a very improbable hypothesis, though, T
admit, ludicrously inadequate as a general explanation. I there-
fore used to look for detailed descriptions of the way in which
Home's lower extremities were controlled, but generally found
nothing.^ Even such observers as Sir William Crookes were,
as a rule, very reticent on this subject. And now we find
that it is precisely his feet which the sceptics incriminate as
far back as 1857, at the very height of his "powers." Surely
a painful coincidence
!
It might also be urged that—as everyday evidence in
general and in the domain of " Modern Spiritualism " in
particular abundantly shows—people will often cling to a
cherished delusion through thick and thin and will refuse to
give it up in the face of overwhelming proof; and that from
this point of view too much importance should not be attached
to persistence in the belief in Home's mediumship—whether
immediately after the Biarritz incident or half a century later.
Apparent contradictions in this respect might also perhaps be
pointed out, tending to show that, in particular cases, as years
' Let tlie reader consider, for instance, the following passage from one of
AksakofFs works (
The Precursorf; of Spiritism [in Russian], p. 485, foot-note) :
" Sometimes at Home's seances (Home's hands being upon the table and a candle
burning) I would hold under the table some object : a pencil, a bell or a
handkerchief and would feel how something began to touch, to take and to
pull it : if I let it go it would not fall down ; I once put my hand under
the table with a ring on one finger in order that it should be taken away, as
I hoped thus to know the operating agency better ; all at once tender but firm
fingers began to work, trying to take off the ring ; in so doing they naturally
and unavoidably touched my hand, and I was fully convinced these were
living, warm, thin, human fingers. " Professor Boutleroff who witnessed similar
incidents mentions, it is true, that Home's feet "were dressed in bottines,
were controlled and did not move"; but M'e are not told whether this "con-
trol" was uninterrupted, what it consisted of and whetlier the " bottines" were
not of such a kind that they could be slipped off' and put on again without
difficulty. In his " Notes of Seances with D. D. Home " (S.P.R. Proc, Vol. VI.,
p. 123) Sir W. Crookes describes a case of "direct writing" also under the
table, which he calls "as striking a manifestation as I have ever seen." In
this case again no mention whatsoever is made of Home's feet—just as in the
passage of Aksakoff's above quoted. All these omissions are very unfortunate.
I am very well aware, of course, that against such passages many others could
be adduced where action of the feet was absolutely out of the question ;
but this is no decisive objection. And an out-and-out sceptic might naturally
retort that " il faut toujours avoir deux cordes [if not more] a son arc."
288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.
rolled by, impressions produced at the moment were obliterated,
and ultimately evaporated and left no trace in later attitudes.
This I am not prepared to dispute.
On the other hand, impartiality compels us to note that
our chief witness on the negative side was undoubtedly strongly
prejudiced against Home, as he himself admits; that such may
have been the case with others ;
that, apart from this, ignorance
concerning the supposed " phenomena," their conditions, and their
character seems to have been universal in France at the time.
Finally, it does not seem certain, in spite of Mme Pouquet's
assertion, " il en avait etc lui-meme temoin," that Dr. Barthez
was present at the decisive seance ; so that our evidence may
be only second-hand on one hand and possibly third-hand on
the other.
I will therefore thus sum up my conclusions
:
(1) The famous legend as to the French exposure of Home
has at last been " hunted down." It resolves itself into a real
incident which happened in the course of Home's sittings at
Biarritz airmt Septemlcr '30th, 1857, and which, there is good
reason to believe, consisted of an attempt at trickery on
Home's part. Contrary to one version of the legend, it had
nothing to do with the person of the Empress.
(2) The sort of trickery used was precisely of a kind sug-
gested to an attentive reader by a certain category of Home's
performances.
(3) The evidence for the alleged exposure, though impressive,,
cannot, however, be considered altogether satisfactory.
(4) Home's connections with his regular clientele all over
Europe and with the French Imperial couple in particular
were not, so far as one can judge, affected
—
at least ^jer-
mancntly—by the incident in question.
(5) There is no foundation for the rumour that Home was
expelled from France in consequence.
On the whole, a fairly good instance, I think, of the partial
truth of the saying: " // ruy a ^?«.s cle fumic sans fev.."

CASE.
L. 1190. Collective Apparition.
We have received the following case from Professor Macneile
Dixon, of Glasgow University, a member of the S.P.E. It is a
case of two patients (men) in a London hospital seeing the matron
in their ward at a time when she was asleep in bed. The
patients have been lost sight of. The accounts we have are
from the nurses to whom they mentioned the experience
immediately after it occurred. These accounts are fully signed,
but we are requested not to print the names.
Nurse C writes :
June 10, 1912.
I am a nurse in a London hospital, and one morning early in
March, 1912—1 do not remember the exact date, but it was at the
beginning of the coal strike—a patient said to me Matron was in
the ward about 1 o'clock this morning. I said I had not seen
her, and the patient said, "No; you were in the next ward at the
time." I then told the nurse in the adjoining ward that Matron had
been in the ward during the night. When the night sister made
her last round she was told that Matron had been in the ward about
1 a.m., but she said she knew that was not the case, for she had
seen her in bed at 12.30. I then told the patient that he was mistaken,
as Matron had not been in the ward, and it must have been some
one else; but he persisted that he had seen her, and described her
dress and cap, and said she had come in at the door and looked at
the fire and gone out again; and he appealed to the other men in
the ward to know if they had seen her, and one man said Yes, he
had been awake, and saw her when she turned to leave the ward.
(Signed) F C .
The night sister referred to writes
:
June 10, 1912.
I am the night sister in a London hospital, and one night the
Matron rang her bell, and asked me to bring her a cup of tea as
she could not sleep. She said the coal strike had given her so
much to think about, and she had been making arrangements all
day and planning how coal could be saved. I brought her the tea
at 12.30 a.m., and she told me next morning that she had fallen
asleep almost immediately afterwards, and I then told her that two
of the patients had seen her in a ward at 1 a.m.

Mrs. Sidgwick paid a visit to the Hospital in order to collect
all the available evidence, and writes as follows :
Jnlij 1, 1912.
I have just been to call on the matron of Hospital, Miss
A , about the supposed apparition of herself to two patients
in a ward of the hospital. What had interested her in the
case was the coincidence of her being seen coming into the ward
and looking at the fire at a time when the necessity of saving coal
seemed to be great, and when therefore the hospital fires were
very much on her mind. But she said the incident had not
struck her as important till she spoke of it to Professor Dixon.
It was, I gathered, at his request that she wrote out the account
of what Nurse C and the night sister told her, and they
signed the accounts. The patients have been entirely lost sight of
and could nut now be traced.
I saw the ward, which is a small one with only nine beds—
a
men's ward. The fireplace is at one end, and the door by which
she was seen to enter is near the other end of one of the side
walls. The beds are ranged with their heads against the wall, as
usual in hospitals, and on both sides of the room. The men who
thought they saw the matron were one on one side of the room and
the other on the other, and their beds were both rather near the
fire. The room is lighted at night by an electric light with a green
glass shade, which is drawn down near the table so that the light
may be shaded from the patients' eyes.
I saw Nurse C . She is very different in appearance from
the matron, but what is more important is that their caps are
extremely different, and it was by the cap that the patient identified
the matron. Her cap is made of a large sc^uare of cambric or other
white material pinned on in folds, so that it hangs like a v eil
behind, a considerable way down the back. The nurse's cap has
nothing hanging down at all ; it is fastened at the back of the
head, where the hair starts from the neck, by a little bow without
any ends. Their dresses are both of a bluish grey colour, but the
nurse's is very much covered by a white apron. I am told that the
night sister's dress is dark navy blue, and looks almost black at
night. No one in the hospital wears a cap in the least like the
matron's. It is diflncult, therefore, to suppose a case of mistaken
identity.
It was when she was washing the patient in the morning that he
told Nurse C that the matron had been in and looked at the
July, 1912. Case. 291
fire in the night. She was not surprised, because they had been
told to be economical of coal, and she supposed the matron might have
been round to see if her instructions had been carried out. It was
only when she learnt from the night sister that the latter had seen
the matron in bed at 12.30 that she realised the patient must have
been mistaken.
I do not think it is possible now to make sure that the second
patient's testimonj- was really independent—given, I mean, before
the men had talked over the matter among themselves.
Miss A is not aware of her phantasm having appeared
to any one on any other occasion. She has herself on more
than one occasion had what seemed to be telepathic or otherwise
supernormal experiences. On the day of her apparition in the
hospital she had been very much occupied with the question of
coal supply and coal saving. In thinking over the whole question,
the small wards, in one of which she appeared, had been the subject
of thought, and she had decided that in any case the fires must be
kept up there ; but she cannot say whether she had thought of
these wards in that connexion on this particular day.

COINCIDENCES IN PSEUDO-SCEIPTS.
By Alice Johnson.
In a paper printed in the Journal for December, 1911, Miss
Verrall gave an account of a series of imitation scripts produced
for experimental purposes by six friends of hers, with a view
to seeing how the coincidences that might occur between them
compared with the cross-correspondences found in genuine scripts.
To this paper was appended a note saying that one of the six
experimenters, the writer C, after reading all the scripts, had
suggested that some of the coincidences detected might possibly
be due, not to chance, but to telepathy from her. Owing to this
idea of C.'s, we asked any readers of the Jowrnal who could
find in the scripts phrases that seemed specially appropriate to
themselves to let us know what these were and in what their
appropriateness consisted. For it was clear that if the scripts
fitted the circumstances of several different persons equally well,
the probability in any one case that this appropriateness was
merely accidental would be greatly increased.
292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.
In view of the great variety of topics and general dis-
cursiveness of the scripts, it seemed not at all unlikely that
many other people could find in them some coincidences with
their own circumstances, and we received several communications
describing such. There was nothing, however, at all remark-
able in any of their coincidences, nor anything to suggest
that they were not due to chance.
It will be remembered that Miss Verrall had found among
her pseudo-scripts five coincidences of topic which seemed to her
worth noting. Only one of our correspondents included any of
these topics in his list of coincidences, but he included two of
them, viz. Hell—not, however, as in the pseudo-scripts, in
conjunction with the idea of Virgilian hexameters—and Moon-
light. He wrote as follows :
I find a few things in the scripts that are more or less in touch
with my circamstances :
— ^ ^
(A 4) Dislike of the barking of dogs.
(A 4, A 5, B 3) Mention of Hell. I have been studying the idea
of Hell.
Maeterlinck.
(C 2) The Eucharist.
(D2) Tuhps.
(D 2, E 4) Effect of moonlight on people.
I have been interested in these superstitions.
In reply to questions, this gentleman wrote
:
I do not think there were any special coincidences of date between
my thoughts and the imitation scripts. My thoughts—those men-
tioned—were quite familiar, and might and did occur any day and
at any time.
There is clearly no evidence for anything beyond chance
here. It is, however, in connection especially with the last
topic. Moonlight, that telepathy was suggested by C. as a possible
factor in producing the coincidence between the pseudo-scripts.
For the convenience of the reader, I give below all the passages
in these in which Moonlight or the Moon is mentioned. The
sentences printed in italics are those which, according to Miss
Verrall's instructions, were chosen by the writer from two pages
opened at random in a familiar book selected by himself, to form
a starting-point for the writing.

Moonlight cold that maketh mad. The moon on the sea-
shore making the sand grey. The sun's track on the sea. . . .
Here, as Miss Verrall pointed out, there is a composite
coincidence : {a) two writers, C. and E., on the same day begin
their scripts with a sentence containing the word " Moonlight ";
{h) E.'s first sentence provides an answer to the question with
which a third writer, D., ends her script on April 13th:
"What does moonlight do to people?" and so aftords a
simulation of design, such as we have claimed for the cross-
correspondences.
It is to be noted that in three out of the five cases where
" Moon " or " Moonlight " is mentioned, the word occurs in the
opening sentence of the script, which, according to the plan just
described, was chosen by the writer from two pages opened at
random in a selected book and used as a starting-place for the
writing. There is thus a large element of chance and a small
element of deliberate choice in the selection of the first sentence
of each pseudo-script. It is in this respect entirely unlike the
succeeding sentences, and, on account of the limitation of pos-
.sibilities, obviously much less likely to be telepathically inspired.
If we consider further the frequency of references to the Moon
in poetry and the great likelihood that, if any one opened
on a page and found the word Moonlight in a sentence, he
294 Jour7ial of Society for Psychical Research. July, 5912.
would choose that sentence on account of the large number of
associations with the word ;
also that the coincidence between
E. and C.'s scripts merely consists in their having chosen
on the same day two different sentences from different poets,
both containing the word " moonlight," it will be clear that
there is no sufficient reason so far for supposing that this
coincidence was produced by anything but chance.
There remains the odd fact that E.'s first sentence affords
an answer to the last sentence of D.'s script three weeks
earlier, as in a cross-correspondence a sentence in one
script may fit into a sentence in another. In the case of
E. and D., however, there is absolutely nothing else to link the
two scripts together besides the appropriateness of the answer
to the question ; there is no coincidence of date and no personal
application is suggested in either of them to the other.
But, as already said, the writer C, on reading the proofs of Miss
Verrall's paper on November l7th, 1911, was struck by what
appeared to her odd coincidences between certain expressions in
the scripts and her occupations and thoughts at the time. C.'s
occupations are chiefiy of a literary kind ; she is a person of
wide reading and possesses, I think, an unusual degree of
sensibility to literary excellences. It chanced that in July,
1911, she had written for her own use a series of rough notes
about subjects in which she had been specially interested
during the preceding three months. She brought me the whole
series of these original notes. C. has been greatly interested
in the work done by the S.P.R. during the last few years, and
in its bearings on philosophy and religion, the question of
personal survival, etc., and these topics were conspicuous in
her notes. Special reference is also made in them to certain
passages of poetry (not quoted in the pseudo-scripts) which
contain references to the moon.
/ No doubt, as C. observed in her notes written in July, 1911,
" references to the moon are common enough in poetry and else-
where " ; but she took special pleasure in these, because she had
chosen to represent the Moon to herself as a symbol of some-
thing else in which she was strongly interested. The reasons
for and the appropriateness of this symbolism were explained
fully in the notes and in her subsequent conversation with
me, but they are so much mixed up with other personal
July, 1912. Coincidences in PsevAo-Scri'pts. 295
matters that it is impossible to state them here.^ I can only
say that the Moon, through these literary associations and the
symbolism that it had pleased her fancy to attach to it, had
undoubtedly been a frequent and conspicuous topic in C.'s
mind during April, May and June, 1911.
Nevertheless, it seems to me very doubtful whether C.'s
literary preoccupations had any telepathic influence on the
scripts ; there is no suggestion in them of any connection with
her ; and the fact of her being one of the six writers is the
sole reason for supposing that she more than any one else
should be telepathically concerned in the matter. On the
whole it seems probable that the correspondence between her
thoughts and the scripts in regard to the topic of the Moon
was only another coincidence, due to chance alone.
She has since then tried experiments in thouglit-transference
with the writer E., but there has been so far no definite evidence
of telepathy between them.
Still, it is perhaps worth noting that in regard to the one
coincidence between the pseudo-scripts which Miss Verrall
—
in ignorance of C.'s circumstances—picked out as most closely
simulating a cross-correspondence, it should turn out that there
is possibly some slight evidence of telepathic agency.
The main distinction, I think, between the coincidences
in these pseudo-scripts and the cross-correspondences between
genuine scripts is that the subjects between which the coin-
cidences occurred had no characteristics whatever to mark them
out from the other subjects between which there was no coin-
cidence. In those cross-correspondences to which we attach
any value, there are always at least two factors of connection.
Further, as a general rule, either there is a definite statement
that a cross-correspondence on a particular topic is to be
looked for, or some special mark or signal is attached to the
topic in one or more scripts, suggesting that it is intended to
form the subject of a cross-correspondence.
Nothing of this kind is to be found in the pseudo-scripts ;
in no single case is it explicitly stated that a certain topic
1 There were also a few other minor details in the scripts corresponding to
trivial events in C.'s life about this time; but these were of so ordinary a
kind that they might have applied equally well to a good many other
people.
296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.
is to be looked for in another script, nor is there in any
instance any suggestion of such a thing. jSTo one who read
the pseudo-scripts could put his finger on a phrase or idea as
the one marked out by internal evidence to coincide with
something in another script. The only topics which we should
expect prima facie to appear in more than one script are
matters of common and general interest at the time which it
would be natural for any one to think of, such as women's
suffrage, to which four out of the six writers refer. None of
the cross-correspondences in genuine scripts can be accounted
for by any such connection with contemporary events.
Apart from this slight preoccupation with public matters,
all the topics in the pseudo-scripts seem to be equally
important and equally prominent. The mind of the writer
dwells on an idea for a longer or shorter time—generally
for a very short time ;
he does not play round it and return
to it and work it up with additional touches as an automatist
so often does. To deal thus with an idea is of course by
itself evidence of nothing more than subliminal activity. But
it is just in relation to ideas marked out in this or in
some other way from an indifferent mass that, as a rule,
cross-correspondences occur.
These facts strongly militate against the probability that the
cross-correspondences may be due to chance alone. Never-
theless it is very important that we should test as far as
possible what can be done by chance, and Miss Verrall is now
engaged on a further series of experiments arranged on some-
what similar lines to her first series, but varied in such a
way that everything but chance in the production of such
coincidences as may occur would seem to be absolutely
excluded.

SOME CASES OF THE EEMOVAL OF PAIN AND
INDUCTION OF SLEEP BY NON - HYPNOTIC
SUGGESTION.
By the Eev. M. A. Bayfield. ^
I HAVE tlie honour to bring before you three cases in which,
to my great surprise, I have been successful, as it would appear,
in banishing pain and inducing natural sleep by mere suggestion
without the use of hypnotism. Indeed, of hypnotism I have
no practical experience whatever, having never attempted or
even witnessed any hypnotic experiment.
The cases are all quite recent, and represent my first efforts
in this direction. After embarking on these cases I made
attempts in three others : of these attempts one was a failure,
and the other two were inconclusive. In two of these last
three cases, however, only a single experiment was made.
(1) The first case is that of a widow of 84, who still has the
use of all her faculties. She may be called Mrs. Bennett.
She is a deeply religious woman, and absolutely sincere and
truthful. As you will see, she is suggestible to an extra-
ordinary degree. I visited her last June year (1911), when
she was beginning to get over an attack of bronchitis, and
found her in bed, very weak and, as she said, unable to sleep
properly. She seemed to be breaking up, and I thought—as
did those about her—that she could not last long ; in fact, a
few days after this I left orders that if there were any change
for the worse I was to be summoned at once at any hour of
the day or night—so serious did her condition seem to be.
While we talked her face was suddenly drawn with pain, and
when I asked her where the pain was, she indicated the right
lumbar region, saying that some pain there was constant, and
that she had several severe spasms each day. It afterwards
appeared that she had some renal trouble, not, however, of a
serious nature. When she told me of the pain T said some-
thing to this effect :
—" Well, we must drive it away. It has
been discovered that your inmost self has extraordinary power
over the body, and can tell the pain to go. We will talk to
this inmost self, and then I think you'll have no pain. Do
you believe me ?
" She is very trustful, and she answered,
^

Oct., 1912. Removal of Pain hy Non-Hypnotic Suggestion. 299
" Yes, I do." I then placed my hand under her back, on the
seat of the pain, and repeated over and over again very solemnly
and with strong concentration of thought and will for perhaps
two minutes, " This pain is to go away, and not come back
for weeks." The phrase was sometimes varied slightly, but the
meaning was always the same. When I stopped she said with
great delight that the pain was quite gone. It was then
3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I said, " Now you are to go to
sleep. Arrange yourself comfortably, and shut your eyes." She
did this, and I repeated for some two minutes, " Go to sleep,
and wake for your tea at 6 o'clock, and sleep well to-night.
Sleep, sleep, sleep." In about half a minute her fingers began to
twitch, and I think she was asleep in about a minute. I then left
her, and told her people downstairs that she was not to be dis-
turbed, and would wake at 6 o'clock. She woke at five minutes
to 6.0, and slept well through most of the night. In about a
fortnight she had recovered from the bronchitis, and though still
weak was downstairs. During this fortnight she was several
times sent to sleep in the daytime by suggestion, and the in-
junction to sleep well at night was repeated at every visit,
i.e. every three or four days. She continued to have good
nights, and the lumbar pain did not return for three weeks.
Soon after she came downstairs, however, she complained of
another pain which (as she said) gave her much discomfort,
and made her feel wretched—a pain which, judging from its
position, was no doubt caused by indigestion. I said, " Oh,
that's a small matter ; we've sent away the first pain, and
we'll send off this one too." I laid my hand on the front
part of her apron-band, and the injunction this time took the
form :
—" This pain is to go, and not come back at all ; and
you are to digest your food properly." In about half a minute
the pain was completely gone, and her relief was evident from
her manner. As a reminder to the subliminal self, she also
now began to wear a tape tied round the waist next the skin.
How long she wore it I do not know, but I do not recall that
she mentioned to me further serious pain from indigestion until
three weeks ago.
About three weeks from the first-mentioned visit the lumbar
pain returned ; as before, she had the same constant dull pain
with occasional spasms. It was banished in the same manner
as at first, but I abstained from mentioning any definite period
300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.
for its exile. She had now perfect confidence in the treat-
ment, and after the success of the previous experiments it
seemed undesirable to risk any failure even in a point of
detail. Moreover, being as much a novice in the matter as
my patient, I had no idea how long the effects of such sugges-
tion might be expected to last. The pain did, in fact, return
at the end of a week, but was again immediately dismissed,
and, I think, told to be gone altogether.
Hitherto I had made no attempt to explain the modus
operandi to the patient, beyond the statement about the inmost
self already mentioned. But I now remembered that an
obstinate ancestor, who would insist on proclaiming what he
believed to be the truth, had been burned at the stake at
Smithfield, and it seemed about time to put matters, so far
as might be, on a scientific basis, lest I myself be burned on
the village green, if only in effigy, as a witch and dabbler in
black arts. This fear, I may say in parenthesis, was not alto-
gether groundless ; for though the patients have blessed me
and the villagers take it all quietly, and are far from imagining
that the Prince of Darkness has any finger in the business,
there are others whose attitude recalls the days of Matthew
Hopkins and Co., and also King Knut's little adventure with
the incoming tide.
However—to get back to my story—I now gave to Mrs.
Bennett such an explanation as she could receive of the sub-
liminal self (avoiding, of course, the word " subliminal "), and
the same explanation was subsequently given to the other two
patients. It was shockingly imperfect, but it appears to have
been adequate. At the same time I impressed upon them that
the beneficial results of such suggestion were as much God's
doing as if He had healed them with His own immediate
touch.
About this time I went away for my holidays. Before
leaving I gave Mrs. Bennett a paper on which were written
these words, " You are to sleep through the night every night,
and you are to feel no pain. Jesus the great Healer knows,
and He will help you." This I told her to read every night
when she went to bed. She not only obeyed the instruction
but improved upon it ; for she made it a habit to go to sleep
with the paper in her hand, and, I believe, does so still. The
last sentence on the paper took strong possession of her, and
Oct., 1912. Removal of Pain hy Non-Hypnotic Suggestion. 301
her frequent subsequent references to it make it certain that
from that time she has been relying on immediate Divine
help no less than on the suggestion treatment. Only three
days ago she told me that when the pain in her back came
she now uttered a prayer, and the pain at once departed
;
and she added, " It is because I have faith." It was necessary
to mention this, because it is a fact in the case, and may seem
to introduce a complication into the operative causes. I must
forbear to discuss the point now, and will only observe that,
to my own mind, the complication is rather apparent than
real.
On my return in the middle of September I found Mrs.
B. extraordinarily well, though hot weather does not suit
her ; she seemed to have taken a new lease of life. She had
slept well, and been free from pain. This happy condition
continued for the rest of the year. She had occasional returns
of the lumbar pain, which suggestion was always able to remove
at once. Indeed, my mere presence seemed to produce some
beneficial physical change ; she said more than once that the
sight of me at the door made her feel stronger and " as light
as a feather." In January she caught a rather bad cold in
the head, which pulled her down a good deal, and my note of
Jan. 20—when I had not seen her for more than a week,
probably having had a cold myself—states that she appeared
much weaker than I had ever known her ; her face was thin
and worn, and the wrinkles were much deeper and very notice-
able. She was lethargic and deeply depressed, and seemed to
be more certainly breaking up than in the previous June. I
think she must have been suffering pain, though there is no
record of it, for my note says that orders were given that she
was to continue always sleeping well and to feel no pain. On
the 22nd—two days after—there was a positively amazing
change. She was looking ten years younger ; her face was
filled out to plumpness, and she was extraordinarily lively and
talkative, and oddly excited at her improved condition, which
dominated all her thoughts. On Jan. 26—four days later
—
she had fallen back to a more normal condition, and had a
new pain near one of the shoulder blades. This was imme-
diately relieved. She was continuing to sleep well.
On Feb. 7—twelve days later (T had, of course, seen her
in the interval, for my practice was to visit her at least twice
302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.
a week)—she was still having good nights and looking well.
At this visit she had a swelling on the upper part of the
abdomen, about the level of the hip on the right side. It
was plainly to be felt through her clothes, and appeared to
be about the size of a duck's egg. She had had it for over
a week, and it was attended by a dull pain—due, as I supposed,
to the renal trouble. I laid my hand on the swelling, and for
about a minute, or a minute and a half, repeated a sentence
to the effect that both pain and swelling were to disappear.
The pain departed at once, and the swelling had disappeared
by mid-day next day, and neither pain nor swelling have
reappeared. I left her after repeating the injunction to sleep
well.
On Feb. 13 she had a cold, but was otherwise well and free
from pain. She said, however, that though warmly clothed she
felt cold in the middle of the back, as though cold water
were trickling over it. I laid my hand on the place, and
said it was to feel warm. In about two minutes she said it
was warm, and that she felt the warmth tingling through to
the front of her body, indicating a spot about the level of
the heart.
Three weeks later, on March 7, she was suffering, and had
been for two or three days, from the original lumbar pain.
It was banished in about two minutes.
The history of the case in the interval between this date
and June 18, during which I saw her at least once a week,
has no special features. Occasional pains in the lumbar region
—never acute—and pains from indigestion were successfully
treated. As is, I suppose, natural, considering her age, her
general strength varied a good deal from time to time.
On June 18 she was lying on the sofa, as she had been
doing for two or three days, and was very weak. The hand-
grip was feeble, and she was dull and listless, and disinclined
to talk. For several days she had been suffering severely from
indigestion, and the stomach was much and quite conspicuously
swollen. She told me she could not make her gown or petti-
coats meet at the waist. There was considerable pain, and
the body was so tender that she could not bear the slightest
pressure. I laid my hand lightly on the waist-band of her
apron, and both pain and swelling were bidden to disappear
;
that same night there was no trace left of either. Six days
Oct., 1912. Removal of Pain by Non-Hyimotic Suggestion. 303
after I found her very well, alert, talkative, and she had
resumed her habit of strolling in and out of her neighbour's
cottage. She looked much better, and the hand-grip was un-
usually strong.
This brings the case up to date, and only one remark need
be added. Since pain is nature's alarm-bell, there must be
cases in which to banish the pain without removing the cause
would possibly be unwise and even dangerous. In this case
the indigestion was banished as well as the pain. With regard
to the renal trouble, I more than once begged her earnestly to
let me summon her doctor, but she persistently refused.
(2) The next case can be told very briefly. It is that of
a widow of 93, whom we will call Mrs. Barton. She is of a
lively, whimsical temperament ; her intelligence is still alert,
and she has full use of all her senses. Towards the end of
January of this year she had a fall and hurt her shoulder,
and naturally was put to bed. When I saw her on Jan. 29
she was very weak, and, considering her age, seemed little
likely to get up again, though, as her doctor tells me, she was
certainly in no immediate danger. There was no definite malady,
but she was—as she put it
—"full of aches and pains all over";
she could not lie comfortably even on her feather bed, and
could not sleep. At night her mind wandered, and she would
wake from her broken slumbers and cry out. A continuance
of this lack of sleep could, of course, only end in one way.
Her daughter, Mrs. C, lived in the adjoining cottage, but
now slept in a second bed in her mother's room. I said
Mrs. Barton was to have no aches and pains, but feel com-
fortable in bed and sleep well through every night. Two days
later I found she had slept well, and was quite comfortable
and had less pain. The change in her condition at night was
so great that her daughter told me she was wondering whether
she need continue to sleep with her mother, and in answer to
repeated questions she assured me that she could not doubt
that this sudden and remarkable improvement—dating, as it
did, from my visit—was due to the suggestion treatment. The
suggestions were repeated at this visit. After this date I
visited her about once a week, repeating the suggestions on
each occasion. The improvement continued steadily, and all
her pains had disappeared a fortnight or so after the first
suggestion, and she took to calling me her doctor. After
304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.
remaining in bed about four months, she is now walking
about and sitting out of doors. She, too, seems to have taken
a new lease of life.
(3) The third case is that of an old man of 85, who has
now passed away, and who was suffering from senile gangrene
in the left foot. It will perhaps be best to begin the account
of it by reading a brief rSsitmS of the case, which has been
kindly furnished to me by Mr. Gurth Eager, who attended him.
It runs as follows :
—
" Resume of Case of Senile Gangrene : William Reed, aet. 85.
Hertford,
Jime, 1912.
Patient first seen early in Jan., 1912, with acutely sj^reading
moist gangrene involving big toe. When seen on Jan. 28 the
gangrene had spread to dorsum and heel. Pain during this period
had been acute, patient crying out and having no sleep, —odour
very offensive. Relief obtained only by fairly large and repeated
doses of Liq. Opii Sed. (opium), sufficient to place him deeply under
its influence. Since Jan. 26 practically no pain, very good nights,
gangrene spreading with uniform rapidity. By March 1, whole foot
involved, but still no pain, patient sitting on bedside and smoking,
with foot resting on the ground. Sleeping very well. Gradually
got weaker, and died on May 12. The pain during whole illness
was very marked, except for the opium, until Jan. 26, after which
date the drug was stopped, the patient complaining of no pain,
except on two occasions, from thence till death. It was undoubtedly
a case where pain was a marked symptom until Mr. Bayfield saw
him for the first time on Jan. 26, when the patient passed into
comparative comfort and remained in that condition to the end.
It is my conscientious opinion that the relief of pain was due to
Mr. Bayfield's influence, which, I should like to point out, was exer-
cised for 10 weeks. From the condition of the patient I do not
consider it possible for the sudden cessation of pain to have been
due to his toxaemic state.
(Signed) Gurth Eager."
I should explain that the last sentence means that the
wound was septic, but the poisoning of the blood, though it was
the cause of the excessive pain (unusual in such cases), was not
so severe as to account for a cessation of it.
Eeed was an intelligent man, of strong character, and before
this illness given to being overbearing and impatient. On Jan.
26 I heard in the morning that he was ill, and went to see
him in the afternoon. Before I got to the cottage no thought

of employing suggestion in so serious a case entered my mind,
but when he told me that he suffered, both in the foot and the
leg as far as the hip, acute pains which drove him to distrac-
tion, and that the doctor had been compelled to give him
opium, I obeyed a sudden impulse to make an experiment. It
seemed such a horrible thing that this poor old man should
have to spend the few months of life that remained to him
with no alternative but either to suffer a long-drawn agony or
be continually stupefied by a drug. I told him I had driven
away Mrs. Bennett's pains, and that if he would believe in the
method—of which I gave him a brief explanation—probably
his pains also would disappear. I then laid my hand on the
shin of the affected leg, and said, he muttering the words after
me, " You are to feel no pain in foot or leg, and you are to
sleep well through every night. The gangrene is to get better
;
it is not to spread." This last order I suspected to be folly
while I uttered it, but was not quite sure. Anyhow, the order
seemed likely to stimulate the old man's interest, and so it was
given. The same day I wrote to Mr. Eager^
—with whom I
was not then acquainted—and asked if I might talk to him about
the case. He kindly called on the 28th, having visited Eeed
and examined his foot that same morning, and we discussed
the matter. Mr. Eager is much interested in hypnotic and
suggestion treatment—though he practises neither—and after
explaining the nature of the disease, which is such that cure
or arrest is impossible, he encouraged me to go on with the
attempt to remove the pain and induce sleep.
On the 29th—the third day after the first experiment—
I
visited Eeed, and learned that he had slept well and had had
no pain since the 26th. The treatment was renewed every two
or three days. On Feb. 7 —twelve days after the first experi-
ment—the leg was still free from pain, and he felt " nothing
to call pain " (as he put it) in the foot. He was also sleeping
well through the night. Up to the 2 6 th his nights had been
very restless, and the change from that date was so marked
that both he and his niece, Mrs. D., a woman of mature years,
who was nursing him, had no hesitation in ascribing it to the
new treatment. He solemnly blessed me for it.
He was at this time in the habit of getting up every day,
so that it was with some surprise that I found him in bed
at noon on Feb. 13. He had slept well till the previous night,
306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.
when he had been very restless, though not from pain. He
had for the last two days suffered an intolerable thirst, and
Mrs. D. was giving him oranges and barley water to assuage
it. The usual orders were repeated, with the addition that
tlie thirst was to disappear. All the orders were obeyed, the
thirst disappearing in a few hours. He felt drowsy at tea-
time, and went to bed and slept well and quietly through the
whole night, with one brief interval of waking. When seen
next day he was much livelier than usual.
A frequent renewal of the suggestions seemed to be neces-
sary in this case. On March 4 (owing partly to absence from
home and partly to a severe cold, which seemed to preclude
cycling a mile in heavy rain) I had not seen him for five days,
when a message reached me saying he was in great pain. I
went immediately, and found he had been very restless on the
two previous nights, suffering much pain both in foot and leg.
He appeared lethargic and weaker. The usual orders were
repeated, with the result (to quote Mrs. D.) that he slept
through the night " like a baby." The poor woman, who was
herself almost worn out with her own need of sleep, expressed
herself as amazed at the suddenness of the change. There was
no return of pain, but the second night after this he slept
only fairly, being troubled by the foot feeling hot. He looked
worn and older, and the face was thinner, sallow, and much
puckered with wrinkles. He was told to go to sleep every
night at 10 o'clock, and the foot was bidden to keep cool. That
night he went to sleep punctually at 10 o'clock, and though some-
what restless, slept satisfactorily ; the foot was without pain, or
even discomfort. On the third day, a Saturday, he was looking
extraordinarily well ; the face was rosy and plump, with all the
new wrinkles smoothed out. He had slept all night from
10.30 on the Thursday, and most of the day on Friday, so
that it was not surprising that he did not sleep through the
Friday night, during which he woke several times and smoked
a pipe. There had been no pain, but some discomfort in the
heel.
It is unnecessary to trouble you with further details. With
the exception of one attack, he continued without pain to the
end, and that attack—like the former one—coincided with
another interval when, being confined to the house with a
severe cold, I had not seen him for about a week. The
Oct., 1912. Removal of Pain by N'on-Hyjmotie Suggestion. 307
suggestions were renewed with success. He gradually became
weaker and weaker, and the pulse—owing, as I understand, to
the increasing potency of the poison in the blood—rose to over
100. Four attempts were made on ditfei'ent days to lower the
pulse by suggestion, but they were unsuccessful. Perhaps they
were bound to be. He was conscious almost to the end, and
could hear and understand me when I prayed, but for the last
week or so his will power seemed too feeble to allow suggestion
to be effective, and no suggestions were made. He passed
away peacefully on May 12, eleven weeks after the first
experiment, having been free from pain all the time, e.xcept
on the two occasions mentioned, when no suggestion had been
made for about a week. This period of tranquil respite he
made use of—effective use, as I believe—to prepare himself for
his passing, which he knew could not be long delayed. A
neighbour tells me that they had reason to believe that the
strange success of the new treatment had counted for much in
the change which came over his character during the illness.
After these experiences, it seems impossible to resist the
conclusion that the operating cause in the banishment of pain
and induction of sleep in each case was, in fact, the simple
non-hypnotic suggestion treatment employed—the suggestions
being followed on several occasions, as you will remember,
either immediately or almost immediately by the appropriate
result. I have no reason to suppose that I have any hypnotic
power whatever, and since that power is in some cases appar-
ently unnecessary for the relief of pain, it would follow that
similar success might be expected to attend the efforts of
almost any one in whom the patient had confidence. Prophets,
as we know, are as a rule without prestige in their own house-
hold, and domestic experiments in the family circle might be
disappointing, but—to say nothing of medical men, who (as
those of them present will testify) are employing the method
in steadily increasing numbers—a wide field is certainly opened
for the parish priest. In the country, at any rate, he would
probably be able to find the time necessary for the frequent
visits which the parish doctor could hardly be expected to
make for such a purpose. And the clergy surely need have
no scruple in regarding such services as part of their work, if
they will only recall how much time and interest was expended
in the healing of bodily disease by their Divine Master.

Note.
Since the foregoing paper was read 1 have induced sleep in
another case—a woman (aged about 45) who was very seriously
ill, and whose recovery was being retarded by sleepless and
restless nights. She was bidden to go to sleep every night at
10.0, and at that hour she would suddenly feel very drowsy
and presently fall into sound sleep. After two suggestions
on successive days she continued to sleep properly without
suggestion.
THE CASE OF EDITH BALLAED.
Of the following case of a sudden cure of functional disorders,
sensational accounts appeared in the newspapers at the time.
We print it here because the psychological factors leading to
the cure wei'e manifested in an unusually definite form, which
probably added to their healing efficacy. The case may be
compared with one recorded by Mr. Fryer in the Journal (Vol.
XII., pp. 184-188) where a somewhat similar hallucination
had a healing effect on the patient.
The following account was received from Mr. Charles Hiogs,
who wrote to us on behalf of the Eev. H. Kilner Woodward,
of Gillingham, Kent
:
Batchelor Farm, Gillingham Green,
Gillingham, Kent, Nov. 10 [1911 J.
I desire to bring to your notice a case which will doubtless be
of interest to you and your Society. The subject, Edith Ballard,
age about twenty-five, of 52 King Edward Road, Gillingham, has
for the last five years been a completely bedridden invalid, suffering
from spinal complaint, asthma and fits. A few days ago she
declares that while she slept she saw a vision, or rather a very
bright light, and heard a voice saying, " Arise and walk." She
was then informed that she should have various manifestations as
a reward for her unflinching faith during her hours of pain. She
was told that during five days she should walk at certain periods,
viz. 6.0, 9.0 a.m. and p.m. This she has done, the last manifes-
tation being at 9.0 p.m. yesterday. She is now to have rest for
five days, after which there are to be further manifestations. The
following [account of the manifestations] may be interesting. About
two minutes before the given time she puts down whatever she
may have in her hands, and prepares herself Her shoulders then
begin to twitch, and later she raises her back from the bed perfectly

stiff to the hips. Her e)'es roll upwards, and she raises her right
hand above her head. In this position she gets out of bed and
walks three times round it. When she has done this, she crosses
her hands on her breast, bows slightlj' and returns to bed. While
she is in this state she is quite unconscious. As soon as she recovers
from these trances she is quite exhausted and her limbs rigid. I
do not know whether the coming manifestations are of the same
or a different order. In any case it would seem to be just such an
event as would claim your attention, and admission to the house is
perfectly easy. In fact the room has been crowded at the various
manifestations, and it is becoming a topic of local talk. The ultimate
result is to be, so she declares, her complete cure.
Charlks Higgs.
The period, of rest mentioned in this letter lasted until
November 15, 1911. On iSTovember 21, 1911, Mr. Higgs
wrote to us to say that the manifestations were again taking
place, and on November 23 Miss Verrall went to Gillingham
to see Edith Ballard and to make further enquiries.
Miss Verrall's report is as follows
:
Nuremher 21, 1911.
On Thursday, Nov. 23, 1911, I went down to Gillingham. I
went to Mr. Woodward's house, and he told me what lie knew of
Edith Ballard. He had had no personal knowledge of her except
during the last ^^ear or two. During that time he had visited her
regularly. Last summer her health had become worse : so much so
that he had hardly expected to find her alive after his summer
holiday. She hardly ever spoke, and lay in bed quite still and
rigid.
About 3 o'clock in the afternoon I went with Mr. Woodward
to Mrs. Ballard's house.
Edith Ballard read out to me the following statement (supple-
mented by answers to a few questions I put) ; the statement had
been written by herself.
On Thursday night (Nov. 2, 1911), she said, she saw a light
and heard a voice. (I could not make out clearly from her account
whether she was asleep or awake at the time. She spoke of being
asleep, but objected to the word '
dream ' in connection with her
experience.) The voice said: "To-morrow is Friday, and you will
pass through a fire, and when you have lain here five years you will
arise from this bed, for your time is not yet."
On Friday (Nov. 3, 1911) she lay 'in a fit' for twenty hours.
On Sunday, Nov. 5, 1911, she was awakened at about 5.45 by a voice
which said to her :
" Edie, you have borne your sufferings with
great patience ; and through the temptations and weariness which
you have passed you have kept faitli. Now I want you at the
sixth hour to walk round this bed three times, also at the ninth
310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.
hour in the morning, and the same at night, and I will guide you
with my eye. Do this for five days, and one day will count for
one year, and when the five days are passed those will be the five
years that you have lain here. The day after you will pass
through another fire, and you will be healed, for your time is
not yet."
A few minutes after this, at 6 o'clock, she saw a bright
light like a moon above her head. The light spread and came
downwards until it reached the ground on either side of her. She
then felt as though she were lifted out of the bed and her hand
were drawn up above her head and clasped by another hand. After
that she was not conscious of anything more until she found herself
again on the bed.
Mrs. Ballard told me that she was in the room on Sunday
morning at 6 o'clock, and was astonished and terrified to see
her daughter get suddenly out of bed and walk. She thought that
" her time was come," and followed her round the bed, ready to
catch her if she dropped. The girl walked round the bed three
times and then got into bed again. She took no notice of her
mother whilst she was walking. After returning to bed, she told
her of the 'vision.'
In accordance with what the voice had told her, Edith Ballard
walked at the appointed hours for five days (Sunday, Nov. 5 to
Thursday, Nov. 9). After the last manifestation (9 p.m. on Thurs-
day) she received an intimation (again by a voice, as I understood)
that she should walk once more, because there were several people
outside who had not been able to see her. The people were brought
in, and she walked again.
On Friday morning, Nov. 10, she also walked twice; after the
second time she went into a fit which lasted nine hours. During
Friday night she heard the voice again, telling her to remain in
bed for a few days and then to walk for fifteen days more. She
began walking again on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 1911 ; the fifteen
days will be up on Nov. 29, 1911. After that she says that she
has been told she will be able to walk whenever she pleases. She
declares that now she can only walk at the stated times. I noticed
during my interview with her that she several times moved her
legs under the bedclothes.
At a few minutes before 6 p.m. I went to the house again. We
were shown into Edith Ballard's room, in which a considerable
number of people were assembled. At 6 o'clock she folded her
hands across her breast and raised her eyes as though looking at
something above her and to her left. She then raised herself up
in bed. I was struck by the complete absence of effort with which
she appeared to do this. She was rigid from the waist upwards,
and her arms being folded, she could not use tbem in any way.
Her legs remained stretched straight out. When she had got into
a sitting position, she pulled her legs up out of the bedclothes and
stood by the side of the bed, then she raised her right hand above
her head as though holding something ; her left hand was pressed
against her left hip. She walked round the foot of the bed and
Oct., 1912. The Case of Edith Ballard. 311
back again three times. The space between the bed and the people
standing round was verj' narrow, but she never hesitated or struck
against anything, although her eyes were all the time turned
upwards and, so far as I could see, Cjuite fixad. When she reached
the side of the bed after the third perambulation she dropped her
right arm along her side and her head drooped forward. She then
lay down on the bed, stretched straight out, and crossed her hands
on her breast again. Her mother drew up the bedclothes over her.
She then blinked her eyes and returned to a normal condition. I
had no opportunity of testing her own statement that she was
unconscious during the walking.
H. DE G. Verrall.
In the following March we were able to obtain a report
of the case from a medical point of view by the doctor who
has attended Edith Ballard for the last three years. At his
own request his name, which was given to us, is withheld.
He wrote :
March Utli, 1912.
This case, which has aroused considerable interest lately, has
been under my care for a little over three years ; I now have much
pleasure in giving a short account of her life histor}', and also my
opinion as to the nature of her ailment, and its progress up to the
present time.
Miss Ballard was born 24 years ago last August 1st, and during
her infancy was, her mother informs me, subject to fits. Her
mother describes them as not convulsions, but very slight fits, which
only lasted for a brief period of time ; she has always suffered from
torticollis, the right sterno-mastoid muscle being very rigid and
contracted. As a child she was never strong, always weakly and
delicate, and never able to attend school regularly, being continuallj',
her mother informs me, having to be excused from attendance
by her medical adviser. At about the age of 17 years she developed
severe pain in the side ; she describes it as very severe, and in
the ovarian (right) region ; she then developed what was considered
to be pleuris)^ and symptoms of pulmonar}' tuberculosis. For this
she lived out of doors as much as possible, until, about the age of
19 years, severe vomiting and obstinate constipation set in which
compelled her to take to her bed. This weakened her to such a
considerable extent that she was unable to get up, and it was after
remaining in bed for about two years, when she would be about
21 years old, that they applied to the parish for relief, and I was
called in to treat her, and have been in attendance ever since.
Her condition, when I first saw her, was one of extreme debility,
intense ansemia, great wasting, and practically no use in her lower
limbs. This went on getting v/orse and worse in spite of all treat-
ment, and when she was about 22, or a little over two years ago,
severe convulsive seizures set in, accompanied at times with violent
312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.
tremors. These would last sometimes for hours together, and were
very painful to witness, the body and limbs being twisted in all
sorts of curious positions. Her lower limbs would become very rigid,
and her mother had to pad the insides of her knees to prevent the
skin being rubbed off; the slightest touch of her hand, even feeling
her pulse, would at times set up these violent tremblings ; the
constipation and flatulent dyspepsia were also still great troubles
with her.
This state of things existed up to the time when, a few months
ago, she stated that she heard a voice telling her she was to get
up and walk at the sixth and ninth hour, morning and evening ;
this she carried out to the letter, walking round the bed and then
getting back again, and relapsing in the intervals to her former
condition. This was to go on for five days. At the end of this
time the voice told her she would go through a fire (probably a
fit, which she had), then she had to rest a few days longer, and
would then be cured, for the voice said her time was not yet.
During these walking turns she stated that a light seemed to encircle
her and a soft hand lifted her up and guided her round the room,
which hand she says she knows was Jesus's hand. These periods,
when she temporarily regained the use of her limbs, only took
place when the hand of the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to six
and nine. (I suggested removing the clock, but this they would
not hear of.) It was a loudly ticking clock.
This all happened, I think it would be the end of last November,
and since then she has been gradually improving. I saw her
yesterday and she was greatly improved in appearance. She has
walked a mile or more at a time, and although quite unable to do
heavy laborious work, is well able to do light work. She is picking
up flesh, colour returning to her cheeks, and much brighter, the
only thing that troubles her now being constipation and accompany-
ing flatulent dyspepsia. I may say both her mother and herself are
of an intensely religious temperament.
To sum up my opinion of the case, I should say undoubtedly it
is one of functional or hysterical paralysis, cured by auto-suggestion
or self-hypnotism. The voices and visions I look upon as halluci-
nations conjured up in her own antemic brain. I may add, nothing
would induce the mother or daughter to allow any psychic influence
to be used, as they thought that that would be distinctly interfering
with the Divine manifestations, and I had to use considerable per-
suasion before they would consent for Dr. Forbes Winslow to see
her, who veiy kindlj' came down and saw her with me. The
original pain in the side, vomiting, etc., I look upon as probably
all being hysterical in their nature. The case is certainly of very
great interest from a psychological point of view. I have never been
able to detect any phthisis.
This case presents many points of comparison with that of
Dorothy Kerin, recorded in Dr. Edwin Ash's recent book. Faith
and Suggestion, a review which will appear in the forthcoming
Medical Part of Proceedings.

PJCHAKD HODGSON MEMOEIAL AT HARVARD
UNIVERSITY.
It gives us great satisfaction and pleasure to be able to
announce to members of the Society the foundation of a
Memorial to Richard Hodgson at Harvard University. The
letter printed below explains the circumstances of the case, and
we have since learnt that the gift of the fund has been formally
accepted by a vote of the President and Fellows of Harvard
College at a meeting held in August, 1912.
This is the first time in our history that the work of the
Society can be said to have been formally recognised by a
University of the first rank, and the Council have determined
to mark their sense of the occasion by a donation of five
hundred dollars to the Fund.
Any further contributions, from members of the Society or
others, will be gladly received, and should be sent to
Henry James, Esq., Jr.,
84 State Street,
Boston, Mass., U.S.A.
84 State St., Boston. June 19, 1912.
To the President and Fellows of Harvard College,
50 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts.
Gentlemen,
On behalf of the contributors, whose names and addresses
and individual gifts are listed below, I transmit checks amounting to
$10,000.00, which total sum they hereby give to the President and
Fellows of Harvard College in their corporate capacity, and their
successors in that capacity, to be held for the purposes herein
stated.
The contributors desire that this gift shall commemorate the
hfe and work of Richard Hodgson, M.A., LL.D. (Melbourne),
M.A. (Cambridge), who was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1855,
and who served as Secretary of the American Society for Psychical
Research and of the American Branch of the English Society for
Psychical Research successively from 1887 until his death in Boston
in 1905, devoting throughout those years a generous character and
rare abilities to the investigation and study of i^henomena which
purported to furnish evidence of human immortality. They realise
Nov., 1912. Richard Hodgson Memorial. 317
that enquiries of the kind with which Eichard Hodgson's work in
psychical research especially identified him may from time to time
be most profitably pursued in ways not now predictable, and they
desire to establish a fund for the encouragement of such work that
may be broadly administered and that shall thus become a fitting
and permanent tribute to his memory.
Accordingly the contributors direct that the fund shall be known
as the Richard Hodgson Memorial Fund, and that, subject onlj' to
the provisions for permitting accumulations hereinafter named, the
income shall be expended in the sole discretion of the President
and Fellows in any manner designed to encourage the investigation
and study of mental or phj^sical phenomena, the origin or expression
of which appears to be independent of the ordinary sensory channels.
The contributors further direct that one third, but not more, of
the annual income of the fund and of all additions thereto, may
from time to time be added to the principal in the discretion of
the President and Fellows. Nothing herein shall be construed to
require the expenditure of income annually.
It is the hope of the contributors, this statement of which shall
not limit or restrict the discretion of the President and Fellows,
that a preference will be given in the expenditure of income to the
endowment of investigation and research as distinguished from
lectureships, and that, unless and until the fund reaches such pro-
portions that its income is sufficient to justify the permanent appoint-
ment of an instructor or investigator, the income will be accumulated
for such reasonable periods as shall be necessary to make possible
its expenditure in amounts adequate for important uses.
The contributors, for whom I thus transmit the amount above-
named, are the following :

I.
Dk. Maxwell and " Panopticon."
I CANNOT help thinking that in considering the '
panopticon
and volatile ferrum ' case of Mrs. Verrall ^ Dr. Maxwell has
departed from his own strict form of scientific reasoning.
When we consider the evidence, it is a matter of sheer
indifference what '
panopticon ' and '
volatile ferrum ' mean.
They are mere signs. The real point is that, before Mrs.
Verrall knew of any attempt being made in America at
communication, .she, by certain signs given her through automatic
writing, assumed she had received a message which meant
that " the seeing of a sphere effected a mysterious '
co-reception '
"
and that she " associated this statement with a spear." There
is direct evidence that this was in her mind : there is written
record.
In America what was attempted to be communicated was
evidently confusion between spear and sphere. The relation,
evidentially, between the message received as interpreted by Mrs.
Verrall and the message despatched is apparent. There was
confusion between spear and sphere in the message despatched
;
1 Proceedings, Part LXV. , p. 59.
Nov., 1912. Notes on " Proceedings," Part LXV. 319
there was a '
co-reception ' of spear and sphere in the message
received.
There was coincidence. Was it undesigned ? (Cf. Personcdity
and Telepcdhy, p. 204, where I consider the coincidence as,
humanly, necessarily undesigned.) The coincidence may have
resulted from chance. But, if Dr. Maxwell so thinks, can he
give any like extraordinary undesigned coincidence ? The
coincidence is triple : spear, sphere and the confusion between
the two, spear and sphere.
The case proves nothing, is not offered as proving anything
:
the strongest '
psychical ' case cannot be offered as proof It
can only be offered as strong evidence towards proof.
The case in question is of value only in offering strong
evidence. The improbability of '
chance ' coincidence appears,
to some of us, so strong that the probability of some abnormal
means of communication is opened.
II.
An Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question.-^
Certain difficulties rise in my mind in reading Mr. Piddington's
paper, and as these difliculties may probably have troubled
others I will state, as succinctly as possible, what they are.
I detail, first, the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Piddington
from the scripts in question.
Scripts 136, 171 and 178 {op. cit. p. 186). Mr. Piddington
finds a connecting link in these scripts in the word '
Gleam.'
Scripts 171, 176 and 178 {op. cit. p. 187). Mr. Piddington
finds that these scripts are also connected together, the link
in this case being made by means of common allusions in all
three to the description of the Heavenly Jerusalem in the
21st chapter of The Eevdation of St. Jolun the Divine.
Scripts 176, 178 and 180 {op. eit. p. 189). Mr. Piddington
finds a connexion between these scripts and a poem of Myers's
entitled Venice.
Mr. Piddington then finds '
The object of the reference to
Venice and the meaning of that Poem.' He finds what he
hopes '
will seem to be not only a plausible but a convincing
answer.'
'^Proceedings, Part LXV., pp. 174 et seq.
320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.
This answer is that the suite of scripts in question refers
to the Horace Ode.
Mr. Pidclington considers,—by an evolutionary process,
—
four links between these scripts: (1) G-leani, (2) The Eevelation
of St. John, (3) The Poem Venice, (4) The Horace Ode.
Now I think I am correct in stating that by this process
he assumes to find evidence that Myers disembodied has been
attempting to give us evidence of his continuing personality.
My difficulty, then, is this : The links exist because they
have been created by Myers himself: this applies to each
individual link. It is Myers himself who has chosen the
form of these links.
What is the form of these links ?
Eecondite symbolisms and disconnected signs which are
incomprehensible to the vast majority of human beings and
the very existence of which would have remained unknown
but for the chance existence of a man of Mr. Piddington's
herculean powers of labour and almost diabolical nimbleness
of wit.
It appears to me that, when all the circumstances of the
case are fully considered, these links might, perhaps, be
explainable by '
chance coincidence.' But let us admit they
owe their existence to Myers. What follows ? They owe
their existence to Myers as a continuing intclleetucd ^personality:
they result from intellectual operation. Is it not strange,
then, that a disembodied intellectual personality, full of desire
to prove to us in the flesh that his personality still exists,
should deliberately choose so extraordinary a method of proof ?
For this method of proof—unless we accept Mr. Piddiugton
as a Dcm ex Machind—appeals to humanity in general in no
way. Those who have read, marked, learned and inwardly
digested Mr. Piddington's proof might possibly be counted on
one's iingers and toes. If the proof be accepted it is good
and useful only for a very, very small number of human
beings. The lyrofamim vulgiis will never accept proof of life
after death on the intellectual deductions of a few.
I make no attack on the study of cross-correspondences.
But there is danger of too close refinement : Dr. Maxwell is
laughing at us already. Eecondite symbolisms and far-fetched
likenesses between '
signs ' must be guarded against.
Nov., 1912. An Experiment in Interpretation. 321
One point more : suppose there were three Piddingtons, not
merely one, in the field ? And suppose Piddington II. set
out to tind evidence in the script that '
chance coincidences
'
account for all the apparently abnormal links, while Piddington
III. set out to prove that telepathic communion between
the '
subliniinals ' of the agents explains all? Could they
not make out strong cases ? Mr. Piddington has confined his
attention to the unearthing of evidence in support of Myers's
intervention. Is it astonishing, when all the surroundins,'
circumstances are considered, that he finds some evidence ?
His own summing up of the case {op. cit. p. 210) is perhaps
not very conclusive.
I AN EXPERIMENT IN INTERPEETATION.
I
i
By Alice Johnson.
I A NUMBER of important and interesting questions are raised
in Mr. Constable's comments on the " Horace Ode " case,—too
important and too numerous to be dealt with immediately in
the Journal, but which I hope may be discussed later. Mean-
while it may be worth giving here an account of a specific
experiment made with a view to testing the validity of Mr.
Piddington's methods of interpretation of the scripts.
In February, 1911, Mr. Bayfield, who has made a very
thorough study of all the published reports on Cross-corre-
spondences, sent me a copy of three imitation scripts, containing
an imitation Cross-correspondence, composed by himself after
the style of the real scripts
—
i.e. with many quotations derived
from all sorts of sources, and apparently vague and allusive
remarks susceptible of various interpretations. The subject of
the Cross-correspondence was Browning's Pied Piper of Hamiclin.
These sham scripts afterwards appeared in a review by Mr.
Bayfield of Mr. Podmore's last book, in ProccccUngs (Vol. XXV.,
pp. 85-87).
Just before this, Mr. Andrew Lang had uttered some rather
severe criticisms of our reports—in particular of Mr. Pidding-
ton's—to the general effect that by such methods of interpre-
tation any phrase might be taken to mean anything we liked.
Now there is always this difficulty in regard to the real
scripts, that—from the nature of the case—we cannot ask their
322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.
ostensible authors whether the interpretation we have put on
them is correct. So, when I got Mr. Bayiield's sliam scripts,
it occurred to me that here was an unusually good opportunity
of testing Mr. Piddington's methods,—since we slrould be able
to say for certain whether they had or had not led him to
the right conclusions in this particular case.
I therefore made copies of the three sham scripts, adding to
each the name of an automatist, as if they had really been
produced by her, and sent them to Mr. Piddington, saying
:
" I consider this rather an interesting cross-correspondence.
See if you can find the references to X. in it ;
they are not
very obvious. Ask Mr. Balfour if you can't find them, and
tell me your results without mentioning them to any one else."
It must be explained that " X." was a topic,—which I do
not specify, because it has not yet been published,—in which
Mr. Piddington and I were very much interested at that time,
having found, as we thought, a good many references to it in
the scripts of several different automatists. It was a topic
which had gone on for a considerable time and had many
different subdivisions and ramifications ; the supposed refer-
ences to it included passages from classical, medieval and modern
authors, and allusions to works of art, and to history and
geography ; in fact, the associations with different items of the
topic were so numerous and varied that one might have
supposed that almost anything could be interpreted as an
allusion to it.
I knew for certain that Mr. Bayfield could not have in-
tended to introduce any allusion to the topic X. in his three
scripts, because he was entirely ignorant of it. Therefore, if
Mr. Piddington had found any allusion to it, this would show
that there was sonrething wrong about his methods—if, that is,
they had led to a conclusion which could be proved to be
incorrect. But in order to test his methods as severely as
possible, it was necessary that he should suppose the allusions
were there, so that he might make a serious effort to find
them.
He was completely taken in by my letter ; it never occuiTed
to him that the scripts were not written by the automatists
whose names I had attached to them, and he worked hard to
find the allusions to X. in them.
Nov., 1912. An Experiment in Interpretation. 323
After a few days he wrote to say that perhaps he might
find them if he knew the sources and context of all the quota-
tions in the scripts ; so I sent him elaborate information on
these points.
He then noted two coincidences :
(«) One of the sham scripts had the phrase
:
"His eyes were green as leeks,"
whereas a real script of Miss Verrall's containing
allusions to the topic X had ^
" Tiger tv'er burnino' britrht
Green eyes in the darkness."
(h) The initials of a person associated with one of the poems
quoted more than once in the sham scripts were the
same as two of the initials of a person historically
connected with the X topic.
But he thought it would be absurd to attach any importance
to coincidences so slight as these, and he found nothing that
in his view could be counted as allusions to X.
I wrote to him :
" Try once more and tell me your final
conclusion, and I will then tell you my own view."
He struggled on, feeling—as he afterwards told me—a good
deal annoyed at the idea that my ingenuity in discovering the
allusions to X. had so far exceeded his own ; but he found
nothing more.
After he had worked at it for 13 days, I told him the
whole story, and my reasons for making the experiment.
I wish to add a few words on the ethics of this experi-
ment. I should think it quite unjustifiable to try such a
test with any one but a friend and fellow investigator, and one
who was not an automatist. In this case I was actually as
much concerned as Mr. Piddington himself, for we had worked
together on the same general lines and used the same general
methods of interpretation. I applied the test to him because
—
knowing the facts—I could not apply it to myself. But if
he had failed under it,—if, that is, he had found allusions to X.
where they did not exist,—it would have been a severe blow
to me as well as to him ; it would very seriously have shaken
my confidence in a great part of our results. Nevertheless,
it seemed to me worth while to run the risk.
324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.
The fact that Mr. Piddington did not find allusions to X. in
a place where there were none is not, of course, by itself
positive proof that in other places where he had found them
they did actually exist. But the experiment, as far as it goes,
does, I think, tend strongly to show that our methods are
right ;
not, that is, that they are always and in every particular
right, but that our general principles of interpretation of the
scripts are in the main sound.
CASE. ' •
P. 284. Impression.
The following case was sent to us by Mr. H. Arthur Smith, who
is well acquainted with the ladies concerned
:
Miss Howard writes :
DOBROYD, WeSTGATE AvENUE,
Bolton, Aiujust ifh [1912].
On the 29th of April of this year I visited a Mr. Gr., in the
hope of getting into communication with an aunt who had died
four years ago.
The sitting was a private one, and took place in the afternoon.
Mr. G. described a spirit whom he perceived to be present, and
seemed anxious to establish its identity with my aunt. He asked
several questions, which I answered ; and he described her appear-
ance, and gave details of her last illness, generally quite correctly.
He then asked if I would like to hear her speak, and said quite
suddenly, without leading up to any such remark: "She (meaning
my aunt) says, '
Oh, poor Lillie, but never mind, she'll soon get
over it.' " He asked me who " Lillie " was, and if she was ill.
" Lillie " is another aunt, who was at that time on her way from
South Africa to England, and from whom we had not heard for
some weeks. I knew she was due to arrive in England in ten
days' time, but no thought of her had been in my mind for some
days previous to this interview.
This remark about "poor Lillie" had no meaning whatever to
me, until a fortnight later, when my Aunt Lillie landed in England,
and I learned that on the 8tli of May, te)i days after my consulta-
tion with Mr. G., she had had a fall on deck, which had shaken
and bruised her severely, but from which she recovered with re-
markable rapidity.
Marian Howard.
Nov., 1912. Case. 325
Miss Howard's sister writes
:
DoBROYD, Bolton, August Uh, 1912.
Ill a letter from my sister written on May 2nd, she recounted tu
me her experiences at her interview with Mr. G. on May 1st. I
could make nothing of the remark about "poor Lillie " at the time,
but when I met my aunt at Southampton on the 10th, I was not
surprised to see the marks of bruises on her cheek and forehead,
which were the results of her accident.
Alice Howard.
The lady who met with the accident writes :
Amblesidk, August 5fh, 1912.
On May 8tli of this year, on my voyage from Africa, I had a
bad fall on the deck of the " Braemar Castle," then on her way
from Madeira to Southampton. I had had no communication with
any one in England for some weeks previously, and no one in
England knew of my accident until I landed there on May 10th.
I recovered from the eflects of my fall with remarkable quickness,
and have suffered no permanent bad results.
Lillie Egwe.
On its being pointed out to Miss Alice Howard that her
account differed from her sister's as to the date of the inter-
view with Mr. G., she wrote on August 9th, 1912 :
I made a mistake in saying that my sister's interview with Mr.
G. took place on May 1st ; it was on the afternoon of Monday,
April 29th.
We enquired whether the original letter describing the inter-
view had been preserved, but they were not able to find it.
In answer to other questions, Miss Marian Howard wrote :
A^igust 22?wZ, 1912.
In relation to my interview with Mr. G., I can truly say that I
had not had Aunt Lillie in my mind at all that afternoon. She had
never been mentioned, and of course no questions had been asked
about her. At the moment when Mr. G. said the words "Poor
Lillie," etc., he really appeared to be in a trance, and purported to
be seeing my (late) aunt. Miss Jane Rowe. After saying, ''She
(Miss Eowe) says, 'Poor Lillie,'" he turned to me and said, "Is
Lillie ill 1
" I merely said " No, she is not," and did not say she
was on the sea. It at once came to my mind that something had

happened to her on the boat, and I thought, " Now I shall wait
and see what this means." I quite saw all through the interview
that I could easily help Mr. G. by any reaiark I might make or in
an answer to a question, so I tried my best not to do so. I was
fully aware that I might be taken in. . . .
Marian Howard.
THE CASE OF EDITH BALLAED.
To complete the account of this case, which appeared in
the Journal for Oct. 1912, p. 308, we print the following letter,
addressed to Miss Verrall, from the doctor whose report was
there given :
Oct. im, 1912.
In reply to your card of the 9th inst. I have recently been
attending Miss Ballard's father for an injury. I called to see him
on Thursday last. He informed me his daughter was staying at
Nottingham for a fortnight in connection with some religious meet-
ings being held there. She has improved sufficiently to enable her
to walk two Or three miles at a stretch, and ride a bicycle. She
is quite able to perform ordinary light household duties, but quite
incapable of doing hard work. I should say she has improved as
much as she will, and, according to her mothei', she is now in just
about the same condition as she was previously to her illness, as
she has never been what you would call strong.
COERESPONDENCE.
(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psyclncal Eesectrch.)
GONVILLE AND CaIUS COLLEGE,
Cambridge, Sep. 24, 1912.
In Mrs. Verrall's paper entitled "A Month's Record of Auto-
matisms" (Pruc. S.P.I!. Vol. XXVI., p. 48) an account is given of a
veridical statement concerning a comet. The search for a probable
normal source for the information given by the table of " a meteoric
sian in the east at dawn " was in vain. I write to suarsrest that in
o 00
all probability one of the automatists might have had access to the
pages of the Atheiucnm and have there found all the necessary
information. In the column headed "Science Gossip" for June 22,
Nov., 1912. Correspondence. 327
29, July 6, 13, 20, and Aug. 3, 1907, references to Daniel's comet
will be found. I quote two only :
July 20 : The comet " will probably become visible to the naked
eye earl}' next month."
Aug. 3 : The comet " is now at its nearest to us . . . throughout
next week will be distinctly visible to the naked eye."
The number for Aug. 10th, which might possibly have been in
the hands of either automatist immediately before their sitting at
9 p.m. on the 9th (the Athenceum reaches Cambridge on Friday),
has the following passage : The comet " has been for some nights
visible to the naked eye moving in a nearly easterly direction and
rising at Greenwich a little before midnight."
If any stress is to be laid on the interpretation of the "meteoric
sign " of the script as being Daniel's comet, I think that all the
necessary information might have been accessible to the automatists
through the Jtlieiueum.
However, a more natural interpretation seems to me to be that
the meteoric sign refers to the well-known shov/er of Perseid meteors
which comes on the nights Aug. 10, 11. The well-known lines,
" In August t\vo stars sliine through heaven
On nights between nine and eleven,"
must surely have been heard at some time or other by one of the
automatists. Here, again, the Athenceum of Aug. 3, 1907, supplies a
hint :
" The Perseid meteors will be most conspicuous abot;t the end
of next week," and probably other refeiences to the meteor shower
appeared in the daily papers.
This suggested interpretation would explain naturally the date
on which the meteoric reference emerged in the script, and would
remove any reason to search for any supernormal source.
F. J. M. Stratton.
The enquiry suggested by Mr. Stratton having been put to
the two automatists concerned in the case, they reply as
follows :
—
It is of course impossible for us at this distance of time to assert
positively that we had not in August, 1907, read anj' notes about
the comet in the Athenceum. All that can be said is that :
—
(1) There was no copy of the Aihencemn at 5 Selwyn Gardens,
Cambridge, where the table tilting took place.
(2) Neither of us was in the habit of reading the Athenceum, or
of frequenting libraries or clubs where it might be found.
328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.
(3) The allusion to the "meteoric sign" did not revive in either
of our minds the smallest recollection of anything we had
recently read or heard about. M'^e both know vaguely that
August is a good month for meteors, but we are not
consciously acquainted with the verses which Mr. Stratton
quotes.
Joan Riviere.
H. DE G. Verrall.
Without insistino- too much on the evidential value of this
case (which must, of course, be judged only as one of the
series described in Mrs. Verrall's paper), it may be worth
adding that the phrase " meteoric sign " should perhaps be
interpreted in accordance with the literary and classical pro-
clivities of the automatists rather than with scientific associa-
tions with which they would be less familiar, and from Mrs.
Verrall's report there seems no doubt that the phrase " meteoric
sign," combined with the Latin phrases tilted out at the same
time, suyuested to all of them a comet and not meteors. Also
" a meteoric sign in the east at dawn " was more appropriate
to the comet than to the Perseid meteors seen " on nights
between nine and eleven."
OBITUARY.
JOHN R. HOLLOND.
We regret to announce the loss by death of one of our Vice-
Presidents, Mr. John R. Hollond. Mr. Hollond, who has been
a Vice-President since 1882, was one of those whose interest
in psychical research was aroused—indirectly, if not directly
—
by Sir William Crookes's investigations in the early seventies.
Even before our Society was founded he took an active part
in the experiments of some of those who were most largely
concerned in starting it, and he was one of its earliest
members. He continued afterwards to give valuable assistance
to our work in various ways, and in particular by allowing
seances to be held at his house. Unfortunately for many
years past all active co-operation in psychical research has
been prevented by the increasing ill-health which terminated
fatally on October 19 th last.

THE DIVINING EOD IN GERMANY.
By Count Carl a\ Klinckowstroem, Munich.
While Professor Sir William F. Barrett brought the C[uestioa of
the diviniiin; rod as far back as 1897 and 1900 to a remarkable
point of evidence, it was generally regarded in Germany as a
ridiculous superstition for several years later than this. We
owe it to the late Government official, v. Biilow-Bothkamp, that
the attention of all Germany was drawn to this matter in the
well-known weekly scientific publication Pronicilicus, in December,
1902, the interest in which has not waned since, but rather
increased. Numerous more or less objective debates in one
technical paper after the other followed the first publication
and succeeded in interesting many scientists in the phenomenon.
For instance. Privy Councillor George Franzius, formerly Director
of the ' Kiel Dockyard, became an enthusiastic adherent of the
dowsing rod, and he it was who first suggested sending the well-
O ' CO o
known dowser, Mr. v. Uslar, to German South-West Africa for
the purpose of finding water. After the fiood of bitter con-
troversy had ebbed considerably in 1907, the battle which had
up to then been undecided, received a new impetus through
the intervention of the Munich physician. Dr. Eduard Aigner,
the Secretary of the Monistic Association, and especially known
as an antagonist of the so-called healing miracles of Lourdes.
Since then (1909) the literature of the divining rod has grown
330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.
immensely,^ and at the present time—with the exception of
Prof. Dr. L. Weber in Kiel, its old adversary—the Geological
Institute of Surveyors of Berlin and the Berlin well-sinkers
are almost the only ones who still oppose it.
The most important event in the recent history of the
dowsing wand is the foundation of the Verhand zur Kldrung
dcr Wiinschdrutenfrage. In Autumn, 1911, Privy Councillor
Franzius had invited a number of gentlemen interested in
this question in order to bring them by discussion into more
intimate touch with each other. Simultaneous experiments were
undertaken in the mines of Hanover under the control of ex-
perienced mining officials. The results of these experiments
were so convincing that the participators formed themselves
into a Society, with Professor Dr.-Ing. Eobert Weyrauch at its
head. The Society has now more than 350 members, of all
nationalities, and has shown its scientific tendency and testified
its efficiency in the three pamphlets already published." Two
others are shortly going to press. In the first number the
points of view are formulated which give the tendency of the
Society's work, and which will probably be of interest to
the members of the S.P.R., although we on the Continent regard
the problem as from a physico-physiological rather than from a
psychological standpoint. The introductory lines of the pamphlet
are as follows : ii.
The want of any essential clues to the working of the powers
which influence the dowser has, up to the present, led to great
incertitude in judging of successes, which can be alone removed by
systematic investigation and undoubted statistics. But the water-
finders themselves often need guidance, so that they may learn clarity
of vision free from self-deception, as to their sensations, and thus them-
selves help towards the elucidation of the question.

In order to bring lucidity and system into the explanations of the
phenomena, which have hitherto been tried from the most contra-
dictory points of view, the members in the above-mentioned congress
united themselves in founding the Society. The following gentlemen
form the working committee : Dr. med. Ed. Aigner (Munich), Dr. F.
Behme, Judge of the Common Court (Hanover), Privy Councillor G.
Franzius (Kiel), and Prof. Dr.-Ing. E. Weyrauch (Stuttgart). The
last-named gentleman, Professor of Hydraulics at the Technical
University of Stuttgart, accepted the presidency. All enquiries and
subscriptions should be sent to him.
The yearly subscription is 5 marks until further notice (which
will be increased for 191.3). Each member will receive a copy of each
publication. The chief aims of the Society may be defined as follows :
1. The material collected by the dowsers and other observers is to
be submitted to the Central Committee for the necessary controb
for undertaking testing experiments and for publishing the same.
Further, an Archive will be established in order to make as com-
plete a collection as possible of the literature on the subject. We
may hope in time by these means to approach more nearly the
explanation of the problem.
2. The Society will endeavour to clear up the much discussed
question without bias. The members' subscriptions and other voluntary
contributions will serve to defray the costs of publication and necessary
expenses (correspondence, literature, etc.) incurred by the central office.
3. Apart from these purely business objects the Society hopes to
awaken the interest of scientists for the divining rod, to encourage
interchange of news, in order to fathom the still mysterious powers
in the phenomena of the dowsing rod which influence the human
organism, and gradually to find to which laws of nature these
phenomena may be referred.
The experiments hitherto undertaken seem to imply that the
human organism, given the individual inchnation, possesses the
capability of reacting on conditions such as appear to exist in the
vicinity of water-currents or certain objects organised chemically and
physically in a special manner. There is nothing improbable in
the fact that this inclination, as it is revealed in the motion of the
rod, should find expression in such a special manner. It is therefore
necessary to trace the physical and physiological processes entirely
without prejudice, not to find any reason for adopting a sceptical
attitude in the inexpHcability hitherto of the observed phenomena,

of our efforts. Only in this way can incertitude and mysticism be
eliminated from the question of the divining rod, and in time the
possibility of replacing the dowser by a physically based apparatus
be considered.
I should here make the additional statement, that in the
meantime the famous geologist, Privy Councillor Hippolyt Haas,
Professor at the Kiel University, has joined the Committee of
the Society in place of Dr. Behme.
I think it may interest English readers to learn briefly, on
which bases of observation the defenders of the divining rod
in Germany chiefly rely ;
^ for the successes often quoted by
papers as having been attained by water-wizards are not
generally usable as scientific proofs, as they are very rarely
controlled in a satisfactory manner by experts, and always
leave open many questions chiefly appertaining to hydrology.
It is for this reason also that no great weight can be laid on
the statistics collected by ordinary practical dowsers. Such
considerations do not apply to the method such as has been
in use during the last few years at the Munich Municipal
Waterworks. The chief mechanic, Kurringer, an excellent
dowser, is officially employed by the Board of Works to allo-
cate the points of rupture of burst water-pipes, which was till
now—in the asphalted streets—only possible by complicated
and lengthy excavations. Although there have been non-
successes now and then with this method—partly caused by
indisposition of the dowser—we must admit that the results
obtained in the examination of burst pipes can only be
characterised as bewildering. On the occasion of the last
congress of the Society of German Gas and Water Experts in
Munich in June, 1912, the entire statistics of these experi-
ments have been exhibited by the Director of the Municipal
Waterworks in about fifty plans and drawings. This material
is to be published almost immediately by the Vcrhand
ztir Kldrung der Wilnschclrutenfrarjc. The system of mains
and pipes is shown in these plans, the results of the

methods of investigation hitherto used {e.g. of the phonendo-
scope, a kind of ear-trumpet) are noted, the statements of the
dowser are taken down and a short commentary furnishes a
general view of the issue of the researches. We read, e.g.:
" Biirklein St. 13. Notification: Eushing in all junction-
lines heard over 220 metres of the lines of pipes, proving
defect of tube. Statements of the dowser : turning of the
divining rod at 4 "8 metres from the boundary of the house.
Discovered result: point of rupture of the pipe i'S metres from
the boundary of the house." Another example: " Bogen St. 1.
jSTotification : Hushing in the cellar-pipes. Statements of the
dowser: action of the divining rod at two points, 1'75 metres
and 2'25 metres from the wall of the house. Discovered
result: Point of rupture 2'17 metres from the wall of the
house." Several interesting cases in the official report of such
an investigation have been published first by the Miinchner
Neiiestc Nachriclitcn, and then by Di'. Aigner (/oc. cit?j. We
give one of these typical cases.
On the ground of the Munich Gasworks crossed by, several
streets, the surface between the buildings is strewn with gravel.
There are no unevenesses. One line of rails is laid. The
warm-water supply of the Institute runs parallel to this
line at a depth of 1 metre. One day the water reservoir
showed continued loss of water. When artificial pressure was
brought to bear on the system of pipes, the intensity of the
pressure decreased in such a manner, that a defect in the
supply appeared indubitable. None of the engineers or other
experts knew of any remedy but digging up the ground metre
after metre to look for the damage. The dowser, who was
called in, while walking over the ground above the pipes,
designated two points which were 40 centimetres from each
other, and which marked the boundaries of the purlieu of the
defect. In the excavating it was discovered that exactly under-
neath one of the two places indicated by the dowser there
was a defective socket, which proved, on further examination,
to be the sole cause of the disturbance. This supply has a
length of 30 metres. The calculations, according to chance
and probability, give a very favourable result for the dowser.
Amongst others who were eye-witnesses of the experiments and
positive results were the chief engineers of the Institution.
334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.
Another case which shows in a manner perfectly free from
objection, a notable success of the divining rod, has been
communicated by the Municipal Government Surveyor, Goette
(Plauen).i A dike across the valley had been constructed in
Tambach, near Gotha, the working of which had been under-
taken by Municipal Government Surveyor, Goette. The
reservoir had a loss of 216 litres per second, which pierced
through the rock around the abutment of the wall. By aid
of continued caulking, which was undertaken systematically by
experiments in boring and dyeing, the escape could be
diminished to 120 litres per second. But after this every
other coign of vantage was wanting. " I stood there helpless
and could not advance." A water-finder then came and
offered his services. Mr. Goette made a few tests capable of
being controlled, and was startled at the correctness of the
statements. The man now received the order to settle the
unknown leakages with his divining rod, and acting on his
directions, a number of bore-holes were sunk. " I can assure
you with the utmost certainty that not one of these state-
ments has failed," the reporter asserts. In fact, the entire loss
of water was, with the help of the dowser, diminished to
between 8 and 10 litres per second.
The subject-matter here given, which could be greatly
augmented, may suffice to show readers on the other side of
the channel that we in Germany have considerably advanced
the problem of the dowsing rod during the last few years.
Indeed, we may maintain that the evidence of the facts in
question can no longer be doubted, even though the explanation
of the phenomena alluded to is still an open question. Still,
we do not believe that the fundamental principle of a solution
to the problem lies in a supernormal psychical gift of the dowser,
but in the physical influence of the soil acting on him. It
would take up too much space here now to enter into a
theoretically detailed discussion. The literature mentioned
offers exhaustive information also on this point.

Dec, 1912. Dowsing and Unconscious Muscular Action. 335
DOWSING AND UNCONSCIOUS MUSCULAE ACTION.
By Sir William F. Bap.kett, F.K.S.
The accompanying interesting letter to me from Professor Hyslop,
the Secretary and Editor of the Amei'ican Society for Psychical
Eesearch, illustrates the need of further investigation on the
question of the involuntary and unconscious muscular action
which, I have assumed in my papers, gives rise to the sudden
twisting of the dowsing rod. It is true,—as will be seen from
my Report in Proceedings, Vol. XV., pp. 276 ct seq., and in
subsequent papers in the Journal,—that the hypothesis of
unconscious muscular action needs to be stretched to almost
incredible limits in some cases, and amongst dowsers themselves
it is universally discredited. But what other hypothesis can
take its place ?
New York, November 9th, 1912.
I had occasion to visit a gentleman whose daughter did automatic
writing, for an experiment with her. I learned from him that, owing
to scarcity of water in his well, he had been doing some dowsing
to find more water. He suggested that I should try it. I had
tried it many times in my life, without success. In my youth I
had tried it, and the rod turned occasionally, as it did with a regular
dowser whom I knew. But I could never satisfy myself that uncon-
scious muscular action, combined with gravity and the peculiar strain
on the arms of the rod, were excluded from the cause. But this
turning of the rod was so rare (in my case) that the failures loomed
high in the estimate of the cases. I had not tried it for years,
when this gentleman asked me to see what I could do.
He gave me a maple rod, forked as usual, not witch hazel or
peach, and pointed out the ground over which I should go. He
carefully concealed from me where he had found water. This,
however, I did not learn until after my experiment, because the
directions he gave me led me to infer that he had found water near
a certain tree. I was firmly convinced that he had given himself
away, and that my experiment would be worthless. But I tried it.
There was no evidence of water about. The Merrimac River was
about six hundred feet away, and his house and yard were on a
bluff or slope about thirty feet high. There were no hollows on
the ground over which I was to go, and no one would suspect
water in one place more than another. . . .
,
But with a certain tree and its locality firmly in miud as the
336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.
spot at which the rod had supposedly indicated the possibihtj^ of
finding water, this spot being about one hundred feet from where I
started, I went to work. I held the rod with the point or apex
directly in the upright position. I did not expect it to turn at all,
but also did expect that, if it did turn, it would move forward
from me, as it had always done with the dowsers I had observed,
and as it had done in the few cases in which I seemed to be
successful. I assumed, too, that my belief that the spot was near
the tree would influence its action, if influenced at all, as I approached
the tree. But to my astonishment, it began to turn backward toward
me, and actually pushed on my breast till I had to stretch my hands
out to let it pass, when I had gone to about thirty-five feet from
the tree. The gentleman then suggested that I should try it over
again, and hold the rod as he did, which was in a horizontal
position, so that when it turned down it would pass over 90
degrees of an arc. But I held the rod at an angle of about 45
degrees, expecting that gravity would prevent it from going anj'
other way than downward. To my surprise, it rose to the vertical
position, and then over against my breast as before, and at the same
spot as before. ... I went back and tried it again with the arms at
45 degrees from the perpendicular, and resolved to hold the arms as
tightly as I could to prevent their turning. But the rod again rose
to the vertical and over against my breast, though I strove with all
my might to prevent it by squeezing my hands on the rod as tightly
as its size would permit. The gentleman then told me that this
was the place where he had found the water, or rather where the
rod had indicated it would be found. I had been firmly convinced
that it had been indicated at a spot thirty-five feet farther on.
It is not necessary to explain the facts. The primary point is
that neither expectation nor unconscious muscular action is the most
natural explanation. From the point of view of expectation the
rod should not have turned until I was near the tree, but it turned
where I had not even surmised the spot, this having been concealed
from me. As to the second point, the most natural direction for
the stick to take, when it was held at an angle of 45 degrees from
the perpendicular, was forward and downward. Gravity would most
naturally predetermine that direction, and this was aided by expectation^
under the condition that any motion at all should occur. So we have
here action directly the opposite of expectation and what would be
most natural where gravity has any influence. All this is strengthened
by my determined effort to hold the rod and prevent its turning. . . .
The primary interest of the experiment is not whether we were
Dec, 1912. Gases. 337
really successful in locating water. It is in the facts that we coincided
in the locality involved, and that the rod behaved peculiarly, against
expectation and gravity. The gentleman was far behind me, and
did not precede me in movement. He remained stationary thirty
feet awaj' and behind me. Hence, no suggestion came from his
position. It would be of interest to ascertain whether water could
be found there, but that does not aftect the problem with which we
are here concerned. James H. Hyslop.
CASES.
L. 1191. Dream.
In the following case a friend of Miss Verrall's had a dream,
apparently relating to a script produced by the latter two or
three weeks earlier, which had been seen by no one except
herself and her mother.
Miss Verrall gives the first account of it, as follows :
5 Selavyn Gardens,
Cambridge, Nov. 17, 1912.
On Saturday, Nov. 9, 1912, I went to Cambridge for the week-end
with a friend here called Miss Jones, arriving at about lunch time.
Miss Jones had never stayed in our house before.
On Sunday, Nov. 10th, when we first met at breakfast and before
I had spoken at all, Miss Jones said: "I want to tell you about
my dream. I dreamt that I was writing script, and that there was
an important message in it for you or Mrs. Verrall. I woke up and
remembered part of the message. I thought of making a note at
once, but was too sleepy to get out of bed. As I remember the
message now it was :
'
Tell her she is looking in the wrong place.
She ought to look in Verona.' The message was somehow connected
with Dante. In my dream I saw the bust of Dante, which we saw
at Newnham yesterday."
On Saturday, Nov. 9, 1912, Miss Jones and I had visited the library
at Newnham College, where there is a bust of Dante. No allusion
had been made to this bust at the time nor had our attention been
specially attracted to it in any way.
Helen de G. Verrall.
Mrs. Verrall writes :
5 Selwyn Gardens,
Cambridge, Ahrv. mii, 1912.
On Saturday, Nov. 9th, 1912, the lady here called Miss Jones, came
338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.
with my daughter and another friend to spend the week-end at
Cambridge, this being the first time that Miss Jones had stayed at
our house.
On Sunday, Nov. 10th, I did not breakfast with my daughter and
our guests, but immediately after breakfast my daughter told me
what Miss Jones had reported about her dream of the night before,
and of her own impression that it referred to the H. V. script of
which she and I had spoken a week before.
I then saw Miss Jones, who repeated the dream to me in much the
same terms as it is recorded in my daughter's note. I wrote down the
leading words at the time, and report them in " " below. I
understood Miss Jones to say that there were two sentences : of these
the first, of which she had no clear recollection, concerned "Dante";
the second sentence ran: "Tell her not to look there, but to try at
{or go to) Verona." Miss Jones added that she had an impression
that this message was to be conveyed to my daughter or preferably
to me, and that it was intended to suggest that some one was " on
the wrong tack."
On October 22, 1912, my daughter's script contained the phrases,
in juxtaposition :
" The Lombard poplar—the Florentine's fierce love
—
"
This script was seen l)y me on Nov. 2, and suggested to me that
the combination of Lombardy with Dante might refer to Dante's stay
at Verona. Dante at Verona is the title and subject of a poem by
D. G. Rossetti.
On November 7 I began annotating this H. V. script, but left my
notes incomplete for further investigation of its literary or classical
allusions.
Further investigation, after the hint given by the dream, makes it
clear that the allusion in the script is to Dante at Verona. In
Paradiso, XVII. 71, Dante calls Bartolomeo della Scala, Lord of
Verona, and his first host there, il gran Lombardo. Bartolomeo was
the elder brother of Can Grande, with whom Dante stayed on his
last visit to Verona. It is to this last visit that Eossetti's poem
refers, and the motto prefixed to the poem is a translation of
Paradiso, XVII. 58-60, with a line from the Purgatorio.
Miss Jones knew that my daughter and I were automatic writers,
but had no knowledge of the H. V. script of Oct. 22, 1912.
M. DE G. Verrall.
Dec, 1912. Gases. 339
Miss Jones writes :
Nov. 21, 1912.
On the night between Saturday and Sunday, November 9 and 10
(1912), I was awakened from a rather confused dream, in Avhich I
was either writing script myself or watching people write, by a voice
which gave me a very urgent message to the effect that " They "
were to be told to look at Verona, or to go to Verona, as " They "
were now on the wrong tack. I was sufficiently awake to know
where I was, and I asked, "Whom shall I tell—Helen "Tell H.
to tell her mother," was the reply. It seemed to me that the
mask of Dante, which I may have seen that afternoon in Newnham
Library, was floating in the darkness. There was more of this
message, and I was urged to write it down there and then, but,
feeling disinclined to get up for a light and writing materials, I
satisfied myself by repeating the whole message. In the morning,
however, I had forgotten all but wliat I told Miss Verrall, and have
here set down. I am not Cjuite sure that I was myself writing
script in the dream.
[Signed] Ann Jones.
Miss Verrall adds :
Miss Jones told me to-day, Nov. 21, 1912, that what she saw in
her dream was the death mask of Dante, with which she is familiar,
not the bust of which there is a copy in the Newnham Library ; but
she thought the one might have reminded her of the other.
Helen de G. Verrall.
P.S.
—
{Dec. 2, 1912.) Although I have often discussed questions
of psychical research with Miss Jones, I am absolutelj' certain that
I never told her anything of the contents of my unpublished scripts
(except that I once quoted to her an automatic poem which I wrote
some years ago) until after she had told me of her dream on Nov.
10, 1912. I then said that I had recentl}' had a script containing
references to Dante and Verona.

L. 1192. Telepathic Impressions.
The following series of incidents is of interest in connection
with the above case as indicative of telepathy between Miss
Verrall's friend. Miss " Ann Jones," and her sister. Miss
Verrall writes
:
The experiences narrated below were told to me by the friend
340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.
who is called here Miss Jones, a few weeks after their occurrence.
Her account of them at that time was substantially identical with
the written account which she afterwards gave me. It will be seen
that the circumstances of the case preclude the possibility of any
confirmatory evidence, but I am confident that Miss Jones's testimony
can be relied upon.
Helkn de G. Verrall.
Miss Ann Jones writes
:
May 15, 1912.
Two years ago, as the result of a riding accident,^ my sister L.
was ill with concussion of the brain and a slisrht frontal fracture.
She was under the charge of Sir Victor Horsley and our own doctor
for a year, and is now completely recovered. For five days she did
not speak, and she did not recover full consciousness for three
weeks. I saw her, by the doctors' orders, for a few minutes each
day, and took careful note of what she said. There were several
changes in her speech and in her personality, which were recog-
nised or expected by the doctors. From the first she recognised
me, and though she has absolutely no memory of anything during
that time, my appearance invariably stirred in her some anxiety
immediately connected with whatever business I had in hand at the
time. In a good many instances this was not remarkable, as we
live together, and she knew of all my engagements for that period.
She also seemed aware of any steps I took from day to day in con-
nexion with her own afl'airs.
One or two incidents, however, cannot be so readilj^ accounted for.
The first I noticed occurred about a week after the accident. My
mother was away at the time visiting friends in Yorkshire. She
did not return for various good reasons, but naturally wrote daily.
One letter contained an account of a visit she had paid to an old
cook of ours, who had married about twenty years ago, when my
sister was quite a young child. When I went into L.'s room that
morning she said, " Baa-see is so glad you've come," using a baby-
name by which that cook had always called her, and which went
out of use when she left us.
The next day I had among my letters one from a cousin, who
off'ered to come to stay with me, saying that as L. was in a nui'sing
home she could occupy her room and be of no trouble. I had
completely forgotten the project when I reached L. Her first words
^The accident occurred in May, 1910. —H. de G. V.
Dec, 1912. Cases. 341
as I entered the room were, " You won't let Dora (the cousin) sleep
in my bed, will you ?
"
After these speeches she relajjsed into incoherence or unconscious-
ness, and, of course, I never attempted any explanation or discussion.
The third instance may only be coincidence.
A friend of mine, who occasionally assists me in my work, had
called on me one evening in connexion with some work of mine he
was doing to help me during her illness. She and I often spoke of
him as "The Publisher." The next morning, when I got there, L.
said, "How was he killed?" I said, "Who?" L., "The Pub-
lisher." "Ohl" I said, thinking she had had an inkling of my
visitor, "he's alive!" "Well, then," she asked, "is it Mr.
M. ?
" naming another publisher of our acc^uaintance. I never
attempted to follow up any of her questions, and thought at the
time she was delirious. This happened about 10 a.m. When I got
to Fleet Street, a little before 11, the first evening paper placards
were out with " Death of a well-known Publisher." This turned
out to be Mr. Alfred Nutt, who had been drowned in Paris early
that morning.
1
As she recovered consciousness she lost this habit, though on the day
of Sir George Newnes's death in June, when she was much better, she
asked me constantly what news I was keeping from her, and kept
referring to the hour of his death, saying she knew something had
happened at that time.-
She is not in any way remarkable for this kind of thing in her
normal state, though one of our sisters has occasionally had prophetic
dreams.
[Signed] Ann Jonbs.
Miss Jones wrote later
:
The doctor's instructions were that I was not to speak to her at
all except in short and soothing answers to her questions. She
always asked me about something I had just done before I had
spoken a word. It was an instantaneous thought-reading. Many of
the instances were verj' trivial, and I have forgotten them. One I
can remember. She and I were to have trone with a friend to a
performance of Tristan and Isolde. I forgot all about it until the
day after the performance, when I returned the unused tickets with
a letter of apology and explanation to the friend who had sent them.
^ See my statement below. —H. de G. V.
^Sir G. Newnes was a very old family friend, and it would therefore have been
natural that Miss Jones should tell her sister of his death. —H. de G. V.
342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.
I wrote this letter hurriedlj', and posted it on my way to the nursing
home. L. was very ill that day and quite incoherent, but during the
five minutes I was with her slie talked of Wagner and of the young
man, a singer, who was to have taken us to the opera. We did not
know him well enough for her mention of his name to be natural.
Statement by Miss Verrall.
This last instance might be a case of subconscious memory, since
the patient had known of the proposed visit to the opera before her
accident.
In regard to the death of Mr. Nutt, he was drowned in the Seine
at Meluii on the evening of Saturday, May 21, 1910. The news
of his death was contained in a Renter telegram, which appeared
in the IFestminster Gazette of Monday, May 23, 1910, and in the Times
of Tuesday, May 24, 1910. It did not appear in the Times of May
2.3, and therefore probably not in any morning paper of that day.
At the same time it is impossible to be absolutely certain that the
news was not subconsciously known to Miss A. Jones before she saw
her sister. But in any case Miss L. Jones cannot have been aware
of it, as she was at that time completely cut off from the outside
world. Unless we regard the episode as a chance coincidence, we
must suppose that Miss L. Jones's information was telepathically
acquired either from her sister or more probably from some other
external source.

L. 1193. Vision.
The following case has been sent to us by Miss Alice L. Head,
an Associate of the Society, who requests that, in printing it,
the names and addresses of the persons concerned, except her
own, should be omitted. We therefore substitute pseudonyms.
Miss Head writes as follows
:
26 Leinster Square,
Bayswater, W., My 4, 1912.
I have lately heard of a well authenticated case of telepathy.
A friend who is at present living with us. Miss Margaret Simpson,
lost her brother in the wreck of the Titanic. This brother had had
for some time past a post on board one of the other vessels of the
White Star line, but he had been compelled to resign it on account
of illness.
Dec, 1912. Cases. 343
Just before the Titanic sailed he had the offer of a similar post
on board the fated ship, which he accepted at the last moment.
The fact of his having done so was known to Miss Margaret
Simpson, but not to a married sister, Mrs. Henderson, who lives
in Vancouver.
On April 19 [1912] Mrs. Henderson wrote in a letter to Miss
Emma Simpson (another sister living at CHfton) the following account
:
"I was busy in the afternoon after lunch on Tuesday, April 16,
and I saw Bessie and Nina crying and clinging to one another. I
seemed to be in a kind of dream and yet I was wide awake and
had not even been thinking of them."
Bessie and Nina are the wife and child of Mr. Simpson who was
drowned.
In reply to questions by Miss Margaret Simpson, Mrs. Henderson
wrote again on June 13 :
"You asked me about seeing Bessie and Nina; I was alone in
the house, and they seemed to appear to me in a sort of mist ; I
could not see their faces. Had I been thinking of them at the
time, I could understand it, but I was busy after lunch.
" I did not know anything about Willie's illness then, or that he
was on the '
Titanic,' but I had no doubt that it was Bessie and
Nina that I saw. I told Cissy and Daisy about it that evening
(April 16th, 1912)."
I have myself •
seen the letters from which these extracts are
copied.
The news of the wreck, which took place on [the night of
April 14-15, 1912,] was known in England on Tuesday 16th, and
also in Vancouver.
Alice L. Head.
To this account the signature of Miss Margaret Simpson
was added in corroboration.

This volume is a collection of the Presidential Addresses delivered
at meetings of the Society during the first thirty years of its existence
from its foundation in 18S2. The Addresses show the aims which
the founders of the Society set before themselves and the methods
of investigation and criticism which they and their successors
endeavoured to follow, and also give incidentally some of the history
of the work actually accomplished by the Society. They are reprinted
from the Proceedings, in which they originally appeared.
