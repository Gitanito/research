I was in the passenger seat. My friend fell asleep at the wheel and the truck went off the road and turned end over end. At the time, it seemed time stood still and happened in slow motion.

Everything went black. I saw a movie of my life, even the birth of myself leaving my mother's body, being delivered by doctor. It seemed I viewed my whole life even up to the moment of being in the truck.

I was then in a tunnel floating and had the most peaceful feeling ever in my life. There was a bright white light at the end of the tunnel and I just kept reaching for it. Then, I was just back in the truck, hanging upside down by the seat belt. My friend had got out of the truck by then. We were both ok but spent the night in the hospital. We were both drinking and smoking pot too.

Just so you know.
