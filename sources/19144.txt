greetings everybody I&#39;m Ron James we are
live here in Los Angeles at LA Live for
the world theatrical premiere of Dr
Steven Greer&#39;s new film last century now
I have heard that he is in the building
so we&#39;ll be seeing him very shortly in
the meantime just bear with us for a
little bit I hope the live stream is
working well the internet here is really
really difficult and for a minute we&#39;re
going to play the trailer and we&#39;ll be
right back
oh no
unidentified flying objects is an
obfuscating term this is an alternative
energy and propulsion device
between the late 1800s and now the
ingenious inventions and Sciences have
all been ruthlessly suppressed
confiscated
it reads like James Bond movie but it&#39;s
real it happened here in the United
States
we Master gravity control here on Earth
not extraterrestrial these are projects
that are off the radar even of the
people who manage the Black Project
when someone asks me how bad is the
crisis I kind of don&#39;t know where to
begin so there&#39;s something nefarious to
put
these Technologies within fossil fuels
pollution and poverty overnight that&#39;s
pretty intriguing
this lost Century of technologies that
have existed that have vanished is the
biggest cover-up in Scandal in the
history of the world
oh
hi everybody Ron James again there was a
little delay in Dr Greer getting ready
to come up for interviews but he&#39;s on
his way but in the meantime there&#39;s a
lot of people gathered here in the lobby
that want to see them want to meet them
I want to talk about the movie so let&#39;s
have a couple people pop up who wants to
come up right now and and talk to me
about Dr Greer and his work
hello Hi how are you
what&#39;s your name Marquis Marquis and um
how do you know about the work of Dr
Steven Greer I&#39;ve seen multiple videos
I&#39;ve actually been to a few seminars I
believe he&#39;s like one of the leading
scientists that are that&#39;s actually
involved like really Hands-On a lot of
these people might be phonies but he&#39;s
the real deal that&#39;s fantastic now have
you seen his other movies yes
you know I&#39;ve done the uh I&#39;ve done his
red carpet Ceremonies for every movie so
this is the fourth one that I&#39;ve done
with them and I think lost century is
going to be his best what do you think I
definitely believe it&#39;s going to be
number one it must see you know the
whole family the kids everybody should
see it absolutely all right well thank
you who&#39;s next I need another person to
come up and talk to me
all right thanks for thanks for being
here what&#39;s your name my name is Zach
Zach so are you uh are you excited about
the Lost Century oh I&#39;m super giddy I&#39;m
excited yeah yeah it&#39;s hard to sit
straight yeah have you watched all of
his other films I have maybe not the
first one
first one okay I was there I was there
too yeah I did this exact same thing I&#39;m
doing right now yeah he&#39;s awesome I&#39;m
I&#39;m so happy that he&#39;s doing this and
I&#39;m so happy to support you so what do
you think about the disclosure processes
it&#39;s unfolding right now
I&#39;m glad it&#39;s happening you know 70
years of being tossed in the dark it&#39;s
it&#39;s hard not not not living in truth
and you know having this man be able to
fight for us and just spread the word
and get it out here and get you know
free energy for everything and just fix
this all right so we&#39;re a little late
getting into the building a little late
getting started but we&#39;ve been keeping
the show going for you oh good thank you
yeah well did a nice job with this well
thank you yeah
so I&#39;d like to welcome everyone to the
epri event the pre-e film The starts
around eight and I&#39;d like to thank
everyone for joining us remotely uh we
have a great crowd here about I guess
700 people and uh the the this event is
really to kick off another whole
initiative uh that&#39;s dovetailing with
the disclosure project and that is the
disclosure of not just the fact we&#39;re
not alone in the universe but that there
are technologies that exist already that
have been illegally suppressed and
sequestered that would get us off oil
gas coal Nuclear So part of this movie I
know the people when they first see it
they go they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of angry
and a little depressed because it
outlines that there&#39;s been a hundred
years of these technologies that had
they been brought out when they should
have in the time of Nikola Tesla we
wouldn&#39;t be in the situation the world&#39;s
in today well you know that&#39;s been the
reaction there&#39;s a lot of people that
have seen the movie that are like it&#39;s
optimistic but it&#39;s also a real wake-up
calling a real eye-opener yeah well it&#39;s
Gloria Steinem famously said the truth
will set you free but first it will piss
you off which is yeah that&#39;s about right
and so but the the fact is is that you
know we&#39;re not going to go back in time
and change the mistakes of 100 years ago
however uh I&#39;m convinced that if enough
people see this by you guys networking
it out there and I know we have a number
of celebrities who have been dropping
links for us
what can happen is that the public can
come together and through actions that
are now being taken by the United States
Congress and the government
as well as private initiatives
get these Technologies developed and out
within the next two years or so so our
goal is two or three years from now the
first version of these preferably a
solid state zero point free quote free
energy system would be out open source
that the key here is that it can&#39;t be
patented right it can&#39;t be put into an
intellectual property domain and if we
succeed and you know we&#39;re about to file
in the next couple months a civilian
Rico racketeer influence corrupt
organization lawsuits all over the
United States against major corporations
and individuals who have been complicit
and keep in doing this uh and why I&#39;ve
authorized you&#39;re going to hear this in
my introduction
that our legal team negotiate the open
source release of the Technologies
corporations like Northrop and Lockheed
and General Electric and General Motors
and these others have Raytheon so they
either have to to do that
now the other good news is since the
national Press Club event which I&#39;m sure
all of you saw if you haven&#39;t it&#39;s on
our YouTube channel where this is
streaming you can see it
within three days of that
the intelligence committee for the
Senate passed at a committee a bill that
I recommended first to Bill Clinton and
every president since and that is that
they issue a directive to these
corporations and individuals that they
comply with allowing the legal
government in the United States which
has now been left out of this right
although they don&#39;t know I mean honestly
I mean I meet with the senior people in
Congress and White House they&#39;re not
read in or brief but they either comply
in six months and this is about to get
signed or they are then prosecuted
criminally
uh and if if that doesn&#39;t work then
there&#39;s another action that will happen
you know we need to do this one of the
things because I&#39;ve been doing some
stuff in Washington too that you might
know about when you talk to these guys
people think that the front-facing
government is like part of this and and
most of them are not they&#39;re just as
upset about this this uh as as everybody
else right and so it&#39;s really really
interesting that these guys are actually
on our side and willing to talk to
members of the community to get this
disclosure moving forward
so the senior the senior leadership in
the Senate and the house
and certain the people I&#39;m working with
in the White House military office
they&#39;re all in agreement a the the the
Rogue organization doing this is
Criminal
treasonous and is harming all of
humanity they are also integrated this
was not the case year and a half ago so
a year and a half ago they were being
gas lit like one of the main guys I&#39;m
working with he basically oversees the
black budget of the United States
um but the legal part of it the
authorized part
and he was taken out to the Lockheed
Skunk Works out here
and was shown a bunch of antique
aircraft
and the result of it was he realized
they were being gas lit
and so they called me in and they they
said
we&#39;re not getting the answers we&#39;re
supposed to get because the law had been
passed that the Congress demanded that
the Director of National Intelligence
Pentagon give a report the reports
didn&#39;t really have any meat on the bones
because the people doing the research
were part of the mainstream legal
government and it&#39;s like this lead wall
that exists between the legal government
of the United States and these Rogue
illegal operations which have been
growing for 75 years
Senator Inuit said was 100 accurate
there exists a secret government with
his own Air Force its own Navy its own
funding mechanism that&#39;s above the law
and free from the law itself period so
that is an enormous problem and I think
that ultimately what we&#39;re going to have
to accept as a society is everyone
taking action you need to write your
members of Congress your two senators
the White House and the people who are
Bona fidely
concerned about the environment they
need to step up to the plate and start
an open source free energy lab
where the physics are studied and
released and I think that whole process
you&#39;ll see in this film needs to be
something that is live streamed the
instant there&#39;s a breakthrough it&#39;s
released to the public it goes wide now
the one thing we are recommending to
hold back
and I&#39;m being honest with you this was
negotiated between me and a colonel in
the Air Force years ago is that the
things that fly the man-made UFOs
those are a missile launch system if
they&#39;re weaponized and you don&#39;t want
someone in Mogadishu launching something
to La that arrives in three minutes with
a dirty bomb so some of these
Technologies do need to be brought out
later yeah but the energy ones the run
the things that are around your house
your car
your factories
all that that should have been out 100
years ago so now we can we need to move
and do a I call it a Time snap where
through Collective effort
all of that gets that lost century and
here&#39;s how we reclaim it so the subtitle
here last century the key thing is
actually the subtitle how do you reclaim
it you know every everyone knows we&#39;re
in trouble I&#39;m gonna go check on
something Technical and then get you in
front of your audience
I&#39;ll bring you up and just hey Michael
come on
let&#39;s go this is uh
good to see you how are you good to see
you Michael schrat you can hold that oh
no Michael is working with us with the
disclosure project intelligence what do
you mean and he&#39;s also done so much of
the work with uh this doesn&#39;t stop for
evil you must actually and I want to
thank you and just describe a little bit
of the work you&#39;ve been doing okay
uh it&#39;s been my crusade over the past
two years to preserve an important part
of our national history by commissioning
detailed refined artwork full color 3D
renderings of military crash retrieval
cases I&#39;m not talking about lights in
the sky you know Dr Greer is only
concerned with real first-hand Witnesses
who&#39;ve got hard evidence of Crash
retrievals that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done over
the past two years right yep and now
they&#39;re as I mentioned about 122 that
have been documented right yes correct
and if that&#39;s what we&#39;ve documented keep
in mind that&#39;s the tip of the iceberg
that&#39;s right so I&#39;ve been working with
some guys recently who&#39;ve been on recent
retrievals and that&#39;s why our number of
military whistleblowers now have swelled
to about 755
sources and it&#39;s actually larger than
that because there&#39;s a whole nother
group of them that have quite frankly
you know not given us their 4-1-1 their
their you know phone number and all that
but uh that&#39;s why when we handed that
all three weeks ago to the White House
and the Congress and the Pentagon that
entire archive is now in their hands and
so that&#39;s the other thing the people
need to say okay we want this dealt with
because 33 years of research sources
methods you you&#39;ll see there&#39;s a map
with 145 sites where these have been
operating
uh what&#39;s the move just move your camera
the cameras move so that&#39;s really what
you want to you know focus on right and
that&#39;s why I tell people this is the
actionable intelligence that the US
government says they need to have
they have it
so now all of you guys need to contact
your representatives and say you have it
now do something with it right right
balls in their court now yeah balls in
their course yeah
hey Fred hey hey come on up hey come on
hey how are you huh I can&#39;t hear you
speak up you&#39;re perfect now yeah you&#39;re
perfect that&#39;s what he was telling me
Fred Durst hello
he&#39;s the Limp Biscuit lead dude and he&#39;s
so I&#39;m the narrator yeah he&#39;s the
narrator for the Lost Century so that&#39;s
right yeah so he&#39;s uh I want to thank
him a great guy
um we&#39;ve gotten to know him over the
last six eight months or whatever it is
that&#39;s right and uh I understand you&#39;re
going to actually do a disclosure
podcast sometime I will be doing a
disclosure podcast which you&#39;ll be on
very soon okay good that&#39;s right good
good yeah so are you excited
uh yeah I guess I&#39;m excited this is not
our first rodeo but I&#39;m actually more
excited the fact that uh this is finally
hitting the mainstream you know with
what&#39;s happening in Washington and all
the media so yeah this is an incredible
time where the awareness is seems to be
at an all-time high right and it&#39;s uh
it&#39;s something that young people are
talking about older people are talking
about the awareness is massive right now
so this is a very wonderful time to
bring up the the uh the the idea of Zero
Point Energy being something that&#39;s been
available to us for a very long time yep
well it&#39;s over 100 years we say the Lost
Century you&#39;re going to see in the film
there&#39;s a picture of nikla Tesla with a
engine self-taught engineer and farmer
uh named Stubblefield and out on his
farm they had a sort of an earth battery
type system uh that was running this
guys and it&#39;s 1902.
right 120 years ago so here we are still
burning oil and gas and coal nuclear
power all that when that we haven&#39;t
needed it any of it for over 120 years
well I think your idea of the open
source uh situation to
put it
out there in a way that it can&#39;t be
stopped yep and the last thing we need
is another round of uh this comes out
but it all gets corporatized and tied up
with it because I think it should be
like the internet is kind of Open Source
everybody can you know and the Internet
was developed now there are thousands
and thousands of companies some are
trillion dollar companies this
technology needs to be introduced
initially open source and that&#39;ll give
forth thousands of companies that are
then do specific products and
applications some that will run your
phone to something that&#39;ll run this
building with no pollution and zero cost
so you never get a utility bill
and also poverty and all the madness
happening unnecessarily that&#39;s a
disgrace to humanity right which this
could
save us like that absolutely it would it
would it would change everything very
quickly Milton Friedman a Nobel
prize-winning Economist once said if we
could have an energy source that was
free it would be the thing that would
change the dynamic of the entire
civilization all of it very quickly so
that&#39;s really what we want to achieve
so that&#39;s the whole purpose of this film
The Lost century and how to retrieve it
and uh I want to thank you for your help
and your support and uh we&#39;ll see you
soon we&#39;ll see you in the theater let&#39;s
make it happen
Hey where&#39;s masoli thank you Fred yeah
Fred Durst uh Limp Bizkit
uh so I don&#39;t know what time we&#39;re
getting to be I want some other folks to
come up here where&#39;s where&#39;s Michael
mazzola
oh he&#39;s not coming okay uh I saw Adam
Curry here you want to say hi to
everyone
Adam Curry is a brilliant
scientist who&#39;s uh in the in the film
come on up baby yeah good to see you how
are you congratulations to see you again
no congratulations to you so Adam Curry
you&#39;ve probably seen him in some of the
other documentaries Close Encounters of
the fifth kind uh it&#39;s worked a lot on
on this issue Consciousness issues and
they&#39;re all related right
so you want to say a comment or two
about it I mean I think that&#39;s right I
think in the last 10 years of us
participating together in various
capacities you&#39;ve seen the UFO question
and the Consciousness question kind of
converge right because it&#39;s based on a
new paradigm physics
and what do you see that where the where
the that point of contact is most
for family
deep down with the nature of reality you
can understand the very fabric of
reality you can understand of
Consciousness and what is going to be
the next Generation Technologies right
yep and that&#39;s it because they&#39;re not
only going to be technologies that enter
that run this building but kind of what
they&#39;re working on in certain quarters
where Interstellar communication
Technologies they&#39;re not using the speed
of light
they&#39;re they&#39;re using quanta of thought
in the Consciousness field interacting
with
the subtle
field of energy that then can be
electromagnetically induced so those
Technologies allow for instantaneous
communication across a million light
years of space that&#39;s right yeah yeah
it&#39;s the ultimate quantum entanglement
for those of you who know physics but
its applications are not just in energy
hi oh he&#39;s back I&#39;m back so I&#39;ll help
you with the microphone are you okay
yeah everything&#39;s great we&#39;re just
making sure the stream was hanging that
was it yeah great to see you Adam
likewise what&#39;s wrong thank you for
doing that hey fix your microphone real
quick just to make sure okay thank you
there there&#39;s Michael
mm-hmm
as Michael mazzola let&#39;s get over this
way a little bit and
they keep moving me we do
too big take up too much space that&#39;s
right thank you baby for being here so
Michael is here he&#39;s worked on uh four
of our five documentaries right and
we&#39;ve been the director and I want to
thank him we&#39;ve gotten to know each
other as very close friends and
colleagues and he&#39;ll tell you I&#39;m a very
tough customer
who to thank you but he&#39;s done a great
job he&#39;s done a wonderful wonderful job
and
um and so I wanted to say I&#39;d like to
say anything about the film so
um when I when I met Dr Greer in
December of 2015. he laid out a vision
for a Trilogy of documentaries the first
one was going to be unacknowledged the
second was going to be Close Encounters
of the fifth kind and the third one was
going to be this one the Lost century
and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s funny because when we
were making unacknowledge I thought oh
you know maybe maybe this will go on
Vimeo maybe a few thousand people will
see it and I would be happy if that
happened and I couldn&#39;t believe what the
response was became the biggest
documentary of 2017 it just absolutely
exploded and changed the world
then we&#39;re making Close Encounters in
the fifth kind I thought well sure
unacknowledged was popular
but no one&#39;s going to want to see this
movie I mean it&#39;s so it&#39;s so weird and
all this Consciousness stuff and then I
saw things happen in 2020 that I didn&#39;t
think I would see in my lifetime the
response from that it really shifted the
culture right so now here we are with
the Lost century and once again uh my
instincts are telling me well who wants
to see an hour and 40 minutes about free
energy right but the movie&#39;s been out
for a few weeks and all and it&#39;s been
number one and so thank you all of you
for proving me wrong once again thank
you so much and thank you Dr here it&#39;s
gonna be honor of my life to do this
with you I love and appreciate yourself
thank you you&#39;re an angel yeah
there you go well thank you so yeah
Michael was a very young guy I guess it
was you know he was in his 20s and uh
you know I I the thing about Michael
you know there are a lot of people in
entertainment
that have certain talent but he&#39;s super
smart and you got to keep up here with
what&#39;s going on right so he&#39;s very smart
amazing editor very creative Works in
very funny comic relief aspects of it
and you know the other thing I want to
do is thank everyone who
crowdfunded this film all five
documentaries have been crowdfunded by
We the People there&#39;s no corporate shill
telling us what we can and cannot put in
it and by the way our fundraising goal
for this documentary was 500 000 we&#39;re
at 690 000 now so thank you all so you
know so we&#39;ve exceeded it by almost 50
percent uh 40 or so and that&#39;s enabling
us to you know get the message out
because the distributor doesn&#39;t pay for
any of the marketing you know any of
that not even the poster so we have had
to do that but all of you guys by
contributing made the film I also want
to thank the cast oh I see okay come on
up
Mr eisenstein yeah
just met this gentleman today he was in
the film awesome and uh come talk to
talk to us a little bit about how you
feel about how you uh got involved and
what&#39;s your view on it
is
well you know I like the film okay
I&#39;m not sure how I got involved actually
uh Michael I think dick Russell or yeah
maybe dick Russell yeah dick Russell
yeah and um
I guess my my
kind of wish or or hope or blessing for
the film is that
it&#39;s
eventually known as a watershed moment
where where what had been
um
inconceivable and and and
exiled from consensus reality started to
come in in a new way
and also that there&#39;s there&#39;s a um for
lack of a less new agey word of
Consciousness that permeates the film
that is just as important or maybe more
important than the factual information
right right yeah well thank you and
thank you and this is Dick Russell a
very eminent environmentalist now it&#39;s
very very good to see you see you thank
you and I want to thank dick for being
part of doing an interview in here and
he&#39;s a very close friend with Bobby
Kennedy Jr and has worked on
environmental issues so from your
perspective you know what is your hopes
about this film what can happen
I I think this film is is quite amazing
I spoke a lot about climate change in
the film which you&#39;ll see tonight and
what we&#39;re facing as a civilization but
the film takes us to a another place and
it&#39;s actually a much more hopeful and
wonderful place that has possibilities
that have never have either been
squelched or never been explored and
that that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got to do in
terms of changing the energy equation so
that we save this planet for our kids
and our grandkids and I&#39;m happy to be
here thrilled to be part of this this
evening and uh and look forward to
seeing the the big screen version thank
you yeah absolutely thank you thank you
Mr Russell yeah so you know two things
one is there&#39;s a couple people that just
really want to meet you that are here
and the other is I&#39;m not sure if you
know this but you and I both have films
out at the same time oh I did know that
mine is accidental truth and you and I
have been right next to each other on
the top of the chart since they came out
and so a lot of people would think well
there&#39;s so many different aspects of
ufology and it&#39;s just this is today&#39;s
like just a show of how we really should
be supporting each other towards
disclosure we&#39;re both putting out really
good material and different messages to
different people and um come on up
this is one of your one of your fans who
just wants to say hello
speak up
my my work is I work with archangels and
um with Christ and so I was thinking
that perhaps we also need all part of
the same Cosmos
so we&#39;re going to be finding that out
more and more in technology it seems to
help in ways thank you
I love your dress you got Saturn and
we don&#39;t need Rockets anymore honey
we haven&#39;t needed those in a while
Rockets are so 1940. they&#39;re so Elon
I know I&#39;m just joking I know it&#39;s Los
Angeles you can&#39;t make a joke
you will thank you I appreciate it thank
you very much do we have anybody else
well we&#39;re going to need to start moving
into the theater I want to thank
everyone sorry we started this a little
late but we&#39;re going to do uh start
promptly at eight for everyone here and
I want to thank you for your help thank
you and what your endeavors are and for
setting this up yeah and uh this is the
you&#39;ve had me do your red carpets for
all your films and I&#39;ve been kind of
honored by that I think that was
wonderful and I&#39;m having a great
experience I appreciate it and now we&#39;re
right by right next to each other at the
top of the chart filling the world in on
disclosure it&#39;s time folks it&#39;s going to
all come out and in my remarks down
there you&#39;re going to hear about
some other things that are sensitive but
it&#39;s pretty amazing what&#39;s happening
right now that&#39;s awesome yeah since the
national Press Club everybody Dr Stephen
Greer thank you all give us one second
to move that camera and get it set up on
you so we can keep the live stream going
I don&#39;t take paper give it to my
assistant yeah
hello everyone hello I am Pat Pearsall
I&#39;m Dr Bruce team
thank you
thank you
um a quick housekeeping item if you have
a phone with you can you please put it
on silent
uh we would ask if you would just put it
on airplane or just turn the sound down
that&#39;d be great
thank you
thank you
hey everybody
ah not a bad turnout
I love you too random person
so uh thank you for coming uh I&#39;m
Michael mazzola I directed the film
I met Dr Greer in December of 2015 and
we were meeting to talk about our first
film that we did together unacknowledged
and thank you
and in that first meeting he laid out a
vision for a Trilogy of films the first
one was going to be unacknowledged
the second one was going to be Close
Encounters of the fifth kind
and the third one was going to be the
film you&#39;re going to see tonight the
Lost century
so the trilogy is now complete
when we were making unacknowledged I was
thinking you know maybe
the film would go on Vimeo maybe a few
thousand people would see it and I would
be happy
instead it became the biggest
documentary of 2017 and it was seen by
hundreds of millions of people and I
could not believe the response that we
got so thank you for that
thank you
then when we were making Close
Encounters of the fifth kind
I thought well sure unacknowledged was
popular but man this movie&#39;s so weird I
don&#39;t know who&#39;s going to want to see
this
and then that became the biggest
documentary of 2020 and it was seen by
millions of people and we are extremely
grateful thank you
so now here we are uh uh this film and
once again My Mind Is Telling Me well
who wants to see you know share those
other movies were big but you know I
don&#39;t know who wants to see a hundred
minutes about free energy well
the film&#39;s been out for four weeks it&#39;s
been the top of the charts on iTunes and
Amazon and that&#39;s thanks to you guys so
thank you for once again proving me
wrong
these little movies are made
with
a team of mostly volunteers and it&#39;s all
made possible by contributions from Dr
Greer supporters
and yet these these little movies they
punch above their weight and they have a
huge impact
and I think that&#39;s because there is a
higher Consciousness that is working
through these projects
and that leads me to the man I&#39;m going
to introduce Dr Stephen Greer
this is a man who has uh dedicated his
entire life
to uplifting Humanity
starting when he was a young man
becoming a meditation teacher
and then a trauma doctor to save lives
and now on his most important mission
to save the planet
with the disclosure project initiatives
that he launched and that he directs
it has been the honor of my life to work
with him on these films
please give him a huge round of applause
foreign
s of you who are watching online and in
particular I want to thank the people
who have been with me for so many years
you&#39;re going to see people with me like
Raven for 25 years Pat Justice Marcel
there&#39;s this whole group of people who
have dedicated their lives and I remind
people this entire effort is 33 years
running has never had an office or a
full-time staff is love
and we&#39;re just really uh blessed to have
such dedication I want to thank all of
you guys because the crowdfunding of
these documentaries is how it&#39;s happened
there are no corporate funding there&#39;s
no one who&#39;s telling us we can cut
something out or have to cut it out
because they don&#39;t want it which is what
would happen with this heartless
soulless money grubbing entertainment
industry
so should I just say that I&#39;m sorry so
so we have total freedom to tell the
truth and the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so that is the whole
purpose of the disclosure project it&#39;s
not often popular
and I think that most people don&#39;t
really want to hear the entire truth
about it but in the next six months to a
year they&#39;re going to have to I mean
every person on planet Earth for reasons
I&#39;m going to go into in a moment but I
also want to thank folks who are in the
film particular Fred Durst of Limp
Biscuit there he is thank you brother
thank you
we volunteered to narrate the film and
he did an awesome job you&#39;re going to
see I really want to thank Phillip
Latham who&#39;s been the producer on it
and particular I want to thank uh people
on my team who have been in the movie
and also worked with me for years like
Michael schrat who&#39;s the specialist in
trash retrievals of extraterrestrial
vehicles thank you Michael
and the other members of the cast who
are who are here who have been
interviewed in the film uh dick Russell
who worked closely on the environmental
issue Charles eisenstein also
Consciousness environment Adam Curry
who&#39;s seen you&#39;ve seen him in other
films brilliant scientists
trusted uh person on Consciousness and
these Technologies and their interface
because that&#39;s really the future Maurice
Campbell who worked with Hoyt sweep the
you&#39;re going to see this in here a
device that would have run the entire
planet that was in the 80s that got
confiscated by these fascists
it&#39;s enough we&#39;re done
we&#39;re done with that
Amore King who is a great energy
researcher whose book is available the I
think there are a couple hundred copies
here that you can get for free that he&#39;s
sent over a brilliant scientist who&#39;s
worked in this field of free energy zero
point energy and energy from water using
the type of Technology you&#39;re going to
see in here now
the reason all of this is so important
right now is because the Congress is
moving very quickly
to disclosing the UAP as it&#39;s called in
UFO issue but let me just tell you they
make up a new name for this stuff every
few years it&#39;s all nonsense
an unexplained aerial phenomenon what is
this ball lightning
so let me shorthand it for you there are
two things
they&#39;re extraterrestrial vehicles and
they&#39;re the man-made ones the advanced
technology alien reproduction Vehicles
the dominant phenomenon that people see
are actually ours and they&#39;re coming out
of the Locking Skunk Works Northrop
Grumman Raytheon e-systems EG and G Etc
as you all know from the disclosure
project event about three weeks ago in
Washington
we are organizing and now have 150
attorneys and legal professionals to
launch in the coming months uh in all 10
Federal districts a racketeering
influence corrupt organization lawsuits
against all those corporations and
individuals involved in the confiscation
of these Technologies you&#39;re going to
see them
foreign
amendment to a bill from the
intelligence Committee of the Senate and
other committees passed that is allowing
a window a safe harbor or amnesty period
for these corporations and individuals
involved to come forward and if they do
not do so within six months of the
signing of this amendment they will be
prosecuted criminally
we hope that none of that has to happen
and if that isn&#39;t effective there are
other measures that are being developed
but those are the ones we don&#39;t want to
see happen
I only say that
within nine months to a year from now
things that have been kept secret for 75
years need to be disclosed and disclosed
honestly or it will be done
they will just simply be done I&#39;m not
going to say more than that but I&#39;m
involved with the team that&#39;s on that
project
what we have to understand is the reason
this is so important is because these
Rogue and illegal secret government
programs and there are corporate uh
Associates who are behind it have now
become an existential threat to all life
on Earth not just the environment not
just Global endless war not just a sort
of global totalitarian insanity but they
have Advanced Technologies we don&#39;t go
into that in this film too much but you
need to be aware of it that are
targeting extraterrestrial Assets in
space
and those technologies have reached the
point where they are a serious threat to
other worlds
now this has been a problem since 1945
when we made the first atomic bomb
let me tell you very bluntly what I&#39;ve
been telling members of the Senate and
House and the day I land at the airport
land in DC on Monday on Tuesday I&#39;m
meeting with the senior member of the
Congress that goes through this but when
you detonate one of those there&#39;s the uh
what people know about the the EMP right
the electromagnetic pulse they could
take out all electricity and
Communications in North America placed
in the right point over the continent
but what people aren&#39;t being told about
which Edward Teller and the people in
the Manhattan Project have developed
atomic bomb didn&#39;t know there is a
so-called scalar
wave that goes out attendant to that
that scalar wave moves in a quantum
entanglement which means it&#39;s faster
than the speed of light and that&#39;s why
all these civilizations became concerned
why because it rips the fabric of
space-time and Interstellar
Communications and travel
this is why every nuclear facility has
been overflown by extraterrestrial
Vehicles because it is such a threat to
Earth and is such a threat to the world
we think in terms of straight line
right but think about what quantum
entanglement means every point in space
and time is connected every other point
and this reality which is a proven fact
of physics is quantum entanglement in
physics that when you weaponize that
capability which is what has happened
then the civilization that does so is
then a threat not only to themselves but
they are a threat to others
this is the crisis we&#39;re in that&#39;s
unacknowledged that people are not
really aware of now members of the
Senate armed services and Senate
intelligence committee I began providing
to their most Senior People 17 months
ago all this information the entire
Congress and the White House and
Pentagon now have a database that has
145 black sites on it and it has 755
whistleblowers information in it
that information the unredacted version
of it or in the hands of a few people
you folks please contact your members of
Congress and your two senators and the
president the White House and ask them
to pursue that information to get this
under control because we not only need
to bring out these Technologies and
literally save the biosphere but we also
need to get these illegally run projects
under control because they are a serious
threat and it&#39;s growing daily it&#39;s been
growing for 70 years now here&#39;s the risk
the risk is that group can hit a bunch
of buttons and false flag operations
between now and nine months from now I&#39;m
just saying that to you
but we&#39;re going to do everything we can
to avoid that
the other part in the false flag as in
all kinds of host events an alien
invasion event which they&#39;re fully
capable of doing using these Advanced
Technologies and that is the big risk
for members of Congress because they are
just beginning to get their minds around
this problem the Senate is about 17
months ahead of the house
when I&#39;m meeting with a senior member of
the House on Tuesday to get
you know 17 months caught up there right
and and the reason we have to do that is
that they&#39;re going to start working
together to hold of open hearings in the
house
but they&#39;ve already been gas lift by one
whistleblower that I provided
information to who came out
the week of the national Press Club
event for us
and he immediately fell into the
clutches of this cabal associate and is
now saying that the aliens are murdering
humans not true those events in Brazil
and elsewhere those are CIA and related
projects using these Advanced
Technologies that have been doing
abductions and mutilations and killing
people and at times exploding entire
villages
we know this we have the witnesses to it
we can prove it the problem is the
public and the so-called UFO subculture
and now the Congress that brought and
that this information is getting pushed
to the fore as we push this
disclosure effort forward the worst
outcome
is that the entire United States
government gets converted over
to this false flag narrative and then
authorizes further these actions that
threaten Universal peace
so this is a very corrupt time I would
encourage people to be very aware that
we meet our hands on deck and this is a
time not to be sitting on a fence I&#39;m
making also an appeal to people who have
the means uh to help us create what
you&#39;re going to see in this film this
law centering how to reclaim it here&#39;s
how we reclaim it
we reclaim it by very quickly developing
or acquiring these technologies that are
zero point Quantum vacuum free energy
open source in them no more patenting
no more secret sauce
full monty it&#39;s out there
why
because there&#39;s no time left for that
month
and so I would say that this film is
really about a call to action the first
part of it describes the problem and the
history going back over 100 Years of
these Technologies being in existence
and how they were suppressed why they
were surprised who did it
you know where are the 20 20 trunks of
papers of nikla Tesla you&#39;ll see in this
film we have the proof that the FBI
stormed into his place stole them the
day died
that we&#39;re going to sue specifically for
those to be released
so this organization the disclosure
project and the attendance operations
particularly the the ce5 initiative
those of you who understand ce5 contact
I&#39;ve seen Close Encounters of the fifth
kind thank you for doing it because the
heart and soul of what we&#39;re doing is
that it&#39;s got to be guided by a higher
vision
not a menless war in Conflict what we&#39;re
trying to do is avoid the conflict and
to resolve this issue peacefully
unfortunately
that matter will be no longer possible
in about nine months
because a group is being stood up to get
this under control and it will not be
through a legal process or hearings this
is why the Congress listen to me
carefully you have a clock on you and
it&#39;s six to nine months we need action
and for that to happen because it&#39;s a
Democratic Republic all of you and all
of you listening online need to take
action call your Congressman call your
Senators write to them go to their
offices and say pay attention to this
and don&#39;t be fooled and gas-lit by the
false flag information
because that is the big risk right now
is disclosure is actually gonna is
happening it is happening I can tell you
what you&#39;re seeing in the media is a
fraction of what&#39;s Happening behind
doors
both in the Senate and the house because
I&#39;m involved
intimately and so I just think that we
have to get let them hear from the
public and not let them be hijacked over
into the wrong path because there are
two paths here
a path that results in disclosure the
release of these Technologies and
peaceful contact with these
extraterrestrial civilizations that&#39;s
one path the other path is ruinous and
catastrophic there aren&#39;t there&#39;s really
not another path
when we were first doing the disclosure
project and Gathering the first tranche
of top secret whistleblowers
in 2000 we were at our home out in the
Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia about
20 minutes down the road from Thomas
Jefferson&#39;s house who wrote the
Declaration of Independence
I have to say that because I met someone
graduate from college recently they
didn&#39;t know who that was anyway
um I don&#39;t comment on the educational
system collapse but
but
interestingly we&#39;re working on this and
I I know this sounds very odd but Thomas
Jefferson&#39;s voice came in like From
Another Dimension said the next American
Revolution
those words just those words
it&#39;s not just American though it&#39;s
Global it&#39;s a change on the whole
planet
function because when you bring out this
information technology this science
what happens is that the world is
liberated from the Yoke of the current
order and there is true freedom and
prosperity and abundance that will
Blossom all over the world the three
billion people in poverty that will end
within 20 years
so it&#39;s hard it&#39;s time for
being on the fence is over
we hope people will come forward if
anyone has one of these devices please
contact us we have a pathway to get it
out and we will get it out we have the
security operations in place and we have
funders ready to help with that we also
need people though pending someone with
an operational device that hasn&#39;t been
corrupted and already encumbered to put
the funds together so we can create a
zero point Quantum vacuum energy lab
that will open source all this
technology very very quickly and save
the biosphere but also save Humanity
from the clutches of a
International
Psychopathic group of folks I was
talking to one of these people who works
in
Black projects and he said
the folks who are running those Rogue
elements they&#39;re recruited based on
their being sociopaths or
psychotherapists
absolutely true
so and that&#39;s you know there&#39;s only four
and a half percent of the population
Associates
but the high functioning ones are the
ones involved so those of us are vastly
in the majority are good people on the
planet and it&#39;s time for us to be
counted we cannot be sheeple anymore we
have to be awake to this and take action
and create a beautiful world for our
children and our children&#39;s children my
wife and I are going to have our 44th
anniversary next month
please the Angel that&#39;s made all this
happen supported it I have four
daughters of 12 grandkids so what kind
of world are we leaving them right so
what I&#39;m saying to people is we have to
choose that world the extraterrestrials
aren&#39;t going to land on this planet and
force it
that&#39;s not going to work
they&#39;ll only intervene under a worst
case scenario
a very worst case scenario openly and
that you don&#39;t want to see that you
really want to hear about that so in the
meanwhile we have to gather together our
own efforts and realize we can do this
we absolutely collectively do this in
the next two three years and in the next
10 or 20 years transform the entire
planet
that&#39;s what this project is about that&#39;s
the true mission to planet Earth that
both the Extraterrestrial people and all
of us working on this project are
working to achieve so thank you for
joining and thank you for your support
God bless you all and enjoy the film I
love all of you thank you
thank you
