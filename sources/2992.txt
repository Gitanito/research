It affords me much pleasure dedicating
to you this Treatise in support of those prin­
ciples of the Water-cure which you have so
eminently contributed to establish in this country.
That the health of our fellow-creatures may be­
come as universal as your benevolence can
desire, and that you may long live to enjoy the
happiness of witnessing it, is the most ardent
wish of
M y D e a r S i r ,
Yours truly,

P R E F A C E .
T h e object of the present work is to promote the
proper knowledge of a subject which has recently
occupied much of the public attention—I allude
to the Water-cure. Simple as this cure may ap­
pear from the simplicity of the remedy employed,
and known, or believed to be known, by every­
body—namely, water, there is a very great deal
to be said and learned as to the effects of its
manifold applications. The days for the search
after the philosopher’s stone are pretty well over,
and the idea of finding a remedy, in the shape of
pill or draught, by way of panacea, may be said
to have passed also; this being admitted, I will
not, as many have done, attempt to cry up water
as an universal, and the only sure and safe re­
medy. I acknowledge the wonderful effects of
it as related by others, and witnessed by myself;
I acknowledge it as a Divine gift, and desire to
see it used and appreciated as such. The folly,
to use a mild expression, of despising water, even
XU PREFACE.
as a beverage, will be evident, although with sor­
row be it said, it still prevails to a great extent;
but the doubts as to its efficacy for curing and
eradicating disease must be overcome: to ac­
complish this is one of the chief aims of these
pages.
A residence of some months at the “ Water
University,” as Griifenberg is called on the Con­
tinent, careful study, diligent inquiries and obser­
vations there, have crowned my former prepos­
session in its favour, and brought conviction
home to me. I cannot say water will cure all
and every disease, and in a short space of time. I
must at once state, and I do so to prevent many
disappointments, that some chronic affections will
require many, many months to be thoroughly
eradicated; and in stating this, let me appeal to
the reader, whether it can be expected that a
disease which has, perhaps, hovered about the
body for years, is to be expelled by the touch of
a wand, as it were ? and whether it is not sufficient
to establish the usefulness of the water treatment,
and its general adoption, if diseases ofsome years’
standing be cured in as many months, as I have
seen—diseases, too, which have resisted all the
efforts of our art ? Medicine has done much in
PREFACE. X1U
its time, and undoubtedly will do so still; but
this is no reason why we should not devote our
attention and energies to what might be termed
a new branch of the science. And here I must
state briefly that the Water-cure should be prac­
tised by properly qualified medical men only, and
that such should make it their study; for, however
paradoxical it may appear to some of my readers,
I maintain that it is a study, and one requiring
the greatest attention and research; for it is not
sufficient to swallow large quantities of water and
apply wet bandages to any ailing part: the effect
of certain quantities of water in certain constitu­
tions ; of the various degrees of wet in the com­
presses or bandages; the time of their application
in different diseases;—all this, and much more
must be acquired and thoroughly known. And
who but a medical man, a man acquainted with
the human frame, and diseases incident to it, can
make the proper deductions and inferences ? who
but one absolutely making it his profession can
have sufficient knowledge of the subject to prac­
tise it with utility ? In anything like a serious
disease, therefore, it would even become danger­
ous to treat oneself, as many, by the perusal of
works on the subject, might be induced to do.
XIV PREFACE.
In the course of this work I have endeavoured
to show such casualties and ailments as might
safely be treated at home by persons of common
sense, having a due regard and care for the pre­
scribed rules ; but I repeat, that anything like a
disease should not be meddled with, unless under
proper advice. Let me assure every one who may
doubt this, that no interested motive prompts
these remarks, but a sincere desire to guard the
public and individuals against experimentalizing
too much with water, where such a valuable boon
as health is concerned. Health is not difficult to
preserve, by proper attention to the necessary
action of the human body; and the rules I have
laid down in this publication will, I trust, contri­
bute to preserve the health of many a one who
will deign to grant it an attentive perusal. That
there is a great deal more to be said on the sub­
ject of the Water-cure than what this work con­
tains, is self-evident; and although I have endea­
voured to make it as complete and useful as
possible, many new facts daily arise to add to the
knowledge of the system. My great object is to
obtain proselytes to the cure, satisfied of its great
utility. The number of establishments on the
Continent similar to the parent one at Grafen-
PREFACE. XV
berg is constantly increasing, and some of them
are at the expense ofvarious governments. Many
medical men of first rate eminence have written
in the highest terms on the subject, and practise
the cure to the exclusion of medicine. All this
argues much in favour ofour propositions. Now,
if the system really be so beneficial as I conscien­
tiously believe it to be, I see no reason against its
general introduction into this country, where a
vast deal of suffering and disease exist, particu­
larly of a nature to be easily expelled by water;
and it would be a great question of economy too,
to have it introduced into our public establish­
ments, as hospitals, union-houses, &c., by which
an immense annual saving might be effected in
the aggregate.
To render this publication more complete, I
have availed myself of such sources as the several
writings on the subject afforded me. May it
prove beneficial to my fellow-countrymen—may
its plain statement of facts have the. effect of con­
vincing the doubtful, and confirming in beliefthe
wavering—may it be the means of preserving
the health of many, which, for the want of proper
knowledge, might have fallen a prey to insidious
disease, and of restoring many a constitution,

which, for want of courage or other causes, has
been injured ; and, above all, may it prove advan­
tageous to the rising generation by their being
timely inured to the use of one of Heaven’s
greatest blessings—Water. If all, or any of these
results do occur, I shall be amply rewarded; and
should there still be any sceptics, to them I can
only say, in the words of Holy Writ, “ Go and
do thou likewise.”
INTRODUCTION.
Many, and no doubt the majority of my medical read­
ers, are still opposed to the Water-cure, and look
upon it with a prejudiced eye ;—many more among the
public have yet to be convinced of its benefits—but it
cannot be otherwise. As with every great truth, it is
slow in forcing itself upon the mind, but in the end
truth must prevail.
No science, it is an admitted fact, has been more
subject to error than the medical one; the errors
and discrepancies since its cultivation have been innu­
merable. The faculty are often divided as to the effect
of certain medicines in particular diseases, and if we
consider that a drug is often effectual in one case, and
utterly fails in another, apparently similar one, the
anomaly will be explained. Civilization has made too
rapid a progress, and knowledge is dawning far too
brightly on mankind, to attempt to confine any par­
ticular branch of it to an exclusive class; and we do
not see why a knowledge of the human body, its
functions, its diseases and their cures, so necessary to
B
18 INTRODUCTION.
our well-being, should not be or form part of a man's
acquirements. We do not mean to assert that the
perusal of a few medical works will constitute a doctor;
—penetration—correct judgment—presence of mind—
great and manifold cultivation and learning are requisite
to assume a commanding position in the profession;
although it cannot be denied that the study and practice
of two thousand years have brought to light many truths
in the science, and tliat many names by diligent and vast
researches have added a lustre to it, we must, on the
other hand admit, that the further we swerve from
nature, the more complicated does the science become.
The human race has been totally changed by centuries
of progressing civilization, and although the vital power
in its essence still remains the same, its outward appear­
ance of necessity assumes quite a different form, the
numerous outward influences from the very cradle con­
ducing to a life far removed from nature. As a necessary
consequence, the appearances in disease also assumed
a different form, the disease itself became different, and
the cure could no longer be confined to the simple me­
thod which was based upon the regulated due action of
the vital power. The profession therefore had one of two
courses to pursue : either by a more careful study of
nature to endeavour to lead back the altered appearances
to the original simple ones, and thus not lose the right
track; or, what was certainly more convenient and
ensured quicker results, they had to seek for new
remedies to overcome these altered states: hence the
INTRODUCTION. 19
accumulation of the vast treasure of therapeutics; for as
the faculty found or believed they found in this or that
proceeding, or in this or that remedy, an antidote for all
diseases, arose those medical systems and schools, each
well founded in its time. “ C’est le premier pas qui
coute.” Once swerved from the right path, it was no
easy task to regain it. Confidence in the power of
nature gradually vanished, the wvis medicatrix naturae”
was no longer spoken of, nor the proper guidance and
support of it taught; each pursued his own course,
believing it to be the right one; or at all events having
the conviction that he was not more mistaken than his
colleagues.
Considering well all these circumstances, the medical
world cannot fail, sooner or later, to pay much more
attention than they have done to the cure of diseases by
water, and not deny it the merit it has, because it hap­
pens that it is through a retired countryman the system
was founded, and not a man brought up in our schools
and educated in our hospitals.
My object is to show, that in water we have one of the
most powerful therapeutic agents yet discovered, that
its effects in curing disease are wonderful, and that a
general adoption, now that once it has taken root,
cannot fail to take place in many and most diseases.
Also, that it is not quite so innocent (if abused) as many
pronounce it to be, which I shall more fully demonstrate
hereafter. Some of the writings on the subject border
on the miraculous, whilst others are quite opposed to
b 2
2 0 INTRODUCTION.
the use of water: it is these extremes which should be
avoided;—the corn must be winnowed from the chaff,
and as, when the latter is given to the winds, the former
becomes useful; so I hope to see the time, when all
exaggerations will have been sifted from the truth, and
the real sound principles remain. Extravagant zeal is
often injurious to a cause, which also applies to the case
in point; for if we are told by the friends of water, of a
chronic disease of twenty years* standing being eradi­
cated in as many days, and by such an easy process, try
ourselves a similar case coming under our own practice,
and fail, we at once come to a judgment quite as wrong,
as believing in the eradication of such a long standing
disease, in such a short space of time ; and yet this fre­
quently happens. Some medical men, desirous to give
water a trial, have tried, and found it wanting, through
lack of perseverance however in themselves, or in their
patients, and occasionally adding a dose of their own, by
which tlie cure was either interrupted or defeated. The
Water-cure requires patience, perseverance, and a know­
ledge of its great effects; without these it is impossible
to succeed; it requires careful study, and I doubt not
but that by a proper and due cultivation, Hydrotherapia
may become even more brilliant in its results. The
use of medicines according to the present allopathic
principles, in going through the Water-cure, is to be
utterly repudiated; chiefly because all the functions of
the organism are kept in complete activity whilst under
the treatment, as far as the existing vital power in the
INTRODUCTION. 21
individual treated admits of this; and that, such being
the case, the remedies administered may have a different
effect to what is anticipated, or wished for, their effects
under such circumstances not being known.
As we have hinted, the originator of the present
system of the Water-cure is a retired countryman,
named Vincent Priessnitz, living in a nook of the
Austrian Silesian territory, on one of the Sudates
mountains. Although, as will be shown in the short
historical sketch, water has been in use as a curative
remedy from time immemorial, the credit of reducing
it to a system unquestionably belongs to Priessnitz.
Grafenberg is the name of the mountain on which he
resides, where his wonderful cures have been performed,
and whence his fame is carried to all parts of the civi­
lized world. Every one who has visited Grafenberg
will admit that it is no paradise, as far as comforts are
concerned; and yet, since a series of years, it has been
visited by numbers of persons in the higher ranks of
society. The patients form a most heterogeneous as­
semblage, being composed of individuals of different
countries and different stations of life, the higher grades
predominating. We there find princes, dukes, counts,
barons, 8cc. It is important for us to observe these
personages, and to make our deductions from their
presence.
The amount of evidence thus offered by persons
well calculated to form a correct judgment as to the
excellence and superiority of the Water-cure, should
22 INTRODUCTION.
not be lost upon us. We may safely infer that all
other remedies had been tried in vain; and it is
certain, that those persons visiting Grafenberg, had
the means of consulting the most experienced phy­
sicians of all countries, and in many cases have done
so, and been pronounced incurable. They renounce all
comforts to which they have been accustomed all their
lives, pass through the water ordeal, and are new bom
as it were. This speaks volumes for the Water-cure.
The blind confidence which was apt to be required by
medical men, especially in the treatment of chronic dis­
eases, will now be difficult to attain, if we view the
many cases which their skill has been unable to conquer,
and which are accumulated at Grafenberg and other
similar institutions.
I hope my medical and other readers will not run
away with the idea that there is no theory in Priess-
nitz’s doings, and that it is all chance-work. They
could not be more mistaken; and I have convinced my­
self at Grafenberg that Priessnitz has a reason for all
he does. Although, possibly, he is deficient in the art
of combining thoughts according to the adopted rules,
and wanting the power of eloquence, he nevertheless
acts upon certain and fixed principles. By theory of
disease, I understand the view of its appearances which
must occur to produce that state in an individual, which
we call disease: this must be removed, or it may lead
to dissolution: by theory of a cure, that which must
necessarily be conceived in order to comprehend the
INTRODUCTION.
bringing back a diseased part to a proper state of
health. A slight attention to Priessnitz’s practice con­
vinces us that he has formed a theory of disease, and of
the process of cure.
The following observations will, T hope, demonstrate
this. An abuse of the means of preserving life and
health often becomes a painful source of disease;—the
food we eat, our drink, the air we breathe, our clothing,
our dwellings, nay, our noblest instincts, may, if abused,
become causes of manifold diseases. Now, as every
thing that has to be taken up as a part of our body
must assume a fluid form, (into which the stomach re­
duces solids,) so also that which gives the matter for a
disease of the body must, in its gradual rise and increase,
be, above all, in connexion with the liquid part of the
body, principally the blood. The greatness and violence
of the disease will bear an exact proportion to the
quantity of morbid matter accumulated:—the illness
which breaks forth suddenly and reaches a climax,
is frequently coming on slowly and by degrees. It is
surprising enough, that the majority of mankind pay
too little attention to their bodies to take due cogni­
zance of the often highly important, though scarcely
perceptible origins of disease. By degrees inconveni­
ences and indispositions arise:—the healthy parts of
the body are still enabled to overcome momentarily
the progressing evil by perspiration, vomiting, or some­
times eruptions on the skin. And here let us par­
ticularly bear in mind, that it is often the most subtile
a s
24- i n t r o d u c t i o n .
and malignant part of the whole substance of the dis­
ease that is eliminated from the body by the skin.
Such periods may be termed crises. As a proof of this
proposition, I need only mention the sudden disappear­
ance of these eruptions—falling back upon the inner and
nobler organs, as in scarlet fever, measles, small-pox,
&c.—often becoming dangerous and of deadly conse­
quence ; and as a further corroboration, we may adduce
the happy effects produced by the sloughing away
and desquamation of skin in some pernicious maladies.
At the same time, we observe, that the kidneys and
the bowels take their part in getting rid of what is
deleterious. But it is not always that such an important
crisis takes place. A disease may sometimes take the
direction to the intestines, or an outward structure, and
here produce various local disorders which generally
have some connexion with the original disease, but
gradually assume a standing of their own. Many
sorts of humours could be mentioned as forming the
foundation for disease. Under the denomination of
gastric humours might be comprehended the founda­
tion for the so called gastric diseases, for nervous fevers,
erysipelas, scarlet fever, measles, various sorts of pocks,
gout, and other forms of disease. But, besides this,
they are distinguished according to their nature; rheu­
matic, (often connected with acidity in the stomach, and
which seem nearly allied to the gastric,) various other
gouty, hoemorrhoidal, scrofulous, scorbutic, psoric, syphi­
litic, cancerous, and drug diseases; among the latter,

mercurial ones particularly. To these may be added,
those arising from miasma or contagion, which thrive
the more, the more gastric humours the body contains,
as in the form of the cholera, and as it is seen in
yellow fever and pest. The same, however, as every
good physician would do, Priessnitz seems to search for
the natural connexion of the causes of disease, which
is fully illustrated as follows:—for instance, he will
not expect appearances showing the presence of
humours for disease in cases of great weakness, in
consequence of the immoderate loss of the fluids,
or the numerous nervous maladies, the result of ener­
vation, or in a merely local disease, as in stomach com­
plaints, chlorosis, &c.
Having thus endeavoured to show some of the chief
causes of disease, the next question is: How is the cure
to be effected ? Here we must at once acknowledge,
that it is by the free working of our natural powers that
health is recovered. We see this confirmed every day,
and daily experience proves, that this so called healing
power finds the best and safest ways to bring about a
cure; therefore all obstacles to the recovery of health
must be removed first, and the remedies applied so that
this power may choose its own means of bringing the
disease to an end. It is evident that a disease is the
more easy to be overcome, the fewer single organs, and
the slighter they are affected. We perceive that the
energy of the power that is to produce health is the
greater, the greater the number of the more important
26 INTRODUCTION.
organs untouched by disease: therefore not to dimi­
nish the strength of these organs, all that can tend
to weaken the human body must be avoided, blood­
letting, general or local, must be eschewed, for if a con­
stant generation of blood is going on, no material relief
would be afforded by the operation, and means would
have to be taken to reduce an excessive regeneration to
a proper level; but if a disease takes a simple direction,
and to single parts of the body, there are other means
of equalizing the circulation of the blood, than by
weakening the whole organism.—Cases threatening im­
mediate death are exceptions.—For the same reason
purgatives should not be given, for the quantity of
blood only can be diminished, and not its quality, upon
which every thing depends. These induce the ejection
of those superfluities which have to be ejected, and
at the proper time and place, may be useful; but se­
cretions may at the same time be expelled, of which,
at all events, we cannot always tell whether the nature
of the evil would not require them in some other direc­
tion. And after all, what avails it? A momentary
relief by means applied almost constantly (purgatives) is
of no avail in chronic maladies. Is the condition of the
bowels which caused the want of action changed ? and
does not the want of action rather increase than other­
wise by the constant use of purgatives, so much so
indeed, that the application of more powerful medica­
ments becomes necessary, and that they at last have no
effect at all ? The regulation of the bowels in chronic
INTRODUCTION. 27
disease requires great perseverance, and is attained by
the combined use of dietetic remedies, but their proper
action then becomes the surer. Everything that is still
healthy in the man, and has not succumbed to disease,
must he nourished, must be strengthened, in order to
bring back to the normal state those parts which have suf­
fered most, by a preponderance of the sound ones, or
at least to render the diseased parts harmless, and check
the encroachment on the sound. On this account the
bowels require the first attention ; the lower story is ge­
nerally the worst: it is from here that ruin spreads over
the body, but it is also here that the first step for a cure
may be made—in the place, namely, where food is di­
gested, and the blood prepared—if pure and good fluids
are distilled. Hence many necessary acts of the cure lead
upon this point, among which, the necessity of avoiding
all excitement, and commanding the passions whilst
undergoing the cure, will be manifest, as the bad effects
of indulging them to excess is at all times injurious,
and well known by everybody to be so. The great
object in effecting a cure, is to bring back, by all means
in our power, nature to its pristine state, and develope
the vital power within, so as to afford it strength to
check the encroachment of disease, and overcome it.
Here is one of the difficulties of the system. It is the
vital power which is so difficult to be discerned by an
ordinary observer, and even by many of the profession,
as there are persons who, to all appearance, seem well,
to have sound muscles, lively motion, and animated
28 INTRODUCTION.
expression of the eye, yet there may be great want of the
vital power; and on the other hand, persons who have
a thin, spare look may be possessed of a great fund of
this power, when disease, or exertion, put it to the test.
In such cases, much nicety of judgment is necessary, and
the fallacy of believing that water cannot hurt if it does
no good, is here well demonstrated: for if, as some
imagine, it is enough to drink pailsful of water, and be
wrapped in the blanket and wet sheet to effect a cure,
they misunderstand the powers of the element, a correct
knowledge of which is absolutely necessary to make use
of it with advantage. The loss of the vital power in the
former case, argues a derangement of one or more organs
of the human body, and a complication or form of irre­
gular action must exist somewhere: that complication
must be unfolded, and the irregular action repressed or
diverted into proper channels ; until this is done, success
cannot be expected. The effect of water is to brace the
system generally, and the susceptibility of impression is
much increased by its use: if, therefore, where a derange­
ment of structure has taken place, water be applied to
such structure suddenly and incautiously in large quan­
tities, the effect produced naturally will be (the moving
powers not being sufficiently balanced) to overstrain
the disorganized structure, this not being equal to the
stimulus, to increase the general derangement, and
lead to dangerous consequences.
To trace the cause of the gradual deterioration of the
vital power is not a difficult task, and we need but cast
INTRODUCTION. 29
a retrospective glance on the history of mankind to
make it clear to us.
The wants of our ancestors were few, and at all times
they were enabled to satisfy them with what their coun­
try afforded. Nature, in her bounty, has provided every
people with means for subsistence suitable to their po­
sition and the climate they inhabit. The people of the
torrid zone are provided with plants of the most volatile
and heating properties; all sorts of hot spices grow in
the hottest parts of the earth, and are wisely ordained
for their inhabitants, whose bodies, weakened by the
parching rays of the sun, require stimulants to
strengthen the nervous system, and thus render it equal
to the influences of the climate* But surely the Crea­
tor, in liis benevolence, would also have granted these
gifts to the inhabitants of the milder and colder zones,
had their nature required it. Not that the latter divi­
sions of the earth are deficient in stimulants, for here,
too, we find plenty of aromatic and ethereal produc­
tions, though of a milder species. The people of the
•west require less of strong stimulants; in their organ­
ism and in their diseases, structural derangement is
predominant, whilst in their antipodes, nervous com­
plaints rule principally; for this reason, the more cool­
ing and quieting remedies are necessary for the former.
It is, therefore, distinctly nature herself that indicates
to all sufficiently clear our nourishment and remedies.
It is man, in his vanity, believing that the produce of
the whole earth is bis, as its lord and master, and
30 INTRODUCTION.
his insatiable avarice, that brought the productions of
foreign climates,. as articles of luxury, to us, by way
of tickling the palate and heaping up treasures. The
great use, or abuse, of these articles produced the nu­
merous prevalent nervous disorders. As it was impos­
sible to check the use of these luxuries foreign to our
nature, remedies had to be found to counteract their
bad consequences, increased by these being exotics.
The fair inference is, that by avoiding an indulgence in
these extraneous matters as food, drink, &c., we shall
preserve health where it exists, prevent disease, and,
where this unfortunately has gained the ascendency,
conquer it by a simple means. Nothing can do this
more effectually than water, as the experience of late
years proves to demonstration; and I, therefore, enter­
tain sanguine hopes of its practice and gradual exten­
sion. That this will be a work of time is possible and
probable, for changes in systems cannot be made sud­
denly ; and perhaps it is as well: an effectual guard is
thus raised against unwarranted innovations. One great
object will, at all events, I hope, have been attained:—
people will not have that childish fear of taking water
for quenching their thirst and refreshing their parched
tongues; and I hope too, I may add, that medical men
will have found in water a remedy, and a more uni­
versal one, than any other for the guidance of fever,
that great assistant in the cure of many diseases.
The search for truth in the present age is uncontrol­
lable ; all propositions are inquired into, and a cause
INTRODUCTION. 31
must be found for every effect. Doubt at first rested on
every valuable experience made; no tenet so sure, no
principle so safe, no right so firm, but it was assailed by
scepticism in its most violent form; and much has been
thrown into oblivion—much upset that was not founded
in truth. Truth appears the brighter after all her strug­
gles ; and the truth of the great value of water, as I
shall endeavour to show it in the following pages, I hope
to see triumphant, and at no distant period. To see its
benefits extended must be the desire of all well-wishers
of their species. Their co-operation in my object I
need not ask; innate philanthropy will, perhaps, do
more to urge them on, than all an humble individual
like myself can say; but it is more or less in every
one’s power to add their mite to the attainment of this
object.
Candour, and an adherence to facts, have been the
stimulus in the production of this work; with candour,
I hope and trust, it will be viewed; and in now pro­
ceeding in my task, I must crave the indulgence of my
readers for all its defects, and which I hope to have an
opportunity of rectifying in a future edition.

From the Creation of the Worldto Galen. From — to 131 a .c .
W a t e r has been in use from the remotest antiquity as
a dietetic remedy. The first rite of ancient hospitality
consisted in offering water for drink, and for washing
and bathing. Moses commands the use of it for wash­
ing and cleansing the body; and we often find reference
in the Scriptures to water as possessing a Divine power.
The Egyptians and Chaldeans disputed whether the
god of fire or of water was the most powerful; and the
latter was declared victorious, as strengthening health
and curing disease. The old Persians drank nothing
but water; and with the Greeks it was an especial favour­
ite for bathing. The Spartans dipped their new-born
children into the bath; and the Macedonian women

had to bathe in cold water after child-birth. Pindar
says: apurrov pcev vbtap,—“ water is the best thing.”
The Scythians and old Romans used the cold bath,
until they became effeminate by the luxuries intro­
duced, and then made use of the warm one; to the
former, their muscular strength and prowess in battle
must be attributed. The effeminate Augustus, who was
reduced to that degree of susceptibility that a draught
of wind caused violent catarrhs, and who, at the sugges­
tion of his physicians, had his rooms covered and lined
with fur, so as to exclude the wind, was by such unna­
tural proceedings brought to the brink of the grave ; at
last he recovered his lost health upon the advice of
Antonius Musa, who prevailed on him to drink cold
water, and be washed and bathed in it. The old Ger­
mans and Gauls had holy woods and springs in which
they worshipped the deity of their health.
Pythagoras (530 b.c.) and Hippocrates, father of
medicine, (454 b. c.,) most strongly recommended the
use of cold water. The first named knew aspersions
and rubbings; with aspersions, or ablutions, he treated
spasms and diseases of the joints. He recommends the
use of water in jaundice, hypochondria, rheumatism,
palsy, tumours, cancer, gout, fever, diseases of the
lungs, &c. Herodicus, in the time of the Peloponnesian
war, (431—404,) recommended bathing with rubbing
for strengthening and maintaining health. Dionippos,
of Eos, retained only the cold drinking in fevers from
among the dietetic rules of Hippocrates; whilst the
HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE. 35
scholars of Chrysippus, of Chridos, (340,) condemned
drinking as injurious. Erasistratus, of Ceos, (340,)
waged against this prejudice. Cold bathing was in great
use at Rome; the fatigued soldiers plunged into the
Tiber. In the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, (616—578,)
bathing institutions, and some assert, also, falling baths
were formed, Asclepiades, of Prusa, (90 b. c.,) intro­
duced a new era in bathing. By his zealous championship
•
of cold bathing, he acquired the name of 'J'uxpoAovrqs,
“ cold-bather.” He also applied cold water inwardly
and outwardly in diseases; he made use of the balnete
pensilesy which probably are drops and shower-baths.
A hundred years later, Seneca mentions the suspension-
baths, the contrivances and manner of warming baths;
it was a sort of heating the air by pipes. Steam re­
duced to water was used also as a shower-bath, and
alternately cold. Almost every sort of bathing was in
use, but the application of cold wras by degrees quite
done away with, until the fore-mentioned Musa re­
established the fame of cold water. This physician also
made use of cold plunging-baths, and cured Horace by
them. His brother Euphorus, physician to the Nu-
midian king, followed his example. The scholar of
Asclepiades, Themison, (50 b.c.,) also spoke in praise of
the effect of cold water. His follower, Eudemus, re­
commended cold water clysters in pains of the stomach.
Celsus particularly (23 a. c.) recommended cold water
as a dietetic and therapeutic remedy against flatulency,
giddiness, catarrh, swollen glands, weakness of the

stomach, pains in the joints, hot fever, jaundice, drowsi­
ness, diseases of the lungs, cholera, dysentery, diarrhoea,
gout, hydrophobia, &c., &c. Its application as a beve­
rage, washing, bath, ablution, and aspersion is known to
him. The then progressing Christianity sanctioned the
use of river-baths by baptism. Cold batlis were even
allowed in winter by Charmis, of Massilia; and Seneca,
the philosopher, used them at this time of the year
with enthusiasm. Agathinus (80 a. c.) declares warm
baths to be weakening, and praises cold ones, with rub­
bings and douche, even with children. His scholar,
Archigenes, (100 a. c.,) the pathologian, and celebrated
by first dividing mineral waters according to their ingre­
dients, also praises cold water. Arctaeus, (60 a. c.,) the
greatest physician between Hippocrates and Galen,
made use of it in inflammations of the brain ; and recom­
mends swimming and cold ablutions for head-aches and
giddiness. Socanus (100) recommends cold bathing in
complaints of the chest, asthma, weakness, and gout.
Herodotus (117) complains of the neglect of cold
bathing at Rome. But cold water would have been
quite thrown into oblivion with the progress of de­
bauchery and effemination, had not Galen, (131—200,)
the founder of allopathy, applied both cold and warm
water in his practice. He ordered warm ablutions and
douching at the springs;—also cold baths, nay, even
immersions into cold after the warm ones, and even re­
commended plunging baths for consumption.

SECTION II.
From Galen to the Arabs. 131 a . c. to 900.
T h e field of science lay long neglected after Galen.
All we find is, that Antryllus (200) was not unfriendly
to the use of cold water, and applied sea-water in
eruptions of the skin. Caelius Aurelianus (210) liked
cold plunging baths; in madness, cold ablutions; in
mannings, cold aspersions with salt or sea-water, or
plunging baths in common water; ablutions in dropsy
and diseases of the bladder; cold fomentations in hae­
morrhage, overflowing of the menses, bleeding piles, and
particularly cold water in inflammation of the brain,
head-ache, gout, jaundice, and many other maladies.
jEtius (543) employed cold water in fevers, irregular
menstruation, madness, &c. Alexander, of Trelles,
(570,) used it in bilious complaints and gout. Paul, of
jEgina, (670,) in diseases of the eye, colic, &c. About
or after this period medical systems and processes of
cure became more artificial, and the simple observance
of nature was abandoned.
Such was the Water-cure in past ages, when water
was used as a dietetic and therapeutic remedy, but with­
out any scientific knowledge. We now come to the
Second Period.

of nature.
SECTION I.
From the A ra b s to F loyer. 900 to 1650.
T h e Arabs, who endeavoured to enrich chemistry and
pharmacy, also endeavoured to introduce new remedies,
and to restrain the use of water most anxiously. Yet,
Rhazes (923) praises cold water in weakness of the
stomach ; in measles and pox, cold water as drink, and
vapour baths; in fever, cold water; bleeding of the
nose, cold washings and ablutions of the head. Avi­
cenna (1036) knows cold baths and their use in vomit­
ing, nausea, and diarrhoea, but recommends great cau­
tion in their use, according to age, constitution, and
season. He praises aspersions for fainting fits, asthma,
fever, and knows its use as injection. By degrees, how­
ever, the mass of drugs caused cold water to fall into
disuse.
Let us bear in mind the great influence which the
HISTORY OP THE WATER-CURE. 39
progressing culture of the human race, and of the
sciences particularly, had in the therapeutic science.
As long as the other sciences progressed, physics shared
their activity; but when the former began to sink into
darkness,—when religion was supplanted by superstition,
philosophy by sophistry and cunning,—when despotism
became right,—the medical science could not fail to fall
too, and its representatives were but hireling slaves in
the persons of the monks,—its arena, their cloisters.
But when religion, philosophy, and tyrannized right
burst the fetters which had held them too long, medi­
cine too raised its head; schools and universities arose,
but the use of cold water remained excluded; and even
in the religious baptismal rite, the practice of dipping
the body under water was by an ecclesiastical order
(1287) discontinued, and a mere sprinkling of the head
substituted. The leprosy, which broke out during the
time of the crusades, caused the introduction of warm
baths and the rise of the so-called bathers, (an inferior
class of doctors,) who kept bath establishments and rooms
for the poor. Sweating was resorted to, but cold
water eschewed. Only warm baths were in vogue.
Genlis de Foligno, who laid great stress on diet, (1348,)
yet found many sophisticated arguments against the use
of cold baths; he, nevertheless, recommended cold as­
persions in cases of great debility. At this time arose
the use of mineral springs. In Italy, douches were
erected. Savanarola employed cold water: in menorr­
hagia, inflammations, cold baths; local ones, in weakness

of the eyes; and even cured gout by cold aspersions.
Barzize praises cold washings after tepid baths, as
strengthening; the rising douche in diseases of the
womb ; Cardanus, (1501—1576,) cold ablutions for gout,
without swellings of the joints. Femelius (1558) knew
the cooling effect and warming reaction of baths, and
recommended them in cases of consumption. On the one
hand, science enlightened those times; superstition,
alchemy, astrology, and chiromancy counteracted these
good effects, until the discovery of the art of printing,
and of America, dispelled the darkness. Paracelsus,
(1517,) bom near Zurich, in Switzerland, stemmed the
spirit for imitating the'Greeks and Arabs, and, basing
his theory on physiology and practice in the natural
healing power, led to study and observation. Although
there was much sophistry in his system, he was much in
advance of the times he lived in, and made use of every­
thing to establish a new structure. He wrote no work
on the Water-cure, but recommended its use strongly
for drinking and dipping, in hydrophobia. Douches and
mineral baths were now much sought after. Thur-
neyssen, (1530—1596,) who gave the first intelligence to
Europe of the medicinal springs, recommended, in ser­
vile imitation of Paracelsus, the use of mineral baths,
despising fresh water; but other physicians of the time
praised the latter. G. Ryff, Strasburg, (1544,) and
Bartholomew Viotti, of Clivola, (1550,) spoke in
praise of drop baths for weakness in the head. Ugulius
de Monte Catino (1553) prescribed plunging baths.
HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE. 41
Amatus Lucitanus recommended it in hot bilious fevers,
cholera, inflammation of the bowels and breasts, cancers,
and tumours. Andreas Baccius (1588) substitutes ab­
lutions for baths in inflammation of the brain. Gunther,
of Andernach, (1574,) eulogises ablutions of the skin, to
promote evacuations and sound sleep, and complains of
the neglect of baths. Physicians had been compelled to
abandon these in consequence of the mineral springs,—
the search after panaceas and charms,—and the intro­
duction of other remedies, such as Ipecacuanha, &c.;
but chiefly in consequence of the general spreading
of venereal disease, which was attributed to the promis­
cuous bathing of the sexes. For this reason Mercurialis
(1530—1606) used medicated ablutions. J. Bohinus
(1541—1613) sulphur springs; also douches and vapour
baths. J. C. Claudinus (1619) opposed the use of cold
fluids, as tending to check the inner warmth : indeed,
Daniel Lennert (1572—1632) poured tepid milk on
hectic subjects. There were individuals, however, who
praised cold water, as J. Lamzwerde, (1608.) Henricus
ab Hiers, at the same period, cured leprosy with cold
plunging baths. The learned Alpinius supported the
dietetic use of cold water, describes the Egyptian Nile
baths, and names the diseases in which cold baths are
to be used. Septata (1638) recommends cold douches
and drop baths in siriasis, head-aches, cold water drink­
ing for diarrhoea; compresses, in colic. He recommends
cold as stopping haemorrhage. Fabricius Hildanus
(1560—1634) speaks highly of cold water for the frost-
42 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
bitten, but warns against its sudden use after being
heated. Yander Heyden (1643) calls cold water a bless­
ing from God, for rich and poor, and sets its value
above all other medicaments. For the frost-bitten, for
madness, maimings, megrim, hoarseness, constipation, and
diarrhoea, he praises i t ; and in a dysentery which broke
out, he cured 360 patients with it. Severinus (1580—
1656) and Sylvaticus (1575—1656) praise drop baths.
Diemerbrock (1665) relates a case of a person curing
himself of a diarrhoea with cold water. Rolfinecius
praises cold ablutions in chronic head-aches; yet there
always existed prejudices against it. Ettmuller (1611
— 1683) only allows cold baths in desperate cases, as in
hydrophobia. In spite of the reigning opinions of the
thickening of the blood, they never thought of diluting
it with water, but rather took to tea, it having become
a fashionable beverage. Vittel (1678) mentions a cold
spring in York, famed for curing rickets, gout, cramp,
&c. The Dane, Bartholin, (1680,) recommends rubbing
with snow against pest, hot fever, pulmonary consump­
tion, colic, constipation, gout, inflammation, &c. Hel-
mont, (1644,) who calls water the origin of everything,
recommends its use as a dietetic remedy, and dipping in
cold water in mental diseases; his son, F. van Helmont,
likewise recommends it.
A better knowledge of the use of cold water is dif­
fused in the next century, even with non-medical men,
and a new era commences with Floyer.
HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE. 43
SECTION II.
From Floyer to Hahn. 1650 to 1780.
As times progressed, as the sciences and liberty of
thought advanced, prejudices gradually disappeared;
and among them, the prejudice against cold water.
Our countryman, Floyer, victoriously won the field,
which had been struggled for step by step. What
Guidot (1691) commenced by the introduction of pumps
and baths; Robertson by cold baths and immersions;
Lock (1704) by the recommendation of drinking, wash­
ing, bathing, and swimming, Floyer achieved by his
Psychrolusia, wliich passed through six editions in Lon­
don in a short time. He recommends cold baths, de­
scribes their effects, and mentions the diseases in which
they are to be used. His opponents he challenges to
examination and observation. Among the diseases in
which he recommends the use of cold water are tooth­
ache, inflammation of the brain and throat, piles, gout,
chlorosis, &c. Being successful, he found many friends
and imitators. Brown, Blair, and others saw good
results; Blair in cold falling baths for delirium, mann­
ings, &c.; Bayonard for rickets. Fuller, Smith, (1724,)
and Hancock (1722) praise it in fevers and pest.
George Cheyne (1671—1748) complains (1725) of the
neglect of baths, which he considers as necessary in a
house as table and bed-room, considering their beneficial
effects on the nervous and blood systems. Richard Mead
(1673—1751) advises cold baths in madness, maimings,
44 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
St. Vitus’ dance, and hydrophobia. Huxham, (1768,)
scholar of Boerhaave, calls the strengthening effects of
water wonderful, and particularly recommends it against
consumption. Thomas Short (1750) praises cold baths
in dropsy and bites of mad dogs.
Very slowly did the prejudices against water disap­
pear among the people and the profession. Even more
than Floyer, Lucas recommends water as an universal
remedy, and accessible to all parties under restrictions,
particularly in hot and chronic diseases. Buchan (1729
—1805) effected much good by recommending strongly
the use of cold baths for children. Boerhaave had pretty
correct notions of the use of cold water; he employed it
principally in mannings and desperate cases; cold wash­
ings in inflammations of the eyes; and recommends im­
mersion in hydrophobia. There was a time, in Italy,
when cold water was used to a great extent, through the
Capuchin monk, Bernardo, of Sicily, a scholar of the
great Rovida, (1724.) He used iced water for drinking,
in quantities of three to four quarts a-day, and as injec­
tions and fomentations. Crises by the skin, urine, or
stool, were his chief object. Nicola Crescenzo (1727)
praised a more simple treatment, and blames the faculty
for not adopting it. He and Dalli (1727) used it most
internally; as baths, seldom. Lancisius (1654—1720)
knows cold baths and douches as preventives of spasm.
Todano and Sengez would cure everything with cold
water; nay, they drove it to a pitch of cruelty. Cold
water was not enough; it must be mixed with ice and

snow, and every invalid must drink five pints every three
hours. If they shivered with cold, they must not be
covered, for frost is a part of the cure, as also hunger;
the patients being only allowed two to four yolks of eggs
daily. If the invalid could not stand the cold, cold wet
compresses were to be put over the liver and the hips.
Drowsiness, and such like, mattered not; sprinkle iced
water on the face, put snow on the hands and feet, cold
compresses on the head and other painful parts. Child­
bearing women were as little an exceptiou as children,
&c. “ There is nothing new under the sun.” Sengez
ordered the patient suffering from burning fever to be
laid into a double sheet, hung up by the four corners, to
be covered with snow up to the mouth, and shaken
until perspiration broke out. Now the application of
cold water was most extensive; but by its abuse, its
benefits were lost sight of, and it called forth rancorous
opposition. Yet there were always voices raised for
truth, recommending the golden middle line. Miclie-
lotti (1740) used the falling baths cautiously. Cirillo
and Sarcone (1764) prescribed the cautious use of iced
and snow water in a malignant epidemic which broke
out in Naples, as also cold baths and compresses. An­
tonio Cocchi (1695—1758) knew falling baths, and re­
commended them in chronic blennorrhoea, and cold baths
as more useful and better than mineral douches. The
French quack, Barbereau, sold at a high price sealed
bottles, containing common water, under the name of
the eternal fountain. It was discovered; but the use of
46 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
common water was acknowledged, which Hoguet (1707;
confirms. Geoffrey (1721) put this question to the
Parisian Medical College: whether cold water be a
preservative against infection ? The answer was affirma­
tive. He thinks it useful in all diseases, variously ap­
plied ; and states its defect to be, that it is generally
known and little regarded. Noguez (1735) praises cold
baths in rheumatism, pleurisy, constipation, gout, epi­
lepsy, and diseases of the chest. Chirac (1735) makes
a great stir with his Water-cures; Barrere, (1755,)
cold aspersions in lock-jaw. Le Dran had douches
erected. At that time, several prize essays were made
on the applications of cold water. Raymond, of Mar­
seilles, (1755,) was a successful candidate. The* cele­
brated and popular Tissot eulogizes cold baths in ner­
vous complaints and suppressed perspiration; he even
thinks cold washing and immersion beneficial for little
children. It was he that made cold baths fashionable in
Paris. Pomme urges cold as baths, foot-baths, and in­
jections in diseases of women; and was the origina­
tor of a better and more cooling treatment in chronic
nervous complaints. We now find the first floating
baths, with drop and pumping baths on the Seine,
erected by Pailerin in 1760. Much information as to
the utility of douches is contained in the prize essay of
Marteau. He distinguished these from drop baths,
searches into the temperature of the baths, praises
douches in idiopathic epilepsy, hysteria, drowsiness, loss
of memory, mannings, apoplexy, chronic rheumatism;
HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE. 47
discountenances them in gout; recommends cold baths
in madness, dropsy, spitting of blood, haemorrhage,
erysipelas, &c. Children he has bathed a few days after
birth. Nor were the northern nations deficient in a
knowledge of the virtues of water. In the year 1688,
we find many soldiers and sailors plunging into the Baltic
whilst in a delirious state; and their subsequent cure is
commented on by Unsenius. Pechlin (1646—1706)
relates the same thing. Carl, a Danish court physician,
(1747,) acknowledged the use of cold water. Clemens
Fade (1736—1808) endeavoured to introduce drop
baths into Copenhagen for dietetic application. The
Swede, Bergius, (1763,) wrote on the subject of cold
baths as beneficial in many maladies. In Poland, the
court physician, Moneta, (1729—1792,) employed cold
water in catarrh, cough, sore throat, &c.
The use of water was gradually spread in Germany.
Bergen (1658—1736) called the attention of the Ger­
mans to the cold baths in England. Wolfert speaks of
the cold eye-douche, and drop bath for the ears, esta­
blished at Hofgeisnar. Vitus Rudlin, of Ulm, very
cleverly set forth its advantages and disadvantages.
Wedel, of Jena, (1721,) brought method into the use of
the various baths. Krause, of Jena, also (1718) praises
cold water for drinking, and Fisher in the rickets.
Hoffman, the celebrated and successful physician, is a
warm eulogiser of cold water ; baths in diseases arising
from too active a circulation of the blood; drinking in
hot fever, cholera, diarrhoea, colic, spasm in the stomach,
48 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
hypochondriasis, hysteria, gout, haemorrhage, &c. In
nervous diseases and hypochondriasis, he prefers tepid
baths. He is, however, a friend to falling baths. Pro­
fessor Schulze in Halle praises cold water, but has some
prejudices against it. Scliwertner in Jauer has edited
a collection of German, French and English writings on
the subject. Van Swieten, (1699—1722,) scholar of Boer-
haave, praises cold falling baths and immersions in maim-
ings. Beer (1748) calls water the most natural, complete,
and approved medicinal remedy, but does not speak of
it as a beverage. Kruger in Halle calls it an universal
remedy. Daniel (1771) recommends cold baths and
compresses in hot fevers, madness, weakness of the
joints, involuntary emissions, &c. Danter (1784) speaks
of its manifold advantages as injection in diseases of
the womb. In the poetical maxims of the life of
Triller of Wittemberg, water is highly lauded. Leutli-
ner cured many chronic nervous complaints, hypochon­
driasis and hysteria by cold baths, ablutions, fomenta­
tions, and injections; Pietsch, (1773,) gout, by dipping
hands and feet into cold water. Unzer (1727—1799)
urges the use of cold baths, cold ablutions in siriasis;
in constipation, cold foot baths and aspersions of the
upper hips with iced water. But the most important
writer of the time is J. S. Hahn, (1696—1773,) who
indeed established a sort of Water-cure, using it for all
diseases, but he also employs other remedies. In the
year 1742, his father, Dr. S. Hahn, in Schwicdnitz,
Silesia, a great worshipper of cold water, had cured his
HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE. 49
eldest son, J. G. Hahn, of a most dangerous epidemic.
The Junior edited a work “ On the Power and Effect
of Cold Water,” which passed through four editions from
1783 to 1784. He recommends washing in small pox
and eruptions of the skin, falling baths in inflammation of
the brain, douches in maimings, cold injections in diar­
rhoea, foot baths in old and incurable injuries, injections
into the nostrils for colds, into the ears for deafness, and
he particularly urges its use in chronic diseases, and is
zealous in his endeavours against the use of warm baths
and other prejudices.
Surgery, too, now attained better cures by cold water;
Schmucker (1786) and Hahn’s scholar, Theden, con­
tributed much to this.
ON THE APPLICATION OF COLD WATER IN SURGERY.
It was Ambroise Pare (1509—1590) who discovered
the best balsam for wounds in fresh water, and cultivated
the natural method, after its well known use in surgery
before Celsus, Hippocrates, and others, had been lost
sight of amid the numerous artificial remedies. The
superstition of the times ascribed the healing virtue to
the fanatical conjurations, and forgot the water; for
which reason Biondi’s writings, (1510,) and even the
authority of Fallopius (1523—1563) were insufficient.
Pallatius (about 1540) succeeded in convincing himself
of the use of common water, and urged its introduc-

50 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
tion. The disputes of Joubert, (1529—1582,) the
friend of water, and his opponent Martels, tended to
call forth grounds and proofs of its beneficial effects.
The cloud of superstition still hung heavily on those
times, when the happy cure of the Duke of Orleans by
Chirac, induced Lamorier (1730) in France, Sancussain,
(1659—1737,) Benevoli, (1685—1756,) and Caldoni,
(1724—1813,) in Italy, to open new channels for the
use of water. The German surgeons, Heister (1682—
1758) and Platner, (1694—1747,) used water with vine­
gar. Geisler (1746) employed drop baths in diseases of
the joints. But it was principally Schmucker (1712—
1786) in wounds of the head, and Theden (1714—1797)
who secured much extension to the use of cold water
in surgery. A miller had effected some wonderful
cures by water, and Lombard (1741—1811) and Percy
(1754—1825) learned it from him. Larrey, under
Napoleon, saw the finest effects of cold water in Egypt.
Kern, in Vienna, greatly assisted in the extension of the
use of cold water in surgery. The discussion between
Kern, Walther, and the French, as to who had the
merit of first introducing it in surgery, tended greatly
to its more general use. Hahneman, Richter, Zeller,
Frumpf, Dzondi, Georgi, Sarenbach, Rust, and many
other surgeons, have the merit of increasing its use in
surgery. Among the productions of later times, the
writings of Josse (French, 1835) should be mentioned.

LATER TIMES.—CULTIVATION OP THE WATER-CURE.
From Hahn down to the Present Times.
la later times, so rich in revolutions and innovations in science, water
also acquired muchattention, and it was asserted by some of the continental
non-medical men to be a universal and only dietetic and curative remedy.
This, however, went on with a spirit of destruction of every thing else,
without scientific or intellectual bounds ; so that, resisted to the utmost
by the profession, it would have been nearly thrown into oblivion, had not
a countryman met with the most happy results by his system, which is
approaching a scientific foundation and the greatest perfection. This
period, therefore, falls into two Sections, of which the first is a prepar­
ation for the second.
SECTION I.
From Hahn to Oertel. 1780 to 1826.
A l t h o u g h the Germans were great water-drinkers, the
other applications of this element were less liked; and
Hahn’s writings, devoid of scientific principles, met with
little approbation from the faculty, who at the same
time avoided all examination and observation which
might have enabled them to form a securer basis.
The merit of extending the use of water is here again
attributable to our own country. Dr. Wright (1777)
caught a dangerous fever from a sailor, who refused to
i> 2
52 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
take any remedy, and died on the eighth day of his
disease. Dr. W., after trying several remedies, deter­
mined on the Water-cure. He undressed, and with a
cloak round him went on the deck of his vessel, threw off
his cloak,—had three pailsful of sea water thrown over
his head, and after one or two fluctuations, by repeating
this bath several times, quite recovered. In 1779 he
communicated a report of his proceedings to the London
Medical Journal; he was very successful in Edinburgh
with his method, and declared cold ablutions to be the
best preservative against hot fevers. Contemporary with
Brandreth, Dr. Currie (1750—1805) made his first
trials with water in a contagious fever which broke out
at Liverpool. He succeeded to admiration, and published
his views and experience on the subject in 1801, together
with a list of 153 cures from among the great number
he effected. Gerard (1796) recommends cold ablutions
in scarlet fever; also in maimings, madness ; half-baths
in spitting of blood; cold baths in fits. Dr. Currie
made a regular system of the indications in fever and
inflammation. Gregory, Falcon, Dimsdale, Hume,
Marshall, and many others followed in the use of cold
water. Dr. Jackson was a great advocate for the use of
water in all sorts of fevers, and practised the water
treatment with great success. He chiefly used sea
water, and thus the most malignant contagion was often
obviated. Bateman recommended water in scarlet and
typhus fevers. Santer in acute rheumatism used cold
fomentations, and Dr. Armstrong in scarlet fever. In
HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE. 53
Germany, Muller had made some experiments in Minden,
and Brandis in Kiel, (1786;) the result caused water to
be more used, and Currie’s book, translated by Michaelis,
contributed to this. Muller used washings and ablutions
in measles; Brandis, ablutions in typhus, immersions in
hectic, and cold ablutions in chest diseases. He recom­
mended plunging baths in summer and Russian baths in
winter for rheumatism, and was one of the first to apply
cold for cholera. Currie’s method of treating scarlet
fever was imitated by Marman; and Frank (1803)
introduced the cooling plan into the Vienna hospitals.
Hubertus, in Vienna, (1804,) ordered cold washings in
scarlet fever and measles. Much credit is due to Dr.
Colbany, of Presburg, who stood alone in his profession
and incurred their enmity, but who suffered no consider­
ation to stand in the way of achieving good. He did
effect a great deal of good by his numberless cures of
scarlet fever, and thus earned the reward of perseverance;
he also employed ablutions in typhus and eruptions.
Frohlich (1810) followed in bilious, nervous, and scarlet
fevers. In an epidemic typhus fever which broke out
in Goldkranach, Hirsch saved sixty-four persons by the
water treatment.
Not to tire our readers with the mention of more
names, we will proceed to the great Hufeland, who
strenuously urged river baths to be used, and who, in
energetic language, attributed the effemination of the
present race to the neglect of them. Dr. Welper had
a floating bath erected in 1801 at Berlin, with douche
54 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
and shower-baths. Sea-bathing now got into great
repute for constipations, rheumatism, irregular menses,
and in sensitive nervous systems, &c. Kathlor and
Geriz searched into the effects of cold water on healthy
bodies; and a bathing chair was invented by Weidlich
for the application of clysters and injections into the
cavities of the abdomen. The typhus of 1813, and later
the cholera particularly, brought cold water into great
use. Dr. Milius, in Cronstadt, saved numberless typhus
patients without any medicine. His plan was this:—
his patients were wrapped in a sheet, dipped three or
four times into a tub filled with river water, had cold
water poured over their heads, — then taken out of
the sheet and put into bed wrapped in dry blankets. He
also applied this with happy effect in chronic nervous
diseases, madness,' hypochondriasis, and depression of
spirits. Hufeland approves of the cooling treatment in
this epidemic, but warns against unconditional cold
ablutions, for which he lays down rules. Goden, of
Gumbinnen, decidedly praises cold ablutions, distinguish­
ing the forms of typhus for which they are more favour­
able. Horn, too, contributed much to the cultivation
of this method. Reuss, of Aschaffenburg, employed
cold in various forms, in typhus and also in measles,
small-pox, scarlet and other fevers. Greiner, in Eisen-
berg, saw beautiful results from cold ablutions, particu­
larly in the second stage of typhus. Hartman (1813)
proved that cold was the best destructor of contagion.
Wedekind, Marcus, Dzondi, Lobenstein, Hodel, and
HISTORY OP THE WATER-CURE. 55
other Germans used cold water with the best results in
typhus fevers, and many more communicated the happy
results of their experience.
The Hufeland Medical Society prize question, on the
outward application of cold water, and which was well
answered by Reuss, Rittschaft, and Frohlich, (the latter
obtaining the prize,) shows the importance attached to
the method. By the manifold applications of cold water
the most happy cures of many diseases were effected.
The douche, used by Dupay, Sedillot, Steinmetz, Haas,
W etzler; the shower-bath, by Kurz, Hayfelder, Sun-
derlin, in a dietetic way; and by Hufeland, Rust, Kluge,
Barez, in Berlin; Clarus, Iorg, Haase, in Leipzig; and
Vogel, in Rostock, in a therapeutic manner, and the
vapour-baths, acquired more and more friends.
Falling baths in their various modifications have been
pronounced indispensable by Esquirol, Graves, Schneider,
Bird, Heinroth, and fixed indications have been made
for their use; but by far the greatest impulse to the
general use of cold water was given by Professor Oertel,
of Ausbach; and although in his enthusiasm he has been
led to a great many exaggerations as to the effect, and
in his desire to appear a great reformer seemed to have
wished to upset all existing theories and systems, he has
unquestionably the great merit of having spread the
knowledge of the use of water by his own extensive
observations of its good effects, in a dietetic and also
therapeutic view, and by his numerous popular writings
on the subject.
56 HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE.
SECTION II.
From Ocrtel to Priessnitz and Latest Times.
T h e precept of Oertel spread rapidly over the Conti­
nent, partly by the truth it contained, partly by the
seeming easy facility of application, and partly by the
peculiar manner of giving it publicity. The water
method assumed the appearance of a proper system, and
an extent it had never reached before. The motto was,
(t Drink water in abundance; the more the better: for
it prevents and cures all evils." Contradictions, slanders,
eulogies, and real true experience were mixed helter
skelter. Societies were formed in Germany, who em­
ployed water dietetically and medicinally; water cures
were spoken of on all sides, applied at random without
distinction and without reason, and the mania would
have exhausted itself, had not the unassuming Vincent
Priessnitz become known. Through Priessnitz, a plain
man, who had tried the curative effects of cold water on
himself, and on many thousands since, the Water-cure
will be handed down to posterity. Without medical,
anatomical, or physiological knowledge, he has applied
cold water most rationally. He has formed a pathology
of his own, (humoural pathology;) his ideas as to the
structure of the human body are his own also; and he
saw his theory justified in the result of the appearances,
during the course of his cures. The subject is so
important that we must devote another article to it, to
HISTORY OF THE WATER-CURE. 57
which we refer the reader. Accordingly, under the
head of Vincent Priessnitz he will find more remarks
regarding this, I fain must say, wonderful man; and
may I be permitted to direct the attention of my medical
readers to it likewise ? May I entreat and urgently
implore them not to blind themselves to facts, but grant
the subject that attention to which it is so justly entitled,
for the sake of science and suffering humanity ? It
should be their duty to observe and search into the
various effects of water, with the view of improving and
perfecting the system; and the many difficulties should
but form a fresh stimulus. It is no discredit that
Priessnitz, the humble peasant, be their prototype here,
for bravely and fearlessly did he combat and overcome
all obstacles.
Much has to be pruned until the fruit can ripen and
attain to maturity : and much prejudice and misunder­
standing has to be mastered before the Water-cure can
become—what in the course of time it cannot fail to—a
blessing to mankind.
PART II.
PRIESSKITZ AND GRAFENBERG.
SECTION I.
Vincent Priessnitz.
I n the preceding Part we briefly alluded to this extra­
ordinary man, and now proceed to give a few more par­
ticulars of him. The place of his birth was Grafen-
berg, and his parents humble peasants, whose small
estate he was early called upon to manage; his father
having been struck with blindness, and thereby incapa­
citated from attending to the necessary duties. Tem­
perately inclined, he was not long in discovering the
virtues of the pure spring water which abounds in the
neighbouring woods and mountains, as the best restora­
tive after the many fatigues incident to a country life
such as his; and the great spirit of observation with
which he is naturally gifted, soon led him to discover
its more valuable properties in healing. The first
stimulus, I am authentically informed, which Priessnitz
had, was through a man who was in the habit of visit­
ing his father’s house from the neighbouring little
place, Ludwigsthal, and whose business, iron and wire
VINCENT PRIESSNITZ. 59
working, often caused him to get scratches and wounds
in his hands and feet, which he cured by washing the
parts well with cold water, and then putting linen
rags dipped in water on them. This could not escape
Priessnitz’s penetrating eye, and he practised similar
means in healing the bruises his people and the neigh­
bouring peasantry got in the course of their laborious
occupations.—When still a youth, he had the mis­
fortune to break two of his ribs by a fall from a
wagon. The surgeons in the nearest small town, Frei-
waldau, could do nothing for him : Priessnitz, confident
that if he could but replace the bones, the rest would be
an easy matter to readjust by the agency of water, left
no means untried to effect his purpose, and at last
succeeded, after many and painful attempts. He had
now passed the climax of his sufferings; he assuaged
the violent pain by putting cold water compresses on
the injured part, and, aided by an undiminished natural
healing power, he was soon quite restored to health and
his wonted employment. This successful operation and
brilliant cure established his fame in the neighbour­
hood, and he was looked upon as Nature’s doctor. The
gift of discovering disease, and of judging correctly of
the condition of the vital power in individuals, founded
on a correct view of organic changes, seems to have
been a gift of Heaven to this humble countryman.
True, it is extraordinary; yet, in rebus nature, to the
one, it is given to call forth the full harmony of sounds,
a mystery to others, and an enigma to himself; to
60 VINCENT FfUESSNITZ.
another, untaught, to answer the most abstruse scientific
questions; as, among later instances, the case of Vito
Mangiameli, who, yet a boy and unschooled, solves ma­
thematical problems without mechanical aid, upon prin­
ciples of which he is himself not conscious* Thus
Nature stamped Priessnitz a man of genius: her ways
are wonderful. Man in liis arrogance forgets Nature,
swerves more and more from her, and becoming intoxi­
cated with the success of artificial discoveries, he
forgets the innate and original impulse, or scorns to ac­
knowledge it.—As a punishment, Nature often chooses
her own means of revenge, and shows the wonders she
can effect, unaided by the studies and researches of
vain-glorious man.
But Priessnitz would never have become what he is
—the wonder of all Europe—had he not been possessed
of much energy and spirit, together with great presence
of mind, another of his characteristic qualifications,
and a very essential one* He has acquired the confi­
dence of all seeking his aid, by the numerous cures he
has effected, by the success and truth of his prognosti­
cations, and the firmness and calmness of his demeanour.
All these things combined inspire an invalid to exercise
patience and courage in the carrying out of the appa­
rently somewhat rigorous cure. The obstacles he had
to contend with were numerous. His success caused
the envious doctors in the town of Freiw'aldau to
oppose him by all means in their power. They de­
nounced him to the local authorities as an empiric,
VINCENT PRIESSNITZ. G1
practising the healing art without license, so that these
were compelled, according to the letter of the law, to
impose a heavy fine on him. Priessnitz, nothing
daunted, appealed against this sentence: the penalty
was set aside, and the Austrian government, in its
anxious care for the health of its subjects, sent a com­
mission of inquiry to Grafenberg, among which were
eminent medical men. The result of this investigation
was all Priessnitz could desire: he was allowed to build
an establishment and continue his practice, the com­
mission having convinced themselves of the good effects
of his system. Thus good came out of evil, as is often
the case. The overcoming of obstacles thrown in his
way but tended to inspire him with increased courage;
the difficulties, to urge him to greater exertion; the doubts
raised against him, to redouble his attention; and the in­
creasing number of his opponents, to raise the importance
of his cause in his own eyes. Priessnitz and his institu­
tion, perhaps, would never have become what they are,
but for the steeling power of opposition., He observed,
studied, and improved his method, and from the treat­
ment of outward ailments with which he commenced, he
gradually proceeded to internal and more dangerous
diseases. Priessnitz’s natural spirit of inquiry became
manifest; from the deductions and inferences he made
during a long and abundant practice, he gradually pro­
gressed to the manifold applications of water, and to the
compresses, which, according to the degree of wet they
contained, and the time of application, were divided
62 VINCENT PRIESSNITZ.
into anti-inflammatory, warming, soothing, &c. He
found that this simple remedy could act in a twofold and
quite opposite manner, and acquired the knowledge of
using them among the other numerous applications with
a high degree of skill, tact and advantage. By his long
experience he formed a theory of his own, founded on
the appearances and effects of diseases he had previously
treated, and maintains that he is able to cure all diseases
by the simple and various applications of water, which
medical men declare curable by the aid of drugs; and he
is right; nay sometimes, cases which have been given
up by the faculty, are cured by the Water-cure. There
are, however, cases which he will not undertake at all;
where organic malformations exist, where the individual
has been long and plentifully treated with iodine and
mercurial preparations, and some few others; for ex­
perience has taught him that the Water-cure would be
' without result, where those medicines had been long in
the system, as they quite destroy the activity of the
glands, particularly those of the abdomen.
According to his view, the cause of disease lies in an
alteration, corruption and stagnation of the secretions.
It cannot be expected that an uneducated man, who
docs not possess a notion of the knowledge and aids of
the learned in the developement of such an idea, can
give a scientific explanation of the correctness of his
views; yet he is justified in his opinions by the results
of his treatment. In performing his cures, his object
is to diminish and regulate the too violent acting and
VINCENT PRIESSNITZ. 63
exertions of the natural healing power in inflammatory
diseases; and to excite it, on the other hand, to more
stimulating action in chronic affections, and thus remove
the complaint. He has a method of his own of examin­
ing his patients, and it is in the strictest harmony with
the individual application of his subsequent cure; he
observes the whole person of the invalid, his demeanour,
his movements, his looks, and his voice, all of which tell
many a tale to a practised eye,—the more so, if the
life of the individual has been moved by various pas­
sions. He listens attentively to the story of his patient,
and if it is very long, sometimes forgets the beginning
before it is completed; as the Spartans of yore in an
oration of the ambassadors from Mycena: occasionally
asks a question or two, frequently none at all; at the
tongue he never looks, and the pulse he never feels.
The most important guide for him, however, is his view
at the first bath of his patients, which he invariably
attends, and draws vast advantages there; he can at once
form an opinion of the extent of disease and suffering,
and of the state of bodily energy, which contributes
much to the correct view of the disease, and an approxi­
mate prognostication of recovery. The part which has
suffered most, the remains of former disease and treat­
ment, are easily discovered ; as also defects forgotten to
be named, or from a false sense of shame intentionally
omitted by the patient. Another highly important
point, having reference to the sweating process peculiar
to Priessnitz’s system, must be added. The skin, one of
VINCENT PRIESSNITZ.
64*
the most important organs of the body, the true func­
tions of which are so little known ’
and less attended to,
suffers material alterations in its colours, thickness, elas­
ticity, its peculiar glossy appearance, capacity to bear
warmth and to perspire, apart from the diseased forma­
tions on the same, and which are classed under the name
of eruptions. What a number of various shades of
colour do we behold; from the milk-white of some
hectic subjects, to the wanness of others; the yellow of
the icterical, to the yellow greenish of the so called
black jaundice: how( different also according to the
parts of the body. How dry and brittle, full of chinks,
gaps and crevices, parched in appearance and rough to
the touch, is many a skin: how relaxed with some, com­
pact and firm in others. To all this must be added the
degree in which the skin takes the water, whether it is
wetted by the element equally, or whether it cleaves to
the surface in drops on account of its greasiness* It
strikes me that with all this, Priessnitz substitutes
amply for what might escape him by his not examining
the tongue and the pulse, were he acquainted with our
method and knowledge. As a guide for a more pro­
found knowledge of the exact state of the disease, we
must add the first effects of the cure, as also the appear­
ances which occur sooner or later, and which place the
chance of recovery nearer, or more distant.
Medical men going to Grafenbcrg must form no
unfit or incompatible expectations. Of the adminis­
tration of any medicine there is no question there, what-
VINCENT PRIESSNITZ. 65
ever the disease and its fluctuations. In the great
saloon there is among the rules of the establishment
one which enjoins patients not to use any medicines,
and a request to quit the institution if it cannot be
withstood. In a similar manner, professional men are
requested not to interfere with their advice in any cases,
or to leave the establishment. Priessnitz is actuated
in his cures by circumstances, and finds for every patient,
and for every disease, somewhat different means and
ways. Simple as these seem, we repeat, they must yet
be administered, from their generally strong effect, with
a great knowledge of the state of the malady, and great
nicety of combination. It is indeed often surprising,
how deep his acquaintance seems to be with diseased
action, many examples of which I had whilst at Gra-
fenberg.
It gives me much gratification to be able to bestow
my humble meed of well-merited praise on Priessnitz:
his name will live in the pages of history. Nor have
his exertions been unrewarded in a pecuniary point
of view; he is now the most wealthy man in his
neighbourhood, and his family, at present eight chil­
dren, will be well provided for. He is reported to be
possessed of £50,000, which sum there, is equal in this
country to £150,000.
By the portrait I present to my readers, they will
be able to form an idea of tliis extraordinary man;
he looks, however, ten years older than he is; his age
is forty-three. He is of the middle stature, with limbs

such questions as are put to him, and frequently with a
yea or a nay. Proper explanations and reasons for his
proceedings are, however, to be got out of him at times,
and which I have succeeded in for the benefit of my
countrymen. He has arduous duties to perform, indeed
too much so, and here is one of the defects of Grafen­
berg. Not a tittle of the merit due to Priessnitz, have
I been found to deny to him, and the respect all his
patients entertain for him, nobles and princes included,
I share to the fullest extent; I must, however, remark,
for the benefit of those visiting Grafenberg, that Priess­
nitz does not run after his patients; the patients must
go to him, and glean all they require to know, for,
as stated, he is reserved to a fault. I have known per­
sons who have not seen him for more than a fortnight;
indeed, none but bed-ridden patients does he visit.
He is always to be consulted at meal-times, at which he
heads the first table, therefore, here the opportunity
occurs for eliciting information on the nature of one’s
disease. A serious evil exists as regards the quality
of the food and the extent to which this is indulged
in by the patients, respecting which we will speak
under the head of Grafenberg, where the process of
the cure, and manner of living there, will be fully
described.
In the year 1842, the number of patients amounted
to about 1200,—out of these five deaths occurred; but
VINCENT PRIESSNITZ. G7
it is stated that two out of the number had not been
accepted by Priessnitz, they therefore remained upon
their own responsibility. This group was composed
of Austrians, Prussians, Russians, Poles, &c., &c.,
and among them forty-six English: which latter com­
prised Sir Augustus d’Este, General Sir John Wilson,
Colonel Bowen, four English physicians, &c., &c. In
1841, there were but two English, about the same
number of patients, and as few deaths.
In concluding this article, we may yet add in praise
of Priessnitz, that his riches have not, as too often
happens, inflated his pride; but that he is the same
humble, modest, and unassuming man, respected and
esteemed by his neighbours for his humanity and
benevolence.
SECTION II.
Grafenberg.
T h i s mountainous district is situate about 1000 Eng­
lish miles south-east of London, and is remarkable
for the beauty of its neighbouring scenery. The pic­
turesque and magnificent views from the Nesseltop are
particularly grand, from whence the whole of the
Prussian Plains, to the extent of many miles, and the
garrison town of Neisse, twenty-four miles distant, may
be seen. Nesseltop is an hour and a halfs walk from
e 2
G8 GRAFENBF.RG.
Grafcnberg, but will well repay the trouble by the enjoy­
ment created upon beholding the splendour of its views.
Grafenberg, as stated, is one of the Sudates moun­
tains, a range of hills within the borders of the Austrian
portion of Silesia, and is therefore under the Austrian
dominion. From its interesting and natural beauty,
its variety of hill and dale, extensive surrounding
forests, the fine bracing air, the inexhaustible springs
amid the neighbouring rocks, and romantic situation,
it is well adapted for the establishment founded thereon
—for such whose disease is the result of effeminacy—
the consequences of a town life—and whose system
rather requires to be steeled amid such atmospheric
changes. To have spent a portion of one’s life in this
merry temple of nature, and in the simple mode of
living there, must indeed tend to correct the notions
imbibed in our artificial state of society.
GRAFENBERG.
The many comforts and luxuries we have been
accustomed to in this state we shall miss at every
step; but although this is very unpromising at first,
it is nevertheless astonishing how soon we get in­
ured to the change: the business of the day is so
varied and complete, that there is scarcely time for
reflection. These occupations, together with early
retiring to rest, conspire to pass the time away very
quickly.
I had the bad luck to arrive there about ten o’clock
at night, shaken to pieces and full of aches and pains,
having unfortunately been deceived by the post-master
at Neisse, who assured me I should arrive there (travel­
ling post) in four hours. This induced me to proceed
on, as it was but then half-past four, and a pretty pro­
ceeding it was. I was bumped, thumped, tumbled, and
shaken about in such a manner, from the badness of the
roads and the crazy old royal post-chaise, (a wicker
basket fixed upon boards without springs,) that active
inflammation set in rapidly, and I suffered the most
intense agony in consequence. In this dreadful state I
at length arrived at Priessnitz’s large house, at the
before-mentioned hour, when the postilion blew repeated
blasts from his brazen trumpet loud enough to awake
the slumbering, but to no effect. At length, tired and
impatient, I descended from the carriage, and hammered
away at the door with my walking stick with all my
might, assisted by the driver. This succeeded in bring­
ing a sort of stable-boy to the door with a lantern, who
6<J
70 GRAFENBERG.
infonned me that I must return to Freiwaldau, sleep at
the hotel, and come up in the morning, as Mr. Priessnitz
never saw any one who arrived in the night. This
intelligence was any thing but pleasing. I made known
my disastrous situation, and entreated to see Priessnitz :
the youth was inflexible. I then asked to be conducted
to an Englishman. I was taken to a Scotchman, to
whom I related my painful state. He told me Priessnitz
would not see me, and I must go back to the town. I
stated my inability to do so, and requested to know if I
could not have accommodation of any kind as a make­
shift. He replied no, there was not a bed to be had.
I then expressed an anxious desire to put up with a
mere shelter for the night. He said it was impossible,
there was no covering, and that I should be frozen to
death, the weather being very cold. I told him I did
not care; I had suffered so much in my knee, that I
would much rather put up with that than return; and,
indeed, I meant not to leave the house. This induced
him to speak seriously with the boy, who then informed
me that he had some straw in a house over the way, if
I liked to lie upon that. I assented willingly; but he
said he had no covering whatever: that mattered not: a
shelter and rest I wanted; so I gladly accepted his offer.
We entered this promised mansion by a flight of half-
broken and irregular dirty stone steps—Priessnitz’s
original bath-house. The interior was quite a scene;
something alarming. On my left a descent of dark and
dirty stone steps, from which issued a loud noise of
GRAFENBERG. 71
running water; a long passage lined with blankets and
sheets, possessing a most offensive odour; we ascended
very dirty stairs to the top, where we encountered more
blankets and their effluvia. At length I was shown into
a chamber, and was informed that it was the best in the
house; one for all the world, as I thought then, (first
impression,) like a stable-loft swept out; consisting of
coarsely plastered whitened w
ralls; an old dirty deal
bedstead—something in the shape of an egg-box placed
upon four legs—containing some loose straw which had
been put in many a perspiration by its departed owner,
who had quitted this apartment the previous morning;
an old deal chest of drawers; two chairs and table to
match, with a brown earthenware (poor person’s baking)
dish for a wash-hand basin; a German stove, bottle
and glass, and no window blind. I almost forgot to
mention a hole cut in the floor to sweep in the dirt of
the chamber, as this is the utmost extent of cleansing
these dwellings. On this straw I was told to sleep, and
thankful I felt for i t ; I wrapped my cloak round me
and lay down, soon after which, to my inexpressible
satisfaction and delight, I was covered with some person’s
sweaty blanket. Such is a Grafenberg reception, whether
prince or doctor, if they venture after the prescribed
time. I afterwards ascertained that my chamber really
was about the best, being what is called a double
room, that is, for two persons. There is a room in
Priessnitz’s large house in which seven persons reside;
there is another also in the wooden house across the
72 grafenrerg.
road of still larger dimensions, in which fourteen persons
reside. Even this accommodation is only to be
procured in winter: therefore I advise all persons who
arrive late or early to put up at the hotel in Freiwaldau,
called the “ Silber Krone/* and seek the best accommo­
dation at their leisure; for by so doing they will be sure
to meet with better than what they must put up with,
nolens volens, if they came unawares.
Before I proceed further into the particulars of
Grafenberg, it may not be out of place, while on the
subject, to name the routes which persons desirous of
going thither may take.
FIRST RO U TE.
From London to Hamburg by steam-packet, thence
to Berlin by mail coach, then to Frankfurt on the Oder
by railway, from there to Breslau by mail coach, from
the latter, to Olau by railway, whence half-a-day’s
journey by one of the railway coaches will take them to
Neisse, and from there a private carriage or post-chaise
to Grafenberg in six hours.
The railway from Breslau to Olau, is intended to be
completed to the Austrian frontier.
SECOND ROUTE.
From London or Dover to Ostend by steamer, thence
to Liege by railway, from Liege to Aix-la-Chapelle by
diligence, thence to Cologne by railway, from Cologne
GRAFENBERG. 73
to Mayence by steamer up the Rhine, from the latter to
Frankfurt on the Maine, by railway, thence to Leipzig
by mail coach, from the latter to Dresden by railway,
thence to Neisse by mail coach, and lastly to Grafen-
berg, as before described.
From Liege to Aix-la-Chapelle, two or three persons
joining will find comfortable private coaches to convey
them there at a trifle more expense, and with a far
greater degree of comfort. The railway from Liege
to Aix-la-Chapelle will probably be completed in the
autumn of this year. The passage from Cologne to
Mayence takes in all the most picturesque and romantic
scenery of the Rhine. Persons finding the journey too
fatiguing from Frankfurt to Leipzig, will do well to
rest at Gotha a day or two, being one of the most
delightful places I have ever been in. But they must
take the precaution to carry their passports about them,
as I was stopped in the street by the soldiery and asked
for mine—a disagreeable rencontre.
About half-a-day’s journey by coach from Gotha, is
one of the best water establishments at a place called
Elgersburg, superintended by Dr. Piutti at the govern­
ment’s expense.
We now return to our subject. I stated that Grafen-
berg was suited for certain persons, but it is not for
weakly patients, such as are not equal to the exertions
of mounting the hills, or who require a more uniformly
mild climate, for it is very raw and tempestuous there
sometimes, particularly so during the spring and winter—
74 GRAFENBERG.
snow, storms, and frost, frequently setting in about the
end of October—snow not unfrequently knee deep—and
after a thaw and subsequent frost the walks become
dangerous even for those who are very robust; they are,
therefore, obliged to have the assistance of spiked sticks
and heels to secure them from falling. Priessnitz
recommends winter for the cure as taking better effect
than at other periods of the year, and there were from
200 to 300 patients undergoing the cure amid all the
rigours of winter when I left.
The nature of one’s daily occupation will be gathered
from the following recital. About five o’clock in the
morning, the baddiener, or bath servant, comes and wraps
the patient up either in a coarse thick blanket, or wet
sheet, (leaving nothing but the face uncovered,) over
which he places a feather bed, tucking it very closely
under him, and then generally leaves him from one to
two hours until he gets warm or perspiration breaks out,
as may be desired. After this he is conducted down to
the cold bath, into which he plunges. Being dried and
dressed, the patient generally takes an hour’s walk to the
different springs, and drinks plentifully of the fresh
water—returns to breakfast, consisting of black or rye
bread and butter, buttermilk, and fresh milk; of these
things the patients partake ad libitum. Should white
bread be preferred, it is to be purchased, and not
objected to by Priessnitz. After this meal, another
hour’s walk, then to the douche, sitting bath, or wet
sheet, changing the compresses, &c.; afterwards walk
GRAFENBERG. 75
repeated—then comes the welcome sound of the dinner
bell, one o’clock, which all are anxious to hear. Dinner
generally lasts an hour and a half, as the food is recom­
mended to be taken slowly and not hot to aid digestion,
hot food being deemed injurious. After dinner drink­
ing is somewhat diminished—walks are taken, and at five
o’clock the blankets, wet sheets, or sitting baths, are in
requisition and repeated accordingly. The next meal
and last is supper, which is on the table at seven, and
consists of the breakfast fare with the occasional addition
of boiled potatoes in their skins during the winter
months. After which an hour is passed in agreeable
conversation, and bedtime is looked to with pleasure.
Some have more or less umschlags or compresses to
apply to the various parts, but all have what is called
Neptune’s girdle round their waists, which is exchanged
for the flannel we usually wear, and which is effected
not only without detriment, but with positive good.
All flannel is at once discarded; Priessnitz discourages
the use of anything but linen worn next to the skin.
In very severe weather he sometimes wears wash leather
over his shirt, but never makes a practice of it. All the
compresses are of course made of linen, and the same
material is recommended for night shirts.
After pursuing this treatment for some time, more
or less, according to the state of the individual, age,
constitution, and sex, the cure begins to work its
effects, and that harbinger of a better state, the crisis,
sets in. This is a most important part, and one that
76 g r a f e n b e r g .
requires considerable knowledge of the subject to treat
all the phases and appearances must be noted and acted
upon, according to the emergency, by the various ap­
plications resorted to for alleviating pain, and facilitat­
ing recovery. Crises are sometimes dangerous, the pain
excruciating, and the patient in the highest state of
nervous fever and excitement; here the greatest tact
and skill become necessary, to guide the struggle be­
tween the disease and the natural healing power, for if
too much impetus is given to the latter, or the crisis is
too much forced when the vital action exists but in a
reduced measure, the consequences may prove fatal.
The cure is generally very much modified during this
critical period, and when happily overcome, a restoration
to health is all but certain. For this reason the crisis
is hailed with the utmost delight by the Grafenbergers,
many of whom, indeed, make it a topic of constant
conversation, if they are lucky enough to get one; this
is very instructive to an observing practitioner, and
cannot fail to enhance his knowledge if he narrowly
watches those changes which occur, and the mode of
quieting, accelerating, and relieving them. The dis­
charge from these crises is often very offensive, and of
different colours and consistence; once discharging, it
is easy to promote the flow of matter by the application
of the wet fomentations, which is very necessary.
We will now speak of a very important part of the
cure—I allude to diet. Every one will admit that in
the treatment of diseases, leaving out of the question
GRAFENBERG. 77
its great value for people in good health, this forms one
of the principal considerations. We have already stated
that for breakfast and supper, rye-bread, fresh and salt
butter, fresh milk, and buttermilk, with the addition
of some potatoes to the latter meal in winter, is given
at Grafenberg. Dinner is composed of greasy soup,
bad beef with sweet sauce, baked veal or mutton,
pickled cucumbers, gherkins, or sourcrout, with twice
or thrice a week farinaceous food, in the shape of
dumplings, puddings, &c., and occasionally potatoes and
cabbage; much water is drunk during this repast.
Priessnitz says, and I fully coincide with him, that the
body should not be weakened by a withdrawal of food
whilst under treatment; indeed, the great quantity of
water which is drunk facilitates and aids digestion
considerably, and acts in so strengthening a degree, that
not only does animal food become unhurtful, but rather
necessary. We must add the sweating, the repeated
bathing, and the exercise in the keen and bracing
mountain air; exercise, too, often connected with some
exertion in ascending and descending the hills, &c.,
and last, though not least, a mind free from mental
occupation or anxiety. All these circumstances stimu­
late the appetite ; but to see the patients at Grafenberg
eat would indeed astonish the warmest supporter of the
maxim, that the body ought to be strengthened, not
weakened. It is also a matter of surprise how Priess­
nitz, with all his clear-sightedness and judgment, should
persist in making such an awful mistake—at least,
78 GRAFENBERG.
what I cannot help considering such. A strength­
ening, but simple nutriment should be served, and
this should be properly prepared. It is the very
reverse at Grafenberg; there the food is of a very
indigestible nature, the meat being full of sinews and
very poor—little more than tough animal fibre—sour
gherkins and cucumbers — dumplings swimming in
grease, and bad pastry. The rye-bread is seldom suffi­
ciently baked, and frequently comes on table warm,
which renders it difficult of digestion ; and the bad
consequences of eating too much of such improper food
above mentioned, in dyspeptic cases, we are well aware
of. It is certainly not good for persons having weak
stomachs and bad digestion to eat enormous quantities
of potatoes for supper, as I have seen. Priessnitz
adheres to his opinion that water will dissolve and
digest everything, and therefore allows his patients to
partake freely of the diet named; but I am persuaded
many of the cures are retarded by it.
There is a billiard and smoking-room, which I
conceive to be highly detrimental to the progress
of the cure, as it is generally filled for hours in bad
and cold weather, and is without ventilation, every
window being closed; no chimney, and a German
stove always heated. This may be considered a fault
of the patients themselves; but at present I see no
remedy, as their own chambers are nearly under the
same disadvantages, not being provided with a chimney.
Priessnitz expects the patients to watch closely the
GRAFENBERG. 79
effects of the prescribed treatment and report thereon,
for he has no time to visit all, as may be supposed,
having four or five hundred to attend to—consequently,
he visits only such as are incapable of getting out, the
rest must shift for themselves ; in this respect they are
generally very attentive, and strictly adhere to his
injunctions as that of an oracle, and very properly so too,
if they wish to get cured. In some few instances, but
I hold these as exceptions to the general rule, the
patients neglect to consult with Priessnitz, trusting
to the assistance of the baddiener, which is decidedly
wrong, and is highly reprehensible, as I will instance.
A gentleman, who had been a patient four months,
came to me and showed me Ins thumb, which was much
swollen, highly inflamed, and exceedingly painful,
which had continued so for three weeks; I remarked
that the covering was too light; he said it was the
same as Priessnitz gave him. I advised his consulting
Priessnitz, and blamed him for the delay; he replied,
that he had not slept for the last three weeks, that
Priessnitz did not understand his case, and he would
not see him, that he knew better how to treat himself.
He was very excited, and, seeing that he might easily
be relieved by proper treatment, I told him that there
was deep-seated matter under the fascia, and that he
must get a much larger piece of linen—one that would
hold water enough to keep wet a long time, and
envelope the whole hand in it, so as to make a nice
fomentation or poultice, and he would soon be better.
80 GRAFENBERG.
He acted under my advice, he obtained almost immediate
relief, and in three days it discharged profusely; the
treatment was kept up, and he improved rapidly in health.
Had he consulted Priessnitz, as he was in duty bound to
do, he would have been spared his intense sufferings.
Nearly all the patients take their meals in the saloon
of the large house. It is capable of containing five or
six hundred persons. It is 120 feet long and 40 wide,
and has a balcony for an orchestra, in which a band
performs at the dinner-hour throughout the summer
season, and on every Sunday during the winter months,
besides every Sunday evening, when a ball takes place.!
There is much gaiety and hilarity during the ball, from
eight till ten; and a stranger certainly would not sus­
pect that the motley group of dancers and lookers-on
were invalids. Priessnitz and his wife are often
present. The saloon forms a good promenade in bad
weather, and ample space for playing at battle-door,
la grass, dancing, &c.; but the Grafenbergers are
not generally particular to the state of the weather;
armed with immense top boots, they defy hail, snow,
rain, or wind. Neither are they over warmly clad.
But connected with the advantages of this great room
are some drawbacks: it is never kept sufficiently warm
to feel comfortable; the tables are never uncovered,
always having the table-cloths and plates on them for
the next repast; the kitchen and bakehouse are imme­
diately under it, from whence arise disagreeable odours;
and this is not the worst part of it,—there are excessively
GRAFENBERG. 81
filthy smells from the entrance of the house to the
saloon, arising from the sweating-blankets and linen
which is hung up in all directions; and the water-
closets on the stairs are always most filthily dirty : ex­
halations not compatible with health. Priessnitz does
not recommend too much artificial warmth, as it tends
to weaken our bodies; and the more we are exposed to
the atmospheric changes, the better shall we be protected
from their consequences. We must keep up a due action
in the circulation by exercise in the open air: after being
a little fortified by the treatment, we may venture out
in the most tempestuous weather without fear, and clad
in such light clothing that we might suppose the death­
blow would be given to the soundest constitution. One
gentleman, during my residence at Grafenberg, walked
about in the month of December in nothing but a
merino dress ; no flannel, drawers, or great coat; and he
was one of the most robust and lively of the patients.
He staid five minutes in the cold bath, also under the
douche, whilst in that severe weather no other person
could bear it above two; the temperature of the
water being at one degree Reaumur above the freezing
point.
In December, when I left, there were still about 120
patients at Grafenberg, and as many more in Freiwaldau.
The dwellings in this town are more commodious, the
air not so keen, and the walks not so dangerous, being
on a level, for which reason many prefer passing the
winter months in i t ; but it has this disadvantage—the
F
82 GRAFENBERG.
baths must be brought into the rooms whenever required,
whilst at Grafenberg nearly every house is provided
with a fresh running bath; besides, here one meets
with an inexhaustible fund of information, and agree­
able society, all of which contribute to the restor­
ation of health. The expense of living at Grafenberg
is about tliirty shillings a week, including Priess-
nitz’s fee. Persons about to visit the place will do
well to provide themselves with many trifling neces­
sary comforts, as they are not easily procurable, and
of very indifferent quality. Neither should they omit
providing themselves with Austrian money, as English
bank notes are refused, and the sovereign will only fetch
nineteen shillings. Any person may dine a la table
d’hote for a moderate charge with the patients in the
great saloon, or have a private table if desired. The
travelling expenses, either route, to go comfortably,
are about £20, and the time required from ten to twelve
days.
The 2nd of October, 1842, was a day of great
rejoicing at Grafenberg: it was the forty-third an­
niversary birthday of Priessnitz, commemorated by
a rich merchant from Vienna, who was cured of a
chronic disease of long standing. This gentleman had
an obelisk erected for one of the best springs in the
woods, which bore the name of Hirsch, or stag-spring ;
on this spot, two hundred years ago, fell a Priessnitz,
an ancestor of our renowned Vincent Priessnitz, in the
defence of his only daughter against the Swedes who
GRAFENBERG. 83
then invaded the country: both fell a sacrifice to the
infuriated soldiers. On the completion of the spring in
question, it was christened and called “Priessnitz Spring,”
the year 1642 being placed over, and 184£ under the
name of “ Priessnilz Spring,” to mark the two events.
There was a procession formed of all the patients, three
or four hundred in number, headed by a band of music
profusely decorated with garlands, and followed by the
flags of all the nations, individual members of which
were present, twelve in number. Each had their own
flag made at their own expense, in honour of the country
they represented ; and the Union-jack waved triumph­
antly next to the national flag of Austria; besides
which, there were the Prussian, French, Belgian, Bohe­
mian, Hungarian, Dutch, &c. The cur-gaste, or cure-
guests, brought up the rear:—all who could walk
or hobble joined, the ladies enlivening the scene by
their presence. After the ceremony of consecrating
and christening, a collation was served up, consisting of
potatoes and salt, which were boiled in large saucepans
in gipsy style, fifty yards from the spring;—these
were relished with copious draughts of the pure water
from the Priessnitz spring. Due honour was paid to
Priessnitz and to the various nations by their healths
being proposed; all were received with tremendous cheer­
ing, which made the very woods ring again ; a salute of
cannon succeeded every toast: greater joy and hilarity
could not be witnessed in the most sumptuous feast.
The procession retraced their steps to the house in a

similar manner : the evening was finished with a grand
ball, the spacious saloon being brilliantly illuminated.
Priessnitz absented himself that day, but his health was
drunk again and again, each time cheered louder and
louder, with bumpers of—w a t e r .
PART III.
WATER, &c.
OP THE QUALITIES OF WATER AND ITS EFFECTS UPON THE
HUMAN BODY IN GENERAL.
P u r e water is commonly described to be a transparent
fluid, without colour, smell, or taste; in a very slight
degree compressible ; not liable to spontaneous change;
liquid in the common temperature of our atmosphere,
assuming the solid form at 32° Fahrenheit, and the
gaseous at 2129
, but returning unaltered to its liquid
state on resuming any degree of heat between these
points; capable of dissolving a greater number of
natural bodies than any other fluid whatever, and
especially those known under the name of the saline;
performing the most important functions in the vegetable
and animal kingdoms, and entering largely into their
composition as a constituent p art: therefore it neces­
sarily excites our utmost attention, as being indis­
pensably essential to our existence.
Up to the last century water was held to be a
simple elementary substance; it was only in the year
1781 that the celebrated French chemist Lavoisier,
after various experiments, showed it to consist of fifteen
86 TIIE QUALITIES OF WATER
parts hydrogen, and eiglity-five parts oxygen. Recent
and more exact analysis proves it to be eleven hydrogen,
and eighty-nine oxygen ; our atmospheric air consists of
eighty parts nitrogen, and twenty parts oxygen. It is
from those component parts of water that its qualities
become apparent as means of preservation for all in­
animate and animate nature.
The animating and nourishing property of water is
its attribute as an element, quite apart from any acci­
dental admixture: the same as, in reference to the
atmospheric air, we regard the element in its composition
with oxygen as a principle of life ; so also water, as an
element, in its admixture of oxygen and hydrogen, tends
to maintain the vital power by nourishing and strength­
ening it. In the same manner as air, being inhaled into
the delicate texture of the lungs, is decomposed, and
the oxygen or nourishing part taken up into the system,
water becomes decomposed, either by the organs of
digestion when taken internally, or by the whole surface
of the body when applied externally, and the oxygen
assimilated to it. The vital principle depends upon a
due supply of oxygen; and this is found in much greater
proportion in water than in air. Who knows not the
balm which a draught of fresh water is to the thirsty ?
the new power and life which the depressed body attains
by a bath in the river on a sultry summer’s day?
Organic life can exist as little without water as without
air. All vegetable life perishes under a broiling sun;
as in the deserts of Africa, when no shower of rain
AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE HOMAN BODY. 87
refreshes the earth; but as soon as the rainy season sets
in, the vegetable kingdom blooms luxuriantly, where,
previous to that, not a blade of grass met the eye of
the weary traveller. The fruitfulness of Egypt is
alone owing to the periodical inundations of the Nile.
Some animals subsist upon water entirely, as leeches:
an experiment made in this respect by our late country­
man Fordyce is particularly remarkable. He took some
gold fish, placed them in a glass with fresh water, which
in the beginning he supplied every twenty-four hours,
but afterwards every three days; there they existed for
fifteen months without any other nourishment whatever,
nay, had grown twice their size in that time. We have
instances of men who have lived upon nothing but
water for a considerable time: a religious fanatic in
Albany, America, formed a resolution to abstain from
all food; towards the end of May, 1829, he began to
eat very little, which he continued till the 2nd July,
after which period he ceased eating altogether; but in
lieu of this he washed himself daily with cold spring
water, from time to time rinsing his mouth with it, and
drinking five pints every twenty-four hours. This
abstemiousness he carried out full six weeks, when
death put a period to his existence. He had gradually
got thinner and weaker, until he lost all strength, and
his breath and perspirations had become fetid in conse­
quence of the corruption of the secretions. Now, could
he have lived so long without food, if the water he drank
and the ablutions he made use of had not nourished
88 THE QUALITIES OF WATER
his "body, and thus excited afresh the vital power
within ?
Another quality of water is its fluidity, thereby be­
coming a powerful dissolvent, without which no process
of life can exist; without fluids nature dies, and without
fluids the destruction of the human body, composed
of fluids and solids, is inevitable: all nature, and con­
sequently also the human body, exists but by a constant
and unceasing change of its constituent parts; the unser­
viceable portion is secreted and replaced by new matter
from nature. This constant change, however, can only
take place by the agency of liquids, the digestion of the
food taken, its conversion into nourishment for the
blood, the formation and maintenance of the solid
parts of the body by the blood, and lastly, the ejection
of the refuse and deleterious parts from the body; in a
word, the whole process of chemical-animal life rests on
the condition of liquidity, and the foundation of every
thing fluid in nature, is water.
Such are the properties of water, apart from its tem­
perature ; in latter times it is cold water principally that
is applied as a therapeutic agent.
Hitherto, when cold water has been used in surgery or
medicine, it has been only with reference to its first, or
anti-inflammatory effect, whilst the second effect or
reaction has been quite overlooked.
In the influence of cold generally on any part of the
human organism, we perceive a double effect; its direct
or primary, and its secondary efFect or reaction. The
AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE HUMAN BODY. 81)
first appears hostile enough: the part which comes in
contact with the cold loses its warmth, its sensibility is
diminished, the vessels are contracted, the blood and
fluids are propelled to the interior, the surface touched
by cold becomes pallid, and an interruption to the due
secretions of the part is the consequence. But as every
thing acting injuriously on the human body causes in
the same a counteraction, to equalize the effect, and as
nature generally applies more power than is required
for the mere warding off the attack, so the organism
tries here to conquer and overcome the discomfiture, and
the roused vital power causes an increased action to the
surface. If, therefore, the cold has not had too long or
powerful an effect, the return to life of the part affected
is manifested by increased sensibility, and by a pricking
and burning; the skin becomes reddened, a greater
generation of warmth takes place, the blood streams to
the part in larger quantities, the secretion is increased,
the skin, full of blood and moisture, becomes soft and
perspires: this is the indirect effect of cold, or the reac­
tion of the organism. This remarkable double effect of
cold is also apparent in its influence in the whole system.
The first effect of it is hostile to organic life, checks all
its developemcnts, the nervous system appears depressed,
the peculiar warmth of the body, the elasticity of all its
parts is impaired, the blood is lessened and condensed
in the arteries, the secretions are retained, digestion
weakened, the nourishment interfered with, and the size
of the whole frame diminished. The second effect, or
reaction, has quite opposite results: warmth and blood
return, the appetite is immediately increased, diges­
tion proceeds more energetically, the organs of sense are
quickened, each muscle is strengthened; in short, the
whole being gains strength, which is made manifest
by a joyful feeling of health.
For the reaction of cold, the double law exists, that
it exceeds the primary effect by far in intensity and ex­
tensiveness, and that it is the more powerful, the more
sudden the transition from warm to cold. The first or
primary effect can vary in different degrees, from the
lowest, scarcely exciting sensibility, to the highest, when
it destroys organic life. The intense degree of. the
primary effect of cold depends greatly upon the extent
of the organic surface with which it comes into imme­
diate contact, but it is not this alone which determines
the effect only to the part touched, or to its spreading
over the whole organism. If the relative degree of cold
is not powerful, or does not last long enough to change
materially the functions of the organ touched—if this
organ is comparatively self-dependent, and of less
importance to the whole body—if the sensibility of this
organ, or the whole organism, is trifling—if great power
and energy exist in the individual, &c., and at the same
time only a small portion of the body is brought into
contact with cold, the primary effect will be confined to
this organ. According, however, as one or the other of
these conditions is favourable to the spreading of this
local action, the greater extension will the primary effect
have.
90 THE QUALITIES AND EFFECTS OF WATER.
DIETETIC USE OF WATER* 91
The total effect of cold, primary, and secondary or
reaction, must be considered as an animating and
strengthening remedy, when the powers of life are weak­
ened by laxity and atony. Proper judgment must,
however, be used as to its application : in a due degree,
it tends to strengthen and preserve health: we all
know that a bright winter’s day is more animating
than a sultry one in summer; that the inhabitants of
the colder regions have more strength and live longer
than those of the south.
In a much greater degree does cold water affect the
organism beneficially, both in its primary and secondary
effect.
DIETETIC USE OF WATER.
The object of dietetic observances in general, is to
preserve health, prevent disease, and prolong life. To
attain these, elixirs of life, wonderful essences, and
secret remedies, were formerly resorted to ; but, as we
advanced in knowledge, these became disreputable;
nevertheless, we still find many, even among the better
informed classes, who, from time to time, have recourse
to drugs and quack medicines of all sorts, in the hope of
thereby improving their health, and preventing disease.
It is particularly for purgatives that Englishmen have a
great predilection,—for the so called blood-purifying
drinks, for mistaken strengthening remedies, and for

mineral waters. Some of these media, if suitably
applied, might be of infinite use to the sick, but
* to the comparatively healthy they are detrimental.
The true means of strengthening our bodies consist
in a due regimen, to which appertains moderation
and simplicity of food and drink, proper exercise
in the fresh air, and consequent enjoyment of serenity
of mind. The foundation for a long and healthy life
should be laid in childhood and youth, by an appro­
priate physical education.
INTERNAL DIETETIC USE OF WATER.
Drinking in general.
Drink is as indispensable to man as food and air;
indeed, hunger is more easily borne than the excruciat­
ing pain of thirst. In spite of this, many, and females
particularly, gradually wean themselves so much from
drinking, that they seldom feel a pressing desire for
it, and rarely take anything but tea and coffee: the
bad consequences of these prejudicial habits do not fail
to set in ; the fluids gradually assume a thick, viscous
consistency, the necessary ejection of deleterious
humours is impeded, their retention causes all sorts
of diseases of the alimentary canal, skin, &c., indi­
gestions arise, chronic diseases of the liver and spleen,
and lastly, the whole nervous system shares the general
disorder, and torturing hypochondriasis is the result.
INTERNAL DIETETIC USE OF WATER. 93
The question next arises: What beverage is most
suitable for man for daily use? F e r m e n t e d L i q u o r s
comprise all sorts of beer and wine. Light, simple
beer, imbued with a sufficient portion of malt and
hops, and well fermented, is, taken moderately, a very
proper drink for many persons, as it not only quenches
thirst, but excites the nerves agreeably, and thus
strengthens the body by the carbonic acid it con­
tains. Beer of this description is bright, has a thin,
whitish froth; but this is not always to be obtained,
and in summer, when most required, is frequently
least calculated to answer the desired end; it is then
either spoilt in the cellarage, or is too fresh or sour;
in either case it is very unwholesome, and injurious
to health. But even the best beer, if taken in large
quantities, brings a host of diseases in the course of
time, being too nourishing, producing thick, heavy
blood, and generating fat; the consequences are, con­
gestions in the abdomen, constipations of the bowels,
piles, apoplexy, &c. Strong brown beer, in particular,
is apt to produce these bad effects; but the most in­
jurious sort is that which is adulterated with powerful,
noxious and poisonous ingredients, such as green cop­
peras, cocculus indicus, and other pernicious drugs,
thereby attaining not only an intoxicating property,
but having the more serious evil effect of these becom­
ing mixed with the blood, heating it, rendering it unfit
for the due nourishment of the body, and thus affecting
the brain and nerves, giving rise to palsy, epilepsy,
apoplexy, insanity, and even death. Good beer will
agree very well with spare or enervated persons, or such
as exert their bodies considerably; those of a strong
nature, however, of sedentary habits of life, and other­
wise addicted to good living, should avoid it in any
but very moderate portions. A glass or two of wine,
in cheerful society, or after considerable corporeal or
mental exertion, can do no hann to a healthy person.
If taken daily, and in excess, it causes trembling of
the extremities, chronic eruptions on the skin, bad
digestion, hardening of the liver, gout, stone, and leads
to death, by consumption, dropsy, or apoplexy. A
great deal depends on the sort of wine. Our limits
will not permit us to enter into a description of the
various sorts of wine ; suffice it to say, that the inferior,
and generally adulterated wines, are very prejudicial,
taken habitually.
D i s t i l l e d L i q u o r s .—What has been said of wine,
appertains, and in a stronger degree, to brandy, rum, gin,
whiskey, sweet liqueurs, &c. Spirits are not unjustly
called liquid fire; they not only expedite the process
of life in a fearful manner, and destroy the body, but
likewise blunt the mind against the perception of all
that is good and beautiful. Unfortunately, in spite of
the temperance societies, the abuse of spirits appears
little abated. Most, if not all, the physical and mental
degeneration of the lower orders must be attributed
to this. It has been maintained, that spirits and beer
are an essential requisite for labourers in the free

degree; is always apt to produce hypochondriasis and

constant use of coffee, particularly if strongly prepared,
is exceedingly injurious to some. Plethoric persons, or
such as suffer from diseases of the chest, spitting of
blood, piles, irregular menstruation, hysteria, hypochon­
driasis, or weakness of the nerves, flueurs blanches, &c.,
must avoid it, its effect being to increase these maladies;
whilst, on the other hand, many of them disappear if
cold water and milk is taken instead. Old, phlegmatic,
or literary persons may, however, indulge a little in it.
C h o c o l a t e .—The frequent drinking of chocolate gives
rise to indigestion; and if prepared with spices, as is
often the case, considerably excites the blood and nervous
systems. We have another beverage to consider, pre­
pared by nature, and not by human art, (or was, before
man tried his genius at imitation;) we allude to M i l k .
96 WATER THE MOST USEFUL DRINK.
It is the first drink for the new-born, its nourishment,
and indispensable to its thriving. Adults, used to simple
food, may take it even in large quantities, and with
benefit; those, however, whose stomachs are naturally
weak, or excited and weakened by artificial, spicy and
piquant food, milk will not agree with; and least of all
with persons used to beer, wine, or spirits: it curdles
in the stomach, the cheesy particles become attached to
its walls, the whey becomes sour, and the fatty oily
substances become rancid. As a natural consequence,
we have heartburn, spasms, diarrhoea, and other bowel
complaints, &c.' L e m o n a d e , & c .—Cooling drinks of
this kind check the process of life, and the developement
of too great heat in the body; they are, therefore,
salutary in moderation, but taken to excess, produce
weakness of the stomach, &c.
WATER THE MOST USEFUL DRINK FOR THE HEALTHY.
Nature seems to have assigned water as a drink for all
its creatures, in spreading it over the face of the earth.
Animals satisfy their thirst with water; and with people
still living in a natural state water forms the only drink.
All other beverages are the produce of civilization and
progressing luxury, which generate artificial wants. No
other beverage is better calculated to quench the thirst,
and to replace the moisture withdrawn from the body
by perspiration and other natural evacuations, than water,

pure and fresh from the spring. It aids digestion in a
mild and not exciting manner; it gives a good and
relishing appetite. Water-drinkers are seldom subject
to pain in the stomach, spasms, phlegm, and similar
affections: great regularity of the bowels prevails, so
that no destructive purgatives are required; whilst beer
being very satisfying, an habitual drinker of it, has
already on that account not so good an appetite. Wine
taken in quantities daily, gradually blunts the nerves of
the stomach to that degree, by over-exciting them, that
at last only strong-spiced food becomes palatable.
Brandy-drinkers forget eating altogether, and constantly
suffer in a variety of ways.
Some persons contend that they cannot tolerate water,
because it swells their stomachs, and renders them
uncomfortable, producing indigestion, &c. It certainly
at first does not seem to agree with those who have
spoiled their stomachs with too much exciting food and
drink ; but it is only in appearance, a consequence of
the total disuse of water. Such persons should be
urgently advised to simplify their mode of living, and
accustom themselves cautiously to drink water, ere their
disease reaches a higher and perhaps incurable degree.
If this advice is followed, they will in a short time not
only be able to tolerate water, but have a better appetite,
and thus improve their health materially.
The alvine evacuations stand in close conjunction
with digestion. If the stomach possess the requisite
power to work up the food taken, the indigestible

remains of the admixture are ejected daily with facility.
Water, therefore, will, by strengthening the stomach,
promote these excretions. But besides this, wate-r
facilitates the opening of the bowels, by raising the
activity of the intestines. Costiveness is one of the
most frequent ailments, particularly with persons of
sedentary habits. Water-drinking must therefore be
strongly recommended to them, in order to get rid of an
affection which acts not only very unpleasantly on the
body, but on the mind.
Water cools and refreshes the blood, prevents any
viscous tendency, promotes its due circulation, and thus
wards off many dangerous diseases. It also assists the
secretions and excretions, particularly by perspiration
and urine, and by this means eliminates many morbid
humours from the body. It is a well-known fact, that
by drinking a few glasses of cold water quickly, an
abundant perspiration will be the consequence, particu­
larly if wrapped up warmly in bed. There are some
stimulants that will produce a stronger flow of urine
than water, but then the kidneys are apt to be over­
excited, and relaxation follows, which not unfrequently
leads to dropsy. Water, likewise, acts sedatively, at
the same time strengthening the nervous system; it
therefore prevents hypochondriasis, hysteria, and spas­
modic attacks, which have their origin in increased
excitability of the nerves, called nervous weakness. It
raises the energy of the muscles; that is, increases
corporeal strength, and enables the body to undergo

fatigues, to which beer, wine, and spirit-drinkers
would soon succumb. Persons addicted to spirituous
liquors are generally quarrelsome, violent, and choleric;
whereas the water-drinker acquires a certain equanimity
which is not easily disturbed, in the course of the frequent
disagreeables inseparable from life.
The reader may perhaps be astonished to find us
attribute so many extraordinary qualities to water,
which probably he has till now despised; and we admit
that the expectations of its good effects may be disap­
pointed, if the mode of living be otherwise irregular.
Simple food, proper hours of rest, appropriate exercise,
enjoyment of fresh air, &c., are conditions without
which the object of water-drinking, as set forth, will
scarcely be attained. He who spends his nights at the
gaming-table, daily loads his stomach with dainties, or
who constantly sits at home, without ever inhaling the
free and fresh breeze of heaven, cannot expect that
water-drinking will keep him in good health, or obviate
disease. The first duty requisite is to bridle his
passions, or cast off bad habits; then the most brilliant
results may be anticipated.
ON THE QUALITY OF GOOD AND THE MEANS OF IMPROV­
ING BAD WATER.
A good drinkable water must be as pure as possible,
that is, free from all heterogeneous admixture. The
o 2

waters that flow within or upon the surface of the earth
contain various earthy, saline, metallic, vegetable, or ani­
mal particles, according to the substances over and
through which they pass. Rain and snow waters are
purer than those, though they also contain whatever
floats in the air, or has been exhaled along with the
watery vapours. Chalybeate springs are distinguished
by their containing more mineral particles and various
gaseous matters. Distilled water is allowed the highest
degree of purity; it is then a powerful solvent: but such
water, quite pure, is unfit for daily drink. Mineral
waters are very useful for many invalids, and serve as
remedies for the restoration of health, but they cannot
answer for daily use; nor is river water fit for this pur­
pose, being deficient of carbonic acid gas, and rendered
impure by the many substances from the three kingdoms
of nature, thrown into it, or taken up in its course.
The most suitable water for thinking is good spring
water; the mineral particles it contains are so trifling
that they can only be perceived by chemical analysis,—
and they facilitate digestion, so that even a weak
stomach can bear i t ; the oxygen it contains also gives
it a peculiar enlivening power. Springs which have their
origin in rocky soils, of course, have the preference over
those in marshy ones. The greatest attention should
be paid to the cleanliness of the pipes, if spring water is
conducted through them. A good water for drinking
should be without taste, smell, or colour; it is brighter
than water that is not pure, and must also possess a

certain degree of cold, which braces and strengthens the
organic fibre, whilst tepid or warm drink weakens i t ;
besides this, it is the cold that retains the carbonic acid
gas in the water; as soon as this assumes a warmer tem­
perature, the carbonic acid gas evaporates. It should
therefore be kept cool. It must be fresh when drank,
that is, not have stood too long ; every one knows the
difference,—the former refreshes and animates the body,
whilst the latter, with a stale and insipid taste, docs not.
The cause of the freshness of water is the carbonic
acid gas it contains: fresh water therefore has to be *
distinguished from cold water; it is fresh through the
carbonic acid it contains, cold by the lower degree of
temperature. Water drawn from the spring has both
qualities, but after standing a few hours in a cold place
it may retain the lower temperature, but is no longer
fresh, for the carbonic acid gas gradually evaporates; in
a warm place the evaporation goes on much quicker of
course. The evaporation of carbonic acid is easily per­
ceived by the eye, in the rising of small bubbles of
pearly appearance, and which adhere to the sides of the
glass, or vessel; where this is observed, the water is no
longer fresh. Water for drinking should therefore be
had fresh as often as possible, kept in' earthen or glass
vessels well covered or corked up, and in a cool place.
To improve inferior water, a little admixture of vine­
gar, honey, or wine was resorted to in former times.
Hahn, who is a great authority in these matters, recom­
mends the addition of a little salt, lemon-juice, or vine-

gar to an impure water, or to let it boil once and cool.
Hufeland, another great authority, gives the following
prescription to turn a foul and smelling water into good
water for drinking purposes in a short time. Mix a
table spoonful of powdered charcoal in a pint of water,
stir it well, let it stand a few minutes, then filter it
gently through a piece of filtering paper into another
vessel, when it will become colourless, tasteless, and
without smell, and thus perfectly sweet for drinking.
Lowitz, of Petersburgli, is the original inventor of this
*method. In travelling, a supply of powdered charcoal
in stopped bottles may not be an unnecessary appen­
dage.
OF THE QUANTITY OF WATER TO BE DRANK DAILY.
Fixed rules cannot well be given for every individual:
to drink water to excess, as some enthusiasts recommend,
we do not approve of; at the same time admitting that
it will prove less injurious than any other beverage
taken in excess. Too large a quantity of it will inter-
♦
fere with digestion; when that is the case, persons will
experience an uneasy feeling: in some solitary instances
even dangerous consequences may ensue from too great
a pressure on the nerves of the stomach, which may
terminate in apoplexy, in the same manner as over-feed­
ing sometimes does; therefore every one must judge for
himself of the amount he can take without disadvantage*
At all events, beginners in water drinking should com-
QUANTITY OF WATER TO RE DRANK. 103
mence with small portions, and gradually increase them,
progressing without morbid exactness or anxiety. As
little can be said in regard to the order of drinking
water; the great rule is to drink when you are thirsty;
there being however some, females particularly, who sel­
dom have thirst, we will add a few special limits. To
drink a glass or two of fresh water on getting out of bed
and during dressing, will be found very beneficial, from
its invigorating and aperient effect. Fashion has made
coffee the general beverage for breakfast, but every
warm drink is, strictly speaking, an unnatural one ; for
the thirsty require a cold, refreshing, and enlivening
draught. Coffee has, however, become indispensable to
many, and its deleterious effects have been lost sight of
in the course of years. Those, therefore, who have been
long accustomed to it, may take it for breakfast; but,
to lessen its heating properties, it should not be too
strong, and should have an adjunct of milk and sugar:
others not so much addicted to coffee drinking, yet still
desirous of a warm breakfast, may take chocolate, not
spiced; or milk, if suitable for them. Those who take
exercise in the air, or perform bodily labour, will be
sure to be thirsty; a few glasses of fresh water may
then again be taken with advantage. The habit of
taking spirituous or fermented liquors, for, or with any
luncheon, cannot be sufficiently deprecated, as it spoils
the appetite for the principal meal, and renders persons
unfit for the avocations of the day. Opinions are divided
as to drinking with dinner: some consider it necessary to
*
assist digestion, others believe it diminishes the gastric
juice, and so protracts digestion. My opinion is, that
drinking a little during meals is essential, that it aids
the digestive functions; and nothing is better for this
purpose than water, for this simple reason, that water
agrees with all kinds of food; beer is too satisfying,
and there are many edibles in conjunction with which
it causes heaviness and flatulency. Generally speaking,
beer is not at all suitable for drinking at dinner; a glass
or two of light wine, to those who are accustomed to it,
is to be preferred. Liquors during, or after dinner
must be thoroughly repudiated. We shall certainly
promote our health best by drinking a glass or two of
fresh water. The habit of taking coffee after dinner,
to say the least, is superfluous; a strong stomach needs
no stimulant, and in a weak one, the blood vessels and
nervous system will but be the more excited. During the
hours after dinner, most persons require more or less
drink—satisfy the voice of nature, and drink plenty of
water. The evenings are generally closed with either
taking beer, wine, or spirits and water. I have said
enough as to these; sleep cannot be refreshing after
imbibing a quantity of unwholesome, hot, and heating
liquors. The best narcotic is water. He who drinks
only water during the evening, w'ill have a calm and
quiet sleep, free from anxious dreams—he will be
refreshed in body and mind, and will cheerfully pursue
his daily occupations.

ON TIIE NECESSITY OF USING CHILDREN TO WATER
DRINKING.
It is particularly with those who have been accus­
tomed to water drinking in childhood, that it will show
its good effects in after life. During the first nine
months, the infant is to be nourished by its mother’s
milk which serves as food and drink ; it is gradually
accustomed to other sustenance during the period of
weaning. After this is accomplished, however, the
infant should have fresh water, as well as milk. By
water drinking in childhood and youth, the foundation
of a durable stomach is laid, and thus of a healthy body
throughout life. The nervous and blood systems are
over excited by taking viands, spices, beer, wine,
chocolate, coffee, &c.; a constant artificial state of
fever is maintained, and the process of life so much
accelerated by it, that children fed in this manner, do
not attain perhaps half the age ordained by nature.
Besides this, experience has taught that they generally
become passionate and wilful, having neither the will
nor the power to make themselves or others happy.
Futhermore, too exciting and nutritious food gives rise
to many diseases, to which they fall a sacrifice in early
years. Parents should weigh this well; they should
throw aside their prejudice against water, which they
look upon as weakening, ignorantly considering that the
tender organism of children requires far more nourish­
ing diet to bring it to maturity, than the already per­
106 EXTERNAL USE OF WATER.
fected body of the adult; this is a wrong notion: chil­
dren thrive best upon a simple, moderately nourishing
vegetable diet, on milk and pure water; we see this
confirmed in the cottage of the peasant.
EXTERNAL DIETETIC USE OF COLD WATER.
The external use of cold water is of no less import­
ance for the preservation of health than drinking it.
According to physiological facts, there is a constant
imperceptible secretion going on from the skin, of a
vapoury fluid, whereby large quantities of morbid matter
are eliminated from the body. If this secretion is
increased by continued heat, hot liquors, corporeal
motion, &c., it is condensed into a dripping fluid,—per­
spiration. The retention or suppression of this secretion
is the cause of many diseases, among which, catarrh,
cough, rheumatism, and diarrhoea, as also various skin
diseases, may be enumerated as some of the minor ones;
dangerous fevers and inflammations of the intestines,
however, are often the consequence of suppressed per­
spiration, or, in other words, of a cold. It is not only
in healthy days, but in time of sickness too, that nature
eliminates by the skin morbid humours, by which the
disease was generated or maintained. The skin must
therefore be considered as a medium of purification, by
which the healthy can be preserved against illness, and
the sick restored to health. Not only is the skin an
exhaling, but also an inhaling organ; not only does it
COLD ABLUTIONS. 107
absorb innumerable, and to the senses imperceptible
particles from the air, but takes up other substances
with which it comes in contact, into the body. In one
respect, it is often the medium of infection, in the other,
medical men are wont to introduce medicine through it
into the body. These short remarks will sufficiently
testify the great importance of the skin, greater indeed
than most people seem to believe. The external appli­
cation of cold water, besides the frequent change of
linen and bedding, is highly conducive to its proper
action, and to strengthen it.
OF COLD ABLUTIONS.
Pure spring water is decidedly the best for cold
ablutions; we need, however, not be too chary as to this
for such purposes, but use it as time and opportunity
favour. The process should be thus: begin with the
head, face and neck, then the chest, arms and abdomen,
lastly hips and legs. Headaches, inflammation of the
eyes, toothaches, &c., are the consequences to some, if
they expose themselves to the atmospheric air with the
hair w et; the loss of hair has often been observed to
be the result: the hair must therefore be carefully dried.
The palm of the hand, a sponge, or a piece of flannel,
should be used to rub the body well with. A tub of
sufficient size to be able to stand in, and receive the
water as it flows down die body, answers the pur­
pose well. This, with a basin of water and a sponge, is
108 COLD ABLUTIONS.
all that is required, a sheet laying handy to rub oneself
dry with. When all is finished, after having rubbed the
whole body over as above with the palm of the hand
constantly wetted, dip the sponge in the water and press
it over the head, so that the water runs down all parts
of the body. The washing and drying must be done
quickly; in eight or ten minutes the whole should be
completed. The best time for these ablutions is the
morning, immediately after getting out of bed; during
sleep the perspiration is generally stronger than when
awake, and the body is thus immediately freed of the
nightly exhalations, and fitted for the duties of tlie day.
If the operation is repeated before going to bed, a sound
and refreshing sleep will be the result. As for the
temperature of the water, the general rule is to apply it
as it comes from the spring. It is only weakly persons,
and such as are not at all accustomed to the cold,
that should begin with tepid water and gradually pro­
ceed to cold; a sponge should be used at first.
The advantage of these daily ablutions is very great;
they serve for cleanliness, to clear the skin of the
humours secreted, and thus maintain and promote its
activity. Warm washings weaken, whilst cold strengthen
the skin.
A weak skin renders the possessor liable to constant
perspiration, and great susceptibility to every change of
temperature. He, therefore, constantly suffers from
cold, cough, and rheumatic affections. No means are so
well adapted to destroy that susceptibility to catching
COLD ABLUTIONS. 109
cold, and with it the cause of much illness arising from
colds, than perseverance in daily ablutions. Their effect
extends "beyond the skin; through the connexion of this
organ with the whole body, by innumerable nerves and
vessels, they give tone to the muscles, diminish the
excitability of the nerves, promote the due circulation
of the blood, and thereby prevent congestions; in a word,
promote the due harmonious action of all the functions
of the body, upon which health and long life depend.
Cold ablutions are the best protective against con­
tagious diseases. Drugs, fumigations, &c., avail little or
nothing against them, as we have unfortunately witnessed
of late years in cholera; but cleanliness, support of the
chief organs and maintaining the evaporation by the
skin, with a cheerful spirit, afford the best protection.
Cold washings effect this, and the low temperature of the
water probably acts against the infectious humours.
Dr. Rohmid, in Inowraclaw, in the province of Posen,
Prussia, found that several daily ablutions of the whole
body with cold water, effectually guarded against infec­
tion from scarlet fever. A skin strengthened well by
cold water ablutions, was even known in 1813-14 and
15, during the malignant nervous fever of the time, to
eject the already received virus.
We may remark, in conclusion, that these ablutions
form a substitute for baths, for weakly bodies, for whom
the latter are too powerful, and a capital preparation for
those desirous to accustom themselves to bathing.
Cautions,—The room in which these ablutions are

made, should be free from all draughts; the uninitiated
should begin with tepid water first; friction is indispen­
sable ; never undertake an ablution when the body is
heated by exercise; passive perspiration produced by
being wrapped up in a blanket, or by the usual covering
of the bed, is what is required, to insure safety and suc­
cess ; be particular to rub the hands and feet dry, in
cold weather especially, to prevent their chapping, f
COLD BATHS.
We will here speak of baths in general, such as are
applicable to persons in health; those more especially
adapted for disease, will be fully treated of in the next
part.
Baths may be divided, according to their temperature,
into cool, varying from 55° to 75° Fahrenheit; cold
from 45° to 55°; and ice-cold from 35° to 45°; the
effect of the cold bath depends partly upon its tempera­
ture, and partly on the pressure of the water. At first,
it makes a violent impression on the skin and the
numerous vessels and nerves of which it is composed;
the skin is then contracted, the blood recedes from the
external and presses on the internal parts. The conse­
quence is, a paleness and shrinking of the skin, shivering
and trembling, quick and difficult breathing, together
with a slow pulse—a minute or two, however, and all is
*
changed. The vital power resists forcibly the influ­
ence of the cold, foreign to its nature; the blood soon
COLD BATHS. I ll
flows with increased strength to the outward parts,
warmth returns, the skin becomes reddened, breathing
regular, the pulse quicker, and a general sensation of ease
is felt. Leaving the bath at this moment causes the full
and beneficial effects. A general warmth and increased
evaporation by the skin takes place, the muscles acquire
increased power of action, all the functions of the
various organs are performed with increased activity,
appetite is heightened, the mind becomes easy and
cheerful; in a word, the whole system is strengthened.
The effects of the cold bath, however, are very different
if the bather remains in it too long; the counter effect
or reaction of the organism is able to overcome the blast­
ing effects of cold only for a short time; a fresh shiver­
ing and trembling sets in, which sometimes cannot be
subdued by the most active exertions of the body; the
skin becomes pale and wan, a violent headache and
general relaxation take place.
The following general rules should be observed:—
Never bathe with a full stomach, but after digestion has
been thoroughly effected; therefore four or five hours
after a hearty meal should be chosen; but before
breakfast, or a couple of hours after a light breakfast,
in some instances, is preferable. Never enter a cold
bath when the body is heated by exercise, or perspiring
through any but passive means. If you are liot, walk
gently, and get cool by degrees, undressing slowly.
Apoplexy, followed by death, is not unfrequently the
consequence of cold bathing, arising from want of
112 COLD BATHS.
caution, and is ignorantly supposed to be produced by
spasms. Before entering a cold bath, the head
and chest should be washed, to prevent congestion
of those parts. The duration of the bath is to be
determined by its degree of temperature; the colder the
water, the shorter should the time of bathing be. When
a sensation of cold or shivering has set in, the proper
measure has been exceeded: generally, we should not
remain longer than one or two minutes in an ice-cold
bath; in a cold one, two to five; and in a cool one, five to
seven: the weaker the constitution, the shorter the
duration. The cool baths are best for dietetic use ; the
cold will only do for robust constitutions, gradually
accustomed to such; the ice-cold require the utmost
caution, and are more intended for the cure of disease.
It is necessary to be very active in the bath, and to
rub the body well with both hands; nothing tends more
to promote the due circulation of the blood, to obviate
costiveness, to cause more activity in the nerves, and to
strengthen the skin. After the bath, dry and dress
quickly, and take moderate exercise in fine weather; if
damp and raw, it is more advisable not to use the bath at
all. Sensitive persons, who are subject to cold, nervous
weakness, &c., must prepare themselves for cold baths
by repeated washings and ablutions of a graduating
temperature, and then should take them at first not
quite cold, but tepid; the gradual transition from one
to the other, will have a highly beneficial effect on their
constitutions. Bathing-dresses, in some cases, may
COLD BATHS. 113
occasionally be used with advantage, to check the too
great action of the water on the skin. The cold bath
should not be recommended to plethoric persons, nor to
those who have a disposition to apoplexy, nor such as
suffer from giddiness and noise in the ears, weak lungs,
asthma, nor during menstruation.
R i v e r b a t h s . The above rules will also apply to
river baths, which have a decided preference over tub-
baths. The enjoyment of the free air connected with
them, and the constant renewing of the water, are
superior inducements for their use; and particularly the
free and uncontrolled motion of the body, by swimming
especially, is highly beneficial. A few observations on
this head may be useful.
Persons should be ever careful not to commit excesses
in bathing. Beginning too early in the year, and leaving
off too late, is sometimes injurious; the water being
unwarmed by the sun’s rays is often much too cold, and
produces cough, catarrh, rheumatism, headache, stiffness
of the joints, & c.; the attempt at strengthening the
body, at which these practices aim, will fail if over done.
Battling twice a day is therefore also objectionable.
One river-bath daily is quite sufficient for all purposes
of health; indeed it is even well occasionally to omit it,
particularly in raw and damp weather, so as not to blunt
the susceptibility of the body for water too much. Of
course the duration of bathing in rivers may be longer
than in tubs, on account of the before-mentioned reasons,
but fifteen minutes is quite long enough. Exhaustion

114 SEA BATHING.
should never be permitted to take place while bathing.
The best times for river bathing is either before break­
fast, or from ten to twelve in the morning, and from five
to seven in the evening.
What we have stated as to ablutions applies in greater
force to cold and river-baths. They are the bestremedy
for preserving and strengthening health, and against
many diseases, particularly the contagious. We may in
this place make a few remarks on
SEA BATHING.
This is a very important subject, and has been highly
extolled by the faculty as a remedy for the cure of
many diseases, and as preserving and improving health.
Unfortunately, very little attention is paid by the
majority of medical men to its importance, for want of
time and opportunity in some, and total and wanton
neglect in others. Forming, as it does, a considerable
auxiliary to the Water-cure, I hesitate the less to
present my readers with my views on the subject,
founded on practice and experience during my residence
at Ramsgate.
Who, among those who frequent our shores, has not
been impressed with the manifold influences which the
sea has upon the heart and spirits ? and who, in behold­
ing its vastness and expanse, is not delighted at its
grandeur ? If these impressions arise on beholding it,
they are heightened, and particularly in a physical point
SEA BATHING. 115
of view, on coming in contact with the element. By
the beating of the waves, and constant renewing of the
water, it strengthens, animates, excites, and enlivens in
a higher degree than any other kind of bath. The
whole system is stimulated by the strong beating and
shock of the waves; much tone is given to the nerves;
and the proper circulation of the blood is promoted.
The free air and scope for action add materially to its
advantages: it differs, however, in the following points
from river water. By the considerable quantity of salty
particles it contains; by the stronger pressure of the
water produced through the saline substances; by the
undulation of the waves, electric in their influence; by
the temperature, which, according to careful exami­
nation, is, in the height of summer, proved to be lower,
(55° to 65° Fahrenheit,) but also more equal than river
water; and by the sea air, containing not only salty
particles, but muriatic acid.
The best time for the ifse of sea-baths is from May
to the end of October. One bath a day is generally
sufficient, either before breakfast or two hours after, as
has already been mentioned. Persons whose nerves
and skin are very sensitive will do well to have tepid
baths first, and gradually accustom themselves to colder
ones before they bathe in the open sea; frictions with a
coarse towel should be used in these preparatory wash­
ings. Damp and foggy weather is not favourable for
sea-bathing, and it had better not be resorted to on such
days. For all other necessary rules we refer the reader
h 2
116 SEA BATHING.
to the last article on cold baths, which are equally appli­
cable to sea-bathing.
To search more particularly into the effects of sea­
bathing, we must consider its salty particles which act
as a powerful stimulant on the surface of the skin, as
the glowing sensation and the redness produced testify.
The effect of these saline substances is not confined to
the surface of the skin merely, but penetrates the
organism, as by the activity of the absorbing vessels
these substances are partially assimilated with the fluids.
It is through this, that sea baths become a highly
powerful solvent of constipations and hardening of the
glands, and even have the property of improving a
faulty admixture of the fluids. We must further con­
sider that in the greater pressure of sea water compared
to river water, as in the greater power of the waves, we
find the cause of its so remarkably enlivening effects on
the nerves. By the lower temperature of the sea the
muscular fibres become contracted and braced, and the
whole organism strengthened. Notwithstanding the
lower temperature, the risk of catching cold is much
less in the sea than in the river, which is attributable to
the salty particles, by which the activity of the skin is
raised, and more warmth generated in the body. The
animal and vegetable substances contained in the sea no
doubt also act beneficially on the whole system, to
which we must add the bracing properties of the sea
breezes, eulogized so much by the ancients. It is a
fact founded on experience, that the inhabitants of the
EXTERNAL APPLICATION OF COLD WATER. 117
sea coast generally enjoy excellent health, and attain
a good old age. We thus find sea bathing to be one
of the most active remedies for strengthening the skin
and muscles, for diminishing the excitability of the
nerves and dissolving hardening of the glands. For
the preservation of health, it is therefore highly com­
mendable* Sea bathing is also very beneficial in
checking and curing disease; caution in its use, how­
ever, is not only necessary, but must be urgently en­
joined. The shock to the system in nervous affections,
where properly guided, is very beneficial; it should not
be too great where too much torpor exists, or much
active inflammation, for we must recollect, a steady and
active reaction becomes our aim. Sea bathing will be
found of the greatest service in cases based upon want
of nervous energy, or general relaxation of the system ;
in chronic nervous diseases, epilepsy, St. Vitus’s dance,
hysteria, hypochrondriasis, involuntary emissions, weak­
ness of the eyes, skin diseases, scrofula, rickets, diseases
incidental to females, such as flueurs blanches, chlorosis,
&c., in liver affections and diseases of the kidneys, and
likewise in cases of consumption it is also highly useful;
but neither irritation nor inflammation of an active
character must be present, or the worst consequences
might ensue. We will now conclude this part of the
subject with a few hints as to the
EXTERNAL APPLICATION OF COLD WATER IN
INFANCY AND OLD AGE.
It has already been stated how necessary it is to use
children to water drinking; the external use of cold
water should also begin in childhood, but much modi­
fied, for I cannot coincide with those who recommend
infants to be bathed in cold water almost as soon as
bom. The new-born baby, accustomed as it has been
to a very warm, congenial temperature, requires, for
some time after birth, a warm and well-regulated tem­
perature, and can only be inured to colder treatment
with the utmost caution, and by very slow degrees; the
suckling infant therefore does not require for the first
three months cold water as an external ablution. I
would recommend tepid ablutions and baths as being
more fit, and which I know to be very salutary.
The child should, immediately after birth, be bathed
in lukewarm water, which equals new milk just drawn
from the cow, in temperature at about 90° Fahrenheit.
Similar baths should be applied daily during the first
three months; morning is the best hour, but not im­
mediately on waking, or after taking nourishment; one
or two minutes* duration for the bath is quite.sufficient.
The child must then be dried quickly and carefully,
and dressed warmly to prevent its taking cold; much
friction should not be used, but the moisture gradually
and perfectly absorbed by the application of a piece of
soft linen.
It is best to take fresh spring water, adding a suf­
ficient quantity of warm to raise it to the required
temperature. After the first three montlis, the infant
may be very gradually used to cooler water, and by
slow degrees to the cool baths. In the eighth or ninth
118 EXTERNAL APPLICATION OF COLD WATER
IN INFANCY AND OLD AGE. 119
year, river or sea baths may be resorted to ; and quite
cold water used for ablutions.
For very advanced age, cold washings and baths are
likewise not recommendable. Where the due warmth
and energy of life is diminishing, where the skin be­
comes drier and stiffer, tepid baths are more desirable
for preserving life. They maintain the natural warmth,
promote all the secretions, particularly of the skin, and
diminish, by replacing the deficient moisture, the stiff­
ness of the joints and hardening of the organs. Cold
baths withdraw the warmth of life from old persons,
not for a few minutes, as with the young, but per­
manently, there not being sufficient power to resist the
influence of the cold. Where the vital power is al­
ready too much exhausted, the forcing of the blood
upon the inner and more important organs by cold
baths may prove fatal. Of course, there are some
constitutions which have naturally acquired such energy
as to have greater power in old age, than many young
persons of the present day. Such may use the cold
baths with advantage in later days; and it is to be
hoped that more attention will henceforth be paid to
the physical education of children to enable them to
pass through life in health, enjoy a robust old age, and
obey nature’s last call without murmuring and without
pain.
PART IV.
HYDROTHERAPEUTIC OPERATIONS.
PREFATORY REMARKS.
I n fever as well as in most clironic diseases, water is
the most suitable beverage. Every state of fever is a
morbidly increased process of life, and all fevers begin
with cold, followed by heat, which generally, sooner or
later, ends in perspiration. The feeling of cold is fre­
quently a mere shiver, often however, very chilling in
its effects. The circulation of the blood and the
breathing are quickened, and the pulse therefore beats
faster than in health. The natural consequence of the
increased circulation of the fluids is an accelerated de­
struction of the solids and evaporation of the fluid parts,
and therefore gradual emaciation of the sufferer. The
appetite is mostly lost, but thirst is more or less great.
The happy termination of fevers is generally mani­
fested by various secretions and excretions; this process
is called the crisis, which usually consists in critical
bleedings, perspiration, urine, and faeces.
It is very necessary for a favourable issue of fevers to
satisfy and quench the parching tliirst of the patient,
PREFATORY REMARKS. 121
for critical perspiration and urine can only be brought
about by a sufficiency of moisture in the body. The
thirst of feverish patients is therefore the voice of na­
ture and must be attended to ; the ancients knew this
when they said, in fevers, “ one must drink or die.”
The question now is, Which is the best beverage in
fevers ? The faculty order all manner of artificial pre­
parations, such as effervescing drinks, cooling acids,
various sorts of teas, &c. These remedies occasionally
answer well enough; but in most cases they become
quite a torment to the invalid, and he pants for a
draught of fresh spring water, which is generally denied
to him, although it is the only suitable beverage. Galen
gave his fever patients as much cold water to drink as
they wished for, arguing that it diminishes the internal
heat, strengthens the solid parts, and carries off the
morbid humours by perspiration, urine, &c. Fresh
cold water is therefore the best drink for fever patients,
because it moderates the heat, diminishes the quickness
of the breathing and the pulse, promotes evaporation
by the skin, and produces refreshing sleep. The patient
may drink as often and as much as he pleases; but it
is preferable to drink in small quantities, so as not to
oppress the stomach too much; this deserves to be par­
ticularly noted during the cold shiver.
From our remarks in another place as to the effects
of water drinking in health, we may infer that cold
water is also most salutary in chronic diseases, nay, has
of itself a curative effect: by its cooling, refreshing
122 SWEATING IN THE DRY BLANKET.
qualities it becomes a real remedy in diseases of the
blood system, determination of blood to the various
parts, haemorrhage, and in nervous diseases it is in­
valuable from its soothing and strengthening effects.
It is further of most beneficial influence by its attenu­
ating properties and power to increase the secretions
in diseases of the alimentary canal, which are often the
consequence of a thickening of the fluids and retention
of vitiated matter.
I cannot conclude these remarks without a few words
on the use or abuse of mineral waters. We know the
good effects of some mineral springs in many chronic
affections, and that many owe their restoration to health
to their use; but we cannot deny that it is one of the
fashions of the day to visit the spas for the “ dolce far
niente,” the many diversions to be found there. Let
such free their minds from tormenting cares at home,
at the same time drinking plentifully of fresh spring
water and living otherwise temperately, and the chances
are they will find quite as much, if not more relief,
than from the boasted spas.
Many chronic affections will yield to regular and
temperate living upon the principles laid down in the
course of this work, aided by the free use of our own
pure and excellent springs.

SWEATING IN THE DRY BLANKET.
Several hours of the day are generally spent in this
process, and few dispense with it,
A large, thick, coarse blanket, measuring seven feet
by eight, is spread upon the mattress, which is made of
straw. The patient then lies down upon his back at
full length, naked ; the bath servant immediately wraps
one side of the blanket round him, tucking it well
under the body; he then draws the other side over
tightly, fastening it about the shoulders and feet, so as
to exclude the atmospheric air. Over this is placed
a down bed, which is tucked under the body, so that
the figure resembles an Egyptian mummy; sometimes
a counterpane is placed over all. The invalid remains
in the blanket until perspiration has continued the
required time.
When the sweating is complete, the servant removes
the coverings, unwraps the blanket at the feet, damp­
ing these and the face with cold water ; he then puts
on the patient’s feet a pair of straw slippers, and con­
ducts him to the cold bath which, at Grafenberg, is
frequently down three flights of stairs; or the invalid
is put into the half-bath; in this case it is brought
into the chamber and prepared there. After remaining
in the bath the prescribed time, the patient is well
rubbed dry, dresses quickly, and walks out for exercise.
A straw mattress is used in the sweating process,
because the straw can be removed and replaced by
124 SWEATING IN THE DRY BLANKET*
fresh, as often as necessary ; a feather bed or horse­
hair mattress would absorb too much perspiration, and
could not so conveniently or cheaply be exchanged ;
besides which, it would be both offensive and un­
healthy.
The sweating, in some instances, takes place to such
an extent that it penetrates through the mattress and
drips on the floor.
Those who perspire with difficulty have extra co­
vering placed upon them, and the head sometimes en­
veloped likewise, the face only being left exposed.
They should rub their feet together and make such
gentle movements as they are capable of by rubbing
the body with their hands. The time necessary for
the requisite perspiration is generally from one to three
hours, according to the malady; so that the patient is
enabled to sleep part of this tim e; and, as the wrap­
ping up generally takes place about five o’clock in the
morning, he is not deprived of his usual or necessary
quantum of rest. In some cases, a urinal is placed
in bed, so that the invalid may not be either dis­
turbed from the sweating process, or inconvenienced in
consequence.
The heat of the body, and particularly the skin,
having risen to a high degree, perspiration commences,
when the windows are ordered to be thrown open,
and the patient, from time to time refreshed with a
little cold spring water, which he sucks through a
bent glass tube, one end being placed in his mouth,
SWEATING IN THE DRY BLANKET. 125
the other in a glass of water, to spare and cool the
lungs, to facilitate the circulation of the blood, and
promote perspiration at the same time. The head
and shoulders should be well raised at the time of
wrapping up, to render the position as comfortable as
possible; this is easily effected at Grafenberg through
the management of the straw mattresses, which are di­
vided into three separate ones, partly for this purpose, and
partly for shifting about and drying after each sweat­
ing. The dry heat of the blanket, at the commencement
of using it, is disagreeable, but the uneasy feeling soon
vanishes, and on the symptoms of perspiration ap­
pearing, the whole body feels light and relieved.
The time for sweating entirely depends on the constitu­
tion, disease, and other circumstances; beginners take
from lialf-an-hour to two hours, but many lie three
or four hours, especially those afflicted with syphilitic-
mercurial diseases, gout, &c. The surest sign of the
sufficiency of sweating, is the appearance of moisture
on the face, and if continued beyond this, an uneasy
feeling, with heaviness and pain in the head, suc­
ceeds; this point should never be exceeded, and the
moment it sets in the unpacking should take place.
Some imagine that by forcing the sweating an hour
or so more, the cure will be accelerated, but injury
and delay of the cure are certain consequences. Those
who are subject to determination of blood to the head
have wet umschlags or compressers applied round it,
and renewed from time to time while under the process
126 SWEATING IN THE DRY BLANKET*
of sweating. Some, too, must place wet compresses
on any painful local affection, as open crisis, &c.,
previous to getting into the blanket. Persons who
suffer from internal congestions of blood should drink
a glass of fresh water, in order to withstand the forcing
of the blood upon the inner organs when in the cold
bath, and it is necessary to avoid exposure to draughts
of cold air in going to it. The effect of the cold bath,
after the skin has been put in a proper state of ex­
citement by this process of sweating, is to strengthen
the whole body.
Caution and circumspection are necessary—the time
varies considerably; if the invalid is weak, he is to
sweat little at first, once a day; after a short time
twice a day, morning and afternoon, for a short period
only, taking moderate exercise previous to, as well
as after the operation; if it weaken him, it is dimin­
ished for a time; the same if perspiration is too easily
excited, and flows profusely—as with sensitive tem­
peraments and weak skins. Various causes induce
the greater or less profusion of perspiration: rheumatic
and arthritic subjects sweat easily and profusely; cor­
pulent bodies more than spare ones; staunch water-
drinkers more than those who drink sparingly, weakly
persons with a tender, delicate white skin, sooner and
more profusely than the robust, and more than those of
a phlegmatic temperament; with those who are afflicted
with piles, perspiration is brought about with greater
difficulty, and is of shorter duration than with gouty
SWEATING IN THE DRY BLANKET* 127
subjects. Exercise immediately before being packed
up facilitates the sweating very much; when the at­
mosphere is moderately warm and not too dry, it is
sooner promoted, and is slowest in stormy and damp
weather. Artificial heating of the body by warm
drink or otherwise is never allowed; the heat must
always be produced by the proper activity of the vital
functions.
In the beginning of the cure, the perspiration is clear
and bright; but in proportion as morbid humours are
dissolved and drawn to the surface, it assumes a different
consistency. In rheumatic and gouty affections par­
ticularly, it often gets clammy and sticky, of a yellow
dark colour, and fetid acid smell. It is a remarkable
appearance and very important in a pathological point
of view, that where much medicine has been taken, the
sweat of the individual assumes an odour similar to
those medicaments. Such sweats are called critical.
Some patients undergo the sweating process daily for
months together without getting thinner, which may
seem paradoxical enough; but the facts are incontro­
vertible, as the thousands of persons who have been
under treatment at Grafenberg, amply testify. The
modus operandi, however, is very different to the means
hitherto in use with the faculty. Whilst they pre­
scribe warm baths, gruel, hot tea, &c., in conjunction
with powerful medicinal sudorifics, besides calling into
aid the heated atmosphere of the rooms, Priessnitz
and his followers attain the same end by the simple
128 SWEATING IN THE DRY BLANKET.
and safe process described, giving the patient fresh air
and water, both very desirable. "Whilst under medi­
cinal treatment, the stomach, intestines, and blood,
are heated in an unnatural manner; we find that, by
Priessnitz’s method, the proper heat of the body only
is called into activity, the organic heat is concentrated,
and the inner organs, the lungs especially, are refreshed
by the cold water and kept at a proportionately low
temperature. This is the reason why the body does
not become enfeebled, nay, on the contrary, all the
organs increase in strength, notwithstanding these
profuse perspirations. A further contrast between the
two modes, is the already pointed out cold ablution or
bath, invariably succeeding the sweating; the secretion
is thereby duly washed from the body, which is greatly
refreshed by the operation.
W e find an undue action of the skin in almost every
disorder; this should be properly regulated, in order to
render that organ fit for the elimination of morbid
humours. The sweating and bathing, therefore, go
hand in hand; without the former, the skin would
become too compact, dry and brittle, apt to chap; with­
out the latter, it would become too much weakened and
relaxed. We have elsewhere spoken of the skin, and
stated that the most subtile part of a disease is often
eliminated by it, and there are many diseases that yield
to this simple process only. Invalids have been known
to arrive at Grafenberg quite emaciated, scarcely able to
sit up, much less walk, and yet have increased in

strength and bulk under the sweating treatment, gradu­
ally and cautiously administered.
THE WET SHEET.
The application of the wet sheet is essentially the same
as the blanket, butis used with a variety of intentions. A
sheet of somewhat coarse linen, of about two yards long,
and one and a half wide, is well soaked in cold spring
water ; it is then thrown over a pole and wrung ;—
after which it is spread over the blanket, and the patient
lying down on it, is wrapped up first in the sheet, and
then in the blanket, and covered over as before men­
tioned. The first sensation is a slight shiver, which is
rather unpleasant and disagreeable, and probably con­
tinues for two or three minutes, after which a pleasing
change comes over the spirits; a calmness and feeling of
ease ensue; the whole system is soothed and tranquil­
lized. This agreeable change commences and increases
with the warmth, and if continued for about half an
hour, the repose is so comforting that the patient is loth
to be disturbed. A coarse sheet is preferred for two
reasons, the first is, that it remains moist longer than a
fine one; the second is, that it acts in a slight degree as
a counter irritant to the skin. The patient generally
remains in the sheet until sufficiently wanned; this
usually occupies half an hour to an hour, when the time
for bathing approaches. Sometimes the sheet is replaced
by fresh ones, if it dries too soon ; when this is the case,
i
130 THE WET SHEET.
it must be effected quickly, a fresh sheet being ready, so
that the least possible time may be lost.
These wet sheets are great soothers and sedatives, and
particularly useful in fevers, inflammations, &c., to allay
pain and heat. A case of violent catarrh, accompanied
with fever, which occurred when I was at Grafenberg,
was perfectly cured in an hour by wet sheets, a fresh
one applied every ten minutes, an abreiben, or wet sheet
bath, completing the cure. These “ abreibens” are fre­
quently resorted to, for weakly patients, after being
wrapped up in the wet sheet as described, and answer the
purpose of a bath in a modified degree j they are fre­
quently used two or three times daily. Sometimes per­
spiration cannot be elicited without the wet sheet, which
stimulates the skin to increased action* The soothing
and beneficial effect of the wet sheet is so great in a
variety of cases, that if but once tried by any one, the
fear of danger—if any fear exist—will be obviated,—the
more so when I state that some persons at Grafenberg
sleep in wet sheets almost nightly, enjoy good rest, and
are fresh and joyous in the morning. Before going into
the sheet or blanket, and before taking a bath of any
kind, the body should be in a proper state of tempera­
ture. When the body is cold, the cold baths cannot
produce the proper reaction, and may do harm. At the
risk of being deemed prolix, I state particularly, in order
to prevent error and consequent mishaps, that the body
must be at a proper temperature, but not hot; I mean
an easy, comfortable feeling of warmth. After violent

exertion, the person must be cooled by a gentle walk,
and then a moderate degree of rest; lying in bed a
short time, if cold, will produce the required warmth.
It is very different, plunging into a cold bath of from
35° to 50° Fahr., after sweating in this way, to doing
so after sweating by the artificial means resorted to for
that purpose ; for as explained, in the one case it would
be dangerous, whilst in the other, the body being kept
cool and refreshed, the absence of all danger is clearly
manifest: this is corroborated by the numbers daily
undergoing the operation, and frequently twice a day at
Grafenberg and elsewhere,—indeed the cold bath after
a good sweat, is a real luxury. When unaccustomed to
the bath, going to it for the first time, dripping with
perspiration, one is apt to cast a suspicious look at the
water; but off with the blanket and sheet, and after
wetting the head and chest, plunge bravely in, and
enjoyment will be the reward.
BATHS AND ABLUTIONS.
THE WANNENBAD OR FULL-BATH.
We were unconsciously led to speak of this bath in the
preceding article, the two being so much combined, it was
almost impossible to speak of the one, without alluding
to the other. Under the head of cold baths, we gave
some general rules which will apply in their hydro-
therapeutic use here.
i 2
132 THE FULL-BATH.
The largest bath of this kind at Grafenberg, is ten
feet diameter, and four feet deep; the rest are consider­
ably smaller, and most of them sunk nearly upon a
level with the flooring, wliich is exceedingly inconve­
nient, on account of the stooping preparatory to taking
the bath. Fresh water is constantly flowing from the
upper mountains into these baths, which is a great ad­
vantage. The average time of using them is about
one or two minutes, but there are a few persons who
remain in five or six.
Novices merely plunge in, hurrying out as quickly as
possible. Priessnitz enforces the necessity of every one
making use of these baths, wetting the head and chest
before the general immersion, to guard against any
undue action.
The temperature of these baths in summer varies
from 42° to 50° Fahr., in winter from 32° to 36° Fahr.;
in the middle of November last, the temperature was as
low as 34° Fahr.; ice began to form ridges on the sides
of the baths, but all plunged in with as much delight as
ever, emerging from their blanket or sheet, either of
these operations always preceding the cold bath, for the
purpose of relieving the internal organs, and tempering
the surface of the body. Some of the patients, diminishing
the extent of their treatment preparatory to quitting the
establishment, took the cold bath immediately on getting
out of bed, dispensing with the wet sheet or blanket,
their cure being either complete, the rigours of winter
too disagreeable, or too great for their constitutions, or
THE HALF-BATH. 133
being desirous to join and enjoy their Christinas party at
home, and exhibit their improved health and spirits,
as the case might be, delighted as much in it as they
regretted the time when they would be deprived of the
luxury.
Priessnitz and all his family take a cold bath, winter
and summer, immediately after rising in the morning,
and Mrs. Priessnitz continues them throughout her
pregnancy.
The duration of the cold bath greatly depends upon
the heat of the body arising from the perspiration: cold
water cannot withdraw excessive heat from the body in
less than two or three minutes, and the greater the dif­
ference between the temperature of the body and that
of the water, the greater the effect of the cold, and the
better the reaction.
Much activity, and friction of the whole body with
the palms of the hands, whilst in the cold bath, is strictly
enjoined and should never be omitted, as the effect will
be more salutary.
THE HALF-BATH.
This bath is very much after the make and fashion of
one of our usual full-length domestic chamber baths,
such as are in general use, and is mostly applied as a
preparatory one. The water used in it seldom exceeds
six inches in depth, and is generally used tepid,
134 THE WET SHEET-BATH.
thougli the temperature is often made to vary in the dif­
ferent purposes to which it is applied. The patient
sits in this bath, and is well rubbed by the baddiener,
assisting himself as much as he is able, frequently
wetting his hands for that purpose; the time usually
occupied is from five to ten minutes, but in some cases
it is quite uncertain. Sometimes it is used alternately
with the cold bath, commencing with the tepid, plung­
ing into the cold, and returning to the tepid; thus
novices are prepared for the full-bath. Those who are
disabled from going to the cold bath, are supplied with
a half-bath in their chamber.
Priessnitz makes this his favourite bath in the cure of
fevers generally, and with, astonishing good effect; he
also uses it with the opposite intent, namely, to create
a fever, in order that he may bring about a crisis by
drawing the humours to the surface; under both these
considerations, he not unfrequently keeps the invalid in
this bath for hours together, thus he renders a very gen­
tle, mild bath, one of the most powerful. Its advantages
are too great to speak of in this brief space; suffice it to
say, it will be found one of the most essential in the
hydrotherapeutic operations.
THE ABREIBEN, OR WET SHEET-BATH.
This is another substitute for the cold bath when cir­
cumstances do not warrant the latter, and an exceedingly
THE DOUC1I E-BATH. 135
delightful and refreshing one it is. A sheet is well
saturated with cold water, but not dripping, which the
baddiener so places over the patient (who stands in the
middle of the room,) that the whole of the person is
enveloped; both parties commence rubbing, the servant
standing behind, making use of both hands by laying hold
of a fold of the sheet, which he uses as a housemaid
would her scrubbing brush, and which is continued for
about five or ten minutes; afterwards this is exchanged
for a dry one, which is used in a similar manner; by
this time a very agreeable warmth and comfortable state
of feeling ensues, which is kept up by subsequent exer­
cise in the open air.
I can strongly recommend this as a mode of preserving
the general system against change of temperature, thus
fortifying the body against attacks of cold, and as a
means of purifying the skin. The best time for the
application is immediately upon getting out of bed in
the morning.
THE DOUCHE-BATH.
There are several douches at Grafenberg and Freiwal-
dau; latterly a very commodious one has been erected at
Grafenberg for winter use, consisting of one large wait­
ing room with a stove in it, two distinct inner chambers
which further lead to two others, into which the douche
is playing. This is a comfortable accommodation for
doucliing, but it has, like all the rest of them, a
136 THE DOUCHE-BATH.
great disadvantage in regard to its locality, being placed
in a dell of the forest, which is troublesome and incon­
venient to arrive at for those not strong on their legs.
All these douches are half an hour’s walk' from the
dwelling, which is said to be requisite on account of
insuring a proper degree of warmth, previous to sub­
mitting oneself to them; this part of the business could
just as well be effected by having them close to the
premises, for the patients would regard the necessary
advice in this respect, just as much as in other cases of
the same importance.
The water is conducted from the upper mountains
to these buildings through wooden pipes, from the ter­
mination of which is attached a square wooden spout,
from whence the water falls perpendicularly in a column
varying from one to three inches, and in height from
ten to twenty feet.
The douche is one of the most powerful baths there
is, its effects on the organism are great, exciting vital
action in all its functions, partly by its mechanical force
and partly by its temperature; it should therefore be
used with discretion, particularly when a crisis is ap­
proaching or apprehended, for it may then be requisite
to discontinue it altogether for a time. Its action is
so great that it seems to move the very inmost recesses
of the body and excite its morbid humours to the sur­
face, and thus frees the system from impurities
which, in all probability, have been accumulating for
years. But notwithstanding its general good effects,
THE DOUCHE-BATH. 137
great caution in its use is highly requisite; for by
exposing oneself too long to its action, it may prove
injurious, particularly with sensitive constitutions.
Exercise must be taken before douching, in order to
create a comfortable degree of warmth, so as to offer
more resistance to the cold, and thus excite a better
reaction and proper energy of the body; a glass of
water taken before and after the douche is an excel­
lent auxiliary to this; but a good rubbing when dry­
ing, and walking afterwards, is indispensable, and must,
on no account, be omitted.
On entering the bath, wash head and chest, then
fearlessly go under the stream, and receive it on the
shoulders, neck, and back; then uniting the hands
over the head, the stream falling upon them will
descend like a shower bath all over the body. By
means of poles which are fixed conveniently, the po­
sition may be changed in numberless ways to expose
all parts of the body, the region of the stomach and
abdomen always excepted. The duration of the
douche varies from two or three minutes to fifteen.
In summer, it is frequently taken twice a day; in
winter, five minutes is considered a long time. On
leaving the douche, a slight cold is felt, more or less
according to the temperature of the atmosphere; but
a feeling of warmth is soon manifested, the circulation
of the blood becomes more active, and all the organs
of the body assume a high degree of activity.
The douche is beneficial in strengthening the general
138 LOCAL BATHS.
functions, and promoting a proper circulation of the
blood; it is serviceable through its searching action on
the body, by stirring up vitiated humours, otherwise
firm in their stronghold, to the surface of the skin,
and expelling them in the form of crises, &c. It is
especially useful in long standing sprains, weakness
of the extremities, and general atony of the muscular
system, arthritic cases, and rheumatism. About two
hours after breakfast is considered the best time for
douching; but many resort to it before that meal.
LOCAL BATHS.
Though local, these baths are general in their in­
fluence ; the most prominent is
THE SITTING BATH, OR SITZ-BATH.
We are indebted to Priessnitz for the invention of
this bath. Few of the Grafenbergers escape the sitz-
bath once a day; some have it twice or thrice daily,
from its so much esteemed importance. It consists of
a round tub, very much resembling a washing tub, of
about sixteen inches in diameter, with a portion cut
out from one side, about one-third of the circumfer­
ence, which forms the front part, so that it becomes
convenient for bending the legs over it, and placing
the feet on the ground, whilst the back, being higher,
serves as a support; they are all nearly of a height,
THE SITZ-BATH. 139
but differ in circumference, according to the size of
the party using them. Fresh water is poured in them
until it reaches an elevation of about four inches, in
which the invalid sits for a limited period, varying
from ten minutes to an hour or more, according to
circumstances. Only a small quantity of water is
made use of in this, as well as in some of the other
shallow baths, that reaction may be sooner effected;
for if too large a quantity of this element were to be
employed, the consequence would, in some cases, be
a determination of blood to the inner organs, from the
body not giving out sufficient caloric to heat it to an
equal temperature with itself, whereas, on the other
hand, a small portion quickly attains the heat of the
blood, and so produces a quicker reaction.
The patient, whilst sitting in the bath, is covered
with a sheet or cloak, and must not remain passive,
reading, as erroneously represented in some of the
plates; but must use his hands, applying as much
friction as possible to the abdomen, &c.
The feeling in taking this bath for the first time
is far from pleasant; but its important action in
drawing the caloric down soon becomes manifest by
the water becoming of the same temperature.
The effects of this bath are highly beneficial in a
great number of diseases, particularly of the stomach
and bowels, removing obstinate constipation with
little or no difficulty. Also in all disorders of the
generative system, it will prove highly efficacious.
110 THE SITZ-B4TU.
One or two sitz-baths, of from ten to fifteen minutes*
duration, daily, will act as a powerful tonic; and where
strengthening of the parts is the object, nothing can
be better. It should, however, not be taken immedi­
ately before going to bed, being too exciting.
Morning and afternoon are the best times; a walk
should follow, water being taken slowly and in small
quantities during and after the bath. In diseases of
the womb, it sometimes acts quite in a miraculous
manner; the profession may well be astonished and
incredulous, until they test the truth of it. Irregular
menstruation is speedily improved, and cured in the
course of a short time by its use. It checks the too
abundant flow by its strengthening and contracting
property; and on the other hand, by stimulating and
adding tone to the organs, promotes it, if suppressed.
Leucorrhcea yields effectually to its judicious appli­
cation, combined with other parts of the treatment,
comparatively in a very short time.
It is a potent agent against diarrhoea, dysentery, and
cholera. For costiveness there is no better remedy, and
the exhaustion consequent upon taking medicinal reme­
dies is entirely obviated. For piles a certain cure
succeeds a persevering use of the sitz-bath. But like­
wise in diseases of the heart, chest, liead-aches, &c.,
these baths are very effectual, and form a most impor­
tant point in the treatment of maladies by the Water-
cure.
SOLE AND FOOT BATHS. 141
THE SOLE-BATIIS.
These are taken in a small tub affording room for the
feet; the water is about an inch deep, cold or tepid, and
applied for short or long periods, the same as the foot­
baths, but they act in a much milder degree*
THE FOOT-BATHS*
In this bath the water reaches over the ancles; rub­
bing the feet together or with wet hands is essentially
necessary; its effect is derivative, counteracting or
drawing down inflammations, &c. This is an important
doctrine, and we find Priessnitz always endeavouring to
lead the morbid humours to parts which are less subject
to derangement.
These baths are exceedingly useful in relieving affec­
tions of the head and eyes, and particularly serviceable
in curing cold feet, which is usually accomplished by
putting the feet in cold water for ten or fifteen minutes,
once or twice a day, rubbing them the whole time as
already stated, and taking exercise afterwards. Before
the application of these baths, the feet should always be
made warm by friction or walking.
Corns and bunions will yield to this treatment after
removing the horny or hard cuticle ; wet soothing ban­
dages being nightly applied.
142 THE HEAD-BATH, ETC.
THE HEAD-BATH.
This is taken in a kind of brown earthenware baking-
dish, which at Grafenberg is the wash-handbasin for
those who choose to use one. When about to be made
use of, it contains water to the depth of two inches, and
the most convenient place for using it is most assuredly
the sofa; the patient, lying at full length, places the
back of his head in the bath for about ten or fifteen
minutes; then alternately the sides for five minutes
more. It is found very useful in chronic affections of
the eyes, rheumatism in the head, deafness, convulsions,
&c.; and is particularly serviceable in infantile disorders
of the brain, but is always used in conjunction with
other remedies appertaining to the water treatment.
THE ARM AND LEG BATHS.
These are taken in narrow tubs suitable for the pur­
pose : the arms and legs are immersed, and are chiefly
used for allaying inflammation of the parts, and promot­
ing external abscesses in diseases of the joints of long
standing. Their duration is sometimes considerable, an
hour and upwards. For allaying violent pain in the
hands, and drawing off any inflammation there, the
elbow is kept immersed in cold water for half-an-hour
or more, according to the state of the suffering, thus
acting as a derivative.
THE EYE AND MOUTH BATHS. 143
THE EYE-BATH.
Small glasses made for the purpose, filled with water
varying in temperature, are applied to the open eyes,
and continued for about five minutes. The action of
these baths is materially assisted by rubbing the forehead
and temples with the hand at liberty, dipped in cold
water. They will be found beneficial in inflammation
of the eyes, and other painful affections of the parts*
Those who study and write a great deal, who find their
eyes getting weak and painful, the head hot, &c., will
do well to take these baths twice a day for five minutes,
adding a sitz-bath of twenty minutes once a day.
The use of snuff-taking may be quite superseded by
sniffing up a little cold water several times a day, and
ejecting i t ; the effect is quite as good, and a bad habit
may thus be got rid of.
THE MOUTH-BATH.
This may not be considered a correct heading: but
for want of a better term, I beg leave to denominate it
such. The internal cavity of the mouth and throat is
repeatedly washed and gargled with cold water, which
is ejected as often as it gets warm.
Dr. Granichstadten, of Vienna, relates the case of
Anton Pauly, a merchant of Presburg, who, for the
sake of humanity, made it public in the Presburg

Journal, *
*^Ehrenlese" of 10th August, 1832. He had
been a sufferer for twenty-five years with pains about the
chest, spasms, and constipation, to which, in later years,
were added sleepless nights and loss of appetite. All
the prescribed remedies were of no avail; new complaints
arose, and his pains increased; deafness, acute pains in
the joints, eruptions on the skin, and bleeding of the
gums and tongue. Under these unfavourable circum­
stances, he resorted to cold water for relief, drinking of
it freely, and using it as a wash for the mouth. He
applied it in this manner in the morning, after dinner,
and in the evening, using it perseveringly to the amount
of ten pints a day for eight weeks, and he had the sa­
tisfaction of seeing all his disorders gradually disappear,
although between forty and fifty years of age.
This bath is very serviceable in inflammations of the
mouth, gums, See. ; it should, as an act of cleanliness,
be used after meals, which preserves the teeth. Very
cold water should be avoided immediately after hot food
or drink, being injurious; and it may in time spoil the
enamel of the teeth.
INJECTIONS.
Injections of water are used up the nostrils for
scrofula, and other affections of the nose; into the ears
for deafness, &c.; and into other cavities of the body,
for a variety of purposes, with the most satisfactory
result.
145
THE UMSCHLAGS, OR WET BANDAGES.
These bandages form an important adjunct to the cure,
and are made use of in three different ways with dis­
similar intentions. The first, or cold wet anti-inflamma­
tory compresses, have for a long time been used in sur­
gery : they consist of single pieces of linen well wetted
in fresh water, which are placed over the affected part
without pressing the water from them, in order that they
may cool the more by abstracting heat rapidly from the
part, by evaporation; hence their great use in active
inflammations, bruises, burns, scalds, &c. j they should
be renewed as often as they become warm.
The second, or soothing compress, is a piece of linen,
doubled several times and well saturated with water.
This is applied to the affected part, and covered with dry
linen, so as to exclude the atmospheric air. The mois­
ture contained in the linen is soon transformed by the
heat of the body into a vapour; the part, therefore, may
be said to be in a constant vapour bath: when hot,
it must be changed. It is useful for promoting suppura­
tion and discharge of ulcers, and serves as a sedative
in painful affections. It is often used conjointly with
sitz and foot baths.
The third kind is of quite an opposite character;
pieces of linen are soaked in water and well wrung out,
they are applied where required and covered with dry
linen, so as to protect the parts carefully from the action
K
146 THE WET BANDAGES.
of the atmospheric air; they should be changed as often
as they get dry.
It is a bandage of this kind that is worn round the
waist day and night by all patients, and is about three
yards long and one foot wide, a portion of which, just
enough to go round the body, is wetted, and well wrung
out; this is wrapped round the body closely, and as
closely covered over by the dry part, which is tied by
strings attached to its end. This bandage is singularly
efficacious in aiding digestion, and promoting the peri­
staltic motion of the intestines, very essential to insure a
proper action of the bowels.
No blister can draw better than these stimulating
bandages, perseveringly employed; they excite and
strengthen the part, and are particularly useful for
dyspeptic, scrofulous, gouty, rheumatic, and syphilitic
diseases. They are often applied near inflamed organs,
so as to dislodge the vitiated humours, by abstracting
heat from the neighbouring, and generating it under the
covered parts.
The most relaxed skin is brought into activity by the
application of the stimulating umschlag—if for the
whole body, in the shape of a wet sheet.
The compresses often assume various shades of colour,
especially when acting on parts where ulcers had pre­
viously existed; the water they are washed in, clearly
manifests a discharge through the skin, by the great dis­
coloration which takes place, and in some instances, by
the most nauseating effluvia. I have known new com-
THE WET BANDAGES. 147
presses to become thoroughly rotten in a short time from
% these exudations, a proof of the destroying effects of
these viscid and acrid humours.
Caution in their application is necessary; their effect
is warming and soothing when not wrung out too much,
and not remaining on too long; the time for changing
them should not be neglected, for before being quite
warmed they act in a cooling ; if quite dry, in a stimu­
lating manner.
I may remark, with regard to the material for these
compresses, &c., that fine linen shoilld not be used;
because it does not contain a sufficient quantity of mois­
ture, and in friction does not sufficiently stimulate the
skin. The compresses, however, to be used in ulcers,
or highly inflamed parts, should be finer, which
excite the parts in a much less degree than the coarse
linen.
PART V.
HYDROTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT OF
DISEASES.
FOUNDED PARTLY ON PERSONAL OBSERVATION, PARTLY ON THE
EXPERIENCE OF MANY EMINENT MEDICAL MEN ON THE CON­
TINENT, AND TUEIU DEDUCTIONS FROM SUCH EXPERIENCE.
I n the preceding parts we have descanted upon the
general principles of Hydrotherapia. We gave the
theoretic views of Priessnitz, and explained the manifold
ways in which he applies, and is capable of extending
his remedy. The present part shall be devoted to the
consideration of such diseases, as experience proves may
with advantage be treated upon the Priessnitz principles.
I will not in this place enter into a comparison between
the medical and the Hydrotherapeutic treatment. Time
only can prove the superiority of the latter, if not in all,
in most diseases.
The historical sketch in the beginning of this work
exhibits the great value which the ancients attached to
water, and the various ways in which they used i t ;
but none ever thought of combining and modifying its
application in such numberless ways; thereby super­
seding, to a vast extent, the use of our pharmacopoeia.
This was granted to Priessnitz, and through him will be
HYDROTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT. 149
handed down to posterity. It is through him we are
now enabled to treat and eradicate diseases with a simple
remedy—a gift of nature—with a natural process and a
due regard to the vital power.
Every organic life is limited, on the one hand by the
constant struggle of its eternal idea to reveal and main­
tain itself—and on the other, by the influence of the
outer world—an outward and an inward agent thus
form all and every manifestation of life.—The exter­
nal agent is formed by all that exists without the
sphere of organic life, and that effects this in a certain
degree. The internal agent, however, is the innate
cause of all development of life, the lasting idea of life,
and which is only developed in and by the influence of
the external agent. What reason acknowledges here
from general principles, experience fully confirms. All
special and definite actions in nature are brought about
by the alternate working of two opposite agents; there
is no magnetic, electric or chemical process, no solution,
no crystallization or cumbustion, unless two different
bodies—two substances—act and react upon each other.
What appertains to every process of nature is appli­
cable to the particular process of life, as the single
organization in which this exists, must, as part and
parcel of entire nature, submit to her laws. Life in the
individual is, therefore, not one power but two, opposed
to, and alternately acting on each other; and which,
forming as they do, the principle of life, may be called
vital power. The normal and harmonious, as well as
150 HYDROTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT
the abnormal moving of the functions of life, are pro­
duced by these two powers. Therefore to check an
abnormal diseased manifestation of life, and lead it on
in its development to the recovery of health, the exter­
nal agent must be called into play, and regulated so in
its influence on the internal one as to alter the product
of both, and reduce it to the normal state. All the
powers and functions of the organism, stand in such
close connexion, that it is only in their harmonious
and equal action we find health. The vital power
and the organs, therefore, are in constant alternate ac­
tion and re-action; the derangement of one organ argues
the derangement of all, and which to a certain extent
takes place, although we may not always perceive it.
The vital power being the result of the harmonious ac­
tion of all the functions of the organism, it is the first and
most important point to which attention must be paid in
the cure of disease. In the strengthening of, and ren­
dering the vital power predominant, lies the hope of
recovery. The disturbance of the equilibrium in any
one power will thus necessarily produce a change, either
by a direct mechanical outward attack on an organ, in
consequence of which the functions are changed, and
which reacts upon the vital power, or by attacks on the
vital power itself, thereby reacting on the outward or­
gans, and producing a change in the activity of their
functions.
This view is borne out by the fact of the happy re­
sults of Water-cures being always preceded by percep-
OF DISEASES. 151
tible secretions of humours. These critical appearances,
called crises, being the product of the struggle of the
vital power, can only occur when the organism is
strengthened, and the vital power, through this, increased
sufficiently to struggle with encroaching disease. The
extent of the vital power, which is always in exact
proportion to the more or less advanced diseased appear­
ances, determines the longer or shorter duration neces­
sary for the strengthening of the vital power, as also the
more or less violent critical struggle between health
and disease.
Two important questions must be decided in pro­
ceeding to the cure of disease by water: First, The
idiosyncrasy of diseased persons; and, secondly, What
diseases are suitablefor the treatment ?
As success can only be expected when the vital power
is still able to combat the encroachment of disease, or
capable of being recovered sufficiently to commence the
struggle, it follows that the solution to the first question
lies simply in the state of the patient’s strength. I f the
existing vital power be sufficiently strotig to bring about
a proper reaction by the stimulants applied, without
succumbing to these stimulants, there is a possibility of
success. Progressing disorganization, or continued ob­
struction of such organs, upon which the process of life
essentially depends, must cause life—the vital power—
to be depressed to such a degree as to render a recovery
impossible, if the functions of such organs cannot, in
part at least, devolve upon others. The vital power
152 HYDROTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT
can, under such circumstances, never attain its full
energy. Now, as the chance of success depends upon
this alone, we arrive at the answer of the second ques­
tion : What diseases are suitable for the water treat­
ment ? All advanced disorganizations of inner organs
are unfit for the treatment. The utmost that can gene­
rally be expected is a degree of alleviation of suffering,
and a moderate extension of the span of life by a judi­
cious dietetic use of water. Under this category would
come, consumption in its last stages, organic diseases of
the heart, far advanced chronic dropsy, cancer, &c.;
neither can internal organic malformation be removed by
the water treatment.
The practical solution of these important questions is
very difficult; experience, judgment, and talent are ne­
cessary. A due guiding of the vital power, or support
of it in its struggles to recover health, is the most essen­
tial point; and according to the disease, age, sex, and
constitution, the practitioner will have to employ the
anti-inflammatory, exciting or stimulating, strengthen­
ing, derivative, soothing Or revulsionary process; all
derived from the various combinations of the many
applications of water as Priessnitz practises it, and by
which he has saved hundreds from seemingly inevitable
death.
We shall now proceed to lay before our readers the
diseases which are advantageously treated by the Water-
cure ; but among the many disorders which the system
is highly calculated to remove, we cannot help, in con-
OF DISEASES. 153
eluding these remarks, to point out the so-called drug
diseases. These are maladies generated by the use or
abuse of medicines, particularly mercury, which entail a
train of sufferings, rendering life miserable and a burden
to the individual. Priessnitz found an eradicative
remedy for them in pure cold water. The fact is incon-
trovertibly proved by the hundreds and thousands cured
of such diseases at Grafenberg, and similar institutions:
who, given up as lost, were there restored to life, health,
and enjoyment. Were the Water treatment effectual in
nothing else, it and its founder would find honourable
place in the history of medicine: but the inference
should not be lost: remove the cause—the inundation
of patients with deleterious drugs—and the effect will
be, the immediate expunging of, at all events, one class
of diseases from our records. In proportion as our
wants and mode of living get simplified, we shall require
less of stimulants, and in proportion will disease and
suffering, till now advancing with the progressing state
of civilisation, be diminished.
N.B. I have made use of the word tepid, in speaking
of the temperature of water throughout this work, for
want of a more appropriate term, but do not mean it to
denote a temperature of 80° Fahrenheit, which is its
general signification. It must be understood as water
varying from 60° up to 80° Fahrenheit, according to
circumstances.

SECTION I.
Fever.
No other method of cure so soon obviates the endan­
gering of life in many malignant fever diseases as the
use of cold water, which, moreover, due caution being
exercised, leaves no bad consequences. Any doubts as
to the efficacy of the Water treatment in fevers, can be
at once removed by a short visit to Grafenberg, Priess-
nitz never failing in a case ; and further confirmation
will be found by reference to the accounts published by
our own countrymen, Currie, Wright, Jackson, &c., and
among the continental doctors, Reuss, Colbany, Frohlich,
Milius, &c.
Abstractedly considered, fever is not only a disease,
but also a result of the struggle between the vital
power and the inimical influences, external and internal,
which intercept the due and regular action of all the
functions of the organism to an extent sometimes endan­
gering life itself.
The struggle is manifested particularly in the blood
vessels, being the vital functions, but does not fail also
to draw the animal functions into the general struggle.
We may, therefore, define fever to be the exertion of
the whole vital power to render nugatory the attacks
on the organism, or on single parts thereof, and to guard
it against disease, or overcome it where these influences
have already taken place to an extent to cause disease.
FEVER. 155
Fever never can be local; it affects the whole body:
it may exist without any other visible affection, but no
disease is free from feverish appearances, however trifling.
The violence of fever will depend upon the violence of
the attack on the organism, and the extent of the resist­
ance capable of being offered by the vital power. The
effects of fever are as happy in the restoration of health,
as they are injurious, if this end, whatever the cause of
failure, be not attained.
We know from experience that in fevers certain
appearances, and their durations, occur and recur at
regular intervals; from this we make inferences and
deductions, regulating.our treatment accordingly.
In endeavouring to treat fever upon hydrotherapeutic
principles, we must note whether it is simple; that is,
such where its action is chiefly manifested in the vital
organs, the other organs of the body suffering in a more
subordinate and equalized degree; or whether it is com­
pound, namely, where the fever has a near reference to
some other disorder. Fever in the latter case often is
the consequence of such disorder; the signal, that the
vital power has collected all its energy to eject forcibly
the inimical influences from the organism, influences
which the organ attacked is unable to withstand. This
is frequently the case in fevers accompanying inflamma­
tions, catarrhal, nervous and gastric affections ; in
wounds, rheumatism, gout, &c., in which cases fever,
the vital power possessing sufficient energy, is the fore­
runner of a perfect cure.
156 SIMPLE FEVER*
In the treatment of fevers, we must note the appear­
ances before the access of heat, and endeavour to
equalize them. Much depends upon this, particularly
where the strength of the individual is much reduced,
or where violent fluctuations may from some cause be
apprehended. By anticipating the attacks, we aid in
bringing about a milder and quicker termination of the
disease.
SIMPLE FEVER.
Symptoms: alternate cold, dry heat, perspiration, and
a quick pulse, thirst, and loss of appetite. Sometimes
it is ushered in by degrees, sometimes comes suddenly.
Causes: bad air and diet, colds, mental afflictions, &c.
Treatment: if the patient's strength is not too much
reduced, he is, if the fever begins with the cold shiver,
placed in a tepid half-bath, the back, abdomen, and loins
being well rubbed, water of the same temperature being
poured down his neck; this is continued until the shiver
yields to a more easy feeling: he is then dried, and put
to bed. When symptoms of heat are manifested, the
patient is- wrapped in a wet sheet which is changed as
often as the heat becomes violent. This change of sheets
is continued until a mild perspiration breaks out, which
generally succeeds as the excessive heat subsides. In
the last sheet, perspiration is kept up for thirty minutes,
more or less, according to circumstances, and promoted
SIMPLE FEVER* 157
by water drinking; a half-bath of five to fifteen minutes*
duration in tepid water ends the fever. As often as
there is a fresh fit, the treatment is renewed. The
quantity of water to be drunk, is according to the
invalid’s desire.
By the half, or sitz-bath, to be employed at the
commencement of the cold, the access is broken and
shortened, and the skin prepared for the promotion of
perspirations.
If the fever begins with heat, or the first application
is neglected at the shivering fit; if prostration of
strength, or increased excitability be indicated, the
treatment is commenced with wet sheets. Air and
moderate exercise in the interval of the prescribed
baths are to be strongly recommended. Should violent
critical appearances set in—such as bleedings, diarrhoea,
vomiting, congestions of the blood in the head and
chest—foot and sitz-baths, umschlags and plentiful
drinking of cold water, serve to soothe and aid the
critical secretions*
When the fever is abated, the strengthening process
is resorted to for completing the cure. Gradually
the transition is made:—a wet sheet in the morning
for a while, with a tepid bath after it, and by degrees
a colder one. With an accession of strength, the wet
sheets are exchanged for gentle sweatings in dry
blankets, and by and by a douche. A heating com­
press is worn round the waist constantly, to aid di­
gestion, and sitz-baths of thirty, forty, and sixty
158 INTERMITTENT FEVER.
minutes are alternated with, the half and full bath, as
may be advisable.
In all fever diseases, a proper diet must be observed,
and nothing but fresh cold water taken for drink; if
not accustomed to cold water, drinking small quan­
tities at first will soon enable the most delicate sto­
mach to take it: cool, light nourishment should be
administered; hot food avoided.
This is the general treatment; of course not exactly
applicable for every individual.
INTERMITTENT FEVER.
If some other ailment exists or is forming, and the
fever is the accompaniment, the treatment must prin­
cipally be directed against the disease; for the fever,
in that case, is only a symptom of the disorder. Ac­
cording to the nature and violence of the disease, the
treatment will be modified.
The intermittent fever is distinguished by regular
accesses every other day or every third day. Each
fit commences with violent cold, not unfrequently
accompanied by vomiting, succeeded by great dry
heat, thirst, and violent headache, and terminates in
abundant perspiration; the cold lasts from a few mi­
nutes to a quarter of an hour; the heat and perspi­
ration many hours. In the intervals, the patient is
in comparatively good health.
INFLAMMATORY FEVER. 159
Proper treatment will soon obviate all danger, and
after the access, it should be particularly directed to
the cause, generally irregular action of the bowels,
indicated by a coated tongue, loss of appetite, nausea,
fulness in the stomach, See. When the attack is
violent, half-bath, sitz-bath, and wet-sheet are re­
sorted to, to arrest its progress or mitigate its violence.
The application of the wet sheet just before the
paroxysm will, in most cases, greatly tend to diminish
its force. The treatment is repeated in every fresh
access, until the fever is subdued.
INFLAMMATORY FEVER.
The symptoms denote general inflammation in the sys­
tem ; face red, pulse hard, tongue scarlet coloured, urine
high-coloured, unquenchable thirst, skin dry, body cos­
tive, great restlessness, and loss of sleep. It lasts five,
seven, eleven, and sometimes fourteen days. It attacks
persons of all ages and habits, and at all seasons, particu­
larly in spring, and is common in cold and temperate cli­
mates. Sudden transitions from heat to cold, swallow­
ing cold liquor when the body is much heated by exer­
cise, intemperate indulgence in spirituous liquors, violent
passions of the mind, &c., &c., are among the exciting
causes.
An antiphlogistic treatment must be resorted to, but
the practice of blood-letting in such cases must be
utterly avoided. Excitement of all kinds should be
1G0 BILIOUS AND NERVOUS FEVERS.
eschewed, the diet sparing, and plenty of cold water
given for drink. The stimulus of heat must be espe­
cially avoided, covering and clothing light, exposure to
air and free ventilation of the apartments as much as
possible. In general cases, the treatment, as in simple
fevers, will, with these precautions, be sufficient* In
cases of local inflammations, the treatment must then
be directed against these; half and sitz-baths, with sooth­
ing compresses, will subdue the inflammation, and at the
same time the fever.
BILIOUS FEVER.
In these there is a complication of gastric, catarrhal
and rheumatic affections, which are chiefly consequent on
defective secretions and excretions; the treatment must
be directed against the diseases producing the fever.
To overcome occasional attacks of fever during the pro­
gress of a cure, and for the promotion and facilitation of
critical appearances, stimulating wet sheets are made use
of, and where there is local inflammations, soothing
compresses to the parts adjacent.
NERVOUS FEVER.
There is a double appearance in nervous fevers, an ex­
cited or blunted state of the nerves. The first begins
with moderate cold and alternate heat, added to great
NERVOUS FEVER. 161
weakness and relaxation. The pulse is qtiick, weak and
irregular; patient restless, talkative, and unable to
sleep. The eye quick and wandering, and the senses
often keen. The skin burning hot; the tongue at
first is not much coated, but as the disease advances,
gets dirty-brown, dry, cracked and trembling; involuntary
evacuations by stool and urine occur; the invalid fancies
he perceives all sorts of phantoms, cries and laughs alter­
nately ; becomes delirious, which progresses to insanity.
The second species has quite contrary symptoms. The
pulse is slow, weak and small—the patient indifferent to
outward impressions—lies quietly in bed—sleeps fast—
his senses are dull—sight and hearing weakened; and the
whole physiognomy assumes somewhat of a stupid look.
Pain is not complained of in either case. A burning,
dry, brown, cracked and trembling tongue is present here
too. There is delirium, an utterance of low murmuring
sounds. The drowsiness often increases to stupefaction.
The duration of a nervous fever is fourteen days at least,
frequently three to six weeks. The recovery is seldom
ushered in by critical appearances, but by diminution
of the accesses. We all know that this is a dangerous
fever, and particularly if accompanied by inflammation
of the nobler organs, as the brain, &c., which is
not a rare case. Nervous fever is not always a self­
standing disease, but the produce of other diseases.
The epidemic nervous fever, causing vast devastations
in time of war, is often connected with the putrid fever;
it is therefore also called the contagious typhus. In
L
162 NERVOUS FEVER.
these forms of the disease petechiae—literally, flea bites,
from the resemblance they bear to these—appear on the
surface of the skin, and which always denote great
danger. This is called the petechial fever.
The treatment of nervous fever requires the greatest
nicety of judgment, as from the weakness and ex­
citability of the nervous system, the applications of cold
water may easily become too exciting. A cooling treat­
ment is essential. The wet sheet here offers advantages
which cannot be replaced by any other remedy, acting
in a soothing, and at the same time strengthening
manner. It is therefore advisable to commence the
treatment with these, changing them as often as circum­
stances require, and only very gradually adopting the
sitz and half baths, which on the other hand should not
be too long delayed. Nor should the water for these
baths ever be of a higher temperature than 65° to 70°
Fahrenheit.
In the latter stages of the disease, when delirium,
&c., has set in, an energetical and judicious application
of the half and sitz baths must be resorted to, with fric­
tion of the whole body, and cold compresses on the head
and neck. Where nervous fever is a symptom and not a
disease, there is no fear that in treating it the regular
process of the cure may be interrupted, for the baths
take effect on the whole organism, and the subduing
of one symptom can never be accomplished at the
expense of others, or of the original disease.
The limits of our work will not permit us to allude
NERVOUS FEVER. 163
more particularly to the experience of olden times;
but as to the happy effects of water in malignant
fevers, in more recent periods, a few remarks may not
be uninteresting. The surprising effects of the treat­
ment of Currie, Wright, Jackson, &c., will be found
in the writings of the times. W e all know that in the
malignant epidemic fever which broke out in 1813
and 1814 in Germany, and the neighbouring countries,
thousands were saved from impending death by water.
The great German physician Hufeland declares, from
his vast experience, that fresh air and cold, (applied by
means of air and water,) and a due regard to clean­
liness, are the best remedies against typhus. Water
was drunk plentifully and applied externally in various
fotms then. The most usual and highly beneficial
plan consisted in the application of cold compresses
on the head, as the principal seat of suffering; if pu­
trid diarrhoea occurred, or the abdomen was tympa­
nitic, a compress round it did most essential service.
A second way was the washing of the whole surface
of the body with cold water; by these means, the
fever was diminished, the violence of the whole disease
abated, and the skin stimulated. The drier and hotter
the skin, the colder the water. A third manner of
applying it was by pourings over with cold water, or
ablutions and falling baths (douches). This method
is the most powerful, but most successful, and indeed,
frequently wonderful in its result; the greatest dis­
cretion in putting it into practice is, however, essential.
L 2
16* NERVOUS FEVER.
Witli young and robust constitutions, in the earlier
stages of the disease, with a dry and hot skin, the
effect of the third method is most beneficial. In ad­
vanced stages, with old and exhausted, weakly and
excitable persons, it might prove injurious.
Tepid baths, with cold compresses, have the pre­
ference here. No medicine of any kind was employed
by Hufeland nor by Dr. Horn, of Berlin, who also
effected a great many cures in the same epidemic fever
by the simple agency of water. The experience made
by Goeden also proves how beneficial cold ablutions
are in typhus fever. He instances many cases of re­
covery by it, and the plentiful drinking of cold water,
of some, and the death of others who had been made
to drink wine, in the years 1814—15; the contrast
being heightened by the recovery of such patients
as at the same time enjoyed the cool air out of doors,
or in a cold room with all the windows opened in the
midst of winter.
The applications of water by the medical men of
the time were varied, but all successful; the cooling
and water treatment saved those who submitted to
it from choice or necessity. Whilst others, preju­
diced in favour of old customs, and particularly people
living in towns, fell a sacrifice. Many physicians
and their modes of operation might be named, but
it would lead us too far; it may be useful, however, to
embody the experience made, in a brief summary, viz.:
—cold water is the best beverage for those afflicted with
PUTRID FEVER. 165
nervous fever. Let them drink it as often and as
much as they please, due caution being exercised
during a cold fit and abundant perspiration ; but in
a dry burning fever it is highly beneficial: the internal
burning and anxiety are diminished, the pulse and
breathing more calm, delirium is moderated, the eva­
poration by the skin greater, and a general perspiration
and refreshing sleep frequently is the result.
The external application of cold water in the most
malignant nervous fevers surpasses all medicines, and
is most beneficial in the first stages of the disease.
In the milder forms, cold washings and cold com­
presses on the head or abdomen, according to circum­
stances, are sufficient; whilst in more malignant forms
ablutions or pourings over with cold water are essential.
The greater the heat of the patient the lower should
the temperature of the water be ; and if not obtainable
cold enough, should be iced, the compresses particu­
larly.
When the patient is cold, the outward application
of cold water must be avoided j and likewise if the vital
power is much reduced by constitution, old age, or the
encroachment of disease.
PUTRID FEVER.
This form is seldom a disease of itself, but produced
by other diseases, particularly nervous fevers, &c.
166 CHILD-BED FEVER.
There is in this disease a great tendency to putrefaction.
The symptoms are: great and burning heat, small pulse,
great debility, fetid breath and perspiration, and fetid
evacuations; petechise, streaks of blood on the skin,
hemorrhage, very fluid dark blood, distended abdomen,
excessive and often involuntary motions, dark brown
urine, clammy and debilitating sweat; frequently ac­
companied by other nervous symptoms. The putrid
fever is one of the most dangerous, lasts three to four
weeks, and longer, if death does not occur sooner.
Cold regimen is the most important remedy. The
room must be well ventilated and cool, and all that is
taken, cool. Cold water for drinking, and cold washings
of the whole body are urgently to be recommended. Then
follow cold compresses, cold injections, ablutions, and, if
practicable, cold baths. The frequent rinsing of the
mouth with cold water is very useful.
CHILD-BED FEVER.
Priessnitz is said to have been very successful in the
cure of some desperate cases of this form; but of course,
from the materially reduced state of the sufferer, none
but the most skilful hydrotherapeutic practitioner
should attempt it. Priessnitz made use in these cases
of wet sheets, and occasionally a half-bath, with rubbing
of the feet; after a gentle perspiration, a tepid half-bath
is given. In cases of great debility and unconscious-
YELLOW AND SCARLET FEVER. 167
ness, he ordered a washing of short duration of the
whole "body—face, stomach, back, arms, and feet, being
well rubbed—before proceeding to the wet sheets.
Sitz-baths he avoids in such cases, to prevent over­
excitement of the parts. Women, who before and
after pregnancy, are accustomed to proper dietetic
observances as to water, are seldom troubled with this
fever, and when it attacks them, it is in a very mild
form.
YELLOW FEVER.
%
A yellow colour of the skin, and vomiting black
matter are its characteristics; America and the West
Indies its home. The accompanying fever is nervous
or putrid. Death frequently ensues after forty-eight
hours. Many have fallen a sacrifice to it, also, in some
of the Spanish and Italian seaports, as Gibraltar, Barce­
lona, Livoma, &c. The treatment would of course
have to be modified according to circumstances. On
the authority of American and English physicians of
eminence, we find cold compresses on the head, cold
washings and ablutions most beneficial.
SCARLET FEVER.
The symptoms consist of a lighter or darker redden-
168 SCARLET FEVER.
ing bf the skin, over the whole or part of the body,
inflammation of the throat, burning heat, and a quick
pulse. The eruption generally remains four to six days,
getting gradually paler, and the skin becoming desqua­
mated at the hands and feet. The fever is inflammatory,
gastric, or nervous, and (in some epidemics) putrid;
mostly, however, it is of the nervous character, is fre­
quently dangerous and contagious, carrying off many,
particularly children.
Under the head of skin diseases, we give the general
treatment, to which we refer our readers; it applies to
this disease, as do also the remarks regarding the warm
treatment in use till now; than which nothing can be
more erroneous, as the experience of late years fully
testifies. Of course, a due and careful regard must be
paid not to expose the patient to draughts, but a cool
regimen is absolutely essential.
In no disease have the beneficial effects of cold water
been more prominent than in scarlet fever, particularly
in its malignant forms. Currie cured vast numbers by
it, and his own two children, one of five, and one of
three years, among the number. Wright and Gregory
were also very successful. The Hungarian Doctor, Col-
bany, had thirty eight patients in the violent scarlet
epidemic in Presburg, all of whom he cured by water.
Dr. Reuss, in Aschaffenberg, in 1820, cured thirty to
forty by it, losing one child of three years and a half
old. Kreysig, in Dresden, and Horn, in Berlin, mention
many cases of cures by cold ablutions, or pourings over,
SCARLET FEVER. 169
in scarlet fever combined with inflammation of the brain*
Above all, however, the celebrated Frohlich, in Vienna,
experienced the most happy results by his internal and
external water applications in this malignant fever. Pie,
however, always tried the temperature of the patient,
keeping the thermometer ten to fifteen minutes under
the arm-pits. He used water as washings, baths, and
ablutions. The greater the heat, the colder the water.
When the heat of the body, with- a dry skin, did not
exceed 98° Fahrenheit, he ordered—as often as the skin
got dry—a washing of the whole body in water of 90°
Fahrenheit, giving a cup of aromatic tea to aid perspira­
tion. His rules were fixed as to the higher degrees of
heat in the body. If 100°, he ordered washings in water
of 75°.
104° . . . . 60°
107° to 108° . . . . 34° to 40°
Frohlich states cold baths to be more effectual than
washings, but when the heat of the body is high, he
considers ablutions most effectual. In such cases he had
one or two pailsful of water of 40° to 50° Fahrenheit,
poured over the naked body of the patient, and repeated
several times a day, as the heat again rose after the cooling
effect of the ablution. Sometimes two or three ablutions
were sufficient for the cure which was established, when,
after the last cooling, the body attained its normal heat,
and retained it for six to eight hours, the skin becom­
ing soft and exhaling secretion; then a few washings
or baths of 92° to 94° Fahrenheit were all that was
170 INFLAMMATIONS.
required. Frohlich states, he never experienced the
eruption to recede, but the patients speedily recovered.
Many more names might be quoted for the treatment,
eminent in their profession on the Continent; Granich-
stadten, of Vienna, among* them ; he pursues the
Priessnitz method with success.
S E C T IO N II.
Inflammations.
The cause of every inflammation is an accumulation
of blood in the organs affected; hence redness, heat,
pain, and swelling, are the symptoms; added to which,
we have more or less obstruction in the due performance
of the functions of the organs affected, and more or less
of*fever. Inflammations rank amongst the most consi­
derable diseases of the organism, but are more easily
overcome than many other diseases, with proper treat­
ment, and an otherwise pretty healthy state of the
body.
Those who live temperately, and observe proper
dietetic rules as to water, cut off many an inflammation
in its birth.
The critical appearances in inflammation are very
various: the happiest result is dispersion. Critical per­
spiration, urine, diarrhoea, or hemorrhage, terminate, it if
the treatment is not too long delayed; where inflamma-
INFLAMMATIONS. 171
tion has reached such a height as to disturb the functions
of the parts, and affect the neighbouring ones in some
degree, eruptions in the skin will be the forerunner of
recovery. Inflammation may end in hardening, suppura­
tion or mortification, if neglected or improperly treated.
The treatment will always have to be directed against
the whole organism and not locally, in considerable not
superficial inflammation. In external inflammation,
the consequence of slight wounds, contusions, &c.,
unaccompanied by fever, and with otherwise healthy
persons, the treatment may be local, though, if general,
it is to be preferred. Above all things the cause must
be ascertained and got over. All excitement of mind
and of body, particularly of the affected parts, must be
avoided. The attainment of the dispersion must be the
object: therefore the congestion must be diverted to
the peripheric organs—the skin especially—and this will
be best effected by raising the activity of the healthy
organs, so as to enable these, by their increased action,
to draw off the congestion from the diseased part and
thus reduce the pain, gradually restoring the organ to
its normal state. The more vital, therefore, the organ
attacked, the more it compromises the rest of the organ­
ism—as in inflammations of the brain, spine, lungs,
stomach, &c.—the more must the treatment be directed
upon the entire system; on the other hand, the more
self-dependent the diseased organ is, the nearer to the
periphery of the body, and exposed to outward influ­
ences, as with the organs of sense, the more must the
172 INFLAMMATIONS.
treatment be local, in connexion with the general treat­
ment.
For the attainment of the dispersion and diversion
of the congestions, the hydrotherapeutic anti-inflamma­
tory process is highly commendable. Priessnitz dis­
countenances bleeding in toto: he maintains, that it
only weakens the organism, and deprives it of the means
of exerting the vital power. Emetics and purgatives, he
looks upon in the same light, and declares, from expe­
rience, fresh cold water, judiciously applied, to be quite
as effectual in averting danger, without the weakening
effects generally succeeding bloodletting, &c.
In purely acute inflammation, the anti-inflammatory
process, consisting in full baths or half-baths, according
to the individual case, with sitz-baths and cooling com­
presses, are resorted to. In inflammations of external
parts, cold compresses must constantly be applied: they
remain longer on the parts, are changed to soothing,
and lastly to exciting bandages, when all symptoms of
inflammation have subsided, and the calming of the
excitement, the healing of the critical eruptions, or the
strengthening of the recovering organ, becomes the
object. If these appearances are connected with fever,
wet sheets and half-baths are employed; sitz-baths and
injections at the same time aid defective digestion.
In inflammation of important inner organs, where no
counter indications forbid the direct attack on the
inflammation, the treatment might be as follows :—
W ith the strictest regard to the state of the patient’s
INFLAMMATIONS. 173
strength—according to which the temperature of the
water is regulated—as also to any other counter indica­
tions (e. g. congestions to the head and chest in the sitz-bath,
induced by the bent position, &c.,) the patient is placed
in a half or sitz-bath of tepid water. In this bath—with
constant rubbing and adding of gradually colder water
—the patient remains until the inflammatory symptoms
abate considerably, cold water being drank the while.
By this bath and friction the congestions are drawn
from the internal to the external parts. In order to aid
in the effect, it is often necessary to apply cold bandages
on the parts covering, or adjacent to, the diseased or­
gans ; in inflammation of the brain, croup, &c., this must
not be neglected.
Previous to the inflammatory symptoms abating, there
is a cold shiver which must be awaited in the bath,
and the patient be quite cold also under the arm-pits; it
is only when the normal heat returns—when hands and
feet get warm—that the patient leaves the bath, is dried
and put to bed, more or less cooling bandages being
applied to the diseased parts. Mostly a gentle sleep
and mild perspiration ensue; this is washed off in a
half-bath: if the symptoms recur, the sitz or half-bath
must be repeated, but this is rarely the case. If
costiveness or retention of urine exist, sitz-bath and
injections must be applied, also stimulating bandages
round the stomach and genitals to restore the functions
of these organs.
For some time after perfect quiet must be maintained,
174 WOUNDS, FISTULA, &C.
to subdue the excitement of the nerves, more or less
great during the baths. The soothing plan—wet sheets,
sitz-baths, of longer duration—must be resorted to.
By-and-bye, to strengthen the organism, the strengthen­
ing process ensues: sweating, short cold baths, exciting
or stimulating bandages, short sitz-baths, douches, &c.
Diet not too nutritious, and cool; cold water for
drink, and fresh air when possible.
WOUNDS, FISTULA, &C.
Festering wounds, if accompanied by inflammations
of the neighbouring parts, are treated first with com­
presses, not too much wrung out, and always renewed
when they get warm. Tumours, before they break,
often cause violent pain; to diminish this, derivative
baths are used, namely, sitz, foot, elbow, and head-baths,
(according to the case,) of longer duration; exciting com­
presses, near the affected parts, and calming ones on
them. A tumour should take its own course, and not be
opened artificially ; nor when opened and discharged be
healed by salves, ointment, or artificial remedies. This
alludes particularly to the tumours frequently rising on
the skin in the course of the Water treatment, and
termed crisis. In these cases, when the inflammatory
symptoms have abated or been subdued—after the
breaking and discharging of matter—the compresses
applied are more wrung out and remain on longer, but
ULCERS. 175
must not be allowed to get quite dry, as in this state, by
cleaving to the wound and entailing a necessity for for­
cible separation, the irritation would be great. The
wet sheets and baths, &c., necessary to the cure are con­
tinued ; at the same time the bowels must be kept in
regular order.
Parts covered with wounds or affected by violent
pain must not be bathed too long in cold water, but
rather other parts of the body submitted to bathing.
ULCERS.
Ulcers are treated in similar manner; but the ap­
plication of wet sheets at the same time, with occa­
sional sweating and sitz-baths of long duration, are
necessary; ulcers generally indicating faulty and
vicious fluids, so that the body must be strengthened,
in order to fit it for the preparations of healthy se­
cretions. Ulcers seldom arise in consequence of the
hydrotherapeutic treatment of inflammations, and where
they previously existed, they are brought to discharge
by persevering in the treatment, the organism being
strengthened; once discharged, they then soon heal.
When mortification of a wound has taken place to
any extent, there is little hope, although numerous
examples are on record of Priessnitz effecting wonders,
even in such stages; many limbs after being destined to
amputation were by him restored to health. A striking
176 CROUP.
instance is related of an old wound—the consequence
of a long and severe illness—being treated for sixteen
weeks by Priessnitz, with anti-inflammatory, cold
wet bandages, and at the same time with the stimu­
lating douche. The pain and excitement were raised
to a frightful height, and mortification was commenc­
ing. A medical man, moved by the complaints of
the patient, would close the wound by artificial means,
intimating, at the same time, that he might be com­
pelled, in case of emergency, to make new wounds.
A change in the treatment, however, the application
of wet sheets, warming and soothing bandages, dis­
continuance of douche, sitz-baths of short and sole-
baths of long duration, did away with all symptoms
of mortification in five days, and brought the cure into
regular train.
By similar derivative, soothing treatment, with a due
regard to the strengthening of the organism, the progress
of mortification is sure to be arrested.
CROUP.
A cautious, but at the same time, quick and deter­
mined proceeding, is necessary in all inflammations of
inner and more important organs, as of the brain,
spine, chest, abdomen, &c., as life often depends upon
it. Cold water will never refuse its service, and is
said to have done wonders also in dangerous cases of
CROUP. 177
croup. This disease is incidental to childhood. It
consists of an inflammation of the windpipe, secreting
a membraneous effusion, by which the air is excluded
from the lungs; suffocation is the result. Croup is
ushered in by slight cough, hoarseness, and sneezing,
as if cold had been taken; soon after, or in a day or
two, a peculiar shrillness and singing of the voice is
perceived, as though the sound came through a brazen
tube; the cough is dry, hard, and recurring periodi­
cally, sometimes after an elapse of hours. Respiration,
swallowing, and speaking, are difficult, and there is
pain felt in the parts. If anything be expectorated—
which is the case in later stages, with much pain and
trouble—it is matter of a purulent appearanee, and
sometimes films, resembling portions of a membrane.
Croup often quite disappears for a short time,—occa­
sionally is fatal in seven or eight hours; generally three
or four days elapse, and at times it lasts from nine to
seventeen days. The danger of the disease speaks for
the necessity of the promptest attention.
Among the happy results, we must name that of
Dr. Hellering, who saved a child of six years from
inevitable death. He had treated the child for four
days by the anti-inflammatory process; the symptoms
were increased. He now had ice cold compresses ap­
plied round the neck every five minutes, with evident
relief; after two days a sanguineous matter was dis­
charged, and the child recovered.
In desperate cases, we hear of cold ablutions in
M
178 CROUP.
later times. The first who attempted it was Dr.
Harder, of St. Petersburgli. His own daughter, one
and a half year old, had had croup twice, and in the
summer, 1819, was again attacked with it. All re­
medies were of no avail; death seemed at the door,
when the father determined on the following treat­
ment :—he had his child put on a hay mattress, face
downwards, held down, and two pailsful of water, of
C
O
® to 65° Fahrenheit poured over it at a height of
half a yard, from the head downwards, particularly on
the back, after which the child was dried and put to
bed. Breathing became freer ; but the symptoms, after
two hours, returned, when the ablution was repeated,
and again ten times after several fluctuations, when all
danger was at an end, and the child recovered.
Harder names two more successful cases of his own
experience; and his followers, Muller, Aberle, Wol-
fers, Baumbach, &c., saved many children by it, fre­
quently after two or three ablutions and rubbings.
The energetic effect of the water tends at once to stop
the undue secretion of the organs and to regulate their
due functions; the secretion itself is altered by drink­
ing fresh water and rinsing the mouth well, and is
easier ejected. According to Priessnitz, a half-bath,
or wet sheet, may be commenced with.
Many children fall a sacrifice to this fatal disease
annually, which, henceforth, I hope will not be the
case.
INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES, EARS, &C.
The cause must be discovered in these and similar
cases, as in inflammation of the tongue and glands.
If purely inflammation, unconnected with any other
disorder, the treatment must be local; first cold, then
soothing, and lastly stimulating bandages. At first,
derivative local baths, namely, if the organs of sense
are affected, baths for the occiput and sides of the
head; if glands, according to tlieir seat, head, elbow,
foot, or sitz-baths; by and by, strengthening local
baths are useful. A stimulating bandage round the
abdomen, and drinking cold water, will keep the di­
gestive apparatus in good order, which is necessary.
CHRONIC INFLAMMATIONS.
Chronic inflammations and their consequences, thick­
enings and hardenings, are frequently cured by ap­
propriate treatment, but slowly. It depends on raising
the activity of the functions, generating in them a new
life with a quicker change of fluids; therefore the
strengthening method is to be employed. Sweating
in dry blankets and wet sheets, wearing stimulating
bandages, cold baths of short duration, and ablutions,
with much friction, sitz-baths of short duration, douche,
injections, and plentiful drinking of cold water, will,
judiciously varied, often overcome the disease in hope­
less cases. Of course, all the symptoms must be
m 2
180 HEMORRHAGES AND CONGESTIONS.
watched, counteracted, or accelerated, according to
circumstances, as they arise. A gradual strengthening
of the organism and improvement of the vital power
will renew the long-interrupted struggle, and bring
back acute inflammation; the anti-inflammatory pro­
cess must then be substituted for the stimulating one :
the appearances of fever, eruptions, &c., are treated
with wet sheets, sitz-baths, fomentations, &c. Chronic
inflammations of long standing frequently disappear
gradually, without any fever or inflammatory symp­
toms. They are determined by perspiration, urine,
diarrhoea, hemorrhage, &c. In very obstinate cases,
years may elapse, but the result is certain. After
cures of this nature, a proper dietetic use of water
must be adhered to, to prevent a relapse.
SECTION III.
Hemorrhages and Congestions.
Hemorrhages are active or passive. The former,
being created by greater activity of the blood vessels,
and often occurring in plethoric constitutions, are at
times beneficial, and must not be suppressed violently ;
the latter, being caused by general or local debility
and relaxation, must be immediately obviated. In
the former case, the object should be to diminish the
increased flow of blood; in the latter to strengthen
BLEEDING AND SPITTING OF BLOOD. 181
the vessels, so that they may be able to resist the
violent accumulation of. the blood: nothing is more
calculated to do this than the proper application of
water.
BLEEDING OF THE NOSE.
Frequent bleeding of the nose, particularly in youth,
denotes a weak organization of the lungs, and in wo­
men attaining puberty, irregular menstruation. Where
it exists, the living must be well regulated; a cool and
nourishing vegetable diet being essential. Cold water
is the best beverage here. Fresh air and exercise, with
cold washings, will regulate the equilibrium. A vio­
lent flow can be stopped by half-an-hour’s foot-bath,
up to the ancles, in tepid water, cooling compresses
for the occiputd an neck, with drinking and sniffing up
water.
SPITTING OF BLOOD.
Spitting of blood is a symptom of incipient consump­
tion generally. The patient must be kept very quiet,
avoiding all excitement, bodily or mental. The appli­
cation of cold water must be very gradual. Cold wash­
ings of the chest, plentiful drinking of fresh pure water
with the chill off, with cooling compresses on the chest,
will be very serviceable. Moderate applications of the
wet sheet will tend to prevent a recurrence.
182 VOMITING BLOOD AND PILES.
The diet must be mild, cold, and not too nutritious.
Priessnitz cured many persons, whose lungs were already
slightly affected, by a very careful application of gentle
and gradually more stimulating applications of water.
VOMITING OF BLOOD.
Caused frequently by overfulness of the vessels of the
abdomen, and diseases of the liver and spleen. The hy-
drotherapeutic treatment will be slow in its effect, though
with perseverance—the patient’s strength not being too
much sunk—it may ultimately be successful. Where
it is very violent, and congestions to the chest are feared,
foot-baths—the water reaching over the ancles—will be
useful; if insufficient, half-baths, with rubbing of the
body, particularly the abdomen. As the cure progresses,
sitz-baths of an hour, or longer. Water drinking is essen­
tial, but in small quantities ; stimulating bandages round
the abdomen must be worn, food cold and light, and all
excitement avoided.
PILES.
A sedentary life, excesses in sensual enjoyments, over
indulgence in spirituous liquors, are the predisposing
causes. Piles may be termed a chronic disease of the
abdomen, arising from congestions of the blood in the
PILES. 183
rectum, often terminating in fluxes of mucus, or of blood,
by which relief is generally obtained, and in which case,
they are often the preventive of more serious evils, such
as spitting and vomiting ofblood, apoplexy, &c. When
blind, forming little tumours on the surface of the anus,
they often give rise to more serious disorders:—their
prevention by the dietetic use of water is easy, even
where there is an hereditary predisposition to them.
There is no better remedy than water for piles.
There must be diversion of the cause, by lessening
the accumulation of the blood, and causing a proper
circulation thereof.
Sweating, cold baths, stimulating bandages round the
abdomen, derivative sitz-baths, frequent injections, and
plentiful drinking of water, are the best and surest
means for regulating the functions of the abdominal
organs, and the free circulation of the fluids. If the
strength of the patient allows it, the douche—submitting
the back and loins to its action—will be useful in
strengthening the part. Cold, light nourishing diet,
with fresh air and exercise, are essential in this disease.
Cases of rapid cures of piles are frequent. The cri­
tical appearances are sanguineous and mucous discharges,
perspiration, eruptions on the skin, tumours on the ab­
domen, loins, and perinaeum ; the douche must then be
discontinued, wet sheets used to perspire in, and tepid
water for bathing.
184
IRREGULAR MENSTRUATION.
Irregularities in menstruation are the cause of many
serious evils, and they exist particularly among women
of the middle and higher classes of life, in consequence
of a defective physical education. The irregularity
consists either in too abundant a flow, too little, or a
total suppression.
A cool and simple diet, daily drinking of cold water,
and enjoyment of fresh air, with moderate, not fatiguing
exercise, avoidance of catching cold, particularly by wet
feet, and of all mental commotions; daily washing or
bathing of the whole body, chiefly of the abdomen, loins,
and the lower extremities, will be especially useful.
The circulation of the secretions is thereby promoted,
the skin strengthened and guarded against atmospheric
influences.
The treatment must tend to restore the equilibrium
of the circulation, and to strengthen the nervous system,
and must of course vary according to circumstances:
in general, the patient’s strength permitting it, a gentle
sweating in dry blankets or wet sheets, morning and
afternoon, with subsequent cold or tepid full or half-
baths, friction being used. Plentiful water drinking in
the course of the day, and plenty, though not heating or
fatiguing exercise in the fresh air; also two sitz-baths
of fifteen to twenty minutes; these must, however, be
omitted at the usual period of menstruation. Before
IRREGULAR MENSTRUATION. 185
going to bed, foot-baths of ten to thirty minutes, and
stimulating bandages round the abdomen night and day.
The diet must be cool, light, and nourishing. These
proceedings will soon bring matters into regular course.
In congestions of the head and chest, cold wet com­
presses are applied to these parts.
The sitz-baths must be used with the utmost caution,
as they would do more harm than good, if used during
the period; foot-baths are a good substitute. This
treatment applies for suppressed menses.
In the event of their flowing too profusely, in conse­
quence of great weakness or relaxation, sitz-baths of
ten to fifteen minutes’ duration, added to the general
strengthening process, may be taken with advantage, even
during the period, if other circumstances—such as con­
gestion of the blood to the inner organs—do not forbid
their use.
Should there be hysterics before or after the period,
tepid half-baths or foot-baths with soothing fomentations
are applied until overcome ; after which, injections and
the wet sheet.
In violent and dangerous menorrhagia during men­
struation, or after child-birth, derivative foot-baths,
injections, soothing, and afterwards stimulating bandages
round the abdomen are applied, then follow the wet
sheets.
Priessnitz assures us, from experience, that preg­
nant women may undergo the treatment with great
186 CHLOROSIS.
advantage to themselves and their offspring, and that It
will prevent abortion.
We may mention, en passant, that in cases of irregu­
lar menses, sea-bathing is of most essential service in
alleviating pain and restoring suppressed courses. It is
also of remarkable efficacy in a disease connected with,
or the consequence of irregular menstruation, and of
which we may speak here, namely, the green sickness,
or—
CHLOROSIS.
This complaint yields speedily and perfectly to the
hydrotherapeutic treatment, but the dietetic observances
must be very strict. Long sleep in soft and warm beds,
or heated bedrooms, much sitting and reading, too
much dancing, warm, relaxing drinks, hot (also spiced)
food, fat and heavy farinaceous diet, and flatulent
vegetables, (such as peas) must be repudiated.
Of course, the treatment must be adapted to the
strength of the patient, and be very gradual. Wet
sheets are of most beneficial effect, used morning and
evening; after being warmed, tepid, and by degrees,
cold ablutions follow. In the course of the day two
sitz-baths of twenty, forty or sixty minutes, with rub­
bing of the abdomen. Stimulating bandages round the
abdomen, and when the strength of the patient has in­
creased, an occasional douche.
187
CONGESTIONS OF THE HEAD AND CHEST.
These frequently become dangerous, causing uncon­
sciousness, swimming of the head, delirium, and inflam­
mations of the brain. Above all, long derivative foot­
baths are useful, or, according to circumstances, tepid
half-baths, and at the same time cooling compresses on
the head; the former are continued until the violence of
the attack has abated, when wet sheets are applied to
soothe the nervous system, and promote critical appear­
ances. A gentle perspiration must be produced by the
wet sheets—changed more or less frequently, according
to circumstances—after which a tepid half-bath, and
friction of the whole body is continued as long as the
patient finds it agreeable.
In the application of sitz-baths in all congestive affec­
tions, or diseases where they may reasonably be expected
to arise, the utmost discretion must be exercised, as the
bent position may easily increase the tendency to deter­
mination of blood to the head and chest. Caution in
water drinking must also be strictly enjoined, for too
large a quantity, by its mechanical pressure, obstructs
the activity of the abdominal viscera, and impedes the
circulation.
Congestions are frequently brought to a favourable
issue by hemorrhages which are treated by derivative
188 SKIN DISEASES.
and local baths, as described. The activity of the bowels
must be promoted by stimulating bandages round the
abdomen. Occasionally critical diarrhoea puts an end to
the congestions; foot-baths and clysters are then useful.
If the patient has quiet sleep during the critical appear­
ances, it should not be interrupted; but if sleep is dis­
turbed by anxious dreams, foot-baths and wet sheets
should be immediately resorted to.
Congestions of the chest, the symptoms of which
only arise gradually, and generally become chronic, are
essentially treated like congestions of the head, with
wet sheets, tepid half-baths of three-quarters of an
hour each, &c. Delay should be avoided, and the
treatment resorted to in good time.
SECTION IV.
Diseases of the Excreting and Secreting Organs.
I . S k i n D i s e a s e s .
The skin is one of the most important organs of the
body, and deserves our most serious attention. Its
great importance may be judged of from the fact of
every man exhaling daily three pounds of superfluous
humours by perspiration, which was proved by Sanc-
torius, after twenty years’ experiments with himself.
We may well infer, that if by an undue performance
SKIN DISEASES. 189
of the functions of this organ, this necessary exhala­
tion is suppressed, that injury to the general health,
by the retention of these superfluous humours, must
be the result. In another part of this work, we have
spoken of the manner of Priessnitz’ examining his
patients, and of the advantage he has in doing so; for
as the most malignant matter is often eliminated by
the skin, its good or bad condition, in a great measure,
indicates the more or less favourable, quicker or slower
issue of the disease. Indeed, its importance has been
always acknowledged, but unfortunately lost sight of,
to the evident astonishment of the few, who yet act up
to natures laws. The anatomical view of the skin,
with its numberless vessels and nerves, membraneous
and other formations, connected with all parts of the
system, is sufficient to impress us with its great
importance, and with the necessity of a most careful
regard to the due fulfilment of its functions.
The weakness of the skin is an unfortunate conco­
mitant of the present state of society, and more un­
fortunate cause of many diseases.
A healthy skin generally shows much elasticity,
flexibility, smoothness, and compactness; an even tem­
perature all over the body, winter and summer; further,
»
an even pale-red colour, a little brighter at the joints,
all over the body; and, closely examined, an admixture
of pale-red and pale-bluish specks, lost in each other,
through which the larger bluish veins shine forth.
Such a skin is not affected by the ordinary change
190 SKIN DISEASES.
of temperature; but the effect of a higher degree of
temperature, as in the reaction of cold, is manifested,
by the blue-red and pale-bluish specks named above
becoming more perceptible, (the colour being still all
even,) by greater smoothness, tone, and elasticity, or by
a more compact and rougher touch. Such a skin does
not perspire, even after some considerable bodily ex­
ertion; but the imperceptible evaporation is always
going on. When sweat breaks out, it is usually over
the whole body; it is fluid, does not dry too soon
when brought in contact with the atmospheric air, nor
does it leave any lassitude when it ceases, or is washed
off.
Nothing is easier than by attention from the very
earliest youth, to preserve such an organ, and thereby
stifle disease in its birth.
When the skin becomes faulty, it is indicated either
by great weakness and relaxation, the consequences
of which are profuse sweats at night, or attending the
least exertion ; or by great dryness, inactivity, and close­
ness, which intercept perspiration altogether.
In the first case, frequent cold washings, baths of
short duration, and particularly douches, carefully
used, when practicable, will be beneficial. Wet sheets
are useful too; they are changed according to circum­
stances ; the patient must, however, never perspire in
them, but take a full bath or good ablution when
wanned. After nocturnal perspirations, the body
should be washed with cold water immediately on
ERUPTIONS OF THE SKIN. 101
waking; a full bath, where practicable, (the utmost
care being taken to guard against catching cold on the
way to it,) is of course preferable.
We must observe, that if these night sweats occur
whilst undergoing a course of the water treatment,
the sweating in blankets, at the time of their occur­
rence, is omitted, in order not to weaken the patient
too much. These nocturnal sweats always argue some
disorders and irregularities, which are often the con­
sequence of the disease, and sometimes of an excess in
the treatment.
In the second case, suppression of perspiration, the
wet sheets are applied, frequently changed, until sweat
breaks out, when a good ablution or bath, in cold or
tepid water, follows, according as circumstances make
a higher or lower degree of temperature necessary;
this soon restores activity to the organ.
ERUPTIONS OF THE SKIN.
_
_
_
_
_ i
The views hitherto maintained in disorders of the
skin, namely, to guard the patient carefully against wet
and cold, have been quite refuted by the experience of
Priessnitz, Currie, Wright, Frohlich, Kreysig, Colbany,
and others. Nothing can equal the beneficial effects of
the water treatment in skin diseases. The divisions and
subdivisions of eruptions on the skin are numberless; but
for the hydrotherapeutic treatment, and especially for
192 ERUPTIONS OF THE SKIN.
the object of this work, a simple division into acute and
chronic, according to the slower or quicker appear­
ance, will amply suffice.
In the treatment of eruptions of the skin, we must
examine whether they are local—merely a disease of the
skin,—to what extent other organs, or the whole organ­
ism, are affected,—lastly, whether they have special
reference to any and what diseases,—and carefully adapt
our treatment to the constitution, age, sex, &c., accord­
ingly.
In acute eruptions, as in scarlatina, measles, critical
tumours, &c., the general treatment should be as
follows:—
Most acute skin eruptions being commenced or
accompanied with fever, the object will be to guard
against i t ; thus cooling the nervous and blood systems,
and at the same time regulating the due functions of the
skin. W et sheets, frequently changed, with half, and
sitz-baths of longer or shorter duration, are applied.
After the fever is subdued, the invalid remains longer in
the wet sheets, until perspiration takes place: this is
kept up for a while, according to the patient’s strength,
and followed by an ablution; exercise in the fresh air
should succeed this when at all practicable.
To aid digestion and support the general effect,
stimulating bandages are worn round the abdomen, and
soothing ones on the painful and afflicted parts. Local
baths are to be avoided where there is pain, or. where
the admixture of the fluids in the invalid is faulty,
ERUPTIONS OF THE SKIN. 193
because determination of blood to the parts may be
increased and give rise to inflammations, ulcers, &c.
Where great inactivity exists in .the skin, the wet sheets
must not be wrung out too much, and must be changed
more frequently—particularly if they get warm soon;
or alternate washings in tepid water may be resorted to.
The utmost caution is necessary in the use of sitz-
baths in many skin diseases, as in pox, scarlatina, mea­
sles, &c.
In cases where the extremities do not get sufficiently
warmed in the wet sheets, or where the abdominal
viscera do not duly perform their functions, and obstruc­
tions exist, the wet sheet should be applied from the
chest to the knees, hands and feet being wrapped in the
dry blanket.
When cold water is incautiously applied, and the
organism thereby violently excited—when the first
symptoms of fever are not regarded, convulsive appear­
ances frequently precede the breaking out of critical
and other acute eruptions. In bad cases tetanus may
even supervene; a half-bath of tepid water must be
immediately taken, and the patient rubbed in it, until
a violent cold shiver sets in, soon after which the
symptoms generally disappear; one or two hours may
sometimes elapse; of course, there should be fresh hands
when required. The patient is then put to bed; accord­
ing to circumstances wet sheets are alternated with half­
baths, until all feverish and convulsive appearances
N
194 ERUPTIONS OP THE SKIN.
abate, which circumstance generally occurs at the same
time with the full eruption of the skin.
If skin eruptions are accompanied with inflammatory,
catarrhal or nervous affections, which is particularly the
case in scarlatina, measles, &c., they must be specially
treated. All the water applied should be tepid, and
soothing compresses used chiefly on the afflicted parts,
chest, eyes, &c.
In some eruptions, particularly scarlatina, measles, &c.,
it is not absolutely necessary that the eruption should
be visible on the skin, or remain so during the whole
course of the disease. It breaks out sooner or later,
and sometimes not at all: it is sometimes perceived only
on single parts; disappears, returns to other parts occa­
sionally, and frequently over the whole body, and even
in its cavities.
Exposure to air and moderate movement is very de­
sirable in the intervals between the haths, &c.
The treatment with wet sheets, half-baths, and com­
presses is always to be preferred to the mere ablutions,
being safer and surer in their effect. The treatment
with the former must be continued until desquama­
tion of the skin takes place; the number and duration
being then diminished.
In simple cases of eruptions, only one wet sheet is ne­
cessary in the morning, and after perspiration has broken
out, an ablution in tepid water is taken, supposing the
individual to be otherwise healthy.
ERYSIPELAS AND PSORIC AFFECTIONS. 195
ERYSIPELAS.
The treatment of erysipelas is as follows:—sweating
in wet sheets, sitz-baths of forty to sixty minutes, the
patient’s strength permitting it, are alternated with the
application just now described. Many cases have been
cured in a few days by the above means, whilst with
the ordinary treatment in use, weeks elapse amid pains
and sufferings in the heated atmosphere of a sick room,
and frequently, after all, terminate in death.
PSORIC AFFECTIONS.
To chronic psoric eruptions of the skin, as to most
chronic diseases, we may apply the wise saying, that
“ prevention is better than cure for the latter will be
very slowly brought about by the water treatment, par­
ticularly if the individual lias used many medicines and
warm baths, and the disease is inveterate and of long
standing 5 in which case many months may elapse before
the disease is eradicated: and all the various applica­
tions of water in its manifold ways will have to be
industriously made use of. The revulsionary and
strengthening plans are here in their places, but very,
very gradually must the treatment be increased. Per­
severance is necessary here, and a degree of courage,
for frequently during the course of the treatment, violent

196 DISEASES OF THE ABDOMEN.
and painful acute appearances may arise, old and long-
forgotten sores may break out again, which often are
the forerunners of a radical cure. At such times, of
course, the treatment must be much modified.
Diet is an essential point: light, cool food, cool
clothing and bedding, and an avoidance of all violent
commotions must be enjoined: also plentiful drinking of
cold water, and active exercise in fresh air.
II. D i s e a s e s o f t h e E x c r e t i n g a n d S e c r e t i n g
O r g a n s o f t h e A b d o m e n .
Equally important with the skin is the due regulation
of the bowels; for all undue action thereof produces,
sooner or later, general disorder and serious diseases;
indeed, all diseases are more or less connected with an
undue fulfilment of the functions of the abdominal
viscera.
However easy to prevent this, the number ofsufferers
of chronic bowel complaints is vast, partly caused by
irregular living, and partly by a free use of drugs to
counteract the evil effects of the same, but which,
whilst they afford momentary relief, re-act very pre­
judicially on the whole organism, the bowels being the
first attacked, and destruction thence spread over the
whole body.
Weakness of digestion is speedily remedied by a
dietetic use of water, and a stimulating bandage round
the abdomen.
DIARRIKEA AND DYSENTERY. 197
DIARRHOEA.
This is often a very favourable critical appearance in
the course of an hydrotherapeutic treatment. When it
is violent and attended with pain, sitz-baths, long and
frequent, and, in need, two or three injections will
speedily rectify it. Friction of the abdomen must not
be omitted, nor water drinking.
A gentleman, during my residence at Grafenberg,
had been attacked with a violent fit of diarrhoea, which
kept him confined for two or three days to his bed,
during which cold fomentations were applied, extending
from the chest to the knees, and changed every hour.
He had a sitz-bath of one hour’s duration twice a day,
at first tepid water, then the chill taken off, and lastly
quite cold. On the third day, he had a sitz-bath, in
water of the temperature of 40° Fahrenheit, fresh
water being supplied every ten minutes; and changed
six times; this completed the cure, and he made his
appearance on the hills the same day.
DYSENTERY.
This disease is characterized by a violent and painful
griping of the bowels, pressing and frequent desire to
go to stool, little or nothing being voided in most in­
stances, in many, small quantities of blood, and is ge­
nerally accompanied with fever. Its average duration
is from seven to fourteen days, but frequently longer.
198 CHOLERA.
The nature of the accompanying fever determines the
danger or otherwise; the proper guidance and sub­
duing of the fever become the principal object. Ample
explanations have been given under the proper head
as to this. Two or three sitz-baths daily, of thirty to
sixty minutes, must not be omitted; temperature of
water according to circumstances. Injections are use­
ful too.
The greatest caution must here be exercised in the
quantity of water taken, as it may easily be overdone
and become injurious to the proper action of the sto­
mach and bowels. Small quantities only must be
taken, and not too cold.
CHOLERA.
This is by no means a new disease, but has long
been known in Europe, generally breaking out during
the months of August and September, when, with hot
days, the nights are cold. Its breaks out unexpectedly
with violent vomiting and diarrhoea* This mild form
of the disease is called the European cholera.
The Asiatic or epidemic cholera is more malignant,
and has spread to Europe since 1817. It breaks out
either suddenly, or with preceding symptoms, which
are a sensation of heaviness at the heart, loss of ap­
petite, restless nights, general relaxation and looseness;
this may continue for a few days. Diarrhoea and vo­
miting occur at the same tim e; a fluid resembling
CHOLERA. 199
ricewater being evacuated without any effort, in large
quantities. This causes a suppression of all the other
excretions and secretions, the body becomes emaciated
in a short space of time, the eyes and cheeks hollow,
the voice tremulous, the temperature of the body
sinks considerably, the extremities and the tongue
become ice cold, spasms and convulsions set in, and
dissolution puts an end to the sufferings, sometimes
after three or four hours, and in some cases after three
or four days. When the violence of the symptoms
abates, and the regular secretions and excretions re­
commence, recovery may be anticipated.
The cause of the disease lies in the relaxation of
those nerves of the abdomen and cavity of the chest,
which promote digestion, the circulation of the blood,
and the developement of heat. In consequence of this
relaxation, the blood becomes decomposed in the
body, being separated into watery and solid parts, the
former being evacuated by vomiting and diarrhoea, and
the latter remaining in the vessels in the shape of a
dark, clammy, viscous mass. All the symptoms are
easily accounted for by this.
When the cholera raged some few years ago in
Germany, Priessnitz saved a great many from death
in Grafenberg; he did not lose a single case. In
slight cases, tepid sitz-baths, of long duration—up
to two hours—were sufficient, with constant rub­
bing of the abdomen and lower extremities; cold
water being drunk in small quantities; injections
aided the cure. In more serious cases, where con-
200 CHOLERA.
vulsions and paralysis had already supervened, the
patient was put into a half-bath and rubbed until the
body got warm and steamed. After being dried, and
resting a while, the patient was wrapped in wet sheets
and sweated in them. Besides this, frequent tepid injec­
tions and sitz-baths, of an hour and a half long, cold water
being of course slowly administered all the while.
Diet should be very strict; fish—eels particularly—
fruit, salads, and fresh beer are injurious; it should
be light and nutritious; cleanliness must be particu­
larly observed, fresh air inhaled, dwellings and bed­
rooms well ventilated.
Dr. Casper, in Berlin, was also very successful in cur­
ing cholera; his plan was this:—the patient, if his skin
be dry and withered, is placed in a dry tu b ; if soft,
with a clammy perspiration, in a lukewarm water bath,
the water reaching up to the navel. Then four to five
pailsful of quite cold water are thrown over head,
chest, and back, downwards; at the same time, two
pailsful of cold water are thrown horizontally against
the chest from the end of the bath. Every thing must
be done quickly, and the patient then put to bed;
the bath being repeated in three or four hours. In
the interval, ice-cold bandages are placed on chest and
abdomen, and renewed when warm; the head is co­
vered similarly with ice-cold compresses, to prevent
an access of nervous fever, which often succeeds an
attack of cholera. Cold water for drink, by which the
disposition to vomit is much diminished, but increased
by warm drink. Frequent baths and frictions will
CONSTIPATION AND COLIC* 201
diminish, if not always prevent, the extension of the
ravages of this epidemic.
CONSTIPATION.
This will yield to proper treatment, and should in no
case be neglected, if a train of fatal diseases is to be
avoided. Appropriate, light food, plenty of fresh air
and exercise, and water drinking will do much to relieve
it. In more obstinate cases fresh water clysters, and
the stimulating bandage round the waist, will be useful.
With people of weak nerves, the injections may not act,
when they must, after a few trials, be discontinued, as
the parts must not be irritated. Repeated friction of
the abdomen in sitz-baths of short duration may then
be taken, and the organism strengthened. The douche
will likewise be useful.
COLIC.
Colic is a cutting, contracting, more or less violent
pain in the region of the navel. The cause should be
discovered first, thus, whether it is spasmodic, bilious,
flatulent, &c. The treatment should be local: during
the paroxysm, sitz-baths of an hour to an hour and a
half, in cold or tepid water, must be used until relief is
obtained; the abdomen, loins, calves of legs, and soles of
feet, must be well rubbed the while with wet hands, and
plenty of water drunk* After the sitz-baths an injec­
tion, then to bed; when warmed, an ablution. In
obstinate cases, more general treatment must be
adopted.
202 CARDIALGIA AND INCONTINENCE OF URINE.
CARDIALGIA.
This is a burning, cutting pain in the pit of the
stomach, thence spreading over the neighbouring parts,
often causing heart-burn and inclination to vomit, or a
plentiful discharge of clear lymph from the mouth.
The access is of short or long duration, and the causes
numerous. Plentiful drinking of cold water in small
quantities, added to a well regulated living, with the use
of half-baths, will be effectual in ordinary cases.
INCONTINENCE OF URINE.
Children are often subject to this disorder during the
night, and are frequently subjected to punishment for
it by ignorant parents, whilst it arises from a want of tone
in the secreting vessels; and, therefore, in lieu of pun­
ishment, the proper remedy should be applied. A due
physical education, frequent cold washings, &c., will be
a preventive of the evil. When it occurs in more
mature age, it argues weakness and relaxation of the

bladder, which sitz-baths of ten, fifteen, to twenty
minutes, frequent washing and rubbing, particularly of
the abdomen and loins, neck, and occiput, with wet
hands, and bandages in the regions of the bladder and
kidneys, will remedy. In obstinate cases, full-baths and
douches must be resorted to.
STRICTURE.
This dangerous malady must be treated variously,
according to the patient’s case. In chronic cases, the
whole course must be submitted to. I witnessed one
remarkable cure at Grafenberg, wliich will be found
under the proper head at the end of this volume.
III. B i l i o u s C o m p l a i n t s .
LIVER DISEASES.
Many people from hereditary causes, a sedentary life*
or faulty diet, are subject to hardenings of the liver,
which in its turn causes piles, hypochondriasis, gout,
jaundice, gallstones, &c. A yellowish colour in the face,
tympanitic abdomen, flatulency, constipation, and low
spirits, are pretty sure symptoms of a liver disease.
Daily drinking of cold water, exercise, and simple diet,
will do much in acute cases, to overcome, or at all events,
201 JAUNDICE AND CATARRH.
to check the disease. Chronic cases require vigorous
treatment, and some time, to be subdued.
JAUNDICE.
Known by the yellow colour of the eye and face, and
by dark yellow coloured urine. Acute cases will yield
to the treatment indicated above, chronic forms of both
diseases will require profuse sweating in dry blankets,
and wet sheets, full-baths, compresses over the liver,
douche, &c. The treatment requires much modification
according to the invalid’s symptoms.
IV. D i s e a s e s o f t h e M u c o u s G l a n d s .
When these complaints have become chronic and of
long standing, they will require much patience and per­
severance, if a Water-cure is attempted. Even the
acute forms are slower in being cured than most other
diseases.
CATARRH.
Persons subject to catarrhal affections are particularly
enjoined to observe the dietetic rules as to water, and
thus guard themselves against the fluctuations of tern-
CATARRH. 205
perature. There are two species of catarrh, the one is
the common cold in head or chest, the other is called
influenza.
In the first, known by every body, stimulating ban­
dages round the neck, and on the chest, or forehead,
according to the seat of the cold, daily washings, bathing,
and frictioQ, general and local, will effect a cure in a
brief space of time. In cases of rheum, sniffing up
water into the nostrils, and then ejecting it; in cough,
frequent gargling with cold water, and sole-baths of
fifteen to twenty minutes, are beneficial.
In more violent cases, a wet sheet from the throat to
the knees is applied to restore suppressed perspiration,
particularly to the affected organs; wet compresses are
at the same time applied to the neck, chest and back, and
are changed, when warm : after perspiration has broken
out, an ablution, and gentle exercise should be taken.
If the throat is inflamed or swollen, cold water is to
be taken as low down into the swallow as possible, and
ejected when warm, without gargling; the bandages
should be cooling at first, afterwards warming and more
stimulating.
If the invalid is feverish, has sleepless and restless
nights, he should be wrapped up over night in a wet
sheet, well wrung out, and covered over with blankets,
&c.: changing the sheet occasionally is necessary.
206 INFLUENZA AND HOOPING COUGIl.
INFLUENZA.
In addition to fulness in the head, heavy and lachry­
mose eyes, with frequent sneezing, rheum, and hoarse­
ness, which are the characteristics of common catarrh,
the influenza, which is a more violent and epidemic form
of catarrh, is accompanied with a high degree of fever,
corporeal and mental relaxation and sickness. In itself
it is not dangerous, but is decidedly epidemic and has
destroyed many lives, particularly in the years 1831-
32-33 and 37. It breaks out suddenly and spreads
rapidly.
The treatment is essentially the same as in catarrh,
but the sheets must be changed frequently. To allay
the concomitant inflammation of the eyes, eye-baths
and frequent covering of these organs with wet bandages
are recommended, also stimulating compresses to the
neck, and occiput baths of from ten to fifteen minutes*
duration.
HOOPING COUGH.
Most children are subject to this disease, which is
contagious: it sets in with difficulty of breathing, thirst,
a quick pulse, and other feverish symptoms, succeeded
by hoarseness, cough and difficulty of expectoration.
These symptoms continue a fortnight or longer, when
the disease assumes its characteristic form, namely, a
LES FLUEURS BLANCHES. 207
convulsive, strangulating cough, returning in fits which
terminate by vomiting.
The treatment, with a due regard to the infantile age,
will be much the same as in the last case. The child
must perspire in wet sheets,— then be bathed in
tepid water, and wear stimulating bandages round the
chest and neck; must drink, before breakfast particu­
larly, of water that has stood a little while corked up;
quite fresh or cold water being apt to irritate the already
excited organs. In violent attacks of hooping cough,
rubbing well the stomach, chest, neck, and soles of feet
with wet hands is very serviceable.
The bowels must be kept in due order, water clysters
applied, if constipated. Fresh air must be inhaled, the
children being duly guarded against catching cold.
LES FLUEURS BLANCHES.
In acute cases, when caused by excitement, excessive
hemorrhage, &c., sitz-baths of ten or fifteen minutes in
tepid water will be necessary, added to general cold
ablutions morning and evening, with a stimulating
bandage round the abdomen. In more obstinate cases,
injections of tepid water may be made after the sitz-
baths, but not during the period of menstruation. The
sitz-baths must, during that period, also be very cau­
tiously resorted to.
Chronic cases, originating in a faulty admixture of the
208 GONORRHCEA, GLEET, ETC.
secretions, will require more general treatment, in order
to promote a due circulation of the fluids.
GONORRHCEA, GLEET, ETC.
Gonorrhoea will yield to two tepid sitz-baths daily of
half-an-hour each, with friction of the abdomen, and
plentiful drinking of cold water,—all excitement and
exciting food being avoided;—frequent washing of the
parts is also necessary, and a general ablution in the
morning will facilitate the cure.
Gleet of long standing will require more energetic
treatment, sweating and full baths, douches, and short
sitz-baths. Water drinking and diet as above. Invo­
luntary emissions and impotence,—unfortunately too
prevalent, require a very strict diet, daily cold ablutions
with frictions. A sitz-bath of five or ten minutes in the
forenoon, and one, at least three hours before going to
bed ; wet compresses on the neck; also short occiput
baths, and an avoidance of all excitement. Heavy sup­
pers should be eschewed, and fatiguing exercise taken.
A few douche baths will exercise a beneficial effect, but
caution in their use is recommended.
GOUT AND RHEUMATISM. 209
SECTION V.
Cachexia.
Cachectic symptoms indicate chronic diseases, caused
by a vicious admixture of the solids and fluids of the
body, without any primary febrile, or nervous affection.
The gradual accumulation of morbid matter in various
parts of the organism, obstructs the performance of the
functions of the individual organ, and by degrees, of
the whole system.
The active agency of water re-establishes the proper
equilibrium and admixture of the fluids, but the most
rigid diet must be adhered to, not only during the
treatment, but for a long time after a cure has been
effected, if a relapse and a more dangerous attack is to
be prevented. The various species of cachexiae require
especial treatment.
GOUT AND RHEUMATISM.
Gout is a disease deeply rooted in the digestive appa­
ratus, disturbances in which frequently precede the full
formation of it for years. It consists in a violent pain
in the joints, and attacks all parts of the body; and is
caused by the deposition and accumulation of calcareous
particles in the parts affected. Gout is not dangerous in
itself, nay, frequently even serves to equalize existing
• irregularities in the body ; but when the system is not
o
210 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM.
strong enough to throw the gouty substances to the
surface, it gives rise to serious diseases, and when it
suddenly recedes upon the inner organs, it becomes
dangerous.
During an attack of gout, a very spare diet should
be adopted; animal food, spices, and wine, discarded;
medicines are of little or no avail; they are, indeed,
more apt to disturb the regular course of the attack.
Occasional attacks of gout might be termed acute;
but as they so soon become chronic, the treatment may
be comprised under one head, requiring vigorous ap­
plications—revulsionary treatment—a total change of
the admixture of the fluids of the body.
To subdue the fever, which generally accompanies
these attacks, wet sheets are used at first: they raise
the activity of the skin, and promote the morbid hu­
mours to the surface. This is effected and supported
by the constant wearing of compresses on the affected
parts and round the abdomen, by frequent half-baths
in tepid water; the whole body, with the exception of
the afflicted parts, being well rubbed. The duration
of the baths may be extended to fifteen minutes.
Water drinking, in small quantities at first, must not
be omitted; occasional clysters applied; as much rest
as possible is particularly desirable in inflammation
of the lower extremities, of the knees, ancles, &c.
When critical appearances, in the shape of perspira­
tion, eruptions, tumours, or diarrhoea, manifest them­
selves, the treatment—unless violent fever enjoins a
moderation thereof, or a necessity for the application
of the wet sheet—must be carried through by plentiful
sweating and baths, compresses, and where possible*
douches, in order to move the morbid matter from its
hiding place, and carry it off by the above means.
When the inflammatory stage has abated, the patient
must begin gradually to take more exercise, and in­
crease his allowance of water.
When the matter has collected in the joints, and
caused a stiffness and paralysis of single organs, I know
of no other remedy for a restoration than a persevering
water treatment, which, of course, must be applied
according to circumstances—strength, age of patient,
&c., and will, in very old cases, require time and per­
severance, and great caution in graduating it from mild
to more powerful means.
In fixed rheumatic pains, derivative baths are often
necessary, and stimulating bandages round the parts,
which must, moreover, be rubbed frequently in the
course of the day from thirtysto sixty minutes, with wet
hands, so as to promote the circulation in those parts.
In douching, the afflicted organs should not be ex­
posed to the stream, unless they are quite free from
pain and inflammation.
The older and more obstinate the malady, the less
seldom is it brought to an issue by crises in the form
of tumours on the skin, but more by perspiration,
urine, and diarrhoea, particularly with weaker persons.
We have the examples of Hippocrates, Galen,
o 2
GOUT AND RHEUMATISM. 211
212 SCROFULA AND RICKETS.
Sanctorius, Floyer, Hahn, Gremmler, &c., for the
application of cold water in gout, by ablutions, &c.
We recommend the utmost caution, for by a sudden
application of cold water to the gouty parts, they may,
for a while, be relieved, but, in the end, paralysed;
it is only by the systematic treatment that permanent
relief can be hoped for.
SCROFULA AND RICKETS.
Scrofula is peculiar to children, particularly such as
are born of weakly parents, and rests on a weakness of
the glandular system. General relaxation, combined
with fair complexion, light hair, fine skin, a late de-
velopement of the teeth, which easily get black and
fall out, disposition to cough and cold, are its charac­
teristics. In advanced stages, there are tumours on
the neck, in the armpits and groin, small and without
pain at first, but gradually becoming hard, large,
inflamed, and ending in suppuration. These are
some of the minor evils; a host of more vitally in­
jurious consequences are brought in its train, which
gradually lead to dissolution, namely, inflammation of
the eyes, nose, and joints, cardialgia, &c., &c. Fre­
quently, on the approach of puberty, under favourable
outward influences, the disease is satisfactorily subdued.
Among the causes are injudicious diet, where the
scrofulous inclination exists, particularly heavy fari-
naceous food, want of exercise and fresh air, damp
dwellings, and uncleanliness.
Proper dietetic observances are, at all events, more
useful than medicinal; leguminous vegetables and
potatoes are to be avoided; in their stead, animal food
and bread, not too new. Confectionery must be repu­
diated, also tea, coffee, wine, &c.; a little very light
beer occasionally would do no harm, but water is the
best, internally and externally applied.
Children are cured by the Priessnitz method; gentle
and short perspirations in dry blanket or wet sheets,
baths and washings in tepid water, compresses on the
abdomen, back, chest, and all suffering or threatened
organs; plenty of air and fresh water will accomplish
i t ; older children may take a sitz-bath of twenty mi­
nutes. These means, with the proper diet, will be
found to perform wonders, even in cases where in­
flammation of the eyes, suppuration of the parts,
caries of the bones, and affections of the spine have al­
ready supervened.
In scrofulous inflammation of the eyes, cooling
compresses are applied, at the same time stimulating
ones on the neck to act as a derivative; occiput baths,
of ten to fifteen minutes’ duration, are employed for
the same purpose.
In scrofulous inflammation of the ears, wet pieces
of linen are worn in them night and day, a hand­
kerchief being tied over the ears : they must be washed
often, and the adjacent parts rubbed well; head-baths,

214 SYPHILIS.
sides and occiput, of five to fifteen minutes, and fre­
quent injections into the ears, are useful. Sea bathing
is particularly beneficial for scrofulous subjects.
What we stated above appertains strictly to rickets,
known by a swelling, softening, and distortion of the
bones. The dietetic observances must here, too, be
strictly enjoined, not only as regards food, but also
water.
SYPHILIS.
Many of the Grafenberg patients are syphilitic—
mercurial ones,—some that had been reduced to the verge
of the grave, and scarcely able to walk. With such,
of course, the treatment has to be applied in the mildest
forms; indeed, sometimes only dietetically for some
weeks. This alludes particularly to such as suffer from
secondary symptoms; such patients mostly have little
warmth, and too great a shock might become injurious.
For primary symptoms, sweating twice a day, as long as
the patient can bear it without getting fatigued, prefer­
ably in wet sheets, (being safer than the blanket,) and
pieces of wet linen placed on the eruptions, with plenti­
ful drinking of cold water, and exercise in the fresh air
without fatigue. Daily, two or three sitz-baths, of
sixty to eighty minutes, first, in tepid water; with a
mild, not too nourishing, cooling diet, avoiding all sour,
salty, heating, and flatulent food and drink.
In secondary symptoms, profuse sweating will be
ELEPHANTIASIS. 215
essential for a radical cure; of course, it must be
adapted to the patient’s strength, and not by any means
overdone. To all critical appearances, the utmost
attention must be paid, and the treatment regulated
accordingly. The crises in these diseases are often
truly violent and of excruciating pain; they appear, fre­
quently, at the lower extremities in the shape of ulcers,
and on other parts of the body as eruptions—all of a
syphilitic character. Old forgotten wounds will, under
such circumstances, frequently make their appearance,
attended with great agony. The utmost caution and
discretion must be exercised during the whole progress
of the treatment.
The open and painful parts must be carefully guarded
against the fall of the douche, which is used during the
treatment, if the patient be pretty robust: likewise,
against cold. They must, therefore, be well covered
whilst douching and when in the full bath, also in
the sweating blanket.
ELEPHANTIASIS.
This disease mostly affects the feet. The legs of
people so affected become scaly, rough, and in its
advanced stages, very large like the legs of an elephant.
Some cases of cure are spoken of as having been effected
by Priessnitz. The treatment is vigorous; sweating in
dry blankets twice a day, followed by cold water baths,
plentiful drinking of cold water, stimulating bandages
216 GRAVEL, ETC.
round the stomach and round the diseased leg. Occa­
sional sitz-baths are also taken. The crises are violent,
and discharge much foetid matter. During their ap­
pearance, the sweating is modified, and the blanket
replaced by the wet sheets. The douche is discon­
tinued, sitz-baths increased in number and duration,
the bandages more frequently changed, and occasional
derivative baths taken.
GRAVEL AND STONE IN THE BLADDER.
In its origin the disease may be checked by proper
hydrotherapeutic treatment: and when in its advanced
stages a surgical operation becomes necessary, it will be
much facilitated by such treatment. This will, of
course, vary considerably according to the accompany­
ing symptoms. Where violent pain exists about the
region of the kidneys and the bladder, soothing com­
presses must be applied on the parts, derivative foot­
baths of twenty to thirty minutes, and similar sitz-
baths of fifty to sixty minutes. The ejection of gravel
is much facilitated by tepid half-baths and friction of
the whole body, particularly of the back, thighs, and
regions of the kidneys and bladder.
The half-baths should be continued until the pain
has abated. If these proceedings cause feverish symp­
toms, the soothing treatment must be employed for
some days, namely, wet sheets, changed more or less
WORMS. 217
frequently according to circumstances, and after a gentle
perspiration, a tepid half-bath.
Gravel has been cured in six weeks by water drink­
ing only.
Diet should be nourishing and simple, plenty of cold
water taken, and not too fatiguing exercise.
WORMS.
Dietetic regimen is certainly the principal considera­
tion in this disease, worms originating in weakness,
aided by a faulty admixture of the fluids; nothing is so
well calculated to destroy the tendency to the disease
as a proper application of the hydrotherapeutic treat­
ment. Cold water always acting more effectually and
quicker in children than in adults, will speedily effect
the desired end. Simple and spare diet, an avoidance
of all flatulent, heavy, and fat nourishment, daily
repeated washing and bathing of the whole body, plen­
tiful drinking of cold water, and plenty of stirring exer­
cise in the open air, frequent clysters—particularly for
ascarides—stimulating bandages round the abdomen—
carefully applied so as to prevent the child catching
cold—will soon expel the intruders.
Should there be a scrofulous tendency, the treatment
must be adapted accordingly.
If the so-called worm fever sets in, the wet sheets
must be put in requisition.
218
HYDROPHOBIA.
Hydrophobia is caused by the bites of mad animals.
It is indicated by spasmodic convulsions of the throat,
inability to swallow, and an abhorrence of liquids. The
data are too uncertain to form a fixed rule for water
treatment.
Priessnitz is stated to have made some experiments
with mad dogs, and succeeded in restoring them. He
had the animals tied fast, and cold water poured over
them several times, by which the paroxysms were
increased wofully; notwithstanding this, the ablutions
were repeated, until after a violent cold shiver the
symptoms abated. Abundant frothy saliva then flowed
from the mouths of the animals ; perspiration followed,
and was kept up by coverings; milk which was put
' before them they eagerly swallowed. Another bath
followed the perspiration, and the cure was effected;
the animals eating freely and drinking fresh water.
This would argue a necessity for great firmness, as
in case of being alarmed by the increasing symptoms,
and desisting from the treatment, the result might have
proved very different.
In cases of bites of mad dogs, after cutting out, or
cauterising the wound, the applications of stimulating
wet bandages might possibly be advantageous, aided by
general treatment. So many means have been ineffec­
tually tried, that the hydrotherapeutic treatment cer­
tainly merits a trial.
219
LOCKED-JAW.
As to locked-jaw, I could receive no authentic in­
formation at Grafenberg: the disease arises from a
cachectic state of the body, and is frequently caused by
very slight local injury, such as cutting, scratching, or
wounding a finger. A few days after such accident,
sometimes a day or two after, symptoms are manifested
by slight stiffness in the back part of the neck, which
gradually increases and renders the moving of the head
painful and difficult; swallowing is impeded, and a
great tightness perceived about the chest, with shooting
pains in the back; the jaws become stiff, and the teeth
at last set together so closely as not to admit of the
least opening. According to the direction the spas­
modic affections take, the disorder increases in violence,
and assumes more alarming forms, the eyes becoming
fixed, face hideously distorted, &c. Most cases prove
fatal under the usual medical treatment. The hydro-
therapeutic plan should be tried: after the local irrita­
tion is subdued by wet bandages, a profuse perspiration
in the blanket should be promoted, succeeded by a
half-bath and much friction, until relief is obtained.
The inference as to the result, judging from other dis­
eases treated, I should say, is favourable.
220
DROPSY.
This disease is very prevalent among us, and carries
off many victims; it may be interesting to trace its
origin. In all the cavities of the body, and in the innu­
merable cellular structures, there is an infinite number
of capillary vessels, which constantly exhale a vapoury
fluid, whereby the friction of the organs against each
other is prevented, and the performance of their func­
tions facilitated. Corresponding to these there are
absorbing vessels which imbibe this serum or secretion,
and carry it back into the circulation; the vapoury
fluid is condensed into water, and the accumulation of
this causes dropsy ; it has different names according to
the different parts of the body affected. In every drop­
sical subject, the urine flows sparingly, the evaporation
by the skin is impeded, and the alvine excretions are
irregular.
It will thus be quite evident that the drinking of
water cannot aggravate dropsical tendencies, as some
are led to suppose; but that, in as far as water is a
powerful solvent, diluting and attenuating the fluids,
and thus facilitating their due circulation, it aids in
restoring the faulty action of the vessels, mostly brought
about by other diseases, and checks the dropsical ten­
dency by removing the causes, namely, increasing the
secretions from the kidneys, from the skin, and the
intestines: nothing is better able to do this than water.
CONSUMPTION.
Where dropsy is chronic, little can be hoped for from
the water treatment; but in acute cases, when a total
change in the admixture of the fluids may yet be
brought about, it will prove effectual by raising the
activity of the various functions of the body, and
particularly of the skin, thereby diminishing vicious
humours and forming healthy secretions.
Sweating in dry blankets or wet sheets, followed by
short, strengthening, full-baths; douches, frequent sitz-
baths, stimulating bandages round the stomach and
suffering parts; frequent rubbing of the latter with wet
hands, plentiful drinking of cold water and enjoyment
of fresh air; and, where necessary, frequent clysters, will
have to be employed.
221
CONSUMPTION.
This disease in its advanced stages, as we stated else­
where, has little to hope for from the water treatment;
more, however, can be said of incipient consumption,
where judicious treatment may arrest the progress of
the disease. Often as we have repeated the necessity
of great caution in the application of cold water, it
must be doubly enjoined here; for, where the lungs
are already deeply compromised, death may be accele­
rated by injudicious treatment.
A mild and discreet water diet, adopted in youth, or
during the first developement of the disease, will check
222 CONSUMPTION.
the tendency; but in no disease is the risk of doing too
much so great as in the one under consideration. Fre­
quent washings of the chest and abdomen, with soothing
bandages applied round these parts, added to a cool,
light diet, with an avoidance of corporeal and mental
excitement, should be commenced with. Gradually
washings of the whole body succeed, and, after a while,
foot, sitz, and half-baths are added; and it is only when
all symptoms have disappeared, and the tendency has
been fully suppressed, that full-baths and douches may
be resorted to; but the fullest conviction should be
arrived at of the state of the invalid, before these
powerful remedies are employed.
From what we have stated, it will be evident how
imperative it is to be satisfied regarding the actual pro­
gress of the disease—the liability to err being very
great—in order to be able to judge as to the policy of
the application of the water treatment. In some cases,
Friessnitz resorts to the following expedient. He has
the patient put into a tepid sitz-bath in the morning,
from the bed, covering the other parts of the body care­
fully, and keeping him in it thirty or forty minutes:
after which the patient takes a little moderate exercise
and returns to bed. If a feverish state then sets in ;
which, however, requires a practised eye to discern, it
is a sure sign of the disease having gained ground, and
from the degree of fever, a competent observer will be
able to judge correctly as to the extent of its ravages.
This deserves to be carefully regarded, as giving the

diagnosis of the disease, long before the hectic fever
demonstrates its rapid progress.
SECTION VI.
Diseases of the Nervous System.
Priessnitz is rather loth to receive patients suffering
from severe nervous affections; as the cure is frequently
protracted, and where sufficient time and perseverance
cannot be employed, if the water treatment is suddenly
discontinued, and improper treatment afterwards pur­
sued, the consequences may be serious.
Many diseases are denominated nervous, purely ner­
vous, with which the nervous system—the animal func­
tions, namely, the external and internal senses, the in­
voluntary action of the muscles, &c.,—has little to do;
but the causes being difficult to define, the general, sig­
nificant, and yet often unmeaning, term of nervous
affection, u nervous weakness,” Is applied.
There are few, perhaps no diseases, by which the
nervous system is not more or less affected. Either
chronic nervous weakness prevents a recovery, or the
disorders act prejudicially on the functions of the nerv­
ous system, and prevent the free working of the vital
power. Chronic nervous weakness, on the other hand,
arises from long standing greater or minor disorders of
224 DISEASES OP TIIE
other organs of the body, obstructing the free activity
of the nervous system, and gradually relaxing it. When
this weakness is very considerable, it becomes interwoven
with every disease, which thus assumes more or less of a
nervous character. Thus, concluding nervous disorders
to be a secondary state, or consequence of other diseases,
we may infer that the cure can only be a work of time.
Experience has proved that most nervous disorders
originate in weakened digestive organs, at least most
sufferers from nervous complaints have these functions
much debilitated, and recover where success attends the
endeavour to strengthen these parts. In the treatment
of nervous diseases, therefore, the organism must be
strengthened, and the activity of its functions raised;
but as the consequences of over exciting the nerves may
be very detrimental, the most scrupulous graduation is
necessary. Sweating, cold bathing, douching, &c., can
therefore not be entertained, but tepid baths, short cold
ablutions, foot and sitz-baths, soothing, mildly strength­
ening, wet sheets, and cooling bandages must be em­
ployed.
Where the nervous weakness is great, quite cold
water must be administered with the utmost caution, for
it has happened that such patients have, though seem­
ingly enjoying the cold baths and douches in the com­
mencement, gradually sunk under increasing lassitude;
too much caloric having been withdrawn from their
bodies.
NERVOUS SYSTEM. 2 2 5
All appearances during the treatment must therefore
be zealously watched.
In cases where the nervous system is not so deeply
affected, where some degree of strength actually exists,
success may be anticipated—a due regard being always
paid to the invalid’s strength, modifying the applications
accordingly—for as there is generally a proportionately
small developement of heat in such cases, care must be
taken to give time for the proper reaction, and never to
undertake a bath, an ablution, a clyster, &c., until the
feeling of cold, however trifling, caused by a previous
application, has quite yielded to a due feeling of warmth.
We impress this particularly on our readers, and for the
same reason also, enjoin caution in the quantity of water
drank, to proportion it to the power of generating
warmth in the body, and by no means to overdo it.
The diet should be light, nutritious, but not exciting
or heating: all warm, relaxing, and heating drink
should be avoided, and particularly tea. Sea-baths are
excellent preparations, as also auxiliaries to the cure,
and particularly as an after cure, but we recommend
strict attention to the rules in the first part of this
volume, and a due regard to the state of the invalid.
SPASMS IN THE CHEST AND NIGHTMARE.
These complaints occur at short or long intervals,
and consist of a contracting pain in the chest, with a
p
sense of suffocation. When organic defects of the lungs,
of the heart, or other important organs are the cause, a
radical cure of course cannot be expected, but a proper
water diet may check the virulence of the disease.
In persons subject tonightmare, heavy and late suppers
should be avoided, and foot-baths, acting as a derivative,
of thirty minutes, taken at bed time* If the invalid
awakes from anxious dreams, cold washings of the chest,
drinking cold water, with warming bandages applied
round the chest and stomach, during the rest of the
night,—in more violent cases, derivative foot and sitz-
baths,—are to be recommended.
In sudden fits of spasms in the chest, foot-baths,
reaching to the middle of the calves of the legs, or half­
baths should be taken, the feet being well rubbed, the
chest washed with cold water, and covered with warming
bandages ; after which a clyster is applied, and the
patient put to bed, and when warned, if the fits have
been very violent, two or three wet sheets are used, in
which the patient remains until warmed, or until he
perspires gently, according to circumstances, and then he
is bathed in a half-bath. If after having been to bed,
there is a calm sleep, it should not be interrupted, but
if sleep be uneasy, if the breathing be convulsive, the
foot-baths should be immediately repeated, and when
*
the attack is subdued, a wet sheet applied.
Spasmodic affections of the chest in children are
treated similarly, but the applications modified to suit
their age. Clysters are said to take excellent effect
226 SPASMS IN THE CHEST AND NIGHTMARE.
PARALYSIS.
with children in such cases. The bandages round the
neck and chest must be carefully changed, hands and
feet rubbed well, and fresh water, at first in small
quantities, administered.
PARALYSIS.
The loss of feeling or motion, or of both, in any part
of the body, is called paralysis: it arises either suddenly
through a fit of apoplexy, or gradually through a variety
of diseases, a sense of numbness, coldness and paleness,
and occasionally slight convulsive twitches preceding it.
Generally one side of the body is attacked, but not
unfrequently does it seize the lower extremities, or the
arms only, sometimes one side of the face, one eyelid,
the tongue) or muscles of deglutition, &c. Palsy does
not threaten immediate danger, and if it has not con­
tinued too long—if disorganisation of the part has not
taken place—if there be still some sensibility in it—
much may be hoped for from the hydrotherapeutic
treatment. This must be adapted to the strength of the
invalid, and never be over-hurried; there is danger in
doing so. Wet sheets should be commenced with, mild
perspiration, (profuse in otherwise healthy persons,) fre­
quent stimulating bandages round the affected parts, and
round the abdomen, water drinking, clysters, sometimes
also local baths of thirty to sixty minutes and longer,
aided by much friction, compresses on the occiput, neck,
• p 2
228 APOPLEXY.
and spine ; frequent vigorous rubbing of the spine with
wet hands, and when improvement sets in, the douche,
added to proper diet and plenty of exercise, will do
wonders, sometimes in desperate cases, as has been
demonstrated by the cures of Priessnitz and others.
The critical appearances are always violent in such cases:
many and frequent eruptions, disappearing and return­
ing with renewed strength, considerable tumours, violent
diarrhoea, feverish appearances, and hemorrhages occupy
much of the invalid’s patience.
A t such times the wet sheets and bandages, local,
derivative, and strengthening baths, and clysters are
extensively used.
APOPLEXY.
Apoplexy consists of the sudden suppression of the
activity of the brain and nerves, characterized by uncon­
sciousness, loss of sensibility and power of motion—
respiration and the circulation of the blood being inter­
rupted. Plethoric people, of short build, short neck,
and broad shoulders, are apoplectic subjects: such
should pay the strictest regard to a proper dietetic
regimen, in order to steer clear of the attacks, the con­
sequences of which are fatal in most cases.
In cases of apoplexy the half-bath must be resorted
to, two men rubbing well the feet, temples, spine from
the occiput downwards, the region of the pit of the
CONVULSIONS. 229
stomach, &c. When the fit is over, clysters must be
applied, also stimulating bandages on the spine, back of
the head and over the stomach: wet sheets follow, and
when warmed therein, a tepid half-bath.
Perseverance and uninterrupted activity must be
exercised by the presiding medical man: where there is
the least symptom of life and warmth, even where vene­
section produces no blood, the friction should be con­
tinued, until the lungs and blood vessels resume their
functions and the skin begins to steam, and not desisted
from until the body actually assumes a death-like
coldness.
When recovered, the after cure must be suited to the
individual, and dietetic observances strictly observed.
CONVULSIONS.
Half-baths, in tepid water, will be necessary, with
friction of the whole body, particularly of the back,
loins and feet, and occasionally pouring over the patient
water of similhr temperature: the patient remaining in
the bath until all appearances cease, which generally is
the case after a violent cold shiver has set in. Priess-
nitz states the case of a woman who was kept in the
bath nine hours, constantly rubbed by a couple of
women, when the cold shiver set in, and she recovered;
it is advisable to administer a little cold water during the
230 EPILEPSY.
bath, if practicable. The subsequent treatment depends
on circumstances, and when the fits return, the half-bath
must be again resorted to ; the exertion being great, the
after treament should tend to strengthen the patient.
EPILEPSY.
Priessnitz is said to have effected some cures of
epilepsy, but he does not consider the disease uncondi­
tionally curable. In the purely nervous forms of
epilepsy—caused by excesses of all sorts, by excessive
mental exertions added to nightly watchings, by fright,
or other commotions of the mind, by the sight of an
epileptic subject, &c.,—a favourable result may be
expected; by no means, however, where organic defects
of the brain exist, or complications of other incurable
diseases, such as organic defects of the lungs, heart, &c.:
an alleviation of sufferings by a judicious water treat­
ment is all that can be effected.
In the favourable cases, the treatment should tend to
the strengthening of the nervous system: the cause of
the disease should be discovered, its removal be the prin­
cipal aim, and the treatment regulated accordingly. Fits
are said to have been prevented by the constant applica­
tion of wet compresses on the head, changed every two
or three minutes, one compress remaining in the water,
whilst the other is on the head: this would apply prin­
cipally to comparatively strong persons; weakly and
HYPOCHONDRIASIS AND HYSTERIA. 231
enervated subjects should not have quite cold fomenta­
tions in the commencement, but gradually colder ones.
ST. VITUS'S DANCE.
This disease is incident to youth, and consists in con­
vulsive spasms in the arms and legs: the disorder is not
of a dangerous kind, and in most cases will yield to
proper dietetic observances, without attempting too
irritating a treatment. Sea-baths are particularly use­
ful in this, as in all spasmodic affections.
HYPOCHONDRIASIS AND HYSTERIA.
Hypochondriasis originates in a chronic disease of
the abdomen, caused by costiveness, sufferings, and ex­
cesses of all kinds, which by neglect or bad treatment
gradually so much depresses the nervous system, that
the disease is considered purely nervous, and generally
treated as such, but which, as it seems to me, can
only be cured by removing the cause. The disease ap­
pertains principally to the male sex, and is characterized
by a morbid anxiety of the patient for the state of his
health, the person delighting in various medicinal expe­
riments for its improvement.
Hysteria appertains chiefly to the female sex, and
may also be said to originate in other diseases, the
2S2 HYPOCHONDRIASIS AND HYSTERIA.
nervous system—-being much more excitable in the
female—gradually becoming depressed, and thus as­
suming even more of a purely nervous character than
hypochondriasis.
In the treatment of both diseases, therefore, the
object is to strengthen the nervous system, the abdo­
minal organs and their functions.
In Grafenberg and other continental institutions,
we see numberless hypochondriacs and hysterical fe­
males of weakly constitutions, gain new life by a few
months* residence there.
Premising that an avoidance of mental commotions,
and strict, but not too sparing diet, are unconditional
points, we proceed with the general treatment which of
course must be carefully’adapted to the individual.
Sitz-baths, of thirty to sixty minutes, constant wear­
ing of stimulating bandages round the abdomen, fre­
quent clysters, plentiful drinking of cold water and
frequent gargling with the same, particularly in the
morning, much exercise in the open air, cold washings
at the commencement, afterwards gentle perspirations
in wet sheets, and a very moderate use of the douche,
will slowly, but surely lead to health. The treatment
should be gradual, so as not to be exposed to the
chance of being deceived by the stimulating influence
which applications of cold water, if carried to the full
extent, generally have, and which therefore should not
be made use of to such an extent, until the patient is
well inured to the element.
MENTAL DISEASES. 233
Hysteria must of course be treated with a most
careful regard to the delicate frame of the sufferer,
and particularly to the frequent necessity of changing,
or modifying the various applications, such as sitz-baths,
half-baths, and full baths, during menstruation or dis­
turbances therein.
Spasmodic hysterical fits yield in a few minutes to
foot-baths, the soles of the feet, face, region of the
pit of the stomach, being rubbed well with fresh
water, the palms of the hands of the patient being
rubbed against each other. When the fits are over,
a clyster is applied; then—if other circumstances do
not interdict it—a sitz-bath, in tepid water, at the
same time cooling compresses on the head and chest,
when necessary; wet sheets may, if required, be sub­
stituted for sitz-baths, a half-bath succeeding the
gentle perspiration or warming in the sheet, as the
case may be. The treatment should be continued for
a while to prevent a relapse.
MENTAL DISEASES.
Diseases of the mind are caused by over excitement
or blunting of the faculties, produced by a variety ol
circumstances. Water is the best beverage for per­
sons thus afflicted; it quiets and soothes the hot blood
of the raging, and attenuates the thick fluids of the
melancholy. The manifold outward applications are
likewise highly serviceable, particularly cold ablutions,
while the patient sits in a lukewarm bath.
Horn relates a great many cases cured by these
simple, but wonderfully efficacious, means. Washing
the head with cold water, or placing wet cold ban­
dages on the same—washing the whole body with cold
water is beneficial in its consequences. Douche baths,
full baths, and sudden immersions in cold water, are
particularly useful in all mental diseases.
234 SCALDING, BURNING, CHILBLAINS, ETC.
SCALDING, BURNING, ETC.
Immediately after a scalding or burning, put the
affected part in cold water, and keep it there until the
pain and heat subsides, or place linen, steeped in
water, on the part, changing it, however, as soon as
it gets warm; if the pain returns, the immersions are
repeated; and when the skin is blistered, must be
continued until all pain is withdrawn; the blisters are
then carefully pricked with a fine needle, and after
the discharge, wet bandages applied.
CHILBLAINS, ETC.
Numbness, occasioned by cold, is remedied by rub­
bing the part with ice-cold water, until the natural
colour returns; the stimulating bandage should then
be applied.
STINGS, BRUISES, WOUNDS. 235
Chilblains should be washed frequently with ice-cold
water, and kept in it for a few minutes, several times
daily, after which rub the parts dry; a cure is by these
means effected in a few days.
STINGS OF INSECTS.
Stings of bees, wasps, gnats, &c., are best cured by
repeated applications of cold wet bandages, to be re­
newed frequently; of course the stings, when left
behind, should be extracted.
BRUISES, ETC.
Cold wet bandages are the best remedy for all
bruises, &c., caused by pressure, or other mechanical
influences, as also in dislocations and sprains; they
are then much preferable to warm and spirituous fo­
mentations, in allaying and checking inflammation.
WOUNDS.
Wounds of all sorts, particularly from contusions,
&c., are best healed by cold wet bandages, to stop the
bleeding, to allay the inflammation, and with it the
pain and swelling, to moderate the discharge, and pre­
vent an unsightly scar; in a word, to heal the wound
in the quickest and safest manner.

DIET, AIR, EXERCISE, ETC.
L ife exhausts the powers from which it proceeds,
and decomposes and destroys the organism in which it
reigns; it can, therefore, only be maintained by a res­
titution of what is lost; this is effected by nourishment
—in the shape of food or drink, which plays the most
important part in the economy of life. In another part
of this work I have had occasion to speak of the bever­
ages in use, of their beneficial and detrimental ten­
dency ; it now remains for me briefly to allude to the
other important point, namely, food.
ANIMAL FOOD.
Dr. Cheyne has observed that animal food (and arti­
ficial liquors) was not intended for human creatures,
who neither have those strong organs fit for digesting it,
(as birds and beasts of prey), nor naturally such vora­
cious appetites; but, as we are not likely to discard
animal food from our tables, and as its nourishing pro­
perties are well known, our aim should be to simplify
the preparation of it as much as possible, paying due
DIET. 237
regard to our constitution, habits, &c. Food in general
should be of a kind to be easily assimilated to (taken
up as a part of) our bodies, easily digested, and nutri­
tious. It is a well-known fact that the nourishing pro­
perty of food and its digestibility do not always go
hand in hand; every one should, therefore, judge of
his own capabilities in that respect.
Animal food is the most nourishing, and tolerably
digestible, particularly if of young animals; and is
therefore very proper for adults. Children under six
years of age should have no animal food at all. The
meat of mammalious animals is best adapted for man;
birds are next in order; fish should be eaten mode­
rately, and more rarely.
We must also have some regard as to the exciting
power of the food; for which reason lobsters, crabs,
&c., should not be indulged in too much.
Animals living in the open air are more healthy, and
yield better meat, than those fed in stables; the latter
yield a soft meat, but, on account of the exuberance of
fat, it is injurious—fat pork particularly.
Salt meat is too exciting, and smoked assumes a
nature quite foreign to the human organism. Simple
roasting or boiling is the best way of preparing meat.
VEGETABLE FOOD.
Vegetables have less nourishing properties than ani­
mal food; but they moderate the process of life, and
238 DIET.
afford it a more quiet and even devclopement. It is as
with atmospheric air: were we to inhale pure oxjrgen,
life would bum the brighter, but be the sooner extin­
guished ; by its admixture with nitrogen, however, the
process of life is checked, moderated, and maintained
longer: for this reason we should always take vegetable
and animal food conjointly.
The various sorts of cabbages contain vegetable fibre,
water, little saccharine matter, mucus or gluten: they
nourish very little, are hard of digestion, and produce
flatulency; they are also liable to become putrificd
sooner than any other vegetable, and should therefore
be used soon after cutting. Weak stomachs should
avoid them.
Fresh fruits contain saccharine matter, vegetable
mucus, starch, and citric acid. They are moderately
nourishing, and by their attenuating properties facili­
tate and promote the customary excretions. Their use
is thus salubrious, but persons who suffer from acidity
of the stomach, and whose digestive organs are weak,
should avoid taking them in any quantity.
Saccharine roots, such as carrots, are beneficial for
the healthy; they are less fit for weakly, flatulent per­
sons. Farinaceous roots, such as potatoes, are nutritious
and excellent for adults taking plenty of exercise; chil­
dren and persons of sedentary habits should use them
sparingly ; children of scrofulous tendency should avoid
them.
Almonds, nuts, and similar productions, contain much
DIET. 2 3 9
gluten, starch, and oil, which make them very nutri­
tious, but difficult of digestion : they are, therefore, only
fit for unimpaired digestive organs.
Leguminous vegetables, composed of vegetable fibre
and mucus, starch, &c., are very nutritious, but require
a powerful digestive apparatus. Eaten with the husks
they cause flatulency, colic, &c. Green pulse have less
of the above-named component parts, but more water
and saccharine matter; are less nourishing, but more
easily digested than when quite ripe.
Farinaceous food. Flour is composed of gluten,
starch, and saccharine matter: by the first-named com­
ponent parts, it becomes particularly nutritious; flour
made of Indian corn, barley and rice, has no gluten.
Wheaten flour is the best and most nourishing, and has
the best taste; but it depends on the preparation and
ingredients combined with it, such as milk, fat, eggs,
sugar, &c. If fermented, farinaceous food becomes
more digestible and less flatulent; unfermented, with
the above ingredients, it is highly nutritive, and very
suitable for healthy persons, and such as have much cor­
poreal exercise; but in children and persons of sedentary
habits, it is apt to produce a series of disorders, if too
much indulged in.
Rye bready in connexion with other nourishing and
digestible food, is adapted for a healthy and strong
stomach; weakly persons and children should take small
portions only, it being apt to cause acidity, diarrhoea,
&c.
240 DIET.
Barley is very nutritious and mucilaginous: a decoc­
tion of barley is an excellent drink in all inflammatory
diseases and affections of the chest. Barley water with
gum, is a useful diluent and demulcent, in dysury and
strangury. The ancients used a decoction of barley in
acute diseases, and as an aliment.
Oats, though less nourishing than rice and wheat, are
yet nutritious and of easy digestion. Oats form the
chief bread in Scotland and Ireland, and some of the
northern counties of England. Gruel made with the
flour, namely oatmeal, digests easily, has a soft mu­
cilaginous quality, and is used for drink and food in
fevers, coughs, hoarseness, &c.
Cheese when prepared from rich milk, and well made,
is very nutritious in small quantities, but when hard and
ill prepared, mostly indigestible, especially for weak
stomachs.
Fresh butter is nourishing and relaxing, but readily
becomes sour, and generally speaking agrees with few
stomachs, being hard of digestion, if taken in large
quantities, particularly when heated. Rancid butter is
one of the most unwholesome and indigestible of all
foods.
Spices (containing ethereal oil, and sometimes an
acrid principle) might aid digestion, if used in extreme
moderation, with fat and glutinous aliments: abused,
they excite the nerves and cause inflammation; in time,
weakness of the digestive organs, and by degrees of the
whole oiganism.
A IR . 241
I will now briefly consider the remaining dietetic
agents: air, exercise, sleep, See,
That vast expanse of air by which we are surrounded,
and which, in spite of all influences, retains its na­
ture, is the most important and essential to our
existence. Changes of air contribute greatly to our
health, or to the engendering of diseases, which will be
manifest by viewing its composition, already mentioned
in another place: generally twenty parts oxygen and
eighty parts nitrogen. The nearer the air approaches
to these component parts, the purer it is, and the
better for health; hence the disastrous consequences
and diseases arising from closely inhabited dwellings,
where the air becomes filled with the exhalations of the
inhabitants, and the oxygen soon destroyed. The at­
mospheric air, loaded with electricity, or deficient of it,
elastic, heavy, or light; filled with vapoury or watery
particles, or too dry ; subjected to a constant change of
temperature ; containing so many causes influencing our
health, depends too little on our will to adapt it to our
purposes ; but what we are enabled to do, is to resist its
influences as much as possible: we must not become
effeminate, but endeavour to steel our bodies, so as to
bear its changes without detriment. It is therefore
necessary that our dwellings and rooms should be high
and lofty, open to the light and sun, and fresh air ad­
mitted every day. Cleanliness and frequent ventilation
of their dwellings will enable the humblest of our fellow
creatures to ward off many noxious influences.
Q
242 CLOTHING, EXERCISE, SLEEP.
Clothing should neither be too cold nor too warm,
but adapted to the season: warm clothing should par­
ticularly be avoided in youth, as it prevents the due
evaporation by the skin, and exposes the wearer to be
influenced prejudicially by the atmospheric changes.
Flannel next to the skin is therefore to be avoided, par­
ticularly by young, strong, and healthy persons: it
weakens the skin, and thus opens the door to all ini­
mical influences. The well known rule, to keep the head
cool and the feet warm, should not be lost sight of; a
warm covering for the head prevents the due evapora­
tion, causes congestion, &c.
Exercise must of course not be omitted : life is a per­
petual motion and change; all nature is a constant
movement into time and space. Regular exercise in the
open air promotes the due circulation of the blood, pre­
vents its congesting in individual parts, strengthens and
maintains the activity of the organs, and by assisting in
quickly assimilating the food taken into the body, aids
digestion, and stimulates the appetite. Nothing tends
more to shorten life than constant confinement in close
rooms; the circulation is checked; digestion impeded,
breathing oppressed, and hypochondriasis, piles, hysteria,
&c., are the result.
Exercise will also fit us for the due enjoyment of
those hours devoted by nature to the restoration of our
powers, mental and bodily, namely:—
Sleep. The proper hours should be devoted to rest.
Day is intended for the various occupations of life—
HINTS FOR PERSONS, ETC. 243
night for refreshing our powers and fitting them for
renewed exertions of the morrow.
“ Early to bed and early to rise,
Makes man healthy, wealthy, and wise
is an old proverb, but none the worse for being so.
The Germans say:—
“ Die Morgcnstunde hat Gold in Munde.”
Mattresses should be used to sleep upon, and the
covering should not be too warm, which is particularly
prejudicial to children and young persons. If the sleep
is to be refreshing, an early and light supper only should
be taken, in order not to overload the stomach—which,
by-the-by, should never be done—and thus cause dis­
turbed rest, anxious dreams, nightmare, &c.
H i n t s f o r P e r s o n s u n d e r g o i n g t h e W a t e r - c u r e .
A few general remarks for the guidance of those who
undergo the Water-cure may not be uninteresting.
The first point of importance is the diet, the necessity
of observing which, in health and disease, I have en­
deavoured to impress upon my readers. The great end
of the water treatment is to strengthen the various func­
tions of the body, so as to enable them to overcome the
diseased action of individual organs, and restore the
Q 2
HINTS FOR PERSONS
harmonious working of the whole organism. To accom­
plish this, and restore the lost power, a moderately
nourishing diet is essential, but simple, natural, and mo­
derate food should absolutely be adhered to. Absti­
nence from heating dishes and heating drink is a sine
qua non—a condition, without which it is vain to expect
a cure. Take a sufficiency of food, but do not overload
the stomach by indulging to the full extent the appe­
tite, which does not fail to be whetted to a high degree
by the sudorific process, bathing, walking, &c.; rather
leave off with an appetite, if the cure is to progress
favourably; for the afternoon douches and sitz-baths
would not have their due effect upon a full stomach,
and this would even exercise an unfavourable influence
upon the sweating of the next morning. Flatulent ve­
getables, such as peas, beans, &c., should be avoided ;
potatoes, farinaceous food, cheese and new-baked bread,
taken with the utmost abstemiousness.
Acid and fat aliments are particularly to be eschewed
by dyspeptic persons. Fresh and preserved fruit in
moderation is beneficial. Spices are quite unsuitable
to the cure; and eggs and butter should be taken in
limited quantities only. For drink, milk, and water as a
general rule. At all events, plenty of cold water must
be taken in the course of the treatment. As some
stomachs are unaccustomed to this, they must begin
with small quantities. In Grafenberg, those moderately
used to water drinking take ten or twelve glasses, (five
or six pints,) a-day. The greater portion of this is
244
UNDERGOING THE WATER-CURE. 245
taken in the morning between the first bath—after the
shiver consequent on this has yielded to the due re­
action—and breakfast; exercise being taken during this
time, if at all possible, out of doors, or in doors by
wood-sawing, &c.
No food should be taken until the water is quite
digested; for this reason, a pause is made in drinking
an hour or so before dinner, but is resumed during that
meal according to pleasure. The quantity of water to
be taken increases gradually with increasing strength;
and twenty or thirty glasses per diem is seldom exceeded
in Grafenberg. Gargling frequently in the morning
strengthens the organs of deglutition much, and solves
and carries off a large quantity of mucus. Indeed, this
is a good preparatory step for those quite unaccustomed
to water drinking.
Water drinking should not be overdone; an excess of
it, by its low temperature extracting too much caloric
from the body, and its specific gravity in the same case,
being apt to molest the digestive organs and prevent the
due fulfilment of their functions. As a general rule,
water should never be taken until the cold consequent
on its previous application has passed, nor in such quan­
tities at a time as to cause a shivering; if this occurs
it must be overcome by exercise. The same applies to
baths which, moreover, must never be taken on a full
stomach.
Exercise is an essential requisite in order to promote
a due circulation of the fluids. Patience and persever­
24e HINTS FOR PERSONS* ETC.
ance must be recommended, at the same time with an
injunction not to over-hurry the cure:—it is better to
do too little than too much in all cases. Freedom from
care, cheerfulness of spirits, and an avoidance of all
commotions and excitements of mind and body, are
necessary. Over-indulgence in sleep is prejudicial;
morning, moreover, is the best time for sweating and
bathing.
Persons intending to visit an establishment will do
well to prepare themselves at home as much as possible,
by drinking water, taking ablutions, &c. The most
proper time to commence is spring, when, if necessary,
it can be continued throughout the year. Being under
the hands of professional men, the appearances of fever,
crises, &c., during the progress of the cure, should
never alarm the patient, as it is a part of the cure, and
is frequently purposely brought about when the vital
power has attained sufficient strength to struggle with
the disease. The treatment is then generally modified,
but a sudden breaking off all operations might prove as
injurious as a continued powerful action on the organism.
After the cure is completed, it will be necessary, in
order to obviate the recurrence of a necessity for a
future treatment, to adhere to water diet for a length
of time, and in many cases during life.

At the age of three years I had the misfortune to fall
down a flight of stairs, and injure my right knee joint.
A medical man was called in, and he pronounced it to
be nothing but a bruise which would soon get well. To
effect this, he sent a bottle of stimulating embrocation,
with directions to well rub the joint with it night and
morning; no laying up, no rest, it did not require it,—it
was nothing but a bruise. After three weeks, it became
evident that I began to limp, as I could not walk flat on
my foot, and that it was something more than a bruise.
The doctor, on being sent for, again examined the leg,
the result of which was, another stimulating embrocation
of increased strength, with directions to rub th§ part
well with it, three times daily, and to make me march
about, or I should have a stiff knee. Having a young
mother to watch over me, my father being from home,
and our residence in the country, the doctor’s injunc­
tions were rigidly complied with, until my system became
24* CASES.
so much excited by his embrocation and good advice,
that a severe fever set in, which very nearly proved fatal
to me ; the joint inflamed rapidly and to such an inten­
sity, that I was given over, that is, no hopes of recovery
were anticipated. Extra advice was sought, consulta­
tions took place with the first medical men from Man­
chester, Liverpool, and Chester; their decision was, that
my leg must be cut off, or that I should die. They were
asked whether the operation would ensure my life:
probably it would, but if any delay ensued, death teas
inevitable. My kind parent wisely forbade the opera­
tion, and after my remaining six weeks in bed, free from
the embrocation, I gradually recovered—to the astonish­
ment of the doctor?—but with increased lameness, to
remedy which, I was supplied with crutches. The con­
sequence of this vile treatment was, that my leg con­
tracted, became stiff and fixed, forming a right angle
with the thigh. This was my unfortunate situation at
seven years of age.
About this period, there lived a middle-aged man in
Preston, Lancashire, who had been a wounded soldier,
disabled for service in consequence, and who afterwards
had cured himself by his own peculiar treatment, which
he was also pursuing in other cases, and with which he
assured he could greatly relieve me of the deformity.
It was determined that I should submit to it, and I well
remember his first application; for, having suffered so
severely while under the doctor’s hands, I became
exceedingly jealous of any interference with my leg.
CASES. 249
The good man spoke to me kindly and encouragingly,
placed me on a low stool, and examined my knee; after
this, he steeped flannel in a decoction of herbs, and,
when wrung out, placed it as hot as I could bear it,
round the limb, changing the flannel as often as it
cooled: this treatment lasted upwards of two hours, and
was continued pretty regularly for some weeks, when I
was permitted to go and return alone; this, as the
sequel will show, was imprudent, for I doubt not but
the restoration of the use of my limb was materially
protracted in consequence.
In addition to the hot fomentations, my doctor now
attached a small weight of about two pounds to my foot,
by means of a strap, and made me stand on my sound
leg, (holding up by a rope, attached to the ceiling,)
swinging the other leg with the weight, to and fro, as
well as I was able. This caused me considerable pain
at first, but a rapid improvement soon became manifest
by the kind and correct treatment; it was, however, too
much for a child, tortured as I had been, and I fancied
I was being cruelly treated: the effect of this was that
I began to absent myself, attending only occasionally.
The weight attached to the foot was gradualljrincreased,
and, as the cure progressed, my doctor resorted to
another measure in furtherance of the object in view,
by adding to the prescribed remedies, a long oval hollow
tin which he procured after his own design, and which
he placed under the joint: to this tin was attached a
broad strong band, with leathern straps and buckles; the
250 CASES.
band he buckled tight over the knee. This produced
still greater pain, which induced me to follow out my
truant tricks; nevertheless the cure progressed rapidly,
as I was made to wear the tin, day and night; it was
strapped tighter as the cure progressed. I walked with
the fore-part of my foot on the ground, the heel nearly
touching also, after nine months of this excellent, cor­
rect, and scientific treatment.
At this period we took up our residence in London,
which prevented my cure being completed, as I am
satisfied it would have been. Since that time I have
been affected with a slight shortening of the limb from
contraction at the knee joint, with nearly complete
anchylosis; but this accidental malformation never in­
convenienced me, as I could, without fatigue, walk
twenty miles daily, and perform arduous duties.
I now arrive at my present ailment, which suddenly
arose five years since, whilst attending my late poor
mother for ten days and nights, after an operation of
the breast for supposed malignant tumour, which, how­
ever, turned out to be nothing hut a harmless one, and
which would thave sloughed away, had it been left, as
the excellent and worthy surgeon who operated after­
wards admitted. It is needless to say that two of the
first medical men of the day saw her, and perfectly con­
curred as to the propriety of operating, although at the
advanced age of 72; she died in consequence, on the
tenth day.
Perhaps I got out of health from anxiety pending
CASES* 251
the result of the operation, and might have taken cold
as well, for I was suddenly deprived of the use of my
unfortunate leg, and could not take a step without
great difficulty. I was, in consequence, obliged to
keep the house for three months, using either sticks
or crutches, if I desired to move about. I sought the
advice of the heads of the faculty, and pursued their
prescriptions with rigid exactness, to little or no pur­
pose. I then resolved to take change of air, believing
the constitution to be at fault, and accordingly visited
Ramsgate in the month of October, walking with the
assistance of two sticks. In a fortnight’s time, I im­
proved so much, that I could take tolerable exercise
with one stick. The weather setting in cold and wet,
I returned home and continued medical treatment,
with, however, little or no benefit. In the following
May, I again went to Ramsgate, and met with the
same beneficial result; but my practice not permitting
a long absence, a speedy return to town became ne­
cessary. I then began to suffer in the joint occasion­
ally very much, looked pallid, and expectorated blood
on rising in the morning. This circumstance startled
me, and, apprehensive of the worst consequences, I
determined on relinquishing my practice, and residing
permanently at Ramsgate. Since that time, I have
enjoyed excellent health, but always suffered, more
or less, in my knee.
My lameness appears to arise from chronic rheu­
matism of the joint (arthrodynia). I had tried every
252 CASES.
consistent means to remove it, but without effect: at
this time, I fortunately read Captain Claridge’s book
on the Water-cure.
The late Sir Astley Cooper very candidly states in
his lectures, that some diseases of the knee-joint are
very difficult to cure, that persons had come to him
and found no relief whatever from his treatment, after
having had the advice of the heads of the profession,
without benefit—that such cases he was in the habit
of recommending to Mr. Grover, of Bath, an intelli­
gent general practitioner, who got them well. Sir
Astley Cooper also mentions in his lectures that he
sponged his body over with cold water, night and
morning, with the most marked benefit, that although
he went from the heated anatomical theatre, or lecture
room, and remained about the hospital yard, in silk
stockings and shoes, and lightly clad, he never took
cold, which he attributed to the ablutions. These
considerations, together with the remarks of many
continental medical men, as evidenced by Captain Cla-
ridge, induced me to visit Grafenberg, and submit to
the Water-cure.
After having fully stated my case to Priessnitz, and
answered his questions as to my general state of health,
I was, at 5 o’clock the next morning, awakened by the
bath servant, and wrapped up in a wet sheet, (as de­
scribed in the 4th part of this work.) I had a slight
•
shiver of about three minutes, when I began to recover
my warmth, soon after which I felt so perfectly com-
CASES. 253
fortable and composed, that I fell asleep. About six
o’clock, I was again awakened by the baddiener, who
was accompanied by Priessnitz. On emerging from
the sheet, Priessnitz examined me very attentively
from head to foot, feeling my skin, and desiring me to
take a few steps; the servant then threw a sheet drip­
ping with water over my head, and rubbed me with it
briskly for five minutes. Priessnitz again examined
my skin, and then placed a wet bandage, covered with
a dry one, on my knee. The above process was re­
peated three times daily during my stay at Grafenberg,
at five in the morning, at eleven in the forenoon, and
five o’clock in the afternoon; in addition, the whole of
my diseased limb was enveloped in a wet and dry band­
age, on retiring for the night.
Priessnitz expressed himself confident of being able
to effect a radical cure ; but, from the long standing of
the malady, at the same time stated, that two or three
years might elapse before it could be effected. This
announcement by no means disappointed me, and I
continued the treatment with rigid exactness during my
stay at Grafenberg, until I was compelled to quit in
consequence of the severity of the weather,—snow
storms, and the slippery state of the roads and walks,
preventing my taking exercise out of doors for weeks
together. I much regretted this circumstance, for I
felt confident of a favourable result, could I have re­
mained the required time. I had suffered incessantly
for five years previously, and after a short time of the
254 CASES.
treatment all pain had abated. A few days before my
departure from Grafenberg, a crisis broke out beneath
the diseased joint,—an open ulcer free from pain, which
commenced discharging, when. I experienced consider­
able strength in the limb, being then able to walk
about the house for four hours without fatigue, and
without my walking-stick, which had not been the case
for five years previously. The approach of the time
for my departure prevented my continuing the treat­
ment, in consequence of which the wound healed in
about a week, when my former weakness of the joint
returned, but without the pain.
Since my return home I have devoted all my spare
time to the completion of this treatise, in order to con­
tribute to the benefit of my fellow creatures, so that
I have been unable to continue the treatment, but shall
now forthwith recur to it in my own establishment.
It may not be out of place to add the case of Mr.
Oswald, Prussian Consul at Hamburgh, who informed
me that he had been crippled for years in one of his
legs, from rheumatism; that he had sought the best
continental advice—the Berlin doctors among the num­
ber—and at length was radically cured at Grafenberg,
after a stay there of two years and a half. On the day
I had the pleasure of seeing him, nine months had
elapsed since his return from Grafenberg.
C a s e 1 . Decline.
A rich Hamburgh merchant had been declining in
CASES. 255
health for ten years, without experiencing the slightest
benefit from the means resorted to by the faculty.
He had, in addition to this, sought relief from the
most celebrated mineral springs on the Continent, for
a considerable time, with no better success. Indeed,
the latter seemed but to aggravate his disease. At
length, tired out, as a dernier ressort he went to
Grafenberg, to try the effect of the cold-water cure,
wliich had begun to excite considerable attention in
Germany at that time. When he arrived there, he was
in such a debilitated state, that he could scarcely stand;
he had the appearance of a living skeleton, and was
affected with caries of the vertebrae, weak digestion,
excessive exhaustion, night sweats, slow fever, great
constipation, and thirst. In this state he commenced
the treatment, and, in the course of a very short time,
evinced symptoms of considerable improvement; his
strength increased as the fever diminished, and his
bowels became more regular in their required functions;
Ills appetite increased, his thirst became less, and he
was enabled to take daily exercise, which materially
assisted in his restoration. Thus he went on, increasing
in strength and health, which was quite re-established
•
at the expiration of two years. To commemorate his
gratitude to Priessnitz, he built a new ship, and chris­
tened her the name of his preserver—Priessnitz.
C a s e 2. Debility.
A married English lady, under the Water treat-
256 CASES.
ment, during my stay at Grafenberg, for general
debility, informed me that she had been constantly
complaining of illness for the last twenty years, having
suffered severely from indigestion, nausea, sickness,
and pains in the back and loins. Medicines failed in
affording her relief; she therefore had, under proper
advice, tried travelling, change of scene, &c., but with
no alleviation of symptoms, until she was induced to
submit herself to the water treatment. She commenced
forthwith; a violent critical fever set in shortly after­
wards, causing delirium, &c., which continued for a few
days, after which she began to improve rapidly. Crises
made their appearance twice after this, in the fonn of
ulcers in the legs, which relieved her considerably from
her sufferings, and tended greatly to assist in strengthen­
ing her system. She remained four months on the es­
tablishment, and said she had never been so well for the
long time specified, and that she had now done with
medicines for ever.
This lady’s husband was likewise under the water
treatment for a variety of complaints at the same time,
and had experienced great benefit. They both spoke
in the highest praise of the Water-cure.
%
C a s e 3 . Asthma.
A middle-aged English gentleman had been afflicted
for years with asthma and spasms, always under the
doctor’s care, taking the prescribed medicines, and
hot brandy and water as remedies. He suffered so
CASES. 257
severely and so frequently from an over-excited state
of the bronchial glands, without finding anything hut a
temporary relief, that upon reading Captain Claridge’s
book, he determined to pay a visit to Grafenberg, and
submit to the water treatment.
A residence of two months at Grafenberg completely
restored him to health. During the cure he repeatedly
discharged from the mouth large quantities of phlegm.
I afterwards heard regarding this case, on my return
home, from the conductor of one of the royal post mails,
whose attention was called to my sweating blanket, which
I used as a wrapper for my legs, and which led to some
conversation on the subject of the Water-cure. The
conductor spoke of many cures which had been effected
to his knowledge, and among others he also related the
above, stating that when the gentleman was on his way
to Grafenberg, the cough was so severe, the constriction
and the difficulty of breathing so great, that he feared
he would have been suffocated; and on the gentleman’s
returning the same road two months later, he was de­
lighted to find him quite well, without once coughing
during the whole journey.
The conductors on the Continent are well-informed
men, and many of them have served as officers in the
army.
C a s e 4 . Scrofula.
A Polish gentleman, resident at Gnesen, twenty-two
years of age, presenting the strumous diathesis—under
treatment during my residence at Grafenberg, for scro­
ll
258 CASES.
fula of the nose—informed me that he had been affected
generally with this disease from birth, but more particu­
larly about the neck. He had been continually under me­
dical treatment without avail. The last two years, whilst
under treatment, his eyes and nose became so seriously
diseased, that it was believed they would be totally des­
troyed ; the cartilage of his nose was rapidly ulcerating;
he was nearly blind, and suffered the most intense
agony. The various external and internal applications
seemed but to aggravate the affection. Matters went on
thus, until he became a perfectly disgusting object, both
to himself and others, the discharging matter covering
his face, and emitting a most offensive odour. He was
sent to Grafenberg in a very exhausted state, and had
been there seven months under the Water-cure, when I
first saw him. The ulcers, which arc always so difficult
to heal in this complaint, were perfectly well. He ap­
peared in good health, and felt quite well and happy.
There, however, remained some little disfigurement of
the nose, in consequence of the destruction of some por­
tion of the cartilage.
C a s e 5 . Cancer of the Stomach.
The heading of this case may perhaps be considered
incorrect, as the disease seldom succumbs to medical
treatment. This, however, I shall not dispute, as the
Water-cure placed it beyond my power to examine the
body after death, so that I could not exhibit the exact
CASES* 259
pathological condition of that viscus; nevertheless, I
believe it to be right, from the same opinion having been
given by other medical men.
An Austrian gentleman, of about thirty years of age,
came to Grafenberg, during my stay there, to be cured
of general debility, great exhaustion and vomiting after
food, which had completely emaciated him. He had
been getting in this deplorable state many months, and
was at length told that he was past recovery. Having
nothing to expect from the aid of medicine, he deter­
mined to give the Water treatment a trial. For the last six
months previous to his arrival at Grafenberg, he had al­
ways endured much pain in the stomach, chiefly occa­
sioned by taking food, and this was continued more or less
until he vomited, when his acute sufferings somewhat
abated. He sought relief in abstemiousness, subsisting
on diet of the lightest kind, notwithstanding which, the
vomiting continued, and he began himself to despair.
Mild treatment was adopted at Grafenberg; vomiting
and the usual pains were not in the least alleviated;
indeed, the vomiting rather increased, and frequently
occurred whilst undergoing the requisite operations.
Soon, however, more favourable symptoms were evinced.
In six months, vomiting ceased altogether, with much
less pain; an occasional douche tended to restore his lost
strength ; his pain decreased daily, and health increased
in the same ratio. His appetite was good, and mind
cheerful. I left him in the establishment, in a fair way
of a radical cure.
260
C a s e 6 . Syphilis.
The subject of this case, a Bohemian gentleman, resi­
dent in Vienna, appeared to have been affected with two
distinct diseases—piles and syphilis of six years’ stand­
ing. He had been under the care of the most skilful
medical men, who salivated him to such an extent, and
so reduced him by their medicines, that he could not
walk fifty yards without the greatest exertion and fa­
tigue. In this state he arrived at Grafenberg, encased
in flannel and thick wrappers, in order to prevent his
catching cold, under the advice of his physicians. He
was suffering with great thirst, nausea, fever, continued
pain at the back of the head, pains in the limbs, erup­
tions, costiveness, and excessive debility.
Under the Water treatment he improved daily, and to
such an extent, that in two months he could walk six
miles with comparative ease; and in December last, in
severe frosty weather, he walked about with one coat
on, namely, a pilot of light texture. His flannel wrap­
pers and superfluous clothing had been discarded soon
after reaching Grafenberg. At the period of my de­
parture he had been four months at Grafenberg. The
piles yielded to a regular action of the bowels, although
he had been troubled with them for some years.
It is a remarkable fact that after the wet sheet baths,
which formed part of the treatment of this case, the
water wrung from the sheets always had a milky con­
sistency and a fetid smell.
261
C a s e 7 . Rheumatism.
A Russian officer, thirty-five years of age, for a long
time affected with chronic rheumatism of the head and
feet, sought relief at Grafenbcrg. He suffered mostly
at night from the rheumatic pains. After submitting
to the treatment for ten weeks, (sitz-baths of long
duration forming one of the principal applications,)
he was one day alarmed at finding a considerable flow
of blood—to the .amount of about a pint, which he
ascertained by measuring the blood coagulated in the
bath—to have taken place from the rectum whilst in
the sitz-bath. He soon ascertained that this was a cri­
tical appearance. The treatment was slightly altered,
and after the lapse of a few days a similar flow of blood
occurred, and recurred at short intervals a third and
fourth time, when marked relief followed these san­
guineous evacuations. This gentleman was accustomed
to indulge his appetite to the fullest extent, which I
believe retarded his cure; he is, nevertheless, in a fair
way of recovery.
C a s e 8 . Liver Disease.
An Austrian professional gentleman—compelled to
relinquish his avocations in consequence of the severity
of his disease—came to seek health on the far-famed
mountain.
His medical attendants had told him that he was
suffering under a multiplicity of organic affections,
262 CASES.
namely, the liver, spleen, &c., and that there was no
hope of recovery—that mitigation of pain was all he
might expect. The latter intelligence he received with
agreeable sensation, since his case was deemed hopeless.
He, however, decided on undergoing the Water treat­
ment at Grafenberg, although this was attended with
considerable inconvenience to him. On his arrival at
Grafenberg, he was pale, with a dropsical tendency,
much jaundiced, and suffering greatly from gastric irri­
tation. When I quitted Grafenberg, he had been under
treatment seventeen weeks, was free from pain, jaun­
diced colour giving place to a more healthy hue, appe­
tite good, and on the whole progressing favourably
towards a restoration to health.
C a s e 9 . Psoriasis Diffusa.
This case was one of the most inveterate I have ever
witnessed. The patient, an English gentleman, aged
sixty years, from Boulogne, had been afflicted with this
unpleasant disease incessantly, for twenty-six years. He
informed me that he had eagerly sought both English
and foreign medical advice, but to little or no avail, and
that his past sufferings had been so great that he should
have been almost tempted to commit suicide, were it
not for the consideration of his young family, which
alone deterred him, for he could procure no relief for
his sufferings, and was completely wretched. His
medical advisers had pronounced him to have a compli­
cation of disorders—besides the skin affection—namely,
CASES. 26S
of the liver, spleen, and stomach. He, therefore, on
reading Captain Claridge’s book, determined to proceed
to Grafenberg, in spite of the expostulations of his
medical and other friends.
I saw him soon after his arrival, looking very ill and
very excitable, covered with a scaly eruption of irregular
form over parts of the body, and lower extremities
especially, of a brownish red colour, with, in some parts,
desquamation, beneath which the skin appeared of a
deep red: the cuticle in other parts appeared natural.
At the commencement of the Water treatment, he was
placed in wet sheets two or three times daily, and the
relief afforded was so soothing and agreeable, that he
actually disliked getting out of them when the time
arrived; he looked forward to the periods of being
wrapped up in them again with pleasure.
There was a singular circumstance connected with
tliis case: the patient had been affected with red gra­
vel for eighteen years, which occasionally was very
painful and troublesome to him : in six weeks under
the Water-cure he was perfectly relieved of tliis ail­
ment and has had no relapse. The skin disease is
also progressing towards a cure, and although Priessnitz
told him it would take two years to cure him, he never­
theless expresses his happiness and joy at the intel­
ligence, and at the rapid improvement in his general
health. He says, nothing should induce him to leave
the place, the relief afforded being so exquisitely great.
This gentleman has arranged for his family to join him
V
264 c a s e s .
at Grafenberg, his stay in this place being likely to be
protracted.
*
C a s e 10. Skin Disease.
An English gentleman-farmer came to Grafenberg,
during my residence there, to undergo the Water treat­
ment for an eruption of the skin, covering nearly the
whole body, of twenty years’ standing. The eruption
resembled very much the appearance of psoriasis guttata,
which I have no doubt it was, considering the symp­
toms in connexion therewith. /
He took apartments in Freiwaldau, and sent for
Priessnitz, who examined him, and gave directions how
to proceed. In answer to the question, as to the pro­
bable time required to effect a cure, Priessnitz stated
two years to be necessary. This alarmed the farmer, as
he could not devote so much time to the treatment.
Nevertheless, as the process which had been recom­
mended by Priessnitz for a commencement was simple,
namely, perspirations in wet sheets, followed by ablu­
tions, the fanner thought he might as well try its effects.
He pursued it without deviation for eight weeks, at the
same time strictly observing a most rigid diet—he abso­
lutely took nothing but bread and water, three times
daily—at the expiration of which time he declared him­
self quite cured. He left Grafenberg at the same
*
time I did, looking as hale and hearty as any man need
look.
Previous to his undergoing the Water treatment, he
CASES. 265
had not perspired for years, whilst in the course of it,
perspiration was speedily promoted by water drinking
and the wet sheets. From the short time devoted to
the treatment, I apprehend that this gentleman will be
liable to a recurrence of his complaint.
C a s e 1 1 . Purpura Simplex.
The subject of this case is an Hanoverian officer,
about fifty years of age. He had an eruption of thirty
years’ standing in the breast, arms, legs, and back of the
neck—having the appearance of petechiae—in conse­
quence of the retrocession of measles, with which he
was affected at that period. He suffered from pains in
the limbs, great thirst, loss of appetite, nervous twitch-
ings, and diarrhoea which produced from ten to twelve
motions daily for the last six years. Medicine afforded
him no assistance, consequently he placed himself under
the Water treatment, soon after which, fever set in for a
fortnight, causing loss of sleep and delirium. Two
crises made their appearance then, and continued nine
weeks, during five of which the patient was compelled
to keep his bed: this was succeeded by returning
strength and good appetite. * .1
The diarrhoea ceased entirely on the fifth day of the
treatment, the nervous twitchings and pains altogether
ceased on the appearance of the crises.
He left after a stay of five months and a half, looking
fresh and vigorous, and feeling perfectly well and com­
fortable.
266
C a s e 12. Gravel,
A Russian officer had suffered severely from acute
nephritic paroxysms for some years, without receiving
much benefit from his medical advisers, so that he deter­
mined on undergoing the Water treatment. When he
arrived at Grafenberg, the urgency and difficulty to pass
water was so great, that he voided pure blood, whenever
he made the attempt. The pain and irritation conse­
quent thereon, together with the loss of blood, &c.,
blanched his skin, and gave him such a haggard look,
that he was dubbed, “ the Ghost,” by some of his jocose
and more happy fellow patients, on his arrival at the
establishment. After submitting to the treatment for
three weeks, he voided considerable quantities of red
gravel, the blood ceased to pass, and the symptoms of
disease greatly diminished; in nine months he was per­
fectly recovered.
Case 13. Stricture,
The subject of this affection was an Hungarian advo­
cate, about thirty-five years of age, who for two years had
been unable to pass his water in a full stream. He had
been under surgical treatment, and mostseverelypunished
by the frequent introduction of bougies and catheters,
but with very slight symptoms of improvement. The
frequent desire to discharge the contents of the bladder
became so urgent, and the suffering so great, that he
was strongly induced to visit Grafenberg, for the pur-
CASES. 267
pose of undergoing the Water treatment, though without
the slightest hope that he should find relief.
In this state he arrived at Grafenberg, having a hard
callous thickening of the lining membrane, forming a
firm stricture, situate about three quarters of an inch
from the membraneous portion of the urethra. For the
first week he experienced great difficulty in voiding his
water: a high state of fever had set in, the patient
having caught the small pox on his journey, and being
covered from head to foot with the eruption on the third
day. To the wonder of all, he was well and out on the
tenth day. He now began to pass his water with greater
facility, in a larger stream, and with less pain; and con­
tinued rapidly improving for the next six months, after
which period the false membrane sloughed away in
three distinct portions at three several times, when he
passed his water in a full stream without pain, and has
so continued to do up to the tenth month of the treat­
ment. He remained at Grafenberg on my departure
from thence.
Ca s e 14. Hypochondriasis,
A Prussian gentleman, labouring under deranged
digestion, and a morbid state of feelings and ideas con­
sequent thereon, which he had endured for years, tra­
velling from physician to physician, from country to
country, without being benefited, was at length induced
to accompany a friend who intended setting out for the
far-famed temple of health with a view of remedying
268 CASES.
an obstinate constipation. The hypochondriac remained
under treatment twelve months, and his gradual im­
provement was visible to every one. When I saw him,
after he had been there about ten months, he had
assumed a cheerful appearance, quick and active gait,
and indeed was one of the most lively persons in the
place, whilst on his arrival he was the very picture of
melancholy.
His friend had departed after a sojourn of three
months, perfectly cured. •
C a s e 15. Diseased Leg.
A Prussian officer received a severe contusion of the
right leg, from a large piece of timber accidentally fall­
ing upon it. He placed himself under surgical treat­
ment, and after continuing it for some time, instead of
being relieved, was startled by the announcement that
mortification was supervening, and that immediate
amputation had become necessary. The patient firmly
refused to submit to the operation, but determined on
making the best of his way to Grafenberg, where he
spent three years, and was rewarded with a thorough
restoration of his limb to health and life: he was
actually one of the best dancers in the place.
C ase 16. Hysteria.
The subject of this case was an Austrian lady, about
fifty years of age, rather corpulently inclined. She had
been severely and frequently affected with hysterical
CASKS. 2 6 9
attacks, the consequence of impaired digestion, which
brought her to a state bordering on hypochondriasis.
For the last few months previous to submitting to the
Water-cure, she had been particularly subject to violent
and frequent fits. These continued for the first fort­
night or three weeks of the Water treatment, after which
she gradually recovered, and was quite restored to health
in three months. She was highly grateful for the
change in her health—indeed her expressions of delight
and thanks to her benefactor knew no bounds.
C a s e 17. Heart Disease.
The patient was a young Russian gentleman, con­
nected with one of the richest merchants in Odessa.
Excesses and excitements tending to affect the action of
the heart materially, had caused an enlargement of this
organ. He experienced great exhaustion, difficulty of
breathing, and other sufferings, from which he had in
vain endeavoured to be relieved by most rigid medical
treatment. He had been reduced almost to a skeleton,
and his frame was perfectly attenuated.
In this state he sought relief from the Water-cure,
and found it to his inexpressible delight, after four
months* treatment, which enabled him to ascend and
descend the mountains with as little fatigue as more
robust patients.
C a s e 18. Insanity.
This gentleman, a Prussian, had been affected with
270 CASES.
mania for several years, marked by violent passions and
false conceptions, frequently mistaking his best friends
for his foes, and becoming exceedingly violent, without
any assignable cause; so much so, indeed, as often to
strike them, when not duly restrained or prevented.
The chief causes of his malady, I believe, were, an
over-imaginative mind, and habits of intoxication. He
had been placed under confinement at times; but the
attacks would recur periodically.
A kind friend undertook to watch his progress under
the Water treatment, which seemed, indeed, to have
effected wonders for the invalid. The paroxysms were
considerably abated after some months’ cautious treat­
ment, although a great deal of excitability remained
when I left Grafenberg. I consider him in a fair way
of perfect recovery.
#
C a s e 1 9 . Constipation.
A Prussian general officer, accustomed to high living,
had been afflicted for twelve years with costiveness,
which his medical advisers only succeeded in relieving
temporarily. The evil grew upon him, and his mind
was becoming easily excited; trivial causes tended to
annoy him, and he began to be displeased with himself
and others. He sought and found perfect relief by a
stay of some months at Grafenberg.
C a s e 2 0 . Diseased Elbow.
A young Polish nobleman, whilst racing, was thrown
CASES. 271
from his horse, which had taken fright, and came in
contact with the ground upon his elbow. Intense
inflammation and pain ensued; his numerous medical
attendants all concurred in the opinion that amputation
was the only chance of saving his life, which they con­
sidered was endangered by the accident.
He declined the operation, but desired them to use
their best means, without removing the limb. They
accordingly continued to treat him for nine months; in
the mean time several pieces of bone exfoliated from
the elbow-joint.
At this period he determined on being conveyed to
Griifenberg, with the arm swollen to three times its
natural size, the agony being intense. Two months of
the treatment relieved him from all pain, and the arm
was reduced to its normal size. He is also able to
make a slight use of the hand of the diseased arm.
This gentleman remained at Griifenberg at the time of
my departure. Priessnitz says that he will recover the
proper use of the limb, but that it will require a year
or two to accomplish this.
C a s e 2 1 . Nervous Affection.
I witnessed another remarkable case in the person of
a Prussian lady of some distinction. She told me that
she had been seriously indisposed, and suffered a variety
of pains, particularly about the region of the heart, for
more than twelve montlis previous to her sojourn at
Griifenberg, brought on through the death ofan attached
272 CASES.
friend. Her symptoms had been such that her medical
attendants were induced to consider her case as one of
organic disease of the heart, in consequence of her always
feeling great pain in that organ. I am inclined to con­
sider it a disease of the mind, caused by the severe shock
she received. She said that at times the most gloomy
thoughts entered her mind, and it was only by her na­
turally strong intellect she was enabled to overcome
them ; at repeated and frequent intervals, however,
desponding ideas totally unnerved her. She had placed
herself under medical treatment, but finding no perma­
nent relief, resolved upon submitting to the Water-cure.
During the first four months of her residence at Grafen-
berg she scarcely perceived any difference in her health,
but after the lapse of about that period, two crises made
their appearance, one on the left shoulder, the other on
the right leg, both of which discharged profusely.
From that time she experienced considerable relief, and
entertained sanguine hopes of recovery. She went on
improving almost daily, and now, about six months
since her commencement of the water campaign, she
appears quite well, eats well, sleeps well, takes long
walks, and says she feels quite happy and cheerful.
C a s e 22. Bleeding Piles.
A Polish gentleman had been affected with hemorr­
hoids, and experienced much suffering from frequent
attacks of heat, inflammation, and pain of the mucous
membrane of the lower bowels for five years. He had
CASES. 273
lost flesh, and become extremely debilitated in conse­
quence : he was very costive, and always dreaded a
motion, on account of the acute, cutting pain he endured
at the time.
Laxative medicines, leeches, washes, fomentations,
injections, &c., had been resorted to from time to
time, but with only a temporary relief j distension and
tumefaction of the parts always seemed to succeed any
operations, so that the patient suffered more than
before from increased irritation and straining at the
time of going to stool. Purgatives of a gentle kind
were frequently administered, yet these seemed but to
torment him the more.
In this wretched state he eagerly came in search of
Priessnitz, although he suffered most acutely in the at­
tempt, and was compelled to rest nightly on the road.
After reaching his destination, and submitting to
Priessnitz’s treatment for three weeks, he was delighted
to find great regularity in the action of the bowels, with
little or no pain. He went on improving rapidly, as­
suming a healthy and robust appearance, and expressed
himself in extatic terms as to the beneficial effects of
the treatment.
C a s e 23. Gout.
An English gentleman, a bon vivant, fifty years of
age, of sanguine temperament, and inclined to corpu­
lency, had been subject to gouty attacks for the last
fifteen years. He suffered excruciating pains in both
s
274 CASES.
hands and wrists, and the left foot, to such a degree,
that he was compelled to keep the house for many
months at a time. This induced him, after trying in
vain to obtain ease, to visit Grafenberg for the purpose
of undergoing the Water-cure. At this period the
parts became particularly swollen, painful, knotty, and
somewhat disfigured in appearance. He was immediately
subjected to the treatment, and, to his utter astonish­
ment, was quite freed from all pain in one week, without
any return of it at all, although he remained <Jn the es­
tablishment for twelve months, when he was perfectly
restored.
In his sweating blankets, sheets, and sitz-baths, after
each time of using them, for the first six months, there
were usually concretions of a chalky kind; afterwards
this disappeared altogether, and the patient enjoyed ex­
cellent health. He told me he had been a great wine
drinker, having taken one or two bottles daily for many
years, and that he never meant to touch it again, having
lost all taste for it.
C a s e 24. Fistula.
The subject of this case was an Hungarian nobleman
of high rank, who had suffered some years with a dis­
charge from a fistulous opening in the rectum, and had
become very thin and weak in consequence.
He had undergone an operation, but without any
relief, neither had he experienced any benefit from the
medical treatment employed. He began at length to
CASES. 275
despair of his life, when he was persuaded to submit to
the Water-cure, the result of which was, after a treat­
ment of three years, that he quitted the establishment
perfectly cured, having regained his lost health and
strength.
In closing these cases, I regret that the limits appor­
tioned for this work necessarily compel me to leave
out many more of an equally interesting character.
