INTRODUCTION
THE Yearbook of American Churches is a reference work presenting
comprehensive information mainly about organized religion in the
United States. A directory of certain of the Canadian churches is, however,
included. The Yearbook for 1941 consists chiefly of directories, nine of
which list a large number of officials of church agencies and of organizations
in which churches have an interest. A new feature of this edition is the
inclusion of a complete directory of cooperative field organizations, made
available by The Inter-Council Field Department.
The Annals of Organized Religion were prepared by five authors who
summarized major events of 1939 and 1940. These are very brief histories.
For interpretation the authors are personally responsible.
The section on statistics presents the *
‘latest information** available, par­
ticularly the figures for church membership. A compilation of the recent
data for all the known religious bodies in the United States has been made
by the Editor. This includes membership officially reported by the statis­
tician, or as made available by the Census of Religious Bodies, 1936. This
Census was incomplete for certain bodies, but regarded as very satisfactory
by others. Many bodies which do not make annual tabulations of church
membership have specifically instructed us to use the 1936 figures, which
were made public in 1940, and are “the latest information” available. For
explanatory notes about the statistics, see the section below.
The Editor of the Yearbook simply collects and presents, often in brief
form, data supplied by others. He does not engage in original research.
Therefore what is here presented is sent in by cooperative individuals from
official sources, or, in a few instances, from published yearbooks or the
publications of the Bureau of the Census.
The Yearbook is “edited under the auspices of the Federal Council of
the Churches of Christ in America,” but the content is inclusive and becomes
a reference work touching upon all the interests of organized religion in
the nation.
This Yearbook became a useful work for the years 1933 to 1939 through
four biennial editions, largely through the devotion of the late Dr. H. C.
Weber, of the General Council of the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A.
The present Editor knows at first hand of the valuable contributions made by
Dr. ^Weber, usually at great personal sacrifice. The Editor is also aware
of his personal debt to the one who has preceded him. He also acknowledges
valuable assistance from the staff of the Department of Research and Edu­
cation of the Federal Council.

The following table indicates when Easter and other important festival days
occur during a period of nine years. It also indicates the number of Sundays during
Epiphany and after Pentecost for each year of the period. Easter may come as
early as March 22nd or as late as April 25th, thus bringing a wide variation in
the number of Sundays included in certain of the Christian seasons.

BAPTIST BODIES

The early historic local independency of Baptist churches in America tended to impede the

formed to permit Baptists to express themselves in terms of missionary activities. In 1845
the state conventions in the South withdrew to organize the Southern Baptist Convention. In
1907 the Northern Baptist Convention was organized, a delegated bodv, under whose direc­
tion the many agencies of the Baptists in the North and West now operate.

METHODIST BODIES
THE METHODIST CHURCH
In April» 1939, the Uniting Conference forming The Methodist Church was held by represen­
tatives of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and the
Methodist Protestant Church. Since that time unification or boards and agencies has been
in process. The Methodist Church in the United States originated with the efforts of John
and Charles Wesley, leaders of the revival movement in England, who preached in Georgia,
1736-7. In 1771 Francis Asbury, who was later to become the first Bishop, landed in Phila­
delphia. The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, dates from 1846, the separation from the
Methodist Episcopal Church having taken place over the slavery issue. The Methodist Pro­
testant Church dated from 1830, and was organized over the issue of lay representation;
when formed it had no bishops or presiding elders.

III. STATISTICS
Sources of Statistical Data
The statistical section includes a compilation of ‘‘the latest information” about
church membership in the country, made by the Editor for this volume; the latest
published figures on contributions compiled by the United Stewardship Council
for many of the larger bodies; and a summary of tabulations made for 1931 to
1940 inclusive by various compilers.
The compilation for all bodies made for this book was assembled in the follow­
ing manner. A blank was mailed November 15, 1940, to the chief statistical officer
of all of the bodies that reported to the Census of Religious Bodies, 1936. This
form asked for data officially reported on the number of local churches, on inclu­
sive church membership, and on membership 13 years of age and over. A second
request to those not replying was mailed December 15, 1940, and a third on
January 2, 1941. By this method membership officially reported was secured for
most churches. Many officers of bodies that do not make annual tabulations of
their memberships simply replied by asking us to ‘‘use 1936.” The 1936 figures
were tabulated and made public by the Bureau of the Census in 1940, and thus
become for many churches the latest publicly reported data about their members.
A very small proportion of the smaller bodies did not reply to a third request, and
the 1936 census data, published in 1940, are given below for these bodies also.
It is possible that in so doing an incomplete report is made for certain of these
bodies, but we have at least listed “the latest information” publicly reported.
The 1936 Census of Religious Bodies is regarded as complete and satisfactory
by certain denominations, even groups of denominations. By others it is regarded
as very incomplete. For a discussion of this census, see the special note on the
subject in this section. It will be noted that the table below gives the latest fiscal
year for which information is available.
Many denominations do not have records for the proportion of membership 13
years of age and over. For those not reporting on this item, we have applied the
percentage for this age group reported by the Census of Religious Bodies, and have
in each case indicated that this is an estimate.

POPULATION AND CHURCH MEMBERSHIP
The total population of the United States on April 1, 1940, was 131,669,275,
according to the final count based on the returns of the 16th Decennial Census,
announced December 1940. In comparison with the 1930 population of 122,775,-
046, this figure represents an increase of 8,894,229. This change constitutes an
increase of 7.2 per cent between 1930 and 1940. The rate of increase in the
decade 1930-1940 is less than one-half that shown in any previous decade since
the first census in 1790.
During the decade 1930-1940, for the first time in the history of the Nation,
the number of emigrants was greater than the number of immigrants. Between
April I, 1930 and April 1, 1940, the number of persons who left the United States
for foreign lands exceeded by 46,518 the number who entered. (See Census
Release December 4, 1940, Series P-2). Thus during the past decade, all of the
increase in population took place because of the excess of births over deaths.
Tabulations of statistics of church membership are given above for the ten years
1931-1940 inclusive. During that time inclusive church membership officially
reported increased 4,703,743 or 7.86 per cent. Population growth during approxi­
mately the same period was, as noted above, 7.2 per cent for the decade.

Total expenditures of, or contributions to, the religious bodies of the United
States are not reported annually, and are not known for recent years at all. The
only figures generally regarded as complete are for the year 1926, as reported by
the Census of Religious Bodies for that year. At the Census of 1926, total expen­
ditures of 232,154 local churches of 213 religious bodies amounted to $817,214,-
528. Dr. C. Luther Fry in his interpretation of the 1926 Census, published in his
book, The U. S. Looks At Its Churches, found these expenditures to be the
equivalent of about 1 per cent of the estimated total income of all the people. In
other words, during that year the churches received about one cent out of every
dollar received by the people of the nation.
The 1936 Census of Religious Bodies, (see note in this chapter) was incom­
plete. It recorded total expenditures of $518,953,571 for 199,302 local churches
In 256 religious bodies. According to the official reports made to the Christian
Herald for 1936 there were 245,422 local churches in 222 religious bodies. Thus
roughly one-fifth of the local churches did not furnish the information. But possibly
those not reporting were mainly the smaller churches, with less than average
budgets. Therefore it is exceedingly difficult to make a reliable estimate of total
expenditures of the churches, either for 1936, or 1940, the latest year under
review in this Yearbook.
In the 1939 Yearbook of American Churches, H. C. Weber, the editor, stated
that the total contribution to all religious bodies “probably approximated $550,-
000,000.“ In 1940, the total amount was probably about $575,000,000 making
an allowance for increase in the national income during the past two years. It may
have been $600,000,000 in 1940. If so, it was slightly less than one per cent of
the total national income as estimated by the Department of Commerce for that
year.
STATISTICS 1S9
THE 1936 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES
(Adapted from Information Service, New York, for Nov. 2, 1940)
The decennial Censuses of Religious Bodies, made in 1906, 1916, 1926, have
always been regarded as of the greatest importance because the census figures
have been the only statistics about organized religion based completely upon a
tabulation of reports from local congregations. All other compilations that have
been made at various intervals for the Christian Herald, and, for example, the
one for Information Service of the Federal Council of January 14, 1939, by Dr.
Herman C. Weber, have been summaries of the totals furnished by the official
statisticians of the denominations. Many denominations make periodic reports of
membership and finance based upon tabulations of reports from local churches,
but others do not. Hence the reliance of all interested in statistics of organized
religion upon the data of the Bureau of the Census.
On August 1, 1940, the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce,
Washington, issued a “United States Summary” of the Census of Religious
Bodies: 1936, seven pages, No. 204. It stated that all figures for 1936 were “pre­
liminary and subject to correction.” The returns received for 1936 were for 256
religious bodies with 199,302 local churches and 55,807,366 members, as com­
pared with 213 religious bodies having 232,154 local churches and 54,576,346
members in 1926. “Each church was requested to report the number of members
according to the definition of membership in that church or organization.” Of
the 213 denominations reporting in 1926, nine were not shown for 1936. Of
these, some were merged with other bodies, and the remainder were no longer
in existence. Fifty-seven denominations, relatively small bodies, were reported for
the first time in 1936; these were not all new, however; certain of them came into
being by division from a previously reported body.
When interested persons examined this release, the chief attention was na­
turally given to the decrease in the number of local churches reporting, 199,302
in 1936, compared with 232,154 in 1926, as noted above. This decline in the
total number was reported in spite of notable increases in the number of local
churches for certain bodies; for example the Assemblies of God, General Council,
reported 2,611 churches in 1936 as compared with only 671 in 1926.
Further cursory examination revealed, however, that the main difference in
the number of churches reporting was to be found in the totals for three religious
bodies as follows:
Number of Local Churches Reporting
1926 Census 1936 Census
Southern Baptist Convention................... 23,374 13,815
Methodist Episcopal.............................. 26,130 18,349
Methodist Episcopal, South.................... 18,096 11,454
Total ................................................ 67,600 43,618
(The reports of other denominations also showed decreases but not to the number
of the three above.)
These three denominations reported in 1936 to The Christian Herald tabula­
tions of reports received from their local churches, as noted in the 1937 Year­
book of American Churches, as follows:
Number of Local Churches Reporting to Official Statistician
1936
Southern Baptist Convention ..................................... 24,537
Methodist Episcopal ................................................ 24,485
Methodist Episcopal, South........................................ 16,245
Total .............................................................. 65,267
140 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
Thus it will be seen that thousands of local churches not reporting to the
Bureau of the Census for 1936 actually existed. Why, then, the discrepancy,
which marks the 1936 Census as “incomplete,** when compared with the rela­
tively satisfactory result secured in 1926? Study of the question reveals a number
of factors.
The 1936 Census of Religious Bodies can perhaps only be described as “ill-
fated** from beginning to end. The Censuses of Religious Bodies for 1906, 1916,
1926 and 1936 were taken under authority of laws passed in 1906 and 1929.
But Congress refused to vote the necessary funds for the Census of 1936. Then
a group of religious leaders from many denominations requested President Roose­
velt to allocate discretionary relief funds in order to make the religious census
possible 10 years after the one of 1926. The President complied with the request.
However, less money was available in 1936 than in 1926. Exclusive of amounts
for printing, $182,019 was spent to gather data in 1936. This compares with
$283,188 spent for the same purpose in 1926. Census officials explain that they
requested more funds, but were unable to secure them. They also state that in
1926 a greater variety of forms was printed using such terms as “conference**
or “association** and that by simplifying forms economies were made in printing
for 1936. In the latter year, 600,000 schedules were printed, compared with
950,000 in 1926. Each church not replying to a first request received a second
schedule, and in the case of many denominations third and fourth requests were
mailed. In addition, census officials explain that they sent “many hundreds** of
telegrams.
Is the explanation, then, to be found mainly in inadequate records, or unfamili­
arity with figures, or “just plain lethargy** of the ministers or clerks of numerous
local churches? Certainly, these factors were also present in 1926, and a very
satisfactory result was secured then.
The main reason seems plainly to be that many ministers of certain denomina­
tions were not in as cooperative a mood in 1936 as in 1926, and that this attitude
of non-cooperation extended so far that they would not even heed the earnest
appeals of their own national officials to fill out schedules so as to assure a
complete report for their own denominations.
Much of the non-cooperation seems to have been occasioned by the adoption
by the Bureau of the Census some years prior to 1936 of a uniform procedure of
citing its legal authority on all schedules sent out. The Bureau takes about 100
censuses. In the early years of the depression, business houses often asked for
citation of authority before filling in blanks received. The Bureau then began
citing authority on all its forms. It thus published on the 1936 schedule for the
Census of Religious Bodies in small type at the bottom of page 2 its “authority
for collection of information” in the following words: “The information to be
used as a basis of religious statistics is collected by the Census Bureau under
authority of Acts of Congress approved June 7, 1906, and June 18, 1929. These
Acts make it the duty of every person in charge of any religious body to answer
ail questions on the printed schedule, applicable to the religious body, church, or
organization; and upon refusal or neglect to comply, such person is subject to a
fine not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment not exceeding 60 days, or both;
and if any such person wilfully gives false answers, he is subject to a fine not
exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.**
The Bureau also published in large type at the top of page 1 of its schedule the
following notice: “YOUR CENSUS REPORTS ARE CONFIDENTIAL.— Acts of
Congress make it unlawful to disclose any facts, including names or identity, from
your census reports. These laws are strictly enforced. Only sworn census employes
can see your statements. Data collected are used solely for preparing statistical
information. Your Census Reports Cannot be Used for Purposes of Taxation, Regu-
S T A T IS T IC S 141
lation, or Investigation/* The same notice was printed in red type on the letter­
heads used by the Census Bureau in communications with ministers and clerks.
It appears that certain ministers, noting the penalties for refusing to comply,
reacted by saying, in effect, “All right we*II defy the government and challenge
it to put us into jail.*’ Addresses were made by churchmen, and articles were
written in the church press, urging non-cooperation, on the thesis that an attempt
to gather statistics was an unwarranted interference by the state in the life of
the church. The exact number of these addresses and articles is not known, but
numerous clippings and photostatic copies of dippings have been examined in
the course of this study.
Rumors were circulated among ministers and by ministers that the 1936 Census
of Religious Bodies was “just a New Deal proposition,” that this was an attempt
by the New Deal to “ invade** the church. The circulation of such rumors could,
of course, only reflect on the intelligence of those who spread them, since the
A ct authorizing the first religious census was signed by Theodore Roosevelt on
June 7, 1906, and a second Act relating to the Census was signed by Herbert
Hoover on June 18, 1929.

INTERFAITH DEVELOPMENTS
By Robert A. A shworth
The National Conference of Christians and Jews
The last two years have been marked by a very definite increase of sym­
pathetic interest on the part of all of the three major religious groups in
America in the fortunes and in the activities of the other two. More in­
stances of cooperation, also, may be cited than ever before.
Interfaith activity roughly falls into three classifications: (1) National
activities and pronouncements sponsored by the National Conference of
Christians and Jews, an association of individuals which is the largest
interfaith organization in the country; (2) Interfaith action taken by
Protestant, Catholic and Jewish groups separately; (3) Cooperative proj­
ects undertaken by agencies of the three faiths together, nationally and
locally.
I. T he National Conference of Christians and J ews
During the two years under review the National Conference of Chris­
tians and Jews intensified its work in all departments. By the end of 1940
the Conference had expanded its activities to include nine regional offices
with paid directors, located in New York, Washington, Chicago, Des
Moines, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Fran­
cisco. These offices undertook a widespread program in each area consist­
ing of the organization of community interfaith “round tables,” educational
work in schools, colleges, churches, civic, labor, business and farm organi­
zations, and women’s and youth groups.
During the same period, Religious News Service, the only national
interfaith news agency in the country, which is operated by the Conference
in the interests of the religious forces of the nation, expanded its services
to include the radio, and began production of a weekly news program
which is now used over leading stations, sponsored by local interfaith and
church groups.
Williamstown Institute of Human Relations
During the Summer of 1939 the third biennial Williamstown Institute
of Human Relations was held at Williams College in Massachusetts
under the auspices of the National Conference and attracted nationwide
attention.
The Institute brought together the largest company of Protestants,
142
INTERFAITH DEVELOPMENTS 143
Catholics and Jews ever to assemble in the history of the world to discuss
their mutual relations. Its theme was “Citizenship and Religion: a Con­
sideration of American Policy with regard to the Relations of Church and
Synagogue to the State.” Daily forums were held on the following subjects:
Religion and Education, Philosophies and Practices; Community Experi­
ments in Week-Day Religious Education; The Church and Economic
Reform; Methods of Translating Moral Teaching into Legislation; The
Church and W orld Peace.
Among the topics of the evening sessions were: “Church and State:
The Relation of Voluntary and Government Social W elfare W ork” ; “The
Church and Political and Economic Systems (Fascism, Communism,
Nazism and Democracy)” ; “The Church and Civil Liberties” ; “Cultural
Diversity and National Unity.”
Brotherhood Week
The sixth and seventh annual observances of Brotherhood Week under
the auspices of the Conference were held in 1939 and 1940. Brotherhood
Week is observed during the week of Washington’s Birthday. It is pro­
jected with a view to cooperation on the part of Protestants, Catholics
and Jews and its general theme during the seven years since it was initiated
lias been “Make America Safe For Differences.” Each year the President
of the United States has given it his formal endorsement. The special
theme in 1939 was “Democracy and Freedom,” and in 1940, “The Pres­
ent Crisis in Human Relations.” Participation on the part of religious.and
community groups has widened from year to year until, in 1940, it reached
approximately 2,000 communities.
National Pronouncements
A number of significant pronouncements were issued under the auspices
of the Conference during the two-year period.
On February 4, 1939 the Conference issued a call to Americans of all
creeds and beliefs to join with Roman Catholics in prayers for Pope Pius
X I on February 12th. In urging non-Catholics to join with Catholics in
prayers for the Pope and “for the fulfillment of his hopes for religion,
peace and tolerance,” the call stated, “A ll Americans have recognized the
Pope as an outstanding champion of the rights of minorities and the sa­
credness of the personal dignity of man and have admired his courage in
the defense of those rights as well as his deep sympathy for persecuted
people throughout the world.”
An appeal to Americans to strengthen religious conviction was issued
by prominent laymen of the three faiths in more than 1000 communities
under the auspices of the NCCJ on February 25, 1939. The appeal also
144 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
urged Americans to free themselves of all forms of bigotry and overcome
the tendencies toward race, class, religious and individual hatred which
threatened the future of America as well as the world.
On June 2, 1939 the Conference issued an appeal signed by more than
550 Protestant, Catholic and Jewish lay and clerical leaders who urged
Americans to repudiate doctrines which “pit class against class,” promote
racial and religious hatred and aim to destroy liberty.
On May 14, 1940 the NCCJ appealed to Americans not to let differ­
ences of opinion lead to “acrimony and unjust suspicion” in connection
with President Roosevelt’s appointment of Myron C. Taylor as his per­
sonal representative to the Vatican. “It is not within the province of the
National Conference of Christians and Jews,” the appeal said, “to pass
upon issues upon which there is no clear agreement among or within our
constituent groups. W hat concerns us primarily is that in these critical
times we of America should be on our guard lest differences of opinion,
legitimate in themselves, lead to acrimony and unjust suspicion. Such emo­
tions will impair both the nation’s quest for the establishment of justice
in the world and the vitally necessary cooperation among all citizens of
our country, whatever their religious faiths.”
An appeal for unity and goodwill among citizens of all faiths and classes
was issued by religious and lay leaders of the three faiths in local com­
munities throughout the country under the auspices of the N CCJ on Sep­
tember 23, 1940. The appeal warned that individuals and groups promot­
ing hatred against religious and racial elements are “America’s potential
traitors”, since “recent events have shown that the totalitarian states are
using new and insidious weapons of conquest. It is the propagation of lies
and suspicion directed against religious and racial groups in the population,
and its victory is the division of the nation into mutually hostile groups.”
II. Roman Catholic A ctivity
The problem of eliminating racial and religious prejudice and working
together with members of other faiths increasingly occupied Roman Cath­
olic individuals and groups during 1939 and 1940.
Outstanding development during this period was the formation in New
York of the Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism, whose name
was later changed to the Committee of Catholics for Human Rights.
Declaring that anti-Semitism in the United States is a “serious threat to
the principles of democracy and Christianity”, the Committee announced
that some seventy clergymen and laymen had replied to its call to “oppose
the dangerous aberration of anti-Semitism in the fullness of Christian
charity.” In June 1939 the Committee began publication of a monthly
INTERFAITH DEVELOPMENTS 145
eight-page tabloid newspaper, The Voice which it attempted to distribute
widely among Roman Catholics and others.
On May 22, 1939, in Washington, D. C., the Roman Catholic Hier­
archy of the United States, represented by the Administrative Board of the
National Catholic W elfare Conference, condemned all forms of racial
bigotry and warned Christian people to be on their guard against racial
prejudice.
Previously, the Catholic Daughters of America, at their semi-annual
meeting in New York on February 27, 1939 adopted a resolution urging
Catholics the world over to unite in opposing persecution of the Jews.
The National Catholic Alumni Federation, at its biennial convention
in New York on September 30, 1939, condemned anti-Semitism as being
“contrary to Christian Charity and to the doctrine of the Catholic Church”
and traced the “setting up of false divisions among men based upon theories
of race and blood superiority” to the “spread of secularism in the world.”
On September 20, 1940, the Catholic Information Society of New York
announced that it would launch a national drive against anti-Semitism,
which would include the widespread distribution of tolerance literature.
The need for closer cooperation with members of other faiths was em­
phasized during this period by Roman Catholic leaders.
Jacques Maritain, distinguished French Catholic philosopher, in a sig­
nificant lecture delivered at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York
on May 16, 1940, described the problem of good fellowship among the
members of different faiths as being a “cardinal one” for the “new age
of civilization” now dawning. Dr. Maritain asked his audience how a
peaceful society could be lastingly assured “if good fellowship and mutual
understanding cannot first be established in the domain that matters most
to the human being—in the spiritual and religious domain.”
In Washington, D. C. the Rev. James A. Geary, assistant professor of
Celtic languages and literature told the graduating class of Catholic Uni­
versity on June 14, 1939, that the Catholic Church can join with the Jew
and with other Christian bodies in common tasks that consider the fields
of philosophy, ethics, social and economic justice, and government, but
cannot participate in any activity that fails to recognize the essential differ­
ences in the tenets of the different faiths.
III. Protestant A ctivity
Protestant church groups showed great interest during the two-year
period in condemning intolerance in every form. Among the most significant
actions were the following:
During January 1939 the Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
146 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
South, described the persecution of the Jews in Germany as the “most as­
tonishing course of any nation on earth” and declared this persecution to
be part of a “larger effort to stamp out all religious influence.”
A message expressing sympathy with Roman Catholics in the death of
Pope Pius X I was cabled to the Vatican by the Federal Council of the
Churches of Christ in America during February 1939.
The Disciples of Christ, at a meeting of the Board of Trustees of its
United Missionary Society in Indianapolis March 15, 1939, condemned
race hatred, with particular reference to anti-Semitism.
The General Synod of the Reformed Church in America on June 14,
1939, called upon Christians to rebuke anti-Semitism, and urged churches
and clergymen to “do something really worthwhile to break down the
barriers between Jews and Christians.”
The Northern Baptist Convention, meeting in Los Angeles June 24,
1939, adopted a statement condemning anti-Semitism. The statement de­
clared, “it will be a sorry day for the churches of America if intolerance
shall be allowed to enter.”
The International Christian Endeavor convention in Cleveland, July
12, 1939, denounced intolerance and anti-Semitism in particular as a
“serious reflection upon the 'highest Christian ideals.”
A call to all churches and to all Christians to “expose the un-Christian
character” of anti-Semitic propaganda, was voiced in a report adopted by
the first General Conference of the united Methodist Church in Atlantic
City, N. J., on May 11, 1940.
Through its 152nd General Assembly at Rochester, N. Y. June 1, 1940
the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A. pledged itself to “participate both
as individuals and collectively in every world effort to combat anti-Sem­
itism” and called for “more Christ-like living in relation to the Jews.”
The cooperation of all religious faiths in working against the “sinister
forces operating in this country to undermine our faith in democracy, to
obliterate our religious freedom, and to destroy our American way of life,”
was asked in a resolution adopted by the biennial meeting of the General
Council of the Congregational Christian churches in Berkeley, Calif.,
August 23, 1940. The resolution particularly mentioned the “malice of
anti-Protestantism, anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism.”
The National Conference of Methodist Youth, meeting in biennial con­
vention at Winona Lake, Ind., September 3, 1940, voted support for all
movements and organizations working for cooperation among Catholics,
Jews and Protestants in campaigns against intolerance.
INTERFAITH DEVELOPMENTS 147
IV. J ewish A ctivity
There were many instances of interfaith activity and cooperation on the
part of Jewish individuals and groups during the years 1939 and 1940.
Jews throughout the country mourned the death of Pope Pius X I, and
a number of Jewish groups sponsored memorials to the Pope. This activity
was initiated by the B’nai B’rith, Jewish fraternal order, whose president,
Henry Monsky, called upon members of the order throughout the United
States and Canada to join with men and women of other faiths in spon­
soring memorials to Pope Pius. Practically every Anglo-Jewish paper in
the country devoted leading editorials or front-page stories to the news of
the Pope’s death, and all commented upon the late Pope’s frequently-ex-
pressed opposition to persecution, nazism and racism.
An outstanding event during 1940 was the donation of $250,000 to
Protestant and Catholic refugee agencies by the United Jewish Appeal for
Refugees and Overseas Needs made on January 3. This sum was turned
over by the Jewish agency to Protestant and Catholic agencies for the
benefit of Christian refugees. Rev. George A. Buttrick, President of the
Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, received $125,000
on behalf of Protestant agencies, and an equal amount was presented to
Pope Pius X II through Bishop Bernard J. S'heil of Chicago as a memorial
to Pope Pius X I.
Other incidents in communities throughout the country were indicative
of Jewish goodwill toward Christians. For example, soldiers of the Jewish
faith stationed at Fort Dix, N. J,, volunteered to waive their Christmas
furloughs in 1940 in order that a larger number of Roman Catholic and
Protestant soldiers might obtain Christmas leave. Army regulations pro­
vide that at least 25 percent of the Fort Dix Division (44th) must remain
in camp at all times.
In Columbus, Ohio, at the end of 1940, the First Methodist Church
presented Rabbi Samuel M. Gup of Temple Israel with a plaque expres­
sing the Methodist congregation’s gratitude for the use of the Temple
following a fire last spring which severely damaged the church. Other
instances of this nature, where churches were temporarily housed in syna­
gogue buildings, occurred during the year.
In Rochester, N. Y., Simon N. Stein, clothing manufacturer and philan­
thropist, whose benefactions to members of all religious faiths have been
notable, was awarded a medal by the Veterans of Foreign W ars as Roches­
ter’s “outstanding citizen of 1940.” In Cincinnati the local lodge of the
B’nai B’rith donated $300 to St. M ary’s Catholic hospital, after a cam­
paign for funds among its members on behalf of the hospital. Members
of the Jewish community of Utica, N. Y., raised a substantial sum to help
148 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
pay off the mortgage of South Congregational Church of that city. In
Milwaukee, Harry Bragarnick, a member of the B’nai B’rith, distributed
$500 to 13 Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish organizations. This
money represents fees received for his services as labor arbitrator.
V. Interfaith Cooperation
Unemployment and Labor Relations
Two significant interfaith conferences were held during 1940 for a con­
sideration of economic and unemployment problems.
A national Interfaith Conference on Unemployment was held during the
month of June in Washington, D. C. under the joint auspices of the Indus­
trial Division of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America,
the Social Action Department of the National Catholic Welfare
Conference, the Social Justice Commission of the Central Conference
of American Rabbis and the Social Justice Committee of the Rabbinical
Assembly of America. Representatives of religion, labor, industry, farmers,
consumers and government attended. Among the speakers were Rev. Albert
W . Beaven, the Rt. Rev. Msgr. John A. Ryan, Rabbi Samuel H. Golden-
son, Senator Elbert Thomas, Congressmen James Oliver and Jerry Voor-
his, Rev. R. A. McGowan, George Soule, Philip Murray, Rabbi Edward
L. Israel, E. R. Bowen and others.
The report of the findings of the Conference recommended a perma­
nent commission on unemployment composed of representatives of national
organizations in the fields of agriculture, labor, the consumer, finance,
manufacturing, commerce, government, education and religion, to be called
together by the government. Congressman Voorhis of California later in­
troduced a bill aimed to enact this recommendation into law.
In December, 1938, an Interfaith Conference on Democracy and Eco­
nomic Planning was held in Brooklyn, N. Y., at which prominent clergy­
men of the three faiths discussed the economic situation in this country in
consultation with economists, employers, labor leaders, farm leaders, con­
sumers’ cooperative leaders and government officials. The Committee on
Arrangements for the Conference consisted of the Rev. James Myers, Rev.
R. A. McGowan and Rabbi Edward L. Israel. As a result of this Con­
ference a joint statement on Democracy and Economic Planning was issued
to the nation on May 24th, 1939, signed by more than 100 eminent clergy­
men of the three faiths.
This interfaith activity was manifest during 1940 in the field of rela­
tionships with labor. For example, three prominent clergymen particularly
interested in labor issued during February a joint “urgent” appeal to the
American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organiza-
INTERFAITH DEVELOPMENTS 149
tions to settle their differences by negotiation. The statement was issued
by the Rev. James Myers, the Rt. Rev. Msgr. John A. Ryan, and Rabbi
Edward L. Israel.
In Minneapolis, Protestant, Catholic and Jewish leaders held a series
of monthly “get acquainted” luncheons with members of the Minneapolis
Central Labor Union’s board of business agents. Purpose of the luncheons
was to acquaint participants with church and labor objectives.
Clean Literature Crusades
Interfaith cooperation during the two-year period under review was
frequently that of combatting indecent literature.
Initiated by Roman Catholic organizations, the clean literature cam­
paign was joined by Protestant and Jewish groups throughout the country.
During 1939 leaders of all faiths in California supported a bill before the
state legislature which proposed to make the dissemination of indecent liter­
ature and pictures in any form a felony. In Richmond, more than 40 clergy­
men and laymen of all faiths took part in a clean literature campaign dur­
ing the early part of 1939. Joint meetings of the three faiths were held
in Norfolk, Danville and other Virginian cities. Similar meetings were
held in other parts of the country. In Detroit, the Council of Churches,
composed of 400 Protestant congregations, voted to support the campaign
against salacious literature being carried on by the various Catholic organi­
zations in the city.
Other Cooperative Activities
Marriage problems occupied the attention of interfaith groups in various
communities. For example, agencies representing the three faiths met in
Pittsburgh early in January 1939 to discuss changes in the Pennsylvania
marriage laws. In New York City during November 1939 three ministers
of the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish faiths participated in the first of a
series of lectures on marriage and family relations and the home under
the auspices of the Hunter College Student Council and the College
Division of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
In Buffalo, during January 1940 an interfaith Committee was organized
to promote religious instruction in the schools.
Some 50 Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant leaders from all parts
of Michigan met at Ann Arbor during November 1939 to study the prob­
lem of juvenile delinquency, and named a committee to develop a state­
wide program of education and church activity in this field.
An interfaith committee to place refugee children of all faiths in foster
homes of their own religious affiliations was formed in New York City
during March 1939. The plan was developed by Protestant, Catholic and
150 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
Jewish leaders, child welfare experts, and the American Friends Service
Committee-
In Rochester, on February 1, 1939, religious groups of all faiths, govern­
ment and social agencies cooperated in a mid-Winter Exposition designed
to show how the various groups may work together in a program for com­
munity betterment.
To the projects listed above many might be added. They indicate a
growing sense of fellowship on the part of all who believe in God, what­
ever their names or religious affiliations may be, and an increasing readi­
ness to unite for the defense and advancement of the religious principles
they hold in common, and in the interest of the ends that are of common
concern to them as American citizens.
COOPERATION AND UNITY
By H. Paul Douglass, Editor of Christendom
I. T he W orld Background
The year 1940 found organized religion suffering radical difficulties in
so many areas of the earth that serious students of the history of religion
had felt driven to contemplate the possibility of a reversal of its centuries
of progress and the advent of an indefinite period of its serious institutional
weakening throughout the world. Yet the report on “The State of the
Church,” made to the Biennial session of the Federal Council of the
Churches of Christ in America, declared that, in the present upheavals of
mankind, the Church remains the least shaken of our major institutions.
In a time of the progressive loss of political and economic security the
Church’s own fellowship has held under all strains, and its unity has
increased.
Communication has been actively maintained among all branches of the
Church, and extensive help extended to war prisoners and refugees. Almost
complete loyalty to Christian fellowship has continued among previously
associated Christian leaders of the warring nations. Representatives of the
ecumenical movement of the non-Roman churches have conferred directly
with the Pope concerning war work. In many parts of Europe, Catholics
and Protestants have increasingly made common cause, and active inter­
faith cooperation in the United States and Canada has been a strong in­
fluence against prejudice and in behalf of constructive national unity.
A recent inventory covering all continents shows the continuance of the
movement toward church unity in all its characteristic phases, in some
scores of cases. (See Information Service, 297 Fourth Avenue, New York,
Volume X IX , Number 28.) Discussions and negotiations looking toward
union have gone forward, but relatively few cases have reached actual con­
summation during the year.
There has been a strong tendency toward the combination and strength­
ening of agencies in which the churches are already united. Thus, the as­
sembly of the English Free Church Council, meeting in April, completed
the merger of two existing organizations, the Federal Council and the
Free Church Council, and created a single common organ. The Federal
Council of the Churches of Christ in America has been strengthened by
the acceptance of full membership by the Protestant Episcopal Church
previously affiliated only in a limited sense.
The confused state of the world has naturally introduced complications
into movements for church unity at numerous points. Thus, Japanese
151
152 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
churches had been looking toward unity on long established lines, but had
it forced suddenly upon them as a result of the drastic Religions Bill re­
quiring “all religions to fit into the framework of Japan’s new national
structure.” The churches of Baptist, Congregational, Lutheran, Methodist,
Presbyterian and United Brethren origins united on October 17. The
Anglican Japanese Church is still attempting to maintain independent ex­
istence, and the Japanese Government has apparently accorded separate
status to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches within the
Christian group. Heightened racial tension in South Africa has caused
churches of African natives to withdraw from national unity organizations
in a movement for an All-African Church.
Elsewhere, discussions of unity have been accelerated by political cir­
cumstances. The unification of the German Free Churches has been ac­
tively discussed and the cooperative Councils of Churches of Holland and
Sweden have been reinforced in membership in view of the need of strength­
ening the churches’ position.
The W orld Council of Churches gained the adherence of additional
churches in Australia, Canada, England, Scotland, Switzerland and the
United States, where seven new churches joined. The most notable of the
new adherents was the Church of England. Seventy communions now
belong to the W orld Council. Its activities have gone forward continuously,
its agents moving somewhat freely among all the belligerent and occupied
countries. The Council has served as an agency of mutual aid and has
carried on extensive work for war prisoners and refugees. One hundred
sixty-eight “orphaned missions” separated from their German, Belgian,
Danish, Dutch and French support by the war have 'been cared for by
denominational missionary agencies cooperating through the International
Missionary Council. British churches both in England and South Africa
have safeguarded and aided the missions of nations with which they are
at war.
The Octave of Prayer in January, originating in Roman Catholic cir­
cles devoted to the promotion of church unity, has been adopted as an
annual season by the Faith and Order Movement associated with the
W orld Council, and was accepted by the American Section at its last
meeting. This action tends to unite all branches of Christendom in aspira­
tion and in religious observance in behalf of the ultimate unity of the
whole Church.
II. U nited States: Denominational U nity M ovements
1. Closer Baptist-Disciples Relationships. Renewing a suggestion which
has repeatedly been before these two churches (See Douglass: Church
COOPERATION AND UNITY 153
Unity Movements in the United States, pp. 76-80), the Northern Baptist
Convention at its 1940 session heard a plea for greater unity from the
fraternal delegates of the Disciples’ churches, and referred without debate
to its General Council, a motion to explore the possibility of closer co­
operation.
2. Congregational-Christian Churches. Defining the Congregational fel­
lowship as an autonomous group possessing a peculiar religious treasure
but not a separatist group, the Congregational and Christian Churches in
General Council in August, 1940, amended their constitution so as to pro­
vide for a class of “ecumenical members” to be appointed by other denom­
inations as follows: the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in
America, and every communion connected with it; also the American Uni­
tarian Association, the Universalist Church and the Community Church
Workers of the United States, together with such other communions as
may be named by the General Council, may hereafter be represented in
the Council by two delegates each. (Advance Reports, General Council
of the Congregational and Christian Churches, 1940, pp. 44-5.)
3. Disciples and Churches of Christ. For a third year an unofficial con­
ference was held between groups seeking to unify these two branches of
the same movement. Their meeting took place in Lexington, Kentucky.
4. The Witness of the Churches of the Congregational Order. Since
the 1937 Edinburgh Conference on Faith and Order, several informal con­
ferences of American Baptists, Congregationalists and Disciples have been
held with a view to determining the degree to which they, as Christian
bodies of the congregational order, have a united testimony to give and
what that testimony is. A committee, designated to carry these conversa­
tions forward, arranged an exchange of papers among writers of the three
denominations on topics designated by a 1938 Buffalo meeting of their
representatives. These were later published under the title, The Witness
of the Churches of the Congregational Order. ( Christendom, 297 Fourth
Avenue, New York City, 1940, 35 cents.)
Additional papers attempting to summarize and synthesize the common
elements of the discussion appeared in the 1940 Autumn number of Chris­
tendom under the titles “Beliefs and Progress Summarized,” by Robert A.
Ashworth; “Can These Three Be One?” by Charles Clayton Morrison;
and “Can Basic Attitudes Be Synthesized?” by Douglas Horton. (Reprints
available from Christendom, 297 Fourth Avenue, New York City, 5 cents
each.)
Participants in the earlier tri-denominational conferences are being asked
to organize discussion groups in their respective communities to consider
154 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
these results. The preliminary organization of such groups has already
been undertaken in New York and Chicago.
5. Evangelical and Reformed Churches. The year 1939 saw the carry­
ing through of the final stages of the uniting of the Evangelical Synod and
Reformed Church and the new constitution became fully operative in 1940.
The organization of the new joint synods as subordinate units of the
merged churches was also completed in 1939.
6. United Brethren in Christ and Evangelical Churches. The com­
missions on church unity of the United Brethren in Christ and the Evan­
gelical Churches announced in November, 1939, the proposed basis of
union which has been under negotiation for several years. These must be
acted upon by the next quadrennial sessions of the two bodies, and then
transmitted for ratification to the local congregations in the United Brethren
Church and to the Annual Conferences in the Evangelical Church. The
ecclesiastical systems of both denominations are essentially Methodist. Re­
cently their negotiations have been extended to include the Evangelical
Congregational group of churches. This is likely to prove the next American
union to reach actual consummation.
7. Lutheran Unity. The three major Lutheran groups (United Luth­
eran, American Lutheran Conference and Synodical Conference) have had
commissions on Lutheran unity at work under somewhat diverse authoriza­
tion. In 1938 and 1939 reports from these commissions were presented to
the respective churches. These focussed in an attempt to agree as a basis
for union on a formula relative to the inspiration of the Scriptures. (See
News Bulletin, October 7-14, 1938, News Bureau, National Lutheran
Council.)
United Lutheran. The 1939 report of the Committee on Fellowship of
the United Lutheran Convention recommended that negotiations for union
continue with the American Lutheran Church, but not immediately with
the Missouri Synod. Its 1940 Convention approved the doctrinal basis of
unity drafted by negotiators of the three larger Lutheran groups, but took
no steps toward actual union.
The American Lutheran Conference in which are affiliated the American
Lutheran Church, Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, Evangelical
Lutheran Augustana Synod of North America, the Lutheran Free Church
and the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church, continued conversa­
tions in 1939 with the Missouri Synod on the basis of articles accepted in
1938 as “a sufficient doctrinal basis for church union.” The chief points
still unsettled concerned the infallibility and verbal inspiration of the Bible.
These have been discussed in numerous local conferences of the two groups,
COOPERATION AND UNITY 155
with results generally favorable to union. But the statement is still regarded
in some quarters as doctrinally inadequate (not erroneous), and the Nor­
wegian Synod and Wisconsin Synod (affiliates of the Missouri Synod) have
both passed resolutions adverse to union on these terms. Arguments in
rebuttal of this criticism of inadequacy insist that even greater omissions
may be found in the standards of the most conservative Synods. The 1940
session of the American Lutheran Conference declared that its experience
in federating groups of different national origins “affords a basis for a
genuine federal union of all Lutherans.”
Discussions in the Convention of the American Lutheran Church tended
to limit the interest of this Church to “pulpit and altar fellowship” in
distinction from organic union.
The Lutheran Synodical Conference, meeting in Chicago in 1940 declared
that “further clarification of vital matters” is necessary before carrying
forward proposals for union with the American Lutheran Church.
8. The Methodist Church. The most outstanding event of a century in
Methodism was the consummation in 1939 of the union of the three major
bodies, the Methodist Episcopal, Methodist Episcopal South and Methodist
Protestant Churches. The Uniting Conference was held in Kansas City.
The name of the new body becomes simply The Methodist Church. Dupli­
cato r churches of two or more of the uniting denominations are numerous
only in two or three states, so that the problem of local adjustment is not
serious.
The united Methodist Church vests authority in its General Conference
in matters of concern to the entire church. The new plan, however, involves
considerable decentralization. Its outstanding structural feature is the divi­
sion of the Methodist Church of continental United States into six Juris­
dictional Conferences; five of which are geographical and the sixth composed
of Negro churches. No bishop may function outside of the jurisdiction which
elects him except on invitation. In brief, though the Methodist episcopacy is
related to the whole church by consecration and continues both as a central
body for counsel and a symbol of its unity, the episcopacy becomes more
definitely than before a territorial office.
The months subsequent to unification have been devoted to a multitude
of actions implementing the uniting legislation, including the combination
of subordinate units in territory where duplication existed, and of the
agencies of the three churches. The unification of general agencies involv­
ing a single board of missions has proceeded gradually. The chief actions
of the 1940 General Conference were designed to complete the unification
of the Church. The location of boards was determined, dividing them among
New York, Chicago, Nashville, St. Louis, Columbus, Ohio, and Washing-
156 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
ton, D. C. A single major denominational periodical was decided upon with
such regional additions as its board might determine, and Rev. Roy L. Smith
of the First Methodist Church, Los Angeles, well-known writer of
syndicated religious material, was elected editor of the national Advocate.
Following the General Conference, the six jurisdictional Conferences rep­
resenting the decentralization of ecclesiastical authority were held in their
respective regions. Transfer to these bodies of the authority to elect bishops
and members of the major bodies of the Church removed from the General
Conference some of its most characteristic business as well as its most
spirited contests. A few vacancies in the episcopal ranks were filled by the
jurisdictions. It is reliably stated that at no time either in official action or
in the life of the Church had differences of opinion followed the lines of
the previous separate churches. Conversations have been initiated with the
Colored Methodist Episcopal Church looking toward the inclusion of that
body in the Methodist Church.
9. Negro Methodists. The union of the three larger denominations of
Negro Methodists was discussed in the 1939 Conference of the African
Methodist Church and subsequently approved by its Council of Bishops.
Informal conversations with the other bodies concerned have gone on inter­
mittently.
10. Presbyterian U. S. A, and Presbyterian U. S. Churches. Negotiations
for union between these two bodies have been continued under new authori­
zation from their respective General Assemblies. The latest proposal is em­
bodied in a statement of “basic principles” presented by a joint committee
which includes eight points.
A provision for regional synods is designed to leave the Southern branch
of the church with a degree of autonomy and would provide a measure of
decentralization in a church which the proposed union would make genu­
inely nationwide. (1939 Minutes of the General Assembly, Presbyterian,
U. S. A , p. 62).
The 1940 General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, U. S., voted to
continue negotiations for union with “all branches of the Presbyterian
Church,” but weakened the terms of the authorization of its negotiations
with the Presbyterian Church, U. S. A.
11. United Presbyterian. The General Assembly meeting in Buffalo in
May 1940 authorized its Committee on Church Relationships to confer with
any church desiring union. This is understood to reopen the possibility
of negotiations with the Presbyterian Church, U. S. A., which the United
Presbyterian Church voted down in 1936.
12. Presbyterian, U. S. A.-Protestant Episcopal Negotiations. Probably
COOPERATION AND UNITY 157
the most significant attack yet made by American churches upon the central
issues which divide them is represented by current negotiations for organic
union between the Presbyterian, U. S. A., and Protestant Episcopal
Churches. These renew negotiations first entered upon soon after the Epis­
copal proposal of the famous Quadrilateral in 1886, and are a culmination
of more recent conversations between authorized representatives of the two
communions in the sphere of Christian morality and of approaches to organic
unity.
In October, 1937, the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal
Church invited the Presbyterian Church, U. S. A., to join with it in the
acceptance of a declaration as follows :
The two Churches, one in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Word
of God, recognizing the Holy Scriptures as the supreme rule of faith, accepting the
two sacraments ordained by Christ, and believing that the visible unity of Christ’s
Church is the will of God, hereby formally declare their purpose to achieve organic
unity between their respective Churches. (Syllabus on Approaches to Unityt p. 15.)
The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the following
May adopted the same declaration and the two Churches authorized their
respective representatives to proceed with negotiations which have been
under way since October, 1938. As a result, the commissions of the two
Churches jointly issued statements on “Things Believed in Common” and
“Things That Might Be Undertaken in Common.” Supplemental action
strengthened the latter statement and recommends numerous methods of
contact between Episcopal and Presbyterian churches with a view to encour­
aging a demand for their unity among the laity, so that the impulse might
“come from below rather than from above.” Numerous joint services of
worship and discussions have been held by local groups and congregations in
all parts of the country.
The central item of the joint report of the two commissions, the Proposed
Concordat, turned out to furnish the chief point for differences of opinion as
the discussion has proceeded. The immediate purpose of the Concordat is
“to provide means whereby each Church may, wherever it seems locally de­
sirable, assume pastoral charge of the members of the other Church and offer
them the privileges of the Holy Communion, thus establishing one congre­
gation.” (Syllabus, p. 9.)
The assumption back of the Proposed Concordat is declared to be the be­
lief of both Churches that “all practice in regard to the ministry should look
forward to one which may have universal acceptance ; both recognize that a
truly reunited Church would be something greater than either and inclusive
of both; and, each Church recognizes the ministry of the other as a real min­
istry of the W ord and sacraments within its own sphere.”
The theory on which the Concordat proceeds from this point to its par-
158 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
ticular proposal is that “both Churches believe in episcopal ordination, the
one by a bishop with attendant presbyters, the other by a presbytery acting
in its episcopal capacity,”
On the ground of this assumption the Concordat proposes an extension
of ministerial commissions— “not to be regarded as a reordination, but as
recognition of an ordination valid in the body conferring it.” The act of this
extension of ordination is to be as follows:
In the case of a minister of the Presbyterian Church, the bishop of the diocese
concerned, when satisfied as to the qualifications of the candidate, with attendant
presbyters, shall lay his hands on his head and say: “Take thou authority to exe­
cute (exercise) among us the office of a presbyter in the Church of God, committed
to thee by the imposition of our hands. In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.” In the case of a minister of the Protestant Episcopal
Church the presbytery shall proceed in the same manner and use the same sentence.
All baptized members of either church who have been confirmed or who have made
profession of faith shall be eligible to receive the Holy Communion wherever this
arrangement has been entered into. (Syllabus, p. 10.)
The primary ecclesiastical status and responsibility of ministers receiving
extended commissions is not changed, though they enter upon a secondary
responsibility to the administrative authorities of the other commissioning
church. The arrangements pertain only to the diocese or presbytery first
concerned and are definitely declared to be interim arrangements to continue
until organic unity is achieved.
A subsequent session of the two commissions considered an alternative
proposal for “dual membership” by which ministers and laymen of the two
Churches might each fulfill the full conditions for ordination or member­
ship in both Churches so that they would have complete standing as ministers
or members of both under present canonical or constitutional requirements.
The Presbyterian commission formally objected to the substitution of this
proposal on the ground that it virtually called in question the full status
of the Presbyterian Church and its ministers within the Holy Catholic
Church. (Syllabus, p. 34f.)
The discussion of these proposals in the two Churches has been active,
voluminous and at some points, bitter. A typical argument in opposition to
the Concordat attacks its “major premise” ; namely, “the equal validity of
Presbyterian and Episcopal orders.” To equate Presbyterian ordination and
Episcopal ordination is to surrender the “historic episcopate as essential to the
structure and sacramental life of the Holy Catholic Church and thus to
break with Catholic faith and order.” (George Craig Stewart: “The
Concordat and the Ministry,” The Living Church, June 5, 1940, p. 7f.)
This statement of the late Bishop Stewart appears to bring out the essential
point of disagreement.
It was anticipated that the results of the negotiations would come before
COOPERATION AND UNITY 159
the Episcopal General Convention in October, 1940; but an influential
body of opinion, voiced by Bishop W . T. Manning among others, urged
that the Concordat be withdrawn, as constituting a divisive proposal. A
survey of Episcopal opinion on the Proposed Concordat recently initiated by
The Living Church classifies 530 replies and shows that substantially one-
third favor the adoption of the Proposed Concordat; approximately one-half
disapprove it but would continue negotiations with the Presbyterian Church
along other lines; while about a quarter would terminate negotiations alto­
gether. Considerable differences between clergy and laity appear in this
showing. Relatively more laymen take the extreme positions, either to adopt
the Concordat or to terminate negotiations. The report of the Committee on
Approaches to Unity to the 1940 General Convention of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, meeting in Kansas City, consequently recommended no
action on the proposed Concordat. The chief reason assigned was a desire
to secure the advice of the Lambeth Conference of the Anglican bishops,
whose session has been indefinitely postponed on account of the war. The
Committee’s report and the discussion of it indicated strong differences of
judgment within itself and within the church. The Committee on Ap­
proaches to Unity was continued.
13. Protestant Episcopal and Reformed Episcopal Churches. The nego­
tiations between these bodies were kept alive by Reformed Episcopal action
in 1940 authorizing their continuance, and by inclusion in the report of the
Protestant Episcopal Commission on Unity.
III. Cooperative A ctivity in the U nited States
On the level of cooperation through agencies of interchurch activity very
significant progress has been made in the improvement both of the machinery
and the practice, and there has been appreciable addition to the volume of
cooperation.
1. Local Councils of Churches. New city councils have been organized in
Davenport, Iowa; Durham, North Carolina; Erie, Pennsylvania; Meriden,
Connecticut; Burlington, New Jersey; and Nassau County, Long Island,
with several others in process of organization. There are now forty-three
councils of churches in the larger cities.
2. State Councils. The chief advance in state councils has come through
the combination of existing interchurch agencies into inclusive councils or by
the assumption of broader functions by existing agencies. The Ohio State
Council of Churches and the Ohio Council of Religious Education have
merged. The Missouri Church and Sunday School Council has reorganized
as the Missouri Council of Churches and preliminary steps toward perma­
nent organization of state councils have been taken in Oklahoma, Indiana
and Wyoming. Other mergers of agencies are being studied in Kansas,
160 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
Colorado, New Jersey, and North Dakota. Twenty-one states have now
established the inclusive type of organization.
3. Joint Field Department. The Intercouncil Field Department has been
maintained by seven national interchurch agencies whose field personnel has
been constituted as a joint staff. A ll major field programs undertaken by
any of the agencies are cleared through the Joint Department and there is
general direction of field work in the interests of a unified approach to local
communities.
4. Study of Still Closer Relationships. A meeting of representatives of
the International Council of Religious Education, the Foreign Missions
Conference, the Home Missions Council, the Council of Women for Home
Missions, the National Council of Church Women and the Federal Council
of Churches was held on May 29, 1940, and determined to explore the prob­
lem of how much farther the agencies would be willing to go in the direction
of organizational integration. Subcommittees were appointed to report on
the possibilities of three types of closer relationship defined as follows:
(a) “Further Cooperative Activity Within the Present Organizational
Set-Up.”
(b) “Some Form of Federated Organization.”
(c) “Merging of the Organizations into a Single Corporate Body.”
On November 18, 1940, a meeting of the joint committee of the agencies
received the subcommittees’ reports and voted to request their respective
agencies to appoint further committees for joint study and the carrying on
of educational processes with view to developing a common mind and the
ultimate drafting of a plan of closer relationship, to be submitted for action
to the constituent denominations.
5. Association of Council Secretaries. An important step toward closer
relations was the merger in July, 1940, of the Association of Executive Sec­
retaries and the Employed Council Officers Association. These were the
voluntary professional organizations of the staffs of Councils of Churches
and of Religious Education, respectively. The two organizations have met
jointly for a number of years and their combination into one organization
was the result of growing solidarity and the closer relationships of the em­
ploying agencies.
6. Joint Meetings at Atlantic City. Joint meetings of seven national inter-
church agencies were held in Atlantic City in December, 1940, in connection
with the Biennial meeting of the Federal Council of Churches. The con­
vergence of these numerous interests at one time and place resulted in a large
COOPERATION AND UNITY 161
and enthusiastic attendance. Numerous joint sessions were held and the im­
portant conclusions were jointly arrived at. This bringing together of the
total cooperative forces both symbolized and added strength to their growing
spirit and practice of unity.
IV. A m e r ic a n P a r t ic ip a t io n in W o r l d M o v e m e n t s
1. The A merican Sections of Life and Work and Faith and Order. Ameri­
can participation in the W orld Council of Churches has been carried for­
ward through joint meetings of these two branches of the ecumenical move­
ment now provisionally united in the W orld Council. A Joint Executive
Committee has been maintained. Additional responsibilities have fallen to
the American Section on account of broken communications incident to war
conditions, especially in the realms of publication and finance.
2. Canada. Cooperative relations between Canadian churches have re­
cently been distinctly advanced through their participation in the ecumenical
movement. The choice of Canadian representatives to the Utrecht meeting
which set up the W orld Council of Churches was happily and generously
effected. Following the ecumenical conferences of 1937, representatives of
several Canadian churches formed a “Canadian Continuation Committee on
Life and W ork and Faith and Order.” This group was later constituted as
“The Canadian Committee of the W orld Council of Churches in Process of
Formation.” The chairman is the Bishop of Niagara and the membership
includes the Baptist churches; the Churches of Christ (Disciples) ; the
Anglican Church; the Evangelical Church; the Evangelical Lutheran
Church; the Presbyterian Church; the United Church; the Religious Society
of Friends; and the Salvation Army, in addition to consultative bodies.
The Canadian Committee of the W orld Council of Churches has co­
operated with the similar American group in a North American Section of
the W orld Council, and in the sponsorship of the magazine Christendom.

D uring 1939 and 1940, the w orld crisis probably overshadowed the w ork
of all the churches. Numerous declarations w ere made at ecclesiastical
assemblies. These were generally described as “middle positions.” The
churches urged an international ministry o f reconciliation; they asked for
generous giving for the relief o f sufferers from w a r conditions; they called
for study of the bases of a durable peace; they asked for fellowship of
churches, across the lines o f battle, thus upholding the Ecumenical or w orld­
wide, or universal concept of the church. O ver one hundred orphaned mis­
sions were aided by special funds raised in American churches. Denomina­
tional efforts for relief abroad were coordinated during the year by the
Join t Committee on Foreign Relief Appeals, established by the Foreign
Missions Conference and the Federal Council. A t the Council’s biennial
meeting a group o f distinguished churchmen reported on the “state of the
church” to the Council, not for it, that the church remained the “least
shaken” o f all our m ajor institutions by war, social upheaval and revolution
throughout the w orld.
T h e T a y l o r A p p o in t m e n t
According to Religious News Service, at least thirty Protestant denomina­
tions, or synods or conferences within denominations, either form ally pro­
tested the appointment by President Roosevelt late in 1939 of M yron C.
T aylor, prominent Episcopal layman, as his personal representative at the
Vatican, or asked for M r. T aylo r’s recall. T he appointment was also ap­
proved, or at least not opposed, by representative Protestant officials, but
more official opposition than support seemed apparent. T he Executive Com­
mittee of the Federal Council, representing 22 religious bodies, approved
the appointment, only if it was temporary and special, for the purpose of
assisting peace moves. President Roosevelt stated the appointment was tem­
porary. Nothing was heard of the matter after M r. T aylo r’s return to the
United States late in 1940.
T h e C o n s c ie n t io u s O b je c t o r
Numerous churches affirm ed the right of the conscientious objector to
w ar service, and certain o f them arranged fo r the registration o f their own

members taking this position. During the registration of men of draft age
in 1940, only a negligible number of absolute pacifists failed to present them­
selves and give the necessary information. The historic peace churches, e.g.,
Friends, Brethren, Mennonites, all advised their members to register. Unof­
ficial estimates indicated that about one per cent of the trainees were con­
scientious objectors. Late in 1940, many church agencies were actively pre­
paring to assist those refusing combatant or non-combatant army service.
The churches interested were about to carry out plans to support many of
these young men, who would not receive government compensation, even
though they were assigned to work of national importance under civilian
direction, mainly soil conservation work.
T he 1936 Census of Religious Bodies
The Federal Census of Religious Bodies for 1936, released in August,
1940, revealed that many thousands of ministers and clerks of local churches
had failed to respond to three or four requests for membership and financial
data of the same type as the Bureau of the Census had successfully obtained
in 1906, 1916 and 1926. (The 1926 reports were widely regarded as the
most complete reporting ever achieved.) The August, 1940, release of the
Bureau of the Census showed 256 religious bodies with 199,302 local
churches having 55,807,366 members, as compared with 213 bodies and
232,154 local churches with 54,576,346 members in 1926. In June, 1936,
the Christian Heraldf New York, published a compilation of the reports of
official statisticians of 208 religious bodies with 245,005 local churches hav­
ing 62,678,177 members. It would appear that possibly 45,000 local churches
did not report, and of these more than 20,000 were in three denominations:
Southern Baptist Convention, Methodist Episcopal Church and Methodist
Episcopal Church, South. The Census was taken under authority of Acts
of Congress, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt and President Herbert
Hoover. However, there was much misunderstanding of the effort. Rumors
were circulated by churchmen and among churchmen that the census was
“just a New Deal proposition,” that it was an attempt of the state to “invade”
the church, that it was an unwarranted interference of the state in the life
of the Church, etc. The non-cooperation of numerous Protestant churches
made direct comparisons of the 1926 and 1936 censuses impossible.
Summaries of events and trends within religious bodies, and related to
them follow:
T he Protestant Episcopal C hurch
In 1939 the Episcopal Church celebrated the 150th anniversary of the
adoption of the American Prayer Book. Important processes of self-appraisal
164 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
were initiated under a National Committee on Strategy and Policy, and
also independently in certain dioceses. The House of Bishops met, approved
the right of conscientious objectors to register as non-combatants, and issued
a pastoral letter which looked toward a federation of nations as a means of
securing peace.
The Triennial General Convention met in Kansas City in October, 1940.
The most extensively debated issue before the Convention was the suggested
amendment to the canon on marriage and divorce presented by a special com­
mission which had studied the question for fifteen years. The proposed
canon attempted unsuccessfully to reconcile two points of view in regard to
Christian marriage. On the one hand, it asserted that Christian marriage
was indissoluble, and that no clergyman might admit to the contrary by
marrying any divorced person. Such remarriage was declared to be a viola­
tion of a law of God as interpreted by Jesus. Any divorced person remarried
must be excommunicated, according to the proposed amendment. On the
other hand, in certain exceptional cases remarriage of a divorced person
might be blessed and the person restored to the communion of the church.
The proposed amendment, even though it passed the House of Bishops, was
rejected by the House of Deputies. The canon now in effect prohibits the
marriage of a divorced person, with the exception that the rule does not
apply to the innocent party in a divorce for adultery, provided that before
the application for such remarriage a period of not less than one year shall
have elapsed after the granting of a divorce, and that satisfactory evidence
touching the facts in the case be laid before the ecclesiastical authority. Any
minister may decline to solemnize any such remarriage. A new commission
for further study of the matter of divorce was authorized.
The much discussed suggested concordat with the Presbyterian Church in
the U. S. A. was not brought before the Convention for action. This con­
cordat would have permitted ministers of either church under an identical
form of authorization to have performed their offices and have charge of
congregations in the other. It is believed that the concordat was not pre­
sented both because of widespread opposition, mainly from Anglo-Catholics,
and because of a desire on the part of Episcopal leaders to obtain the advice
of the Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops from all parts of the world,
which conference has been indefinitely postponed on account of the war.
The National Cathedral at Washington, D. C., was designated as the seat
of the presiding bishop, but this was not interpreted as determining his resi­
dence, or meaning any change in the offices of the National Council of the
Church from 281 Fourth Avenue, New York, N. Y. After debating the
question for twenty years, the Convention voted to join the Federal Council
of the Churches of Christ in America. Previously the National Council of
PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS 165
the Church had cooperated in a limited way with certain departments of the
Federal Council.
U nited L utheran C hurch
The Biennial Convention of the United Lutheran Church was held in
Omaha in October, 1940. The Convention reiterated the doctrine of “just
war” and declared the duty of Christians to bear arms. It also affirmed the
ultimate authority of individual conscience, and provided a set of measures
for the protection of the rights of its members who are conscientious objec­
tors to military service. The recently established Board of Social Missions
reaffirmed previous declarations of the church that it is in agreement with
Scripture that the churches should occupy themselves with civic and social
matters and set forth in detail certain emergency responsibilities of the church
in time of social stress and international crisis. The Convention authorized
participation of the United Lutheran Church in an all-Lutheran conference
on forms of worship. The Convention denounced the appointment by Presi­
dent Roosevelt of Myron C. Taylor as his personal representative at the
Vatican, as a violation of the principle of the separation of church and state.
It deplored the persecution of German speaking congregations in Canada, as
a result of hysteria and war prejudice, and declared that this persecution had
gone on in spite of the fact that most of the members of these churches were
not German in nationality.
M ethodist Church
The first session of the quadrennial General Conference of the newly
formed Methodist Church was held at Atlantic City in May, 1940. The
Methodist Church is a merger of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church.
The uniting conference of the three bodies was held a year earlier and since
the events of the past two years deal mainly with unification, they are de­
tailed in the chapter on “Cooperation and Unity,” by Dr. Douglass. A single
official periodical was decided upon and Rev. Roy L. Smith of the First
Methodist Church of Los Angeles, California, well-known writer of syndi­
cated religious material, was elected editor of the national Advocate, which
began publication in 1941, with headquarters in Chicago, 111.
Ordained women were denied the right of membership in annual confer­
ences, which substantially deprives them of standing in the ministry. Educa­
tional requirements for entering the ministry were raised. The General
Conference denounced war as an evil but maintained the right of individual
conscience as to participation in it. An effort to withdraw support from the
military chaplaincy was defeated. It was voted to ask President Roosevelt
166 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
to recall Myron C. Taylor as his personal representative at the Vatican. The
General Conference decided that the term consecration rather than ordina­
tion should be used for the recognition of new bishops by the entire church
in order to make it clear that bishops do not constitute a different order of
ministry from other preachers.
Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A.
The 1939 General Assembly met in Cleveland, and elected Sam Higgin-
bottom, a layman, well-known agricultural missionary, of Allahabad College,
Allahabad, India, as moderator. A proposal to rewrite the “shorter cate­
chism” was presented and referred for later report. The Assembly opposed
the extension of the federal social security system either to ministers or lay-
workers in the churches.
The 1940 General Assembly convened in Rochester, N. Y., in June. W il­
liam L. Young, president of Park College, Mo., was elected the moderator.
A resolution declared the sinfulness of war, but the Assembly refused to
amend its constitutional reference to a “just war,” apparently on the theory
that the question could not be considered calmly in the present international
situation. The Board of Christian Education was asked to make a basic
study of the church and war. The Assembly made provision for the registra­
tion of members who are conscientious objectors, and also asserted the right
of conscientious objection to military service. In a thorough resolution the
Assembly discussed President Roosevelt’s appointment of Myron C. Taylor
as his personal representative at the Vatican, and called for its termination
on the ground that it was unconstitutional.
A report was made that the Board of Christian Education had been suc­
cessful in raising a special fund of $8,000,000 out of a goal of $10,000,000
set, for the strengthening of denomination®! schools and colleges. The
Assembly passed a strong resolution condemning Anti-Semitism.
Presbyterian Church in the U. S.
The 1939 General Assembly met at Montreat, N. C., in May and elected
Dr. Edward Mack of Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Va., as
moderator. The Assembly adopted rules making the method of calling and
employing ministers more definite than it had been. It was reported that a
$3,000,000 annuity fund for the support of retired ministers was nearly
completed. The Assembly laid great stress on evangelism.
The 1940 General Assembly of this Church was in session in Chattanooga,
Tenn., in May, and elected Rev. Frank C. Brown, Dallas, Texas, as mod­
erator. The Assembly refused to take formal action in regard to the appoint­
ment of Myron C. Taylor as the personal representative of President Roose-
PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS 167
velt at the Vatican, even though there was strong opinion that a formal
pronouncement should be made.
Disciples of Christ
The last session of the International Convention was held at Richmond,
Va., in October, 1939. The next session will meet in St. Louis, in May,
1941. The Disciples of Christ conduct their business in a mass convention
in which any member of a local church may participate and vote. A novel
feature in 1939 was the series of general forums, focused on special interests
of modern Christianity. A Joint Youth Commission, with the Northern
Baptist Convention, was proposed. Negotiations for union with the Negro
Disciples were begun. The extension of religious instruction in public schools
was favored. Worship services were marked by the use of liturgical ma­
terial. As moderator, the Convention elected Rev. H. B. McCormick, min­
ister of the Lakewood Church, Lakewood, Ohio.
This denomination is engaged in a five-year program of advance to
strengthen the church. The special effort began in 1937. There is also a
Commission “to restudy the Disciples,” which made a progress report at
Richmond in 1939 and is continuing its work. In 1940 the Christian Evan­
gelist offered a view on the Myron C. Taylor appointment to the Vatican
which was in strong contrast to the sentiments of many Protestant religious
journals—it offered a qualified defense of the Taylor appointment and
requested that it be not criticised. Officials of the church set ui> machinery
for the registration of conscientious objectors, authorized by the 1939
Convention.
Congregational Christian Churches
In 1939 began a period of testing of a new theory of leadership, initiated
by Rev. Douglas Horton, who began his active service in January. Dr.
Horton specified that in his position he should be designated as “minister” as
well as secretary. The step marked a general attempt to combine intellectual
and spiritual leadership with administrative duties. This policy was imple­
mented by numerous visits to local churches by the unsalaried Moderator,
Rev. Oscar Maurer, of New Haven.
The Biennial General Council of this denomination met in Berkeley,
California, in August, 1940, and elected former Governor William E. Sweet,
of Colorado, as moderator. The meeting marked the end of the first decade
of union between the Congregational and Christian Churches. The names
of both have been carried as the title of the church. The 1940 Council
marked the completion and permanence of this union by changing its name
so that it will read simply, “The General Council of Congregational Chris­
tian Churches.” Among the important actions the Council passed a resolu-
168 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
tion asking for early termination of the Taylor appointment to the Vatican;
it asked for civilian control of conscientious objectors to the Selective Service
A c t; it called for the cooperation of all religious faiths against forces under­
mining democracy, religious freedom and the American way of life; it par­
ticularly denounced religious bigotry. The Council tabled a resolution which
would have called upon the country for “deepened searching debate and
mature deliberation” before the adoption of military conscription in the
nation.
Northern Baptist Convention
The 1939 Convention met in Los Angeles, in June, and elected Rev.
Elmer A. Fridell, Berkeley Divinity School, Berkeley, California, as presi­
dent. Rev. Earl F. Adams of Buffalo was made general director of promo­
tion for the denomination. The Convention voted to join the W orld Council
of Churches, with the proviso that it would not be bound by any actions of
the Council except as they would be ratified by its own action. The Con­
vention debated a proposal to give endorsement to the Wagner Labor Rela­
tions Act, but declined to give a formal endorsement.
Meeting in Atlantic City in May, 1940, the most significant actions of
the Convention related to issues of war and peace. It condemned war as a
method of settling international disputes and the invasion of helpless peoples
by totalitarian powers, and extended sympathy to the democracies of the
world. It warned the public against hysteria and propaganda, and urged a
careful scrutiny of news reports, domestic and foreign. The Convention
provided for registry of members of the denomination who are conscientious
objectors to participation in war, and protection of their rights. It asked
for a reconsideration by the President of his appointment of Myron C.
Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican. Ernest J. Millington,
a layman of Cadillac, Michigan, was elected president of the Convention.
An independent Baptist pacifist organization was formed by persons attend­
ing the Convention.
Southern Baptist Convention
The 1939 Convention met in Oklahoma City in May, and elected Rev.
L. R. Scarborough, president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Sem­
inary, Fort Worth, Texas, as president. Informed observers stated that the
Convention seemed almost unanimously opposed to the current trend of
thought in favor of church union. Sentiment in favor of the continued sepa­
ration of church and state took second place. From the floor, strong opposi­
tion was voiced to joining the W orld Council of Churches, which proposal
was referred to a committee for future study and report.
The 1940 Southern Baptist Convention met at Baltimore, Md., in June,
PROTESTANT DEN O M IN ATIO N S 169
and elected William W . Hamilton of New Orleans to succeed L. R. Scar­
borough of Fort Worth, Texas. The Convention protested President Roose­
velt’s appointment of Myron C. Taylor of New York as his personal repre­
sentative at the Vatican. It voted to continue the special emphasis on evan­
gelism carried out the previous two years. The social service commission
reported renewed efforts for temperance, and recorded great satisfaction
over the decline in the number of reported lynchings of Negroes. The Con­
vention declared that discriminations against Negroes in the administration
of justice, in pursuits of industry, and in education, must be removed. It
recognized the right of the individual to conscientious objection to military
service. The Convention declined the invitation previously extended to mem­
bership in the W orld Council of Churches. The Convention opposed the
inclusion of ministers and lay employees in the Social Security system.
Friends
The various branches of the Friends reiterated the traditional Quaker
witness in regard to absolute opposition to war, and furthered intensive serv­
ices on behalf of refugees, sharecroppers and other neglected groups in the
United States, and also relief efforts in various European countries. The
American Friends Service Committee, Philadelphia, was the agency through
which these various relief efforts were carried out. In 1940 the Committee
announced the formation of volunteer work camps for young persons called
for training under the Selective Service Act and who were conscientious
objectors.
Federated and Independent Churches
The Bureau of the Census reported through the Census of Religious
Bodies, 1936, new information in regard to federated and independent
churches. Federated churches are usually defined as those that conduct local
affairs in common but maintain national denominational affiliation. The
Census reported 508 such churches for the year 1936, of which 82 are in
urban territory (places having over 2,500 persons) and 426 in rural areas.
This was a considerable gain over the number reported in 1926 when the
figure was 361. These churches are found mainly in New England, the
Middle Atlantic and East North Central and West North Central states.
For the year 1936 there were also reported 384 local independent congrega­
tions, an increase over the figure of 259 for the year 1926. One hundred
fifteen of these were in urban territory and 269 in rural.
ROMAN CATHOLIC ACTIVITIES
By Charles A. M cM ahon, Editor, Catholic Action
Monthly Publication of the National Catholic Welfare Conference
Acknowledging a letter sent by the Bishops of the United States to thank
him for his Encyclical Letter, Sertum Laetitiae, sent toward the end of
1939 to mark the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the American
Hierarchy, Pope Pius X II expressed his gratitude and happiness because
of the pastoral care with which the Archbishops and Bishops defend and
encourage religion in this country.
The 1940 edition of The Official Catholic Directory placed the Catholic
population of the United States, Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands at
21,403,136.
T he T aylor A ppointment
The dawn of the year 1940 brought Pope Pius X II’s memorable response
to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s message to His Holiness at Christmas,
1939, in which he announced the appointment of Myron C. Taylor as his
special representative at the Vatican. Pope Pius said that when the day of
peace dawns only those who unite with high political power “a clear under­
standing of the voice of humanity along with a sincere reverence for the
divine precepts of life” will be able to “discern the path that should be
followed.”
M r. Taylor took up his duties at the Vatican on February 27. He was
subsequently taken seriously ill and underwent an operation while abroad.
He returned home at the end of August
The executive committee of the Federal Council of Churches indorsed
M r. Taylor’s appointment, since it assumed that “the appointment is strictly
temporary, unofficial and centrally concerned with the efforts for world
peace.” Some Protestant groups voiced objection. The Jewish Advocate
regretted this latter attitude and called it unwarranted. The National Con­
ference of Christians and Jews appealed to all religious groups against per­
mitting “acrimony and unjust suspicion” to arise as the result of differences
of opinion over M r. Taylor’s appointment.
On March 3 the first anniversary of Pius X II’s coronation was solemnly
observed in the United States, the Most Rev. Amleto Giovanni Cicognani,
Apostolic Delegate to the United States, leading in these ceremonies. In
May, responding to the plea of the Holy Father; American Catholics set
aside a period of earnest supplication for the restoration of peace. Again, the
response in the United States was impressive when His Holiness invited
Catholics throughout the world to join with him in making November 24 a
day of propitiation for peace and the relief of suffering occasioned by the war.
170
CATHOLIC ACTIVITIES 171
W ork of the Catholic Association for International Peace throughout
the year centered around the five conditions of peace enunciated by Pope
Pius X II at Christmas, 1939, and a three-point program formulated by its
Executive Committee at the outbreak of the European war, namely: Help
keep the United States out of war; help to end war everywhere; help to
bring the United States into world organization at the end of war so as
to end injustice and the causes of war.
M eeting of Hierarchy
W ith 100 members of the Hierarchy in attendance, and with His Emi­
nence Dennis Cardinal Dougherty, Archbishop of Philadelphia, presiding,
the Annual General Meeting of the Archbishops and Bishops of the United
States took steps to coordinate Catholic interests and activities stemming
from the nation’s program for preparedness, and to unify all Catholic relief
and refugee work under a single Episcopal Committee. To accomplish the
first of these objectives, a National Catholic Community Service composed
of the N. C. W . C. Administrative Board, plus the M ilitary Vicar of the
Army and Navy Ordinariate or his representative, was organized. The
Administrative Board itself became the unifying committee on relief.
It was revealed that a sum in excess of $1,200,000 had been provided by
the Bishops for the relief of suffering peoples abroad. It was also disclosed
that the Episcopal Committee for Catholic Refugees had handled 4,319
refugee cases since its establishment in 1937. The United Jewish Appeal
for Refugees and Overseas Needs made a gift of $125,000 to Pope Pius X II
in memory of Pope Pius X I for relief of refugees.
The Bishops took cognizance of this nation’s extraordinary peace-time
efforts to defend American institutions and pledged themselves and their
flocks to “give themselves unstintingly” to their country’s “defense and its
lasting endurance and welfare.”
Selective Service
The Rt. Rev. Msgr. Michael J. Ready, at the direction of the N. C. W . C.
Administrative Board, appeared before committees of the Senate and the
House to ask specific exemption of priests, seminarians and Religious under
the Burke-Wadsworth Bill, which, as originally drawn, empowered the
President to grant deferred status to priests and ministers of religion under
the draft provisions, but made no mention of seminarians or brothers. Mon­
signor Ready’s recommendations were embodied in the Selective Service and
Training Act of 1940. In his statement, Monsignor Ready also urged that
“the possibility of a one-year voluntary enlistment should be exhausted before
resorting to a compulsory one.”
172 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
Chaplains
The Rt. Rev. Msgr. William R. Arnold, chief of chaplains, United States
Army, announced that 75 Catholic chaplains, the greatest number since the
W orld W ar, were on active duty with the Army toward the end of 1940,
and that about 275 additional Catholic chaplains would be needed by April 1,
1941. Miss Agnes C. Roselle, a Catholic of Washington, D. C., was called
to active duty with the Army Nurse Corps, the first of 4,019 nurses the
Army planned to call to duty by July, 1941. Attendance at Mass on Army
posts and stations throughout the United States and in overseas possessions
during the year ending June 30, 1940, totaled more than the attendance at
any other one form of devotion conducted by the 137 Army chaplains.
Films
The Episcopal Committee on Motion Pictures issued a strong protest
against the “increasing objectionable tendencies which lately have become
manifest in films,” and urged all Catholics, particularly parents, to renew
their vigilance “against the pernicious influence of films which disregard the
moral law and subvert the foundations of Christian society.”
Y outh
W ith the Most Rev. John A. Duffy, Bishop of Buffalo, as its Episcopal
Chairman, a new Department of Youth was established in the National
Catholic Welfare Conference to “meet the needs of youth in these critical
times and supply the spiritual defense essential to Christian democratic life.”
The Rev. Vincent Mooney, C. S. C., Director of the new Department,
issued a statement warning Catholic youth organizations and Catholic youth
generally not to commit themselves to any youth movement, federation or
agency without first having carefully studied its objectives and possible
ramifications. He stated the reasons why Catholics cannot and have not
participated in the activities of the American Youth Congress. Christian
democratic ideals were stressed at a three-day conference of 4,000 Catholic
youths held in Chicago in October.
T he Social Order
Perhaps the most important statement issued by the Administrative Board
of the N. C. W , C. during the year was that entitled “The Church and
Social Order,” urging “the necessity of bringing back God into education,
into economic life, into all life, private and public, individual and social.”
This statement received the warm commendation of Pope Pius XII, as well
as of Cardinal Pizzardo, high Government officials, outstanding personali­
ties in many walks of life, and of editorials in secular, labor and non-Catholic
CATHOLIC ACTIVITIES 173
religious publications. The statement was printed in the Congressional
Record. So far more than 75,000 copies have been distributed. An edition
costing one penny has been published by the N. C. W . C. to place the state­
ment within the reach of all.
Labor
The N. C. W . C. Department of Social Action assisted in arrangements
for the observance in dioceses through the country of the golden jubilee of
Pope Leo XIITs Encyclical on the Condition of Labor and the tenth anni­
versary of Pope Pius XFs Encyclical on Reconstructing the Social Order,
which occurs in May, 1941. The Rev. Dr. Edgar Schmiedeler, O. S. B.,
Director of the Rural Life Bureau, N. C. W . C., Department of Social
Action, issued a statement warning that a well-planned attack is being
launched against cooperatives in the United States, with a view to destroy­
ing them or reducing their constructive service to a minimum.
The Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems held regional meetings
in New Orleans, Buffalo and Rochester, and a meeting on the Negro in
Industry, held at Detroit in conjunction with the National Catholic Inter­
racial Federation. The Rev. Dr. John P. Boland, Chairman of the New
York State Labor Relations Board, effected a settlement of the 13-month
strike at the Hotel Governor Clinton in New York City. Labor schools
were organized by Bishops in many dioceses, and effective efforts were made
to spread a knowledge of Catholic social teaching.
T he Press
Reporting that “the voice of the Catholic Press of Continental Europe
has largely been silenced or muffled,” through the war, Frank A. Hall,
director of the N. C. W . C. News Service, told the 30th annual meeting of
the Catholic Press Association of the United States, in Detroit, that there
falls upon the American Catholic Press “the heavy burden of leadership in
carrying on a great and urgently needed work.”
Six new Catholic newspapers and six new magazines were founded in
the United States during the year, while the N. C. W . C. News Service
showed a net gain of 16 new subscribers, or 10 more than the increase in the
previous year. Subscribers in 25 countries are now being served.
Perhaps the principal undertaking in the field of the Catholic Press dur­
ing the year was the initiation of plans for the addition of a world-wide news
service in Spanish and Portuguese, under the aegis of the N. C. W . C. News
Service, for the Catholic press of Latin-American nations. Some 1,200 dele­
gates from coast to coast took part in the National Catholic Educational
Press Congress held at Marquette University in October. A comprehensive
174 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
survey conducted by The Lutheran, official organ of the United Lutheran
Church, developed that the Catholic Church receives more secular news­
paper space than any single Protestant group, but that the total space given
five major Protestant denominations is almost twice that accorded Catholic
news.
C hristian Doctrine
Pope Pius X II expressed “solid satisfaction and comfort” in the achieve­
ments already recorded by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in the
United States, and appealed to its members to “continue to go forward to
new conquests for Christ during the years which lie ahead.”
This exhortation was contained in a letter to the Most Rev. Edwin V.
O’Hara, Bishop of Kansas City and Chairman of the Episcopal Committee
on the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine. W ith regard to adult educa­
tion, the Confraternity reported that 48 dioceses are sponsoring religious
discussion club programs in all parishes, some of these dioceses having 800
such clubs and others 400. A total of about 80,000 adults in 21 dioceses
engaged in a study of their religion during the year as a result of Con­
fraternity activity. Revision of the Baltimore Catechism was completed,
with a prospect that the revised English New Testament will be published
in 1941. Literature distributed totaled 265,410 pieces.
The special discourse addressed to the Catholics of the United States by
Pope Pius XII, over the radio, on October 19, was deeply impressive. The
Sovereign Pontiff’s words were a special Mission Sunday appeal, and lauded
the “large-souled liberality” of American Catholics. Catholic priests,
brothers and sisters continued to go out from the United States to foreign
missions, and the Franciscans of the California Province were invited to take
over several missions in Suchow Vicariate, China. The Catholic Medical
Mission Board in New York reported that strife throughout the world was
bringing agonized appeals from missionaries for more medical supplies.
Education
Priests and seminarians studying in Europe were ordered home by their
Bishops and Superiors as the war clouds darkened. An increase in ordina­
tions in the United States was revealed by a survey made public by the
N. C. W . C. Department of Education. The report said 1,218 young men
were ordained in 1938 as compared with 922 ordained in 1928. The total
of 76,010 graduates receiving diplomas from Catholic schools last June set
a record. Catholic school construction work valued at millions of dollars
was begun in 1940. The Department of Superintendents of the National
Catholic Educational Association asked in November that Catholic school
CATHOLIC ACTIVITIES 175
authorities “continue their efforts to secure for Catholic school pupils a just
share of the funds which are annually expended by the Federal Government
and the individual States for the support of education.”
Dedicating a Catholic high school in McSherrytown, Pa., Archbishop
Cicognani, Apostolic Delegate, emphasized the responsibility of parents
for the rearing and education of their children. The National Citizens Com­
mittee created by the White House Conference on Children in a Democracy,
adopted a ten-point program, presented by the Rev. Dr. Bryan J. McEnte-
gart, of the Child Care Division of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of
New York, for child conservation in the national defense activities. New
York State enacted legislation to provide religious education to public school
children, and steps in this direction were taken in other parts of the country.
The Attorney General’s office in Louisiana ruled that needy children in
parochial and private schools are eligible to participate in the State free
school lunch program.
Lay Organizations
The National Council of Catholic Women climaxed two decades of
service to the Church with a convention at Detroit, where it received the
Blessing of Pope Pius X II transmitted through the Apostolic Delegate.
The National Council of Catholic Men pressed on to further achieve­
ments, especially in the field of radio broadcasting, where its “Catholic
Hour” program, noting its tenth anniversary, brought a record-breaking
total of 293,987 commendatory letters in three months.
The Knights of Columbus received the thanks of Pope Pius X II for their
gifts to the chapel of St. Peter’s Oratory, which is outstanding among five
playgrounds in Rome established by the K. of C. The K. of C. pledged
“hearty support to the Bishops’ crusade to emphasize doctrines at once
American and Catholic, through the civic education program sponsored by
the Commission on American Citizenship under the auspices of the Catholic
University of America.”
M onument to Christ
Demolition of the old headquarters building of the N. C. W . C. at 1312
Massachusetts Avenue, N. W ., in the National Capital, was begun at the
close of the year to make way for the erection of a new headquarters building
and the construction of the monument to Christ, the Light of the World,
to be erected as the outcome of a campaign conducted by Our Sunday Visitor,
of which the Most Rev. John F. Noll, Bishop of Fort Wayne, Ind., is editor.
The monument will consist of a 90-foot white stone facade of the new
building, with a sculptured statue of Christ standing in a semi-circular niche.
176 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
Hospitals
William F. Montavon, Director of the Legal Department, N. C. W . C.,
appeared before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor to urge
certain amendments to the National Hospital Construction Act of 1940.
This measure proposed the erection of about 100 small hospitals in rural
communities standing in need of such facilities. W hile agreeing in principle
with the purposes of the bill, M r. Montavon urged changes, in the interest
of the community, which should provide a higher degree of autonomy to a
community in the administration of its hospital. M r. Montavon said he
spoke for the N. C. W . C., the Catholic Hospital Association, and the Na­
tional Conference of Catholic Charities. His position was supported by
representatives of the American Hospital Association and the Protestant
Hospital Association.
The silver jubilee convention of the Catholic Hospital Association adopted
a resolution saying the Federal Government in its public health program
should emphasize assistance to individual patients rather than to institutions.
The 1940 Directory Number of Hospital Progress, official journal of the
Catholic Hospital Association, said that of the 1,969,788 patients treated in
Catholic hospitals in this country over a year, 57.8 per cent were non-
Catholics. It was stated that, for the year 1939, there were 682 Catholic
hospitals in the United States and 179 in Canada. A National Conference
of Catholic Nurses was formally organized as a part of the N. C. W . C.
program.
A ttack Against Pope Pius
A campaign of vilification against Pope Pius X II waged in Italy by
Roberto Farinacci, Minister of State and editor of Regime Fascista, stirred
deep resentment among Catholics in the United States, and numerous and
earnest were the protests. The Rt. Rev. Michael J. Ready, General Secre­
tary of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, branded Signor Fari-
nacci’s outpourings as a “hysterical, lying attack,” and asked : “Has it come
to the point where a leading Italian Fascist and influential editor, seemingly
with Government consent, finds it expedient to ape the clumsy, unscrupu­
lous propaganda methods of the Nazis?” The attacks stopped shortly
afterward.
Important A nniversaries
Archbishop Cicognani headed a long list of dignitaries who took part in
the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Catholic
Hierarchy in California. His Excellency also attended ceremonies in the
Minor Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Baltimore,
on May 30, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of
CATHOLIC ACTIVITIES 177
the Catholic Hierarchy in the United States. The Apostolic Delegate also
led Catholics in a series of ceremonies marking the 400th anniversary of the
confirmation of the Society of Jesus. Other anniversaries included:
The 375th anniversary of the founding of St. Augustine, Florida; the
centenary of the Sisters of Providence in America, the centenary of the
canonization of St. Alphonsus Liguori, founder of the Redemptorists; the
centenary of the death of Father Demetrious Augustine Gallitzin, Prince
of Russia and missionary to Western Pennsylvania; the centenary of the
Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in the United States; the centenary of
Fordham University; the diamond jubilee of The Catholic W orld; the
silver jubilee of the Central Association of the Miraculous Medal; the

ORGANIZED JUDAISM
By L o u is M i n s k y , Religious News Service
T he years 1939 and 1940 were marked by numerous activities in all fields
o f Jew ish communal affairs, w ith a notable tendency tow ard closer coopera­
tion and greater coordination of effort. Am ong the m ajor developments
during this period w ere intensification of religious life and marked expan­
sion in religious education. T he necessity of caring for refugees and an
increasing number of Jew s abroad affected by the w a r resulted in unprece­
dented relief efforts. T he United States became the center of Zionist
efforts, and American Jew ry generally assumed leadership in Jewish life
throughout the w orld.
J e w is h R e l ig io u s L if e
U nity in the religious field assumed mainly an organizational character.
T he Synagogue Council o f America, composed of representatives of all the
m ajor religious bodies, assumed new life and importance. A nother trend to­
wards unity was discernible in the return to traditional practices within the
Reform wing. A number of congregations, for example, discontinued their
Sunday services and returned to the traditional F riday evening services. This
tendency was accompanied by an increasing emphasis upon ceremonials.
O n the other hand, the trend toward the Am ericanization of O rthodox
Judaism continued. Rabbis with European training are often being succeeded
by young American-born men, trained in American seminaries. M oderniza­
tion is proceeding all along the line without the sacrifice o f basic principles,
a trend regarded as being all to the good and indicating that both these
branches of Judaism should be stronger with young people than ever before
in the past.
T he national conventions o f religious organizations, the pronouncements
and resolutions of which, to a great extent, reflect the religious thought o f
the Jewish community, dealt w ith a number o f problems affecting Jew ry,
religion and democracy. Am ong these were, the threat of totalitarianism to
religion and democracy, the need for intensifying religious education, em­
phasis upon social justice and civil liberties, and concern w ith national
defense and the preservation of peace.
T he Union o f American Hebrew Congregations, (R eform ) at its 36th
biennial Council in Cincinnati, January 7-19, 1939, announced the organiza­
tion of a new affiliate, a National Federation o f T em ple Y outh, to serve
jointly w ith its older affiliates, the National Federation of Tem ple Brother­
hoods and Sisterhoods. It adopted resolutions expressing appreciation o f
President Roosevelt’s encouragement to religion as an institution indispen-
180
ORGANIZED JUDAISM 181
sable to America, reaffirming the right of asylum, and expressing opposition
to all forms of dictatorships.
The Central Conference of American Rabbis (Reform) opened its 50th
Annual Convention in Washington on June 13, 1939, with a presidential
message by Rabbi Max C. Currick, in which he proposed a Jewish religious
front in America. Before concluding its five-day sessions the Conference
adopted the report of its Commission on Social Justice, condemning Nazism,
Fascism and Communism, and urging the passage of various social legislative
measures then before the Congress of the U. S. The Conference also called
upon all religious groups in America to join in counteracting un-American
and irreligious propaganda.
A t its 51st annual convention at Charlevoix, Michigan, June 18-23, 1940,
the Central Conference endorsed the national defense policy. Reaffirming
concern with Israel’s historic ideal of peace,jh e report of the Committee on
International Peace advocated a union of Jewish forces to secure civil rights
for Jews upon the restoration of peace. The conference also approved the
report of its Social Justice Commission, which called for the maintenance
of civil liberties and the expansion of liberal legislation. It also upheld the
position of Jewish religious conscientious objectors to war.
The Rabbinical Assembly of America (Conservative) held its 39th an­
nual convention at Asbury Park, N. J., July 4, 1939. The Assembly passed
resolutions urging shorter school days to allow more time for religious edu­
cation, repudiating all forms of totalitarianism, protesting Great Britain’s
Palestine stand, commending rehabilitation work accomplished by the Ameri­
can Society of Friends among refugees, and supporting the Wagner-Rogers
Child Refugee bill. The convention also reported an increase in adult
Jewish education projects.
At the 40th annual convention in Detroit, June 25-July 8, 1940, Rabbi
Max Arzt, president of the Rabbinical Assembly, urged a broad program for
the strengthening of the democratic system in the United States. Resolutions
were passed urging support of 1‘every necessary measure of national defense”
but at the same time warning of the danger should we “in our hysterical haste
to resist the enemy, adopt his weapons of persecution, injustice and group
hatreds.” Also adopted was a six-point declaration reaffirming faith in
democracy and the maintenance of civil rights and calling for exertion of
effort on behalf of the underprivileged and increased support for Palestine.
The United Synagogue of America, at its biennial convention held in
Atlantic City, May 12-13, 1940, emphasized the relation between religion
and democratic development. The organization decided to create a national
committee for defense of the American way. The delegates also adopted
plans to expand and coordinate Jewish religious education.
182 YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN CHURCHES
The Rabbinical Council of America (Orthodox) at its meeting at Haines
Falls, N. Y., on June 27, 1939, reaffirmed its adherence to democracy and
condemned all- forms of totalitarianism. At the Council’s 1940 convention,
held in New York, August 19-21, several prominent rabbis stressed the need
for greater unity among the Jews of the United States and emphasized the
necessity of promoting religion among Jewish youth.
J ewish Education
The most notable development during the years 1939 and 1940 in the field
of Jewish education was the adoption by various bodies of extensive educa­
tional programs.
The American Association for Jewish Education, organized in 1939 to
serve as a coordinating agency for lay leadership and for bureaus of Jewish
education throughout the country, held its first annual meeting in Atlantic
City on May 5, 1940. Resolutions adopted at the meeting called for the
establishment of a field service, a national board of license for certification
of Hebrew teachers, and cooperation with the National Council for Jewish
Education in conducting the annual Jewish Education Month and Week.
The Jewish Education Committee was formed in November, 1939, to
administer the gift of $1,000,000 given by the Michael Friedsam Founda­
tion for Jewish Education in New York City. A program to supervise and
coordinate fund-raising and pedagogical work of Jewish schools in Greater
New York was outlined. The Committee began publication in 1940 of
World-Over, a fortnightly news-pictorial paper for Jewish children.
A joint appeal to Jewish congregations for the improvement of the stand­
ard of education in traditional schools was issued on December 9, 1939, by
the Rabbinical Council of America and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Con­
gregations. Following a series of conferences between representatives of
orthodox schools, the Committee on Orthodox Hebrew Education in Greater
New York was formed in January, 1940, to guide New York Talmud
Torahs. The opening of orthodox schools for girls in New York, Cincinnati,
Cleveland and other cities was also announced by Agudath Israel, an Ortho­
dox organization, in April, 1940. An intensive program of religious educa­
tion was adopted by the United Synagogue of America in December, 1939,
and plans for its implementation were discussed at its convention in May,
1940.
The National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods, which had taken over
supervision of the work of the Jewish Chautauqua Society, an independent
group for over thirty years, announced that the Society’s program of educa­
tion would be extended to the colleges and communities of the country.
Under its sponsorship the University of Virginia offered a course in Jewish
ORGANIZED JUDAISM 183
religion during the 1940 summer session, and the Society reported, on A pril
16, 1940, that 135 colleges in 44 states were being visited by its speaker staff
of nearly 100 rabbis.
A wide extension program was undertaken in 1939 by the National H illel
Commission of the B ’nai B ’rith, which serves Jew ish students on college
campuses throughout the country. W hen the colleges opened in 1939, 21 new
units were established. Further expansion of the program was made in
1940. A t the beginning of the second semester of the 1940-41 college year
there were 57 H illel units in every section of the country, serving in excess
of 30,000 Jew ish students.
T he Institute for Interdenominational Studies was begun under a grant
from Lucius N. Littauer in the fall of 1939 at the Jew ish Theological Sem­
inary of America in N ew Y ork City. The Institute began its second year on
November 12, 1940, under the changed name of Institute for Religious
Studies.
T he first and second volumes of the U niversal Jew ish Encyclopedia were
published in 1939 and 1940. This is the first w ork of its kind produced
under American auspices since the publication of the Jew ish Encyclopedia,
35 years ago. T he Encyclopedia is to be in ten volumes.
Celebration of the 900th anniversary of the birth of Rashi, outstanding
H ebrew scholar and foremost commentator on biblical and Talm udic litera­
ture, was marked by a public exhibition at the museum of the Jew ish Theo­
logical Seminary of over a hundred books and manuscripts of Rashi and his
historians. O ther Rashi celebrations were held throughout the country
sponsored by Jewish education and cultural institutions.
W elfare Organizations
D ue to the increase of problems facing Jew s, both in the United States
and abroad, the two-year period under review saw the w elfare agencies of
the Jew ish Community engaged in unprecedented activity.
T he seventh general assembly of the Council of Jew ish Federations and
W elfare Funds, held in D etroit, January 27-29, 1940, was the largest in
the history of the Council. The assembly was concerned principally with
the financing of overseas relief and refugee programs, but also devoted con­
siderable attention to the coordination of civic-protective work, Jew ish edu­
cation and the development of the Jew ish settlement in Palestine. A t the
previous assembly, held in Baltimore, January 21-23, 1939, the need for
unprecedented giving to meet emergency conditions was emphasized.
T he National Conference of Jewish Social W elfare held its annual con­
vention in Buffalo, June 14-17, 1939, and formed a Jew ish Occupational
Council to study the economic adjustment for Am erican Jew s. A t the fol-
184 YEARBOOK OF AM ERICAN CHURCHES
lowing annual convention, M ay 22-26, 1940, in Pittsburgh, Pa., M orris D .
W aldm an, Secretary of the American Jew ish Committee, declared that
events in Europe had shifted the perspective of Jew ish social w ork from phil­
anthropy to Jewish self-preservation. M r. W aldm an emphasized the need
of training for the administration of public relations and overseas relief
activities.
T he Yearbook of Jewish Social W ork, published by the Council of Jew ish
Federations and W elfare Funds in June, 1940, showed that the volume of
service provided by homes for the aged, general hospitals and clinics under
Jewish auspices, was at its peak during the year.
The National Refugee Service reported that more than 3,500 refugees
were moved into new communities in the U nited States during 1939, and
over 1,500 were resettled during the first three months of 1940. W illiam
Haber, executive director of the Service, declared that the refugees coming
from Germany and other European countries were more rapidly adjusting
themselves to American ways of life than any other immigrant group since
the C ivil W a r.
T he 96th annual meeting of the executive committee of the B ’nai B ’rith
held in Tampa, Fla., on February 4, 1940, pledged support o f the move­
ment to keep America at peace, condemned Nazi and Soviet aggressors,
appealed for efforts to develop the Jewish settlement in Palestine, and
stressed the need fo r unrelenting effort in preserving democratic traditions.
The National Council of Jewish W om en held its 16th triennial conven­
tion in N ew York, November 10-14, 1940. T he Convention adopted resolu­
tions supporting President Roosevelt’s policy o f keeping this country out of
war, favoring admission of refugee children from the w ar zone, advocating
a “congressional-executive-civilian defense commission,” and opposing at­
tempts to m ilitarize agencies set up by the government to meet social and
economic needs. The council also reaffirmed its support of public housing,
Federal minimum wage and maximum hour legislation, and of child labor,
anti-lynching and uniform marriage and divorce laws.
Palestine Problems
The outbreak of the w ar caused G reat Britain to suspend for the duration
of the hostilities the projection of a policy w ith reference to Jewish immigra­
tion, which had been vigorously protested by the Jew s of the United States
and by many Christian leaders.
The proposed policy for Palestine was announced in a “W h ite Paper”
issued on M ay 17, 1939, which proposed permanent m inority status for the
Jew s, restricted Jew ish immigration to 10,000 persons annually for five
years, after which Jewish immigration would be banned, and further decreed
ORGANIZED JUDAISM 185
entry of additional 25,000 refugees, subject to approval of the High Com­
missioner, who w ill also regulate and prohibit land sales. British-guided
representative government would be established after five years, followed by
an independent state within ten years.
The reaction to this “W h ite Paper” was sw ift. A storm of indignation in
the United States followed its publication. On M ay 21st, 1939, thousands
of Jew s attended protest rallies in large cities. Senator W illiam King of
U tah, in a Senate speech, termed G reat B ritain’s Palestine policy, “betrayal
of the Jew s.” A cable appealing to Prim e M inister Chamberlain to fu lfill
the terms of the B alfour Declaration was signed by W illiam Green, John L .
Lewis, Senator Robert F. W agner, Fiorello L aG uardia and other promi­
nent personalities.
On M ay 22nd tw o hundred and fifty Jew ish leaders from 26 states urged
Secretary of State Cordell H ull to refuse recognition of the W h ite Paper on
the grounds of the 1924 Anglo-American Convention agreement. On M ay
26th, fifteen of the 25 members of the House Foreign A ffairs Committee,
headed by Representative Hamilton Fish, Jr., requested the State D epart­
ment to protest on the same grounds.
Replying several days later to this and other Congressional statements in
a letter to 150 members of Congress, Secretary H ull reaffirm ed the position
that the United States could not prevent changes in the status of the H oly
Land, but would take all necessary measures for the protection of American
rights and interests in Palestine.
T he outbreak o f the w ar, however, caused a suspension of efforts on the
part of G reat Britain to implement the policy of the “W h ite Paper.” Immi­
gration was allowed to continue as part of the defense program. As the w a r
progressed Zionist opinion tended to shelve differences w ith Britain in regard
to Palestine policy in order not to impede the successful prosecution of the
w ar. Zionist bodies, in the meantime, made plans for increased immigration
and financial aid to Palestine.
T he fifth annual National Conference for Palestine, meeting under the
auspices of the U nited Palestine Appeal in W ashington, D . C., January 6-7,
1940, heard reports of progress in land purchases and developments in Pales­
tine and adopted plans for increased fund-raising efforts through the U nited
Jew ish Appeal. T he 43rd annual convention of the Zionist organization o f
Am erica held in Pittsburgh, June 30-Ju ly 2, 1940, urged the British G ov­
ernment to give Palestine Jew s the right to arm in defense of their country,
and heard reports that continued immigration would be assured despite the
w ar.
T he 26th annual convention of Hadassah, the W om en’s Zionist O rganiza­
tion, held at Cincinnati, October 30-N ovember 3rd, 1940, adopted a reso-
186 YEARBOOK OF AM ERICAN CHURCHES
lution asking the British Governm ent “to welcome the demands of the
Jew ish community in Palestine which hopes to achieve its natural right to
fight side by side w ith G reat Britain against a common enemy.” T he Con­
vention agreed to raise $ 1,150 ,0 0 0 for work in Palestine during the ensuing
tw elve months. T he M izrachi W om en’s Organization voted during M ay,
1940, to raise $ 10 0,00 0 for the establishment of a colony in Palestine in
honor of the country’s Chief Rabbi, Isaac Herzog.
A id for Overseas Communities
Anti-Jew ish outrages throughout Germ any and A ustria in November,
1938, demonstrated the need for larger funds for the relief of Jew ry abroad,
a fact which, in turn called for unusually intensive fund-raising methods.
A s a result, m ajor overseas relief agencies organized a new type of combined
drive to yield larger funds during 1939.
The Joint Distribution Committee, the U nited Palestine Appeal and the
National Refugee Service, Inc., joined in the formation of the United Jewish
Appeal for Refugees and Overseas Needs for 1939, and inaugurated a cam­
paign for $20,000,000. The total raised during 1939 was over $15,000,000,
marking a peak for recent years. Approxim ately 3,200 Jewish communities
throughout the country participated in the 1939 effort.
O f this sum the Joint Distribution Committee was alloted $8,150,000,
the United Palestine Appeal $4,000,000, and the National Refugee Service,
Inc., $3,100,000. $250,000 was divided equally and presented to Rev.
George A . Buttrick, President of the Federal Council of the Churches of
Christ in America in behalf of Protestant refugees, and to Pope Pius X I I
as a memorial to Pope Pius X I for Catholic refugees.
The agreement for a united appeal was renewed for the year 1940. In­
creased needs resulting from the w ar required a total of $23,000,000.
U nder the initial agreement, of the first $ 11,25 0 ,0 00 , the Joint D istri­
bution Committee received $5,250,000, the United Jew ish Appeal, $2,-
500,000, and the National Refugee Service, $3,500,000. T he allotment com­
mittee decided that of funds raised over the $ 11,25 0 ,0 00 , the J. D . C. was
’ to receive $800,000 for each $400,000 to go to the U nited Palestine Appeal.
The National Refugee Service was to receive no further funds. Approxi­
mately $14,250,000 was raised in all.
The Joint Distribution Committee, chief American agency for aid to dis­
tressed Jew s overseas, announced that it had extended relief activity to Jew s
in more than fifty countries, belligerent and non-belligerent, in 1939 and
1940, and that in fourteen months from the outbreak of the w ar on Septem­
ber 1, 1939 to October 31, 1940, it spent $8,269,247 for a program of relief
and rehabilitation. In Nazi-occupied Poland daily assistance was given to
fully 250,000 Jew ish men, women and children, it was stated.
ORGANIZED JUDAISM 187
In unoccupied France a minimum of 50,000 French, German, Belgian
and Dutch refugees are said to require help, w hile 400,000 Jew s remaining
in the countries of G reater Germany— old Germ any, Austria, Bohemia-
M oravia and Slovakia— have become increasingly dependent on the Com­
mittee.
T he United Palestine Appeal reported that from January, 1939, to D e­
cember, 1940, it helped more than 40,000 refugees reach the shores of Pales­
tine. In September, 1939, when the w ar closed normal shipping lanes, new
routes were opened up through Russia, the Cape of Good Hope, and over­
land through T urkey and Syria. Seven new settlements were established in
1940, bringing to a total of 257 the number of agricultural colonies that
form the backbone of modern Jewish Palestine. T he economic dislocations
of the w ar increased the responsibilities of the agencies of the United Pales­
tine Appeal. N ew industrial enterprises were initiated to provide additional
employment, and relief had to be distributed among 75,000 Jew s affected
by the economic recession of the w ar. N ew markets were developed for
Palestine products.
The work of the National Refugee Service, formed in 1939 to coordinate
on a national scale all services for refugees in the United States, was re­
ported under w elfare organizations, above.

ington Street, Chicago; 140 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio; 4 Park Street, Boston;
307 S. Hill Street, Los Angeles, Calif.; 808 Broadway, Nashville, Tenn.
PURPOSE: to enable the medical missionaries of all Protestant Boards of Missions
to care for and, when possible, to cure lepers.
The Mission is the recognized auxiliary for this special ministry of ail the
Boards, denominational and non-denominational. These Boards, as a rule, make
no appropriation for the maintenance of leper work but rely on the Mission for the
support of their own work of this kind. The service of lepers is equally physical
and spiritual, the two inseparably joined as they were in the life of our Lord. The
missionary leper colonies are Christian communities in which forsaken and lonely
people find the love of Cod through the love of men.

AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY
Founded 1816
For one hundred twenty-five years the American Bible Society
has been the primary agency of the American churches in the
translation, publication and distribution of the Holy Scriptures
throughout America and the world.
In these crucial days mankind desperately needs the positive
answer found in the Book. The American Bible Society appeals
to the churches and individuals of America to make possible the
supply of Bibles, Testaments and Portions not only to the mission­
ary frontiers of the world but also to dislocated multitudes, refugees,
prisoners of war, men under arms and in training camps in this
country.
Further information will gladly be supplied by
THE SECRETARIES

Park Ave. & 57th Street, New York, N. Y.
AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY
Organized 1825
The century-old m issionary agency of the churches for the publica­
tion and distribution of evangelical literature in many languages.
P L E A SE O B SE R V E
That the Society. 116 years old, is now doing more and better work than
for decades and by wise adaptation is now thoroughly abreast with
the times.
That debt-free, its business operations are highly approved with excellent
credit.
That it is the Depository of the ablest and best evangelical literature,
tracts, books and hymnals.
That its new monthly paper TRUTH is unique, virile, dynamic.
That its annuity contract is absolutely reliable and appraised one of the
best issued.
That it is reaching through its English, foreign-language publications
and colporteurs thousands otherwise deprived of the Gospel message.
That it is recognized as the most successful American opponent to
Atheism and other baneful isms.
WILL YOU HELP?
The gifts of churches and individuals, beauests in wills, annuity
agreements are solicited to meet urgent needs and new demands for the
Society’s indispensable service.

BOY SCOUTS OF «MERIC*
Chartered by Congress, June 15, 1916
Scouting offers a program of activity with achievement and recogni­
tion on three age levels. Beginning with Cubbing for boys nine to
twelve, it carries through the period of early adolescence and Troop
Scouting and continues with Senior Scouting for young men in their
late teens and early twenties.
There is no break in the boy’s interest as he passes on from Cub­
bing into Troop Scouting and from Troop Scouting into Senior
Scouting—Sea Scouts, Explorers and Rovers.
The Churches lead all institutions in organizing and adminis­
tering Scout Troops. The Church has more to give in life-time values
than any other type of parent institution. Scout leaders are required
to maintain conditions such that the Church is supported in its efforts
to help the boy to lead a truly religious life.
Consult your local telephone directory for the Boy Scout office
in your city, or write to the Boy Scouts of America, Two Park Ave­
nue, New York City.
