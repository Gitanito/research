Came into a beautiful garden with soft colors


A park in perfect harmony with a blue sky


Summer-like spring


Beautiful building, kind of monastery


Beautiful hallway with huge chandeliers


At the end of the hallway a strong yet soft light


While entering the building I was stopped by three close, yet deceased, relatives


I spoke to the three of them


The last one told me that it was too early to enter


Then came back to the world with beautiful visions.
