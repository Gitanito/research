Christ Enthroned in Man
BY CORA FILLMORE
In the foreword of this book its
author, Cora Dedrick Fillmore, ex
plains that it is to be used as a
companion to THE TWELVE
POWERS OF MAN, by Charles
Fillmore. She says that man uses
but a small part of his innate
capacity of either mind or body,
and she therefore gives exercises
for the purpose of developing and
bringing into action the wonderful
latent possibilities that will cul
minate in a complete union of soul
and body. She gives an outline of
man's twelve powers, and points
out the physical center from
which each power emanates.
First she locates the I AM or
Christ consciousness, saying that
only through this consciousness
can a transformation of the hu
man family be brought about and
a higher type of men and women
come forth. She bids you keep
constantly in mind that you are
a spiritual being, a god in the
making, and states that as you
think more and more of the great
ness of the first great cause you
will behold yourself entering into
the inner kingdom of God.
The author gives much space
to the discussion of the faith fac
ulty, which she asserts is the basis
of all Christian endeavor. She

FOREWORD
These exercises are supplementary to Charles Fill
more's book The Twelve Powers of Man and in
struct the readers of that book how to apply the
principles therein laid down, and how to awaken
within the body, through the action of the mind,
the undeveloped or sleeping faculties.
All students of the body temple agree that we
are using but a small part of its innate capacity. All
students of the mind agree that we are using only
a very, very small portion of our mind power. These
exercises are for the purpose of developing and
bringing into action the wonderful latent possibili
ties, which will ultimate in a complete union of soul
and body. This is the regeneration taught and dem
onstrated by Jesus Christ.
The book The Twelve Powers of Man, by Charles
Fillmore, undoubtedly affords the greatest key to
logical and rational expression of spiritual man that
has ever been given to the public. The adepts of the
Orient have in symbol and secret formula revealed

to students the possibilities of the soul, and how
through years of asceticism and withdrawal from the
practical side of life this superman can be developed.
The advanced scientists of today are recognizing
as fundamental truths that the mind of man ex
presses itself through brain cells and that the brain
cells with their nerve aggregations move the body
and the world without. Sir James Jeans, the eminent
British scientist, says in substance that it may be
that the gods that determine our fate are our own
mind working on our brain cells and through them
on the world about us.
Blind persons who use the Braille system develop
"cells" in their fingertips similar in character to the
white and grey brain cells found in the head, show
ing that the mind does form vehicles through which
it does its intelligent work in the body. So we find
that as the mind incorporates ideas from the one
divine source it enlarges its brain area and gives in
creased mental and spiritual ability to the whole
man.
This process continued will transform every cell
in the organism into brain cells and thus man will

be transformed from flesh and blood into the glory
of radiant mind. As Jesus Christ was transfigured on
the mount before His disciples, so we shall be trans
figured in our high understanding and become mani
fest sons of God.
The evidence of this palpable truth is found on
every side, and is now, in The Twelve Powers of
Man by Mr. Fillmore and in this book of exercises,
being scientifically worked out. The fact is that
the lives of Jesus Christ and the Twelve Apostles
were a symbolical demonstration of the unfoldment
of the twelve faculties of man, which we are inter
preting in terms of physiology and psychology as
co-operating with the supermind or the anointed
of God.
All that is necessary is for the student of this
book to take and apply the word given to the body
centers as directed chapter by chapter. The results
will be a definite transformation of the latent facul
ties dormant in the so-called physical organism.
The body is composed of trillions of cells, waiting
for the mind to stir them into spiritual activity that
they may become obedient servants of Christ.

The twelve powers of man or twelve fundamental
faculties of the mind are represented in the Scrip
tures by the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve apostles
of Jesus, the twelve gates of the Temple, and many
other symbols.
Physiology has located in the body of man twelve
dominant brain or nerve centers that correspond
with the twelve powers or spiritual faculties. The
diagram on the preceding page gives in rough out
line the location of these centers, which may be
designated as follows:
I am —Christ—top brain.
Faith—Peter —center of brain.
Strength
—Andrew —loins.
Wisdom or judgment—James, son of Zebedee—
pit of stomach.
Love—John
—back of heart.

Chrift Enthroned in zJtftan
Chapter I
There
is a great deal of agitation about the de
velopment of the spiritual-minded man and
what goes with that development. The general
and popular idea is that some force outside of man
is going to bring about a new race of men; in other
words, that there is to be a miraculous transforma
tion of the human family, a transformation wrought
by some outer power through which the higher types
of men and women are to come forth.
There is no warrant for this view in the Scriptures
or in the experience of the race. Jesus Christ is
looked upon as the great leader of a new civilization,
and He undoubtedly is. Both Jesus' and John's open
ing declaration was "Repent ye," which means
"Change your mind." So all those who are follow
ing Jesus are finding it necessary gradually to de
velop out of a three-dimension consciousness into a
four-dimension consciousness, and this is really the
transformation named by Jesus "the regeneration."
The exercises in this book show step by step how
to evolve the natural faculties into the spiritual
faculties, and this is what is really meant by salva

tion through Jesus Christ.
In the Resurrection Jesus manifested Himself in
His mental (sometimes called "astral" or psychical)
body, but with the spiritual mind dominant. He
functioned in this psychical realm for forty days be
fore His ascension. Then through the power of His
spiritual nature He raised the psychical body to the
spiritual body, which is indestructible, eternal, omni
present Spirit, one with God. In this experience He
blazed a new trail in the omnipresent ether, of which
we can all take advantage to enter the royal road
that leads to a new spiritual state of consciousness
to be enjoyed here and now.
When we have accomplished the process of spirit
ualizing both soul and body as Jesus accomplished
it,
we shall be with Him in that "place" which He
prepared for us. That "place"
is
properly known as
the kingdom of the heavens;
a
state of mind in
which spirit, soul, and body are one. Let us look to
Jesus as our Way-Shower and Helper.

is

from that still small voice of Spirit within the ad-
monition "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all ye
ends of the earth"; that is to say, "Look to the spir
itual powers within yourself for your real good."
Therefore in all the exercises that follow please keep
constantly in mind that you are a spiritual being, a
god in the making. Let go of all material precon
ceptions of yourself and dwell continually in the
higher dimension, where you see through the eyes
of Spirit, hear with the ears of Spirit, and feel with
the heart of Spirit.
As we acquaint ourselves with the Almighty and
His immutable laws, we think less and less of men
and more and more of the greatness of the first
great cause, which through Jesus Christ is wooing
us to itself. We behold ourselves entering into the
inner kingdom of God, perhaps consciously entering
at a point just back of the heart and stomach. We
see ourselves sitting on a throne and abiding there,
our body consciousness being the prism through
which His image and likeness is projecting itself
more and more into the manifest world.
God, Supreme Being, is the source out of which all
creation evolves. God-Mind is an omnipresent spir
itual realm composed of creative ideas. Through
prayer and spiritual realization man may lay hold

of these ideas, weave them into his soul conscious
ness, and create out of them the ideals of his heart.
The soul is the sum total of man's thoughts, spir
itual and otherwise. Thus man, the masterpiece of
Almightiness, has the power to redeem all error
thinking and through his words to create his own
life, make his own environment. You and I, the
offspring of God-Mind, have the wonderful privi
lege of forming our life of God substance, of instill
ing into our soul and body consciousness the intel
ligence and energy of the Father, and of shaping our
destinies as we will.
The first step after getting the consciousness that
you are a spiritual being in both soul and body is
to realize that the real I am entity within each in
dividual functions continuously in Being. The spir
itual center, the abode of the Christ, is in the crown
of the head; the conscious mind functions through
the front forehead; the center of the subconscious
mind is in the heart and the abdominal region.
First, centering attention in the crown of the head
where man contacts superconscious mind, affirm:
The Christ of God is awakening within me.
As you realize this statement remember that "the
Christ" is the perfect-Son idea, containing all wis
dom and power.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
However it is not wise to concentrate too intensely
at this point more than a moment or two, at least
in the beginning. The power of the word in your
realization contacting the superconscious mind natu
rally causes an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, which
is sometimes manifested in a soft, golden light:
pure intelligence. Please remember that while the
releasing of divine ideas does cause the emanation
of a soft, golden light, the emanation of light is
useful to man only as he allows it to dissolve the
darkness surrounding him and to expand in his con
sciousness as pure intelligence. In some instances
where a great spiritual realization is being released
in consciousness the light is white and dazzling "as
the sun," as recorded in Jesus' experience in the
Transfiguration, in Matthew 17:2.
Now allow this Christ light to drop to the front
forehead, the seat of the conscious mind. Affirm:
/ am aware that the Christ of God is awakening
within me.
At first you may be unaware of the soft, golden
light that is descending from the heavens of your
mind—which is really felt and not seen —but pres
ently you will be able to discern this outpouring as
an illumination that gives you new understanding.
Then allow the Presence, the Christ light, to drop

to the center of the head, the pineal gland. Then
declare:
The Christ of God through faith is awakening
within me.
In all the exercises that follow remember that it
is well for the conscious mind, which functions in
the front forehead, to be awake to all that is going
on and to take cognizance continually of each step
in the spiritual unfoldment.
In this connection also please note that the nose is
a highly sensitive and intelligent organ. It really
symbolizes discernment, and it seems to possess a
keen penetrating ability. Be sure the illumination of
Spirit is penetrating into this organ and that your
discerning powers are quick, keen, energetic.
From that high vantage point, the crown of the
head, you now allow the soft light of Spirit to flow
down, down, penetrating and permeating every
function and cell of soul and body, down even into
the hands and feet. You consciously follow it down
into the feet and even beneath the feet, the heels
especially receiving your attention. Here you dwell
for some time, fully aware of the flow of Spirit as
pure illumination, awakening in you a greater de
gree of intelligence from the crown of the head to
the soles of the feet.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
With your attention centered in the feet, realize
that the windows of your soul are open towards
the heavens of your mind. In the words of Ella
Wheeler Wilcox,
"Let there be many windows to your soul,
That all the glory of the universe
May beautify it. Not the narrow pane
Of one poor creed can catch the radiant rays
That shine from countless sources. Tear away
The blinds of superstition; let the light
Pour through fair windows broad as Truth itself,
And high as God."
Then know that you are saturated in this holy
light, the light of divine intelligence, and that you
are even wrapped about in
it,
as in
a
mantle, from
head to feet. This outpouring
is
known as the de
scending spiritual current.
By this time you will have discovered that there
is
also an ascending current coming up from the
earth. In its original essence this ascending current
was pure substance of Spirit; now however
it
is
tinctured with the race thought that each person
must handle.
It
offers much protection
if
you realize
continually that the descending current of Spirit
does make its way entirely through the body temple
;
that in fact we live in
it,
move in
it,
and have our

being in
it,
and that
it
extends beneath the feet; that
it
contacts the ascending current at various points and
tempers and harmonizes all the undisciplined race
thoughts of hate, fear, jealousy, lack, and the like.
Practice of control of these forces will give you an
insight into the truth that you have the power to
use every problem in which you are involved as
a
steppingstone to higher achievements. The descend
ing spiritual current and the ascending earthly cur
rent, contacting each other at. different points in soul
and body consciousness, form centers of conscious
ness, the most important being those in the region
of the heart and stomach; and another being the
center at the base of the brain, the medulla, the
zeal center. Minor points of contact are located at
other centers that are the seat of the different facul
ties or powers of man.
The activity of divine intelligence in the spiritual
flow from above transforms the error beliefs of the
race contained in the earthly flow from beneath into
constructive forces, and at the same time gives the
individual
a
richer and broader understanding of life
in the manifest realm.
The now transformed constructive flow from be
neath continues its upward course however, con
tinually contacting the never-ceasing spiritual flow

from above. Now consciously you ascend with this
upward current to the point that we have already
designated as the great distributing nerve center
back of heart and stomach.
You will find that at this point you have a firm
grip on the power of the word and that the Christ
is setting up a throne of dominion here. In truth this
is the point where the Lord's body begins to become
manifest (Bethlehem, "house of bread"). Dwelling
consciously here, call down from the heavens of your
mind all the powers: faith, strength, wisdom, love,
and so forth. Realize or affirm that these twelve
powers (perfect ideas in God-Mind) are entering the
soul consciousness and are organizing themselves as
substance at the very center of being. Then realize
that their substance is being established in the breast
and through the whole soul and body being. You are
thus laying the foundation of the new Christ body or
temple of God, with its twelve precious stones which
represent the intellectual perception of man's Spirit
ual body. At this point affirm and realize this invo
cation:

in the Holy Spirit of life, love, and wisdom. I ac

bring my world into manifestation according to Thy
perfect law.
After you have repeated this invocation continue
to reali2e that you are in the presence of the sub
stance of pure Being and that you are immersed in
the light of Being; that this light from on high
saturates you from the crown of your head to the
soles of your feet.
Then in order that you may receive an even
greater outpouring of the Holy Spirit, repeat the
Lord's Prayer as follows:
"Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread:
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven
our debtors.
And leave us not in temptation, but deliver us
from evil:
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory, for ever. Amen!"
These words of Jesus' connect the soul directly
with the celestial realm. With the Holy Spirit para

you discern that you dwell consciously in your
physical body, your soul body, and your spiritual
body; that these three bodies must be merged in
one in order to bring into manifestation that im
perishable body which was demonstrated by Jesus
Christ.
In conclusion, resolve that from this time on you
are conscious of your I am power and dominion,
that henceforth you will consciously direct your
life in the light of Spirit, that your heart and your
head are working together in all wisdom and power.
You will perceive by this time that you are gaining
a firmer grip on the power of the word in the
palms of your hands and in the soles of your feet
between the ball of the foot and the heel. This
tends to place you on a firm foundation and to give
you a greater consciousness of the unfolding proc
esses going on during the rearing of the permanent
dwelling place of Spirit.
Man is indeed the masterpiece of Almightiness.
With the throne of the Lord set up in the heart of
his being, with the mantle of the Holy Spirit
wrapped about him, and consciously working with
the one creative power of the universe, he is free to
build for himself not only a perfect soul but also
an indestructible body temple.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
"Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed
me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall
sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or
sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands,
for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold,
and shall inherit eternal life."
As the marsh-hen secretly builds on the watery sod,
Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of
God. —hauler.
(Note: In classwork, when meeting once a week, the
group should spend about four weeks on each chapter of
The Twelve Powers of Man, by Charles Fillmore. This
exercise should be used with the first chapter and be re
peated at each meeting during the month.)

Chapter II
Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees
And rests on that alone;
Laughs at impossibilities,
And says it shall be done.
—Charles Wesley.
Faith
is; it is an attribute of God. Faith is
purely spiritual; it knows nothing less than
supreme assurance. Faith is dauntless; it knows
no defeat. Faith is the quality of the mind that moves
and molds ideas and brings them to concrete ex
pression. Faith is the assurance or confidence of the
mind that invisible substance is the source of visible
material things. Modern science says that the cosmic
ether is the mother of matter. Metaphysically we
find that the cosmic ether is the light that the mind
expresses when it holds to a definite idea. "By
faith we understand that the worlds have been
framed by the word of God, so that what is seen
hath not been made out of things which appear."

and shed their warmth and glow in the dark, damp

corners of the earth, so faith creeps through the
dark, tangled meshes of human thought and radiates
its strength and hope and courage.
Faith enables man to see true conditions as they
are in the realm of reality. The basis of all Christian
endeavor is faith. Without this vital factor Chris
tianity is neither stable nor scientific. Faith enables
man to see through the shadowy forms of false
concepts
—the creations of the natural man —and
behold the real. Faith is the key that unlocks the
door to the kingdom of the heavens; looking
through the eyes of faith we behold man as the
prism through which Divine Mind is endeavoring
to flash into expression its perfect creation.
God lives in each heart, and he who consciously
dwells in the secret of His presence comes into an
understanding of the creative powers of the universe.
Into this "secret place of the Most High" no thought
of disease or destruction can enter. Here the healing,
soothing balm of divine faith pours itself out, seek
ing to expand and to enlarge and make alive God's
perfection in the whole consciousness. It even pene
trates into the environment, bearing everywhere a
sustaining trust that never wavers, never grows less,
making the whole scheme of life one unbroken
story of happiness, of joy, of love and abundance

for all those who bathe in its light and bask in its
warmth and beauty.
It is the constant mingling and intermingling of
the conscious intelligence with faith that establishes
the healing consciousness in man. This conscious
ness, built on the rock of faith, becomes more and
more fearless and free, and finally comes forward
and says, "Behold, I am the Word made flesh. No
task is too hard for me."
Our true ideas are always from God. The yearn
ing desire of these divine ideas in the heart causes
mind action, and through this movement the divine
ideas are born by faith into consciousness and pro
duce thought. Thus the faith consciousness, once
established, is constantly fed from the very fount
of faith and grows stronger and stronger continu
ally. God is the one source, and the knowledge
that God is all and that all things not made by
Him are unreal fills one who is working from prin
ciple with an immeasurable assurance past descrip
tion. It gives him the firm conviction that all con
ditions of mind and body are his to conquer through
Christ.
Faith works on and on and on after reason is all
exhausted. When set into activity according to law

Being and create just what is needed to perfect the
desired demonstration. Let us work to attain the
faith vision that gives us the true prospectus of the
realm of reality.
To illustrate how faith through Jesus Christ is
called into spiritual action, picture a beautiful city,
a city where there is no night. From out the heart
of the city flows a wonderful river whose water is
clear as crystal; on the banks of the water is the
tree of life bearing twelve manner of fruit every
month. However this beautiful city is encompassed
by a high, thick stone wall. There are no open
ings, and you are on the outside and wish to enter.
The wall is so high that you cannot climb over it.
The only way for you to gain entrance is to work
your way through the rock. As you walk around the
wall meditating upon the situation and wondering
just how to begin, suddenly you come to a hole in
the wall where another has made his way in before
you. Your way is made easy through the efforts
of this pioneer who has dared to cut a way through
the thick, dense wall of materiality.
This picture illustrates the work that Jesus Christ
has accomplished for you and for me in the devel
opment of faith in God. The beautiful city repre

soul; the river represents the river of life; and the
twelve different kinds of fruit symbolize the fruit
of Spirit, the twelve fundamental faculties in man,
represented in the life of Jesus by the Twelve
Apostles.
Through faith in Jesus Christ we may enter into
the spiritual kingdom and begin mentally to lay
hold of our good. The one who has unfolded un
wavering faith in God has unlimited power. Jesus
was conscious of this wonderful power when He
said, "Lazarus, come forth," even though Lazarus
had lain in the tomb for four days. Jesus advised,
recommended, even commanded that we unfold
this wonderful faculty, an enduring power that
never grows less. True faith can only be known to
the practical Christian. In its spiritual reality it is
beyond the comprehension of the artistry of poetical
words. Spiritually faith is a dynamic force that can
only be described in scientific terms by seers and
sages. It is one of the fundamental laws governing
man and the universe and is directly related to the
underlying substance of the universe. The definition
of faith in Hebrews, "Faith is the substance of
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,"
is a true statement.

have them."
"According to your faith be it done unto you."
"Thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."
"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to
yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing
shall be impossible unto you."
These are all golden truths given for our use.
At the center of the brain is the pineal gland.
This gland is known to Truth students as the faith
center, symbolized by Jesus' disciple Peter, and
faith is the "rock" upon which He founded His
church. When the inner eye is illumined with spir
itual faith, a ray of light—the pure white, pearly
light of Spirit—steady and unwavering, is often seen
in the silence. So unfaltering and resolute is this ray
of the spiritual light of faith that it seems as un-
movable as a star in the heavens. However it is
only a mere symbol letting us know that the spiritual
work has been done.
The exercises given herewith are for the purpose
of illumining man's consciousness until he realizes
that he has penetrated into the four-dimensional
realm, the kingdom of the heavens that Jesus taught
was within the soul.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
For the beginning of this exercise repeat the whole
of the "I am" exercise given in Chapter I. With the
attention still at the great nerve center, take up next
the thought of infinite faith. Affirm:
Through Jesus Christ the faith of almighty God is
quickened within me.
After you have gained a good realization of Omni
presence as faith, follow the radiance of Spirit that
leads to the faith center, the pineal gland, at the
middle of the head; then realize this same prayer:
Through Jesus Christ the faith of almighty God is
quickened within me.
Be perfectly relaxed and receptive to Spirit, and
know that you are conscious of the spiritual power
descending from the spiritual center, the crown of
the head, showering you with new faith.
The tiny ray of pure light that is often discern
ible in the silence at the faith center is simply a
result of the radiation or vibration of the word of
faith upon which you are concentrating. When the
power of the word reaches a certain degree of in
tensity, the light of faith becomes visible. Do not
try to perceive this ray; by so doing you hinder
your own unfoldment. Do the spiritual work quietly,
remaining perfectly poised and relaxed. The Lord
will take care of the results. Now (with you work

allow the Presence to drop slowly
down to the love center just back of the heart, and
declare:
Faith works through love.
Then allow the Presence, the light of Spirit, to
drop down into the soles of the feet, and repeat
this declaration:
Understanding faith
is
now expressed through me.
At the conclusion of the exercise, allow the Pres
ence (while you continue to co-operate) to organize
itself just back of the heart and stomach. Again
realize: Faith works through love. During this
realization consciously know that the windows of
your soul are open toward the heavens of your
mind, that the spiritual light as pure illumination
is
descending upon you, and that through faith you
are steadily developing the Lord's body. End the
exercise first with
a
realization of infinite love;
then finish with the Lord's Prayer.
You will remember that the instructions in Chap
ter
I
are to keep the conscious mind, which operates
through the front forehead, always fully aware of
all that
is
taking place. Therefore after you have
finished be sure that the conscious mind
is

it
has perceived clearly
every step of the way. At the close of the exercise,

for the sake of balance, it is well to dwell con
sciously in the feet and even beneath the feet; also
to throw the attention down into the palms of the
hands, realizing that faith must always be accom
panied with works, that nothing is yours unless
you express it.
This being true, at the close of this exercise (also
at the close of all the other exercises that follow),
as you go forth to associate with your fellow men,
know that your new realizations are freely finding
expression in and through you, especially through
the breast; the vital center of expression being at the
point in the thorax, the lower part of the sternum,
where the last of the true ribs are attached to the
sternum. Also realize that your words are growing
in power and intelligence and that you are strength
ening a center of expression at that point where
the upper lip is joined onto the base of the nose.
By recognizing this, you will find that your voice
will develop a richness and trueness that you as
well as your friends will appreciate. Also know that
a new light (illumination) is penetrating the seat of
the conscious mind (front forehead) and that even
your brow radiates the light of Spirit.

he realization of the Jesus Christ presence
as sustaining strength is a stronghold in the
consciousness of man that fortifies him against
all adverse conditions. Nothing so uplifts, nothing
so frees from care and worry, nothing so brings the
thought of victory as being established in that sus
taining strength which cannot know weakness. To
have the strength of character that makes life seem
effortless, nonresistant, is to have the inward joy
that no man can take away.
When Jesus withstood the temptation in the wil
derness He proved beyond all question that He pos
sessed the strength of character that the Almighty
required of Him. Man today is working for this
same unfoldment. For him to be established in the
consciousness of sustaining strength means that he
has overcome as Jesus Christ overcame; perhaps not
to so great a degree; nevertheless the joy of the
overcomer is his. When man holds his ground in
the face of temptation and refuses to yield to the
allurements of the world or of sense consciousness,
no doubt the very angels shout for joy. True strength

any guise; all shafts of error directed its way meet
with defeat.
Among the apostles of Jesus Christ Andrew sym
bolizes strength. The strength center in man is in the
small of the back. Spiritual strength, the fruit of
prayer and of meditating on strength, is born in the
silence of the soul and reflected into the body at
the strength center.
The eagle is the symbol of strength and victory.
Solomon, meditating on the marvelous outworking
of God's unbreakable laws, said that one of the
things "which are too wonderful for me" was "the
way of an eagle in the air." The eagle is the ex
pression of abounding strength. He mounts up into
the air to an unbelievable height and from this
altitude focuses his eye on the ground below and
spots his prey. He rises above the cyclone; he out-
flies the wind. As is the way of an eagle in the air,
so is the way of man when he fully realizes his
divine sonship. The man who deems himself to be
finite, to be apart from the Infinite, cannot know
of the possibilities of spiritual man; cannot dream
of the possibilities of spiritual man.

festation is according to the mold of thought into
which this precious essence is poured. Often man
appropriates and tries to use spiritual strength in
worldly ways. This always leads to failure. In the
17th chapter of Ezekiel Jehovah presents a riddle
to the house of Israel. An eagle with great wings
and long pinions, full of feathers, evidently from
Babylon, comes unto Lebanon, takes away the top
of a cedar, cuts off the topmost of the young twigs,
and carries the cedar top to a land of traffic, to a
city of merchants; he also takes good seed from the
land and plants it in fruitful soil, beside many
waters. The growth that springs from this planting
is of low stature, the branches turn toward the eagle,
and the roots are under him.
The solution of the riddle is that the eagle of
Babylon that comes to Lebanon is an organized
aggregation of strong, selfish, worldly thoughts,
intent on trafficking in spiritual powers. The scheme
proves a failure. Spiritual unfoldment is attained
by each individual soul's establishing conscious at-
one-ment with the Jehovah mind through Jesus
Christ. Therefore it cannot be bought or stolen;
the unbreakable laws of the Infinite insure against
all such attempts.

strong. One must withstand every test. Spirit's sym
bol of vigor, success, and victory is the garb of joy.
We are joyous only when we are strong physically,
mentally, spiritually. It is said that actors have been
killed by having criticism, often of an unjust char
acter, hurled at them. Their need was for the un-
foldment of a strength of character that can handle
prejudices and jealousies without resistance. If such
souls had been versed in present-day metaphysical
teachings, they would have known that Truth needs
no defense; they would have known how to wrap
themselves about in the protecting mantle of the
Lord; how to rest quietly under the shadow of the
Almighty during an onslaught; how to emerge
strong and joyous after attack has spent its fury; and
how to live life so that criticism may seem only a jest.
In Ecclesiastes, the 12th chapter, a sorrowful pic
ture is drawn of man so weakened by evil that life
is a burden. His senses all buried in darkness, man
is ready to welcome death; he is waiting for the
"silver cord" to be loosed and the "golden bowl" to
be broken so that he can hide himself in the grave.
The "silver cord" here referred to may be com
pared to the spinal cord, that runs along the inner
walls of the spinal column; the "golden bowl" is

and "the golden bowl" is broken, death results.
Death has no part in the life of the real man.
His senses are keen and illumined. The ever-unfold
ing, ever-renewing Spirit of infinite strength sus
tains him, and he goes from glory to glory. Realiza
tion of spiritual strength at the strength center, the
small of the back, acts as an invigorating tonic to the
"silver cord." Spiritual strength flows freely along
the nerves and penetrates into every cell and fiber

For the exercise in the silence, first follow dili

Realize that you are in the presence of pure Being

press fully the Christ of God.
Next, for the special unfoldment of spiritual

to dwell at the center of your being. Then affirm :
7 am one with infinite strength.
Next allow the Presence to drop to the small of
the back and realize that the light of Spirit—which

strength center. During this outpouring hold steadily
to this thought:

Now allow the Presence to descend to the life
center, the lower part of the abdomen. There affirm:

The joy of the Lord is a wellspring within me,
and I am established in divine strength.
Dwell consciously at that point, knowing that
you are firmly established in the garden of spirit
uality within your own soul, that the light of Spirit
is descending from the spiritual center, the crown

Chrift Enthroned in n^ftan
Chapter IV
C£ A aron shall bear the judgment of the chil-
t-\ dren of Israel upon his heart before Jeho-
vah continually." Moses, the lawgiver,
represents the faculty within us that reveals the law
that guides and directs our real thoughts ("children
of Israel") in the unfoldment of our faculties. Aaron
was a brother of Moses and his spokesman. He
symbolizes the power within us that sets the law into
action and that also takes cognizance of the results
produced. The power by which we are justified or
condemned is within us. Understanding this power,
we see that the kingdom of the heavens is all about
us, above us, beneath us, within us; that God is in
His kingdom, and that every event of life is stamped
with the judgment of God.
Logic and reason prove that every event of life
bears the stamp of the judgment of the Almighty,
regardless of what construction a judge of man-
made law may place upon it. For a time this may
seem untrue, but when the whole proposition has
been thoroughly sifted, the conclusion will be found
to bear the stamp of the judgment of God.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
When a person is faced with stupendous issues,
when he sees that only the wisdom and the judg
ment of God can save the day, he is likely to become
very meek and lowly and to seek earnestly for the
inner light.
When Solomon was a young man he was selected
king by his father David. Solomon's quick discern
ment revealed to him the whole situation just as
it was. He was inexperienced and untried. His elder
half brothers looked upon him as a hindrance to
their progress. Any one of them would have relieved
him of his kingdom had an opportunity to do so
presented itself. Their personal interest was in
volved; therefore they watched Solomon's every
move, hoping he might make some mistake that
they could use to rouse the people against him.
But Solomon knew that the Lord, through David
his father, had chosen him king. With this convic
tion in his mind he felt that he was on a firm foun
dation ; he was not to be driven about by misgivings
and fear. With deep concern but with peaceful
heart he turned to question the Helper within.
On one occasion, as he earnestly endeavored to
make the inner union with that spiritual wisdom
which he instinctively felt was waiting to be called
into activity, the calm assurance of Spirit gained

the ascendancy within his soul and he fell asleep.
Then in a dream the Lord appeared unto him and
told him that he could have whatsoever he asked.
Solomon said:
"And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made
thy servant king instead of David my father: and I
am but a little child. I know not how to go out or
come in. And thy servant is in the midst of thy
people which thou hast chosen, a great people,
that cannot be counted nor numbered for multitude.
Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart
to judge thy people, that I may discern between good
and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great
people?"
In this prayer Solomon dedicated himself to the
service of the Lord and laid upon the altar all his
powers, all his possibilities, waiting for the judg
ment of God to be stamped upon him. Because of
his unselfish choice, not only was his desire granted
but riches and honor and long life were assured
him by the Lord. When we are able to delve into
the cause of things, we read out of the law the
judgment of God that the Aaron faculty bears
"upon his heart before Jehovah continually."
By reviewing Solomon's wonderful career as a
ruler we can better understand the breadth and

depth and strength of the spiritual realization in
this prayer, and know better to what degree he was
able to let the spiritual powers work and act through
him. In its original impetus every event of life is
stamped with the judgment of God.
Solomon was made strong by test and trial.
Each of our faculties is brought forth by use and
by tests of our strength. As sons of God we must
master every mortal limitation. It is spiritual judg
ment co-operating with the power of Spirit within
us that says: "He that overcometh, I will give to
him to sit down with me in my throne." In order
even to approach the divine throne, we must have
power to judge aright every impulse that arises
within the human heart, to judge aright the in
tense desire back of seeming appetite and passion,
and our spiritual faculties must also be strength
ened by use and tested by trials until we are ac
counted safe and sure by the great Judge of all ; until
the Aaron faculty bears the message to Jehovah
"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
So let us rid our mind of man-made standards of
judgment and seek the inner wisdom that reveals
that life is indeed a scientific proposition, the object
of which is to bring forth the divine qualities of the
superman.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
One meaning of the word Solomon is "peace."
It is said that when this wise king was approaching
even his most strenuous tests, he was the personifi
cation of peace. Perfect peace is always a fore
runner of victory.
Every soul has free access to the source of wis
dom within. As we approach the divine source of
wisdom and begin to realize our oneness with
it,
we
find that we are evolving a higher intelligence than
that of the intellect and that we are learning the
greatest of all sciences, the science of mind. We find
that the primal principles of Being are pure ideas
and that these ideas express themselves in pure
words and thoughts. Divine wisdom, divine judg
ment, has in
it
the essence of goodness. When we
really live in perfect relation to principle, we shall
have the power to combine ideas rightly and so
manifest wholeness and perfection in mind and in
body.
In all wisdom man must consciously possess his
body. In fact, he must not only consciously but also
subconsciously possess his body. This ability
is
at
tained through the wise development of the twelve
spiritual faculties.
For the exercise in the silence, first take up the

God is the name of the everywhere present wis

vine wisdom is awakened in me and I love to ex
press divine judgment.
Hold this statement until the whole being is illu

The great positive and the great negative at the
center of our being are wisdom (judgment), at the
pit of the stomach, and love, in the heart. In the
development of the twelve powers these faculties
are paramount; they are closely related and work
together in producing the strongest vibrations known
to the body. Jesus called James and John "Sons of
thunder," a title symbolizing the powerful vibra
tions produced by these faculties. Wisdom is a
great dynamic force that carries its power to the love
center. In the action and reaction between these two
centers we get our greatest realizations and most
wonderful spiritual radiations. Wisdom and love,
when combined, produce peace and poise, a great
dynamic spiritual center symbolized by the city of
Jerusalem.

God has not given me the spirit of fear, but of
power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
Then allow the Presence to enter the love center,
the heart itself, and declare:
/ love to express the wisdom of God. My heart
beats in perfect accord with the great loving heart
of God. I gladly put on the breastplate of peace,
poise, and power.
Next allow the Presence to return to the great
solar nerve center, and repeat the Lord's Prayer.
After you have finished this exercise it is often
good to realize and affirm that your conscious mind
is aware of the spiritual process going on. Then let
the Presence drop down into the feet. Here realize
that you are clothed in perfect understanding and
peace.
As previously stated, these exercises are not to be
pushed but used with discrimination.

Chrift Snthroned in oJfytan
Chapter V
Jesus
Christ was
a
carpenter. His mission on
earth was to construct
a
spiritual body temple,
to unfold
a
spiritual soul, and to teach men the
spiritual laws involved, in order that they might
follow Him.
We are apprentices in Jesus Christ's workshop.
Every day we are working to unfold soul qualities
like those expressed
by
the Master; soul qualities
that make us always lovable, strong, pure, and per
fect. We know that the body
is
the fruit of the soul
and that as we unfold spiritual qualities within the
soul, the body goes through
a
process of refining,
of upliftment. This process must continue until we
demonstrate bodies fashioned after the pattern of
His glorious body.
In this lesson we take up the thought of divine
love. In the spiritual body the love center
is
the
heart, symbolized
by
Jesus' disciple John. John loved
the Master. During Jesus' journeys with His dis
ciples through Palestine John was almost contin
ually
by
the Master's side. Even when Jesus was
crucified and all the other disciples fled, John was

not far from the Master. While John was an exile
on the island of Patmos, he was "in the Spirit on
the Lord's day" and was lifted up in consciousness
until he beheld a vision of the perfect man Jesus
Christ in all His glory. Thus love beholds the trans
forming, uplifting power of the Christ.
Love, the attribute symbolized by the disciple
John, holds soul and body together. Love is the at
tractive force that draws our good to us according to
the depth and strength of our realization of love.
A number of years ago I went into the foothills
of the Ozarks on a vacation. I stayed in a wonderful
little home near a forest. The hearts of the people
who dwelt in this home were filled with love for
the birds, the squirrels, and all the other creatures of
the forest. They called the creatures "the little people
of the forest" and were continually trying to win
their friendship. It was a source of pleasure to these
people to give food and shelter to "the little people
of the forest"; such action dissolves any tendency
toward personal selfishness. They built birdhouses,
and they put out food and water even in summer
time. They won the confidence of a redbird. First
he flew down onto the porch and ate the crumbs
placed there; then he came to the open doorway
for food, and finally he came stepping into the

kitchen. His visits were a joy to all the household.
I believe that in befriending the forest creatures
these people were unfolding the faculty of un
selfish love, which is of far more value in soul
unfoldment than a course in the best college.
Just as these gentle people won the hearts of the
forest birds, so God must win our heart. But we
must know what God is before we can love Him.
The path that leads to true soul unfoldment leads to
adoration of the great cause of all. We learn to
adore God when we find that He is a God of love,
willing to pour out His good upon us and to be
friend us in every way. Just as the confidence of
the wild creatures of the forest is won through
love, so God through love is gently wooing us.
God does not force or suppress the wild, unculti
vated forces within the heart, but He gently opens
avenues through which these forces may express
themselves constructively.
Let us bless the parents of the present day who
love their children wisely and who are not sup
pressing them or trying to force them into a cer
tain mold, but are allowing them to be guided and
directed by the indwelling Christ. Many persons
today, as a result of being forced or suppressed in
their youth, have hard, unyielding places in the

subconscious mind that do not give up readily to the
power of the word. Our heart must be won for God.
This winning is easy when we learn to know God as
Spirit. All the wild uncultivated forces in us must
be won for God, but they must be won under the
law of love. The rushing, jostling life of today for
gets love. Let us remember love. Let us endeavor
always to cultivate this wonderful faculty. Just as
John radiated love, so let us radiate it. Let us feel
the warm love of Jesus Christ in our heart. Let us
realize love and send out thoughts of love until
we are lifted above all thought of materiality.
In a magazine some years ago there was an ar
ticle in which the author stated that the actors in
the movies of that day often employed music to
awaken their inner powers before appearing before
the camera. Each had the music that he loved
best: Thomas Meighan would have nothing but
Irish jigs; Will Rogers listened to ukulele music;
Pauline Frederick used but one tune, "Rockaby
Baby"; Irene Rich listened to Scotch ballads played
on the violin. Often these persons had to wait for
hours in their make-up before they were called on
for their parts, but each one knew how to arouse his
emotional nature by listening to the music that he
loved best.

The music that we love best is the joyous, triumph
ant voice of the Christ singing through the inner
recesses of our soul. The loving voice of the Christ
awakens in us the spiritual powers that strengthen,
uplift, and redeem.
For the exercise in the silence first follow the out
line given in Chapter I. Repeating the Lord's Prayer,
with the presence of the Holy Spirit at the great
nerve center back of the heart and stomach, give the
indwelling Christ opportunity to command, through
love, the twelve faculties and to direct them in re
generative processes. Then continuing to dwell at
the point designated, take up this thought:
I have faith in the supreme power of love.
Love and wisdom always should go hand in hand.
Next allow the light of Spirit to descend into the
heart and then to the pit of the stomach, at the
wisdom center. At each point hold this thought:
Divine love and wisdom are united in me. I will
sing of loving-kindness and of justice.
Then allow the Presence to descend into the re
nunciation center, lower end of spinal column. Here
hold this thought:
The forgiving love of Jesus Christ cleanses, puri
fies, and redeems me.

realize that the law of love is written in your heart.
Try to imagine the deep, tender love of the Almighty
that must have filled the heart of Jesus when He
said, "I and the Father are one." Realize that in
spirit, soul, and body you are made perfect through
the power of divine love.
But always bear in mind that love and wisdom
must find expression through the conscious mind.
With the I am expressing itself at the point desig
nated as the solar nerve center, and realizing that
all the windows of your soul are open toward the

love of God in all your ways ; and that your spiritual
realizations shine out through your eyes and express
themselves in your voice. Close the exercise with
the Lord's Prayer, the attention being still kept at
the point designated as the great solar nerve center.

but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or

Chriff Enthroned in zTiftdn
Chapter VI
Jesus
Christ promised that we shall receive
power when the Holy Spirit comes upon us.
The Holy Spirit
is
God in action. Since the
activity of Spirit gives us power, we must logi
cally conclude that power is
a
force generated from
God through the activity of man's words and
thoughts. We receive added power when we set
into action deeper realizations of the love, the wis
dom, the strength, the life, and the zeal of the Al
mighty. Imagine
if
you can the powerful activity
of these God attributes in all the disciples of Jesus
who were gathered in Jerusalem on the day of
Pentecost,
a
few weeks after the Ascension.
"And when the day of Pentecost was now come,
they were all together in one place. And suddenly
there came from heaven
a
sound as of the rushing
of
a
mighty wind, and
it
filled all the house where
they were sitting. And there appeared unto them
tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and
it
sat
upon each one of them. And they were all filled with
the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other
tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
The expression of power in man is regulated by
his thought and his word. Jesus' apostle Philip
symbolizes power. Power expresses itself through
soul and body at the point in the throat where the
hyoglossus muscle is located.
Christian metaphysicians call this place in the
throat the power center. Power operates through
the nerve aggregations in the throat that control
the larynx. The larynx is symbolized in Scripture by
Galilee. Also the ductless gland known as the thy
roid is directly connected with the power center.
The power center may be compared to the ampli
fying or stepping-up device of the radio. The audio
amplifier in a receiving set simply increases the
power of the voice of the singer or speaker until
his words may be heard at great distances. In man's
organism the life current is harnessed by the power
center, where it comes under the control of the I am
and is spoken into expression or is intelligently di
rected to its work in soul and body.
The thyroid gland placed across the front of the
throat was the first of the ductiess glands to yield
its secret to science. By allowing the Presence, the
light of Spirit descending from the spiritual cen
ter, the crown of the head, to organize itself at the
thyroid gland (including the very base of the neck) ,

and then realizing that the all-knowing power of
the word of God is poured out from on high at
these points, the working intelligence of the word is
so greatly enhanced that the whole being becomes
illumined; added power and control are felt through
out the whole body temple.
However, such an exercise should not be of long
duration, at least before one is well developed in
the art of calling the disciples; ajd it should always
be taken in connection with the thought of unselfish
love. Otherwise the personal ego tries to use the
added power for its own glorification, which leads
to defeat.
In Jesus' healing ministry He proved that there
is a law back of and within all mind action and that
intelligent co-operation with that law gives mas
tery and dominion. He knew this so well that His
words brought forth instant results. He turned
water into wine, He raised the dead and cast out
demons. All those who seek spiritual healing and
illumination need this dominion over life action.
Since the power idea equalizes and controls the life
energy in soul and in body, we see that power is a
branch of the tree of life.
There is no reason why we today should not re
ceive such an outpouring of the Holy Spirit as was

received by those gathered in Jerusalem on the day
of Pentecost —if we have power to draw close
enough to God in consciousness to receive the
blessing. Consciously and subconsciously we are
becoming aware that the activity of the Holy Spirit
is governed by law; and that this law exists in
Being; that it is as exact and harmonious as the
law that governs a musical production; and that it
is as undeviating as the progressive steps one must
take in solving a mathematical problem. God is
the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jesus Christ's
consciousness was an instrument through which
God's laws operated during Jesus Christ's earthly
ministry. Man's consciousness is the channel through
which God's laws find expression; therefore we
can readily see that demonstration rests with us.
We can become instruments through which the Holy
Spirit expresses itself as it expressed itself through
Jesus' apostles on the day of Pentecost.
Since man came to dwell on the earth he has
worked continually for power, dominion, mastery;
his influence is felt in all earthly conditions. The
conclusion of those who have carefully studied the
matter is that aeons ago the earth was a wild and
stormy place, a place of chaos, because it lacked
man's controlling influence. When man appeared

the turbulent conditions were gradually modified.
The unfolding of spiritual power reminds one of
Benjamin Franklin's experiences with atmospheric
electricity in what are known as his kite experiments.
He believed that lightning would be a constructive
power when controlled. He made a kite that would
fly
in rainy weather. As paper would not do, he
made the kite of
a
silk handkerchief. He attached
a
bit of sharp-pointed wire to the head of the kite
to serve as the upper terminus of what
is
now known
as
a
lightning rod. To the lower end of the long kite
string he tied
a
key. He knew that silk
is
a
non
conductor of electricity; therefore he tied
a
silk
cord to the string
by
which to hold it. During
a
big
electric storm Franklin sent his kite sailing up
among the clouds. He stuck the key into
a
Leyden
jar and awaited results. When he thought the key
had had time to be charged with the electricity de
scending from the heavens along the kite string,
he applied his knuckles to the key. There was
a
spark, really
a
little flash of lightning. The lightning
was transmitted to the jar and the jar was charged
with electricity.

power in his lofty realization of omnipotent wis

Commandments and registered them on two tables
of stone. But Jesus Christ was the finished work
man in the Lord's workshop. He could make perfect
union with omnipresent energy and intelligence and
thus receive great and glorious truths. His words
were as lightning. He was illumined with light from
on high. He said: "As the lightning cometh forth
from the east, and is seen even unto the west; so
shall be the coming of the Son of man." Just as
Benjamin Franklin harnessed the lightning, just as
Moses used Omnipresence in receiving the Ten
Commandments, so we through Jesus Christ are
learning to use the attributes of God in our every
day life.
Our aim in life should be to grow by unfolding
the power of the living word. In order to do this
we must watch our words, and above all watch our
thoughts. If we are careful to keep our thoughts
right with God, we shall easily speak the right
words. We should be truthful, for even little false
hoods hinder spiritual growth. On all occasions we
must hew to the line no matter where the chips
fall. We must also be careful that we do not do all
the talking but give God a chance to talk to us.

the great solar nerve center, affirm:
All power is given unto me in mind and in body.
Then allow the Presence to ascend to the base of

divine love. Dedicate your realization of power to
the loving service of the Lord. Holding the atten

named the great solar nerve center and affirm:
I am established in the peace, poise, power, and
dominion of God. The Father in me is doing His
work in love and in wisdom, and I rejoice in the
fullness of my good.
Close the drill by softly repeating the Lord's
Prayer. During the whole drill be sure that the
conscious mind in the front forehead is aware of
the new power that you are generating. This tends
to remold your perceptive powers more and more
after the divine pattern. After the exercise sit for a
few moments first with the attention in the palms
of the hands and fingertips and then in the feet and
beneath the feet.
May the word work mightily in you.

Chapter VII
ivine imagination is the chisel man wields in
molding the paradise of his inner thought
kingdom. While in the silence, therefore,
the thought forms he permits to be imaged in his
consciousness have as great an effect on his life as
his spiritual realizations. Intelligent seeing is a form
of divine imagination; man should behold himself
in a state of keen, intelligent knowing always. He
should see God, good, as the foundation on which
his life is builded; he should see God, good, as
the source of his life, and he should see himself
majestically springing from that source.
It is through divine imagination that the soul first
gets the impulse to expand. In the silence man learns
to lift the vision above things as they commonly
appear, and this aids much in bringing all the other
faculties "into captivity to the obedience of Christ."
Thus man learns to acquaint himself with God and
with God's world of reality. Divine imagination,
working in consciousness, sees the kingdom of the
heavens fashioned after the divine pattern shown
on the mount of high spiritual illumination.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
Under the old form of religion imagination
played an important part in picturing the result of
sin, of missing the mark. Unsaved souls were sup
posed to be thrown into a boiling lake of brimstone,
where they must burn forever. As man has evolved
spiritually he has come to understand the absurdity
of such a thing. Spirituality is an unfoldment that
the student acquires just as one develops one's mu
sical talent. Patient practice brings forth the fin
ished product. Just as an earthly father would not
buy a piano and say to the child, "Now play, but if
you make an error you are eternally damned,"
neither would the heavenly Father create a family
and put them in a garden full of untried forces,
and say, "Now these powers are yours to use. Go
ahead and use them, but if you make a misstroke,
you must suffer eternally for it."
Before the goal is reached, one perhaps must go
through course after course of soul pruning; one
must develop the power of specially "beholding"
what is pure and true and perfect right in the face
of that which seems to be. Carlyle says that at the
center of all life is music, and that he who sees
deep enough sees musically. By this same token,
at the center of all life is the perfect pattern, the
image and likeness of God, and he who sees spir

itually sees through the eyes of God: beholds the
good and the beautiful everywhere. To develop
spiritually man must unfold the spiritual vision.
Divine imagination exists and it watches every
opportunity to express itself. No doubt you can re
call some memorable occasion when a noble, un
selfish impulse sprang up from within your soul,
and before you knew it you were acting upon that
impulse. You know now that your divine nature,
suddenly aroused, brought that unselfish impulse
into expression. Your friends may have told you that
under the sway of that impulse the whole expression
of your face changed; the light in your eyes deep
ened, you were possessed of a new and wonderful
strength of character. On this memorable occasion,
your eyes saw what your soul had the ability to
image and to hold. The eye of your mind saw
the superb thing you were capable of bringing forth.
In other words, you opened that inner door so that
you could at least glimpse the kingdom of the
heavens within. Such experiences make the soul
hunger to live up to these noble impulses, to express
the real self. In other words there is a constant
soul craving to be fed on unselfish ideas.
Imagination is an attribute of God. It is the form
ative power of thought, the molding power of the

mind. It is that which gives shape, tone, color to
thinking. In truth every word, every combination
of words, has back of it an image, a thought pic
ture. These images, these combinations of shapes
working in omnipresent substance, mold the life
of men.
We all have free access to God, therefore we
have free access to divine imagination. Would you
be strong, healthy, wise, lovable? Image yourself,
think of yourself as strong, healthy, wise, lovable.
Watch the deep, inner thoughts of your mind; back
of them are images that are molding your life.
Jesus Christ knew how the law of divine imagina
tion works and He molded His life after the divine
pattern. That fact was what He had in mind when
He said: "He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father." He knew that He was the image of the
Father brought into manifestation.
We find in reading the Bible that the prophets of
old were well versed in the use of the imagination.
They were guided by their visions and their dreams.
There is a scientific law back of men's visions of
the night. Everything that happens in the outer
world first takes place in the inner realm of thought.
The inner realm of thought is where the Spirit of
truth operates, and when something that is vital in

a person's life is about to take place, the Spirit of
truth makes it known to him in the manner that
can best reach his consciousness. Often when one
becomes still, as in sleep, the Spirit of truth throws
the message on the screen of the mind in thought
pictures, and the recipient calls it a dream. Of
course one must learn to read the symbols. If the
message is good, all is well. If not, one should go
into the silence, and hold realizations for light,
wisdom, and the transforming power of Spirit until
the error is dissolved. Emerson said that nothing is
so hideous, so unclean, but that intense light will
make it beautiful. This rule holds good in dissolv
ing error thought forces that are trying to manifest
their power in one's life.
On the other hand we find that before Jesus
Christ can be imaged in a dream, we must use those
deep, powerful spiritual laws which bring forth the
divine image. The same scientific law that governs
dreams governs visions.
Just as the prophets of old were guided through
the faculty of imagination, so spiritually quickened
souls all down the ages have been guided by this
same power.

the Spirit of truth, often takes a prophetic turn; it

know possibilities as they really are: what will take
place if such and such thought forces continue to
operate.
During the Revolutionary War George Wash
ington's strong right arm and active imagination
were directive powers through which the Lord
worked in laying the foundation stones of the
United States of America. It is said that during the
discouraging days of 1777, when Washington was
encamped with his army at Valley Forge, a vision
came to him. While he was on his knees praying,
asking to be shown the right thing to do, a light
shone round about him and a vision of a broad and
prosperous country spread out before him. He
recognized it as the future United States. In truth
he had made the contact with spiritual forces out-
picturing what would inevitably come to pass. Wash
ington's heart thrilled with exultation. The remem
brance of that vision spurred him on to victory. After
the colonists had won the war, that vision made him
a tireless worker in helping to perfect the Consti
tution and to establish the country on a sound basis.
In the unfoldment of the other eleven faculties it
is the activity of the imagination that causes the dif

silence the radiation of the word of power has
reached a certain degree of intensity, the imaging
faculty not only stamps the realization with shape
or form, corresponding with the true worth of the
realization, but it also causes the color blue-purple
to appear. When the realization for love is held,
the imaging power causes the color rose to appear,
and so on.
The imaging power of the mind is symbolized
by all the colors of the rainbow. However when all
these colors are brought to a focal point, a flow of
white light is the result. Take this same billowy
flow of light and pass it through a crystal prism,
and it will come out on the other side of the prism
broken up into its component parts, purple, green,
pink, yellow, and so forth.
Jesus' apostle Bartholomew symbolizes the faculty
of divine imagination. Between the eyes is a gan
glionic nerve center, which when spiritually quick
ened will set into operation the divine imaging
power.

Chapter VIII
FOR
ages the soul of man, confined in the
prison of sense consciousness, has intensely
desired a higher and a better life than that
which is compassed by the five senses. The strug
gling soul has craved an understanding heart, has
prayed above all things to be. led out of the dark
ness and the wilderness of the five-sense life into
a new life, into something worth while. For ages the
only answer to this craving has been the hope of
heaven after death, with the proviso that man ac
cept the worm-of-the-dust theory and bow to pain
and suffering as conditions placed upon him by God.
By meditation and by the innate logic of his mind,
which is really a process of cleaning the windows
of his mind so that he continually sees a little more
clearly, man has become conscious of his unity
with the great source of almightiness, and has
learned that through this unity he may be led into
the light here and now. In other words, divine
understanding is today awaking in the heart of man.

And apply thy heart to understanding."
For one to incline the ear to wisdom is to bend
one's mind toward the universal mind of wisdom
until one sets one's thoughts into action in a manner
that will enable them to move in unison with Divine
Mind. Just as the sunflower always keeps its face
turned toward the sun, just as the trailing vine runs
toward the light, so the inner forces of the soul
must be turned toward the divine. To apply the
heart to understanding means to work diligently
and earnestly for the purpose of gaining a knowl
edge of the laws that govern life, and to strive to
operate those laws.
Divine understanding is the perceiving power of
the mind. Divine understanding is the eyes of its
twin faculty, divine will. Divine will is the govern
ing, directing power of the mind. These spiritual
faculties operate through the front brain and are
represented by the apostles Thomas (understanding)
and Matthew (will). These powers working to
gether have the ability to perceive in the invisible
realm of thought, and to direct and bring the inner
light from the unmanifest to the manifest world.
They connect the inner world of thought with the
outer world of manifestation.

understanding may seem to be operating in a dim
light; to be clouded, indistinct, indecisive. But
within each one of us is a spiritual law of light
(understanding) that, if we industriously affirm
it,
will develop in us the power to use the attributes of
God and to understand their place and their work
in the Deity. Spiritual understanding enables the
consciousness to see and to feel spiritually. Spir
itual understanding gives clear insight into every
thing,
it
remolds the mentality, and inspires the
will to direct, to act, and to control.
At the beginning of
a
new year we often make
new resolutions, but we do not always live up to
them. What
is
the stumbling block? We have been
sincere in making the resolutions, but the old mental
conceptions formed
by
limited understanding resist
the new understanding, the new inspiration; they
try to hold their ground. This resistance causes
a
letting down in consciousness.
It
takes patience, per
severance, industry to remold the perceptive and
directive powers of the mind. But while the process
may be slow,
it
is
sure
if
we keep on. Our problem
is
to gather enough energy, power, love, wisdom,
and pure light within to enable us to breathe divine
liberation into the soul, into the very flesh; to
arouse sufficient power to lift up the whole con

seriousness until we see with an understanding heart.
In these days we hear much about the garden of
God; it is a theme for song writers and for poets.
The song "In the Garden" reminds us that Jesus
walks with us and talks with us and tells us we are
His own. What is this wonderful garden of God
where the Christ dwells? Is it a place in the outer
world? Have we ever analyzed it scientifically? Do
we know just where this garden is? John, Jesus'
beloved apostle, tells of his wonderful vision of
the resurrected Jesus in the garden of God. Accord
ing to Ferrar Fenton's translation, the passage reads:
"He [Jesus] . . . pointed out to me a river of
living water, sparkling like crystal, flowing in the
center of its broad-way out from the throne of God
and of the Lamb; and a tree of life, producing
twelve crops, with the river on both sides. Each
month yielded its own crop; and the leaves of the
tree were for the healing of the nations."
This wonderful garden of God must be the whole
body temple, and all the glorious things that John
saw there must have been the outpicturing of his
spiritualized soul thoughts; for the soul occupies the
body temple, and its emanation is called the aura.
Jesus symbolized the indwelling Christ in action.

water, sparkling like crystal, flowing in the center
of its broad-way." This river of living water is
produced by the flow of spiritual thoughts through
the soul. The ebb and the flow of spiritual thinking
produce a fine essence of life, which flows through
the nerves. This essence of life also courses through
the blood. The river flowed "out from the throne
of God and of the Lamb." All things come from
the word, and the throne denotes the establishment
of the spiritual word within the soul, through which
authority is given man to exercise power and do
minion. "A tree of life, producing twelve crops
. . . and the leaves of the tree were for the healing
of the nations": the picture given in this passage
represents the soul's energy and life in the nervous
system. There are two great branches to this tree of
life: the sympathetic nervous system and the cere
brospinal nervous system. The great ganglia of the
sympathetic system regulate the functions of respira
tion, circulation, and digestion, the nerve centers
near the heart and the stomach being the central
stations. This nervous system makes us feel joy or
sadness, health or illness. The cerebrospinal sys
tem consists of the brain and the spinal cord,
with branches to various parts of the body; it gives
us the power to move.

This wonderful tree of life brings forth much
fruit, symbolizing the unlimited power of Spirit to
increase.
For a regenerative exercise in the silence, first
take up the one given in Chapter I. Then still al
lowing the Presence to dwell at the point desig
nated as the solar nerve center, declare that your
body temple is the garden of God, that Jesus (the
indwelling Christ in action) is standing in the
midst directing and controlling the ebb and flow of
your spiritual energies. Hold this thought:
The Christ of God is active in me; the breath of
the Almighty gives me understanding. I am trans
formed by the renewing of my mind.
Next allowing the Presence to ascend to the
front brain, to the understanding and the will center,
meditate upon this thought:
Divine understanding is awakened in me, and I
am divinely guided in all that I do. I see spiritually,
I feel spiritually, I know spiritually.
Then allow the Presence to drop down into the
feet, holding this prayer:
My feet are placed on the firm rock of divine
understanding. I am shod in sandals of pure gold.
I am governed, guided, and directed by the wisdom
and the power of the indwelling Christ.

While the will and understanding faculties in
the front forehead contact the mind, the feet rep
resent the understanding and guiding power that
contacts materiality.
Next allow the Presence to rise to the point
designated as the great solar nerve center back of
heart and stomach, and feel the spiritual flow from
head to foot; realize again that your whole body
temple is the garden of God and that every spir

by softly repeating the Lord's Prayer. The Christ of
God in the midst of you is mighty to heal, to guide,
and to uplift. By this time you will have discov
ered that the unfoldment of the spiritual faculties
is one of the most advanced of metaphysical devel
opments and cannot be pushed. However when one
has learned how to harness and use these powers,
one would not go back to the old methods any more
than one who has learned the advantage of har
nessing and using electricity would go back to
coal oil and the old ways of living. A student who
is working earnestly along the line of faculty un
foldment may become aware of growing pains.

Chapter IX
E will obey the voice of Jehovah our
God . . . that it may be well with us."
Every great character of the Bible
became great by learning to hear and to obey in
all things the voice of the indwelling Christ. Moses'
life reveals how nonresistance and obedience may
lead one through the dangers of sense conscious
ness (Egypt) into light and freedom (Promised
Land). When Moses was born his life was, from
the viewpoint of man, in immediate danger. The
king of Egypt had issued an edict that every male
child born to the Israelites should be killed. This
decree doomed Moses. But the spiritual nature
wrapped in the soul of the young babe delivered
him from the man-made law and brought him
safely through every peril.
The great mother love in the heart of the woman
who bore Moses caused her to hide him away during
the first few months of his life. When she could
no longer keep him in concealment, she made a
basket of rushes, placed him in
it,
and set the
basket among the reeds on the shore of the river

Nile, with the prayer that God would guide the
little bark and bring the precious cargo into the
hands of some one who could and would protect
and save her child. God's hand protected the boat.
An Egyptian princess, accompanied by her ladies in
waiting, came to bathe in the Nile. She found the
babe in his queer boat and adopted him. Thus
through God's guidance this little waif (presum
ably) was placed where he received the best of
care, where eventually every advantage of the land
of Egypt was opened to him.
Moses became a great leader, a great lawgiver.
The name Moses means "drawing out." Through
the power of divine guidance he finally led the
Children of Israel out of their Egyptian bondage
and placed them on the path that led to the Prom
ised Land.
The history of Moses is the history of every great
character. Obedience to the guiding power of the in
dwelling Lord was the one thing that elevated him
above the race.
Man has gradually drifted away from his cen
tral I am into the outer realms of consciousness
until today he dwells largely in the night of his
mind; he has become involved in external entangle
ments and confusion until his consciousness has

lost the real power of Spirit. Man has become will
ful, which is the cause of much of his suffering.
He has lost almost all conception of what it is to
hear and to heed the voice of the indwelling Lord.
He looks to man-made laws and to man's opinions
as standards of living and thinks that in worldly
affairs there is no place for religion. The affairs of
the world have been carried on independent of
the higher powers, until today our civilization is
approaching chaos.
But the awakening Christian of the present time
is working early and late to learn of the quickening
power of Spirit and is continually saying with Paul:
"Let every soul be in subjection to the higher
powers: for there is no power but of God; and the
powers that be are ordained of God." Man quick
ened by Spirit realizes that God is the one and only
power, and he desires above all else to be guided
and directed by that power. The devout soul is will
ing that the will of God shall be done in him, but
he may be uncertain as to the way. A good prayer
for guidance is this:
/ am guided, governed, and directed by the wis
dom and the power of my indwelling Lord, and all
my ways are ways of pleasantness and all my paths
are peace.

We must do more than merely repeat this prayer;
we must realize it in the very depths of our heart
until our every faculty and our every cell responds.
This realization opens the way so that the light
of Spirit may descend from the higher realms of the
mind and establish itself within the soul. How
eagerly the awakening student seeks this newborn
light. How eagerly he follows
it,
more than willing
to prostrate himself before the throne of God,
if
by
so doing he may be led out of the darkness of
mortal ignorance into
a
better understanding of
life. Thus the quickened soul
is
learning to obey; the
faculty of divine will that operates between abso
lute Truth and relative conditions
is
coming again,
little
by
little, into activity in the affairs of man.
Divine will
is
the mediator between God and man.
It
operates between the inner realms of mind and
the outer manifestation. Among the apostles of
Jesus Christ, Matthew symbolizes the will, the exec
utive power of the mind. (He was
a
tax collector,
who sat at the gate and exacted tribute from those
who passed through.) Divine will (Matthew),
together with its twin faculty divine understanding
(Thomas), operates in the forehead, the front
brain. Every high spiritual realization—be
it
a
realization of love, of power, or what not—should

be gently brought to the attention of these twin
faculties, the will and the understanding, because
they make connection between the invisible world
of thought and the outer world of manifestation.
Divine will is good will. In real spiritual un-
foldment, when we become obedient to the in
dwelling Christ, will and understanding inquire
into the real value of every thought that knocks at
the door of consciousness; they learn its real value,
and they make it pay tribute according to its worth.
Emerson said that one man was true to what is
in you and me. That one man was Jesus Christ. Let
us be true to ourselves. Let us be true to what is
in us. I believe that obedience to the best that we
know is the key that will unlock every door that
opens into the spiritual realms. Let us be obedient.
Each one of us can be conscious of this inner guid
ance. By being meek and lowly, subservient to
Spirit, we open the way for God's great loving will
to enwrap us, to protect us, to lead us into the paths
of peace, health, happiness, and prosperity, just as
it protected Moses' little reed boat in the river Nile.
A good exercise for the silence is to go within
and take up the exercise given in Chapter I. Then,

God's laws are all.
Then allow the Presence to ascend to the front
forehead (center of the twin faculties will and un
derstanding), and affirm:
The will of God is ever uppermost in my con
sciousness, and I am glorified in my understanding.
Next allow the Presence to drop down into the
order center, back of the navel ; and affirm :
My understanding is opened and my will is alert
in the execution of the law.
Gradually you will come to know that God's
loving, sheltering will is within you and about you,
and this realization will give you a consciousness
of security and understanding. Then again allow
the Presence to ascend to the point designated as the
great central sun, and close the exercise by softly
repeating the Lord's Prayer.
In conclusion, for the sake of perfect balance,
throw the attention down into the feet and know
that the will of God, working in the perfect un
derstanding of the law, is having its perfect way in
you. The feet represent that part of the body which
contacts the earth, also the affairs of the world.
Hence the great necessity of always preserving the
consciousness of equilibrium and poise.

wonderful play, how many of you for a
while did litde but observe the workings of
the machinery auxiliary to the play? At exactly the
right time the curtain went up. At a glance you were
able to note the harmonious arrangement of the
stage. The scenery and the furnishings were a suit
able background for the scene that was to be en
acted. The different characters were introduced at
the right time, in just the order that would make
the play most effective. Everything happened at
the psychological moment. Order and system were
so apparent that you could not help noticing them.
The same law of order and system that is neces
sary to a play is necessary to right relations among
all the peoples of the earth. Were it not for the law
of divine order, confusion would be apparent every
where. Law and order are back of all manifestation.
All creation is working through an evolutionary
process under law. Especially is this true of man,
in whom and through whom God carries forward
the creative law.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
The perfect man is created as a perfect-man idea,
which is to be manifested under the law of divine
order. This perfect-man pattern (Christ) is work
ing itself out through the flesh, coming, into perfect
manifestation under law and order.
Man has free will, and in his ignorance he often
acts in direct opposition to the divine law, but when
he reaches a certain stage of understanding he strives
earnestly to keep the divine law. He knows that his
freedom will come by his co-operating intelligently
with the law. "Ye shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free."
In working out his problems of everyday life,
man should first take into consideration the rela
tion that the problem bears to God, then to his fel
low men and himself. Next he should lay hold of
the ideas that are to be worked upon by divine law.
As these fundamental ideas are incorporated into
consciousness they make contact with thought forces
on various planes of action, and the many complex
problems that arise in the course of the soul's evo
lution are harmonized under the higher law.
It is very clear that the safety of the people of
the earth lies in the operation of the law of order
upon which the universe is founded. To be happy we
must act in accordance with God's eternal laws and

allow them to work peacefully and thoroughly in
and through all that we do. Divine law is not hard
and binding; it expresses itself in freedom and joy.
Our so-called laws of civilization are in a way
copied after the divine law, but personality has
entered in, and thoughts of ambition, selfishness,
and greed are dominant; therefore man-made laws
are colored with the personal ambitions of man. To
be overtaken by the law means, to the man immersed
in sense, to be convicted of crime and to be fined
or imprisoned. One overtaken by the divine law—
that
is,
one who has not acted in harmony with the
divine law—suffers mental and physical imprison
ment; he fails to grow spiritually and the reaction
of the forces of life within him destroys his body.
The illumined individual prays for greater strength,
greater power to live in harmony with the law,
counting
it
a
privilege to pay the last farthing of
the penalty that has been imposed because of his
transgression of the law; for
by
so doing he enters
to
a
greater degree into the heavenly kingdom.
The divine law of order working in the subcon
sciousness unearths buried talents, reveals hidden
powers, and paves the way for their expression. The
divine law of order co-ordinates the mind powers

unhindered recognition and lodgment in the con
scious mind. The divine law of order emphasizes
the overcoming power of man, thereby abolishing
fear and despair. Sickness and weakness are never
to be recognized as having a place in divine law
and order. Health and freedom are always the out-
workings of God's wondrous plan. In short, while
man apparently is undergoing continual change, both
physically and mentally, the changeless law of or
der is operating in the spiritual depths of his being.
Our spiritual realizations blend in the subcon
sciousness and work to eliminate the weak and the
negative; a wonderful law of order is at work there.
There is a yoking and a pulling together of the spir
itual powers to the end that both soul and body
may be lifted up to the divine standard. "Even so
must the Son of man be lifted up."
In II Peter 1:2-8 is depicted the manner in which
order and law unfold spiritual qualities:
"Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the
knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; seeing
that his divine power hath granted unto us all
things that pertain unto life and godliness, through
the knowledge of him that called us by his own
glory and virtue; whereby he hath granted unto us
his precious and exceeding great promises; that

through these ye may become partakers of the di
vine nature, having escaped from the corruption that
is in the world by lust. Yea, and for this very cause
adding on your part all diligence, in your faith
supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge; and
in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-

in your godliness brotherly kindness; and in your

By broadly watching the results of the operation
of the universal law we perceive that the whole
world is a stage and that each one has his part to
play; we see that in man there is a specific spiritual
faculty that, when unfolded, moves the machinery
of mind, body, and affairs more perfectly, scien
tifically, harmoniously, and skillfully than the effi
cient stage manager handles a play.
In the development of the type man Jesus, James
(son of Alphaeus) represents law and order. His
work was to co-operate with the other disciples,
just as the orderly movement of a play depends upon
the co-operation of the players. The center of order

back of the navel. By employing prayer and medi
tation one may quicken the ganglionic nerve cells
at the order center. It is through the navel that the
unborn babe receives its sustenance from the mother;
so it is through this order center that the soul, spir
itually quickened, receives the divine manna direct
from the Father-Mother God. Through our medi
tation and consecration the spiritual laws are un
folded to us from within. Then our realization of
God as the great Father-Mother is quickened and
not only do we discern the soul experiences that
have been ours in former lives, but it is revealed to
us that certain unfulfilled desires have determined
our present parentage. The inner realization corre
sponds with the outer manifestation.
Divine order radiates its mighty power into the
other faculties and sets them into sustained activity
to the end that the perfect man shall be brought
forth. Thus through the operation of divine order,
the greatness of the soul is demonstrated and the
nature of God is revealed.
For the regenerative exercise in the silence, first
take up the exercise given in Chapter I. Continuing
to allow the Presence, the light of Spirit, to dwell
at the point designated as the great central sun,

Divine order is active in my mind, body, and af
fairs, and all things are working together for my
good.
Realize that, under divine law, the rule of infinite
Mind is awakened in you and that every function
and organ of your being is inspired with health,
harmony, peace, joy, and satisfaction.
Then let the Presence descend to the order center
back of navel, and affirm:
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has
made me free from the law of sin and of death.
As you dwell upon this powerful statement realize
that the light of Spirit from on high, from the spir
itual center in the crown of the head, is descending
upon you, and that you are laying hold of a new
understanding of the divine law of life. Next allow
the Presence to center in the small of the back, the
strength center. Then, perfectly relaxed in mind
and in body, affirm:
The law of divine order and harmony is satisfied
in me, and I behold myself a tower of spiritual
strength and stability.
Then let the Presence ascend to the power center
at the root of the tongue and base of neck, and

Next let the light of Spirit return to the order
center just back of the navel, and declare:
Praise God, the law of divine order is satisfied
in me, and I am at peace with all mankind.
Then allow the Presence to return to the point
designated as the great central sun; there realize
that the laws of God are written in your heart and
that your delight is to direct your life according to
His laws. Close the exercise by softly repeating the
Lord's Prayer.
After the drill is ended, throw the attention down
into the feet; and declare that your house is in order
and that all the forces of your being are working to
glorify God.

and establishes a confidence, a sureness that even the
angels of heaven must notice and honor.
The world has been zealous in advocating re
forms. The trouble with all reforms has been that
those who were behind them have tried to compel
man to change his ways without changing his heart.
When the principles of practical Christianity get a
deep hold on one's consciousness, one is not only
willing to change but to work continuously to lay
hold of the spiritual powers that will transform
him. Application of the fundamental principles of
Christianity, that
is,
of love toward God and man,
makes new creatures of men and women. This
is
true today, as
it
has been true all down the ages.
But no great inspiration
is
going to emanate from
a
lukewarm religion; one must be zealous in one's
work. Courageous, zealous religion
is
the power
that transforms one, that makes one want to be on
the right side of every proposition.
We hear
it
said very often that there
is
no place
in the commercial world for religion, that religion
is
a
thing to be used on the Sabbath but that
it
is
not practical for everyday affairs. There are many
clear-thinking business men who turn away from
the church, presumably because
it
is
of no value in
their life. Ministers are often troubled because

they cannot make business men keenly interested in
religion. The work of every minister is to put re
ligion into the hearts of men and women and to
keep religion uppermost in their thoughts. "Seek
ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all
these things shall be added unto you." One can
not accomplish such work by picturing the negative
side of life; by preaching that man is a poor,
miserable worm of the dust and that to be righteous
he must be poverty-stricken. But he can accomplish
that end by accepting and practicing the real prin
ciples of Christianity, which are practical, scien
tific, and substantial, and with the right mental at
titude will solve all the problems of the business
world. When a minister preaches the real religion,
he is going to have his church filled with sound
business men who will be zealous to lay hold of
and apply the Christ principles.
The successful business man learns that real suc
cess comes through service. God is the great servitor.
Man is successful to the degree that he truly serves ;
therefore every zealous student should carefully
study his own consciousness, should thoroughly
study his own heart in order to see whether his zeal
springs from the spiritual consciousness or from
the personal consciousness. If his incentive is from

the spiritual consciousness, if he is working to serve,
then zeal broadens his vision, makes him alert, and
adds sweetness and strength to his whole being.
But if the impulse derives from his personal con
sciousness, his zeal merely adds impetus to his
endeavors to gain personal ends, to further his
own interests, even at the expense of other people.
Selfish zeal eventually eats up his life and sub
stance, and leaves him with a starved, hungering
soul, and with a strained, hollow-eyed countenance.
"For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up."
Emerson pictures a person intoxicated with per
sonal zeal as "inwardly drunk with a certain belief."
Courage is a very vital part of religion. The
courageous spirit is zealous to prove the strength
and power of God. The courageous spirit glorifies
God among the daily duties and trials of the world.
Level-headed business men know that it takes a cou
rageous, zealous spirit to win out. They have not
learned this in the church but by experience; they
have not yet come to know that religion, practical
Christianity, gives these qualities. They have not dis
cerned God as their business partner; they have not
yet become aware that the something within them
that leads them to success is the living Christ within
their hearts. When they recognize this connection

they will be zealous to know the deep things of re
ligion, because they cannot afford to be without
religion scientifically understood and applied.
Spiritual zeal is one of the twelve fundamental
powers of being, and is symbolized by Jesus' apostle
Simon the Canaanite. In the body its center of
action is in the medulla at the base of the brain.
By centering the attention at the base of the brain
and realizing the quickening power of the Logos
or Word one causes new zeal and new courage to
find expression in one's soul.
Zeal is the power that incites the other faculties
to greater and ever greater activity. Zeal, courage,
and earnestness give luster and color to the soul,
just as the sparkle of the diamond gives it beauty.
When a person is truly working in the conscious
ness of spiritual zeal he is zealous to express the
meek and lowly spirit, zealous to serve God, to
serve God's children; every impulse of his soul is to
transmute the low, selfish desires into those which
conform to a high spiritual standard. Such a worker
is a pearl of great price in the sight of God; his
power is felt the world round. Courage and fervor
expressed through a meek and lowly spirit awaken a
deep, spiritual feeling, and this deep feeling always
invigorates soul and body.

Although some are overzealous for personal
achievement, the mass of humanity has been list
less, inactive, prone to wait for some outer power
to stir it into action; men have not realized their
deep, spiritually zealous natures. Let us get beneath
such listless inactivity; let us stir up the gift of di

Now allow the Presence to ascend to the faith
center, the pineal gland, at the center of the head.
At this point gently affirm:
Through faith I see into the kingdom of the
heavens, and through spiritual enthusiasm I work
to bring that perfect kingdom into manifestation.
Now let the Presence return to the zeal center
at the base of brain. Resting at this point for a
moment, affirm:

Then let the Presence, the light of Spirit, drop
down to the point back of heart and stomach desig

that you are zealous only to do the will of the

Chapter XII
When
man began to multiply on the face
of the earth and to express his fleshly
freedom, "Jehovah saw that the wicked
ness of man was great in the earth, and that every
imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
evil continually." Much grieved, Jehovah said, "I
will destroy man whom I have created from the
face of the ground."
But there was one righteous man on the earth,
a man who even in the midst of wickedness walked
with God continually. Jehovah made known to this
righteous man Noah the coming of a great deluge
that was to cover the whole earth and destroy every
living thing on the face of the earth. Then Jehovah
said to Noah, "Make thee an ark." Jehovah in
structed Noah just how to make the ark. It was to
be 525 feet in length, 871/2 feet in breadth, and
521/2 feet in height (three stories). It was to be
roomy enough to house Noah and his wife, Noah's
three sons and their wives; seven pairs (male and
female) of every clean beast of the earth; one
pair of the beasts that were not clean; seven pairs

of all the different kinds of birds in the heavens;
and food enough to support all during the period
of the deluge.
When the ark was completed the Flood came.
For forty days and forty nights there was a down
pour of water, until every living thing on the face
of the earth, outside the ark, had been destroyed.
But Noah's ark floated on the face of the waters
and all those on board were safe; finally it drifted
onto the top of Mount Ararat and rested there.
At the end of 150 days the waters began to recede.
Noah opened the windows of the ark and sent forth
a dove, to see whether the waters had been abated
on the earth, but the dove returned; she had found
no place to rest "the sole of her foot." Noah waited
seven days and sent forth the dove a second time.
At eventide she returned bearing an olive leaf in
her mouth. Then Noah knew that the waters were
almost gone. He waited still another seven days and
sent her forth again. She did not return, and Noah
knew that she had found a home on the earth. He
removed the covering from the ark and found the
earth dry. Then he built an altar and offered a burnt
offering to Jehovah. "Jehovah smelled the sweet
savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not
again curse the ground any more for man's sake,

for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from
his youth."
As a token of the covenant that he would not de
stroy by water again, God set his "bow in the
cloud."
"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said
unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth."
The story of Noah and the flood portrays in won
derful symbology the manner in which one of the
twelve fundamental faculties of being works in
unfolding the perfect man. The faculty of renun
ciation is twofold in action: It eliminates error and
expands the good. The word "Noah" symbolizes
the sweet rest and the comfort that come after the
soul has worked out in consciousness certain prob
lems, both good and evil, and has perceived that
there is an original spark of divinity in man that
is indeed a very sacred, holy thing, and that the
expansion of this original divine spark is man's
spiritual development. Jehovah, the image-and-
likeness man created by Elohim God, recognizes
only the good, and instructs the Adam man to open
his consciousness only to good thoughts, and by the
waters of denial to cleanse his consciousness of the
evil.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
Man's body is divine and every activity in the body
temple is fundamentally divine. We must know this,
realize it daily, if we would make our body a fit
dwelling place for the Holy Spirit.
In the lower part of the back, near the base of the
spinal column, is a ganglionic nerve center which,
when spiritually quickened, has power to perform
a wonderful work of the kind symbolized in the
story of Noah and the flood. This nerve center is
symbolized by Jesus' apostle Thaddaeus; it presides
over the elimination of waste from the body temple;
it eliminates error thoughts from the mind and
expands the good.
When working under the light of Spirit the fac
ulty of renunciation or elimination establishes a
freedom in soul and body consciousness that gives
tone and strength and elasticity to the whole man.
Letting go of the old in an orderly and decisive
manner, at the same time laying hold of the new,
engenders a sweetness and a lightness in the whole
being.
Jesus said, "If any man would come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
me." The self that Jesus taught must be denied is
the grasping personality. It must let go of its hold
upon possessive ideas before there can be harmo

nious activity in the eliminative center. From the
invisible side of life Spirit is constantly infusing into
our being more of itself, and at the same time casting
out of mind and body all the waste. The forgiving
love of Jesus Christ is not only a wonderful spir
itual stimulant for soul and body, but it is also an
important factor in the eliminative process. When
the voice of Spirit within proclaims to you, "Thy
sins are forgiven," it means that you have opened
the way for the fulfillment of the law in you. There
is a discarding of personality and an increased ac
tivity of the spiritual forces. There is an inrushing
of the new and a letting go of the old. Just as the
flower, unfolding its petals to the sunshine and
drinking in new life and strength and beauty, ex
hales that which is poisonous to
it,
so the whole
being of man, when the law of forgiveness
is
satis
fied, draws new life and strength and power from
the one divine source and throws off the old.
While renunciation
is
passive in character,
it
is
positive and decisive in action. The innermost
thoughts of man determine the standard that he sets
up in his life, and the whole being endeavors to
measure up to this standard. The degree of intelli
gence that finds expression in man's conscious
thought determines the character of the manifesta

tion. Therefore if we would be healthy and happy
and prosperous, we must learn to do healthy,
hearty, positive thinking. We must not be dominated
by another's will. To let some one else do our
thinking for us makes us negative, indecisive, in
direct. If we try to hold on and let go at the same
time, renunciation and elimination in both mind
and body are weak, negative, irregular. The nega
tive attitude wears away the greater abilities of
the soul and diffuses mental poison throughout the
whole being.
Holding thoughts of unhappiness, sin, sickness, and
poverty is the cause of much of the inharmony that
exists today. One may tie up the bowels by holding
to grasping, selfish ideas. On the other hand, a per
son troubled by excessive looseness of the bowels
can be healed by a treatment to induce courage and
fearlessness. A daily study of the 23d Psalm and a
meditation on it are wonderful solvents for fear.
An affirmative thought sometimes produces a con
gested condition throughout the body and interferes
with elimination. Continued strenuous affirmations,
even of Truth, will sometimes cause constipation.
The remedy is to relax, to let go. The words of
Truth that you have affirmed must have time to work
out in the subconsciousness. We can never gain pos

session of the kingdom of harmony until we are free
to express the wisdom and the power of Spirit as
divine intelligence reveals them to us.
We are born daily and we die daily. While some
error thought may stick in our mind and hold fast
for a season, whenever new light is born in con
sciousness the old error thought loses its grasp and
falls away. This life activity is illustrated beauti
fully in nature; in a tree, for example. Throughout
the summer months, the leaves drink in new life,
which they instinctively feel is in preparation; and
they store up in the trunk and branches new energy
for next year's unfoldment. When autumn comes,
and their work is accomplished, the leaves fall off,
making way for the new. But here and there an old
dead leaf holds on, refusing to give way to the
blustery winds and the cutting sleet. But when
spring comes, and the first tiny green shoot appears
beneath its clinging hand, the old leaf loses its
hold and follows its comrades.
Man is making his body temple an eternal dwell
ing place for the soul. His goal is to bring into ex
pression the kingdom of the heavens and to estab
lish it within him. Consequently he needs to realize
consciously that the passing away of the old and the
incoming of the new are results of the outworking

of the law, and that he should assist in bringing
about this change. His every experience aids in es
tablishing more firmly his identity in Spirit, and so
gives him greater freedom and power and brings
him nearer the goal of perfection—perfect health
in mind and body. "They must upward still, and
onward, who would keep abreast of Truth."
For a regenerative exercise in the silence, first
follow the one given in Chapter I. Then continuing
to allow the Presence to dwell at the point desig
nated as the great solar nerve center, realize that
Jesus (the indwelling Christ in action) is standing
in your midst, the one controlling, directing power,
saying: "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest." As these
words penetrate the soul consciousness you will
realize that you are letting go of all weariness, all
doubt, and all fear, and that you feel a lightness and
a freedom throughout your whole being. Hold this
thought:
1 gladly let go of the old. My whole being ex
pands with the new life in Christ Jesus.
Then allow the Presence to ascend to the love
center, the heart; there hold the prayer:
The forgiving love of Jesus Christ cleanses, puri
fies, and strengthens me.

Dwell on this thought for some time, relaxing
more and more throughout the region of the cardiac
and solar plexuses. During the whole time be sure
that the conscious mind is fully aware of the work
that is going on.
Next allow the Presence to return to the center
of renunciation, located at lower end of spinal
column. Meditate upon the word:
The forgiving love of Jesus Christ cleanses, puri
fies, and strengthens me.
Then let the Presence ascend to the strength
center, in small of back, and affirm:
/ gladly let go of weak, worn-out thoughts in mind
and in body. The joy of the Lord is my strength.
Next let the Presence cross to the order center
back of the navel, and hold the prayer:
Every function and every organ is working in per
fect harmony with spiritual law. Divine order is
established within me, and my bowels move regu
larly and naturally.
Then let the Presence descend again to the center
of elimination and praise God and give thanks that
His spiritual word is active throughout your whole
being, with all its cleansing, discriminating, purify
ing power and that you are joyously working with it.

As in previous exercises you should be conscious
continually of the light of Spirit descending from
the spiritual center at the crown of the head; you
should in truth be conscious of every step taken in
the entire exercise.
After the close of the exercise throw the attention
down into the feet and beneath the feet, also into

and balance throughout your whole being.

before we come to the place where we are ready
to lay hold of Truth understanding^. Without the
desire for greater understanding of life, without the
desire for a greater degree of life activity, we
should never strive for the unfoldment of the soul.
Without the inner push spurring us on to greater
achievement, without the urgent desire to work out
the chaos and confusion into light and joy, we
should never bend our energies to the realization of
the divine intelligence that reveals to us the attitude
we should take in all the relations of life. Yet when
we develop the ability to lay hold of understanding,
we find that the Spirit of the Lord has gone before
and accomplished the real work for us. It is obvious
therefore that life's problems consist chiefly in
awakening the consciousness of the spiritual powers
of being and acquiring a mental grasp of them.
But in grasping these spiritual powers we should
not make hard work of it. Often metaphysicians
are so bent on their spiritual demonstrations that
they squeeze the joy and freedom out of life. A joy
ful, carefree heart is one of the most valuable assets
in demonstrating health and wholeness. Exalted joy
is co-ordinate with gratitude and praise, and it is the
consciousness abounding in gratitude and praise that
directly relates us to God so that we may be awak

ened and thrilled with the creative impulses of Di
vine Mind. Indeed if a person would be a master
in the realm of creative ideas, he must be free from
worry and doubt and misgivings and be rilled with
joyful praise and anticipation. These qualities are
the magnets that draw to him new inspiration out of
the superconsciousness.
Life is progress, attainment, mastery, and every
new spiritual realization makes finer and stronger
and more beautiful the texture of the soul, and it
engenders the power to draw from the invisible the
fulfillment of its highest ideals.
In Biblical times we see each successive leader,
with his group of associates, rising higher in con
sciousness than his predecessors. So in individual
consciousness each step forward in spiritual growth
is just a more nearly perfect blossoming of an idea
drawn out of the superconsciousness by an innate
desire of the soul. Abraham was great, but David
was a strong spiritual leader. Yet David, with all
his love and knowledge, came nowhere near meas
uring up to Jesus' standard of life.
Divine ideas are universal in character and recog
nize the unity of life among people of all nations.
These ideas of life, working in and through the
soul, draw to them their own from the four cor

ners of the earth. They attach to the individual and
to the environment all the grandeur and loyalty and
sublimity contained in the original idea. It is through
this process that both the inner and the outer life
grow rich and full and satisfying.
In demonstrating the Christ life the first thing to
overcome is inertia. In the first steps in the process
of evolving, there are pitfalls and stumbling blocks
of which we are not aware until we trip and fall.
Unless we are open to spiritual light this may hap
pen again and again until the downward pull has
established us in an indifferent state of conscious
ness. Confidence dies away and inertia results. But
the desire and the stir of life awaken man from his
inactivity and spur him onward. It is in the working
out of this state of lethargy that we develop spir
itual powers that we should not otherwise feel the
need of.
Therefore no matter where you are on the ladder
of life, do not be discouraged. Back of all is God's
eternal plan; back of all appearances your place in
the world is waiting for you, and Spirit is with you
every step of the way, helping you to bring God's
perfection into expression. As you struggle on for
the victory a truer understanding of life appears. As

that would slay you, new strength and trust begin
to stir in the heart and you are no longer at the
mercy of sense consciousness, the adversary who has
held you in bondage for so long.
But the redeeming process must be carried on
throughout the whole being. Just as spiritual realiza
tions now stamp their images upon us, so when we
were in darkness the malformed, ill-shaped thoughts
of the mortal formed their mental concepts in us;
and these must now be dealt with. It is through per
sistent realizations of perfect life, through broaden
ing the vision and keeping the imagination stayed
on the perfect patterns of life, that the false con
cepts are erased and spiritual faculties are estab
lished. In your deeper meditations you have attained
wonderful realizations of divine life. For instance,
you have been able to take a statement such as "The
purifying power of divine life is active in me
through Jesus Christ" and to concentrate upon it
until the living Truth contained in the word became
so alive that it was resolved back into formless
essence, in which state it was dispensed throughout
the soul and body consciousness, awakening every
function and organ to a greater degree of power
and life.

abiding and reliable, in voice and word and act,
they must come in touch with the faculty of con
scious knowing. Just as in writing the pen is a tool
in the hand of him who is directing its movements
over the paper, so the intellect is a tool of Spirit;
and for any realization to become firmly established
in the consciousness it must be contacted and taken
possession of by this power of conscious apprehen
sion. When this takes place, the transformation
extends to the intellect itself. The spiritual idea
works in the human notions that have been pre
viously formed, and mental standards are revolu
tionized. Then the intellect is sharpened and pol
ished and becomes a fit tool of Spirit.
Man's supreme demonstration however is gaining
dominion over himself ; becoming God in expression.
"As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall
also bear the image of the heavenly." This is the
reward of living the regenerate life. We are born of
the Spirit and are delivered from the body of death.

ment that can be attained is that of the psychic
nature. This finally agonizes the soul until it yearn
ingly gropes after the higher life of Spirit, which
yearning opens the way to the real goal of attain
ment. The enigma of life, the secret of regenera
tion, is revealed to the consciousness through affir
mations and realizations that the I am, the son of
the living God, even Christ, is within man; "even
the mystery which hath been hid for ages and gen
erations: but now hath it been manifested to his
saints, to whom God was pleased to make known
what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among
the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory."
Regeneration means just what the word describes
—a regeneration of man's soul and body through a
spiritual activity of the generative organs. In regen
eration the generative center is no longer allowed
to waste its substance on the sense plane; by pure
thinking and chaste acting it generates an uplifting,
living energy in soul and body that, when raised
to the Jesus Christ purity of life, arouses all the
faculties to power and ability. Then the under
standing of the silent and spoken word is magni
fied, and with the renewed thought it comes forth
in a new expression in both soul and body.

CHRIST ENTHRONED IN MAN
The experiences we have while passing through
the throes of a new birth depend largely upon our
attitude of mind toward God and toward humanity.
To be born anew under the law of love is a joy.
But if we allow ourselves to be reborn in the thought
that we are doing penance, that we have to lose
everything for the sake of Christ, the rebirth is slow
and tedious. Therefore take your stand in regen
eration with a joyful heart, knowing that God will
not try you beyond what you are able to stand. Then
with the thought of nonresistance as regards every
body and everything, express the positive, agreeable
joy that springs from the possession of good. Then
your way will be made easy.
"And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will,
let him take the water of life freely."
The regenerative exercise for inducing life is of
great importance. It is a longer and more intricate
one than any of those given in the preceding
chapters.
First begin with the exercise given in Chapter I.
Then realize that you are perfectly relaxed in mind
and body, continue to allow the Presence, the
Holy Spirit, to dwell at the point designated as the

Feel the new life that is now quickening within
you flowing out through the breast and down into
the innermost part of the bowels. At the same time
bear in mind that the outpouring of the new spir
itual life is gently descending from the spiritual
center at the crown of the head. Next let the Pres
ence drop down to the life organs, the generative
center itself, in the lower part of the abdomen. Here,
as in every exercise when approaching this center,
think of the pure, strong, sweet life of Jesus Christ.
Know that right now His regenerated life is waiting
to do its perfect work in you. Realize that through
the help of Jesus Christ now extended to you, every
coarse impulse of soul and body is transmuted into
divine purity of life and purpose. With the Pres
ence being diffused throughout the life organs, then
take up the prayer:
I am Spirit and "I am the resurrection, and the
life."
You will presently be aware of a great purifying,
transmuting power beginning to do its perfect work
in you. Next allow the Presence again to return to

Next allow the Presence to ascend to the power

All power is given unto me in mind and in body.
Then allow the Presence to ascend into the front
forehead, to the understanding and the will center.
Affirm:
/ have a perfect understanding of life, and I am

Then let the Presence descend to the order center

pulses of sense consciousness being transmuted into

refined and transmuted into a higher radiation of
upbuilding energy.

the Presence, the Holy Spirit, in lifting up and dis
tributing to all parts of the soul and body being this
new life-giving force. This is done by its ascending
the spinal cord; also flowing out over the thousand
nerve tributaries leading from the spinal cord to
every part and organ.
Continuing the exercise, allow the Presence to
convey this new refined life stuff to the base of the
spinal cord; then let this all-knowing Power (you
co-operating) lift it up to a point about half the
distance between the base of spinal cord and the
small of back. Allow the Presence to dwell for
several moments at this halfway station, which you
will discover is a great harmonizing, equalizing cen
ter. Affirm:
The peace and harmony of the Holy Spirit in me
is doing its perfect work, and I rest in confidence
and joy.
Now allow the Presence to lift up the life essence
to the small of back, the strength center. But in the
lifting-up process you will become aware that the
new life energy is being dispensed over the nerve
wires to the innermost parts of your body as well as
the outermost rim of consciousness, and that there is
an ever-increasing flow.

Then let the Presence carry the life force upward
until it reaches the point designated as the great
solar center, where it will pour the life energy like
a mighty flood into the soul consciousness, from
where it will find its way into all the vital parts and
organs.
This will create a new activity in both the wisdom
and the love center, and the indwelling Christ will
be more and more in evidence. As the head and the
heart must learn to work more and more in harmony
with each other, it is well to realize that a generous
supply of this renewed life energy, merged with
the wisdom and love of Almightiness is being freely
dispersed through invisible channels to the front
forehead and that the keen, unclouded mind of
Jesus Christ is dominating your conscious thinking.
The Presence will continue to lift up a generous
portion of the life essence to the base of the brain,
the zeal center, where it will do a mighty work.
Here affirm:

of infinite life.

the zeal center, at the base of the brain, to the eyes
and even up into the crown of head. Realize:
The light and the intelligence of Spirit are now
being manifested in me, and I see clearly.
Next allow the Presence to carry the new life
energy from the zeal center over a set of motor
nerves to the ears. Here affirm:
My ears are open, and I hear the voice of Spirit.
Then following the same process, let the new
energy be carried to the nose, and affirm:
The discrimination and purity of Spirit are active
in me.
Now allow the Presence to carry the life current
to the mouth, the root of tongue. Here affirm:
I am free with the freedom of Spirit.
You will remember that at the root of the tongue
and extending down into the neck is situated the
throne of power. When the Presence carries the life
current from the zeal center, at the base of the brain,
to the power center, at the root of the tongue, a
mighty vibration is set up that affects the whole
sympathetic nervous system. You indirectly impart
new life energy to the whole digestive tract; you
also strengthen and deepen your voice and revitalize

Jesus' turning water into wine at Cana in Galilee.
Metaphysically this means that when the Presence
carries the new life current from the zeal center, at
the base of the brain to the power center, at the
root of the tongue, the union (symbolized by the
wedding) of the new life current with the power
energy manufactures a new element, of which wine
is the symbol.
With this knowledge in mind, now allow the
Presence to make this union between the zeal and
power centers. Affirm,
1 am a new creature in Christ Jesus.
Then quietly allow the Presence to descend to the
point designated as the solar center, where you
close the exercise by repeating the Lord's Prayer.
As in the previous exercises, it is absolutely neces
sary to be perfectly relaxed in mind and body, with
the conscious mind fully aware of every step.
After the exercise is finished, throw the attention
down into the feet and beneath the feet, also into
the palms of the hands, and dwell at each point for
some time, as it tends to keep you in perfect poise
and balance.
Then go forth in this new life consciousness, ex
pressing it through every function and organ of
your whole being.

Chrift Enthroned in <J&tan
Chapter XIV
Condensed Exercise on the
Twelve Powers
The
artists of old always painted their saints
with a circle of light around the head, and they
also painted them with a soft, warm, rose-
colored glow around the heart, or with soft, rosy
rays of light radiating from the heart. Let us con
sider if there is a metaphysical truth back of this
old practice. We believe there is. The spiritual cen
ter in the crown of the head is the throne of the
Christ, the throne of the I AM. The heart itself is
the seat of manifest love, which is always expressed
in a warm, rosy glow of light. But it is from the
I am center in the crown of head that we draw all
new inspiration, all new ideas. When they contact
man's consciousness these new ideas or inspirations
break forth as a soft, golden light (pure intelli
gence), which descends first to the seat of the con
scious mind in the front forehead, and to the faith
center in the pineal gland at the center of the head.
Then the flow descends into the cardiac and solar

nerve centers at the very center of the body, in the
region of the heart and stomach, where the Christ
power really begins to become manifest in substance.
Often this light of Spirit (pure intelligence) not
only causes the whole countenance to shine with its
radiance but also surrounds the head, and in those
who live very close to Christ the whole being is
encompassed by it. While one may feel the flow
from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet,
it is in the depths of the body, in what we term the
great solar center or distributing station, that the
indwelling Christ begins to do its great work.
Please do not get confused. The Christ throne, the
I am center, is in the crown of the head; while the
center of the manifest Christ is the point back of
heart and stomach that we have named the great
solar center. The apostle James wrote of the throne
of Christ: "Every good gift and every perfect gift
is from above, coming down from the Father of
lights, with whom can be no variation, neither
shadow that is cast by turning." In other words, the
perfect pattern or perfect idea comes down from the
"Father of lights," which we must learn to bring
into manifestation. Thus we perceive that these old
prophets had a true understanding of spiritual man.

most important point is first to call forth the Christ
mind; then the ingredients or attributes of the
Christ mind, the twelve fundamental ideas in Divine
Mind, which are faith, strength, wisdom, love,
power, imagination, understanding, will, order, zeal,
renunciation, life.
As these twelve fundamental ideas begin their
work in omnipresent substance at the point desig
nated as the solar center, where the manifest Christ
holds forth, the Lord's body begins to shape itself.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem (Bethlehem meaning
"house of bread"), in the stable (among the animal
forces). He is our Way-Shower. Just as it was neces
sary for Spirit in Him to penetrate down into the
most material parts of His being, down into the very
animal forces, to begin the redemptive work, so it is
necessary for us to do likewise.
Just as Jesus Christ was the great star actor in
His and His disciples' ministry here on earth, so
the indwelling Christ is the central figure in un
folding the twelve great powers in the individual.
First we set into activity the indwelling Christ mind;
then gently call forth the disciples.
For the exercise in the silence, first center the
attention in the crown of the head (the I am throne)
and realize that you are releasing in consciousness

the idea of infinite knowing. As you truly get this
realization and as the radiations from it penetrate
the soul, you will be conscious of the emanation of
Spirit as pure light, pure intelligence, descending
within you ; you will feel it working in every cell and
fiber of your body temple. As stated before, you will
gradually discover that this emanation of Spirit
first drops to the faith center at the center of the
head and that the seat of the conscious mind, the
front forehead, is illumined.
From that high vantage point, the crown of the
head and front forehead, you will become aware
that your whole being is suffused with this soft
flow of infinite intelligence, including the very feet,
even the space beneath the feet. There realize that
this descending spiritual flow is contacting and tem
pering an earthly current steadily ascending from
below. Realize that the all-knowing power of Spirit
is transforming such thoughts of the race as fear,
lack, war, sin, and sickness into thoughts of fear
lessness, abundance, peace, justice, purity, and health.
The earthly flow, when rightly handled, will bring
to you new power and ability and will even give you
a broader understanding of life in its manifest form.
It will gradually ascend, permeating and penetrat
ing the whole being in its upward course, meeting

the continual outpouring from on high and at certain
points in the body temple establishing centers in
consciousness. But the larger portion of this renewed
force goes to the seat of consciousness already desig
nated as the great solar center at the hub of being,
back of heart and stomach.
Then from the feet and beneath the feet, follow
the current to the seat of the manifest Christ, and
dwell there, taking up separately and meditating
on each of the twelve fundamental ideas in God-
Mind, faith, strength, wisdom, love, power, imagi
nation, understanding, will, order or law, zeal, re
nunciation, and life. Then realize that twelve rays
of light go forth from the great solar nerve center,
one to the faith center, in the pineal gland at the
center of the head; another ray of light goes to the
strength center, in the small of the back; another
to the wisdom center, at the pit of the stomach; an
other to the love center, the heart itself; another to
the power center, at the root of the tongue; the next
to the center of imagination, located between the
eyes; the next to the will and understanding center,
in the front forehead; the next to the order center,
just back of the navel ; the next to the zeal center, at
the base of the brain ; the next to the elimination cen
ter, at the base of the spinal column; and the last to

the generative center, in the lower part of the abdo
men. It is good for you consciously to co-operate by
following these different rays of light that reach to
the twelve principal centers and by holding special
statements of Truth for the development of each
individual center. As you accompany the Presence
to the faith center, quickly affirm at this point, /
have faith in God. Return to the center of being (the
great solar nerve center) with the same affirmation.
Next go to the strength center, small of back, with
the statement God is the strength of my life. Return
to the central station with the same prayer. Then
ascend to the power center with the word I am
peaceful and poised in divine power. Return to the
great central station with the same word. Then go
to the imagination center with the thought / am
created in the image and after the likeness of God.
Return to the center of being with the same thought.
Follow the next ray to the understanding center with
the word My understanding is of God. Return with
the same word to the central station. Then follow
the next ray to the will center with the word My
will is to obey God's will. Return to the center of
being with the same prayer. Next go to the order

tion. Then follow the next ray of light to the zeal
center with the prayer I am zealous in my endeavor
to work in perfect accord with infinite wisdom.
Return to the solar center with the same prayer.
Next go to the elimination center with the affirma
tion I gladly let go of the old and lay hold of the
new. Return to the central station with the same
affirmation. Then follow the next ray of light to
the life center with the prayer My life is hid with
Christ in God. Return to the great solar center with
the same declaration. When approaching the life
center, lower part of abdomen, always first take up
the thought of Jesus Christ purity and power. At
the close of the exercise allow the Presence to dwell
at the central solar station in the region of the car
diac and solar plexuses while you repeat the Lord's
Prayer:
"Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy
name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven
our debtors. And leave us not in temptation, but
deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and
the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen."

is descending as new inspiration, dealing in perfect
order with the ascending earthly flow, and that there
is perfect relaxation in mind and body. Then realiz
ing that the exercise is completed, behold yourself
as a spiritual being, clothed in the Lord's body,
firmly established in your I am power and dominion,
all the twelve faculties finding expression through
the great solar station, the radiations therefrom fill
ing the breast with new life and inspiration. Your
feet planted on the firm rock of spiritual under
standing, behold yourself a new creature open only
to the good.
Nothing is truly ours until we express it. No new
power is ours until we send it forth into the world.
That which we gain in these exercises must be
given forth. Remember that Jesus Christ walked
and talked and lived with mankind. "We all, with
unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of
the Lord, are transformed into the same image from
glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit."

The Twelve Powers of Man
According
to Charles Fillmore man has twelve God-
_ given faculties to aid him in his spiritual develop
ment. They are faith, strength, wisdom, love, power,
imagination, understanding, will, order, zeal, elimination,
and life. He explains how to combine and exercise these
superpowers to bring one's highest good into manifestation,
and he states that joy, glory, and eternal life are promised
to those who use these powers wisely and unselfishly.
The Twelve Powers of Man should be studied in con
junction with Christ Enthroned in Man.

(Continued from front flap)
says that faith knows nothing less
than supreme assurance, and that
the faith consciousness, once es
tablished, is constantly fed from
the very fount of faith and
continually grows stronger and
stronger.
Strength is the next faculty to
be considered, and the author de
clares that the realization of the
Jesus Christ presence as sustain
ing strength is a stronghold in the
consciousness of man that fortifies
him against all adverse condi
tions.
Next come wisdom and love,
which should always go hand in
hand, says Mrs. Fillmore, for
when combined they produce
peace and poise. A chapter is
given to each of the remaining
faculties: power, imagination, un
derstanding, zeal, and so forth.
In conclusion the author again
emphasizes the importance of first
calling forth the Christ mind and
then the twelve fundamental
ideas in Divine Mind. But she says
that nothing is truly ours until we
express it; no new power is ours
until we make use of it in the
world. She reminds us therefore
that what we get from this book
must be given forth. With each
chapter she outlines an exercise
to help you put into practice the
ideas that you gain from it.
