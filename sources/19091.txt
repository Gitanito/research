you
you
my name is Paula Harris and I&#39;m an
international photojournalist and I&#39;m
very honored today to be in Toronto
Canada May 7 2010 to interview the
Honorable Paul Hellyer it&#39;s been a
pleasure to return to Canada after my
2005 interview with Paul when he talked
about several controversial issues one
being the UFO question and the lack of
transparency in the government cover-up
but today we are very honored because
Paul has written two books and we&#39;re
going to discuss them on camera and they
are led at the end of the tunnel a
survival plan for the human species and
that&#39;s the book that will also encompass
the et UFO question among other real
serious world issues and Paul&#39;s book on
a miracle and waiting economics that
make sense in this book for Paul is a
real masterpiece of economics he&#39;s done
a great deal of study on this so these
are the two books that have just been
released in the debut of these two books
and Paul is kindly consented to answer a
few questions questions that all of us
have for him Oh 2005 was an important
year for you several things happened in
2005 the last time I was here and since
we&#39;re talking about light at the end of
the tunnel the book was that part of
your thinking in 2005 that you would
come out with a book and would you talk
a little bit about that year no I at
that time had no idea that I would write
this book it didn&#39;t take too long after
that to decide that I wanted to write
sort of a final book as a legacy but in
2005 I was still getting over the death
of my late wife Ellen and sort of living
alone and decided to ask the widow of my
best friend ever Bill Bashar if she
would consider marrying me she had been
a widow for 10 years
and she said yes so we planned our
wedding for October the 1st 2005 and
that is the year that I really got
interested in the extra-terrestrial
presence and technology really for the
first time I had been Minister of
National Defense in Canada and have
received reports on sightings you know
which said this one was natural
phenomenon this one&#39;s was not explained
but never really been into it but that
year I read Colonel Corsos book a day
after Roswell and came to the conclusion
that it was real and that this was an
important issue and so I made a
statement at an extra politics composed
him at the University of Toronto and
said UFOs are as real as the planes
flying over your head and that it&#39;s time
that the United States government
started coming clean on what it&#39;s all
about
because they&#39;re very important military
and and economic issues that have to be
addressed and how can you address a
question which relates to a subject that
people don&#39;t even exist will won&#39;t admit
it exists we pick up that last question
that last line no um
how can you discuss a question which the
United States government doesn&#39;t
officially recognize as a as being on
the radar you all you told me also in an
informal conversation that you thought
this was going to be one-shot deal you
thought you were just going to appear
and I think it was University of Toronto
and and ask the important questions that
you asked and make the important
statements that you made and then all at
once and you know five years later were
still is it intriguing you is this what
I had no idea
see this speech was made just a week
before I got married and I asked my
future bride if it was okay and she was
she was hesitant she was reluctant but I
said well this is just be a one-off shot
I want to get this out in the open for
for discussion and she said okay
go ahead well little did I dream where
it was going to lead because of course
after I was public then people wanted to
talk to me and I wanted to do some
research I have been saying that I was
just in the kindergarden of UFO
knowledge in 2005 I probably in grade
five or six now after doing a lot of
research in the intervening five years
and I have read many many books and I
now know more about the subject than a
majority of people and I felt when I
thought of writing another book as a
legacy that I should include a chapter a
primer really on the subject of the
extra-terrestrial presence and
technology and also to make a plea for
full disclosure because the implications
of what has been going on secretly
secretly in the last 50 or 60 years are
really profound and most people have any
idea how important the revelations could
be to their future as a as a species
how you said you became very interested
in the question because of policy issues
and sociological issues and your book
light at the end of the tunnel a
survival plan for the human species has
has actual first-hand information
because you spoke to quite a few people
some of the people that you spoke to her
people like Travis Walton fire in the
sky Colonel halt from the Bentwaters
case in England a nickel who worked for
the Ministry of Defence in England a dr.
Edgar Mitchell Apollo 14 astronaut
Shirley MacLaine and several other
people who are firsthand um sources for
the whole UFO question it isn&#39;t just
that you read the books would you tell
me while you were speaking to all these
people what was going on in your mind
and which person you found the most not
shocking that the most impressive of all
your your research well when you use the
word impressive they were all impressive
so I wouldn&#39;t want to single up one for
that I first of all as you know was
briefed by a number of very
knowledgeable people including dr.
Steven Greer who gave me a three-hour
briefing on the people that he had
assembled the 400 con contacts of people
from all walks of life who knew much
from personal experience about this
subject and then as I went along I
wanted to talk to other people and for
example I wanted to interview a couple
of contactees and they include Travis
Walton whose story was just you know
tremendously interesting and I talked to
him for a long while over a couple of
days and was totally convinced that he
was telling the truth but you learn a
lot from talking these people he had a
heck of a time when he was ducked off
five days later from after his abduction
convincing people that it wasn&#39;t all a
ruse and he said the division was about
50/50 about half of his friends and
relatives believed him in about
didn&#39;t so it took him a long while to
recover psychologically from the
experience another contact II that I
interviewed great length was Jim sparks
and Jim was has been abducted probably
more times more often than anybody
else&#39;s that I&#39;ve talked to and he was
tremendously and interesting because at
the outset he would fight these people
and and swear at them and do all of
these things eventually became - he came
to the point where he trusted them and
they trusted him and he got a lot of
information and he wrote a book about
his experience and he gave me permission
to use one of the most interesting
quotes from that book of several pages
actually of a dialogue he had with the
with the extraterrestrials in which they
indicated their concern about what was
happening on earth that we were
following up our rivers in our lakes and
following up the air that we breathe
with particles and really destroying our
natural environment and they&#39;re
concerned about this and they wanted him
to tell the world about it and so they
they of course encouraged him to pass
the word along which he&#39;s been doing
both in lectures and and through his
book but also to to plump for amnesty
for a lot of people in the event that
the government does decide to open up
the windows a little bit and let the
light shine in and the reason for that
was because some of the people involved
in the in what they call the black
operations of the reverse engineering of
the technology that came from the
crashes and another contact with the
extraterrestrials is is so interesting
and so secret that certain elements of
the United States government wanted to
keep it secret even from their political
leaders and they&#39;ve been working
underground for years and years and
years
and heaven only knows what they&#39;ve
accomplished but in my opinion it would
be a very great deal and certainly one
of the things that that I want to know
is whether in fact they have have
developed exotic fuels like zero-point
energy and cold fusion as some people
who have worked there have indicated
that they have because this is the way
that we could transform our world in the
timeframe that may be 10 years or so and
and save it from global warming and of
course the other thing I say in the book
is that even if that is not true that
the extraterrestrials would give us that
technology if we ask them to because
they want us to save our world as a
habitable place for ourselves and for
their business these are some very
incredible witnesses and Stephen where
you mentioned the disclosure project of
2009 where he has military people apart
from you know military intelligence
people who are involved so this is a
real cover-up it&#39;s not something or
inventing and it&#39;s very complicated Paul
isn&#39;t it because the United States
government still has not admitted the
Roswell was real we&#39;re still an oval
balloon with crashed have studies no
they&#39;re still maintaining the the
fantasy that it was a balloon and it
said you know so many people know that
that&#39;s a lie hey can I cut here if you
have to kind of repeat the information
and her question otherwise people you&#39;re
talking about Roswell oh so he was
talking but he did eat it he didn&#39;t
mention Roswell so we don&#39;t know okay so
what will happen is you will keep my
question in there right um maybe one but
I mean I have the mic on him you know
I&#39;m picking it up but it&#39;s not it&#39;s we
can do it however you want okay okay
just say in the Roswell is today you&#39;re
correct
hmm okay cameras rolling in the case of
the Roswell crash for example they still
claim that it didn&#39;t happen but there
were
witnesses of all kinds who say it did
and the cover-up that was in fact a lie
and that&#39;s what I call it in my book and
they started working on on
reverse-engineering immediately after
that and had some of the best brains in
the United States working on it and have
had ever since so the distance they have
come in 60 years or more as is a I&#39;m
sure incredible and that they have
developed of probably spaceships and
they have probably developed exotic
fuels and there are all sorts of things
that the United States people and the
people the world have a right to know
about and that&#39;s the reason that we
should never give up until there is full
disclosure but this has to be done by by
Congress this has to be done by the
people who have been funding them
without knowing what they were funding
because it&#39;s not something that one
person would want to undertake on their
own say the president for example
because I think it&#39;s just too dangerous
but then once they they decide to go
this route they should grant an amnesty
as Jim sparks suggested after talking to
the extraterrestrials and so that people
will be able to talk honestly under oath
and not fear the consequences if they
have committed some sort of major minor
crime in the course of their careers
now the Edgar Mitchell Apollo 14
astronaut has gone before the Washington
press club and said Roswell was real
that he was briefed plus the fact that
we had the 2001 disclosure project in
Washington DC all those witnesses the
Steven Greer brought together we
couldn&#39;t have more witnesses what do you
think is the blockage for full
disclosure and because other countries
have come out with the fact that there
is a UFO presence and that there are
documents and there are sightings other
countries have done it what do you think
is the blockage well the the blockage I
think is really a desire on the part of
a very small group of the United States
to
keep a lot of Secrets of themselves but
not to share them with either other
people in their own country or or with
the world and why they&#39;re doing this
whether there&#39;s a a financial advantage
to the United States or financial
advantage to the oil industry for
example of keeping the existence of
exotic fuels secret I can&#39;t say for sure
but I&#39;m pretty sure that there is
there&#39;s somebody that&#39;s benefiting or
think that they&#39;re benefiting from the
power or the advantage monetary
advantage of meaning maintaining this
exclusive little Club that they&#39;ve got
which knows a lot of things that the
rest of us don&#39;t know do you look at the
whole extraterrestrial question as a
benign question because people that do
are and they know are in two camps good
and bad or evil and good
extraterrestrial presence how do you
look at it isn&#39;t that it isn&#39;t is it not
so that if it were not a benign in some
way they may have done something to us
long ago when we invented the atom bomb
or yeah I think they&#39;re benign but
they&#39;re as you well know several species
that we know about and of course the
United States government sometimes has
told people that there&#39;s one species
that is not but they never said who it
is or which one and consequently there&#39;s
no way of checking it out with this kind
without this kind of disclosure that
we&#39;re demanding because they may just be
putting us putting us on as an excuse
for spending hundreds of billions of
dollars into armed Earth against the
extraterrestrials and this is I think
something that bothers me a lot of
concerns me Oh tell me you know so many
people in the know like astronauts
military people you as its Minister of
Defense want to address this question
and even the Vatican has come forth and
made the statement that the et is our
brother and sister
what Oh how do you think that we can
approach this with the general public so
that there is no panic and no pressure
and no change in the status quo or do
you think there will be a change in
aesthetic well I think the public is
prepared to accept it certainly if it is
revealed in in layers and not all in one
fell swoop because it takes getting used
to I went through this to you you start
out knowing a little bit and saying well
this is fine and and these people are
benign and they&#39;ve got a lot to teach us
and one of the things that comes through
loud and clear from all the research
that I&#39;ve done that they are in fact
more spiritual than we are that we&#39;re
less spiritually advanced than they are
and so we should look out at them not
ascend ax me but as brothers and sisters
and and try and work with them for our
own benefit and theirs as well
but I think you know you have talked to
a lot of people who realize that at some
stage this UFO file was turned over to
industry and the US government lost
control of it
and ever since then which and it&#39;s a
long time back it goes right back to
Eisenhower&#39;s day and this was the reason
he was so concerned about the
military-industrial complex he said that
we should beware of them and and keep an
eye on because they would do things that
were in their interests and not
necessarily in our interests and and
this I I believe is exactly what has
happened that a small group of people
benefit from this aura of fear and you
know dr. Carol rosin as I do and she
worked with Verner von Braun
for some time and he kept warning her
after he sort of mellowed that this
industrial military complex had to have
an enemy in order to justify such huge
military expenditures when people are
starving all over the world and dying
from lack of medical care and so on and
he said first it will be the Communists
and they had a good run at the
communists then he said it will be the
terrorists and now they&#39;re having a good
run at the terrorists and then he said
it will be the extraterrestrials and now
they&#39;re trying to get money to establish
a base on the moon and do other things
which some of us feel is is probably
more military oriented than it is
scientifically oriented at least as much
so and without really the American
people ever having given sanction they
have no mandate to do that no government
has run on the on a platform of spending
public money for the militarization of
space on the contrary I think most
people say hey this is a this is a
common area it should be available for
the utilization of all mankind and for
the betterment of all mankind but we&#39;ve
got this roadblock as long as a small
well I call them cabal in the book who
are the hard core of the shadow
government that everyone talks about
which I also talked about the book
refused to come clean and I think
they&#39;re going to have to come clean at
some stage and Congress is the is the
organization that&#39;s going to have to
force them to do that and if your book
is very comprehensive because you talk
about all of these and and the way we
should approach other civilizations in
the world and you use as the most
powerful phrase the golden rule can you
give us some ideas how we can change our
worldview so that we are not a warring
species killing each other
we are not judgemental over people that
do not look like us to live like
and you imagine it over aliens and how
can you give us some ideas how this can
be accomplished because I know this is
your passion well I think we live in an
unhappy world where many things are
going wrong and I start my book out by
saying I think we have about 10 years to
turn around and convert from fossil
fuels to a new exotic energy or energies
not the 30 or 40 years that all the
politicians are talking about because
that in my opinion will probably be too
late
and the global warming will proceed to
the to the point where some countries
are devastated like Bangladesh for
example which could wind up underwater
and many of the Pacific Islands and
maybe eventually Manhattan who knows and
so this work were headed hell-bent for
our own destruction if we don&#39;t change
and yet you go back and read history and
I have a section on this and almost
every major religion at some stage has
taken on some other major religion and
attempted to kill them off or some of
them while at the same time proclaiming
and their you know their basic rules
that they believe in treating other
people the way they would want to be
treated and yet in action can they do
just the opposite and I&#39;m calling for
your forgiveness where all of the people
who have fought others over the last two
thousand years or more forgive whoever
did it and it&#39;s two ways in almost every
case and then start cooperating in
building the kingdom of God which I
define as a world where everybody has
enough to eat and some clean water to
drink and a roof over their head of
clothes to be decent and sufficient
access to education to give them a
reasonable opportunity to be able to use
their skills creatively and this would
produce really the kind of world that
that where we all talk about and dream
about and hope about but do very
little about and it&#39;s interesting if you
want to go back to the UFO thing for a
minute but one of the early Canadian
pioneers in this field Wilbur Smith who
had access to information from the star
visitors is some of us like to call them
said that we&#39;ve reached the stage and
certainly he got this from them where we
have to choose between good and evil and
if we keep on doing evil against our
fellow man in the generic sense the
world is doomed
whereas if on the other hand we were to
choose doing good
in all of the ways that are open to us
especially with all of this technology
then we could create a world which of
which would be absolutely stunning in
the opportunities that it provides for
for everyone so this is the point that
we&#39;re at and I think the X interests
really are very very interested in which
way we go whether we go forward which I
would say was the way of cooperation or
whether we just keep on saying well my
power or my my wish to be president of
this country or to be the dictator of
this country or whatever is such so
strong and I have such a reason for it
that I&#39;ll be glad to use armed forces to
to kill my enemies and lock them up if
they get too powerful and so on in other
words the things that we&#39;ve been doing
and are still continuing to do in many
parts of the world your book is very
very personal the area of the exotic
alternatives to fossil fuels the area of
world political cooperation using the
golden rules because you you tend to put
yourself in the other person&#39;s moccasins
and the revamping of the planetary
monetary system and transparency in
government of those things I mentioned
can you talk to me about the thing the
one issue that&#39;s near and dear to your
heart and finally tell us how maybe we
could
well the the issue that is most urgent
at the moment is changing the moderate
world monetary system the banking system
and this is a long story and I know you
don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time on it
but it is critically important the
banking system that we have is to put it
bluntly legalized fraud to put it in
bold terms and we have to change it for
the benefit of all there are many things
in my book that you will know from
having read it where I talk about the
world being run by a very small group of
elite people who are immensely wealthy
and who want to stay that way they want
to have the stranglehold on the
resources in the wealth of the world and
so they have introduced globalization
which really hasn&#39;t benefited anybody
except them a tangible way and and they
want to keep a banking system which has
brought more than 25 recessions and
depressions the United States the last
120 years and now after one of the most
serious meltdowns well this is the most
serious meltdown since the Great
Depression they&#39;re there pretending that
they&#39;re fixing the system and they&#39;re
not they&#39;re just it&#39;s just a pretense
and they&#39;re pretending to slap the hands
of the bankers who are responsible for
it and it is just a tap in the hand it&#39;s
like finding a prostitute $20 for being
on the street knowing that she&#39;s going
to go back out the next night and earn
more than that and the banks are doing
exactly the same thing they&#39;re just
laughing all the way to their balls so
this is a this is a profound area maybe
might be interesting if I could just go
through a bit of the history for in
maybe three or four minutes or five I
just go back to the to the time when
King William was fighting a war ran out
of money somebody said well one
to get some more money is to start a
bank so we got the rich people of
England to to prescribe subscribe a
million two hundred thousand pounds in
gold and silver and lend it all to the
government f at eight percent which is a
pretty high interest rate for government
guaranteed loan but that&#39;s the way
things go and then to show their
gratitude the government allowed in the
bank to print another million two
hundred thousand pounds in banknotes and
lend it to their friends at high
interest rates so in other words they
were allowed to lend the same money
twice
well when over the years through the
greed of the bankers and the cooperation
used a polite word of politicians and
that ratio has increased dramatically in
the early years of the 20th century the
federal banks of the United States had
to have a gold reserve of 25 percent
which meant that they could lend the
same money four times in my early years
in Canada they had to have a cash
reserve of eight percent which meant
they could lend the same money twelve
and a half times and today with this new
system of capital adequacy which isn&#39;t
really if adequacy at all it should be
capital in adequacy they are lending the
same money 20 times and collecting
interest on at each time now that is
just that is just legalized fraud and
the fact that as a tiny minority rich
people can get away with it I think is a
disgrace so I&#39;ve been saying we have to
reduce that ratio of 20 to one to say
three to one and reduce the amount of
the the proportion of money that banks
that create from nearly a monopoly to
I&#39;m suggesting two thirds so that
governments who own the patent on behalf
of the people can print a third of the
money thirty-four percent is the figure
that I use in the book and use that to
balance their budgets and pay for health
care and pay for the transition from a
loyal economy to something that would
save the world from global warming and
do other things that are essentially you
know like providing basic food and
shelter for people all over the world of
giving the poor people a bit of a break
so this is what&#39;s got to happen and I
hope it happens sooner rather than later
because if it doesn&#39;t then what is going
to happen is that will go for another
five or ten or fifteen years and have
another meltdown and a few more million
people will lose their jobs and their
houses and their businesses and the
thing goes on and on until somebody
really does something about it and it&#39;s
going to take a lot of guts to stand up
to the banking industry because there
are a tough bunch and they would spend
bins to keep this from happen but at the
same time it would be the greatest
service to mankind that any leader or
group of leaders could do and I just
hope and pray that they will get at it
try and understand how the system works
which very few people do but which you
can learn a few hours and then make the
change and give the world a break you
have said in the beginning of the book
that we are hell-bent on destruction and
you have also delineated a lot of the
crisis in the planet including the UFO
cover-up and the economic problem and
the spiritual problem that we do not
accept each other and aren&#39;t still
warring about this if you were to give a
message to the young people a legacy
that you wanted to leave something that
would help them change the status quo
and enter this new world as you and I
look at it
what would be your advice on a very
basic level my advice to the young
people of the world would be it has to
start with individuals I used to
describe the sort of thing like a beach
if the majority of the grains of sand
and the beach are clean it will look
beautiful golden and be very hospitable
if the majority are covered with oil
slick dirty or translated into the wider
problem evil or uncaring or
self-centered then you have a dirty
Beach which is very unattractive and
that is much of what&#39;s going on in the
world today we have very little personal
integrity every time you pick up a paper
somebody&#39;s ripping off somebody the
government officials are ripping off the
people or some people are trying to rip
off the government by not paying their
taxes or something to show that they&#39;re
going in the opposite way - what we have
to go but this has to start with
individual people and it has to come
from the bottom up not from the top down
oil I must say that you know good
leadership is very important and if you
can get somebody with high moral and
ethical standards at the top this will
rub off on some of the some of the
younger people but basically the young
people have to change the world one at a
time
individually and try to make their motto
motto - leave the world in a little
better place than when they found it and
if everyone does that they&#39;ll plant a
tree or two or pick up a can or two or
do whatever is necessary donate a dollar
or two for somebody else&#39;s in worst
situation than they are and then if
enough people do that they will then put
the political political pressure on the
leaders to make the macro changes that
are essential to change the monetary
system and to stop global warming and do
to do the other things that have to be
done to in effect save the world
