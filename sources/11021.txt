  		              		Experience Description   

    It had been 7 years since my relationship with my ex-partner. I left him when a new companion arrived at my work.   Around this time, I was also overwhelmed from studying for a new career and  working. 
  
      A week  immediately before the accident, my car was having mechanical problems. But I was alone, my family was on holiday, and I didn't really think the car problems were  too important.
  
  That Monday when I went to work, the steering wheel vibrated a little. I tried to ignore it because I just wanted to get to work as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I needed to  go to my new flat later that afternoon, but I realized that I had left my keys in the flat. I decided to  get the keys before going to work, so I was really rushing.
  
  The steering wheel continued to vibrate, when suddenly, I heard what sounded like a bomb going off. I was able to stop the car and  pull over to the  hard shoulder of the road. As I got  out of the car, cars were speeding by and blowing their horns at me. I saw that my right, rear wheel  had a blow out. I wasn't sure what to do next.  Finally, I decided the safest thing to do would be to stay in the car. I got in the car and I started to look in the glove compartment for the mobile phone.

  The next thing I remember was seeing was people with their face covered in blood. I thought they must have died in auto accidents. They were looking at me. 

  A bright light  came to my side. I was part of this light and  everything was light. I felt a deep peace  that I had never experienced on earth.  I had no weight. I felt  alive and free. 

I had a life review that moved at the speed of a ray of light. I saw images telling me about my loved ones and that I had died.  I saw my family was desolate, but I didn't want to return. I said, 'I want to stay here.' Then a male voice asked me, 'Do you wanted to leave your earthly life?' I replied, 'The love of my loved ones left her.' The quiet voice then said to me, 'You have to return. Your time hasn't come. You are leaving this place and learn to value yourself.' My earthly life was in chaos, yet he knew that this motivation would make it easier for me to return.

  I saw myself in a stretcher as they put me in am ambulance.  When I woke up I couldn't remember anything like what had happened, who people were, where I had gone, nor where I had come from. A man in the ambulance was speaking on the phone with my mother.  he told her that I was in an accident, but that I was well.  Little by little, my memories came back.  I tried to move my legs and thought, 'Good, I can walk.'

  Afterwards, they told me the accident had happened at 15.55pm. When I looked at my watch just before the accident, it was 15.50pm.  The accident must've have been 5 minutes in duration. The time I spent on the other side was as if it was a whole hour. 

The man who hit me, said that he saw my car in the distance and thought it was going moving.  He realized too late that I was stopped and he couldn't go anywhere to avoid a collision.  He hit my car from behind in the right hand part of the car.  It turns out that he was from my village, he had known my mother all his life, he had my surname name although no relation to me.  However, the people at the hospital assumed that we were family.

      My car came to rest on the other side of the motorway. The two vehicles were totalled. My car had the boot completely smashed up and the passenger door was smashed up inside on the passenger seat. All the windows were also smashed.  The only part of the car that was intact was the drivers seat where I had been sitting. The trauma workers had said that it had been a miracle I was still alive. They ran tests suspecting ecephalic-cranial trauma, but they found nothing. I had broken rib and edema in my right foot. 

      About 3 and a half months after the accident I asked to be voluntarily discharged from the hospital to get back to work despite learning in the NDE that the boy at work was not going to value me.  Yet, I felt such deep peace with this decision. After the NDE, the chaos of my life continued. There was so much chaos, that I hardly gave any attention to my NDE.    					  


Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 07/09/2009  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes  Accident         Other: Injuries from a car accident.  Yes I was driving on the motorway at 120 Km/h in the fast lane. Suddenly the right-hand back tire burst. I managed to stop the car and go onto the hard shoulder, but the hard shoulder was very narrow and impinged on the traffic flow. I put on the hazard lights and went into the car to find a phone to call for help.  Then a car doing 120 Km/h hit the back of my car. I wasn't wearing a seat belt because I didn't think I needed to. The car was stopped and didn't have the airbags inflated.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I lost awareness of my body  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I knew I was so much more than my physical body living in  my current life. I also know that returning to my body  wasn't that important, as I would soon be with my loved ones. I learned that my natural state is light, peace and love. I had no physical form because  I was light energy.  I understood that on earth you can never feel the peace I felt because life has so many uncertainties and lessons, that keep you on edge and alert. The remarkable thing is that I was only there for  5 minutes of Earth time, and I was an hour there. Time doesn't pass in the same way there.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         At the moment that I was in the light and  I was the light. I knewthat I was going to die, but I was totally at peace and  in a state of total acceptance. I felt wonderful. It wasn't important to worry about my loved ones and I was very clear that I didn't want to return.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual.     The accident was 5 minutes but for me the experience lasted an hour. Here, time passes slower.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I had no sensation of vision because I had no physical form. There was  a very intense and peaceful white light, and I was part of this light.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      The communication was telepathic. A Being spoke to me, but I couldn't see him.   

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     Arriving it was like being on a giant toboggan that went down at a great speed. When I was rising up, I didn't remember well because  I felt stricken by the light.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Everything I saw was light. It was like very bright, white fog and I was part of it. The light was love and peace, and these were my feelings. I felt better than I have ever felt before. It was like being in Nirvana.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I thought I was in Heaven and  surrounded by white clouds of brilliant, white colors.  

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         At the beginning, I saw people who had died in accidents. I felt uncertain at first, but then I felt an immense acceptance of all that is. I felt an intense love and tremendous peace. It felt so good that I didn't want to return. Here, the physical body is like a prison. It is heavy and so dense it hurts.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  Yes, I didn't want to return. I felt too good, but they sent me back again against my will. They told me, 'Your time has not yet come, you must go back; you are very strong.' And I thought, 'I am very strong?' This was what I needed to hear because  I have had many lessons in those 10 years.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      No comment.   My outlook on life is more spiritual. I feel that all religions are helpers to reach the same goal, which is love. I do  believe in a divine plan.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

  What is your religion now?         No comment.   My opinion continues to be the same as 10 years ago. I don't like dogmas. I like to be free and I think of myself as eclectic. I think all religions say the same thing but they are different paths to the same thing - love.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I have always believed in reincarnation and that we are something more than the physical body. I belive that the purpose of our lives is to learn, teach, and to evolve to get to the place of love. This experience confirmed my beliefs.  

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain     The feeling it left me with was that of preferring to return to this state more than to be here in life with disappointments and suffering. I don't know if this is better or worse, or if I didn't fully understand the reason why I had to return.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I listened to what could have been a man's female-sounding voice or a  masculine woman's voice. I wasn't clear whether it was a man's voice or a woman's voice; it could have been either. It was a voice with authority, that sounded clear and firm. We communicated telepathically and I never saw the Being. It asked me questions, and then seemed to consult some files. He could see it wasn't my time, because to begin with it asked me what lessons did I take with me, and had I died? Then he said that I had to return. It left me feeling they had made a mistake or some other glitch? I don't know.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Uncertain     They asked me how had I lived my life this time, from which I deduced I had had many lives.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     During the whole experience, I felt that everything was one, everything is light and I am part of this light.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     They gave me the order that I had to go back, with which I deduce that there is a bigger plan and if there is a plan somebody has to direct it.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Uncertain.     I suppose 'yes', now that they had told me I had to return because my time had not come. It was because there was something more I had to do here. Something I am not clear on, but that I have to do and  that they didn't really specify.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists          They asked me how I had lived my life and from this I deduced I had had many lives.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Uncertain     They told me that I had to come back because  there was something to do. They told me  that I was very strong, as if for this I had to stay strong because life was never going to be a bed of roses.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     When they asked me what was taking me from this life, I answered that the love of the people that I left in it. Up there I felt love and  I was pure love.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life.     There had always been a doubt if what I saw was real or did I imagine it. Because of this, some of the answers to the questions I am not 100% convinced. Three years after the accident, in 2012, I had a waking up of my consciousness. There are things that I read, and they made me remember what had happened in my experience.  For example, many years later when I read that we are all one, I thought that the uniqueness I had experienced in my NDE as I said we are all light and love - I also experienced this. Nowadays, my spiritual life is important to me, but I have only told the story of NDE a few times. I feel I want to share it, and because of that I am now telling it to you.  

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain After the experience everything remained the same such as my relationships and my chaotic life.

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember the entire experience, completely as if it had been yesterday.  I think I will never forget it as long as I live.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          All of the experience was significant. The thing that caught my attention was the synchronicity of the previous day singing the song of the 7th September which is our anniversary and of the man that hit me, having the same surname and was from my village, and knew my mother…  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Uncertain    I have shared my experience a few times, only at the right time and with the right settings.  

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   I had read something on the subject, but very little.  Yes, I had heard we go through a tunnel, and see a light, that we see beings that have passed on... and very little more.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real     .The experience I had was very real, but I always had the doubt was it really real or if it was just a dream.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably real.     I keep thinking that.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   When they spoke of love oneness and peace, I remember the experience.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I believe that I have covered everything.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         It has been very extensive, and very good as it is.
