My husband was helping me to take a shower because I couldn't do it by myself since I had a c'sarean four days ago. I had a daughter who survived 30 minutes because she had respiratory failure. I was very weak and depressed. I felt how the blood pressure was going down, so I asked my husband to hold me. That is the last thing I remember.

Everything was dark and silence. All of a sudden, I heard girl children laughing, the sound was very sweet but I couldn't see anything. Afterwards the clarity started, I saw the girls smiling and running around me. In some way, I knew my daughter was there, and then I felt so much happiness I smiled and felt I was falling into a very happy state that didn't let me react. I don't know how much time passed; when I was smiling, I heard a very strong yell. It was my husband calling my name, he was shaking me on the floor, my parents, who were also there with my husband, and they all thought I was dead.
