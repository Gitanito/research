GENERAL ANswers to the EN1c MAs.
1. On the Enigmas : by Mr. R. Dutton, Kingſky.
Davus's Cork's done to a tittle;
Day's Penknife alſo doth excel;
Of Dutton's Water I’ll ſay little;
}G. has play’d his muſic well;
fitt his letter A has veil'd ;
And Mrs. Lean the Cent'ry paſt;
Smart has his Pin, with wit conceal’d ;
And Wesdon's Gaiters are in taſte;
Wells's Net entangles, all confeſs;
And Woolſton's Kiſs charms like his
verſe.
2. To Lady Diz by M. I. Farrow.
Hail, fair maid, all praiſe be thine;
Long Inay'ſt thou in Britain ſhine, P
With graces ſtill becoming :
Altho’ thou'rt in thy icoth year,
No ſpot nor wrinkle doth appear,
But ever freſh and blooming.
For each new year, freſh beauties riſe,
To charm the ſenſe, and pleaſe the
eyes,
On Cork, Penknife, or Gaiters;
Thy fame, be it extended more,
From ſea to ſea, from ſhore to ſhore;
Nor Net in troubled Waters.
The balmy Kiſs, the ſubtil flame,
Extend their pow'rs o'erall the frame;
A genial warmth diffuſes.
Thy laur-l'd brows, thy flowing
heights,
May rival Pindar's lofty flights,
Thou fifter of the muſes.
I’ve noted long thy growing name,
Thy modeſt, chaſte, thy glowing fame;
Each year adds to thy graces; -
As old ones drop, new vot’ries riſe,
Ambitious all to gain the prize,
With quick, but gentle paces.
3. To Mafter A. M. by Mrs. Mary H.
Dear A. M. to the Water's fide,
Bring quick thy fiſhing Net ;
And Gaiters may be well applied,
To guard from cold and wet.
No Sounds in air do rain preſage,
To interrupt our bliſs; -

Of ev'nings, when the ſultry ſun
Beneath the weſt has ſet,
When clear the murm'ring Waters

And gently place it in the brook,
4 ſcaly fry to catch;
Or, with my angle, line and book,
The nodding Cork I watch.
But when ſtern winterlocks the plains
Within his cold embrace,
And, binds the ſtream in icy chains,
My Gauer, on I lace : * * *

With Penknife well the Cork prepare;
Thy fiſh will gain a Kiſs. -
Returning home, I’ll buy ſome Pins,

Such ſports as theſe let me enjoy;
And when return’d at night,

Or eke an anſwer write.

Poffeſs'd of theſe, I ſhall not care

5. The Generous Pedlar : by Mr. Tho. Keeton, Market-Deeping.
Altho' unknown to you, friend Smart,
Thou ſurely haſt an honeſt heart;
Therefore my muſe her tribute pays
o you, who merits all our praiſe;
To you, whºſe ſweet engaging lines,
In which or wit or learning ſhines;
But pauſe, perhaps I may offend,
Both Lady Di-and Dia's friend ;
Therefore with Pins and Gaiters neat,
And Penknives new and quitecomplete,
I'll travel all the country round;
There, often to the muſic's Sound,
I'll make the laſſes dance and ſing ;
And when the bottlesCork'd they bring,
I'll give them Nets to boil their greens,
With care interpret all their dreams;
I'll give them Kiſses for their ſwains,
To eaſe them of their loveſick pains.
But now I fear I ſhall be out;
Oh, no! the letter A no doubt,
With Cen'try loft, and Water clear,
Will tell the whole for preſent year.

6. The Same: by Mrs. Blanch Lean, of Ludgvan.
Another year has circled round,

Of Cork, Net, Penknife, or ſuch toys,

How vain and frail are worldly joys.
As Waters down the channels run,
Eager to find their parent ſea;
So we, ere life's ſhort thread is ſpun,
Are haſt'ning to eternity.
Soon, ſoon alas! priz'd beauty fades,
And ſoon diſeaſe, or age invades,
Soon fails our bark on life's ſwift
ſtream,
And all our boaſts of mortal bliſs
Fade like the mem'ry of a dream,
They fly like Dia's phantom Kiſs.
But there's a place above the ſkies,
Where angels and archangels fing,
Their hymns of praiſe for ever riſe
To heav'n's ſupreme eternal king :
What Sounds ſeraphic in that ſphere,
Shall burſt upon our raviſh'd ear !
Not Hybla, deck’d in all its ſweets,
Nor Tempe's vales and boaſted joys
Can vie with our laſt bleſt retreat,
If we attend to reaſon's voice. ,

In party-colour'd garment dreſt,

And Kiſs thy merry face.
Come with thy irrefiſtleſs pow'rs,
And ward my future happy hours
From meagre Care's chill blaſt;
O teach thy vot'ry how to charm
The breaſt with lively feelings warm,
Like bards of Centuries paſt. -
Be mine the arms thy Foote cou’d

To pierce the ſtately aſs-ſkin ſhield,
That gravity calls his ;
To whom ev’n Johnſon's pomp gave

Once thy attractions made him gay,
And loos'd his iron phiz. -
Not lamp dry'd wiſdom I requeſt,
Be mine the pow'rs thy Sterne poſſeſt,
Whatever he ſet eye on, -
Caught in his Net, with ſolemn gait,
How ſtern the follies ſtalk'd in ſtate |
Like Mackender's old lion.
Cºrk hearted nymph, 'tis thine togive
Such talents as in Pindar live,
Sans doute thy chiefeſt pride is;
To purge the phlegm from out the
age,
New pills we buy on each new page
A reaſon clear quid rides -
Eyewatery fancies ſuit me not,
They fit not to my face gad wot
To ſay they did, were lying;
It matters not to me one Pin,"
So I enjoy my fav'rite grin,
And ſhoot my prey while flying.
Keen Penknife wit and thou be mine,
To make life's dreary valley ſhine,
Then o'er ber thorns 1 bruſh light;
With fiddling drive gray Care along,
And chant full oft thy fav'rite ſong,
“The little farthing ruſh-light.”
Hither, ſweet laſfie, hie thy ways,
Add ſalt and pepper to my lays,
And then thy breath ſhall float 'em;
Rais'd high in air, the Sound may
reach z
Thy ſons, and draw a ſmile from each,
At Coventry and Gotham.
Then, whether long or ſhort my race,
I'll wear throughout a laughing face,
And when the buſineſs ends,
Thy remnants which I leave behind
May pleaſe the partners of my mind,
And entertain their friends.

impelled toward the centre, where the oppoſite motions cauſes it to claſh and
fly up with violence. By trying the experiment, I found that the quicker
the pipe was drawn along the edge of the glaſs, the quicker and ſtronger were
the vibrations, ſo as to cauſe the fluid to ſquirt out of the glaſs. But by
drawing the pipe a little ſlower along the edge of the glaſs, the vibrations
are not ſo frong, and the agitation of the water is diminiſhed, ſo as only to
riſe up the glaſs, without going over.

Some old maids are remarked to be fond of parrots, dogs, apes, &c. when
they have been ſlighted by, or diſappointed of the firſt objećt of their affec

So 'mong the Britons 'tis their choiceſt care,
To make me lovely from my very birth;

Once more, dear Di, the ſlowly rolling year,
Hasbrought thy long'd for natal minute near :
Rous’d at the thought, the muſe, who dormant long,
Nor twice fix moons has form'd one ſimple ſong,
Reſtrings with ardent zeal the ruſtic lyre,
Feels rapt’rous hope, and kindling fond deſire.

Be uſeful worth the baſis of the tale;
On that proud pillar let me take my ſtand,
From thence my fame, from thence reſpect command;
Nor beauteous ſhape, nor poliſh'd figure boaſt; -
External beauty charms one ſenſe at moſt.
For, know ye fair, tho' beauty pleaſe the eye,
Merit forbids that beauty e'er to die;
From thence our Britiſh maids derive their claim,

Drawn from the mine, of ſubſtance real, I prove
A metaphor in prudence and in love:
Should Strephon, favour'd youth, his tale impart
Of tender love, and charm your beating heart;
Should kindling paſſions fan the fond defire,
And equal love confeſs an equal fire,
Then, doubly then, my unreal merits prize,
Nor loſe the guard where all your treaſure lies!
Of matter made, tho’ not like yours the ſame,
Far, far more laſting than the mortal frame;
Your fragile forms the winter's cold deſtroys,
Not years of froſt my harden'd frame annoys;
In piercing heat weak man his breath refigns,
The fire I brave, the furnace but refines;
From this my ſhape, my ſtubborn nature gain,
To pleaſure dead, inſenſible to pain;
A lifeleſs engine in the weakeſt hand,
Can proudeſt tow’rs and ſtrongeſt forts command :
Poſſeſs'd of me, the nightly robbers ſpoil
The hard earn'd treaſures of long years of toil:
Me once reſign'd, the hapleſs city falls,
The conqueror plants his ſtandard on the walls;
Tho' troops of heroes bleed—of no avail J
I force the way when thund'ring cannons fail.
But what are theſe ?—mortality's vain boaſt,
The thrice crown'd conqueror and his bloody hoſt,
The peſt of ancient and of modern times,
High heaven's dread vengeance for a nation's crimes.—

Put a for the pendulum's length in inches, and alſo its number of vi

ches. Then, the number of vibrations being inverſely proportional to the
ſquare of the lengths, as va: ; v 39% :: 6o : x ; , hence, multiplying
extremes and means, x V w = 6ov 3%; and, by ſquaring, x * :

Theſame, by Mr J. H. Hearding, Adderbury School.
The lengths of pendulums are to one another reciprocally as the ſquares
of their vibrations made in the ſame time: therefore, putting x for the
length required, x : , 39 # :: 60 * : x *; hence, x 3 = 60 * x 39% =
140850, and x = */ 140850 - 52°o2982 inches.
The ſame, by Mr jos Kaye, Aldmonkury.
It is demonſtrated by mathematician's (Hutton's Courſe of Mathematics
vol. 2, p. 174, &c.) that the times of vibrations of pendulums are as the
ſquare root of their lengths; or the number of vibrations in a given time
reciprocally as the ſquare root of their lengths. Let x = the number of
vibrations in a minute, and alſo the length; then x* : 60% :: 394 : x ;
hence x3 = 60° x 39% = 1408;o , and x = y 140850 – 52-03, the
tequired icngth and number of vibrations in a minute.
The ſame, by Mr. Alexander Rowe, Reginnis.
Let x denote the pendulum's length. Then, by Dr. Hutton's Courſe,
vol. 2, pa. 176, as Vx : v 39; :: 60 : x ; mult. extremes and
means, x v × = 60 v 39; ; ſquaring, x3 = 60° x 39% ; hence,
</60° x 39% = 52'oz982 inches = 4’335818 feet, as required.

both ſquares. If a = 3, b = 2; then 120 and 169 are twoothers; &c.

XIII. QUEST Ion (1 IoI), anſ. by Mr. John Carr, the
Propoſer.
To enter fully into the nature of the ſeries, e (1 — B cos. 82 – C cos
72 – D cos. 32 Szc.), which Mr. Simpſon aſſumes for the reciprocal of
the moon's diſtance from the earth's centre, would require more room than
can be allotted to it in the Diary. I ſhall therefore briefly anſwer it in the
following manner. .
In the affumed ſeries, the quantities e, B, C, D, 8, y, 3, &c. are
all ſuppoſed to be conſtant quantities; it follows therefore, that when 2: re
turns to any given magnitude, the 12ciprocal of the diſtance, and conſcq .
the diſtance of itſelf, will always return to a correſponding given magnitude :
but this is impoſſible, on-account of the motion of the apoge, if z be meant
to expreſs the angular diſtance of the moon from a fixed point, which ſhe is
ſuppoſed to depart from ; and if z be ſuppoſed to expreſs the angular diſt
ance of the moon from the apoge, then it will have a different value from
the z uſed in finding the fluxionary equation of the orbit in the preceding part
of the work. Thoſe two therefore having different values cannot be pro
perly incorporated as if they had one and the ſame value, as is actually done
in the ſubſequent part of the work. -
On the former ſuppoſition therefore the aſſumed ſeries can expreſs the re
ciprocai of the diſtance only for one periodical revolution; and on the lat
ter ſuppofition the whole ofthe ſubſequent work muſt be erroneous. -
There is ſomething ſimilar to this at pa. 162 of that performance; where,
in order to expreſs the angular ciſtance of the moon from the ſun in terms
of z, (that the aſſumed forces may be compared with the time) the ſun and
moon are ſuppoſed to depart from a given line, a t the ſame time ; and, in
conſequence of that ſuppoſition, double the angu.ar dittance is ſuppoſed to
be p 2: ; where p = 2 (1 — m), and m the periodical time of the moon in
parts of a year. But here again it is piain that p 2 can express the double
- - at £ular
44 The Ladies’ Diary. 18o3.
angular diſtance ofthe moon from the ſun only for one revolution; it cannot
properly therefore be made the conſtant repreſentative of that diſtanc. . It
plainly appears then , from theſe confiderations, that the whole of that inge
nious, intricate, and elaborate performance, is limited to the aſcertain.ng
of the lunar orbit for one revolution of the moon only, from the time of her
firſt departure trom the fixed point ſhe is ſuppoſed to be ſet off from, under
the circumſtances and reſtrićtions mentioned, or underſtood, in the per
formance alluded to , and conſequently the inference made by the inge
nious author, at the cloſe of that work, concerning the return of the equa
tions to the ſame magnitude cannot be fairly deduced from any thing he has
there done. -
XIV. QUESTIon (1102), anſ. by 7. G. the propoſer.
Let A B and a b be the vertical diameters of -
the two given circles A C B, a c b; join A B,
cutting the two circles in C and c; then ſhall
the line C c be the line of quickeſt deſcent be

Firſt, from whatever point C, in the cir
cle A C B, the body begins to detcend, the
required line C c from that point when pro
duced, muſt paſs through the loweſt point b of
the othercircle. For, through the point c draw
the radius d c, produced to meet the vertical
line C E in F : then becauſe ofthe parallels, the two triangles b d c, C F c
are fimilar; and becauſe db = d c, theref. F C = F c ; conſeq. a circle
C c E, deſcribed with the centre F and radius F.C., will paſs through the
point c, and be a tangent to the circle a c & at that point, and it is theref.
the leaſt circle, having its centre in the vertical C E and any where meet
ing the given circle a c b. But, by mechanics, the time of deſcent down
the chord C c is equal to the time in the diameter CE, which diameter be
ing the leaſt, the time in it and conſeq. in C c is the leaſt alſo. -
In like manner, to whatever point c, in the lower circle, the body muſt
deſcend, the line C c produced upwards, muſt paſs thro' the higheſt point
A ; this is proved in the ſame way, by drawing D C f from the centre C
to meet the vertical line cf.e in f, and from the centre f deſcribing the
leaſt or tangential circle c Ce; then , again, the time in the hord C c is
-- the time in the diam ec, which is the leaſt as belore. Confeq. the
line muſt be drawn from the higheſt point A to the loweſt point b , to have
the intercepted part C c paſſed over in the ſhorteſt time.
