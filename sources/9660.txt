  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I collapsed on a bus. My wife (nurse) could not revive me (knuckle in sternum). I was dragged down to the road. Ambulance had arrived when I came round. Paramedics found no abnormalities.

Drawn to a joyous white light and up through a layer of personalities with tails like comets. Came into a space where I was tended to by silver, featureless creatures with thin limbs and conical (inverted) heads. They communicated telepathically and laid me down. I was told I could stay if I wished. I was tempted as I was ecstatic. When I decided against it, I was sucked down a tunnel. The white light stayed in my peripheral vision for two hours after the event. Subjective time span for the event about a half hour. 'Objective' time span, seven to ten minutes.

Was left with a sense of mission regarding spiritual healing.
