During that time, I had a fit of delirium and a gastric hemorrhage. Would it be during the latter that my experience occurred? 

I suddenly found myself floating upwards from the bed, towards the ceiling of my hospital room where I remained, lightly floating and weightless. I could see all around me without turning my head: 360 degrees of panoramic vision. Looking down, I could see myself on the bed, around which people in white gowns were standing, working on me with great haste. I wandered around for a while (of course I don't know for how long or where I was) and I found myself near a big tunnel, which held an irresistible attraction for me. At the end of the tunnel, there was a great, white light, which seemed beneficent and felt calming. The calmness of this light contrasted with the agitation down below. So, happily, I moved toward this tunnel, but just as I was entering it, I felt myself being dragged away from it by my feet. 

This bothered me deeply, so it was in an angry state that I re-entered my fleshly envelope.
