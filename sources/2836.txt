In addition to tlie letter mentioned TVictor
Hoffmann sent us a copy of an additss lie ltad
delivered, entitled- P at tiatfcixphm 'sbriiinxt-
entitled! P at Collrsxoti,
*n»i Ji'su Jesus’ Fuiisdotistiess cif Divun Son
>hip.—which is a masterly explanation of that
much misunderstood subject, and si. fmch
rational a treatment of the theme that we hen-
share it with our readers in a brief review \v
a l>ackground for this review let us take the
closing paragraph in the article “The Father­
hood of God" on page two of Tile National
Spiritualist for August 14>36; and let us realise,
in that connection, that, as a logical necessity
Infinite Intelligence IS Our Father—“not in
the mundane physical sense, hut in the ini
mcasurcably deeper, more real, more intimate
spiritual sense that 'the human soul is an itidi
vidualized expression of I Universal Spirit
Infinite Intelligence—God, if you please.'"
Doctor Hoffmann in his addrt -*- shows a clear
recognition of the humanity of Jesu>. and pre
'ents with keen insight a beautiful picture of
the workings and development of that human
soul. Between him and the rest of us there i>
no difference resulting from any miraculous
virgin birth—the difference shows in his clear
consciousness of that divine sotiship which, m
the rest of us. is but dimly apprehended. There
arc at least two ways in which Infinite Intelli
genee reaches into our soul-life: one of then-
ways is indirect, through the medium of dele
gated “ministering spirits." The other way is
direct In tracing the story of Jesus’ develop
ment, Doctor Iloftmaun presents hotli of these
methods by which Infinite Intelligence, God.
the Father, reached into the soul of Jesus of
Nazareth. And Iwcausc Jesus’ consciousness
of his divine sonship was so much dearer than
i« the case with the rest of us. the direct method
naturally predominated In the term “child
of God" Doctor IfofTmann recognizes a three­
fold significance:
First, is the universal application which we
had already presented in the article cited "We
issue from God. from Infinite Intelligence. Wr
are part of that Infinite Being." Then Doctor
Hoffmann points out a second, and intensified
meaning, which comes with our own realising
awareness of this relation, and of the sustain­
ing and protecting care with which our Infinite
rites. |Sr\

Nto ...
Tamil surround- us, and which yields incen­
tive to, and power for, a new and better life.
I'lic speaker now comes to the third aspect of
the theme: the still further intensified meaning
which dawns uj>on the consciousness of those
great and rare human souls whoso spiritual
development brings them so close to the (ireat
Heart oi Being that the will of the individu
alized life and the unll of the Infinite Parent
l>ecomc merged in a clear overwhelming recog­
nition of the life mission of the “individualized
expression": "I must do the will of Him that
sent me.” It is this third and highest meaning
upon which Doctor Hoffmann places chief
emphasis in tracing the spiritual life-history of
Jesus of Nazareth. He present? clearly the
racial and historical background of that won­
derful life. “Jesus’ consciousness of divine
sjmship," says Doctor Hoffmann, "is not based
upon any thought of a preexistence of his being,
neither is there anything which we know in
his words lo indicate that he based his con­
sciousness of divine sonship upon such a
thought as that of any virgin birth” No! It
was something tar deeper ami more spiritual
than that! Something infinitely more far-reach­
ing into the deep heart of Universal Being it­
self ! Those utlier ideas originated in later
theological views'
The address devotes a large amount of at
tention to Jesus’ baptism, as marking the cul­
mination of many years of silent questioning
regarding his own mission in the world. It
was with his clairaudirnt recognition of THE
VOICE which assured his innermost soul of
that spiritual sonship. that all doubt and ques­
tioning ceased and the path of his mission lay
clear and straight before him. "This day have
I begotten thee!” Mot any miraculous physio-
loii'ual event thirty years before! It is well to
reflect that insistence upon any vital impor­
tance m that story is based upon false valua
lions unworthy of souls claiming to occupy a
high spiritual plane. Because all life is sacred
and every birth is a sacred marvel, no “Miracle
story" can add one iota to its intrinsic wonder
nor to its intrinsic sacredness. No miracle
V sacredness. J 5
Story is needed to slice! spiritual glory mi that
life lived nineteen centuries ago; nor can such
a story have the slightest effect upon the qual
ity of those sublime teachings- of that sublime
example.
In presenting the thought of the hapti.sm as
the marked turningjioint in the life of Jesus,
Doctor Hoffmann employs the striking rnota
phor that in this act all Jesus' earlier trium­
phant thoughts of an earthly messianic great­
ness were drowned and carried away in the
flood of Jordan’s stream. Meek and humble
on the earthly side, his greatness henceforth
should l»e spiritual alone; not ruling, but
serving. This was the significance of the self-
abasement involved in allowing himself to be
baptized by John Moreover, the speaker
points out, this baptism marked a powerful
breaking-through of the spirit world into the life
which this carpenter had led hitherto. For
upon this occasion he received not only the
certitude of his mission but also a wonderful
endowment of power by which to carry it on
Suddenly he was in a twofold respect the great
physician of his people: physically and spiritu
ally. TTiis was something entirely new. Doctor
Hoffmann emphasizes the point that Jesus'
wondrous power of healing was not bom with
him. else it would have manifested itself carlici
during those thirty years: it first came into
action after he had received this jxiwer at the
time of his baptism. The rapid spread of won­
derful spirit healings drew great crowds—
which afforded opportunity both for further
physical cures and also for teaching his spirit­
ual message Day after day the crowds in­
creased : day after day the instances of clair­
voyance multiplied Again and again his
insight into the souls of those with whom he
came into contact filled all with amazement.
\s his popularity with the masses grew, so
also did the entails of the rulers among his
own people More and more clearly he fore­
saw the fearful torture at the end Yet nothing
held him back: he knew his mission; it was
ri<)ht that he go on with it to the estki nd
■*mrv
iiecausc it was right, lie did it. Right, for
right's sake!
I he spiritual greatness, of the ideal which lie
lived and taught is well epitomized in the talk
which has l»een called the "sermon on the
mount": "Love your enemies; bless them that
curse you; do good to them that hate you, and
pray for them tliat despitefuUy use you and
persecute you. . . All things whatsoever ye
would that men should do unto you, do ye even
so to them." That was nineteen centuries ago,
and on the fourth day of June. 1937 one of
America’s great ones, a man who passed over
not a generation ago, said: "Just so sure as
mortals eliminate all unkind thoughts, even
toward those who are unkind to them, so sure
will it be tliat they arc on the great and glorious
path of progress, which leads to happiness."
A Spiritualist is one who believes, as the
basis of his or her religion, in the communica­
tion between this, and the spirit world by
means of mediumship, and who endeavors to
mould his or her character and conduct in ac­
cordance with the highest teachings derived
from such communion. (Definition formulated
and adopted by the N.S.A.).
In connection with the tact that Jesus was
not omniscient. Doctor Hoffmann points out
that at Matthew XXIV:36 and parallel pas­
sages Jesus himself declared the limitation of
his own knowledge, although this greatly ex
cccdcd the norm in the masses cif humanity
One of the trials of his carthlite was a great
loneliness; his unusual endowment of powers
set him apart from the comprehension of his
companions. Even John, close as he was,
could not understand the greatheartedness of
Jesus toward the Samaritans who had retused
to extend hospitality.
To all who aspired to a better way of life
Jesus set forth the loving kindness of the Uni­
versal Parent in parables which belong to the
pearls of the world's literature. And Spiritu­
alism recognizes tliat. however long and hard
any soul may make his own reformation, the
door to that reformation is never dosed to any
human soul, here or heieaftcr.
ORIGIN OF RE-EMBODIMENT
DOCTRINE ON TH E CONTINENT
By M a rk A. B arw ite, L L . M.
H on. M a rk Barwi»c
American Spiritualists
ior many years, as was 1.
have Ik-cii puzzled as i<
>
why the great majority
of Kuroj>ean Spiritualists
on tlu* Continent, as dis
tillguished from English
Spiritualists, were Im
-
lievers in Ke-embodi-
nient. when the over-
w h r i m i n g m a s s of
teaching from s p i r i t s
through English and American mediums o
definitely and squarely against any such notion
A little investigation revealed to me that this
wide-spread doctrine could he traced definitely
to the influence of Allan Kardcc, who pub
lished the “Spirits’ Book” in 1S56, and shortly
afterwards there were established in Paris his
own paper, “La Revue Spirite." and several
other journals in other parts of France, all dc
voted to teaching this central doctrine ot Re
embodiment, and ignoring all phenomena of
spirit utterances contrary to it. and in fact mak­
ing no attempt to understand the meaning of
the great majority of the many phases ot mc-
diumistic phenomena.
The next step in this investigation was to
tind out if possible where the ideas in this liook
came from, and fortunately I ran across an
investigation conducted by the Honorable
Alexandci Aksakof, the Imperial Russian
Counselor, and published in the “I^nidon Spir­
itualist" in 1875. Aksakof clear-' up the whole
problem in his remarkable essay. He visited
Paris in 1875, and as a result of Ins investiga­
tions sets forth following facts:
That Madame Celina Japliet was fir-,1 put
into a mesmeric sleep by M. Ricard when she
was sixteen years of age; that in 1841 she had
a severe illness and was mesmerized by her
brother, and in that condition prescribed for
.hat
herself and was cured; that m 1845 she went
from ilie country t«» Paris to search for M
Ricard. and met M Koustan at the house of
M Millet, a mesmerist, that she became a pro­
fessional >umnambulist under the control of
M Kousian and gave medical advice with the
aid "t the spirits of her grandfather and Mahnr
matin and Mesmrr, and received a great many
communications from each of them and from
others, that M. Rou.stan was a lielicver in re
rmliodimcnt, and always put her into the
trance condition for her work; that she re­
ceived the doctrine of re embodiment from the
spirits of Iter grandfather. St I’ercsa and
others, while in the mesmeric sleep induced by
M. Kmistan . that hi 1849 Madame d’Abnom
returned from America and organized a circle
like one she had witnessed here, for the study
ol Spiritualistic phenomena, and this circle con
filmed to meet once m twice a week for nearly
twenty years at Madame Japhet's house. 46
Rue des Martyrs; that M Roustan continued
us principal mcsmerizei of Madam Japhet at
these circles and in Iter private work until
1864; that among the members of this circle
were MM. Sardnu. father ami son; that in
1856 the elder Sardou introduced her to M.
Denizard Rivail. connected with the journal
"L’Univers": tliat for several years before
meeting M Rivail she had developed auto­
matic writing and had obtained a great quan­
tity of manuscripts; that after a few weeks
M Rivail gathered up all these manuscripts
and took them home, refusing to return them,
that a few months later he arranged the maim
scripts and published the whole thing as the
"Spirits’ Book." never even mentioning Ma
dame Japhet’s name as the medium through
whom they came; that three quarters ni the
Isink came through Madame Japhet, and the re-t
through Madame Bodin. a member of .mothei
spirit circle; that M. Rivail took two names a-
his notn de plume, which he luid been told
through Madame Japhet and Madame Ro/«
that he had Ininie in two of his previous cm
bodiments, Allan and Kardec tliat Kardec left
the Japhet Circle soon after the publication «
•!
the "Spirits' Hook.’’ still refusing to return the
manuscripts, and never sent Madame Japhet a
single copy of the new hook; that M. Kardcc
formed a new circle with Madame Roze as the
medium, and arranged for the publication of the
“Mediums’ Book," although all of the sub
stance oi it was in the Japhet manuscripts; that
when Aksakof visited Madame Japhet in 1873
the Kardcc (tarty in Paris had reported her a-
dead, and she was never mentioned in any of
their publications; that M. Kardcc had nothing
to do with any medium whose controls would
not endorse re embodiment; that he tried to get
D. I). Home to join the Spiritist party—that
is the rc-embodimcnt party but when ITome
informed Kardcc that his controls did not en
dorse Kardec’s doctrine Kardct ignored him;
that Madame Japhet was controlled i"r \ksa
kof and prescribed for him. and that as late as
1873 she was still putting herself under control
by holding articles mesmerized so many vear->
ago by M. Roustan.
So we learn rather late perhaps, that the
great book, the "Spirits' Book.” which so many
thousands of Spiritualists regard as .1 sort of
biblc, and accept its contents as a dogma not
lo be questioned or contradicted, was not writ­
ten by Allan Kardec at all, but was mostly
written through the hand of Madame Japhet
before he met her, and that the slant of all its
teachings was imparted to the mind oi the
medium bv the mesmerizer M Roustan. Kar­
dcc only arranged and edited her manuscript
It was rather common in the early days of
Spiritualism for mediums to be placed in a
trance condition by mesmerizers, or as we
should say now by hypnotists. Andrew Jack-
son Davis at lirst was put in a trance condition
by a mesmerizer. but later was controlled in­
dependently by spirits without such mesmeric
It lias been noticed, too. by students of mes­
merism that the mind nf a mesmerized subject
is apt to become impregnated with the ideas of
the mesmerizer with bis prejudices and be­
liefs. and especially so it lie possesses a strong
magnetic personality. These ideas cling to the
aid
111
iiiiml of the inciJiuiu so developed. ami it i-.
very difficult for spirits later controlling such
a medium to dislodge them They are apt to
color and suffuse all that comes through such
a medium
Our own Mrs. Richmond spent a winter
with the Countess of Caithness, who later held
the title of the Duchess rle Pomar, who was
a disciple of Kardcc. When she left America
she was a typical and outstanding American
Spiritualist, but after associating for months
with the re-embodimentists she returned, a con
vert to their doctrine, and endorsed it in her
book. “Psychosophy.” A scattering few of our
Spiritualists adopted that view, but the great
body of American Spiritualists have adhered
to the full teachings of the early controls, who
were, as all the greatest controls are now. unan­
imous on all the basic truths of Spiritualism
as taught through the earliest mediums follow
ing its advent at Hydesville.
The only way we can learn all that it ic
possible to know, with our present capacities
on any subject, is to study all the evidence
hearing on the subject li we ignore parr of
the evidence, and only admit what tits our prej­
udices, wc can prove anything under the sun
This is fully as true in Spiritualism as in any
other science. The only way to become a full
sized Spiritualist is to study all the many differ
cut pluses of the phenomena, anti to give care­
ful attention to the teachings of all the ablest
controls of our foremost mediums. Anything
less than this makes a Iop-sidcd Spiritualist.
No spirit has ever reported that he has
learned of any evidence in the Spirit World
that supports the doctrine of re-embodiment
There arc a great many spirits in that world
who believe in re-embodiment, hut they all be­
lieved it when they were here and Itave not vet
m 1 *
outgrown it No spirit has ever seen another
spirit who offers anv evidence of his having
l>ccn embodied more tlum once. No spirit has
ever reported the slightest proof that has l*rrn
submitted to him that any spirit in any of the
/ones that have contacted with earthly me­
diums has ever been re-cinbodied. More than
hall *if the jH’ojilc* oi this world, counting all
the teeming millions of the East, believe in re-
embodiment. hut they believe it as a dogma, as
an article of faith: they do not believe it as
a matter of knowledge derived from the study
of evidence, which is our Western, scientific
method of arriving at truth. <^ur whole West­
ern training, derived from the method of
Columbus, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, I.yell
and Darwin, demands evidence for every prop
ositinn laid down We say. and say rightly,
that evidence is the only logical harrier separat
mg Western knowledge from Eastern fairy
tales, whether these fairy tales are the stories
of the Arabian Nights or the dreams of the re
ineamationists.
Wltat a tragic example it is that is exhibited
by the perverted method of Knrtlcc! Here was
a great man with the whole field of Spiritual­
istic truth before him. who deliberately ignored
all the physical phenomena, who deliberately
ignored the great majority of French mediums,
who deliberately ignored all the English and
American mediums, who deliberately ignored
all the teachings that grew out of the Hydes-
ville phenomena, and who adopted with child­
like faith the outpourings of three or four set
ond rate mediums as the whole law and gospel
of spiritual matters. His very method, with the
best intentions in the world, could not Itftve
arrived at anything hut error, could not have
escaped building up a few lialf-truths over-laid
with an obscuring mass of untruth
It is pitiable to note that probably two thirds
nt the Continental Spiritualists regard Kardcc
a- almost a god. ami visit his tomb with a rev*
crance that Catholics exhibit at the shrine of
a saint. But it is encouraging to note also that
all the great students of the science of Spirit­
ualism nowadays, in France and Italy and Gcr
many, are adopting the English and American
methods of studying the full IrkIv of incdium-
istic phenomena, and arc coming to the same
knowledge of a full-orbed science, philosoph)
and religion of Spiritualism, u has appealed to
English speaking Spiritualists as a great sys­
tem of cosmic truth

What if it reacts, only, to this spiritual

I-et us not he in any doubt as to the value
and the purpose of this experimental world
If the child in the kindergarten, the youth in
the high school should refuse to engage in the

he refused to study until he liad entered col

This present environment is of the utmost
importance. It is a truism to speak of the
value of time, still, by a paradox, although time
is infinite in duration.—is unlimited, vet all
the same it is the one invaluable possession
Human life. too. is so constructed in its j>c
riods of childhood, youth, maturity, age. that
no one fieriod is long enough for all we need

of the people is advancing
Mrs. Browning, so greatly in advance of her
time, wrote along in 1855 or so, "Foolish Jack
Smith who died yesterday, is still today. Fool­
ish Jack Smith."
This spiritual world in the ether of space L

Opportunities arc greater. Conditions arc more
favorable The vast numbers of people who
enter there are bewildered and they arc met
bv friends and helpers and instructors Philips
Brooks has said that a great part of his pres­
ent work is in helping the bewildered tn under
stand the conditions on which they enter Ap­
parently this next realm is not so different as
we have imagined from the present one. It
has its scenic beauty: its trees, flowers, grasses,
seas, lakes; its homes, schools, temples; its
lectures, music, instruction: in joys of con­
versation and companionship.
At one time I had Stances, on two succes­
sive days with Mrs. Piper. Kate Field luring
the communicant. On the -»ccond day I asked
her to tell me just what she had been doing
since the close of yesterday’s seance "Tell
me (I said), just as I could tell you of what
I liave done since: 1 took a trolley car from
here and." “Yea, yes. she interrupted me (with
characteristic vehemence) I know all about

talk with you and I walked in the garden to
refresh myself. Afterwards wc all went t«» a
great lecture on l.it/ht ami its Relation to

to listen to this. Afterwards I said to my
mother. ‘I must see what Lilian K about.” '
"Did you sec?" I questioned. "Yes, you were

This was true. I was then mgaged in writ­
ing her biography (Kate Field, \ Record),

There were letters to her trout Brownings.

Is it not conceivable that these newly dis­
