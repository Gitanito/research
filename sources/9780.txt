I was riding my scooter to work in a hotel. I was very close to my workplace when I was in an accident.  I remember nothing of the accident, felt no pain, and heard no noise. I woke up in hospital at 10pm covered in tubes. 

I told my wife that I had been with her deceased mother in an amazingly white corridor; she was a Rapa Nui (a native Polynesian inhabitant of Easter Island, the eastern most part of Polynesian culture. The Rapa Nui people make up 60% of Easter Island's population). She died from thrombosis that had kept her in bed for 2 years and my wife and I had looked after her. She was there with me, in that shining corridor and told me in Rapa Nui ‘Kaoho Koe’ which means ‘to return’, ‘follow your path’. She was very tall and wearing a white dress. 

Whenever I remember the experience I feel very emotional. It makes me cry.
