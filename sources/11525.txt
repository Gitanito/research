  		              		Experience Description   

    This happened in 1997, I was pregnant and by January 16 I broke my water and did not have many contractions so I was able to go to the hospital where I worked and the doctor on duty examined me and told me that labor was just beginning like this who told me that I could go home to wait for the contractions to be more frequent but that there was a health problem in the hospital and that only emergencies were attended since there was no space for women in labor and he recommended another health center for when I arrived the time to give birth, that was difficult because in my country Venezuela the next day 'zero hour' began, this consisted of a 24-hour civil strike. In my state, I could not wait for the functions of the institutions to be restored to having my baby I had to resolve where how could I have it and that it would not present any risk for both of us, for then my husband was a doctor from the same institution where I worked, so he could not influence any colleagues from that hospital so that I could enter, he began to call his other colleagues in other hospitals but the emergencies of the delivery room were in the same conditions of restriction. 

Then a friend from my faculty remembered, his wife was doing the last year of postgraduate degree in obstetrics and calling him put me in contact with her and we went to that hospital there I could enter because there were almost no patients it was a relief for me, my husband was ready to help me attend my delivery to reduce the I work on the environment and my sister who was doing her last year of medicine also offered to help with the baby when he was born. So everything is already coordinated and we just patiently waited for the contractions to be faster. 

  But something unexpected happened. My water had already broken for more than 16 hours and I was not dilating. My husband got desperate because the baby had already descended into the birth canal and he could not expel it. There was no time for a cesarean section, and it had to be resolved by vaginal means. Finally, my son was born and he responded immediately.  Then I was on a gynecological table and my husband was suturing the perineum since there was the need to expand it to extract the baby.  

Later I remember talking to My sister and she told me that my son was fine and that she would take the medical history to enter him together with me and in the same room. I was already on a stretcher ready to be taken to the room while the transfer assistant arrived they placed me on the stretcher just right on the door attached to the wall, I began to dizzy and when I arrived.  I wanted to sit down because it was difficult for me to breathe and I asked the one to help me sit down and the attendant told me that I could fall.  I told him to call my sister since she was inside the room.  She came out and I told her to take the blood pressure and give me oxygen quickly because I am very dizzy.  She lifted the sheet that covered me and could see an immense blood clot.  

  She immediately took me to the delivery room and they performed a uterine curettage, then another and another.  I did not stop bleeding.  I remember that at this moment I lost consciousness.    The chief physician told his colleague to advance my case for an emergency surgical intervention and with the help of my husband they began to place the surgical fields. I remember being in the operating room and my husband told me in my ear 'your son, He needs you.' I knew that was why I recognized his voice. I took him out of the room because the situation was becoming risky for me, my life was on the verge of death. I listened to the sound of the vital control monitors and As a nurse I knew that something was wrong because they sounded out of calibration they did not feel the vital signs and when they sound that way it is.  The parameters are very low when there is hypovolemia I could not see them but I heard them everywhere as well as I could feel the nurse prick my arms and I know that she was injecting me with intramuscular cyntocinon and intramuscular metergyn.  

I felt a force that suspended me and I saw a dark tunnel and it attracted me like 'the magnet attracts iron.' Then I saw an incandescent light that entered with a reflection that came from above.  The light revealed itself to me I became aware of what was happening.  I could see my body. I knew it was me because I recognized myself.  I asked the Doctors to leave me alone.  Yet, they could not hear me. I insisted and I know it bothered me because I felt very cold and asked to be covered.  They did not do it either. Another very warm, Male voice spoke to me and said 'You can't leave until you finish what you started.' I turned my face to the right and saw the silhouette of a man with a tunic.  I felt that they put a bracelet on my arm and I listened to the monitors again.  This time, the sound was already more rhythmic.  I also listened to the nurses when they were counting the abdominal compresses. 

  I was alone as a patient and there were no other personnel around me. I did not recognize the place because it did not look like a delivery room. My head hurt a lot because my hemoglobin was very low. I was seeing double and could not keep my eyes open.  I looked at my hands and my arms. I tried to move them and they hurt a lot. I said to myself that it is because of the cytocinon injections that they administered in the trans operative room.  I asked myself 'Why did they operate on me?' Then I took my left hand to my abdomen and I could see that it was full of adhesive and gauze and immediately I knew everything that happened. Being conscious a doctor approached me and asked me how I felt.  I told her that I had a headache, double vision, and many petechiae in the skin.  I asked him what caused this.  He replied that I had suffered a hemorrhage and that I had emergency surgery to save my life.  He told me that my hemoglobin reached 3 grams and when they used up all the reserves, I was polyfused with 10 units of blood. 

  My husband came in to give me the news that they had to do an emergency hysterectomy.  He thought I would burst into tears, but it was not like that. I took it with great calm and resignation, because despite what they told me about everything that happened, I am still alive. I still remember those words 'you can't leave until you finish what you started'. I am 56 years old and I think that time is running out and I feel anguish because even now I don't know what to do and how.
