  		              		Experience Description   

  My second son was about to be born. We went to the hospital and the staff prepared me for surgery with a spinal injection. Shortly thereafter, I had trouble breathing so I told the anesthesiologist that was standing beside my bed.  He said that this would get better after he put the oxygen mask on my mouth.  

  Then, I saw myself in a clinic near our house.  I was a child and my mom used to take me there whenever I got sick.  At first, I saw myself near the door of our house.  There was no need to walk through the clinic, because in a blink, I was there.  I was sitting on a chair or a bench, waiting for my turn.  There were many people standing in line who were wearing gray suits and others who were wearing dresses. I couldn't see their faces or even see if they were men or women.  

I turned my face and thought, 'Wow, they have changed the decorations.'  I didn't understand how I could have missed this beautiful garden in background as I looked through a big glass window .  The ground was covered with green grass. But the color of green is hard to explain because I had never seen it before.  I couldn't see the sun, but it was a beautiful day over there. Far away, there were green trees that were not like the garden.  Rather it was more like a magic jungle.  I felt so good and wanted to go there. 

So, I went to the check-in counter to find out why I hadn't been called for such a long time.  I asked, 'Why don't you let me in?' The man in front of me said, 'Look at all these people that have been standing here for hours. It is not your turn yet.  Go, sit down, and they will call you.'  This conversation between me and him was not like usual conversations.  It is hard to explain.  It was like an emotional understanding without saying any words.  

  As I turned back and looked at the bench, I saw that my 5 year old child was not there.  I thought I had brought him, but he wasn't there.  I got so nervous and shouted with all my power.  I called his name loudly and suddenly; I heard my physician calling my name.  They were all happy and I felt a severe pain in my chest that was maybe from the CPR they gave me.  My second gift of god, my son was born.  I did not say anything about what I saw to anyone.  I thought it was a dream.  But the day afterwards, the matron of nurses told me that I was nearly dead because I had no blood pressure or pulse.  She told me it was god's will that I was now alive.

What is your religion now?         Muslim     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I believed that I will die some day. I believed in life after deah.  I was so depressed at that time because my marriage was not satisfactory.  I thought of death so many times during my pregnancy. I was hoping for god to save me.  The only reason that could have keep me alive was my children.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I became more and more popular in my job field of dentistry because I looked at people not just as my patients but as human beings.  They became a part of me. My marital life became much better.  I look after my life and children.  I think if my life had ended that early, I would definitely have missed this kind of education in earthly living.

I became more and more popular in my job field of dentistry because I looked at people not just as my patients but as human beings.  They became a part of me. My marital life became much better.  I look after my life and children.  I think if my life had ended that early, I would definitely have missed this kind of education in earthly living.  I would have missed experiencing this much joy and this much experience to help people from their dental pain    

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I cannot explain the light or the green color because it was so different from anything we know on earth.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?

I just know it was a very sweet experience that was so much easier that I thought.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes.     First gift was my little son.  The  second gift was saving my marriage.  And the third gift was a change in my career life.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The best of it was its sweetness and ease

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I was told that I almost died from my physician and nurses who were present during my surgery  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I have read others stories and I found some similarities.  Before that experience, I had never read anything about this before  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain    

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       No.
