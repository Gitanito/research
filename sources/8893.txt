I saw my grandmother, grandfather and two uncles that had passed. It was in an area with green grass and a wooded background.  My grandfather and two uncles were a chrome swing with purple seats. My grandmother was standing with one seat on the swing with no one in it; I tried to get in the swing seat but could not. I ask my grandmother to help me on the swing and she said no that I could not stay I had to go home. I could smell my grandmother's perfume something I had not smelled in twenty-seven years and my grandfather's laugh. 

When I came to I was in intensive care in the hospital and I could not remember the accident, this was all I could remember.
