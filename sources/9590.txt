I was too ill to leave and was treated by an Indian doctor. I remember very little about the illness other than I was in and out of consciousness for many days. I believe I lost thirty pounds in weight. I remember the doctor saying I was dangerously dehydrated but could not hold fluids down. The doctor came in and said to my brother, 'He's gone.' I rose out of my body; saw the doctor, my brother, and a friend. Everything in the room was very vivid. I seemed to float into a blinding light and a hand reached out and took my hand. I felt, I guess a rapture-like feeling of peace and serenity. I saw a man in shadows who said, 'You can go back if you want or you can continue this journey.' I wanted to come back. He let go of my hand. I floated back into my body, opened my eyes, stood up, I felt great, and to the disbelief of everyone walked to the ocean with a feeling of pure joy.
