HEALTH IS IN YOU
"And as thy days, so shall thy strength be."
(1) Each new day is a link in the many-linked
chain of life. A chain is as strong as its weakest
link. Life is only as strong as its weakest day. ,
Days should be lived wisely and bravely, thus ·
will our life in its turn become brave and worth- /
while. ··
We are <!ommanded : "Be strong and quit
yourselves like men." (2) Life is strong, and
are we not children of life? Therefore let us
turn away from weakness and affirm "I am a
child of the Infinite and the Infinite is my
strength and my protector."
LIFE OFFERS YOU LIFE
Think of yourself as being a child of life.
Life so strong and so mighty, life ever ready to
grant every deserving seeker a brimming meas-
ure of its richest endowment - good health.
Heed the promise "I will take sickness away
from the midst of thee." (3) Listen again, "I
will heal thee and I will add unto thy days." (4)
Let us trust Life and we will be preserved and
kept alive.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
We read, "W*y art thou cast down, 0 my
soul? And why art thou disquieted within me?
Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,
who ia. the health of my countenances." (5) The
Great Physician is ready to forgive all our in-
iquities and heal all our diseases when we are
ready to forsake our ignorant, gluttonous, sin-
ning ways and seek the tender loving Spirit of
Life in whom are hid all the treasures of heal-
ing, wisdom and knowledge. Did not Christ, the
healer, understand th·at disease was self made
when he addressed himself thus to the man tak-
en with the palsy "Man, thy sins be forgiven
thee." (6)
No evil can befall us, no disease can harass
us, when we stoutly detennine to live in the
light and strength of life. No face is condemned
to wax pale, no person is destined to remain
feeble ifthe promise is believed: "For I will re-
store health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy
wounds." (7) Faith in Life is necessary for the
healing of sickness.
HAVE FAITH THAT 'YOU CAN BE
HEALED
Try to implicitly believe and carry .out this
promise: "Therefore I say unto you what things
soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye
receive them, and ye ahall have them." (8) The
thought of faith has power to heal our weak-
ness and sic'kness. Let us not condescend to re-
.-6....
HEALTH IS IN YOU
main troubled with pains and discords, let us in-
stead "fight the good fight of faith and enter in-
to our potential right, an abu'ndant life of prec-
ious health."
"In the beginning was the word and he aent
hia word and healed them, and delivered them
from their destructions." (9) The healing sup-
ply ever waits our command. Let us open our-
self now to the healing spring of Divine Love
and affirm with all the faith of our nature "Life,
Life, Infinite Life flows through me." Life is per-
fect health, if it were possible for life to become
diseased all life would come to an end. Life
has always been health, life is health now; and
life will remain health, through all time and
eternity.
BELIEVE THAT HEALTH IS IN
YOU
Open yourself to the healing essence of life
this very moment. Face the light, lift up your
head, believe as you affirm and speak the heal-
ing word: "Life, life, Infinite life flows through
me." Feel the inflow of renewing, healing en-
ergy of Infinite Life and rejoice because your
redemption from sickness is at hand and your
emancipation from suffering draweth nigh.
When we turn to the source that gave us
life and discard man made erroneous concep-
tions of healing,,we shall find the fullness of life
and health awaiting us. At that moment we will
4-7-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
come into the glorious realization of the pro-
mise, ,.Th~ shall thy light break forth aa the
morning, and thine health shall spring forth
speedily."(lO)Life can save us to the uttermost.
No matter how long we have had to bear the
cross of pain and suffering it is well to remem-
ber: "Ia my hand shortened at all that it cannot
redeem?" (11) Our health CAN be restored,
our every wound WIU.. be healed if we do our
part and cease transgressing and turn to the
source that can "bind up that whi-ch was brok-
en and will strengthen that which was sick."
HEALTH IS NOT MAGIC,
IT IS LAW
"And they brought unto him aU sick people
that wel"e taken with divers diseases and tor-
ments and those that were possessed with dev-
ils and those which were lunatics, and those
that had the palsy: and he healed them." (12)
So transcendent is the inherent healing power
of life, nothing is impossible to its rectifying
touch. No man who is sick is denied access to
this greatest of all Physicians. But there is a
question of belief to be considered. Two thou-
sand years ago these words were uttered by the
Master Healer of all time, "According to your
faith be it unto you", and great multitudes fol-
lowed this healer, and we read, "He healed
them all." (13) The Christ power to heal- is not
confined to a favored few, it is a gift for all men
.--8--+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
who dare tn use it to regain perfect health and
strength. "Then touched he their eyes and their
eyes were opened." "And as many as were
touched were made perfectly whole." (14) Life
is ever ready to place its healing hand upon our
weary brow and restore strength to our bodies
and peace to our souls. The majestic power of
the Healing Spirit is turned in the direction of
suffering, when the sufferer calls upon it. Sim-
ply say: "Infinite Spirit of Life, I have faith that
I can be healed; heal me, 0 Infinite Spirit of
Life."
BELIEVE THAT ALL THINGS
ARE POSSIBLE
We are created by life in the Divine Image
and Likeness. Everything that Life or God crea-
tes is good. In fact, we read, "And God saw ev-
erything that he had made, and behold it was
VERY GOOD." (15) A man is not a creature of
the dust. Through the breathing of the Divine
Breath into the nostrils of man, "Man became a
living soul." Try to comprehend: you are a "liv-
ing soul", not a poor suffering human being.
When this realization is a substantial reality,
the restoration of health becomes a simple af-
fair. Believe that length of days and long life
and 'Peace are your inheritance·and they shall
become yours. "He is in the way of life that
keepeth instruction." (16) Harken to these in-
structions and open your whole being to the In-
finite, Cleansing, Healing Life Principle, and
~9--+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
welcome it to throb and pulsate through your
entire self so that you may become rejoicingly
alive and well. Speak from the depths of your
soul, "Health is for me. Health is for me. I re-
joice that Health is for me and now becomes
mine."
THE HEALTH OF GOD IS YOURS
"Understanding is a well spring of life un-
to him that hath it." The supreme understand-
ing of human existence is the knowledge that
understanding giveth life to them that have it.
"For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath
he given to the Son to have life in himself."
(17) We are children of the Father, therefore
the life that is in the Father is in us. Knowing
this truth, let it become a shining sun by day
and a beacon by night to such an extent that we
will refuse to tolerate a condition of weakness
to impede us in any way. Let us turn from lower
things to higher. Disease is fimte, health is infin.
ite. Why dally with the finite which hurts and
troubles, rather let us move upward into the re-
gion of the Spiritual Life and seek that light of
health and healing which is accessible to every
man, and when found let it become our star of
hope and armor of defense forever more. How
tragic it is to remain he·ld down in the thrall-
dom of pain and suffering when Life is offering
us Life and healing here and now. Lift up your
eyes, stretch forth your hands and heartily ex-
claim "I will arise and shine for my light is
+-10~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
come! I will arise and shine for my light is
come!"
GOD WANTS YOU TO BE WELL
The Teacher of Galilee says, "I am the way,
the truth and the life." (18) When there is a
dearth of vital energy and health force, we
should go to the well of healing and supply.
There is nothing abnormal in the healing of the
body through Spiritual Law. We learn, "The
very hairs of your head are all numbered." (19)
If that statement be true, and it has never been
refuted, then should we not value life more
highly? Should we not recognize our divinity
and our potential greatness and refuse to re-
main a moment longer in the throes of suffer-
ing? The yoke of disease may be broken, when
we open our mind to truth, when we train our
will to accept health discipline, then all things
become possible."The eyes of the blind shall see
out of obscurity and out of darkness." (20)
"The ears of the deaf shall be unstopped." (21)
"Not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing;
it will be perfect and ·without blemish." (22)
"Promise after promise are recorded, so why
should we be afraid." Let us banish fear and
lift up our voices with the assurance that
strength is returning and give thanks we are on
the road to recovery and happiness.
+-11-+ ' !
HEALTH IS IN YOU
AFFIRM: "I WANT HEALTH,
I AM HEALTH!"
Life .offers us life, not a dwarfed sickly life
but one of richness and abundance. Let us put
our trust in Him who holds in his right hand the
soul of every living thing and in his left the
breath of all mankind. Him who giveth to all
life and breath and all things. Our hands are
not bound, our mind is unfettered, our legs are
free from trammeling gyves. Let us awaken
therefore and claim from life what life is eager
to bestow a larger, greater, vaster existence of
health and fullness. Though our hands are
weak, they may be strengthened. Though our
knees tremble, they can be steadied. Though
our bodies suffer, they can be released from
their anguish. All things are possible, if we
train ourselves to believe that all things are pos-
sible.
..And their feet were made straight feet and
the ftesh of the child waxed warm." (23) Let us
cease accepting the ills to which human flesh
is heir. Let us ever remember we are living
souls quickened by spirit, not merely bodies of
profitless flesh. As children of the Infinite we
have power over the flesh, so let us affirm, "My
perfect soul self is changing my imperfect flesh
self into the glorious state of my perfect soul
self."
+-12-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
QUICKEN YOUR BLOOD WITH
INCREASED FAITH
When we live in the light of the spirit we
have power over' the finite. We read, "For if ye
live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye
through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the
body, ye shall live." (24) It is only through
spiritual understanding that we can present our
bod-ies holy and acceptable, which is not only
our 'privilege but also our duty and reasonable
service. Hear the stirring admonition, "What?
know ye not that your body is the Temple of the
Holy Ghost which is in you." (25) Too often we
desecrate our bodies with gluttony and overeat-
ing, then wonder why the cross of sickness has
come upon us. "For the drunkard and the glut-
ton shall come to poverty." (26) "And at laat it
biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an
adder." (26) When we conquer our desire for
too much food then shall we begin to walk in
the liberty and freedom of radiant health.
"For they that are after the flesh ·do mind
the things of the flesh, but they that are after
the spirit, the things of the spirit." (27) When
our chief interest lies in food, when the s·pirit of
self rules within, then are we prone to disease
and suffering. "A sound heart is the life of the
flesh." (28) How can our hearts retain whole-
ness and soundness unless our days and
thoughts are manifesting that way? Let us cry
out for health with all our heart and soul, know-
+-18-.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
ing the prayer of faith is answered even before
it is uttered. "Ask, and it shall be given unto
you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall
be opened unto y,ou. For every one that asketb
~ceiveth; and be that seeketh fi.ndetb; and to
him that knocketb it shall be opened.'r (29)
"And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in pray-
er BELIEVING ye shall receive." (30)
DECREE THAT HEALTH IS
YOURS
"The Lord will give strength unto his
people." (31) In the sanctuary and protection
of life we find strength and beauty. In the
knowledge that all is good and all is well with
us we find comfort, solace and healing. The
sickness that comes upon us is often self made
through lack of life understanding. Somehow,
because of our daily obligations, duties and re-
sponsibilities we had neither time nor thought
to get that greatest of all getting - "under-
standing", and without understanding· or vision
not only individuals but whole nations shall per-
ish. God offers power to the faint, and to the
weak increased strength. Listen, "they that
wait ·upon the Lord shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they
shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk
and not faint." (32)
The purpose of life is not to drag out a wea-
ry existence, it is given so that we may live in
wisdom and wholeness. From this moment cast
+-14~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
anxious fear away, submerge yourself into the
sparkling soul of life. Renew your faith and
trust and know that nothing is impossible in
Truth. Restore your courage and optimism, for
we read, "In quietness and in confidence shall
be your strength.'~ (33) We sin against the Spir-
it of Life when we declare and constantly dwell
on our pains and torments. Rather let us pursue
an opposite and wiser course-and with all the
confidence of our being heed the admonition,
"Let the weak say I am strong." (34)
CREATE STRENGTH BY FAITH
Life is enduring and 0 so strong and brave.
Can we, the sons and daughters of life, afford
to be less? Let us renew our courage this very
hour, let us speak unto our weakened parts the
renewing thought "I am strong." In the begin-
ning was the word, that selfsame first word is
now within the reach of every sufferer. The
original word is usable in two forms, inward
and outw'.ard. Let us speak inward the healing
vitalizing, energy and essence of life, likewise
speak out the plaguing ills and pains that test
our faith and paralyze our ambition. What
gTeater words of renewing can be uttered than
these, "I am strong, in the strength of God I am
strong."
Our bodies can become strongholds of vital
energy when we cooperate with life and begin
to use the health unfolding ways and means
.-15-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
provided by life and so freely offered to every
sufferer. _
"I will even make a way in the wilderness,
a nd rivers in the desert. I will give unto him
tha t is athirst of the fountain of the water of life
freely." (35) Life's greatest need is health, how
drab and useless our lives become when we are
tormented by weakness or sickness. Fortunate-
ly, however, there is a way from the sick bed to
the towering altitudes of radiant health. "And
let him that is athirst come. And whosoever
will, let him take of the water of life freely."
(36)
PERFECT ACTION ENSURES
HEALTH
The guilt of the who,le world is ignorance of
the power to command life to heal us and pro-
tect us. We incline toward weakness more than
toward strength. We are prone to place our
trust in feeble wish and hope instead of in
demanding and claiming the health that is Di-
vinely ours. "Thou shalt also decree a thing and
it shall be established unto thee." (37) Believe
that high promise now. Cast out doubt or self
pity or resignation. The law alone is the truth,
"We are indeed children of the light and we are
childr en of the day." Let us arise in the might of
our supreme inheritance and return to the way
of health and life. Let us begin to decree that
our weakness is passing and that the strength
of Life is pouring in through our open receptive
..-16-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
bodily and mental channels.
"He sent his word and healed them and de-
livered them from their destruction." (38) Fear
not to ask for liberation from sickness and suf-
fering. How can we be truly happy when we
writhe in pain? Suffering is so unnecessary, we
seem to hold to it entirely too long. Due to faul-
ty teachings of the past we have looked upon
sickness as being a natural condition of life. The
contrary is the truth, it is health that is natural
and normal. Wherever we turn we find the in- ·
ference that disease is the result of broken laws,
and when commandments of health are preserv-
ed, health of body is maintained. "And I will
cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby
they have sinned against me, and I will pardon
all their iniquities whereby they have sinned
and whereby they have transgressed against
me." (39)
CHANGE FROM ERROR TO
TRUTH
"The blind receive their sight and the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear,
the dead are raised up and the poor have the
gospel preached to them." (40) 'l'he gospel of
glad tidings is: "There is power to Heal even
the man who is sick unto death." "Jesus saith
unto him, Rise, take up thy bed and walk, a~d
immediately the man was made whole and took
up his bed and walked." · (41) Two thousand
years ago healing miracles, signs and wonders
*-17~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
were wrought among the people, great marvels
and demonstrations of healing were, performed,
and multitudes were released from agony and
suffering. That healing power is still intact and
available to all who call upon it. "Hear, ye
deaf; and look, ye blind that ye may see." (42)
"The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind." (43)
The greatest mental blindness is to sit com-
placently in the prison house of bodily suffering
and believe that it is a condemnation from the
Lord; To calmly accept sickne.ss is to accept the
darkness of life. We cannot see in the darkness,
but we can move out of the darkness into the
light and health of life. How timely is this as-
surance, "I will make darkness light before
the·m and crooked things straight." (44) When
we study life deeply, when we delve deeper and
dee·per into the core of life we find that all is
good and receive higher sight so we too, can ex-
claim: "Whereas I was blind, now I see." (45)
And when our eyes are free from the scales of
error, our mouths are filled with a new song of
health and healing.
LIFE IS GOOD
When we know the Truth concerning life,
when we grasp and realize the friendliness and
goodness of life, then will all darkness end, as
the knowledge of Truth sets us free. No dis-
ease can hold us back, no pain can crush our
spirit, we will come into our own with power of
dominion over all suffering. "Then shall the
+-18-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
lame man leap as a hart and the tongue of the
dumb sing." "From the sole of his foot even to
the crown of his head there was no blemish in
him." (46)
How beautiful is this thought: "And he
shall be as the light of the morni'ng, when the
sun riseth even a morning without clouds; as
the tender grass springing out of the earth by
clear shining after the rain." (47) A perfect
body, a peace filled mind, a glorified spirit.
These are lofty aims which every sincere man
and woman may achieve.
HEALTH IS WITillN YOUR
REACH - "CLAIM IT"
It is well to practice the habit of patience
when striving for release from sickness. It has
taken many years of transgression of life's laws
to reduce us to the low state of bodily suffering.
It is not good nor wise to desire an instant re-
turn to health. Little by little is the way of life.
Read this admonition : "He hath made every-
thing beautiful in His time." (48) We cannot
hurry the healing forces; we must exercise pa-
tience and everlasting:ly persist in speaking the
word that will ultimately lead us out of the wil-
derness of suffering into the Eden of· glorious
health, never neglecting for a single hour to si-
lently think or audibly affirm, "The God power
within me is mightier than my weakness."
Even though our suffering is no fault of our own
but comes from inheritance, our spirit should
~19-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
not be plunged into dismay. We inherit "God
Power" in a greater measure than any weak-
ness that can afflict us. "God Power" is all con-
quering and all healing, and when we proclaim
to the whole world in ringing tones of faith and
perfect assurance "The God Power within me
is mightier than my weakness", something is
going to happen. And what happens will be a
profitable and a delightful experience for the
sufferer. Health will re-assert itself, weakness
will begin to move out, pain will lessen and pre-
·sently disappear, all in the light of stirring faith
and supreme courage, radiating from our tri-
umphant declaration of the Truth. I
FAITH MEANS ULTIMATE
WHOLENESS
Life wants the sick to become well ; exist-
ence can only be bright and sunny when the spi-
rit o:f untroubled health is registering within.
How goodly it is when our countenance is as the
sun's, shining in health and strength.
Men are as pliant clay, therefore let us sur-
render ourselves to the Divine Potter to reshape
and re•fashion our weakened bodies into organ-
isms reflecting sturdiness, healthfulness and
physical wholeness. Make a deep proclamation
at this moment, "I want health, I am health,
Health is mine." Put your soul into your state-
ment. "Lift up thy voice .with strength, lift it up,
be not afraid l'" (49)
From every possible source of contact draw
.-20-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
forth health and true health knowledge. Be
alert and vigilant to recognize the pure truth
concerning health. Open your ears and make
your life responsive to the Divine Ambassador
of health when he happens to stop at your door.
"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any
man hear my voice and open the door, I will
come in to him and will sup with him and he
with me." (50)
OPEN YOURSELF TO HEALTH
TRUTHS
Let us not be satisfied to exist in incomplete
and partial health. Let nothing short of the
abundant life of full health and wholeness suf-
fice. The whole health of life is available and it
can become ours to possess and enjoy indefin-
itely when we are prepared to help ourselves to
its beneficient goodness.
The direst of all tragic happenings is to ac-
cept the enslavement of disease, fearing that it
cannot be avoided or overcome, when the con-
trary is the reality and truth. "Thy hands were
not bound nor thy feet put into fetters." (51)
Really every man is free to live as he wills, and
if visited by sickness, that is not indicative that
sickness should be accepted or feared, rather
should we wage a strong fight against the dis-
cord that has come upon us.
But if we have accepted the condition of
sickness there is still hope for us in this promise,
"And now, behold I loose thee this day from
~21--+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
the chains which were upon thine hand." (52)
If our head hangs down, if our back is weak,
there is a commanding force that can lift our
heads and strengthen our backs so that life can
once more become a "Glorious Inheritance" .
with every burden removed from our shoulder.
YOUR DIVINE RIGHT IS TO
DWELL IN HEALTH
The premier faculty of man is personal
faith. "And as he prayed, the fashion of his
c.ountenance was altered." (53) When faith is
richly present its mysterious power can lift us
from our bed of suffering into the rejoicin·g
plane of ease and health. Read and re-read this
statement, "All things are possible to him that
believeth." (54) Life can and will heal us when
we believe with all our heart and soul that we
can be cleansed from our suffering.
"If ye abide in me and my words abide in
you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be
done..unto you." (55) Our joy cannot be full if
we suffer the torment of pain, but our joy can
be full when we receive our healing through the
exercise of faith and the cessation of wilful ·or
unconscious transgression against the laws and
principles of life and living.
Faith, prayer and penance will not alone
heal our stripes and close our wounds. "Ye ask
and r.
eceive not because ye . ask amiss." (56)
Not only is it good to pray, but we should watch ·
also. When we watch ahd pray we fulfill condi-
~22~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
tions governing the healing of disease and then
we receive the measure of health we claim, and
happiness becomes established in our soul once
again.
RIGHT ACTION BRINGS
PERFECTION
To watch means we have to examine our
habits and change from ways of darkness and
indolence into•ways of light and activity so that
physically, mentally and spiritually we comply
with the requirements of the law necessary to
restore us into the sweet and precious harmony
of good health.
The relation that exists between the mind
and the body is very intimate. The condition of
the mind affects the health to a greater degree
than is generally realized. A poised mind and a
cheerful spirit is in harmony with the principle
of healing and should be zealously encouraged.
"A merry heart doeth good like a medicine."
(57) "Be ye transformed by the renewing of
your mind." (58) Wrong thinking makes life a
burden and often causes illness of body and
mind. By the mere reversal of a thought quite
often the shadow of sickness may be lifted and
the beginning of a sweeter, healthier existence
may be·installed.
Disease never comes without a cause. The
seeds are sown in the body or mind and suffer-
ing ap'pears. The transgression of law is thE"
principal factor producing sickness. Men disre-
~23~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
gard the principles of health and adopt wilful
habits of eating and living, and then cry out
against life and against God for the suffering
that has come upon them. Responsibility for
pain and suffering as a general rule rests on the
individual, and it is futile to blame God for our
afflictions. Man is fearfully and wonderfully
made, and we should do all possible to preserve
intact the delicate mechanism of our bodies and
do as we are commanded, to "Glorify God in
your body." (58) This message is pregnant with
meaning: "If thou wilt diligently harken to the
voice of the Lord thy God and wilt do that
which is right in his sight and wilt give ear to
his commandments and keep all his statutes, I
will put none of these diseases upon thee which
I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the
Lord that healeth thee." (59)
GOD HEALS THROUGH LAW
The perfect life of health is encouraged by
complying with physical, mental and spiritual
laws. Become alert and vigilant to live wisely
and temperately, and thus do we preserve and
lengthen our life. It is written: "I will take sick-
ness away from the midst of thee." (60) And
again it is written: "I will heal thee and I will
add unto thy days." (61)
Everywhere is the message of hope and con-
solation flashed to us that healing may be our
portion when we comply with life's laws and
turn from the dark vibration of disease to the
+-24~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
vibrant attitude of glorious health. And as a re-
sult of this change, "Then shall thy light break
forth as in the morning and thine health shall
spring forth speedily." (62)
If physical means fail to remove torment
from our bodies, we should turn to the Greater ·
Physician and place our affairs in His care and
kee'ping, and no disappointment will accrue as
a result. "It is the spirit that keeps us alive."
"He will heal us . . . and he will bind us up . .
he will raise us up and we shall live in his
sight."
GOD'S HEALING LAW AWAITS
OUR CALL
All suffering is the reaction to broken laws.
Constant health is the reaction to conscious or
unconscious harmony. Disease does not follow
from advancing years, nor is it the mark of old
age. Disease is unnatural living, first, last and
all time. It is the mark of ignorance of life's
laws. Education and culture are most desirable,
but knowledge of life's. laws should be part of
every man's education. How excellent it is to be
well educated and accomplished, but at the
same time versed in the basic, fundamental
principles of natural healthful living.
Old age symptoms also reflect ignorance of
the individual. No man has ever died from old
age. No man can prove that we cannot live for
centuries or, as a matter of fact, forever. Any
departure from the ease and spring of youth is
.-25-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
the sign of careless or ignorant living. Let us
turn for a moment to the promise, "All mine are
thine." (63) The health, peace and joy of God
are freely proffered to every man who provers
his worthiness. Life is but a tempestuous sea to
millions because of a limited consciousness and
a lack of life harmony. Above all, overshadow-
ing every other fact and possibility of life and
living, the unprejudiced open minded observer
discovers this undeniable truth. "Life, whether
in its physical or spiritual condition, is never
helped by mawkish sympathy."
Search where you will, out in the fields or in
the innermost recesses of the soul, one gleam-
ing, irrevocable truism stands forth unaltering
-justice is back of all phases of life, not sym-
pathy. Men cannot continue to break God's laws
with impunity and expect to receive a brimming
measure of all the rich blessings of life. If the
rewards of life were passed out to the ignorant
and to the careless and indifferent, there would
be little encouragement for any man to adopt
disciplinary habits of living so that he might
fulfill the law and thus deserve the best that
life holds.
LEARN TO DESERVE HEALTH
"No good thing will he withhold from them
that walk uprightly." (64) There would be no
sense, meaning or stability in life if we could
get something for nothing. When sickness is
nigh us, not only must we pray for power to ov-
t-26-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
ercome our affliction, but also we must scrutin-
ize and examine our life and discover the ''why"
of our distress. "Walk y.e in all the ways that I
have commanded you, that it may be well unto
you." (65)
The greatest poverty of life is weakness, a
weakened frame, a tottering body. But such a
condition need not be a permanent one. The im-
mutable law of life is change, and the superior
type of change is a change for the better. The
only man in the world that cannot find improve-
ment is the narrow-minded man who denies it
to himself and thus condemns himself to a life
of distress and suffering. The prophet of old
wrote : "Poverty and shame shall be to him that
refuseth instructions." (66) On the other hand,
the open-minded "learner", as the rays of the
sun draw their energy from the sun, will receive
illumination and profitable instructions from a
thousand sources which the close-minded man
never notices. "Blessed is the man that walketh
not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
in the way of the sinners, nor sitteth in the seat
of the scornful.'' (67)
DESIRE TO KNOW TRUTH
Life is dependent on air, water, breath and
that subtle something which we define as the
"life princi'ple" of the Universe, in other words,
the "Spirit" in which we· live and move and
have our being. The highest aim of existence is
to endeavor to live a perfect life. A perfect life
~27~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
means the possession of perfect health as a first
requisite. It takes no great capital or intelli-
gence to live the imperfect life of sickness and
suffering, and yet ignorant millions live "just to
suffer." Our birthright is perfection. "His work
is perfect", then let us enthusiastically work to
learn how to remove our steps from the dark
path of the valley to the safe broad summit of
the mountain top.
"Take fast hold of instruction: let her not
go; for she is thy life." (68) It is of the utmost
importance to possess health understanding.
When health is absent, the light and aspiration
of life fades too. "The wise man is teachable,
that is the reason he is wise." The stiff-necked
man refuses to learn, so he punishes himself.
The old prophet advises: "He that walketh with
wise men shall be wise." (69) A realization of
the Truth will dissipate every ill. Just as the in-
troduction of light floods out the darkness, so
will the entrance of the light regarding health
and disease banish every form and penalty of
the flesh.
AFFIRM, "THE LIGHT OF TRUTH
IS FOR ME."
We are born under exact laws which decree
health if obeyed, and attract disease if disobey-
ed. Our physical bodies are formed from the
food we eat, and if food is taken to excess, the
body becomes clogged and precious nerve ener-
gy is exhausted in endeavoring to digest, assim-
~zs~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
ilate and eliminate this unnecessary overplus of
food. When food is overcooked and when an ex-
cess of refined, concentrated food is eaten the
life element of the food is destroyed, and such
food will not build red blood, sturdy bones and
healthful tissues. When incompatible mixtures
of food are frequently consumed, such dishar-
monious combinations become a menace to
health and are the forerunners of various dire
and dangerous diseases. In order to preserve
our health and life we should learn to curb our
appetite and eat in moderation only, and choose
simple nourishing food, favoring to quite a de-
gree raw and cooked vegetables and fruits. The
significance of this verse means much to every
thinking person: "And the leaves of the tree
were for the healing of the nations." (70) When
those who are sick will conform to natural liv-
ing and sane eating, how much more quickly
will life restore the sufferers to. normal health
and wholeness.
KNOW THAT HEALTH IS A LAW
"But ask now the beasts, and tbey shall
teach thee." (71) When animals are indisposed
they stop eating and soon return to a condition
of ease and health. It is a grievous error to eat
heartily when ill; almost all physical suffering
is due to indiscreet eating so we lessen our
chances for quick recovery when we overload
our system with additional foodstuffs.
The mind of the flesh is the mind that is ad-
~29-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
dieted to things of the flesh, particularly the lure
of appetizing food. We often prevent God from
saving our lives by our reckless ways of eating
and living. "Fools because of their transgress-
ions and because of their iniquities are afflict-
ed." (72) Before we can have the permanent
assurance of health we must forsake the ways
of ignorant, wilful living and return to the ways
of moderation and harmony. Nothing seems to
be impossible in the province of "God Power."
"I will restore health unto thee, saith the Lord."
(73) "I will ransom them from the power of the
grave; I will redeem them from death." (74)
SICKNESS IS A SIN
No matter how dire our affliction, let us be-
lieve: "Behold, I will make all things new."
(75) Let us cease picturing ourselves as being
under the sway of pain and .suffering; let us put
up a sturdy resistance to weakness and assert
with all the energy and faith we 'POSsess, "God
can heal me, G·od can heal me."
The power that created and sustains the un-
iverse surely has the ability to re-create and
heal our physical ailments. The desire for a full-
er understanding of this Spiritual Power should
possess us. It can save us to the uttermost; it can
and will heal us the moment we begin to comply
with its necessary conditions.
On every hand men and women are suffer-
ing for lack of health. Knowledge is the key to
the whole situation. Exact knowledge that will
~30~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
unfold to us our triune nature and the method
whereby our three sides of life, body, mind and
spirit may be harmoniously managed. Our
minds dwell in our bodies, but God inhabits both
ol!lr minds and bodies. When we feed our bodies
the right physical food and when we supply our
minds with the proper spiritual food, then the
crown of life is ours and sickness as far as we
are concerned ends forever.
LIVING SHOULD BE A SEARCH
FOR TRUTH
Life is pregnant. with possibility when we be-
gin to live our best. "Understanding is a well-
spring of life unto him that hath it." (76) To
possess ·understanding and to put it in prac-
tice means to know how to live here on earth in
the demonstration of peace and health. "Give
me understanding and I shall live." (77) To
have understanding is synonymous with control,
the ability to rise above harassing conditions
and live in the light of perfect harmony and
truth. "For wisdom is a defense, but the excel-
lency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to
them that have it." (78) Life was never intend-
ed to be a downward drag. W(hen we find that
life is yielding sickness and discouragement we
should learn the cause is not the discrimination
of life against us, but merely a manifestation of
our personal unfitness and ignorance. ''The way
of life is above to the wise." (79) Consequent-
ly, when our way of life leads us to the confines
~al~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
of a sick bed, we should realize that wisdom is
lacking in our mode of living. It is a distinct
truth the way of him who is wise is an ascend-
ing way; when wisdom is absent in our plan of
life building our life's road bends downward to
the valley of limitation and suffering.
ALL DISTRESS SIGNIFIES ERROR
"Whoso is wise and will obs«!rve these
things, even they shall understand the loving
kindness of the Lord." (80) Potentially, life is
good and all is good, even suffering is valu-
able when it arouses us to the fact that we
are not in harmony with the powers of life and
we are actu:ally self made slaves and enemies
to ourselves. When the perception of our per-
sonal ignorance seeps into our brain it should
awaken our ambition to learn how to live bet-
ter so that life may cease interfering with us
and hampering us, even for our own good.
Some day all men will comprehend sickness,
and even death will be dominated by the Di-
vine Inheritance in man. Life is of God and life
is the greatest thing in the world and it is a sin
against God when sickness is accepted and tol-
erated as a natural part of life and living. Mil-
lions ignorantly imagine God visits us with af-
fliction, but in reality lack of understanding is
back of our punishment. The law of life is exact
and unchanging: the reaction to broken laws
means an affliction attracted by the transgres-
sor. If all men could transgress with impunity,
4-32-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
all life would speedily end on this earth. Con-
sequently, sickness is sent to force us to exam-
ine our ways so that we might mend them in the
light of truth enlightment, therefore all that ex-
ists is necessary for the growth of man, there-
fore all is good.
SICKNESS DISCLOSES FAULTY
LIVING
If faith alone could keep us well and strong,
the whole world might be rejoicingly well. But
alas "Faith without works is dead." The expres-
sion of even the deepest faith in itself will not
heal our bodies or save our lives. We must ex-
ercise faith; pray, affirm, give thanks. But, to
make our faith, prayers and affirmations potent
we too, must learn to work and act in the direc-
tion of health so as to earn and deserve life's
greatest of all blessings. The human will is part
ofDivineWill,and when we use our will to force
us to supervise our habits of eating, that is the
first step away from bodily suffering. Then we
should use our will to force us to walk in the
great out-of-doors each day and draw in mighty
draughts of health imparting ozone at the same
time. We should train our will to love the sun-
light and bask in its health unfolding rays at ev-
ery opportune time. We should train our will to
learn how to relax and conserve our strength
and vital energy so that we will have a reserve
force of vitality stored up for the future time of
possible need or stress.
E-33-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
LIFE IS PHYSICAL AND
SPIRITUAL
Life is not just a single phase of cosmic ex-
perience, it is many sided, and all sides of living
should be examined and studied. "My heart is
glad and my glory rejoiceth, 'my flesh also shall
rest in hope." (81) Over and over again in the
Bible we read of the many sides to our being.
Examine where you will, one- sidedness is al-
ways an illogical and dangerous philosophy.
True, the body is not the "real you", but the
"real you", our spiritual self, cannot express or
demonstrate save through its instrument thftl
body. Spirit and flesh are part of one stupend-
ous whole, and both are necessary and both
must be acknowledged and glorified if we are to
attain the high standard of health-mastery and
life-mastery. In the proportion that we gain life-
understanding we begin moving out of the plane
of suffering and pain. As we use our wisdom
concerning life and living, our physical stress
falls away. Our thoughts brighten, our step be-
comes agile, our body lightens, torment passes
and we realize the pure truth of this bygone
promise, "Thou art loosed from thine infirmity."
(82)
WISE LIVING ENDS SUFFERING
Before we can come into the ·state of per-
fect health which is unconsciousness of our
body, we must take on the yoke of obedience and
..-34-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
discipline of truth. Unless we forsake our sin-
ful, hurtful ways of living and thinking we will
find life a harsh taskmaster. Each man is his
own life-builder, and it is a pity if we are not
versed in exact ways of living so that life be-
comes a friend instead of a punishing oppressor.
We display the grossest ignorance in attaching
blame to conditions or others when sickness
rends us. It would be intelligent to turn within
and take stock of the quality of our thoughts
and the purity of our habits, and seek for the
true causes of our misfortune and endeavor to
remove them as speedily as possible. "Let the
wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous
man his thoughts." (83) When, we do our part,
something profitable will happen almost immed-
iately, but if we depend on others, or on life to
cure us, we have a sore and grievous disappoint-
ment waiting ahead.
MEN PUNISH THEMSELVES
"He that built all things is God." (84) No-
thing just happens, mind and purpose are back
of everything that lives and moves. There is a
perfect plan hidden somewhere, even in the
most adverse condition of affliction. What we
consider evil or imperfect is due to our Jack of
vision and understanding. When we enter into a
·realization of the truth we discover we were
mistaken and that God never errs; that he had
a Divine idea back of sickness because all that
is created comes from God, and even in bodily
...-35-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
suffering created by man there is a deep and
wise purpose and intention permeating it.
The only evil that can be attributed to sick-
ness is to remain in its clutch without learning
its cause and origin. Nothing can be lasting, and
even the direst and most obstinate pain and
physical distress will pass from us when we ap-
ply intelligent, natural and spiritual measures.
We should stoutly affirm, "All good is mine" at
the same time visualizing our bodies as becom-
ing free from pain and torment.
RISE ABOVE PAIN AND
WEAKNESS
The health of life awaits our demand. The
everlasting perfect health of God is within our
reach day or night. Simply 'Practice truth habits
and send out the call for help and power in the
consciousness. of true faith. "And whatsoever
we ask we receive of him, because we keep his
commandments and do those things that are
pleasing in his sight." (85) And again, "Call un-
to me and I will answer thee and shew thee
great and mighty things which thou knowest
not." (86) As we learn the inner ways of life we
discover how faulty and mediocre is our educa-
tion. Traversing the outer surface of existence
is not sufficient to lead us into the inner cham-
ber of high power. We must learn to sink shafts
leading to the essence and soul of life so that
we may speak with authority concerning the
+-36-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
deeper invisible phases of existence, never for-
getting that the unseen is the real.
THE UNSEEN SAVES AND
HEALS
To be well is to establish peace within.
When our bodies are racked with suffering, our
hearts and souls are disturbed and peace flees
from us. We are admonished to "Live in Peace",
(87) for true peace can become ours in but just
one way, the way of knowing. We are told, "Let
us therefore follow after the things which make
for peace." (88) Sickness is not conducive to
peace, nor is worry or anger. Peace is not at-
tracted through the expression of jealousy, fear
or weakness. Peace results from right thoughts,
clear motives and wise acts. When mental or
physical confusion reigns within, life is distort-
ed and injured extensively. But when we resol-
utely follow the way of health and peace, soon
the harmony of God becomes again a prominent
part of our life. "Mark the perfect man and be-
hold the upright, for the end of that is peace."
(89) "Great peace have they: that love thy law,
and nothing shall offend them." ( 90)
THE PEACE OF HEALTH
FOLLOWS FULFILLMENT OF
LAW
How earnestly we should concentrate on
that word law. Law governs everything in the
universe. We cannot think or move without con-
+-37-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
tacting some form of law. It is well to know that
health is a law, the result of compliance with
the basic conditions underlying man's threefold
nature, body, mind and s·pirit. How comforting
it is to learn that "great peace" is promised
those who love or obey the laws on which the
security and beauty of permanent health are
based. To live in attunement with the law means
we have safety now, and preservation from
stumbling or falling in the future.
Health thoughts should be stamped into our
consciousness so strongly that when contagious
or infectious diseases appear they will have no
effect upon us. Contagious and infectious diseas-
es are created by nature to strengthen the pow-
er of resistance to man's self made diseases of
civilization. The greatest health thought we can
unfold is the "fulfillment of the law conscious-
ness." To know, deep down in our souls, that we
have paid the requisite price for the gift of
health and that it is ours by right of this daily
discipline in health habits and health thoughts.
"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the command-
ments." (91) And what are these commands sup-
posed to be? To be abstemious in our intake of
food, in other words, to control our appetite; to
keep our body clean; to value air and sunshine
and to keep the mind clear and our thoughts
joyous and optimistic.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
DISEASE ENDS AS TRUTH IS
FOLLOWED
"The Joy of the Lord is your strength." (92)
Weakness is the darkest misery of life. Follow
this plan of action in health building for profit-
able and gainful results. We should ignore the
greatest point of suffering and turn to our great-
est point of strength. What we concentrate on
tends t.o multiply, what we disregard tends to-
ward stultification. When we discuss our old op-
erations and pains and fears, they re-light them-
selves and begin to grow afresh. When we dis-
cuss health and hope and faith, we rise above
the hurtful things and diminish them and en-
courage the growth and development of life's
essentials, such as health and ha'Ppiness. Life
always inclines to follow the trend of our held,
gripped thoughts. Thought has a far reaching
effect on every atom of our body, so we should
strive to encourage the type of thought that will
inspire us to higher altitudes of vision and
health. In other words we should endeavor to
magnify whatever strength we have. We should
aim to encourage its -increase and presently our
weakness will be overshadowed by our newly
developed concept of strength and health.
CONCENTRATE ON STRENGTH
When we allow ourselves to grow doubtful
and depressed concerning our health, we delay
the healing process. Let us shed every form of
+-39-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
doubt and disbelief, let us imbue every molecule
of our body with the idea of life and health. At
the same time audibly affirm, "God is my life
and I am a part of God's life, so the health of
God is mine." Wle are warned against the doubt-
ful attitude, "Neither be ye of doubtful mind."
(93) We are encouraged to express the cour-
ageous consciousness as consistently as possible.
"And be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind."
(94) "For God hath not given us the spirit of
fear, but of power and of love and of a sound
mind." ( 95)
A sound mind in a sound body, how desirable
are these great possessions. The chief quest of
life should be a rich and abundant life of health
and wisdom. These prized assets are not obtain-
ed without serious work and struggle. Constant-
ly should we train ourselves to seek and search
each passing day for these blessings of health
and understanding, for without them life is as
nothing. It is a sin to calmly accept a life of
sickness under the false impression that it is
necessary, or the idea that it is sent from God as
a form of punishment. Suffering will surely end
when we look up and learn how to rise above
the darkness of disease. "He brought me out of
a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my
feet upon a rock, and established my goings."

us
It is of little matter how deep we have al-
lowed ourselves to fall under the tyranny of suf-
fering. When we awaken to our own might and
power and trust in God, our stay in the mire and
darkness of illness will come to an immediate
termination.
Disease power is the earth's greatest ravag-
er and devastator, but disease wilts away under
the sun of truth and understanding. "The Lord
on high is mightier than the noise of many wat-
ers, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea."
(97) When the enemy shall come in like a flood,
the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard
against him." (98) Disease is commonly refer-
red to as an enemy because it prevents us from
doing what we want. When we are well, every-
thing lives for us; when we are afflicted, every-
thing seems to be set against us. But as dark-
ness ushers in the dawn, so can the standard of
"Health Truth" end all the darkness of suffer-
ing even though we have suffered year after
year without ceasing. When health is present it
is good to be alive. Without health life is just a
torment. Fortunately, however, we now are in
possession of the exact plan of living whereby
disease loses its power over us and we banish it
forever from our lives. "For the Lord thy God
bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks
+-41-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
of water, of fountains and depths that spring
out of valleys and hills." (99)
LOO~ ABOVE SICKNESS AND
DISCORD
Is it not comforting to know we are not con-
demned perpetually to a life of suffering, and
learn that as we gain in wisdom we lose our dis-
abilities. If we refuse or ignore the wisdom of
life, then of course we decree continued self hu-
miliation and self suffering. "If ye be willing
and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land."
(100) Life renders to each man according to his
deeds. If we choose to live according to God's
perfect plan and become obedient to his de-
mands, then we decree a life beautiful as our
reward. But when we do not choose to -live
rightly and harmoniously our future will most
assuredly yield much punishment and sorrow.
"Obey my voice and I will be your God and ye
shall be my people; and walk ye in all the ways
that I have commanded you, that it may be well
unto you." (101) Well is it to know, that as we
"sow we reap". Eternal justice, not uncertainty,
is back of all the processes and functions of hu-
man existence. We are warned, "'W.ho will ren-
der to every man according to his deeds.'' (102)
LIFE IS SOWING AND REAPING
Life is lived in harmony or out of harmony
with law. Our daily reactions are witnesses as to
the type of life we have elected to live. When
~42-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
we are careless and indifferent as to our habits
.and thoughts the reaction will come as a form
of punishment. When we watch our ways, and
obey the mandates of God's laws our life is a
sequence of joyous rewards. To sin is to suffer,
to obey is to live a life of radiant health. We are
all, each and every one of us, children of the
Most High, but we drag our heritage in the mire
when we elect to ignore, defy or disobey God's
laws of righteous living. "Though he were a
son, yet learned 'he obedience by the things
which he suffered." (103)
It is a frailty of man that he is not willing to
learn unless through his own personal experi-
ence. Few men are willing to learn through the
experience of other sufferers. We go the limit
in intemperate habits, which later in life are re-
sponsible for the ills to which human flesh is
heir. Let us change from our stubborn disobedi-
ent ways without delay, and seek the way of
health and peace so that the gladness of health
may reign once more within. And as we seek to
reform, let us declare, "I shall find the truth
and the truth shall set me free."
TRUTH IS BETTER THAN
EXPERIENCE
It is the privilege of every man to choose the
m.anner in which he will conduct his life. If we
are not versed in the principles of truth, we will
in all .probability choose incorrectly, and as a
result disharmony will occur. "Choose you this
~43--.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
day whom ye shall serve . . . but as for me and
my house, we will serve the Lord." (104) When
we choose rightly we have the consolation and
inspiration of sure protection. "There shall no
evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
nigh thy dwelling." (105) The life of the man
who is dedicated to the unfoldment of under-
standing will endure all the tempests and
storms of existence. "The house of the righteous
shall stand." (106)
When we decide to amend our erroneous
ways and search for the light of truth somehow
we will find our way back to hap·piness and
health. Our daily prayer should be "Lord grant
me wisdom." We may be willing enough to live
a life of harmony, but the necessary discipline
to assure health in abundance seems so over-
whelming that we delay our start on the road
to self health - the flesh is weak indeed. The
temptation to choose the easy way is the down-
fall of millions. Well it is to appreciate this ad-
monition, "Blessed is the man that endureth
temptation." (107) The true glory of life is
strength, to be strong of body and mighty in the
strength of faith. The race of life is not destined
to be won by the weak but by the strong.
Strength of body imparts courage and confi-
dence to mind and heart. To build a strong life
we should aim to live our best. We can never
reach the top of the mountain if we decide to
stop when we have climbed half way. "And let
. +-44-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
us not be weary in well doing: for in due season
we shall reap, if we faint not." (108)
AFFIRM, "I AM STRONG."
When we elect to follow the high way we
are strengthened because of our lofty choice.
The way of truth is hard at first, but the way
grows easier every day. Besides, the reward·will
more than compensate for all our expenditure
of effort. To be strong is a wholesome and wor-
thy desire. We lift our eyes to the hills for
strength, but too we find strength from wise
habits of living and the formation of a harmon-
ious state of mind. "Let the weak say I am
strong." (109) Well it is to affirm many times a
day, "My weakness passes and now I am
strong." Quiet and confident 'persistence in right
living will soon bring forth gratifying results,
strength will be increased, health will be im-
proved, peace will be re-born within. Life may
be a song or a cry, let us live so worthily that
life will ever be a glad, flowing song.
Not only should we desire to build 'Physical
strength, but also to become strong in wisdom.
"A wise man is strong; yea, a man of know-
ledge increaseth strength." (110) We do not
gain strength through fear, but through cour-
age. In the sanctuary of Truth we find not only
strength.and health, but courage also. It is wis-
dom personified to forsake little ways and trif-
ling thoughts and turn our face toward strength
ways and higher thoughts. Let us attune our
+-45-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
comings and goings to righteousness and thus
protect our present and future life. "The Lord
will give strength unto his people." (111) Not
only strength, but substance as well. "For the
Lord God is a sun and a shield: the Lord will
give grace and glory, no good thing will he
withhold from them that walk uprightly."
(112)
TRUTH ATTRACTS PEACE
The term a "Righteous Life" refers to a life
that is dedicated to harmony and desire to live
in accordance with the laws of life which are
likewise the laws of God. The living of a "Right-
eous Life" is our sole protection and insurance
against sickness and suffering. There are times
when even the man who is pledged to righteous
living will suffer from an accident or fall prey
to sickness but his desire to live his best will be-
come a shield of ·protection to him and speedily
he will be restored to health as before. "Many
are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord
delivereth him out of all of them." (113)
When all men discover the truth concerning
health, sickness will disappear from the earth.
Protection from disease is acquired in just one
way, to live the health way. It is no more dif-
ficult to live righteously than it is to live to suf-
fer. "In the house of the righteous is much treas-
ure." (114) Righteousness exalteth a nation."
(115) "Say ye to the righteous that it shall be
well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of
their doings.'' (116)
+-46-.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
REACTION IS AS THE QUALITY
OF THE ACTION
A tree is known by its fruit, the manner in
which we ordain to live our life determines the
quality of our life. Wie cannot find figs on a this-
tle plant, neither can we discover health in an
unrighteous life. The good life is a shining,
gleaming one, a life that radiates health and
healing to all. As we drop our anxious thoughts
and disease forming habits we create an inner
receptivity for mental brightness and the radi-
ance of health. "Blessed are they which hunger
and thirst after righteousness for they shall be
filled." (117)
Inertness often holds us back from gaining
the kingdom of health. We lack initiative and
driving force, consequently we dally with pro-
crastination and postponement and life is over
before we realize what existence means. Failure
after failure is r ecorded because of our weak
habit of holding: back, we are fearful to investi-
gate life, afraid to take the offensive in a sweep-
ing drive against pain and disease. Failure al- ·
ways attends those who neglect to help and im-
prove themselves. Life being the soul of justice
cannot reward those who do not strive in the
right direction. "They that seek the Lord shall
not want any good thing." (118) However, let us
not attempt to force issues or overstrive in any
way. Health is so necessary the greatest and
most perfect boon that comes from God. Yet the
.-47~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
way to win back health is by degrees, little by
little, not by high ·pressure methods or a force.
And so, after we have patiently endured we ob-
tain the promise. "But let patience have her per-
fect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
wanting nothing." (119)
AFFIRM, "I AM THE SOUL OF
PATIENCE."
The chief danger of sickness is falling into
a state of despair, losing all hope of recovery.
When we are plunged into the throes of des-
pondency let this gleam of hope illumine the
dark places of our mind, "With God nothing
shall be impossible." (121) When we trust God
and turn to him for deliverance we do not move
in vain. His promise is, "And I shall put my
spirit in you and ye shall live." (121) "Where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." (122)
Courage, hope, faith and love promote health
and prolong life. It is difficult to be glad and
cheerful in the presence of bodily pain and suf-
fering, but the encouragement of bright think-
ing is earth's most potent medicine.
The old and erroneous advice offered the
sick to trave-l or to have a change of climate was
both costly and unwise unless it is to escape
well intentioned but health ignorant loved ones.
Sickness loses its power over the human frame
when right thinking and temperance in eating
are introduced and made a constant part of our
daily life.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
HEALTH IS EVERYWHERE-
CLAIM HEALTH NOW
Every good influence should be employed in
combatting disease. Mild exercise, daily walk-
ing, vital food, Vitalic Breathing, prayer, faith,
affirmations, herbs, everything that is good and
. helpful may be used in our fight to win back
health and increased life. Our personal respon-
sibility should be stressed at all times. Accord-
ing to the quality of our habits, so is the quality
of our life. When we are ill it is a living message
from life flashed to us that our habits are faulty.
Though we personally believe our habits are
the very best, that does not make them so. The
true value of our mode of living is indexed in
the health or non-health of our bodies. If we are
sick, we are in ignorance. Ii we wish redemp-
tion from suffering, we must return to the way
of life-understanding. If we decide to wait for
this enlightenment to come to us, we will wait _
in vain. Perfection comes from seeking and
searching for the ways and laws of perfection
in living. We are surrounded by light, yet often
we are content to sit in darkness. Great is our
hunger, yet many starve amid plenty. It is all
due to dimness of vision, the healing supply is
·· always here, but through our closed eyes we
cannot sense it. Our earnest hourly prayer
might profitably be "Open lhou mine eyes, that
I may behold wondrous things out of thy law."
(123)
HEALTH IS IN YOU
OPEN YOUR MIND TO TRUTH
God never intended men to be born into a
sufferjng ·existence. God delights in joy and
healthfulness. Christ said, "I am come that they
might have light and that they might have it
more abundantly." (124) Many men and wom-
en are never ill because they live in harmony
with the laws of life. Illness is kept at a distance
when harmony of law is observed. Illness is ir-
resistibly attracted when ignorant or wilful
modes of living are practiced. To the sick the
world is filled with suffering. To the well the
world is heaped with joy. The change from the
dark viewpoint is made possible by improving
our state of health. Strike a lusty blow this in-
stant against the clouds of pain. Let us cease
dwelling on the gloom of suffering. Let us look
beyond our ill health away beyond the pall of
d:arkness and realize the truthfulness of the
prophetic promise, "Then shall thy light break
forth as in the morning." (125)
THE LIGHT OF TRUTH IS FOR
YOU
Sickness is usually alluded to in the term of
darkness, and it is indeed the deepest of all
darkness. But it may be changed from a per-
manent and fixed cloud into a passing fog that
will melt away with the coming of the dawn.
We are advised to "pray without ceasing"'
(126) and the mightiest of all prayers the sick
+-60-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
man can offer is not for healing but for power
that will enable him to help him to heal him-
self. w;hen sickness comes, heavy is its hand
and weary is the human frame that must bear
its soul crushing burden. But even the worst
form of disease can be mastered when we re-
gret our sins and turn to the light of healing.
Those who are sick should strive to turn their
attention from their travail of soul and concen-
trate on that seemingly inaccessible blessing
good health. Make health desire a soul hunger
and God will not withhold health and strength
from any sufferer. If our desire to be well is but
a half-hearted, feeble, partial wish, we cannot
hope to win. But when we work and pray with
the intensity of our whole being the reward will
come, as God is in his Heaven to save, not to de-
stroy. Well it is when our hearts are troubled
with darkness to cry out into the night, "The
light is for me, I want the light, the light is
mine, the light is for me." And just as surely as
we call so will we hear the healing word of old,
"Neither do I condemn thee; go thy way and sin
no more/' (127)
DISEASE IS BUT DARKNESS OF
LIVING
It is the duty of man to investigate when he
is sick. The best form of investigation is this
self question. Am I doing all 'POssible to remove
the cause of my distress? There can be no sick-
ness without a cause. The world treats symp-
+-51-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
toms and neglects causes, consequently the
whole world is sick and troubled. Nothing hap-
pens from nothing. Sickness does not come of
itself, it is created by the transgression of life's
laws. The violation of law may be accidental or
unconscious, but that in no way excuses the suf-
ferer. Man is placed here on earth by God to
learn how to live well. He is endowed with
mind, brain and senses, and if he fails to use
them for his own benefit and health preserva-
tion, the fault is his very own. It all goes back
to the warning admonition, "With all thy get-
ting get understanding." (128) We pay a too
high price for ordinary things when we neglect
to obtain the greatest thing of all-life wisdom.
"He that keepeth understanding shall find
good." (129)
KNOW, AND FOLLOW THE WAY
OF TRUTH
Men of extensive education are ill because
knowledge is never life-wisdom or understand-
ing. Men who put their trust in other men or in
the dimension of the flesh are ill because ordin-
ary understanding does not grant immunity
from the contraction of disease. Men who are
young, gay, gifted are ill because there is a vit-
al lack in their lives; they do not know the truth
about the laws of health, therefore they are un-
able to win back the health they have allowed
to slip through their fingers. Men who refuse
to learn that suffering is self made will continue
.-62~
.,
HEALTH IS IN YOU
to suffer from their false viewpoint. The door to
a life of everlasting health and strength is lab-
eled "Understanding". To believe there is any
other way is a lie and a self delusion.
"Happy is the man who findeth wisdom and
getteth understanding. For the merchandise of
it is better than the merchandise of silver, and
the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more
precious than rubies and all the things thou
canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
Length of days are in her right hand, and in her
left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways
of pleasantness, and all her . paths are peace.
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon
her, and happy is every one who retaineth her."
(130) With life wisdom our expectation for a
better life increases. Nothing can be denied us
when we know. It is only when we refuse to
learn and merely guess and hope and drift that
uncertainty seizes hold of our lives. The man
who refuses to study his body and the laws of
Nature and of God working in him stands con-
demned as a foolish man. The man who pro-
claims himself as being all wise and who mocks
at truth is not only a fool but likewise he is self-
deceived because he rejects to examine the
truth concerning life and health. "If a man
thinketh himself to be something when he is no-
thing, he deceiveth himself." (131) ·
FIND LIBERATION IN TRUTH
Health freedom is never found in error, but
+-58-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
disease springs from that source. Health is ever
. found in truth, and to unwaveringly pursue
truth will in due time reveal good health, as
physical wholeness is akin to truth.
When we examine the life of Christ we learn
·he was perfect through obedience to God's laws.
Jesus lived an outdoor life, he walked a great
deal, he meditated and fasted, all factors of the
utmost benefit in the building of good health.
Jesus took time to think, but the modern man
says he is too busy to think, so he shirks thought
and investigation of the really important facts
of life and as a result he lacks the protection of
understanding. Thus he invites constant suffer-
ing and pain. Life should be rich, fragrant and
power filled, it cannot just become that way,
but it can be built that way by purposeful
thought and intelligent action.
KNOWLEDGE IS THY MIGHT
A clearer knowledge of life is the world's
greatest need. In order to be at our best we
should become familiar with the basic attrib-
utes which govern existence. A true knowledge
of Natural Laws is the foundation of real life
education. Our chief safeguard against disease
is to learn how to prevent its occurrence in our
life. This knowledge is needed by all, it is as nec-
essary as breathing and sleep. Nature testifies
to the handiwork of God. Man, the most marvel-
ous of all living creatures, is the supreme crea-
tion of God. Notwithstanding man's majesty
....54-.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
and surpassing inheritance, he early in life falls
a victim to disease and tribulations which low-
eranimalsavoid. In spite of man's privileges and
culture he is still lamentably ignorant in respect
to his triune nature and.its proper management.
A human being is composed of food, water, oxy-
gen and spirit. Neither water, air or spirit will
alone or together keep man alive. Food too is
needed for the normal functioning of the life
processes and the maintenance of life. Every
cell, tissue, bone, sinew, nerve and blood dro'p
takes on the same quality as the food that is
consumed day by day. Therefore the first under-
standing of physical life is to recognize that our
bodies are built by the food we eat. The various
materials eaten determine the exact quality and
stability of the edifice. Likewise does the food
we eat day after day decree the quality of our
personal health.
RIGHT FOOD AND RIGHT
THOUGHTS ATTRACT HEALTH
There never was nor can there ever be a true
science of health unless it is based on the found-
ation of truth regarding diet as being the chief
causative factor in breaking down health and
thereby causing old age and death. The cry of
the body is for live foods, but most people stuff
the body with overcooked devitalized foods
which are incapable of building pure blood and
rugged health. In order to digest food properly
and accelerate a f1·ee circulation of the blood a
+-00-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
knowledge of breath science is essential. Man
is allowed to breathe at will so that he may
learn to breathe consciously whenever the body
is in a state of motion. This important truth is
not known or is ignored by the unthinking man,
so the multitudes are but half alive. "The Spirit
of God hath made me, and the breath of the Al-
mighty hath given me life." (132) ·
The wilful disregard for the first two car-
dinal principles back of health is the outstand-
ing cause for the frightful suffering of human-
ity. No rapid progress in the prevention of dis-
ease will take 'place until we understand the
first reality of health lies in food and breath un-
derstanding. God wants men to be happy and
free from physical distress, but men are not
willing to so live that they may indeed demon-
strate life as the perfect image and likeness of
God.
HAVE TRUTH AS YOUR
AUTHORITY
Man makes himself wretched because he is
stubborn in adherence to error. He continues to
abuse his body because of his fleshly appetites.
lie vainly imagines he can continue to overeat
or overwork and still maintain ·a full measure
of health. But laws are made to be observed,
not broken and whether it be a physical, men-
tai, or spiritual law that is transgressed present-
ly life presents the bill in the shape of physical
torment or suffering, and the sinner must pay
.-56-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
and pay until sin ceases or death intervenes. "I
shall put 'my spirit in you and ye shall live and I
will place you in your own land." (133) The
Spirit of God is in every human being, it is there
to play on the body which is the only means of
spiritual expression. When the body is abused
and mismanaged, the Divine Spirit is unable to
express the full measure of life harmony that it
should express. The fault is not God's, it is oc-
casioned by the individual. When the body is
cared for intelligently, harmony flies to it and
health possesses it. When ignorance rules the
management of the body, discord appears and
disease is attracted.
SICKNESS FOLLOWS FAULTY
HABITS OF LIVING
There is one inflexible, unchanging life prin-
ciple, whenever sicknss or 'pain is present it is
there because of folly or ignorance. Never, nev-
er, can suffering lift its head unless unwise
methods of living have preceded it. Men should
become teachable in health matters. The pro-
phet solemnly warns us, "Cease from thine own
wisdom." (134) Unfortunately the wisdom of
man as a general rule when it refers to health
is the opposite to Infinite wisdom. But man in
his blind conceit or satisfaction is incapable of
comprehending that he is far afield from the
truth. He continues to carry on with his eyes
closed and ends his existence in the mire of the
ditch of blindness of living. "But they regard
+-57-.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
not the work of the Lord, neither have they con·
sidered the operation of his hands. Therefore,
·
my people are gone into captivity because they
have no knowledge." (135)
The only lasting, unbeatable, invincible de-
fense of life is to know the pure truth concern-
ing the laws and realities of life. "For wisdom is
a defense and money is a defense, but the excel-
lency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life
to them that have it." (136) From the 'Pages of
the past and present we read the commanding
admonition of life, "Know or suffer, know or
die." There is no way possible to dodge or es-
cape the penalty of transgression. Life knows
all and pays us according to our worth, not ac-
cording to our own imperfect estimate. When
our payment is in the shape of punishment let
us not increase our ignorance and guilt by cry-
ing out against the cruelty of life. Let us turn
within and examine our mode of living and dis-
cover where we have personally erred and
thereby created the physical distress that has
seized us.
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE IS A
MOCKERY
Life may become almost burdenless when
we live so beautifully and intelligently that our
life payment will be health, peace, ease and
hap·piness. But if we have to bear a burden it is
well to remember, save in rare instances; it is
self-created. "Every man shall bear his own
-t--58~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
burden." (137) In life education it is well to
know that all things pertaining to life are im-
portant, so wise is the man who has the broad-
est possible conception of the art of living. Not
only must we become students of our physical
plan and learn how to select pure food and gov-
ern and subdue our appetite and practice filling
our lungs many times each day with God's
breath of life, but also fill our minds with joy-
ous thoughts. In addition, we must revere the
power of the spirit and utilize it every hour of
the day. "And the Spirit of the Lord will come
upon thee, and thou . • . shalt be turned into
another man." (138) ·
CHANGE FOR THE BETTER
When we renounce our old ignorant disease
attracting ways we find that life purges us from
our pains and aches. "Thy iniquity is taken
away and thy sin is purged." (139) The old life
of suffering and unreality has· passed away and
is forgotten and a new and vaster existence is
spread before us. It is a grievous sin to submit
for a single hour to the torturing hand of suffer-
ing. The!tender, Divine Hand of God is stretch-
ed forth to save and sustain us when we are suf-
ficiently advanced to know that of ourself we
can do nothing. "Call upon me in the day of
trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glor-
ify me." (140) The chief way in which God de-
lights in glorification is in the improved health
and happiness of his erring children. The nat-
E-59-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
secrets of everlasting health and life. But are
we not the sons and daughters of life, and what
parent would deny life to his child! Life never
withholds from us; it is men and women who
are to blame, they withhold from life. Men will
not heed the voice of life, they ·claim to have no
time to discover the secrets of untroubled living.
So they go down to their premature grave after
a greater or lesser degree of pain and suffering.
Let us unstop our unresponsive ears for a mo-
ment and let the chain and fetter breaking pro-
mise of old enter and tell us of the plan where-
by we can find the solution to every anxiety and
life problem. "Ask and it shall be given you,
seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be op-
ened unto you." (144) That single statement
contains the solution of every trouble that has
ever touched humanity.
KNOW THAT WHICH IS
VALUABLE
The greatest ignorance of all is to fail to be-
come a true judge of values, to be unable to re-
cognize the spu:dous from the real, the false
from the true. It is the nature of man to choose
the easy way instead of learning that power
does not come from ease but from effort. To live
so that we deserve the highest and best from
life means eternal vigilance on our part and
above all compliance with the laws of life. The
glory of health enjoyment is the highest and
most important of all earthly blessings. When
+-12-+
HEALTH IS lf\1 YOU
health is absent, misery abounds. When health
abounds, joy unconfined is present. Is it not
good to wage a fight for health and the attend-
ant joy that follows its presence? Nothing for
nothing is the law; of the universe. There would
be no sense or justice in living if we could get
something for nothing. When we fulfil condi-
tions, when we meet the requirements that will
ensure us perfect health, then and then only
does it become ours. If the seeking of health is
held out to be simple and easy, we are being de-
ceived. The joy of perfect health can only be
o'btained through strict denial, rigid discipline
and everlasting vig.ilance against disease form-
ing habits. We can always be sure we have lost
our way if we imagine health can be found by
any other process.
PRACTICE THAT WHICH IS GOOD
When we harmonize with God's laws as ex-
emplified in Nature, we cannot hide or separate
ourselves from health. It will attend us all
through life. Likewise if we decide to ignore
the laws of Nature and of God we cannot escape
the reaction of disease, and suffering will be
our shadow thereafter. As: the wise man studies
the habits of humanity he discovers immediate-
ly what seems to be a great conspiracy waged
against the health and life of all the people.
Every form of advice that would inform the
people as to the danger of acid forming food
and its deleterious action on bodily health is
+-63-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
fought or more or less rigidly suppressed.
Search one thousand grocery stores and outside
of uncooked fruits and vegetables practically
all other foodstuffs are acid formers and health
diestroying agents. Our sincere desire ought to
be to learn how to stay well and to be able to
recognize the foods that are inimical to health
and endeavor to avoid them as we would a mad
dog. Our daily prayer should be, "Thou wilt
shew me the path of life." (145) The way of
health winds upward, that is the true path of
life. To stay on that ascending way we have to
be food-wis.e and food-minded so that we will
not poison our body cells and bleach away our
youth by these tempting acid foods which fill
our hospitals, jails, asylums, and lavishly feed
our cemeteries with self destroyed men and wo-
men.
AS OUR HABITS IS LIFE A CRY
OR A SONG
A long life, inner peace and a healthy body
are laudable desires, and they may be attained
by wise habits of living. "He is in the way of life
that keepeth instructions." (146) There can be
no perfect sense of security unless we know the
rules of health and follow them assiduously day
after day. The well-spring of life is understand-
ing and without it the joy of living will be con-
stantly marred by: physical suffering. When our-
thoughts center on unrestrained, unintelligent
eating and drinking there is but one harvest
4-64-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
awaiting us, suffering and still more suffering.
"For to be carnally minded is death, but to be
spiritually minded is life and peace." (147)
When we refuse to curb our excited appetites
and concentrate on the pleasures of eating and
entertainment we are living after the flesh and
in so doing we invite sickness and death to flow
to us. But the man who endureth temptation
and trains his will to resist the lure of much
food will be crowned with length of days and
unconsciousness of flesh.
The cry of every sufferer should not be for
health or healing but to be shown the way to
find health for himself. We develop into weak-
lings when we train ourselves to become lean-
ers. We should not ask for healing but for illum-
ination so that we can follow God's perfect plan
of helping ourselves. Let those who are ill af-
firm, "Shew me thy ways 0 Lord; teach me thy
paths." (148) Then in some subtle, mysterious
manner a book will be handed to us or a mes--
senger will .appear and the call of our soul will
be answered and we will find that long forgot-
ten way back to health and the life abundant.
THE WAY OF HEALTII IS OPEN
TO ALL
Life offers us life when we dare to walk the
narrow but right way. Few walk in this path of
safety, but those who discipline themselves and
seek its security and safety are immune to the
many, ills which plague those who refuse the

HEALTH IS IN YOU
protection of "God's way of health and life/'
The broad, easy way of life is strewn with myr-
iad sufferers. Poor souls by the millions, victims
of bad eating habits, clutter up the sides of this
roadway of destruction. The grievously. ill move
slowly along the sides of the road, the young
dance gaily along the center of the way of sick-
ness and death. They are too immature and un-
seeing to notice that their own condition a few
years hence is represented in those who now
painfully drag themselves slowly along, tortur-
ed by their dietetic sins and intemperance of the
past. God speaks to all sinners, "Walk ye in all
the ways that I have commanded you, that it
·may be well unto you." (149) There is but one
step to take to change sickness into health, and
that step is "habit reformation." We are all
walking bundles of habits, and our accumulated
habits bless or curse us. · The reaction to bad
habits create physical pain and suffering. The
reaction to good habits create physical ease and
good health. If our intemperate habits have a
greater grip on us than our desire for health,
we continue to suffer until merciful death deliv-
ers us from our own self created suffering. How
we should be on our guard to prevent self de-
filement through our ignorance of the influence
of our daily diet and the part it plays in build-
ing health or disease. What man knows th~t ev-
ery cell and blood drop of his body is composed
of the food he has eaten in the past. Few men
know this vital truth, so the vast majority of
+-66-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
men are deceived as to the reason of disease
and rarely blame the tr\le cause of all the suf-
fering of ignorant humanity. · ·
PAIN IS LIFE'S GREATEST
TEACHER
It is comforting to understand that pain is
not necessarily a permanent condemnation.
Pain like darkness will pass when light is intro-
duced. Suffering is the darkness of ignorant
ways and disease forming habits. Pain will con-
tinue just so long as we continue to transgress
wilfully or unknowingly. When our habits are
changed and our wrong modes of living mend-
ed, then suffering ceases but not before. We are
not living in a world of chance but in a world of
law and order. It is strange how we sympathize
with the sick instead of rebuking them for their
sins and teaching them how to live wiser and
better. Those who are well are really entitled
to ap'probation and praise for their intelligence
in discovering how to eat right and think right
and thus remain well and fit. But almost invari-
ably we lavish our prayers and our sympathies
on those who have lived ignorantly and thus
created their own travail and ill health. Did not
Jesus say "Sin no more lest a worse· thing. ~ome
upon you/' (150) Life is ready to reward us
with a brand new existence when we are ready
to return to the ways of moderation, sobriety,
temperance, unselfishness and truth. Not only
\-Vill we re-establish health within us but youth
.-67-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
and beauty also. "His fteah aball be freaher than
a child'•; he ahall return to the cla:r• of hia
youth." (161) ·
TURN FROM LOWER THINGS TO
ffiGHER
Every move and thought in the direction of
health will bring about a distinct improvement
in body and mind. Just as the Eternal Justice of
life metes out su.ffering to the sinner so will it
repay hea,lth to him who followeth the health
laws of God. No evil pursues the doer of the
word, but trouble flows immutably to him who .
ignores the truth or sins against it. In the days
of our youth life flows along like a song and we
drift with the tide depending on our parents for
guidance and food. If our parents are lacking in
life-wisdom we are most likely to be illy instruc-
ted and improperly fed. Then as we emerge into
middle life the seeds of wrongr living fed to us
in our youth can no longer be subdued by the in-
ner healing forces of the body. Our power of re-
sistance is broken down through daily poison-
ing fl"Qm acid forming meals, and disease ap-
pears under some one of its many tagged cog-
nomens. Then tragedy after tragedy takes
place. Not comprehending there is a cause be-
hind the disease which is but a symptom or vis-
ible symbol of faulty living in the past, the
sufferer presents himself to have the symptom
tnated or cured. Meanwhile he continues to
feed the disease forming fuel to his body in the

shape of wrong food and dark thinking and so
the vicious circle is welded complete and can
never be broken save through chance enlighten-
ment as to the true facts of the case or by the
intervention of death.
LIKE BRINGS LIKE
This almost universal ignorance of the cause
of disease is not confined to the poor or to the
laboring classes. Kings, Presidents, Educators,
Ministers, Physicians, Rulers, Scientists and
Teachers are as lamentably ignorant of the
truth as the slimly educated masses. These men
in high places sicken and die as the poor do, be-
cause they do not know nor will they take the
time to investigate the truth concerning health
·truths. Primarily and basically life is sowing
and reaping. We cannot expect a bountiful har-
vest when we sow meagrely. We cannot hope to
create strong bones and pure blood and vibra'nt
health if devitalized materials are fed to the
body in the shape of food. Miracles do not hap-
pen in life; a tree brings forth fruit according
to its kind not according to speculation or
chance. When improper food is habitually used
there can be but one result, a change of body
tissue, the forerunner o:Ji disease and premature
old age. The almost universal system of eating
acid forming foods creates an omnivorous un-
natural appetite which simply cannot be as-

.Sickness lias come into the world through
the ignorance of health fundamentals. Sickness
caii Be_driven out of the world in just one way,
through the constant practice and discipline. of
natural health laws not selfish, man niade, er-
roneous laws. The peopie hav~ trusted to man
for centuri'es but man has failed ignominiously;
disease and sutfedng are found everywhere and
the whole earth is in the throes of weakness.
The wise use of life will grant us immunity from
the hand of disease. In order to discover how to
us~ life we must study nature and co-operate
with God. It is only by taking these steps that
we can find peace from pain· and physical tor-
ment. Not only is God the God of the Spirit but
also the God o-f the physical. "I am the Lord, the
God of all tleah, ia there anything too hard for
me."' (153) Some day in the distant future man-
kind will grow out of. weariness and weakness.
Some day a new morriing of health promise will
dawn 'for all men as it has dawned for a few
men today. Each man can hasten the coming of
that golden dawn of glorious health promise if
he will in-cline his ear toward the Divine voice
that calls out "Conte unto. me all ye that labor
+-70-+

and are heavy laden and I will give you rest."
(154) Rest and healing are ours the moment we
move out of our self made prison house of suf-
fering and get back to the way of truth and
right living.
SICKNESS IS SELF-MADE
There are four forms of disease, congenital
which is quite rare, contagious which is a neces-·
sary measure for the perpetuation of life, also
functional and organic diseases self made.
Functional diseases are all more or less suscept-
ible to suggestion, affirmation and prayer. Or-
ganic diseases are deep-seated, advanced and
usually stubborn in healing because of change
of tissue and inner congestion. However, the
most incurable organic disease is subject to al-
leviation or cure through the medium of faith
and affirmation. However, when a change of
diet is employed in corroboration with prayer
and faith often even an incurable condition can
be restored to normality. The sufferer must nev-
er lose heart, he must keep turning hither and
thither until he finds the method that will cor-
rect his suffering. There is a supply somewhere
and the one who never abandons hope may in
due time find the 'Path to redemption. Men do
not know what they do, so God's sustaining
hand is ever ready to lift those who are fallen
when they call upon him. We are not placed
here just merely to transgress and suffer the re-
sulting punishment. We are here to enjoy

health and happiness and to live our best.
Though our transgressions are as thick as a
dark cloud every one can be blotted out and for-
gotten if we turn from the sins we have commit-
ted and observe the laws of life. "And I will
cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby
they have sinned against me, and I will pardon
all ·their iniquities whereby they have sinned
and whereby ·they have transgressed against
me." (155)
RECOGNIZE THAT WHICH IS
TRUE
The way to health is known only to a few
people. More than ninety-nine per cent of the
people of the earth are misinformed or live in
health-darkness. When a man is sick he is blind-
ed; he has lost his sense of direction; he is
struggling for the light to guide him back to
health, but those he trusts for guidance suffer
from self same diseases themselves, so the blind
leads the blind and both die. Struggling, dim-
eyed-exploited humanity self deceived or de-
luded by personal ignorance or exploited by
selfish interests, working chiefly for personal
gain. Men rarely take time to think, they drift
along with the tide of life, scarcely giving a
thought to the prevention of disease. Presently,
the inevitable reaction to sinning ways appears
in the shape of a suffering body. After a process
of unnatural, man-devised treatments, a tem-
porary improvement may appear. But with the
+-72~
HEALTH IS IN YOU
continuance of the past sins of gluttony, indo-
lence or dark thinking, the disease re-appears
again in the same guise or often in some other,
far more dangerous form. "Whoso keepeth the
commandment shall feel no evil thing." (156)
To protect ourself against a living death of pain
and suffering we have to keep informed as to
what constitutes the real principles of health.
EVERY MAN IS BORN UNDER
LAW
Law is King in the whole universe, and when
health laws are obeyed the joy of good health
follows as certainly as the day follows the night.
When health laws are infringed there can be
but one result, disease. The understanding and
practice of health principles ensure good
health always. There never was, there never
can be a substitution for the personal observ-
ance of law. Friends, neighbors and loved ones
will sicken and die, but the man who follows
the laws of health and of life will be preserved.
"A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thou-
sand at thy right hand, but it shall not come
nigh thee." (157) Others may stumble and fall
and be victims of accidents, but those who are
attuned with the laws of life and of God are
protected and guarded to the highest degree.
The power that delivers men from sickness and
death is knowing the law and utilizing it day
by day. "Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely
and thy foot shall not stumble." (158) The ever-
+-73--.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
lasting arms of God are ever ready to sustain
those who decide to walk in the light and fulfill
the divine conditions that will ensure a perfect
life of health and harmony.
TRAIN AND PRACTICE IN
HEALTH WAYS
When the spirit of laziness seizes us we will
find it exceedingly difficult to walk in the way
of harmony and truth. To live a life of power
and health means there is much to do before
we can deserve the rewards and rich abundance
of life. "In the morning sow thy seed, and in the
evening withhold not thy hand." (159) The
good life is a busy one. It means e~ernal vigil-
ance, study, seeking, and above all practicing
laws and principles of truth. Knowing the truth
should not make us indolent. By our knowledge
and also by our labor in following truth prin-
ciples a beautiful life can be created and enjoy-
ed. Knowledge alone will not ensure us good
health, we must apply and use our knowledge
then we are assured that because of our worthi-
ness no good thing can be withheld from us. The
hearer of the word still remains in the ranks of
the ignorant until he resolves to utilize the
knowledge he has gleaned. Good health is a de-
light and its·simplicity of attainment is within
the reach of every thinking man. Health is not
barred to any man, save by the indifference or
limitation of the individual. fin order to enjoy
money and cu'lture, good he'alth is essential
+-74--.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
There is no substitute for health in all the
world, but it must be bought and paid for. The
price which life demands for physical whole-
ness is personal effort, adopting health building
habits, thinking rightly, living harmoniously,
eating vital foods in moderation, and loving our
neighbor as ourself. Living such a type of life
means health, happiness and continuous profit.
"And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and
satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy
bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden
and like a spring of water, whose waters fail
not." (160)
FULFILL ALL THE LAWS OF
HEALTH
Never should we forget that life is three
planed, body, mind, spirit. In all planes of being
there is a wrong and right way: to live. Suffering
attends the harmful method of o·perating life in
any or all of its planes. We are unlimited in our
potentialities when we discover our powers and
put them to work to heal and restore us to rad-
\ant health. There is much error or self decep-
tion in referring to the term Truth. Truth is not
one-sided or limited in any way. The Truth con-
cerning health and healing means the under-
standing of the laws of body, mind and spirit
and the intelligent and consistent use of these
Iaws. Truth means living toward truth ways and
noting an increased, expanded life as a result
of this superior method of living. Those who live
~75-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
in the truth are guided, guarded and protected
because of the majestic power which the prac-
tice of Truth wields. Followers of truth in all
sides of being can with perfect assurance and
profound authority affirm, "Because I am a stu-
dent and follower of Truth ways I am unbeat-
able and invincible, so come what may I am pre-
pared."
ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE IN
TRUTH
Health, happiness and wisdom will follow
the application of the laws of truth and life.
The first move toward the restoration of health
is to get back into the harmony of our triune
nature. The harmony of our whole being is the
equal and superior of even the most direful dis-
ease. "With God all things are possible." (161)
God is the artificer of man's body, mind and
spirit, and when we harmonize with God's rules
and regulations governing man then the contact
is made and the healing accomplished. When
we rout our faulty sense mind and insta I the
perfect mind harmonious we will not be so
prone to impose too much food on our stomach
or burden our\minds with thoughts of fear, wor-
ry and stress. }Let us learn not to limit the de-
gree of health which we should possess. Let us
not accept any physical bondage whatsoever.
Whatever condition of the body that inhibits
our happiness or prevents us from living tri-
umphantly must be expelled from our life. Our
+-76-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
Divine heritage is "P.cace be unto thee, fear not,
thou shalt not die." (162) More and more we
should stress our Divinity ·as children who are
born into a rich inheritance. Millions dwell on
the darker idea concerning life, they imagine
that we are destined and condemned to an ex-
istence of travail and suffering. This is a faulty
idea as those who live in the harmony of God's
laws seldom get sick or have to undergo suffer-
ing.
WHAT WE FEAR WE ATTRACT
·Even the sins and omissions of our parents
can be prevented from reflecting upon us if we
live in the light and truth of a perfe.ct and har-
monious life. Let us strive to cast fear out of our
lives, as that which we fear as a rule has no
foundation in fact. Particularly we should wage
war against the fear of a weak or tainted inher-
itance. Such apprehension unfits us and prevents
us from expressing a courageous, gainful ca-
reer. Resolve to trust these promises, "In God
have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what
~n can do to me." "I will not be afraid what
flesh can do unto me." (163) "Yea, though I
walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me." (164)
W.hen sickness clutches our body, we should
not fear it, rather should we bestir ourself to
the understanding that it is a personal.fight to
be waged to rid ourselves of the enemy within
+-77-.
HEALTH IS IN YOU
our gates. We should visualize that we are crea-
ted in the perfect image and likeness, and as
long as we are in pain we are unworthy custod-
ians of our body. The body can live forever be-
cause we are distinctly told "the last enemy to
overcome will be death." (165) Disease, too, is
an enemy, because, if it remains unchecked it
will end even the strongest and most virile life.
Men have not learned how to harness the pow-
ers of body, mind and spirit, and as a conse-
quence men are condemned to suffering and
premature death. When we know the facts of
life we become cognizant of the exact manner
by which we prevent or dissipate disease, and
accordingly being wise we may live to rejoice,
not to suffer. Let us not listen to the babblings
of ignorant men who urge us to accept suffering
as a cross from the Lord. Let us defend ourselves
against those who would pretend to cure us with
untrue or impossible methods. "Understanding
is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; but
the instruction of fools is folly." (166)
WHAT WE HOPE FOR WE
CREATE
When men take time to meditate and reflect
purposefully and intelligently they will come in-
to the realization that each man is the manager
and builder of his own personal life. If all is
well with him, he proves that he is a worthy life
governor and builder. If he has allowed weak-
ness or sickness to creep upon him then he
+-78-.
·'

demonstrates his stewardship is of shoddy
quality. Rarely do we find men who are suf-
ficiently advanced to recognize they are person-
ally responsible for the type of life which they
daily manifest. Each man decrees the degree of
his life whether he is aware of it or otherwise.
If we are guided by understanding, we harmon-
ize with Nature's laws. If we are obeying the
laws of God then our life must be health filled
and 'Power filled. But if we choose to deny our
personal obligation of stewardship and person-
al responsibility, then we stand condemned in
the sight of God as a foolish man. "Let no man
deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth
to be wise in this world, let him become a fool,
that he may be wise." (167)
INVESTIGATION NOT IGNORING
-WINS
In the beginning all wise men and great dis-
coverers have been dubbed fools or quacks. But
at the testing hour the· scoffers and self-appoint-
ed critics, amid the jeers of an awakened pub-
lic, tumble from their tottering cynic seats be-
cause of ignorant self-deception and inability to
recp.gnize truth.
{The chief impediment that prevents all men
from living in the possession of health is their
early training

him and condemn him to a; life of suffering and
limitation. Length. of days is the only possible
+-79-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
way we can hope to esca·pe the bondage of ear-
ly training. It takes years of living to give us en-
lightenment, and frequently with the passing of
many years we awaken to the fact we have been
living on the limited lower strata of life and
that we were born to live on its towering
heights.
LIFE IS AS THE DEPTH OF
.OUR MIND
To live wisely means a life of high power.
The key to such a worthy existence lies in the
mind. By the mind we are freed or enslaved. If
the weeds of error fill our mental garden, we
can see but weeds and thistles. If our mental
world is filled with the flowers of life-under-
standing our life is decreed to be sane, health
filled and beautiful. If all is not well, if sickness
grips us let us cast out this disturbing mental
weed of error and ignorance and plant instead
the seeds of true wisdom. God offers health and
strength to all men without money and without
price. Simply let us turn to God and seek to live
as he would have us to live and no longer will
we be a prey to suffering or physical torment.
"Therefore will I save my flock and they shall
no more be a prey." (168) No matter how un-
clean we may be, irrespective of the depths to
which we have sunk there is still a chance and
opportunity and ·certainty of healing in the
boundless, limitless beneficence of nature and
transcendent power of God. What man will sol-
+-80-+
HEALTH IS IN YOU
emnly decree as being utterly impossible God
will smilingly demonstrate as being easily pos-
sible. Therefore, let us not lose our courage, let
us get into harmony and believe and give God
the joy and opportunity of opening our blinded
eyes and disclose to us the mighty, little known
remedial possibilities of existence;
OPEN YOUR EYES TO TRUTH
It seems strange how men oppose anew idea
or a new truth. Hands and voices are lifted by
the unthinking or the selfish against the intro-
duction of a new truth. Those who are close
minded fight the introduction of any new pro-
ject even if it is of the most vital benefit to them.
Men seem to glory to wear the chains of suffer- .
ing because they refuse to believe the truth that
disease is a personal sin, a self-built penalty _.
formed from the ·pursuit of ignorant ways and
habits. Physical suffering is indeed self-degrad- .
ation. If wrong habits of living are not mended
healing cannot take place. The sick man may
well cry unto the Lord for illumination so that
he may discover how he is sinning against him~
self and be shown the way to be relieved of his
distress. '"He sent his word and hea.led them and
delivered the·m out of their distresses." .(169)
DARE TO LIVE IN HEALTH
If we are lacking in health wisdom, there
~ is a way provided to get it - the way of Truth.
Truth does not force itself upon unwilling li'\7E;S.
.-81,...
HEALTH IS IN YOU
The spirit of desire and receptivity must first be
established before the Truth can wing its way
to quicken and heal us. Desire to be well and
willingness to refrain from old and faulty meth-
ods of living are the two mightiest steps we ca:q
take toward a life of good health. The great-
est stumbling ·block against winning health is
lack of faith; somehow we cannot bring our-
selves to believe that disease and good health
are both inner products, a personal self-created
loss or gain. Labored arguments should not be
neeessary to prove that men suffer from them-
selves. We are blinded by an endless list of mys-
teriously named diseases. We are frightened by
the constant advertising of contagion, plague~
bacteria and germs. We are confused by pon-
derous dissertations on intricate theories re-
garding molecules, tissues, nerve cells and dis-
eases. In the midst of all this weighty, scientific
jargon we simply grow bewildered and do not
· know where to place our trust. Our senses de-
ceive us and our inclination is not de'pendable.
We should trust to our reason alone and reason
will whisper to us get back to the study of na-
ture and of God and there you will find rest and
redemption from suffering. "Heal me 0 Lord,
and I· ahall be healed; save me and I shall be
aaved: • • • for thou art my praise." (170) · .

all bodily disorders. We are strangers to our-
selves. Men are versed in science, art, books,
music, creeds, laws and money but remain on
the outer porch of the temple of life. Every-
where we turn disorder meets us. Men are rush-
ing to and fro seeking something they can never
find of themselves. Whoever is not receptive to
the influence of Truth is his own betrayer and
life wrecker. The sources of power to heal us
are within our reach yet the vast majority of
people live to suffer. The light concerning
health is ever waiting for us to switch on but
millions live and die in the darkness of error.
Health food for the whole world is ever placed
before those' who hunger.for freedom from suf-
fering. But blinded to Truth the earth's millions
go down to their graves hungry and thirsty for
life's most bountiful gift- good health.
TO BE MORE WE MUST KNOW

fruit, health, joy, peace, youth, beauty, supply,
but we cannot comprehend good from evil and

are their own saviours or their own oppressors? ~·

your life. Even the greatest transgressor is nev-
er deserted or abandoned; all men can find
health if they do their share toward the rebuild-
ing of a new life. "Lo I am with you always"
(172) is an ever living, everlasting promise for
each son and daughter of the earth.
YOU ARE YOUR OWN LIFE
BUILDER
Life is sweet when we know how to live. Re-
solve to gain that wisdom now, today. God is
the designer, but living man is his own sculptor.
he tools for life-fashioning are committed to
~an's hands. Through proper food, conscious
oreathing, cleanliness, rest, exercise, peace and
prayer we can alone build a structure that will
ultimately be known as a Life of Perfection, a
Temple Beautiful. Begin work on this Divine
Model immediately. Strive in your studio of life
to construct this majestic edifice and ever know
as you work and dream and fashion that you are
not working alone, that God is a co-worker with
· you and soon health, joy and abundance will
become your reward. "For the Lord thy God
bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks
of water, of fountains and depths that spring
out of valleys·and billa." (173)
