have 70 years of illegal corrupt Beyond
black projects and you have you know
generations of people
who have been in government some you
know for 30 40 years who have no idea
what&#39;s been going on
beneath the surface
I mean to the point that
some of these folks who are at that
level of oversight
and oversight of the intelligence
community and the black budget of the
United States they didn&#39;t know that
there were dumbs deep underground
military bases they didn&#39;t know there
were connectors between say Edwards Air
Force Base and that facility and the
Nellis range so-called area 51. I had to
dredge up the actual blueprints of the
machine that built them and told them
about which corporations like Bechtel
Corporation and others that ran and
built those with a Beyond black budget
authorization
so all of this is gets to be very
complicated including the money
so you know one of the first questions
was how is this being funded I said well
several mechanisms one
they&#39;ll stay say the B2 stealth bomber
costs two billion dollars a copy
actually probably costs more like 100
million
150 million the rest is diverted into a
black project that they don&#39;t know about
and have not approved now that is in
fact investment of U.S federal taxpayer
dollars
the other issue is
corporations that have gotten spin-offs
of these technologies that have been
studied
