ANTE-PRE DICTUM.
TO THE PUBLIC.
Bnoa• entering upon my subject, I must make a few remarks, which, though
relating exclusively to myself, ought not to be omiUed, lest I should risk the dis-
pleasure of the faatidioua reader, who did not attend my verbal illuslrationa, in
the cour~e of lrie perusal of the preaent work.
In the first place, ~e argumentative parts of the following lectures having been
delivered •zeBmporaneously, wi&bow even any previous mental preparation; sec-
oadly, the lecturea having been since written, without my alteration or omission,
f1'QJD the •tmograpltic rwtu faithfully taken at the time of the delivery before my
nrious elaasee in New York and Philadelphia ; and this labor having, besides,
been accomplished under the pressure of innumerable engagements, and the dis-
advantage of many very unpleasant interruptions-it therefore unavoidably follows
that the _pre~ent work can have no pretensions to absolute perfection, ·or to that
•
polished elegance which ough& generally to characterize a literary production
cautiously matured and thoughtfully digested-although the reader will probably
find in the perueal certain portions not altogether unworthy of his notice.
If, then, in the subsequent pages, eome obscurity should be perceived, or a
diheness in certain trains of thought, or even a few transp!'rent Gallicisms, ilie
following statement, which haa also been made in the preface to my Phreno·
MM11U1Iechtaic Dictionary, will, I hope, be k!ndly bome in mind, viz. : that the
author, no longer than four year• ago; was a total sLranger to the English Ian-
page-a langnage,,to the methodical sttdy of which, uncontrollable circum·
, stances haTe hitherto prevented him from devoting a single moment ..of his
perpetually crowded time.
Were I writing in one of thoee laDgnages in which composition is more fa-
miliar to me, by longer practice and early grammatical study, I should haTe
proceeded without apology-more particularly since the present work is not to
be issued with the pretensions of a literary production ; but the disadvantages
onder which I bad to labor being in some instances more than obvious to the
critic, I thought it would be imprudent to commence without soliciting, once for
aH, the indulgence of a judiciou public.

A FEW WORDS
TO THE FRIIlN])LY AND INTELLIGENT li4EMBEJU•
OF JlY NBW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA OLASS£8.
LADIJ:I AND GENTLEMEN :-
AT the particular request of the majority of myfive tho~Uand pupils in the two sister
cities, I have acceded with pleasure to the publication of my lectures 111 they were de-
linred to my various classes, without alluation. or omiasion ; and also that any one who
may have been "absent during the delivery of certain lectures," or who may have
" Cailed to apprehe!ld the precise meaning of certain. passages, from an exuberance of
illutrarion," or some other cause, may thus have an opportunity of studying ill a more
permanent form the oral lessons which they received with avowed "gratification ;" and
that in future days, when our natural faculties shall have been obliterated by the un-
merciful stamp of time-when old age and weakness shall cast their dark shadows
upon ~~our intellect-we may find in these pages what shall refresh our memory, and
recall more distinctly the " many mirthful and delightful hours we spent so joyously
together," during the vernal evenings of the long-departed 1844.
Such are the Battering words which have in many instances been addressed to me
by kind and IIIIDguine members of my classes, and to which I now respond so gladly
by the publication of this work, cooacious though I am that in many respects it is an
iaeomplete and feeble production.
But whatever may be the merits or demerits of the following pages, their fidelity
will certainly not be questioned. Nothing has been altered or omitted. The mani-
festations ofyourown opinions, impressions, and feelings, have been faithfully recorded
ill each particular circumstance. Even the few signs of disapprobation shown by some
excessively sensitive members during the explanation of the aalanic formula, will be
found recorded in their proper place-so thoroughly have I concurred ill your desire
to make these collected memoranda a photographic fac-simile of" those many mirthful
and delightful hours we spent so joyously together."

PROLEGOMENA.
DIIFINITIO!f.
I. OF all the intellectual faculties ofman, there is none the cultivation ofwhich ill
more important than that of memory; and by a most happy coincidence there .ia
also none more susceptible ofbeing cultivated and improved1-which we ehall have
occasion to demonstrate hereafter.
In their strong conviction of the extreme 1mportance of this faculty of the mind,
several of the illustrious authors who have treated of memory and its metaphysical
relations, have endeavored to give, each according to the best ofhis abilities, a defi-
nition ofit, which would bear on its face the stamp of that strong conviction. Cicero,
Quintilian, Locke, Bacon, Montaigne, and others, are amnng th0116 who have endeav.
ored thus to define memory. But, however great may have been their respective
abiliticH in the art ofdefining, they hav~ all failed to mark this feature with sufficient
distinctness. Having, then, no authority sufficiently satisfactory to quote, 1 shall
o.ttempt to define memory as: The treasure of the sou~ or the repository of intd-
lectual wealth; the library ofthe mind, in which the records of the past unfold them-
aelves before us at our pleasure; and the supreme power of the human intellect, or,·
as a monarchist would say, the sceptre of the sciences, literature and the arts.
Memory ia, indeed, to the learned, the belles-lettre11 scholar, and the artist,
what the lever asked by Archimedes would have been in his powerful hands; for
in this age it is the power of Genius that raises, moves and governs the world; and
although we have often seen men endowed with a wonderful strength of memory
who have Jived without giving proofs of any remarkable geniua, and paased away
"like the shadows of the clouds," from the surface of the earth, yet, perhaJlll a liD-
gle in.tanee cannot be cited by which itcould beshown, tba1 the ar-tMQI.Uilll,1VU

dowed with merely the common power ofmemory. This statement wt11 be corrobo-
rated by a few remarkable instances which I shall mention hereafter. Finally, we
may say, in a philosophical paint of view, that the faculty of memory is the maio
pillar of social existence among the good, rather than the fear of the law, for it is by
the recollection ofour faulta that we try to remove them and become better ; it is by
the recollection of the great examples of human crimes and virtues that we learn to
hate crime, to cherish and practice virtue ; in short, it is the memory of good that
teaches us to avoid evil. Memory, then, is unquestionably one of the fnost valuable
attributes with which the Divinity bas endowed man ; and we cannot too fervently
invoke the Deity to gift us with the strongest degree of that sublime faculty; nor
could we praise him enough when he has granted our wishes.
Yes, happy is he, who, in addition to a cultivated understanding, posseBBe& an
extensive power of retention and recollection.• He has always within himself a
source ofentertainment to which no other treasure is to be compared, at least in the
eye of the sage. He can either be useful in society, or employed in retirement. 11
the pursuit of knowledge and truth i.B the favorite theme of his mind and Etudies1
always contented with his fate, he can, more deliberately than any other mortal, free
himself in solitude from the sad dreams of ambition, the fu.scioations ofYaia •lory,
the turmoils of social troubles, and the c:old injuatice ond disdains of the world.
ADVANTAGES OP A GOOD MlilliiQJlY,
II. What greater pleasure can there be, io fact, for the man who has had the
happiness of treasuring in hia mind all the knowledge congenial to hie taste, or to
the fancies of hie intellect, than that of calling on this invaluable treasure, with the
certainty of always bringing forth, at his command, aroy of the facts that he has
classified within the boundaries of a powerful memory 1 The financier worth mil-
lions, who can draw gold at will from his iron safes and vaults, does he, or can he,
feel a plen.snre comparable to that felt by the stndious lover of learning, who, like
the magician with his wand, can call forth before him, at pleasure, like the phantoms
ofother worlds, and without an effort of the mind, all the interesting facts belongin~
to the domain of History, Sciencea, Literature, and the Fine Arta, that the powen
of a transcendental memory have enabled him to treasure in his intellect1 What
would be, I do not merely say the scholar or the man of science, bnt the mnsidan,
the painter, the sculptor, even the merchallt and the common mechanic, without
memory1 I mean to say without a good memory, for. every man is endowed with
that precious faculty, to a degree more or less remarkable, with the exception of
absolute idiots and lunatics, who are such because memory failed them. What
prompted Seneca to say, with so much truth, that'' a madman or an idiot i11 a man
without memory" 1-stultum seu stolidurn immemorem esse.
· Erasmus, in corroborating this assertion, says that the basis ofall artistic, literary
and scientific celebrity has been "a good memory;" and nothing ~eems easier to be
justified than this assertion of the Dutch sage.

Varro, who had the glory of being called by his eotemporaries "the l'DOit
learned of the Romans," a diploma which has been ratified by po~terity, owed thiaJ
glory, as is remarked by Pliny, to the prodi"ious memory with which wiae Nature
had endowed him. He wrote, says the Roman Linneus,jit1e htmdred volumes upon
different subjects, every one of them stamped with the mark of genius and the per-
fection of the Man of Letters. It will be easy to conceive that in order to avoid.
repetition in his own writings, to remember his sources of information, and to have
perfectly at command the essence and the details of such an amount of scientific,
literary, artistical and other information, as he had treasured in hil mind, he muat
have had a truly wonderful power of universal memory.* The aame remarks are
applicable to Didymus, the celebrated grammarian ofAlexandria. Macrobius calla
him the greatest philologist of his own or any other time, and says that he poueaed,
perfectly well classified in his mind, all the rules that not only he, but all the gram-
marians and classics who had preceded him, had laid down in their Syntaxes or
writings. According to Athenams, he published 3500 volumes, or treatises,t on
philological, scientific, and literary subjects. This prodigiou• amount of labour
caused him to be surnamed by the learned of his time xa.J.xirt:E(lot;, i. e. "the mao
with brazen entrails," from his indefatigable industry. What must not have been
the universality and colossality of the memory of such n n:an1 For let us remark
that the only power which enables a literary mao to treat with MJccesa a greater or
less number of questions lies entirely within the variety or universality ofhis knowl-.
edge. Universality of knowledge is the direct result of profound study, attentin
observations and extensive readings,-with the asaistanee, above all, of a memory
adequate to retain, and to yield, when needed, all the facts which may aerve to illw.-
tnlte a question, to adorn, to sustain or to prove il.t
In modern times Voltaire, the Didymus of France, (however erroneous be may
have unfortunately been in his religious opinions,) h1111 given us the moat brilliaat
specimen of that universality of knowledge, which can only be a~uired by a mem-
ory or great retentive powers.
The writings that he acknowledged and which were first collected by hia friend
Beaumarchais in the famous Keln edition of his complete works, embrace the eoor-
mous number of SO octavo volumes of about 500 pages each; and it haa been u-
aerted by several of his biographers that the occasional pamphlets which, in hia

perpemal 'W1Il' with the Catholic Clergy ud the Jesuitl, he '-ued anonymoualy,
dering more than sixty years of his lite, and which he did not dare avow as hie
productliJIDII, would have made at least 50 more volumes of the same size. By the
numeroua writings which remain of this other unwearied" xuhlnleo<l' we see that
he COblllantly fought his adversaries with regular cannonades of historical argu-
meats and quotations, the depth, the number, and the variety of which almost con-
lllaodyseeured him the battle field in the greater number of the numerous political,
t~aeial, 1cienti6e, historical, literary, or artistical questions, the discussion of which
1111 within the ~eope of his indefatigable genius.
Whatan immense variety of historical quotations is to be found in his writinga,
10 full of atticlsm, order, learning, glowing brilliancy and eloquence! What an
lmmen.e variety of reading, and acquired information does he display in the en-
•emble of his productions! With what a prodigious memory mull he have been
endowed, to call fortb, as he 10 often does, one by one, all that innumerable series ot
&Tents and facts, with which he had so profusely adorned, strengthened, and en-
riohed his universal and unfathomable faculty of recollection! Would Voltaire
have been him8elf without his universal powers of memory'l Unquestionably-
DO I What made him the most fecund and most learned writer of his age 1 No-
thing but his good memory. So it has been with alllhe men of Science and Artists
of all time. This assertion of Erasmus could be corroborated by hundreds of indi-
\'ldual examplee. The best Iawyer is, in fact, he who recollects the greatest number
ofeases, or decillions ofcourts, or rules of practice, &c. So it is with the Physician.
"The best is generally he who remembers the greatest number of errors by which
tile uncertainties of his Science have originated the greatest number of funeral-
the recollection of which causes him to modify every day, by new e.:cperiments, the
doctrine. or lfSlems in tho speci.ftc certainties of which he had the greatest confi..
dence the day before." It was by remembering faces of the most noble and digni-
fied expretaione which he had seen, or "read in Homer," that Phidio.s created under
the sparb of hi• immortal chisel, his Olympian Jupiter, and his Minerva of the
Parthenon. It wuby recollecting the graces ofall the Athenian beauties which he
bad sten and studied, that Apellea created his Jl'emu Ana~. It waa by the
18me means that Canova gave life to his three chiselled Gracee. It was by remem-
bering the gorgeous description ofthe Parthenon, of the tomb ofMosauleoa,and of
aU the other wouJers of Architecture described by Vitruviua and others, or exam-
ined by himself, that Michael Angelo was enabled to "locate the PntheoD ofAgrip-
pa on the top of SL Peter'a at Rome.'' Agaio, it......, by recoDecting the sublime beau-
tiel ofPhidiaa, of Apelles and ofthe molt brilliant poets of Rome and Greece, that
tllia Protean genlllllacalptured hie Moses, painted his LaBt Judgment of the Capella
Sixtina, and wrote in the language of Petrarch like Tibullua, Horace, and Catullus.•
The same power ma1le Mozart, Haydn, and Rossini. Finally, it is the faculty of
MEMORY more than any of the other human faculties, that foi'IDI and IIUStains the
illustrious man. It is he only who is endowed with the riehest memory that, in the
science111 in literature, and in the arts, is certain to leave an imperishable name be-
hind him. Memory then is a treasure, the capacity of which we cannot too ear-

ooeval with the creation ofthe world, in the case ofour first father, Adam. This we
have recorded in Geneaia, Chapter ii., veraea 19 and 20, as follows:

and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to aee what he would call

From Adam we come down towards the f~l of Babylon, or the end Gf the
.lrst captivity of Israe~ before we meet with a " memory ofnames," worthy of beia•
placed in parallel with that of the father of mankind, and it is in the pro.-ideotial
liberator of Israel himselfthat we find it.
Pliny says that Cyrus bad a ntemory so prodigious that he knew by heart the
umu of all the officers and soldiers of hie armies ; and we well know that the
armies of' the great Cyrus were not compoeed of insignificant handsful ofmen.
The same author relates that Cyneaa, the ambaasador from King Pyrrhus to the
Roman people, having been introdaced to each member of the Senate on the day
of his arrival, the next morning when he met them in the Senatorial Palace, after
explaining the object of his mission, saluted every Senator by his proper name and
aurname, without committing a single error, to the amazement of the Senate and
the people.
Several authors have related that the Emperor Otho, the successor to Galba, in
a great measure owed his accession to the Empire of the world, to his prodigioue
power ofmemory for retaining name1. He had learned the namea ofaU the soldiers
of his army when be wu their COIDpanion as a simple officer, and be used to eaR
e?ery one by his proper name. T be soldiery, flattered at whattbey thought a mark
of sympathy from Otho, persuaded themselves tblilt if ever elevated to the supreme
power, moll an Emperor couW not forget io the diltribation of his imperial favON

Galba, they aU declared in hill f&l'Or, IUl4 opened to him tbe path of uoiversaleove-
reigoty, by helping him to overthrow his competitor for the throne. But it appears
that the Emperor Otho had not a memory very tenacioua ; for we learn that three
months afterwards, his soldiers perceiving, doubtless, that he was beginning to for-
get them, abandoned him to his fate, when Vitelliua, in his hlrn, attempted to tear
&om his grasp that sceptre, which ninety-five days before be bad himself anatcbed
ftom the hand of Galba.
But, if memory gained a throne for Otho, however short his reign may have
been, this single example would be sufficient to prove that a "good memory " is not
a ~ing to be disdained, and that we ought not to neglect any occasion that may pre-
llellt itselfto strengthen, improve, and enrich this precious intellectual faculty in which
web a great number of people are deficient.
A similar kind ofmemory was also possessed by Mithridates, the famous Parthian
King, and Adrianus, the "locomotive Emperor,,. as he is called by Lampridius. It

MBMORY OJ' ISOL.a.TCD WORDS,
V. The memory of "iiiOiated wortle" has furniabed ns·some specimens no
le~~~rem~le.
In tile first instance, we have the direct testimony of Seneca himself, a maa
whose sincerity has never been questioned, who says that in his youth he could r~
peatas many u 2000 wOl'ds, whether they had any connection with each other or
oot; he say. aho, that upon different oeeasiODS he received from each of his school-
mates, a number of isolated sentences or lines of poetry, and that after be had read
them over OllC8 or twice he repeated as many as two hundred of them without
mistake.
In more modero ti111es, a few remarkable specimens of memory of words can be
giveu. That of a French Jeanit, named Father ¥enestrier, who resided in the c,ity
of Lyons, stands most :promiDeDt amoog them. He waa indeed endowed with a
most remarkable strength of' memory. Christina, Queen of Sweden, passing
through Lyons, when retiriag to Rome, after her memorable abdication, desired to
o'btain a direct proof of the good Father's reputed memory, to which he acceded
with no little s&U.faecion. The Queen handed him, written on a •beet ofpaper, 30()-
words, the mo8t uncouth and extravagant that abe could imagine, and he repeated
them all, says his biographer, first in the ordel' they had been written down, nnd
soon after in any or.der that the Queen and her suite chose to ask of him. It is only
to be regretted that the biographerforgot to 1tate how long it took the Father Jesuit
to accomplish thia herculean taak.
The same thing baa been related of the celebrated Pieus de Mirandola, whof!e
universality of aequirements so wonderfUlly utonished his cotemporaries. It is said
in 10me of his biographies, that he could repeat a column of 2000 words given, or
even read to him, after one hearing or a single perusal.
IIII:MOBT OF LANGUAGES.
VJ. Hitherto, as we have seen, the special appllcationa oftbe kinds of memo1'f
just mentioned, offer nothing of particular or even general interest. But when we
come to the m.emory of languagtl, we find a number ofspecimens of a character
truly extraordinary, and presenting a certain degree of interest. The first recorded

ory ofname~~. According to art tria biographers, from Appian • down to Micbaad,t
:Mithridate&, who numbered in his dominions 22 dift'erent nati011a, was at,le tct
addrese each of them in ita own language. Aeeonllng to Plutarch aud othenJ,
Cleopatra eould speak with fluency and correctnee:s all the dialect. ofthe East,
amounting in her time to same thirty or forty; and the saMtl' author remarlts that
Themistoolea' memory of languages was equally good-that a few months anet"
Ilia voluntary exile to Penria he learned to write and speak the ne.tin tongue witk
as much fae~lity and ~nesa as any native Persian scholar. '
We find again in Pfutareh that Cram:JB, while governor ofAala, which wu
'but for a very llhort pl!rioo, learned the five great dialects with saoll a degree of081'-
rectness that he was enabled to give his CourtJudgments in each ofthem, witbwter-
rors. Plutarch also relates that Cato the Censor, when 84 yean of ap had stiR
eueh a perfect strength ofmemory, that after he had married the young daughter of
the public Scribe, (who 6oon became the mother ofa cllild al\erwards the grand-mo-
ther ofCato Utitend1,) to charm the leisure honrs ofhis honey-moon beundertook to
learn the Greek language, and succeeded so well that at the end ofa few montU
be was able to write 1ome very remarkable treatises in that then fashi011able
1anguage.
Every one remembers that Clet!ar used to dictate to five or six .eeretariea at the
eme time, and in as many different languages. Yet the chronicles of the a.ton-
ishing things and doings ofthe last century, so prolific in marvels ofall descriptions,
speak of an officer of Louis XV. of France, bytbe name of Mareet, who would
have been more than a match for Cresar in the same exploit& It is asserted t ill
two or three respectable literary journals of that epoch, that this Mareet used to
dictate at the some time, as an amusement, to TEI!f different penon1 in as many
different languages, and upon the most seriOtlB questions, witllout deviations from
grammatical rules, orthography or pronunciation. But what is still more surprilling,
he united with this an equally wonderful power of memory or ftamu, beaides an
astonishing power of memory for calculation. We find in the same records that
be would amuse himselfand his friends, by making a whole battalion of soldiers,
&trangers to him, defile in his presence, each soldier pronouncing his own name
aa he passed, and that when they rep1111sed he would call every one by his proper
name. He would also sometimes, by wny ofsport, solve, abPolutely from memorf,
any arithmetical question given to him, were it composed of as many as thirty
figure..
I could not conclude, to my satisfuction, these aketches of wonderful specimene
of memory for language!', without mentioning the following extraordinary ea!le
which I quote from the New York Tribune of Nov. 1. 1843, in a letter written from
Italy, from the &,rraphic pen of the Rev.]. T. Headly-one of the most elegant,
elasaieal, and accomplished correspondents of this standard paper, of refined taste,
and dignified polemics.
The hero of this incredible memory of languages, is the celebrated Cardinal

denomination~~. To tlleae objects, saya bla biographer, be applied the whole rorce
ofhie mind, and upon tbeae bfa atte~on wae ao constantly rivetted, that he floe.
quently took no notice ofexternal objects, and when he did it was only with respeet
to their numbers.
Ifany sp'lce of time was mentioned before him, he would aoon after 81\Y it was
eo many minutes, and if any distance, he would mention the number of furlongs,
fathoms, yards, feet, inches, barleycoms, and even hair'B breadtlu in it, without any
queetion being aaked, or calculation being expected by the company. When he
once understood a question, he began to work it with amazing filcility, after his
own method, without the Ulle of pen, pencil, or chalk, or even understanding the
common rules ofarithmetic taught in the ecbools, for, although WilHam Buxton,
his father, was the school-master of hie parish, yet Jedediah's education had been so
completely nt>gleeted that he had never been taught to read or write, and could not
e¥en sign his name.
The quotation ofa few specimen• ofhis ocealional experiments may not appear
altogether uninteresting to our readers.
On being required to multiply 456 by 378, be gave the product by metttal aritft-
metic1 as soon as a peraon in the company had completed it in the common wny.-
Being reque£ted lo work it audibly, that his method might be known, he multiplied
456 first by 5, which produced 2280, this he again multiplied by 20, and found the
product 45,600, which was the multiplicand multiplied by 100; this product he again
multiplied by 3, which produced 186,800, the sum of the muhiplicand muhiplie4 by
300. lt.t'emained, to multiply 456 by78, which he effected by multiplying 2280 (the
product of the multiplicand multiplied by 5,) by 151 five timl'.a 15 being75; this pro-
duct, being 34.,200, he added to 1361800, which was the multiplicand multiplied by
300, and this produced 171,000, which was 375 times 456. To complete his opera-
tion, therefore, he multiplied 456 by 3, which produced 1368 ; and having added this
number to 171,000, he found the product of 45«1, multiplied by 378, to be 172,368!
.If we take into consideration that by thia astonishing manner of calculation, the
res~lt was obtained in the 1ame 1fN1Ce of time that another person in the company
had taken to give it in the common way, there will be matter enough for us to won-
der at, fbr this experiment shows that the relation of" so many filetors mu~>t have
atruck him at first as by intuition. This shows ua alao, that Jedediah'a method of
arithmetic was entirely his own, and that be was so litde acquuint.ed with the com-
mon roles, as to muhiply 456 first by 51 and the product by 20, to fiad what sum it
would produce multiplied by 100; whereas, had he added two cyphera to the fipes,
he would have obtained the same product at onoe. The history of this exll"llOrdi-
nary man is crowded with numerous inftancea of the mo.t intricate arithmetic prob-
lems, aolved with the same degree of accuracy, and promptitude. He would stride ·
over a pieoe of land or a field, and t.ell the r.onteots of it with as much exactnetlll aa
if he had meB.IItlred it by the chain. In thie maDDer he measured tbe whole lord-
•hip of Elmeton, of some thoumnda of acree, Md brought the conteota to theowner
not only in acres, roods, and perchea, but even in &quare inches. After thi1 he redac·
ed them for hie own am\Hiement into square hair-breadths, computing about at8 to
each side of the inch ; which produced such an incompreheoaible MJmher as ap-
peared altogetlter astonishing. Hie memory was so powerful, as regar4s figere.,

.operation again, where he lefi it, the ne1t morning, or a week, ·a month, or se-veral
months afterward, and proceed regularly till it was ec~mpleted. Hi. memory might
have probably been equally retentive with respect to other objects, ifhe had auend-
ed to other objects with 1lqual diligence; but his perpetual application to figuree
prevented the smallest acquisition of any other knowledge. He was sometime~~
asked on his return from church, whether he remembered the text or any part of the
sermon, and it never appeared that he brought away one single sentence; his mind,
upon a close examination, was always found to have been busied, even during divine
service, in hie favorite operation, either dividing eorue portion of time, or some
spaoe, into the emallest known parte, or resolving aome question that had been given
him as a task for his nbiUties-or computing the numberof 10ords the preacher had
uttered in the sermon !
The only objects ofJedediah's curiosity, next to figures, were the king and royal
family; and his desire to see them wae so strong, that, in the beginning of 1754 he
walked up to Lontlon for that purpose. He was aoon after introduced to the Royal
Society, who, in order to teat his abilities, asked him a number of sharp question&
in arithmetic; and he gave them suoh satisfaotion, that, in their admiration and a~
tonishment they dismiBBed him with a handsome gratuity. During his residence in
London, he was taken to see the tragedy of King Richard IlL performed at Df?ry
Lane Theatre; and it was expected that the novelty of every thing in this place,
together with the splendor of the surrounding objects would have fixed him in aa-
tonishment, or that hie passion would in some degree have been roused by the ac-
tion of the performer, even if he did not fully comprehend the dialogue. But his
thoughts were otherwise employed. During the dances, his attention was engaged
"in reckoning the number ofsteps made by each dancer;" after a fine piece of music,
he declared that" the innumerable sounds produced by the various instruments had
perplexed him beyond measure ;"-but "he counted every word uttered by the cele-
brated Garrick and the other actors in the whole course of the entertainment," and
affirmed that in this he bad perfectly sueceeded.
Born to no fortune, this extraordinary man lived in laborious poverty. His life
was uniform and obscure. Time with respect to him changed nothing but his age-
After his visit to London, he went back to his native town, where he died in 1778,
beiDg about 70 years of age, " and with the opinion he had entertained all his life,"
mys his biographer, "that a slice ofrusty bacon afforded the most delicious repast."
Aller such aspecimenofcalculating memory, it might be thought that nature could
not produce any thing ofthe kind more wonderful; yet, after Buxton we find some-
thing more surprising still, particularly if we take the age ofthe subjectinto conside-
ration. I allude to the young child named Zerah Colburn, who, at the age of8 yearr,
created such a feeling of astonishment in this country and in England, about the
beginning of this century. He was born at Cabot, in the State of Vermont, in 1804.
He was scarcely 6 years old when he began to show the wonderful powers be soon
after displayed of performing all sorts of arithmetical operations. His father, who
bad not given hilU any other inlltruetion than such as is to be obtained at small
country schoola, was surprised to hear him repeating one day the products ofseveral
numbers. The news of this infani prodigy soon circulated through the neigbbor-
hpod, aDd the fa&ller was eQcOllraged to UDdertake the tour ofthe United States, awl

tnally to visit England, where he arrived in 1812. The young Zerah could deter-
mine with the greatest facility and despatch the exact number ofminuteaor second•
:in any given period of time. He c:ould tell the exact prod~t ariBing from t~e mul-
tiplication of any given number, consisting of two, three, or rour figures; or when
auy number consistingof silt or seven places of figurea was proposed to him, be
could determine, with expedition and ease, all the far.ton of which it was com-
poeed. This singular faculty conseqaently extended ta the extraction of the
aquare and cube roots of the number proposed; and likewise to the means of de-
termining whether It be a prime number.
At a meeting assembled for the purpose ofexamining his wonderrut abilities,
thill child raiae~ the number 8 progressively to the sixteenth power, and in naming
the last result, 881,474,976,710,656, he was right in every figure. He was asked
the square root of 106929, and "before the number could be written down," he an-
twered 327. He was then required to name the cube root of26~336,I25,and, with
equal facility and promptnen, replied 6t5. One of the party requested him to
Dame the factOI'II which produced the number 247,483, whieh be immediat~ly did
J.y mentioning the two numbers, 941 and 263; which indeed are the only two
11ombers that will produce it.
Another proposed 171,395, and he named the following factors as the only ones
that would produce it, viz., 5X34279, 7X24485, 59X2905, 83X2063, 35X48971 295X
581, and 413X415!
He was then asked to give the factors of 36083, but he immediately replied
that it had none, which, in fact is the case, as 36083 is a prime number.
One genUeman asked him how many minutes there were in 48 yeara ; and
before the question could be written down he replied, 25,228,800, and instantly
added that the number of seconds in the same period is 1,513,728,000. In one
case he was asked to tell the square of 4395; he at firat hesitated, but when he ap-
plied himselfto it, he said it was 19,316,020. ·On being questioned as to the cause
ofhis hesitation, he replied that he did not like to multiply four figure• by four fig·
urea; "but," said he, "I found out another way: I multiplied 293 by 293, and
then multiplied this product by the number 15, which produced the same result."
On another ooeasion the Duke of Gloucester asked him the product of21,734, mul-
tiplied by 543; he in8lantly replied 11,801,562; but upon some remarks being
made, the child said he had, in his own mind, multiplied 65202 by 181. Although,
in the first instance, it is evident that 4395 is equal to 293X15, and consequently
that(4395)1=(293)'X(15)1 ; and that in the second case 5t3 is equal to 181X3,
and, consequently, that 21734X(181X3)=(21734X3)X181; yet it is wonderfully
remarkable that such a combination should have been perceived by the child at a
glance, when the beat mathematical head would require some serious attention to
attain the same conclusion. There can be no doubt but that marvellous child,
like Jedediah Buxton, possessedan intuitive knowledge ofsome important properties
ofnumbers which died with him. With the beliefthat, ifhis mind received a proper
degree ofcultivation, he would be able to divulge the mode by which he operated,
and to point out some new principles of calculation, a number of gentlemen took ·
Zerah under their patronage, and formed themselves into a committee for the pur-
pose of eaperiutending his education, but it was perceived that, contrary to \he moct

llliliw-ceblation which made his fume.
About the I!IBI1le tiMe, ~mGtherwonderful 'boy,11f (be 1!8tne utonisbing capacity
fer mental calculations, made his appearance in London. His name was George
Bidder, surnamed the "calculating prodigy." On tlte 6th of April, 1815, be waa
iatrodueed ts the Court of St. James, by the Bishop ..,f &1i8bury, before which be
exblWted hie1111rprieing talen\8. "Ofthese talents," says his biographer, 'we can..
not apeak in terms IIUIIieiently strong to exprees our wonder and admiration. It
would be vain to attempt to aceot~nt lOr them, 10pon any of the known pril\ciples by
which our usual calcu{ations are performed ; but we can testify tG the rapidity and
preoision ofhis answers in an innumerable number Gf questions of considerable
1DCricacy. A very few eu.mples will suffice to show that he was not inferior tct
Zerah Colburn or Jededlab Buxton. One of the officers of the queen asked hi111

A Tery fuw years ago, the Paris P~"e~~s resounded loudly with a series of experi-
ments of the same nature, an~! -of the same wonderful character, perfOrmed before
the Royal Academy of 'Sciences by a young Corsican boy, of about eight years of
age, named Giacomo Mangiamelli. Without ha'Ving any previous knowledge of
the common rules of arithmetie, or -even <>f the use and power of the Arabic nu-
merals, and without having bestowed any particular attentien on the subject, he
was found to possess, as if by intuition, the singular faculty of solving a great
variety of very difllcult arithmetical questions, by the mere operation of the mind,
and without the usual assistance of any v1sible symbol or contrivaDt:e. The Royal
Academy did for him what had been done in England for the young Zerah
Colburn; the members took him under their eare, voted a fund to secure his educa-
tion, with a new to make an immortel of him at some future day. But here again,
the result has prove\! to be the tRlnrc n In the case or young Zerah. Although
they have piace4 the young Mangiamelli in one of the most renowned colleges or
Paris, where thll grt'llttl!JI. '-"'U" hs Uik"n oC Lhc intprovcnmnt or 11iB mind, yet, as the

in all the Paris papers a few months ago, that his mental calculating faculties, act
wonderful a few years ago, diminisb every day at a rate which threatens a eompiete
extinction of them in a short time.
Without commenting upon tbe singularity of these facts, upon the strange sim-
ultaneousness of the appearance of these yollng wonders, and upon the nature o{
1heir inoemprehenslble and truly prodigious faculty for mental. calculations, I cannot
take leave ofthem, however, without noticing that a great difference exists between
the prodigious faculty with which they were endowed and that which must be un-
deratood by" faculty of memory." We perceive that the strength of their memoriee
was momentary. They OIMild retain Mparately iD their miDd the qdotients of any

with a mo.t astoniahing preciaion ; but it is not said whether they could retain cbe
result of their various caleulatiooa any length of time. which .i8 DOt at all probable,
else their enthusiastic biographers would have stated it with eruphaais. They
had not then what is properly denominated "memory of figures;" although Dr.
'Wallis and 1edediahBuxton, besides their" memoryfor calculation" appear to have
been gifted with the for111er to a certain degree. But the mostremarkable apecimea
of memory for recollecting fipru, and performing at the eame time mentW ealcu-
lations, not by intuitive power, ns in the ease of Buxton, Zerah Colburn, George
Bidder, and Giacomo Mangiamelli, but by the direct application of the powera of
reasoning, which presents an incomparable degree of difficulty and superiority or
mind, the most remarkable specimen, I say, of this kind of memory, ever recorded
in the annals of history, is that given to the scientific world in the last century, by
the celebrated Swiss mathematician, Leonard Euler. The mere examination of
his mathematical work1!1 containing more than 600 different treatises on the most ab- ·
atraot and transcendental questions of all the various branches of the science of
Mathematics, would suffice to convince any one that the relationa and properties of
numbers must have been as intimately familiar to his mind as the molecule~ of a
chemical combination are sympathetic to each other.
As regards his '·memory for figures, and for mental calculations," the only object
which we ·have now in view, I shall quote Condoreet's own worde from hia prize
Eulogy of that great man.•
There exists, he says, in mathematical analysis a great nwnber of formula. of
usual and almost daily application; Mr. Euler ktlew them all by heart, and had
tbem constantly present to his mind. He was so familiar with them that he used to
repeat them in scientific conversations or diacussiona without committing a single
mistake. When Mr. D'Alembert, the celebrated geometrician, visited him at Berlin,
he was astounded at the prodigious power of memory he exhibited ;-a power which
proved Euler's mind to be gifted, as it was in fact, with immense vigor, absolute
precision and deep impressibility. Finally, his extreme facility for calculating from
memory, and remembering figures, was carried to such a degree that it would be
scarcely creditable if the number, the nature, and the history of his scientific worka
had not accustomed our minds to look at 11uch prodigies without astonishment.
With the view to exercise hia children upon the extraction of roots, he had fonned
for hia own use a table of the aix first powera of all the numbers, from one to one ·
hundred, and had also elassifieli this gigantic legion of figares in hiil memory, from
the first to the last, and with the ntmOAt ,).,gree of ~>.xaclneu_
Two of his ~pile having once calculated, down to the 17th term, 11. converging
series, very complicated in their results, although sustained by a tcrilten ealculatio~
happened to differ one unit at the fiftieth figure. They both called upon their great
master to settle the question. Euler, who at that time, like Homer, Galileo and
Milton, had lost his sight ia the pursuit of wi11dom, undertook the revision of the
whole calculation from the mere assistance of his memory, and his decision upoa
the controverted question wna found to be in perfect accordance with truth.
Now let us quit the mathematical memories, for those two branches of that hapPJ
fkeulty which are by far the moat interesting in their applications, if not more im·
portant; I mean the memory of prose and poetry. -

11-0RY OF PR08Jl,
VII. The aneieDta have banded down te Ul a few apecimena, truly wonderful, of
ttHe inappreeiahle kind of mewry, although not more 110 than aome modern speci-
mens, of wbieh we ahall speak hereat\er.
The fir.t of them is mentioned by Selleca, when speaking of his intimate frien~
Portiua Latro, whoee memory wu eo good, he says, u to permit him to retain all
the speeehes he had heard declaimed by the public ora&Drs of Rome, without ever
tnding his memory deficient even in a single word. We might characterize tlilil
extraordinary fanulty of Seoeea's friend by tbe name of "Memory of Speeches,"
which would have made of him, in our days, a most capital reporter.
Next to Latro, comes the great orator Horteoeius, the Henry Clay of ancient
Rome, one who would have len an unparalleled name in the history of RomGn elo-
quence, if Cicero, the Daniel W ebeter of his time, hacl not been born to share with
bim the applause and reapect of hie contemporaries, and the admiration of.poateri-
.,.. His memory WBS 110 powerful and eo perfectly to be depended upon, that he
uaed to eompoee his orations almost coostantly from memory, without writing a siD-
cfe word 1 and afler he bad thus compoeed a discourse and committed it, he could
always deliver it word for word, without change or mistake. Nothing that he had
ooce .-.ommiUed to his faithful memorywould fail him when caUed forth. Whatever
he had wriueo or publilrhed; whatever had been said by hls opponent in the plead-
ing of any cue; every thing ws.a constantly present to his memory. This faculty,
•ya Pliny, was carried in him to the pinnacle ofprodijly. It is reported that in con-
~~equence ofa wager with a friend of his, he pasaed a whole day at a public auction
room, and that after the sale was over, he rendered an exact account ofall that bad
been sold, of the prica of each thing, of tbe name of each bidder, every one in the
proper order as had been marked upon the book,-all this without mistaking in one
.ntgle inetanee, as was corroborated by the auctioneer, who followed him upon hia
book as he was repeating the articlea.
Aner Hortensius, comes one of the happiest among those who ever sat upon the
-im~rial tbrone of Ronr.e, the Emperor Adrian. Whether hie memory, as in the
eaae of Otho, had any iduence, direct or indirect, upon his accession to the supreme
rank, is not mentioned b)t,he authors ofhis age. But that which all his original biog-
raphers have unanimouslt agreed upon is, that be was endowed by nature with a
power of memory reaHy prodigious and almost universal.
It is ueerted that, like Cyrus, he knew the names of all the soldiers of his vari-
OWI armies. Like Seneca, he could repeat any number of words either written or
-,oken to him ; but, what is still more surprising, all his biographers have reported,
that it was quite a matter of amusement to him to repeat, word for word, from the
beginning to the end, or from any part pointed out to him, any book that he had
read but onr.e with the intention ol' remembering it. ·
From Adrian we come down to the eleventh century before we meet with aDJ
remarkable speeimen of the same kind of memory. Justus Lipsus, a Flemish wri-
ter of great celebrity in his time, is the first oue we find recorded in modem annals.
Victorio Rossi relates that he (Lipsua) knew by heart the whole of Tacitus. So

to have his arms tied behind hi111, and hil body fastened to a post, while one
would queatioo him from any part of a Tacitus, in Latin, spread before every one
Gf the party. A person stood by his aide with a poniard in his hand; and the agree-
ment was, that this man ahould atab him to the .heart if he committed t100 rnistnkee
in any paBSage asked of him ; or that the party should i.olict llpOtl him any corpoo
real punishment they might ehoose, if he made a minake in one lingle instance.
About the same time, a French poet by tOO name of Nicholas Bourbon was u-
tooithing the Parisian& in reciting with the aame exaotneaa, &bough DM in the 8IUDtt
oold manner, the French Hi.tory of Chaneelier de Thou,• and ibe Eulogiee ol
Paolo Giovio, which were in his estimation what the works ofHomer were to Ales.
ander the Great, and for which he doubtlesa would have gotten a golden case inlaia
with preciooa atooea, had he been the victor of another Darius, and conqueror of
modem Asia.
It is said that Avicenna, the famous Arabian phys-ician, who lived in the eleventh
century, could repeat word for word the whole book of Aristotle'• Metaphysiee; and
that George Vogan de Arrezo knew by heart, line after line, the whole of VlrgiP.
lEneid, which he had learned wMn at eehool.
Klopstock, the celebrated German Epic poet, is said alao to have poseeased in tho
tame manner Hamer's !Iliad, learned when he was at the ~~ehool of Porta.
We find also that Henry de Mesme, a French magistrate of the 17th centnry,
had such a memory that he could repeat Homer from the first line to the last, with-
out omiasion; and that Thomaa Vincent, an English minister of the Gospel, had
learned the whole of the New Teatament and Psalms by heart. He did this, as he
often said, "not knowing but they who took from him his pulpit, might, in time, de-
mand his Bible also."
Yet, however remarkable may appear theee modem specimena of extraordinary
memories, if we· must continne to rely upon the same ecattered records from whence
these facts have been gathered, we shall find that they have all been excelled by
three or four other high priests of Mn.emosyne, whoee natural memoriee have BOt
yet been equalled.
One of these is Joseph Sealiger, the celebrated Italian philologist. It has beee
affirmed by every one of his biographers, that he acquired line by line, in the Greek,
and in the short space of 21 days, both the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer I
The next is the celebrated Blbliopolist and Philoaopher, Magliabacehi, born at
Florence, in the year 1633. His knowledge of books, says his biographer, waa aJ...
most beyond credibility. By means of his extraordinary memory and incessant ap-
plication, he became more conversant with literature, history, and philosophy, thaa
any other man of his time. He could readily direct an author to all the existiq
known works which treated, either directly or indirectly, upon the mb.)8ct on whioll
he was writing. So accurate and fall was his information on that subject, that he
was surnamed by his contemporaries" the Living Library.'' The greatlearning, for
which he was indebted mainly to his prodigious powers of memory, gained for him
the esteem and veneration of the European world, although he was in his private
manner of living ofa most booriala. and superlative eccentricity. Louis XIV. always

After Crebilloa we find another specimen no lese remarkable of natural memo.
ry, in a Belgian nobleman, named Baron Beyta, who wu bom in the year 1762, aD4
who died in the year 183a, at the age of 70. He had. visited, says bia biographer,
every pMtion of Germany and Italy. His learning was so varied and at the same
time so deep, that Napoleon used to call him "an animated library." Mathemaac..
and the ancient classical language• had been more particularly tho favorite •objects
of his usual studiee. His memory ~ so prodigious that, even mwarda Che latter
days of his otd age, he was able to recite all the tragediea of Sophocles md Eu-
ripides. He knew grammatleally four ancient and six modern languages. H"M
memory was-so retentive that he could recite without error the da1eB ofaJI the trea-
ties of peace, and the places where they were eoneluded, &om 1he felll' 1650 dowa
to our days, besides an immense number of other dates connected with general bi.-
tory, literatnrl'1 or science.
But the most earlous and interesting spoeimen of the 1trcmgth ofnatural memo-
ry we meet with, is, iB my opinion, that of an iDdivi4ual wh011e name, it appear.,
}las not been preserved, perhaps on account of 118 juxtaposition with the two brigb&-
est names of the last eeDtury, Fredericlc the Great ud Voltaire, who, like two atan
ofthe fint magnitude, shining in the vicinity ofa smaller one, eaaeed him to disap-
pear by absorbing his light.
During his s6jour at the philosophical ud literary Court of Berlin, V.U.
ueed to charm the leisure hours of the poet kipg in his evening BaM-ftlfon partiea at
his delightful residence of 8Al'&·8oucrs, by reciting the latat of hia poetical pro-
cluctions. Upon eome of these evenings Voltaire talked ~of a fortbcomiJtg
poem, which he boldly 11tyled "the moo beautifW thing that he had everwrittea, •
a subject as Interesting as neto."
The curiosity of Frederick was very much eltCitd by these half confideD.,_, '-.
and aa he could get na IUrther light Oil the aubjeet, be kept silent, r.olved to wait
with patience until the lkly of a more complete revelation ehould come. When
Voltaire had completed his poem, an eveaing party, at whieb wu 18 be gathered tile

At tiUs unexpected declaration Voltaire, thunderstraek, u it were, could only
filld wwd. to oballenge the king to produce immediately, if posaible; a ifacnfttMa·
ble proof of 81JCh an uutel'lllble 888ertian. Frederick gave iflllaftler an ·order to
o.ne of his pagee. A few minmes afterwards a young officer in uniform entered the
room. The king uked him if he had found the loat manuscript of hia poem. He
aDnrered no, but thatfortunately he had learned it by heart before hebrought it to his
Majesty. The king commandedhim to recite the poem, which hedid immediately,
with the moat perfect ease, without making the lllightest de'riatioo from Voltaire's
IDIIOUIICript, to the amazement of Volt.Ure himself, and to the indescrillable aston-
ilbment of the audience.
The chronieler of this interesting an~dote states that Voltaire, feeling both an-
gry and confused at thia inexplicable my•tery, controlled his emotiooa before the
K.ing, aod slowly tearing his manuscript into pieces, threw the fragments into the
fire and wu abou~ to retire, when the King, feeling that the joke had been carried
far enough, stopped tbe .,eat poet by telling him that all this was the mere result
of ao e.t:perimeut he had been making with the young etranger, who had boasted
that his memory was capable of occompliahing the moat herculean taaka. IB order
to prove the strength of this almost 8Upernatural power of memory, he had been
placed behind a curtain, and while Voltaire was reciting a poem, be had clasaified
in hill mind each word, each line, and each page, just in lhe precise order that the
poet had read them ' This scene, of courae, afforded much amusement to all pres·
ant, and to none more than to Voltaire himself. The young atranger at the requeat
of the King, wrote down the poem for ita author. Singularly enough, we find no
other mention of this wonderful man in those days, although such a memory aa
he JIOIIIMliiBCd, should have given hia name a place among· the first of his age and

ON ARTIFICIAL MEMORY
AlfD TSB
THEORY OF NATURAL MEMORY.
ALTnouon artificial memory is the main object I haYe in Tiew, u the tide of tbe
preaent ehapter indicates, yet, in a discussion having for its object ?Mirn>I'J princi-
pally, we could not reaeonably enter upon the queetion, without having a clear
conception, by proper definitions, of the difference existing between natural and
artijicial memory. I apprehend that the reader will most likely be startled at the
novelty, and even strangeneBB of some of the propositions, which will here be pre-
sented. This will be the more probable, inasmuch DB the intention of the present
work will not allow me the possibility of entering into particular illuslrationa of the
meaning intended to be conveyed by some ofthese propositions; which will be done
at length in my work on the" Principles and universal application of the System."
Yet I will try to combine clearness with brevity, and, however singular may appear,
to the metaphysical reader, some of these propositions alluded to, 1 request ofhis
lo~ni~ty to wait for their complete developments, in the work just mentioned,
before paBBing judgment upon their character. Suffice it to say, that I have plaeed
them here as the precursive indications of an entirely ne10 thtory/ of the causes and
formation of memory and recoUection, which, I confidently believe, wil~ at once and
forever, settle.that important metaphysical question, hitherto so full of uncertainties.
At this announcement, I see the skeptical reader smiling ironically while shak-
ing gently his head; and this incredulity I can readily understand.
Indeed, so many theories have been given upon the urigin, nature, C4'l#U1 loco-
fio11, and functiO'M of this important faculty of the mind, by the most eminent phi-
losophers of ancient and modem times, that, af\er 1uch men as Aristotle, Plato,
Locke, Bacon, Descartes, Mallebranche, Condillac, Reid, Hume, Kant, Cousin,
Abercrombie, and others, to promise any thing fielD and interuting on this eubjeet,
may appear to the learned reader presumptuoua. However, I believe that the
perusal ofthe theory referred to, will not, when it appears, prove entirely devoid of
interest to the inquiring mind, but will deserve his attention ifonly u a metaphy.i-
ealaovelty, aud perhaps obtain a ahare ofhis approbation.

WA1'URAL AND U'l'II'I'CtAL .........
NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL MEMORY.
D&FUIITIOM8.
L By AaTIFICIAL MEMORY, we understand, simply, tbe power 1>f recollee1ing
facts and events, by means of condUicmal anociatioM, which must first be ealled for,
in order, by their assistance, to get at the facts associated with them. This defini-
~on will be more fully illustrated hereafter (page 48), when treating of artificial
aemory in particular.
The leading featul'ell of natural memory may 'be classified under four general
head. :-L Recollection. 2. Remembrance. 3. Reminiscence. 4. Conception or
invention, and imaginatioo,-oollatera1 phenomena of memory which are too close-
ly cnnnected with each other to be separated.
II. By NATURAL MEMoav I unduatand the faculty ofretaining the impreuW.
of any event or facts, or series of events and faets, withoot the 888ietance of.yMem-
o.tic auociatUnls, which must be distinguished &om naturiJl ~ a concomi-
tant feature of natural memory, properly BO called. (a)
III. RECOLLECTION is the faculty by which we recall to our mind, at will, the
facts or eveotswhieh we have treasured in our memory.
IV. REMEIIBRARO£, though used OC'Cilfliooally as a syaooym ofrecollection, dif..
fers from the latter in tbifl respect, that the former implies the occurring to the
mind of an idea (b) or notion, •pontaneou6ly, or with an imperceptible mental ex-
ertion, while the other implies more particularly, the act of recollecting ideas or
notions which do not occur to the mind spontaneoualy.
V. REMINISCENCE is that modification of memory by wbieh ideu or ooUODII,
formerly impressed upon the mind, and subsequently forgotten, are accidentally,
or suddenly, reealled to the memory without the exertion of the will.
VI. By CoNCEPTIoM, whieh is one of the leading phenomena of memory, I
understand the power of forming in one's mind, imogu1 or ideas and notions, from
the remembrance of the thing• we already know. (c) Thus, a pe.ioter, a poot, or ,
a musician, conceive. a painting, a poem, or an aria, 06 As procetd6 in the composi-
tion of his work, and aided by imagination, (d) adorns the eubjeet withfancifm
or ima.,ai~tary accessories, or even with real aai!Ociations, to give life to his concep-
tions. Thus invention is the equivalent ofconception ; conctptilm the mediate deri-
vation of remembrance ; and imagination, which is the synonym of inepiration, is a
natural concomitant of conception ·;-whether the composition be purely chimeriea~
fanciful, or imaginative, or conceiDed from the mediate remembraoce of facta or
events.
VII. The imagu of the thing• we remember are produced m«hanicaUy ill
the BttiiJ01'ium, by the combined action of the spirit and the senses upon a particu-
lar set of organs, the ensemble, or combination ofwhich, I call the mntt~~o-;{OCtU, or
locU8 in quem radii memoria collipntw- to form tke il7lfl.flll of facta or eventa
which we remember.
Vlll. Thus the formation or origin of memory being ea&ntia!ly the result of
the reproduction of the imprummB left in the seni!Orium, througll the medilma
of t/u foe •euu, memory then is naturally compoaed of five diflerent madet of
i

o,,,,db,Google j
fn"CtJptiDu, which I lhall define, for the aalr.e of llimplieity and eleamea, by
calling-
let. Perupti•e memory, the recollection of the ~ or ideas and notione of
the things we have 1ten, in nature or mentally.
2d. Auditi11e menwry, the recollection of the thing~ which we have Mara.
3d. Sapiti"e memmv, t.he remembrance of the things which we have ta1ted.
4th. Olfactiwe memory, the remembrance of the things which we have •mened.
5th. Contacti11e memory, the recollection of the aurfaeea or forma which we
have palped or homlled.
DIVISIOJII OP JIIATtJRAL MJ:MO&Y.
IX. By the synthesis of the foregoing division or analysis, we obtain three
grand diviaions of natural memory, perfectly distinct in their operative characters,
though limilar in their results.
The first kind I ahall call MEOB.A.NICAL, the aecond R.A.Tio:ua:., and the t.hird
lltTos-aoacEPTIV.E (e) memory•
.A.RGUIIDTATION. JIECB.&JIIOAL MEHORY.
X. When a child, at achoo~ is bound to learn a certain number of lines within
a given time, under the threat of a l'.ertain penalty, we aee him walking to and fro,
and repeating aloud portion after portion of his lesaoo, until after a greater or lesa
aumber of repetition~, he finally retains and repeats the whole with more or leas
accuracy. The remembrance of the subject or facta thus learned, by any person,
is what I call mec1umical natural memory. I call it ao for this reason only: that
judgment, reason, and attentiOD, at least concentrated attention, are not called into
action, or at all eventa in a very slight degree, in the formation of such a~quired
memory. The aenae of bearing and the mechWlical motion of the lips form the
greater portion of the baaia of recollection in this instance. So true is this asser-
tion, that, if you aalc the child to tDrite the lesson thus learned instead of reciting
it, you will often, aa I have myaelf experienced, put him to aerious inconvenience,
and however well he may k1WtD his Ieason, he will seldom be able to write it
through, without aaaieting himself; ~ly sometimea, and sometimes una-
voidably, by moving his lipa, aa he writes down the words. Yet it is strange,
though not lea true, that the memory thus acquired is usually of the most tenacioue
and indelible character, and often remains unimpaired till the extinction of life.
We have, among a huodred others, an indubitable proof of this in the ease of our
multiplieatioll table. Wheo we anawer ex a.lm£pto that 9 timea 11 are 99, or 10
times 12 are 120, it ia b)' the means of pure meclaanical memory that we give such
anawen; and becaue we have all learned that table when at school, after repeatina
each euecesaive portion of it an inealculahle number of timea. Thus whether
pleaaing, attractive,and congenial to our taste or not, by constant repetition we are
certain to learn it ~y, and retain it with more or leu tenacity.

uptifJe memory. In fact the commemorative organs of the natural memory, in
this instance, assimilate to theiDBelves, as it were, thoae component parts of the ia-
tellectnal food, which constitute knowledge, and which are molt congenial to the
natural turn of the mind, in a manner nearly limilar to thatby which tAe orgaraiufj
bodiu in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, asaimilate to themselves the nutritive
molec:ulea of the sap, and the c:byle, which have the cloaeat aOinity to their material
organization. The more congenial to the peculiar tom of one's mind are the sub-
jects of hia studies, the more quickly will thi8 sympathetic animilation operate.
Thus it is that a pious individual (not a Tartuffe) will learn much more quickly a
canticle than a Bacchanalian aong; and that a lover ofoature aod ofthe beautiful
will remember ten eclosuea of Virgil or Theoeritua, before he could learn ooe pap
of"Dickena' Notea for general circulation" or twenty linea from Mila Martineau'l
travels in America.

IMPB.SBIBILITY OF MEMORY.
XIV. None will probably deny that there are very few men who could describe or
draw with euetne-, from mere recollection, the shape of a Druidic, or erratic rock,
after having examined it, even with the greatest intere.t and care; or who eould
nee with accuracy a row of Mexican hieroglyprue. or Chineee characters, though
.todied with considerable attention ; or who could recollect a tune aa unhannonioolt
u aome of those with which a Congo miiUitrel accompanies upon the tam-tam (f) ·
tbe phyaical. contortions of a panting Terpsichore of Africa J or who could remem-
ber the lines ofaueh poe try as was sung at Attila'a table with rapturo111 enthusiasm
by the virtuosos of his nomade court. (g) The reason of this is obvioll8. There
is no feeling ofattraction, no link ofcongeniality between abrupt delineations orforms,
cacophonic eounds, or unintelligible images ; and the strings of the human mind
are ell8eotially harmonioua in their nature, when rightly put in vibration. Such ia
the reason why, for example, mathematical science has always had comparatively
ao few adepts, owing to the stiffnees of its language and character; while botany,
painting, music, and poetry, number their neophytes by thouands and tens of thou-
sands. So it is that the learning ofalgebraic formulre, hieroglyphic characters, de-
lineations ofabrupt forms, and unharmonious word' and sounds, require the repeated
application of pure mechanical m.etMr!l· The remembrance of mathematics, how·
ever, requiring mechanical memory pltut judgment, is effected with leas difficulty by
certain privileged organizations. But the recollection of rapturous music, (auditive
memory,) of a harmonious and graceful painting, (perceptive memory,) of a volup-
tuous perfume, (olfactive memory,) of a savory aliment, (sapitive memory,) and of
a velvet surface or a graceful form, (contactive memory,) is almost always the result
of mere intU8-8tutceptive memory, for reasons obvious to the sensible and educated
reader.
In fact, whoever has been blessed by the Deity in being enabled to read Homer
and Virgil in their original tongues, to listen to the divine harmonies of a Mayer-
baer, to gaze at the sublime conceptions of a. Michael Angelo, to contemplate the
magnificent productions of a Canova, and, finally, to wander among the glories of
Rome, ofParis, and of London, like an industrious bee among the flowers of a Hy-
mettian garden ;-whoe\·er has been the recipient of such blel!eings, needs not the
usistance of mechanical memory to store his mind with intellectual gems and har-
monies divine. His ears will always be ringing With rapturous melodies, and his
memory loaded with glittering visions and gorgeous recollections of all the won-
ders of architecture, melody, painting, and literature, with which, like diamonds,
u numcroua as the stars of heaven, this trinitarian head of the old world is
crowned!
The Apollo Belvidere, the Niobe group, the Venus of Medici, and the Laocoon,
will be oontinually gleaming in the wanderings of his thoughts. The parting
lamentation of Andromache, the love of Orpheus and Eurydice, and the gardena
of Alcinoua, will be continually tingling in his ears, with the harmonie11 of the

with lesa difficulty ofien, than the well-defined outlines of a modem monument,
however grand it may be. But these also have become an object of a certain \

of ancient and modern times united. Look around and see the myriads of flowers

recoUectitle.faeuUy of an individual is 8f10d, he will get at the fkct or facts, whieh he
lesires to remember, by calling directly upon the fact itself, and his wishes will be
gra11ted without mach trouble. Bufif his memory fails him, i. e. if in any given
indanee he ealla for a fact, onee carefully stored up in his memory, and it fl\ils to
come at his command, then there is no power on earth that ean poBBibly enable him
to recollect it. In vain wiD he repeat his call, in vain will he scratch his forehead,

XVI. A single anecdote, the authenticity of which ean be verified at any time,
ifiteh&uld meet with ekepticism, will give you a preliminary idea, ofthe superiority
of artijicial over natural memory,-that is to say, when the system and its EUIIIOcia-
\ione are perfectly rational and phiJoeophieaJ,-and of the difficulty, if not impoui-
b£lity of forgetting what has been once committed to the memory upon the princi-
ples of thoee philosophical associations.
It was towards the beginning of June laat, (1844,) nearly three months after my
third Jeeture in New-York, that I was paBBingby the Astor-House, in company with
Dr. B. Forry. We entered the Book-store or Messrs. Langley, who I knew had
been members of one of my New-York elaAes. The conversation fell very natu-
rally upon my "brilliant succt>a" in Philadelphia, where I had been obliged to di-
vide my two thousand one hundred subscribers into three different clarses, for want
ofa room large enough to contain them all together, and upon my still more "bril-
liant sueoen" in New-York, where my varioue clanea had attained the number of
nearly two thousand five hundred subscribers. In one ofthe i'llten-uptitoe pawu in
our conversation," Well," said I to Mr. Langley," did you attend all the Jeeturet
of the course 1"
The answer was that he had not m!.aed a single one.
"But," continued Mr. L., "I must declare candidly to you, that, although I
attended your lectures with the most eager aseiduity1 and although I proclaim my-
- self one or the warmestadmirers of the syatem, yet I muet 111y that I do not remem-
ber a single one of the facts, which yon taught us u:-abrupto, and ao happily, while
we were in the lecture room."
I then aeked him, whether he had, at any time eince, paid any attention to the
system,or to any particular portion of its applicatio111 which I had illustrated.
He anawered that "eandor'' compelled him to aay that'' he had not;" that for

"waat of time," owia1 to the eJt~JMB of hil daily employ....u, aDd th vaiabl
pre-occupations ofhill mind upon ordioary and extraordinary b011ineu matters, " he
had not had a single moment to devote to the study of the system, or any part o(
it : but that he was, nottDitMtanding, perfectly conviooed of ita abeolute practica·
bility, and. the immense advantagea which might be derived from ita applieatioM,
by what he had aeen others do with it."
I asked him again if he thou~rht he could swear that he did not, indeed, r(lmem-
ber any of the facta he had learned in the lecture room.
The answer was that he thought he could, with perfect eecurity.
" Wel~" said I, " let us make one siogle experiment, merelyto try the powera ofthe
aystem for the purpose ofdemonatratioo. Thousands were the facta, you remembtr,
for you cannot have forgotten th.U, illuatrated in the lecture room doting the coune.
Among the moat difficult OD88, as agreed upon by all the membera of my diiereBt
claAea, were, you know, the latitude. and longihM.lu ofall the capitalsof the globe ia
1eneral, and of the principal citiea of the United States in partioular; ii; in taking til
random only one among so many citiea, you should remember ita latitude aad Jon-
Jritude without effort, and by the mere powera of the ueociation ao loog since H8Cl
in my illustrations of this particular fact, will the experiment made under such cir-
cumstances give, in your opinion, a aatislkctory evidence of the true powers of the
aystem; particularly when a reasonable degree of attention and practiee ahall have
been allotted to its easy, and, as aome say, 'captivating study'1"
This proposition and ita conclusions were instantaneoualy acreed upon; Mr. L.
declaring, moreover," that to this part of the lectures he had, perhaps, paid atilll-.
attention than to any other."
"Well," interrupted Dr. S. Forry," so much the better I Tell us, then, theiati-
tctde and longitude, for example, of CoD8tantinople I"
After musing for a. short time, Mr. L. answered, laughingly, that "upon h~
honor he could not remember the fo.et I But," be immediately added, "I remember,
however, that Prof. Goumud mentioned something about the Emperor Constantine
(!)and his 'IDOrtky nephetD(!!!)-that'e all I remember.it
"Admirable, then," reaponded I, "for you kad HOtl&ing el.t to recollect bra tAU!''
In fact (see page liv.) the reader acquainted with the firat principles of the ~~ystem,
will see that Mr. L. bad answered, tDil!wut thinking of il, that Constantinople was
ia 4.1° north latitude, and 28° eaat longitude ! This experiment wu the more eo•
elusive, for the reaaon that Mr. L. had paid so little attention to the system that be
did not even know what was to be done to get at the fact aeked for I But the power
of the CUIOCiation wu aueh aa to present inl8llibly to hie memory the fact, even 'be-
fore the rules or principles of the system ahould occur to him.
I will leave the intelligent and conscientious reader to make m. own eommenta
apon, and draw his own conclusions from, thia anecdote·; and enter at once upoo

4. From this, then, we aee the origin attributed w mnemonics by the ancients.
It waa upon this principle, it is said, that Bimooides founded the fil'llt regular syatem
for aiding the memory, of which history make. mention, and of whieb we llball
presently apeak.
5. But as we do not now-a-days appeal to mythological fables for the eaUIIeiJand
explanatioaa of facta pertaining to the under.tanding, but only to L~ and to
Philoaopby, if we interrogate either of them upon this aubjeet, they will an~~Wer
nearly thua: "Men, in all stages of the world, probably, and ~y in a lt&te
of civilization, have ever taken notice, aa it happens to ouraelvea every day, that
upon seeing, even at a great diatance the dwellina ofa penon oftheir acquaintance,
this dwelling called to their mind immediately the pel'llon who occupied it, hia
family, his manners; his affairs, and the relations which they sustained towards him.
The view of a temple could not present itself to their eyes without causing them
to think of the God to who11 it was erected, or the idol wbo occupied the shrine of
Ita sanctuary. A tree of familiar foliage could not present itself to their view,
without recalling to their minds the palatable and delicious fruit, which it produced
in ita proper season. The sight of the sea had undoubtedly more than once,
earried the thoughts to the moumful picture of a atom~,-then the vessel beaten by
the violence of the tempest,-and finally, the shipwreck, amid whoae horrors some
dear friend had become the prey of the fathomle• abyBB. Thence the thoughta
were often, undoubtedly, carried back by the alllliation of IUCOC8Iive ideal!, to other
remembrances more or leas auoeiated with the objects before tllem, nor were they
often stopped in their course, until the view of new objects suddenly awakened
other and more vivid recollections.
6. These facta continually reproducing themselves to the observation, served
110011 to attract the attention of the first thinkers which the human species produced.
And tlleae argued, probably after this sort :
7. 11 Ifit is constantly the ease, that every time we see an objed, to which is at.
taehed aome souvenir, that objeet immediattly recalls to our mind the souvenir ao
attached ; it ought then natw-ally to follow, that if we should connect conditionally
ilela&ed. aouvenira, or even a Mrlea ofsouvenirs, to a series ot' given objects, then
while looking upon those objects, or even thinking of them, those aou,enil'll which
have been so connected with tllem, muat present themaelvee naturally to our mind;
perhapa even irresistibly, at least under certain circumstances." And the fil'llt prae·
tical essay which was made upon this theory, 10 logical, and 10 aimple, was, inooo-

9. It is only neceesary then, in order to decide phiiOBOphically upon the epocll
in which the origin of mnemonics can be fixed, to reason by the aid of the best of
~ which logic can uae in all diBcuaaions, technical or philosophical, that ilt

tll4n in a pare /ltate ofnature, ifnot to decide peremptorily, at least visibly to en-
lighten the question, we shall find by the logical results of our researches, that the
mnemouic art took its origin not ouly from the organization ofsociety, but even frOJD
~cradle of the human race.

other travellers, as well 88 mysel~ have been witneues, will serve to throw some
light upon the question.

remember the fact, that the negroes and negresses ofcertain tribes, like the Indiau
ofAmerica, pierce the cartilage of the nose, and suspend therefrom ear-ringa, flrt-
ger-ringa, and other trinket., the number and variety of which serve to indicate tile
wealth and rank of the wearer. One day I was wandering at random, huntint
in the extensive woods which border upon the banks of the Old Calabar, aboua
one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles above its mouth. At the vel')'
moment when I was going to fire upon an enormous boa-constrictor, reaem-
bling the trunk of a tree both in size and color, who was about to strangle a
young antelope in its winding folds, a negro, as black as o. tt'unk of ebony, and
whose eyes and teeth glittered like spots of milk upon a table ofblack marble, raiael
himself suddenly before me like a spectre, as he shot forth from a jungle of tbiell
aDder-wood which lay between me and the boa; raising his hands to heaven, a..l
·throwing himself on his knees, and opening wide his eyes and mouth, with an air
aa affrighted aa that of Brutus before the terrible phantom of the field of Pbilipili,

each side ofhis nose like t6e yard-arm ofa vessel, had strongly attracted my atten-
tion. This singular nasal orn&r~~ent had, upon lhe right extremity, a twig ofcedar,
to which was attached a email feather of some bird; the left extremity had upon it
a light fragment of the baobab, and a bit of cocon-nut ; the intermediate spacea oo
each side of the nose contained different marks, joined likewise with different piece~~
ofvarious objects. Desirous oflearning the •ignification of these myaterioua sign1,
I tried what influence the fear with which I appeared to have inspired the negro
would have upon him, and made him underwtand that I would fire upon him, unleu
he 1hould explain to me the use of hi• singular nual appendage forthwith. Moa-.
affrighted stil~ after such a threat, the poor fellow, trembling in every limb, eoo-
clucted me through many bye-paths and windings, and after leaping many a roar-
ing torrent, avoiding numerous crocodile•, clambering over various rocka, and dis-
lodging a multitude of serpents and other animal• equally amiable, in the thicket.,
through which I was often obliged to open a paBBnge with the short hanger in my
hand, we at IBit arrived at the thickest part of the forest. There the negro begaa
to point out to me various trees of a conPiderable altitude, whose trunks bore an
almost imperceptible mark, cut upon certain portions of the bark. Then showing
ma an enormous cedar, whose lowest branches were at a great height from th'l
ground, he pointed out at the right extremity of his porcupine quill, the likenell8 be-
aween his twig ofcedar and those of the tree, and endeavored to make me understand
the analogy between the little feather of the guinea-fowl ~ttached to the cedar twig,
and the tree before me, but with signs which I found it impouiblc to comprehend. •
Pas~ing to the left extremity ofthe quill, he pointed out a colossal baobab, then the
light fragment of thie gigantic tree faetened upon his quill, together wilh the bit of
cocoa-nut, with accompanying signa, atill unintelligible to me. He continued the
ume examination of many trees marked at the foot, making me remark some anal-
OU between each tree and some portion of the contents of his nasal ornament,
together with a second object accompanying this likeness, and each time treated me
Ao a multitude of signs perfectly unintelligible. At fast, finding that I could make
»othing of hie gestures, 1 easily made him understand by mine, that he must climb
.U treea, and Jet me 11ee what I could not comprehend. He immediately obeyed.
But wha& was my surpril!8, when I saw him showing me from the top of the oedar
a DUmber of guinea-jf1Wu, which he had dmwn out from a cavity in the tree. He
•eacended, climbed up in like manner the baobab, and aJ\er seeking a little while,
allowed me some cocoa-nute which he had hidden in a hole in one of itll enormou.
hranohe1. He climbed thus in eucceBSion each of the trees whose corresponding
mark was upon his nas.al ornament, and in each of them showed me some object
corre.ponding to the cauntermark, which he bad attached to a lear, or some other
·ditttJocuve sign of each tree, and which he always drew forth from some cavity in
them I The myatery of lhe na.IJal yard-a.rm of this poor child ofnature wu at but

temporaneous generations do not resemble each other any more in their marmel'll
and modes of thinking, than, under the same relation., past generations io succes-
sion have resembled each other.
14. Each century, each age, baa had ita peculiar character and ita particular
manners; from which we conclude, at least we may logicallyenough eonelude, that
the future generations will no more resemble each other, and will dift"er under the
same relalions.

resembled each other, both in their manners and in their habits of thinking, always
experiencing in this stute the same wants and necessities, and always having very
nearly the same limits to their understanding. Starting, then, from this point, 'We
may reasonably conclude that savages at this day are exactly the same as aavagea
in the first stages of the human race.
16. Well then, if lVe see a man living in a stale of pure nature, employing fa
om diU', like our African savage, such meana of ABBOOIATIOl'f to aiel hi• trea.t:lw-
TOUI memory, may we not legitimately anppose that, a:unong the thousands of gene-
~tiona who have peopled the earth from the creation till the deluge, and from the·
clelugo until the first days of post-dilqvian civilization, it wou1d be poeaible to find
one man, were it but one, who has employed some meana analogoUII to tho.e of
our African, for recalling to his mind such or aueh a fact, or even aeries of faeta1
17. Theae hypotheses willlt>ad us then, moat reasonably, to conclude that mne-
moniea does not date ita origin from Simonidea, but that itia as ancient aa the world,
or, atleast, as ancient aa the first agea ofpost-diluvian civilizationI The antediluvi-
an savages had their various wants and treacherous memories. The ctiildren or
Adam had dwellings, acquaintances, altars, fruit-trees, and the aea before them,-
provoking their various souvenirs, by means of the association of ideas, Uke those
of' whom we have spoken a while ago. The first descendants ofNoah were situated
in the midst of similar circumstances. We may, then, reasonably carry the origin
of mnemoniC3 aa high, at least, as the first organization of pon-cliluftaft society.
18. But Iogie is not alone in forming a solid basis for this hypothesis ; it is like-
wise wonderJully corroborated by eertainjact. orwhich we are, unconaeioualy, the
daily witnesses, and which have been observed in the remotest antiquity.
19. We find it mentioned, indeed, by the most ancient author., that the Romans

tltfletnemia, wboae lawe mao every where unconsciously obeys.
20. The IllUDe method of intuitive mnemoniea ia practiced in our day as well aa
among the aocienta, by olviliad as well as •vage nationa.
21. T hua the Cbine.ee who wish to recall a fact ofsome importance, say. a mia-
aionary,• fasten a bit of thread or a light ribbon of some certain color, according to
the nature of the IJOI.menir, to their long moW!tachioa; and sometimes attach a little
bell ofa particular sound to the brim oftheir bats, shaped like a revereed lily, which
may recall constantly to their memories, while walking, the object to be remembered.
The Peraiana for the same purpose tie a knot in their scarfs.t
22. We every day see persons who take snuff making an almost constant use of
their BDutf-box for the same purpoae ; one places in it a bit of paper, another a gold
or silver coin, according to the importance attached to the souvenir which he would
aotneglect. ThUll aleo the traveller aeea, almost every inatant, in France, individu-
als carrying a bit ofpaper, or of white ribbon, or even a simple thread, in one of the
l»utton holea of the coat or vest, to remind them that they musi do such or such a
thing in the copne of the day, or even at epochs often more distant. These differ-
ent objects striking every instant the view and attention of the individual, forcibly
r:ecall to him the souvenir, which he hns aMOCiated with them, and there ia no dan-
ser that his memorj, thus continually wamed, can prove treacherous.
23. But, what are we to conclude, again, from the generality of these observa-
tions'I • • • A fact ofthe utmott importance: not only that mnemoniea has been
practiced in all time and by all p«Jple, under forms more or leBB perfect, and as if
by an intuitive sentiment, but that its principlu are al' much the result of the func-
tions of human intelligence, as motion is n natural consequence of the will.
Thence also originated those different systems which by turns had for their
ebject tbe direction and perfecting of thia natural 10ant of an aid to the memory ;
syltems of which we shall soon speak.
:U. But to retum to what we have already said of the incontttlable origin of
mneDlODica1 as an art, from the first organization at least ofpolt-diluvian societies.
ICOYPTLUI BIEROOLYPBICS.
15. The curio111 and interesting researches of ProfeBBor Morgenatem of Dorpat,
upon thiuubject, seem wonderfully to corroborata thia latter hypothesis. In one of
.hia reeont essays upon the mnemonic art among the ancients, he not only refutes,
and to\ally annihilate. the pretensions ofSimonides and others to the discovery of
tbe art, but he likewiso traces its origin, with the most plausible and oftentimes the
most solid arguments, as far as the hieroglyphiea of the Egyptians.
26. Thus, then, the monuments ofancient Egypt having their origin in the most
remote epocba of Egyptian civilization, and theEe monuments being almost entirely
eovered with images and hieroglyphic signs and symbols, it would follow from this
hypcnhesia, that the Egyptians had not only practised mnemonics from the remotest

frl. Yet whatever may be the antiquity Bllligned to Egyptian mnemonics, bo•
ever great may have been ita popularity among the Egyptians, and whatever the
doubts which may be entertained reepecting thie latter point, one fact is certain,
inconreetabls, and undeniable, that the mnemonic art was practiced among them
upon a very large IIGBle, that it was held in greathonor, and that it was carried to a
high degree ofperfection.
28. But where llball we find the proofofthis uaertion 1 In the truthful Herodo-
tue. He th'QII expreaea himeelf in Book II. (Euterpe) LXXVIII '!" "Thoee Egp-
tiana who live in the ooltivated part ofthe country, are, of alii have seen, the mOlt
itagemou., beitlg attemi"e to tlte ~ent of memory beyond. all the rut tf'
~"
And then, atiH better to illustrate the importance which these "ingenious"
mnemoniatl attached to their doctrines, the Father of History immediately adds the
following curious ·circumstance, smiling, doubtless, while be wrote it:t "To give
some idea of their mode of life, (in the practice of the art,) for three days eucce.-
aively in each month, they nee purges,(!) v6mits, (! !) and elysters," (!II) &c.t This
last eomideration, extraordinary aa it may appear, will serve, at least, to give the
reader an idea ofthe extreme importance which tbie people, so deeply versed in all
the aeiences, moral, civil, and reHiiOWI, as well as in the arte and literature, attached
to mnemonics, or the cultivation of the memory.

29. Bot to return to the nrigin of the art : According to all the traditione of an-
tiquity, and the different historians whose writings yet remain to us, Egypt enjoyed
a high state of civilization, while all the surrounding countries, and particularly
Greece, were plunged in profound barbarism. From Egypt came all the civili-
zation of Greece with the first colonies who followed Danaos,the brother of..Egyp-
tus, into Argoe. The succeeding ooloniee brought over gradually, and by turns,
the Arts, the Sciences, and Letters. We see also that during the moat flourishing

t.ieal, religious, political, and sclentitio education completed, until they had made their
"tour of Egypt," juat 88 the geni\UOII of our time, make their "tour of Peril llM
Italy." We eee succesaively aoiog there, auch men as Tbalea, Epimen.edea, Py-
thagora•, Herodotus, and Plato; succeuively they enriched and glorified their coun-
try, with the knowledge acquired from the Egyptian Priests,• while rendering
always the grealelt homage to the lights of Egypt. Finally, without resting upon
the hypothesis of Prof688or Morgenatern, we certainly see in Herodotus that "the
Egyptians poa6188d the m01t oelebrated mnemonic achooll in the world." Then
why may not Bimonidea have vi8ited Egypt, like all the other great geniQiel ofhis
age-although his biograpbel"' remain silent upon the aubject t-and why may he
not have brought thence the elements ofhis system, u Pythagoraa had done before
him the doctrine ofMetempsychosis and that of the true Cosmography'l Thalea, the
geogenictheory of the globe, as Plato in later timea had brought the knowledge of
the Atlanttt, and Herodotus that of the antiquities of the world'l
30. But if, in truth, Simonidea did invent the mnemoaie art, how is it probable
that, according to the relation of Herodotus, it would have been 80 univerully and
80 highly cultivated in Egypt in 80 short a time after its dilcovery by the poet of
Ceoa, while the art remained in 80 great a ltate ofinferiority in Greece'l And pu-
ticularly when we consider the excel8ive and well known pride of the Egyptians,
who had, moreover, such a horror of the sea that they never travelled, and who, itis
well known, never deigned to borrow any thing from the other nationa of the earth,
whom they stigmatized as barbarians, and for whom they entertained auoh pro--
found contempt. For we find that when Herodotus was travelline in Egypt, about
the year ~0 B. C., Simonides was living, we may say, in all his ~rlory, since he
died, very aged, in the year ~7 before Christ. l
CONCLUSIONS,
31. We will conclude, then, from these different comparison• and hypotheses
which we have discu'SIIed, and from our various illustrations of the subject:
1st. That Mnemonics, or the art of artificially aiding the memory, is 88 ancient
as the human apeciee, being one of the inherent want. ofthe human intellect, in tho
same ratio aa food is to thebody, and matter to the senses.
2d. That the Egypti:llll practiced and cultivated it before the Greeks who bor-
rowed it from them, through the intervention of Simonides who first introduced i.$
into Attica.

considered of so much importance, by a people moat renowned for their aeience and

32. Laying aside then all the suppolitioos advanced by the aneienfa of IRlper-
•ralinterventioo. in the origin of moemonica, we have .en that the obeeroatiote
alone of some of the natural meclaanical aneciatWn8 employed by man througla
all time, must have Jed the firet t4inkent of the human 1pecies to •ystemo.ti:u by
81tabliehed ndu a pri~~eipk which seemed to them incontestable.
33. The difficulty presented to them consisted undoubtedly in finding the mean.
.t110lviog this problem; and in all probability-without adducing, with Profeaor
Morgenstern, the Egyptian hieroglyphiea,-the first system of mnemonics wae
wholly B?Jmbolical, that is to say, a certain series of idecu was associated with
oertain objects, animate, or inanimate, offering some points of analogy, either i11
their form, or in their essence, with the ideas to be remembered. Thus, for in-
lltance, they would 8SBociate a philosophical sentence with an emblem attributed to
wisdom, as the ow~ or bird of Minerva; if the sentence reached a. certain length,
if it even extended hy aucceasive developments to the form of a. diecourse, they
must ha'Vll applied each pbl'a.Be, or rather each paragraph, to each one of the mod
characteristic parts of the animal, as at first, the beak, then the eyu, the eart11 the
lUCk, the wings, the tail, the feet, the claw, and so oo,-so that in recollecting first
that rucA an a.niJoal represented Bllch a discourse, and in recollecting the different
pa.t11l of the animal in their assigned order, the paragraphs of the discourse asso-
ciated with each one of theee different parts would represent -themsl!Mc.~ more ot
less efficaciously to the memory. If glory or politics formed the subje~hi
diacounre, they would take an eagle, a lion, or a.ny other animal having in ita
JDaDners or ita motions some analogy, more or less predominant, with the subject ia
question, and this principle of association would be thus generalized more or less J
cbey would first take the animals, including man, then the vegetaMes, the utenail•
or objects of industry and the arts ; the clements even, physical phenomena, ani
lnally astronomical phenomena were made to contribute their quota of sym-
bola,-as Quintilian tells us was the case with MetrodortJs, whom he satirizes, "'
pauattt, and whom he accuses of charlatanian1 upon this IRlbject. And indeed it
would be impoaeible to accord a mnemonic oritin to the hieroglyphics, accordioa
to the hypothesis of Morgenstern, without having reeourae to this syatem, ainee aU
hieroglyphic monuments of the Egyptians are covered with thia apecies ofsymbol&.

"From this actofSimonidea itappeare,
that memory may be helped by certain
images marked out in the mind1 and o(
this every one may be convinced by his
own e:sperience. For when af\er some
time we return to places we formerly
were in, we not only know them again,
but remember what we did in them, the
persona we had aeen, and the very
thoughts that employed our mind. Art
therelbre here, as in most things, pro-
ceeds from experimental knowledge. For
exercising memory, many make choice
of a apacioua place, r~arkable fbr a
great variety of thin~ as suppose a
large house, divided mto many apart-
ments. Whatever in it is worth notice,
they carefully fix in the mind, that the
thought without delay and beaitation may
he able to run over all its parts. The
first material point is to be at no loss in
recollection ; for that memory ought to
be very good, which ia to help another.
Then what they have written down or
meditated upon, they mark with another
si~, to keep them in mind of it : and
th1a sign may be for the matter they are
to speak or, as of navigation1 warfarei

or in makin11 tbe tour of cities, or m
viewing a p1ece of painting. If such
places afford no proper images, they
may be fhlmed according to fan~. It
is therefore neeeeaa to have

rrt. Such is the .yltem of which the ancients boa~ted 10 much! to the power of
which they paid so much homage, which they held in such great esteem, and which
they recommended with such pompous eulogiums, for the assii!tance of the mem-
ory ! It is while ~peaking ofthis system that Cicero says, "I am not yet so learned

MNBMONICS DURING TBB MIDDLE AGES.-ITS REVIVAL.
40. From the time of Pliny till the epoch of the revival of letters, we hear no-
dUng more said by authors r6S1'6cting the mnemonic art. The barbarism of the
middle age., which enveloped every thing in ill thick darkness, respected Simoni-
des no more than Tyro. With stenography, or the arl of abridging chirography,
which the ancients practiced alao with a sort of reverence, dieappeared mnemonicw,
er the art of mlargittg the memory.
41. During aU this long period of the dark age-, we find mnemonics mentioned
only once; it was by the celebrated Raymond Lolly, in his an magna. From the
time ofLully, who died in 1315, until towards the end of the sixteenth century, moe-
monica was buried in a profound slumber, until finally there appeared a man of rare
Jeaming, aod of intelligence as remarkable, who suddenly awoke it from its long
lethargy, and gave to it an impulse which was not to be hereafter paralyzed, although
tt was obliged to atop from time to time, in Its onward progress, aa if to take breath.
42. This man was Lambert Schencke~ a German scholar distinguished in IWI
time for many remarkable works on proiOdy, grammar, rhetoric, &e. He trav-
elled many years in Germany, the Netherlands, and even in France, teachinjf
Ai8 system, every where with the most distinguished success; and obtained from
the Univeraity of Paris the privilege of teaching his mnemonic doctrines in that
capital, where be filled the mnemonic chair to an advanced age. Yet the system
which he taught was no other than that of Simonides, slightly modified, enlarged,
and simplified, in aome ofits applications. In his old age be abdicated the chair ill.
&avor of his friend and pupil Martin Sommer,• a young Silesian of great talent,
and invested him formally with all his authority, while eommunioating to him the
influence which his long sueeeN had acquired.

much talent the advantages of the method, which did notfail ofprocurilli him im·

4.9: Another inconvenience seemed to be joined to that cauaed by this exeesa of
zeal among the adepts. The best applications of the various systems proposed
were written in the Latin tongue, then the only language in which almost all lite-
rary or scientific subjects were treat.ed. But in proportion as the darkness of the
seventeenth century faded away before the numerous light&, which suddenly illu-
minated Europe, and dispersed, forever, the Jut shadows of the scholastic pedant-
ry of those times, the Latin tongue rapidly lost its former predominance over the
vulgar language ; and the diflieulty of teaching systems written in the language of
Cicero, added to the difliculty of translating those same systemt1 Into the vulgar
tongue, reacted simultaneously upon the Mnemonic Art. From that moment itap-
peared to suffer in its propagation and progrea, until a new impulse waa given to
it upon bases entirely different. It then rallied its forces under the auspice. of a
third renovator.
From this period Mnemoniee took a new flight, which conducted it, at\er some
unprofitable gropinp, ~ the higbMt clegnle ofperfection, to which human intelleet
could raise it.

52. Direetina his attention to Mnemoniee, aa has been more or le• the case
with all seneible men who have devoted themlelvea to the cultivation ofatudy, hm
the time of Cicero until the present day, and struck with the insufficiency of aH
the vaunted systems before him; Dr. Grey thought, doubtless from his younger
years, to remedy the defeota of an art, in which hia reason led hlm to perceive,
though dimly, the immenee advantages which could be derived from it, though en•
Teloped in o.lmoet insurmountable asperities. lilly that he probably thought, when
"e7?1 young, of the i7Uipired revolution which he wa• about to effect in Mnemonice J
for when the first edition of his system appeared, in 1730, he had hardly reached
the age of thirty-seven yeare, since he was hom in 1693. Besides, there is every
appearance that the elaboration of his lflt&m occupied him, during many yeara of
care and attention; for in the editions eubsequent to his firat, and the fourdl edition,
which appeared in 1756, fit\een yeara before hie death, which happened in 1771, he
seems to have made no material changes in his work.
53. According to the testimony of the candid Dr. Grey himself, it was while one
day reading a work of the learned William Beveridge, Bishop of St. Asaph, Eng·
land, entitled "Arithmetica Ol.ronologica,'' that the lintidea occurred to him ofthat
aystem which he afterwards gave to the world. He proceed• to say, that aocordina

It is worthy of note that the Jews, especially in the titles of their books, for the
purpoae ofindicating the year in which they were printed, collected the numerical
letters in a certain order, of which we will give some examples. Indeed they in-
vented one or more words, or made use ofsome Biblical sentence, whose significant
letters, hoWlloever disposed, would amount to the proposed number. For example:
In the Biblical books, edited by Josephus Athia Amatelodamia, three title-pages

59. To expatiate upon the extremely interesting character of thill quotation,
would be superfluous. It will at once make a deep impression upon the scholar
wbote mind is imbued with a taste for the curiosities of literature. The high an-
tiquity of these ideas gives a venerable air to the science of mnemonics. It was ·
evidently studied by "the world's gray fathers," but it has been reserved for their I
children at this late period to see that perfected which Willi begun 10 early, and '
generations yet unborn will bleu the discovery which emooths for them the rugged
paths ofscienee, and stre'MI with flowers the ascent to the Temple ofTruth.
CO!fSE~t1ENOE8 OP THESE R£MARit8 OF BEVERIDGE.
60. A branch ofbamboo, ofa quality unknown in Europe, found upon the shorea
of\he Atlantic, is said to have inl!pired Columbus with the idea ofa new world.
A light vapor which raised almost imperceptibly the lid ofa copper boiler, a phe-
nomenon, apparently so unimportant, and which tl1ousands of generations had ob-
served before the Marquis ofWorcester, placed humanity altogether in adoance of
TIME upon thia great path of civilization, through the instrumentality of Watt, of
Arkwright, and of Fulton. And these two circumstances, apparenUy so indifferent
in themselves, at first sight, changed finally the face ofthe world.
61. Such, comparatively, was the effect which the first glance Dr. Grey cast
upon the accidental remarks ofthe learned Bishop of St. Asaph, was soon to pro-
duce in the domain ofintelligence : from that single glance, indeed, originated as
complete a revolution in the mnemonic art, as that brought about by the invention
ofthe steam-engine in mechanice.

A-em numerical lligna, Grey suddenly uked hioweH; could not the IUile thing he
done for the English language 1 •
63. From this question to the practical elllllly of the conceived idea, there wu
but one step. But an enormous dilfaeulty now seemed to oppose his farther pro·
gress : the Hebrews, like the Greeks and Roman~~: made use of the letters of their
respective alphabets, to number their arithmetical quantitie., while, not only in the
English, but in all the languages of modem Europe, particular numerical signa
were employed to express their quantities.
64. The point in question, then, for Grey was to in11e71t some compensatinc
meane, to find some equivalent analogy, that be might obtain a satisfactory reeult.
65. He had already been struck with the immense advantages which 1night be
obtained from this species ofme((lmorpilMe ofjignru into VXJrd6, to aid the memory
in retaining dates and statistical facta ofall kinds generally; a kind ofmnemoniza-
tion which the known Bf•tems of locality did not permit, for those systems were
applied more particularly to the mnemonization of 1entence1 or aitiOOW'IU, longer
or shorter, according to the intention at least, of their respective authors. Never-
theless, men of'genius do not stop abort at the first little pebble which they meet ia
their path, and the Rector ofHinton waa a man ofgenius. Having then no eetab-
Jiehed numericallettera to employ, be pondered upon the means of creating ~
Tentlonalones.
66. Taking then the ten numerical signa
1 2 3 4 6 6 7 8 ~ 0
be said to himself: Let us make 1 the equivalent of b and a, 2 that of d and e, S
that oft and i, 4 that off and o, 5 that of l and u, 6 that of1 and the diphthong au,
7 that ofp and oi, 8 that ofk and ei, 9 that ofn and ou, and 0 that ofz and y,-and
then, let us hereafter represent by a systematic diagram, like the following, the
correlation of these equivalents.

67. If, then, continued the learned Doctor, we have any number whatever to
mnemonize, as, for example, the date of the universal deluge, which happened In
the year 2348, we will try to form with the consonants, vowels and diphthongs repre-
senting each figure in this number, a 1D0rcl as natural as possible, "which we may
be able to retain much more easily than the number itself;" thus, for example, for,
2 we will take the equivalent d, for 3 the vowel i, for 4 o, and for 8 k, and thus form
the word diok. But to be able more easily to arrive at the date, the Doctor directed
that there should be always added to the mnemonic word, the jir1t 8!Jllable of the
word sipifieative of the mnemonized event; thus, for in~t~tance, taking for the uni-
versal deluge, the first syllable del, and adding to this syllable the mnemonic word
diok, Grey forms the radical word DEL-diok, to represent the date ofthis event.

and its striking similarity to the scriptural process. He will probably be convinced
\hat he would be more certain ofrecollecting a 1DOrd, whatever it might be, than a

70. But for the better appreciation ofthete remarks, and of tha.e which we lhall
presently bring forward, it is essential to enter, a little in advance, upon the priDci-
ples of the applications of Grey.
71. Besides the fonnation of radical tDOrd8, of which we have given an uaa-

as he himself saye, to the different numerical signs,-aod this we will presently tle-

73. His aecond was his proeeediDg "arbitrarily," instead of ..aying eome p/li-
loBophical combination in the disposition of the providential element&, which a hap-

and who had not even given themselves the trouble of examining hie work before
they assailed it whh their foolish atta.eks; or, rather, whose intellects, lodged and

llimple comprebeaeion of the ingenuity of the man whoee works, so eurioua and 10

He there taught hie •ystem with similar 1uoceaa, and finally publilbed it, adapted

iion, illustrated by engraTiBgs. From this edition we shall preeendy wraet 101M
passages, to show in what oonsiets the principal merit ofa syetem which produced.a
great a sensation. .
88. We have already seen that, in the changing the figures into the letters ot
the alphabet, and 11ice 11er«J, Dr. Grey had placed at /uaard, and "arbitrarily," u
he himselfsays, eaeh letter of the alphabet for each numericalsiguor figure. Thele
was no more reason for hl• making b the eqniY&lent of1, than there was for~
It that ofse"Ven, and so ofall the othere.
89. The only idea which occurred to him of ny aualOJY between the letun
and the figures,• waa that of placing the first letter ofthe word Three fOr 3 opca

aigle was destined to enkindle the brilliant light that was to illomioue tbe bithefto
obecure and impracticable domains of Mnemoayne, the flair Goddeas of Memory,
and mother of1he Muaes. But we must not anticipate too eagerly.

him to master with a success adequate to his ambition and thirst for knowledge,
and respectfully submitting his judgment to the examples and COUWiels of the great
men,• who had practiced and recommended mnemonies, while sanctioning tho
powerful advaot.agee of the art with the weight of their ll.igh approbation, Feinaigle
was one day most happily iaspired with the idea of seeking amonr the numeroua
aystems publi.lhed before him, tor one which 'I'IOUld seem the mo1t proper for hia
pupose..
93. In the midst of the almoat undefinable chaos into whicll he had plunged to
eatis(v his laudable curiosity, he became convinced, and thought •incerely, too sin-
cerely, unfortunately for hia own fame, he thought, I say, that the climax of mne-
monic perfectionwould coumt in uniting in" nngk 1f6lem. the principles of Simoa-
ides or •imple localitiu, the qmbolical auociation~, probably first imagined by the
Egyptians, and the Utero-numerical system of Grey ; and the moment that he
nceeeded in bringiog about the copulation of these three bodies, homogeneou.,
tach one in its own apbere, be produced a hetero,reneoua body, a veritable Sphyn.s,
a monster, of whieh the system of Grey formed the head, that of Si.monide• the
body, and tbat of Metrodorne the tail ; with thia variation from the mythological
aphynx, that the bead of thi8 monster waa of gold, with eyu of diamowla respl~
dent with tbe future, the body of stone, rough and uopoUebed,&Dd the tail of--
oakum!
94. Let us commence with the head, or principal part of this Sphynx, for there
iadeed lies all the glory ofFeinaigle, all the merit of his system.
95. Struck with the extreme ingenuity of the fortu88le principle of Grey'•
~~)'Stem, be saw at onoe that tltere waas the soul of-the system which he wu
imagining. The only thing for him to do, at first, was to disentangle this soul from

ud which, illltead of an intelligent being, p!'ODOUneiog intelligible vxn-rJ., uttered

aa to fonn with them rational fl'01"dlr, appertaining, according to choice, not only to
a given language, but, if neeeasary, to all the languages of the globe ! . . .
96. Surely thill was a problem, whose solution bad appeared, to Grey himself,
equal, at least to the quadrature of the circle,-and yet Feilllligle dared propo~e
to himselfthis problem; and not only did he propose it, but he solved it, not alto-
gether ia an ~ matbemaliea! IIUlDIIer, but aa8iciently, at .leaet, to merit for
..., the gratit¥de ofpoeeen'ty.
f11. 1Daead of prooeecting &om the simple to the CG~RpGUnd, he t.Uowed the in-
veree order, and proceeded from the COI1IfJCI"'ICl to the simple. Being eoa'rineed that

resolution, mnemonica, without his knowledge, had taken a gigantic step towards
the future. Supposing, said he, that our alphabet was, like thato( the Hebrews,
composed ofCDrl80nanls having a conventional value, ifthe Hebrews were able to
form 'IDOrCU with their consonants, and with these words to make PEBFECTLY ll'ITEL-
LIOIBLE p/af'CUIU, why ahotrld we not be able to do the 118.1De'l • •
98. Yet 11 difficulty still opposed his progre1111. Grey had made use of only ten
consonants; there are, at least, nineteen; and, having left nine unappropriated in
his equivalents, he must haTe necessan1y found, in a series of different numbers,
aome fD'J1'ct. which could not possibly be fOrmed, since certain letters ofthese warda
were not at all represented in the Key ofGrey; m, for example, was not found there
• at all, nor ,, nor r, nor c, nor g, nor f, nor q, nor :r, nor cA, nor sh. It was not then
astonishing that, by the 11yatem or Grey, it was impouible, with or without his vow-
els or diphthongs, to form rational words, or, at least, only a very EIDaH number. It
was neeeseary then fbr Feinaigle to overcome this new difticulty, which roae to the
height of 11 new problem, for since he must necessan1y llimplify, and since there
were only teta figures for at least nineteen consonants, it was necessary to arrange
the coll80Dafttl in sucb a manoer aa to avoid confusion ofone kind or another.
99. Pruningoft; then, without exception, all tbe t10tDtl8 and diplallaaap, Feioaigle
placed before him on a line the ten figures:

and then upon a second liDe the eonsooants:

giving for the reaaoos of this particular dilltn'bntion, the foUowing argumeftts :
101. The reader will perceive, at the first glance, indeed, that the lettlen 111'8
DO& JDerely arbiuarily dispoeed as in the Key of Dr. Grey, bat are adapted u
.-rly as po.ible to thefor• of the figuru, e. g.

• f1, ill the appropriate letter to represent 2; there are two down strokes in it.
"m, furnishes ua with three down strokes; it will then give the idea of 3; if we
place a three thua c:t:> , it will afford a tolerable outline of the letter m.
"r, is to represent 4: r when written, resembles somewhat a 4. The letter r
occurs also in our word four; in the German fohr; in the Dutch mer; in the Latin
quatuor; in the French quatre; in the Spanish and Portuguese fJUalrO; in the
Italian qtt.o.ttro; in the Greek cia•~~; in the Rt11111 wtyfre; and m a variety of
other l~agea.
"The English L was borrowed from the RomllDII ; the~ had it from the Greelra,
and they again from the Hebrews, whose lamed is much hke our L, excepting that
dle angle is somewhat more aeute. L was used as a numeral letter for Jifly, and
may therefore be assigned to the figure 5.
"d, is to re~nt 6 ; since cl, in writing, is the reversed form of this figure.
" c, k, R• q. The figure 7 with a slight curvature, may be made to resemble &
crooked stJcl{, and as we shah remember this stick the better, if something be hung
upon it, a cage shall be suspended there. In the word cage we obtain the conso-
nanl8 c and g; 1c also is added to the number, for c is more frequently pronounced ,
hard (ka) than it is soft (•e); q, being a guttural and a crooked letter, shall go
along with the cage and the stick. For the figure 7 there are then c, k, g, and q.
" b, h, "• "'· In the figure 8 there are two nought., or two round thinga ; t.he8e
may be converted into beehi"u, and if one be placed upon the other, there will be
a tolerably accurate idea of the figure 8. In the word beehi~ are obtained b, h, ";
aDd "' may be added, for it is comf.Ounded of ""·
crE..J; The figure 9 is not unhke a pipa, and as a pipe is aeldom uaed withom
a puJf of smoke issuing from it, we have the p and f m these two wordll; they are
inseparably connected, and cannot easily be forgotten.
1 •• z, z. Th6 o beiog a round body, it may be compared to a wheel or grinder
in a mill; this wheel, when in swift rotation, gives out a hiBBing souad, and the
hiaaing consonants •, z, z, are attached to the cipher. z is formed from two half
circlu ; and z i• the first letter of the word zero.
" The.e letters and the figures which they are intended to represen~ should be
impreBIIed strongly upon the memory, as the letters must be converted mto words
by the introduction of vowels.
" The consonants are alone resorted to, for they compose, like the skeleton ofthe
human body, the principal parts; the wwez. are but the ligamef!U."
102. ThtlS, as the reader will be convinced, ~bile reading these e:xplanatiens,
there was in this a retUOn of aBBOciation, a little stretched upon the couch of Pro-
crustes, it is true, in certain cases, but at least there was a reason of some •ort,
instead of the arlJi.lrary barrenness of Grey. And surely, no one would refuse the
just tribute of praise to Feinaigle, for the ingenuity which he displayed in this
rational distribution of the articulationa and figures. From this moment the for-
mation or rational tliOTCU belonging to the dictionary of the language, became
possible and even easy ; and with any union of figures whatloever, the Key fur-
nished consonants, with which not only ilolated words, but even phrases could
be formed, without taking any notice of the vowels, simple or double.
103. Thus, for example, with the figures :

There was now a hope of forming rational wordt from an the barbarou1 ·one• of
Grey: and instead of hie immemorable memorial linu, to form rational phra~u,
producing imaru, and consequently more retainable by the memory, inasmuch
aa they po118S11 a greater sympathy for the reuon and judgment.
105. Yet it waa not wholly given to Feinaigfe to carry Ilia inspiration to that
degree of absolute excellence, with which it was yet neceaary to be imprellled, ill
order to attain constantly this last result, namely, that of forming rational worde
and sentence& His genius was deatined to e&op in it. flight, io the best part of the

toils and disorder of a long voyage, and transported with enthusiasm at the sight
of the beautiful country which they have discovered, they fix themselves there at

of their joy, in the enthuliasm of their triumph, the heighu and the mountaiM
which conceal the gold and the diamonds, and which a little more calm, and a few
more slight efforts would have infallibly enabled ·them to dilcover.

Absorbing, presently, the Bm colonie• by their greater developments, and the
richer results of ·their later discoveries, they lord it over them in posterity, aa the
Anglo-Saxon race overpowers, at the present day, in cretemdo, the one which firlt
discovered the New World, and fell asleep, through the elfecta ofjoyand glory, upoa
tbe very tbreebold of the more precious treasures, (aificulture, industry and com-
merce,) after becoming intoxicated with the gold of the more superficial and easily
acceuible mines.
107. Such was the lot of Grey, who had himself eclipsed Simonides-Feinai-
gle came and aupplanted him. Such was to be also the destiny of Feinaigle. A
genius more happy was still to improve upon hill\, while embracing all hia defects.
And finally this conqueror, in his turn, was to be overthrown by a conquerorstill more
happy, who believes that he can give thanb to that Providence who has permitted
him, finally, to place the key- stone of the arch upon the temple which to-day he
dedicatee to Mnemosyne; a temple whose first stone was placed by the Egyptians,
in a put which is lost in the night of ages; whose firat foundations were laid by
8imonides ; whose principal walls were raised by Grey; whose sanctuary was
enlightened by Feinaigle; whose dome was commenced by Aime Paris ;-and
which it waa reserved for PhreM-!IInemotechny to continue, to complete, to deco-
rate without, and to enrich within, with a series ofnew and most precious treasurea,
which the reader will soon enjoy, if he shall decide to be initiated iDto the~
of the Goddese, and to sacrifice, however little, at her altar.

109. In this new distribution of the consonants, aa equi'Mlent8 for the figure&,
(vide diagram No.lOO,) the reader is invited to notice the following points, to which
llhall oaly allude hele, &o ftliAIIIle and aaalyse them hereafter io tbeir proper
pla.ce.
lst. Notwitb8tanding the important 1riftt which Grey had given (see No. 66,)
in his placing t for 3, from t-hree ; and d. for 2, from t-wo, Feinaigle wrsiped u
we have seen t to 1, following the analogy of theform, aad placed d. for 6, withOQt
giving any plausible reaeon fur this analogy, except that the letter d had the fOrm
of a Bi:E turned from the right to the left.
2d. Yet to the figure 7 he gave aU the letters having the same pronunciation
before the vowels a, o, u ; that is to say, e, k, g, q; a magnificent idea ! whose ex-
treme importance aod extensive bearings we shall shortly see.
3d. He again followed the IIIIJlle idea with regard to 0, to which he gave • and
:t1 as having very nearly the same pronunciation; but he had the misfortune to add
z-we shall shortly see upon what faJ.e grounds.
4th. He gave " to 8 and p to 9; and then, as if some jeaJou. geniua had guided
his pen and directed hls mind, he added b, h, and 1D to 8, andfto 9.
5th. He did not mention at all the compound leUere-ch, M, ph-whence itII11J8t
ioeritably rewlt, that many woris of the language could not be repnwented, on ac-
count of thi1 omission.
110. After having noticed these various modificatioos in the litenHJumerieal
Key ofFeinaigle, it now remains for us to take a glance at his great error-his symbol-
ical localitiM; not so much for the purpose of pointing out its defects and impracti-
cability, u of recording a dUcorJery which belo114P to him, and paased beneath hia
hand in the same manner as the art of engraving, known to the ancients, and dee-
tined to give birth to tluU of PBIIITmo, passed beneath theirs,unappreciated by them,
until at last, meeting with Masso Finiguerra in 14511 the discovery waa coDeeerated
fOr e.er.
FEJllfAIGLil'S LOCALITIES.
111. We have already remarked that Feinaigle had concluded that mnemonic
perfection could only be attained by reunitioa the ideas of Simonidea, Metrodonw,
andGrey in one Bingle system. Coosequently,aeting under the inspirationoCthiBfirm
convietion, he formed a complementary system of loco!Uie~t, -which he describes in
the follomng manner. I Introduce it here, not so much to satisfy the curiosity of
the reader, as because it is essential to the better comprehending the immense 1upeo
riority and importanee of the system which the present work has for its subject.

"Theee figures are arranged from len to right, in the usual manner of writing ;
and for the more ealily remembering their situation, it will be found that iftwo lineal

decimal, or 40., will be over the fourth wall ; the fifih decima~ or 50, as its tenth
part exceeds the number of walls, will be assigned to the ceiling of the room, and

link between thiS room and the eecond.

" The learner should now exercise himself in finding the situation of the differ-
ent numbers in the two rooms. Where, "for example, are 29, 47, 35, 21, 62, 82, 991
etc. 1 The room must be first ascertained ; as to this there can be no difficulty, for
as 50 is the leaer number in the first room, all the numbers exceeding 50, and u
fur as 100, will be found in the second room.
" Havmg found the room, tbe lef\ hand figure will denote the tMll, and the right

ever is ludicrous, is calculated to make a strong impress1on u~n the mind, the
more ridiculous the association the better. Being provided With two rooms, we
will take the ftoor ofthe first room, and place something in each ofthe nine squares.

of ideu between them and the places ia most striking.

"The ideas of these images muat be eonnected together, and it will then be
almost impossible to forget the order in which they are aiTilllged. The first is an

finished smoking he calla for his night-cap, which will be found in the .i.xtA plnce;
before he retires to rest, he wishes for another tankard of ale; tankard occupies
the 6eoenth place. In the mornin,r when this man awakes, a boat is ready: to con-
Wif him to the ship; this boat is 1n the eighth place; a tree is found in the ninth

be taken promiscuously, and the connection made between them at the moment,

ftxiog certain objects in a regular order, that we may al-)18 know where to find
them. For this purpose the pupil should exercise himselfin the numerical situation
of the ditferent objects, and lie enabled to determine it quickly.

with the fac&s and datea which they were intended to imprint upon the memory."

which, continuing his explanation, Feinuigle proposes the following illustration:

ilhatrate hereafter.
l IJYIOOLICAL BQ111YJ.LEln'S.
''We have already learned to divide a room into parts, as the floor and walls,-
to IUbdivide theae into places,-to change figures into lettera,-and to form words;
and, by these me&DB, to remember ~~eries of figures or of things. It would be a ma-
terial advantage to us to have some fixed or certain rooms: we may take, for in-
stance, thoae with which we are best ~uainted, and fix the different pl4cu upoo
the Tario111 articles of furniture, as a chair, a chest of drawers, etc. What wehave
learned, hitherto, is notsufficient: as yet, an intellectual orderonly bas been obtained;
r&umben have been localized, but there isstilla deficiency-therealitia are wanting.
"If the reader has practiled our instructions in a room in which be isaccustom-
ed to spend the ~reater part of his time, and this room should have been hung with
pictures, eograv1n~ or plans, or ornamented with bust-, etc., he will have been
materially assisted m the remembmnce of his~\ or localitiee. We can, after a
little!ictice, ascertain the orderofdifferent thmgs .t"aced in a room which we have
long uented. The transition is slight, but the Impression will be permanent.-
Let111 fi the ~quares or places with eome pictures ofour own drawing ; the two
rooms will be then furnished, and it will be as easy to remember the symbole, or hi-
eroglyPhics, as to remember the situation or place ofany picture, or article oirumi-
ture Jn a room. Io.tead of having a carpet on the 8oor, we can suppote that the
ioor i1 inlaid or constructed of moaaie. This will allow u1 to putqmboZ. tllere.
"The outlines of the symbols are intet1ded to repnlii6Dt, as accurately: as possi-
ble, the various figures in the two roollll, so that they maybe permanently fixed in
the memory. The pupil can himat>lf draw, or caUII6 to be draw.n, the symbols men-
tioned below, (room•, ht and 2nd,) and these drawinp must be al'l'ailged accorcl-
iog to the numbers in cbe ICI.Uare& on pp. 250aod 251. (Vide No. 112.)
" And here we dismiss the pupil for a aeasoo, giving a gentle hint, that it will be
adri.able to make him~~elf perfectly familiar with the situations of the different
aymbol11, before he think• of looking into the next chapter. Until a knowledge of
theee aymbora be obtained, no further progress can be made in the system. It is, at
least, indispensably necessary, that the pupil should answer with facility to any
questions put to him re.pecting theJint room, containing fifty symbols; the second
room maybe acquired at leisure."

118. We will not follow Feinaigle any farther in his various applieatioll8 to Ge-
ography and to certain portions of Statistics, for it would be impoBIIible to do eo,
e<ren with the famous clew of Ariadne. Whatever is important to know will be
found in the preceeding pages. We will then end here these quotations from a sya-
tern which created so great a sensation on its appearance, and proceed now to the
examination of its real merits; for jt had its merits, notwithstanding its great ifttptr-
fectiont.

ayatem when oran,uplainecl,by reading the com-munications on thla subject, dated
at Paris, March 21, 1807, and in August of the same year; the first addressed to the -
"London PhUo.ophical Magazine," of June, by Mr. Fichtel, and the second to the
"London Monthly Magazine" of September. We see there that among his most
assiduous auditors, he numbered, among other eminent personages, the Conte de
Mettemieh, then amb818l1dor from Austria to the court of France, and all the seo-
retaries and attachU of the embassy. In London we see him giving, on the 22d of
June, 1811, before the Royallnt~titute, a public experiment of the r.f!icacy of his
method, and obtaining the unanimous applause of his d.istin~ished auditors; we
see him immediately after forming clal!ses, and giving complete satisfaction to all
the intelligent persons who attended his lectures. I say inteUigent persons, for as it 1
had before happened to Grey, and as it afterwards happened to Aime Paris, of '1
whom we shall soon speak, and as it will ever happen, it appears, to every thinking
man who would endow humanity with some benefit, of whatever kind, so all!o
Feinaigle met with his detractors, his envious vilifiers, and his cowardly calum-
niators. '
120. Yet, besides the jealous ana the ignorant, who envied his fortune and his
brilliarlt success, he also met with thinking conscientious men, who gave themselves
the trouble ofexamining his work and its intention~, before pronouncing judgment
both upon him and his system ; and their judgment based upon such principlu of
'investigation could be, consequently, nothing but favorable. Among the numerous
examinations ofhis work and his system, during the·course of his lectures and after
the publication of his book, we have especially remarked that in one of the most
dignified, talented, and best conducted periodicals in Great Britain, the " London
Quarterly Ref7iew." The March number of 1813, of this publication, contained a
special article of.fifteen ocla'DO page., entirelydevoted to the analytical and compar-
ative examination of the two systems of Feinaigle and Grey. The reader will per-
ceive, with pleasure, in every line of this critique, that its author is perfectly and
experimentally initiated into the knowledge of both systems, and he'will not be at
all astonished to perceive every where a respectful homage rendered to them anll
their authors. The most flattering exprcssio11s are prodigally bestowed upon their
genius, and the extreme ingenuity of their respective labors, and the sincerity ot
these eulogiums cannot be doubted, for with similar candor, the author of these
praises examines the numerous defects of both systems, and condemns whatever
appears to him reprehensible. But it is not alone in the Quarterly that we find
high testimonials of approbation in favor ofthese t1DO 8!J8temtl ofmnemonics, as we
willeoon ahow.

121. We have already seen with what re~~pect Cicero speab of Simoaiiel and
his system, altbongh it was yet so very far from every deeired perA!etion:
" Non mm tanto ego," says he, "ingenio qua11to 'I'IIemi8toclu .fuit, ut o6liwiMIW

122. And Chua in his turn speaks the celebrated Dr. PJiesay of the system of
Grey: "It is so easily learned, (meaning comparatively,) and may be of so mud&
liSe in recollecting datee, aod any other facts connected with figures, wlule no better
methods are at hand, that I think all persons of a liberal education INExcusABLE,
who will not take the small degree of pains that is necessary to make themselves
masters of it, or who think any thing mean or unworthy oftheir notice 1MicA v «~
useful and c:ommient.• ·
123. We see also, finally, what opinttm was entertained, respecting the sy.tem
of Feinaigle, by one of the greatest geniusetJ of France, one of' the most learned,
among the most distinguished, the illustrious astronomer Lalande. A man, we
might add, who yet belie'Ced in nothing, who denied every thing; who even openly
professed atheism, (if, however, it is possible for a man to be sincerely an atheist,)
and who, yet, did not forbear ackncnJJledging the utility of mnemonics, and paying
llis tribute of homage to a system which, at the best, had as many defects as it pos-
aessed intrirulic merits. What would he not then have said, and what, with him,
would have been the expressions ofHerodotus, Cicero, Priestly, and so many other
illustrious men, both ancient and modern, who have practiced and recommended
mnemonics, had they lived in "the halcyon days ofPhreno-Mnemotechny'l"
124. These are the words of Lalande upon the system and public lecture. or
Feinaigle:
"I have witnessed the extraordinary effects produced on the memory by the
method of M. de Feinaigle, and nothing appears to me more deserving of the seri-
ous attention ofany man oflearning. It is indeed an astonishing aid, in the study
ofGeography, Statistics, and History."t • • • •
125. Besides the emphatic testimony of these great minds, I might quote also a
great number ofothers, among whom are Hume, Bacon, and Locke, who, as every
body knows, framed a kin«l ofsystem for his own use, so deeply was he convinced
ofthe utJ.lity of artificial processes in aiding and assisting the memory. And the
great Addison, who in his famous "Dissertation on Medals," pays the most cate-
gorical bom~ge to Mnemonics. Aristotle himself did not think the subject unwor-
thy of his powerful genius, since he has written, say the authors, a work upon arti-
ficial memory entitled M·~l'·••m, now unfortunately loaL And Simonidea himself,
, was he inferior to these great men 1 Did he enjoy leBB ofconsideration in the esti-
mation of antiquity 1 No, surely,. for Plato calls him, with the greatest respect,
(ao.,~) "a wiseman," (de Rep. 1. p. 411.) Cicero, in speaking of him, says: "Non
poeta auavis, verum etiam creteroquin doctus sapiensque traditur." • • • • •
"He was the muter of Piudar," and "was held in high esteem at the Court of
Hiero L of Syracuse, who treated him as a friend," &c. And yet thia great man
deigned to devote hia life to mnemonics! • • •
126. Surely when such men as Sinaonidea, Herodotus, Cicero, Quiatilian, Pliny,
Locke, Baooo, Addilou, Prieadf, Hume, Lalande,Aristotle, and Byron, have judged .
the art of moemonica worthy of their attention, when these great geniuses have
deiped either to practise this art themselves, or to sanction its use by the weight
oftheir hip recommendation, and that too when they were only acquainted with
1heart in ill iofauoy, with what circomapeetion and care ought men of sense to
form their judgment upon a subject respected by such great minds. •

127. But certain parngraphists, to whom I need not more pnrtieular1y allude, will
laugh at deference to such authorities us we have quoted. WE, however, are con-
tent to focti(y our own eonvictione with the deliberate judgments of these men-the
sreatest who have ad11rned their respective ages-and who have seen in the 1!11·
PROVEJIENT OF TBB MEMORY, the surest means ofthe advancement of humanity.
126. Thus it is that moles, groping in the darkneBB of ignorance, and dictating
laws to reaon fTom die depths of their obscurity, believe thtlt they have convinced
the universe, because their limited intelligence will not allow them to rise to the
comprehension of thin¥8 intelligible even to children. Yet if such critics would
limit themselves to paasing their pedantic judgmenl8 upon thing1 only, without
entering into cowardly personalitiea, .• ••••••••••• But let us resume the course of
our illustratione.
129. Towards the beginning of the year 1818, there was, in a certain school, a
certain boy "remarkable in many respects.'' He learned, with extraordinary fa-
cility, all that was given him to atudy, provided, however, 1hose subjects of study
bad no conoection with number.r. He easily retained long fragments of prose ancl
poetry, especially of the descriptive kind, with the slightest efforts of attention ; but
whenever he was called upon to repeat his exerciEes in an"thmetie, ~ography, or
any other subject more or !eBB CQnnected with figures, he was always certain to
lose, on these points, whatever he had gained over his young comrades in othu
respects, in the hebdomedal distribution of placu. Thus he was almost always
one of the lowest on his benches. He knew almost all Virgil, Homer, Phmdrua,
and Xenophon, by heart, but he could not even retain in his memory the moat
remarkable and important dates of history. He could repeat nearly all of Rollin,
Crevier, and Lebau, without misstating a single one of the innumerable events of
those interminable histories, but to retain a single date, and to give it with conft.
dence and precision, was for him not only a very diflletllt nffair, but a thing almost
always impossible ; and finally, his memory for jigure11 was so bad, that be haA
oever been able to remember, with any degree of certainty, ewn die date of hie
own birth, an eplch a hundred times learned by him, and as oflen forgotten! Yet
his parents, like " the owls n of the fable, had conceived with respect to their
"young owlet" the mollt flattering hopes. Notwithstanding the long-eared cap
• with which he had been so often crowned for ~ia arithmetical incapacity, they had
decided to make of him an officer in the Royal navy. Now to become a naval
officer, it was absolutely neeest'8ry that be should first become a mathematician.
But how was mathematical intelligence to he foreed into a bead whleh eould not
retain the date of the battle of Thermopylm, or even become familiar wi1h that
of his birth 1 Surely, this was not the easiest problem in the wurld ; nevertbeleaa

86 INTRODUCTION.
First to make him acquainted with geography, which he had never been able
to learn at schoo~ they determined that it should be taught him in the TJery place•
described, while making a voyage around the world. A circumstance of the most
fortunate nature, and at the same time most rare, offered itself at this conjuncture,
and was immediately taken advantage or. An uncle of the young owl, then a
commander in the national navy, was just on the point of starting on a 11 flag-
cruise:" he consented to take with him the hopeful anti-mathematical nephew,
plus a special tutor destined to continue his education. The attentive tutor was not
long in perceiving the antipathy of his young pupi~ or rather the antipathy of his
tnemory for the study of figures. He imagined that by endeavoring to surround
this species of study with s:>me accessories less severe than the proper language
of numbers, he might, perhaps, succeed in reconciling the refractory memory of
the young man to figures. Consequently, at the very outset he proposed to him
the assistance of the litero-numeriealsystem of Feinaigle1 then still in all the vigor
of its renown.
It is useless, I thiDk, to tell the reader that the hero, then eo anti-mathematica~
of whom we have been speaking, W8JI no other than his very respectful servant,
the author.
130. I was no sooner initiated into the applir.alions of this system, than I per-
ceived at once the immense advantages that might be derived from it, if freed from
the clogs which seemed to me, in its first steps, to retard its progress. I was so
much taken with the iDgenuity of this changing of figures into words in order to
the remembering of numbers, that 1 did nothing else but mnemonize dates and
other facts connected with numbers, during the greater part of my hours of study,
and even of recreation. My ardor for this work became so great thnt my tutor
began soon to repent of his projeet, for 1 wholly neglected all my duties as a
scholar, for two principal things: first the rnnemonization of a crowd of historical
and statistical facts, whir.h I now burned with the desire of learning, and secondly,
that which occupied the greater part of my time, as well as the most active powers
of my young brain,-the continual research of means more. easy for simplifying
the difficulties which often appeared to me very embarrassing in the various appli-
eations of the system. Although then very young, I yet dared propose to myself
the problem of t.J:lis simplification, convinced that the thing was not impossible,
and that with perseverance it might be obtained.
131. I undertook the solution of the problem. I first commenced by rejecting
altogether the use of the localitiu of Feinaigle, however superior they appeared
to me, on a careful examination, to all those of the same kind which had preceded
them. Before embarking, my condescending tutor had, at my request, procured the
greatest number of works on mnemonics, which he could fiud; thus I could easily
compare the various systems upon a large scale, and perceive the superiority of
Feinaigle over all his predecessors. Yet, I repeat it, persuaded that there ought
to be, and that it would not be impossible to find some better means than that of
localities for the mnemonization of diacour~u, I rejel'ted without restriction the use
of this application, to reswne it one day, and devoted the whole of my attention
only to perfecting the litero-numerieal part of the system, which appeared to me
io be the most important poinL
It happened one day while analyzing the key ofDr. Grey, in a Latin version ot

bi8 "'Memoria Teclmiea," aBd eadeavoring to diiCOTet" whether claanoe alone lwl
euided him in his distriba.tion of the cona011anta to the figures, that I saw, as I have
remarked above, (No. sg) that the .aund or the jirtt letUr of the figures seemed
to have guided him in UW distribution, since he bad given t to lhree,f to four, • to
Gx, n to nine, and z. to zero.
133. I aaw that this means had completely failed him with respect to 7, 8, 51
and 1, but I perceived that he had undoubtedly enclea110red to bend and adapt his
idea to the figure two, and gave to it the letter d, for this reason alone, without
doubt, that d has "eTY nearly the same sound as t, by •oftening, however little, ita
pronunciation. It was impossible for me to refuse to Grey the honor of this primi-
tive idea, although he had not succeeded in applying it to any part, 11nd I immedi-
ately asked myself, since Feinaigle had associated together all the lettea having a
80nnd similar to Tt before the vowels a, o, u, such as c, g, q [see diagram, No.-100,]
(which considerably simplified the tranllation of the syllables containing these let-
ten into figures), why the same principle could not lte carried oat as sucoe.ufully
with respect to allletten ~ a rimilar .90Uncl, or very nearly 1110 1
· Tbe natural answer to this question was to leek immediately for the letters hav-
ing tbe same anal~ oftcnmd in their ~ion.
134. To obtain UU. r88Ult, it first appeared to me neceaaary to a4<Jpt some uni-
fbnn method in the appellation of all the letters except the vowels, and I punued
the following reaeoning to arrive at this result.
135. Why, Iasked myself, ahoold we call the coaaonanta
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
M ifthey were writlen with the vowel t after them, like
be, ce, de, ge, pe, te, ,e, ze,
while f, I, m, n, s, and'x, are pronounced with the vowel e bifore them, as
if, e~ em, en, e., and e:D
Why not call them all in one homogeneous way, and pronounce the latter on the
same principle with the former:
je, le, vu, ru, se, and :De1
and why not say upon the same principle, for k, q, r and j,
ke, que, re and je,
instead of
kay, qu, ar, and jay 'l
136. I had no sooner adopted this priDciple so oatoral, and I may even say with
reaso~~; so pMlollophica~ than the poaaibility of fiwling thole ai.milaritie8 of ~
wboee fundamental exiatenee I bad already supec&ed betweencertain leUera ofthe

permitted me to take towards the simplification ofthe KeyofFemo.igle. There wu

138. And there ie .at1 more room for utonishment at this mistake on the part oC
Feioaigle, since he had already IQ bappjly united uadn- mae fipre, 7, all the OOD-
IIOilant. having theeame eound, before a, o, and u. To what mllllt we attribute thi1
llJp.u attentionu 1 Undoubtedly u. one single thing, namely, to the ioeoavenieot.
and unphilosophical method of calling the eOIISOilaots by their BDCien1 namea, in-
ltead of submiltiog them, aa I had conceived the happy idea of doing, to one uni-
form rule of proouociation.
139. lfFeinaigle had thought to callfan'h Fe and Ve, instead ofeF and Ve,
he coald not, certainly, have failed to place these two consonants together as equiv-
alents to the figure 8, since the identity oftheir pronunciation could not then have
wled to strike his ear.
140. In fact, whoever will attempt to pronounce flike like eF, and then "like
Ve, will see that oo idea ofa ltrikiag analogy will be conceived as existing between
«beae two letters. But as soon as the reader shall have pronounced Fe aod Ve, he
will at once be atruck with the identity of the pronunciation now existing between
them. The ease il also aimilar with respeet to Pe and Be; and indeed I still won-
der how thia striking identity ofsound could have escaped Feinaigle, since he had
moet evidently united K, Q, 0 and Chard uoder 7, by the teat ofhearing!
141. However, the reader will have peroeived, in the precediog diagram, that
dle figure 6 remains without an equivalent. Feinaigle having given z to the
figure zero, on the only analogy of the slight hiiiSiDgaound which z rootaine, on an·

142. According &o the distribution which I have made oflhe various collBODaatll
having a similar aound, alway• conformin~ to \he primitive plan of Feinaigle, 6
then remains without an equivalent, since I have tal«en the d which Feinaigle had so

AIMB PAIIIS,
14.7. In the coune ofthe year 1822, neady three years had already elapsed since
my p«agian tutor had initiated me into the doctrines of Feinaigle. While endeav~ ,'
oriog to briag to perfeotion his beautiful idea, I had by turns visited India, Arabia,
Chin8, aod South America ; that ill to say, aU the principal sea-ports upon the coasts
of these various countries. I had tasted the "ambrosia of Constance," and bunted
the Mricau ostr¥:h at the Cape of Good Hope; breathed the perfumes of the in-
ce.oae upon the burning 110il of Yemen ; enjoyed the nectar of the coffee upon the
laDdy plain& of Mocha; eaten the dates of Arabia ill the tented streets of Muscat:
languidly pillowed my head upon the downy carpets of Teheran in the kiosks ot
Bauora, while inhaling the rosy attar of the harems beneath the shade of its per-
fumed acaciu; admired the Asiatic splendors of Surat, Bombay, and Calcutta;
bunted the hydroeorax and the paraqnet through the forests of Malabar and Coro-
mandel ; mtended the sacrifice of the Hindostan widow upon the funeral pile ofher

Ganges; luxuriated in the gaudy palanquin of the rayRhs of Aracan; gathered the
apices of the Moluccas in the perfumed groves ofSumatra ; drank the tea ofthe Celea-

dances of the voluptuous Iberia; and at laat yisited again the Penates which I had.
quitted three years before, and which I was soon again to leave to encounter suc-
ceasively the ices of the two poles, before visiting, in still happier days of my wan-
dering existence, the ruins of Carthage and the Col081eum; the antique moeque of
St. Sophia; the tamulus of Achillea, of Ajax, and of Patroclus; the column of
Pompey ; the Pyramids of Cairo; the remnants of Pereepolis; the ruins of Pal·
myra; the humble tomb of Christ; the palaces of Montezuma; the majestic ruioa
of Quito, of UxmaJ, and Palenque; until the time when, guided by a benevolent
Providence, l came to bum my roving wings in this focus of the future liberty of thiJ
world, while awaiting the destined hour when at last, freed from its mortal envelope,
my spirit, taking its last flight, shall depart on ita eternal voyage. I eame back, then,
aal have said, from this splendid tour loaded not only with precious souvenirs ol the
TOyage, bot with my memory enriched with a multitude ofjadll in statistics, geogra--
phy, hiatory, and the mathematiea, which I had been fortunate enough to master
during my long pilgrimaee by the assistance of my key, modified from the funda·
mental basis of Feinaigle. The frigate in which 1 had made this jim campaigta
about the world was laid up in the port of Roehfort, and I soon after arrived at the
city of Nantes, where my relatives were then residing
148. While reading one day the morning journals, I saw with an agreeable sur·
prise the notice of a "public lecture 'IDilh mnemotechnic experiment,, by Mr. Aiml
Paris," announced for three oftheajteTTIOOn, in the great hall of the Commercial Ex·
change. The Professor promised to answer to 25,000 questions from history, geog·
raphy, statistics, mathematics, astronomy, &c., &c., to prove the power and efficacy
of the "new mnemotechnic method," which he proposed to teach in that city. As
the reader will have already imagined, 1 was not among the last to answer to this
call. A long time before the appointed hour the great hall of the Exchange was
thronged with many thousands ofauditors awaiting the arrival ofthe Professor with
the most lively impatience; for the renown ofhis mnemotechnic exploits had already
every where preceded him. They had been led to expect wonders, yet however
greo.t were their hopes, they were destined to be I!Urpassed. ln fact, at the precise
hour which had been announced, Aim~ Paris mounted the platform which had been
prepared for him, amid thunders of applause, which continued to welcome him for
several minutes. A shower of little printed leaves containing thousands of ques--
tions upon variouaacientific and literary subjects which he had engaged to answer,

.liM& PARIS. 91
Was scattered among the immense, compact, and impatient crowd which thronged
about him ; then, immediately that he had pronounced the lut words of an appro.
priate discourse having memory and his system for its subject, at his invitation han•
dreds of questions, starting at once from all parts of this imme1111e hall, thllDdered
upon him like the rolling of a hundred drumB.
149. I will not attempt to describe the enthusiasm which presided over the im-
mense audience during the whole course of these experiments, for the task would
be above all descriptive power. Those only who have attended my public intro-
ductory lectures in this country, and who win read these lines, can form any idea or
the scene which I abstain from describing here, for want of proper expreasions.-
Suffice it to say, that out of the thousands of questions, of all kinds, which were
addressed to the illustrious professor during three whole houl'8 occupied by the ex-
periments of this memorable.lecture,. he did not commit the slightest error in hie
hurried answers, and thnt amid even the enthusiastic plaudits of his numerous au-
ditors. A subscription list presented for their signatures for the formation ofa claaa,
waa immediately covered with hundreds of names,-among which mine did not fail
to take its place, as the reader may well suppose; for who more than I could have
desired to learn the process employed by Aime Paris to acquire a memory for .fat:"
10 prodigious as that of which he had just given such a remarkable example 1 A
second thought made me still more desire to understand his system,-that of com-·
paring its power with the bases of the one which, thanks to the happy genius of
Feinaigle, I had learned; and I was, surely, very far from suspecting that the sys-
• tern of Paris had the slightest resemblance to that of the illustrious German ; for
not only had the name ofthis latter been wholly passed by in silence by Aim~ Paris,
hut he has never, even as yet, that I know of, honored him, either in his oral lec-
tures or in his printed works, by giving him credit for the slighteat particular of the
ll)'stem which he, Paris, has taught, or published under his name in four or five dif-
ferent workB.
150. And yet, as the reader will herenfter have occasion to see, not only thefim-
da,~al basis of Paris, but almost the whole of his "principles and t:ariOUBapplica-
tions'' belong, body and soul, to the ingenius and illustrious Feinaigle, whence he had
derived them through the thick fog that obscures them in the book of the latter, with
only two variations, which I shall soon have the pleasure of pointing out, although
1hey must surpass in telal all the fortunate success which I myselfhave already been
80 happy aa to obtain in my simplification of the fundamental basis of Feinalgle.
151. Indeed, the reader may easily imagine the surprise, mingled at the same
time with pleasure, and, I candidly own it, a little of jealfJ118Y, which I felt when in
the first lealon of Aime Paria, I saw him unroll before 1he eyes of the audiloly, u
the fundamental basil of hu system, the following diagram :

152. Thus, as the reader will perceive, the only radical difference, but one ez..
trtmely impc1rlatat1which existed between this fundamental blllris and mine, is that
1he number 6, to which I had given the double con80nant Xe, Aim6 Paris, more
fortunate than I in hie resev.rches upon the simplification of the key of Fcinaigle,
Digitized by Coogle
IRTaODUCTlO.ff,
llad allotted the double letter CHe1 and the consonant Je or Ge, whieh had entirely
· uca~ me, and whose absence rendered my basis positively incomplete. He gave
tben the CH or CHe, and those letters similar to it in pronunciation, Je and Ge, to
1he figure 6, and thus rendered by this single addition the fundamental basis or
Feinaigle perfect.
153. This wu not yet all. lllstead of calling the letters by the name of conso-.
tsam. and vowels, as 1had hitherto done, he called the consonants by the name of
arliculatiou, and the vowels by that of IOUnd8, which rendered it poa;ible, as will
he hereafter seen, to decompose in a much more easy, certain, and sdentific man-
Der, the mrumonic 1DOTd8 formed with the figures.
154. Finally, to complete the titles of Aime Paris to the eternal gratitude of the
uept ia mnemotechny, he systematized, in a manner altogether scientific, the table
qf nomenclature of Feinaigle; gave, in the first place, an extremely ingenious
means of mnemonizing the 155 figures of the ratio of the circumference to the di-
ameter of the circle; a very skillful method of the mnemonization of the calendar;
and various applications of minor importance, though wholly ingenious, whieh I
llhall mention in the course of lessons which follow. But be was most unfortunate
in yielding wholly to the impracticable localitier of the ancients, like Feinaigle, and
carrying his error even lo the mnemonization of the entire code of French laws
upon this false principle, taking almost all the public edifices of Paris, as well as the
streets, the public places, and even the houses, for the bases of his localities.
155. As to the discoveries which belong properly to myself, as well in the appli-
cation ofthe method as in the principle~~ derived from the fundamental busis, I shall •
distinguish them hereafter, while p'>ioting out 8\lCCessively in their proper places
those IDEAS which l owe to Feinaigle and Aime Paris, in the composition of the
system which this book has for its subject.
156. For the origin ofmy"Phreno-Mnemotechnic Dictionary," I refer the reader
to the Preface ofthat work.
157. Nevertheless, before entering into the u-position of the "Principles and
Various Application~" ofMY system, I think it proper to explain in a few words the
real<lfl8 which_ give me a perfect and unquestionable right to qualify the present
system as llo'IINB,-whatever may be my obligations in other respects to Feinaigle
and Paris, but especially to Feinaigle; for, as I shall hereafter have occasion to
ehow distinctly to the reader, it ie to Feinaigle alone that Parle wes, with some few
exceptions, aa well aa myaelf, all the IDEAS upon which he has based Ius system for
the French language, as I have done mine for the English.
OF MY SYSTEM, AND ITS APPLICATION 1'0 TRJ! ENGLISH LANGUAOR.
158. Before entering upon the explanations which follow, I will reunite the dif-
ferent bases, which, from the time of the suggestions of Bishop Beveridge till Aim6
Paris, gave birth to my actual fundamental basis for the English language. Thus
brought together, the reader who will f<•llow the progress which I have marked out
iiJ thece diflerent bases, will be able more easily to form an idea of their different
degrees of perfection, and of the respective merits of each author in thQse works to
which each OIU! has special r~hts.

1 159. By this single ay~ expNiUon, tbe reader eoaverant with the wp-
tem has already perceived the enormous difference which moat em between the
fundamental basis, and the principles of the applications of Aim~ Paris, adapted
only to the Frendt language, and the balis as well as the principle~~ by which the
system mU.t agree or conform to the Englislt. ~e.
160. The basis of Paris, as it is, cannot be adapted, in fact, to any language
but the French; it is wholly.and altogether according to the genius or that lan-
guage, whose homogeneity in the rules of its pronunciation, permits a great sim-
plicity in the arrangement of the basis.
161. Bat in the English language, the 8lUlle letters being subject to very differ--
ent prommciatioos, according as they are placed before such or I!Uoh vowels or
consonantto, as is proved by X, in my fundamental buis, and by the words pWugA,
TOUgh, cough, drought, draught, caught, ought, which are pronounced aa if they
were written, pl01D1 t-uff, tXJff, drotDt, draft, caut, aut,-it is absolutely necessary
that there should be a spect.al adaptation of the basis to this latter tongue, and
entirely accarding to its genius. But it Willi necessary, besides, that he who should
undertake this task should be perfectly master of the French and English Jan.
guages, that he should understand, to the foundation, the gefliw of these two
tongues, and that he should be imbued, ex profeuo, with the mechanism, under-
standing, and philosophical genius of all that Feinaigle, Paris, and myself bad
conceived or written upon the litero-numerical key of Grey; above all there waa
requisite an intimate familiarity with the philological value of each word of the
language, to be able to adapt them to the homophonic analogie., (one of the IDOit
important and powerful applications of the method, aa will be seen hereafter,) for, •
as will be presently demonstrated, it would be as impossible to translate the system
of Aim~ Paris from the French to the English language, u it would be to extracl
an atom of honesty or decency from the joint bodies, brains, and shallow minds ol
those eontemptible individuals who once dared, with the hope of pilfering with
' impunity ihe fruits of my labors, to speak ofplagiarism concerning my syatem and
that of Paris.
162. And in fact, when, after a lapse of eighteen yean, during which time I hat!
never ceased practising, for my own advantage, the system I had formed upon. the
beautiful Idea of Feinaigle, and the combined discoveries of Paris and myself-
when, I say, after a number ofyears, during which period I had passed over almoet
every portion ofthe globe, always moemonizing-a benevolent Providence inspired
me with the happy idea of eomiog to add my humble stone to tb,e edifice of the
brilliantfuture, which the prerent of this blessed land promises to all humanity, I
was not at all astonished at discovering, after some inquiries, that the system ot
Paris, which had been taught with such brilliant telal, throughout all France, and
published, besides, in four or five suceessive editions by Paris himself, had not yet
been, I will not say translated, sioee the thing is impossible, but imitated, or tra,.._
• .[wed into the EngU.h language ; for as I have said, or very uearly so, the union
of too many circumstances in on~ individaal was requisite, for the thiflg to have
been done so soon.
163. It was necellllli'Y, in fact, that the person who should have this happy idea,
ahoald, in tho first plaee, be profoundly versed in the geniu of both the French
anci English languages, that he might, first, be deeply penetrated with the true

f4ith of a marcyr in the fMt'al value and material IUc:c:esa of hie work, joined to a
patienee and a c:oostaDey beyond all proof,-oJ', ftnaHy, it was nec:esaary that he
should have.{ritftel. either to eneourage ot' aasist him, &e., &c.
1157. But, the reader will agree, that without adding many other collateral re-
quisite items, whictll omit through economy of time, surely these requisites were
80flcient to preclude or at least coneiderably to retard the appearance of the eye-
• terR which this hoek baa for ita eabject.
168. Well then, laying aside all false modesty, I will confesa, that, when, some
weeks after my arrival in this counll'y, in 1840, I learned that the Eflglit;h language
did not poa86811 even a shadow of a system, comparable with that whleh I had
eonetrueted ;with so much IIJCCtl88 for my own Ul!e ; when I was convinced that
Paris was not even known by name, or mentioned in a single one of the numerous
articles upon mnemonics, contained in all the encyelopmdieal dictionaries which
mentioned this art; when I saw that Feinaigle himself was almost wltolly unhwtDn,
and that Grey alOfle was 1moam, mentioned and taught in the schools both in
England and America; when I thought of the immense ·advantages which I had
hitherto derived from my mnemotechnic discoveries, and of the brilliant su~
whieh not only Paris, who had taught a nearly perfect aystem, had acquired, bot
which Feinaiele had obtained, who had taught a system not only imperfeet, but
almost wholly Impracticable; when, after having reflected upon· all these things, I
fook the firm re!Oiution of giving some mark of my utility to the community which
had extended to me the national hospitality which Thad come to seek, and decided
to introduce, with th.ia intention, for the profit of the rising generation, that system
whirh the intelleetnal portion of the pnblic has ainee welcomed with such "Warm
npplause,-sueh POSITIVE encouragement8; when I formed this resolution, I say, in
1St0, it was but a ft:ID day8 since I had learned the .first v;urth of the Engliih 1-.
gwtg~', which an indispensable necessity bad eonetrained me to acquire, in haste,
that I might be understood by those to whom I was to address myself in the expla-
.nation or the proeetalell of the wonderful discovery which I was about to introdute
upon this c:6nlin6!'t. • : • And yet 1 did not !brink belbre dlis gigantic project.

were strangers to me-persons who had never even heard me, in public or privat.e1
and I am eure their proceedings were in the end as ineffective as they were scanda-
lous. Yet for a time, it must be eonf811ed, they were productive of onhappy eooae-
quellC88, not the least ofwhich, to me, was the discovery ofthe uooertainty ofedil.oriDl
opinkm and applause. Men who had scarcely mastery of language, seemingly, to

171. Yet 1he system, nevertheleaa, was destined to triumph. It was my hapPf
·fortune to find eoemiee more poeroua than my friends. Gentlemen who bad dou

act ofjustice to him, to investigate the truth ofthis serious imputation upon his character ; Blld

Here follows an elaborate examination of the works referred to, proving the ~
aurdity o.nd malice of this foul charge, and concluding thua:
"These facts have been established by a careful examination of the works placed in our
hands by Prof. Gouraud: in consequence of them, aod as an act of justice to our former
teacher, we have unanimously adopted the following resolutions.
"Ruoked, That after a close and candid inquiry, we believe that the charge recently brougbt
against Prof. Gouraud, of having taken, without due acknowledgment, hie system of Jluemo-
techny from the French of M. Paris, is utterly unfounded 81ld Wljust.
"Ruolwd, That In our opinion the gentlemen who have allowed their namea to be need
In support of this serious charge againat Prof. Goursud, have done so hastily,-without due
examination, aod after hearing only one &ide-and that a careful inquiry would lead them to a
conclualon entirely different.
"R~ed, That the acknowledgments of his obligntiona to other writers, made Yoluntarlly
and repeatedly by Prof. Goursud, are broad and decisive enough to cover even more Indebted-
nee& than he has actually Incurred, and that they evince a desire on his pan to act with the
most perfect good faith towards all other writers upon the subject.
"Ruol~od., That ths only eascntial part of the system which Prof. Gouraud has borrowed
from others, is the first part of the first fundamental basis, for which both Parisaod hlm10lfare
indebted to F'elnalgle; and that its development and application In the Englbh language by
Prof. G. are entirely original, and exceedingly ingeniou, beautiful, and ulleful.

EXPOSITION, EXPLANATION, AND ANALYSIS,
OF Til&
FIRST FUND.AMEN"I'A.L BASIS.
PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
L.u>IEB .A.ND GENTLBIIBN:
IN our first dissertation• upon the subject which re-a~~~embles os within tbele
walls, I spoke somewhat in detail of the origin, the progrea~, the importance,
etc., of the Mnemonic art. J remarked, with as much precision as was per-
mitted by the brief time (two hours and a half), which we could devote to
this subject, among so many other things claiming our attention-1 remarked,
I say, in what manner this art had been esteemed by some of the IJlOit
profound geniuses who had honored humanity ; and bow imperfect, never-
thele-, were the systems which had merited their high commendation: I
showed you how those wholly u:bitrary systems of localitiw, e~c., had been
surpassed by the litero-nuTMrical system mvented by Dr. Grey, upon an inci-
dental remark of the learned Bishop Beveridge ; then rendered a little more
intelligible by the illustrious Feinagle, who yet never suspected, anJt. more
than Grey, the treasure which he unconsciously held in his power; and how
6nally having been conaidered with a little more attention by Aim~ Pari1, and
by myself, this veritable golden Key of Mnemonics (the fundamental basis of
the lilero-numerical system), bad been, at Iut, carried to ita highest degree of
perfection.
I have touched, I say, upon these various subjects, inasmuch as it was ne-
cessary to prepare you for the new language which we shall use in the couree
of the illustrations which follow, and especially that you might understand
that a subject which could thoughtfully occupy such minds as those of Cicero,
Quintilian, Locke, Priestly, and a hundred other geniuses of equal merit, if
not equal renown, whom I could quote, ought also to have some claims upon
your kind attention. And it is not wholly without necep.ity that I make this
indirect appeal to your kindne1111, although I have so much reuon to rely upon

it, if I may judge, at leaat, by the telltimonials of that friendly confidence with
which you have hitherto honored me (applause).
It is very true that the triumphant prooj1 which I han given you, in my
public experimental lecture, of the "unlimited," "phenomenal," "Hercu·
Jean," power (to use your own expressions) of the system which I propose to
teach you, have sufficiently convinced you that there is, at the founda·
tion, something real in the processes, whatever they may be, which have en·
abled fifteen ditrerent persons to perform those prodigious feats of strength of
memory which were executed by them..in your presence. Yet, w:batever may
be your kind disposition towards me, and whatever may be the grounds of
web a disposition, I have reasons to suppose that the absolute unanimity has
not yet been obtained which I would wish, on your part, to enable me to con·
tinue without hesitation, and I could not avoid making this appeal to
your kind attention. And, in fact, penetrated myself with that unfavorable
idea which is still associated with the word "Mnemonics," which a multitude
of persons place "sans fayon," in the same rank as the words "Animal Mag·
netiam," and othen of equal unpopularity, I am not at all astonished at the
hesitation with which certain members have joined my ditrerent classes. As,
for instance,-} was present at my office, this morning, when a member pre·
~~ented himself to subscribe before the final close of the subscription list. He
had waited until the last moment, he said, that be might well mature his
thoughts; but 11eeing already two thousand signatures enrolled,·he bad finally
said to hims£'lf, thAt if he should be disappointed in his hopes, despite all the
marvels which he had witnessed at the public lecture of the "fascinating Pro·
fe8110r,"-I use his own expreiiSiOn!l-(burata of ltilarity) he would at least have
this consolation, " that his disappointment, sl1ared between two thousand vic-
tims like himself, 1rould appear to him so much the less;" (hilarity) then,
"tvitbout attempting an explanation of this arithmetical figure, and addressing
my clerk, "How much for the ticket, do you say 1" "Frve dollars, sir."
"Five dollars!'' "Yes sir, five dollars.'' And then, gently scratching his
ear, drawing slowly out of his pocket-book a five-tlollar bill, and banding·it
over, with a graceful rounding motion of the arm, '' \Veil, sir," continued he,
with a tone of the most philosophical cast, "Well, sir, whether it be wholly
a humbug or not, I'll go it! Here is the glorious cash-I'll go it the whole
figure now! (prolongtd and animated laughter).
I repeat it, ladies and gentlemen, that I am not in the least surprised at this
uncertainty yet prevailing in many mindP, perhaps, as to the real merit~
of the system; the world, I know, is daily besiegPd by a multitudf' of prdenu-
ers and pretensions, having no more claim~ upon the attention and patronage
of the public than connection oftf:'n wifh et•en common·seqBe. But I know,
also, that there are to be found a certain class of persons, always re;;<ly
to criticise, censure and condemn any thing that meets with too much faYor
or suceeas before the public ; some through mere mania of opposition; some

through uneasinl'ss of mind j others through jealousy; and others without any
reason at all. This allowance must be readily made by any man who addrenea
himself to the public, for such are the workings of the human mind. I shaH
not, therefore, be surprised, not only to bear auch doubts expressed, as to the
character of the system before ita appearance, but even to see it coodemn~
cfter it shall have proved itself, no matter bow powerful, trne, and efficaciou.
i'n its applications, and to hear it also called 11 humbug, NOTWITBSTAl!IDIN•
(,.gns of negation). But for these things I am fully prepared, and for many
others beside. As there is in all pictures, however dark, a due proportion of
light, so, if the system should meet with its Pyrrho-nay, with itl Bavius ancl
Zoilus--1 have this anticipated conviction, that it will also have its judicious
Aristatehus (approbation). Yes, I am as firmly convinced of this latter asser--
tion, as I am confident that it will havE! its detractors, and its prodigal bestow--
era of the appellation" humbug". How, indeed, could this be otherwiset-
Has there ever been a single truth, however palpable and evident, launched
fOrth into the world for the benefit of mankind, that was not, at first, treated
with contempt, laughed at, batHed, and even honored with the persecutions
of martyrdom 1 If I may be permitted to compare the amallest thing with
the greatest on record in the annals of mankind, look at the holiest of boob,
the most sublime of all truths-the Gospel-has not this divine code of morals,
wiadom, truth, been pouring floods of its vivifying light upon the world
for twenty centuries t And yet how many-1 will not say iadividual8, but
populous nations, are there denying still its truth, and boldly pronouncing it a
humlnlg 7 (tkep -attentiOn). In proof of this assertion, tum your attention
towards Asia, the very cradle of Christianity ; interrogate Persia, China, the
whole of Eastern India, Tartary, Arabia, Africa, from Alexandria to Tangiers,
and Turkey, but especially this latter"country, and see in what manner they
there yet treat the Gospel, and the Christians whom Grace has touched and
aubdued to its truth!
But to use exampleslt'BB d'"rllicult to touch upon, and mare submissiTe to the
?eqttisitions of language~ let us draw our illustrations from scientific history.
Look at Copernicus : he holds in his power one of the most sublime truths,
and yet he waits for the day, the very moment ~en, of his death• to be81ow
it upon humanity ; for not only did he foresee that his brilliant discovery of the
true system of the nnivene would be ridiculed and ltigmatized with the hideous
epithet of Atmhg by tbe envious and the conceited wags of the day, but he
was also well assured that the hemlock of Socrates would be ground for him ·
by the Anytuses of the epoch, for having dared tl\ dignify humanity by one
~the most brilliant conquests of the human mind (applatUe).
Look at Galileo: With ~ grand lead"mg truth of Copernicus in one hand,
and in tlu• other his own telescope, he tkmotUtratu the sidereal motion of the
earth-and yet he is not only branded with the aame of A~ by those e~
vioua of hia reoowo, but Jte it, .~ il ptntnllllld fer ._ ..;.pAc _,

religioua heresy ; pel'leCilted, D.otwithsta.Dding his great age, and his title to the
respect and admiration of DllUlkind, and obliged, finally, to recoyer his liberty,
to &1Utar that the earth was immoveahle • • • • • while lhe, quivering with in-
dignation,• 1lew around the sun carrying his persecutors through space at the
rate of nineteen miles for each one of the profane syllables that denied hel"
motion! (loud applause).
Look at Harvey: he proved the fact of the circulation of the blood-a dia-
covery as characteristic of the hUDl&D mind, as it was pathologically useful-
and immediately all the Faculties of Medicine, and all the coatemporary phy-
licians raised together api.ost him, with auger and disdain, the cry of hvlllhvg
-and yet the very choler with which they were chafing, and mthe ex.c•
ol which Uaey poured torrents of abuae, by wortls or iD. writing, upon their
illustrious rival, was caused by the afiluence of their own circulating blood
llowards their hollow brains ! (mirthful applav8e).
Look at Columbus : his mighty genius revealed to him the existence of a
world-he tells it, and is ridiculed, scoffed at, and treated aa a dreamer; be
offers it to several monarcba-he is himself stigmatized as a hvahwg! Yet
listened to fiD.ally by a fling and a queen who are willing to venture upon the
practical examination of his idw, he leaves the coast of the poetic Iberia;
aalutes, in passing, with a sardonic smile the banks of the Tagus, where bill
first thoughta had been disdained ; traverses the ocean in all ita broad expan~e f
obtains a whole world, kneaded with gold and with diamonds, which he pre-.
aents to his patro.ns, the monarcha of Castilia and Arragon ; aod receive~ .t
lest, as his recompense • • • • • • • a set of iron chams, which he was de.
tined to carry to his tomb, aa an eternal monument of the gratitude of bia
contemporaries, and-(interruptive applawe).
Finally1 look at the great Fulton : be holds in his mighty hand the mape
wand which must 10011 annihilate all distance, and bind in the cloaeat liDb
worlds, empires, nations, men.
·He speaks of thia irresistible truth, and those who bear him fint laugh at
him, and then call hia acheme a hu.bvg! A mighty genius staD.ds Titan-like
upon the ww-ld, which he inundates with 1looda of glory aod of gore :
. the crowns which wreath his head are hidden by the clouds; he holds in hia
hand an adamantine sceptre, which threateDI to sway all the empires of tbe
P..arth ; ru. feet trample upon the heads of many a prostrate king ; at the
flashes of indomitable genius which, like the lightD.ingl of heaveD., dart flOIIl
sod-like eyes, proud Albion shrinb and tremblea, yet she kneels not! Fultoa
quits her shores, and, swimming through the 1lood of glory, which, at the ti~
inundated France, pouring from beneath tbe ilJ1.116l'ial throne, he reaches Lw-
Ce#a, presents his mighty scheme to the god-like colossus, and-Napoleon
himaelf, whose eagle eye could penetrate into all depths, and au, where to anr

other mortal eyes aothin3 waa Mble-Napoleon, disdaining the key of uni-
versal dominion, of the ocean and the earth, offered him by Fulton, shook his
head with incredulity at this confident offer, treated his scheme as "chimeri-
cal and wild," and lost, thereby, with the undivided sceptre, whose possesaion
had been the dream of his dream-like existence, the share of gratitude which
hjs country would have added to the glowing diadem now crowning his ever·
luting memory • • • • had be listened lesa disdainfully to the orad~ ofgenius!
(wrm applawH).
Disappointed in his attempt, b1.1t not discouraged, with hisbrows wrinkled with
mournful indignation, Fulton leaves France in.,.all haste, cr091es the broad
Atlantic, and coJm>s to oft'er to his own native land the palm ofglory which the
demi-god-favorite son of Victory-bad spumed from the height of his proud
pre-eminence. But "no one being a prophet in his own country," Fulton wu
100n to meet with perhaps moze heart-breaking disappointments. He was to
be most unmercifully meered at by his own countrymen ; some called him a
Yisionary, a lunatic, a dreamer; others, leu civil and more abrupt, applied to
him at once the great all-answering epithet, the favorite stigma, 10 readily
handled by every •yltematic opponent of every man or every thing extraordi-
nary, and pronounced him, unhesitatingly, " a confouatkd humbug !" Yet,
a d.iamonda are sometime• found among unoltentatious pebbles, he found at
last some humble friends, who, though skeptical, consented secretly to asmt
hUn in the demonstration of the mighty scheme, over which his powerful
pni.us had l!een so long brooding.
Finally, the fir• ntam~Joal ltarted from the New York Battery, guided by
Fulton him~elf. An immense crowd throngs the wharves, the d~cks, and the
rigging of the hundred veuels which lie along the shore•. The wheels begin
1lowly to move; jets of a snow-like steam puff with a s~ge noise from a
long pipe; clouds of black smoke rush forth from a wide chimney, and the
vessel, unaided by either sails or oars," walks the waters like a thing of life,"
furrowing its liquid way amid the loud hurras of an enthusiastic population;
and glides along upon the sparkling waters of the Hudson, coughing
aml!.Zingly, like an asthmatic whale! (prolonged laugluer, and loud appltsule).
Glorioua period, indeed ! and worthy in every respect to be recorded in incor-
rodable golden letters in this "temple of memory" (loud cheering). At last
tbe·1/fall&botu reachea Albany ! Thousands of i.Ddividuals had tDitnu1ed her
DW'VelloUB ascension of the Hudson, which proudly opened its bubblinc
boeom to her careBBing keel (applatue). A harbinger of heavenly tidings, of
earthly renovations, symbolical labarum of civilization, and of indescribable
blessings to. mankind, in days not far distant-quite nigh at hand ; she had
passed before them, by day, like the column of smoke before the wondering
eyes of Israel ; like the pillar of fire by night; the friends of Fulton them-
selves, who had accompanied him, had witnessed still nearer the 1UCCUI oC
thiJ marvellous expedition-and yet, you r~ it all, they still per~everecl,

NOTWITHSTANDING, in declaring Fulton's great discovery a 1Ji8ionarg ICMme,
destined Jlever to 8Ueceed; while the injudicious trumpets of malignant depre-
cators continued to resound afar and around him, with the scarifying word
humbug! humbug!! (murmura of a&sent).
But let us look around us, and see what baa become ofFulton's" confounded

other atreaJnS, which, like arteries and veins of this mighty continent, carry

boats circulating in every direction !
What do we see upon all its majestic lakes, along its winding coasts, and
upon all the seas, over which float the flags of all the civilized nations of the
world 1 Fleets of rapid steamboats I Let us cast our eyes upon the most dis-
tant extremities of the globe-from the Columbia river to the sacred waters of
the Ganges-from Edinburgh to Tahiti, and from Gibraltar to the Chinese
teas-what do we see 1 .•..• Swift and gaudy steamboats pouring among
the nations of the world the products of industry, the arts and the sciences,
and the blessings of the Gospel, from the magic cornucopia of civilization I
And to whose genius is mankind indebted for all these wondrous blesaiogs 1
Is it not to that illustrious compatriot of Franklin, Rittenhouse, Whitney, and
Morsed-Robert Fulton, oF AMERICA~ (continued applauae).
But let us seek the place where the .gratitude of mankind has erected, to
the genius of the great Fulton, a monument commemorative of his immortal
discovery, that we may together render him there the loud tribute of homage
and admiration, sovereignly due to his happy genius • • • Where ia it to be

outlines upon the azure of the sky; it stands upon the road of Bologna which

tire altitude of both the statue and the base is one hundred and tlewn feet !I
Let us approach this gigantic monument. It has, doubtless, been erected to
commemorate some wonderful event in the life of some great benefactor of

Now, ladies and gentlemen, if men of such real merits-if deeds of such
intrinsic value and incalculable benefits to mankind, have encountered such
difficulties in making their way through the sneers of their contemporaries,
and the unjust epithets of humbug-if the Holy Gospel itself, a subject
divine amoug the most divine, baa not etea}lf'd skepticism, and th~ sneers and
outrages of men, how can I expect-1, the shadow of a shade-that my wordJ
will be listeDed to by all men without contradiction ; and that the system,
which I propose to teach to you, will be more respectfully treated than fl.
Gospel has been by whole generations of men I . . .
But you will say, what has the Gospel to do with all this 1-why not enter
at once into the system 1 • • • •
Your remark, ladies and gentlemen, would be entirely unobjectionable, if
the IJ&tem was, in fact, altogether unconnectw with the Holy Scriptures.
·But when I shall have demonstrated to you-although I have already alluded to
the subject in our first meeting-that the inspired Sage of Israel, Moses bimselt;
may have been the -very first inventor of its original basis, perhaps this fact
alone will secure a little more decorously•in its favor the respect of the skep-
tic, and the attention of the believer.
And, in fact, in my introductory discou~e alluded to in the first words of
these preliminary remark!,t I have shown how it happened that Dr. Grey, while
perusing a certain treatise of William Beveridge, Bishop of St. Asaph, con·
ceived the beautiful idea of forming, for the English language, a 10rt of recipe
rocal key, by which certain lttter1 being made re~pectively the equivaleata ol
certain jiguru, one might be enabled, by taking the l«ler1 correaponding to
the figuru of a given number, to make a word with the Utero-numerical equi·
valents, which word, whatever it might signify, would always be more easily
remeaberw than the given number, however interesting might be the subject
or event connected with it.
Although I have already spoken of this exceedingly curious passage of
Bishop Beveridge, from which Grey conceived his ingenious key, deficient u
it ~ in its original applications-though I have pointed this out, yet I cannot

resist the temptation of recalling it to your minds. These are the worda o{
the learned Bishop.
It is worthy of note that the JeWB, especially in the titles or their books, for the
purpo16 ofindicating the year in which they were printed, collected the numerical
letters in a certain order, of which we will give some examples. Indeed they in-
vented one or more words, or made use ofsome Biblical sentence, whose significant
]etters, howsoever disposed, would amount to the proposed number. For example:
In the Biblical books, edited by Josephus Athia Amstelodamis, three title-pages
occur: one for the Pentateuch, another for the Prophets, and a third for the Hagio-
graph. The first purporta to have been printed in the year of the leaer computa•.
don p'11~ "'"ht::: "'II'D ri'» "'= 1'1)\1). Lingua mea e.t Btylfu lcriba prompti (my
tongue is the pen ofa ready writer). Pll8lms xlv. 1.-where the letters noted by
1be little marks above them, indicate the year in which the Pentateuch was printed.
What year ofthe Jewish leseer computation it was, may be immediately found, ifall
the letters, together with their numerical value, are thus placed. !II 70 =9 tl 60 ll SO
"' 2<Xl=419. Therefore the year was 419 according to the lesser computation ofthe
1ews, as we see by our Chronological institutes. So also the Prophets purport to
have been printed I'll"; ,,,n "l ~11)1:1 Ml11):1 in the year OnUI eallil eilionii--(The.
borden or the valley of vision)-Isaiah xxii. 1, of the leaeer computation where
1he letters 1"'" "!I MIDtl Bignify '-20. But the title-page of D"~:jM:::l or the Ha·
gioeraph is printed in the year b":l1:::l' riat !II:I!IIM:I, ICripla digilo Dei, (written
with the finger of God.)-where tbe two first significant letters of the word
b"::'J":::l signify the same year, 420: for n signifies 400 and :1 20. In the same man-
ner the Talmud BaaileiB purports to be printed in the year ,m~; n;11) M,"'llM)~, re-
dt'lnptionem miBit populo8U01(he sent redemption unto his people.) Psalms cxi. 9,
where the letters ofthe word n;\1) make 338. Finally, the Seder Tephillotb Hispa-
Diensls or Liturgy of the Spanish Jews, most wittily purports to have been printed
PIS'In M!ll', Hoc Anno, (in tbia year I) i.e. in tbe year 413, which the letters rut,n
illdioate. Book L Chap. 6.
Now, since it is true, as avowea by Grey himself, that it is this remarkable
quotation which inspired him with the immortal idea of the principle upon
which he based his system of Mnemonics ; and if it is upon the same Hebraic
principle that our more perfect and more philoaophical system of MNEMO·
TECHNY is founded, must we not in conscience attribute to the Israelites the
honor of the original invention of the system 1
Moreover, if we find the first record of its application in the Holy Bible,
the foundation of so many otw truths, and of so many daz:diDg lights, will
you say that I have not the most excusable foundation for praiaiBg the system
. with a certain degree of reverence, and for speaking of it sometimes, in con-
I\ aection with the Holy Writiop1
(mar~of approbation-si"p;n.rofastonishment).
But to return to Grey. Fipru, indeed, may be compared to isolated
grains of coarse sand, and they have no more hold upon the memory than
aaud upon a plate of polished glass. Words, on the contrary, fonn always some
image, which can always remain, more or le• deeply impreased upon the
mind, through the instrumeutality o{ the ~enses of Big/It and lt.etmflg. If, then,

without any difficulty, snrt>ly the process which could endow us with thi1
power would be deserving the due attention ofthe wise, whether connected or

Now, the system which I am about to illustrate before yon, I must reiterate,
has no other foundation than this: to deny its utility, then, would be denying
tbe utility of what I call knot.alcdge •f ftldl. We caa all of u remember,

6. I expected the marks of "Homeric mirthfulness" with which you
p-eeted this rather singular phrase. But as our object is to make an intlelible
ttapretrion upan the memory, be sure that tbe Tery oddity of the phrase will
aake it impo11ible for you ever to forget it. WbeneTer you wish to remember
1he tU'ticvlatioul, Satan will immediately be present to yoor minds (lallghter);

8. Both the English aad Latin formulai might be made more elegant,
undoubtedly, if the articulations were not submitted to a regular order; but
if you consider the difficulties which are to be surmounted to form a rattonal
phrase, with a series of imperative articulations, you will consider those formu-
las most excellent, and conceive, at once, a favorable idea of the power whicb
we will hereafter obtain from the system. The articulations being Se,
Te, Ne, Me, ~. Le, SHe, Ke, Fe, Pt, we have made of the~" Satan JDa7

better than any other pie, particularly Connecticut pumpkin-pie(loua laugkter) :
but because Ke, Fe, Pe, being there, cannot give a better word in connection
with Satan, etc.
ACCESSORY FORMULAS.
9. But in order to suit those members who do not like the idea of granting
the author of "all our woes" the sweet satisfaction of relisltiltg coffee-pie, or
even any other luxury (hilarity-luukinga), I will propose the following
formula, made of the same articulations, and a copy of which, by the way, I
was robbed of this morning, by some dishonest fellow, with a view, doubtless,
.to give it as a mig/tty production of his brain, one of these days:
Satan may rule or 1hake afop j
Or, if you like it better, this other one, with a justifying phrase:
IJJ" At the great Pandemonium meeting, in a jocose fit of good humo.r,

Undemanding, of course, a waggish sort of a demon, whom he took by the
throat (laughter).
JlEANING OF THE WORDS

10. Before proceeding any farther, I must explain what is meant by the
words articulation and correlative, which we have hitherto used une~lained,

philolophy of our fundamental basis.
ARTICULATIONS AND SOUNDS.
11. We will admit and say, henceforward, that there are no auch things u

lllld SOUNDS.
\
. CONSON.lNTI A.lfD VOWBL81
Tluir Philological IMUJficimcy.
12. What, in fact, is the philological meaning of the words consonant and
fKJ1Del? The lexicographers tell us gravely, that consonant is derivt'd from
the Latin con and sonare, to 10und together ; and that towel is derived
from oocalis, rocal or sonorous. What philological information do we derive
from this lucid explanation 1 Is there any thing in it that gives us a clear
undentanding of any striking difference between them, or any satisfactory rule
for distinguishing a consonant from a vowel1
Their Pedantic and Irrational .R.nnlyli1.
13. After the lexicographers, come the grammarians, who tell us, still more
dogmatically, such things as these: (yawns). "Grammar is the art of UJritifl8
and 1pe4lcing correctly." (!) ,
"To speak and write, VJOrds must be employed."(!!)
"Words are composed of '?JUahles, and syllables of letters).'
"Letters are divided into tJOVJels and consonants." (I I!)
"A VOtOel is an articulaR! sound, (I!) that can be perfectly uUered by itlelf."
"A consonant is an articulate sound, which cannot be perfectly uttered
without the help of a vowel. (gapings and noddings).

(Here tlu loud snoring of one of the members, awakened a burst of lauglaer,

Their Cacophonic Appellations.
1,, But this is not all : They tell us that the comonants are Be, Ce, De, eF,
Ge, aitcH, Ja, Ka, eL, eM, eN, Pe, Qu, aR, eS, Te, Ve, eX, Ze, and ••.• double v,
or W l •••• and that the vowels are a, e, i, o, u, simple (!) and wy, or y, which,
when occasionally coupled together, make a species of Lesbian match, which
they call diphthongs. (inquisitiw movements).
Now, is there any sign of philological preconception and design in this
irrational, unjustifiable, uncalled-for and cacophonic appellation of these com-
ponent members of our alphabets1
15. Why call the three fint letters Be, Ce, De, and the next eF, putting ita
nominative vowel beftWe. instead of aftet" it, as in the former cases, and inter·
rupt again this order, by calling the next Ge, and the following one aitcH (!)

d.uhle u, or W, which, being the double compound of a single vowel, ougbt
to be twice put among the vowela, for the sake of analogy and common sense ••••
16. But I beg your pardon :-1 had almost forgotten that even the Holy
Scnptures teach us that languagea originGted from the confusion of all tongues
at the Tower of Babel, and that the lexicographers and their brothers, the
grammarians, have doubtless intended to remind us daily of this Biblical truth, '\1
that we may pay greater respect to their Babelic-anti-philosophico-philological
confusions ( pudP~~ged hilarity-lou~applawe).
Yet, as it was from chaos that the Great Creator took the component
elements of this beautiful and harmonious world, which wheels with such
Dl&jestic precision and elegance in her etherial waltzing round the sun •••• 80 I
will have the pleasure of drawing forth from this unjustifiable Babelic caco-
phony the most beautiful, comprehensive, and philological delineation of the
true POBJUTION OP LAMGUAGE1 that can possibly be desired, and which Will seem
to you 80 Bimple, that a child can comprehend it without a single comment
(clap att~ion). Perhaps you will say that this is rather a bold undertaking
for a Gaul, just from "Ia belle France," who, but a short time Iince, could
scarcely speak two words of your language, besides ''good forenoon," with
"dU" and "dat," for tkia and tl&o.t (tkafening laughter tmd loud applauae).
Yet, if I fail in convincing you, I shall be happy to receive from you, three
hearty cheers of•••• encouragement (prolonged applause and merriment).
17. Suppose, in fact, that we say now, instead of this unphilologico-gram·
matical jargon, that,
lat. All words and, of course, languages, are made up of only TWo radical
components, which are denominated
AllTICULATION8 AND IOUNDS.
2d. An .llrticulanon is an effect of the wice, which cannot be uttered without
tht> combined assistance of either the lipa, the tongue, the UJeth or the ~ 1
and which, when once uttered, diu immediately upon the lipa, aod cannot be
pronounced again, without a new motion o{ either the lips, tbe tougue, the
teeth or the palate ; while, on the contrary,-3d. A Sound ia an tffect of t1u
voice, produced without the assistance of either the tongue, tbe teeth, the palate
or the lipa (continued attention) ; and whicb, being originated from the com-
bined agency of the lung11 and the pkaryn:r, can be reilldrated as lcmg as a
drawn breath can last (intenae attention). 4th. In fact, let us pronounce the
tJrticulations Be, Ce, De, and so forth-you see, that as soon as articulated,
these articulations die dry on the lips, without any prolonged echo.

124 FIRST LBMOM·
~. Now, let us pronounce the aounda a, e, o, and say alternately-
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e,
o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o.
You see that if you could draw a breath as long as would enable you to
take an tJd libitum promenade to the coral grottoa of Amphitrite, 'vithin the
deepest receaet of the sea, you could pronounce as many of these sounds u
her unfathomable empires contain pearls ; her oceanic shores, grains of sand ;
and the firmament, twinkling stars-without the necessity of using either your
palate, your teeth, your lips, or even your tongue!
18. Can there be a division more simple, more rational, mort' comprehensive
and intelligible than this l-and a philological system of the formation or
language more philosophical, and more satisfactory to the understanding, than
1111ch a mode of radical decomposition into articulations and sounds 1 i\nd are
you not each and all struck, at this moment, with the perfect intelligibility
of this moat aimple and rational system, and certain to distinguish. at once, an
a.rticul.Jtion from a aound, in every word (loud applause).
19. It is true, however, that the sounds i and u, need, somewhat, a very
alight assistance of the tongue, in their reiterated enunciation ; yet this
will not prevent them from being ranked among the sounds, inasmuch as they
partake infinitely more of the nature and characteristics of aounds than of
articulation~.
We will assimilate them, if you like, to the bats, in our system, which, ·
participating more in the characteristics of the beast than of t~e bird, are ranked
among the former.
We will do the same in regard to W, H and Y (vide Principles, page I.), of
which we will presently apeak, showing the reason w-h-y they must not be
ranked among the articulations-although they will appear among them in the
next diagram ftch I shall show you-for reasons easily seen.
JlATIONAL AND UNIFOB!Il APPELLATION OF THE ARTICULATIONS.
20. Starting, then, from the principle analyzed above, we will, henceforth,
and once for all, call the consonants articulations, and the vowels sound1, and
denominate, uniformly, all the articulationa, by placing constantly their norni-
atllive 1oundafter them, and taking, also uniformly, for this nominative sound,
the sound e, and no other, as follow•:
Be, Ce, De, Fe, Ge, He, Je, Kt, Le, Me, Ne, Pe, Qu,
Be, Se, Te, Ve, We, Xe, Ya, and Ze;
Leaving for the simple sounds,
a, e, i, o, u,
Which we will continue to pronounce in the ordinary way, since they have

UTIClTLATIONS AND 801JND8.
21. Now, then, if we pronounce IIUCcessively each of these articulations,
we shall soon see that Be and Pe, are pronounced with exactly the same labial
motion, with this sole dlfi'erence, that Pe has a aoft breathing, while Be is arti-
culated luzrd; in making, then, of these two articulations, a ringle one, in the
rfecompcmtion of tDf1rda (vide No. 2), you immediately foreaee that it
would be impossible to forget that Pe is equal to Be, and trice ~Ba, either of
them meaning 9, as shown in the diagram of the first fundamental basis.
Whenever, then, we find an articulation aoft, having a corresponding one Arsrd,
1re will constantly give them the same numerical value, calling the 8oft onu
Pa.IMITJVE, and the hard onu, CoRRELATIVE ARTICULATIONS (vide No. 2). In
pronouncing, then, Ce, or Se and Ze, we find the same lingual motion forming
these articulations, making Ze the hard one, and the two others, which make,
in fact, but one articulation, 80ft ; we have Zc thtl correlative of Se or Ce ; De
aad Te come under the same rule-De being the liard, and Te the 10ft ; Fe
(60ft), has the 1111.me dento-labial origin u Ve (kGrtl); Ge aa.d Je are both hard,
L or Qe are soft, having G/&e or Ge hard, for conelatives. Now, if you should
articulate Le, Me, Ne andRe, till the sounding of the doomsday trumpet, you
would find that they have no correlative articulatiou whatsoever; at least, in
the English language, for in the French, for example, Ne bas Gne, and Le, the
double L, or LLe.
22. Indeed, 10 true is this principle of correlativcneu of articulations, that
Nature herself teaches ua ita truths in several remarkable illltanees, which we
lad among the Gei'ID8ll8 and the nativ~ of Wales.
Ifyou ask a German to pronounce the words lhep, tlou, fN*Jnt, cot, and
ftfer, h;e will invariably read, and mOlt distinctly, too--;jofJ, toad, badmd, gotl
and tritJer,-uniformly pronouncing J~ for SHe ; De for Te; Be for Pe; G/&e feE
Ke, and Ve tOr Fe (hiltJTitytmd appla.,e). So that, ifyou wish to make a German
servant ask your butcher for a autt~m c!&op, you must tell bim to get you..a .
mwddon job (prolonged Ailarity), or else he will find himself in the same
predicament as the poor girl, who went to twenty different dr1goods shops in
one day, before abe could make herself understood, until at last, fortunately,
meeting wiili a German cle!k,. she asked him for den yart ov vlannel to make
a beardy goat(!), meaning a petticoat 1! (loud and prolonged laugAter). As to
the Welsh examples, I will refer you to a great authority, Shakspeare, in the
"Meny Wives" and "Henry VI.," where you will find Parson Evan.t and
Capt. Fluelle11, saying ft!eacntlg, Cot plus yov, /"J coot, etc., etc., for
whemeatly, God hie. you, very good, etc.

ch111ged into Kt, as iudicated in the examples given in the note to Qe, below
the diagrun of the .6nt fuadamental basis (vide page I.), where Ce and CHc
before a, o, u, are pronounced like Kt, as in Cap, Coat, Cup, Cupid, Charac-
ter, C.horus, Catechumen, Chrysalis, Chronology, Christian; but when it will
be remembered, once for all, that in the analysis or decomposition of words,
we must constantly be guided by t.h8 .IWI, and not by lexicographical ort..hogrt~­
p.hy, it will make no di1ference to us whether a word is written with such or
such letters or comonant81 since we acknowledge nothing else, for our .Mnemo-
technic convenience, but ARTICtTLA.TioNs and sotrNDS.
~. You have seen that Gt, and Jt, which are both hard, had no 10ft
primati-oe. But this is only apparently so; for if, abandoning entirely the id«a
of letters, as we have agreed upon, we pronounce, for example, the warda
SHarp, CHeap, aZUre, you see at once, that we discover very distinctly tlrrH
netP AJ!TICtTLA.TioNs, philologically true, and which, certainly, the le:xicograpbo-
grammarian cacophonic classifyers of the alphabet never thought of. Adhering
theD to our ratioruJ principle, we will say, with my brilliant contemporary,
A.ime Paris, for it is to .him that we are indebted for the original idea of UU.
beautiful adaptation, that SHe, ZHe, and CHe, are the natural primitive soft
articulations of Je; and Ge; !or if you pronounce them altemat~Iy, you will
decide without hesitation that they are produced, with an almost imperceptible
modification, by the same labio-lingual motions ; CHe partaking very !!lightly
of Te and SHt, in the aame degree as Je and Ge partake of IH, which the
reiterated pronunciations of those articulations will show you. And why
have not the lexicographer~ or the grammarians thought of these articulations,
and made of them distinct letters of the alphabet, as had been already 10
plainly pointed out to them by the Greeks in their ~. or PH, BUb-soft-corre-
lative of Fe, aa we have naturally placed it in our fundamental basis 1

25. As regards Xe, if you articulate it properly, you will perceive that it
partakes so distinctly of Ke and Se, that it is imperatively necessary to make
of it a compound articulation, meaning both Ke and Se. It even partakes
of SHe and Ze, as in the words luXury and Xenophon. (Vide Rule 2,

Home, etc. ; IUld that although it ia, as it were, miculoled in thought, since it
canot be prolonged, and must be reiterated like an articulatioa, yet as it

and Ye, although articulated also, and, I mult confess, withperfect distinctness,
yet We being, as I have already remarked, formed ot' the double 10und u, and
Ye being nothing else but the 10tmd I, or the Greek upsilon "' and being
always used in writing as I, it would have been mere inconsistent to have
placed them among the articulations than the sounds. Accordingly, following
the most rational interpretation of my established principle, I have called them,
together with He, semi-articulated sounds, having no numerical 'fllllue. m

This title will at first appear, I know, somewhat n«rerMntical i but this will
not diminish, in the leut, the Mnemotechnic importance of the table, which
signifies simply this: In order that you may be able, in our next lecture, to
tell, e:c tlhrupto, which.fi!'ure correiJIOnds to any given number among the DIN
!Jundred tJttd fifty-four figures of the Ratio of the Diameter to the Circumfer-
ence of the Circle (that "great experinent" at which you. marvelled so much),
it will be necessary for you to baptize, if I may ay eo, tGCA ftnler of your
lift luJnd with the name of each figure, from 1 to 9 (l"ugAter). That is to
lll)'~oubling the little finger, or the CJ11ricfdM, upon the pCI!a of the hantl,
you will call it ONB; doubling the tl1tftWM, you will call it TWO; doubling the
medium, you will caD it THBBB ; doubling the indu, you will call it ~:_ova ; thea
the thumb, which you will call FIVE ; and tlnu is completed what I call Tu
FIRST TuRN. Now then, that you may be able to number up to 9, upon the
1ame Ji,..nd, you must use again the tmrictd4r for s1x ; the annular for SBVEN ;
lhe medium for EIGHT, and the indez for NlNB-this is wbat I mean by the
SscoND T11RN, and you see that the necromantic appearance of this nomen·
clature is not, after all, so cabalistic (lawghter). Finally~ since we have R¥O
in our lHwi8 as let:lder of the corps, you will simply remember that wben Wf!
lball reckon hereafter, concerning the rtJtio, with the assistance of this " Jet\
hand nomenclature," zero must be constantly struck with the foot before any
other figure-but as this is only to be used in our next lecture, I dismi• tile
wbject, with the recommendation that you practiee this nomenclature a little,
striking, alwnys, zero FIRST, and then 1, 2, 3, etc., up to 9.
47. .Perhaps you would like to know the reuon ttJAy I ban put Zero 6efor•
the other figures, while the same figure is uniformly placed lCIIt in all arithme-
tical enumerations of the ten digital This reason may appear somewhat
eccentric, yet I hope to convince you that it is not altogether unfounded ; by
which you will~ see that a TBOVGBT has presided even in those parts of the
system, which appear, at 6rst, of the least significance. Wkot was there in
existence before the creation of the fir• 6sillg,-which, oC COUJ'IIe, gave origia
to the No. 11 (nupectiftg Ailaritg).

49. But to proceed with the subject of oar immediate inquiriei.-ID the
pages V. and VL of the "Principles," you perceive a eerie• of
IX.
50. General and Fundamental Rules, with which you must be thoroughl7
acquainted before entering upon the practical applicatiom of the 9stem. A.
couple of readings, as you will perceive, will be sufficient for you to muter
these rules, without the perfect understanding of which, you cannot poaibly
follow the developments of the " principles and their applications.''
51. The perfect !&o71U1fientily of pronunci4tion, in the French language,
did not require a single nde of u:u.ption in the applicatiooa made by mpelf
and Paris of Feinaigle's brilliant idtG to that tongue.
52. But, it was far dift"erent in its application to the Engliah language.
The innumerable varieties of pronunciation of even the same letter, in
identical positions, but in words of a dift"erent meaning, (as may be seen in theae
rules, and in the examples of No. 34 above), render it unavoidable to have
~al rulu Cor certain cues ; hence the origin of these " general and funda-
mental rules.;' You will be conscious, by reading them, of the familiar
knowledge which it was requisite to posae• of your torturing J.anguap
(laught~r), in order perfectly to adapt to it the system, and you will then per·
haps conceive an approximate idea of the Sisyphian ditliculties and fatiguing
labors I bad to accomplish, after only two years acquaintance with your J.an.
page (complimentary applau1e). If I refer to this, I beg you will excuse what ...
appears much like genuine egotism. I mention this fact with a kind of pre--
sentiment that some of those " dishonest literary sharks, who can live only at
the expense of others' existence• and productions," will, doubUeaa, upon m1
increasing popularity, (thanks to your unbounded kindne• for it), (toiJI'II
applawe), and the unparalleled success of my lectures on the aystem (raewd
•pplauae), will doubtless, I say, attempt to defraud me of the fruits of my IU'dQ.
oua labors, by pretending that they are those of others, upon apparmt similar•
iti~a, the better to suit their vile purposes.•
53. But if auch a thing should happen, inquire simply whether the system

K. At the bottom of page VI. of the " Principles," you will find aome rulee
under the head of
.&» wvua IL&Oii».ao•a,
which require aome explanation, inasmuch u there are two linea there lteaded :
AJtGUJ[ENT, or rttUOal and importance of these u:ctptiou.
55. When you become acquainted with the use of my "Pbreno-Mnemo-
techoic Dictionary," (without the usilllance of which, by the way, you cannot
well apply the aptem, u I will explain hereafter), you will see that it very
rarely happe01 that a word containiDg more than fovr tu'ticulatWn.., is wanted
for the mnemonization of any numericaljiiCI, and indeed there are no datu
havingjiw figures; and but very few important statistical or geographical facts
ai general use, containiDg more than four ; 10 that, any available means by
which we might secure a greater number of tUahk words, would always be an
mproN~MAt. While thiDking upon this, I saw that the English language COD•
tained aa immense number of words ending with the syllables ING, and TioN,
w IIOI', when pronounced BBVN, which, through a frightful reiterated occur-
re.oce of the articulation Ne or 2, at the end of words, which might not often
fi.nd figures to suit them, since their number is 10 much greater than that of
words endiag with other figures, would alford too many repetitiona of the figure
!Z, and thereby considerably impede our operations.
56. Consequently, I found it both more convenient and more advantageous
to adopt as an exception-purely optional, however-the constant8tlppresBion,
in the mnemonization of facts, of the articulations Ne, or 2, in the final
• syllable of all wordl ending in ING and TION or axo~, when pronounced sauN,
ia the .manner explained in these ad libitum u:ception~~ in the "Principles."
57. By 10 doing, a great number of wordrin the jive articulation serie1, caa
be reJUCfd to the -ariea of those having only four. ;·
58. It follow., of counte, that the words of the four articulation seri€8,
euding in TIOK or IlioN, are thu1 brought down to the series having only tlu-ee,
end .n.L tboae of the aame nature, in this latter aeries, are lowered also to the
~· of ttDO llrliculatiofu, and 10 on; but this, far from being a disadvantage,
JS, on the contrary, of great benefit to the student, inasmuch as there are a
I"* many ~ore facu to be mnemonized with only three figures than with
fqt~tr; and 11nce compowtd vxwth are still more frcquen.tly tUed, the greater

For if lbemoteclmy ligniiel p!aiJIIy "the ut of -...ry," by whiclt
ia undernood the art of i111proft1tg or cwlfttMtiag the WNIIIOFJ, by " Phr~

cultivatiJIII tbe memory ancl tile JDiM;" the word piriM from ~. sipify..
ing tainci •, •• (appllnlH).
73. The forepng reMOG il imm rather hal the cc:mequencee ef tbtl
.,.stem than frem the system iteelf. I will, therefore, give you anotlaer an4
ltill more pbiloaepbical ooe, mwn ftcJm the very nature of the system.
All preceding syatema, IIOIIle parts t1l Paris's bein« excepted, have beea, •
you are all aware, but 10 many t~rbitrtmj methcdl of ~IJ i.mprnU.,
the memory ; ours, on the eontrary, u you well know, is founded upoo a purelJ'
philosophical basis, and operates through the inullutt«sl and not the meelumiccl
action of the :rniad ; we may, con~equently, weH call it the "iDtellectual
method of improving the memory''-which is also plainly aigaiietl bythe W'Ol'!i
Pbreno-Mnemotechny (applmm).
74. At all eYt'tlta, I lball be moat happy that a certaiD " great Hellenilt,"
and " atdor" of a great acuay "original" compontiom iJl Lati#J ancl in GNM,
would ~ a "happier" and" more iBtelligible compound," in a shomr
word, and one better adapted to the genius of the Greek language.-It ia true,
I bad almost jorgett• (!) it), that I did not learn my Greek by the "copy-
righted boob,'' and "patentsystem," (exquisite though, after all) of the learned
"Xenopboo," and indefatigable modem Xai.xln~o~ (" Jw.eric lauglller").
In conclusioo, I will nggelt a last reason tDhy we should insist upon tbe
word "Phreno-Mnemotechny," although not YBT to be found in existiDg
lexicons ; Aime Paris calls his system " MD.emotechnyJ" ovrs, you will lee,
particularly in its brilli&Dt applications to Astronomy, nomeDClataret, prCIIe,
poetry, and languages,-applicationlef which Paris has never dre~.,.,
I ay, being far imptoTed upon .Parie'a, mast tie ~illaed by lll_,.tM
appellation! (unanimous ~).

APPLICATION OF TilE SYSTEM
TO
mSTORICAL DAl'ES--SACRED CHRONOLOGY-AND THE PROBLEM OF THE RATIO
OF THE DIAMETER TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE.•
Lnma Allfl) <hNTLBDN:
1. WITH the understanding that you are perfectly conversant at this moment
with the principlu which I have illustrated in our last meeting, I will proceed,
at once, to the a.pplicati011 of those " principles" to the various objects of
useful acquirement, without the knowledge of which we may say that a man
~aua rather than lives. And, indeed, what properly constitutes the state
which we call human existence1 Is it the m,ere action of breathing, moving,
eating, and digesting1 If it were merely so, a carriage-wheel that moves with
ten-fold more velocity than a man-a boa-constrictor that eats a hundred times
more-the ostrich, which, according to poetry, digests even stones and iron-
and the bellow of a blackmnith, which draws, at a single pufF, more air than
twenty men-might as well have a right to claim a pre-eminent station above
the human kind.
2. Is there a very striking difrt>rence, intellectually speaking, between a }
savage and a vegetative tree 1 The negative answer is generally admitted by I
all philosophers. What, again, constitute the more 110lid charms of life 1 Is it
the mere possession of wealth 1 Interrogate the history of Cralsua. Is it the
possession of power1 Interrogate the lives of Cleaar, Bajazet, and Napoleon.
Ia it the jeweled diadem and glittering apparel of " majesty 1" Interrogate
the biographies of Charles the First of Englaad, and Louia the Sixteenth of
France! ••••••••
3. In what, then, do they consist t In two principal things: first, in the
acquisition, and next in the poaaealion of knotcltige. Consult the lives of thoae
sages who have ennobled humanity by some act of virtue and philosophical

greatne• ; you will 1ee that all their happinea COI1Iiltecl in the panuit ad
enjoyment of knowledge, from which abo originated their immortality-for
not only did thay p8ll their material life in the ecstacies of happine-, arising
from the uquilition of knowledge, but everlasting fame keepa and will ever
bep alive their imperishable memory, when even generations upou. genera-
tioos shall have IUJlk iato the atream fX Lethe.
'- See Plato, the father ofPbiloeophy; he leaves hie native countryto seek for
knowledge about the world, in imitation ofPythagoru, Herodotus, Thalea, Ana-
charsia, and other~ of tbe ggdde• of Wisdom. He falla into the impious
banda ofa gangol pirates,who make him a slave, and sell him in a public muket
like a vile brute. Yet they caDJlot sell hie 10ul. He remains unabaken in ru.
adversity, and etill finds an unbounded IOUI'Ce ofhappineas, amid hie misfortune~,
in the contemplatione ofnature, the remembrance of what he knows oftrutk, and
the I'Weet meditatione ofphilosophy; while his temporary fellow·captivee, bend-
iag beneath the weight oftheir ill fortune, and lamenting over their unendurable
fate, lie cl'Uibed beneath its blows, and die in pangs of despair and deiOlatioo.
6. See the wise Epictetus; a barbarous muter llolds hil ~le boiy by
tbe rigbta of entail, but hi.& soul remains free from the.grup of his tyra,nt1
md whether painfully dragging his chaiAa, or lying upon his truckle-bed, with
~is broken limb, be still feels kimlelf free, and lives none the less happy; for
bi.a mind, illumined by the lights of knowledge, delights in the contemplation
of truth and wisdom; and after a life of bodily sufi'erings, of which he seem1
almost uncODIICious, he dies in 1leah, leaving a monument to Philosophy whic~
1enders his name imperishable.
6. Look at Pope, the lEeop of modem times in body, and in mind a
Homers his soul-Prometheus-like-is chained within a distorted and para·
J.ytic frame ; nature bas abnost refused him the forms of humanity and the
powers of locemotion ; all the earthly pleasures of man are unavailable to
him; a worshipper of maaer and se01ualism would sink into desolation aDd
death ia his wretched condition; yet Pope finds himself happy, supremely
happy, amid his bodily deformities, for his milld, glittering with the bright
reilectiOtlll of Knowledge, Truth, and Wisdom, makea him the hap}Mest of
!nell, ia the company of those three inseparable sisters, through whose divine
interceuion, while his deformed body perishes, his QUD.e, crowned with
.etemal glory, will continue to dazzle, diamond-like, with the aery flashes ot
!Jjs incorruptible IUld immortal genius, through ages ud generations of men.
7. Look, finally, at Milton. I say finally, for besides Homer, Camoene, Car-
nates, and Rouaseeu, hundreds could be cited, who, diJdaiaed like these immortal
P~~ by Fortuac, and afllicted with bodily tortures, found kappi'IWI in the
acqlll.Gbon of kno~ledge, in the society of the musu, &Jld in the worship of
Truth. Look at Milton, and. see whether in the darkne11 of the eternal blind-

No, IIUI'ely; but atteuded. by hit two lovely daughter-. who, lW buddio&
1ili.ee, catch, aa they fall, the pearly drops of his intpiration (electrifyirlg ap-
Jilauae), he swims in .rapturous contemplatiODJ through the oceau of a moat
111blime poetry, and sometimes-rainbow-like, glittering with all the glowiug
colors of the most brilliant imagination-he pou1'll forth 6ooda of thrilling har-
monies, forgetting earthly IIUff'eringa, privationa, and the dildain of the weald,
in the sweet caresaes of his " heavenly muse," and the golden treasures of hie
unfathomable knotoledgs-leaving behind him a name aa imm«tal • the
" heavenly spirit" which " did inspire" hie eve.rlutillg SODpI (GJ111larue).
8. Such are the advaDtages, the pleUUI'et, and the " powers" ofb.owledp ;
and certainly it was not in vain that Bacon aaid, with emphasis, that "know-
ledge is power ;" for not only does Ae who kntnD1 the most, find, in the variety
of his acquisitions, always a source of happine-, lllld often of immortal fame,
ltut he also places himself above his fellow-beings, iatellectually speaking, 10
much the more pre-emiaendy, u he more extensively pa•eae Ullormatioo;
from whence, through the lights of Truch, always~ W--, whicb is
tbe deepest source of ltrength and the purest eaaeuce ofPOWEB.
9. And, in fact, a bovJing man may lose his wealth, his limbs, his sigllt---ihe
most precious functirm of his wonderful organization.-as l<mg aa his intellect-
11al acquisitions remain to him, through the heavenfy ageney of u uni"'f'airtfl
•emory, he will always find within himaelf a 10uree of llappine11 and enjey-
ment, to which nothing can be compared, l"ith the never-failing certainty of
&eeing himself, at will, from the whims of a'capricious tomme, the sad dre.-
of vain ambition, the turmoils of eocial troubles, and the freezing indiJfereace
~ disdain of the world (appro/JGtiw applat~.~e).
10. But now to the keystone of our argument: Since it is the greateet
amount of knowledge that enables a human being to elevate himself the higher,
DOt only to happiness, and often fame, but also in Ills own estimation, as .in the
Ntimation of mankind ; and ainee it is unquestionably true that the extent of
our intellectual acquisitions ilaubordinate, ilt a -~ r~, to the c:oDJeSpQ~td­
ing capacity of our recollectit1e fcvltiu, what have we tllen t. ~ in Olde' to
attain this degree of intellectual excellence, whi<:h is requisi.t.e to re.ite ua to
that source of ltappinen and intellectual pOtDer, which \IJlaVoidaJ>ly originates
from thoae recollective faculties, but to eultivate and improve our r~~eaqry by
any acce•ible meaDs wlrich may lie within our .reachl ••••
11. Now, tbeD, if a lever of irresistible power were offered to us, by which
we might be enabled to cultivate, improve, strengthen, adorn, and enrich our
fiU11101'J to a degree whale e:dent cmaot y~ be ~ far has the a~
of twa lever already proved efficient-would aot the n~s*~ of such aa invaJ.

·12. But the field of knowledge ia 1!0 vast-its almost unbounded extent,

15. But, now to the system! (1:elwnent applawe). Our IUbject, this evenillg,
is to illuatrate its applicaJion, and give you, by practical dmt01lstratioM,
incontrovertible evidences of its efficient powers. The subject of~ur programme
is, as shown you by the printed "Principles" distributed to each member, the
"application of the system to historical daJes" of sacred and profane history;
the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of the circle, with one hundred
and fifty-four decimals ; and the theory of making the mnemotechnic formulas,
u indicated in page XV., under the bead of MEMORANDA.

16. Is it necessary for me to point out the utility derived from, and inherent
' in historical knowledge 7 A simple definition of the general charactPr of his-
\ tory may suffice us on this point. I will, then, simply state, that history is the
1 tableau which the perspective of past timea, of vanished centuries, preaents to
1 our eyes. It is the code in which are written the good or bad actions of men;
1 .in a word, the collection of the records of the human race. In history we are
j able to study successively the origin of nations, the founding of empires, their
I acmmee, theU' decliae, their fall j the SUbverting Of physical and moral Order,
\ the revolutio.QJ of the globe, the passions of men exposed to the broad light of
day, a few wise, a throng of villains, a few virtues, " and a thousand crimes."
Its aim is to instruct men by the actions of their fellow-beings. Differing from
tnorals, it does not lay down dry and meagre precepts ; it conveys its instrue.
ti0118 through the medium of facts, which are the speaking models of experi-
ence, of prudence, and of wisdom. It is there that we learn to cherish apd
to practice virtue; and it is, above all, upon these different grounds that history
becomes an ~t study, and one full of interest for us. History is divided
into numerous departments; but neither my time nor your patience would
permit me to 1.1peak of them all.
17. I have therefore chosen, as the subject of our historical illustrations,10me
of the principal events from two only of the niost interestiDg kin<b of histories,
namely : the general and sacred chronologies.
18. The choice from the " 1acred chronology" embraces almost a complete
synopsis of tbat important part of history, as lll8Y be seen by the EWJIT TAJILES
of the printed" Principles," numbered 1, 2, 3, 4-, 5, 6, 7, 8.
19. The choice from the "general or profane chronology" has been limited
to the strictest selecti~>q among the most pre-eminent events of ancient history,
leaving it to the student ill add, according to his own taste, as many more as he
may think proper from the thousands which encumber the chronological eata-
logue of both modem and anC'l<~nt universal history, Those are contained on
pages XVll., XVIII., XIX., lPl~ XX., ofthe " prillted principles," under the title
of " HISTORICAL J).l'l'.S,11

which I have fhllowed in this series of facts, as being the most approved, and
the most universally adopted ; end as I ha"te taken the greatest care to MYe
them compared with the work of that learned prelate, you may rely upon
them as being as correct as can be desired.
20. Yet, however limited, as a general choiee, this number of datea is more
than sufficient to illustrate by pra,;tital uperiment the application and JIO'IDfA'
ot the principles of the system.
21. Consequently, following the saying, that "to him who denies motion,
one step is as potent an argument in favor of its existence, as a walk of a
thousand miles," I have made a :u!J-extract from the general selection, npOA
which we will exemplify our illustrations. The pages IX. and X. of the "prin-
ciples," contain the extracted dates.

contained in page IX., with no other power at his disposal than that of Jrit.

abe would, according to the old proceSII practised since the flnlt gtaadloas of
Adam, repeat successively each date, reiterating each one an intiuite number
of times, thus :

Invention of letters, etc. 1 eighteen hwul-red and ttDmty-otN I
Deluge of Ogygea 1 Bet7entem hu.ndfoed rmd Mty-fou.r I
and 80 on, until lt last hammered in, by hundreds or thouandl of repetitions,
these dates would perllapa remain in the memory of the ltudeat-« all even,
a few of them would be certain to remain-but how long t
23. This is a question to which you can sati.Jiactorily answer, fur you have all
learned these dates at school, some of you Olany years ago (IGugNer), and
aome but very recently. Alld yet, I may ask with confidence, who could
answer, with the perfect usura.uce of being right, ttDmty historical dates, even
were hia life and fortune at stake, upon the correctness of his answert •••
~. But let us make an experiment, which I invi~ you besides to repeat
at home• with still more leisure, in order that you may the more firmly bue
your conviction, if I am right-or your contempt for the system, if I am wrong
in my assertions.
25. I will read to you, successively, the thirty-six dates contained in page IX.,
mentioning the e11ent with the date; after which, calling again the ewnt alone,
we will try how many dGtes you will hal'e remembered dur:iDc my reJdiag.

in the most satisfactory manner poalihle, the reaaon of his association, 110 that
ihe formula may remain more forcibly Impressed upon his memory, as will be
presently experienced by every member present.
34. Tbia is the principle of retUoni11g upon which each formula must be
constructed, for example :
The death of .Abraham has given us the word divinity, which was certainly
the best, among ·the words contained under No. 1821 of the dictionary, that
could be united with this holy patriarch; besides, it is commonly said, when
aperson dies, "he is gone to repose in Abraham's bosom." Now, when
Abraham died, be could not certainly go to repose in his own bosom (bur~t&
of laughter). But the word Divinity is there; wl1at shall we do with itt

35. What would be the condition of the world at this moment without the
Use of letterst The savage ~nd uncivilized nations around us give us the
plain answer: a homogenous mass of ignorance, barbarism1 despotism, etc. It
is unquestionably to the invention and the use of ]etten that we are indebted
for the blessings of civilization, religion, and liberty-this question does not
admit of any further demonstration, so palpable is its truth. Therefore we will
say, with propriety, that:

must we understand by the deluge of Ogyges, and that of De'llca.lion, recorded
hy the Greeks 1 T.hey cannot certainly be uniwr1al delugu, as the ancients
believed. What then were these two events1 Unquestionably some very
destructive innndations, and nothing else. What could have produced such ·
disastrous inundations1 Most likely some very frightful storm, or some pro-
longed outpouring of the clouds, or heavy rain-therefore we are perfectly

53. Ladies and· gentlemen, Plato, discu11ing once among his scholars, thea
le&ted under the cool shades of cape Sunium, was denying the existence of
•otion, with all the power of that sublime eloquence and Hymettian sweetness
which pour in golden streams through what remains to ua of his brilliant mind.
He had almost convinced every one that fiiOtion did not uist-notwithstandins
the waves rollins upon the aea before him, and moving at his feet, upon the
~ tbe light pebbles of the shore; notwithstanding the planets wheeling in
their majestic round about the sun, upon the dark blue vault of heaven, and
the clouds sailing along upon the breeze, and every thing, in fine, moving around
him in creation. Yet Plato, triumphant, as he believed, turned round towards
Diogenes, who W1ll lying stretched out upon the turf, with his (Plato's)
pupila, and addrelling the man of the "lantern," who had aotiolud away Al-
e::nnder from before his tub ; "Well Diogenea," said Plato, with emphasis,
"canst thou MID find an argument for my argummt" 7--A few days before,
Plato having defined man, in the presence of Diogenes, as " a two legged animal
without feathers;" Diogenes, for an answer, returned to Plato's school the next
day, and threw at his feet a "plucked cock," saying, "here is Plato's man!"-
this time the chief of the Cynics simply rose from the -ground, covered his sun-
burnt shoulders with his shabby cloak, and walked to and fro, without uttering
a word. Then Plato, addressing him again, said, "So, Master D., thou givest

5!J. But I beg of your kindnee~ to remark a ciNumetance, worthy of your
attention ; it is, llll you will observe, that this perft-ct link of aBBOCiation which
exists between the greatest majority ofthe mnemotechnic words, and the n·euta,
is not the result of conditional acc0111modation ; I mean to say that, meA aa tlwy
are, the words appear indeed rather to have been made on purpoee to suit each
event, than to be the aimple result of the philo1ophical tl8mce of the system
and its principlea. And, in fact, when we see auch words as aun./nam, for the
" tint lUll-dial erected at Rome ;" teaching, for the "fint library erected at
Rome ;" watery bed, for the " passage of the Red Sea ;" IJIUJ808"VS, for " Sep-
tuagint version of the Old Testament;" and a number oi other words as aatoo-
Uhingly appropriate, which I could quote-when, I say, we 1ee such remarkable
coincidences, one might be tempted, indeed, to think that these tDOrM have beeJl
made upon figures cho1en to 1uit the event, rather than from the authentic figure~
of the real dates themselves. But, if you look at the Edinburgh Encyclopmdia,
and the works of Uaher, whence they have been selected, you will aee that the
figures correaponding to those dates are, in reality, 213, for the erection of the
first sun-dial at Rome ; 167, for the erection of the fint library at Rome ; 1491,
for the ~of the Red Sea; 277, for the Septuagint version of the Old
Testament, and so on for all the others; and that it is the difficulty which has
yielded to the pkila.opAy of the system-and not the ayatem to the exigenciea
of the difficulty (prol~d applaun). Yea, it has been in our aystem, not as in
the case of Mohammed and the mountain, but directly the rnerH. It is the
mountain here that caae to .Mo~ (l~Jt~Bkter), and not Mohammed who
went to the mounwnl (remtDetl hilarity).
56. But, with your kind permission, 1 will atill carry the idea a little
farther. You remember what 1 said of the remarkable ~ of our funda-
mental basis, that is, ofthe original aovrce whence it wu whoHy derind. In
speaking of the !tint which Doct. Grey received from the learned Biahop
Beveridge, in the construction of his litera-numerical key, I pointed out to you
how strange it was that the fi'rlt original idea was to be found in the Holy
Bible. In •peaking of Grey's discovery, I made Ule of the worda "impired
idea," "Hebraic conception," or" inspiration," etc. Now, without attemptiag
to arrogate a ditrine origin for this system, however true, powerful and philo-
sophical it may prove in ita applications, as well 81 in ita essence, is it not

excite your aatonilbment-and, perhaps, extort your admiration. The ratio of
the circumference to the diameter of the circle, will be the next of our ate]H,
by which I expect to aurp88l your expectations, however exaggerated they may

RULES, PRECEPTS, REMARKS, AND EXPLANATION
OFTHI:
MEMORANDA. ON PA.GB XV. OF "PRINCIPLES."
58. You will obaerve that the pagesof " principlel" belonging to tMslecture,
contain right pt~gu of foratd• for the laitdoriccl datu of profane lr.Utory, and
--. pagea of foravla for the ~ clworaology, together with their t~
oC facti.
EXPLANATION O.F lllBlllORANDA ON PAGE XV.
KBlllORA.NDUX FIRST.
59. In the nlectformulas of pages XI. and XII., you perceive, as in those of
pages XIII. and XIV., that the formulas are preceded oa the left hand by the
~ru of the dates, and that each date ia accompanied by a tranalation of ita cor-
responding articulations below. This ia to point out, in cue of doubt, the true
articulations which mu.t be tranalated from each mne11101ecluaic tDOrd. But, as
the translation of tome words, particularly in the •eUct formulas of pages xm.
and XIV., will appearto you unintelligible at 6rat, as cootaining initial articv- .
llllio111, which do not cOI'I"NppOld to tbe figorea, I must, at once, enter into an
explanation of these apparent inconsistencies.
60. In fact, for .RbraAatA'I coW1UII&t tvit4 God, etc., you 1ind the word·
&BPBNT, tranalated by u, pe, ne, le, or 4--9~1, for 1-921 B. C., and a1Bo
(besides several others, which may be seen at a glance by the Roman letters
wllic:h precede the italics), for "Jottep4'• bretlwen goit&g down to Egypt after
com," etc., the words BIG BA.CE, traDilated by BB, glt,e, 1e, ke, or 9-707, for 1-
707 B.C.
61. The following are the reMOM of these tJfiPfJf'trlt i1te0nftltenciu:
If you Cllll to your recollection the pages of profane history, you will
remember that the IDOIIt BDCient events recorded in its chronology, do not

all the worda, simple aad compound, bepmiug iD our Dieticmary with the figure
1. Now, if you penMe tile eight table~ of 1rm-ed c/arM&Ology, appended to the
"Principles" in hand, you will aee that from• tlae "Covenant of Abraham,"
tlown to the "vieit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon," or t~Wrt than ltalf of
the Jewilh hiltory, all the dat~ are JftCCded by the figure 1, which woult
give a repetition of the articulation te in so great a number of formulas, tbat
it might become an inconvenience, were it absolutely nee~ to have tbi.t
articulation " or 1, in every mnemotechnic word.
62. But u it ia imposl'ible for any person, howe'Yer little he may be acquainted
with the histories whose dates he dellires to mnemonize, to aimlke a wlol•
tlwusand ,,,.,, M even HtJinll thouaand yean, in any one of the~' he may
have mnemonized, it muat follow, that it will be impoaible to make a miltake.
if we eetablish it as a rule of e:s~tion, that :
63. ~ Wheaever, in tM •nemrmiutiM of tl&e fceu ofBtJef'ed clrcmoleg,
a date containa the figure 1 or articulation te, makiag Mae tAotutmd year• ; cer..
tam that we cannot commit an error of ,_cmtvriu in our reckoning, we will
change, aa it may beat suit otu convenience, the articulation te or figure 1, mto
uy other articulation that may allow us to make a more IUitable mnemotecb-
nic word for the et1tm.t to be mnemonized,-thua we will recollect, wiihout the
alighteat trouble, that the worda BID'BNT and BIG s.t.CK, above quoted, are to 'be
translated 1921 and 1707, making unhesitatingly of •• aad BB, te or 1; aa it
cannot enter the mind, even of a Turk, much lea a Christian, that tJae Patri-
arch Abraham could have lived four thoUillndyear• before Chriat; 8Dd that the
.brothers of Ja~epb came down to Egypt in tearch of corn !UN:& t!loUMUtd year•
before the Saviour, or five thouland beiOre the Creatiao according to Gene-
ail (c~~llti?!B' ~au.e). J-
64. Ye you w perceive that, in the aeries a{ these secrecl dates, the tm
ftrat ones begin with the figures 2 and 3, or articulati001 M and •· If tlllea
we had made no fWOMon in tlieir behalf, u aome of the formullll belonging
to the ye&n~ oru thowtmd begin wit~ artieulationa ,.. and ..., or 2 and 3, (e. ~
"Abraham aeparatea from Lot,"--lllnell\Otecimic word: miglltJ Jehonlt, or
3168 for 1168, and "Birth of Ishmael ": ~ ~2910 for 1910,) eono
fusion would have uaavoidably euu.ed, in the diecrimiaatioo of thete ten datel
and other~ that might be added, be1onpg to the eellturiea 2 uri 8 tboulaDcl

65. Therefont, to avoid all pGIIible miake ia tbit iutance, I have t1aoagll&
proper to adopt a 1ecoad rule, u follows :
66. ![}-'Whenever, in the aacred ~'a date comes uader the ceatu•

mnemotechnic word containing .ftw .-riewltlftolu, malriag the four lMt ouet

Ding the word with any convenient figure of the tea digits : thus, wbe11ever
we find in our formulas a mnemotecbnic word containing, for a dau, jiw 1ll'ti·
culations, the first one it to be dropped from the translation, aad the four re-
maining ones will give the date.
Thus : raaifictuion, for the murder of Abel, which gins 4.. 88'16. aDII
f~ cttre, for tbe death of Adam, which gives 8. 307~. will be rightly
tnoalated u 3876 and 30741, and 10 on fOI' the remaini~~g e~ tint fonoula
of Sacred Chronology. ·
JIBJIOlUKDVH I!IECOND,
6'7. The above rule of e:ruption it also extended to the dateaafter Chri#
appertaining to the centuries one thotuand-but we make it ad libitum, and
ay simply:
68. ~ Whenever a modern date, beginning with figure 1 or te, is to be mne•
monized, if we are certain that we cannot mistake one thomand yeara in the
reekoning of the event, and if we can form a more convenient word witll
only three articulations, we will leave off the figure 1, without any danger of
cont'w;ion. Thus, for example, we might mnemonize the " discovery of
America by Columbus," in U92, as follows :-The new world was no sooner
dmowred by Columlnu, than it became to Spain a great theatre of plunder
and • • . • • . rapine or re, pe, ne, to which we will add the articulation te,
and thus make 1492. But this rule is purely optional, and must be used only
when the four figures do not give a word as appropriate as may be obtained
from a word with three articulatiODII.
69. You have seen also that there were several formulas in the serit>s of the
nkct ones, whose flmemoteclmic worth begin with a Z£ao. Tht>re is no other
reason for this than the following :
70. In the fil'llt pe.rt of our Dictionary you will find a great many words be-
«inning with the articulation ae or zero. Now, as ~&ero before a number bas no
f&tuaerical fHJlw; no inconvenience can arise from making any mnemott>chnic
word with a ~tere at the bllginning, provided the subsequent figures are right.
Thus •tiffback, which belongs to the formula of" Lot's wife changed into
a pillar of salt," gives It, te, fe, bt, ke, or 0. 1897 ; Zero being null, the date
remains 1897, and so for all other similar formulas. Therefore,
71. ~Whenever the words in the zero categoriu of the Diction.ary gi-fe
us a convenient word for a datt, or any other numerical fact, except in the case
of specific gravities, and other similar numlx>rs, we will give the preference to
such words, taking no notice of the zero beginning the word, which cannot
lad the atudeDt into confucian or miltake.
So that, a m11etnotechnic word may or may not begin with a zero, according
to the choice of the student-except, however, in one particular caae, to which
th followiag ntle is especially applied.

JIOUIOJI.&.MDUX THIRD.
72. The JJAeicut datu being alway. recltoned BUO&B Christ, IUld the modem
am .4Pl'D Chrilt, it followw, that we have events appertaining to the years lt
i, 3, ~ 6, etc., btfore Christ, and the ye8l'l 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., qfter Christ.
Now, the atudeat would ce.rtaialy be very much embamued in the,translation
of dates mnemoaiaed in the tmita, up, at lellt, to the year !)() J for nothing could
Wl him, with .-ltaNti.cal eertsift~J, whether a date of 110eh a low number •
~' 10, 01' 20, would belong to the years 6, 10, or ~ Hj'tWe or •fler €lariat, iD
cue he could not ucertaia the fact from nMural r:eCflllsctiMt. We could not
miatake, perhaps, 100 years, but the be~t acbolv might be embarrallled iD
IIRKI.iler numbers.
A n/e was therefore neoetary to guard against a1l ~ible c&Af'"""' or miao
take in this perplexing eontingency. The piilrnopla:g of the system required
tt-Conaeqnently, I have adopted, upon the au~stioo of Aime Paris, the
-following imperative rule:
73. [)"' Whenever a date appertains to the lowr epocA of the first century
before, or the first century after Christ, containing consequently only two
ftgures, unleaa the student ia perfeetly certain that he cannot forget the right
position of the fact, he must always place a nro BEFORE the figures of the
date, if it is before Christ ; and scrupulously avoid placing a zero before the
figures, if the date indicates an event happening after Christ. ·
· 74-. Hence the origin of the zero found· in the mnemotechnic word of the
formula for the "Banishment of Ovidiua," who was exiled by Augustua, as a
punishment for his amatory o o • o o o o • rim, or 1e, ne, ae, for the year
20BoC.
It will thus be impossible to hesitate about this date-while many might
have doubted respecting its proper place, without this infallible criterion ;
since it is known that Augustus reigned for some years after Christ.
Had this event happened 20 years after Christ, it should have been mnemo-
nized without a zero before the date.
75. Such are the explanations which the memoranda of page XV. of the
"'principles" required. I will now proceed with some additional rules.
76. a. By the simple perusal of the formulu, you will learn the dates, or
any othE'r facts attached to each formula. '
The evening, before you put out your Hgbt to go to bed, and the morning,
before you leave your couch, are the best times, and the only ones which I
recommend, for the studying or reading of formulas.
77. b. It is totally unnecessary for the student to remember the phrase or.
words of the formulas which connect the et1ent teith the mnemotec!tnic tDOrrlo
'fhe phrase is intlilpensable, indeed, for this connection ; 1hE're must absolutely
be a rational link established between the event and tbe mnemoteelmie word,
but you will perceive that it (the phrase) does not need to•be remembered

tJerbatim, anti that as soon u ·the ewm ie meationed, the tmae~~Gtuknic tllfWd
strikes your recollection at Oftce. In fact, you will ~Ct~Cely have pronounced
the words" Invention of letters," before y011 will &.ft thought of the wont
(tAe tDhole clt111 interru]lting at once, tm~wr) Dimne idea I You aee bow
powerful, how irresistibly powerful, are our UIIOCiations I (daafcniftg appltlflft).
This will be the case also with the immense majority of the formalu. I
eay majority, for, to be candid, I must aclmowledge that certaia mraemob!c:baic
words, not as good as many othera, will eometimes detain you a few secondl,
before rushing forth from the aanctuuy of your recoliectiou ; and thia will
conduat ua to our next precept.
78. c. Whenever, on calling for a fact, the mnemotechnic word ab.ould not
.tart at once to your mind, this fact mull be HI andc with all the rebellioua .
ones, in a memorandum book, and read more frequently than the more
impreain formulu. This simple precaution will suffice to render tin! I•
striking words more submissive, on account of their ilolation.
79. d. In order that the student may not be in1luenced by the wording of the
phrue when repenuirtg his formulas, in calliDg the facta from the book, he
must alwaye wre the t.Uu COIIIaiAUig IM facu alons, and without looking at
the figure1, wbieh must be constantly avoided, either by doubling the margin
coataining the fii'Jres, or by covering it with the hand or a piece of paper.
80. e. The student will keep a blank book especially destined for the
fomwlas he may wish to make ; taking care to separate each dift"erent subject
by at leut one blank page; putting hiltory, statistics, biography, nomencla-
tures, etc., in dift"erent portioDJ of the book, in order that each seriea of
dift"erent facts may be by itself, and more easily referred to.
81. f. The formulas must always be made with as few words as possible,
never exceeding two liDes of a printed octavo page, and giving the meaniq
intelligibly, ao that the mnemotecbu.ic word may always accord with the
phrase and the event.
82. g. The event must invariably begin the formula, from the very first
word, unle• it should become impossible to do eo without violating the senae.
83. /&. The words which refer to the event itself must be always written
with diffwuttldter• from thoae of the complemental phrase ; and the mnnao·
technic tDOrtl must be alao distinguished by a dijfwent 10rt of lettw.-This ia
amply illustrated in all the formulaa of the printed "principles."
8,. i. It would be well, too, if the student ahould employ dijfwent colort4
illkl, thus, in this formula:
" 7lc latD gifJen at Mt. Sinai, makes us acquainted with almost every
divine •••• ATTiliBUTB, the italic letter•, or words of the event, should be written

lettera ot the IUile ialr, it allo briDgl into requiaition the sense ofsight u well
11 tlat oC bearins, in the memory of the pbrue.
86. j. Bat lllloth« importaat refiuilite, which I would recommend to the
ltudeat, is a perfect order and symmetrical arrangement in the writing of the
Amuulu, and the greatelt degree of plainne11 poeaible in 1/ae lumd-fi1Titing.
86. k. Fiully, a last COIUideration, which must not be neglected, is, that
the mnemotechnic word must invariably be placed at the elld of the line of
a fbrmu1a, aad coonected with the last word of the phnlse by a .~eries of dot•,
as in the "principles."
87. The student should always collect in one page, or more, if necessary,
all the D~De~Detechnic words lllone, of a series of formulas on any particular
•bject 01' science, in order that by reading oecasionally those words, without
ay ~ 1MGH Ol' words of the facti, he may the sooner discover thOM
,hich be would wish to study more attentively ; for in perusing the words in
this manner, they must tell at o~e tbe eTents which they are intended to
riJ1"'HHll, or elle, if rebelliou, they must be collected together for more
frequent perual, according to the auggestion in rule (c) above.
N. B. The additional pages XXIX. & xxx.of"principlea" in hand contain the
collected ~ic ttKmU of all the formulas given in the present lecture
88. A few wordl now upon the application of the system to the Ratio.

I refer you to page XV. ofthe " principles" in hand, where yoa will~ee the

93. The object of this problem is not, u I have said, oC ..,ecific utility,
but, as a matter of scientific curiosity and mnemotechnic application, it
cannot but posst>a a certain degree of interest. By the application of t1le
.ystem, the student will be enabled not only to learn the 1M figurea of tile
problem in their order, but even to detennine the place or ortkr of any
particular given figure 1 And it is in order to give etridence of this app•

of the problem to be numbered according to its place or order in the ae-

will answer 6, and the person asking the question will be able at once to

C. utieulationa, we will, for the aake of more precision in thiJ cue, employ a
•entmce instead of a tDOf'd. We will then make a Bfftllfnce with the figures ol
each decade-and this will be the proper occasion to teach you a new applica-
tion, which will give you, at the same time, the most forcible idea of the phi·
l010phJ' of a system, which will enable you to form rational sentences witk
whole roWJ of arbitrary figures !
99. Let us then suppose that we are to compose a sentence, by way ol
illustration, with the nine figures of the decade zero ; we will first divide the
figures of that decade into three diatinct numbeD, thus :
314, 159, 265,
ao.d endeavOI' to make, with the indi1pm1able lulp o{ oar "Dictionary," three
wordl which shall have such a aympathetic affiliation with each other as to enable
uatoforma1entmce by their mutual association. If, aftertryingseveral combina-
tioDI of words of three articulations, you do not succled in forming a sentence
that reads rationally enough to your taste, you will divide the same figures thus:
31, 41, 59, 265,
or thus:
31~1, 592,
or thus:
3, 141, 59, ~65,
varying, finally, the division of the figures, uatil you find, in your dictionary, a
combination of words, by which you can form the best poesible sentence.
100. Let us suppose, then, that we have been trying the above combinationa,
and even several others, without sufficient success ; and that, at lut, we have
hit upon the following division :
3, 14, 15, 9, 2, 65,
and that, after successive combinations of words, we have formed the follow-
ing aeatence :
My deary Dolly be no chilly I
me de re dele '00 ne che le!
3, 1 4o, 1 5, 9, . ~. 6 5,
as it is poaaible to give a sm~e to this sentence, by supposing a neglected lover
making a pathetic reproach to an indi1Thrent sweetheart ! (prv)longed laugltttr
and loud applatue} or, appealing to her wannth of the olden time, which il
now becoming cool! (renewed laughter).
101. We will then retain this sentence, with the perfect assurance that, what·
ever may be the prototypical idet~ with which we must aasociate it, we aball
always be certain to make a connecting phrt~~e which will answer the purpoee.
And a very little practice informtdtlting (ifyou will allow me the expression),
will soon enable you to make the~ without any difficulty.
102. Now, then, we will suppose that we have gone tbrough the laDle tediou.

103. This being done, it is now neceaary to discover 10me key, by the
aasistance of which we ahall be able to rec.U at pleasure the figure• of each
decade, in order that we may put doWD aucee•ively all the figure• of the prob-
lem, and from which we may hope to find out, at the laDle time, the place or
order of each individual figure.
104. The first idea which teeiDI 6o oceur to the miad is that of uaociating
each mnemoteehaio 1e~Ut.nee with the corresponding detwmiMting number of
each decade, by th& usiJtuce of a connee#ng pfmm, according to the princi-
ple established in regard fo the formulu for the datee; and, indeed, there ia

nothing-else to do; !or the cknonnaatirlgfigure of the decade, in this ~~
takea the place of the evmt, in the formulas for dates.
lOfi., We shall then be under the necellllity of connecting Ute tknOfiJi~
figures by means of a conructing phrrue to the mncmotecl&nic sentence • • •
106. But what rusociation of IDEAS can we form with THE FIGUJIE ZEilO; TBB
I'IGUllE ONE ; TilE FIGURES TWO, THREE, FOUR, etc., ete., and such sentencea U
any of tboae we have formed from the figures of the problem 1 • • •
Indeed, TRBRE Ill No POHIBILJTY offll4l«ng such ruaociluioM I Try it in any
way your imagination may devise, and yon will see that it is ahsolvttly i•·
practicable ! The reaaon of this impossibility appears obvious enough when
we look at the nature of a figure, compared with that ofan intelligible sentence.
A figure conveys no idea to the mind but that of quantity. It ill a thing with-
out life, without animation, without color~ and lies by the aide of a mnemo-
technic word like a cold dead body beside a being glowing with life and ani-
mation. It has, as I have already said elsewhere, no sympathy with the mind,
no adherence to it, no grasp upc.n the memory.
107. H, tben, instead of coonecting the denominating figure by its proper
JWDe (admitting it even to be practicable), we were enabled to mdllaOrphOH
it, u it were, into a being, offering to the mind any other idea than that of a
figure; if, finally, we were enabled to make of each of them a substantiw, a
IENSIBL'E BEING (deep attention), endowed with the power of thought, actiolt~
and q~etch ! and therefore capable of offering ideas for u•ociation-would not
this be rightly considered as one of the most ingenious triumphs of the system
and its already tried philosophy 1 (redoubled attention). And this is precisely
what I have succeeded in doing ; with what degree of success1 you will SOOD
judge-
Now to the rtUJamorp/waU.
ROIIIOGE.NIC KQUIVALENT&.
lOS. In order to succeed in this attempt at a species of creation from notbior,
it is only necessary to pronounce audibly each denominating figure of the
dccadu, and draw from the sound which the name of the figure will give us a
Ao•ogenic toord which will always represent a substantive having a similarity
in sound with that of the &gurc's name, and to which the mind willfo1'ci~ly,
inevitably return, whenever the figure is pronounced by name.
109. Thus, for example, we will take for the figure zere the rubstantive

110. I knew that you would at once feel and appreciate the real mnemo-
tecbnic value oC this beautiful and ingenious adaptation, for its importance
Btrikes the mind at a single glance. Yet, there are two of theae homogeDio
tnnslatioM, which need perhaps a few words of justification.
111. You will remark that tbe lexicographers have aamed the figures 5 u
l!Ye, making the i long. Now, when they come to 15, they changefin into
fif, calliag it fifteen, instead o( ji'IJe-teen, u common seose IUld the rules of
Gf'Udogy seem plainly to prescribe. Thus you perceive that they have, from
the height of their wisdom, done the 1ame thing for the figures as they bad
done for the articulations ! Why should they not give the same uniform
appellation to the figures whenever they are pronounced uncier the 6MIU cit-·
curmtancea 1 Why •y thir-teen, deriving this sound plainly from th-ree; then
four-teen deriving this still more plainly from four; and then aay fif46flll
instead ofjiw·teen, which habit would have led us to oonsiderquite as elegaDt
a pronunciation as the other, and then to return again to the ame rule, by call-
ing the subsequent numbers up to twenty :--A1:-teen, •even-teen, eig.U-teen and
n'ne-teen 1 Why make this heterogeneous exception in behalf of poor figure
five 1 (laliiJhter). ·
112. We will then do here, as we have already done with the articulationl.
We will rutore the true pronunciation of 15 to five-teen-which will enable
u1 then to trace in its name the homogenic equivalent, a fife of till, with a
alight encroachment, it is true, upon the grat~~marian's rights, for in strict pro-
priety we ought to say, a tinfif~but Phreno-Mnemotechny is too po'tDtrful a
aovereign for grammar to refuse to kneel before her incontrovertible supremacy,
whenever it should become neceSiarY for the benefit of Mnemosyne (laughter);
particularly when we compare the triftingnus of this infringement, with the
Connecticut Yankeeisms, "he don't know nothin'," (deafening laughter), "they
tDam't to homt," or ".4t luMln't ougkt ro !" (~l&ahlt laugkter).
113. Another of these analogies, which needs one or two words, is that of
the number eleven, for which I have taken an tltphant! (laughter). It may
aeem to you rather far-fetched, but when I shall have given you the short his-

114. The hiltory is ebort1J tm.:
I had been at a loaa, for a leagth of time, to .find an malogyfor tbia DUmber,
when one day, attracted by a pompous advertiaement of an "unparalleled"
menagerie of foreign animala, I happenecl to folloY the erowd, aDd entered
thisDaniel'• den ofmanya tiger,1ioo,etc. There was a"magnificent" erephant
in the ~ollectioa, which I wu, with many othera, admiriag, when there sucl4enly
appeared a ptllil fiUJitre oC the most laahiouable appearaace, walking upon bil
tip-toes, and inquiring loudly for the gigantic animal. As eoon u he had dq..
.overed the beut, taking out his qe-gla.• (!) Crom a mother-of.pearl case, and
-,plying it to hi11 eye, after having carefully rubbed it with his moalin hiiDd-

.lie delicacy,"Law! whata betw.eAiful (I) eleph-ant"-{prolongedlcugbtv),
ptollouncing it u near to the word ueven·t, u I poaaibly could have deeired.-
I had no 11000er heard tbil unexpected IUI4logy than, thinking of Archimedes,
I exclaimed aloud, "I have found it! I have found it!"
I had hardly uttered thete words, when a bystander, seizing me violently
tty the arm, exclaimed, in his turn, with the moat stentorian voice, " It'll mille,
lirl it's mine I and I'll have it; too. Fork over, 1irl"
" Have 'What, sir1" inquired I, with· utoniahment, while vainly endeavor-

from these homogenic metamorphoses. You see that the mnemotechnic

1rill immediately follow the last word-ao powerful is the UIOCiation (lt~ugkter
.,.d t~pplawe).
118. As regards the connecting plmue, you will see that, in this instance, it
il precisely as in the case of the dates. After you shall have learned the ratio,
you will have scarcely had time to pronounce the lwmogenic egv.ivfllem, when
the words of the sentence will rush to your mind at once. This I will
preeeatly prow upon your own testimony.
119. Just before you pronounce the last articulation of the sentence Aero,
you will double the liule finger of your left hand, or the t~uricult~r, upon the
palm, 10 that you may be sure, in the continuation of the operation, of the
tiUN of the decade whose figures you are next to write down; (and tbil is,
as you .ee, the first use of our nomenclature of t!&e lift !&find). As BOOn as the

W.AII'D-8Dd then the words:
.My low, I beg ye be my npph, will present thelllllelvea at once to your
mind.
Continuing in this manner to write down the figures, u you proceed, trans-
lating the articulations of the sentences, and doubling succeBBively upon the
palm the diJferent fingers of the left hand to mark the corresponding decades
JOU are about to translate, you will reach the la.lt figure of the ratio without
heaitation or miatake.

with his head covered with the crested helmet, where still floats the symbolic
glove of his lady's favor; hia breut bastioned by hia glitterinc cuirua ; and ill
his gauntleted hand his lofty lance ; and on his arm hia broad escutcheonecl
shield-Can you imagine for a moment that, to the proud and lovely chate-
Jaioe, he would say, with mincing carpet term.:
My deary Dolly, be no chilly!
(Aomtric and universal laughter).
No, certainly l But, proudly rising to his full height, throwing wide hi1
shield, uplifting his visor, and striking his lance upon the marble floor-in
short ataccllto words, he would simply say :
"Fair Dame ! my heart is yours-my rival licks the dust of the tourney-
do you love me 1-will you be mine 1-Yea or nay !-If yea, I am yours, et
cetera!-If nay, your obedient servant-and Pm-off!
(Stmtoritm laughter-a lady faints, but soon recowrs).
121. But will you have the proof that a hero would speak thus1 I refer
you then to Shakspeare's Henry V., act v., scene u., where the English hero,
among other honeyed terms, thus proposes to the Princess of France :
"Before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence. I
know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say I love you : • • • •
Give me your answer; i'faith do ; and so clap hands, and a bargain. • • •
I speak to thee plain soldier : if thou cans't love me for this, take me ; if not, to
say to thee-that I shall die, is true; but-for thy love ••••••••••••no; yet I
love thee too. And while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and
uncoined honesty. • • • If thou would have such a one, take me: and
take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king : what sayest thou 1"
122. I will not attempt, since time presses us, to justify each one of these
formulas in thia manner; they speak plainly enough for themselves : I wiJl
therefo~ limply read them in their order, leaving to you the care ofjustifying
them.

ing you to be kind enough to BDBwer, aimultamoualy, firat the llomogenic equifl·

aee whether it will be pOlllible to forget them hereafter.

125. The manner of accomplishingthis otherwise impracticable Dlllemotecb-
aic experiment, i1 simply this :
Let us auppo~e that a penon asks for the 53d figure of the ~eries. Yoa
• must recollect, u a uniwr1al rule, that the last figure of the quution indicate.
the piau of the articulation corresponding to the figure asked for, and that the
Jrn one or o~au, remaining on tlu lift band, indicate tlt.e decade-thus, for
example, the 6Sd figure having been uked for, you Jepvate, meotally or
otherwise, the lalt figure by a comma (5,3), and say, the 53rd figure is to be
found in decade 5, plsce 3. The sentence of decade 5 ia,
A laW Vai# or 1appy grape.
Now, if you t~Grk the fi1'lt articulation with TBB FOOT (a.ccordiaag to the pre-
eept laid down in No. 4.6, Leas. I.), and follow the articulatiOill upon tbe-fotgcr,
•f tlu LEFT JWCD, while pronouncing the sentence, you will see that the foot
fll'ticulation Te, or 1 will be the 50th figure; the auricular Se, or 0, the 51st;
the aflfnllar Le, cr 5, the 5~ ; and that the fiftr-dirtlJipre will therefore be
the rMdiuafotger articulation Ve or 8, which you cannot mistake (deafttaiH
IIPt'ltlfUe).
126. Suppoat'! now that the figure uked for belongs to a nallber exprelled hy
tAree figure~, and that is, for instance, the I 18th figUre.
Separating the ltUt figure by a comma, thus, 11,8, you will ay-the
ludred tmtl eigAtiMti figure il to be foalld in decade 11, plGCI 8.
The ~enteoce of decade elet~m is :
An old fDmJJan, a jiM miu, or a SHowy Jn~.
The manner in which this is performed ought to be particularly attended
to, as it will greatly facilitate the process, and enable the student to adnnce
without diJiicnlty.

CONCLUDING REIIURXS,
129. Thus far, ladies and gentlemen, you have eeen enough of the system
to form a favorable idea of its intrinsic merits. Yet, allow me to say, that,
whatever may be your opinion concerning what you have seen, those parts
of the system which I have already explained to you are ~ far below what
we will do in our subsequent applications of the system, as they are above
the .,.stems of Grey and Feinai.gle in their ingenuity, philosophy, and irre-
listible power. ,
• 130. What a di1ference, indeed, is there between the ralionali811a of our
'IIXW'tU, the mellowness of our j01'111ula, the philosophy of our GBrociationa, and
the unJ~U~~~~ing isolated words of the "Memoria Technica," or the irregular
aud uDSystematic formulas of Feinaigle ! Admitting even that it would be
possible to remember some of Grey's "memorial lines," what an effort of the
miud would it not require to get at the imualword8 preceding the cacophonic
eompound made of hil arbitrary cons011a11U, vowela, and diphthongs !
131. Can there be, according to the principles of our applications, I do not
say 1vch trouble, but any trouble at all in recollecting the words or the sen·
tences of our formulas, when they shall be mentioned l Certainly not!
132. You, will never be under the necessity of thinking of a mnemoi:tized
nrtBt to remember its connecting eentence oc word. Thil will perhaps appear
to you a muoatroua paradox : yet I will not detain you till the day of the
''second advent" to obtain proof of this assertion ; from to-morrow, till the
end of your lilt, you will have proofs upon proofs coaing to you one Upola
another.
133. Indeed, the poweia of our associations are so great, so tenacioua, •
irrelistible, that alJD08t every occurrence in life will compel you to feel them,
even against your own intentions.
1~ Tbe formulu which you have learned, and may learn hereafter, will
haunt..you laenceforward like, sociable phantoms (lovd laugl&tiT), inseparable
ghostS (rauwed laug/fur). And, in fac4 when poking your fire, in a cold
yirltef's neJliog, y~ see the 8plll'ks and the flame rising through the chim·

192 BB<lOND LESSON.
ney,-involuntarily the laot t1100d fire will bring to your mind the destructioo
of Troy I (loud appl4tm).
136. When, on the next morning, yoa open your window-curtaina, and see
the country presenting all around a mowy acem, if your chamber companion
lhould ask you the atate of the w~ather, you will iD.voluntarily answer him :
tAe battle of ZtJJ~~a! (lotul t~pplatm and lauglater).
136. On a cloudy day, do you see a IVn-beaa piercing through a DWI of
'ftpot' 1 immediately the erection of the first IUD-dial at Rome, will rueh to
your mind (applawe).
137. The sight of a river will remind you of the VJatery bed which swal-
lowed up the legions of Pharaoh (applawe).
138. Do you hear of a lover's "rejected addreBBes1" Involuntarily heaving
a sigh, you will think of the number of times he must have vainly said,
.My deary Dolly, be no chilly I (deafening laughter) after the first formal
declaration of:
.My 1~, I btg ye be my nymph! (long applawe and laughter).
139. Had we gone through our remaining illustrationa, I could quote in tbe
IllUDe manner numberless occasions in which your formula., once learned,
would force your memory by the power of their associations, to the irresistible
recollection of the facta which they commemorate. But experience will show
you still more than I can tell.
140. Yet, notwithstanding these incontestable evidences, there may probably
be aome members who will not be so suddenly charmed with the system. To
these, I would say, do not be discouraged; and always remember that, if
"peraewrmtia aemper f1incit omnia," it is above all in the applications of our
.yatem that the saying never fails of being verified. And to those who wiU
take no time to feel these powers of the system, owing to the readiness of their
conceptive facultiE-s, I would also say-do not accUJe the alow onu of inca-
pacity, for you would be as wrong in your hasty judgment 11 those who,
being slow in proficiency, should accuse the system of impotence.
14<1. And, indeed, history furnishes us with specimeDII of geniuses of.the
first order, who could not understand, at the tinlt glance, the mechanism of the
simplest ideas. For example, Newton, the great Nl'wtOD hi1118ell; was obliged
to tum over and over again the least complex questions, before he could under·
stand them; it was the same with the celebrated Jeaa Jacques Rousseau;
D'Aiembert the great geometrician had a mind equally slow to move upon
' ' ndi
any new question. But, u aoon as these glorie• of tht> human underata ng,
had once taken bold of the right side of the subject, no man could carry it.
comprehension farther than they. This peculiar deficiency in prima f.cie
conceptions of certain thiD.ga, however simple, has ever been llllligne_d as a .
peculiar characteristic of men of great genius. So that, ladies and gentle-
men, it; for the future, you should happen to bear a mem~r of the clus ayiDJ,

DOhrithltanding your own eTidencel', that " he hu not yet been quite 10

a 10perabundance of "GeniUI" (ltniiJI&ter), I would say to him, u )Juonapute
did to the Austrian ambuladors, at the signing of the "pP.&Ce of Luneville."
One of the plenipotentiariea offered to insert an article in the treaty " tJC/mowl-
edging " the French Republic. Cutting him abort in his speech, Napoleoa
railed his arm, and pointing with his finger to the heavens, said, "Sir, the
French Republic" (that is, our system), (loud laughter) "ill like the beautiful
IUD, which now, from the blue vault of heaven, pours upon creation its 1loodl
ot vivifying light: it needs not to be ' acknowledged ' by decree--«» much

.Advan.lagu Of Geographical Knrnoltdge.
LADIES .lND GJCNTLBJIBN :-
1. TsB three principal topics to be illustrated this evening are, as you will see
by the first page of the " principles" in hand, latitudu and longitudes, natural
and artificial ekvatiou, and specific gravities.
2. When I say that the applications of the system to these special topics will
give you a still more enlarged idea of its uncontrollable power, the assertion may
not perhaps excite your incredulity ; for I have hitherto corroborated all my
aaaertioas with sach incontestable evidence, that you have learned not to doubt
anything I may say-for which kindness, by the way, I am exceedingly grate-
ful to you (warm applause).
3. Yet, when I shall have added, by way of preliminQry argument, that these
, topica are even of a superior degree of intellectual interest to the most interest·
ing facts recorded in the annals of history (excepting perhaps some facts of
sacred chronology), and that for this reason, at least, not to mention many more
important ones, the study of this kind of foeta deserves the greatest share of
your attention, as being at the head of the most important of the general topics
of positive information with which a human being must have his mind adorned-
when I shall have added this, I say, you will, I have no doubt, once more be
1t1utled, and exclaim, " Again another paradox ! and this time a gigantic one !"
4. But let us reflect a while upon this question : What are the events recorded
in the annals of history 1 Are they not simply commemorations of the deeds of
men? ADd what do they record, with the exceptiouofhere.and there a few isolated,
solitary examples of virtuous deeds, but devastations, spoliations, depredations,

asaauinations, and crimea of all descriptions ! And what unc:erWptiee, beeidee,
not only 88 to the character and true origin of the great majority of m.torical
events, but even as to the period or real epoch in which the greater part o{ theae
events took place, at least in ancient history ! Yet it is incontestable, nonrida-
atanding, that historical knowledge is of great importance, as we have elaewhele
shown, and that the philosophical study of history nab among the moe& inter-
eating inveatigationi of the human mind. Now, then, if it is true that the uncer-
tain deeds of mm, with all their frailties, ~pMtMt-alitiu, and even atrocitiea, em
so much interest us, how much more are the works of God entitled to a share
of our attention and admiration !
5. " True," you will say, "but what have the latitudu, altitudu, and ~
gravities, to do with the works of God !" My answer will be formd in the fol.
lowing hypothesis :-
6. Let us suppose a rich man, very rich, as rich as any one o{ us woald de-
sire to be (hilarity); suppose farther that he should poaseaa a magnificent palace~
built by the most skilful architect ; that he should inhabit this glorioua ID&Diiion
without ever having known the number of its principal apartments, their reapec-
ti\·e poshions, proportions, dimensions, &c.; and that, finally, being asked t, a
visiter to point out to him any civen part of this royal abode, the landlord ahould
reply from the depth of his gross ignorance that he "does not bow I" What
would you think of such a man 1 Would you not look upon him with pity-per-
haps with contempt 1 For how could you suppose that such a man could rencler
to the architect of such a wonderfuliDIUUiion the proper \rihate of uteem and
respect due to his mighty genius 1
7. The architect I allude to is God himself: the DI&ITellou Jaa~aiOil apnmg
from his mighty hands and infinite mind, the world : and the unworthy laadlord
or tenant-the man who has no positive conception of tbe synthetic proponioM
of the globe upon whic.h he lives-of the respective locations of the principal
cities and phenomeaa which decorate and enliven its various contineata, eeaa,
and islands i and who, therefore, being unable to reDder to himself an aecoaM
of the glorious abode which he inhabits, and which he believes, besides, ia his
rmbounded pride, to have been built expressly for his residence-can not render
the proper tribute of homage and admiration due to the great " IHtttiowpr'-
the Divine architect of the world and the universe. The learning of laUtudee
and longitudes becomes, then, as you see, aa important study, if for ao other
reason; and a study 88 interesting at leaat aa that of historical dates.
8. But to look at the qneation in &llother pointof view. The nrface of the globe
is accidentally " decorated," as it is fwmily said by writers upon the arts, with
about a score of " marvels of haman induatry ;" some even call them 11erioaaly
"wonders of the world." Antiquity had ouly ,..,,. of lllese "marYellona mar-
Tela." At their head were, and still arc, the famous "pyramids of Egypt." That

ever riaell siace the dawn of creation. I beg you particularly to remember
th altitude of this great pyramid : 456 feet! .From the highm antiquity eve.
tG oer day we see travellers going from the four qU&l1erB ofthe globe to the B&Dd1
Maerte of Egypt, for tile IIOle purpose of adntiring this altitruk of brick and mor•
tar; we see them returning with books wriuen upon every brick, and diuetta·
&ions upon each cementing line, loaded with points of eJ:clamation! Their
eulogies, their admiration, their enthusiasm, have no bounds. And yet, are these
paltry imitations to be compared with the natural wonders of the creation ! Are
tby to be libaed to the mipty pyramids erected by the banda of the grtat,
Dirine, and Eternal Builder of the univene 1 Behold the glorioua Chimbora•
with its e&ernal crown of dazzling snow, and its hundreds of royal atteDdante,
from pole to pole, looking down in their altitr.uU upon the clouds which wrap ia
~ringfolds their leafy-skir&ed hips ! Look at the majeatic Himalayas,udat theif
lordly sovereign, the lofty Dawalagiry, whose altitude is twnty-frw.t' IMvlfUM

the height of tvJmty tAotuand one hundred ancl niruty ! Look at Mount Blanc,
the Cotopaxi, and numerous other mountains oathe globe-can the pyramids oC
Egypt heaped one upon another compare with theM sublime pyramids of nature I
Are not these at least as interesting objects of study aa the dwarfiah " wondere
of human industry ?"
9. What real benefit can we derive, except that of a mere satisfied curiosity,
from knowing the proporiiona, position, magnitude, and altitude, of theae monu-
mente of human tx~nily ?
10. Now by engraving upon our mind these similar~ of tbe natural won-
cleraof creation-what immediate advantepa can we derive from this bowled&..
apparen&ly so uain&ereating 1
11. These, among many others:-
12. By A:MtDing (by having them indelibly impreued upon the memory) the cl-

you will form a correct idea of the true configura&ion of the earth ; you will ap-

29. Yea!
30. How, and in what manner 1
31. The following examples will show.
32. Soon after I had applied the first elements of the system to the mnemoniu-
tien of historical da&es, according to the principles of the ·litnoo-ttumn-iMl• key
which I bad first framed upon the sublime Aint of Feinaigle (as illustrated in the
lntroduetion, No. 136), I thought, before any other thing; of mnemonlainr a
aeries of the latitudes and longitudes of the principal cities ud localities of the
Jlof>e; al1itudee of IIIOUDtaJns, cities, &c., from the level of the sea; apeeih
puitiea, &c.
33. Of course,aa will be easily imagined, the first thought that came to myJOiDd·
wu that of ooi&ing the figures of the degrees of latitude with those of the longi-
tade, and of forming with them a word, the first half of which would designate
&he latitude, and the other the longitude ;.so that no mistake could OCC111' in 1he
tlecompoaition. Thus far \he attempt Will snccesafol.
34. My second thoupt waa to unite this word with a phraae, connecting it with
tJ.e name of the plae6, whoge longitude and latitade is signified npoa the aame
principle before used in dte formulas for the dates.

37. You eee that the connexion of the place~ with the moemo&ec:haic word ie
made perfectly rational, and from this you will doubtless infer that the formulu,.
however Dwneroua they might be, could be aa easily remembered and recollect-

40. I ndeaYored to effect this, at flnt by beginning each formula with the
Ulfl6 of tile city thw :

·43. Coutatiupl~ contains &c., &c., &c., but I soon found that tlrU was ol
DO beuer anil ; for althoogh the name of one city differed materially from tbat of
another. yet the ifugu, inatantaneouely created in the mind by dte reeollectMm
of aeveral cides in ancceeaion, were 110 identically similar, with the single ex-
cepb;m of pHitioa, that it was impossible to es~liah any radical tliff~Nnce,
powerful enough to exclude from the mind the confuaing analogiea, which to0t1ll
perplex ita operations.
43. Think ofthe cityofLondon, for instance. Wbatarethe images which.ftult
at once upon the mind when we recall ita name 1 We think of rows of houses,
built of brick, atone, and wood; stores and pavements along the streets; the
rattling of cars and carriages going up and down ; piles of mud heaped up here
and there ; crowds of people slopping through the mire ; &c., &c. If we men-
tally take a bird's-eye view of the city, what do we thus see! Legions of
chimneys pouring forth clouds of smoke ; pyramidal and tlat roofs ; steeplea
crowned with weather-cocks-and, as the only peculiarly characteristic thing,
a pall of eternal fog, as thick, and black, and damp, and heavy, as the mind
of an Aonest criminal meditating a crime under the influence of a catarrh.-
(Loud laughter.)
44. Now think of the cities of Paris, Dublin, New York, &c., &c., and see if
the identical characteristics will not strike your mind at once-with the single
exception of that eternal leaden fog.
45. The only difference, I have said, will be found in their positions. Alexan-
dria will appear to you lying level upon a sandy plain; New York bathing her
feet in the ocean ; London in the Thames ; Paris in the Seine ; Calcutta in the
Ganges ; Rio Janeiro will appear to you rising upon a hilly ground, and encir-
cled, like a diamond, in a VPlvet box, within a majestic port, surrounded by high
mountainous ridges, coYered with orange-trees, jasmines, palms, acacias, cocoa-
trees, wild roses, and other luxuriant productions of the tropical sun. You will
see Muscat surrounded· with her barren prison-walls of scorched and rocky
mountains ; Constantinople unfolding herself like a fantastic fan upon the slopes
of her numerous hills, with sundry tlocks of wild dogs pilgrimaging through the
streets-as an only ezception; Rome ascending and descending the declivities
of her seven hills-all this you would mentally see, and recollect, ifyou had
,,,. them, as has been my fortune.
46. Bot whenever you would recall to yonr mind two cities by the remem-
brance of your reading or even of your eyesight, nothing bat the general char-
acteristics-houses, streets, coaches. stores, pavements, pedlars, mud, chimneys,
smoke, steeples, roofs, and weather-cocb, will flash at once upon your mind.

OltiGlft OF TB& BOIWPBONIO AlULOOIM.
49. I had almost abandoned the hope ofsucceeding, when, thinking one day of
&be aingular idea of Feinaigle, of converting the names of the kinge :
HENry into a HEN,•
STEPHEN into STIFFENED (!)
WILLiam into a WILLow,
RICHard into a RICH man,
EdWARD ipto a WARD,
and JAMES into CHAINS,
·and inquiring into the mnemotechnic value of this singular application, I put to
ayaelf this very propitious question :
50. Would it not be possible to realize some advantages, by forming into a gen·
eral rule this oth~r merely occasional, and altogether accidental HINT of Feinai-
Jie ! For it was nothing but a DINT in his book, as can be seen.
51. Suppose I should say, for instance, a parish for Paris; ,.um for Rome; a
mad-writ for Madrid, etc., etc., taking all along, in the same manner, a word of
6imila,. 80und, to represent each city, conventionally, in the formation of the for·
mulas,-would it not be far easier to associate with these conventional words, ne1D
ideas in their junction with the mnemotechnic word !
52. At the moment when I made this mental inquiry, I was on a clambering
visit to the summit of the cloudy" Table mountain," which commands such a glo-
rious view of the city, bay, and harbor of the "Cape of Good Hope." I hurried
back to the vessel with such impatience that I ran a dozen chances of dis·
locating my neck (laughter). I sat down glowing like a furnace, made a hun-
dred formulas upon this principle, read them over only onct!, and repeated them
oU without a particle of hesitation-and obtained from that moment the convic-
tion, as you will soon, in your tum, that,

tVal and 6CierWftc •OIINMlcturu, all of wbic:K are eeri.. of particular HAKES,
comes under the immediate application of this principle.
M. For the safety aod perfect infallibility of this principle I can T08Ch, upOil a
~ ~ of about twnty-two years. Yet if you Ueald doubt Us real
importaDee, you have had apecimeDs of the flaiWal application of the ayetem -.

whiela yoa may 1'11-amemoaize all the facts already adapted by me upoa ho...,

56. Perhaps 'orne members may object to the principle, on aocoant of the truJp
eoce~uric ODDITY of some of the lunMplwnit: tu~a¥• adopted for eertain words.
Yet if you will take the slight trouble of perusing the series of formulas aubjoia-
" to the programme of thia leuon, you will see that the .Gd.st of all theae
MmophoDic analogies are 1M wry e•e• which will moet rapidly aM. indelibly

atones to malleable gold and diamonds.
57. But, fiDally, before enteriagnpcm this anbject, let me agaiB remind you thai,
for t:&e original idea of this important principle of homophonic analo8iea, I aut
directly indebted to Feinaigle, through the Aint gi"en by that great master, ia
hie nomenclature of the kings of England.
68. Aime Paris has said, in his earliest work upon hie syatem, that a pupil ol
his, named Berbruger, discovered the principle after attending one ofhis courses of
lectures, &c. Paris delivered his lectures many years aflw the publication of
Feinaigle's system in France. I had applied homophonic analogies two yean
before I heard Paris, and I have acknowledged my indebtedness for the itl«r to
Feinaigle ; you can now decide, if it be a matter of the •lightest iDtereat to yo11,
whether M. Berbruger irw1111ted the principle or tkJoit,efl it, aa I bad doae, fro•
Feinaigle, and w'Mre in your opinion exista the greatest amoant of ~,.
Let us now illustrate the mechanism of tbia principle in detail.
JLLUSTilA.TJON OF THE BOMOPBONIO A.HA.LOOIE8.
59. I BA.VB said that the new principle consisted simply in changing the ltGIM
of the fact, to be mnemonized according to this principle; into a word haYing a ,;,..
iler sound, bot so nearly similar as to recur immediately to the mind, wheneYer
the 11amtt of the fact shaJI be proeounced : and it is in consequence of this m.i-

APPABBNT EXCEPTION TO THE RUL••
60. Hownza, as you will percein in perusing the homophooic analogies o{

Wu4ing'tma, have ftO homophonic tDtWdB for ilieir analogies, but the name of aa.
illumious IDI.D. It may appear, at first sight, to ilie studellt, Uw iliia is a devia-
tion from the eMeoce of ilie principle ; yet, it ia far from being eo, as a few worda
of explanation will prove, aad of these few words we will make a ndtJ, which I
recommeDd you not to forget, viz. :
61. J1J"'Whenever the name of a city-derived from that of itsfo~
110t aft"ord a very striking homophonic analogy-and one much better than that
of ilie founder himself, ilie student will then give ilie preference to tbia latter,
which ia, after all, ilie more ftalural homophoDic analogy ; for, what word caa
offer a greater similarity of stJU..d, than, for iustance, Ak:mnder for AkJ:CMritJ,
Collstatitet for Constantinople, or Washington for WasAingt.m? Besides a
greater advantage to be derived from this preference ia, that by personifyittg an
inanimate thing, such as a city, a town, &c., by transforming an insensible object
to a sensible being, endowed with a body, a 80W, and passions, we shall be cer•
tain to find in iliem a more fruitful source of ideu for our «ssociations. Of this
I han already given you most satisfactory evidences in our illustration of the
Ratio, which application was, as you now perceive, a sort of a1ttieipation ofthe
principles which I am about illustrating in e~tmstJ. And as you all know the
ratio by heart at this moment (corroborative burst of applause), you will have
eome ground upon which to form a preliminary judgment of ilie whole.
62. But to return to our argument. Contrary to the rule justlaid down (which,
by ilie way, I have made optional as you see) you perceive that Rome, so well
known to have been founded by RMIIulru, ~d St. Peteraburgh, by Paw the
Great, instead of having ilie names of these two founders, have boili a bomopho-
aic analogy derived from the BinUlarity of sotmd. The reason of this preference
ia, that, in the first iostarn:e it is not so popularly known that St. Petersburgh
waa founded by Peter the Great, as it ia iliat Alexandria and Constantinople
were founded by Alexander ilie Great, and Constantine the saint (!!)-besides,
the word ~taint prefixed to ilie name of the former city, recalls to the mind much
more quickly ilie saint of that name than ilie Muscovite emperor. As regards
Rome, you will see without any comment that the homophouic analogy Ru,. ia
far better ilian the word Romulua.
6a. Such, then, are the methods of reasoaing upon which you will operate in
the formation of your formulas by homophonic analogies.

65. For d:te aatis&caon of those who may wish to -.cift themselvea ia ma-
-king tOnnulaa upcm thie kind oC facts, I have subjoined to the "principles" a
·page of cities with homophonic analogies, and some of \he moat difllcult ones
without. An interesting problem on the "Pkysiological statulic.f oftiN Clmjugal
IV," baa been also added, for the amueement of those a&udents who may wish to ,
poadv upoD "tits d.ocatramu" before enlieting in the matrimonial phalaux (laugj..
u..). The student will also find a page of comparaaive velocities, the various
elements of which wiD doubtless prove interesting enough to him, to induce him
to devote a few momenta of his time to their study.
ALTITUDES AND SPECIFIC GRAVITIES.
66. As to the application of the same principle to allitwtl• and lfJiei}c gravi·
tit1, you will aee, by perusing the formulas of pages LXXIV. and LXXV., how
the operatioa baa been performed. I will simply remark, though it may be 1Jiloo
necessary, that, in the muemonization of CIUl metals, the word cut could not
.Jaave been 80 safely used as its homophonic coat, which as you can see, bas beeu
80 advantageoualy employed.
DEFINING FORMULAS.
67. In reading the formulas, you will have already remarked that they are
almost tmiformly made in the manner of DEFINITIONS. This rule must be ~
atan&ly adhered to, as being the most efficient, which a long experience has
&aught me by aetual corroboration. Besides, it throws a varitty into the compo-
sition of formulas, which acts as a substantial relief to the mind, tempering the
monotony arising from constant uniformity.
COMPOSITION OF WORDS IN LATITUDES AND SPECIFIC GRAVITIES.
68. Yon will have observed that the mnemotecbnic tiJ01'rU of certain fommlu in
the I,atitudes and Longitudes do not apparently coincide with the ftguNI of the
f«:ts, and the reuons of thia apparent anomaly must be given.
89. The words for Pekin and Madrid, for instance, are empty di8A or 39,116,
and Hriov• ._ or 04,003 ; for Alexandria it is miglaly mus1, or 3,130 ; for Paris
''"""'• or 4,82 ; and for London waltk, or 51; that is to aay,fiv' articulations
or fiTe figures, for Pekin and Madrid ; four for Alexandria ; tltrH for Paris ; and

71. We will adopt a rvZ. which is limply thia =~
7~. llJ" Whenever il ie neceaMtY SO-"'D9'P'"'ize \he latiwde ad longitude
o( a place, with the ~ OJlly, you will conMimlly keep the firn trDo artiCllla-
&ioDB of the IDA8JDOtechnic word for tiN latitude, giving &he rftiiiDintUr to the Z..
gitMu. The reuon of this rule is tbia ; the la&ilucles are reckoned from tM
equator to the poles, from degree zero to 90. Hence a degree of latitude caa
aever have more l.hao 11110 fipree. But the longitudes beiag 180 degreea aut,
ud 180 degreea west, can contlin, you 1ee, more than two figures, •ometima
lhree.llllisometimea-from 0 to 10--only ooe. If, thea, we tlke inn.ria61y tw
articulations or figures for dae la&itude, puuiug a zero ilefore the unit, when tlae
latitude i• below 1O, and leave all the remaining articulations for the longitude,
whether they be tl&rH, tiDO, or only oru, it becomes imJ1068ible to mistake the
quaatily which belongs to either latitude or longitude :
73. TMrefore, Loodon having, for its nmemo&ecboic word, acltla or 51, it
eipifies plainly that it is 51 degree• latitude aod .,., loogitude, since there ia
ul/Mng reuiainiag for the longitude.
n. Paria having r~t~t~~IU, or 48,2, is in latitllde 48, and longitude 2.
75. Alexandria haviag migity DWH, or 31,30, is in latitude 31, and lollgi-
tude 30.
76. Pekin haTing empty disla or 39,116, is in latitude 39, longitude 116.
77. But Madrid having serious sum, or 04,003, requires a little explanation.
According to the rule just laid down, it would seem that Madrid should be in
ktitude 4, and longitude 3, since zero before a figure means Mtki~tg, as we have
observed in our second lesson. But who could fail to remember that Madrid
being ooly a few hUDdred miles south of London, can not be, therefore, grazinl
the equatorial line! Indeed, he who could commit such a gross error, ftiQ8l
ac:arc:ely be able to read his letters, and must be still as far as regards the my..
terie• of a, b, c, among the uninitiated.
78. A license may, therefore, be taken in this instance without the slightest
apprehension of confusion, and the student can not fail to perceive that the zero
in such an instance must be null, and that in serious sum (040,03) for example
tbe latitude is o40, and the longitude 03.
79. I will conclude upon this topic by adding that, in case the student ahould
DO& be sa&isfied with knowing simply the degrees of latitude and longitude, bat
~ desire to learn also the min11usand even the S«onds (which Iauer I would
aot recommend the stndent to mnemonize however, as being of 110 practical iJa.

83. Having illU81.rated in so plain a manner the compoei&ion of formulas ia
the present application of the system, it remains for us to explain the method in
which the rcgio• of a longitude can be found, u indicated -at the bottom of the
LXI. page by a diagram yet unexplained. But before proceeding, I must explaia
dle meaning of the word regio11 here.
84. In reckoning a latitude, in order that our knowledge of thia fact may be
complete, we must know not only its degrees, &c., but whether it is in nortla or
1outla latitude-i.e., whether the city or location ia twrlh or 1ovtA of the equator.
85. Thus we say, Paris is 40° latitude 'IWf'th, and Cape Horn 55° M~t.l, ud
the enunciation rwrtla or aoutA is what is meant by the word rwgilnt.
86. Bm the division changes for the longitude, which is reckoned from the
fMritliart of a given place, usT or WEST. And we say that the longitude of any
sfven place is •at or tDtlt, according as it is situated ltut or tDUt oC that merid-
ia ; and in the fiHWd eut or west is the enunciation ordie np..
87. Thus we muat say that Paris is 48 degrees of latitude aorth, aud 2 de-
l"ees of longitude west (rlllftW, or 48,2) of Greenwich-that being the meridiMI
from which our dates are reckoned-and Madrid 40 degrees la&itude north, aDd
3 degree• longitude eut (Hrioua aum, or o40,03).

For who can forget, for iua&auce, that all cities from Pekin, Mecca, Alexandria,
Taagiora, aad Panama, in abort, that all the cities of the old"world, and all those
of the United &ate& and Canada, belong to the rtgion nortla of the equator, and
lhat the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Hom, Lima, and Rio Janeiro, belong to the
11011thern region of the globe ! Who can forget, also, the meridian of Greenwich
being adopted, that all the Germanic, Russian, and Asiatic cities, are in longi·
tude eR.St ; and that all the western seacoasts of England and France, all tbe
eitiea of Portugal, and all the cities of the New World, from the straits of Davia
10 Cape Horn, are in longiuMe west of that meridian! Surely, the literary man
who could not remember such generalities as these, must have a head and brain
aa quadrangularly shaped aa that of a certain learn1d schoolmaster who coulcl
not answer a aingle question, at one of my introductory lectures, from a pro-
sramme of some t!Urty latitudes, which he had been studying a month (! ! ! )-
and such a one might, if he desired to know his earliest ancestor, safely ascend,
darough his pedigree, vp to the learned and eloquent ass of Balaam (prolonged
laughur). It would have been, then, worse than useless in such plain instances,
t;o use any process whatever, thereby encumbering the mnemotechnic word with
~ditional elements of no practical use.
89. Yet, in the latitudes and longitudes of cities ranging very near the divi-
a,.g lin~ of the equaklr, and ofthe meridian, there are cases where doubts might
exiat, in the most geographical mind, in deciding whether a given city should be
in north or south latitude, or longitude east or west. Thus, for example, thP.re
might be some doubt whether Paris was 2 degrees east or west longitude, and
whether Quito was 13 minutes north or south latitude, on account of the extreme
proximity of these two places to the meridional and equatorial lines. In such
instances, therefore, a proc1ss by which the doubt might be exchanged for a
mat/umalical certainty, became absolutely necessary; and the philosophy of the
iyatem would have been at fault, had it not allowed the possibility of arriving at
this other point of perfection.
THE DIAORAH OF THE REOIONS EXPLAINED.
90. The proceu by which this problem is solved is simply this :-
91. D:F If you draw a perpendicular line, bisected by a horizontal one, as
-.own in the diagram of page LXI. of " principles," the perpendicular line will
represent the mlriditm of Greenwich, and the h.orizonfal one the equator. The
letter N. will signify the t&orth pole, and the letter S. the south; the IE>tter W,
al the 11ft haud will mgnify the region an, and the letter E, at the rigltt, the

region .ut. orcouree,if a penon imagiM• that he loob toward the SD11.l, the
ttJUt will be on bia kft, and the etut on his rigl&l hand.
92. Now, then, if we mark the fov fUG'Ur8 produced by thia diriaioD, ealliDc
region No. 1 the upper comer of the left, region No.2 the upper comer of tho
riglll, regitna No. 3 the lower comer of the left, region No. 4 the lower comer
of the rigkt-it will naturally follow, and be very easy to remember, t.hat-
93. llJ" The ODD uumbera J and 3 belong to the region of longitude wsaT,
and the KVEN number& 2 and 4 belong to thll region of longitude E.UT; now, u
1 and 2 are in the nOf"tlaern part of the diagram, which pan signifies, of conrse,
the northern region of latitude ; and aa the number& 3 and 4 are in the s91lthera
part, which means, consequently, the .southern regitna of latitude,)!? When-
e~er there is a doubt aa to the reGion in which the latitude and longitude of a
place may be, theftgur~ in the iio.gram cOtTe6pDnding to the region either of lat-
itude or longitude of the place in question should be added to the mnemotechnic
word, by being placed before the other articulations, and in the decomposition
of this word, the first articulation must be set aside as indicative of the rtgiol&
both of longitude and latitude.
94. Thus, for example, the latitude of Paris is 4SO, and the longitude 2°. We
are in doubt whether it is longitude east or west. We then refer to the book.
aud say, it is longitude ast, and latitude fiOf"th. The figure corresponding to
these regions in the diagram is 1 ; by adding this to the 6guree 482, we will
haTe the number 1,4.82 ; if we think that we may mistake in the deco10poaition
of the word by making 14° latitude and 82° longitude for Paris, we add a •vt~ to
the unit of the longitude, and the number will stand thus : 1,4-8,02-with whioh
we should make a word of five articulations ; the first would infallibly indicate.
the region fiOf"th, tDUt, the two next latitude 48", and the two last longitude 2°-
cooaequently west.
95. In the case of the latitude of Qui\0, we would proceed exactly on th•
same principle. Quito being 00 latitude 8outh, and 7SO longitude all, we should
put two 6tJTOU for the latitude, and the corresponding figure 3 before them, which
would give us then 3,000, 7SO, with which we would make a mnemotechaic word
whose firs& articulation, or 3, would indicate at once that Quito is 000 of latitudo
1tn1th, and 7SO looJitude -•t, which is the meaning of fipre 3.

the-
COIIPOIIITION OP WORDs PO& IIJ'ZCJFIC GR.l\l'lTIBII.
100. It generally happens that the specific gravities are enunciated with ir-
regular numbe111 of figures. Thua, the specific granty of
Platina is

Iron cast is
Sulphuric acid is
Alder-tree is

7·207
0·8
101. It is evident, upon a simple inspection of these various Rutnbel'lll, that in
the decomposition of the mnemotechnic words which would contain two integers
and two decimals, tJDO intege111 and t/wee decimals, one integer and tJDO decimals,
OM integer and oM decimal-it is evident, I say, that in the decomposition of
words containing such varieties of decimals and integers, it would be physically
impoesible to ascertain which of tile substances must have tJDO integers, which
dtw, or which one; for in the word agonmng, or 7207, for example, wllich be·
longs to cut irtnt, the student might perhaps hesitate whether to decompose the
word into 72·07 or 7·207.
102. So numerous are the eases in which this hesitation might occur, that a
f'IILI was a~n imperatively requisite, and this is the one yielded by the philoeo-
phy of the system : Any person acquainted with the meaning of the word tUci-
MtJZ, knows that a •wo anM:red to a decimal number does not in any way aug·
ment or decrease its mathematical value. Thus, 1·84 hundredths means exactly
the same as 1·840 thousandths (sulplwric acid); and so also ()-8 tenths (ald.,...
tr••) is exactly equal to 0•800 thonaandtba. If, therefore, we say tbat-
103. )JJ" Wllenever a specific gravity contains one or IJDO figures in the
clecimal places, we must constantly add two or on• zeroes, thereby making regu·
lady and uniformly tltree articulations for the decimals of each number-it will
necessarily foDow, that, in decomposing a word whose lut tltree articulation•
will be reckoned as decimals, whatever remains on the left hand will signify the
ioleger or integers ; so that in a specific gravity which has a .wo for ita inte-
pr, we may form a word of tb articulatio011 oaly, if we ohooee: for if, in liM
decomposition of a word, we find only three articulations-which, according 10
our rule just given, must be decimals, thus leaving aotAmg on the lef\-it is e'ri·
dem that we muat put •rro in the integer place.
104. So, thea, if we make lor-

105. Deep lad~• giviDg 19560, we will put 560 aa decimals, and 19 aa iote-
cera, or 19·560. ..
106. Di~HWc. giving 1840, we will put 840 as decimals, and 1 as the integer.
107. O.Jicu giving-800, we will put 800 as decimals; and aa Mtlaing remaiu
OD the left, we will put a •ero for the integer, or 0·800.
108. Such is the simple proceaa by which all confusion and hesitation may
be avoidl'!d in the mnemooization of any series of scientific or mathematical facta,
where the numbers are expressed by integers and decimals.
109. Now, ladies ud gentlemen, that we have illustrated the" principles"

would be JleC8IIU1 to c:ompate the fortune oC every per80il ~ faYOred by
bliod Plums.
6. The reaeon of thia dift"erence ia obvious : figures are the children and typea
oC dead r•GIUJ, and COIDIDOilplace awter of fact; while poecry, the euence oC
the itUGl, eoan alof\ ill the realms of the imatinUion a.acl fancy. Hence the
eauae of thia na&ural antipathy of" poetical minds" (laughur) to " statistical in-
forma&ioo." Bat we DUlllt at the same time r~, that ia to say, we m118&
Dotforg~t (laugAt,-), that if poetry " soars ahow" statistical knowledge, so also
araws and froth riH to the surface of the water, while the diamonds and the
golden aands roll aloug the boUom of fl¥1 stream! (applawn.)
7. And perhaps thia is also the place to observe, "' JHUStml, as another con-
traating shade, that, while Chatterton, Savage, Cowley, Gilbert, and Camoens,
the glory of Portugal. died of want and starvation---one in a garret, another_ in
a jail, the last in an hospital-Malthus and Malte-brun lived under gilded roofs,
trod upon the flowery carpets of 'l'lirkey, ana died with their heads softly repo-
liag upon silkea pillows of the northern eiderdown.
8. However, I am wiHiDg to allow that atumical amdies are leas t~~~~uing
than poetical looubrations (Z.,.Am) ; but it ia in the simple exerciaes of the
D&tural fuactioD8 of the memory---not with the as."iatance of our system. If yoa
doubt this ueertioa, read, for eumple, the formulas conceming " the statiati.ca
of the Uni&ed Sates, according to the ceJUJua of 1840," and you will see if the
mind feels any repulsive antipafuy to the learning of such words as BOWING TBIOJ[
GJWII, for the number of per60M employed in agriculmre (lovd applcatu•); or
DUTOf COOL CAIB, forptJrlfll.. ettgagH in COfffllllf'U1 &c. (IIJIPUutH). There ie
DO doubt, if you we~e to learn thejpru in these innmces, instead of the seem-
iDgly pr-.liMd fl1fii'M, whioh so happily represent them-dwlb to the phi-
losophy of the aysteaa-dlat the task would be not only 11Dintereatiag aDd ua-
amMing, but crushing and m~~rtyn.ing.
9. Yet it may eCill appear, to the " poelioal minds," a doub&ful qaesd.OD wheth·
er, with or without the" attractive, ingenious, and philoeopbical" applica&iona oC
the ayasem, the study oC statistical datea caa be altogether devoid of heaviaesa
and soporific influences (laglw): I leave the decision of this question to the
Gm&tftW of statistical knowledge, to uk more generally if the laDle indift"ereace
can exist, in any mind, mregard to the etu.dy of biographical cbrooology ! To
thil question I perceive a great many sparkling eyes ab8Wer "Nor Tllua,
while those who aM the lovers of historical knowledge seem to say that notAing
ca In IIIDrf inlen1ting t1aa 1Mf~~~:u co1t111ee.d tDWa illullriotu ~ the other
band, the amatenrs of statistical information seem to answer by the peculiar e~
prenion of their countenances (lauglt•), "Of what consequence ie it to me to
know whether a dead man, I nel"er knew, was born in euch, or any other year ;
whether he died young or old 1" &c., &c.

11. Bot to reanme the subject of biographical atndiea. Wh&t 80III'Ce of ill-
forma&ion, in fact, can oft"er a grealer amonm of pleuare, than the pera~&l of
tboee fonntai011 of Tirtae, greatnes•, bueneu, and crime, called biogrsphiee of
illll8trioua mAn T Is there a lltndy more intereeting than that of the species to
which we belong, in the great kingdom of nature-except, perhaps, the hiatGry
of the insects and W'Ol'IDII, for feeding which, we seem to haYe heeD maie T AM
if, as the poet of poeta, the Homer of English bards, say.-
" The propu IUidJ oliiWikfDd lllllall"-
whore can we find the beat opportnnitiee of lmowiag him, i( DOl in the miner
which reflects his virtues, his greameaa, hie basenees, and his crimu 1 Bio-
graphical •mdy, then, becomes an important branch of useful and general infor-
mation. Remember the answer of a great man, Rouaaeau, the biographer a•d
truest painter of the human heart : npon being asked once, " in e8ee of a univer-
sal destruction of all existing boob by some wopemataral. Omar, which work he
would save, if only one were allowed to his choice," lle repli6d nnb....UatiDPJ,
" The Lives of Plutarch;., and yet M had wriuen "La UHll. H.W. !"
12. But it is not enough to know the leading or general evenl8 appertaiaiogto
abe life of an illuatriona man, a •k which ia deYOlved upoa the r810Qlcee .C
aatnral memory more particularly : the dalu of the leading eveota of his Ji{e
must also be remembered ; and for this, the aame applica&ioaa of the ayatem,
whieh we have used in the case of historical dates, are to be applied here.
13. We must also know the year in which he died, the year in which he was
given to mankind as a bleaaing or a cune, and the 1l1JIIlber of yeara he lived ;
whether for the happineu of his fellow-beings, as Socratea, Trajao, Alfred tile '
Great; for glory, as Alexander, Canar, aad Napoleoa; or for the ouree of llle
world, as Tamerlane, Auila, and Alaric. ,
14. These three IaUer eventa are, !DOlfi! pardcalarly, the 100M important eoes
to remember, for it is by these data that we can ascertain tlae period embraced
by their exi~Mnce, and the age in which tlt&y lived.
15. Now the illustrious men-that is, thoee wllo 1nlly deserve that appella-
tion, and respecting whoee lives it moat intereata us w know, ud remember
these three clliferent datii--4Lmonnt to at least three hundred, oompriaiag poeas,
philosophers, conquerors, statesmen, jnrieta, paiDten, eculptora, IalJIIiciaDa, his-
torians, &c., &c., &c.
16. If, then, we were to make a formula for each one of these dates, theae
alone w011ld carry us to no Ius t.han niM lluadr«l' formalas, or rather maeaao-
tecbnic words, to remember ; and although there is no more difliculty in r...,..

17. By cutm~ a pee at dte first page of this evening's ,. principlea,., you
will ece a few specimens of facts ia biographical chronology. Y011 aee that on
the right hand of the da&e there are two figures separated by a dash -; theae
two figures are the representatives of each «J'eat man's ~~. The figures on the
lei\ represent the date of hie fllltiiA.
18. This is the principle upon which we will constantly mnemonize biogmpla-
ic.l clw~, namely~
19. Jt:rThe etadent wm always put two fi~rea at the ~tul of the date of the
..,,,, repreeenting the tlwrati6ra of the ~. ct1tting alf the figure 1, representing
lhe llwtultJIIIl, from any date in whieh it may suit hia coaYenience for the mne-
IDOMChaic word (as it is impossible to mietake a thoueaocl years in this instance)
ud make a singk fiiOf'tl with theae ttoo facts.
20. It will follow, theretore, that, in deoomposi~ the word appertaining to
any biopphical formula, the Jut nvo artict1lationa representing the tJK~, the
remaining figuree on the lef\ will represent the itt.te of the Jet~tA. Thus for ex-
ample, the word for Alexander the Gn.at being, mea• tDm'•natJn, we will decom-
pose the word, me, tte, rt, me, "'• or 324, 32, which ahewe that Alexander died
in the year 324, B.C., at the age of 32 (lotld applau~).
21. l1J"' Now it ia MideBc that if we add 32 years to 324, we ehall haYe aa
• reRtt 3~. tile year orAleantler'a birth (Gpplt~nn).
22. As it is more than probable that ny man who e-ver held a pen can JH'f·
furm the tJddititwa (unleB& his pe!li~e should reach the same original source as
that of the literaty gentleman--not the schoolmaster-alluded to in our last lec-
ture) (l#Jud'ltwg/iUr) there is DO abMlute neeeB&ity mlengthening the mnemo-
tecbnic word wtlh theee 1ut fipea, or orutakiag an additional formula for them.

33. You lmow what kind ofjH~ the immortal Galileo had to deal wi&h. Cer-
laialy they were far fiom being it-tmical or tqyiiA in their fiendish penecutiooa
of this other /wly •ag~ whom dtey so iDhamaaly CODdemned to die in prison.
Aad again, ia it DOt IOIDethiug wonderfal that Galileo ahoald die precisely at the
age of 78, in order, as it would eeem-who Jmowat-(loud lavg.\ur) to enable
• to baYe &he word/H in &he word expreeeing his age t
· 34. But it is more parcicularly in the four snbeequentformulaa, that this seem-
insfy predestined coincidence become~ more striking.
~. Yoa k.Dow that Newton made the three moet snblime diseOYeriea, by which
the human miad has ever been dignified, namely : that of the laws of univeral
gravitation, that of the decomposition of light into &he eeYen primary colOl'B, ad
that of the true path of the comets arot1nd the sun. Now the comets wheel
around the sun in elliptical paths ; ellipses belong to &he come Helitml, and are
a species of otJal. Is it not something man-ellously happy for ns that Newton
should have died precisely in the year 1727, and at the age of 85, to enable us
--claere is mo doubt of it-(laughm) to form the words corait: t1VGl in CODD.exioo.
with his death and age 1 (prolonged applmu•.) Obeerft that, ifhe had died one
year eooner or laser, our beautiful formula would have been moat ineritably, and
uafortunately spoiled (loud laug.\ur).
36. But what will you say respecting &he words for the age and death of Vol-
taire 1 One of his hundred biographers has written, letter by letter the follow-
ing phrase : " Voltaire died of a decayiagf•er !" And in these Iauer words
we find figure by figure 1778, 84, the Yery date of the death· and the years of
the age of Voltaire ! (loud and proltntged applmue.)
37. You have not forgouen, for who could forget itT (lt.ruglater) that after
Franklin had disooYered the way to " bottle the thunder" and " disarm Jupiter"
(Wlld laughter) he made a paper kite, from the string of which, with the aid ora
glass wand, he used to amuse himaelf by drawing forth shenea of a harmless
and cupilltu electric fire ! And again, we find that Franklin died in &he year
1790, h, pe, ''• or upiow, and at the age of 84, fo, f'fl, or .fire! (applstue).
WouldD't it have been really a pity if he had died one or two years earlier T
(proloaged lavgllter.)
38. But now to the truest of all ! Is it not a fact well lmown to alJ, the world
that the great Washington "did often show to the English troops that his mili•
tary tactics were not a mere teying baby joM! or 1'799, aged 6?! (~t aA4

4. Thus, for example, the sovereigns of England, including the govemmen&
or protectorate of Cromwell, and Queen Victoria, are fifty-six in all. These sov-
ereigns have appertained to eleven different branches, dynasties, or families.
Hence, from these elev.en dymati.es, yhiqh ~ k reprded as so many clun~,
and these 56 sovereigns, forming likewise 56 different species, arises a ntma~a·
claturt.
5. It is highly important in the study of history, 1!-8. well II,S of the sciences, to
• have the most e:racl knowledge of things, and their respective order.
6. But in the succession to the English throne, there are sovereigns of dif-
fwent Mmes, who are distinguished, however, by the same numerical appella-
tion, as Harold II., Henry II., Edward II., Richard II., William II., Jamea II.,
Charles II., and George II.; it theteiOre becomes essentially important in his-
torical researches to ascertain who, among these namesakes, preceded or suc-
ceeded the other ; and finally, without some systematic arrangement, it would
be almost impossible to distinguish their respectil'e .periods of aoc881ion to '&lad
tluoae, or the time of their vacating it.
7. Hence.originated the necessity of nomenclaturing successions of IDCIMl'Cb8,
as well as the successive gradations of planta, minerals, animals, and ocher ...._
ural objects. And if, by the aid of snch a nomenclature, we acquire the potai..
hili'¥ of ascertaining with infallibility that Harold II. was the 20th king of Eo~
land, William II. the 22d, Henry II. the 25th, Edward II. the 30Ul, Richard U.
aae 32d, James II. the 48th, Charles II. the 47th, and George 11. the 62d, thme
will then be no danger of confounding the respective chronological poeilioD of·
lbfir diiferent reigns.
SCIElfTIPIC NOMENCL.t.TtTRft.
8. In omer to arrange the reepective positioaa appertaining to the almoal·in-
amnerable procblctiona of natare in the..&nimal, vegetable, and mineral kiDgd011111,
the learned in all times, from Ari&tetle 1iO {}uvier, Brogniud, aocl Jll88ieu, ha•
always yielded to the imperative necessity of nomenclaturing-that is, of divi-
ding all the beings in nature int:o.claases, ~r~ families, species, &c.
9. Thus, Jussieu•s botanical system is (~ccording to the modifications of
Richa.rd Decandolle and others) divided inio 14 c!!LSses, a,nd 184 (amities, IWh-
jected to as many ordinal numbers. ·. . · . ·
10. So also the animal kingdom, according to Cu~ier, is divided into 4 great
div&sions, 19 classes, and 77 orders. Without the existence of these nomencl~
tures or classifications, the sciences of botany and zoology (not to mention any
o~ers) would be but a chaotic mass of uncertainties, or rather would bono sci-
ences at aU·; for how could we distinguish our path amid the innumerable host•

el ..aural iadividulitiea, cemptiaed wislrin the range of these, as well as· the
etlwt:r science•, witbou& the assistance of the exilting nonaenclatures ? · Without
them, there would be, in fact, no sciences ; and this is evident from a glanee at
abe ages when nature existed without the light of science : Rum all was darkness,
fl'¥1 the kiYeliest of nature's beings lived on unseen by man, or unknown to him·.
11. This, indeed, could noL be otherwise, as all the sciences hold each otbet
bJ dle Iu.nd. His jrMn their study, that was originated, and contiliUes to be
fl'OUoed, the material comforts which we now enjoy, and even the toreb of
~rilizaLion, which blazes with such progressive splendor upon the world.
12. It follows, then, that our happiness will be the greater in proportion aa
cbe study of the saienees is facifuated and simplified in all respects.
13. Therefore, the existeaoe of clusifioa.tions, having the direct intlueaoe of
IIUDplifying acientific researches-the study of IUJfrtmcltaures becomes to ua not
anly instructive and interesting, but absolutely essential to our progressiYe acJ..
"ancemenL.
14. The amateur of botany, for example, who possesses a perfect knowledge
of Jussieu's classification, will incontestably feel supreme delight, if, in plucking
a flower from the field, be can immediately ascertain the class, the division, the
family, &c., to which it belongs, and the ordinal number of its family in his
nomenclature. And so also with the zoologist, the mineralogist, &c. And the
aame ~y be said of the lover of historical studies : he will always feel a de-
lightful satisfaetion, if, on the pronunciation of the name of any monarch whatso-
ever, he can tell to which dynasty he belonged, the age in w1Uch he liYed, aDd
die many other incidents connected with hun and hie reign.
15. I repeat, tbat, without the knowledge of nomenclatures, there can be no
CGmplete understanding of any science ; and as it is impossible to master a no-
menclawre, and much oaore, several nomenclatures, witbout the direct and im·
mediate assismnce of tbe principle which I am about to illnltrate, I will enter a&
once iDto the proper explanations.
OBJECT OF NOMENCLATURES.
16. The principal objec:t of a nomenelature consists in enabling us to obtaift
Ike positive knowledge of two leading things, from which are derived a D1181ber
of oilier interesting queetions. First, a aeries of special facts being nomeacla•
~. or classified, to lr.Dow whieh ordinal number corresponds to any given fact
ia the aeries ; or a f'Mifllier being given,to determine which~~ corresponcia to ~

18. We have eeen, in om introductory diacouse (No. U3), tbato 'f'eini-
pe had eompo.ed a table of OBe hundred difl"ernt o'/)j«:tt, adapted to each ef •
Mriea oC numbers, from 1 to 100 ; and that a1e0ciating each kiag of Englud
wbh t1ae n...Hr corruptnUiing to the order of his ncceesioa, be IB&kee a ~
..cdug phrase, by which he &nites the object correapondiDg to that tNifltNr oftltt
nomenclature, with the homophonic analogy by which he hu repreeeMed 1h
COTN8pOJlding king, a& least, in some cases.
19. Thus, for eumple, to the No. 4 of his nomeaclatnre table (see No. 118),
he bu associated, as a correspoadiBg o~Jpct, a LOOD:Ne-GLus.
20. For KiDg Stephen, whom he makes the fouriA king in his claa8ifica&iea,
be ldopta the homophonic anaJogy stiffn!Ml; &Dd with the date 1135 he hM
made the word timely (cutting out the thousand years as supererogatory). Com-
bining, then, these three data, he makes the following formula:-
No. 4 being a looking-glass : ·
" The looking-glass is very much stiffi11ed ;
there ia a watch placed before the glau ;
this ia limely," &c.
2l. This is the idea upon which Feinaigle atttm~pted the mnemonizatioo of aD
historical nomenclature. I say itka, because, as yoa will soon most diatine&ly
perceive, there wu u yet in this nomenclature nothing systematic, Bodaifll
baaed upon philosophical reRsoning, no principle of any description, but a most
ittpnious Aim, from which Paris and myself, in oar joint inspirations, were
fiDally to derive the moat potent and brilliant application for the whole system.
There is this ordy difference, however, that Paris never memions the name of
the great harbinger in 1hia instance, no more thaa io any other ; while I feel it to
be due, and but just,.to acknowledge that the first orf!inal llirat ofthis grand~
ciple baa also been given me-unconsciously, it is true, but given, notwithstand-
ing-by the illustrious Feinaigle.
2~. Indeed, if you will take the trouble to read over the objects which Feinai-
gle haa given aa corresponding eqainlents to the olle hundred numbers ol hia
IIOfMDclature table, you will see that there is not one aingle instlmce in w.hietl
alae aeaecalion of those objects is justified upon any principle of reasoning.
23. You .will also perceive that hia fonnulaa of the kings h..-e DO replar
.,.eem. 'Fhe mnemotechnic word is sOI'DeQmes in the flliJdk of the phrase, od
lemetimes at the end, which occasions a confusion, from which no BUre remem-
~ of the dates can be .possibly derived, even after the most concentrated
~y of his formulas. You will observe, besides, that his homophonic anelo-
.... are noDe the more systematic, for he give~~ the same one to seYeral kiDgs,

;· 31. That the scholar may 'pretend to be well conversant with the historY ofa
•mpnarchy, he must not only know that sue}{ or such an event, discovery, &c.,
happened in the year so-and-so, but also that it was dming the reign of such or
such a sovereign.
32. He must also be able to tell-
1. In what year any given sovereign ascended the throne.
2. In what year be vacated the throne.
3. How many years he occupied the throne.
4. Who was his predecessor.
5. Who was his successor.
"' 6. To which dynasty he appertained.
7. To what number of the seriea of SOYerefgnt hiiMme corrNpOilda, ill
the nomenclature.
8. The year in which his dynasty ascended the throne.
9. The year in which it vacated it.
10. How many members of his dynasty succeeded each other.
11. And, finally, a given number of the nomenclamre being proposed, to tell
what king corresponds to that number.
33. Such are the principal questions, which the simple diVisions of monarehi-
.cal histories into epochs or reigns, have originated ; and which any man, who
·desires to study radically the history of a Ttingdom, must know, before he can
boast of being thoroughly acquainted with the history of every reign ; for here
the kings absorb the glory of the nation in their individual biographies (that ts,
historians have made it so), and as it is the history of a succession of reigu
which we have to learn, we can not, in fact, become acquainted with the various
events of each reign, without learning at the same time the leading ones con-
nected with the individual to whose existence or reign everything is made sub-
' servient.
34. Now, then, if we take only the events connected with one king person-
ally, we see that they are eleven at least. The kings, or rather sovereigns, of
·England, being 56 in number, we should have no less than 616 facts to learn in
·this single nomenclature, in order to possess a complete knowledge of the his-
.tory of England, or rather, the history of tbe kings of England!
35. Suppose we should wish to learn, with the same degree of exactn688 and
perfection, the nomenclature of France, with her 81 sovereigns, that of the
Roman emperors, that of the popes, of Spain, Portugal, Austria, &.c., &.c.: is
'there any natur~l ,;.emory that could expect to learn such a series of facts? Bat
·even admitting this to be possible, how long would it require for the lllfl8t phe-
nomenal powers of natural memory to accomplish this task ! And when it
should have been once accomplished, upon what grounds could the student be
certain that, a fact being asked him at any given time af\er, he could always
·Uiawer it. without hesitation~ I leave the answer to the candid ~tor.

be sensible of the mnemotechnic beauty of this adaptation of the principle8.
Yet, allow me to say, that whatever you may have thna far aeen, will seem to
yon u nothing, when compared to wlw remains to be seen of the power, ele-

150. It baa been cuatomary, since the origin ol monarc:JMee, to disri.nguiah
monarchs, not only by nomenclatural nuQlbers, in the aeries of tlte dyDut.iea, bat
aJao to mark with particular 1111~era, like sheep let loose in abe ields (lllvgkler),
eTery one of ·those who happened to have the sa111e giNn aaae. Thall there
are EDWARDS No. I., No. II.,No.III.,No.lV., No. v.,aad No. VI.; RtCBAJlDII
No. I., No. II., No. III., &c.
151. But there are also iinga and queens, as may be seen in Jl'll'e xc., where
they are all united under one head, who may be called sovertJigas tDitlwut AHa..
raymes. In each of these, as you perceive, I have adopted a Tlomoplwnic· analogy,
w\ich can not fail to strike the mind, as soon as the king's name is mentioned.
For instance, who could not, at once, remember a tall wolf for ETHELWOLF (loud
lo•gkter); a.~ead '!Dind for EDWIN (applaustJ and lavgltter); a luy 6eGit for ELIZ·
.&.BETH (tffllputuoua laug!ttr); or victory for VIcTORIA~
152. You will ·say, perhaps, that I have been preparing myself a ca11 from
Windsor, in my intended tour to England, as the "lovely Victoria'' may take this
homophonic analogy as an omen, in case of a transatln.ntic skirmish wi~h u on
this side of the water. But I "guess" (laughter) if she sbouiU Yer try the solu-
tion of the riddle, she will experience, as her predeces ors have done before,
that homophonic fiJOf"ds are not apocalypto-propheiic ones (loud laugl1ter).
153. If this transformation of the nngl•-fUIJitetl sovereigns into homophonic
analogies wu a practicable thing, it was not also so with regard to the king of
•imilar names marked with numbers. We have air ady se n tbat Feioaigle bad
found no other resource than that of placing the number themselves at the end
of his homophonic word. Bllt this was a radical imperfo lion, which could no
be tolerated by the plnlosophy of our principles. A moie pbiloeophical principle
wae requisite; it was necessary, imperatively necessary, that a key should eD.&
by which a dijfer1nt ttame might be formed for each of. the ldnge of abe same
name, without the possibility of confounding one with another ; and iuch ia
&he key yielded by the syseem in this instance. Yon will see how beautiful,
how exceedingly ingenious, it will appear to you (deep atte11tiole)••

various principles, thus far illustrated, to the nomenclature of the IIOVereigns of
England. You will find, on page XCI., the remainder of the lwmonymic word.

that you may be able to distinguish and translate them easily and readily, when
we reach the formulas in which they are imbodied.

161. If you now refer to page Lxxxvm., you will see tha& each kiDg i8
adapted to the number to which he corresponds in the series. A great degree
of obscurity remaining still in the history of England, aa regards the first Saxon
kings, it may be that this nomenclature may not exactly correspond io every par·
ticular to some other existing ones. But what I can PJ in its behalf is, that
among all English nomenclatures, this one haYing obtained the saoction of a
great name (the illuatrious Guizot), and having also been adopted by Aime Parle,
l have given it a preference, based upon too solid a foundation for me tore~
oC my partiality ; and, upon the aame punds, I recommend it to the student.

162. YtMt see that I haTe placed all the firat'Suon kings in a single group,
which I eall d!JfkU'f No. 1. This I have done for the sake of convenience and
eimplifica&.ioft, for I bow wen that the Saxona had no regular dyMstir. filiatioa
in tlleir ncoeeaion -to the throne ; but aa they were to be placed in a special
,group, to distinguish them from the regula1' dynasties of the series, it was u
well and simple to call it the jirll dynasty.

164. Two Suoo. ki.np having sapeneded tlta., daua Nrming a third groap
or dyruuty, I have denominated them nno Saxon kings, to ~b l1mD rr-
the first Saxon kings, whom I have called, consequenlly, the old Saxona.
165. Clearneu and symmetrical order beiag aD important requisite in mne·
motechnic applications, these distinctions were neceuary w a certain extent.
Yet those who may not like them, may perfectly well modify anyshinc to snit
&heir own views.
166. You perceive that the lut t1110 of the figures appended to each king are
aeparated from the others by a dash. These two figures indicate, as a oote be-
low the page iella you, t'M number of years tkat eacl sor1weip ocetlpied tie
throne.
167. The figures remaining on the left of the dash, indicate the ye• ill tolicl
each sov«eign tUcended t'M throne.
I::ICEPTION.U. &1JLU.
168. Yon perceive that all the kings of thejirst dynasty (save one, tlle 15th)
ascended the throne in the years before one thousand, and have their dates of ac-
cession expressed by only three ji&ures; while all the following kings, from the
15th to the 56th, have their dates of accession expressed byfour figures (see the
nomenclature table).
169. You perceive, also, that the figures on the right aide of the dash, repre-
eenting the number of years each king occupied the throne, are sometimes lift.
gk, sometimes dDubZ., and sometimea preceded by a zero, which, according 10
one of onr rules, is there for mere convenience, as you are aware.
170. This indicates to you at once that in some of our formulas for the kinS~,
there are more articulations than in others. From this irregularity, confusion
might then arise in the decomposition of the mnemotechnic word ; there migh'
be some difficulty, for example, in ascertaining whether HuoLD II. ascended
the throne in the year 1065, and occupied it only 1 year, or whether his acces-
sion took place in the year 106, and lasted 51 years.
171. You percei'l'e, finally, that, from No. 15 to 56, there are 42 sovereigns
whose dates hegira with the fatally rtptaled articulation 1 or te. If, then, ,...
were to make 10 maDy words beginning with the m.iculation ''• you see cbal ,..

We will then admit the above aa an optional rule.
173. Now in order to avoid the coofuaion alluded to above, aDd which might

175. It? The single fact that a formula contaias no more tAma FJVB tJI'ticula·
tioft.r will be aa iofallible indication that the king, to whom it belongs, appertaiae
to the Flll&T DYN.u:n, and that he ia, therefore, a Saztm King. Th111, for ex-
ample, a!fol cotab, whioh are the words ueed for ETRB:r.BAt.D or the 3d kiOio

remembered. The 15th king forma an exception to this general role-but yo•
will see that hia tDOf'd containing more than 5 articalationa, he wiD come under
the following rule, by wh~ch he can not be mistaken.

2D, lLLUST&ATION OF TB. J'O&K11.&..U.
1~. We hue I!JMtl that the principles fim laid down by FeiDaigle in the
atDei'IIOI!hla&iOil of fiOIMnclatrwes, eonsi&ted in representing the number o( a no-
~e taltle by a t:orrupMtdtttg equioal11tt, and then, instead or associating
the fact, and the mnemoteehnie fiJM'd, wHh the nomenclature numbw, he·associ-
ated ~ the ftMJt ud tDOf'd with the tHW'f'UJHitrUtg ~-·
186. Bot we haYe seen also how clumsily and bunglingly he operated upoa
this magnificent idea (see No. 116, introduction). Let us now see what power
'ean be derived from this principle.
187. The preceding table baa shown us plainly that, in the case of an histoJi.
cal nomenclature, we have tllree distinct things to mnemooize or recollect, wida
dae DOmenelatural number, namely:-
1st. The corresponding «JUivalent of t'M No.
2d. The naJM oftJ.. iing, c.r ltoaoplumic tiiUilogy.
3d. The nmiiiiiDUciaic vorl.
188. The formula by which we willmnemonia theee three .aopin will co.
sist ill a phrase composed of two members or parts.
189. The first member, or part, will always be ended with the A.nop.Wnic
~gy.
190. The aeeond member, or part, will contain, as uual, the ..,.••~
~~ .
191. Jt:T Wbenenr the student may wish to recollect 1he following enots
respecting each king, namely :-
Who was king No. so.and-10!
In what year did he ascend the throne !
Who was his predecessor !
Who was his seceesaor 1
In what year did he die !
How many years did he occupy the throne !
To what dynasty, or branch, did he belong T
he will simply call to Joind the t:OtTe~ittg mb.rtantit11 of the 11umber, and no
110011er will he have pronounced that mb.rtamioe, than the lwmoplwnic associati011
lllld dte mnemoteclmic fiJMtl, through the connecting plwase (af\er once being
U(lf'fled, of course), will flash upon the mind, joat as in the caae of the chrono-
logical formulas.
· 111. Let U8 demplif'y this assertion by a few specimens ; and please follow
acnr my ill88trlltions upon pa~ %CIJ.of principles.
193. Suppose we wish to know who was the third king of England.

And this is true to the letter !
My answer is based upon a practieal experimeat, whiob proYed a~

• But," yoa will aak, "is it, then, ao difficult to form aaotber table buecl Uf1C1!8
6e aame principle, with new lllbstmativu, and qualifying mljBCti?W 1"
206. Before answering directly to this question, I will simply remark, tUa,
Iller a pncrtice of nearly twenty years, and the pablicatioo of at least a dosen
editions of his work oa lis system, Aime Paris was not able to produce a aeC08Il
table, and dliiC the nomeaclatures of botany, the kings of Eoghmd, aacl of FraDce,
NID&m to thia day mnemonised upon the stnM nomenclature table.
He propoeee, in m. work, as a subatituto for this deficieoc:y, one or two JII'O"
ceases for constructing new tables, but as unavailable u they are oomplicatei
tad diJiicult.
·201. Saf&ce it to say, that, aft.er having tried, myaelf, for a lngth of time, to
lwm another ~ble upon die same principle as ours, wi&h DeY adjecaivee Mi
llflbetantive., I have found it tmpouible to 6Dd. each a set of new oaea u W.W
.., multiplied, without, every now and 'heu, givin« again, as a ru.k, the ....
nbstantives already produced in table No. 1.
~08. It was upon a full conviction of this utter impoeaiblity, which I hU 11M
es:perienced in my applications of dte system ao the Frellch aDd Spuish -..
pages, thM I boldly ventured to auempl the IIOI.ution of the problem, wbica 1
will preaeotly mention. •
SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES OF NOMBKCLATU&BS.
109. Convinced of the actual impossibility of formiog new tables with eew
11Ubstantive11 and adjectives, and determined DOl to use the satll8 table in the mne-
aonization of ollaM oomenclatures, I felt for a long lime quite diacouraged at the

210. I oevw coald lhink, for a IQOIII6Dt, dlat, at\er all that I had already done.
lhere was not SO!Ile JU&IW by wbich f1UJ and philof1114ictll tables might be mad.,
awl by which even the U.,eauily and power of &he ey.tem might be still more
brilliantly dieplayed. It was upon the elaboration of J,his pel1inf,cioua thoagb&,
&bt I one day bappeDed to put. to myHlf the followilag queetion :-
" Would it not be a pouilde thiag to cet out of thie very 8IJ1III nomenclature
table No. 1, one or more tables, which deriving, originotif18 from it, would save
tM &rouble of recurring to aay other original association ?"

220. You will at ODCe perceive the principle upon which this table ie band.
A •ery few words will be necessary to make it plainer.
221. You have seen that all the pwsonagts of the preceding table were JUa.
torical indiriduals, identified in some manner or other with the aubstantivea to
which they respectively correspond. When I came to the formation of tJiia
MCODd table, I argued simply in this manner :-
222. "If, now, ioatead of single pn-sOttagu, pluralities of individ.,.U were
coonected by duty, habit, manners, locations, &c., with each substantive, coaW
we not form a most rational table, still easier to be remembered than the preM'o
cling ooe !"
And it was upon this inquiry that I formed the other powerful table, upca ..
mechauism of which I suppose any c&rcher ~men& unnecessary (applau1).
TABLJ: OF TBINOS.
~23. As the title of this fourth table indicates, you see tha& I have takea tJ.
tMtags auocilded with the substantives, which form again an entirely tlutiael
table, though derived from the very same source aa the two preceding ones, •
~net also from one·another (applaun).

PBRSOIJAGES APPLIED TO CONSTBLLATION8.
227. Let us suppose that the annexed nomenclature of the constellations is the
one to which we desire to apply the table of personages. We would proceed
u follows:-
The.first constellation, or No. 1, is
The number of stars is
THE B.AM.
18-42.
Mnemotecbaic word for the stars is tati«'R.
And as the names of the constellations are all those of animated objects or
plaita substantives, which can better be associated with men than homophonic
analogies, we will leave their proper names unaltered, and say-
Constellation No. 1 ! THE RAM.
Substantive No. 1 ! TIB.
Personage or tie t GoRDIAN.
Formula:-
Gordian's royal ermine was richer than the skin of a
and his palace more luxurious than a common
J!AK,
tavern.
(ApplaiUe.)
THE GOAT.
28-64.
Coustellation No. 10 1

Mnemotechnic word 1 • iavalitm wczr.
Substantive No. 10 is tigAlsound, or
Personage of drum !
Formula:-
Dau•.
JoaN ZiscA.
Job ZisCG's drumming-skin was better than that of a GOAT,
to guide his countrymen against any farther invasion war.
(Loud applause.}
228. And so on for all the other formulas. By making a word of four articu-
lations all along with initial zeroes when required, two will be for the ancient
CODBtellations, and hH for the modem ones.

this moment like the generality of fathers, who universally believe that their IMl
child is unquestionably the preuieat, the quietest, the lovelieat, and the handeomeat
uf all, however homely, troublesome, dull, and ugly, the little "mewling and
puking'' creature may be (laughter).
2. With regard to this, however, you will soon be the beat judges. Yet
I can assert, without hesitation, -and without anticipatinr a single difference
of opinion, that waatever may be the phreno-mnemotechnic character of theae
new "principles" of the system, the subject to which they will be applied is, UB-
queationably, and ever will be, not only the most important in the whole range
of human sciences, but also one of the moat interesting, attractif'c, and captiva·
ting. It applies not to the works of man in their immediat~ tangibility, not to
the conceptions of man in their weakness and circumscribed limits, but to the
mightie11t works and conceptions of the omnipotent Creator himself, in all their
magnificence, glory, and sublimity-works and conceptions divine, which tbe
human intel~ect can not thoroughly comprehend in their accessible harmonica,
far lt•ss encompass in their intangible realities and unfathomable essence. They
embrace in their majeatic ensembl~ not only the speck of dust on which we
wheel so proudly through the field of space, but the celestial spheres, in their
stupendous magnitude and indescribable harmonies ; the sun, in aU the effitl-
gence of his splendor and glory ; the comets, in all their mysterious cbamctor-
istica and magical grandeur; and, finally, the stellar systems, peopling with ncb
- ltewilderi~ majesty &he vast and immeasurable expanse of the unbounded uai-
vene!
3. And, indeed, if the application of the system to such objects as "historical
.Ja&ea," " latitudes and longitudes," " historical nomenclatures," etc., etc., bas
proved so interesting, so plessing, and so attractive to you-what pleasure, wbat
.Jelight will you not experience, when, by the application of these new princi-
ples (so superior, as I have already remarked, to all our other applications in ao
many respects) to the most sublime of the sciences, you will be enabled to take
the easiest flight toward the unbounded field of creation, and the most facile
steps amid the otherwise inextricable maze of arithmetical numbers, without the
specific knowledge of which it is impossible to realize the full degree of truly
captivating interest inhereat in, and inseparable from, tbestudyofthe celestial orbs!
Who can doubt for a moment that the study of astronomy is one of surpasain~
interest! The ignorant, or the unobserving, doubrless. But a single hour of
contemplation of the heavens, during one of tho balrny nights of the summer or
spring, is all that would be necessary to rouse the slumbering sensibility of \he
most apathetic, and to chain for ever, in golden ties, the mind of the u11obHNJiRg
flaring a hoe of poetry, feeling, and religious propensities, however imper-
ceptible.

5. The orb of day descends gradually, slowly, it would seem besitMi•gly,
.toward the gliuering bord81'8 of the horizon. The atmosphere is 110 calm, 110
_pure, 110 cool and balmy, that the sun seems reluctant to lea-re, for other regiona
of unforeseen atmospheric fea&ures, the rapturous scenery upon which bi. lut
rays are now pouring such glowing hues of graceful beauty and majestic aplera-
dor. The azure cupola of the heavens glitters upon the ea~ with all ita virgill
purity, though here and there float a few diaphanous zones of silky vapor, like
the gauze curtains of a heavenly boudoir. The horizon, almost completely gir&ed
with a belt of mountain clouds of graRdly-varied shapes and stupendous pro-
portions, presents to the observer the moat photographic delineation of chaoa in
ita primordial state, on the day which marked the creation of the universe.
Here are eeen deep caverns, whence issue enormous pencils of multicolored
light, like the sweeping 1lames of a Trojan con1lagration. There, eolid oa
their bases, and impenetrable bY. the darting rays of the dt>parting orb, o&ber
mauea, preeenting a deep shade, contrast with these by their gloomy and Crow•
iDg aspect, while their summits, dauliog with all the radiant splendor of newly-
fallen enow, fatigue the contemplating eye with their virgin whitenees and daz-
zling contrasts.
Oa this aide a spacious bay, with winding straits, projecting capes, overhang-
jog crags, perspective vales, frowning precipices, and fathomless abyaeea, offer
to tlae view the moat accidented scenery. On the other aide, stretching out upon
the curve of the arch-bent horizon, in long and massive strata, irregularly super-
posed, they appear like a fac-simile of the geological formation of the contorted
crust of the earth. N9w they spread in undulating zones like the riband stripes
of the Florentine jasper ; now they stretch along in rectilinear bandit, and now
presenting a- glassy surface, they seem to vie in amoothneaa and regularity wi\h
the silken surface of the polished Parian marble; while now, agglomerated in
fieecy epota, they present the velvet-like appearance of large polished eyea of
an immense surface of white resplendent alabaster. A range of loftybilla, wi$h
here and there a towering peak rising above the undulating ridgea &ad indented
zoRes that surrqund their bases, stretch themselves along the upper stratum, aad
thus complete this geological appearance. But what words shall expresa,
wha& language shall describe, what pencil shall attempt to sketch, the va-
riety, the Yivacity, the limpidity, of the glowing hues, which, like an~

6. Ali'eady the laborers, bending beneath the fatigues ofthe day, loosenthe oxen
from the plough, to reconduct them to the stables, where the fresh straw, aewly·'
spread, awaits their return from the rugged toils of the laborious day. The shep-
herd collects his flock-his fleecy troop-to brin~ them to the fold, while others
lie down beneath the shelter of the protecting hedge. The watchful dog who
guards them, goes his rounds until well as8Ul'ed that no danger threatens; tlten,
taming several times on the spot where he stands, drops upon the turf, and etttv·
ing himself, after the manner of his kind, Argus-like falls asleep. All the seat..
tered animals assemble together at the sound of the rustic bell, rung by the guide
who presides over their evening repast. These reassemble and wait beneath a
wide-spreading beech (sub tegmiM fogi), whose intermingling foliage promises
them a certain shelter against the cold night dew11. Those go slowly home-
ward-taking in their progress a last mouthful of the tender herbage-toward
the gates of the barn or the farmhouse, whither gratitude for the care of a be-
nevolent master seems to draw them. Soon the villagers, with their lively
maidens, assembling at the sound of the flageolet, the hautboy, and the talll.bou·
rine, come to celebrate upon the fresh turf, in gay and animated dances, the end
of a day so lovely, and the prelude of a night more lovely still. The birds of day,
takiDg the last grain of wheat from the neighboring field, or the last sip of fresh
ad limpid water from the brook that runs near by, flit one by one on heavy and
weary wing toward the grove or thicket which is" to be theirresting-place for the
night, and where, nestling among the lea,·es, they sleep with the bead beneath
the wing. ll is at this moment, so propitious for their gloomy projects, that the
hawk with acerrated talons, and the cruel kite, redoubling their vigilance and ac-
tivity to secure the prey which the broad daylight does not always pel'lllit them
to seize with equal facility, are sometimes seen floating upon motionle88 wiDg
beneath the clouds. They appear immoveable, as if the better to discover their
unconscious prey ; and now they glide along upon a horizontal line through the
limpid air, tracing an undulating curve-descending more abruptly-and then
suddenly stopping : in a moment they swoop toward the earth with the rapidity
of an arrow shot from the sky ; they touch it, slightly grazing it with the wing ;
they slowly rise in spiral curves, bearing in their murderous claws the victim
which they have seized, and which they tear in their aerial course-uttering, as
their song 11f victory, their hoarse and savage cry.
7. And now also the flowers of day begin to fold their variegated petals upon
tlteir honeyed nectaria, gushing with ambrosial perfumes, saturated with light,
aod cloyed with languishing vo)uptiiOUSness ; W bile the more timid blo8801D8 of
tile night, as if reluctant to bare to the face of day the secret treasures of their
~t beauties, wait the protecting veil of dMknesa to unfold their bluahing

pistils to the sweet careBSes of the dew beneath the gentle light of silver stars.
The gilded lady-birds nestle within the bosom of the rose ; the brilliant tribe of
the bupresttl!, following their example, invade the shades of the groves, and retiro
in silence beneath the shelter of the flowere, the leaves, and tho fruits. The
perfumed cerambyx, extending behind his closed and polished cuirass his long
antennre, couches upon the jasmine, the honeysuckle, or the eglantine. 'rhe
acrobatic notopeda leaves the covering of his daily shelter ; the whirling beetle
closely follows them. Soon reflecting the heavens upon earth, thousands of
glow-worms and myriads of fireflies, scintillating like phantoms of wandering
stars, succeed them in the silent empire of Flora. The phaltEnce, like fugith·e
humming-birds, seek upon their light and rapid wings the nectar of the bella-
donna just opening to the pearly drops of the dew ; while the butterflies, \Vith
hues as varied as resplemfent, intoxicated wtth the sweets of a thousand flower~,
and the voluptuous pleasures of the day, flit upon faint and languishing wingH
from flower to flower, giving them in parting a farewell kiss of love and hope.
There is one, bending beneath the irresistible influence of a somnolent inebri-
ation of sweet perfumes and floral ambrosia, who seeks a resting-place within
the lo,•ely corolla of a flower scarce open to the night, whose bending stem,
too feeble to sustain her reeling invader, curves beneath the weight of his airy
wings; the butterfly, collecting all his t>nergy, clings closely to the trembling
petals, shaking heavily his wings, and endeavoring to balance himself. But the
timid flower, as if shrinking from his abrupt caress, seems in her outraged mod-
esty to repress him with affright, while tremblingly agitating her elastic stem,
which rocks him in gentle cadence. From this contest of love and ambrosial
intoxication there results a most beautiful and graceful phenomenon. The golden
pollen detached from the antherre by the shaking pinions of the butterfly, and
mingled with the dust of pearl, of emerald, and of gems of a thousand varic!l
hues shaken from the wings of the luxurious insect, rises in an iris-cloud, which
envelopes her with her inebriated guest in its prismatic reflections, as if in the
midst of a brilliant aerial rainbow, which is revived from moment to moment by
a fugitive ray of light escaping horizontally from the interstices of a diaphanous
cloud.
But the sun now rapidly advances toward the bordering line of the horizon.
His pencil-rays, flashing above and beneath the mountainous clouds, appear like
sheaves of multicolored flame springing up in awful majesty from the bosom of
a Titanic volcano. The heavens appear to glitter with the bright blaze of a de-
vouring conftagration. Presently the sun, becoming visible through a vast open·
ing, burns before the beholder like an incandescent sphere of molten metal ; his
bulk, immensely magnified, pours forth a flood of intense scarlet light, which for
a while fills the whole concave of the sky. At this moment, his lower edge dips.
into the liquid surface of the lake. He seems to hesitate and pause a while, as

Half his disc has aheady ~sappeared ; and aa he descends, he seems to mag-
nify• hie orb, and swell his bulk, u if to prolong his preaence beyond hia allot-
&ed hour in the magic scene, which soon muat TlUiiah with himself. Myriada of
ephemeral insects, whose existence begins and ends between the roaea of two Au-
roras, conscious, it would seem, that they shall no more feel the vivifying raya of
lhe day-king, aasemble everywhere in long and innumerable columns, u if re·
solved to pass awaytogether; they coYer the fields with their dittingshadowa, per-
forming a thouaand evolutions in their death-dance-stretching upward and doWD-
ward, hither and thither, scauering, combining, and scattering again-destined
in a few moments to vanish, never moro to sport in the sunlight. Aa if to hasten
their ephemeral destiny, numbers of darting swallows, whistling in their joyoua
flight, pass through the mobile crowds, seizing the victims in their path, with
which to feed their little ones. Emblem of the indifference of the living to the
fate of the dead !-no sooner has the messenger of death thinned their dancinj[
hosts, than the survivors unite again, once more to dance on lighter wings.
Already tho eastern side of the heavenly vault presents a few silvery stars
upon its dark-blue concave. The sun hides himself below the horizon. The
brilliant colors which painted the clouds fade away gradually; they change,
•~hameleon-like, from tint to tint, to fainter and fainter hues, presenting succes-
sively all the irises of a thousand chromatic prisms. By-and-by, only their lof-
tier summits and weatward edl{es reflect for a little longer the evanescing hues
of the evanescent sun ; while the gray mantle of night, growing darker and
darker, gradually folds around their bases, soon to wrap them in its drapery of
darkness. Now the scene changes. The heavens assume a new and still more
variegated appearance. The clouds, breaking gradually into fragments of every
variety of form and size, offer in turns pictures of the most fantastic character.
Here are aeen monsters of the most formidable and massive structurea springing
up into a sort of existence, again to paas into new shapes and revive under new
developments. There, slowly arise threatening towers, impenetrable walls,
dungeons, bastions, and lofty ramparts, in gigantic proportion•. Again, ruins of
the most stupendous aspect rear their broken columns, and moss-grown porticoes,
and deserted fanes. These vanish in their turn. Insect forms, covering whole
acres of the sky, as they are magnified on a colossal scale, are ready to be
crushed beneath the impending weight of ossaic mountains. Pigmy chariots are
drawn by mammoth monsters ; aquatic leviathans fly with the wings of birds,
and birds are seen diving into transparent ocean-lakes ; while farther on, like

8. But at length the twilight sends forth its last opal hues, and the sun enters
into new kingdoms, strewed with roses of Aurora and the dewy pearls of other
skies. Nature retires within the dark veil of night, until the return of him in
whose presence night can not stand, and before whose glance she must flee to
other realms, there to enjoy her temporary reign. The clouds, which so thickly
and fantastically strewed the blue horizon, now gradually vanish. As they de-
part in silence, the stars appear, one by one, upon the dark firmament, twinkling
like diamonds. Soon the constellations, kindling their smaller stars, shine forth
in all their glory ; and the vacillating light is showered upon the earth of ten
thousand myriads of myriads of worlds. What majestic scenery ! What glori-
ous evidence of the greatness, wisdom, goodness, design, and power, of Him
from whose omnipotence sprang forth io the beginning of time such a tremen--
dous agglomeration of worlds, of suns, and circling systems ! What overwhelm-

The growing silence, which now per\·ades the scene, renders it still more
impressive and captivating. The laet vibrating notes of the shepherd's rustic
music, and the gay maiden's last word of the carol sung in the parting chorus,
have long ceased to rouse the neighboring echoes. Man is now enjoying
the benefits of reinvigorating slumbers. Ambition, perhaps, alone watches,
while all others repose and roam in fancy through the region of rapturous
clreams.
The whistrmg crickets and the humming insects of the darkness are the sole
beings in nature whose monotonous whisperings, here and there, interrupt the
dumbness of the night. A white owl now and then flies swiftly by, like the
treacherous ghost of a wicked spirit, from one thicket to another, in search of it•
alambering prey, wb.ich cioubtless little dreams of tb.e cruel fate that awana it.

duced by oilr East aod Weat Indiee must indeed be far from approaehing fn rich-
Mu, ex.ceDeuce, and magnificence, the various productiona of a planet swim-
ming within the unlimited influence of this sublime focus of uniTeraallife. The
vegetables which receive this invigorating lip and warmth must arrive at a
degree of development and of perfection to which nothing we can conceive can
poeaibly be compared. The sugar-cane must atlftin the altitude of the gigantic
bamboos of the Ganges; and the vanilla-vines, the beans of which exhale such
aweet perfumes, must extend their flexible branches through the forests as far as
the wild vines of South America. The energies of nature, which appear to
have arrived at the culminating point in the torrid zone of our earth, have proba-
bly been bounded by the inadeqnacy of the sun to earry them farther. But, m
the planet Mercury, they must form with him new aeries of harmonies, and pro·
duce in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoma, a multitude of new speci..
of beings, ualmown to our Linotenaes and Cuviera. The fortunate inhabitants
are therefore not compelled, as we are, to suatain life by the sacrifice of innocent
animals, or even to stoop to the rude Iabore of agriculture ; for fruita, a thouaand
times more delicious than those of our most cultivated orchards, must grow spon-
taneously upon a planet whose poles, by their genial temperature, may bear the
flgs of Attica and the oranges of Brazil. If we may judge of the manners and
customs of the inhabitants of this luxuriant planet by those of the nationa wh•
have lived under the happiest and most charming latitudea of the earth, they
IDUit resemble those of the gods and wise Ethiopius, on whom, as Homer
feigns, Jupiter used to cast his eyes to relieve them from the horrid contempla·
tion of the Greek and Trojan wars. Amid a never-failing abunda11ce of the
richest productions of nature, they ml18t live as happily as the Indian sages ol

YOlume is nearly as great as that of our earth-it being as 90 to 100. Her di-
ameter is ltvlll tlwtutmd """' lav11dr~d aftd forty miles ; her circumference
about ttD~nty-tlw" t!w.1artd tfiHJ l&ultdred; and her siiJ'face comprises mote than

at the rate of two hundred and seventy-seven inhabitants for each square mile,
weuld afford room for a population of more than forty_,.;,., tltouta11d eiglat hundr1d
madjifJI millions of living beings !-or nearly fifty thousand-times more than those
MID scattered upon the yet unpeopled eolitodes of the world. The dazzling light
which marks her ethereal path, and which she pours forth in such radiant sih·er
atreams, emanates from the sun, like that of all the other planets of his sub-
atellar empire. The same immoveable surface of her resplendent orb seem!!
ever preaent to our view ; and yet she wheels upon herself, making a revolutioR
every twenty-three hours and a half, and presenting to the obaerver all the differ-
Rt meridians of her varied regions. By the periodicity of this diurnal motion,
mountains far higher than our Chimborazos and Himmalayaa have been ob-
eerved upon her accidented surface. Her speciJic density, differing but very
lliightly from that of the earth, which equals luavy spar, is compared to molyb-
clMum. She appears just bordering upon the verge of the horizon, and yet her
aearest approach to the earth is never less than ltoenty-fitJe million• of miles-a
clistance which, at the rate of twenty miles per hour, could not be travelled in
,., Ta.ndred and forty-eiglal years! Finally, were there no modifications in the
auno.pheric constitution of the planet, the degree of light experienced upon her
nrface would be nearly twice as much as that upon our globe, and the disc of
du! sun must appear to her happy and voluptuous inhabitants twice as large as
it does to us.
13. If Mercury was considered by the ancients as the planet of the sciences
~d wit, Venus bas been considered in all times as the planet of amatory inftu-
aees. She owes this character to her vivid light, being the moat resplendent
planet twinkling in the solar system. When she prec1dls the rising sun, she
takes in poetical language the name, given her by the ancients, of Lucifer, or the
Liglat-'61arer, while at this time the popular name of mM'fting •tar is applied to
her by the prosaic modems. When, as in the moment of our contemplation, abe
follows the setting sun, by alternate inverted positions in her orbit, poetry gives
· her the name of Ve.rper, or the lfJmtiRg star-a wrong appellation in both in-
atances-Ven011 being a planet, not a star. Observation seems to have ascer-
tained that not only mountains, of far rreater altitude than those of our own globe,
riae from the level of her seas, but that her whole surface is diveraiJied by in-
1NID8rable elevations of considerable altitude. If we suppose her atmosphere
to be no more extensive than our own, and of the same physical constitution,
tbele eminences must be crowned with reflecting pyramids of ice and snow.

offer to the view the moat magnificent and the moat lively scenery. Let ua fucy

14. But the darkness of the night having attained its deepest ebony hue, let
us now face the southern regions of the heavens :-
" Lo ! what a glorious sight appears
To oar admiring eyes I"
In tracing a circular line from the east~rn to the western horizon, at an alti-
tude of about twenty-five degrees, we will perceive, at this moment, the four
contiguous zodiacal constellations-Pisces, Aquarius, Capricornus, Sagittarius,
and a part of Scorpio-spanning the whole breadth of the zodiac from the left to
the right. And now, amid the host of stars which people these constellations,
no less than four of the principal planets of the solar system, and one of the as-
teroids, are seen concentrated within the limits of the first four, journeying thus,
"in solemn silence," on tlu same side of t!&e firmament ! These celestial wan-
derers are Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, visible to the naked eye ; Uranus and Juno,
visible with the telescope ; which, with their seventeen satellites, and the moon,
which will soon join them, will present to our contemplative admiration the rare
and interesting spectacle of twenty-two planetary orba, or worlds, visible from the
earth on the same side of the celestial canopy.
15. A little to the right, in Sagittarius, between the zenith and the horizon,
and on a line of elevation forming, with the plane of the ecliptic, an angle oC
about twenty-three degrees, is seen, isolated as it were upon the sable mantle
of the sky, a magnificent luminary, shining with a brilliant and somewhat red-
dish light. This is the planet Mars, the orbit of which is next beyond tha& of
\be earth, in the planetary positions, at the distance of about OM /a#ndr11d IJ1Itf·
f,-ty-two millions, eiglat launclrtd and forty t/wusand miles from the san. On his
right, in Scorpio, is the first-magnitude star Antares, at a small altitude from the
western horizon, rivalling him in splendor.

midway between the :zeDith and the horizon,of a brilliancy considerably superior
10 that of either Man or Antares, aad to which nothing that offers itself to the
contemplation of man in the starry firmament can compare, with the exception
of Venua, when, in quadrature with the earth. she outshine& with her dazzlinc

• wheel the four asteroids Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas, around the central lu-
minary, in their celestial ineognita, through the silent field of immensity.
,.
17. Between Jupiter and the horizon, in Pisces, would be eeen Uranus, with
the help of a powerful telescope. The stupendous and incomprehensible dis-
tance which separates it from the sun prevents us from distinguishing it with
the naked eye, although its majestic orb is not less than seventy-seven times
larger than our globe. The mean distance of Uranus from the sun being ,.
billion, seven hundred and ninety-seven millions, nine hundred and mty-tllree thou-
sand, one hundred and twenty-two miles-to pass over this incomprehensible
space, a locomotive, travelling at the rat!'! of twenty miles per hour, would re-
quire no less than nine thousand seven laundred and thirty years, two mont/as,
eiglateen days, twenty laours, nine minutes, and fifty-seven seconds ! In the direc-
tion of Mars, on the same imaginary curved line, at nearly two thirds the dis-
tance from Jupiter, is seen, in Capricornu6, another luminary of a size equal to
tbat of a star of the first magnitude, but easily distinguishable from a star, in
this respect, that the planet shines with a calm and unchangeable light, while
the fixed stars are characterized by their twinkling or vacillating brilliancy-
This is Saturn, the most wonderful and most sublime in its structure and tele-
scopic appearance of all the planetary orbs which we have as yet aUentively
surveyed in the solar dominions. Its mean distance from the sun is about eignt
hurulred mad ninety-fqur miUions, si:r hundred arul nine t/aousand miles.
18. Presently, as we face the southern part of the heavens, this wonderful
planet, with its seven satellites and its concentric rings, will appear directly
before us : Jupiter, with its four attendant moons, on the left, shining with daz-
zling splendor; Juno, in the vicinity of Saturn; Ma!'8 on the right, reflecting a
light of a deep red hue; Uranus, with its six satellites, between Jupiter and
the horizon; Antares, on the right of Mara; while some of the most beautiful of
the heavenly constellations already named seem to redouble their stars, and un-
fold themselves to the observer, before, behind, around, and above him ; where
also is seen, with 11illl more distinctness, in all its mysterious beauty, the galaxy
or Milky Way, passing between Mars and Saturn, and spanning the concave

19. But let us examine some of the most prominent characteristics of these
ethereal wanderers through the tube of a telescope, aided by our imagination.
What an enchantin~ spectacle gradually unfolds itself in the field of the instru-
ment ! We see that the planet Mars presents to the view certain physical pe·
culiarities which bear a striking analogy to certain characteristic features of our.
globe ; such, for instance, as the white appearance of its polar regions, supposed,
with good reason, to he caused by an accumulation of ice and snow around them
during a winter as long as one of our years ; the spots slightly tinged with a
greenish hue which appear in its tempe,rato and equatorial zones, and indicate
probably the seas that bathe its variegated shores ; the oblateness of its poles, and
corresponding elevation of its equator ; the existence of ita well-authenticated
atmosphere ; and various other features of resemblance. From the changes
which take place from time to time in the general appearance of these white
and greenish spots, we must suppose that their various aspects are produced by
the melting of its polar sBOws, or by the wafting of the mountainous clouds which
are floating in its immense atmosphere; sometimes gentlv borne away by the

driven by the fierce wmds of the tempeat. · Finally, by the mclioation of ita
axis, wh1ch is only 61°, 33', 10" (that of the earth being 66°, 52', 1")-by the
Telocity of its annual revolution, which is fifteen miles per second (that of the
earth being nineteen in the same 11pace of time)-by its diurnal re\·olution, which
is only twenty-four hours, fifty-nine minutes, and fifty-three seconds (that of
the ~arth being twenty-three hours, twenty-four minutee, and forty-five seconds)-
'r ita inclination to the ecliptic, which nearly coincides with the path of the
earth, being only 1°, 51', 8"-and by various other points of comparison no leas
characteristic and analogous-we can conclude, that, if Venus has been appro-
priately styled by poets " the sister of the earth," Mars, by the numerous analo-
«ies which it bears to our globe, may be poetically entitled the brother of the
earth-if the grave language of science would permit such ~omparisons. The
planet accomplishes its revolution around the sun in the space of nearly two
years, and upon an orbit of great eccentricity. By means of the micrometer,
adapted to our instrument, we farther ascertain that the mean diameter of Mars,
compared with that of the earth, is nearly as O·lW to 1, or a little more than one
half. This proportion would give a circumference of about tAirtun thousantl
tAree Aundrcd and eighty-nine miles; a volume of 0·2, that of the earth being 1, or
about one fifth ; and a surface, consequently, equal to fifty-nine millions, seven
laundred and sixty thousand, four hundred and sixty-two square miles ; which,
being populated at the rate of two hundred and seventy-seven persons to the
aquare mile-England being the standard-would sustain a population of no less
than .si:rteen billions, five hundred and fifty-seven millions, two hundred and thirtv-
tllrl!e thousand, eigl1t hundred inhabitants, or about fifteen times greater than that
of our globe. The density of Mars is as 0·93, that of tl1e earth being 1, and is
~ to flint gltus. Its mean distance from our globe being fift~"i•• mil-
liMa of miles-to run over this space, at the rate of twenty miles per hour, would
require three hundred a11d tl1irty-seven years ! Although much farther removed
from the vivifying influences of the sun than our globe, Mars bas no moon to
temper by the poetic refulgence of her reflecte'd light the sombre hue of its dark
Dights; but Nature, in her eternal wisdom, bas remedied this seeming deficiency
by surrounding its globe with an atmosphere of a considerable altitude and den-
• 1ky, which, by the power of a most potent refraction, IDWit in a great degree
atone for the absence of a satellite. Indeed, a star, eclipsed in the field of our
te~escope by its gravitating disc, does not resume its vacillating light until it bns
receded a distance eqlllll to two third8 the diameter of the planet; which leads us
to conclude, or at least reasonably to suppose, that the atmosphere which refracta
the light of the star has at least three thousand miles of ele,·ation ! This im-
mense atmosphere, therefore, •nust very considerably increase the heat and light

more variegated in colors, in tints, in hues-so much more fantastic and grand
in their forme, their shapes, their masses 1 For the rays of the sun must be
there reflected in thousands and ten thousands of different manners. It is also,
perhaps, to these rich reflections, as well as to the great density of its atmo-

the other planets, ia to be attributed, and not, as Herschell supposes, to the

.aately plunged in the cold darkD8811 of an uninterrupted winter of nearly one
year's duration, its polar regions must accwaulate, during eo long a periud ol
cold, amazing masaes of ice and snow. We may judp uf this by the pbe~
ena which observation presents to our view. When the wiater pole reappean
to us after its long absence, that hemisphere generally casts such a nvid bril-
liancy by the redection of the light from its icea and &llOws, and the refract.ioa.
of its immense atmo.ph&"e, that, when the planet ia at the same time ia U.
perihelion and apogee, its disc being darkened at one pole and reepleadent at
the other, it appears like the irregular disc of a comet. How glorious muet the ·

eolitudes for ita polar animals-its white bears, its black foxes, ita ailky eeals
and otters, its spotless ermines, its lagopedes, its sa.iling swans, and ita acrow·
like reindeers !
But, with the return of summer, things must there take an aspect far dif·
Ierent from that of our poles. The polar regions of Mara hue the aun, during
the summer, elevated five degrees more upon their horizon, and receive the
benefits of his benign and vivifying influence during a whole year; and as
their atmosphere is considerably more elevated, they must receive more heat
from him, notwithstanding his great distance, and must therefore have all their
ice dissolved. Whence it follows that its inhabitants must observe upon its
poles, entirely stripped of their winter garbs, phenomena which have ne¥er
yet been observed by man upon those of the earth, which continue, after our
short winters and shorter summers, covered with glaciers attaining the propor·
tiona of continents, and the altitudes of Chimborazic mountains. They must
discover, unbidden, its magnetic poles, its Siberian mineralizations, and geologi·
cal remains-its elevated peaks, its extinguished volcanoes, crowned with on.
fathomable craters, a while ago loaded with mountains of ice, and now beautified
with calm and limpid lakes, garnished during the whole summer with the green
turf, ~rchard fruits, and greenhouse flowers, and teeming with gilded insects. Soea
the. buds and wandering carav8.8s of emigrating animals again return to people
their restored residence of the summer months ; while the winter inmates of these

1he seas cast from their loaded bosoms upon the sh1nes : for toward the poles

general relations of the globe with the sun, it is lDOSt probable, as has been aup-
poeed by H11g~ens, that the human beings of the universal creation are of the

physical constitution of the planet, and the various phenomena obse"ed upon its
surface, is a strong passion for hunting, resulting from a nomade existence con-
sequent upon the nature of their planet. They may be continually rejoiciug ia

eceana of a plaaet is aufficient to raise them with such violence; for it is diffi·
c:alt to comprehend, in the first instance at least, how a satellite can raise up
she mipty masses of the waters of an ocean without disturbing, to the millionth
part of a hair's breadth, the waters of the mightiest as well as the smallest
lakes-nor even the shallowest pond, or the tiniest drop of water contained in a
k vue, expoaecl or not upon tile seashore !•
In meuaring these majestic satellites, we see that in their combined propor·
&iau they represent a volume at least thirteen times greater than that of our
JDOOD, and &bat the third of them is no len than seTen times larger than our sat-
ellite; and cousequently as important, with regard to size, as the planets Mara
* Mercury, aDd still more so than the ultra-zodiacal planets Vesta, Juno,
Ceres, aud Pallas, which are so small, that we have not yet been able, even with
the most powerful telescopes, to ucertain their angular diameters with any de-
pee of accuracy. Finally, we can ascertain a circnmatance characteristic of
dle sublime analogy and design which presides over all creation, that they con-
etandy keep the 8riiiU fac• of their reflecting orbs turned toward the planet, while
they do not, like our moon, perform any diurnal revolution upon their axes.
22. Returning to Japiter, we see that the body of the planet is considerably
6auened at the poles, correspondingly elevated at the equator, and presenting
from the equator to the poles parallel shadowy belts, which are distinctly defined,
lmt the nature and precise object of which are as yet unknown to the astronomer. •
Ill axis approximating very nearly to the perpendicular-being 890, 45'-we
perceive\bat its equator corresponds almost horizontally with its ecliptic, or path
o{ ita orbit : whence it results, that, in its tropical or siderio.l revolution around
dae sun, which it requires twel"' of our years to accomplish, the seasons undergo
110 perceptible variations upon its surface ; and that while a constant summer
luuriandy wal'IDII its equator, the "~rpetual sprirtg" of the golden age of the
poets reigns in reality within the heterocian or temperate latitudes of this extra·
rinary planet. From the peculiar changes which take place in its parallel
belts, which are eometimes very brilli&nt, and sometimes more dim-and above
all, from the dark spots which are Permanent upon its disc-we also discoTer
that it revolves upon its axis with a prodigious velocity at the equator, since it
performs each diurnal revolution in the short space of nine hours, fifty-six .run.
-·and thirty-aeTen seconds ; thus presenting all the parts of its immense disc to
the field of tho telescope in one of our nights, and offering therefore to its active

intended that the intelligent beinga placed upon a planet should have an oppor-
tunity of knowing as much of ita surface as would give ahem an idea of the pow-
or and wisdom of the mighty Architect of his planetary abode, it is also probable
lhat he has endowed them with sufficient powers of natural-locomotion, together
with a genius capable of inventing adequate mechanical meaae to supply dei·
ciencies. If, then, the inhabitants of Jupiter have been endowed with theM
faculties in the same ratio to the proportions of their gigantic planet, as meD to
the proportions of the earth, with what prodigious powers of mobility IDUIIt they

God has placed men upon a world so majestic, where the phy.ical action offolff
(lOUDteracting moons must produce such wonderful phenomena, he has unquee-
tioeably intended that they should comprehend such m&rvels, and pay to hia
eHtaal wi&dom the due tribute of homage and of admiration.
" If it is not necessary, as we have seen, that the inhabitants of Jupiter should
be of a gigantic stature, in order that they may be able to wander over the sur-
lace of the whole planet : yet, if their stature is the same as oura, they must
have other harmonies of light than those we enjoy. One of their years beinr
twelve of ours, and one of our days being more than two 'of theirs, they live ia
the same space of time twice u many days as we do, and twelve times leu
years-that is, if the life of Jupiter's inhabitants should be regulated upon the
aame scale u ours." But if God in his supreme wisdom ha.s decreed that they
abould live during as many revolutions of their planet round the sun, as men do
when they reach the maximum (which existence would coincide in extent with
the stupendous mass of the planet), then the lives of Jupiter's inhabitants would
extend to twelve hundred of our years. Their adolescence, then, would begin
at the ago of oae hundred asrthly years ; their youth at two hundred ; their mall-
hood at four hundred ; their maturity at aeven hundred ; their decrepitude at one
&hoonnd ; and the muimum of their old age at twelve hundred. If, however,
lheir e:Dstenco were based upon proportional numbers of days, inatead of years,
the contrary wonld take place. Their adolescence would begin as 800il u they
auain oae of their yeara ; their youth at the second ; their virility at the fourth ;
tlleir maturity .at the sixth ; their decrepitude at the eighth : eight of their years
being about one huncked of ours in days.
Fenelon uaed to aay that our days are very long, and our years very short.
The reverse is the cue in Jupiter. It is their days that are short, and their
years that are long. Aa the suo conttantly warms its temperate latitudes, aud

dieular Aurora, beautified by innumerable lunar rainbows, moat .illuminate the

tioa of our globe. The inhabitants of the higher latitudes, particularly, must be
industrious and daring, like the English; enterprising and active, like the New

to its spangled sky, attempt a description of the wonderful celestial ph~mena
obiervable in the magical course of its fa.r ever-changing satellites, with a
view-to the completion of our ideas of the grandeur and magnificence of ita
astronomical, as well as its physical creation. For this description, too, obaer-
'Ntion atill more than analogy would furnish us, perhaps, a surer foundation
b our speculationa. But we must proceed to a subject still more sublime and
wonderful; we must leave Jupiter, however glowing it may be with celestial
and physical splendors ; for the most extraordinary object of admiration
among the ct>leatial orbl of the solar system is still reaerved for our admiration
and contemplation in the solemnly silent field of space. Let ua now concen·
trate our attention upon the planet Saturn.
IA.TtJRN.
24. By turning the telescope and our attention to Satum, and by comparing
the physical and astronomical characteristics of this globe with what we have
.an 01' conceived to exist in Jupiter, we find all the wOIIdera of the latter
planet aJmoat eclipaed by the still greater marvell of thia pompous neighbor
of the silent boundaries of the aolar ayatem. Saturn appears, in the field of
the te~acope, under the form of a globe surrounded by an elongated append·
age of an elliptical shape-a characteristic feature, bearing not the slightelt
aaalogy to any of the other heavenly bodies hitherto known to us. This
extraordiouy appendage which is called the rintf of Saturn, surrounds the
planet at its equator, like a stupendous flattened scarf, or gilded bracelet, and
IMlll8 to sustain itself like a celestial bridge, without arches or pillars for a sup-
port, or rather ita real appearance about the planetary globe, is preciaely like
tliat which would be preaented by a rainbow encircliDg a globular cloud, aad
seen in an inclined position. This inclination of the appt>ndage is owing to
tJlat of the pl&Det upon its axis, which ia about 60 degrees ; and as the
tcarf Ol ring is parallel to the equator of the planet, it follows that, in ita
iocliutioo, the plaaet muat open to the view the interior of this aerial arch.
The IDOit advantageous position, therefore, to diacover the physical corafor-
mation of this singl.llar pheaomenon, iswhen the plaaet is in iU winter or I1JIDo
mer aolltice, and pretents itl equator more elevated than our viaual nyt. Thia

c:Ucum.ta.nce happens only once every fifteen yean, since the sideral revQ}o-
~ion of Saturn is only completed in nearly thirty of our years. Then we can
easily perceive this apparently elliptical shape under a still more wonderful
aspect, for it resobes itself into two concentric rings, perfectly separated by a
vacant space !
When, on the contrary, the ring is in the direction of our visual rays, it vaJla
ishes entirely from our sight. This other phenomenon also takes place every
fiftt:en years, or half a sideral revolution of Saturn, when the planet ia ill
its equinoxial points; for the ring, which is comparatively very thin, both in
depth and breadth, presenting then to us its edge in front, is at too great a dil-
tance to be ~een, even with the most powerful instrument. The distance of
this interior ring from the surface of Saturn, is only aeventy-thret thousand one
ltu11Alred and sewnty-ttDO miles. The breadth of the ring is twenty thousand
miles. The breadth of the MCant .space between the two rings is only two
tlwwand eiglu kundred and thirty-nine miles. The interior diameter of the in-
terior ring, therefore, from edge to edge, in drawing a transverse line passins
throngh the centre of the planet, is one hundred and forty-ai:c thousand thr•
laundred and forty-five miles-a little over one half the distance of our moon
from the earth.• The uterior diameter of the uterior ring is ttDo hundred
and four tlwuaand eigkt hundred and eighty-three miles~ which, being multi-
plied by three, neglecting the decimal fraction, gives an external circumference
of at lebt ai:rteen hundred andfourteen thousand five hundred milu.
If, then, according to the suppositions of Sir William Herschell, we consider
that the width of the rings is at least of the same proportions as their breadth
or thickness, and that the interior surface, as well as their lateral edges and
superior surface, are all over and all around habitable surfaces, of a twin world,
811 fit for the dwelling of living beings as the body of the planet itself-it fol-
lows that the solid surface, which they present to the face of creation, would
probably equal, if it does not surpass, no less than two thousand worlds like 0111'1.
· 25. But the celestial prodigies which Saturn offers to our admiration and
utonishment, are not limited to this marvellous appendage lllone. We see,
beside11, that it has no less than seven radiant 11~oons, some of them as large u
our globe, revolving periodically around its equator, upon orbit• variously
inclined, and with different degrees of splendor and velocity !f

26. But let us now look for a moment at the planet itself. The mean dit
tance from the sun is, in round numbers, eight hundred and ninetyfour millitnu
of milu, or more than eight time1 that of the Earth to the same orb. Its revo-
lution around the sun is accomplished in thirty years : it therefore has a
lideral velocity of only about ai:r: milu per second. Observation ucertains
that its diurnal revolution is accomplilhed in about the same time as that of the
pl~et Jupiter, or in nine hours andfiftg-ai:r: minvtu, which make• its days and
nights of only about five hours each. In volume, Saturn presents a bulk
equivalent to eight hundred and tighty-se-Den times that of our globe, or about
1i:r-tenth.r the volume of'Jupiter. Its diameter being 1ewnty-8i:r thowandfi'DC
lrundred and ninety-one miles, its surface is consequently about 1eventun thou•
1andfive hundred andninety-eight millions of aquare miles, which being peopled
at the standard rate of 277 persons to the square mile, would afford room for
the stupendous population of four thowand eight hundred and sew1J.ty-jive bil-
lions nine lrundred and forty-one millions of living 10uls ! The diltance of
Saturn from the Earth being seven hundred and ninety-nine millions of miles,
to travel over this space, at the rate of twenty miles per hour, would require
no len than four thowand fi'De hundredandsi:rty years!
When Saturn's ring is parallel to our visual rays, which happens, as we have
already remarked, every fifteen years, its surface, like that of Jupiter, presents
to our view three shadowy belts or zones, one on the line of its equator, and
the two others about forty-five degrees distant, one in the northern and the
other in the southern hemisphere. As the diameter of Saturn differs from that
of Jupiter only about two diameters of the Earth-which, however, gives a
con~iderable difference in square surface and circumference--the former cannot
be much inferior to the latter, in its physical and geographical characteristics.
The mountains of Saturn, its rivers, its valleys, its prairies, and its deserts ; its
meadows, its pastures, its forests, and its swamps ; its oceana and its lakes; its
islands and its bays; its continents and ita capes; its gulfs and ita promontories 1
the reverberating roar of its thunders; the majestic fury of its storms ; the
raging of its tempests ; the eruptions of its volcanoes; every thing upon its
immense surface, must be nearly of the same gigantic appearance, of the same
vastnenand oolosaal proportion•, of the same grandeur and sublimity as in Jupi-
ter. Its botanical, Blineralogical, and zoological kingdoms must afford the same
nriety, the aame degree eC magnificence, and the same col0188lity of stature.
Its trees and animals must attain the same gigantic altitude and aiae. Its fruita
and flowers must display the same wide-spreading surface, and exhale afar the
same flooda of inebriating perfume~. Its birds and insects must fiy upon the
arne broad-expanded wings, and gli~r with the same gem-like splendor. Ita
morning songsters of the groves must rouse the neighboring echoes with the
• arne stentorian harmony-if, • we have supposed, the magnitude of existing

derful construction of this wonderful orb, and on the wings of fancy, aided by
observation, transport ourselves to its magical and enchahting aurface. Let t18
111ppoae that we stand at night upon its temperate zone. The first object that
JDeets the view, and roues our feeling of astonishment and admiration, is the
majestic appendage, or aerial scarf, which extend., like, a stupendou• areh,

more spacious than our globe, will appear to us to be distinctly divided into
two concentric zonea-two different tDOrldl, can'ed, u it were, oae into the

the other about the planet, with amazing vPlocity, in the short space of about

upon its axis. When favorably lighted by the rays of the 111lD, thele ringa
appear like a broad luminoua belt with a duzliug aurface equal to eeverd

appearing and disappearing to re-appear again, eclipsing each other at periodi-

which we cannot see.
" Their delights must be a thousand times greater than that of a man who
bas never left th~ green turf of his native village, and reads for the first time
the picturesque relation of a voyage round the world, and thus in a few houa
accomplishes, in imagination, the travel of as many yet.n~.'' They JDUit see,
beside, two distinct atmospheres of two distinct adjoiaing worlda-oae

seas rising pt'rpendicularly above each other upon the upper aide, aad uptide
flown upon the lower. The clouds of the atperior atmosphere of ont' rins
passing down to the lowt'r one, and those of the inferior wafted along toward
the uppt'r one, produce, at the rising and setting of the sun, auroras and twiw
lights of the mOlt picturt'&que description.
If tht'y have their Montgolfien, as they may have Herschells and Galileos,
perhaps they travel in aerostatic vehicles from the planet to the ringa; for it it
not altogether improbable that the atmospheres of both planet and rings may
unite in such a manner as to allow the mechanical communication of the two
worlds.
If the sun lights each of our poles alternately during six months, it lighte

all the glories of these outer worlds. Nothing can compare with the glowing
elegance of the11e polar acenea of ice, of light, ef moons, of snowa, of rings,
f)[ stars, of puaaelenes, of parhelia, and of aurora-borealis. Nothing can
picture the glorioua luxuriance of a horizon whose mountains, glaciers, snowy
peaks, icicled crags, frozen lakes and oceans reflect to the reflecting cloudl
enormous sheaves of light, of a thousand shades and hues. The pencil eData
.at that could paint such a acene.
"Saturn being so far distant from the sun, it would seem that Nature had
intended to compensate its inhabitants, by giving them, in their satellites,an idea
ef our entire solar system, most of the planets of which they cannot discover.
And again, in allotting to them such a glowing share of the mllDiiiceneei of the

the paraselenes, the parhelia, and aurora-borealis. But, if the nights of this
celestial orb possess such elegance and beauty, its d4ys have also their charma
and interesting character." If the atmosphere of Satiun does not modify, by
10me providential diapeDIB.tion, the laws of optical refraction, the sun's diameter
must appear to the inhabitants ofthat planet about ten tiinea smaller than it doea
to us; and thus it follows that the scenes of day may be as varied as the scenes
of night, though in a di1ferent manner. Their light, composed at the same time
of the silvery reflections of so many planetary surfaces, and of the purer light
of the sun, ia siinilar in intensity to that which is cast by the brilliant orb through
tile waving foliage of our tropical forests in a pure and serene day, while some
of its direct rays, penetrating here and there through some narrow space, shine
upon the corrolla of some wild flower, or glide along upon the tranquil surface
of a gently-flowing stream. Their globe beingdivided, like that of Jupiter, into
liquid and 110lid zones, offers the same various harmonies of ligbtand shade, and of

obiervation of their marvellous celeatial phenomena, awl the astronomical cal-
culations of the wonderful effects produced by so many brilliant moons and
such maje.8tic rings upon the vast oceans and the no lel!ll vast atmosphere of their .
wonderful orb. For the same Divine Wisdom which has blessed them with the
~uion of such a marvellous globe, has unquestionably granted them the
power of comprehending all its mysterious, physical, and astronomical grand-
eurs. The inhabitants of Saturn, therefore, must be at least as superior to OW'B,
ill point of intellect, as their globe is superior to ours in point of magnitude and
celestial magnificence ;-for if the elements and various influences of one single
moon require such mighty geniuses as a Laplace and a Herschell to be deter-'
mined with precision, what geniuses must there not be in a planet whose heav-
ens are decorated with seven acting and counteracting moons, and a celestial
append~ equivalentin surface to more than two thousand ofsuch worlds as ours!
Indeed, mythology has invented nothing that can be compared with the fairy-
like glories of Saturn's creation, both celestial and terrestrial; and the poets
would not have dared even to conceive such a scene as that offered to the view
and to the mind in the construction of this gorgeous orb.
But how much more sublime still must be the panorama which appears in the
llcllar firmament of the planet ;-for Saturn, being at least eigf.t hundred mil-
lions of miles nearer to the Milky Way and the fixed stars, than we are, its
brillimcy and their lustre must appear to the inhabitants of Saturn much greater
than they do to us. The lower planets, however, with the exception of Jupiter,
are seen with less advantage. Mars must appear at least sixteen times less
luminous in its quadratures than it does to us in its conjunctions. In its oppoai-
tiow it must disappear entirely from the sky of Saturn. The Earth must be
almost lost in the light of the sun, as Mercury is to us,-appearing only to oscil-
late about him, aometimes a little above, sometimes a little below his disc ;
Venus has probably been discovered there, if at all, only by her transit upon the
disc of the sun ; and most likely the existence of Mercury is entirely unknown
to the astronomers of Saturn. But, on the other hand, Uranus, surrounded by
its six retrograding moons, and probably by several concentric rings, like those
of Saturn, aa aurmised by Herschell, must appear as bright as Jupiter or Mara
to us.
We have already observed that the surface of Saturn, containing stVenteen
thousand five hundred and ninety-eight millions eight hundred and si:rty·five
thousand square miles, this extent of a habitable globe would afford room for
the stupendous number of four thousand tight hunclred a~d sevtntyfour lrillion1
nine hundred andforty-one million1 li:r hundred and e1ghtg-two thousand inhab-
itants ! But if we add, as we ought, those which the combined surfaces of the
t~o rings, interior, exterior, and lateral, could accommodate, we see that, although

Gleglobe itself of Saturn yields the supremacy, as far as regards IIW'face and
population, to Jupiter, yet when taken with the rings, it is far from being inle·
rior to that l~rdly planet in these respects, since the aurface of each ring alone
must be at least one thousand times greater than that of our Earth. .ABd what
a habitable surface must this peculiar appendage afford, if, according to the
recent observations promulgated from the observatory of Rome, the ring of
Saturn is really composed of 1ewn ieparate concentric riDga, instead of two
only!
Imagine, then, these ring& and the seven satellites to be populated in the IBlDe
-ratio as the planet ;-picture to yourself races of intellectual beings, species of
animals, and the multitude of innumerable things which may exist upon them,
diversified in the infinite variet,ies of nature, through the power and wiadom at
the Creator-beings of capacities suited to the objects of wonder around them-
animals whose organization conforms to the magnificence of the place they
inhabit, whether upon the land, within the seas, or in the air-and plants and
minerals of never-ending varieties ; let the imaginative observer add to these
creations the reciprocal aspects of the heavens, that must be seen from each of
these dependant appendages of this gorgeous planet ; and I may ask-can the
human mind rightly conceive, or language rightly describe 111ch magnificent
wonders, such bewildering glories, so as to do justice to that Being of infinite
wisdom, power and intelligence who baa created a world so marTellous and 110

29. But how much more overwhelming still would be the astonishment of
the beholder, if, in imagination, he should take a ftight from the syatem we
inhabit, and passing Uranus in his course through the silmt field ofspace, finally
attain a goal among the wonderful and stupendous realities of the stellar crea·
tion! Can the most lofty and grasping imagination conceive, much leSI can
human language even attempt to describe, the never-ending varieties of the rich
and sublime magnificence there displllyed by the Supreme intelligence in the
mighty doings of His hands-in the myriads of suns, of worlds, and diatiflct

30. The planet Uranlll, seen in the field of a most powerful teleacQPe, ehowa
a diameter equivalent, inangular measurement, to a volume abotlt ~
timee tbM: of our earth. Bordering u it does upon the confiDee of our aolu
system, and the outakirta of other syet.ems perbape more wonderful than oum,
it seems to partake of the element. of an amphibious existence. llldeed, the
satellites of all the other planets revolve around their primaries, and the planets
themeelves, Uranus included, revolve around the eun from the west to the
east; but the eatellites of Uranus revolve about ita orb from the eut to
tile west, and allnOit perpendicularly to the plane of its ecliptic 1-the ouly
_phenomenon of tbia extraordinary character obtervable in the !lUll's dominiona.
The distance of Uranus from the sun being ao great-nearly 11110 thou1aatl
tailliMu of miles-and the sun's attractive power being exerted upon it with 10
little strength, the sideral velocity of the planet is reduced to jOtW milee per
second ; while the eideral velocity ofllercuryin the eame apace oftime IJDOUilta

Hence it results, that the planet Uranus perfoJ'Dll ita revolution aroUDd the lltHI

Although the 11\lD does not appear upon the horizon of Uranua, 81 we have seen,
much J.arger than Ven111 from our globe ; he may still produce a great degree of
heat in its vast atmosphere, in the same manner as a spark, through the agency
ofthe air, can kindle a con1lagration. Indeed, his direct influence must be very
great, since his rays, rejkcted from such a stupendous distance, are still powerful
enough to render Uranus 80 vividly defined in the field of the teleacope." Is
aot this fact alone aufficient to prove to us, in our impotent imperfections, that
the IJ'Item of the celestial physics of the Deity is modified by rules emanating

deviating very far from probability, to suppose that the continents of Uranus
1re divided into circular zones parallel to its equator, and intermingled with
aqueous zones like those observable upon Jupiter and Saturn; and that its rug·
ged IIW'face has been 80 disposed by wise Nature as to reflect and repeat, with
the best advantage, the solar rays to its inhabitants. It is also probable that the
Creator hu placed upon its continents and sea-ehores heating volcanoes, which
warm the soil from beneath, as Mt. Hecla acts upon the soil of Iceland. Per-
haps also the JDOI8e8 and licheue which decorate our polar snows with a perpet-
ual verdure, intermixed with purple leaves and scarlet berries, raise there to the
altitude of trees during seasons of forty-t'tiJO Yla1''· If the simple ferns of our
climate attain the size of trees beneath our torrid zone, the muse• which, in our
frigid zones, hang like pendant draperies from the branches of our polar pinea,
lvches, yews and cedars, must form, towards the poles of Uranus, forests of a
ieecy and ngetable wool. The lichens which carpet our polar crags and rocb,
and the seeds of which ripen despite the freezing winds of the north, must there

rous tones, and, resounding alternately from yard to yard, give to man the first
warning of,the distantapproach of the messenger of day. As ifawakened from
a deep slumber by this appeal of the warlike bird of Mars, the first opal tints
of the dawn begin to cast a greyish shadow upon the eastern part of the stellar
vault. The isolated trees, accidentally scattered in the fields, begin gradually
to loom upon the far horizon, like immoveable phantoms, through the magnify-
ing light milt, which already rise.s from the soil like a transparent veil of
· shadowy gauze. Their flexible branches, gently moved by the scarcely per-
ceptible breath which agitates them at intervals, seem to incline themselves, as
ifintentionally, and silently to salute, through the shade, this mysterious appear·
ance of the first indications of day.
With these precursive tidings ofthe dawn, a merry troop oflight-heart,ed youth
is seen issuing from the easterngatesofthe city. Guided by their watchful tutor,
they proceed inregular order, two and two, cordially clasping each other's hand.
Animated with a cheerful spirit, with hearts beating_highwith bo~, they rapidly
advance toward the country, whert the pastoral possessor of a patriarchal farm,
teeming with all the lu:xums of Vertumnus and Flora, has invited the mo11t mer-
itorious oftbeir school to spend a joyous day. Scarcely had the merry troop
breathed the morning perfume of the fields, equalled only in voluptuousness by
the sweet impressions which it produces in the soul, than they seemed animated
with a more lively ardor. While they march, the vapory shades of the dawn
slowly give place to the more diltinct ones of Aurora. The eaatern heaven is
gradually covered with rosy tints, bordered by the reflections of a yellow orange,
and melting gradually away through the various hues of the satfranum into the
violet of the lilacs. The stars which, awhile ago, twinkled with so vivid a light,
begin to grow pale in the heavens; the smaller ones already fade away.
Meanwhile, the merry troop, adn.ncing at aqvick pace, have already gained

the middle o/ the fields ; they soon abandon the dusty road for a more agreeable
. u.d appropriate route. .4.t a signal from the watchful pr-eceptor, who presidet
over all their joys and hope• with a paternal solicitude, the ranks are broken;
each one, henceforward more free in his movements, shootl forth to the right
and the left, and chooses his route, according to his own fancy toward the
avenues of the farm. Neither does the sensible chill of the morning air,
or the damp penetrating dew, which rt>nders the walking leiS agreeable, le9sen
the gayety with which each one is animated, or the illusions with which eac•
one cradled his young imagination. While, leaping the ditches, clearing the
water-courses which they found in their way, and climbing over the fence~,
they were thus approaching the farm, the horizon has been gradually covered
with tints more vivid, more decided, more numerous, and which no more take
their softened colors from the velvet petals of the flowers, but from the vivid
and glaring prismatic reflections of the precious stones. It appears indeed as it
the oriental vault of heaven, were glossing its surface with horizontal stripes of
liquid rubies, amber, coral, and amethysts! From this moment the neigh-
boring stars send forth only a dim vascillating light. It would seem that,
ashamed of again being vanquished by Aurora, they feel their own weakness,
and wish gradually to retirt>, that they may not assist at her new triumph!
Some, however, continue to twinkle in the west, where the sky is still dark-
ened; they seem to be concentrating all their brilliancy, as if to resist tbe con-
queror, who threatens soon to usurp their empire; but it is in vain that they
unite their efforts, they must soon yield to her superiority.
Already have the birds of night preceded by the white-winged owl, who
seems to serve them as a warning beacon, begun to regain their obscure retreats
in the shadowy depths of the forests: the timid bare, and cautious deer have
already left the open fields for the more propitious shadow of the woods. At
their return, the implacable eagle and the voracious hawk begin to prepare
their sharp talons for the morning's hunt; while, disengaging their heads from
underneath the warm wings which covered them during the night, the birds
of day, among whom they must soon choose their prey, little foreseeing the
cruel fate which may and which must before long overtake them, open their
eyes, shuffie their glossy feathers, and begin to hop from branch to branch, u
if to stretch their little limbs, and prepare their light wings for B.ight.
All at once, the air rings with a melodious sound, which causes the atmosphere
to vibrate afar, with a sweet and tremulous thrill; the echo, hitherto silent,
'repeats it in successive undulations to the distant streamlet of the valley.
Immediately cadencing a harmonious roulade, which seems to run over a thou·
sand varied notes at once, the fairy voice which produced these ravishing sounds
awakens all the surrounding echoes, and they repeat it in chorus-while the
voice itself seems to pause, as if, submerged in the torrent of harmonies with
which abe baa filled the atmosphere, abe were n.tening to heraelt, in rapturoaa

utoniahmenL At tbeee enchanting accenta, the joyous troop are suddenly
tllTeated, as if under the infatuation of a spell, to listen al10 ; for they have
recognised the harmonious ringing notes of the lyric enchantress of the grovea, ·
the morning leader of the songsters of the forest-the melodious nightingale !
who, already preluding at her morning concerts, offers thus abruptly her fi.rat
llllutations to Aurora, always attentive to her songs. It would seem indeed that
her melodious noteahad been carried by the surrounding echoes even to the car-
minated gateaof the horizon, and were understood by the elements; for Aurora
at the moment seems to have redoubled her pace. The birds, preluding
already to the harmonies of their matin hymns, seem to prepare themselves for
ainging her triumphs. At their head ia the rustic cuckoo, the gay linnet, the
lively red-breast, and the sensitive turtle-dove. The nightingale by their side,
presiding over the concert, redoubles her harmonious cadences, aa the Godde•
-« the dawn approaches. Most of the stars have vanished from the firmament;
the heavens now appear like an ocean of liquid coral,of vermillion, and orien-
tal topazes. And now Aurora reigns in undisputed sovereignty. But, alaa!
"a natural image of pleasure: as nothing is more beautiful than her reign, so
nothing is shorter than its dllrlltion."
The god of day follows her with hasty atepa; she must resign her empire,
like the night, which just now fled so rapidly before her. In vain the hours,
with redoubled energy, scatter in precipitated floods their bouquets of rosea
beneath her steps ; she must finally yield-the god of day has almost over-
taken her I Already he is announced by the vivid tints which he pours around
him. The glowing rays but just precede the dazzling glare: the east seems on
fire : it appears suddenly all in flames. At their eft'ulgency, the burning diec
is each moment expected; at every instant he seems about to appear-at last
he rises majestically from the liquid abyss ! A brilliant pencil of flame, start-
ing forth like a flash of lightning, and suddenly filling all space, seems, like
the bow of a celestial orchestra, to have given the last signal for the awaken-
ing of all nature. It is the Sun, who has just touched upon the horizon with
the edge of his inflamed disc. Red as a purpuereal aphere of gleaming ver-
million, and at first of an immense size, he gradually ascends from behind a
wide-spreading curtain of clouds, which he soon pierces with a thousand pen-
cils of light, forming a gigantic glory, who11e superior rays curve themselves
into an immense arch, which reaches to the zenith. "Then the veil of
darkness being entirely effaced, man is again permitted to recognise hi• abode,
which he finds every where beautified and embellished. The verdure has taken
during the night fresh vigor and renewed freshness; the new-born day which
shines upon it, the first rays which gild it, display it covered with a brilliant
net-work of dew, which reflects to the eye the light and the colors of the rain-
bow!"

Newton and many other illuatrious astronomers thought and taugbt, that the
Sun was a globe of liquid fire, wboae heat was no leas tlum tweDty thousand
times greater than that of an incandeacent maas of molten iron. The surface
f1f its glebe was, according to their theories, a boiling ocean of liquid lava, upon
which floated clouds ofa dark scum, which occasioned the spots, for whoae exist-
ace they could aot otherwise account. But the Columbus of utronomy,
Herschell, by means of hia powerful telescope, and the aid of his great mind,
bas completely subverted this theory by one more in accordance with the wis·
dom of the Creator. He has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the grE'ater
- portion of the learned worl~ that the Sun is himself a planetary orb, having a
IOlid mrface ; that he is surrou.Bded, at the distance offive thotuud miles from

his disc, hy a lu~ainoua and undulating atmosphere, from hDtllly 10 t!&irty thou-
Blind milu in depth ; and that the spots which are seen on his surface are
nothing but occasional openings in his atmosphere, which leave bare to the view
portions of his opaque surface. It is also supposed that an electric atmosphere
exists beneath the luminous one. Herachell remarked, with reuon, while
giving the results of his great discoveries to the world, that the calculations of
Newton upon the immediate heat of the Sun are withoutfoundation, since they
&l'e based upon the degree of heat produced by his light upon the Earth, and
that this heat owes its existence simply to the 11~cy of an llhiWaplurt, with-
out which it would not be experienced even under the equator. This is
plainly demonstrated by the fact that the Andes, which are under the torrid
zones, are above the regions of the denser atmosphere, perpetually covered
with snow and ice. We may reasonably conclude then, with llerachell, that
the Sun is neither a fiery globe nor an ocean of boiling lava, but a planetary
orb like ours and the other planets, and therefore a habitable one. This idea
satisfies the mind and the reason. If the Sun, at least thirteen hundred tlwu-
8tJnd times larger than all the planets united, had been t7lflde a fory globe,
npressly destined to light them, "the lamp would be larger than the house,"
which is not in accordance with the wisdom of God.
And, in fact, what a stupendous globe does not the bulk and surface of the
Sun present to our imagination ! Herachell has observed indentations or prom-
inences on the margin of his disc, which he calls "the solar mountains," and
which must attain the enormous altitude of several thousand miles !-some of
them he estimates to be more than eighteen hundred times more voluminous
than our globe ! How majestic then must be the landscapes displayed upon
his surface ! The comparison of one of the grandest natural sceneries of our
globe with a view seen from the Sun, on a proportionate scale, will perhaps
aid our conception of the awful magnitude and grandeur of that majestic
globe.
" There is no point on the surface of the Earth," says Mr. Brydone, " that
unites so many awful and sublime objects a1 the top of Etna, and no imagin-
ation has dared to form an idea of so glorious and magnificent a scene. The
body of the Sun is se.en rising from the ocean, immense tracts both of sea and
land intervening; the islands of Penar:i, Alicudi, Lipari, Stromboli, and Volcano,
with their smoking summits, beneath the beholder, who looks down on the
whole of Sicily llll upon a map: and can trace every river, through all it1
windings, from its source to its mouth. The view ia absolutely boundless 011
every side, 10 that the sight is every where lost in immensity." "Yet, this
expansive prospect, 110 magnificent, is comprised within a circle about 240
miles in diameter, and 754 in circumference, containing 45,240 square miles,
which is only the 1-53,776,608th part of the surface of the Sun; so that
fifty-three milliom seven hundred and seventy-si:I: tlwusand landscapes, such as

456 SIXTH LBSSOif.
beheld from Mt. Etna, behoove to pass before us ere we could contemplate a
surface as expansive as that of the Sun ! And if every auch landscape were
to occupy two hours only in the contemplation, as above supposed, it would
require twenty-four tlwusand five hundred andfifty-four years before the whole
surface of this immense globe could be in this manner surveyed; and even then
we should have but a faint conception of the solid contents of the Sun, which
amount to three hundred and fifty-si:r: thousand t1'ght hundred and eighteen tril·
lions seven huudred and thirty-nine tlwusand two ll.undred millions of cubical
miles, a number 146,670 times greater than the number of square miles upon
its surface !"
" What a glorious idea, then, does such an object as the Sun present to us of
the GRANDEUR of the Deity, and the energies of His oMNIPOTENCE! In its lus-
tre, in its magnitude, in its active energy, in its boundless influence, and its
beneficial effects upon the Earth, and on surrounding worlds there is a more
glorious and immediate display of Divine perfection than in any other material
being with which we are acquainted."
37. Geometry demonstrates to us that the sphere contains all known forms,
and all that may be imagined. The Sun, which is, as Bernardin de St. Pierre
elegantly says, "a living and vivifying sphere," must present to the view forms
the most varied and most beautiful, in the vast outlines of its mountains and
valleys. And what valleys must those be, extending between winding moun·
tains eighteen hundred miles wider than the Earth ! What rivers must flow
from their Alpine tops and slopes! There are not seen, as upon our globe,
_piled up rocks, broken assunder by the harshness of the winter ; craggy moun-
tains tom down and disintegrated by the raging torrents; promontories formed
and destroyed by the fury of the sea; a world dying and rising again from ita
own ruins. The Sun must present a world enjoying all the perfections of
beauty, joined to all the plenitudes of an energetic life. There are doubtle•
aeen valleys and undulating plains, which vanish into perspectives upon the
horizon, at least a hundred and ten times more extended than ours. Alpine
mounts, of the same colosml proportions, offering, upon their brows and skirts,
the most graceful and varied curves, must lift their summits, not into the
regions of a frozen atmosphere, as upon our globe, but into the bosom of an
atmosphere of light and life, which animates afar the worlds and their satellites.
Their rocks of diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and a hundred other gems scin•
tillate around with magic splendor; they glitter in the Sun like other suns ;
from their dazzli~ sheaves of light, reflecting at once the tints of Aurora with
the hues of twilifnt, emanate prismatic irises of all curves, of all sizes. Light
is not there harmonized with shades, nor summer with winter, nor life with
death; but light is harmonized with light, spring with spring, and life with life.
There, all silence is a ravishing repose, all noise a melody, all odor a perfumt:,
all sensation a pleasure, all hope a reality. "In its innumerable curves are solved
• Digitized by Coogle

au the problems of geometry, and in its electric atmosphere are solved all the
problems of physics and chemistry. There, the quadrature of the circle may
become a reality, and the union of the parabola with its assymptotes a compre-
hensible thing. In its virgin soil is realized the condensation of light into gold,
and in its undulating atmosphere the volatilizing of gold into chromatic rays
of light. Source of' all motion and all existence, in its immediate sphere of
action must be found the perpetual motion, and eternal youth united with im-
mortal beauty and everlasting life. There also are perpetual loves, and never,
ending generations. Vpon the peaks of its mountains are the rapturous inspi-
rations of genius, and in their profound grottoes the ecstacies of consolation.
Their intluences are carried to the earth by the solar rays, and back again upon
the gauzy wings of hope, after having reposed at intervals upon the calm
boiom of virtue."
38. But is the Sun inhabited 1 This is the never-ending question. Every
drop of water containing hundreds of inhabitants, as the microscope so plainly
shows; every particle of matter being the abode of some hundreds of living
creatures, is it not supremely preposterous to suppose, for one moment, that the
Creator would have made such a glorious planetary orb to remain a desert of
splendor and majesty 1 The sun, then, must be inhabited: this, philosophy
must admit. It may be that its inhabitants enjoy a life of supreme happinese,
situated as they are in the sphere of all perfections. They are probably the
possessors of universal knowledge, in every thing at least that relates to the
solar •yltem. Perhaps they see the planets in their natural size, by some prov.
idential modification of their organs of sight ; as it is not impoBBible for the
Deity to do for them what he bas done for some of our insects, whose eyes
often unite the double advantages of the microscope and telescope. Such, for
ex.ample, are the bees, who see at the same time the nectarine glandule whence
they sip the molecular elements of the sweet honey, and the far-off' bee-hive
where they mUit carry their precious load. Thus the fortunate inhabitants of
the Sun may discover alternately the planetary harmonies of all the planets o£
the system, from Mercury to Uranus; the changing phenomena of the seasons;
their physical revolutions; their political changes; their religious reformations;
their wars; their industries ; their sciences ; their arts; the progreBB and fall
of their nations ; and generally all that is going on in the field of their uni-
verse, and interesting to inquiring minds to know.
"They see the Sun, like the mythological Apollo, drawing with his golden
bow formed of the rays of his light, innumerable harmonies from all that envi-
rons it: the planeta are the strings of his lyre ; and their sideral bounds the
notes which produce the concerts of their musical spheres."
They see them attracted and repelled at the same time by his c~ntripetal
and centrifugal force. They witness his conatant and universal in1luence
upon nature. And their feelings of wonder rise to admiration and ravishiog

39. It is, indeed, solelyowingtothe existenceofthe Sun that notonlyourglobe,
but all the planets dependant upon its inftuence are·rendered habitable sphere•,
and productive of intellectual, as well as material enjoyments. It is from its
powerful and vivifying influence alone that all the benign agencies which are
acting throughout the atmosphere, the waters, and the earth, derive their ori-
gin. Its rays animate all nature. They dilate the air, liquify the waters, warm
the crust of the earth, fecundate the vegetables, ripen the fruits, compose their
IWeet perfumes, kindle with the fire of love all living bosoms, and color with
a thousand hue• and tints the gems in the bowels of the globe, the shells and
Ashes in the bosom of the ocean, the birds and insecta in the green shades of
the forest, and the clouds and rainbows in the limpid atmosphere.
By the vivifying action of its light the blood circulates through the beating
arteries, and the sap ascends through the capillary venela of the plants, pro-
• clueing under various forms, from inorganic matter, the living beings and their
ftried aliment. It is in the latitudes, where its in1luence it more powerfully
felt, that this action is more energetically exercised. Behold the tropical
regions of the globe. What luxuriant nature ! What glowing developments

the most brilliant flowers, the most perfumed spices, and the largest and moat

valued and the rarest gems ; the most elevated mountains; the most powerful

There, without cultivation, are produced the pine-apple, the cocoa-nut, the
banana, the cacao, the almond, the orange, the bread-fruit, and thousands of
other delicious and nutritive fruita, which man can gather without fatigue.
There, too, are found the coffee-berry, the tea-leaf, the" soothing weed," and
the sugar-cane, more productive of wealth to the nations of the world than
even the mines of Golconda. There the cochineal grows upon the leaves of
the nopal. There, also, grow the treeswhich bear the Arabic incense, the nut-
meg, the cinnamon, and the aromatic clove ; the palm-tree with its waving
fans, the Banian fig with ita acre-covering trunks and branchea, and the lordly
mahogany. There, too, are found the royal lion of the deserts, the gigantic

When its rays depart from the western horizon at night, all in nature falls into
the dumbneaa of sleep; a few only of the creatures of earth awake with the
stars as if to watch over the safety of the globe. But when its rays gild the
eutem horizon, after the darlmeaa of the night, " the hills rejoice on every
lide."
4.1. Without the direct influence of this august luminary, a universal gloom
would ensue, and surrounding worlds, with all their trains of satellites, would
be abrouded in perpetual darlmea. The earth would become a Jifeleaa rna.,
a dreary waste, a chaotic assemblage of inactive matter, without beauty or
order. No longer should we behold the meadows clothed with verdure; the
feathered songsters would no longer chant their melodious notes ; all human
activity would cease ; universal silence and darkness would reign undisturbed,
and this huge globe of land and water would return to its original chaos. For
if the sun engenders by its presence daylight and heat, happinea and joy,
motion and life; its total absence would be the cause, not only of night and
cold, desolation, silence, and repose, but ofuniversal death."
And, indeed, in order to obtain a still more impressive idea of the impor•
tance of the Sun's influence upon nature, let us take a glance at the consider-
able difference which the presence or the absence of a very small portion of
its vivifying light produces every year in the higher latitudes, in the general
economy of mankind, and of the globe itself.
WlNTBR1 AND TBB RETURN OF SPRING.
42. As soon as the Earth has taken her O.ight from the autumnal equinox to
the winter eolstice, and the solar rays begin to fall more and more obliquely
upon the temperate regions, we perceive a gradual change operating all around
us, and a melancholy smile falling from nature'sface upon every ~eene we behold.
The days are soon observed to grow sensibly shorter; the thermometer faD.
every day degree by degree ; denser and denser fogs rise at intervals from the
sea shores, the borders of the lakes, the banks of the rivers, the flats of the
meadows, and the tops of the forests : they rise with the declining Sun, like
the first condensed breath ofthe genius of the winter; they rise again with iu
departing rays. From this period the nutritive sap ceases to circulate through
the benumbed vessels of the plants, and the green leave• are gradually
colored with variegated tints; they seem to don the borrowed garment. of the

Iowen, now languishing and departiDg iD dismay, u if to celebrate, in festival
llltire, the farewell greetinga of Flora, tbe Sylvana, and Vertumnua. Here
they deck the~~~Selvea with the yellow of the .atfranum, tbe butter-cupa, awl
the marygold ; here with the pink of the pomegranate, the dying roee, and the
faded magnolia ; there with a faint orange, a gloeay purple, or a tender green.
There, in the same tree, all the colora are 1een intermingled ; aom.etimea like
the spotted corolla of a multicolored tulip, the same leaf is beautified with
all the tints ; while the awnaca, tinged around their carmine grapea with all the
Tividneaa of th~ purest vermillion, appear like pendant aheeta of scarlet llilk,
hanging beneath criiD80n clusters of coral beadl. Thus the foresta eeem to
rejoice, and cheer nature in their holy-day garbs; but it is a cheer of disaem-
bled melancholy-the parting smile of the lover, who, with a moistened eye,
bids adieu to a betrothed whom he fears he may see no more.
Meanwhile, u if to console Nature in her threatened distreal, the holly, the
c:yprea, the cedar, the yew, the pyramidal pine, and many other enrgreene,
pulling on their deepe~~t emerald hues, seem preparing to defy the rigon of
a merciless winter. The purple clusters of the juniper, the blackberries of
the privet, the coral beads of the eglantine, and the jet ones of the whortle·
berry, contrasting with their evergrt'en leaves, remain as if to remind naturfl
of her put fertility. The mosses at the same time revive their softer tints,
the lichene extend their grasping tendrils, and the ivy preSIJel tighter around
the friendly trunk ita caressing vines loaded with thick green leaves.
43. Already have the emigrating birds begun to proclaim their parting meet-
ing.. They unite here and there in animated groupe. They seem to cliscUSII
the plana of their long journey, or to lament the forced abandonment of the
cradles of their lives, their love, and happiness-for how many among them
lball fall, in so long a voyage, victims of an inexorable fate l How many shall
never again see the groves where they first felt the warming rays of the Sua,
where they first gazed upon the glades illuminated by its dazzling light, where
they firat breathed t~ pure air gently warmed by its animating heat! The
fN'l•ip«lu gather upon the streams ud around the lakes to hold their council;
the gralla stand upon their long legs among the reeds of the marshes, awaiting
the signal of departure ; the pasBtUu assemble upon the tops of the forest·
.trees; and the swallows around the inhabited roofs of men, where they prelude
.to the exercise of their never-tiring wings, by the most lively tournaments, the
.most animated chattering&, whistlings, and flying excursions, with a view, at
the llllDlC time, to rehearse their little onea;-while the sparrow, the dove, the
red-breast, and a few others, faithful to their native home, approac;h the pro-
tecting barns, where the presence of man seems to attract and retain them.
No aooner has the north threatened to aend forth its first chilling breath than
we see their merry troops rising on the wing to take their departure; guided
by a provideatial inlltinct, they cvt their way through the pathlesa atmosphere,

directing themselves, in large and numerous caravans, towards the aouthem
regions of the globe. Here they fty in broad trianglea, the better to avoid tbe
resistance of the air; the leading pilots a~ seen at intervals retiring by tut'DI
to the farthermost ranb, there to repose upon the wing until their tum in lea.J..
iftg comes again. Here they fly in long ellipses; here in prolonged and nar-
row linea; there in bands unregulated. Here a few, here a swarm, there a host.
Every now and then new flocks follow the past ones, until the north beiJII
deserted, none remain-save those who fall in the snares of man.
Soon after their departure, November strikes the air and the soil with ita
&rst chilling winde. The ·grass and the merry turf suddenly disappear f~
the fields. The leaves of the trees, now withered, fall in con.tant showen,
-like the fugitive days of man, at every movement of the atmosphere. They
strew the soil with their pale and splitting remnants. The branches, now
stripped and bare, allowing a free passage to the wind as it is wafted through
them, produce by their motion, and the whirling of the dry leaves, a monot-
onous sound, which recalls involuntarily to the mind the parting lamentati0111
of the mythological sylvans and dryads, cast from their rustic shades by the
unmerciful rigor of a profane invader. The leafless trees seem to moan over
the fate which has overtaken them. The gardens and the orchards are no more
decorated with their summer attire. Henceforth there are no more fruita, no
more flowers to be seen, no more fragrance to be inhaled, no more birds to
warble in the groves, ho more insects to hum upon the plants; retired within
their chrysa.les, suspended beneath the leafless branches, these wait, uncon-
sciously, in the process of their metamorphosis, for the return of happier days,
the breath of gentler zephyrs, the smiles of a gayer sky ;-while the bee, seclu-
ding itself amid the nectar of ita hive, of all the flying insects, alone continues
to breathe the pure air of heaven, and taste of the ambrosial sweeta of the
flowers.
Presently, December, surrounded with ita whole court of stormy blasts,
makes its triumphal appearance, and nature, frowning now with gloomy broww,
enters at once into a state of paralization: Yet, the solar rays have not c~
to irradiate the firmament of the temperate regions ;-they simply fall a little
more obliquely-while on the polar latitudes only, the reign of day has been
absolutely overthrown, and succeeded by that of night and winter in all
their combined horrors. But let us behold, in their tum, the diiiCOUragiag
scenes of desolation that this •light diminution of light in the temperate I~
tudes produces all around us, and the still more gloomy scenery displayed in
the polar regions in the temporary abscence of the vivifying orb of day.
No sooner has the Sun attained the maximum degree of its tropical inclina-
tion, than the frost overpowers all the streamingsources of the liquid element..

along ite winding shaded curve•, is now a deadly frozen stream, a waving solid
rod of ice. The eooling grottoes, where a secluded echo delighted to repeat
the sweet modulations of the neighboring songsters, are now benumbed by the
presence of pendant columns of glittering icicles, interweaving their freezing
muses with the stalactites of the concave vaults. Nothing has been spared •
by the frost in its congealing wrath. The picturesque rivulet, through whoee
murmuring reeds the angler guided his gliding skifF, in the gay season of the
sport, and the majestic river that, but a while ago, bore on its broad surface
fleets ofmoving sails, and rapid steamboats, are frozen to their depths, and crossed
in every direction by heavy-laden chariots. From the solitary pond, once the
Armidian cradle of sylph-like sporting swans, up to the ocean-like lake-all aze
frozen, all present to the view an even surface of solid ice. The soil is every
where covered with a thick coating of snow, now drifting from the slopes ol
the hills before the fury of the blllllt, now rolling from the tops of the moun·
tains in roaring avalanches, now thawing in the fields, now filling the valleya,
now falling in dense showers from the clouds like heavenly down plucked from
the wings of angels. The freezing winds of the poles almost constantly buzz
upon the ear with fury ; they cause the slender branches of the trees, the rig-
,ging of the tossing vessel, and the key-holes of the protecting home to whistle
like the raging serpents of the fable. Immense masses of dark and gloomy
clouds, constantly floating in the lower regions of the atmosphere, pour, ever
and anon, upon the surface of the Earth, their stores of frozen rain, of sleet, of
hail, of melting snow. The trees, isolated upon the plains, or gathered here
and there in groups, raising to heaven, like supplicating arms, their naked
branches, glistening with pendant icicles and glittering frost, appear like frozen
phantoms which the winter baa surprised in their nocturnal wanderings, and
petrified by his sudden appearance ; while the Sun, almost constantly con-
cealed among the massive strata of the clouds, shows himself at long intervalt,
through their rare openings, Ill! ifto cllllt a compa.<~~~ionate glance upon the scene of
desolation which the winter creates around during th~ abscence of his power.
All the domestic animals belonging to these now desolated climes, appear
sufFering, benumbed, and sadly melancholy ; the wild ones experience a still
more cruel fate; for the fields, now buried beneath the deep snow, present no
food to their increasing wants ; the gloomy solitudes of the forest alone ofFer
to their growing privations a few dry leaves, or the less nourishing moss or
paraaite lichen. Man himself, notwithstanding all his physical and moral
energies-man, who so proudly styles himself the "king of creation"-man,
with all his courage and pride, seems also to bend under fbe vigor r.f such a
harsh temperature, in the presence of such a melancholy picture, of such a
scene of freezing desolation ; and, indeed, we see him then, to protect his
existence against the deadly breath of Aquilones, covering himself with heuy
woolen gnrmentl; borrowing from the animala their fleecy llkim, he barle.

himself under masses of heavy warming furs. Thus, hardly distinguishable
from the bear, the ram, or the bison,, his walk becomes heavy; his steps, always
embarrassed with the sleet or the snow, are slow and uncertain ; he hides his
face under the broad folds of a cloak ; and for days, for weeks, for months, he
is no more to be seen in the pure image of his maker ; be is no more to be
recognized, even by his most cherished friends.
44. Yet, as if to dissemble to themselves all the crushing horrors of the
melancholy scene which environs the whole expanse of their horizon, and
invades their whole sky, a number of the livelier onea exert themselves to take
the most advantage of these gloomy frowns of nature, and divert to their gayer
pleasures the severest rebukes of the Aquilones. Some, taking the light and
graceful sleigh, glide along with the rapidity of an arrow: the courser that
precedes them in his flying gallop is crowned with waving plumes and covered
with grapes of silvery bells, which, as he darts along upon the rolling plain
or road, produce a merry chime, which enlivens the mind, and cheers afar the
listening ear. These, arming themselves with the deadly weapons of Diana,
take their course towards the dense forest, where the fox, the bear, and the
wolf will offer to their martial hopes chances to display their activity, their skill,
.and perhaps their courage. Those preferring the less dangerous sports, seek
in the valleys for the light-footed hare, the swift chamois, or the still swifter
stag. Soon the hounds are loosed; they fly forward like darting arrows. Pres-
ently their echoing baying announces the presence of the game. Tho! stag
bounds before them, like the bullet before the sound of the gun. They keep
pace with him. He glides over the soil-they glide with him; be bounds upon
the snow-they bound with him ; he shoots into the grove-they shoot with
him ; he darts across the lake-they dart with him ; he curves upon his course-
they curve with him ; he turns upon his track, he bounds, he shoots, he dartl,
he turns, and curves again-they keep pace with him in all his evolutiona.
}leanwhile, the rustic hunting-horn, to encourage their languishing ardpr,
resounds afar in cheering tones, The hounds, well nigh exhausted, dart oat
their scarlet tongues, and redouble their' ardor at these merry notes. Their
baying grows hoarser, a cloud ofvapor rises from their heated bodies-yet they
still follow the stag and keep pace with him. At length, however, the fate~
1eem to tum against the hunted victim. Strength gradually abandons him ;
he begins to slacken his swiftly·flying steps; the hounds gain upon him;
the hunting-horns resound around louder and louder ; his steps are fainter
and slower ; the hounds almost touch him ; he makes a last P.lfort ; they
they make a stronger one ; his strength now fails him irrecoverably; at last
.he falls; and the bounds, almost breathless, fall upon him, uttering in a
. faint chorus the last baying sign of their well-earned victory and merited
. .ucce& The buntel'l, now gathering around the dying stag, give him the final
blow, &Ad prepare for new sports!

46. Odaen, more peaceful in their tutea, chooee the lea fatiguing, though
perhaps not lea dangeroua wilater sports. They are seen gathering in numer-
ous crowda upon the frozen surface of a broad river. The atmosphere ia
milder than oaual-the Sun, for the first time in many days, at last presents
himself, and promises a few hours of his pure though faint light. The wind ia
ealm, the ice glitters, the snow melts upon the borders of the wooda. Soon
the crowd form an immense circle. From the centre of it start forth, at once,
amid the cheerful plaudits of the multitude, a number of lively skaters, who
glide onward in all directions, like the various rockets of a circular piece of
fire-work simultaneously kindled. Now they suddenly curve upon their rapid
course, while bending gracefully aside, to preserve their equilibrium. Now
they dart forward upon a straight line. Now, describing a broad curve, they
Cl'OIII the whole breadth of the river. Now, returning upon a zigzag line, they
lboot forth to the left, then to the right, and then forward. These, gracefully
bencling, glide upon a continued circle, with an imperceptible propelling ~
tion of the knee ; the&P. describe an oval, a triangle, a polygon of a hundred
.&des; these attempt to sketch a landscape ; these, crossing theirarms, take a rec-
tilinear &tart, and shoot forward with the rapiclity of a stone flying from a
whiatling sling. While others, suddenly stoppingUJlOn their cutting heels, ia
the midat of a rapid run, start back, turn, glide hither, glide thither, alwaya
.eeming to fall, and always stancling firmly; always seeming to atop, and
alway• gliding around; always appeiuing as if falling upon each other, and
always avoicling each other in a hundred curvings, turnings and winding..
Now two are ~aen running against eachother-their course is lightning-like-
they tremble to meet each other-they intend to curve in passing near each
other; but, failing to shoot upon opposite aides, they both tum upon the same
par.allel-ahock each other with tremendous violence, and fall simultaneously,
bruW!d and stnnned, one upon the other! At this terrible fall, a burst of lou4
laughter from all the spectators greets the t\Ullbling heroes, the crowd in their
merrinea soon rush in a host toward the unlucky skaters: these to help them,
thoae to 1p0rt at their misfortune.
A wedding party, whose heroine-a maiden in the bloom of youth-
rides in a light and graceful aleigh, drawu. with silken cords of braided
nbboos by the akating grooms-men in gallant humor, approaches the ani-
mated scene. Happiness, life, health, wealth, appear to flow from the bride'•
lovely countenance, and lpalkling emourage. At her approach the crowd
ptheraroundinnumerousandmore numerous groups. Young and old, maiden
and matron, all wish to catch a glimpse of her blooming brow. The happy
partner of her buddh1g future, u.ow opening for her under such merry auapicu,
feels his heart swelling with a noble pride. But, lo ! a tremulous agitatioa

of desultory people; a louder noise ariees from the borden tJt the· mer; the
ice cracks and break11 in a hundred fragments·; and the whole crowd-akaten,
bride, groom, and spectators, in an undivided mWIB-sink beneath the crackiq
mrface ••••••••••and then, the floating ice uniting again upon tbf.m, all enter
into the solemn silence of the tomb. The Sun sinks in his tum beaeath the
border of the horizon ; the stars twinkle on the silent vault ; the clouds roll ill
huge masses beneath their gentle light ; the wind blows colder and colder ;
the river freezes again in all its broad expanse; and the Aquilones, quiverm,
in all their limbs, look upon their own work with astonishment and awe.
46. Such are the scenes of the winter, amid the abodes of men, in the
temperate latitudes. There the presence of man, with his civilization, cau
alter, mitigate, and dissemble its horrors, and even tum them to his advan-
tage and pleasure; and the Sun by his presence can render the scene lea
melancholy. But how much more terrible, how much more gloomy, death-
like, though sublime in its very gloom, does the polar tone appear, during the
six months of the Sun's absence from its tomb-like solitudes! What pencil
could descnbe those agglomerated mountains of ice ; those craggy precipices
overloaded with unfathomable depths of snow, of hail, of ice J those roaring
avalanches which, 1n their rolling course, bear along, buried in their deep
bosoms, fragments of rocky mountains, and rocky ID8.Sie8 of iee ; those con-
ltant falls of mow ; those broad frozen oceans; those gorgeous arches of the
aurora-borealis, beside whose glowing tints the flowers and the gP.ms grow pale1
The magnificence of those sublime scenes, witnessed only by the few ~tea-moo­
sters inhabiting those desolate and inaccellllible regions, i• beyond the faint
conception ofman.
No voice is there heard, save that of the tempest, which dies upon the
porous snow, like a sound produced in vacuum, or reverberates in faint ecfl()ea
from the icy mountainl of the IUrrounding aolitudea--eolitudes a thousaDd
times more frightful than those of the tomb;-for there, at least, thought rests
in an eternal sleep, and cannot comprehend all its horror. The only move-
ment which seems to interrupt the death-like stillness of those silent vut--
.nesses, is that of the thick flalces of snow, which fall at each inatant, whirled
about by the ahivering breath of the winds.
WINTER alone reigns 80\"ereign over thisVlUJt empire of frost. The imagin-
ation involuntarily pictures him, horror-ctruck at his own work, ~baking ever
and anon his mowy beard, and disengaging from it with dUiiculty the icicle&
formed by his condensed breath; he seems to throw an icy glance upon this
ICene of silence and deadly cold; he seems to repeat at inte"als, shivering
·through all his limbs, and chattering his teeth, " How cold it ia ! bow cold it
is! !''

are less and less frequent ; the clouds appear less dense, less dark, le11 cold and
melancholy; man at last begins to strip hls ahoulders of the heavy furs of the-
beast-and to that first llllile of nature, just awakening from her death-like
llumber, be anawen every where with a joyful smile of bappineaa and dee~
felt gratitude.-What baa betln the cause of such a happy chuge throughout
all nature1 Nothing but a alight iDCreue of the solar rays falling lea~ and
leaa obliquely upon the higher latitudes!
Finally Spring, overturning the icy throne of Winter, seata hel'llelf in his
place, with all the pomp of her fertility and lovelineaa, crowned with ftowen
of a hundred tints; while variegated carpets of fresh and luxuriant verdure
spread themselves at her feet throughout all the surface of her re-conquered
empire. The joyful month of May opens broadly ita univeraally-budding
dominiona to all the life-giving in1l~aencea of the great diapen~~er of light now
ascending in polar altitude with daily-increasing velocity. His animating rays
now fall more directly upon the temperate regiona, and penetrate every thing
with heat, life, and motion. The glaciers of the polea themselves, breaking
uunder into enormous maaea, with thundering crackings, beneath the aimple
action of his gentJe warmth, float in a thousand islands towarda the melting
equator, there to vanish in rising vapor. From this moment all in nature is
impregnated with a loving animation. Animals, insects, fishes, birds, and
plants-every senaitive and organized being, in both the animal and vegetable-
kingdoms-seem at this time to converge irresistibly towards one great universal
and sublime centre of attraction : love-universal love ! The earth herself
appears to leap with joy under the •me impreaaion. She coven, almost
instantaneously, her winter nakedness with a lively mantle of green tnrf,
sprinkled with virgin flowers, whose first appearance always awakens m the
reflecting mind 10 many sweet recollections !•••
Soon the trees of the foreats are again covered with new leaves ; the pima
of our gardens and orchards are soon blooming with new flowers ; tht>ir cir-

~ while ago, the st~rmy winda of tbe north were raging with fury, now the
calm and balmy zephyrs of the spring are sovereignly reigning, and playing
upon the wings of butterftiea and the wild flowers of the fields! The wooda,
until then silent and deserted, are suddenly re-peopled with U1eir warbling
inhabitants; the meadows, abandoned during the winter, are again covered with
innumerable ftocka and herda of animals pasturing in silence ; the grasa of the
Brairies, and the leaves of the forests, are again covered with hummiag antl

Meanwhile, the earth continues rapidly to advance in her etherial eoane,
and the sun to ascend in polar altitude. The days are perceptibly longer ; the
atmosphere is warmer; the sky is purer ; the winds are gentler; and as the
IOiar rays now begin to penetrate the surface of the globe with all their ener!-
gies, all nature appeara to be conTUlsed with a superabundance of life. Every
organized being seems, at this time, to be bendtng under one similar necessity,
one same law-that of re-producing their respective species, in order 1lo aupply
the vacancies produced in their ranks by the deadly breath of the winter, the
fatal snares of man, or the cruel talons of their unmerciful enemie~. The
lignal of obedience to this great and irresistible law of an all-wile Creator, it
fint given by the winged population ofthe woodR. They are soon seen build•
ing their nests with a joyful activity ; and their melodioua warblings,·BoW
tweeter and more harmonious, echoed around like an uni..-ersal hollllnna,·sal~
every morning, in their universal chorus, the more and more briUiant ascen!
lion ofthe orb ofday, whose vivifying light they seem to feel and know to be
the only cause and the only source of all their paternal solicitude, of all theit'
material enjoyments••••
; But now we have attained the end of the Sun's glorioUI and majeatic earel'r,
the favorite month of Ceres-the "gilded mouth of June" ! Henceforth hie
empyreal splendor is absolute and undivided, while that of nature shines witl.l
all sorts of gorgeous splendors. Besides the sweet and fragrant dowers wbicll
furnish to the humming-birds, the bees, and the butterflies, their p~rfumed
aliments, our fields, orchards, and gardens are now strewed with all sorts of
ripening crops, with all sorts of savorous fruits. And it is also from thii
moment only that man, entirely forgetting the hoiTOrs of a rigorous winter, feela
that he truly enjoys, though so little grateful for them, all the bounties of bene-
Yolent nature, all the charms and beauties of her infinitely-varied productiona,
all the bleiiBings of his Creator ! ...

feeble hints, that the &eience of astronomy may afford otlur pleasures to the
mind than those of retaining mathematical proportiou and abttractiODI, my

Unquestionably, No.
The wulei'Btaoding of the 111blime harmonies existing in the planetary
creation, without the knowledge of these elementary factB concerning their
individual and reciprocal relationa, cau no more be attailled, than the Ull.der-
atanding of the anatomical structure of man could be realized without tbe
combined knowledge ofhis myology, osteology, neuralogy, etc., etc., comprising
the various phases under which man must be anatomically studied, to be syn-
thetically and analytically understood. Tbu., astronomy is divided, as we han
teen, into several branchea of study, which must all be inveat.igated in order
to obtain a perfect UDdel'ltaoding o{ the science. These various branche. are
included in the thwee principal onea, denominated qhtri''tal, tluoretical, and
,Ay.ical• astronomy. As to the knowledge arising from the atudy of the.e
~ous_departments of the science, special treatises exist, by which alone it i8
imparted. What tDC have to study, by the application of our system, it that

relatiwely to ttU:h other. But the various members of the planetary system,
including the asteroids, the Sun, the .Moon, the satellitt:s of the upper planets,
and the rings of Saturn, amount to no less than thirty orbs.-The arithmetical
elements of each orb can be carried, if desired, to as many as fifty, with an
averagte of at lPaBt ten figures in each elemenL Fifty times ten would be,
therefore, five hundred figures; and the orbs being thirty in number, five
hundred times thirty would, consequently, give no less than fifteen thouaan~
figures to be remembered in relation to the simple elements of the solar system!
49. Now, we may ask, can the natural memory, however transcendant may
be its powers, and however impressible and tenacious its faculties, grant to any
living being the possibility of remembering such an awful array of figurea,
with the perfect certainty of being able to recall them at pleasure 1
The anner ;., unhesitatingly, No. And he, who would answer 'otherwise,
I would qualify with still less heaitation as a Quixotic pretender.
50. On the other hand, can the same feat of recollection be accomplished by
the usiltance of the philosophical application of our system1
Unquestionably, Yea!

DISCOVERY OF MY FIFTH FUNDAMENTAL BASIS.
·!H. Among the various studies which had by turns captivated my attentio~
Iince my earliest days, that of astronomy was by far the most suited to my taste.
Yet, as I observed in my introduction, the invincible antipathy of my memory
to the retention of figures was a molt formidable obstacle to the best of my
endeavors in the recollection of astronomical numbers and proportions, without
the permanent remembrance of which no man can say that his knowledge of
the science is complete.
52. No sooner had I succeeded in rt>ndering the hint of Feinaigle available
lor my purposes in the mnemonization of statistics and dates, than I immediately
began to seek for the right proceBB by which an astronomical nomenclature of
all the elements of the science might be mnemonized with a degree of sim·
plicity, and power, equal to that which the aystem had allowed me to avail
myself of in other important applications.
53. My first care was, of course, the examination of the means which all
the authors upon the subject of artificial memory had used for this purpose.
• But I found that the various proceBBes which they had employed ended, like
all their other applications in an inextricable maze of aymbolico-local unintel·
ligibilitiea.
54. When, on my return from my first tour around the world, I met with
Aime Paris in Nantes, I was not a little surprised and disappointed to see that
he h1d devised no means whatever for the mnemonization ofastronomical facts •••
On looking over his programme of facts, which I have still by me, I saw that
the means had also failed him there, for he bad only ai:J: of the elements of the
planets mnemonized, while his programme was crowded with geographical
1~1 facts of the most palpable indifference; and my conclusions must have
been correct, for not only have these six elements never been increased by the
illustrious Paris, but he has never indicated, in any one single imtance up to
tl&is day, in any one of his several UJOTka, in what manner he had himself mMo
monized those astronomical facta, OB. IN WHAT MANNI!.& THOSE WHO MIGHT WISB
TO DO SO FOB. THEin OWN U!IE OB. PLEASURE, SHOULD PROCEED IN THE CASE !
55. I was then obliged to continue my meditations and repeated experimentl
upon this interesting topic, with the same degree of perseverance which I had
been obliged to devote to the variou11 plans of improvements which I have
spoken of in the preceding lectures.
56. Is it necessary for me to attempt a description of the mental toils which
I underwent in my search after this other "philosopher'• stone"-this " Golden
Key to the Kingdom of the Universe" l A volume would not suffice to expre•
the number of experiments, attempts, essays, alternately proposed, rejected.

resumed, and finally abandoned for new ones, which I succesaiYely :p~~~~~ed tm4l
re-passed through the crucible ofmy investigations. Suffice itto aay, that duristg
more tlum twentJ yeara of my existence I daily employed a portion of my
meditauona upon thia acma of my syatem, with no more succeu than on the
irst day when I first thought of solving the problem.
57. At last Mnemosyne, listening to my anxious vows, came to my assistance,
as she had so often done in other difficult circumstances. But it appears that,
l!aving determined in her divine wisdom that thu application of the system,
intended for the most sublime works of creation, should become the most
brilliant one of the whole system-as you will soon be convinced, and judge
for yourself-she decided that the discovery of this grand principle should be.
made in the grandest and noblest spot known upon the whole surface of the
globe : The falls of Niagara !
58. It was in the year 1842, during one of those lovely and enchanting
nights which are often enjoyed in that sublime location, during its cool and
balmy summer. I was sitting on the very brink of the terrapin rock, near the
foot of the round tower-that ne plus ultra projection, which tremulously over·
hangs the roaring abyss of the horae-shoe fall-meditating, as was my custom
and pleasure, upon the solemn majesty of the sublimely-solitary scene around
me, and the vanity of human fame and concerns, when compared with the
works of the Creator, the vastness of immensity, and the eternity of time.
The sky was remarkably pure and serene; the atmosphere refreshing and
balmy; and the stars and planets, in all their brilliancy, were twinkling upon
the deep dark vault with all the solemn grandeur which I have attempted to
describe in the first part of this lecture. While gazing at Jupiter, at that
moment passing over the meridian, I happened to make the following mental
remark: "Oh, Jupiter! monarch of the planets! by thy volume and splendor, aa
thou wert king of the gods, by thy power and thunderbolts, how majesticallf
thou shinest in thy invisible path!"-and at once I stopped the tlow of my
thoughts, as if under the infatuation of a spell: for I had been suddenly struck
with an idea that seemed to me so grand, so pregnant with mnemotechnic
power and magnificence, that I trembled for a long time to move or breathe
for fear of finding myaelf awakened from a delusive dream.
At last I shook off my fear-I awoke from my lethargic immobility with an
exclamation of joy which would have silenced the thunders of the cataract,
had the powers of my lungs equalled the extent of my gratification : for I had
at last hit upon the long-sought-for desideratum-for I bad at last discoYered
the philosopher's stone: The golden key to the kingdom of the Universe~
"the most brilliant, powerful, elegant, and ingenious application of th~
system."
I will not speak of my long-continued emotions of pleasure, after I bad
dilcoured thia keyatone of this" temple of memory." I will simply enter

at oneeupon the chain ofthought which followed the fint hint, and tbe deriva-
tion of the principles upon which these applications are based.
ILLUITB.A.TJON OF TBB GQl.DU KEY TO TBB UNIVBB.BA.L JrulGDOII.•
~9. While thinking of the planet Jupiter as a god, or a being, I happened
to make the following mental inquiry : If, instead of thinking or speaking of
the planets as inanimate PLANETARY oB.Bs, I should uniformly follow the rule
of speaking and thinking of them B8 A.NIJIIA.TED BEINGS, oadotDefl fllith julings
taad pauion11 1 and if, instead of mentioning their elements as teclmicaL ele-
ments, I should make for each of them a lwmophonic analogy, representing one
of their vxmt11, prusilnu, characteristic ftaturu, etc., etc.,-would not the asso-
ciatioos thus obtained be more perfect, more imprelllive, more powerful, and
more accelllible to the recollective fae'Ultiea, than the dry 1110ciationa of
teclmioal enunciations with technical planetary words 1 And from the mo-
ment I had put this momentoua question to myself, the problem was finally
.alved ! I at first adopted, as ia shown in the tirst of the " synthetic tables,"
the namesof:
AroLLo- the god of poetry, for the ruling orb••••••••••••••••••The Sun.
MERcUB.Y-the god of thieves, for the planet•••••••••••••••••• •Mercury.
Vu.Nus-the goddeiB of love, for the planet•••••••••••••••••••••••• Venw.
CYIIELE-the goddess of Earth, for the planet••••••••••••••••••••• Eart!J.
DIANA-the goddess of hunting, for the satellite•••••.••••••••••••• Moo11.
MA.u.s-the god of war, for the planet•••••••••••••••••••••••••••• Marl.
JuPITER-the god of the goda, for the planet•••••••••••••••••••• •Jupiter.
Snn.N-the god of time, for the planet •••••••••••••••••••••••. Saturn.
UuNu-the goddess of astronomy, for the planet•••••••••••••••• Uranw.
And I mbsequently drew up a conditional nomenclature of some ofthe moat
important elements of the planetary system, as represented in the pages of
facts accompanying the subjoined "principle• ;" I classified them in the order
represented in page headed "GoLDEN KEY," etc.; and argued thus: the word,
expressing the distinct 11ocial position of men belonging to a certain d!stinct
class in society-such as, for example, the Catholic clergy-is that of Ilier-
archy. We say the clerical hierarchy, and the word hierarchy means, in this
sense, the distance existing between an individual of an inferior grade of this
body and one belonging to a higher grade or position.
60. If,.then, I should consider only the hierarchical positions of the god8 in
regard to each other, mythologically, the word hierarchy itself will most ele·
gantly represent, for us, this planetary element, and afford us the possibility of
making a very distinct formula for each planet, without the least fear of con~

'-ion (llrololtpl tJ!td l..U ~). And, indeed, yoa ll88t thai, in the
mnemonization of the nine principal planeta, we would have been obliged te
make nine formulas, beginning with the words :
The diftance of the pltmu ao-and..o, is••••••••etc., etc.
While, on the -other band, if, u ia shown in No. 1 of the "synthetic table
of the equivalents" of the" principlea," we say that,

how could we possibly fall into tho slightest confusion, in mentioning thil
same element-the dilt411ce of the planet from the Sun ! (tDGrm auprolon~
applawc).
61. Arguing upon the same principle ofreasoning, I formed the !wmophonic
analogiu of the second column of the " Golden Key" for each of the
elements classified in the jir1t column of the same table.
The principle of this application is so simple, so plain, ao beautiful, and il
made so intelligible by a simple glance at the table, that I should consider it
an insultto thejudiciousstudent, to attempt any further illustration of itsmechan-
icaladaptation. A simple perusal of the corresponding corruativ~ B!JIUmymes of
each element, is all that is necessary to remember them for ever, as the follow-
ing experiment will testify:
(Hen lhe Pllof'eelor R&d oaly no. ud aloud, all tbe elementa of &h• taN~• pldeD key"-

burall olapplaue.)
By perusing alternately the "synthetic table of the equivalents" (vide) which
I have adopted for each of the similar elements of each pel'llonified planet, you
will easily discover the principle upon which I have acted, at least in a great
many cases. Yet, u these eqr~ivaluua of each god are based upon the· mytho-
logical character o{ every one of them, and as it may happen that some among
the wanne~t admirers of the system might not be sufficiently acquainted with
their mythological history to understand at once the justness of these.relations,
I have thought it indispensable to add to each planet a "Biographical Sketch"
of the god, intended to give a more complete understanding of the "equiva-
lents.''

vividly strike the sensible and intelligent student, ad give him m additional
proof of the curious and intereating reeourcea which the philosophy of the ayto
tem can allow.
Let me remark, however, that neither these "Biograpaies" nor the lfUiwo

To obtain the answer he will•y:
Dirtance is hierarchy. In the hierarchy of the gods, Apollo pre.ridu omr t.W
.Mwes:
. Divinities which resided, etc., like one •••••••• •ltappy mule nation,
which gives pe, me, ke, ne, she, or 93,726,000 miles with the addition oftbree
zeroes; for it will strike the student that the Sun must be at a greater distance
than 93,726 miles from the Earth.
The following is the manner in which the student will obtain the answer fbi-
any given element of any given planet: he must first call, mentally, for the
correlative (in the first column of the table) ; next for the equitNdt.nt of tJrit
correlative; and then for the phreno-mnemotechnic tDorcl, which will readily
come to his recollection without the necessity of the connecting phrase.
I have added to the formulas for the Sun, a " synthetic table '' of the com·
ponent elements of the formulas, that the student may 1ee the great advantage
there is in refreshing his memory upon these syntheses, when the formulae
, have been once learned with perfect certainty. A similar table, in writing,
should be neatly made in the IllUDe manner by tbe student himself for each
planet.
TUB SYMPATHETIC B:EY,
98. 7. As it may be that the student would like to learn the formulas for
each planet, in their nomenclatured order, I ha-..e added a table (t!icle Princi-
ples), which I have called the "sympathetic key," by the assistance of
which, he will be able to do so in the easiest imaginable manner; that is to say,
If the student desires to know which eqvitNJlent corresponds to any given
number of the nomenclature, or any given number of the nomenclature being
propoeed,which equi?HJlentcorresponds tothat number-eitherwayenablilaghim

ntt1116er of the ll'Omenclature of the table beaded "the sympathetic key,''
already referred to,-and then, the formulas in the next table, for these same
lttr~ttophonic equi'NlentB. The simple pronunciation of the articulations of each
mmber contains a part, and sometimes the whole of the homophonic equ-Walent•
which I have adopted-the intelligent student wiD at once perceive how easily
and rapidly this table andits formulas can be learned. Indeed, asingle readingis
very nearly all that is necessary, as a single experiment caa prOTe ; and this is the
reason why 1 have given the name of " Sympathetic Key" to this new tabl~.
I will remark here that the articulation DB has been constantly adopted from
,.,. to nineteen, in order to avoid uncertainty of the mind, which a mixture of
TR, and' Ds, would likely have occasioned. As 11000 as be baa mutered tbe

The words, inclined accessory, will bring to the mind the word demi-god;

(applause).
Thil method of questionipg is merely intended to show the pliability of the
ayltem. The preceding manner may be used to great advantage ;-for the
student may wish to writP. down in succession, from first to lut, all the
elements of the planets in their adopted nomenclature order; and be could not
possibly succeed without the assistance of the " Sympathetic Keys" and their
fonmdas.
A few experiments will prove the truth of this assertion.

88. Bot to appteeiale better tbe extreme illgenutty and beauty p~
over,the whole composition of these formulu and their aasociatwna, let WI rea4
one by one, as a matter of experiment, the formulas and phreDo-mnemoteohiaic
biography of one of the planets,taken at random I (loud opfllGUU).
(Here the Professor read to the audieace all the formulu ofV--, and allo her phHao-ame.IJlOo
teclwlc biopaphy. The repeated and enthusiastic bursts of appla1111e which interrupted the leo-
CUrer, durjpg &hia reeding, and his ingenious esplanation, protracted this exercise to nearly •
hour's l~ngth. After which, wilh eyes spark&g with the eDthusium of this triumphant ~,
the Profeuor tbu resumed his diRourn.)
Now I will ask the candid hearer, is there, in the whole syatem, thus far
illustrated, any application of its principles more simple, more powerful, more
intelligible, or more ingenious1 Is not this part of the system alone, worth u
much, in point of excellence as well as ingenuity, all the rest united 1 Js
not this, as I have said in my prospectus, "the most elegant and brilliant of
my phreno·mnemotechnic discoveries 1" (thundera of u.pplauae here greeud tlae
lecturer, la!ting u. minute or more).
Jrepeat, ladies and gentlemen, that 1 should consider it an insult to the sound
judgment of such an enlightened audience, to expatiate any longer ·upon the
true merits of these phreno-mnemotechnic applications. :M:y conviction is
that any farther explanations would rather weaken than improve their intt!11i·
gibility.
99. Yet, before concluding this topic, a point of some importance remains,
which I must illustrate, lest the student should fall into temporary emba~
ment ; I mean the reason of certain dashes which follow some of the pbreno-
mnemotechnic words, in the formulas for each planet, and the apparent
omission of complemental figures in the words representing distances or pro-
portions in miles.
EXPLANATION OF THE DASBBB
In some Pkreno-mnemoteclanic Words of the Formulas.
100. By perusing withsome attention each column ofthe tables containing the
utronomical jigwu of the various planetary elementa (vide Principlu), the stu-
dent will perceive tbat all the proportions in itinerary measurement. have been

use in the u.deratanding ofthe element. of the solar system. [7- A larger table,
containing a greater number of elements, with more minute details, bas bees
.Wed to tM prQgraanw of my public i111rodvctorylecturu for the use of the
student who might wish, like mytelf, to adorn his memory on a larger and more
acientific scale.
Thue, for example, coluiDDJ 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 18, 20, 21, where measure·
:meat. in .ulu. are given, all the elements are in round numbers. Some givinJ

the Atmclre!U, and even Ia, 81 in column 11, which givet the lideral velocityof
the planet.. [I- Therefore, whenever an element containing only the round
aumberl hal been mneJDODized, the phre~mnemotecbnic tHrd has been
made with the articulation of the numbers alone, and the zeroes completing
the number have been left out of the word-the dtul, regularly following
certain words, is intended to indicate this, and nothing more.
Of thole colWDDI which represent arit!J~ proportions, eome have been
given entire, aome with more or le• decimals appended to the nominal quan-
tities, according aa the elements were more or le88 important.
Thoee which repre88llt MN, degrw, etc., have sometimee been given in
round numbers, aad sometimes with the day and the hour, the degree• and the
minutee, but nothing more, ae being of little importance for popular uae.
Now, the bad and IJlOit eilicient way for the student to become acquainted
with the character of each element, is to 1¢udy wtUJUy the arrangement of
the general table and ofeach column, which will enable him to know, at once,
when decompOiing a phreno-mnemoteclmic word, how to divide and place his
articulation~ : for let it be remembered that tAu lecture is not intended, aa bas
already been stated in its prefatory remarks, to tUJCA the science of astronomy
to any one, but limply to Wp the student alrtady aequaintetl with the science,
in the recollection of elements in nt~~r~bera, which the most wonderful powersof
ll&tural memory could not enable him to do, without tim Archimedean lever of
the system.
I will simply say, in conclusion, whenever the student will call for an ele-
meBt which will appear to him to be deficient in number, after he has decom-
posed the phreno-mnemotechnic word, he will merely supply the number with
u many zeroa u his sound judgment or his certain knowledge induces him to
suppose necessary to make up the element. I will further remark, that the
mteroith have not been noticed in the1e lecture., Iince matt of their elements
are uncertain. But the ltudent who may wish to mnemonize them, as they
aTe in the tables of the principles, will follow the 18DJe method that baa been
pursued with the other planets. Any attempt at illustratingthese explanations
by practical demonstration I should conaider u a supererogatoryuse ofwords ;
the student will easily do this for himself.
CONCLt18ION.
101. And now, ladies and gentlemen, that there remain• nothing else to br
illustrated this evening; now that, like the Sun at the end of a pure and serene
day, I am on the eve of parting from you, perhaps to meet again after a much-
needed repose of body and of mind; now that the first part of my career is
ended, with my last remark upon this last illustration of the present lecture-
permit me to add a few words before we part from each otber.

Allow me first to express to YOU' my deeply.felt gratitude lOr the kindaeu
you have shown me througbeut the whole CGune o( these lectures, during
which we have paa8ed together 110 ..any mirlhful Uld pleuing Jwua I (Zovd

I shall DeTer need the usiltanee of the ayatem to remember : the~e mu:b af
your kindness towards me-these friendly teatimonie• ol gratitlcation and
esteem which you ha"e shown me tince the beginning of our interOOUI'!Ie
(prolonged applnst),
May these friendly ditpoeitioaa never tade ia yourmiad,ad may they tluue
continue to tloat in my behalf &II loog 81 they .tball temain eosraved upon my
b'c!art and never-fiilling memory I (tkaft~U"B bvrat1 ef t~ppltJUH). I knew,
however, and I aineerely feel that I have hitherto dOllS but vety little to deserve
auoh entbuliutic marlill of conllal greeting~ (ndotlbled applmlu); but, like
Pandora's box, I have a luJ.pt remaining in tbe bottom of lBJ heart: that of
doing in the future 101Mthing tbat may render me, in my own eyea, IDOI'e
worthy of your contin•ed patronage, friendlbip, and esteelll (~ow ap-
plaUBe).
Perhaps I may BUCceed in seeing this hope :cealized in the BBCOlfD oouBH
which I have promised you, and which will have for ita objects the "applica-
tion of the system to the Ieeming of 1'f'9H, poet1J, aad l!JftlturgtB" (applllfl8t).
I hear a member uki.ng, " When will this second oourte be delivered 1"
Ladies and gentlemen, my intention, seconded by the coun~el of my frieada,
the expectations of other oommunitiea, the woo of di1fuliDg the knowledge of
the system, for the benefit of those who may desire aome intellectual advao-
tage by its uae, and, above all, the deftr& of aecuriDg, if posaible by my labors
and exertion•, a livelihood for my ehildreA (l<YIUl andpro~ applawe)-my
intention, 1 say, formed in colll1ideration of theae various motivea, is to deliver
the ll8ll'te course of lecture. ia fiye or lrix of the principal cities o£ the Unded
States. During tbia lhort, but unavoidable pilgrimage, I will devote all my
diepoable boun of tbe i.ay (giving only those of the even.iDg ·to my lec-
tures), to the contimultitm and preparation of the NEW l'RINCIPLEa upon which
these netO appliC«tiottS are to be baaed; and u soon as this work is completed,
which may be very soon, perhaps hebe thE.- end of the spring, I will COIDI'
before you, with my heart again filled with the hope of gratifying you no less
than in the past (applaU8e). This I promise to do soon-very soon, provided
however-for this restriction I cannot omit-provided my health, peace and
tranquility of mind is not diaturbed by any unforeseen or incontrollable con-
tingency; provided my tinu is not forcibly dt·awn from me by unavoidable
circumstances of an 1mpleuantcharacter l For example, it bas already come
to your knowledge that a few unprincipled persons, envious of my success,
and of the bread which I am endeavoring to earn for my family, have caused
me to w&ste a precious portion of my ti~e in defending my labors from their

--o-
IB the merarohy of the gods APOLLO pruidu ot~er t!u .Mwu. He
used to procure his Means of Existence by inspiring pods. His Ex-
ternal Appearance was that of a handsome young man. In his nocturn~
excursions he used a Hot-luminary as warm and bright as the electric jluitl,
which he had procured from an Earthly Relation, to whom he was like
afather. The Traveling-Vehiole in which he used to ride was a Greek
chariot. The Itinerary Measure with which he computed his distance!'
was an. E11.glish mile; and this vehicle had for wheels an Orbicular Hoop,
the circumference of which was exactly that of the circle ofOsymandyas.
He used to dress himself in the most Eccentric Fashion, wearing ex-o
elusively a simple vine-leaf. His Annual Evolutions were for traveling
through the Zodiac. When running, his Animal Velocity never exceed-
ed that of IS terrapin, and his most predominant Propensity was a decided
taste for composing poetry. The ancients gave him for his Inclined .Ac..
oessory, or emblematieal distinction, a Greek lyre. Hia Daily Occupa.
tton consisted in nothing but driving the Solar chariot. He had for eon~
dential Servant, a poet; and the Common Measure with 'vhieh he
used to distribute his favors to him was the cup of poetry; but his Scien-
tific Measure was merely a zero with a dot, 0. His Corporal Rotun-
dity might be compared to the size of a large pumpkin. His Book of
predilec,ion was a poetical keepsake. In his numerous travels he had for
geographical references a Square Map of about the size of the solar
1/Jblu. The 'l'enants of his eumerous temples were, of course, all pam
and artists. During the Saturnalia he usually auumed a Mask 01' Feature
expressing with great fidelity an inspired look; and in all the ball-rooms he
then visited his Favourite Dance was always a permanent whirling. The
alime~tary Parallel-Substance which he liked best was a kind of black
copal marmalade, of which he would take every day a regular quantity
measured with his Falling Weight, which was about equal to a double
ton. Fina11y, his Planetary Chuacter, has always been, and always will
be, that of Poetry and the Fine .!lrts.

ance was that of a roguish fellow. In his nocturnal excursions he used a
Bot-luminary as warm and bright as o:r:y-hydrogen gu, which he had
procured from an Earthly Relation, to whom he was like a nephetD.
The Traveling-Vehicle in which he used to ride was a steam-car. The
. Itinerary Measure with which he computed his distances was an eigluj
-ofon inch; and this vehicle had for wheels on Orbicular Hoop, the ciri-
cumference of which was exactly that of afinger-ring. He used to drest
himself in the most Eccentric Fashion, wearing exclusively a SpanisA
cloak. H1s Annual Evolutions were for highway exploits. When
running, his Animal Velocity never exceeded that of a race-horae, and hit
most predominant Propensity was a decided taste for B'IDindling. The
ancients gave him for his Incllned Accessory, or emblematical distinc•
&ion, a totml. His Dayly Occupation consisted in nothing but the
carr!ling of Jupiter's muaagu. He had for confidential Servant,a81Dindler,
and the Common Meaaure with which be used to distribute his fnvort
was a round purse ; but his Scientific Measure was merely •
·•'fDi-nged zero: tt • His Corporal Rotundity might be compared to the
si :e of a filbert. His Book of predilection was tJ police rtgisler. In hit
numerout tmvels he had for geographical references a Square Map
of about the size of a red passport. The Tenants of his numerou•
temp1at were, of course, all thievu. During the Saturnalia he usually
assumed a :Mask or Feature' expressing with great fidelity a roguia4
look; and in all the ball-rooms he then visited, his Favourite Danoe
was always the galopade. The alimentary Parallel-Substance which
he liked the best was a kind of CfJit lead marmalade, of which he would take
every day a regular quantity, measured with hls Falling Weight, wbicll
was about equal to a grain. FinaUy, his Planetary Character, hat
always been, and will always be, that of dialwneaty.

fighting battles. He had for confidential Servant, tJ ~aldier; and the
Common Measure with which be used to distribute his fayors to him
was a tctJr·lulnut ; but his Soient11lo Measure was merely a zero with a
spear, t . His Corporal Rotundity might be compared to the size of
4 cherry. His Book of predilection was Vegetius and Polybiw. In his
numerous travels he had for geographical referoees a Square Map
of about the size of 11 campaign plan. The Tenants of his numerou1
temples were, of course, all silitary mm. During the Satumalin he
usually assumed a :Mask or Feature expressing with great fidelity

ln the Hierarchy of the gods UR.'\NIA presidu over tUtronomy. She used
to procure her Means of Existence by teaching aathematit:l. Her
External Appearance was that of a learned female. In her nocturnal
excurllions she used a Hot-lunlinary as warm and bright as a lantern.
which she had procured from an Earthly Relation, to whom she was 11
sister-in-law. 'fhe TraveJins Vehiole in which she used to ride wae &
country wagon. The ItineraryMeasure with which she computed her dis-
tances was an Ercglish mile; and this vehicle had Cor wheels an Orbicular
Hoop, the circumference of which was exactly that of the circle of Osyman-
dytU. She used to dress herself in the most Eccentric Fashion, wear-
ing exclusively an azure Greek robe. Her Annual Evolutions were for
astronomical discoveriu. When running, her Animal Velocity never ex-
ceeded that of a cow, and her most predominant Propensity was a decided
taste for scientific studies. The ancients gave her for her Inollned Ao-
oessory, or emblematical distinction, a st:rtt~nt. Her Dayly Oooupation
c011aisted io nothing but ctlutit» ohtwvctiom. She had foreonfidentialSer-
van1, em awo110mer, and tbe Common Measure with which abe used to
distribute her favors to bel' was a telucopic tube ; but bel' SclentUio
Measure was merely 11 capital H, It'. Her Corporal Rotundity might
be compared to the size of 11 lemon. Her Book of predilection was 11 treati#
on tUtronomy. In her numerous travels she hnd a Square Map of about
the size of a map of the luaven11. The Tenants of bel' numerous temples
\\·e:e, of course, all astronomer1. During the Saturnalia she usually
assumed a Mask or Feature expressing wtih great fidelity a doctoral
look; and in all the ball-rooms she then visited, her Favorite Dance
was always the Wllltz. The alimentary Parallel-Substance which she
liked the best was a kind of beach tr~ marmalade, of which abe would take
every day a regular quantity measured with her Falling Weight, which
was about equal to a ton. Finally, her Planetary Character, has always
been, and "ill always be, that of studiousness and learning.

PHILADELPHIA CLASSES.

PBILADELPBU., Dec. 30, 1844.
DB.u. Sm z-Booa after tJae ebe of tbe sene. of l~tures in ~hich you
41eveloped to the largest classes ever assembled in Philadelphia your
iDgenioua system of Mnemotecbny, a meeting was held to devise and
uecute 1101ne plan by whidl your pupils might oprea~ their peraooal
respect for you, and their eltimation of the advantage and pleasure derived
from your iDJtruction&
The result was the purchase ofthe accompuying pieces of pblle, ad the
lllligmnent to me of the agreeable duty of transmitting them to you. I have
retained them in the poesession of the manufacturer until now, in the hope
that I !hould see you here in the autnnm, to deliver a leCOild. COUl'Be of
1eetures. But you have not revisited the city, and, perceiving by the
gazettes that you are in New York, tA route to Boston, I send tbem ~
your address by one of the expresses to that city.
I remain, respectfully, your ob'dt. serv't.

was the application of hiS SystPm to Astronomy.
There w:u more 5implieity, and at th" same time
more grandeur In the discovery, tbu in any ol
thmoe which he had previously unfolded. Hil
explanations were bJterspersed,as lllual1with wit
aDil learning, brilliant and unoslentalioas. Bit

niabes people with such memories, that they ba~
no fariher occasion for aote-bookl, tablets, •
memoranda. About that speecb-writlnc lJaslll-,
we have our doubts: but we beJieYe there Ia "ao
mistake" about ~tr.Gouraad'ssystem. We hate
seen it exemplified by his own il.lmolllooredlble
perforlll'lllces, and " bear wonders of the eftee&
produced on a private daa, whom he has Ilea
Instructing for 11 few weeks past. He begbls WI

.AilTU"ICIAL MEXO&Y.-That the power ol
memory may be greatly Increased by artllldal
means, has been clearlyproved by the results ot
IIWIY sylllt!1118 that have been deviRd. Our r~
ere, doubtless, remember that Mr. Gouraud, a
Frenchgentleman, who lectured on Astron~
tbecitylut wioter,exbibilt!dsome mort wo
ful specimens of his own powen~-re~atlniJ lm-
mease tables of.figures with perfect I&CCur&fiT aM
reodinetl5. He has been preparing to e:.<pJam W.
6J'Slem in public ~ and we unilerstand that he will,
witbio a few weeu, deli•er a aeries of Lect-
apon thesuhject. The Tribune &aJlltbat several
gentlemen and ladies of the city liave consenM
to bear public lt!llimony to the truth and perfecc
attainaliility of his system, by answering all 1M
questions tliat will be put to them bJ the audle-
.at his introductory lecture, from his ..-olumtnou.

J'r- tlleN. Y. CoiU'.cmd Enquirer, Du. 8,1843.
AannCIAL MEMOIIY.-We alluded a H days
since to a ~ystem ofartificial m~ry,or Pl&rmo-
M11nnottchny, as he learnedly. but not q• he cor-
rectly call~ it, which Prof. GouJtAun, a Jo'rench
echolarnpw in this city,hudev~ed, nlhl which be
mtendsto teachusoon as hisarrangemeotscanhe
made. Such schemes arfl by no means unknown·
on the contrary,snl'ral havebeeaundentood ;;A
practised from the rt•motl'St&~Je•, and batt'pro•ed
more or lewo suc~e•bl'ul in lhung in the memory
many things which, to ordinary persons1 were
ll.lmost completely beyond its retLcti. ~?~ke bad
a system of this sort, though IK& artllicial and
elaborate than most of the others. The systflJie
founded upon locality and personilication,and that
of which Dr. Gre-y WI$ the outhor, are the three
with which the public are best acquainted ; bot
DOne of them have ever l:letn completely ~atis­
tactory, enol in fact they hate all been very ~o­
erolly ~tbaodoned .
Of the character and peculiarities ofProf.Gou-
raud'8 system we knew nothing whatever, tbout;b
we are assured by thuse who ba•e nwle theJDo
~~elves acquainted with il that it differs eut'ntial.
ly from all the others ; that it rejectll the princi-
ples ul"'n which they Me based, and takes Its
atart trom IUl entirdy dilferent point. But we
have had an opportllllily to witness •omt" of its
reHulta, which, we confellS, seemed to us in the
.highl'll degree wonderlill anol utooisbing ; lllld
as th•y are strictly matte-raof public interest and
. iUlpOrlance, we shall stale 1>0me of the mo•t
-strlki~ experiments which we witnessed on Sat·
urday evening at a small pril'ate party nt the
houoe of Prot~ Gouraud. There were pre~nt four
· or five yountr S"lltJemen, SC\'Crll.l young ladie~~,
teachel'll in eome oftho most res~ctahle schoob
In this city, and a number ot' children, who had
all taken a lt.w lessons in this mnemonical ort.
Prlntecl tables had been prepared, made up of
chronolugicol! dates, lon~evity of persons, lati·
tnde,, Qtld loqitudes, distances of t1lact>s, spc-
. c:llk !fl''lVitiea of different bodit>~, SCientific dis-
covrnes. distances of the ht'a~enly bo•lies, cubic
feet in each plan('!, ~izes of the stars, <lftl.~ltles,
. rail'~ of re~olution, possible populalion1 superli·
dal contl!nts, etc., of the hNnenly bocl1es, velo-
cities ofnil known motion~, J\nd, In short, of the
gt'('at.-t possible variety of c'ents and acta.
: These tables, compose~ ulmnat wholly offigure.a,
ha,·ing no mutual rcla11on wbnte,·er, U'Oflld occu-
py full thirty p<Jge.t of on ortaoo book; ond It Ia
not too much to say, that no common person could
commit them to memory by the labor of years.
' Yet these pupib, none o! whom had been wltb
Prof G. f.,r more than a fortnight, receiving in-
struction lor from one or two hours n d:~y, on
being asked the date ofanye,·ent, the size of'any

which v.·ere wilnessed by M~~rs. L. G. Clark,

nothing whatever of the manner in which they
are effected; but, wbethrr they are rroduced bJ
science, sy•tem or diDburi~, they are ar aU eY~ntt
most a>;toni~hing and wood~rful; and as such we
mention them. We under~tand thllt Prof. Gov.
JI.AUD (who, we regret to say, is at prerent at.
fticted with serious illnes!), in·ends •hortly to
make the who!~ matter the ~uhject of Fome pub-
lic lecture~, when np('rimer•ts with a doz<'n or
more Indies, ge-ntlemen and children, wUJ be

I am every day receiving a large number of

to extend my Yisits in various lllrcction~. As I
cannot find leisure to answer each of these let t~1
I ask your kind permission to occupy a smau
space in your columns to give publicity to my Jn.
teotlons. I shall not be able, myself, to teach
my "Jstem, excepting in the large citieP; but my
lotPntioo is to select a suitable number of young
geatlemen from my classes, those who appear to
have the requialle <"llpacity for teachln~, and send
them out to commumcate my system an any part
of the c.-ountry where a clnss may be made up.

ootbintr di.(/lwll-so perfectly simple Ia the mode

The class attending Prof. Gouraud's Mnemotet.h·
Die lecture5 now numbers tkirlun h1mdred. Tbb
ia decidedly the largest school we ever auendt:d,
aud a more in•~lligent or respectable or better
aallsfied set of scholars we never lilt among.
The Prof-or Ia well calculated for a popular
lecturer, and altholl!(h his foreign ldlolns and
peculiar manner of lllustration keep the cbA
continually on the laugh, yet every step of his
system is explained in a perfectly Clear and phi-
Jmopbieal manner. We believe the size of thle
clasS or Gouraud'sls unprecedented in the hiatorl'
or lecturing In this country i and even this eoula
be considerably increased, sJDce by the reports of
his pupUs of their entire l'atisfaction with the
feasibility, philosophy, aud beauty of the •Ys-
tem, it Is establlshea lit public eotimation. Prof.
G. is having daily applications from numbers for
lldml.ssiooa to the clasa, which he is obliged to

Psu:"o·M"EIIOTECRICY.-The very extraordi-
aary sensation, prodaced in this city, by Profea-
IIOr Gouraud's diScoveries in Mnemonics, and the
admirable lectores in which he make~ them pub-
lic, Is not destined speedily to pass aWI\y. Tbe
profoun~ philosop~y, o~ which ~is wonderful
systPm 1s based, will cla1m the admiration of po&o
terity; and the practical results have oDly to be
known iu order to be immediately and fully appre-
ciated. Wbat are we to think o! a sy~tem, whlch
can enable ordi.nary minds by a very ordinary
d~gree of attention to commit to memory whole
tables or USeful 6!1lti•tics, &ncl entire \OJUIII<'O of
prose an.! poetry 1 And when we arc told tbat
the fuels thus engra\"ed on the tablet or memory
are in.Jelible1 witb what teelings must we neces-
sarily regarct the discoverer 1 Docs he not •.,.,m
to be a man elcmted almost above humanity!
Are we not compellr•l to respect him1 Are we not
bound to be grateful1 No mon~y can pay for
the communication of 1111ch in••tiuable powers.
Th~ system must of course effect a complete
change in the present modes of education. We
wish Prof~nr Gouraud full suec:eas in the attaiD-
ment of t'OI'tune, which he richly delenea.

PIIRE"n-M"EIIIOTECII"Y·-The excitement pro.
duced In New York by Profe•sor Gouraud's dia-
coverles being still at Jts beilbt, the public mind
has not yet betn able to come out from the gene-
ral buzz, for the l'urposc of viewing the subject
In ite gnmd relatron,. We say its vand rela.
dons-and who, that unMrstands them, will deny
the propriety of our expression? The system
,.hich b now gradually unfolding iiRelf befor~
thirteen hundrt"d intl'llects In this dry, t'nlnrgea
to such an eztent the sphere of our faeulties
that its practical results mu&t of necessity .,.;

m'""lmowledg~.
In the Brat place, what are te be Its baria~
UpoD eduntlou I We c:nu eee at a glaace that the
old mrtbods of eemmaaicatillg instraetioa, will
be mb:jeeted almost immediately to a ra41eal re-
form. That there Is, at all eveala1much need ot
this, Dtlne will deny. What l.s C'dtiCatioll Ia our
common schools and academies I Is it not, ID
general, merely a mode of commnnieatiq facti
by which tbe me1n0ry is almost excluahely eftr•
ci8ed1 If then the power mmemory eau be ID-
t.'I'CIIsed to so ~eat an extent that th1!50 facta may
be acquired 1n one- finieth part of the time
hitherto det>med necessary, how eYideat It Ia that
the opportunities or eultivatill( the r-ill!
f'lllllllues, which M.ve uMJ•Ily 1!4,en pt'nlliued te
lie almost dormant, ,.Ill efl"eet an [mpronment
both i.o the art and in the eclence of education,

as Robert Burna ays,
"TMy dleo attend lite coU.Je eloo-,
Go matira aiNI- out-."
And why do tbey come out asses f for in troth
it cannot lie denl'!d that they too fre<Juently do.
The cause is obvious. Theil' reuonmg powers
have never been set to work ; they are mere ma-
chlnt's, receiving and returning, unchanged, cer-
tain quantities of literary DilUter. But hrnceforth
the ll.bor or committ~ to memory will be com-
paratively trilling; and studetJts wlU actaaDy be

of occupyin! themselves. We aU: onr readers,
whether the man who has brought about saela a

worthy of national gratitude f
We hue attended another of M. Gouraad'a
inimitable lectures; and really the more we study
his mar.,eJJons teachings the wormer oar eutbu-

techny, at the Mualeal FuDc1 Saloon, on Fridsy

audience or at least one thOilsancf bi nwnber.-
The lecturer collllllCIICed with some appropriate
remarks on the importaneo or memury, and iw
eapuhility of improvemeat ; he then referri'CI to
several of the most remarkable inatllnc:es of
strong natural memory, in aoeient and modt'l'll
days, and gave a aketeh of the vnrioas lmJif'l'ft>et
Bfatems which had befon devised for its arti.fi.
cial improvelllt'nt by means or the uaoelation
or ideas ; lmpre;!ll!f it strongly on the audience,
however, that thoagb from one or theae the firs&
hiat oC his present system was obtained yet the
eystem, as carried out, bore not the slightest re.
semblance to any one which hacl preceded it. or
cour&e1 no expmoation of his ploD was given, the&
~ing rese"ed for the lectures before the cl3&5H
about to be formed, but its eft'ec:ts wcre strlltingly
exemplified in the experiments whl~h followed.
Four young Jll!ntlemen anti two younglaclies, 't'ol-
unteers for the ~. frnm the Profe684W's lu&
c1alll! in New York, were introduced to the audi-
ence, who were requested to ,PUt to them que..

were distributed through the room, and which
were crammed full of q~ione, to which the

Adrian, Cleo1•atra, and Voltaire. He dwelt par·

approved of the religious opmions of the '-ele·

Intellectual power In the warmest terms ofadmira-
tion. One anecdote was related of Voltaireand the
king of Prussia, In which the poet promlsed, on a
certain occasion1 to read the monarch one of
lala best productions. He appeanod accordingly
at the time apeciJied, and read it off with empba-

At the clow, tbe king e:rpreaed himself u de-

heard a poem exactly similar recited by another.
Voltaire shook hia head with lncredobty, but the
king promised to coovlnt'e blm, and Immediately

king, and the poem was recited accordmgly, with

In this temper was about to quit the-ir pre&enee.

Many other Interesting anecdotes of a almilar
.kind wer~ r~lated-allgoing to prove tbe wonder-
ful power of memory in eome IDatancee.
Professor Gouraud c011tended that a universal-
Ity or Jrnowlrd~e could only t... obtained through
the inftut>nce of a r'!tentive memory, and he
dwelt with glowit!J eloquence upon the plen$urea
atlorded by this ~alued faculty ol'the mind. The
nm:ient f:gyptino•, he sni<!, bad re-gular lkhoob
of Memory, and he noticed, in dt"tnil, the •ystem
called "Joeality," diroeoYered by Rimonldes.-
AL<D, the ay"em of }'einaigle and of Doct. Gr..y.
These sy•tl'ms, however, bud little or nothing In
affinity with that of the Ptofeuor, although be
admittf'd that from them, he had imbibed a TiiJoed
hint. He tpoke of hi• own plan with enthusiasm
and confidence-. He would not only dMcribt h to
his pu_ril,, but he would teach them to prat'tiae
it~ prmdplet1. It was hlrhly phllotoplile, and
woriderfully ~werfuJ. lie himself had befr.
greatly aston111hed nt Its results. They had far
wrpassPd his most sanguine expectations. But
be would introduce o lew of his pupils from New
York, who had kindly 'I'O!nnteered for the pur-

dispOsed to be quite skeptical, we are convinced
that there Ia real merit in the system. One can
lelll'll more dates by it in an hour, than without
It, in a day. It Ia baaed In simple, and truly
phUoeophlcal principles, and must take a ~h
place among the •dilicoveriea aad improvements
ofthe age.

MM&JIOTECB!IY.-All the town seems to be
busy, just now, with Professor Gouraud and hla
science of Mnemotechny, or, as they 011ed
to call the science when we were younger,
Artificial Memorr.. There hnve been many
1\ltem('tS to clUSlfy association of objects and
ideu m the mind, as an aid to memory ; but
110body (ct'rtainly nobody In tbla country) bas
ever so well aacceeded In teaching the use, and
making the application, as Professor Gouraud.
T/u ruull• •1toum by hu pupU• art lruly•tonder·
ful; and the nttention accorded to the Profes-
""''olectores, by many of the most learned nnd
Intelligent among our populationh Is a compli·
ment which, we believe, is u we deserved, as
it ia highly gratifying to the Professor. HP
brings from New York the highest testimonials
in favor of his mode of Instruction, very large
cluset of profes.~onal geutlemen havlugattended

CoJIIhJKicATroM.-Mr. Editor :-My :mention
hu been called to a sneeriug article In the Daily
Chronicle, of I••terday, upon Prof. l".ourand aad
his IJ&Iem of Moemonicl. The writer (the
editor, I suppoae,) professes to treat the subject
fairly ; bet the whole drll\ of hi• rl'Dll1rkA is so
evideoU:y calculated to raise unjust prejudices
io the mmd& of the clus, and to procure a con·
demoation of tha system, by forestallin3' a de-
cision uf the ml\iority, that I cannot refrs1n from
expressing the utter dissent of at least one humble
individual, from the sentiments of that article. If
I thought that I was alone in this opiniou, I
would keep It to myself. If I were sure that nny
one of the hundreds whom I know 1.o be highly
rtea.sed with the IIJI!tem of Proftlnor Gotuaud,
and who are better able 1.o l!xpreSB their llllti&tlJc.
lioa than I am, woald do 101 I would be silent.
At aU eveuw, I wlll110C t1eepU1 10111 ~ )'IJIIr
columna, or upon the patieace of ywr rea.leia.
The first remark of the editor, which I con.
ceive to bP nn1lllr and unCillled for, is tha ioslnua.
tlon about the Professor's having rloptd1 aa Ire
eltl1[111ltly Ierma it; after whleb, he "a..ilurlala
with faint" denial, by adding that be !*MDII it
was not ao. Now, the writer must have known tbllt
ProfeliSOr G. was ill, and It was unfair, 1r not
unmanly, for blm to mate the im]'H&Slon 'Which
these words must leue upon the millda of miiiiJ
of his readers. Reputations may be murdered,
as well as mote material thlnS!J and people may
begtll, after a while, to asmne some I!Dl"fer
llllualon, some murdftoal mean!Dg, to tbe ae-
bel'•cry of Daily Chronic-kill.
s to the merits of the s~tem, lhe editor
obst'rvee: "We nggested a doubt, In the begin·
Ding of Its senenY pnetleal use." Now, may
Dot the early exprellion of tala doubt have ~
IbiD§ to do with the article in question 1 " CooaWt·
ency, thou art a jewel," but the desire of belni
thoughtto posseSB thee, often makes ns do strange-
things! We are ell more or U. liable to eJ:·
hibit the foible of wishinlt things to turn eat •
we bad predicted. I tofd 1(111' 10, Is often pro-
nounced with as much digmty as ·if It were one
of the saying>~ of the seven wise men of Greece;
aDd may not the editor of the Chronicle have
entertsliled a secret wish. pous.ibly1 even tmeb-
served by himself, that the system would prove
to be valueless, because he bad predicted that
this would be the cue 1 Come, come, Mr.
Cbronicle1 have more cllll<lor than to cry down a
ftlnable unprovement, In order that yon may
have the satislllction of saying 1.o every body

The writer acknowledges that the ayslelll
may, to those who have the Ume and patience to
wade through the drudgery of mastering It,_~
the means of accompllaJiing, or rather aecur"''l',
a good deal of matter, of a certoiA kind. (The
ltallcsl!l'e his). Now, I consider it incorrect in
the extreme, to speak of wading and drudgery ill
connection with a system for aiding the memoi'J,
so eminently euy of acquisition. If I can, 111
two hours, fix Indelibly on my memory a stries
of most Important facts, which I could not Ieana

lecture; and It Ia most UDjust to say, that if the
Profeuor doee nat aliafy the wonderfully-mieed
eipectations of his audience, be must "look out

cle-Ud Ia it DOt an e:rpresaion manifestly calcu-
lated to ucite a tumult- disturbance l And if
the last lecture should end in a riot-if the audi-
ence should " get mud and break thlogs," will
not the editor of the Chronicle most justly have
earned the reputation of being the prime mover
of it l But I should beg the pardon of the class
for speakingof such a thlog, even hypothetically.
I am very sure there is too much good sense and
good teeling in that highly respectable body of
ladies and ~entlemcn, to allow of any thing else

There are several other things that might be

kuew him to be a man of steady and laborious habits, excelling in the beau·
tiful art for the improvement of which he has made, as we Jeam, so many
•orifices; but, what we would not have thought from his unaNuming life
among us, and which his new situation has accidentally brought to our
knowledge, is that he should be possessed of such extraordinary powen u
a lecturer on the sciences, particularly astropomy, as those we had the
pleasnre to see exercised last Saturday evening. We might say, without
exaggeration, that what we then saw, surpassed in wonder even the meeha-
aism of the beautiful instmment he intends to illustrate.
"Invitedby Prof. G. to attend, with other gentlemen, some scientific ex·
perimenta he woald make, to show his frieada how he proposes to leeture
with the Planetarium, we aaw the following, the a~alysis of which, no
doubt, wiJI mffi.ciently prove that two great attractions an to viait, this
winter, 0111' large eastern cities. Prof. G. preeented to our eDJDination a
sheet of paper seventeen feet long by eighty inches wide, containing an
area, therefore, of more than 16,300 square inches, entirely eo•ered With
columns of smaJl and compact figures, symmetrically divided into various
compartments, and offered to repeat to us, tW.olutely fro- ftte~~CWJ, that

"These tables were divided among the company, who proeeeded Imme-
diately to satisfy their eager curiosity, or to dispel their doubt., by putting
questions toJhe Professor, according to his request. Here we must ay, in
brief, that, to our utmost astonishment, Prof. Gouraud fulfilled his pledge
to the entire ~atisfaction and amazement of the compuy. Every fact
aske~ of him waa answered, and put down upon a black board absolutely
fro• ~Mmory; and at the end of the IOirU, this black board, sixteen feet
long, by five feet wide, had been several times successinly covered over
with thousands of figures, each of them repre~~enting an interesting fact in
the lectures they are intended to illustrate.
"We regret that ourlimits do not allow us to enter into some more details
of the truly interesting experiments of Prof. G. The Professor says that
ne has acquired this wonderful strength of memory by the application or
use of an entirely new discovery in the science of Mnemoteehny, and of
which he proposes soon to give the benefit to hiifuture felJow-citizens, in
return, as he says, for the kind reception he has met with in this country.
We will welcome it by anticipation, for it certainly must be of immenee
\-alue. In the mean time, our contemporaries of the East will soon have an
opportunity to judge for themselves of these Herculean feats of memory.
We will merely state that, if Ru118ell's Planetarium is the finest piece of
American mechanism we ever beheld, it is but justice to say that Prof.
Francis Fauvel-Gouraud is undoubtedly the most astonishing specimen of
strength of memory we have ever seen. And therefore, if memory is what
makes the learned, and the teacher, as says Chancellor Bacon, Prof. G. must
certainly deserve the station which he now owes to his tried qualifications,
and where, with the immense powers he possesses, we have no doubt he
will meet with triumphant• and merited success.

Indian King to whom he first presented it, the king told laim

wheat geometrically doubled upon itself from the first equare
of the Chess-board dowa to the Jut, or sixty-foarth. 'fhe king
spuming at what he jud~ed to be a non~ensieal petitioD, un-
worthy of his royal m•n1fieence, ordered his graad treaurer to
· deliver ap to Sysla one million of measures of wheat, or, upon
the choice of Sysla, the sum of money equivalent to the price of
the same number of meaaurea. But the Bramin having 1naiated

HYPERBOLIC LOGARiTHMS NO. I.
------~-
A..
PHUNO-.MNE.MONECHNIC IMPORTANCE OF THIS TABLB.
IJ]"- A word on the origin of this table will show its importance
in the experiments, andjustifyitatitle.-In one ofmy experiments
before a few friends, on the logarithm1 of••lrihera, (of table 7,)
it was objected that a great calculating habit might possibly
endow certain minds with actifJity enough to calculate,e:eabrapto,
any mentioned logatithm of number, with the mere help of even
a common me17Wr'Y. In answer to such an objection, and in order
to show triumphantly the truth and strength of the method, I pro-
posed that 200 logar&thms should be extracted, at random, from
Caillet's work on logarithm•, and adapted to m.em!Jera entirely un-
connected with them, and offered to repeat them ALL, even jigure
by .figure, in leas than 48 hours. A positive challenge ensued.
I accepted it ; and 46 hours after I repeated the 2000 figures in
the way such as described at letter B, without knowing the title
of the logarithms they represented, what I am still ignorant of,
except that they were extracted from Caillet's hyperbolic loga-
ritlmu.-Could what is called natural "'emQn} possibly perform
such an Herculean intellectllal task 1 Admitting that this could
be performed, llow many years would it probably require, even to
a Jedediah Buxton1 And once performed, how long would those
figures probably remain stamped on the brain, ready to be hurled
forth at a first question l
---o-
B.
EXPLANATION OF THE TABLE.
IJ]"- Tbe bel~fou figures are indicative of the linu or raagea
of figures; dM! lig/&1-face 1 being included with tbe bold..face
~urea are iodieative of the number o/ or«er, or place, (in the
whole table,) of the foat fiKure of tbe line. For example: a per-
son inquiring for the whole figures of a line. will ask thus:
"Figures of line .-uch," say 22; the lecturer answers,
OU.5288397. Inquiring for the number of order of one of the
.figures of the whole table, the question would be thus: "iipre
2211" Tbe lecturer answers 0, or the fir•t figure of line 22.
Thus figure 222 is a 1, 223 a 4-, 228 a 3, 230 a 7, 231 a~ or
the first figure of line 23, aDd so on. Aad, in fact, if you com-
mence to enumerate from the 3 which begins line 0, and centi-
nue, (from ltj't to right,) till line 199, you will see that tbe 11th
figure of the table is the fo'at of line No. 1, or a 7; the 12thwill
bt; "4, the. 20th a 5, and the 21st and 22d, (or bold-face No. 2,
Wlth the hght-face 1 added to it,) figures 7 and 4, and so on.
Thus ~g. 591 of the table will be a 4o, (No. 69 bold-face, with
fi~. 1 ltght.face,) fig. 593 a 1; 599 a 3, and so on. Figure lOOl
~, ther
112
e~or~
118,(or No. 100, with light-face 1,) and so on.
11• g. WI be a 1, 1122 and 1123 a 9, and a 4, and so on.
