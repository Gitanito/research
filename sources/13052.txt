  		              		Experience Description   

    I was being choked and was losing consciousness. I was sucked backward into a gray tunnel. There was a flash of white light and then I was in the sky. The sky was blue and there were no clouds. I couldn't smell, taste or breathe, and I had no sensation of touch. I felt incredibly peaceful and calm; it was the most wonderful feeling I've ever experienced. Then I heard a disembodied voice that I couldn't see who it belonged to.  It said, 'Not yet.' 

  I woke up in my body unable to physically see for awhile until I literally drank in oxygen. It took me a while to regain my sight as everything was gray and foggy for awhile. Next came my hearing senses and after that my sense of touch.

Date NDE Occurred:   	 2000  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.    Criminal attack.       Life threatening event, but not clinical death   
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I knew that I was going to be happy in that place. There was nothing in this life that mattered and I felt happy being there. I was disappointed when I came back to  this body. I do not fear death.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I could see very clearly as  I was floated up into the sky. I could not see my body or the man choking me. When I was told 'not yet' everything was very gray until I regained my bodily senses.  
  
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      The voice was telepathic and disembodied.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     When I left my body it was through a gray tunnel that closed into a vignette [a picture that shades off gradually into the surrounding paper] leading into a bright light.  I found myself floating in the sky.

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I thought that when someone died that there wouldn't be anything after this life.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I heard a voice I could not identify.   The voice told me 'not yet' before I was thrust back into this body.

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     No       

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I felt entirely at peace, that nothing in this life mattered at all. There was no feeling other than Happiness,  serenity, and peace  
  
What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I was being physically abused a lot and had to maintain high vigilance.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I have dreams that inspire deja vu, places I haven't been yet. I could sense when my mother died and I could sense the presence of a very beloved pet when they died. Sometimes when I have a very distinct feeling that something bad will happen it does.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes      

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real       

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I have been in quite a few accidents but have not been back to that place. So I know when I'm going to survive. I do not intend on coming back the next time I'm in this place.
