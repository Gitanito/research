I was floating toward an open gate where the light coming from beyond the gate was brighter than the sun but soft enough that you could look at it.

The light was rapidly approaching me, through this dark and infinite space, and I understood that this light was two beings coming for me. Two beautiful beings made of light, I couldn't see their faces, there was only light. They seemed almost surprised to find me there, I felt like I shouldn't have been there. I felt them to be so beautiful and powerful; compared to them, I felt small, weak, lame and pathetic. I would have given anything to be like them and felt so far removed from them, in every way, like a mouse next to an elephant.  
  Probable NDE showing who we are and what happens when we come back to live on earth.   

    4931.    Rohit G Probable NDE     6/23/2021.      Anesthesia;Probable NDE 9225.       Non-Western Probable NDE from India.     There was a woman sitting on a table and three other persons. I recognized them as overworked souls who were receiving covid 19 patients who had passed to the other side. As I met each one of them we embraced each other. They were so happy while exclaiming thanks that I was back with them.  
  Probable NDE attributed to anesthesia.   

    4930.    Karen L NDE     6/22/2021.      NDE 9224.            I realized that my mouth was not moving and that the body was in a reclined position in the ambulance.

The blue light communicated with me a profound and powerful sense of love. I quickly ascertained that I was in the presence of the creator of the universe and in the presence of the holy spirit.

  NDE around time of cardiac arrest.   

    4928.    Leila D NDE     6/10/2021.      NDE 9218.            I knew that I was dead.  It was dark in the room, but I could see light. I was fearful at first, but the closer I got to the light. my feelings started changing.  All fear and negativity disappeared. I did not walk into the light, yet it felt like I was being pulled into it; it was like being slowly sucked into the light.This light was so bright, yet it wasn't blinding and it didn't hurt my eyes.  The light was soft and comfortable but brighter than looking at the sun.

    4927.    Mike C NDE     6/5/2021.      NDE 9216.            I could see all the planets and stars. When I focused my attention on anything, such as the Earth, it came to the fore in my field of vision. Throughout this experience, I felt incredible love that remains beyond my ability to describe. I also was aware that I was a part of everything I saw as well as still my individual self. I was both, the observed and the observer. I encountered my first born son who had died in infancy. Yet, here, he was an adult.  
  NDE due to heart attack with cardiac arrest.   

    4926.    Anne L NDE     5/30/2021 & 11/9/2021.      NDE 9215/9293.      Exceptional Experience.   There were two angels who were there with me. I was first met by the male angel who was dressed like a lumberjack with black, converse, high-top sneakers. I was laughing over this because, I mean, nobody wears those. I was amazed that he would choose that fashion choice. I still laugh about that. The female angel had on a yellow dress with blue flowers. The dress had short sleeves and a collar that bent down the front and the buttons were pearls. She had a 1950s hairstyle and little, light colored shoes. The female angel held a clothesline between us. I couldn't see or hear the third angel because I had no telepathic connection with it. The female angel was giving me a lot of information and the other angels were worried it was going to interfere with my free will, so she was stopped. 
  NDE at age 17 due to passing out from septicemia.  She is a nurse.  Shared 40 years later.   

    4925.    Rebekah M NDE     5/27/2021.      NDE 9213.            The clouds opened up and I saw the most beautiful valley of green. I felt such Happiness.

  NDE due to apparent seizure with unconsciousness.   

      4924.    Candy A NDE     5/27/2021.      NDE 9212.            Though the lights went out; yet, my consciousness was highly alert. I could no longer hear anyone or anything from in the classroom but I knew that I could hear. I saw nothing but darkness but did not feel blind. I knew that I could see the darkness. It was velvety, soft and comforting. I was also aware that I was no longer a body with structural form. Instead, I felt like something like a puddle of liquid that had been poured out and was now millimeters thin. But, my awareness was from a single point of observation as though I was seeing and hearing in an all-encompassing way.

Why would I smell a campfire? It seemed as if my senses were on fire. The next thing I knew I was walking towards a friend's house but did not know who the friend was. It was twilight during the fall, even though I knew it was summer in July. The air was crisp and I can still smell the campfire. In my hand was a warm cup of coffee. I sit the coffee as I walked up to the open fire pit behind the house. The backyard was also lined by a forest. There were two lounge chairs waiting for me and my friend to sit down. I could tell there was a presence there, but did not turn my head as I continued to sit on my coffee.  
  Probable NDE from physician while on ventilator due to COVID-19.   

      4922.    Samuel E NDE     5/26/2021.      NDE 9208.       From the United Kingdom.     I noticed that I felt as if thinking in there was completely unencumbered, effortless or perfectly smooth (in a sense of being frictionless). I started trying to 'feel' around using my thoughts, and trying to see that, even if I could not feel my physical body at all and had no feedback resembling physical perception of any kind, I might still be able to send commands to my body if I tried

    4921.    Jason W NDE     5/22/2021.      NDE 9206.            I was thrust into a black void that felt really good. I had no body, no sense of touch, nor smell or taste.

      4919.    Jamie B NDE     5/20/2021.      NDE 9204.            The next thing I felt was that I was home. I didn't have eyesight, but I could see perfectly. It was like seeing with your mind. I felt perfect and I knew that I was where I was supposed to be. I understood everything, but I didn't remember anything about my life on earth. I remember just enjoying the feeling. 
  NDE due to injury and apparent cardiac arrest.

    4917.    Gerald T NDE     5/10/2021.      NDE 9202.            I was inside of a golden bubble looking at a child in the water. He was floating face down. At the time, I didn't know who it was. To me, it was just a lifeless body floating in the water.

I was enveloped in love and surrounded by everyone who loved me. It was only after I awoke that I later thought about my family's faces. There were no faces but they weren't faceless. It's just a different way of seeing in a different place. I was on a boat surrounded by turquoise waters. There were tropical islands too.   
  Probable NDE associated with suicide attempt.   

    4914.    Jeff H NDE     4/30/2021.      NDE 9197.            I remember having the distinct thought, 'Man... I wanted to do more this time.' I was about to go off to college and become an engineer. I had this sense that I was meant to do that and help people somehow. Although I had never really thought about having multiple lives. Yet, this thought strangely felt completely normal and familiar to me, like I had been in this situation before. The disappointment I felt at my life ending was surprisingly not that severe though.

    4913.    Joe B NDE     4/28/2021.      NDE 9196.            The first thing I remember was that I was standing next to a wall of some kind. I assume now that I was in an ambulance, but I was up high and looking down at a paramedic working on someone on a stretcher. I did not feel anything but I became aware of a giant roaring in my head. The roaring was so loud that I will probably never forget it. I have no idea how long I watched, but it seemed like several minutes.

I saw a green hill with grass and flowers, with the blue sky beyond. Then I saw Kiowa galloping up over the crest of the hill. Her mane was flying and she looked joyful!   
  Shared death experience at the time of a necessarey euthenasia of a beloved horse.   

      4911.    Niels W NDE     4/22/2021.      NDE 9193.       Exceptional Experience.     I was given a life review while inside the void. During this review, I told the being to pause. I wanted to better examine the parts of my life. I was then able to view these events from overhead. The life review did not last long because I asked the being something that surprised it. 'Can I plan my next reincarnation?' I asked. The being said, 'Usually people wait until their actual death to choose their reincarnation.'
  NDE due to complications during eye surgery at age 3-4.  Remarkable discussion about his own reincarnation during NDE.   

    4910.    Klaus K NDE     4/20/2021.      NDE 9189.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     I remember seeing the light blue, VW-beetle car. But, then I found myself immediately above the road. Below, I saw a VW-beetle car and a desperate young man bending under the engine cover.

Then I watched as the young man was pulling my body out from under the car.  
  NDE at age 10 while riding a bike and being hit by a car.   

    4909.    Liam A NDE     4/14/2021.      NDE 9186.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     It wasn't cold or warm. I had no feelings of temperature. I was without a body and wide awake. I had an absolute awareness of myself, which has nothing in common with my earthly perception. I never had been so aware of my existence. Questions arose, of where I was, and how I happened to come here. I understood that I could answer all the questions in the world. I had a universal knowledge and awareness. My mind had never been as crystal clear. There are no words on earth to explain having this absolute knowledge. 
  NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    4908.    Kevin S Probable NDE     4/14/2021.      Probable NDE 9185.            All of a sudden, I was looking out the windshield that was behind me. 'That is impossible,' I thought to myself.

    4907.    Miguel A STE     4/12/2021.      STE 23467.       Exceptional Experience. From Spain.     I thought to myself, 'I am who I am.' Why is that such a special revelation? Because the heart came from the Hara (the lower abdomen) instead of my head. It occurred as a physical sign, as if someone was writing it from within. It was as if lightning had carved the answer out of rock, or branded it with fire. That phrase clearly came from somewhere else; from another dimension, so to speak.  Then there was something like an explosion in my Hara.  
  Remarkable discussion of brain vs. universal mind from having an STE while driving.   

  4906.    Kimberly T NDE     4/8/2021.      NDE 9179.              I was suddenly in a hallway. It was as if the walls, ceiling, and floor were made of light. It was as of love was a tangible thing and I literally breathed it in and out. It was the most amazing feeling ever. I suddenly knew where my granny G was, so I started hurrying down the hallway, I was eager to go see her.

There are no words that can really express what I was feeling. I felt like I was in a fog as I watched a light that continued to get brighter as the feelings grew stronger and stronger.

I had no fear. I had no needs or sadness. All the pain had stopped. I don't think it is possible to experience such a thing in life on earth. I felt completely accepted and embraced. I do not know by what, but it was like something was telling me that 'it was all fine.' I felt almost fine; though, in a way, I felt bitter that there were still many things I hadn't done yet.

The lights were swirling around, happily living their lives. I felt that this space was infused with infinitely deep, profound love.

We are both. We are pure loving awareness. Anything else is a distortion. I was the Void. Imagine floating alone in pitch black empty space, for all eternity, no stars, no body, just pure consciousness, never ceasing to exist in the infinitely vast eternal solitude that you are. The mind of God is without being, and yet without it, nothing would be.  The mind of God is pure consciousness longing for all eternity.

At this thought, my consciousness began to expand until it encompassed the entire universe. I was filled with the most amazing, unconditional love, and I knew that this love was God. It was a feeling and a love that is unlike anything you experience in life and I am unable to describe it in any way that does it justice. It was pure bliss. I was all at once, everywhere and a part of everything in existence. I was filled with all the knowledge that existed and knew everything there was to know. I was so loved! I realized that we are all connected to everything, even to trees and rocks and animals.

It was, without a doubt, the most wonderful feeling I've ever felt in my life. The feeling is so much more as it is really indescribable with words. It was pure, unconditional love multiplied by 1000 or even more. It was incredible and had me completely in rapture. I could have stayed with that light forever.

But, I still existed? I had no eyes to see but I looked at everything around me. I was in the center of a vast nothingness, but the nothingness was not empty. It was completely filled with the presence of the living God. There are no words in the English language to describe where I was. I was in the middle of the Glory.

I didn't understand how I could have missed this beautiful garden in background as I looked through a big glass window . The ground was covered with green grass. But the color of green is hard to explain because I had never seen it before. I couldn't see the sun, but it was a beautiful day over there.

I knew where I was going because I had been there before during a meditation experience a few years back. I could feel a gentle energy taking me upward to the afterlife.
