  		              		Experience Description   

    It was January, 19, 1976 and I was seven months pregnant with my second child. I went to shower and  started having really strong contractions. I felt faint. There was nobody home except for one of my father's farm workers who was out front. The last thing I remembered before fainting and hitting the back of my head on the toilet was me screaming in spanish for the worker to come help me.

   The next thing I remembered was flying through a dark tunnel at a speed that felt faster than the speed of light.  I could aee a golden light far in the distance.  Then the light got progressively closer and bigger until I was at the point of collision with it. And bang! It was like the sparks from a fire cracker.  I crashed into what felt like a swimming pool filled with love instead of water. 

  only  Suddenly I was teleported to this gigantic hall that seem like Grand Central station in Manhattan but 100 times bigger.  This place was filled with billions of people in white robes; people of all races, ethnicities, gender, and ages.  There was an feeling of love that reverberated through everyone.  There was also a song that played endlessly.  The song was too perfect to describe. 

As I was floating and enjoying the sense of love that permeates through the beautiful, gigantic hall or auditorium, a hand grabbed my hand.  I couldn't see who it was, but it flew up with me amd we left this place behind.  We were flying through the clouds.  Then I saw the surface of the earth and a map-sized images of my island.  We came closer and closer to earth until I could see the central hospital in my town.

  I woke up suddenly in the intensive care unit surrounded by my family and doctors.  Two months later, I gave birth to my daughter.  In retrospect, I had a significant injury to the back of my skull and I was unconscious for 25 minutes. Yet, in my experience, it seem like 5 million years because time was endless.
