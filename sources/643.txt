 Journal not connected directly to any esoteric groups, although promoting themes related  to Theosophy, Agni Yoga teachings, Slavic identity, Esotericism, Mysticism, and similar topics. Editor – Jerzy Znamierowski (1895–1992) – was Theosophist and Anthroposophist.  
 A periodical publication devoted to the transformation of collective life and the education of mankind. 
  From the Editorial: 
 "We are concerned with the human – the whole human and humankind, both in its own cohabitation on the planet, and in its cognitive and religious–philosophical relation to all-being. (…) We desire, as humans – as particular individuals – to propagate the idea of a deeper knowledge of the world, and through that – of intelligent action towards a change for the better – in the way of order and harmony – of the life on Earth. It seems to us that in the endeavor Poland can and should play a not minor role; and this indeed, in a few words, is the CAUSE that we want to serve."

 Karolina Maria Hess:  This was an independent occult journal, unconnected with any esoteric groups, although the editor Znamierowski (1895-1992) was a Theosophist and Anthroposophist.  It described its goals as the transformation of collective life and the education of mankind.  “We are concerned with the human – the whole human and humankind, both in its own cohabitation on the planet, and in its cognitive and ‘religious–philosophical’ relation to all-being. . . .  We desire, as humans – as particular individuals – to propagate the idea of a deeper knowledge of the world, and through that – of intelligent action towards a change for the better – in the way of order and harmony – of the life on Earth. It seems to us that in the endeavor Poland can and should play a not minor role; and this indeed, in a few words, is the CAUSE that we want to serve.”  The journal’s themes related Theosophy, Agni Yoga teachings, Slavic identity, esotericism, Mysticism, and similar topics.
