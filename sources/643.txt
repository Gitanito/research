    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Revue de Psychopotence. Publication Mensuelle Independante et Documentaire de Mentalite et de Psychisme Experimental . Other titles: Revue de Psychologie Applique et de Psychopotence 1907â€”1908  Monthly Paris,France.  Language:  French.  Editor: Leon Demonchy, M.D.. 1/1, November 1907-1/8, June 1908.  With the third issue, January 1908, the journal became Revue de Psychologie Applique et de Psychopotence, reflecting its adoption as organ of the Societe de Psychologie Applique.  10 pp., 6 francs.  "Psychopotence," as defined, described the crowd of poorly understood states that included Od, "neuric force," astral force, etc.  An individual could more or less psychopotent as measured by the phenomena he could produce.  The journal, which seems to have been written entirely by Dr. Demonchy, included examples of Psychopotence, including telepathy, skin-writing ("dermographisme"), and the production of stigmata.  Neither the neologism nor the journal seems to have caught on with the public.
