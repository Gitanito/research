PREFACE
BY THE
TRANSLATOR.
BESIDES the more general provisions made by the Father of
Lights for the instruction of his church and people in divine things,
under the public dispensations of the Law and the Gospel, He has
also been graciously pleased, at sundry times and in divers manners,
as occasions and the needs of the church might require
it,
to make
extraordinary discoveries and revelations to particular persons,
cither for more private or public use, and to answer various ends of
his wisdom and goodness
:
and, indeed, were
it
so that all things
proceeded according to one invariable rule of government in his
administrations, in grace, in providence, ai.d also in the natural
world, without his interposing any particular acts of his divine au
thority and power, God's government of the world would be less at
tended to and believed in, his cognizance of human affairs be ques
tioned by many, and such
a
settled sameness in the course of things
be construed into
a
blind fatality. Nor
is
it
easily to be conceived
by us, how one unchangeable mode of proceeding's could be adapt
ed to the present condition of mankind, as free agents, under their
continual fluctuations and deviations from the rule of obediencc>
their backslidings, rebellions, andapostacy; and accordingly we
read how the Lord varied his particular dealings with the Israelites,
according to their states and circumstances respectively, for direc
tion, for warning, for corrections, &c. by visions, by voices, by signs
and wonders, and by the mission of angels, to reclaim and convert
them
:
and this
is
so far from arguing any variableness in God, that
it
evidences his unchangeableness in mercy and goodness, by acr
comodating his dealings and dispensations to the needs and require
ments of his poor frail creatures.
How things went with the Antediluvians in regard todivine man
ifestations, the sacred records give us but little intelligence
;
but
thus much we may collect from them, that in the line of Scth, as
contradistinguished from that of Cain, there was
a
church of devout
'worshippers then on earth, in which Enoch was highly favoured of
God, and a man of renown, whose prophetic writings continued in
the church down to the times of the apostles, as appears from the
Epistle of Jude. In this line of Seth (from what
is
mentioned of
Enoch and Noah) we may conclude, that the church of God, before

4 Preface,
the general apostacy brought on the flood, was instructed and can*
ducted by particular revelation from Heaven ; and that an intercourse
between angels and the holy men of those early days (called the Sons
of God) was no unfrequent thing.
On the call of Abraham, Heaven was again opened to man in the
way of divine communications externally, and he was taught of God
the things that be of God, by the ministry of Angels ; so that what
we may now call extraordinary dispensations, were then the ordina
ry way of conveying Divine Knowledge :
(*) and from these mora
immediate discoveries of himself to the patriarchs we apprehend
it was, that God stiled himself the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Nor was the delivery of the law, as a stated directory to the Israe
lites for duty and worship, intended to supercede particular
revelations from Heaven, or communications with angels ; nay, the
promise of an angel to " go before them in the way," was immediate
ly annexed to
it,
Exod. iii. 20. and the prophetic dispensation un
der the law appears as
a
supplement of superior excellency to the
law itself, by expounding and illustrating the typical parts of it, in
reference to that ministration of righteousness by Jesus Christ,
which should far exceed
it
in
glory. Thus the law and the prophets
made together, as
it
were, but one dispensation, and all serious Jews
looked upon divine manifestations,
by
prophecy and vision, as such
standing tokens of God's favour towards them, that any occasional
cessation of them was considered as
a
mark of the divine displea
sure
;
thus the Psalmist, " We see not our tokens, there
is
not one
" prophet more," Psalm lxxiv. 10. and hence
it
was that the Seers,
or true Visionaries, were held in such honour by the godly of that
church. Thus, " The word of the Lord was precious in those days
;
., there was no open vision,"
1
Sam. iii. 4. "Her prophets find no vision
„ from the Lord," Isai. iii.
1.
And
it
is
observable, that from the
time of Malachi to a little before the advent of Christ, during which
period prophecy and vision ceased in the Jewish church, (at least
in persons of a public character) was the most horrid degeneracy
of that people from all things sacred and moral
;
intestine divisions,
bribery, and libertinism diffused their poison through church and
state
;
the very temple was often polluted with the blood of hostile
factions
;
and the high priesthood bought and sold, nay, the nomina
tion to
it
submitted to heathen princes, who conferred the same on
the highest bidder
:
thus fulfilling the truth of Solomon's words,
Prov xxix. 18. " Where there
is
no vision the people perish
;"
meaning thereby,thatwhcre there
is
a
cessation of all divine commu
nications, the sense of religion decays, and all things tend to ruin.
When the time was fully come, as foretold by the prophets, for
the Son of Righteousness to arise with healing in his wings

God to manifest himself in the flesh to destroy the works of

the devil, and to supply what was lacking in all preceeding dispen
sations : then the heavens were again opened, and celestial com
munications renewed with men ; an angel foretold the birth of him,
who should be the harbinger to the Prince of Peace ; the same hea
venly messenger was sent to the highly favoured Virgin with a sal
utation on her miraculous conception of him; and a host of angels
proclaimed the joyful news of his gracious advent ; angels minis
tered unto him during his abode on earth) and announced his resur
rection from the dead. But when all was finished relating to our
adorable Redeemer's ministry, sufferings, and life in the flesh, and
that the dispensation of the Holy Ghost took place according to this
promise, were all extraordinary dispensations then to cease ? By no
means; for this very public solemnity on the day of Pentecost was at ->
tended with a gracious promise,of their continuance in the church to
future generations, as declared to all present by Peter, who, on quo
ting the prophecy of Joel, Joel iii. 28, 29, concerning the same
vouchsafements, applies them to the times of the Gospel dispensa
tion : " For the promise is to you and to your children, and to them
" that are afar off," Acts ii. 39. And they certainly continued with
the apostles, as more particularly appears from the visions of angels
to Peter, Paul, Philip, and John the Divine, plainly evincing, tha:
they were not superseded by the giving of the Holy Ghost.
Such as are no friends to the belief of cxtraordina>-y gifts and com
munications, have laboured all they could to confine them to tin;
times of the apostles : but in so contradicting the current testimo
ny of the church history, they shew much prejudice, and little
modesty. The apostolical fathers, Barnabas, Clement, and Hennas,
(whose writings were reverenced as of canonical authority for four
hundred years, and were read, together with other Canonical Scrip
tures, in many of the Churches) confirm the truth of prophecy, di
vine visions, and miraculous gifts continuing in the church after the
apostolical age, both by their testimony and experience ; and to pass
over many venerable names, (among whom Tertullian and Origenarc
witnesses to the same truth afterwards) Eusebius, Cyprian, and
I.aciantius, still lower down, declare that extraordinary divine man
ifestations were not uncommon in their days : Cyprian is very ex
press on this subject, praising God on that behalf, with respect to
himself, to divers of the clergy, and many of the people, usine'these
words. " The discipline of God over us never ceases by night and
"by day to correct and reprove ; for not only by visions of llir.
" night, but also by day, even the innocent age of children among us
" is filled with the Holy Spirit, and they see, and hear, and speak in
" extacy such things as the Lord vouchsafes to admonish and in-
•*
struct us by." Epist. 16. and it was the settled belief of the early
fathers of the church, that these divine communications, for direc
tion, edification, .and comfort, would never wholly cease therein,
That extraordinary gifts became more rare in the Church about
the middle of the third century, is allowed by Cyprian himself, and

time testified to the reality of them ; and they account for h from
the encouragement given to the pernicious doctrines of Epicurua,
and other materialists at that time, which disposed many to turn
every thing supernatural and spiritual into mockery and contempt.
In the next century, when the profession of Christianity became es
tablished by Constantine as the religion of the empire, and millions
adopted it from its being the religion of the court, the fashion of the
times, or the road to temporal emoluments, then Christianity appeal
ed indeed more gorgeous in her apparel, but became less glorious
.within ; was more splendid in form, but less vigorous in power ; and
so what the Church'gained in superficies, she lost in depth. She suf
fered her.faith to be corrupted by the impure mix tures ofthe Heathen •
ish philosophy, whilst the honours, riches, and pleasures ofthe world
insinuated themselves into her affections,stole away her graces, and
so robbed her of her best treasure, insomuch, that many have made
it a doubt, whether in the times here spoken of, Paganism was more
christianized, or Christianity more paganized.
In this condition ofthings, no wonder that we hear so little of di
vine visions and extraordinary spiritual gifts in those days : for how
ever outward men are apt to glory in the pompous appearance of a
visible church, yet the true spiritual Church may be considered at
that time, and indeed ever since, as in her wilderness state, with
drawn from the multitude to keep herself unspotted from the world,
and to preserve an holy intercourse with her Beloved, in a life and
conversation becoming the Gospel of Christ; nor were her heaven
ly vouchsafements less than before, but only less proper to be divul
ged, as less likely to be received,or to be received only with derision,
as were the dreams of Joseph by his brethren. We always mean
to except under this distinction many excellent persons mixed with
carnal professors in common life, yet walking in all good conscience
fearing God, and working righteousness. Nor is any thing here
said with a design to suggest, as though the establishment of Chris
tianity in the Roman empire were without it's great beneficial ef
fects ; for it was a mean appointed by Providence for spreading
the knowledge of the Truth over a great part of the known world,
whereby great numbers, under very defective and corrupt adminis
trations of
it,
were converted from the error of their ways, and by
passing through the outward forms and ordinances to the inward
fiower, became burning and shining lights in the Church
:
besides,
Divine Truth
is
of
a
diffusive nature, like the precious ointment
upon the head of Aaron, that fell dowivto the skirts of his garments.
Thus the Christian religion, in the weakest administrations of
it,
was not without good influence on the nations that received
it,
by
civilizing their manners, improving their systems of morality,
repressing their enormous vices, and regulating their polity by more
wholesome laws and institutes.
To trace the Christian religion in the various revolutions of it's
progress, from it's first civil establishment down to the present
times, would be the province of an historian
;

it,

Preface. ~
pcfore us in the way both of scriptural and rational inquiries in rela
tion to ourselves. And here it must be owned, that the belief of all
extraordinary or supernatural dispensations is at a very low ebb
with us, and that from several assignable causes, two or three of
which shall here be noticed.
And first, from an undue exaltation of man's natural rational facul-
tie&and powers, as the sufficient test of revealed Truths ; and this
gross error has prevailed more among men of human learning for
this past century, than perhaps ever before ; to which it is owing,
that almost every thing in religion has been run into question and
controversy, and that a general disbelief of all things supernatural
has in a great measure banished Faith, and introduced Sadducism
among us, to the denying of all spiritual visions and apparitions of
angels as things incredible.
Secondly, This doubting and unbelief in things of a spiritual na
ture has spread to a greater extent among all classes, from an exten
sive attachment to worldly interest, and the love of money in the
trading nations of Christendom, through the vast increase of com
merce and navigation in the two last centuries ; whereby the affec
tions and pursuits of such great numbers have been so engaged on
the side of filthy lucre, as to turn an employment, in itself innocent
and useful, into the occasion of sin. Hence a sordid avarice, and
making haste to be rich by frauds, extortion, and injustice^ which
lays an invincible obstacle in the way of faith ; since we are told,
that every one that would name the name of Christ, as his Saviour,
must first depart from iniquity.
Another great hindrance to the belief of all communications with
the World of Spirits, is a life of pleasure, which the Apostle
calls a State of Death, 1 Tim. v. G. as it chains down the mind to the
object of the senses, and things of outward observation, and totally
indisposes it for the consideration of things inward and spiritual : and,
this is not only the case of the voluptuous and libertine part of man
kind, but -of those also, who, from an indulged levity and dissipation
of mind, abandon themselves to vain pastimes and amusements, are
carried away with every wind of fashion and folly, or, like the Athe
nians, spend their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear
some new thing. Should an Apostle reveal any thing concerning
Heaven or Hell to persons thus indisposed to receive hi9 report, is
it not to be expected that they would reply in derision, like the philr
osophers-or Atheniansbeforementioned,atthePreachingof St Paul,
" What will this babler say ?" Nor can it be expected that the coo-
tents of the following volume should meet with a more favourable
reception from such. All things relating to the other world, and
the condition of departed souls, are of a most interesting nature, and
call for great seriousness and awful attention; and they that bring
not with them minds so prepared for the consideration of these sub
jects, however they may boast of their reason, they are not as yet
qualified for judges in these matters. And fhi.s leads to an obser
vation or two on the subject of reason.

8 Preface.
There is nothing more talked of and pretended to than reason,
and yet nothing in which people ofevery rank and age are less agreed
in ; that which generally passes for reason being of a vague, uncer
tain nature, varying according to the tempers, inclinations, and cir
cumstances of men. Thus it happens, that the reason of one of thir
ty years of age is seldom the reason of the same person at fifty ; the
reason of the majority, is not the reason of the minority; nay
in every profession, art, and science, men reason differently; and
often oppositely, except where reason has least place, as in mathe
matics, geometry, and arithmetic. And yet there is a right reason
in all things, where men arc qualified to find it out ; but these arc
few, and we see by far the greater part perpetually wrangling, dis
puting, and cbntradicting one another in relation to right and wrong
in most things ; and the main cause of it is the want of simplicity,
and a right disposition of the will and affections, which are absolute
ly necessary, in order to a right judgment : but whilst men digni
fy their passions, humours, and false interests with the venerable
name of reason, it remains in them no other than the operations of
their present state of mind on the errors, prejudices, and wrong
principles they have before imbibed, and which they are resolved to
naintain with the most words, and such arguments as they are mas-
. tors of; and hence it is, that we have so many critics, politicians,
and divines, which are utter strangers to the truth of the matters
they take in hand.
*
But reason has also its specific difference* and measures, accor
ding to the nature of the subject tobe investigated; thus ethics, phy
sics, and metaphysics have each their respective principles, and
consequently a distinct kind of reason; and he that is a good proficient
in the knowledge of one, may be very deficient in another. Thus
every part of knowledge has its standard, adequate and proper to it
self; so natural things are known by natural reason, and spiritual
things are discerned by a spiritual light ; and this distinction is found
ed on the authority of scripture, in which we are told, that "the na-
♦'
turai man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they arc
" foolishness unto him ; neither can he know them, because they
" arc spiritually discerned," I Cor. ii. 1 4 ; that is, the animator soul -
isli man, with all his natural faculties and endowments, cannot of
himself attain to the knowledge of spiritual things, they being too
far above his reach, and therelore it must be given him from above,
or he cannot have it : nay, so contrary are they to the propensities
iind apprehensions of his sensual fallen nature, that whilst he pre
sumes on a fancied sufficiency in himself to comprehend these
things, the deeper he plunges himself into the darkness of human
ignorance concerning them, and the more accounts them foolish
ness ; and thus God is said to make foolish the wisdom of this>
world, by leaving such to their wilful blindness, who chuse darkness
rather than light-
Nothing is here said to depreciate the external rational know
ledge, even in its lowest sphere, when joined with the fear of God
in men of humble minds : for this also is the gift of God, and is not

wily helpful to us in all the purposes of this life, but in due place ami
subordination subservient to the divine life : it is the abuse of this
knowledge only that falls under our censure, as when natural know
ledge and human learning are employed to unsettle men's minds
with respect to the things of the other world, and to rob them
of the precious hopes of a glorious immortality through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus. All such kind of sophistry,
mistaken for reason, is no better than vain deceit, and science false
ly so called, and all that exercise themselves therein are disturbers
of the peace of mankind, as well as enemies to the church of (Jod.
Nor can we here forbear to pass a reproof on all those, who, whilst
they profess a reverence for the Gospel Revelation, patronize at the
same time the infidelity of the Sadducecs, as touching angels and
spirits, and all extraordinary dispensations : for to deny all com
munications with the spiritual world, whether by vision, or any other
means naturally leads to Atheism ; and their pernicious reasonings
in this way have had dreadful effects upon the present times, by
weakening the sense of religion and conscience in the lower classes
of the people. The belief of an intercourse with the other world, ac-
cordingtothe truth of
it,
keeps aliveand cherishes faith in the im
mortality of the soul in all ranks ofpeople, and familiarizes the mind
to its existence separate from the body
:
and
it
is
not to be doubted,
tha-. such gracious vouchsafements were granted to the Jews under
the Law, and have been continued since to the church under the
Gospel, in aid and assistance to men's faith in the written traditions
of both dispensations
;
such being the goodness of the Lord in com
passion to the weakness of our nature, and the dulnesa of our minds,
which stand so much in need of fresh, awakening incitements to call
off our attention from earthly to heavenly things. And therefore
we cannot but lament, that any men of name in the church, though
little deserving of
it
on this account, have gone so far bcyound this
line, as to assert, that all extraordinary gifts and supernaturaldispcn-
sations have totally ceased since the third century
;
but we have
no authority for this but their own, and therefore do upon much bet
ter grounds assert, that extraordinary gifts and vouchsafements
never did nor will cease in the church, till that which
is
perfect shall
come, that is, till such extraordinary become ordinary dispensations,
and angels shall converse with men as familiarly as they -did with
Adam before the fajl: and in the mean time we confidently rely upon,
the divine promise, that the same Lord, who" gave some apostles,
« and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and
a teachers, for the perfecting of the saints for work of the ministry
"for the edifying of the body of Christ," will fulfill the same pro
mise," till' we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the know-
" ledge of the Son of God, unto
a
perfect man, unto the measure of
"the stature of the fulness of Christ," Eph. iv. 11, 12, 13.
But
it
may be said here, that se-ers of visions are not mentioned
along with prophets, &c. in the foregoing quotation from the apos
tle
;
and therefore as the first are principally referred to in this Pre

Scripture is not confined to the gift of prediction or foretelling things
to come, but signifies one to whom any divine'manifestation was made
for the use of others ; and as this was generally by vision, so we read
that prophets in a>icient times were usually called Seers, that is,
sc-ers of visions, thus in 1 Sam. ix. 9. " Before time in Israel, when
" a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to
" the Seer, for he that is now called a prophet was before time called
" a Seer." And afterwards in the same chapter, Samuel calls himself
a Seer. And in 2 Sam. xxiv. 11. we read, "that the word of the
"Lord came unto the prophet Gad, David's Seer." Of such honour
able repute was the name seer in those times. When therefore the
apostle gives it in charge to the church, not to despise prophesyings,
we have no warrant to exclude visions from the general charge, espe
cially as we are well informed from ecclesiastical history, that the cus
tom of communicating to the church the visions ot holy persons,par-
ticularly such as were of authority in the ministry, continued down
at least to the days of Cyprian, the good bishop of Carthage, who
speaks of manifestations by vision throughout his Epistles, and also
of his own; for he had many visions, and among others one concern
ing his own martyrdom, and the particular manner of
it,
which hap
pened accordingly.
St. Paul (Hteb. xii 22.) speaking of the superior, excellence and
blessedness of the New Covenant, says, " But ye are come to mount
" Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
*• and to an innumerable company of angels," &c. By which words we
cannot suppose him to mean less, than that by Christ, the mediator
of this better covenant, a more free intercourse with Heaven, and
a
more intimate fellowship with saints and angels,
is
now opened for us,
if
we debar not ourselves of this blessed privilege. What then hin
ders our conversing with angels now, as the patriarchs and prophets
did of old? What but our own fault and unfitness for such glorious com
pany? Why do we not now see them descending and ascending between
Heaven and Earth, as Jacob did on the typical ladder? Why, but for
our own unbelief,oursottishness,ourearthly-mindedness; from which
deep sleep, as to the things of God,
if
we were truly awakened, we
should see cause to own in the words of the same patriarch, when he
awakened from the vision of the night
;
" Surely the Lord
is
in this
" place, and
I
knew
it
not," Gen. xxviii. 16. Heaven
is
as near to the
heavenly soul, as the soul
is
to the body
;
for we are not separated
from
it
by
distance of place, but only by condition of state: thus when
Elisha was surrounded in Dothan by Syrians, his servant saw not the
chariots and horsemen (the angelical host) that surrounded his mas
ter for defence, as Elisha did, till the Lord opened his eyes. Just so
it
is
with us
;
unbelief and sin keep us from seeing the things that are
about us and near to us, and also from giving credit to the reports of
those who are in the experience of them.
The same Apostle, who cautions against despising prophesyings,
docs also gives us to understand, that angels were not to discontinue
their visits to men in future times of the church, as where exhorting

us not to a be forgetful to entertain strangers," lie adds, " for thereby
" some have entertained angels unawares," Heb. xiii. 2. Now there
would be no encouragement nor argumentin the latterpartofthe verse
unless the same might happen to be the case with us also. But
wheretore should we doubt, that those blessed friendly beings should
take delight in exercising their good will to men by many kind of of
fices both visible and invisible, according to the good pleasure of our
common Lord, as by preserving us in many dangers, protecting us
against the assaults of evil men and evil spirits, and by counselling,
warning, and helping us by various ways and means we know not of
We ought not so to doubt of this, as we are apt to do, nor wonder at
it; " For are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for
" them, who shall be the heirs of salvation^" Heb. i. 14. We should
rather wonder that good men, when they walk out to meditate in the
8eld, as Isaac did, Gen. xxiv. 63, should not often meet those celestial
strangers to join them in sweet conversation on heavenly things, and
be accompanied by them in their journies, as Tobias was. But
whether manifested to us or not, sure it is, that we arc more indebted
to them for their kind assistance and ministrations than is generally
believed, as evidently appears to have been the sense of our church,
heretofore at least, as thus expressed in her collect for St. Michael
and all Angels. " O everlasting God, who hasl ordained and consti-
" tuted the service of angels and men in a wonderful order, mercifully
" grant, that as thy holy angels alway do thee service in Heaven, so
"by thy appointment they may succour and defend us on carth,through
" Jesus Christ our Lord "
As to the arguments offered by those, who maintain the total cessa
tion of these and other extraordinary dispensations on the; establish
ment of the Christian religion, or it's protection by the civil powers;
viz. that the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, together with it's set
tled ecclesiastical (Economy, are sufficient for salvation, and the wel
fare of the church,and therefore what is more isncedlcss,and not to be
expected,; for if men now will not believe Moses and the prophets,
Christ and his Apostles, so neither would they be persuaded, though
one should rise from the dead. Be it answered, first, that the opposers
of extraordinary dispensations do here take for granted the very point
in question, viz. that they are ceased, which it is impossible for
them to prove ; nay, we appeal for the reality of them to the authority
ofuniversal ecclesiastical history, as also to the records of every par
ticular church and nation in Christendom, not to insist on the testi
mony given thereto in numberless books, tracts, and narratives, some
ur other of which have fallen in the way of every person of any read
ing and conversation : what credit is to be given to or wkh-held from,
•hem respectively, is another matter of inquiry; but that all should
be invention and forgery, requires higher degree of credulity than is
sufficient for believing the greater part of them : and as to the re
proachful epithets of monkish and legendary, so liberally bestowed
on well attested narratives of this kind, by such as resolve to
believe nothing but what they can sec with their eyes, or touch
their hands, they arc not to be regarded, where the grounds of

12 Preface.
Credibility and evidence are the points in question. Many of the
Roman Catholic writers stand confessedly chargeable with an
over-credulity ; and it is to be wished, that many of the Protestant
writers were less censurable than they are for incredulity ; and the
medium between both these extremes will be found the proper
ground from whence to take the clearest view of these matters. Sure
it is, that we are at this time very dangerously infected with doubt
ing and unbelief, as to things supernatural ; and that the general idea
of refqrmation amongst us means rather a departure from certain
Popish errors and superstitions, than any advances in true faith and
godliness.
Secondly, As to what is allwlged for the sufficiency of the ordina
ry means of grace under a legal establishment of religion for faith
and salvation, may we not ask such bold pronounccrs, by what com
mission they take upon them to determine concerning sufficiency in
this matter, and who gave authority to teach, that the Lord is become
more sparing of his benefits and gifts to his church than in former
times, nay, than He has promised to be toward* it ; or do they sup
pose, that what is called an establishment of religion by the civil
powers, is equivalent to the extraordinary gifts bestowed on the pri
mitive Christians? Whereforcshould they go about to limit the lov
ing kindness of the Lord by their own scanty measure of sufficiency,
since it is his usual way to give not only for mere necessity, but al
so for delectation ; his gracious attribute, is not only to be good, but
abundant in goodness in all his works both of nature and grace, where
men render not themselves unqualified for the same: and He that
givcth one talent, is as ready to bestow ten talents on a due improve
ment of the former ; for so He giveth grace for grace.
Thirdly, The inference they draw against the usefulness of mira
culous gifts, and other extraordinary dispensations, from those words '
of Abraham, in the parable of Dives and Lazarus, " If they hear not
« Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one
" should rise from the dead," is not at all conclusive in this case ; as
that saying appears to respect such only as have hardened them-
selvesan unbelief, by departing from faith in the written Word, un
der the ordinary means of salvation ; and not such as are weak in the
faith, but not obdurate, as was the case with the disciples, who,
though under our Lord's own teachings, yet, through the dulness of
their apprehension, seemed to need some mighty work to make an
impression on their feeble minds; and accordingly, when Jesus was
on the way with jliem to raise Lazarus from the dead, He speaks of
the ensuing miracle as useful from them among others, and takes sa- '
risfaction on their account, that He was not present with Lazarus in
.his sickness to heal him : " I am glad for your sakes, that I was not
* there, to the intent that ye may believe," John xi. 15; that is, by
saeing him raised from the dead. So then we arc to make a wide dis
tinction between an evil heart of unbelief, as where men, through an.
incorrigible attachment to sinful courses, or by taking pains to con
firm themselves in infidelity, are proof against evidence sufficient for
their conviction; and where (hey aTe in unbelief through present in-,

attention, distraction of mind from worldly hindrances, dulncss of ap
prehension, and the like causes, but without any wilful opposition to
the truth. In these last cases extraordinary means have often salu
tary effects, by calling off the mind from it's wandering, by alarming
and converting the sinner from the error pf his ways. History sup
plies us with numberless instances of this kind; and, among others,
I see no cause to doubt what is recorded of Bruno, founder of the
Carthusian order, viz. that he was converted on the following occa
sion. As he attended the corpse of a certain ecclesiastic (who had
been a followed preacher) to his grave, the deceased raised himself
up from the funeral bier, and pronounced himself condemned by the
just sentence of God ; upon which he was interred without the so
lemnity of Christian burial, and the effect upon Bruno in particular
was, that he became impressed with so piercing a sense of his own
danger, that he retired from the world, and devoted himself, during
the remainder of his life, to a religious retirement and vigorous dis
cipline.
From what has been observed on the foregoing subject, wc shall
conclude, that the same Lord, who in times past sent his prophets,
wise men, and seers, and gave extraordinary tokens and warnings t»
awaken a careless world to a sense of its danger, has not wholly-
ceased in these last ages to manifest his power and goodness for the
same end, in various instaoces, to co-operate as assisting means with
the more general and stated provisions of his revealed will, for our
incitement and benefit: and though some, through their unbelief and
obduracy in sin, refuse to profit by any methods of his goodness, whe
ther ordinary or extraordiny ; yet many others maynot be so far de
parted from the faith and fear of God, as to continue unreclaimablc.
by his more paaticular and alarming visitations. Thus we read, that
many were converted on seeing the miracles which Jesus did, whilst
the Scribes, Pharisees, and Rulers endeavoured to stifle their report,
and remained wilful unbelievers to the end ; and we well know
what like opposition we have to expect from men of the same leaven
to every thing that may here be advanced in favour of extraordinary
manifestations: but were their names and number greater than they
are, it would have no weight with us, being no strangers to their little
length and breadth, and their want of depth, and ready to meet them
in the field of argument, as well as prepared to answer every objec
tion they have to offer; wishing them at the same time more modes
ty for their own sakes, than to dictate to the church what is suffici
ent, without scriptural authority. In the general division I am speak
ing of, there is a class of modest well-meai>.ing men, who are no fur
ther concerned in the matter before us, than to justify the ways of
God to man, upon a supposition that all things are left to one settled
scheme of things and means, as not seeing any thing beyond
it,
who
are established in the faith under the use of ordinary means, and have
no nvincible prejudice againstthc extraordinary,but only think them

against all supernatural manifestations, whether they are in the pro
fession of Christianity or not.
And here I must ask all such, To what purpose is your opposition
to the belief of any fresh discoveries of the other world ? Is it not
a subject of the highest importance to us to know, what and where
we shall be to all eternity, after a short passage over this bridge of
time'•. Are there not different degrees of evidence in these matters
;
and supposing that your conviction were at all times so full in rela
tion thereto, as to exclude all shadow of doubting,yet are there not in
finite particulars and circumstances relating to the World of Spirits?
which may serve as an inexhaustible fund of fresh discoveries, many
of which may have been revealed to others, though not to us, and for
us to receive from them? How comes
it
then, you are so void of all
reasonable curiosity, as to prefer ignorance to information in these
things, nay to study objections to the belief of them
•'
Were any pre
judice allowable in this case,
it
should rather be for, than against
them, especially where they have
a
tendency to promote faith, virtue,
and godliness. If any knowledge
is
to be coveted, surely
it
is
that of
%he laws, ways, and accommodations of that good country, which we
hope to go to and live in for ever. Besides, such extraordinary mani
festations are greatly conductive to the good of this world, by laying
before us fresh motives and encouragements in our way through
it,
to strive lawfully for the high prize that is set before us in
a
better,
and by rousing every power and faculty of the mind by fresh news
from Heaven. If we believe the Scriptures, we must allow of such
an intercourse between Heaven and earth in former times; and if
it
be less frequent now,
it
is
owing to the infidelity and apostacy of the
times, for God's goodness endureth the same for ever, and good spirits
are equally desirous of holding communication with men now, as for
merly
;
but then there must be
a
suitableness for
it
on the part of the
latter, something of that innocence and simplicity of life, which in
ancient'times served for the basis of such fellowship.
But neither are instances of extraordinary dispensations so very
few now, as most are apt to imagine
;
for among the many estimable
and excellent men and women in the Christian church now that hold
fast sound doctrine, walking in the fear of God, and in all good con
science, there
is
a
select company of the inner court worshippers, to
whom the Lord revcaleth his secrets, and maketh known the hidden
things of his kingdom. Some of these arc favoured with secret com
munications for their own sakes, or for the benefit only of some few
others. They are generally persons of
a
retired life, little known of
their brethren, and somi- limes like Joseph, persecuted by them
;
an
instance of which kind has been well attested to me by
a
person of
veracity, who knew the party, viz.
a
gentlewoman of fortune
;
who
having declared at different times that she conversed with angels, ho-
relations applied to a late chancellor for
a
statute of lunacy against
her
;
and though she was allowed upon examination to be reasonable
and of sound mind in all other things, yet, upon her confessing this
article of her charge, she was ordered to

fortune committed to the management of her relations. May it not
be ashed, here, if they, who can favour such prosecutions, are not to
be suspected of thinking that the Seers of old were at times beside
themselves ? Can we be at a loss then how to account for our hearing
so seldom of such extraordinary dispensations in these times of unbe
lief, when it is become so dangerous to own them, or at least when
the recital is likely to meet with nothing better than mockery and
derision.
But whatever cautionary reserves may be justifiable, nay, prudent,
where the manifestation \ppears to respect only the party to whom it
is made, or for private use to some few others, according as discis
sion may direct ; yet, where it is evidently given for public benefit
and use, as in the ease of this author ; more especially if by express
command ; here the person is to be considered as standing in the pro
phetic character, and therefore is not to consult with flesh and blood
in this matter, nor to regulate his measures by human prudence ; but
to deliver his message bo'dly, and leave the event to God, lest he
suffer for his disobedience, as Jonah did, and be obliged to deliver it
at last. But it may be asked here, if ii be not reasonable to expect-
that every such message from Heaven should have the attestation of
a miracle to evince the truth of it; to which it might suffice to answer,
in the words of Job, (ch. xxxii. 13.) that " the Lord giveth not an ac-
" count of his matters." This however is certain, that wherever He '
sends a message,He also gives power sufficient with it to convince,or
to condemn the rejection of it. Our Lord, in the days of his flesh,
wrought miracles, sometimes to convince tbe understanding, some
times to take away all excuse from the hardened and impenitent, and
sometimes He refrained from doing them, to prevent the greater
condemnation of unbelievers ; thus He is said not to have done many
mighty works in Galilee, because of their unbelief.
But the foregoing query may be further urged into an objection of
such apparent strength, as may be thought deserving of a more par
ticular answer. Thus it may be asked, If any particular revela
tion for public use and benefit, either in the way of instruction, .
direction, or warning, rests only on the credit and authority of tht
revealer, are we not liable to much deception in the matter,'
and though the messenger may be a true one, yet might not our re
ceiving him as such give encouragement to pretenders and imposteri
to assume the like character in order to deceive, and to come with,
"Thus saith the Lord," in their mouths, when the Lord hath not spo
ken it •' In this case, what rule have we to go by, and how shall wc
tread firm on such slippery ground? To this it is replied, that as in
old times there were false as well as true Prophets and Seers, so no
thing hinders but there may be like counterfeits now o'days ; for in
this mixed world of good and evil, where men stand in their liberty of
speaking and acting, no infallible provision against hypocrisy and hn-
jjosture can take effect, but the enemy will sow his tares, in the same
field where the good husbandman has sowed his wheat, and Satan will
at all times transform himself into an angel of light. Every thing

has its contrary here, where good and evil are set »nc against the
other ; but then help and means are provided for our direction and
safety ; if offences are many, so also are our defences, if errors are.
manifold, there are diversities of gifts to detect and refute them, and
if the father of lies and his emmissaries arc busy to deceive us, the
good spirit of God is ever ready to lead us into all Truth ; so that we
have not only light in the Scriptures, but through supplication and
prayer may also have Light within us from above for the discerning
of spirits, and for our security against all the powers of darkness.
We are not therefore to reject truth and error indiscriminately in
whatever forms they may appear, because the latter may wear a
like garb with the former ; but try the spirits, and hold fast to that
which is good, herein imitating the fishers mentioned in the Gospel,
(representative of the wife in Christ's kingdom) who, "when they
" had filled their net with fish of every kind, gathered the good into
" vessels, and cast the bad away," Matt. xiii. 48. Nay, the most il
literate Christian walking humbly in the fear of God, and working
righteousness according to his best knowledge, never was nor will
be suffered, to fall into any fatal delusion : simplicity and uprightness
of heart place him under the protection of the Almighty, and he is in
the essence of truth, though without the formal ideas of it ; for " all
" the paths of the Lord arc mercy and truth to such as keep his cove-
'* nant and his testimonies," Ps. xxv. 10. Mistake he may, but can
Irot dangerously err, for his errors are innocent, and love sanctifies
all he thinks, says. and does. Thus the pure in heart see God in all
things, and from all things reap benefit without hazard or loss ; whilst .
the perverse and ungodly " change even the truth of God into a he,"
Rom. i. 25, by turning that which was designed for their good into
the occasion of their sin. But to resume the subject : If it were al
lowed to be a justifiable cause for the rejecting every extraordinary
dispensation that comes supportedby credible evidence,becausc some
may safely pretend to the same, the objection would be of equal force
on the side of numbers against listening to their established pastor*
anrf teachers, because some among them arc ignorant, some unsound
bi doctrine, and some handle the word of God deceitfully ; and though
this must be allowed to be a pitiable case where it happens, yet the
salvation of the conscientious worshipper does by no means lie upon
any such hazard, for ordinary and extraordinary means are all one
with the Lord, and rather than any sincerely pious and seeking soul
should perish for lack of knowledge, He would send, if need were,
an angel from Heaven to be its teacher ; but all such have an uner
ring guide, even the good Spirit of God, and " them that are meek
" shall He guide in judgment, and such as are gentle, them shall He
" teach his way," Ps. xxv. 9.
Lastly, It is to be observed under this article, that all who pro-
fe«sedly oppose every kind of communication with the World of
Spirits, do not only deny the authority of the sacred records, but also
set aside that evidence which is given to the truth of this matter, by
the concurrent testimony of every age and nation; so that matter oi'

Fact is against them, and proves all their pretensions to reason and
philosophy to be vain, whilst they go about to invalidate all authority,
except that of their own senses, and I may add, even to render that
doubtful likewise; nay, I have heard one of this sceptical class de
clare, that he would not believe the testimony of his own senses in
such a case. It is well known that the Heathens believed themselves
to be under the care, of their gods through the ministry of genii or
tutelary spirits, and held the existence both of good demons, fend of
evil, or caco-demons ; for dark as their dispensation was, they had
shadows of truth among them sufficient to keep alive their belief of
the soul's immortality, and they have transmitted down to us in
their histories many instances of supernatural visions and apparitions,
and of warnings by dreams; so that many of our modern unbelievers
have less of faith in things of the other world than the very Gentiles,
several of whom have declared themselves indebted to good and vi
sible agents for the wisdom of their laws, for many valuable disco
veries in physic, for warnings, predictions, and extraordinary deli
verances. Tojjive only one saying of Cicero, among many, to the
same purpose : " I know not," says he, " any one nation, polite, or
11
barbarous, which does not hold, that some persons have lie gift of
w
foretelling future events." (*)
But I chiefly confine myself here to celestial visions, answerable
to the following work, and which are by no means to be considered on
the level with apparitions, whether of ghosts departed, or of spirits of
any other order, these last being of a far inferior kind to the first ; and
yet it/will not be goingfar out of my way to speak a few words of the
latter. Thereis a climax in Ged's works of nature, or ascale ascen
ding form the lowest to the highest of them, till they terminate in the
great adorable Original, who is the Alpha and Omega of the universe.
From these gradations, discovered or discoverable in the natural
world, we may from analogy (which is our best rule to go by) con
clude, that the like progression takes place in the spiritual worlds,
and that their is not that wide chasm between one and'the other that
is generally supposed, but that the most refined part of the material
meets the grossest part of the immaterial system of beings, visible
thus ending where invisible begins; and consequently, that there are
spirits very near us, though not discernible by us, except when ac
cording to certain unknown laws of their existence, or the particular
will of the Lord, they become manifested to us, either visibly or au
dibly ; and highly credible his, that all nature is peopled with them
in it's several regions of the air and earth, and it's subterraneous
dwellings, according to their different classes, subordinations, and
allotments. Milton finely expresses himself on this subject as
follows:
*• —-' —Think not, though men were none,
•' That Heaven would want spectators, tiod want praise :
'* Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
'* Unseen, both when wc wake, and when ue. sleep," &t
* Gicero do Bivinntionc. Lib. 1. /

Preface.
Now to argue against their existence from their being inconspi
cuous, is an absurd conclusion for men who pretend to philosophy, is.
especially when all know what a new world of animalcula, invisible
beiore, has been discovered to «is by the improyed microscope : and if
the reality of such material objects, although invisible to the naked
eye, is nevertheless not to be doubted, even by those who have never
seen them ; how much less should the existence of spiritual beings be
denied, merely because they come not under the preception of our na
tural senses >. Certain it is, however, that spirits can become visible,
and converse with us, as man with man ; and so innumerable are the
instances hereof, as also of their discoveries, warnings, predictions,
Sec. that I may venture to affirm with an appeal to the public for the
truth of
it,
that there are few ancient families in any county of Great
Britain, that are not possessed of records or traditions of the same in
their own houses, however the prevailing Sadducism of these times
may have sunk the credit of them, as well as in
a
great measure cut
off communications of this kind.
These spirits arc of both sorts, like men on earth, good and bad
;
as
f
o
the latter, they are agents of Satan, to promote the interests of
his kingdom, and, like their chief, " go to and fro in the earth, walking
up and down jn it." Job.
i.

seeking whom they may deceive and
destroy. These are enemies to good men, and the willing associates
of men of evil dispositions, over whom they have great power through
the consent of their will, but none otherwise, practising upon their
minds and understanding " with all deceivablencss of unrighteousness
" in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth,
" that they might be saved,"
2
Thess. ii. 10. This power of enticing,
prompting, and instigating such as become their willing captives to
all kinds of evil
;
and the henious sin of the latter, in freely surrender
ing themselves into their hands to be practised upon, stands confes
sed even in the form of proceeding in our courts of judicature in the
case of attrocious delinquents,
it
being part in the charge of indict
ment, that they did such things at the instigation of the Devil, infer
ring
it
as the aggravation of their crime, that they could chusc the ser
vice of so bad a master.
To continue insensible of ourdangerfrom evil spirits, whether from
ignorance, inattention, or the disbelief of them
is
one of the sorest
evils that can befall us, and
is
in the church at this day
a
misery to be
lamented with tears of blood, as
it
leads to
a
fatal carelessness, expo
ses us to their subtle devices, and gives them an advantage .over us
every way. Nor are they an enemy lightly to be accounted of, being
watchful, diligent, and full of stratagems for our ruin
;
and they have

to use
it,

we have to do \titli are not to be subdued with carnal weapon*; for
here, as the apostle tells us, " we wrestle against p!"incipalities,against
"powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spi
ritual wickedness in high places," Eph.'vi. 12. But we come now
to speak of better spirits, and more to satisfaction.
If there be legions of spirits about and near us to deceive, tempt,
and annoy us, can We doubt of there being as many appointed to serve,
help, and defend us, according to their several classes and offices in
thisiour world' The conclusion is natural from parity of reasoned thp
law of opposites, according to which the Great Governor of the world
has contrasted evil with a counterballance of good, consequently, such
beneficicnt beings there doubtless always have been, and are, in readi
ness to succour the fallen human race by their friendly ministrations,
and to fill up the distance in the scale of created beings between men
and angels. The darkness of the Heathen world most certainly did
not separate them from the care of that good God, who is loving to ev
ery man, and whose mercy is over all his works: and though their
condition might not admit of communion with angels, but in rare in
stances, yet the good offices of these kindly affectioned niinisters, in
their respective provinces, might, in a sort, be angelical to them an-
swerablv to their dispensation, and serve as the lowest step in Jacob's
ladder for their communication with the Heavenly World : and by
what'is handed down to us by authors of credit concerning communica
tions of this kind to eminent persons in the ancient Heathen world, as
Socrates and others, whether by checks and warnings, impulses,
dreams, voices, or visions, we are not at liberty to doubt of an inter
course between good spirits, and the well disposed Heathens qfall
ranks, as a dispensation not so unfrequent as many suppose ; seeing'
that the instances of this kind amongst ourselves, that come to public
knowledge, bear no proportion in number to those that are concealed
from us. This, however, we are assured of upon the best authority,
that " many shall come from the East and'from the West," (in the
Gentile world)
" and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the
" kingdom of Heaven; and that many of the children of the kingdom"
(professors of the truth)
" shall be cast out," Matt. viii. 11, 12.
Though we now stand in a far higher dispensation than the Hea
thens, and are called to an innumerable company of angels, and to the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, yet we are not therefore to suppose,
that all intercourse with good spirits of an inferior order is now ceased
amongst us ; as many, who have not yet attained to the glorious pri
vileges of the Gospel, and the immediate guardianship of angels, may
nevertheless stand indebted, under God, to the ministry of such good
spirits for many important services, both in their spiritual and tempo
ral affairs ; nay, they may be to all of us in the natural world what the

of the most remarkable occurrences ofthoir past lives, will not be led
to ascribe much of assistance to the instrumentality of such invisible
friends ; nay, who can say, that they are not instituted of subordinate
agents on various occasions in conducting the scheme both of general
and particular providences > There is nothing in this supposition that
offers violence to reason or religion ; and sure it is, that we have a-
bundant credible testimonies to wonderful discoveries made by them
of a very interesting nature both to individuals, and also to society, as
of concealed writings and treasure, of murders, conspiracies, and o-
ther matters leading to the administration of justice both distributive
and punitive, » as is well known of all conversant with men and books ;
so that to give the lie to all such relations as credited by the learned,
the wise, the good of all classes, must appear nothing less than impu
dence joined with infidelity.
It has been made a common objection to the credibility of many ap
paritions, that they have been either silent, or not delivered any thing
worthy such extraordinary visits; and, consequently, that such visions
were no other than the effect of imagination and fancy, as not answer
ing to any use or purpose. To which be it answered, that the use of
siich visits may be very important, though nothing should pass in the
way of conversation between the parties during the interview ; as first,
by convincing the spectator of the reality of such beings as spirits, and
so removing doubts concerning a future slate, as by preparing him
for the return of such visits to further purpose. Secondly, by affect
ing the conscience with a tender sense of duty, or with remorse for
past offences, and impressing the mind with awful thoughts of it's
own existence in a separate state. Thirdly, by giving us to know,
that we are tlte objects of regard to beings in the other world, and
visible to them when we think not of
it,
which may serve as
a
means
to restrain us from indecent and offensive liberties in our most retired
hours, when the more weighty consideration of the Divine Omnipres
ence may not be attended to, and so lose it's proper effect upon us.
But here we are called off from answering more objections on this
subjecti to observe, that this laboured opposition to the beliel of all in
tercourse betwixt us and the other world, too often proceeds both from
a
practical and
a
speculative kind of Atheism, and consequently the
disbelief of a future state. Hence proceeds that countenance given
to some late writers in favour of Infidelity, as also that dreadful apos-
tacy amongst so many in these last days, of exalting

insanity in the world, you are possessed of it : for if there be a God,
you make Him your enemy through your unbelief; if a Heaven, what
lot have you to hope for in such inheritance? Ifa Hell, how will you
escape it .' And here also let it be asked, What is your character and
estimation in society, if true members of society, you can be called,
who have no pledge to give of your obedience and fidelity to govern
ment, as acknowledging no sanctity in an oath, which is inseparably
connected with the belief of a future state Thus void of faith ; void
of conscience, void of honour, (for what is honour without conscience)
what have you left for a support to the slenderest virtue i what have
you to engage the smallest confidence from man ? Can any firm bond
of compact or friendship find place in that heart, which has no inter
est in Hereafter to care for, and wherein every motive and measure
must take it's rise and direction from the love of self, and the love of
this world i In this case, it is more for our comfort to go by our hopes
than our fears, and therefore one would be willing to believe, from
tenderness to human nature, and also from charity, that the number of
those who are in this horrible degree of infidelity is but small ; but
however thay may be, it will be proper to observe here, that to the
many general causes of infidelity, some of which have been briefly
touched on before, as the undue exaltation of natural reason, a life of
pleasure, and confirmed habits of vice, wc may add the spirit of con
troversy and dispute long ago introduced into the Church by the arti
ficial logic of Aristotle, and encouraged and kept up in the schools as
a necessary part of education in theology, to the engendering perplex
ity and doubting on every subject, and keeping back the mind from
fixing in any settled principles of religion. The several churches of
Christendom have confessedly been long infected with this poison of
fierce contention and debate, to the bancishing of sweet peace and
brotherly love, whilst a pretended zeal for truth has served for a cloak
to that " wrath of man, which workcth not the righteousness of God."
But such carnal weapons ill befit the Christian warfare ; all such kind
of striving for victory among ourselves gives advantage to the ene
mies of our Holy Faith, and causes the Philistines to rejoice. The
best way of healing differences is by composedness and gentleness of
mind, and the truth of the Gospel of Peace is most suitably offered,
and most readily received by humble men, and such as arc of a meek
and quiet spirit. It is obvious to remark in this place, that Deism,,
Sadducism, and Atheism, did never more abound amongst us than
since the itch of controversy and wrangling, on all occasions, has filled
the world so full of false reasoning and perverse disputing : nay, the
contagion has descended to private life, and turned much of our con
versation into contradiction and a strife of words, and introduced a
bold bohaviour and an assuming talkativeness, offensive to all modest.

prehension of the apostle applied to the contentious, who, "come to-

causes of unbelief in this case, we are here led to declare not onl£
our belief, but full assurance, that extraordinary communications,
however now less frequent than formerly, are still continued to seve
ral particular members of the different Churches, though not pub-
lickly revealed by them, and that they are not to be considered only
as a particular privilege, but as making part of the state of ceftain
persons (not all) of eminent purity and piety ; and to be inwardly con
vinced of this ourselves, is to make some approach to their state; for
however we may come short of them as to like vouchsafements, yet
both in the ordinary and extraordinary gifts and graces of the Spirit,
we are led, not only to rejoice with them, but by mutual fellowship
do participate with them in the blessing ; for as in the natural body,
so also in the mystical body ofChrist, the inferior as well as the su
perior members jointly contribute to the nourishment and welfare of
the whole, by a circulation of that which every one supplieth, so that
the highest cannot say to the lowest, I have no need of thee. Thus
the meekness, the patience, and the humble condescension in some,
may countervail the high illuminations and splendid ministrations of
others, whilst a common sense of their mutual dependence and rela
tion joins them all in the unity of the Spirit to the edifying of the
Church in love ; and therefore where any, whether in the stated office
of the ministry, orothers, go about to vilify or obstruct the success of
any extraordinary way that has a manifest tendency to promote more
true godliness, they would do well to consider and stand in awe, least
they be found to oppose themselves to a work of God ; for neither can
they be sure that we are not now come to the near approach of that glo
rious state ofthe church spoken ofin so many places by the Prophets;
when the Lord shall dogreat things for her in the latter days by a re
vival of his work in righteousness and peace, shall power out his Spi
rit upon all flesh, restore the old paths of heavenly communications,
and make his Sion a praise in the earth However unpromising the
times are, yet, praised be God! we can draw comfort from the pro
mises of better days, even under the " present falling away, and the
revelation of" the man of sin foretold," 2 Thess. ii. 3, to preceed the
day «»f the Lord's coming in the power of his Spirit, to sanctify and
cleanse his Church, and to purify unto himself a peculiar people
zealous of good works ; trusting in hope that this time is near at
hand, i. e.-that he that shall come, will come and will not tarry. And
though there has been for a season a with-holding, in a measure,
from Sion the ordinary consolations of the Spirit, in the way of a
judgment work ^under grace) for self-condemnation, humiliation,
and subsequent glorification, yet we arc assured that such judgment
is sent forth unto victory over the remainder of indwelling sin ; for
there is a judgment unto righteousness, as well as a judgment unto
condemnation ; and accordingly in the former sense it is said, that
" Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
a righteousness," Isai. i. 27: so that her tribulation is for purification,
and exaltation, as it said in another place, " For a small moment have ,
" I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee, saith

*• the Lord, thy Redeemer," Isai. liv. 7. and as to the restitution of
her gifts, graces, and extraordinary dispensations, signified by pre
cious stones, under her figurative denomination of the Lord's House
or Temple, the Prophet proceeds thus : " O thou afflicted, tossed
" with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with
" fair colours,and thy foundations with sapphires,and all thy borders
" with pleasant stones ; and all thy children shall be taught of the
" Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children ; in righteousness
" shalt thou be established," Isai. liv. 11,13.
The above is but a small part of the glorious things that are spo
ken of by the evangelical Prophet, of the city of God, the spiritual
Church under the Gospel dispensation in the latter days, when she
shall have filled up the measure of her persecutions and sufferings,
both from her open enemies, and also in the house of her friends. And
we trust that the time draws very nigh for this glorious dispensation
of the New Jerusalem to take place ; and particularly, among other
important considerations, from instances of extraordinary conhnu va
cations from above, by visions and other ways, to godly men anci wo
men of different churches within this last century, and who may be
considered as the harbingers or forerunners of it. Nor did ever any
extraordinary revolution come to pass in the Church of God,without
previous notices of it first given to some chosen vessels fora,testimo-
ny to the times, to strengthen the weak in faith, to comfoit the af
flicted, to alarm the careless and impenitent, or to answer other
good purposes of the Divine Providence and goodness,
Instances of the kind above-mentioned of both sexes are ready at
hand to offer, and which were received in their day, according to the
dignity of their character, by such as were qualified to profit by their
message and ministry; but as is usual in these cases, they were re
jected by the greater part, and their names are here passed over, as it
is one design of this Preface to guard, as far as possible, against giv
ing occasion for critical caviling and dispute ; it being sufficient for
the main intent of

Sweden, of eminence and distinction in his own country, having had
an honourable employment under the crown, and being of the First

to come at the knowledge of, but for the like instances delivered down
to us on the authority of the Sacred Records, and the promise therein
made to the Church of the continuance of such manifestations in it ;
and the visions of our Author must appear to us the more extraordi
nary, when we consider that they were of the most exalted nature, as
not being exhibited objectively to the bodily organs or external sen
ses ; nor yet merely intellectual, by representations in the mind, but
purely spiritual, whereby spiritual beings and things were actually
seen and perceived by his spiritual senses, as one spirit beholds ano
ther, and answering to those expressions in Scripture, of " being in
" the Spirit," and of being " caught up by the Spirit ;" as likewise to
that rapt, trance, or extasy of the Apostle, during which he says,
" whether he was in the body, or out of the body, he could not tell," 2
Cor, xii. 2.
The same question that will be asked here, has been briefly notic
ed already : viz. If a testimony to so extraordinary a dispensation
does hot require the extraordinary seal of miracles to render it cre
dible ? To which be it further answered, that many of the Prophets
worked no miracles, and yet were believed upon their own private
testimony j and that we believe many things of the highest conse
quence in religion upon human authority, where the persons trans
mitting and delivering them, appear properly qualified and circum
stanced to give credibility to what they relate. But this argument
has been considered in the Preface to the Treatise on Influx before
mentioned ; and from the reasons adduced, and such as are ready to
be further produced, if called for, we look upon our Author's testi
mony as worthy of our acceptation in this matter, and venture to rely
on his own integrity and piety, and his disinterested and indefatigable
labours to instruct the world in the most important truths relating to
salvation, at the expence of his fortune, and the sacrifice of all worldly
enjoyments, during more than the last thirty years of his life. And
if we further reflect,thatthe whole scope and tendency of his writings
is to promote the love of God and of our neighbour; to inculcate the
highest reverence to the Holy Scriptures ; to urge the necessity
of practical holiness, and to confirm our faith in the Divinity of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: these considerations, I think,
may be allowed of as sufficient credentials (as far as human testimo
ny can go) of his extraordinary mission and character, and as
convincing marks of his sincerity and truth ; especially as we have
to add, upon the credit of two worthy persons, (one of them a learn
ed, physician, who attended him in his last sickness) that he confirm
ed the truth of all that he had published relating to his communi
cations with the World of Spirits, by his solemn testimony a very
short time before he departed this life in London, Anno Doni.

Reader, might it not seem a wonder, if a person of soextraordinary

sioned by a fever which he had about twenty years before his death.
Now it is we'll known by all his acquaintance, that our Author recov
ered of that fever after the manner of other men ; that his extraordi
nary communications commenced many years before that time, and
that his writings, both prior and subsequent to
it,
intirely harmonize
and proceed upon the same principles with an exact correspondence
;
•
and that in the whole of his conversation, transactions, and conduct of
life, he continued to the end of
it
the same uniform excellent man.#
Now,

jects with unvaried consistency, to reason accurately, and to give
proofs of an astonishing memory all the way, and

propriety and dignity of character in all the relative duties ofthe Chris-
tianlife
;
if
all this can be reconciled with the true definition ofmadness,
why then there
is
an end of 'all distinction between sane and
insane, between wisdom and folly. O fie upon those uncharitable
prejudices, which have led so many in all ages to credit and
propagate slanderous reports of the best of men, even whilst they
have been employed in the heavenly work of turning many from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.
Were an angel from Heaven to come and dwell incarnate amongst
us, may we not suppose that his conversation, discoveries, and conduct
of life, would in many things be so contrary to the errors and prejudi
ces, the ways and fashions of this world, that many would say with
one consent, he
is
beside himself
;
and where any one of our brethren,
through the divine favour, attains to any high degree of angelical
illumination, and communications, may he not expect the like treat
ment
i
I
forget the name of the philosopher, whose precepts and
lectures were so repugnant to the dissolute manners of the Athe
nians, that they sent to Hippocrates to come and cure him of his mad
ness
;
to which message that great physician returned this answer,
That
it
was not the philosopher but the Athenians that were mad.
In like manner, the wise in every city and country are the smal
ler part, and therefore must be content to suffer the reproachful
name that in truth belongs to the majority. This has been tiie case of
all extraordinary messengers for good to mankind, and the world
is
not altered in this respect. But
it
may be said, that though
it
be
thus with the ignorant and profane, yet men of education and learning
will form
a
more righteous judgment of the matter, and be determin
ed impartially according to the nature of the evidence
5
and
it
would
be well
if
this were so; but in general
it
is
far otherwise. Human
learning, considered merely in itself, neither makes
a
man
a
believer
nor an unbeliever, but confirms him in truth or error, according to his
prejudices, inclinations, or interest
;
at least
it
is
commonly so; and
therefore we find, that in all ages such among the learned as devoted
themselves so support the credit and interest of their particular pro
fessions, were always the most violent persecutors of the truth
;
for
though truth has its conveyance through the intellectual part
in
man,
yet
it
never gains its effect, or operates as
a
principle, till
it
be receiv

and so man

est good, or the greatest evil, according to the ground or disposition
in which it resides; when joined with piety and humility, it adds both
lustre and force to truth ; when joined with the corrupt passions of our
nature, it is the most violent persecuter of it : and this was the case
with the Scribes and Pharisees, and Doctors of the Law ; no greater
enemies to Christ than they ; the pride of reputation for learning, and
the authority of public teachers, unfitted them for becoming learners
at the feet of the lowly Jesus ; and therefore to them were directed
those words of our Lord : " How can ye believe, who receive honour
" one pf another,and seek not the honour that conieth of God only '."
John v. 44. Giving us hereby to understand, that the dominion of any
wrong passion over the mind, will prove a certain hindrance in our
way to divine truth.
Great as our loss is by the fall, yet something of that correspon
dent relation, which originally subsisted between the human soul and
divine truth, is still remaining with us (through grace), otherwise we
should no more be capable of receiving it when offered, than the brute
beasts, which have no understanding : but then, that all may not be
lost by wilful sin,and we rendered thereby incapable of conversion, we
must be careful not to set up idols in our hearts, nor suffer any false
interest to mislead us, as thereby the mind is tinctured with preju
dice against the truth, and the understanding receives a wrong bias,
and so we become like the false wise one spoken of in Job, chap. v. 1 4.
who "meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noon day
"as in the night." This difference in the state of the heart and the
.affections, occasions the difference we see both in the unlearned and
learned of equal natural and acquired abilities, that whilst some read
ily receive the truth in the light and love of
it,
others are always dis
puting, and always seeking, without ever coming to the knowledge
of it
As there
is
a
Correspondency, or mutual relation between rightly
disposed inilids and truth in the general, so likewise there
is
a
parti
cular correspondency or congruity between certain minds and certain
truths in particular, producing an aptitude in the former to receive
the latter as soon as offered, and that by
a
kind of intuition without
reasoning
;
and hence
it
comes to pass, that such as have
a
remarkable
fitness for this or that particular class of truths, (which we usually
term Gcnius)arc less qualified for any considerable proficiency in cer
tain others. Thus the mathematician seldom excels in metaphysican
knowledge
;
and he that may be very expert in systematical divinity
,
is
often a stranger to mystical theology

what another lackcth, whilst all may learn thereby to esteem and love

censure in the fol owing book what they do not understand, or cannot
receive, as
it
may be of use to others, who are led more in the way of

fall out by the way > Even the Scribes could say, as touching Paul :
" If a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against
"God," Acts xxiii. 9. And who can say, that what this our Author
delivers to us, as from vision and revelation in the other world, is not
the very truth.
Let it be observed here, in regard to th6 ensuing work, that though
the narrative part of it should appear to the reader of doubtful author
ity, yet the doctrinal part, where confirmed by plain Scriptures, cer
tainly merits his serious attention ; nay, many things therein, touch
ing which the Scriptures arc silent, carry weight and interna! evi
dence along with them in the judgment of impartial minds ; and
though they claim not a place among the Credenda of religion, yet
will often be found useful to illustrate them, as also to enrich the mind,
to familiarize heavenly things to the.thoughts, and to wean the affec
tions from the toys and vanities of a miserable world lying in wicked
ness. It is allowed that our Author does not, in all places through
out his writings, follow the commonly received interpretations of the
Scriptures j but so neither do all churches, nor all expositors in the
same church. Though as to life and godliness, and consequently what
pertains to salvation,the Scriptures are sufficiently plain, yet with res
pect to many difficult and mysterious parts of them, they continue
wrapped up in a venerable obscurity, to be opened according to the
needs and states of the church to the end of the world; and we doubt
not to affirm, that the highly illuminated Swedenborg has been in
strumental in bringing hidden things to light, and in revealing the
spiritual sense of the Sacred Records above any other person, since
the church became possessed of that divine treasure. In the present
dark night of general apostacy has this New Star appeared in our
northern hemisphere, to guide and comfort the bewildered traveller
on his way to Bethlehem. . .
It is further to be remarked on our Author s writings, (of which
the following Treatise is little more than a twentieth part) that the
representation he therein gives us of the heavenly kingdoms, sets
before us that world of desires so objectively to the human intellect
and reason, nay, even to our sensible apprehension, as to accommo
date the description of it to the clear ideas of our minds, whether they
be called innate, acquired, or (as he, pronounces them) influxive
from the spiritual world. He gives us to know from autopsy, or his
own view of it, that Heaven is not so dull a place, as some foolishly
suppose it who having no ideas of
it,
so neither desire to have any,
and this through
a
superstitious fear in some of profaining the sub
ject by any association of natural ideas; whereas nature, in the state
of man's innocence, was constituted
a
fair representation of the first
or lowest Heaven; and though
it
be now sadly corrupted and defor
med- through the entrance and dominion of sin, yet as far as we can
separate thl evil from the good, so far
it
adumbrates to us celestial
things .
nay, even the art and ingenuity of man, as displayed in works
of nature is
a
ray of the divine skill manifested in the human mind.

them from the Lord, Exod, xxxvi i. If then we receive innocent
satisfaction here from viewing beautiful houses and gardens, why-
should we bs so averse .from thinking th at there are celestial man
sions and paradises in the kingdom of our Father ? Does music
delight us I why may we not hope to be entertained with rhorte
ravishing harmony from the vocal and instrumental melody of the
angels in Heaven l How chearing both to the mind and senses,
and also helpful' to pious meditations in good men, are the sweetly .
variegated scenes of nature in the prime of the year ! and can we
be unwilling to believe that corresponding heavenly scenes are
provided for the delectation of departed happy souls in the land
of bliss I Especially when we understand (as understand we may)
that all that is truly pleasing, beautiful, and harmonious in nature,
is by influx from the spiritual into the natural world ; in which latter,
archetypal glories are faintly represented to us by earthly images.

to Heaven, he had no great longing for the place, as he could
not see what great pleasure there could be in sitting '
{*)
on a cloud, and singing of psalms". But had that impious man re
flected, that Heaven or Hell must be the everlasting portion of every
one in the other world ; and had he been acquainted with our Au
thor's writings, he would not have treated the glories of the place
with such ludicrous profaneness ; but have thought, and spoken, and
lived better than he did ; nay, he might have wished it his lot to be
there even from a principle of epicurism in a certain sense ; for all
spiritual beings must have spiritual senses, andif in Heaven,those sen
ses mus be gratified with delights adapted thereto: but where any one
is so grossly sensual, as to place the supreme felicity of a spirit in
such gratifications as suit only with the corporeal part of our pre
sent degraded nature, may it not ttM£*d of sufh a one, that he lias
degraded it still lower, even to the IcveTflfWass in his understand
ing, and that of a swine by his affections? The work before us will
help suchaone to very different conceptions of the heavenly kingdom,
even as to those particular beatitudes which are most nearly accom
modated to the ideas of sense ; and he may also therein learn, that all
the relative duties, all the social virtues, and all the tender affections
that give consistence and harmony to society, and do honour to hu
manity, find place and exercise in the utmost purity in those delecta
ble abodes, where every thing that can delight the eye, or rejoice the
heart, entertain the imagination, or exalt the understanding, conspire
innocence, with love, joy, and peace, to bless the sprits of just men
made perfect, and to make glad the city of our CJod.
Such, dear reader, and so excellent are the things here offered for
thy entertainment and instruction by this wonderful traveller. But
if,
after all, thou canst not read him as the enlightened Seer, and the ex
traordinary messenger of important news from the other world, read
him as the Christian, divine and sage interpreter of the Scriptures

these characters, read him at least as the ingenious author of a divine
romance ; but if neither as juch he can give content, I have only to
add ; Go thy way, and leave the book to those that know how to make
a better use of it; and such, I trust, are not a few among the serious,
being willing to hope, for the honour of our country, that if such a
ludicrous representation of Hell, as passes under the title of The
Vision* of Don Quevedo, could make its way amongst us through no
less than ten editions, there will not be wanting in the land a sufficient
number of persons of sober reflection and contemplative minds, to
give all due encouragement to a work so well calculated as this is, to
promote true wisdom and godliness., by credible testimony to the rea
lities of the World of Spirits, and to the respective states and condi
tions of departed souls.
As to the persons concerned in translating and conducting-the pub*
lication of the following extraordinary work, I may venture to say, that
they deserve wcH of the public, as far as the most disinterested pains
and benevolent intentions can justify the expression; and though we
are far from obtruding the contents of this book on any, as demanding
an implicit faith therein, yet we cannot but zealously recommend them
to the most serious attention of those who are qualified to receive
them, as subjects of the greatest importance, high as Heaven, and
i, deep as Hell, and comprehending all that is within us, and without us;
as a key that unlocks all worlds, and opens to us wonderful mysteries
i both in nature and grace; as displaying many hidden secrets oftime and
eternity, and acquainting us with the laws of the spiritual worlds; as
leading us from Heaven to Hell, and bringing us, as it were, into
the company of angels, nay, into the presence chamber of the King of ,
Saints, and Lord of Glory. In a word, whatever is most desirable to
know, whatever most deserving of our affections, and whatever is most
interesting in things pertaining to salvation ; all this is the subject of
"
the following volume.
We are not unprepared for the opposition that may be expected to
any tresh discoveries of truth, especially, as has been observed before
where the credit or interest of any considerable profession or body of
men is concerned. Established doctrines and opinions arc considered
as sacred, and the sanction of custom gives them the firmness of a
rock with most ; as is known to have been the case in physic, astrono
my, and natural philosophy, in which, truth, though supported by the
evidence of demonstation, has scarcely been able to make its way in a
century. Besides, the pride of loarning is strong on the side of esta
blished institutes, and for men to part with what they have been buil
ding up with much study and pains for a great part of their lives, is a
mortifying consideration; they are startled at the thoughts of becom
ing thus poor, and some would be as willing to part with their skins, as
with their acquisitions of this kind , and hence it is, that we read of so
many martyrs to error and folly in all ages. These things considered,
we are not to wonder that our Author's publications have met with no •
better encouragement hitherto in his own coutry,(as is usually the case
'with prophets) we being informed seme time ago by a worthy mer-
cli«at residing at Gottenburg) that but fuw of the clergy (as far as had

SO Preface,
come to his knowledge) liad there received them ; and that the Reve
rend Dr. Beyer, a learned man, and professor in Divinity in that uni
versity, had suffered much persecution for adopting and propagating
the truths contained in his writings, and was not suffered to print his
explication and defence of them in Sweden. But to the honour of our
constitution, we can as yet call the liberty of the press (and a liberty
within the bounds of decency may it always be) the privilege of En
glishmen, and therefore may reasonably hope for better success to our
Author's writings in this land of freedom ; not that we expect any en
couragement on their behalf from our pharisees and bigots of any de-
nomination,for they are the same every where ; but our hopes arc from
men of unprejudiced minds, dead to self and the world, of a simplified
understanding, and such as are friends to wisdom wherever they find
her ; in a word, whose spirit harmonizes with truth, and whose hearts
-• are unison to heavenly things.
I cannot think of concluding this Preface without speaking some
what particular to a point of doctrine, the knowledge of which is the
more necessary to the reader for the right understanding of the Au
thor's writings, as in the vast variety of subjects and new discoveries
that he presents to us,it has a principal connection with most of them,
nay, is the true key in his hand that opens the secrets of the visible
and invisible worlds, explains man to himself, and also reveals the spi
ritual sense of the Sacred Writings. The doctrine I am here speaking
of is that of Correspondency or Correspondence, which are terms
nearly of the same signification.
Correspondence or Correspondency, in a pilosophical sense, is a
kind of analogy that one thing bears to another, or the manner in which
one thing represents, images, or answers to another; and this doctrine,
as it refers to things in Heaven and in Earth,according to their natural
relations, is given us in the following adage of the renowned Hermes
Trismegistus :—Omnia que in celis, sunt in tcrris terrestri modo ;
omnia gutc in terru, sum in ccclis cxlesti modo.
This natural or material world, in which we live as to the body, pro
ceeds derivatively (in a sense consistent with the Mosaic account of
the creation) from the Spiritual World, and subsists by continual in
flux from it ; it is as a spiritual thing formed into a palpable and mate
rial thing, as an essence cloathing itself with a form, or as a soul mak
ing to itself a body. Therefore this world, and all things in
it,
as far
forth as they stand in the divine order, do correspond to Heaven and
heavenly things
;
but now (through the fall of man) stauding in evij, as
well as good, the dark, evil, or hellish world has gained a form in out
ward nature. Hence
it
is, that so many evil men, evil beasts, and
poisonous things, 'together with all the disorders in the natural world,
bear its impressions and properties, and make this world
a
kind of tor
ment-house to us. Man, considered in himself,
is
a
little image of
Heaven or Hell, and also ofthis outward world, which no other being

;
and therefore he

the most wonderful of all God's creatures. At
death he puts off his part in this material kingdom, and passes into
one of the other two, being its servant to which he obeys or unites him

;

set his u affections on things above," Col. iii.. 2, as they constitute the
band of union betwixt Heaven and Hell, and the soul of man. These
three worlds are called Principles, as first, the light or heavenly
world; secondly, the dark or hellish world; and thirdly this natural or
material world ; and man's reasoning faculty stands in the center of the
three, and receives impressions from each, as it turns to one or other
of them ; then speculates on the materials it derives thence, and con
tends for or against right and triyli, even as the affections are set, for
these bias, lead, or bribe it ; and therefore, if reason be not enlightened
from above, under the conduct of good affections, it is a mcar mercen
ary, ready to enlist on any side.
The human nature was so almost universally corrupted at the
time of our Saviour's advent in the flesh, that unless Jesus Christ had
come into the world when He did, to restore the heavenly principles
of light and grace, or truth and goodness, through the medium of his
Humanity, (all immediate communication between God and the soul
being well nigh ceased, the human race must have perished, by falling
irrecoverably into the evil principle, to the utter extinction of truth,
and the loss of all free will to good; but by the entrance of this Divine
Friend into the human nature, He opened the shut gate of communi
cation betwixt Heaven and Earth, God and the soul, and so became
our great Mediator and Gracious Redeemer. But still we are at liber
ty to receive or reject Him as our Sanctifi cation and.complete Redemp
tion, for man can only be saved consistently with choice and free will.
Men had lost the true original language of nature (which expressed
things according to their qualities and properties) before the flood,
even so much of it as had remained among the posterity of Scth and
Enoch for a considerable time ; and this ignorance they fell into on
their losing the knowledge of nature in its correspondence to divine
and heavenly things; for nature in it's proper order, as observed before,
is the book of God, and exhibits spiritual things in material forms. In
the room therefore of this was substituted a language by letters and
reading in books, to help him this way for attaining to divine know
ledge, as rudiments leading thereto in our present state of ignorance,
in which literature is mistaken by most for wisdom itself; however the
door was and is still open for immediate heavenly communications,
but what through unbelief, earthly mindedness, and other sad impedi
ments, few at this time are qualified for so high a privilege. The ear
ly ancients after the flood had some knowledge of Correspodcncy de
rived down to them by tradition, though without any perception of it
in themselves : and it remained longest among the Egyptains, of which
their Hieroglyphics or sacred sculptures were a principal part ; but by
degrees they became so far corrupted and blind, as to lose sight of the
things represented, and to worship their representatives or images.
Hence the original of their foolish idolatry of beasts, birds, fishes, and
vegetables. Our enlightened Author, had he lived longer, designed,
as he told me, to give us the key to the ancient hicroglyphital learn
ing, saying, at the same time, that none but himself could do it; but
he did not live to publish this. Yet, since his death, there has been
found among his posthumous words, a small fragment on this subject,

;int'itled, G/araw Hieroglyfihica Arcanorum JVaturalium isf Sfitritualium,
&c. which, though it does not seem tobe a finished piece, nevertheless
contains much useful knowledge, and well deserves the attention of
'
all men of letters.
The knowledge of Correspondences is now almost intcrely lost, es
pecially in Europe, where even the name is little understood ; and this
is one rtntin cause of the obscurity of the Scriptures of the Old Testa
ment, which were chiefly written by the rules of this science; nay, man
also, as an image of the spiritual and natural worlds, contains in himself
the Correspondences of both, ofthe former in his interior, and ofthe latter
in his exterior or bodily part, and so is called the Microcosm, or little
world. Thus for example; all the organs of his senses, hisfeatures, bow
els, and vessels, even to the minutest vein and nerve, correspond to
something in the soul or spiritual part,On the other hand the affections
and passions ofthe mind represent themselves naturally in the face and
features, so that the countenance would be naturally index to the mind,
were men in a state of simplicity, without guile and dissimulation ;
and yet, as matters stand at present, so much still appears of the mind,
in the correspondent features of the face, as to serve for a type, sig
nature, or impression thereof. Thus love, haired, hope, fear, joy, sor-
•
row, assent, contempt, surprize, &c. do naturally, and often involunta-
raily, manifest themselves in the visage ; In like manner the will, by
the actions and motions ofthe body ; the understanding expresses it-
"
self in the speech, and the affections in the sound or voice; -and all these
by influx from within, and Correspondence from withput : and as the
features correspond to the affections, so does the eye to the intellect,
the nose to the faculty of discerning, and the ears to attention and o-
bedience ; accordingly we use the word quickrtighted, to signify a
ready apprehension; and penetration or discernment is sometimes ex
pressed by smelling a thing out ; and to hearken in the Scripture means
to obey. Be it likewise observed, that the heart corresponds to sin
cerity of love; the loins, &c. to conjugal affection; the bowels to com
miseration; the hands and fingers to operation, Sec. and so much of the
language of nature still remains, as to express by these outward repre
sentatives the corresponding powers, passions, and affections of the
soul, which influences and actuates these several members and parts,
as every one experiences. And as the body in its several parts and of
fices corresponds to the soul and its operations, so does the soul in its
several faculties and powers to the heavenly world in all things good,
a*id the hellish world in all things evil. Thus wisdom, love, purity ,
innocence, &c. have reference to the celestial kingdom, as being com
munications by influx from thence, and therefore it is that Heaven bears
a near analogy to man, (as standing in his right order) and is called by
iOur Author The Grand Man : for the human form is the most per
fect of all, and acordingly, God assumed it in condescension to man re
presents Himself to us by it,and manifests Himself in it,at times,to the
holy angels: so .likewise the angelical societies, according to their dis
tinguishing qualities and excellence, bear a particular relation to this
or that part ofthe human form. Thus,as our Author informs us one so
ciety corresponds to, or is in, the province of the head, and they are

such as excel in wisdom; another to the heart, being such as excel in
love. ; and some to the arms, as being of superior strength, and so on.
Thus, as the body corresponds to the soul, so the soul in its true state
and order corresponds to Heaven, and Heaven to God, who is the only
original fountain of goodness and truth, of all blessedness and perfec
tion, from whom they descend, in their different kinds and degrees,
through the heavenly and spiritual worlds, down to this last and lowest
form of creation, the earth in which we now dwell.
The earth likewise, in its different kingdoms, animal, vegetable, and
mineral, corresponds to things in the spiritual world. Thus not only
the beasts of the field, and the birds of the air, according to their dif
ferent properties, have a representative meaning in Scripture, but also
trees and plants of various kinds ; so in particular, those of the aromatic
kind, as also the olive, the vine, and the cedar, do figure divine gifts
and graces, and other rare endowments in the human heart and mind;
and m like manner, gold, silver, precious stones, and other particulars
of rich furniture in the tabernacle and temple, are mentioned in Scrip
ture with a corresponding reference to goodness, truth, purity ofaffec
tion, holiness, &c. and so the wisest interpreters expounded them, and
this not by arbitrary significations, but as outward firofier signs of
things inward and sfiiritual. Thus all nature is a theatre of divine
wonders, representative of the invisible world to such as are of a right
understanding and discernment, as our Author has exemplified in a
thousand instances. It is hoped, that what has been here offered on the
subject of Correspondency, will be found useful to such as are in a
disposition to give the following book an attentive perusal.
From the great variety of important subjects and discoveries to be
met with in our Author's writings, I cannot refrain from observing on
one more, as deserving our particular regard, as also to prepare the
reader for what he is to meet with in this volume, viz. the doctrine of
the intermediate state of departed souls, called here, The World of
Spirits, as being that in which they all meet after death, (except a very
few, who pass directly to Heaven or Hell) in order to their last pre
paration for final bliss or misery. This doctrine has long been re
ceived in the church, and revealed to many by their departed friends ;
but having been much disfigured and misrepresented, like some other
truths, by erroneous additions and lucrative figments in the church of
Rome, it was not admitted by our first reformers, who, instead of re
forming the doctrine, totally rejected it under the opprobrious name
of a Popish Purgatory ; however, it has been retained by most of the
spiritual, otherwise called mystic, writers in all churches, and I have
seen a judicious defence of it by the Hon. Archibald Campbell in our
own ; but the book, I believe, is scarce. Sure it is, that as far as our
Author's credit and authority extend, the truth of the doctrineVill not
be questioned, as he relates, that he had frequent rapts or translations
of spirit to that intermediate world, and had there seen and conversed
with most, if not all, his departed friends and acquaintance, besides a
great number of others, to the amount of very many thousands. In
this intermediate world, which he calls a state of Vasiation, the good
spirits are gradually purified from all the stains and defilements ef sin
which thev had contracted in this world ; whilst the good principle

predominating in them takes full possession of all their faculties and
powers, confirms them in good habits, and renders them meet to be par
takers of Heavenly joys ; on which they are translated to Heaven. On the
other hand, the bad spirits are gradually divested of those superficial
and apparent virtues, and all that adventious, external good, which be
fore had served as covers to the evil principle within, which now pre
dominates without reserve or controul, confirming them in their evil
habits, and repugnancy to all good; which being effected, they pre
cipitate themselves into the infernal pit, to join company with such as
are like themselves. Thus what is a state of purification to the good,
is to bad spirits a state of separation of all extraneous good from that
radical evil which constitutes the essence of their nature.
Now this doctrine appears consonant, first, to reason, as it accords
with the tenor of the divne administration in the government of this
world, in which all things proceed to their limit or completion in a
regular and" gradual process. Secondly, It is consonant to religion, as
it vindicates the divine attributes from all imputation of undue severity,
by laying man's destruction at the proper door, and as the inevitable
consequence of his own free choiqe. Thirdly, This doctrine yields
consolation to the humble pious Christian, as the time of his depar
ture draws nigh. Few such, upon a strict examination of themselves,
are so well satisfied with their slate, as to find nothing lacking, but
that they are already fitly qualified for the society of the holy angels ;
whereas the belief, that an intermediate state is appointed, wherein
every thing that now hindereth shall be removed out of the way, and
their souls purified from every pollution and spot contracted by their
union with this fleshly nature, through the prevailing power and en
ergy of the divine principle within them, and so bringing them into
the state of just men made perfect, they can take comfort from this
consideration, and meet their change with a holy confidence.
If this be so, and that the same intermediate state, which purifies
the good spirits, leaves the bad under the total dominion of evil by
their own free choice, that so both may be possessed by their own
proper principle respectively, and go to their own proper place ; how
say some, that the devils will be essentially transformed into angels
of light, at a certain time appointed by the Father? We desire here
to oppose, with the greatest tenderness, a doctrine which we have
heretofore judged favourably of, and modestly to offer the reasons of
our present dissent, wishing rather that we could agree with some
excellent men on the other side of the question ; but human wishes
are no rule of the divine proceeding, and even charity must be di
rected by the principle of truth, and the established laws and nature
of things. We find ourselves in a sort called upon to offer a few ob
servations on this subject, at a time when there is much reason to be
lieve, that many have revived this doctrine more to quiet their fears,
and so lull them into a false peace, than from any conviction of their
understanding; whereas they may be supplied with a much surer re
medy against those fears in the comfortable promises to the truly
penitent delivered in the Gospel of our most compassionate Saviour,
whose last declaration to his disciples before his ascension was.

Preface. 35
i* That repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his
" name among all nations," Luke xxiv. 47.
It is evident, that the plainest Scripture (and such mc are to go fcy )
are against the doctrine before mentioned ; and that the same force of
words that is therein used to express the eternal happiness of those
that are saved, is also made use ofto express the eternity of their state
who are lost, but the advocates for that side of the question rest their
plea and stress of their argument on the foot of divine mercy ; and
God forbid that we should go about to straiten that mercy towards o-
thers, (though even devils) to which the very best of us stand indebted
both for all we have, and all we have to hope for ; and did the matter
of the question turn merely upon mercy, in like manner as a goal
delivery depends on the arbitrary clemency of an earthly prince, I
doubt not, that either one single soul would not go to Hell, or if any,
that a host of angels would be sent thither with a message of mercy ;
nay, if necessary to their salvation, that even Jesus Christ himself
would condescend so far, as to visit those unhappy prisoners with a
free offer of peace and reconciliation for their redemption. But here
it must be observed, that mercy misunderstood and misapplied, is no
other that man's ovin false idea of mercy. God's mercy in regard to
man respects him as a creature that He has endowed with freedom of
will, and whose happiness or misery depends on the right or wrong
direction of his choice and affections, by which he becomes capable
or incapable of the divine mercy. Now to comfiel such a creature,
is to undo him, to unmake him what he is ; and therefore mercy, with
regard to him, is to provide for him such means and motives as may
influence his understanding, will, and affections to what is good as his
free choice. Now through the mercy of God every thing is done in
this life (which is man's only state of probation) in order to this end,
though man knoweth it not ; how then are we to expect, that any
means of this kind should be more effectual in the other world, where
in all things are represented to us as unchangeable, where the tree
lieth as it falls for Heaven, or Hell, and where all things increase in
their respective kingdoms? Praised be the name of the Lord, for his
mercy endureth for ever? And as it is infinite, so extends to all pos
sible cases ; but to make us good, that we may be qualified for happi
ness against our will, is no possible case, seeing that to be good, is to
will good with desire and affection, which the self hardened and im
penitent are averse to, and therefore render themselves unreccptive
x>{ mercy. Now the very idea of diabolism carries in it repugnancy
and hatred to God and goodness, and consequently the greatest con
trariety to the possibility of conversion. Were it otherwise, and that
the most malignant spirit in Hell could sincerely say, " Lord, I am
u weary and ashamed of this evil nature, and sorry for the sins that
« have brought me into it ; O help and deliver me through thy mcr-
" cy from it, that I may be converted, and become thy servant!" In
this case, he would instantly cease to be a devil, and become an ob
ject of the divine mercy ; but repentance, prayer, and the desire of
good, is all from the grace of God, and can in no wise dwell in those
who are the willing servants of sin, and therefore only free from, not
o righteousness, Rom, vi. 20.

36 Preface.
It is supposed by some, that length of suffering will at last subdue
the reluctance of the will, melt the heart into tenderncss,and turn the
worst of evil spirits to repentance and supplication for pardoning mer
cy, and qualify them for it ; but this, as just now observed, is the sole
effect of that grace which they are not admissive of, and not the effect
of suffering which has no such power belonging to it ; but has its dif
ferent effects relative to the different states of those who are the sub
jects of its operations. Thus we see, that as the same fire which
melts the wax, hardens the clay, so the sharpest sufferings have con
trary effect on different persons. They who have any remnant of
grace in their inmost soul, (however unrighteous they have been
outwardly) any spark of the divine life still remaining in their interior
are softened and meiorated by them and become obedient to the Hea
venly voice, crying within them, Why will ye die >. Turn unto the
Lord, that inquity may not be your ruin : whilst the obdurate and im
penitent say in their hearts with Pharaoh, Who is the Lord, that we
should obey him > and turn that punishment, which should be for
their amendment, into the occasion of their blasphemy and despair.
Could length of suffering produce the effect before mentioned, we
might naturally suppose that some change forthe better would, in the
course of thousands of years, have taken place in him who is called
in Scripture, Apoc. xx. 2. « That old Serpent, which is the Devil
" and Satan ;" and yet, as he had the presumption to tempt our Sa
viour in the wilderness, and still continues to practice his wicked de
vices, in order to work our ruin ; so of him it is foretold, that after be
ing bound a thousand years, and being loosed from his prison, he will
again go out to deceive the nations, Apoc. xx. 7, 8 ; so little of like
lihood, if any possibility, there is, that they who have confirmed them
selves in enmity and hatred to all goodness, should become capable
of repentance to salvation. I desire not to strain any argument beyond
its proper strength against any hypothesis, which I find myself more
ready to receive, upon any satisfactory grounds, than to reject ; but
let truth be ever held sacred and inviolable, whether it be according
or contrary to our natural -inclinations and wishes : nor let that be
called a want of charity, where charity is not concerned, or would
suffer perversion and abuse ; for charity, which in its proper significa
tion is love, cannot extend to that which is essentially evil ; otherwise
we must condemn that solemn appeal of the man after God's own
heart : " Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee '." Psal. exxxix.

a good king) that he had joined himself in confederacy with the wick
ed Ahaziah, as in those words of Jehu ; " Shouldst thou help the un-

" thee from before the Lord," 2 Chron. xix. 2. Whence we are to
learn a caution how we bring dishonour upon this divine grace of
charity, by misapplying it to false and unworthy objects, to the lessen

three short remarks to the serious reader, as no other is capable of
reaping any benefit from our Auther's writings ; nor to others have
we any thing to say, unless it be to caution them against treating with
derision or scurrility such matters as they may be more nearly con
cerned in, than they at present suppose. Even the very dreams of
good men, in relation to things of the other world, have at times some
thing divine in them, and are not lightly to be regarded ; but where
such communicate to us important instructions and discoveries as by
commission, and from their own experience, and that with delibera
tion, consistency, and clearness, they demand our attention and reve
rence. And here it is to be observed, that what this Author has pub
lished to the world concerning the states of departed souls respective
ly,
the laws of the invisible worlds, and
a
thousand particular circum
stances belongingthercto, appear to be such as could never enter into
the heart of man to conceive, unless they had been given to him from
above ,and also carry something ofan internal evidence along with them
as soon as they are received by a serious mind
;
for, after all,
it
is
more
the righttemper and disposition ofthe mind,than its sagacity ,that gives
us to see these things in their proper light.
It
is
every wise man's care
to guard against
a
stubborn incredulity on the one hand, as well as a-
gainst any delusion that an overhasty belief mightexpose him to on the
other; and in this age ofdoubting and disputing all things of
a
spritual
nature, our greater danger
is
confessedly from the former side, and
therefore
it
behoves us to give the more heed, that we lean not to the
error of the times. Besides, the weight and importance of the subr
jects here treated of adds to the credibility of the message, as coincid
ing with our confidence in the promises of the Lord, that He will re
veal his secrets to his servants, and not forr.ake his Church in the time
of her extremity
;
but send his extraordinary messengers and minis- .
ters endued with light and power from on high to alarm the careless,
to call back the wanderers, to confirm the wavering, and to comfort
the spirit of the humble and contrite ones with glad tidings from the
heavenly Canaan, the lot of their inheritance; and this in order to
make ready
a
people prepared for the Lord against his second advent
in spirit to build up the walls' of the New Jerusalem; and when should
such messengers be more expected, or when more intitled to
a
bet
ter welcome, that in this our time of desolations, when faith and chari
ty have so far failed amongst us, and when darkness
is
on the face of
the deep, darkness in the Church, and darkness in the state, darkness
in the minds of good men, and darkness on all the dispensations of
Providence,so as to give emphatical application of those words of the
Psalmist to our present condition
:
" It
is
tinie, O Lord, that thou have
mercy upon Sion, yea, the time
is
come," Psal. cii.
1
3. But who are
they that most reject the testimony of those special messengers, and
those faithful witnesses to the Truth, which the Father of Lights has
sent from time to time for the edification of his Church, and the con
firmation of the faith of many in it? Who but such as are ever calling
out for more evidence for believing, and pleading the want of
it
in
justification of their unbelief, whilst at the same time they labour
all they can to invalidate the evidence of all human testimony, which
is
the ordinary medium through which divine Ti uth
is
conveyed to us.

38 Preface.
And now, dear Reader, I bid you farewcl, sincerely 'wishing that
you may be of the number of those who take the Holy Scriptures for
their guide, as their authentic outward rule of faith and life, and in an
honest and good heart receive the Word of God, and keep it ; i and
may the Spirifof Wisdom give us a right judgment in all things per
taining to salvation, that so we may be preserved from error through
an over-hasty credulity on the one hand, and an obstinate incredulity
on the other ; neither rejecting the testimony of men fearing God,
and of good report, as to what great things the Lord hath done for
them, and to be communicated by them for the benefit of their bre
thren ; nor suffering ourselves to be imposed on by the cunning
craftiness of such as lie in wait to deceive ; and as it is more profita
ble for us to have the heart established in grace, and to glorify God in
our lives, than to be gifted with visions and particular revelations,
(through danger of being exalted above measure thereby) so let us
not be high-minded, but fear; nor, because others have been so fa
voured, expect or desire the same ourselves, but walk humbly and
contentedly in the way of God's ordinary dispensations, lest presump
tion or a vain curiosity should expose us to the danger of delusion
from our spiritual enemy ; and as to those that cannot receive many
of the things delivered in the following book, and also as to those that
do receive them, let them not judge one another, but follow the rule
of moderation laid down by the Apostle, Rom. xiv- every one abiding
by that of which he is persuaded in his own mind, in a candid forbear
ance towards others. In men of a Christian spirit, charity easily
beareth all such things, fcelieveth all things for good, and hopeth all
things for the best ; and as we are all brethren on a journey to the
same heavenly country, so let us hold on our way together in peace,
and that love, which is more than knowledge ; and may the God of
peace and love be with us;

is iii himself the Fountain of all Truth. It is the concluding part of
your Letter that chiefly engages my attention* where you say as fol
lows; "As after your departure from England disputes may arise on
" the subject of your writings, and so give occasion to defend their
" Author against such false reports and aspersions, as they who are
" no friends to Truth may invent to the prejudice of his character,
" may it not be of use, in order to refute any calumnies of that kind,
" that you leave behind some short Account of yourself, as concern-
u ing, for example,yourdegreesin the university, the offices you have
" borne, your family and connections, the honours which 1 am told
u have been conferred upon you, and such other particulars as may
" serve to the vindication of your character, if attacked ; that so any
" ill-grounded prejudices may be obviated or removed? For where J
" the honour and interest of truth are concerned, it certainly behoves
" us to employ all lawful means in its defence and support." After
reflecting on the foregoing passage, I was induced to comply with
your friendly advice, by briefly communicating the following circum
stances of my life.
I was born at Stockholm, in the year of our Lord 1689,Jan.29.My
Father's name was Jespcr Swedberg, who was Bishop of Westrogo-
thia, and of celebrated character in his time. He was also a member
of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, formed on the model
of that in England, and appointed President of the Swedish churches
in Pennsylvania and London by King Charles XII. In the year 1710 1
began my travels, first into England, and afterwards into Holland,
France, and Germany, and returned home in 1714. In the year 1716,
and afterwards, I frequently, conversed with Charles XII. King of
Sweden, who was pleased to bestow on me a large share of his favour,
and in that year appointed me to the office of Assessor in the Metallic
College, in which office I continued from that time till the year 1747,
when I quitted the office, but still retain the salary annexed to it as
an appointment tor life. The reason of my with-drawing from the
business of that employment was, that I might be more at liberty to
apply myself to that new function to which the Lord had called me.
About this time a place of higher dignity in the state was offered me,
which I declined to accept, lest it should prove a snare to me. In
1719 I was ennobled by Queen Ulrica Elconora, and named Sweden-
borg ; from which time I have taken my seat with the Nobles of the
Equestrian Order, in the Triennial Assemblies ofthe States. I am a
Fellow, by invitation, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm,
but have never desired to be of any other community, as I belong to
the Society of Angels, in which things spiritual and heavenly are the
only subjects of discourse and entertainment ; whereas in our literary
societies the attention is wholly taken up with things relating to the
body and this world. In the year 17341 published the Rcgnum Mme-
nle at Leipsic, in three volumes, folio; and in 1738 I took a journey
into Italy, and staid a year as Venice and Rome.
With respect to my family connections : I had four sisters ; one of
them was married to Erick Benzelius, afterwards promoted to the
Archbishopric of Upsal ; and thus I became related to the two

succeeding Archbishops of that See, both named Benzelius, and
younger brothers of the former. Another of my sisters was married
to Lars Benzelstierna, who was promoted to a provincial government,
but these are both dead ; however, two bishops who are related tome,
arc still living ; one ofthem is named Filenius, Bishop of Ostrogothia,
who now officiates as President of the Ecclesiastical Order in the
General Assembly at Stockholm, in the room of the Archbishop, who
is infirm ; he married the daughter of my sister ; the other, who is
named Benzelstierna, Bishop of Westermannia and Dalccarlia, is the
son of my second sister ; not to mention others of my family who are
dignified. I converse freely, and am in friendship with all the Bishops
of my country, which are ten in number, and also with the Sixteen
Senators, and the rest of the Grandees, who love and honour me, as
knowing that I am in fellowship with Angels. The King and Queen
themselves, as also the three Princes their sons, shew me all
kind countenance ; and I was once invited to eat with the King and
Queen at their table, (an honour granted only to the Peers of the
realm) and likewise since with the Hereditary Prince. All in my
own country wish for my return home : so far am I from the least
danger of persecution there, as you seem to apprehend, and are also
kindly solicitous to provide against; and should any thing of that
kindbefal me elsewhere, it will give me no concern.
Whatever of worldly honour and advantage may appear to be in the
things before-mentioned, I hold them as matters of low estimation,
'when compared to the honour of that sacred office to which the Lord
himself hath called mo, who was graciously pleased to manifest him
self to me his unworthy servant, in a personal appearance in the year
1743 ; to open in me a sight of the Spiritual World, and to enable me
to converse with Spirits and Angels ; and this privilege has been con
tinued to me to this day. From that time I began to print and publish
various unknown Arcana, that have been either seen by me, or reveal
ed to me, concerning Heaven and Hell ; theState of Men after Death ;
the True Worship of God ; the Spiritual Sense of the Scriptures ; and
many other important truths tending to salvation and true wisdom j
and that mankind might receive benefit from there communications,
was the only motive which has induced me at different times to
leave my home to visit other countries. As to this world's wealth,
I have sufficient, and wore I neither seek nor wish for.
Your Letter has drawn the mention of these things from me, in
case, as you say, they may be a means to prevent or remove any false
judgment or wrong prejudices with regard to my personal circum
stances. Farewel ; and I heartily wish you prosperity both in things
spiritual and temporal, of which I make no doubt, if so be you go on
to pray to our Lord, and to set him always before you.

TREATISE
CONCERNING
HEAVEN AND HELL.
IN our Lord's discourse with his disciples on the
Consummation ofthe age, (1) or last time of the church,
at the end of his prophecies concerning its successive
states in regard to love and faith, (2) he says thus: " Im-
"
mediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
" sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
K7* References for explanation, illustration, and proof, to a Latin
work of the Author, in eight volumes in quarto, intitled, Arcana
Calcutta, or, Heavenly Mysteries, printed in numbers or short sec
tions, to which the references direct, n. with the figures following
that letter, denotes the number of the section referred to, from the
beginning to the end of that work.
[The above work has been translated into English, and published in 8 vols,.
octavo.]
N. B. As the references under many articles are too numerous to
be inserted, the translator often passes over the preceding num
bers, and only gives two or three of the last ; as the Author, in the
body of that work, by a most stupendous strength of memory, ge
nerally refers the reader to the foregoing numbers, in which the
subject matter before him is treated of.
(1) The words here translated, The consummation of tie age, is
the true rendering from the Greek, and not, The end of the tvjrld,
as in our common translation, the word 'Atwo never signifying the
vortd, but an age or period of time, or a dispensation of things ; and
here particularly, of the church, as explained by the Author : and
that it here signifies the end of the church under its present dis
pensations, see n. 4535, 10672.
(2) Our Lord's predictions concerning the consummation of the
asje, his second advent, the successive desolation ofthe church and
the last judgment, as in Matt. xxiv. xxv. are explained in the work
intitled, Arcana Calestia, in the prefixes to Genesis, from the fifth
to the twenty-fourth chapter, n. 3353 to 3356, &c. and 5063 to 507 1 .

42 . . A treatise concerning
" and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of
" the heavens shall be shaken ; and then shall appear the
" sign of the Son of Man in heaven : and then shall all
" the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the
'" Son of Man coming in the clouds of Heaven with
" power and great glory : and he shall send his angels
" with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather
" together his elect from the four winds, from one end
" of Heaven to the other." Mattv xxiv. 29, &c. They
who understand these words according to the sense of
the letter, suppose that all these things are to come to
pass, as they are literally described, at that time which
is called the last judgment ; and accordingly not only
that the sun and moon shall be darkened, and the stars
fall from heaven, the sign of the Lord appear in heaven,
and that they shall see him in the clouds, and with him
his angels with trumpets ; but also, according to pre
dictions of like sound in other parts of the sacred writ
ings, that the whole visible world shall perish, and be
succeeded by a new heaven and a new earth ; and this
is the general belief' of Christians at this time : but all
such are strangers to the interior of the scriptures,
which have a hidden sense throughout, holding forth to
us things spiritual and heavenly, by such as are natural
and mundane in the expression of the letter, and this
not only in sentences taken collectively, but also in eve
ry particular word :
(3) for the scriptures are written
entirely according to correspondences, (4) in order to
represent to us inward and spiritual things, by such as
are outward and natural, as will evidently appear by what
is delivered and shewed in many places concerning this
inWard sense, in a work entitled Arcana Ccelestia, and
also by a collection ofinstancesof this kind taken thence,
in a small Treatise, De Equo Albo i or Of the White

whole of the scriptures, see n. 1 143, 1984, 2135, &c. 9063, 9086.

ces, and that spiritual things are therein signified throughout, n.

this sense, we are to understand the things of which our
Lord speaks, in the place before cited, concerning his
coming in the clouds of heaven ; viz. by the sun there
being darkened, is signified the Lord in regafd to love;
(5) by the moon, the Lord with respect to faith; (6)
by stars, the knowledges of goodness and truth, orlove
and faith ; (7) by the sign of the Son of Man in heaven,
the manifestation of divine truth; by the tribes of the

of our Lord, that at the consummation of the age, or
end of the church period, when there shall no longer be
Faith and Charity on earth, that the Lord will open the
scriptures in their spiritual sense, and reveal the hea

44 A treatise concerning
church now o'days hardly knows any thing of, though
described in the written word ; nay, many who were
born and live within the pale of it deny them, saying in
their hearts, Who ever came from thence to shew us of
these things : lest therefore the like incredulity, which
chiefly reigns among the learned and worldly wise,
should infect the simple in heart, and the simple in faith,
it has been granted me to associate with angels, and to
converse with them, as man does with man; and also to
see the things that are in the heavens and in the hells,
and this now for thirteen years together ; and also
now to describe the things so seen and heard, in
order that hereby the minds of the ignorant may be
enlightened, and an end put to incredulity. The reason
why such immediate revelation exists at this day, is
because that is what is meant by the coming of the
Lord.
THAT THE LORD IS THE GOD OF HEAVEN.
2. THE first and principal thing to know
is,
who
is
the God of heaven, as all other things depend thereon
;
how throughout the universal heaven no other
is
acknow
ledged for the God of heaven, but the Lord alone
:
it
is
there confessed by all, as he himself taught on earth,
that he
is
" One with the Father ;" that " the Father
is
in him, and he in the Father ;" and that " he who seeth
"him, seeth the Father;" and that " all holiness pro-
" ceeds from him," John x. 30, 38. ch. xiv. 10, 11.
ch. xvi. 13, 14, 15.
I
have frequently discoursed with
the angels on this subject
;
and they constantly affirm
ed, that they knew not how to divide the Godhead into
three, inasmuch as they know and perceive that
it
is
one,
and that in the Lord
:
moreover, they said, that such of
the church as passed from this world into' the other with
the idea of three Deities in their minds, cannot be ad
mitted into heaven, their thoughts being distracted, as
it
were, between one God and another
;
whereas
it
is
contrary to the laws
of'
the kingdom to believe

.and confess but one ; (13) for in heaven every one de
clares his real sentiments, language there being the ex
pression of the mind, or as thinking audibly ; and there
fore there is no admittance for such as have formed their
ideas of the Godhead according to such a threefold divi
sion and separation, without concentrating them into one
in our Lord ; besides, as among the angels there is a
communication of their thoughts, should any one, whose
belief and confession were so contradictory, come among
them, he would immediately be discovered, and ex
pelled from their society : let it be noted, however, that
all those, who in their life-time here did not separate
between truth and goodness, or faith and love, do in the
other world, under the instruction of the angels, (
'
what
ever mistakes the}) may have innocently imbibed hereJ
readily receive the true and heavenly doctrine of our
Lord being the God of the universe : but it is otherwise
with those, who, in this state of mortality, separated be
tween faith and good life, or, in other words, whose
practice was not according to true faith.
3. They who in life (though outwardly professing
members of the church) did not believe in our Lord, but
ih the Father only, and confirmed themselves by argu
ments in such their unbelief, find no place in heaven «
and forasmuch as they are without all Influx from hea
ven, where the Lord only is worshipped, they are gra
dually divested of the faculty of thinking rightly on any
subject, and at length either become like mutes, or else
talk foolishly \ moping about with their arms hanging
dangling down before them, like paralytics or ideots.
They who have openly denied the Divinity of our Lord,
believing only in his human nature, as do the Socinians;

carried forward a little towards the right, (*) are let

46" A treatise concerning
down into a deep pit, and so separated from the rest
that come from the Christian world ; but as to such as
profess to believe in an unmanifested Divinity, which
they call the Great Being, or Spirit of the Universe,
from which all things pi oceeded, and renounce all faith
in the Lord ; these, on examination, are found to believe
in no God, forasmuch as their unmanifested Deity, or
tinkrtown God,
is,
according to their creed, no other
than
a
mysterious something like nature in its first
forms, which as they have no conception of
it,
(14) can
not be any object of faith or love to them
;
these have
their lot amongst those who are called Naturalists. The
case
is
different with those that are born without the
church, and are called Heathens, of whom we shall
speak hereafter.
4. All infants, which constitute
a
third part of the
Society in heaven, are initiated in the doctrine and faith
of our Lord being their Father, and afterwards of his
being Lord of all, and consequently the God of heaven
and earth. That they increase in stature and knowledge,
even to angelical understanding and wisdom, will be
shewed
in
what follows
5. That the Lord
is
the God of heaven will admit of
no doubt with those that are true members of the
church, as he himself hath told us
;
" All things that the
" Father hath are mine.''—"All power
is
given unto
" me in heaven and earth." Matt. xi. 27. John xvi. 15.
xvii. 2. Matt, xxviii. 18.
It
is
said " in heaven and in
earth," for he who governs heaven, governs the earth
also, as the latter

him all the good of love, and all the true of faith, conse
quently all understanding, wisdom, and happiness, and,
to sum up all, eternal life, according to that declaration
of our Lord, " He that believeth on the Son, hath

" not see life," John hi. 36. And elsewhere :
" I am the

6. There were certain spirits, who, whilst they lived
in the body, professed only faith in the Father, without
having any other idea of our Lord than as of another
man, and consequently did not believe in him as the
God of heaven ; wherefore they had leave to go about
and inquire as they would, whether there were any other
heaven than that of our Lord j but after continuing their
inquiry for some days, they could procure no infor
mation of any other. They were of that class, who sup
pose the happiness of heaven to consist in pomp and do
minion ; and because they could not obtain their wishes,
but were told, that the joys of heaven did not consist in
such things, they were highly displeased, as not desiring
any other heaven than wherein they might domineer over
others in a pre-eminence, after the fashion of this
world.

48 A treatise concerning
and received by the angels, does really constitute it es-.
sentially, both in general, and also in its particular dis
tinctions ; now this Divine Influence proceeding from
the Lord, is the Good of Love, and the True of Faith,
and according to the measure of their recipiency of these
from him, in such degree is the excellence of their an
gelical nature, and so far do they constitute the forms of
their respective heave-ns.
8. Every angel throughout the heavens knows, and
intimately perceives, that he cannot will and do any
good, nor think and b lieve any truth, from mere self,
but only from the divine Influx, and consequently from
the Lord ; and that whatever of good and true they do
and think from themselves, are only apparently, not
really so, forasmuch as they have in them no principle
of divine life that they can call their own. The angels
of the inmost or highest heaven have a clear perception,
and also a sensation of this influx, and in proportion
thereto is there degree of bliss, which consists in love
and light [wisdom] ; and as these are derived from the
Lord's Divinity, it is evident that this constitutes heaven,
and not any thing proceeding from the nature of angels,
as of themselves. (16) Hence it is that heaven is called
in scripture his Dwelling and Throne, and that the
blessed inhabitants of it are therein said to be in the
Lord. (17) How heaven is replenished with divine
virtue proceeding from him will be explained in what
follows.
(16) That the angels of heaven acknowledge all good to be from
the Lord, and nothing of it from self, and that the Lord dwells with
them, though in his own divine principles, and not in any thing that
is proper to them, or which they can call their own, n. 9338, 10125,
10151, 10157. And that therefore, an the Word, by angels is un
derstood some attribute of the Lord, n. 1925, 2821 —8192, 10528 :
and they are also sometimes called gods, from the indwelling of the
divinity in them, n. 4295,4402, 8301, 8192. .That also all good and
all truth, essentially such, consequently, all peace, love, charity, and
faith, arc only from the Lord, n. 1614,2016 —2892, 2904: as like,

9. The angels go still farther in this matter, affirming
from the wisdom that is in them, that not onlv all good
ness and truth, but likewise the whole of life proceed
from the Lord by way of continual emanation, confirm
ing their position by this argument, viz. That nothing
can exist from itself, but from some prior cause, and all
things from the first cause, which they call the original
Essence of the life of all things ; and that they subsist
in like manner, as subsistence is no other than a contin
uation of existence, and whatever loses its connexion
with the first cause, through the intermediate links, must
lose its existence : as then there is but one fountain
of life, and man subsists only as a stream issuing there
from, consequently, should the communication cease, so
also must his life. Morever, they affirm that as from
.this one only fountain (the Lord) of life proceed divine
goodness and truth, so do they operate in every one ac
cording to the reception of them ; they who receive
them into their faith and life, in such they constitute
heaven ; but they who reject or pervert them, convert
good into evil, and truth into error*, and so they be
come hell to them. They farther establish this truth by
the following argument, viz. That all things in the uni
verse have some relation to goodness and truth, the
life of man's will (which is that of his love) to the for
mer, and man's intellectual life (which is that of his faith)
to the latter : now as all goodness and truth comes from
above, so docs also every vital principle in man : this
being the creed of angels, they of consequence reject all
gratitude and thanks directed to them, even for their
most beneficient ministrations, and are highly displeas
ed, and withdraw themselves, when any one ascribes
good to them as the auihors of it; nay, they are astonish
ed to think that any one should be so besotted, as to
imagine that he can be wise, or do any good from him-
self; nor do they call that good, which has self for its

50 A treatise concerning
end, but that alone which is done from a disinterested
love of goodness, this they call good from the divine
fountain, and the principle that constitutes heaven, as
having the Lord for its essence and root. (18)
10. There are certain spirits, who, in the body, had
confirmed themselves in this faith, that the good which
they did, and the truths which they believe, were from
themselves, and as such to be appropriated to them :
of this class are all they who place merit in their good
works, and value themselves on their own fancied righ-
teousness : such havejno admittance into heaven, for the
angels shun their company, and look upon them either
as stupid, or as thieves; as stupid, because they set them
selves, and not the Lord, always before them ; as
thieves, because they rob him of the honour that belongs
to him : all such are professedly enemies to the assur
ance of faith that obtains among the saints above, viz.
That Divine Virtue, proceeding from the Lord alone,
and received by the angels, constitutes both the sanctity
and happiness of heaven.
11. That they who are in heaven, and also they who
are true members of the church on earth, are in the
Lord, and the Lord in them, appears from his owtt
words :
" Abide in me, and I in you : as the branch can*
" not bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no
" more can ye except ye abide in me : I am the vine, ye
" are the branches : he that abideth in me, and I in him,
** the same bringeth forth much fruit ; for without me ye
" can do nothing." John xv. 4.-T-7.
12. Hence it may appear, that the Lord is with the
angels in his own Divine essence, and is AH in All in hea
ven, because the Good that is there is from him, and
what proceeds from his Divine Nature is properly him
self, and constitutes heaven, and not any thing that be
longs to the angels as their proper own.

nature of the Lord, but not the good that is from themselves, n.

Heaven and Hell. 5 1
THAT THE DIVINE INFLUX OP THE LORD IN
HEAVEN PRODUCES LOVE TO HIM AND CHAR
ITY TO ONE ANOTHER.
13. THE Divine Efflux emanating from the Lord is
called in heaven Divine Truth on the following account :
it issues from his Divine Love ; and this divine love and
divine truth are to each other as the heat and light of the
sun in our world, love being expressed and signified by
the former, and truth proceeding from it (19) by the
latter, and this by the law of correspondence : so then
Divine Love is the essence,and Divine Truth is the form,
and thus united they enliven all things in heaven, as the
heat and light of our sun, in conjunction, fructify the
the earth in the spring and summer season : but it is
otherwise where they are not united, or the light not
sufficiently impregnated with heat, for then all is benum
bed and lifeless. This divine good, which is represented
by heat, is the good of love in the angels, and divine
truth is that through and by which it operates and is
manifested.
14. That the divine virtue which constitutes the na
ture of heaven is Love, is because love is a principle of
spiritual Union, and joins the angels to the Lord, and to
one another, insomuch that they are but as one in his
sight : besides, love is the very Essence to every life,
and consequently both to mes and angels : and this an
swers to experience, for how is every one animated and
warmed by the fire oflove ! how languid and cold under
the absence of it ! and how lifeless under the total priva
tion of it! (20) But it must be remembered by the way,
that the life of every one corresponds to the particular
kind of love that actuates him.

4906, 5215. That the holy and celestial (ire sginifies divine love, and

52 A treatise concerning
15. Therfc are two distinct kinds of love that more
particularly -actuate theangels in heaven, love to the Lord,
and love to their neighbour; in the inmost or highest
heaven the former has the ascendant ; in the second or
middle heaven, the latter, yet both proceeding from the
Lord, and constituting their heavens respectively ; how
both these kinds of love operate distinctly, and how
jointly, is clearly discerned in the light of heaven, but
obscurely in this world. By love towards the Lord, in
heaven, they do not mean the love of him in a personal
consideration of the world, but to love the good that
proceeds from him, and this is evidenced by the wil
ling and doing good from the principle of love : and by
the love of their neighbour, they do not mean merely a
personal love of their fellows, but the love of truth pro
ceeding from the Divine Word, manifesting itself in wil-
ling and acting according to truth in its several relations ;
hence it is evident, that these two loves are to be distin- .
guished as goodness and truth separately considered, and
when conjointd, as goodness united with truth, (21)
But these things are of difficult comprehension by those
who have not clear ideas of what is meant by love, by
good, and by neighbour. (22)
16. I have sometimes conversed with the angels on
this subject, who seemed to wonder that any in the
Christian church should not know, that to love the Lord,
and their neighbour, is to love goodness and truth, and
to practice them from inclination ; when they may so
easily know, that every one testifies the sincerity of his
love for another, by a ready compliance with his will,
and that this alone is the bond and cement of mutual
(21) That to love the Lord and our neighbour, is to keep the
divine commandments, n. 10143, 10153, 10310, 10578, 10648.
(22) By love to our neighbour, we are not to understand the love
of his person, but the good and the true which constitutes his char
acter, n. 5025, 10336. They who confine their love to the person,
without regard to his principles, love equally the evil and the good
that is in him, n. 3820. That charity is to will and be well affected
to the truth for its own sake, n. 3876, 3877. That charity towards
our neighbour, is to do what is good just, and right, in every relation
we stand to him n. 8120, 8121, 8122.

love among men ; as also that good proceeding from the
Lord must be like him, as having his nature in it ; and
consequently that they are in his image and likeness,
whose lives are formed on principles of goodness and
truth, by wiil and practice : for to will a thing, is to love
to do it,according to those words of our Lord
;
"He
" that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he
it
"
is
that Inveth me
r
and he that loveth me, shall be loved
" of my Father, and
I
will love him, and will manifest
" myself to him, and we will make our abode with him."
John xiv. 21, 23. ch. xv. 10, 12
:
and elsewhere.
17. That the virtue proceeding from the Lord, which
influences the angels, and constitutes heaven,
is
Love,
is
confirmed by the experience of all in heaven; for all
there are so many forms of love and charity, and appear
in
beauty beyond description ; for their looks, their
speech, their very action, (23) are so many expressions
of love
:
moreover, there are certain spiritual spheres
which issue from and surround every angel, and spirit,
which make known by sensible evidence (and that
sometimes to
a
considerable distance) the kinds and de
grees- of their particular affections
;
for their spheres are
so many emanations from their vital affections, and the
sentiments they produce, or,
in
i^ther words, from the
life of their love and faith
:
the spheres thus exhaling
from the angels, are so replete with love, that they sen
sibly affect the spirits that are in company with them.
I
myself at times have been so affected by them. (24)
That love
is
the predominant principle in the life of an
gels,
is
manifest also from hence, that in the other world
every one turns his face to the object of his love
;
so
they who are principled in love towards the Lord, and
towards their neighbour, have their faces always turned

5+ A treatise concerning
towards the Lord ; whereas they who are in the love of
self, have their faces always turned from him, whatever
be the movements of their bodies ; for as in the other
world, space corresponds to the inward state of spiritu
al beings respectively, so also the four quarters of the
heavens (which have not their fixed determinations there
as in this world) are determined with reference to the
aspect of the spectators respectively. (*) It is here to be
noted, that it is not by any virtue or power in the angels
of themselves, that they always turn their faces to the
Lord, but by a holy instinctive power derived from him
in those who love to obey his will ;
(25) but more of
this hereafter, where we shall speak of the four quarters
of the heavens in the other world.
18. That the divine influencing virtue of the Lord in
heaven is love, is because love is recipient of all things
proper to heaven, as peace, understanding, wisdom, and
happiness ; for love attracts to itself whatever is conge
nial to
it,
as by
a
natural instinct, for they are its riches
and perfection
:
(26) and this we all can witness to, as
knowing how love in ourselves ransacks whatever
is
laid
up in the memory, and takes to itself whatever
it
there
finds suitable to itself, which
it
disposes of in subservi-
{*) This will be further explained in the sequel of this work,
and may be understood thus
:
As the Lord has his personal mani
festation in heaven, always in the East, according to what our Au
thor relates, the angels and angelical spirits, which way soever they
turn themselves, front always to the East, and so have the Lord
al
ways before them. Quere, Ifthe belief of this among Christians in
early days of the church, however they might come by it, did not
first give occasion to the custom of turning to the East on repeating
the creed! Tr.

•ncy to its gratification and end, rejecting and banishing
ajl that is contrary to it. That there is inherent in love
a strong attractive power, with the desire of appropriat
ing to itself such truths as accord with its nature, I hod
full experience of in certain spirits that were translated
to heaven, who, though of great simplicity, and but of
moderate capacity whilst in this world, presently, upon
their admission into the society of angels, attained to an-
gelical wisdom, and the refined enjoyments oftheir king
dom; and that, because they loved goodness and truth
as such, and had, as it were, incorporated them into the
very principles of life, whereby they 'became qualified
for the immediate reception of the celestial treasures :
but as to those, who in this life had immerged them
selves, in the love of self and the world, they are so far
from being receptive of them, that they have an antipa
thy to them, and so rejecting them upon the first sensa
tions of them, they immediately assimilate in fellowship
with such of the infernals, whose affections accord with
their own. There were* certain spirits, who doubted of
the beatitudes of celestial love, and therefore were desi
rous of being certified concerning the reality of this mat
ter; wherefore they were permitted to be let into the state
of it by the removal of that which disqualified for it,and
accordingly they were conducted on to the angelical
heaven, from whence they told me, that they felt an in
ward joy, which they could not express, lamenting at
the same time, that they must return to their former con
dition. Others also were as highly exalted to the parti
cipation of heavenly light, as their interior capacity
would admit
;
(*) and confessed that they understood
and perceived things that before were utterly incom
prehensible by them. Let thus much suffice to shew, that
love proceeding from the Lord
is
the only proper dispo
sition for, and recipient oi heaven, and all things proper
to it.

neighbour, comprehend all divine truths,

from the following words of our Lord concerning these
two loves :
" Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with

" thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : on these two

THAT HEAVEN IS DIVIDED INTO TWO KING
DOMS.
20. INASMUCH as there arc infinite varieties iu
heaven, and no one society, nor indeed any one angel,
exactly like another, (27) therefore heaven is to be con,
sidered under the threefold distinction ofgeneral, speci
al, and particular : in general, into two kingdoms; speci
fically, into three heavens ; and in particular, into innu
merable societies : to each of which shall be spoken in
what follows; they are called Kingdoms, because hea
ven is called the Kingdom of God.
21. Some angels receive the divine Influx more deep
ly or interiorly, other less ; the former are called Celesti
al angels, the latter, Spiritual angels : hence it is that
heaven is divided into two kingdoms, whereof the one
is called the Celestial kingdom, the other the Spiritual
kingom. (28)
(27) That there is an infinite variety in the works of God, and no
one thing exactly like another, n. 7236, 9002. That there is also an
infinite variety in the heavens, n. 684, 690, 3744, 5598, 7236. That
the varieties in heaven are in the principle of good, n. 374, 4005 —

angel in each society, have some distinguishing characteristic, n,

in the mystical body of Christ, and, as suoii, united to the Lord, n.

22. 'Hie angels which constitute the celestial king
dom, inasmuch as they receive the Divine Efflux from
the Lord more inwardly, are called interior, and also su
perior angels, from whom the heavens which they consti
tute derive the same distinctions ; (29) superior and in
ferior answering to interior and exterior. (30)
23. The love principle in the celestial angels is call
ed Celestial Love ; and that of the spiritual angels, Spi
ritual Love ; celestial love has the Lord for its object,
and spiritual love is the same with charity towards our
neighbour ; and as all good has relation to love, for what
ever any one loves, that is good to him ; therefore the
good of one kingdom is called celestial, and that of the
other spiritual good ; hence it appears in what respects
these two kingdoms differ, viz. as the good of love to
wards the Lord, and the good of charity towards our
neighbour i (31) and as the former is more inward or
deeper than the latter, therefore the celestial angels are
more interior, and as such called superior.
24. The celestial kingdom is also called the sacerdotal
kingdom of the Lord, and in scripture his dwelling-place;
and the spiritual his regal kingdom, and in scripture his
throne ; from the divine celestial principle the Lord is

love to the Lord, they are consequently more closely
joined to him. (32) This higher excellence of the an
gels of this kingdom, is owing to their reception of di
vine truth immediately into the principle of life, and not
as the spiritual angels, through the previous instrumen
tality of memory and reflection; insomuch that divine
verities are written in their hearts, and they see them by
intuition with themselves, as in a kind of source, with
out haviiig any occasion to reason concerning them,
whether the matter be so or otherwise :
(33) like unto
those described by Jeremiah; " I will put my law in
" their inward parts, and write it in their hearts ; and
" they shall no more teach every man his neighbour,
" and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord ;
" for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto
" the greatest of them," xxxi. 33. 34. And they are
called in Isaiah. " The taught of Jehovah" liv. 13.
Now that the taught ofJehovah, arc the taught of the
Lord, he himself declares, John vi. 45, 46.
26. We have said, that they excel the other angels in
wisdom and glory, as receiving divine truths immedi
ately in their life -principle ; (*) for as soon as they hear
them, they immediately will and do them, without hav
ing any occasion to lay them up in their memory to re
flect and reason upon, in order to know whether such
things be true or not ; for they who are of this kingdom,
know immediately by Influx (inspiration) from the Lord
whether that which they hear be true or not, as this Influx
passes immediately into the will, and mediately through

immediately into the good [bonum,] and mediately
through the good into the true {verum ;] (34) for that is
called good which appertains to the will, and thence
proceeds to work ; and that true, which appertains to
the memory, and thence proceeds to thought and reflec
tion : so likewise all true [omne verum] (*) becomes
good, as being implanted in the love- principle, as soon
as it enters into the will ; but so long as it rests only in
the memory, and thence in the thoughts, it is not called
good, as not having life, or the force of a principle, nei
ther is it appropriated to man, seeing that man has his
denomination from the will and intellect thence pro
ceeding, and not from intellect seperate from the will.

(*) The over-delicate and critical reader will likely take offence
at the words good and true being so often introduced in this transla

language, though it is" far from being ungrammatical in the Latin:

nor sense of the author could have been preserved without

as
goodness and truth in the abstract and universal, would not have an

cularize the kind or quality of what

and also the particular divisions that come under their several de
nominations
:
so also, the true of faith, the true of knowledge, the
true of history, &c. specify the particular quality -or quantity of
truth that result from those kinds of evidence respectively
;

a
little familarity with the senfe

6*0 A treatise concerning

the angels of the celestial, and those of the spiritual
kingdom, therefore they are separate, and form different
societies, though there is a communication between them,
by means of certain intermediate angelical societies call
ed Celestial-Spiritual, through which the celestial king
dom operates by Influx on the spiritual kingdom: (36)
hence it is, that though heaven (in the complex sense of
the word) be distinguished as two kingdoms, yet in effect
they may be considered as one, forasmuch as the Lord
has established an order of such intermediate angels, for
the sake of forming a communication and conjunction
between them.
28. As much is spoken in the following work con
cerning the angels of both these kingdoms, we forbear to
be more particular on the subject in this place.
THAT THERE ARE THREE HEAVENS.*
29. THERE are three heavens, and they intirely dis
tinct from each other ; the highest or inmost, called the
third heaven ; the middle or second ; and the lowest or
first heaven ; and they rank in order, like the supreme in

beloved and esteemed according to the goodness of his will, and not
that of his understanding, nay, that he is despised who has an evil
will, however great his share of understanding, n. 8911, 10076.
That man continues after death according to the state of his will
and intellect from thence, and that those things which are only
ideally in his understanding, without any share of the will in them,
vanish at his death, as constituting no part of the man, n. 9069, 907 1,

man, called the head, the middle called the body, and
the lowest or feet ; or as the uppermost, middle, and
lowest apartments in a house : in like order is the Di
vine Influx proceeding and descending from the Lord ~
and from the same law of order it follows, that heaven is
tripartite, or divided into three.
30. The interior of man, as his understanding and
mind, subsists in like manner; and consists of inmost,
middle, and lowest; for at the creation the whole of divine
order was imaged in man, insomuch that he was divine
order itself in a human form, and so heaven in epitomy :
(37) therefore it
is,
that man
is
capable of communica
tion with the heavens, as to his interiors and of associat
ing with angels after death, either with the angels of the
highest (inmost), middle, or lowest heaven, according to
divided into three distinct heavens, and but two kingdoms, the
kingdoms called the celestial and spiritual, and answering to the
properties or principles of love and intellect, or goodness and truth
(as being the predominant attributes in the angels of those king
doms) yet we are not therefore to understand, that the angels of the
third heaven [paradise] are not highly tinctured with these divine
qualities, (for they receive both
by
influx through the superior hea
vens) but only that these are not their distinguishing characteris
tics
:
they partake of both, otherwise they could not be angels; but
their beautitudes consist chiefly in
a
kind of spiritual gratifications
more exterior, and approaching nearer to sense and external na
ture; as in emblematical representations of divine and spiritual
things, under forms of exquisite beauty in endless varieties, and
successions of wonderful displays of divine wisdom and power; and
though their enjoyments be less inward and refined than those of
more exalted spirits, yet they are abundantly suited to the capaci
ties of their nature, and to fill them with joy and gratitude to the
gracious Author of their happiness. It
is
to be noted, that (is
omne majus continet minus, so) the superior angels enjoy the sum
total of the felicity of the inferior angels, together with tther su-
pereminent beautitudes appropriated to their ranks in glory respec
tively. Tr»

62 A treatise coiicerning
his reception of the divine goodness and truth from the
Lord, during his life in this world.
31. The Divine Influx from the Lord, as received in
the third or inmost heaven, is called Celestial, as are like
wise the angels of that heaven : the same Divine Influx,
as received in the second or middle heaven, is called
Spiritual, as also are the angels of the same heaven, and
as it is received in the lowest or first heaven, it is called
Natural ; but it must be noted, that as what is called the
natural of this heaven is very different from the natural
ofthis our world, as the former partakes both of the spi
ritual and celestial properties, therefore this heaven is
called the Spiritual and Celestial-Natural, and its angels
likewise :
(38) such of its angels as are called Spiritual-
Natural, are they who receive their Influx from the
middle or second, which is also the Spiritual heaven ; as
they are called the Celestial-Natural, who receive their
Influx from the third or inmost, which is also the Celes
tial heaven ; though the angels called Spiritual Natural,
and those called Celestial-Natural, are different demina-
tions and orders, yet they both constitute but one hea
ven, as being in the same degree of bliss.
32. The distinction of internal and external takes
place in each heaven : they who are in the internal are
called Interior angels, as they who are in the external are
called Exterior angels. External and internal in the hea
vens answer to the will-part, and to the intellectual part
in man, internal to the will, and external to the intellect;
every Will hath its proper Intellect ; the one is never
without the other ; the former may be compared to a
flame, the latter to its light.
33. It is well to be remembered, that the interior
state of the angels is that which determines their being
of this or that heaven, for the more open their interior is
(38) That there arc three heavens, the highest or inmost, the
middle, and the lowest ; or the third, second, and first, n. 684, 8594,

and degree, n. 4938 —100 1 7. That the good of the inmost or third
heaven, is called Celestial ; the good of the middle or second, Spiri
tual ; and that of the lowest or first, Spiritual-Natural ; n. 4279,

to the Lord, the more interior is' the heaven they belong
to. There are three degrees of the interior in every An
gel, Spirit, and Man ; they in whom the third degree is
opened, are in the inmost heaven ; and they in whom
only the second or first, are in the middle or lowest hea
ven accordingly. The interior is opened according to
the reception of divine goodness and truth in the inward
parts ; they who are so affected with divine truths, as to
receive them into the life principle or will, so that they
become operative, are in the inmost or third heaven, and
there in rank according to the degree of their affection
for truth ; but they who give them not so immediate an
admission into the will, but only into their memory and
understanding, and afterwards frame their will accord
ing thereto, and then to proceed to act ; these are in the
middle or second heaven : but they who add to their
faith good life, though without any extraordinary earn
estness and sedulity after divine knowledge; they are in
the lowest or first heaven. (39) Hence it is manifest,
that it is the interior or inward disposition that consti
tutes heaven, and consequently that heaven is something
internal, and not external, according to those words of
our Lord : "The kingdom of God cometh not with obser-
" vation ; neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there !
" for behold the kingdom of God is within you." Luke
" xvii. 20, 21.
34. Every human perfection [virtue and grace] in
creases towards the interior of man, as being nearer to
Deity, and purei in itself, but decreases towards the ex
terior, as this is more remote from the Deity, and more
gross in itself. (40) Angelical perfection consists in Un
derstanding, Wisdom, Love, and in every Good, and in

84 A treatise concerning
Happiness- from them; for without them, happiness is
merely external, and not internal. Forasmuch as the
interior [the inward dispositions and properties] of the
angels of the inmost heaven, are open in the third de
gree, therefore their perfection is of a far higher nature
than that of the angels of the middle heaven, whose in
terior is open only in the second degree : in like pro
portion the perfection of the angels of the middle heaven
exceeds that of the angels of the lowest heaven.
35. Such being the difference between the angels, it
follows, that the angels of one heaven cannot find admis
sion into the heaven of other angels, or any of them as
cend from an inferior, or descend from a superior hea
ven ; for should any of them ascend to a higher heaven,
he would immediately be seized with anguish, neither
would he be able to sec any of it's inhabitants, much less
to converse with them; and he who should descend from
a superior to a lower heaven, would lose his wisdom,
stammer in his speech, and be in the greatest distress.
Certain angels which belonged to the lowest heaven, and
had not yet learned that heaven was a state adapted to
the interior, imagined that they should partake of the su
perior happiness of the celestial angels, could they be ad
mitted into their heaven ; accordingly this was permit
ted, but when they were there, they could not see so
much as one angel, though they looked about for them,
and notwithstanding a multitude of them was present;
for the interior of these strangers was not opened in the
same degree with the interior of the celestial ange'.s, nor
consequently their sight : and presently after they were
seized with a heart-felt anguish, so that they scarcely
knew whether they were alive or not; wherefore they
immediately betook themselves to their own proper hea
ven, rejoicing that they were got again among their own
companions, and promising that that they would no

discordant to the condition of their nature. (*) Som»
others I saw, who had descended from a superior to an
inferior heaven, and became for a time so confused and
lost to their wisdom, that they scarcely knew what hea
ven they belonged to. The case is quite otherwise when*
the Lord is pleased to exalt any from an inferior to a su
perior heaven, to shew them the glories of the latter,
Which often happens, for then they are first prepared, and
surrounded with the intermediate angels, through whom
they enjoy the communication with their superiors.
From what has been already related, it appears that
the three heavens are intirely distinct one from the
other.

with all that are there ; but the delights of their associ
ation are in proportion to the similarity Of their affections
and affinity in good : but concerning these, in the fol
lowing articles.

gels of one heaven cannot associate with the angels of
another, yet the Lord connects them ail by Influx im
mediate and mediate ; by immediate Influx, from him
self into all the three heavens; and by mediate Influx,

connected ; for were any thing to lose its connection by

'
38.s He, who has no idea of divine order in respect to
degrees, cannot form any conception how the heavens
are distinct, nor yet what is meant by the inward and out
ward man ; nor have the greater part any other noti on of
interior and exterior, or superior and inferior in this re
spect, than as something cohering by continuity from a
higher to a lower degree of purity ; whereas things inte
rior and exterior, as here treated of, proceed not by the
rule of Continuum, so called, but the rule calledDis-
crete.* Degrees are of two kinds continuous and
discontinuous or discrete ; the former are as the degrees
of light decreasing on to obscurity, or as the different
degrees of purity between the upper and lower regions
of the atmosphere ; and these degrees are determined by
the distances respectively. Degrees that are not conti
nuous, but discrete, are distinguished from the former,
as prior from posterior, as cause from effect, and as what
produces from the production. He that closely attends
to this matter will find, that in all things throughout the
universe, things are so ordered in the productions and
compositions, that any one thing proceeds from another,
and that from a third, and so on ; and he that has no per

6056.
* It will be somewhat difficult for a common reader, rightly to
apprehend our Author's meaning in this section ; and yet a very
important meaning belongs to
it,
and in particular, as
it
detects the
gross error of those who assert the materiality of the soul, affirming
it to be homogeneous, and continuous with the body
;
whereas
it

heterogenous, and discrete. A continuum, or continued quantity, is

ception of these degrees of order, can have no idea of
the distinction of the heavens, nor of the distinct facul
ties of the interior and exterior of man, neither of the
difference betwixt the Spiritual and Natural world, nor
yet between the Spirit and Body of man, and conse
quently can know nothing of correspondences, and em
blematical representations, nor ofthe important doctrine
of Influx. Mere sensual men cannot receive these dis
tinctions, making nothing more of them than higher or
lower in their scale of the degrees of continuity ; and
therefore have no other conception of what is spiritual,
than as something natural in a more refined degree ;
thus they are quite beside the mark, and far from all true
understanding of the matter. (43)
39. Lastly, I find myself here at liberty to mention a
certain secret concerning the angels of the three heavens
which is intirely unknown to every one, through ignor
ance as to the degrees here spoken of, viz. That there
is in every angel, and also in every man, a certain inmost
or su preme degree or part, which is the immediate sub
ject of the Divine Influx, from whence the Lord regu
lates and governs their other interior faculties and pow
ers successively, according to their degrees of order ;
this inmost or supreme part may be called the Lord's
entrance into angel or man, and his dwelling-pUce in
them : it is also by this inmost or supreme part in man,
that hi has his particular denomination, and is distin
guished from the brute animals, for they have it not ;
and hence it is the peculiaf privilege of man above other
animals, that, with respect to the interior faculties of his
soul and spirit, he is capable of being raised by the Lord

but distinct and discrete according to their respective degrees, and,
that every degree has its termination or limit, n. 3691, 4145, 5114,

that the things so formed are not more pure or more gross, accord-,

up to himself; that he can believe in him, be affected
with love towards him, and so see him ; as also that he
is suscej>table of understanding and wisdom, and can
converse rationally ; and hence likewise he has the pri
vilege of eternal life : but how or what the Lord ope
rates in this supreme part of the soul, which communi
cates with his Divinity, is not clearly known even to the
angels, as being above their thoughts and highest wis-
dom.
40. So much for these general truths concerning the
three heavens : in what follows we shall speak of each
heaven in particular.
THAT THE HEAVENS CONSIST OF INNUMERA-
ABLE SOCIETIES.
41. THE angels of each heaven are not all together,
but are divided into Societies, greater or smaller, ac
cording to their degrees of difference with respect to the
good of love and faith : they who are in the like good,
and also degree of
it,
form one and the same society: the
goods [species or kinds of good] in the* heavens are of
infinite variety
;
and every angel
is
to himself the condi
tion or quality of his own good. (44)
42. The angelical societies
in
the heavens have also
their distances one from another, according to their dif
ferent kinds of good, both in general and
in
particular
;
(44) That there
is
an infinite variety
in
the works of Cod, nrrd no
one thing exactly like another in all respects, n. 7236, 9002. That
there
is
the same infinite variety in the heavens, n. 685, 690, 3744,
5598, 7236. That the varieties in the heavens, which are infinite,
are varieties in good, n. 3744, 5598 —7836, 9002. That these varie
ties exist in the multifarious forms of truth, which specificate in
every one the different kinds and degrees of good, n. 3470, 3804—
7236. Whence
it
is, that not only every Society in the heavens,
but every Angel in each Society, have their particular distinction,
n. 690, 3241 —7236, 7833, 7836. But notwithstanding, that they all
act consentaneously to the good of the whole by one principle of
love from the Lord,

for distances in the spiritual world are determined by the
difference of the interior states, and consequently in the
heavens by the difference of the states with respect to
loVe : they are at the greatest distance which differ most
herein, and they at the least who differ least ; whereas
similitude of degree in this property connects them in
the same Society. (45)
43. All likewise in the same society have their parti
cular distinctions of place ; they who are more perfect,
or excel in good, in love, in understanding, and in wis
dom, have their stations in or nearer to the centre; and
they who are less perfect, round about them, according
to their different degrees of perfection; in which respect
they may be compared to light, decreasing in proportion
to its distance from its center or luminous body ; so they,
who are in the middle, are in the greatest light; they,
who are at the circumference, in the least ; and others
according to their respective distances.
44. The angels, who are of a similar disposition or
interior, come together as by sympathy ; for with their
fellows they are as at home with their friends, and with
others as abroad and with strangers: also in company
with the former they enjoy freedom of spirit, and conse
quently the true relish oflife.
45. Hence it apj>ears, that good is the bond ofsociety
in the heavens, and that the angels are of a distinct so
cieties, according to the kind or quality of their good
[secundum ejus quale ;] however, it is the Lord, from
whom all good comes, that forms them into Societies,
and not the angels themselves : he it is that leads them,
joins them, distinguishes them, and preserves them in
liberty according to their degree of good, and so every
one in the life of his love, faith, understanding, and wis
dom, and thence in their proper happiness. (46)

•46. All who are in similar good, though they never
met before, know one another as well as men know their
friends and familiar acquaintance in this world, and that
because in the other life all propinquities, affinities, and
friendships, are spiritual, and stand in relation to love
and faith. (47) This I have sometimes seen myself,
when absent from the body, and in company with an
gels : at such times some of them appeared as if we
had been acquainted from our childhood, and others
as perfect strangers : now the former were in a similar
state of spirit with myself, but that of the latter was dis
similar.
47. All of the same angelical society agree in a com
mon likeness of countenance, though with a difference in
particular; now we may easily conceive of such a like
ness in common, and of such variations in particular, by
what is familiar to us in this world, it being well known,
that in every different nation respectively there is a ge
neral similitude in the features and eyes of its inhabi
tants, that distinguishes them from another country ; and
this holds true more particularly in families : but this is
much more remarkable in the Heavens, where the affec
tions of the mind are translucent through the face; for
there the countenance is the external form of the affec
tions within, and no counterfeit nor dissimulation is al
lowed of there. It was also shewed to me how the ge
neral likeness, which appears through the whole of a
Society, passes through its particular differences in the
individual members of that Society, and that under the

ance, so as to express the different affections of good
and truth that distinguished a particular Society; and
each of these variations continued for some time, so as
to give me leisure to observe, that the same common,
likeness served as the plane or ground of all the varia
tions, and that these were as so many derivations there
from; in such manner did this face represent to me the
affections of the whole Society, under their particular
differences in the individuals of it ; for, as was said be
fore, the faces of the angels are so many external forms
of their affections within, and consequently of their love
and faith.
48. Hence it follows, that any angel, who excels in
wisdom, can presently read the state of another in his
countenance, for no one there can conceal his interior
state, much less lye or deceive by craft and hypocrisy.
It sometimes happens, that hypocrites from beneath in
sinuate themselves into some angelical societies, who
have learned to conceal their interior state to the form of
good peculiar to such Societies respectively, that they
may pass for angels of light ; but such can make no long
tarrying there, for they presently begin to feel an inward
anguish and pain, to change countenance, and to be
struck in a manner lifeless, through the Influx of the
life-powers of the angels so contrary to their own; on
which they cast themselves headlong into hell among
their fellows without daring to ascend again : * these
are signified by the " man found among the guests bid-
" den to the marriage feast, not having on a wedding-
" garment, and cast into outer darkness." Matt, xxii,

That evil Spirits may sometimes lje permitted to appear
among the angels, like Satan in Paradise,
is
easy to believe
;
but this
is
no mitigation of their misery, as their hell
is
within them
:
nay,
it

72 A treatise concerning
49. All the heavenly societies communicate with one
another, but not in the way of open converse, for few
go out of their own Society to another, as such a de
parture would be like departing from themselves, or
their proper life into another, unsuitable to their nature:
but they hold communication by extending their spheres,
which proceed from their vital affections of love and
faith, f and extend themselves far to the Societies
around them, and the farther in proportion to the de
gree of their interior excellence. (48) In proportion to
this extension is the understanding and wisdom of an
gels ; they who are in the inmost Heaven, and the cen
ter thereof, extend their spheres throughout the univer
sal Heaven ; and hence there is a communication of all
heavenly things with every one, and of every one with
all. (49) But concerning this extension we shall treat
more fully in the sequel, where we speak of the celestial
form, according to which the angelical Societies are
disposed; and where we treat of the wisdom and under
standing of the angels, for all extension of the affections
and thoughts proceeds according to that form.
50. It has been observed above, that in the Heavens
there are greater and lesser Societies : the greater consist
of myriads ; the lesser, of some thousands : and the
t By faith here we ire not to understand mere believing, for
there can be no unbelievers in heaven ; but resignation, trust, reli
ance, together with a holy exercise of such of the intellectual pow
ers as have respect to the divine attributes and to divine truths. It
is here to be noted, that the Author frequently uses the word faith,
as expressive of intellect, and its object, truth ; as, on the other
hand, he uses love and will as synonymous terms, where he speaks
of the two great distinctions or principles in Men and Angels.

feast, of some hundreds of angels: there are also some
who dwell in a kind of solitude, as in single houses and
families : but though these live in so dispersed a way,
yet they are under subordination and government, a$
well as those who are in Societies, the wiser of them
being in the center as governors, and the more simple
in the circumferences : these are under the Lord's more
particular care and direction, and are the best of the
angels.
THAT EVERY ANGELICAL SOCIETY IS A HEAVEN
IN A LESSER FORM, AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL
ANGEL A HEAVEN IN THE LEAST FORM.
1
51. THAT every Society is a Heaven in a lesser
form, and every individual Angel a Heaven in the least
form, is because the good of love and faith is that which
constitutes Heaven, and is in every Society and Angel
in Heaven ; nor does it alter the matter, that the good
here spoken of is different in quality or degree in every
one, for still it is the good of Heaven, and such differ-
ence of distinction only causes it to be a Heaven of this
or that denomination or quality: and therefore it is a
common saying among them, when any one is exalted
to this or that angelical society, that he is come to hea
ven ; and, when speaking of those that are of
it,
that
they are in heaven, and every one in his own heaven
:
this
is
well known to all in the other life
;
and therefore
when any, who are out of or beneath heaven, behold
any companies of the angels afar off, they readily say,
there
is
heaven, or there
:
the case may be compared
to the officers or ministers in
a
king's palace or court,
who, though they have different apartments, one above
another, yet are all
in
the same Palace or Court, accord
ing to then* several ranks and offices; which answers to

74- A treatise concerning
read in the Prophets, of the habitations of heaveu, and
the heaven of heavens.
52. That every Angelical Society is a Heaven in a
lesser form, may also be evinced from hence; that every
•particular Society is formed after the likeness of the
whole Heaven, wherein they, who most excel, are si
tuated in the middle, and they, who are less in excel
lence, round about them, in distances proportionate to
their inferiority, as is mentioned in a preceeding article,
n. 43. This truth is farther confirmed from hence, that
thr Lord governs the Universal Heaven by the laws of an
uniform ceconomy, as if they were all but one Angel, and
consequently those in every particular Society ; » whence
it sometimes follows, that awhole Angelical Society is re
presented under the appearance of a single Angle, which
the Lord has vouchsafed to grant me the sight of. When
it pleases the Lord to manifest his personal appearance in
the midst of the Angels, he does not appear under the
particular distinction of being surrounded by many of
them, but as one of them in an Angelical form : hence
it
is,
that he
is
sometimes in Scripture called an Angel;
as
is
also
a
whole Society of them by
a
single name
;
thus Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael signify so many An
gelical Societies, deriving those names from their dif
ferent functions. (50)
53. As an intire Society
is
Heaven in
a
lesser form,
so
is
every individual Angel in its least form
;
for Hea
ven
is
not without the Angel, but within him, his inte
rior affections and powers being so disposed, according
to the form of Heaven, as to be fitted for the reception
of all external heavenly good things; his receptivity ot
which
is
according to the quality of divine good in him

54. It is by no means to be said, that Heaven is with
out any one, but within him, for it is according to the
kind or quality of the Heaven within, that every angel
receives the Heavenly Influx from without him. Hence
will appear the great error of those, who suppose that it
is sufficient, in order to be in Heaven, for any one to be
exalted to the company of angels, whatever life he may
be of, as to his interior state ; and that therefore to
be in Heaven is nothing more than a grant by an imme
diate act of mercy ; (51) whereas if Heaven is not with
in, no Heavenly Influx is received from without. Many
spirits under this erroneons persuasion, in order to con
vince them of their error, where permitted to ascend in
to the place of Heaven ; but they were'no sooner there
but (as their interior state of life was contrary to that of
the Angels) their understanding became confused and
darkened, all their inward powers disturbed, and they
reduced to such a state of suffering, that they behaved
like ideots, or insane persons ; in a word, they who are
ill-principled in their life's properties, and are translated
to Angelical Society, feel a kind of suffocation, and suffer
an anguish, like that of fishes when out of their element,
or like that of animals in an air-pump, out of which
the air is extracted: which shews that Heaven con
sists in a state within, and not in a place without us.

18 A treatise concerning'
55. As all receive the influences of the external hea
ven, according to the quality of the heaven that is within
them, in like manner also do they receive the Lord, as
it is his Divinity that constitutes heaven ; hence it is,
that when he vouchsafes a personal manifestation ofhim
self to any Society, his appearance is according to the
quality of good in that particular Society, and therefore
he appears not to any two exactly alike ;* not that
there is any variableness in him ; but the dissimilitude
is in them who behold him, from their own particular
kind or degree of good, and according to it ; and likewise
according thereto, are they affected with such beatific
vision ; they who love him most, are most affected with
delight, they with less that love him less ; and as to the
evil who are without heaven, they are tormented at his
presence. When the Lord manifests himself to any So
ciety, he appears therein as an Angel, though distin
guishable from the Angels by the transcendent brightness
of his Divinity.
56. There also is heaven, where the Lord is acknow
ledged, believed in, and loved : the various modes of
worshipping him in this or that Society, has no other ef
fect than for the better, for it constitutes a perfection in
heaven. This will hardly be received without our taking
in here something in the literary way for explanation and
distinction, to shew how every thing that is perfect con
sists pf various other things ; every thing, however sim
ple, or one it may be supposed to be, exists from various
others, otherwise it would not be any thing, but be void
of form, and consequently without particular quality or,
mark of distinction ; but where it exists as a whole,
from various parts and properties uniting with friendly
composition in a perfect form, it is then an intire thing,
having its own peculiar quality and distinction. Just so
it is with heaven ; it is a one or whole, consisting of va
riety, but of variety ordered and disposed in the most

perfect from, for the heavenly form is of all the most
perfect. That all perfection is thus constituted, appears
from hence, that every thing most beautiful, pleasing,
and delightful to the mind and senses, do all proceed
from consent of parts, and a harmonizing variety (whe
ther they co-exist in simultaneous order, or follow-
in succession) and not from any thing that is but
merely one ; whence comes the common adage, that in
variety is delight ; now we know that this must be ac
cording to thedifferent qualities in things: and this may
teach us that perfection, even in heaven, consists in va
riety ; for this natural world is a kind of mirror or glass,
representing to us the things that are in the Spiritual
world. (53)
57. The same may be predicated of the Church in
this matter, as the Church is the Lord's heaven on earth;
now the Church is manifold, consisting of many
churches, each of which is called and is a Church, in
proportion to the good of love and faith that is in it : and
here also the Lord forms unity out of variety, and one-
church out of many. (54) And the same may be affirm
ed of every member of the church in particular, that has
been spoken of the church in common, viz. that tho-
church is within, and not without the man ; and also that
every one, who is a true member of the church, is like
wise a church himself, in whom the Lord is present, in
the good of his love and faith :
(55) and farther, it may
be said of every one in whom the church
is,
as was said
(53) That every one intire thing
is

its several parts and properties, and that otherwise
it

now man hath in common
with angels, that his interior

is
a

is
in the good of

:
and man has this more than the angels,
that in his exterior he
is
formed after the image of this
world
;
and that as far as he is in the principle of good,
this world in him
is
subordinate, and subservient to hea

is
present with him in
both worlds, according to his Divine Order in each, for
God
is

58. Lastly, we are here to observe, that he who hath
heaven in him, hath heaven not only in his principle
powers and properties, but also in the least things, as
these in their proportion resemble the greatest ; and this
for the following reason, because every one is in reality
the same with his own proper prevailing love, as this
influencesandregulates the whole man, (59) and produces
its likeness therein.* In the heavens love to the Lord
is the governing principle, because there the Lord is
loved above all things, and consequently is all in all ; he
influences, guides and forms the blessed angels into a si
militude of himself, and constitutes heaven by his Di
vine presence : hence it is, that every single Angel is
heaven in the least and lowest form ; every angelical So
ciety, in a greater f6rm ; and all the angelical Societies-
collectively, in the greatest form. That the divinity of
the Lord constitutes heaven, and is all in all things there,

conceptions of. Now, forasmuch as they know that the
whole of heaven, together with its several Societies coU
Jectively, are in the form of a Man, therefore they call
heaven the Grand (Maximum) and Divine Man:
(60) Divine, because it is the Divinity of the Lord that
constitutes heaven ; see above, from n. 7 to 12.
60. That heavenly and spiritual things should be
formed into such an image and likeness, will not be con
ceived by those who have no competent idea of them ;
such are apt to suppose, that what is earthly and mate
rial in the external part of the human composition, is so
essential to man, that he would cease to be man without
such materials ; but let them know, that he receives not
his denomination of man from thence, but from his ca-
pacities ofknowing truth, and willing good : these spiri
tual and heavenly properties constitute his character as
man : nay, all know that every one is called such or such
a man, according to his understanding, and the disposi
tion of his will ; jind also may know, that his terrestial
body is formed, in order to its subserviency to those fa
culties in this world, and through the instrumentality of
its several organs to contribute to their operations and
usefulness in this lowest sphere of nature ; for to the
body belongs no principal of self-motion, but only to be
passive and obsequiously obedient to the motions of the
intellect and will, which are the only agents and princi
pals in all that man speaks or does, making use of the
body only as their instrument ; and consequently these
are the principles that constitute the man, and also are in
similarform, as appears by their instantaneous operations
on all the bodily members, as an internal agent on an ex
ternal instrument, whence man is denominated internal
and spiritual ; such a man in the greatest and most per
fect form is heaven.

and therefore they do not consider him in relation to the

rects them, and with respect to his understanding, as far
as this co-operates with the will. (61)
62. The angels do not, it is true, behold the universal
heaven in such a form, because it comes not within the
reach of any angel's ken ; but they sometimes behold
very distant societies (consisting of many thousands of
angels) as one in such a form ; and from a society as a
part, they conclude concerning the whole, that being the
most perfect form in which the aggregates, and the parts
of which they consist, resembles each other, without
any other difference than betwixt greater and" less:*
wherefore they say, that the Lord, as the centre and
great original of all creation, beholds the universal hea*
ven in this form.
63. Such being the constitution of heaven, it is ac
cordingly actuated and governed by the Lord as one man
or one thing : now it is well known, that though man is
a very complicated system, consisting of a great variety
of parts, as well in the principals, as in the particulars
of his composition ; in the former, of members, organs,
and bowels ; in the latter, of fibres, nerves, and blood
vessels of different classes and orders ; and so of mem
bers within members, and parts within parts ; yet not
withstanding this his multifarious composition, when he
acts, he acts but as one simple agent or man : so in like
manner may we consider the universal heaven, notwith
standing its infinite variety, to be uniformly governed by
the will, and at the good pleasure of the Lord.
64. That so many different parts in man act with such
unity and conformity
is,

position performs its office of use, as most contributes
to the good of the whole, the community ministering use
to the particular parts; and the latter their's to the service
of the community ; for the community is made up of the
parts, and the parts constitute the community ; where
fore they all conspire with mutual consent to promote
the common good of the whole, whence arises uniformi
ty. Just so it is in respect to use and co-operation with
the consociations in the heavens, and they that should not
contribute their respective services to the common good,
would be ejected as unprofitable members ; by being
profitable or unprofitable here, is meant the being well
affected to others for the sake of the common good, or
only for the sake of our own private good in particular ;
of the latter sort are they who are actuated only by self-
love in all things ; of the former class are they who love
the Lord above all things ; hence it is, that all who are
in heaven have only one principle of acting, and that, not
from themselves but from the Lord : for up to him they
look, as the source of all good, and to his kingdom as
that community, the good of which they are to promote
in all things according to those words of the Lord :
"" Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteous-
" ness, and all things shall be added unto you," Matt,
vi. 33. Righteousness (62) here means good from the
Lord, as the source of all good. They who in this
world love the good of their country above their own
private good, and the good of their neighbour as their
own, are they who in the other life love and seek the
kingdom of our Lord, which is to them instead of their
country : and they who love to do good to others from
the love of good, and not for selfish ends, are they who
love their neighbour ; for among the angels good and
neighbour mean the same :

character, are in what is called the Grand Man, or hea
ven.
65. As the universal heaven represents or resembles
one man, and also is a divine spiritual man in the great
est form and image, therefore heaven is distinguished,
like man, by human members and parts, and after the
same names ; accordingly the angels well know whai
particular member this or that society belongs to, and h
is common for them to say, such a society is in a certain
member or province of the head, another in such a part
or province of the breast, and the third in such a mem
ber or province of the lungs, and so of the rest. In ge
neral, the supreme or third heaven forms the head to
the neck ; the middle or second heaven forms the breast
down to the loins and knees : and the lowest or first hea
ven forms the inferior parts down to the feet, and also the
arms to the fingers ; for the arms and hands are the ex
tremities of the body, though at the sides ; hence also
proceeds the distinction of three heavens.
66. The Spirits, who are beneath heaven, greatly won J
der when they hear and see that heaven is beneath as well
as above; for they are of the same opinion with the people
of this world, that heaven is no where but above, not
blowing that the situation of the heavens is as the situ
ation of the members, organs, and bowels in man, some
;
of which are above, and some beneath ; some within, and
some without ; whence arise their confused ideas con
cerning heaven.
67. So much for what we had to say concerning hea
ven considered as the Grand Man ; as without this pre
vious knowledge, the things which follow relating to
heaven could not be understood, nor any idea be con
ceived of the form of heaven, of the conjunction of the
Lord with heaven, nor of the conjunction of heaven
with man, nor yet of the Influx of the spiritual into the
natural world, much less of the laws of correspon
dence betwixt both ; of which in their order in the sequel

subjects these things are premised.

84* A treatise concerning
THAT EVERY SOCIETY IN THE HEAVENS RE
SEMBLES A HUMAN FORM.
68. THAT every society of heaven resembles the
human form, and is in the likeness and image of man, has
sometimes been given me to see. There was a society
into which many had insinuated themselves, who knew
how to counterfeit the appearance of angels of light, but
they were hypocrites ; upon the separation of these from
the angels, the whole society, appeared at first as an ob
scure body ; afterwards, by degrees, in a human form,
but indistinctly ; and at last clearly in the form of a man:
they who formed this figure as the several members or
constituent parts of
it,
were such as were in the good*
of this society
;
but they who constituted no part of this
human form, were not of the society, nor in the good
property that distinguished
it,
but intruding hypocrites,
and as such separated from it. Such here are called hy
pocrites, who have good words, and outwardly good
works, but at the same time have
a
view to self in every
* By the good of any thing, we are to understand the peculiar
good quality or property that prevails in
it,
and distinguishes
it
from
the kind of good in another thing
:
so here
;
the good of the society
mentioned in this place, means the particular characteristic of that
society, whether as in the good of humility, of charity, of gratitude,
and so on And as all the virtues, graces, relative duties, and per
fections ofevery kind, give distinction to the angelical societies, so do
the different degrees of them, insomuch that they are innumerable
;
not thatjany one society iswithout any other virtue,but that
it
takes its
particular denomination and distinction from that in which
it
most
excels
:
and farther
it
is
to be noted, that every particular angel in
every particular society has something of distinction peculiar to
himself, that differences him from every other angel in the same so
ciety, but only as one member in the same body differs from ano
ther, whilst each contributes, by one common harmonizing variety,
to the perfection of the whole
:
the same
is
observable in every so
ciety of good men on earth in proprotion respectively
:
and that we
call the latter by the name of

body
;
and what
is
there incredible
in the supposition, that such societies in heaven should be repre
sented at times, even to the view of the beholder, under the appear
ance of

human form, as of all the most excellent, and that which
the Lord of all lords has assumed for the manifestation of his divini
ty. Tr.

thing : they can talk like angels, of the Lord, of heaven,
of love, and of spiritual things, and are also in the out
ward practice of what is good, that they may be thought
to be in deed what they are in word ; whereas their
thoughts are far different, and they have neither faith,
nor good will to any but themselves ; and if at any time
they do good to others, it is for some selfish end.
69. That a whole society of angels, when the Lord
manifests his presence to them, appears as one in a hu
man form, has been given me to see ; and once in parti
cular, such a society appeared high toward the east, like
a cloud of a pale red colour, surrounded with little stars,
and descending ; and as it descended gradually, it ap
peared brighter, and at length in a perfect human form :
the little stars that surrounded the cloud were so many
angels under that appearance by light from the Lord.
70. It is to be noted, that though all of the same so
ciety, when together, appear as one in a human form,
yet no one society is exactly like another, but differs as
different families from the same stock here on earth, and
that from the like cause mentioned, n. 47. viz. thatthey
differ according to the various kinds and degrees of
good in which they are, and from which they derive
their distinct appearances, though under one common
form. In the most beautifuj and perfect human form are
the societies of the inmost or highest heaven, and more
especially they who are in the centre of it. -
71. It is worthy of notice, that the greater the num
ber in any of the angelical societies, and the greater their
harmony, the more perfect is their human form ; for the
greater the variety or number, when acting by consent
in a heavenly disposition, strengthens the unity of the
whole, see n. 56. Thus every society in heaven, as it
daily increases in number, advances in peifection, and
not only every society in particular, but heaven in com
mon, as the whole of heaven consists of its several parti
cular societies. As heaven thus advances in degrees of
perfection in proportion to the increase of its inhabitants,
we may hence learn the error of those, who suppose that
it may be so compleatly furnished with guests, as to

ber you can, and yet there is room ; nor do the angels de
sire any thing more than to have their number increased
by the arrival of fresh angels from other worlds.
72. That every society, when together, appears as one
human form, is because the universal heaven has the
same form, as may be seen in the foregoing article ; and
in the most perfect form, as that of heaven, there is a
resemblance between the parts and the whole, between
the lesser and the greatest ;• now the lesser, or the parts
of heaven, are the societies of which it consists, which
are so many heavens in a lesser form ; see above n. 5 \
to 58. That there is such a perpetual similitude in the
heavens, is because the various species of good [fiona] in
all there, proceed from one love or origin : now the one
love from which all those goods originate, is love
to the Lord in the angels proceeding from the Lord :
hence it is that the universal heaven is a likeness of him
in common ; every society a similitude of him in a lesser
community ; and every angel a likeness or image of him
in particular ; see above on this subject, n. 58.

THAT EVERY ANGEL IS IN A PERFECT HUMAN
FORM.
73. IT has been shewed before, that the universal
heaven resembles the human form, as does likewise eve
ry society in heaven ; and from the chain of causes and
effects there produced, it follows, that every particular an
gel has the same figure ; the universal heaven as a man
in the greatest, each society in a lesser, and. every parti
cular angel in the least human form ; for in the most per
fect form, as is that of heaven, there is a mutual likeness
between the whole and its parts ; and that because hea

perfection to every one, whilst every individual is a re
ceiver from that whole, and so is heaven in its leastform

88 A treatise concerning
and that this might not be suspected of being a decep*
tion, or vision of the imagination, it has been given me
to see them when quite awake, and in all clearness of
sensible perception. I have often told them, that in our
Christian world, the generality were so grossly ignorant
in respect to the nature of Angels and Spirits, as to take
them for minds without form, mere invisible thinkers,
and of which they had no other idea, than as of vital
aether ; and that consequently, having nothing in them
human but the power of thinking, they could neither see,
hear, nor speak, as being without eyes, ears, and tongues.
To which the angels replied, that they knew it to be so
with many in this world, particularly among the learned,
and (which they much wondered at) also with the clergy:
and they assigned for the cause of it as follows, viz.
that the learned, who first broached this error, being
mere natural men, and borrowing all their ideas of sub
stance from their external senses, and not from any inte
rior light, or from those common notices of things which
are implanted in the human mind, refined spiritual things
and beings, as it were, into nothings ; not seeing, from,
the grossness of their ideas, how any thing could exist
spiritually in form and substance, that is not material and
palpable to sense, as in this natural world. (69) From
such leaders in error this false notion concerning angels
was derived down to others : now the who resign up
their minds to others, and believe on their own authority
alone, seldom recover their liberty, but for the most part
acquiesce in confirming themselves in what they so im
bibe. Moreover they said, that men of simplicity in faith
and heart, thought far otherwise of the angels, and con
ceived of them as heavenly men, and that because they
did not extinguish the heavenly idea of them by human
learning, nor admit of any thing into their minds, but

under some form ; hence it is that angels in churches,
whether as carved or painted, have always been repre
sented as men : by heavenly ideas, or ideas from hea
ven of celestial things, they said, was meant a divine
Influx or light in those who are in the good of faith and
life.
75. From all my experience, which is now of many
years, I can truly affirm, that the angels, in respect to
their form, are perfect men, having like faces, eyes, ears,
breasts, arms, hands, feet, &c. that they hear, see, and
converse with one another ; and, in a word, that nothing
human is wanting to them, but these material bodies of
flesh that we are invested with : I have beheld them in

an Lustre, and have therein discerned all the features and
variations of their faces more distinctly than those of my
fellow inhabitants of this earth. It was also granted me
to see an angel of the inmost or highest heaven, who ap*
peared with a more resplendent countenance that the an
gels ofthe lower heavens, and was oi a human form mail
perfection.
76. It is here to be observed, that the angels cannot
be seen by any mortal man with the eyes of his body,
but with those only of the spirit which is in man, (70)
and that because this is in the Spiritual world ; but all
things appertaining to the body, in the Natural world ;
for like only sees like in the same common nature.
Moreover, the organ of bodily vision, or the material
eye, is so gross, that it cannot discern the more minute
parts of nature without the assistance of optical glasses,
as is well known ; how much less those things which are
above the sphere of nature, as are all things in the spiri
tual world ; and yet these are manifested to his view,
when he is withdrawn inwardly from the bodily sense,
and the eye of the spirit is opened, which is done in an
instant, when it pleases the Lord to give him a sight of
things in the Spiritual worlds ; and then they appear as if

That the Divinity ofthe Lord constitutes Heaven. III.
That Heaven consists ofinnumerable Societies, and that
every Society is Heaven in a lesser Form ; and every
Angel in its least Form. IV. That the Universal Hea

ciety in the Havens also resembles one Alan as to its
Form. VI. That likewise every particular Angel is in
a perfect Human Form. From all these premises we
may conclude, that the Deity, or Divine Nature, as con-
stituting heaven, is also a Human Form :
* and that such
Human Form is the Divine Humanity of the Lord,
though otherwise thought of by many in the church, will
more fully appear from the many quotations extracted
from Arcana Cozlestia, and collected together in this
work ; and also from the Doctrine ofthe lioly Jerusa

Lord.
79. That this is the real truth, has been confirmed to
me by much experience, of which I shall speak in what
follows. All the angels in the heavens have no percep

ly imputing to our Author the error of the ancient Anthropomor-
phites, whose heresy did not consist in ascribing a human form to
the Deity, for every true believer acknowledges this in the Word
made flesh, but in ascribing a separate personal form to the Father
or Divine Essence, in distinction from the Son: and it is to be wish
ed that they who are most apt to fix such a charge upon our Author,
may not be of that number, who outdo the ancient Anthropomor-
phites in their heresy, by a gross understanding of the doctrine of
the Holy Trinity, in assigning to the Godhead Three distinct per
sonal forms, and to plunge themselves into Polytheism, or the belief
of a plurality of Gods.
I shall conclude this note with another, taken from a pamphlet, in-
titled, " The cause of the Petitioners examined," &c. Printed for
Robinson, Pater-noster-Row, 1773 ; and to which I refer the reader
for further satisfaction on this subject.

tion of the Divine Majesty under any other than a hu
man form; and what is still more to be admired, they
which belong to the superior heavens cannot think of him
otherwise, being necessarily led thereto by a divine in
flux, and also by the form and laws of the heavenly world,
according to which their thoughts extend themselves
around them ; for the thoughts of angels have such ex
tension, and in proportion thereto is their understanding
and Wisdom : hence proceeds, their unanimous consent
to the truth of the Divine Humanity of our Lord, and in
him only. These thing* were not only told me by the
angels, but it was allowed me to have a perception of
them during the elevation of my spirit into an interior
sphere of heaven: hence it appears, that the more highly
the angels are graduated in wisdom, the more evident is
their perception of this truth, and the better qualified for
the beatific vision ; for the Lord appears in an angelical,
that
is,
a
human form, to those who acknowledge and
believe
in
his Di\ inity as visible, but not to those who
think
it
invisible
:
the former are capable of beholding
his glorious Majesty, but the latter are not.
80. Forasmuch as the angels have no idea of the di
vine invisible Essence, which they call the Divinity
without form, but only of the visible Divinity in a hu
man form; therefore
it
is
a
usual way of speaking with
them to say, that the Lord alone
is
the true perfect Man,
and that they are only so far men as they receive him, by
which they mean their receiving good and truth from
him, as (herein he himself is, and which they call wisdom
and understanding; for these, (say they) all may know,
constitute the man, and not his mere face and figure
without them
;
and that this
is
so, appears evidently from
the angels of the more interior or higher heavens, who,
being in the higher degrees of good and truth from the
Lord, are also of
a
more beautiful and perfect form than
the lower angels
;
but the reverse of this
is
the case of
the inhabitants oi the infernal regions, who when viewed
in the light of heaven, scarcely exhibit any thing of the
human form, but appear as monsters; forasmuch as they
are in the properties of evil and false, which are opposite
'
to wisdom and truth
;
for which reason their kind of life
is
not called Life, but Spiritual Death.

Heaven and Hell. 93
81. As Heaven, both in whole and in part, thus re
sembles a man, from the Divine Humanity of the Lord;
therefore the angels commonly say, that they are in
the Lord, and some of them that they are in his
body, meaning, in the good of his love ; according to
those words of the Lord :
" Abide in me, and I in you:
" as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it
" abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in
" me : I am the vine, ye are the branches : without me,
" ye can do nothing. —Continue ye in my love : If ye
" keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love."
John xv. 4—10.
82. Such being the perception of the Divinity in the
Angels, it is, as it were, congenial to every one that is a
recipient of the Divine Influx, to form an idea of God
under some species of Humanity : thus did the ancients,
and so the moderns both within and without the church,
whilst the more simple of both, figure him in their
thoughts, as the Ancient of Days m a vesture of light ;
but many extinguish every idea of God in their mind6,
either by carnal reasonings, or an evil life ;* and so in
the former case dispute against him as a revealed God ;
or in the latter, disown his existence ; and thus having
extinguished in themselves the light from Heaven, will
not allow that any others have it : whereas it is given
from above to every man as a creature born into this
world for Heaven, and whither no one goes that is in-
tirely without any idea of a Deity.
83. Hence it is, that he, who is devoid of every idea
of Heaven, and so of the Divine Creator of
it,
is
incapa
ble of entrance into Heaven, but finds
a
resistance and
repulse on the first approach
;
and that beeause his inte
rior, which should be the receptive and qualifying con
dition,
is
not adapted to the state of Heaven, but
is
as
a
shut gate within him, and the closer shut, by how much
nearer he approaches to the holy abode. Such
is
the fate
*
Hence
it
is
that so many amongst us run into Naturalism, as
cribing all things to blind nature, avoiding even the mention of the
name of God, nay, banishing every idea of him from their minds,and
so become Atheists; for that of which wc have no manner of idesu
ceases to be an object of qui- fa,ith. Tr.

94 A treatise concerning
of those in the outer church, who deny the Lord, or with
the Socinians disown his Divinity : as to the lot of those
who were not born nor educated within the pale of the
church, nor favoured with the Light of the written
Word ; this shall be spoken to hereafter.
84. That the ancients had an idea of the Divine Hu
manity, is manifest from the Divine Appearances to
Abraham, Lot, Joshua, Gideon, Manoah, his wife, and
others, who, though they beheld God as Man, yet wor
shipped him as the God of the Universe, calling him
the God of Heaven and Earth, and Jehovah ; and that it
was the Lord that appeared to Abraham, he 'tells us,
John viii. 56. and also to others in old times, John i. 18.
v. 37.
85. But that God, is also Man, will hardly be believed
by those who judge of heavenly things by their External
Senses, and the things ofthis World, and consequently of
the Divine and Spiritual, by the Corporeal and Natural
Man ; for such a one will immediately conclude, that if
God were also Man, he must (from his ubiquity) be as
large as th: Universe, or, in order to be Governor of
Heaven and Earth, stand in need of many Lieutenant
Governors, like Earthly Monarchs; or ifwe should tell
them, that there is no such extension of space in Heaven
as with us in this World, they could not receive it; for
they who think only from outward Nature on this subject,
and apply those thoughts as a measure to heavenly things,
fall into gross delusion and absurdity ; extension in
Heaven is of a far different nature from what is here ; in
this World it is something determinate, and, as such,
measurable; but there indeterminate and unmeasurable :

highly important use in this subject, will be ofdifficult comprehen

as it is above the sphere of metaphysical knowledge in general ; and
yet it may readily be understood by those who can abstract their
thoughts intirely from Natural to Spiritual things, and also may be

hereafter, where we treat of Space and Time in the Spi
ritual World. Every one knows the great extent of vi
sion by the bodily organ of sight, even as far as to the
Sun and Stars, though at so immense a distance; and eve
ry man of thought can testify to the incomparably
greater fextent of sight by the eye of the mind, and that
in proportion to the interior capacity of him that specu
lates. What then shall we say of him, who gave sight
both to body and mind, and is the Inmost and Supreme
over all ! Such being the extent of our thoughts, how
easy is it to believe, that the knowledge of, all heavenly
and Divine Things is communicated from Angel to An
gel from the first Divine Fountain of Knowledge, accord
ing to their capacities of receiving respectively, as has
been declared in the preceding articles.
86. The Angels wonder that Men should account
themselves wiser than their brethren for rejecting the be
lief of the Deity, as manifesting himself under a human
form ; whereas, if the truth be searched into, they will
be found to have substituted Nature in the room of the
Creator, and are totally ignorant of what relates to God,
Angels, Spirits, and even their own immortal Souls;
concerning all which, the simple and unlearned, whom.
they so despise, have ideas more conform to truth than
themselves, whilst they conceive of the Deity as having
assumed a Human Form ; of Angels, as heavenly Men ;
and that they themselves, shall be like unto them, if they
lead holy lives according to God's commandments:
these Persons the Angels call Intelligent, and not the
others.
mon than to say of such or such a one, that he is a man of extensive
knowledge, or of a very limited capacity : and yet to t%ink of applying
any determinate rule from outward nature, as an adequate measure
of these, how grossly absurd would be the thought ! As well might
we go about to measure imagination by the gllaon, or intellect by
the carpenters rule.' The attentive mind, by improving this hint,
will discern the difference between degrees and extension in the
Natural and Spiritual Worlds. Tr.

96 A treatise concerning
THAT THERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN-
ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN, AND ALL THINGS
IN MAN.
87. WHAT is meant by Correspondence between
heavenly and earthly things is scarcely known at this
time, and that through various causes ; but principally,
because Man has so far alienated himself from Heaven
by the love of Self and the World; and they who give
themselves up to these, direct all their views and pursuits
to worldly things, as more agreeable to Mature and their
External Senses, without attending to those that are
Spiritual, and suited to the entertainment of the mind
and inward senses; wherefore they reject these, calling
them abstruse, and too high for them : but the ancients
were otherwise minded, for they accounted the know
ledge of Correspondences as the most exalted of all
Sciences, as the Fountain from whence they drew their
understanding and wisdom : and as to those who were of
the Church of God, it was by means hereof that they
held Communication with Heaven ; for the knowledge
of Correspondences is the knowledge of Angels.
'
The
most ancient formed their minds by the doctrine and laws'
of C6rrespondence, and thought according thereto, like
the Angels, and conversed with them ; and hence it was
that the Lord often vouchsafed to appear to them, and
give them divine instructions ; but this kind of know
ledge is so far lost amongst us at this day, that it is
scarcely any longer known what is meant by the term
Correspondence, as here used. (72.)
88. Now forasmuch as without some knowledge of
what is meant by Correspondence, nothing relating to
the Spiritual World can scarcely be understood ; neither
concerning its Influx into the Natural World ; nor of the

distinction betwixt what is Spiritual and what Natural ;
nor yet any thing with clearness of the Spirit of man call
ed the Soul, and its operation on the body ; nor lasdy, of
the State of man after Death ; we shall therefore here
shew what is meant by Correspondence, by way of prepa
rative to what follows.
89. And first, for what is meant by Correspondence :
Now the whole Natural World corresponds to the
Spiritual World, both in the whole, and likewise in its
several parts ; and what exists and subsists in the Natu
ral from the Spiritual, is called correspondence ; now the
whole Natural World exists and subsists from the Spiri
tual, as an effect from its efficient cause ; therefore there
is a correspondent relation betwixt them. By the Natu
ral World is meant the whole expanse under the sun, and
whatever therein receives light and heat from it belongs
to that World ; by the Spiritual World is meant Hea
ven, and all that is therein.
90. As man is an image both of heaven and of this
world, in the least form, (see above, n. 57.) therefore he
stands here both in the Spiritual and Natural Worid ;
the things within (those of the mind and spirit) which <
respect the Intellect and Will, constitute his Spiritual
World ; but those of the body, which respect his exter
nal senses and actions, constitute his Natural World':
whatever therefore in his natural world (or body, senses,
and actions) derives its existence from his spiritual
world, (or Mind, Intellect, and Will) that is called Cor
respondent.*
* In this definition and distinction the intelligent reader will find
a most admirable and important part of instruction, which will ex
plain a man to himself, and point out to him all the good and evil in
his life, without the iclp of that kind of sophistry commonly called
Casuistical Divinity. It may be sufficient here, for a farther expla
nation of our Author's meaning, to observe, that correspondence
between things Spiritual and Natural, signifies the essence of a
thing brought into form, or the principle manifested in act: thus
benevolence shews itself in benefits, and malevolence in injuries:
and thus throughout nature, the Heavenly World or good principle
.realises itself in beautiful and good productions ; and the hellish, or
evil principle, in all the various forms of monstrosity and evil : and
so the rage and horrors of the Dark World break forth in thunder

98 A treatise concerning
9 1 . "fhis doctrine is explained in the human counte
nance : thus in the face of any one who is not practised
in the art of dissimulation, we may read the affections
and passions of his mind, as in their type or natural form:
hence it is common to say, that the face is the Index of
the mind ; or in other words, the Spiritual World of such,
or such a one is conspicuous in his Natural World: in like
manner, the things of the Intellect are represented in the
speech ; and those of the Will, in the gestures and move
ments of the body : now all that is thus expressed in the
body, whether by the face, speech, or gestures, is called
Correspondence.
92. Hence may be understood what is meant by the
Internal, and what by the External man, and that the
former is called the Spiritual, and the latter the Natu
ral man; and also that the one is as distinct from the
other, as heaven is from this world : and moreover, that
all that is formed in or done by the latter, is from the
former.
93 . So much for Correspondence between the inward
or Spiritual, and the outward or Natural man : we shall
now proceed to speak of that Correspondence which is
between the whole of heaven, and the several parts of
man.
94. It has been shewed, that the universal heaven re
sembles one man, or is in a human form, and so called
the Grand (or Greatest) Man; and also that the angelical
Societies, of which heaven consists, have accordingly
their order and situation like the members, organs, and
viscera in the human body, so that some of them occupy
the place of the head, some that of the breast, others that
of the arms, and others also different parts of these ; sec
n. 59 to 72 : consequently such societies as are in any
particularmember there,correspond to the like member in
man here; as for example, they who are in the head there,
correspond to the head in man here ; they who are in the
and lightening, storm and tempest ; but the meekness of Paradise
refreshes all nature with the genial warmth and soft blandishments
of Vernal Delights. It is here to be noted, that the Science of Phy
siognomy is grounded in that of Correspondences. Tr,

that man subsists, his subsistence or continued existence
being from heaven only.
95. That heaven is distinguished into two kingdoms,
the one of which is called the Celestial, the other the
Spiritual Kingdom has been shewed in its proper article:
now the Celestial kingdom in common corresponds to
the heart, and what appertains to it in the whole body ;
and the Spiritual kingdom to the lungs, and what apper
tains thereto in the whole body : the heart and the lungs
do also form two kingdoms ; the former ruling therein by
the arteries and veins ; and the latter by the nervous and
motive fibres, and both in every effort and action of the
body. In the Spiritual World or Spiritual Man of every
one are also two kingdoms ; the one is that of the Will,
the other that of the Intellect by the affections oftruth j
and these two kingdoms correspond to those of the heart
and the lungs* in the body ; so likewise in the heavens;
the Celestial kingdom is theWill- partfvoluntarium eceli)
of heaven, and there the good of love has the ascendant
or government ; and the Spiritual kingdom is the Intel
lectual part (intellectual ccelij of heaven ; and there
truth has the ascendant or government ; and these two
kingdoms correspond to the functions of the heart and
lungs in man. From this Correspondence it is, that the
heart in the Word signifies the Will, and also the good
of Love ; and also that the breath or pulmonary spirit
signifies the understanding and true of Faith ; hence also
it
is,
that the affections are ascribed to the heart, though
in

not the seat or cause of them. (73)

96. The correspondence of the two kingdoms of. hea

heaven with man jn common, Or of the whole of one
with the whole of the other ; the less common or parti
cular, is with the several members, organs, and viscera
of man, as shall be here specified : they who in the Grand
Man or Heaven belong to the Head, are the Angels who
excel ail others in every species of Good, as Love,
Peace, Innocence, Wisoom, Knowledge, &.c. and con
sequently in Joy and Happiness ; and from them pro
ceeds the Influx into the human head, and all that apper

gels which in the Grand Man or Heaven brlong to the
region or province of the breast, excel in the good of
Charity and Faith, and operate in their influence on the
human breast here, inasmuch as they correspond thereto:
but they who in the Grand Man or Heaven, belong to
the regions of the Loins, and the organs appointed for
. generation, are they' who chiefly excel in Conjugal Love:
•
they who belong to the Feet, are in the lowest gc^d of
Heaven, or that called Spiritual-Natural or Physicb-Spi«
ritual Good : they who belong to the arms and hands,
are in the potency of that kind of Truth which is deriv
ed from Good : they who are in the Eyes, excel in Un
derstanding : they who are in the Ears, in Attention and
Obedience : they who are in the Nose, excel in the fa
culty of Perception : they who are in the Mouth and

1 02 A treatise cnneeming^
98. That such is the Correspondence between all
things in Heaven, and all things' in Man, has been mani
fested to me by long experience, and that in so full a
measure, that my conviction herein is beyond all shadow
of doubting ; but to offer the whole of it here, is not on
ly unnecessary, but, on account of its extent, beyond my
power ; but it has been given dispersedly in the Arcana
Coe/estia, where I have treated of Correspondences, of
representations, of the Influx of the Spiritual into the
Natural World, and of the communication between soul
and body. (75)
99. But though all things in Man, even with respect
to his body correspond to all in Heaven, yet he is not
an image of Heaven in his external, but in his internal
form ; for it is the Interior of Man that receives the hea
venly Influx,
whilst his Exterior or Natural part is influ
enced by the things of this World ; as far therefore as
his Interior is receptive of the former, so far only is he
reputed a Heaven in its least form after the likeness of
the greatest; but so far as he is unreceptive of the hea
venly influx in his interior, or Inner Man, so far is he
not in the form of Heaven; and yet his Exterior, or Na
tural Man, which communicates with this World, may
be in order according to the laws of this mundane sys
tem, and consequently be of a beautiful form, for this o-
riginates from the parents, and his formationin the womb,
and is preserved and nourished by the Elements of this
World ; and therefore it is, that the Natural form of a
Man often widely differs from the form of his Spiritual
Man. It has sometimes been given me to see of what

form the Spirit of a Man was, and it plainly appeared to
me, that in some who were of a comely and beautiful
countenance, it was ugly, black and monstrous, and ra
ther to be called the image of Hell than of Heaven ;
whereas in others, though uncomely in their Exterior, it
was beautiful, shining, and angelical : and it is to be no
ted, that the Spirit of a Man after Deatli appears such
as it was before, whilst in the body.
100. But Correspondence is of much larger extent,
than in reference to Man only ; for there is a Correspond
ence of the Heavens between one another : thus the se
cond or middle Heaven corresponds to the inmost op
third Heaven; and the first or lowest Heaven corres
ponds to the second or middle Heaven ; and it is this
first or lowest Heaven that more immediately corres
ponds to and communicates with the corporeal forms of
men, their members, organs, and viscera; and it is
this corporeal part in Man, in which the influence of
Heaven terminates, and rests as on its basis : but this
is a secret which shall be more fully opened in another-
place. ,
101. It is here to be noted, as a first principle, that all
Correspondence with Heaven is through the Divine Hu
manity of the Lord, forasmuch as Heaven originates
from him as its essence, as has been shewed before : foF
were not virtue flowing from his Divine Humanity to in
fluence all in Heaven, and by Correspondence all created
Nature here below, . there would be neither Angel nor
Man : and hence likewise it does appear why the Lord
became Man, and invested his Deity with Humanity,
from its highest to its lowest Nature, and dwelt amongst
us, viz. because, through the degeneracy of Man, all was
brought into such disorder, that all communication with
the Divine Humanity in Heaven, on which his salvation
depended, was cut off", and could only be restored by the
assumption of our Natural Humanity to his Divine, as a
ground of communication between him and us.
102. The Angels seem astonished when they hear of
men, who ascribe all to Nature, and nothing to the Dei
ty, and can believe that their own bodies, which consist

104- A treatise concerning
of so many wonderful correspondences and representa-
tions of heavenly things, should be formed and fashioned
by inanimate Nature ; and what is still more absurd, that
they should assign no higher origin to the rational prin
ciple : whereas the least exercise of reflection might suf
fice to demonstrate this to be the effect of a divine for
mation ; and that Nature was created on purpose to serve
for a covering or .outward exhibition of what is Spiritual,
and to yield a corresponding representation of the same
in the lowest order of things. All such are compared by
the Angels to Owls, which see in the dark, but are blind
in the light.
THAT THERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN
HEAVEN AND ALL THINGS ON EARTH.
103. WE have already explained what is meant by
Correspondence ; and also shewed that the whole and
every part of the human body is such : it now remains
to make appear, that ail things of the earth, nay, of the
world in general, are Correspondences in like manner.
104. All things belonging to the earth are distingnish-
ed into three kinds, which are called kingdoms, viz. the
Animal, the Vegetable, and the Mineral Kingdom : the
things in the Animal Kingdom are Correspondences in
the first degree, as having life ; those in the Vegetable
Kingdom correspond in the second degree, as having
growth, but no sensitive life ; and those in the Mineral
Kingdom correspond in the third degree, as having nei
ther life nor growth. The Correspondents of the first
Kingdom, are the Animals of various kinds, which ei
ther walk or creep on the earth, or fly in the air ; which
being so well known, are not here ennumerated as nei
ther those of the second or Vegetable Kingdom, which
are all trees, herbs, plants, and flowers^ which grow and
flourish in the woods, gardens, fields, or elsewhere. The
Correspondents in the Mineral Kingdom, are the more
noble, and also the inferior metals; precious aud common
stones ; fossils, and earths of various kinds ; and also wa
ters. To these Correspondents in the Natural World,

we are tc add such things as are prepared and fabricated
of them by human skill and industry for the general use
of Man, as food of different kinds, vestments, houses,
temples, with many other things.
105. The things that are above the earth, are the sun,
moon, stars, and also in the atmosphere, as clouds, rain,
vapours, thunder, lightening, &c. are respectively corres
pondent ; as also such as are occasioned by the presence
or absence of the Sun, as light and shade, heat and cold :
in like manner those which are determined by its mo
tions, distances, and variations, as the seasons of spring,
summer, autumn, and winter, together with the diurnal
periods of morning, noon, evening, and night.
106. In a word, all things that exist in nature, from
the least to the greatest, are Correspondences ; (76) and
that because this world, together with the whole of its
furniture, exists and subsists from the Spiritual world,
and both from the Deity : it is said here to subsist also
thence, as every thing subsists by that which is the cause
of its existence, as its subsistence is no other than the
continuation of its existence, and because it cannot sub
sist from itself, but from something prior to itself, and so
on from its first cause, from which, if it be separated, it
must perish, and be annihilated.
107. Every thing is said to correspond, which exists
and subsists in Nature according to the divine order ;
now divine good proceeding from the Lord, is that which
constitutes divine order, for it begins and proceeds from
him through the Heavens to this World, where it ter
minates in its lowest form ; and all things here, which are
according to the laws of such order, are called Corres
pondences, viz. all things that are good for use, for good
and useful mean the same ; whereas the form or distinc-

only in a few ; and first in the Animal Kingdom : and
here, what wonderful examples of science present them

shew in collecting their honey from various flowers, and
in forming their waxen cells wherein to deposit it for food
for themselves and their offspring during the approach
ing winter ! How do they wait upon the queen bee when
the lays her eggs, dispose of them in proper apartments,
and carefully provide for the safety of her future proge
ny ! How excellent is their form of government, in which
every one from an inward Teacher knows his proper
place, and where, by a strict administrarion of justice, all
the useful Members of the Society are protected, and the
unprofitable ones expelled with the deprivation of their
wings ! not to mention many other wonderful particulars
of knowledge derived to them from above, in order to
the use and benefit of Man; thus tHeir wax, among other
uses, being formed into candles, affords us light ; and
their honey supplies us with a grateful and salutary con
fection. How great is the sagacity of those worms,
\vhich extract their nourishment from the leaves of trees,

of their own working, where, as in a womb, they deposit
and nourish their tender young ; whilst some taking the

and after finishing their appointed task, assume another
body, change their element, become volatile, and wing
the soft air, chuse their mates, lay their eggs, and trans
mit their nature to a succeeding race ! How wisely are
all the birds of the air instructed where to seek and find
the particular food that is proper for them ; how to build
their nests differently according to their kinds, to hatch
their eggs, and to provide for their young till they arc able
to take care ofthemselves ! And how early do they rightly
distinguish between their enemies and friends, shunning
the former, and associating with the latter ! Not to men
tion here in particular the wonderful provision observa
ble in their eggs, both for the formation and nutrition of
their embryo young through the different stages of their
growth, as also innumerable other wonderful particulars.
Now who that has but a spark of reason can deny these
things to proceed from that Wisdom which is from above,
and to descend from the Spiritual World, to which the Na
tural is subservient, by cloathing those things with mate
rial forms, which are Spiritual in their several essences,
or, in other words, to give effects to Spiritual causes? The
reason why this kind of knowledge is innate in the other
living creatures, and not in Manj though far more excel
lent than them, is because they stand in that order of life
to which they were appointed.; nor could they destroy
that which is in them by Influx from the Spiritual
World, as being destitute of reason ; but it is otherwise
with Man, who, having perverted his more exalted pow
ers by transgressing the order of his nature, was thence
forward to be born in mere ignorance, that so he might
be reformed, and restored to the order in which he was
created (which was the order of Heaven) by the means
appointed by God for that end.

drawn from the growth of small seeds into trees, putting

all the uses of which would exceed the bounds of human
science ; and as these originate from the Spiritual World
or Heaven, which is in the human form, as shewn before,
so have they all relation to or Correspondence with some
thing in Man, as is known to some few in the learned
World. That all things in the Vegetable Kingdom are
thus Correspondent, I have had experimental evidence
of; for oftentimes when walking in gardens I have in
spected the trees, flowers, and plants therein, I have had
a sight of their correspondents or correlatives in the Spi
ritual World, and in conversation with those to whom
these signatures belonged, have received the explanation
of them from their particular descent, genius, and cha
racter.*
1 10. As to those spiritual things in heaven, to which
natural things in this world correspond, no one now can
understand them, but by a particular illumination from
above, forasmuch as the science of Correspondence is.
at this time totally lost amongst us ; however, 1 shall il
lustrate this doctrine of Correspondence between Natural
and Spiritual things by some few examples of the latter,
* As this passage is somewhat obscure in the Original, it necessa-
yily renders the Translation of it more difficult ; however, the subr
stance of it means, that the Author had a satisfying knowledge of
certain properties and qualities in some classes of the Vegetable
Kingdom, as corresponding with and representative of certain cha
racters, dispositions, or attributes in particular persons; now, whe
ther this be called Analogy, Correspondency, or Emblematical Simi
litude, it will amount nearly to the same. From this copious source
of resemblances in nature to the Microcosm, or little world of man,
the art of poetry confessedly borrows its most striking beauties ; and
it formed a considerable part of the language of the ancient Eastern
nations ; and it is also well known, that the sacred Oracles of truth
do instruct us by such similitudes (Hosea xii. 10.) in numberless
places, and represent things, both divine and human, by images or
resemblances thereof in the Animal, Mineral, and Vegetable King
doms of this our natural World: thus the wicked are described by
thorns, to denote their oppressions and other pernicious qualities.;
whilst the candour, humility, and lovely simplicity of the true Church
and its members, are figured to us by their correspondent natural
emblems in the lillics of the valley. But the doctrine of Correspon
dency will be opened in a deeper ground, and more significant sense,
under a variety of striking illustrations, in the following and other
works of the Author. Tr.

Heaven and Hell. 109
as generally known here below. The beasts of the earth
in general, not only the tame and useful ones, but also
the wild and unprofitable, correspond to the affections of
the human mind, the former to its good affections, the
latter to its evil ones : in particular, oxen and calves cor
respond to the affections of the Natural mind ; but sheep
and lambs to those of the Spiritual mind ; whereas the
winged tribes, according to their respective kinds, cor
respond to the Intellectual part in both :
(78) hence it
was, that animals of various kinds, as oxen, calves, rams,
sheep, goats, lambs, and also pigeons, and turtle doves,
were appointed among the Israelites, who were a typical
or representative church, for sacrifices and burnt-offer
ings, as in such religious institution they were represen
tative of spiritual things, and accordingly were received in
heaven acccording to correspondency. That animals, ac
cording to their difference as to genus and species, stand
for the affections, is because they are endued with life ;
now the life of every creature is from the fire of love or
affection, and according to the quality thereof; and such
also is their innate knowledge respectively: man
also, considered merely in the animal part of his nature,
is constituted in like manner, and as such is compared
to them ; thus it is common to say of any one that is of
meek and gentle disposition, that he is sheepish, or lamb
like ; to call a rugged or rapacious man, a bear or wolf;
and to give the name of fox or serpent to the subtle and
crafty, and so on.
111. Correspondency obtains in like manner in the
Vegetable Kingdom : thus a garden in general corres
ponds to heaven in respect to understanding and wisdom;
(78) That the beasts by Correspondence signify the affections,
good or bad, as the former are of the tame and protitablc, or of the
wild and unprofitable kind*, see n. 45,46— 3519,9280. This is also il

1 IQ -A treatise concerning
wherefore heaven is called the garden of God, and Par
adise, (79) and by man the Heavenly paradise. Trees,
according to their different kinds respectively, corres
pond to perceptions, and the cognitions of things good
and true ; and therefore the ancients, who were in the
knowledge of Correspondency, celebrated their religious
worship in groves; (80) and therefore it is that we have
mention made in Scripture so often of trees, and that
heaven, the church, and man, are in so many places com
pared to them, as to the vine, the olive, the cedar, and
others, and our good works to fruit. The different kinds
of food also, which are prepared from these, but more
especially from the seeds of the field, correspond also to
the affections of the good and the true, as theseafford nour
ishment to the spiritual, as earthly foods do to the natur
al life. (81) Hence it is that bread is the Correspbndent
to affection respecting every particular good, as it is in a
more eminent manner the support of life, and is used to
signify the whole of food ; and in this universal sense it
is, that the Lord calls himself the Bread of Life ; and
likewise on this account, bread was appointed for a sa
cred symbol in the Israelitish church, and was placed on
a table in the tabernacle under the name of Shew-Bread,
or the Bread of Faces ; and also that the whole of divine
worship by sacrifices and burnt-offerings was called
Bread ; lastly, it is from Correspondency, that bread and
wine are used in the Holy Supper, as it iscelebrated in
the Christian church. (82) These few instances may
serve as a farther illustration of Correspondency.

Heaven and Hell. 1 1 1
112. We shall here briefly shew how a conjunction is
formed between heaven and this world by means of Cor
respondences. The kingdom of the Lord is a kingdom
of ends and uses, or in other words, a kingdom, the ad
ministration whereof is to the end of uses; consequently
the universe is so constituted by its Omnipotent Creator,
that all things therein should be fitted with forms and
powers to serve as means to produce and realize such
uses, first in heaven, then in the general system of this
world ; and so on by a successive gradation to the least
and lowest departments of nature ; whence it follows,
that the Correspondence between Natural and Spiritual
things, or of this world and heaven, subsists by uses as
the means of their conjunction, and that the external
forms of these uses do correspond and conjoin them, ac
cording to the degrees of their utility. All things in this
natural world throughout its three kingdoms, as far as
they stand in their established order, may be considered
as so many forms of uses, or formed effects proceeding
from use to use ; and so circumstanced, are Correspon
dences .: with respect to man ; as far forth as he lives ac
cording to the divine order, or in love towards the Lord,
and in charity towards his neighbour, so far his actions
are forms of uses, and as such so many correspondents,
whereby he communicates with and is joined to heaven ;
for to love the Lord and our neighbour, is, in a general
sense of the expression, to perform uses: (83) moreover,

U 2 A treatise concerning
let it be remembered, that it is through man (as the pro
per medium of their connection) that the conjunction is
formed betwixt the Natural and Spiritual worlds, as he is
the subject of both, (see before n. 57) and therefore as far
forth as any man is spiritual, in such degree he is
the meduim of this conjunction ; and as far forth as he
is natural and not -spiritual, he is not so nevertheless,
even in this latter case, the Divine Influx is continued to
this world, and what belongs to it in man, though it be
not received into his rational part.
113. As all things which continue in the Divine Or
der correspond with heaven, so all things which are con
trary to the Divine Order correspond with hell : the for
mer have relation to things good and true ; the latter to
such as are evil and false.
1 14. A word more as touching the science of Corres
pondences, and its use. It has been said before, that
heaven or the spiritual world is joined to the natural
world by correspondences ; hence it is that man here has
the power of holding communication with heaven ; for
as the blessed Angels form not their ideas like men from
Natural, but Spiritual things ; so when men are gifted
with the knowledge of Correspondences, they can think
in like manner with the angels, and be joined with them
in the spiritual or inward man. The Holy Scriptures are'
written intirely according to the truth of Corresponden
cy, (84) in order that we may hereby have communica
tion with heaven ; and therefore, were any one rightly
possessed of the science of Correspondences, such a man
would thoroughly understand the Scriptures in their
spiritual sense, (as all things therein spoken of correspond)
their effects) were prior to the formation of our bodily organs, by a
Divine Influx through heaven, n, 4223, 4926. That also the interior
faculties of the human mind, when attained to reason, arc formed for
a progression from use to uso, n. 1964, 68 15, 9296. That therefore
man is to be estimated according to the uses that he fulfils, n. 1568,
3570—6938, 10284. That uses are the ends for which all things were
created, n.3565 —6815. That use is the first and last, and so the whole
end of man, n. 1964.
(84) That the Scriptures are to be understood aecording to the
doctrine of correspondences, n. 8615. That hereby man has *com-
munication with heaven, n. 2899, 6943—10375, 1052.

and would thereby come at the knowledge of such se-
orets, as cannot be learned from their literal sense alone ;
for as in the written word there is a literal, so also there
is a spiritual sense ; (85) the literal sense concerns the
things of this world ; the spiritual, such as are heavenly ;
and as a conjunction is formed, by the relation of Corres
pondences, between heaven and earth, therefore such a
dispensation is vouchsafed to us, in which all things in
both worlds do perfectly correspond, and answer the one
to the other, as face to face in a class.
115. I have learned from heaven, that among the
most ancient inhabitants of our earth, there were certain
heavenly men, who were in the true knowledge of Cor-
respondency, and whose conception and thoughts were
according thereto, to whom the visible things of this
world served as so many mediums of discerning spirit-
ual things, and who as such associated and conversed
with angels, and that through them was kept up a com
munication between heaven and earth ; whence this was
called the Golden Age ; of which mention as made by
ancient writers, who relate, that in those times theinha.
bitants of heaven became the visitors and guests ol men,
and familiarly conversed with them, as one friend with an
other; but that to these succeeded another race of men,
who were not in the same intuitive knowledge ot Cor
respondences, but only understood them scientifically :
that however, there was a communication between hea
ven and earth in their days, but not so open an intimate
as the former : this was called the Silver Age. In the
ne*t generation were those who retained some specula
te knowledge of Correspondences, but did not think and
discern according thereto, as being only in Natural and
not in Spiritual food like the former ; and their period.
wTs called the Copper Age. In the following tunes men
became^successively merely external, and at length cor-
S sensual, and without all knowledge ot Corres
[xmdency, and nearly so of all heavenly things. Hut

CONCERNING THE SUN IN HEAVEN.
•
116. IN heaven the Sun of this world appears not,
ilor any thing that proceeds from
it,
as being natural, for
nature takes its beginning or rise proximately from this
our sun, and whatever so proceeds from
it
is
termed na
tural; whereas that which
is
spiritual, as heaven,
is
above
nature, and therefore intirely distinct from all that
is
called
natural, neither
is
there any communication betwixt
them, but by correspondency. This distinction will be
understood by what has been said before in n. 38, con
cerning degrees
:
and what
is
here meant by communi
cation, by'what appears in the two preceding articles con
cerning Correspondences.
H7. But though neither the Sun of this world, nor
any thing proceeding from
it,
is
seen in heaven, yet nei
ther
is
heaven without its Sun, Light, and Heat
;
nay,
therein are all things that are in this world, with innu
merable others, though of
a
different origin; for the
things in heaven are spiritual, but those on earth are na
tural. The Sun of heaven
is
the Lord, the light of
it
is
Divine Truth, and the heat of
it
Divine Love, proceed-

dark spot, in opposition to the Heavenly Sun, and the

good, n. 113, 1551 —'J881. That silver signifies spiritual good, or
truth from
a
celestial origin, n. 1551, 1552,2954, 5648. The copper

ing from the Lord as a Sun ; and from him as their divine
source do all things proceed, which exist and appear in
the Heavens ; but concerning the light and heat in hea
ven, and whatever is produced by them, shall be treated
of in the following articles ; but here first as touching its
Sun. Now the Lord appears in heaven as a Sun, foras
much as he is that Divine Love from which all spiritual
things derive their existence, and also through the oedi-
um of this our mundane Sun, all natural tlungs likewise;
he is that Love whose brightness is as the Sun.
118. That the Lord actually appears in heaven as a
Sun, has not only been told me by the angels, but also
been granted me to see myself at certain times ; and
therefore I shall here briefly relate what I myself hive so
heard and seen of this wonderful appearance. The Lord
appears in heaven as a Sun, not as horizontally in hea
ven, but high above the heavens ; not over the head or
vertical, but before the faces of the angels in a middle al
titude : he appears in two places, in one before the right
eye, in the other before the left eye, and that at a consi
derable distance : before the right eye he appears as a per
fect Sun, of aglow and magnitude similar to those of our
mundane Sunj but before the left eye he appears not as
a Sun, but as a Moon, of the like shine, but bright
er, and of the like magnitude with our Moon, and as
surrounded with many lesser Moons, each in like man
ner having its particular glittering lustre. That the
Lord appears in two places so differently, is because his
appearance is to every one according to their quality and
degree of their recipiency respectively, and therefore
otherwise to those who receive him in the good principle
of love, than to those who receive him in the good of
faith ; to the former his appearance is like that of a fiery
refulgent Sun, and they are the angels ofhis Celestial king
dom ; but to the latter as a pale but bright Moon, and
these are the angels of his Spiritual kingdom ;* and to
* The Author, as observed before, distinguishes the third aud se
cond heavens by the names of Celestial and Spiritual; the third or
celestial as the highest, the Angels of which excel in Divine Love ;
and the second or spiritual, the angels of which are more especially
charactered by fajth and love to their ricighbour. T r.

115 A treatise concerning
both in degrees respectively to their recipiency :
(87) the
reason of which
is,
because the good of love corresponds
to fire, and therefore fire in
a
spiritual sense signifies
Love: and the good of faith corresponds to light,
in
a
spi
ritual sense, and signifies Faith. (88) That he appears in
the plane of or before the eyes,
is
because the interior of
the mind manifests itself by the eyes, the good of
love through the right eye, and the good of faith
through the left eye
;
(89) for that which
is
on the right
side of angels or men corresponds to that good, which
is
the source of truth
;
and that which
is
on the left, to that
truth which issues from it. (90) The good of faith, as to
its essence,
is
that truth which proceeds from the good
principle.
119. Hence
it
is,
that inthe Scriptures the Lord, with
regard to love,
is
compared to the Sun
;
and with regard
to faith, to the Moon
;
and also that our love to the Lord,
as proceeding from him,
is
signified by the Sun
;
and our
faith in the Lord, as his gift,
is
signified by the Moon, as
in
the following places
:

elsewhere : in which places, by the Sun is signified Love,
and by the Moon Faith, and by the Stars the Knowledges
\cognitones] of good and truth, (91) which are then said
to be darkened, to lose their light, and to fall from heaven,
when the things signified by them cease among men.
That the Lord appears as a sun in heaven, may also be
gathered from his transformation before Peter, James, and
John, when " his face shined as the Sun ;" Matt. xvii. 2.
Such was his appearance to his disciples, when they were
out of the body, and in the light of heaven. From some
knowledge of this truth it was, that the ancients, who
formed a representative church, in their more solemn
adorations turned their faces to the East, where the sun
rises ; and also gave a like aspect to their temples.
120. The greatness of Divine Love may in a sort be
conceived by us, from its being compared to the Sun of
our world, though indeed it is far more ardent ; and there
fore the Lord, as under the manifestation of his Divinity
by a Sun, tempers the ardour of it in the progression of its

rent radiant circles round the Sun : the angels, moreover
are surrounded by a kind of thin transparent vapour, to
enable them to sustain the Divine Influx, (92) according
to their respectivity of which, is the nearer or greater
distance of the angels ; thus such of them as excel most
in the good of Love are nearest to this Divine Sun,
whilst they who are charactered by the good of Faith are
more remote from it : but as to those who are in no kind
of good, of which sort are the infernal spirits, they are at
an immense distance, and that in proportion to the de
gree oftheir opposition to al) good. (93)
121. When the Lord appears in heaven with the an
gels, as he often does, he appears not as cloathed with
the Sun, but in an angelical form, though distinguished
from the angels by a Divine Glory radiating from his
countenance ; not that this is properly his appearance in
person, for that is always as cloathed with the Sun, but
it is his (apparent form, or) presence by aspect ; for in
heaven it is common for the blessed beings to appear in
the termination of the beholder's view, though it be far
distant from the place where they actually are; and this
apparent presence is called the presence of the Internal
sight, of which hereafter. I also myself have seen the
Lord without the Sun, and in a lesser degree of altitude,
in an angelical form ; and also near, in a like form, with a
splendid countenance ; and once also in the midst of the
angels as a flaming stream of light (Jubar stammeum.)

Moon in like manner, in opposition to the Heavenly
Moon ; and that because the element of fire in this
world corresponds to the Love of Self, and the light
proceeding from it to falsehood the issue of that Love :
now the Love of Self is diametrically opposite to Divine
Love, as falsehood is to Divine Truth : and all that is
opposite to Divine Love and Divine Truth is as dark*
ness to the angels : therefore it
is,
that to worship the
Sun and Moon of this world, and to bow down to them,
denotes in Scripture self-lore, and falsehood, and error
derived therefrom, and that all such should be cut off;

123. As the Lord's appearance in heaven
is
as
a
Sun
from the Divine Love that
is
in him, and proceeds from
him, therefore all the angels constantly turn their faces
towards him
;
they in the Celestial kingdom towards him
as
a
Sun, and the Spiritual kingdom towards him as
a
Moon
;
whereas the infernal spirits turn themselves to
that blackness and darkness which are opposite thereto,
having their backs towards the Lord, forasmuch as all
that are in hell are
in
the love of self and of the world,
and as such in opposition to his Divine Majesty. Such of
them as face to that dark orb, which
is
representative of
the Sun of this world, are in the hells behind, and are
called Genii
:
but they which face to that which
is
repre
sentative of the Moon, are in the foremost hells, and are
called Spirits: hence
it
is, that all who are
in
hell are said
to be in darkness, and all who are in heaven to be in
light: darkness corresponds to the false, as proceeding
from evil, and light to the true, as proceeding from
the good principle. That the inhabitants of the other
worlds then turn faces as before- mentioned,
is
because
all there direct their view to those things which corres-

120 A treatise concerning
pond to their interior, or what they love most ; for the
faces of angels and spirits manifest and are directed by
their interior dispositions and states ; and, as ob
served before, in the Spiritual world the four cardinal
points are not fixed, as in the Natural, but are determin
ed by the aspect of the face : nor is it otherwise with the
spirit of man in this world ; for it turns its aspect to or
from the Lord, according as it is in the love of him and
its neighbour, or in the love ofthe self and world ; but this
man is ignorant of, while be continues in this Natural
world, whtre the four quarters are determined by the ris
ing and setting of the Sun : but as this is difficult of com
prehension, it will be illustrated in the sequel of this
work, where the Four Quarters, Space, and Time in hea
ven, will be treated of.
124. As the Lord is the Sun of heaven, and all things
there point to him as to their Divine original, so conse
quently he is the common centre of all direction and de
termination :
(95) and hence it further follows, that all
things both in the heavens above, and in the earth be
neath, are present to him, and under his government.
125. From the things here laid down will more clear
ly appear what has been asserted and proved in some pre
ceding articles concerning the Lord, as the God ofHea
ven, n. 2. to 6. That the Virtue ifhis Divinity consti
tutes Heaven, n. 13. to 19. That there is a Correspon
dence between all Things in this fVorld and Heaven, and

our natural Sun ; whereas the heavenly Light far exceeds
the meridian light of this world : 1 have seen

at those times of its diminution, which answer to our
times of evening and night.* At first I was surprized to
hear the angels affirm, that the light of this world war,
but as shade compared to that of heaven ; but 1 can now
assert the truth of it from occular evidence, and that the
splendor of it exceeds all description : the things which I
have seen in heaven was by this light, and consequently
with greater clearness and distinction than any which are
seen on earth, if
127. The Light of heaven is not a natural light, like
that of our world, but spiritual, for it proceeds from the
Lord as a Sun, and that Sun is Divine Love, as was
shewed in the preceding article. This emanation from
the Lord, as a Sun, is called in heaven by the name of
Divine Truth, and is in its essence and source Divine
Good united with Divine Truth ; and hence the angels
have their Light and Heat, the former from the Divine
Truth, the latter from the Divine Good or Love, which,
like their divine original, are both Spiritual, not Natu
ral. (96)
128. That Divine Truth is the light of the angels, is
because the angels are Spiritual Beings, and such see
things by the light of their proper Sun, as natural beings
do by the light that is proper to them ; and as Divine
* It is certain that the great Milton had some idea of such varia
tion in heaven, by the following lines :

" Though darkness there might well

The above quotation is not adduced by way of authority, but to
shew that certain notices of heavenly things are impressed on soau
minds by a kind of heavenly irradiation or Influx.

122 A treatise concerning
Truth is to the angels a source of Intellectual sight, so
this by Influx produces their external vision ; and thus
the light of the Divine Sun illuminates all things in hea
ven both inwardly and outwardly. (97) And as such is
the original of light in heaven, so does it likewise differ
in degree, according to the different reception of Divine
Truth from the Lord in the angels, or, in other words,
according to their different qualities or measures, as to
understanding and wisdom ;* for these are not the same
in all, but different not only in the Celestial and Spiritual
kingdoms, but also in the several societies in each of those
kingdoms : thus, with respect to the External vision, the
light ofthe Celestial kingdom appears of a Flame Colour,
as the angels therein receive their light from the Lord as
a Sun : but in the Spiritual kingdom it appears of a White
or Silver Colour, as the angels of the latter receive it from
the Lord as a Moon. See above n. 118. Nor is the light
t he same to one society as to another : thus, they who are
in the center have a larger measure of it than they who are
in the circumference ; and so in proportion according to
their distances respectively, n. 43. In a word according
to the degree in which the angels are recipient of Divine
Truth, or, in other words, according ro the measure of
their understanding and wisdom from the Lord, such is
their light :
(98) however, all the angels of hsaven are
called Angels of Light.
129. As the Lord in the heavens is Divine Truth ; and
as Divine Truth there appears in the form of Light, there
fore he is called in Scripture The Light ; as likewise all
Truth that proceeds from him, as in the following places:
"Jesus said, I am the light of the world; hethatfollow

says :

was because they represented Divine Truth as proceed

signify truths ; (99) and to this purpose are those words
of David :
" O Lord thou cloathest thyself with light, as

124; A treatise concerning
130. That the light in heaven is Spiritual, and the
same with Divine Truth, may also be gathered from
hence, viz. that there is also a Spiritual light in man,
which at times illuminates his mind with the knowledge
Of Divine Truth, according to his class in the school of
wisdom. The Spiritual light in man is the light of his
understanding, as far as it has truths for its objects, which
he disposes analytically in order, forms into reasons, and
from thence draws conclusions: (100) the natural man
indeed knows not that this is a real light by which we so
speculate, because he sees not either inwardly or out
wardly ; but nevertheless, many know it to be so, and
have a distinct perception of its difference from that na
tural light which they are in, whose thoughts ar« not spi
ritual, but natural only ; of which sort are all those who
have regard only to things of this world, and ascribe all
to nature; whereas they that think spiritually, think of
heavenly things, and ascribe all to God : and that it is a
real and true light which illuminates the minds, and to
tally distinct from that which we call natural light, has
often been given me to discern, by a gradual ascent of
the mind therein; and according to the -degrees of
such elevation, I have been given to perceive things,
of which I had not the least perception before, and so on
to higher things, which far exceeded my conception by
any powers of the natural understanding ; and sometimes
I have been much disturbed and offended at my prior
ignorance of things, which I sawwith such convincing

evidence by a Spiritual light :
(101) and as light and. vi
sion are thus proper fo the Intellectual part, so by corres
pondence we apply to it the same terms that we make
use of in speaking of corporeal sight ; thus it is common
ly said of the understanding, when it is in the perception
of any truth, that it sees

or
is
in the light of it; and so
on the contrary, when

Divine Truth, or, in

;
con

be illuminated with an increase of understanding and
wisdom, mean the same thing;

of the angels
is
in exact proportion to their understand

:
and as light in heaven [in its essence]
is
Divine Wisdom, so does
it
manifest the particular dis

ed things the face
is
the index of the mind, and reveals
all that
is
within
:
nay, the more interior angels love to
have
it
so, as they harbour nothing but what is good in
their intentions and wills
:
but the case
is
far otherwise
with the infernal spirits
;
for as they are void of all good
within, they dread being viewed in the manifesting
Light of heaven
;
and (which will be thought very
strange) though they appear to one another in the regu
lar human form, yet when viewed by the heavenly
Light, they appear as monsters, with ugly faces and
hideous shapes, corresponding to the evil that
is
with
in them respectively
:

l (26 A treatise concerning
beautiful human form according to his good ; but if in
the evil principle, he appears to them deformed and ugly
according to his evil ; for all things are made manifest in
the light of heaven , forasmuch as it is the same with Di
vine Truth.
132. As Divine Truth is the essence of the heavenly
light therefore all truths every-where whether within or
without the angels, and within or without the heavens,
have a lucid form, but the latter in a less degree ; for
truths without the heavens have a cold lucid aspect, like
Snow without Heat, as not having their essence from
good, like truths within the heavens ; wherefore such
kind of frigid light disappears upon the breaking in upon
them of the heavenly Light, and is turned into darkness,
ifevil be concealed under it: this I myself have sometimes
seen, as also many other memorable things concerning
shining truths, which I here pass over.
133. I proceed to say something concerning the Heat
of heaven, which in its essence is Love, for it proceeds
from the Lord as a Sun, and that Sun in its essence is
Divine Love proceeding from the Lord, as has been
shewed in a former article ; so that the Heat of heaven is
equally Spiritual with the Light of heaven, seeing the ori
gin of both in the same. (103) There are two things
which proceed from the Lord as a Sun, Divine Truth
and Divine Good: the former has its manifestation in
heaven as Light, and the latter as Heat, but both in
such a State of union, as to form only one and the
same thing; nevertheless in the angels they are dis
tinct, as some angels receive more of the Divine
Good, and some on the other hand, more of the Divine
Truth ; they of the former class belong to the Celestial
kingdom of the Lord, and those of the latter to his Spiri
tual kingdom ; but such among them as receive §
of both
in equal measure, are the most perfect of all.
134. The heat, as well as Light of heaven, varies
throughout the regions of bliss, not being the same in
( 103) That there is a twofold origin of heat and light, the one from
the sun of this world, the other from the celestial sun, n. 3338, 5215,
7324. That heat from the Lord as a sun, is that spiritual affection
which proceeds from love, it. 366, 3643. Hence, that spiritual heat
in its ess«nce Is love, n. 2146, 3338, 3339, 6314.

the Celestial with that oT the Spiritual kingdom ; nay, it
differs in every Society in both, as well in degree as qual
ity ; it is more intense and pure in the Celestial kingdom,
as the angels therein receive more of the Divine Good ;
but less intense and pure in the Spiritual kingdom, as
the angels therein receive less of Divine Good than of
Divine truth ; nay, it varies in every particular Society
respectively, according to their difference of recipiency.
The Hells also have their Heat, but of an impure nature:
(104) the Heat in- Heaven, represented by the Sacred and
Celestial fire, and the Heat of Hell, by the profane and in
fernal fire, are both correspondents of Love ; the former
of love to the Lord and our neighbour, and of every par.
ticular affection proceeding therefrom; the latter of the
Love of Self and the World, and of all their concommi-
tant concupisances. That Love is Heat from a spiritual
source, is evident from its effects ; for how does any one
feel himself warmed by its influence, according to its de
gree and quality ; nay, how hot when crossed in this pas
sion ? Hence those common forms of speaking; to take
fire, to glow, to burn, and the like, when we would express
the fervors of a lawful, or unlawful love.
135. That Love proceeding from the Lord as a Sun
is felt in heaven as Heat, is because the Divine principle,
or fire of Love within the Angels, excites that sensation
in their external form, for Love and Heat mutually cor
respond both in kind and degree, as was observed before.
The heat of this worlcf finds no place in heaven, as being
of a gross nature, and not spiritual; though it is other
wise with ys men, as partaking of both worlds at the same
time, the Natural and the Spiritual; and therefore have
not only a Spiritual Heat adapted to spiritual affections,
but also a corporeal sensation of Heat, derived by Influx
therefrom, as well as from the natural fire of this world.
The Correspondence between these different kinds of
Heat is manifest in the loves of the brute animals, the chief
(104) That the hells also have respectively their heat, but of an
impure kind, n. 1773, 2757, 3340; and that it yields a foetid exere-
mentitious smell ; and in the lowest hells like that which proceeds
from a putrid carcase, n. 814, 815 —944, 5394.

128 A treatise concerning
of which is that of propagating their species, and which
operates in them according to its concurrence with out
solar heat in the spring and summer seasons ; but funda
mental is the error of those, who suppose that the Heat
of this material world can, by any Influxive power in it
self, beget love, [which is of a Spiritual origin] for all
Influx is from Spirit to Matter, not from Matter to Spirit;
the former being according to the established laws of Di
vine Order, but the latter contrary thereto. (105)
136. Angels are endowed with Intellect and Free
Will, as well as men ; the former they derive from the
Light of heaven, or, in other words, from Divine Truth
and Wisdom ; and the latter from the Heat of heaven, or
jthat Divine principle of goodness which produces Divine
Love ; however, the essence of the angelical life is from
Heat, or so far only from Light, as Light is animated by
Heat ; and that this is so, appears evidently in that life in-
tirely ceases upon a total extinction of Heat. The case
is exactly similar with respect to that kind of faith which
is void of love, or that kind of truth which is void of
good, as the true of Faith \yerum Jiedi] answers to Light,
and the good of Love to Heat. (106) This may be illus
trated from the Heat and Light of this world, to which
those of heaven correspond, as from the conjunction of
the Light and Heat ofthis world, which happens in spring
time and summer, all things on earth are animated and
flourish ; but from Light without Heat, as in winter no'
thing thrives ; but Vegetables are torpid, and as it were,

without life. From Correspondence herein, Heaven is
called Paradise or Garden, seeing that Truth is there
joined to Good, or Faith to Love, in the same manner
that Light and Heat are conjoined on earth in the spring
time. This may serve to illustrate what has been laid
down before under its proper head, n. 13 to 19; viz.
Xhat the divine ruling principle with the angels, is Love
to the Lord, and Charity or Love towards their neigh
bour.
137. It is said in the Gospel, (John i. 1, 3, 4, 10^4.)
" In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
" with God, and the Word was God : all things were
" marie by him, and without him nothing was made that
" was made. In him was the life, and the life was the
" light of men. He was in the world, and the world was
" made by him. And the Word was made flesh, and
" dwelt among us, and we saw his glory." It is evident
that by the Word is meant the Loid; for it is said, that
the Word was made flesh ; but what we are to understand
by the Wordin a more especial sense, has not as yet been
explained, and therefore shall now be declared. By the
Word, in the places before cited, we are to understand Di
vine Truth as in the Lord, and from the Lord, (107) and
which there also is called Light, as signifying the same
with Divine Truth, as has been shewed in the proceed
ing numbers : and that all things were created and made
by Divine" Truth will appear from what follows. In hea
ven all power belongs to Divine Truth alone, (108) and
it is from thence that the Angels are called Powers, and
(107) That Word in Scripture language has various significations;
as speech, operation of the mind, real existence, and in its highest
sense, divine truth, and the Lord, n. 9987. That Word signifies di
vine truth, n. 2803, 2884—7830,9987. That it signifies the Lord,
n. 2533,2859.

power, n. 6948, 8200. That all power in heaven belongs to truth, as
"united to and proceeding from good, n. 3091, 3563 — 10019, 10182.

tion of divine truth from the Lord, n. 9639, That hence, in some

:*
and as the angels derive
their angelical nature from their being recipients of Di
vine Truth, so heaven must be from the same origin, in
asmuch as they constitute heaven. That there should be
such
a
kind of Omnipotence in Divine Truth, must ap
pear incredible to such as hold the latter to consist only
in thoughts and ideas of the mind, or the agreement of
certain propositions, which have no other power than
what arises from the assent and obedience of those that
embrace them
;
whereas Divine Truth has power in itself,
insomuch that by
it
was created heaven and this world,
and all things that are therein: this may be illustrated
by two comparisons, viz. By the power of Truth and
Good
in
man, and by the power of Light and Heat from
the Sun of this world
:
with respect to the former,
it
is
to
be noted, that whatever

it
from
his Intellect and Will
;
from his Will by Good, and from
his Intellect by Truth
;
for all things in the Will
have some relation to Good, and all things in the Under
standing some relation to Truth

it

ifig to which it is formed. As to the other instance re
specting the power ofHeat and Light, as proceeding from
the sun of this world; it is to be observed, that all things
that vegetate on earth, as trees, plants, flowers, grain, and
seeds of all kinds, owe their vegetation thereto, and ma
nifest the power of the solar influence ; but how much
greater must be the power of that Divine Light, which,
in its es.\ence, is Divine Truth ; and of that Divine
Heat, which, in its essence, is Divine Good, and from
which the heavenly world derives its existence, and
consequently this our world, as proceeding from the
heavenly, as has been shewed before ? Thus much
may serve to illustrate this great truth. That by
the Word all things were made, and that without him
nothing was made that was made ; and also . that
the world was made by him, viz. by Divine Truth
from the Lord. (110) Hence it is,
that in the Book
of the Creation mention
is
first made of Light, and after
wards of those things that proceed from it, Gen.
i.
3,
4
;
and also that all things both in heaven and earth have rela
tion to good and truth, and to the conjunction of both, in
the order of creation and use.
139.
It
is
to be noted, that the Divine Good and the
Divine Truth, which are in the .heavens from the Lord
as
a
Sun,* are not in, bntfrom the Lord
;
for in him on

by divine truth all things were created and made, n. 2803, 2884,

N. B. The Author, in the above note, speaks of the divine exis
tence as distinguished, and proceeding from the divine essence from
eternity to eternity, and as giving existence to all other things. Eve
ry thing has an essence and form, for without essence there could be
no form; and without the form the essence would be unmanifested,
and therefore unknowable
:
they are as soul and body to each other
:
the essence indeed
is
of prior consideration, yet in the divine nature
they are co-existent and co-equal, and differ only with respect to ma
nifestation. But

dare not be confident that
I

132 A treatise toncerning
Jy is divine Love, which is the essence [esse] from whence
they exist : now to exist, and to proceed from an essence,
mean the same thing, as may be illustrated by compari
son with the Sun of this world ; as for instance, the Heat
and Light in this world are not in the Sun, but from the
Sun : for in the Sun is only fire, and from it they derive
their existence and procession.
140. Forasmuch as the Lord (under his manifestation
and appearance in heaven) as a Sun, is Divine Love; and
as Divine Love constitutes the very essence of Divine
Good, so the Divine Emanation from him in heaven
is,
for distinction's sake, called Divine Truth, though,
in
reality,
it
is
the Divine Good united with Divine Truth
;
and this, in quality of its Divine Operation and Energy,
is
called the Holy Spirit
(
Sanctum procedens.
J
the Infinite Eternal God (unknowable in himself, as above the com
prehension of all created intellect) should manifest himself in ap
pearances, human or other, accommodated to the limited capacities
of his creatures in all worlds
:
nor consequently will
it
be difficult for
such to represent visibly to the angels the invisible glory of the di
vine essence, and lo serve as
a
medium or vehicle, under God, of
communicating spiritual blessings to spiritual beings, both as to soul
and body
;
especially as such
a
constitution in the heavenly world so
aptly corresponds with the rule of analogy, and so fitly adapts itselft»
our familiar ideas concerning the Divine wisdom, power,and goodness,
as manifested in the constitution of this our solar system. That na
tural heat and natural light arc the correspondent images of spiritu
al love and spiritual truth,
is
confirmed to us by the received use and
application of these similitudes or emblems in all languages
:
now
if
natural heat and light are derived to us from
a
natural sun, where
is
room for doubting, that their spiritual correspondent relatives, love
and truth, should in like manner proceed from
a
spiritual sun, though
mediately from the Lord
?
It can only be from the newness of Uiis re
presentation of the subjects before us, that
it
is of difficult admission
to the mind of any reader; let
it
only be familiarized, and his objec
tions will presently vanish.
I
shall conclude this note with observing
that this our natural sun, considered in all its animating and com
forting influences, and in all its wonderful effects and produc
tions in this world, exhibits such
a
striking display of the divine
wisdom, power, and goodness, that
it
inclines one to suppose,
that the religious veneration given to
it
by the unenlightened Eastern
nations, was one of the most pardonable kinds of idolatry
:
if
it
may
be allowed lawful to speak with the least degree of mitigation of any
profane worship, whereby that honour
is
given to senseless matter,
which
is
due only to the everljving, life-giving God. Tr.

Heaven and Httt 133
OF THE FOUR QUARTERS IN HEATEN.
141. IN heaven, as well as in this world, are the four
quarters or cardinal points of the East, South, West, and
North, and in both determined by their proper sun ; in
heaven by the Celestial Sun (representing) the Lord, and
in this world, by our sun ; but yet with much difference
between them: first, in that the point of the sun's greatest
altitude in our hemisphere, is by us called the South ; the
opposite thereto the North ; the point where the sun rises
at the time ofthe Equinoxes, the East ; and where it then
sets, the West ; so that in our world all the quarters are
determined by the meridian sun. But in heaven that is
called the East where the Lord appears as a sun ; oppo
site thereto is the West ; to the right hand is the South ;
and to the left hand is the North : and thus always the
same to the angels, which way soever they turn their faces
or bodies, (as having the Lord always before them;) so
that in heaven all the four quarters are determined by the
East, that being the quarter in which the Lord appears as
a Sun ; from which he is called the Origin* of all life -yand
agreeable thereto, in proportion to the Heat and Light, or
Love and Understanding, received by the angels from
him, in such degree the Lord is said to rise upon or in
them : hence likewise it is, that the Lord in Scripture is
called the East. (Ill)
142. Another difference is, that the angels have the
East always before them, the West behind them, the
South on their right, and the North on their left hand :
but as this is difficult to be understood by the inhabitants
of our earth, who turn their faces indifferently to every
one of the quarters, something shall here be said by way
* This alludes to the signification of the words Orietu aad Orige,
from oriri, to rise.
(Ill) That the Lord, in the highest sense of the word, is the East
or Orient, as being the sun of heaven, always risen, but never setting

134 A treatise concerning
of explanation. The whole of heaven has its aspect to-
wards the Lord, as to its common center ; consequently
that of the angels has the same direction. It is well
known by us, that all things on earth have a direction to
its center ; though this differs from the former, as in hea
ven the front or fore parts have this direction, but in our
world the lower parts, and this tendency is called Centri
petal, or otherwise Gravitation. The whole interior of the
angels has its direction or tendency forward to the Lord;
and as this influences and manifests itself in the face, so
consequently the face of the angel gives determination to
the quarters. (112)
143. But that the angels should ever front to the East,
which way soever they turn their faces or bodies, will
appear "still more hard to be conceived by men, who view
every quarter alike, accordingly as they turn their bodies:
to this also a word. The angels move, and turn their
faces and bodies every way like men on earth, and yet
notwithstanding, their aspect is always to the East; but
then it must be observed, that these their motions and turn-
ings, though like to those of men, are not the same, being
from a different principle, viz. the Love that prevails in
them, which is the determining power, even in externals,
both with Angels and other Spirits : for, as was said be
fore, their interior is actually turned towards their com
mon center, and consequently, in heaven, towards the
Lord as a Sun ; for Love being the inward ru iing princi
ple of the angels, manifesting itself in the face as its
outward form ; therefore the angels naturally turn their
faces to him who is the great object of that love ; or ra
ther it is the Lord (as being in that love, and also the gi
ver of it) that presents himself to them which way soever
they look. (113) These things cannot be farther elucidat-
( J 12) That all the angels turn their faces to the Lord, n. 9828,
10130, 10189, 10219: not that the angels turn themselves to the
Lord, but that he turn them to himself, n. 10189. That the angels
are not so properly said to be present with the Lord, as the Lord to
be present with them, n. 9415. .

ed at present, but shall be farther explained in the follow
ing articles, wherein representations and appearances,
time and space in heaven, will be treated of as their pro
per subjects. That the angels have the Lord always be
fore their faces, has been given me to know by full expe
rience; for as often as I have been in company with them
I have been made sensible of his being so present, by
light in my understanding, when 1 had no ocular vision
of him; and the angels have often affirmed to me the truth
of it ; and indeed this is so established and confessed
a truth, that it is common among men, when speaking of
such as truly believe in and love the Lord, to say, they
have the Lord always before them ; that they walk in his
sight; and the like : now it is from the Spiritual world
that we are lfd so to speak, for many forms of speech in
the language of man express ideas and truths derived
from thence, though we know it not to be so.
144. This seeing of the Lord by the angels, even
where many of them look different ways from one ano
ther, and yet every one beholds him, notwithstanding
their several different directions, is one of the wonders of
the heavenly world ; and however difficult to conceive,
yet so itis, that which way soever they turn themselves, he
is always before them, and they have the South on the right
hand, the North on their left, and the West behind them.*

and direction, as established in this our natural world. Our customary
ideas are apt to tincture the mind with prejudices against many truths
even in nature : and were it not for mirrors and glasses, how impos
sible would it seem to man y, Uiat objects behind us should so distinctly
be seen as before us ; nay how many deceptions are we liable to from
appearances, and a false judgment concerning natural causes qpd

13© A treatise concerning
Among other wonderful things there are likewise the two
following, viz. First, Though the angels always front to
the East, yet they have also a view of the other three
quarters at the same time, but of the latter by an inward
kind of vision like that of thought. Secondly, That no
one in the heavenly world stands behind another, so as to
look at the hinder part of his head, as this is contrary to
the laws of Influx of goodness and truth from the Lord.
145. The angels look at the eyes of the Lord [when
he appears to them in person,] but the Lord at the fore
head of the angels, and that because the forehead corres
ponds to love, through which the Lord influences their
wills ; as he enlightens their minds with the knowledge
of him, to which intellectual sight the eyes correspoiid.
(114)
146. The quarters in the heavens, which constitute
the Celestial kingdom of the Lord, differ from those
which constitute his spiritual kingdom, and that because
the Lord appears to the angels of the former as a Sun,
and to the angels of the latter as a Moon; and his ap
pearance is in the East : the distance between the Sun
and Moon there is thirty degrees, as also that of the
quarters. That heaven is distinguished into two king
doms, the Celestial and the Spiritual, see in its proper ar
ticle, n. 20 to 28: and that the Lord appears in the for
mer as a Sun, and in the latter as a Moon, n. 1 18 : but
nevertheless the quarters or cardinal points are not there-
effects. It may truly be affirmed, that a great part of the infidelity
that is in the world, preceeds from the immersion of men's minds into
matter and sense, and their setting up natural things as the standard
of judgment in spiritual things; or else from holding the former only
to be realities. The constitution andl aws of things in all worlds (more
especially between the natural and spiritual worlds) are unquestiona
bly very different, so as to exhibit, in endless variety, most wonderful
^displays of the infinite wisdom and power hi the adorable Creator. Tr.

cend to the Celestial, nor these descend to the former ;
see n. 35, /
147 Hence it appears in what sense the Lord is pre
sent in the heavens; that he is every -where, and with eve
ry one in that goodness and truth which proceed from
him ; and that he dwells with the angels in his own divine
principle, as was mentioned before, n. 12. The percep»
tion of the presence of the Lord in the angels is pnmarilv
in their interior or intellectual part from which their ex
ternal sight proceeds, and whereby they behold him out
wardly; for to them outward vision is a continuation of
the inward : and thus we are to understand how the
Lord is in them, and they in the Lord, according to
those words :
" Abide in me, and I in you," John xv. 4.
" He who eateth my flesh, arid drinketh my blood, abid-
" eth in me, and I in him," John vi. 56. The flesh of
the Lord signifies Divine Good, and his blood, Divine
Truth. (115) v
148. In the heavens all have their separate dwellings
according to the several quarters. They who are in the
good oflove, in the East and West ; they who are in the
sensation of it in a higher degree, dwell in the East; they
who have it in a lower degree, have their dwellings in the
West ; they who are endowed with wisdom from that
source of good, have their habitations in the South and
in the North ; such of them as partake of a clearer light
of wisdom, in the South ; and such as possess it in a les
ser degree of clearness, in the North. In like manner are
situated the Angels of the Spiritual kingdom, but with
difference, according to their kind and degree of good,
and of light from that good respectively ; for as the pre
vailing love in the Celestial kingdom is Love to the
Lord, and the light of Truth from thence is Wisdom ; so
in the Spiritual kingdom, the prevailing love is that to

their neighbour, which is called Charity ; and the light
of truth proceeding thence, is Intellectual Knowledge,
which is called Faith; see above, n. 23. There is a
difference also betwixt them respecting the Quarters,
in the distance of thirty degrees, as mentioned before, n.
146.
149. In like manner dwell the angels in their several
Societies : such of them as are in a greater degree of
Love and Charity being situated to the East of their par
ticular departments; they that possess a lesser degree, in
the West ; they who have more of Wisdom and Under
standing, are to the South of their tribes ; and they who
have less, to the North : and this distinction takes place
throughout the Celestial regions, and that because every
particular society is a representation of the whole heaven,
nay, is a heaven in a lesser form : see n. 51 to 58. The
snme order is also observed when they meet in their as
semblies, whilst every one knows and readily takes his
proper place, as it were by a heavenly instinct ; it is like
wise ordained, by an established law, that there should
be some angels of all classes and degrees in every parti
cular society, that there may be a conformity between the
whole complex of heaven and its several parts, but yet
with this difference> that the angelical societies in the
East are of superior excellence to those of the West ;
and they who are stationed in the South to those of the
North.
150. Hence it arises, that every Quarter in the Hea
venly World points out or signifies the particular excel
lencies and qualities with their degrees, that appertain to ,
their inhabitants respectively ; thus the East signifies
Love and its good qualities in a higher degree; the
West the same, but in a lower degree ; the South signi
fies Wisdom and Understanding of eminent clarity ; and
the North the same, but with a degree of obscurity ; and
as the four Quarters have such a signification, so the like
things are represented to us in the Internal or Spiritual

ponds with the constitution of things in heaven.
15 1 . The very reverse of what has been here related,
is the case with the inhabitants of the Infernal kingdoms,
as they behold not the Lord as a Sun, or as a Moon ; but,
with their backs towards him, look at that black body
which is to them in the room of what our Sun is to us ;
and to that dark orb, which is to them instead of a Moon;
those which are called Genii to the former ; and those
which are called Spirits to the latter. (117) That the
Sun of our world, and the Moon belonging to our earth,
are not seen in the Spiritual world, but instead of the
former a black disk (i aliginosum quidJ opposite to the
Celestial Sun ; and instead of the latter a dark orb (Tene-
brosum quid) opposite to the Heavenly Moon, see before,
n. 122. Wherefore the four Quarters with the Infernals
are opposite to those in heaven, their East being where
the black disk, or the dark orb appears; their West to
wards the Celestial Sun ; the South to their right, and the
North to their left hand ; and thus, which way soever they
turn : nor can it be otherwise, as blackness and^darkness is
the center ofall their motions. That all in the other worlds
are determined in externals from their inward dispositions

and the love of the world, are the prevailing principles

140 A treatise concerning
hence it is, that they who are actuated by them, turn their
backs to the Lord, and direct their faces to the dark orbs
before mentioned. The infernals also have their habita
tions in the four quarters, according to their evil quali
ties and conditions respectively ; they who are in the evil
habits proceeding from self love, fin malis ex amore suij
dwell from East to West, according to the degrees of
their malignity ; and they who are in the depravity of er
ror from an evil heart, (qui injalsis malij have their sta
tions from South to North, according to their degrees in
depravity : but more on this subject when we come to
treat of the Hells in particular.
152. When any evil spirit comes into the company of
the good, it is wont to occasion such a confusion in the
four quarters, that the latter are sometimes at a loss to
know which is the East ; and this I have sometimes been
witness to, and have also heard the good spirits complain
of the disorder occasioned thereby.*
153. Evil Spirits sometimes appear with their faces
turned towards the Quarters of Heaven, at which times
they become receptive of understanding, and perception
of the truth, but not of any affection for good ; and there
fore, as soon as ever they turn back their faces to their
own quarters, they become immediately deprived of such
understanding and perception, denying that they have re
ceived or perceived any truths, nay, affirming them all to
be lies, as having their wills and affections strongly bent
that the love of self and of the world constitutes hell, as being
opposites to the former, n. 2041, 3610, 4225, 4726—10741 to
10745.

casions the general laws of ccconomy in thehcavensare suspended by

poses of the divine wisdom, many instances of which are given by our
Author, and some of them accounted for. Many such extraordinary
cases, and particular exception to the rules of God's general govern
ment of this world, are productive of useful lessons and beneficial ef
fects to us his poor creatures; and even the angels (who, as crea
tures, must be imperfect) may at times stand in need of extraordina
ry documents, to remind them of their dependence, and by way of
preservatives to humility. Tr.

it has been given me to know, that the wicked and ungod
ly, even whilst they continue such, may be converted
as to their intellectual, though not in their voluntary or

that all may come to the knowledge of the truth, though
none can savingly receive

CONCERNING THE CHANGES IN THE STATES OE

such Changes in the Angles as have respect to their love
and faith, and to their wisdom and understanding derived

highest and lowest degrees : when their love is at the
highest, their light and heat are then the greatest, and .
consequently their glory and joy ; and when their love is
at the lowest, then they may be said to be in the shade
and in the cold, as their brightness is obscured, and their-
state unjoyous •* but they return from the lowest up
again to the highest, and from one degree to another by
various successions, like to the changes in this world be
tween day light and twilight, heat and cold, morning,
noon, and night ; and also according to the various sea
sons of the year : and their is also a correspondence be
tween them : thus morning answers to their state of love
in clarity ; noon to their meridian state of wisdom ; even-
ingto their wisdom in a degree of obscurity ; and night
to a state of deprivation as to both ; though it must be
noted, that there is no correspondence between night, and
any State of the Angels in Heaven, but only with the state
of those that are in hell, (119) as the former never suffer
a total deprivation of their love and wisdom ; and there
fore the twilight before day is the correspondent to their
lowest state. From this law of correspondency it is, that
Day and Year in the word signify the States of life in ge
neral, and Heat and Light, love and wisdom ; morning,

scribe the states of the Angels as bordering at certain times upon ob
scurity and dejection, yet it seems highly credible, even upon a ra
tional view of the matter, that perfect bliss, without intermission or
abatement, is not compatible with the nature of created beings, nay,
perhaps without some vicissitudes, would cease to be bliss: besides*
something of diversity herein, as it recommends and heightens en
joyment, may be of moral use even to the Angels, as was observed in
a preceding note. Let it be added, that probably those Angels, which
arc most highly graduated in excellence and bliss, may, at certain
short intervals, experience the greatest depressions, or deprivations
of joy, as the most favoured servants of God are oft times most de
based here, that they may be made meet to partake of a more exalted
inheritance hereafter. Tr.

the first and most intense degree of love ; noon, wisdom
in its most luminous State ; evening, wisdom in some de
gree of obscurity ; and night, a total deprivation of both
love and wisdom. (120)
156. Together with the Interior States of Love and
Wisdom in the Angels, is also changed the State of va
rious things without them that are the objects of sight ;
for these vary their appearance according to their inward
State of the Angels:* but this will be treated of un
der the articles of Representatives and Appearances in
Heaven.
157. Every Angel is subject to these changes, and al
so under goes them, and also every Angelical Society m
common, but one differently from another, and that be
cause of their difference as to love and wisdom ; for they
who are in the centre of a Society are in a more perfect
State than those who are nearer to its periphery ; see n.
23, 128 : but to dwell on the particular differences would
be too prolix, as the changes in every one are according
to the quality of his love and faith, so that one may be in
his full splendor and joy, whilst another may be eclipsed
and in his joyless State, and this even in the same Society;
each Society also has its respective difference in this re
spect, both in the Celestial and the Spiritual Kingdom.
The difference in the Changes of their States is in general
(120) That the vicissitudes of states in Heaven, in respect to il
lumination and perception, answer to the times of day in this world,

144 A treatise concerning
like that of the days in the different climates here on earth,
where it is morning to some, whilst it is evening to
others ; summer to one country, at the same that it is
winter to another.
158. I have received light from Heaven as touching
these Changes there, and been informed by the Angels
with respect to the causes of them, which are several.
First, that the delights of life, and the joys of Heaven,
wou Id by degrees suffer diminution, if they were to con
tinue always the same, as happens to those who always go
on in the same round of pleasures. Another reason is,
that self love is a property inherent in Angels as well as
men ; that this is contrary to the laws of Heaven, and that
the Angles excel in love and wisdom only 60 far as they
are kept from it by the Lord ; and as, otherwise, they
would be carried away by this propensity, (121) therefore
these vicissitudes of states are appointed for good to
them. A third cause is, that it may serve as a means of
oftheir higher perfection, by keeping them habitually in
the love of the Lord, and restraining them from self love;
and also to increase their relish for the delights of good,
(122) by such occasional suspensions of them. They fur
ther added, that the Lord does not produce these Changes
in their States from himself, seeing that, as a Sun, he
never, with-holds his heat and light, or love and wisdom;
but that the hindrance is in themselves, by giving way to
that principle of self, which renders them unreceptive of
those blessings ; which they illustrated by a comparison
with our Sun and Earth, observing that the successive
Changes from heat to cold, and from light to darkness on
this our globe, are not owing to the Sun, which continues
(121) That self-love is a property inherent in man, n. 694, 731,
4317, 5660. That this must be alienated, in order to the enjoyment
afthc Lord's presence, n. 1023, 1044 : and that accordingly it is ac
tually alienated, so long as any one persevers in the principle of
good by preservation from the Lord, n. 9334, 9335, 9336, 9445 —
9938.
(122) Thart the Angels advance in degrees of perfection eternally,

ther, whence a constant progress in perfection, n. 10200.

dways the same, but to the form, situation, and revolu
tions of the earth.
159. It has been given me to behold, how the Lord
appears as a Sun to the Angels ofthe Celestial kingdom
in their first State, how in their second, and how in their
third State : and first, his appearance was as that of a Sun
of a bright red colour, and glittering with a splendor sur
passing all description. It was told me, that such was
the appearance of the divine glory to those Angels in their
first State (of highest love :) afterwards there appeared a
large dusky circle or belt round the Sun, whereby its
bright redness and splendor were much abated ; I was in
formed, that such was its appearance to the Angels in
their second state. Afcer this, the circle or belt before
mentioned appeared of a still darker complexion, which
Still farther diminished the Sun's splendor, and so on
gradually, till at length its glittering redness was chang
ed to a pale colour j such was the appearance of the Sun
to the Angels in their third state. After these mutations,
this pale Sun seemed to pass on the left towards the
Moon of Heaven, and to join itself to her, whereby her
splendor was exceedingly augmented ; I was told, that
hereby was represented the fourth State of the Celestial
Angels, and the first or highest of the Spiritual Angels ;
and that these Changes take place in both kingdoms suc
cessively, but not in every Society therein at the same
time ; nor are these Changes at any fixed periods, but
befal the Angels sooner or later, without any knowledge
of their approach. Moreover, they said, that these were
not real Changes in the Sun itself, but only so many ap
pearances depending on the successive Changes in the
States of the Angels, forasmuch as the Lord, as represent
ed by the Sun, appears to every one according to the qual
ity of his State ; as for example, bright and ruddy to those
that are in the degree of intense Love ; less so to such as
are in an inferior degree of
it,
and so on to quite pale,, as
their love departs
;
and that the quality and degree of
their States are represented by that dim circle, which ap
parently super-induces these variations in the lusjrc and
light or the Sun.

116 A treatise concerning
160. When the Angels are in their lowest State, or
property of self love, they decline into sadness: I have
conversed with some of them in this State, and was
witness to their dejection ; but they told me, that they
hoped to be soon restored to their heavenly State ; for it
is Heaven to them to be delivered from propriety or self
love.
161. The Infernal Spirits also have their Change of
States ; but ot this hereafter, where we shall treat of
Hell.
OF TIME IN HEAVEN.
162. HOWEVER all things go on in Heaven accord
ing to succession and progression, as in this world ; ne-
verthless, the Angels have no idea of time or space, nor
any notion concerning them : we shall here treat of Time
in Heaven and hereafter of the Space, under its proper ar
ticle.
. 163. That the angels have no idea of time, though all
things go on successively with them in like manner as
with us, is owing to there not being years and days in
Heaven, but only Changes of Condition ; now as the for
mer constitute Times, so the lattc r are called Suites.
164. By times on earth we mean the Sun's apparent
progress from one degree to another, so constituting that
period of time which we call a year } and also its appar
ent diurnal revolution round the Earth, which we call a
day ; and these according to stated vicissitudes : but it
is otherwise with the Sun in Heaven, which makes no
such progressions and revolutions, to constitute years and
days, but only apparent Changes of States in the Angels,
and these according to no stated rules, as was observed
in a preceding article ; hence it
is,
that the Angels can
haev no idea of time, but only of State in room thereof;
see State above, n. 154.

manner of men, so neither have they any conception ofits

divisions, as of years, months, weeks, days, hours, to-day,
to-morrow, yesterday, &c. insomuch, that when they hear
of these distinctions bv men, (to whom they are always
present by divine appointment) in the room thereof they
substitute States, and such things as appertain thereto ;
thus changing the natural idea of a Man, into the spiritu
al idea of an Angel : hence it
is,
that Times
in
the writ
ten word signify States, and the distinctions of time, as
mentioned above, such spiritual things as correspond
thereto. (123)
166.
It
is
the same with all things that owe their exist-
,
ence to time, as the four seasons of the yea-
,
cal ]ed spring,
summer, autumn, and winter
;
the four times of the day,
morning, noon, evening and night; also with the four
ages of man, as infancy, youth, manhood, and old age;
and in lise manner with other things, which derive their
being from time, or succeed according to it. When any
of these are present to the mind of man, his thoughts
thereon are regulated by Time, but those of an Angel by
State
;
thus the latter changes the idea of spring and
morning into the idea of love and wisdom, as
in
their first
State with the Angels; summer and noon into the idea of
love and wisdom, as they are
in
the second State
;
autumn
and evening, as they are
in
their third State
;
and night
and winter into the idea of the absence of love and wis
dom, and so constituting
a
hellish State
;
and hence
it
is,
that sue
n
states are signified by such Times in the writ
ten Word
;
see above, n. 155. Thus we see how the
ideas of natural things in the mind of
a
man are
c
'.inverted
into corresponding spiritual ideas in the mind ofan Angel
present with man.

118 A treatise concerning
men : by Eternal, the Angels conceive a State without
end, but not a Time without end. (124) As I was once
thinking on the subject of Eternity, I found, that by my
ideas of Time, I could form a conception of what might
be to Eternity, or without end, but not of what has been
from Eternity, nor consequently of what God did from
Eternity before the Creation : and being troubled in my
mind at this, I found myself exalted on an angelical illu
mination concerning Eternity, and given to know, that as
to things eternal, we are not to take our measure of think
ing from Time, but from State ; and that by this means
we may form a conception of what has been from Eterni
ty ; which I experienced to be the case.
168. When the Angels converse with men, they never
Speak to them from those natural ideas which are com
mon and proper to man, as these are all derived from
Time, Space, Materiality, and things analogous thereto ;
but from their own spiritual ideas derived from States,
and their various mutations within and without the An
gels : however, these idea of the Angels, though spiritu
al, yet when they enter the minds of men instantaneously,
and as of themselves, convert into such natural ideas as
are proper to men, and correspond to the spiritual ones,
though imperceptible both to the angels and men ; and
the case is the same with the heavenly influx in man. On
a certain time there were some angels who had access to
my mind, in which were many natural thoughts borrow
ed from Time and Space; but, as they -could form no
conception of them, they immediately withdrew ; on
which I heard them say, that they were darkened and
confused. I had also the following convincing experi
ment how far the angels are strangers to every idea of
Time : one of them, who was more receptive of natural
knovvledg, and with whom, on that account, I was by
degrees able to converse as one man with another, atfirst
did not know what I meant by Time ; and so was oblig
ed to explain to him how our sun, by its apparent revo
lutions round the earth, constituted what we call Days

and Years ; how the year was divided into four seasons,
and alsointo months and weeks, and the days into twen
ty-four hours; and that these divisions took place regu
larly at stated periods, from whence the idea of Times
originates; on hearing which he wondered, saying, that
he had no other notion of these, but as States. In the
course of our conversation I said, that we men shewed our
assent to the Truth of there not being Time in Heaven,
by our familiar form of expression concerning the de
ceased, as that temporal things were over with them ;
that they had passed through Time, or left this world,
and the like. I told him, moreover, that some seemed
conscious that Time in their origin were no other
than States, inasmuch as they so nearly correspond
to the state oftheir affections and feelings, seeming short
to those who are in pleasing and joyous frames ; and te
dious to those that are in sorrow and sadness ; and differ
ent according to the state of our hope, or expectation :
and therefore hence it is, that the learned are so much
puzzled in their investigations concerning the nature and
essence of Time and Space, and that some among them
are agreed, that they are only relative to man during his
existence in this natural world.
169. The mere natural man may here be led to fancy,
that if he were deprived of his ideas of Time, Space, and
Material Things, he should in that case be stript of the
faculty of Thinking, forasmuch as they are the fundamen
tals of all his thoughts: (125) but on the contrary, lot
him know, that so far as his thoughts are confined to
Time, Space, and Material Things, in such proportion
are they limited and narrowed; and only so far at liberty
and enlarged, as they are disengaged from these subjects,
as hereby soaring above connected regi'ons of corporeal
and earthly things : hence proceeds the sublime wisdom
of Angels, which is incomprehensible by ideas of so low .
an extraction.

OF REPRESENTATIVES AND APPEARANCES BV
HEAVEN.
170. THE man who thinks only from natural light,
Cannot comprehend that there should be any resemblance
between things in Heaven and in this world, and that be
cause from such light he has accustomed himself to
think, and confirm himself in the notion that Angels are
only mere Minds, or a kind of aetherial Spirits, and as
such have not senses like men, nor eyes ; and if not eyes
consequently not objects of sijrht ; whereas they have all
the senses that men are gifted with, and those in a more
exquisite degree of perfection ; and the lightin which
they see, is far brighter than our's. That Angels are
men in a perfec t form, and endowed with every sense, see
above, n 73 to 77 ; and that the light in Heaven is far
more splendid than any light in this world, n. 126 to
132.
171 It is hard to describe the various kinds of things
that are seen by the Angeis in the Heavens : let it su'fiee
to say, that in the main they resemble those on earth,
though in form more perfect, and far excelling in abund.
ance. That such things are in the Heavens, is given us
to understand by those which are recor led as seen by the
Prophets, and in particular by Ezekiel, concerning the
New T- mple and the New Earth, as decribed from ch.
xl. to xlviii : by Daniel, from ch. vii. to xii: by John,
from the beginning to the end of the Apocalypse ; and by
others as recorded in the prophetical and historical parts
of the written Word. Such things were seen by therrt
when Heaven was opened to them, or, which is the same
thing, when their inward sight, which is the sight of the
Spirit of a man, was opened to see things in Heaven, for4
these are not to be seen by the bodily, but spiritual eye
only ; and this is opened, according to the good pleasure
of the Lord, when a man is withdrawn from the natural
light, which is the light of his bodily senses, and exalted
to the Spiritual Light, which is the proper Light of his

Spirit ; and in this Light have I beheld things that are in
the Heavens.
172. However, the visible things in the Heavens,
though, in respect to a great part of them, they resemble
the things here on earth, yet differ from them with re.
gard to their essence, inasmuch as the former derive their
existence from the Celestial Sun, but things on earth
{proximately) from the sun of this world ; the former are
called Spiritual, and the latter are called Natural.
173. Things in the Heavens exist not in like manner
with things on earth ; in the former, all things are formed
by the Lord, according to Correspondency with the inte
riors [cum mterioribus) of the Angels ; for with the An
gels are things interior and exterior ; the former have
relation to love and faith, and consequently to will and
intellect as the receptacles of them, and their exterior
things correspond to those that are interior ; see above,
n. 87 to 115. This may be illustrated by what has been
said before of the heat and light of Heaven, viz. that
the Angels possess a heat according to the quality and
degree of their love, and light according to the quality
and degree of their wisdom ; see n. 128 to 134; and so
other things in like manner, which are the objects of
their senses.
174. When I have had the privilege to be in company
with the Angels, all things about them appeared to me in
the same manner as things do on earth, and that with such
clearness of perception, that I semed to be in some roy
al palace in this w.irld, conversing with them, as one man
converses with another.
175. As all things that outwardly correspond to things
that are inward, do also represent them, therefore they
are called Representatives; and as they vary according
to the variation of such interior things, therefore they are
called Appearances ; though the things which present
themselves to the sight of the Angels, and are perceived
by their senses, make as distinct and clear impressions
as things on earth, and more so ; for they have a real and
substantial existence, though there are some which are

in all kinds of trees and flowers, where beautiful rows of

the children of Paradise, whilst the spreading branches,
decorated and enriched with fruit, emblematically repre

scenes as these in the Heavenly World, some good peo
ple here, who have not obscured their Celestial Notices
of these things by their fallacious natural reason, are fully
convinced of; and accordingly are not only used to thjnk,
but to say, as concerning Heaven, that many more things

OF THE GARMENTS IN WHICH THE ANGELS AP
PEAR TO BE CLOTHED.
. 177. AS the Angels are heavenly men, and live toge
ther as men do on earth, so also have they Garments,
Dwellings, and many other like things in common with
us men, but with this difference, that as they themselves
are in a more perfect state, so likewise are all things that
belong to them : thus, for instance, as the Angelical
Wisdom excels the human beyond expression, so do all
things about them, and that are perceived by them, for
these are correspondent to the wisdom that is within
them : see above, n. 173.
178. The Garments with which the Angels are invest
ed, have, like other things, a corresponding relation to
their interior perfections, and consequently a real exist
ence ; see above, n. 175. Now their vestments cor
respond to their degrees of understanding and wis
dom, and therefore they appear arrayed accordingly;
and some excel others in intellectual endowments,
(n. 43, and 128) their garments are suitably adapted to
their different distinctions therein : such as are most high
ly intellectual appear in glistering flame-coloured Robes,
and some in shining Vestments ; they who are intellectu
al in a lower degree are in White, or pale-coloured, but
not shining Garments; and those who are so in the lowest
degree, wear Raiment of different colours respectively :
but the Angels of the Third or Inmost Heaven appear
naked.*
* From this last particular given us by the Author, it seems, that
Adam and Eve, before the Fall, represented the state of the Angeh

179. As the Garments of the Angels conespond to
their Understanding, so do they also correspond to Truth,
as all right understanding is from Divine Truth ; and
therefore it amounts to the same thing, whether you say,
their Clothing is according to the one or the other. That
the Vestments of some glister as from flame, and those
of others of a shining Light, is because Flame corres
ponds to Good, and Light to Truth from Good: (128)
that the Garments of others are white and pale without
splendor, and some of different colours, is because Di
vine Good and Divine Truth are less splendid, and also
differently received in those whose intellectual faculties are
of the lower degrees. (129) White and pale do also cor
respond to simple Truth, (130) and colours to the differ
ent kinds and measures of it. (131) That the Angels of

the pure all things are pure, and with respect to such, no part of the.
human body wants a covering : for perfect innocence knows no shame,
as it needs none ; whilst consummate guilt, that can even glory in its
shame, knows no modesty to conceal that shame. Little children,
who have a relative or comparative purity, as free from actual sin,
may serve to image to us the truth of the foregoing remark, and to
indicate how consciousness of guilt, producing shame, is the fruit of
that tree, by which comes the knowledge of good and evil. If then
Garments only become necessary to us by the loss of innocence, bow
great must appear the folly of those who turn that into an occasion of
pride, which first took its rise from sin, and continues to be the badge
and evidence of their shame. Tr.

they are in perfect Innocence, and Innocence is the cor
respondent to Nakedness. (132)
180. As the angels are clothed with Garments in Hea
ven, therefore did they appear in like manner to the pro
phets, and also at our Lord's sepulchre, with " Raiment
" white as snow," Matt, xxviii. 3. Mark xvi. 5. Luke
xxii. 4. John xx. 11, 13. As likewise those who were
seen in Heaven by John. Apoc. iv. 4. And as all wis
dom is from Divine Truth, therefore our Lord's Raiment,
at his Transfiguration, was " shining, and exceeding
" white as snow," Mark ix. 3. That Light corresponds
to Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord, see above,
n. 12i>. Therefore it is, that Garments in the Word sig
nify Truths, and hence Understanding ; thus in John^
" They which have not defiled their Garments shall walk.
" with me in White, for they are worthy : he that over-
" cometh, the same shall be clouthed in White Raiment:
" blessed is he that watcheth and kcepeth his Garments,''
Rev. iii. 4, 5. xvi. 15. And of Jerusalem, by which is
meant the true church, (133) is said in Isaiah, " Awake,
" awake, put on thy Strenth, O Zion, put on thy beauti-
" ful Garments O Jerusalem*" lii. 1. And in Eze-
" kiel, I girded thee about with fine linen, and cover-

in,
to see the guests, he saw there
a
man which
**
had not on
a
Wedding Garment: and he said unto him
" Friend, how earnest thou in hither not having
a
Wed-
" ding Garment
?
Wherefore lie was cast into outer
" darkness," Matt, xxii, 12, 13. By the Marriage-
House
is
to be understood Heaven and the Church, from
the union of the Lord therewith by his Divine Truth
;
and therefore the Lord
is
called, in the Word, the Bride
groom and Husband, and Heaven with the Church, the
Spouse and his Wife.
181 . That the Garments of the Angels not only appear
such, but really are what they appear to be,
is
evident
both from neir sight and feeling
:
and also they have
change of Raiment, which they put on and off, and lay by
for future use, as occasion may require
:
and that they ap
pear clothed differently at different times,
I
have been
eye-witness to
a
thousand times
:
Ialso asked them whence
they had them
;
they answered, by the gift of the Lord,
and that sometimes they found themselves clothed there
with without their knowledge. Moreover, they said, that
their Garments were varied according to the variation of
their States
;
that in their first and second state they were
of
a
shining White, but in their third and fourth some
thing darker, and that according to the rules of Corres
pondency, as the changes happened in respect to their
understanding and wisdom, of which see above, n. 154
to 161.
182. As in the spiritual world every Angel has Gar
ments adapted to and representative oi his intellectual
gifts, or according to the particular truths which form his
understanding
;
so likewise the infernal spirits, who are
destitute of all truth, appear also in their Garments, but
such only as arc ragged and filthy, each according to the
kind and degree of his folly and madness, nor can any
others suit them
;
however, the Lord allows them cloth
ing, that their nakedness and deformity may not ap

OF THE HABITATIONS AND MANSIONS OF THE
ANGELS.
183. AS the angels live in societies, as men do on
earth, so in like manner they have their particular dwel
lings, and these different according to their states of life
respectively, magnificient to those who -are worthy of
greater honour, and less so to those of inferior degree.
I have sometimes discoursed with the angels concerning
their dwellings, and told them, that among us at this time
scarcely any believed that they were so accommodated ;
some because they are not visible to them; some because
tliey have no notion of angels being men ; some because
thty suppose the angelical heavens to be the same that
they behold with their eyes : and as these appear to them
no other than void space, and fancying at the same time
that the angels are only thin aetherial forms, therefore they
conclude that they hover in the aether : besides, as they
have not the least notion of any thing spiritual, so neither
can they conceive how there can possibly be in the spiri
tual world things like to those in the natural. The angels
replied, that they knew that such ignorance prevailed on
earth at this time, and wondered at
it,
more especially in
the Christian church, and therein more among the learned,
than among those whom they called theilliterate and sim
ple; adding moreover, that they might gather from the writ
ten Word that Angels are Men, as having appeared of old
always as Men, and from the Lord's having risen again,
and ascended with his intire Humanity
;
and
if
the angels
are men, that they must of consequence have habitations
and dwellings, and not as some foolishly (madly they
termed
it)
suppose, hover in the air, or because they arc
called spirits, are therefore no other than
a
breath of wind.
They likewise said, that such might emerge from their
present ignorance as touching these matters, would they
but drop their prejudices, and not bewilder themselves
by starting questions and doubtful disputations, whether

these things be so or not, since there are in the mind of
every man certain plain, common notices or impre->sions
concerning the truth of angels being men, and dwelling
in heavenly mansions, far excelling any structures here
on earth : but that these common notices or impressions
(which are from above) are obliterated when men exer
cise themselves in vain reasonings, and bring the subject
into question with their logical ambiguities and subtle
reasonings; which is principally the case with the learn
ed, who, by their oppositions ofscience falsely so called^
darken divine truths, and render their minds inaccessible
to the light of heaven. And just so it is with respect to
their belief of the state of the soul after death ; he that is
conversant on this subject without puzzling his head
with the curious disquisitions of the learned concerning
the nature of the soul, and its re-union with the body,
readily takes for granted, that man enters upon a new life
after death, and passes into the society of angels, if he has
lived well, where he is entertained with ravishing scenes,
and feels joy unspeakable ; but no sooner does he bend
his mind to philosophical reasonings upon the subject, or
to consider it by some learned hypothesis concerning
soul and body, and their mutual relations and communi
cations, but he loses his former faith, and falls into
doubting.
184. But it will bring the matter more home, to al-
Iedge instances drawn from experience : and often as I
have conversed with the angels face to face, it was in
their habitations, which are like to our houses on earth,
but far more beautiful and magnificient, having rooms,
chambers, and apartments in great variety, as also spaci
ous courts belonging to them, together with gardens, par
terres of flowers, fields, &c. Where the angels are form
ed into societies, they dwell in contiguous habitations,
disposed after the manner of our cities in streets, walks,
and squares : I have had the privilege to walk through
them, and to examine all round about me, and to enter

my inward eyes opened. (134)
185. I have seen also the palaces in heaven, the mag-
nificienee of which exceeds all description, the roofs glit
tering as with pure gold, and the floors as with precious
stoaes ; but some more splendid than others; the inner ap-
partments likewise were ornamented beyond all human
conception. On the south side were gardens, where all
things appeared with radiant lustre, certain trees bearing
leaves of a silver hue, and fruit that glittered like burn
ished gold, whilst flowers in the borders, by a beautiful
arrangement of their colours, presented, as it were, rain
bows to the eye of the spectator : at the end of the walks
fresh palaces rose to the view, and terminated the pros
pect. Such is the architecture and beautiful scenery in
heaven, insomuch that it may well be said, that the very
principle of art appears there in its effects ; and no won
der, when we consider such art is heavenly : and yet the
angels said, that not only like things, but others beyond
number of still higher degrees of perfection, were at
times exhibited to their view by the goodness of the
Lord, for their recreation and entertainment; and yet that
the Intellectual pleasure they received therefrom was
greater than the sensible, and that because in all and sin
gular of those objects they discerned Correspondency,
and through their Correspondents the divine things which
they represented.
186. As touching Correspondences, I learned, that not
only Palaces and Houses, but likewise all things within
and without them were relative to the interior gifts and
qualities in the angels ; that house in general correspond
ed to the principle of good in them, and the particular
things therein to the different species or kinds of good;
(135) as the things without their Houses to the truths re
lative to and proceeding from such good respectively*

the name of the Temple at Jerusalem* John ii. 19. 21 ;
(136) and why the New Jerusalem appeared to be of pure
gold, its Gates of pearls, and its Foundation of precious
stones,Apoc. xxi.viz because the Temple represented the

the Church hereafter to be established on earth ; the
twelve Gates and Truths which lead to Goodness ; and

middle Heaven, in places of less eminence; and those of
the lowest or first Heaven in rocky situations, and all this
from Correspondency ; for the more interior states corresT
pond to visible eminences and the more exterior to infe
rior places; (138) and therefore it is that mountains in
Scripture-language signify Celestial Love ; hills, Spiritual
Love; and rocks, Faith. (139)
189. There are likewise angels which live not in so
cieties, but dispersed in separate houses : such dwell in
the middle parts of Heaven, as being the best of the angels.
190. The Mansions inhabited by the angels are not
built by them, as we build ours but are the gift of the
Lord to them, to each according to his recipiency of
goodness and truth ; and they also are subject to some
changes, accordingly as. variations happen in the inward
state of the angels, concerning which above, n. 154

191. THOUGH all things in Heaven appear to exist
in place and Space after the manner of this world, never

cannot but appear a paradox, and is a subject of great
importance, I proceed to the explanation of it.

1G2 A treatise concerning
I92i All progressions and advances in the Spiritual
World are caused by change of states in their interior,
nor are they any otherwise; ( 1
40) accordingly I have been
taken up by the Lord into Heaven, and have been in
different worlds in the universe as to my spirit, whilst
my body was all the while on earth in the same place :
(141) and so it is with the angels, for to them Distances
are nothing, and if nothing, so neither is Space any
thing, but instead thereof are their states and changes
therein.
J 93. As progressions are effected this way, it is evi
dent that the approximation to, and elongation from
persons reciprocally, consists in the similarity or dissimi
larity oftheir interior states respectively, they who are in the
former approaching near to one another, and such as
are in the latter separating from each other; and that
Spaces in Heaven are nothing more than their external
states corresponding to their internal ones : so also it is
that the Heavens are distinct from one another, as
also the societies in each Heaven, and every indi
vidual of a society : hence likewise that the different

hells are totally separated, and in opposition to the hea
vens, as being by conditions and qualities diametrically
contrary to one another.
194. From the same cause it comes to pass, that in
the Spiritual World, one becomes immediately present
to another, who intensely desires his company, for by
that means he sees him in thought, and enters into the
same state with his ; and on the contrary, that one is se
parated from another in proportion to his aversion to him ;
and as all aversion proceeds from contrariety of affec
tions and dissent of minds, hence it appears oftentimes,
that many who continue together whilst they agree, im
mediately disappear on the first quarrel.
195. So likewise when any one takes a walk from one
place to another, whether in the city he belongs to, in
the squares, gardens, or on a visit to any other society,
he reaches the end of his walk sooner or later, according
to the greater or lesser earnestness of his desire to be
there, the way, though the same in itself, appearing short
er or longer in proportion to such desire : this I have
often seen and wondered at. Hence it is plain, that Dis
tance, and consequently Space in Heaven, are altogether
relative to the interior states of the angels, and therefore
that the idea of Space enters not into their thoughts. ( 142)
196. This may be illustrated from what passes in the
mind of man, in which there is no Space, but every thing
that he intensely thinks of appears present to him: in
like manner, every one that reflects on she matter must
know, that Space is no object of sight, any farther than
he borrows the idea of it from intermediate objects, and
from what he has learned of Distance by experience : now
this proceeds from the following cause, viz. that in what
is continuous we have no precise idea of Distance, but
from things that are not continuous : * and this is still
more strongly the case with the angels, "as their seeing is
(142) That Places and Spaces appear according to the interior
states of angels and spirits, n. 5604, 9440, 10146.
* It will be somewhat difficult for the reader, that is not of a
philosophical turn of mind, to take the Author's meaning in this
pla.ee It may appear something clearer, if expressed thus : Were

a
corresponding to and one with their thinking, and their
thinking with their affections, and as things appear to
them near or remote, and in all their variations, accord
ing to their inward states as has been shewed before.
197. Hence, that in Scripture-language, by Places,
Spaces, and all things that carry in them an idea of Space,
we are to understand things pertaining to States; thus by
Distances, as near, far off, ways, journeys, wanderings ;
by miles, furlongs, fields, gardens, cities, streets, and
going from one place to another ; also by Measures of
various kinds, as long, broad, high and deep, and innu
merable other things, as most of the ideas in the human
mind borrow something from Space and Time: to in
stance only what is meant in Scripture by length, breadth
and height ; in this world, what is called long, broad or
high, is so denominated from Space; but in Heaven,
where they have no ideas of Space, by length is meant a
state of good, by breadth a state of truth, and by height
their respective difference as to degrees, of which in n. 38 ;
and the reason of understanding these dimensions in such
senses, is because that there Long is from East to West,
where dwell the angels who excel in the good of love ;
and Broad in Heaven is from South to North, where the
angels whose chief eminence and distinction is in truth
proceeding from good, have their habitations ; see above
any one surrounded only by Space, as it consists of no distinct visi
ble parts, but is all one continued sameness, he would not be able to
form any notion of distance therein ; but were bodies of visible di
mensions introduced into
it,
they would interrupt the continuity,
and serve as so many measures of Space, by having
a
relative dis
tance one from another
:
thus Place, whUh arises from the different
situation of bodies, becomes the measure of Space, by giving to
it
distinction. Eternity also
is
of like consideration, as having no divi
sion or distinction in itself, but borrows them from time, as time has
its measures only from the succession of bodies and sounds, accord*
ing to their impressions on the senses. Thus do things discontinu
ous and finite give us some, though inadequate, notions of things
continuous and infinite, whilst they leave us utterly incapable of form
ing any positive idea of them as they are in themselves
:
so full of
inconceivable mystery is every thing infinite and eternal, and abun
dantly sufficient to humble the priilc of nnui, when he turns bi>
thoughts to such subjects. Tr.

n. 148 : and High in Heaven signifies both, according to
their degrees respectively ; whence it is that length,
breadth and height, have such signification in Scripture-
language. Thus in Ezekiel, from ch. xl. to xlviii. where
the measures assigned to the New Temple and the New
Earth, together with their Courts, Doors, Gates, Cham
bers, Windows, &c. are denominated according to length,
breadth and height : all which signify and typify the New
Church, and the various species of good and truth there
in ; and to what else can such measures be applicable ?
And in like manner the New Jerusalem, as described by
St. John in the following words : "And the city lieth four
" square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And
" he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand
" furlongs : the length, and the breadth, and the height
" of it are equal." Rev: xxi. 16. Now, as by the New
Jerusalem is here signified the New Church, so by those
measures are signified the things pertaining to this
Church : by length is there signified its good oflove ; by
breadth its truth, as the offspring of' that love, and by
height the degrees of both respectively ; as by the twelve
thousand furlongs, the whole of its good and truth in their
complex :
(*) what other meaning can belong to the
length, and the breadth, and the height of it being equal?
That by Breadth in the Word is signified truth, appears
from those words of David, Ps. xxxi. 8. "Thou hast
" not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : thou hast
" set my feet in a large room (in latitude.) I called upon
" the Lord in distress (in straitness ;) the Lord answer-
" ed me, and set me in a large place" (in breadth,) Ps.
cxviii. 5. So in Isa. ch. viii. 8. and Habb. i. 6. and also
in other places.
198. From what has been said it may appear, that
though there be Space in Heaven, as well as here, yet
{*) It appears from many parts of our Author's writings, that
numbers in Scripture signify things, so that the number Twelve
signifies the complex or aggregate of all the things of the kind men
tioned; thus, if Good be the predicament, the number twelve added
to it makes it to signify all sorts of good ; if Truth, the same num
ber a4ded, makes it to signify all truths. Tr.

1 66' A treatise concerning
no account is made of it there, but only of States ; and
that it is not measured there by distances, as in this
world, but from and according to the interior State of the
Angels. (143)
199. The true and principal cause hereof
is,
that the
Lord
is
present to every one according to his faith and
love, (144) and that all things appear near or far accord
ing to his presence, for this gives determination to all
things in the Heavens
;
on this depends the wisdom of
the Angels, and the extent of their mental powers
;
to
this
is
owing the communication of all heavenly things
;
and hence
it
is
that the Angels think spiritually, and not
naturally after the manner of men.
OF THE FORM OF HEAVEN, ACCORDING TO
WHICH ARE REGULATED THE ANGELICAL
CONSOCIATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS.
200. AS concerning the form of Heaven, what has
already been said on that subject may serve to give the
reader some idea of
it
;
as that
it
is
uniform and similar
to itself in all its parts, both great and small, n. 72
;
whence
it
is,
that every society therein
is
a
Heaven in a
lesser Form, and every individual Angel
a
Heaven in the
smallest Form, n. 51 to 58; and that as Heaven in its
whole or complex resembles one man, so does every so-
ciety in
a
lesser, and every Angel in the least Form,
n. 59 to»77
:
that in the middle are the wisest of the An
gels, and round about them towards the circumference,
those who less excel in wisdom respectively
;
the like
regulation also takes place in every particular society,
n. 43
:
that from East to West dwell the Angels who are
(143) That, in the Word, Length signifies Good, n. 1613, 9487.
That Breadth signifies Truth, n. 1613, 3433, 3434, 4482, 9487,
10179. That Height signifies Good and Truth, according to their
degrees respectively, n. 9489, 9773, 10181.
(144) That the Lord
is
adjoined to and present with the Angels, in
proportion to their recipiency of love and charity from him, n. 290,
681, 1954, 2658, 2886, 2888—4524, 7211, 9128.

eminent in the Good of Love ; and from the South to the
North, those who are eminent in Truths derived from
tliat Good, all according to their degrees, and the same
in every particular Society, n. 148, 149. All these re
gulations are according to the Form of Heaven, and may
serve to give us a general idea of it. (145)
201. It concerns us the more to have some apprehen
sion ofthe Form of Heaven, not only as all the Societies
of the Angels are regulated by
it,
but also as
it
deter
mines the method of their communications with one an
other
;
and
if
so, the extent of their thoughts and affec
tions also, and consequently their understanding and wis
dom, receive their determinations herefrom, insomuch,
that the nearer any one approaches in himself to the per
fect Form of Heaven, the higher is the degree of his wis
dom
:
now whether we say of any one, that he
is
in the
Form of Heaven, or in the Order of Heaven,
it
comes to
the same, as the Form of every thing
is
from the law of
its order, and according to it. (146)
202.
It
will be proper in this place to explain briefly
what
is
meant by being in the Form of Heaven. Man
was created after the image of Heaven, and after the
image of this World
;
as to the former internally, and
as to the latter externally, see above, n. 57. (Now af
ter the Image, and after the Form, mean the same.) But
forasmuch as man,
by
the evil in his will, and the false
in his thoughts (per falsa cogitationis indej in conse
quence of the former, destroyed in himself the Image or
Form of Heaven, and in the room of
it
introduced the
Image or Form of Hell
;
therefore
it
is
that man
is
born
into the world in greater ignorance than any other ani
mals
:
and to the end that the Image or Form of Heaven
may be restored in him again,
it
is
become necessary for
him to be instructed in things pertaining to the Divine
(145) That the Universal Heaven, with regard to all the Angelical
Societies,
is
disposed or regulated by the Lord, according to his own
Divine Order, forasmuch as the Divine Presence in the Angels con
stitutes Heaven, n. 3038, 721

1S8 '& treatise concerning
Order ; for, as was said before, the Form of any thing is
according to its Order. The Word of God contains all
the laws of Divine Order in the precepts therein deliver
ed, and therefore as far as any one knows and keeps them,
so far is his internal or inward man opened, and the Or
der or Image of I leaven formed therein : hence appears
what is meant by being in the Form of Heaven, viz.. a
life according to the Divine Laws (147) and Order, as
laid down in the Word of God.
203. As far as one is in the Form of Heaven, so far is
he in Heaven, nay, so far is a Heaven in its lowest Form,
n. 57, and consequently in Divine Understanding and
Wisdom ; for, as was said before, the thoughts of his
mind, and the affections of his heart, extend themselves
every way according to his Form, and wonderfully com-
municate with the Angelical Societies there, and they
with him. (148) Some suppose that their thoughts and
affections have no actual extent around them, but are
shut up within them, because they view what they think
of as within their own minds, and not at a distance ; but
this is a great mistake, for, as the sight of the eye ex
tends to very distant objects, and is affected by them ac-
(147) That Divine Truths are the Laws of Order, n, 2247, 7995.
That as far as any one lives according to order, consequently in good
according to Divine Truths, so far only is he to be esteemed a Man,
n. 4839, 6605, 6626. That Man is the proper subject of all things per
taining to Divine Order, and that by original creation he was a Form
of Divine Order, n. 4219, 4220, 4223, 4*23—10156, 10472. That
Man is not now born in the principles of Goodness and Truth, but in
the evil and the false, and consequently in contrariety to the Divine
Order, and of consequence in mere ignorance, and therefore must of
necessity be born again, or regenerated by the power of Divine Truth
from the Lord, before he can enter again into the Divine Order, n.
1047, 2307, 2308—10286, 10751. That when the Lord forms man
anew, or regenerates him, he disposes all things in him according
tci Divine Order or fashions him to be a Form of Heaven, n. 5700,
6690, 9931, 10303.

life (which may be called an extension of
it)

cording to their nature, though at a great distance, so
the interior sight of the understanding extends to the
Spiritual World, though it perceives it not, for the rea
son mentioned above, n. 169 ; the only difference is,
that the sight of the bodily eye is affected naturally, as
from things in the natural world, and the intellectual
sight is affected spiritually, as from things in the Spiritu
al World, all which latter have relation to Goodness and
Truth. That man is not conscious of its being thus with
him, is because he does not apprehend that it is a real
Light which gives him understanding, and that without
such light in his understanding he would not be able to
think at all : concerning this Light, see above, n. 1 26 to
132. There was a certain Spirit, who believed that the
power of Thinking was from and within himself only,
without any extension beyond himself, and consequently
without Communication with any Society ; and to con
vince him of his error, all Communication was cut off
betwixt him and the Societies next to him, on which he
was not only immediately deprived of the power of
Thinking, but also fell down as dead, except that he
flung about his arms like a child newly born : in a little
time after, the Communication was again opened, and
according to its return he was gradually restored to the
use of his understanding : hereupon, certain Angels, that
were witnesses to this transaction, confessed that all
Thought and Affection were by Influx from Communi
cation, and consequently the whole of life, as the whole
of the Life of Man consists in his Thinking and being
affected, or, in other words, that he can understand and
will. (149)

170 4. treatise concerning
204. But we are to take with us, that Understanding
and Wisdom vary in air, according to the kind of Com*
munication ; they in whom these are formed from genu
ine and pure species of Goodness and Truth \ex genui-
nis veris et bonis,] communicate with the Angelical So
cieties according to the Form of Heaven ; but they whose
Understanding and Wisdom are not formed of such
Goods and Truths, but of such only as may consist with
them, here the communication is in a sort broken and
incoherent, as not being rightly conformable to the Or
der of Heaven : but as to those who have no true Under
standing and Wisdom, but are absorbed in the false of
evil fin falsis ex maloj their Communication is only
with the Infernal Societies. It must be observed, that
the degree of extension before-mentioned is according to
the degree of confirmation in the State of the parties re
spectively, and that such Communication with the Soci
eties is not attended with any perception of what they do,
or passes among them, but only a Communication of
their qualities and influence. (150)
505. All are consociated in Heaven according to their
Spiritual Affinities of good and true, in their several
ranks and degrees, whether in the Universal Heaven, in
the several Societies, or in particular families, insomuch
that the Angels, who are in the same kinds and degrees
of Good and Truth, know one another like kindred here
on earth, who have been educated together ; and there is
the like affinity and agreement between the several Truths
and species of Good that constitute their Understanding
and Wisdom, in every particular Angel, and productive
©f the same harmony: (151) whence it comes to pass tha^
from the Lord, n. 6469. That evil people will not receive this

they in whom Goods and Truths are united after the form
of Heaven, see things in their various combinatipns and
distant consequences all around them ; but it is other
wise where Goods and Truths are not so combined in a
Heavenly Form.
206 There is a like Form belonging to each of the /
Heavens, according to which the communication and ex
tension of the Thoughts and Affections of the Angels are
effected, and consequently their Understanding and Wis
dom ; and yet there is a difference in the Communica
tion between one Heaven and another; viz. of the Third
or Inmost with the Second or Middle Heaven, and of
both these with the First or Lowest Heaven ; though the
Communication between Heaven and Heaven is not pro
perly called Communication, but Influx, of which we
proceed to speak. That there are Three Heavens, apd
these distinct from one another, see above in its proper
article, n. 29 to 40.
207. That properly speaking, it is not Communica
tion, but Influx, that subsists between Heaven and Hea
ven, as may appear from the Order of the Heavens: the
Third or Inmost Heaven is the Supreme ; the Second or
Middle Heaven is beneath it ; and the First Heaven is
the lowest of all. All the Societies in each of the Hea
vens are distinguished in like manner ; as for example,
those Societies which are stationed in places of the high
est eminence, having the appearance of mountains, see
a. 188. are thus distinguished: they who are of the
greatest excellence, and of the quality of the Angels of
the Third Heaven, have their dwelling on the summits ;
they who resemble more the Angels of the Second Hea
ven, are ranked beneath them ; and they who come nearer
to the Angels of the First Heaven are classed still lower;
and the same regulations are observed both in the supe
rior and the inferior situations. A Society of a superior
Heaven has its Communication with that of its inferior
Heaven only by Correspondency ; see above, n. 100;
Hence the conjunction of Good and Truth, n, 3834, 4096, 4097—7623

172 A treatise concerning
and Communication by Correspondency is that which we
call Influx.
208. It is the Lord only that conjoins Heaven with
Heaven, or the Society of one Heaven with that of ano
ther, and this by Influx immediate or mediate ; immedi
ate from himself, and mediate through the superior to
the inferior Heavens. (152) As the conjunction of the
Heavens is from the Lord only, so it is carefully provid
ed, that no Angel of a superior Heaven look into any So
ciety of an inferior Heaven, or converse with any there;
for no sooner should he do this, than he would be depriv
ed of his understanding and wisdom, and that through
the following cause : every Angel has three degrees of
life, answering to the three degrees of Heaven ; they
who are in the Inmost Heaven, have the third or inmost
degree of life open, and the second and first shut : they
who are in the Middle Heaven, have the second degree
open, and the fint and third shut: and they who are in
the Lowest Heaven, have the first degree open, and the
second and third shut : as soon therefore as an Angel of
the Third Heaven looks down upon any Society in the
Second, and converses with any therein, his third degree
of life is shut, whereby he is deprived of his wisdom,
which lies only in the third degree of life, for he has
none in the second or first ; according to which meaning
are those words of our Lord, Mat. xxiv. 17, 18. " Let
" not him which is on the house top come down to take
" any thing out of his house ; neither let him which is in
" the field return back to take his clothes :" and also in
Luke xvii. 31,32. " In that day he which shall be on the
" house top, and his stuff" in the house, let him not come
" down to take it away ; and he that is in the field, let
" him likewise not return back : remember Lot's wife."
209. There is no influx from the inferior Heavens to
the superior, this being contrary to the laws of Order,
(152) That Influx is two-fold, immediate from the Lord, and me
diate through Heaven, n. 6063, 6307, 6472, 9682, 9683. That im-.
mediate Influx from the Lord extends to the most minute particulars
, of things, n. 6058,' 6474 to 6478, 8717,8728. Of the mediate Influx
of the Lord through the Heavens, n. 4067. 6982, 6985, 6996.

but only from the superior to the inferior; for the wis
dom of the Angels of a superior Heaven, as fa- exceeds
that of an Angel of an inferior Heaven, as a myriad ex
ceeds an unit, which is the reason why the Angels of an
inferior cannot converse with those of a superior Heaven,
nor can they see them when they look up, their Heaven
being, with respect to them, veiled as it were, with a dark
mist ; but the Angels of a superior Heaven can see those
beneath them, but not converse with them, but at the
peril of being deprived of their wisdom, as was said be
fore.
210. The thoughts, affections and discourse of the
Angels of the Inmost Heaven, come not within the ap
prehension of those of the Middle Heaven, as far trans
cending their capacities ; but at times, as the Lord sees
fit, there appears thence in the inferior Heavens a kind of
flame-coloured phenomenon ; and from the Middle Hea
ven into the lowest, a lucid Form, and sometimes a
white or party-coloured cloud, from the ascent, descent
or shape of which they are able to form some judgment
concerning what they are discoursing of above.
- 211. What has been said on this subject may serve to
give the reader an idea of the Form of Heaven, and how
that of the Inmost Heaven is the most perfect ; that of

plicable and past comprehension this wonderful struc
ture of man is, may appear even from a general view of
the nervous fibres whereof its several parts are compacted,
and which are so extremely small, as to escape the notice
of the sharpest sight in their several meanders and transits
in the brain, which assumes its soft medulary, and almost
fluid substance from their innumerable complications;
and yet, through their mediate instrumentality, all the
operations of the will and intellect pass into their respec
tive distinct acts and forms ; and how they meet again to
form admirable complications in different parts of the
body, appears from the various plexus or folds in the
heart, mesentery, and other regions of the body; and
also from those nodes or network, called ganglions, where
many fibres from different provinces of the human mi
crocosm meet to form their proper combinations, and
thence proceed in their various intertextures to discharge
other functions in their progress, and that by sundry re
petitions; besides other like offices in every bowel, mem
ber, organ and muscle in the body. The artist, who
with a discerning eye and a reflecting mind, views all this
and many other admirable contrivances in the human
structure, must stand astonished at the skill of the Di

therein by the eye, though assisted by the best glasses,
are but few in comparison of those still more wonderful
things concealed from us in the deep of interior nature.

is evident from the operations of the understanding and

that which is the form of thought and will, is also the
form of understanding and wisdom. Such is the human
form as corresponding to the form of Heaven, and may
serve to give us some idea of the extension appertaining
to the affections and thoughts of angels, and how their
understanding and wisdom are in proportion to their de
gree of perfection as to that form. That the form of
Heaven is from the Divine humanity of our Lord, see
above, n. 78 to 86. These things are offered to the rea
der, with a design to shew, that the form of Heaven is a
subject of such vast extent as not to be exhausted, even
with respect to generals, and consequently not to be
comprehended even by the minds of Angels, as was be
fore observed.
OF THE GOVERNMENTS IN HEAVEN.
213. AS Heaven is distinguished into societies, the
greater of which consist of some hundred thousands of
from the disorder occasioned in the understanding through a disteth-
pered state of the brain, or any injury sustained by it ; for beginning ,
at the wrong end, and tracing the intellectual operations from organ
ized matter, as the source and cause of them, they infer that the cause
being vitiated or taken away, the effect must necessarily cease ;
whereas perception, thought, and memory, do not flow from the
brain, but from the mind into
it,
a* the proper recipient thereof, for
the manifestation of these powers in outward nature
:
the defect or
destruction of the organ occasions no annihilation or loss of the intel
lect, for that remains still the same in its own spiritual principle or
world
;
but only hinders its influx into another condition of existence,
and so from manifesting its operations in this outward natural world.
The sour and its mind are absolutely independent on this mortal bo>
dy
;
they communicate to
it,
but receive nothing from
it,
though
they reach to natural things by means of and through
it
;
they live,
even during their union with the body, in the spiritual world in their
own spiritual body, and here only by communication with this organ
ized natural body
;
so much depends on assigning to influx its proi
per source and progress, even the whole of the difference between
infidelity syid beheving rightly. See Thevtofihic Lucubration, p. 23,
2-4.

176 A treatise concerning
b
Angels, li. 50; and as all in the same society are in the
like good, but not alike in wisdom, n. 43 ; it therefore
necessarily follows that there must be governments there,
for order in every society is of necessary observation and
use; however, Governments in the Heavens are of va
rious kinds, . some respecting the societies which consti
tute the Lord's celestial kingdom, and others respecting
those which constitute his spiritual kingdom : and they
also differ with regard to the difference of office and mi
nistry appointed to societies in particular ; but then it
must be noted, that in the Heavens there is no kind of
government differing from that of mutual love, for this
is universally the heavenly government..
214. The Government in the Lord's celestial king
dom, or third Heaven, is called justice [Righteous
ness,] as all there are in the good of love to the Lord,
from the Lord ; and all that proceeds from that principle
is called Just [Righteous.] Here the Lord is the sole
Governor, guiding the Angels himself, and teaching
them the ways of life they should walk in, and writing
on their hearts those truths, which are called the Truths
of Judgment ; insomuch that every one there sees and
knows them, (153) and therefore there is no controversy
on these subjects among them, but their thoughts and
'conversation turn chiefly on, things pertaining to righte-
ousnesness and holiness of life : they who are less wise
consult those who excel in wisdom, and the latter ask
counsel of the Lord, who vouchsafes to give them an
swers ; upon the whole,
it.
is
their heaven and highest
joy to live righteously and holily under the influence and
government of the Lord.
(153) That the celestial angels do not think and reason of truths
like the spiritual angels, seeing that they are in the perception or
immediate institution of all things relating to truth, by the gift of the
Lord,- n.,202, 597, 607, 784 —8780, 9277, 10336. That the celes
tials, where truths arc the subjects of conversation, only say concern
ing such subjects, The matter
is
so, or
is
not so; whereas the spi
ritual angels reason concerning them, as whether the matter be so
or not, n. 2715, 3246, 4446, 9166, 10786; where
is

2 15. The Government in the Lord's spiritual king
dom is called Judgment, the. subjects of it being in spi
ritual good, which is the good of charity towards our
neighbour, and in its essence is truth; (154) for truth
relates to judgment, and good to righteousness. (155)
These also are under the Lord's guidance, but mediately
by others, n. 208 ; and accordingly they have rulers,
more or fewer, according to the exigencies of that parti
cular society to which they belong : they live together
under laws which are well understood and observed by
their rulers in the administration of their office ; and
when any difficulty or doubt arises, they receive light
from the Lord.
216. As that Government which is from good,* as in
the Lord's celestial kingdom, is called Righteousness;
and that which is from Truth, as in his Spiritual King
dom, is called Judgment ; therefore the terms Justice or
Righteousness, and Judgment, are used in Scripture-
language, where Heaven and the Church are the subjects
treated of, and there, by Justice or Righteousness is sig
nified Celestial Good, and by Judgment, Spiritual Good,
which latter, as was said before, in its essence is Truth :
(154) That the angels of the spiritual kingdom are more for in
tellectuals, or the knowledge of truths ; and those of the celestial
are more in good, n. 863, 875, 927—5113, 9596.
( 1
55) That justice or righteousness, in the Word, is predicated of
good, and judgment of truth ; and therefore to exercise righteous
ness and judgment signifies to practice both goodness and truth, n.
2335, 9857. That great judgments signify the laws of divine order,
or divine truths, n. 7206.
* Let it be observed here, by way of caution against mistake, that
our Author never uses the terms good and truth in the way of con
tradistinction, or as though cither could subsist entirely separate from
the other; and therefore where he speaks of some angels being in
(the principle of) good, and others in the (principle of) truth, it means
only that the former were more eminent for love in the affectionate
part, than for knowledge in the intellectual, and so vice versa : but
no angel can be destitute of either, however they may differ in the
degrees of the one or the other. In like manner, when we mean to
distinguish any one more particularly by the name of a good man ;
this does not imply that he is deficient in the intellectual part or
knowledge of truth, but only that goodness forms the more distill-
guishing part of his character.

" to establish with judgment and with justice, from

henceforth even for ever," Isaiah ix. 7. By David in
this place is meant the Lord, (156) and by his Kingdom,
Heaven, as appears from the following words :
" I will
" raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall
" reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and

" alted, for he dwelleth on high : and hath filled Zion

5. By Zion here is meant Heaven and the Church. (157)
"I am the Lord exercising loving kindness, judgment
" and righteousness in the earth : for in these things
" I delight, saith the Lord," Jer. ix. 24. " I will betroth
" thee unto me for ever ; yea, I will betroth thee unto

"judgments are a great deep,'? Psalm xxxvi. 6,7.

217. In the Lord's Spiritual Kingdom are different
Forms of Government in different Societies, according
to the various offices and ministrations of those societies,
and those answer to the functions of the several parts in
man, which every one knows are manifold : thus one
function belongs to the heart, another to the lungs ; and
so in like manner, the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, and
every organ of sense, &c. have each their several offices ;
and according to their different ministrations in the body
are those of the Angelical Societies corresponding there
to ; for that there is a Correspondence between all things
in Heaven, and all things in man, has been shewed be-

vernment agree in this, that they are all calculated to pro
mote the good of the whole, and of every member ia
particular; (158) and this, because all throughout the
universal Heaven are under the care and guidance of the
Lord, who loves them all, and has therefore so constitut
ed the good of the community, that every individual finds
his own private good connected with
it,
and receives of
it
in proportion to his love for the community
;
for in
loving the whole he loves every one, and according to
the extent of his love (which

a
Divine Gift) he
is
belo
ved of the Lord, and is blessed in the same degree.
218. Hence we may form
a
judgment of the character
of their rulers, viz. that they are such as excel in love and
wisdom, and consequently affectionately wish the good
of all, and are endowed with knowledge sufficient to ef
fect
it
:
now, they who are of this character, are not giv
en to behave lordly and imperiously over those that' are
subject to them, but minister to and serve them; for, to
do good to others from love,
is
to serve them, and to pro
vide the means of their receiving
it,
is
to minister to
them: nor do they esteem themselves greater, but less
than others, for they have respect to the good of the com
munity and of their neighbour in the first place, and of
their own but subsequently
;
now that which
is
first
is
greater than that which follows
:
however, honour and
pre-eminence are assigned them, for they are situated in
the centre of their Society, in places somewhat exalted
above their brethren, and dwell in magnificent palaces
;
and they accept of these honourable distinctions, not for

Hence
it
is, that charity towards our neighbour extends to all the.
particulars of the Life of Man, and that to do good from the love of
good and truth
;
and to do justice from the love of justice in all the
offices and relations of life,
is
the sum and complex of charity to our
neighbour, n. 2417/8121, 81 -'4.

their own sakes, but for the sake of obedience, to the
end all may know, that as they are appointed for them of
the Lord, so they are to pay them obedience as gover
nors instituted by him. Alluding to what has been said
are those words of our Lord to his disciples ; " Whoso
ever will be great among you, let him be your minister ;
and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
servant, even as the Son of Man came not to be minister
ed unto, but to minister," Matt. xx. 26, 27, 28. " He
that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger,
and he that is chief as he that doth serve," Luke xxii. 26.
219. Every family also is a Government in a lower
Form ; for there is master and servants, and the master
loves his servants, and the servants their master, and so
serve each other from love ; whilst the master instructs
them how they are to live, and what they are to do ; and
the servants on their part, discharge the duties belonging
to them ; and let it be noted, that to be useful is their
highest delight; for the Lord's Kingdom is the Kingdom
of Uses.
220. There are Governments also in the Hells, for
otherwise the infernals could not be kept within bounds ;
but the Governments there are of an opposite nature to
those in the Heavens, as being founded in self-love, eve
ry one striving to be the greatest, and domineering over
others, and pursuing all that refuse to be subject to them,
with hatred "and revenge, such being the nature of self-
love : therefore they have the most fierce and malignant
for their rulers, that they may obey through fear :

Heaven and Hell. 1 8&
OF DIVINE WORSHIP IN HEAVEN.
221. DIVINE Worship in Heaven is not unlike that
on earth, as to the external part, though with regard to (
the internal there is a difference : they have their doctrines,
their preachings, and their temples, asVe have ; and their
doctrines in all essential points perfectly agree together,
but of more interior wisdom in the superior Heavens than
in the inferior, and their preachings are according to
their doctrines : and as they have houses and palaces, n.
183 to 190, so likewise have they temples to preach in.
That these things are so in the Heavens, is because the
Angels continually advance to higher degrees of perfec
tion in wisdom and love, for they have understanding and
will like men, and those are capable of such proficiency,
the understanding in intellectual truths, and the will in
the various species of good arising from love. (160)
222. But the true Divine Worship is not considered
in the Heavens, as consisting in frequenting the temples,
and hearing preachings ; but in a life of love, charity and
faith, according to the doctrines received, preaching serv»
ing only as the means of instruction in things pertaining
to life. I have conversed with the Angels on this subject,
and told them that it is the general belief in this .world,
that Divine Worship consists only in frequenting the
churches, hearing sermons, receiving the sacrament of
the supper three or four times a year, and observing
other rites instituted by the church, together with attend
ing at the public prayers with reverence and devotion :
to which the Angels replied, that these external things
ought to be observed, but that they availed nothing, if
they did not proceed from an inward good principle, and
that this consisted in a life according to sound doctrine.
(160) That the intellect is the recipient of Truth, and the will q£
Good, n. 3623, 6125, 7503, 9300, 9930. As all things have some re
lation to Good and Truth, so all things in the life of Man to the un
derstanding and will, n. 803, 10122. That the Angels advance in
degrees of perfection eternally, n. 4803, 6640.

o
223. That I might be an eye-witness to the manner of
their assemblies in their Temples, I have been indulged
with permission to enter them, and hear the preachings.
The preacher stands in a pulpit on the East side ; before
him sit those who are most eminent for wisdom, and on
each hand such as are inferior in this respect : they sit in
something of a circular form, so that all can see the face
of the Preacher, but no one so as to be out of his sight:
at the gate, which is on the East side of the Temple, to
the left of the pulpit, stand those who are in the degree of
the newly initiated; but no one is allowed to stand be
hind the pulpit; for should any one do so, it would con
fuse the preacher, as would also be the case, should any
one present dissent, from his doctrine ; and if this were to
happen, such a one would be obliged to turn away his
face from the Minister. The preachings there are fraught
with such sublime instruction, as is not to be equalled
in this world, so greatly superior is their wisdom. Their
Temples in the Spiritual Kingdom appear to be con
structed of Stone, and of Wood in the Celestial, and that
because stone corresponds to truth, for the investigation
of which the Angels of the former are more distinguish
ed ; and wood to the principle of good, which is more
eminently the characteristic of the Angels in the latter ;
(161) nor are they called Temples in the latter, but the
House of God. In the Celestial Kingdom their struc
tures are without magnificence, but in the Spiritual, not
without a greater or lesser degree of it.
224. I had some discourse with one of their preachers
concerning the pious dispositions of their hearers during
their assemblies, who said, that the degree of piety, de
votion, and holiness in every one, was in proportion to
his love and faith within, as all sanctity is from the inter
nal presence and grace of the Lord, and that without
these he could not see what an apparent external sanctity
availed ; and then reflecting a little on the latter, he far-

8609, 10376. That Wood signifies Good, n. 643, 3720, 1354; that
therefore the most ancient of our ancestors, as being of Celestial
Good, dwelt in houses of wood, n. 3720.

thcr added, that there might be something like sanctity in
the outward practice and behaviour, either acquired arti
ficially, or assumed in hypocrisy, but that without the
internal of holiness in the heart, all was no better than a
false fire kindled by the love of self, and to catch the
praise of men.
225. All the Preachers are of the Lord's Spiritual
"
Kingdom, for none belong to his Celestial ; and the rea
son of this is, because in the former they are in the pro
vince of Truths from Good, and all preaching must be
from Truths ; whereas in the Celestial Kingdom, they
are all in the province of the Good of Love, which prin
ciple gives them an intuitive perception of all Truths, so
that they have no occasion to discourse of them ; howe
ver, notwithstanding they are not without their public
instructions, as well for illustration of the Truths they
already know, as to enrich them with a farther increase,
which, as soon as offered, they own and perceive, with
out speculating or reasoning upon them ; and what they
so perceive they graft in their hearts, and bring forth in
their lives, it being usual with them to say, that to live
according to his Truths, is to love the Lord. (162)
226. All the Preachers are of the Lord's appointment,
and accordingly endowed with the gift of preaching, nor
are any others allowed to teach in the Temples : they are
called Preachers, and not Priests, and that because the
Celestial Kingdom is the Priesthood of Heaven, foras
much as Priesthood signifies the Good of Love to the
Lord, in which are all the Angels of that Kingdom ;
whereas the Spiritual Kingdom is called the Royalty of
Heaven, for the Koyal or Kingly office signifies Truth
as proceeding from Good ; see above, n. 24. (163)

the perception and capacities of the Angels therein re
spectively ; and it is an essential point in all their doc
trines to inculcate the belief of the Lord's Divine Huma
nity,
OF THE POWER OF THE ANGELS.
228. SUCH as have no notion of the Spiritual World,
and its influx into the natural, will not be able to form
an idea of the power of the Angels, supposing, because
they are spiritual, and not visible to us, that such pure,
immaterial beings must be destitute of power ; but they
who think deeper have different sentiments of this mat
ter, as knowing that all power in man is from his intel
lect and will, which constitute his spiritual man, and
without which he could not give motion to any part of
his body, it being therefrom that his whole corporeal
frame receives direction in all its movements; thus, what
the mind thinks, the mouth and tongue utter ; and that
which the will commands, the body and its members
obey, the intellect and will being subject to the govern
ment of the Lord, through the ministry of Angels and
Spirits, and consequently all the bodily functions depend
ing thereon ; and, however incredible it may seem, man
would not be able to move a single step without influx
from the Heavenly Word. Of this truth I had full ex
perience at such times as it has been given to the Angels
[without my concurrence] to govern my actions and to
move my steps, tongue and speech at their pleasure, and
that by [sensible} influx into my mind and will, inso-

thing as of myself: after which they told me, that every
one was actuated in like manner, as he might learn from
the doctrine of the Church, and from the Scriptures, be

spire him what to think, and what to speak, and the like ;
though at other times, when this doctrine is out of his
mind, he believes and speaks differently. This instance
is given, to shew the power and the influence of the An
gels with man.
229. The power of the angels in the spiritual world is
so exceeding great, that were I to relate the proofs of it
which I have seen, they would exceed belief. If at any
time aught should happen there to obstruct the establish- /
ed laws of government and peace, and therefore to be re
moved as contrary to divine order, they subdue and ba
nish it with a mere effort oftheir will, or even with a for
bidding countenance ; so have I seen mountains that had
been occupied by evil spirits, cast down and overturned,
or shaken from top to bottom, as by an earthquake ; rocks
also rent asunder to their very foundations, and the evil
spirits upon them swallowed up ; nay, I have seen some
hundred thousands of such scattered before them, and
by their power cast into their proper hells; for neither
numbers, policy, nor confederacies avail aught against
them, for they discover their most subtle devices in the
twinkling of an eye, and discomfit all their adversaries in
a moment :* see more on this subject in the account of

appear to the general pre-conceived opinions concerning the heaven
ly worlds, and the established laws of harmony, peace and bliss tliere-
in ; it is far from incredible (setting aside his authority) that the set
tled course of things in those blessed regions may admit of some va
riation on certain occasions, and for wise purposes, by divine per
mission and appointment : thus, for example, the admission of evil
spirits into the heavenly kingdoms at particular times may answer
the following good ends, viz. to confound and mortify their pride, and
the vain conceits of their own sufficiency as to strength, subtlety, and
numbers, alid to humble them the more under their disappointments

Babylon destroyed. Such Power have the holy Angels
in the spiritual world ; nor have they less in the natural
world, when the Lord sees fit to make use ofdiem there,
as appears from the Scripture of their destroying whole
armies, and of causing a plague, of which no less than,
twenty thousand died ; concerning which angel we read,
that " When the Angel stretched out his hand upon Je-
" rusalem to destroy
it,
the Lord repented him of the
" evil, and said to the angel that destroyed
;
It
is
enough
:
" stay now thine hand
:
and David saw the Angel that
" smote the people,"
2
Sam. xxiv. 16, 17
:
not to men
tion other instances. From the Angels being invested
with such power, they are sometimes called Powers
;
and in David, " Bless the Lord, ye his angels that ex
cel in strength." Ps. ciii. 20.
230. But we must take with us, that the Angels have
not this power from themselves, but wholly from the
Lord, and that they are only so far Powers, as they ac
knowledge
it
;
for should any of them believe that such
power belonged to himself, he would instantly become
so weak as not to be able to contend with one evil spi
pf place, but in condition of existence, that happiness or misery con
sists; and that therefore, as evil spirits, they are and must be impo
tent ami miserable, and carry their hell within them. On the ether
hand, to the good angels
it
may serve as
a
salutary memento (and
iv hat created beings ara without all need of it?) of due gratilude to
him, who hath so made them to difler from others once of the same
species with themselves
;
to confirm them in pious humility, adora
tion and love to their Divine Benefactor
;
and prompt them with
greater alacrity to praise and glorify him for their victory and tri
umph over all that might otherwise offend or hurt them
:
and we
may add to the foregoing considerations the following one, viz. that
certain interruptions, even in bliss, may serve to give
a
higher relish
to the returns of it; and that perfect happine*s, without some degrees
of abatement at times, may be incompatible with the nature of cre-
ted beings
:
and
it
may farther be remarked, that were an invariable
administration of government in Heaven and Earth to take place, all
proof of the divine liberty and interposition, together with the uses
arising from the belief of them, would be removed, and the notion
of fatality be substituted in their stead
:
some vicissitudes and inter
ruptions may therefore be appointed to obviate such errors, as also
to keep dependent creatures under
a
constant sense of their depend
ence, and to answer many purposes of good, both to men and angels
that they know not. Tr.

as belonging to them, and ascribe the praise of what they
do to God only.
231. All power in the Heavens is from divine truth
proceeding from the Lord, as he is essentially divine
truth united with divine good ; see n. 126 to 140 ; and
as far forth as the angels are recipients thereof, so far are
they Powers, (164) and in the same measure each is true
and good, or endued with understanding and will, their
co-relatives; or, in other words, according to their de
gree of divine goodness and truth from the Lot d, so far
is each his own good and truth, (165) and so far excels
in power; and as there is the like variety in Heaven as
in earth, so no two angels are exactly equal in the above
respects, nor consequently in Power: they who consti
tute the province of die arms are invested with the great
est power, as they most excel in truths, which are re
plenished with good from the universal heaven, like as
the strength {of the whole body transfers itself to and ex
erts itself in the arms : hence it is that power is express
ed and signified in Scripture by the arms and hands. (166)
In heaven is sometimes the emblematical appearance of
a naked arm, apparently of strength sufficient to break in
pieces the hardest rock ; it once came very near me, and
seemed as if it could bruise my bones to powder.

theless, their reception of divine truth is in proportion to
their reception of divine good, for truths have all their
power from good, and none without
it,
as good exerts
all its power through truths, and none without them
:
it
is
from the conjunction of both, that Power exists
;
and
the case
is
the same with faith and love

for whether we
call

faith or truth,
it
is
all one, because the whole of

the same, as the whole of love

the power of the Angels
is
through truths from good [per

spirit, when viewed intently by the angels, presently
falls, as
it
were into a swoon, and loses the appearance
of

the
cause of which

that the sight of the angels

OF THE SPEECH OF THE ANGELS.
234. THE Angels converse together, as we do on
earth, and in like manner on various subjects, whether
of a domestic, civil, moral, or spiritual nature; nor is
there any difference between them and us in this respect,
than that their conversation is more intellectual, as coming
from a deeper ground. I have been permitted to be often
in their company, and to converse with them as a friend
with friends, and sometimes as a stranger with strangers ;
and at such times, from the similarity of our states, it
appeared to me as if I were conversing with men on
earth.
235. The speech of angels is equally divided into
Words with our's, and alike sonorous and audible, for
they have mouths, tongues and ears, as we have, and
also an atmosphere to give articulation to their speech ;
but then that atmosphere is spiritual, accommodated to
their nature, and they make the same use of it for respi
ration and enunciation, as we do of our atmosphere.
(170)
236. There is but one language used throughout hea
ven, so that all of every society, however distant, under
stand one another: nor is that language learnt, but natu
ral to every one, flowing spontaneously from their affec
tions and thoughts, whilst the sound of the voice corres
ponds to the affection, and the articulation of that sound,
or the words, to the ideas of the thoughts proceeding
from that affection ; and as their language corresponds
thereto, it is also spiritual, and may be called a sounding
affection, and a speaking thought. Whoever considers
the matter attentively, may know that all thought pro-

to the difference of their states, n. 1 19, 3886, 3387, 3889, 3892, 3893.

190 A treatise concerning
eeeds from some affection of Jove, and that the ideas of
the mind are so many different forms into which the com
mon affection diffuses itself, for every idea which is the
object of thought owes its existence td some affection.
Hence it is that the angels know the disposition and qua
lities of another from his speech, his affection from the
sound of his voice, and his intellectual quality from the
articulations of that sound in his words j and such of the
angels as are eminent in wisdom can tell from a sentence
or two what is the ruling passion in another, which is a
thing they principally attend to. That every one is sen
sible of various affections by turns, is very well known,
as of one merry, of another when sad, of another under
the prevailing influence of mercy and pity, of another
when in sincerity and truth, of another in love and cha
rity, of another when in deceit and guile, of another
when actuated by zeal or anger, and of another in the
pursuit of honour and fame, and so on ; but yet the prin
cipal or ruling love is more or less in all of these differ
ent affections, insomuch that the more eminently wise
among the angels, who have a quick discernment in this
matter, can judge of the state of another by his speech :
and that this is so, it has been given me to know from full
experience : I have heard the angels declare what life an
other person has led from only hearing him speak ; nay,
that they could discern all the particulars of the life of
another from certain ideas in his mind, as knowing there
by his ruling passion, which enters into all the divisions
of
it,
and exhibits
a
register or book of the life.
237. The language of the Angels has nothing in
it
common with that of men, except in certain words which
express an affection, and that, not with the words them
selves, but only with the sound of them, of which here
after
;
and that this
is
so, appeared to me from the angels
not being able to utter one word in any human language,
after repeated trials,
it
being impossible for them to utter
any thing which does not correspond with their affection,
for what
is
not so,
is
contrary to their principle of life,
which
is
from affection, and from which they speak
:
they informed me, that the first language of the human

race here on earth, was of the like kind, as being of hea
venly extraction : and that the Hebrew language in some
words is conformable thereto.
238. As the Speech of the Angels corresponds to
some affection of their love, and as the love of Heaven is
love to the Lord and to their neigbour, see n: 13 to 19,
we may hence gather how harmonious and delightful
their Speech must be, for it not only pleases the ear, but
also exhilerates the minds of those that hear it. A certain
hard-hearted spirit being once on a time in conversation
with an angel,* he was so charmed with the Speech,
that he shed tears, owning that he could not refrain,
though he had never done the like before, saying that it
seemed to him as if Love itself had spoken with a tongue.
239. The discourse of the Angels is full of wisdom,
as proceeding from a deep ground, and as their interior
thoughts are wisdom, so their interior affection is love,
which both unite in their expression. Hence it is, that
they possess so copious a wisdom, as to be able to ex
press more in one word than we can do in a thousand,
and that they comprehend in their ideas such things as
the mind of man is not capable to receive, much less to
express ; wherefore it is said of the things heard and
seen in Heaven, that they are unutterable, and such as
ear hath not heard, nor eye seen : and the truth of this
has been given me to know by experience j for having
been sometimes translated into the angelic state, and
given to converse with the angels in that state, I at such

the Author, viz. that no bad spirit (as every hard hearted one must
needs be) can stand before an angel, or bear the efflux or virtue pro
ceeding from him, as
a
surrounding sphere, without the greatest
confusion and dismay
;
yet
it
is
to be noted, that on particular occa
sions, and to answer certain purposes, according to the Lord's good
pleasure, the laws and properties of the heavenly world are sus
pended or so qualified, as to admit of conferences between the an
gels and evil spirits, frequent instances of which are to be met with
in our author's writings. The reader
is
here cautioned against be
ing stumbled upon his meeting with some few things that he cannot
easily reconcile, as in the farther course of his reading, or in the
translator's notes, he probably will find matters cleared up to his
satisfaction. Tr.

192 A treatise concerning
times understood all that I heard from them; but when,
upon being restored to my former state and natural way
of conceiving things, I endeavoured tc recollect what I
had so heard and understood, I was by no n.eans able to
do
it,
there having been
a
thousand things incommensu
rate to the natural'mind, and therefore not to be commu
nicated by human words, but by the variegations Of hea
venly light. The ideas in the thoughts of the angels,
which form their words, are likewise modifications of
the light of heaven, and their affections, which produce
the sound of their words, are so many variations of the
heat of Heaven
;
for as the light of Heaven
is
divine
truth or wisdom, so the heat of Heaven
is
divine good
or love
;
see above, n. 126 to 140
:
and as the angels
derive their affections from divine love, so do they think
from divine wisdom. (171)
249. As the Speech of the Angels proceeds immedi
ately from their affection, (for, as was said before, n. 236,
their ideas in thinking are so many different forms, into
which the common affection
is
distributed) so they can
express in
a
minute, things which man could not do in
less than half an hour, and also the contents of several
pages in
a
few words, as
I
have often experienced. (172)
The ideas in the thinking of the Angels, and their words
in
speaking, are one as cause and effect, the former be
ing the producer, and the latter the product
;
whence
it
is,
that every word comprehends so much
:
when the
flow of thoughts and words of the angels
is
at any time
represented under
a
visible appearance,
it
resembles
a
thin undulating fluid
;
or
a
circumfluent atmosphere, in
which appear innumerable things in wonderful order
flowing from the fountain of their wisdom, which make
delightful impressions on the mind of the spectator
;

it
is
to be observed here, that the ideas of the minds both

ing to divine permission. ( 1
73)
241. The Angels of the Lord's Celestial Kingdom
speak in like manner as do the Angels of his Spiritual
Kingdom [the Middle Heaven] but the former from a
deeper ground than the latter ; for as the Celestial An
gels are in the good of love to the Lord, they speak from
wisdom ; and the Spiritual Angels, who are more dis
tinguished for their good of love to their neighbour,
(which in its essence is Truth, n. 215) they speak from
intellectual knowledge ; for as Wisdom is from Good,
so the latter is from Truth. Hence it
is,
that the Speech
of the Celestials may he compared to
a
smooth, gently
flowing water
;
but that of the Spiritual Angels, to
a
cur
rent somewhat interrupted and broken
:
the Speech of
the former sounds much from the vowels £7 and
0,
and
that of the latter from the vowels E and
/
;
for as the
sound
is
in the vowels, so the affection
is
in the sound
:
for, as was said above, n. 236, the sound in the Speech of
the Angels corresponds to affection, and the articulations
of the sound, which are the words, correspond to their
ideas derived from such affection
:
and forasmuch as the
vowels do not properly constitute any part of the lan
guage, but only serve to give sound to the words ac
cording to the various affections of every one's state
;
therefore
it
is, that in the Hebrew language the vowels
are not written, and also are differently pronounced
;
and
from the difference in sounding the vowels, the Angels
can distinguish the particular affection and love of the
Speaker. The Speech of the Celestial Angels
is
without

1<H A treatise concerning
hard consonants, and they seldom utter two words toge
ther, where the former ends and the latter begins with a
consonant, but interpose a third beginning with a vowel ;
whence it comes to pass, that the little word and is so of
ten met with in the Hebrew Bible, as that word in the
Hebrew language has a soft sound, and both begins and
ends with a vowel : by the Scripture words also in that
language may partly be known, whether they belong to
the Celestial or Spiritual Class, and so relate to Good or
to Truth, the former sounding mostly from U and G,
and partly from A, and the latter from E and /: and as
the affections principally distinguish themselves by
sounds, therefore in the human language, when any
thing of an exalted nature is the subject, as Heaven and
God, we give the preference to such words, whereby to
express them, as have U or O in them : and also when
we would express any thing sublime, in Music, we na
turally swell those notes which come nearest the sound
bf those vowels, but not so, when things of an inferior na
ture are the subject. Hence it is, that the art of Music
is so aptly suited to express the affections and passions of
the human mind.
242. In the Speech and Conversation of the Angels,
there is an expressible kind of harmony (
1 74) arising from
this cause ; viz. That their affections and thinking from
which they speak, are according to the laws and form of
Heaven, which are the bond of their union and commu
nications. That the Angels are consociated according
to the form of Heaven, and that their thoughts and af

243. There is an innate language in man, similar to
that in the Spiritual World, but in his interior intellec
tual part ; but as it does not manifest itself in man in
words analagous to the affection, as it does in the Angels,
therefore he knows not that it is in him ; yet from hence
it is, that when he enters into the. other life, his language
is the same with that of the Spirits and Angels there,

this subject hereafter.
244. They have all one and the same language in Hea
ven, as was said before, though with this difference, that
the Speech of the Angels, who are most eminent for wis
dom, is more inward, and abounds with greater variety
in the affections, and also in the ideas, than that of the
inferior Angels : and as to such of them as are more in
simplicity, their conversation is still more exterior and
in words, to be understood after the manner of men:
there is also a kind of conversing by the face, terminat
ing in sound, which is modified by the ideas : there is
also a kind of conversing together, wherein representa*
tions of heavenly things are mixed with their ideas, and
the latter exhibit themselves, in visible forms : there is an
other by gestures corresponding to affections, and repre
sentative of things in like manner as words are : there is
moreover among them, a manner of conversing by general
affections and general thoughts ; and also a rumbling way
of speaking like the rolling of thunder: and others be
sides.
245. The language and speech of the bad and Infernal
Spirits is likewise natural to them, as proceeding from
their affections also ; but such affections as are evil, and
from such impure ideas as originate from those affections,
and which the Angels are highly averse to, so great is
the contrariety between infernal and heavenly things, in
somuch that they cannot endure one another ; the speech
of the Infernals being as stink in the nostrils of the An
gels. The language of those hypocrites, who are used
to counterfeit Angels of Light, in words resembles that
of the Angels, but with respect to the affections and
ideas that are concealed under
it,
it
is
quite contrary

as it is by the wiser Angels, the sound of their voice
seems like the gnashing of teeth, exciting horror.
OF THE CONVERSATION OF THE ANGELS WITH
MAN.
246. WHEN Angels converse with any Man, they
do not speak their own language, but that of the Man,
or any other that he is acquainted with, but never in an.
unknown tongue ; and that because the Angels at such
times turn and join themselves to him, and from such
conjunction they both come to be in a like mode of
thinking; and as man's thinking coheres with his me
mory, and his speaking proceeds from both, therefore
they are both in one language : besides, an Angel or Spi-
ritj when he comes to any man, and fronts him, so as to
be joined to him, enters into the whole of his memory so
far as that in a manner it becomes his own, insomuch,
that he can hard ly discern between the man's knowledge
and his own, and the same with regard to his language.
I have conversed with the angels on this subject, and
told them, that perhaps they might imagine, according to
appearance, that they spake with me in my own native
language ; whereas it was not they, but I. who spake it ;
and that this might be evidenced, in that Angels were
not able to utter a single word of any human language,
see n. 237, for that being natural, and they spiritual,
they could not possibly effect that which was of a nature
different from themselves ; to which they replied, that
they well knew that their communion with any man they
conversed with, was with his spiritual thinking part;
but as this passed by influx into his natural thoughts, and
these cohered with his memory ; it must therefore appear
to them as if his human language and science were
their's, and that this was by Divine Appointment, to tho

end that such union and communion between Heaven
and Man might be effected ; but that the condition of the
human nature was at this time so altered, that such com
munion between Man and Angels could no longer take
place, but only between him and other Spirits. I have
also conversed with, Spirits on the same subject, who
would not be convinced, that it was Man that spake, not
they in him, nor yet that the knowledge in the mind of
man (during their communion with him) was not their
own : I endeavoured to prove the contrary to them by
many arguments,, but all to no purpose. "Who are meant
by Spirits, and who by Angels, shall be shewed when
we come to treat of the World of Spirits,
247, That Angels and Spirits are so closely united to
Man, that they mistake what belongs to him for their
own, is because the spiritual and natural Worlds are so
nearly connected, in Man, that they in a manner make
but one : now as Man had separated himself from Hea
ven, provision was made in mercy by the Lord, that
there should be Angels and Spirits with every Man, that
he should be governed by him through their ministry,
for which reason there is so strict a communion between
them : but had man not cut off the communication be
tween himself and Heaven, the matter had been other
wise, as in that case he might have been directed and
governed by the Lord through a general influx from
Heaven, without the adjunction and instrumentality of
Spirits and Angels : but more particularly of this, when
we come to treat of the conjunction of Heaven with
Man.
248. When an.Angel or Spirit converses with a Man,
he is heard as plainly as one man is by another, but by
himself only, and not by any of the by-standers ; and the
reason is, because the speech of the Angel or Spirit first
insinuates itself into the thinking faculty of a Man, and
so by a secret passage strikes his organ of hearing from
within ; whereas the voice of one man talking with ano
ther passes into the atmosphere, and strikes the organ of
hearing from without ; hence it comes to pass, that the
speaking of the former is equally audible in many, as the

organ is affected in like manner, though it be by impulse
from within : and that the speaking of an Angel or Spi
rit has this operation on the ear, was evidenced to me
by its having a like effect on the tongue, by its influx on
that member, in which it caused some gentle vibrations,
though not the same sensible motions as when we there
with articulate our words.
249. To hold converse with Spirits is rarely permitted
at this day, as being dangerous, (176) for in such cases
the Spirits are given to know that they are in company
with a Man, which they would not know otherwise ; and
so great is the malignity of evil Spirits, that they bear a
mortal hatred to Man, and wish for nothing more than
to injure him in soul and body, in which they too well
succeed with those who abandon themselves to melan
choly phantasies and rigorous mortifications : some also,
who lead solitary lives, hear Spirits talking to them, and
that without any danger, such Spirits being removed
from them at proper intervals by Divine appointment,
that they may not know that they are in company with
Men ; for the greater part of Spirits have no knowledge
of any other world but their own, nor consequently of men;
and therefore no one ought to enter into converse with
them, and therefore give them light in this matter. They
who so addict themselves to musing on religious things,
as to work their minds into superstitious reveries con
cerning them, come in time to hear Spirits talking to
them ; for such religious reveries, where any one wil
fully gives himself up to them \tllis ex se inh<eret\ to the
neglect of relative duties and usefulness in his station,
enter deep, and gain a form in the interior part of Man,
and so taking full possession of him, communicate with
the Spiritual World, and excite certain Spirits there to
-associate with him : such are properly visionaries and

enthusiasts, who believe every Spirit they hear to be the
Holy Spirit, whereas they are no other than enthusiastic
Spirits, who being under delusion themselves, delude
those whom they have access to and influence over ; but
these also are generally removed upon their instigating to
evil. The enthusiastic Spirits are distinguished from
others by their imagining themselves to be the Holy
Ghost, and what they deliver to be divinely oracular :
these Spirits offer no injury to the persons they are associ
ated with, because they receive divine honour from them :
with these also I have sometimes conversed, and so have
had opportunity of detecting the delusions which they
instill into their votaries : their situation is to the left
hand, in a desert region.
250. To converse with Angels is granted to none but
those who are in truths from the source of good, and in
particular to those who are in the Faith of the Lord, and
of the Divinity as in his humanity, for on this Truth the
Heavens are founded, the Lord being the God of Hea
ven, as was said before, n. 2 to 6. The Divinity of the
Lord constitutes Heaven, n. 7 to 12. The Divine Influx
from the Lord in the Angels is love to him, and charity
to their neighbour, n. 13 to 19. The Universal Heaver*
in its complex resembles a Man ; in like manner every
Society in Heaven, and every Angel in particular, is in
a perfect human form, and this from the Divine Huma
nity of the Lord, n. 59 to 86 ; whence we may gather
why to converse with Angels is only granted to those
whose interior is open to the Lord, through the influence
of Divine Truths, as it is through these that the Lord
communicates with Man ; and if the Lord, so Heaven.
That Divine Truth opens the interior of Man, so as to
render it receptive of heavenly communications, is be
cause Man is so created, as to be the Image of Heaven,
as to his inward Man, and the image of this world, as to
his outward Man, n. 57 : and the inward Man is only
opened by Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord, as
this is both the Light and Life of Heaven, n. 126 to 140.

200 A treatist concerning
the forehead of a man corresponds to Love, and the face
to the interior of his mind. (177) The Influx from the
Spiritual Angels to man is all round from his forehead
and temples to every part under which lies the brain, as
that region of the head corresponds to intellect: but the
influx of the Celestial Angels is on that part of the head
which covers the Cerebellum, and is called the Occiput,
or back part of the head round from the ears to the neck,
for that region corresponds to wisdom : when Angels
converse with Man, their Speech enters by these ways
into his thoughts ; hereby I could perceive who the An
gels were that spake with me.
2$2. They who see and converse with the Angels, be
hold also the things that are in Heaven, for they see by
that Heavenly Light which illuminates their interior :
the Angels also through them behold the things on earth;
(178) because through their union Heaven and Earth
are conjoined ; for, as was said above, n. 246, when the
Angels turn themselves to the front of a Man, they are,
as it were, so united to him, that they cannot distinguish
between the things of the Man and their own, and this
not only with respect to speaking, but also to seeing and
hearing; and Man, on the other hand, is apt to think
that what he receives from the Angels by influx, is from
'
himself. In this kind of union with the Angels of Hea
ven were the most ancient of our race on earth, and
therefore the times in which they lived were called the
Golden Age ; and because they acknowledged the Di
vine Nature under a human form, and consequently the
Lord, therefore they had the privilege of conversing with
Angels, as with their familiar friends, and the Angels

sonversed with them in like manner, and so Heaven and
this World became in them as one. But Man since that
time cut himself off successively more and more from
these heavenly communications, by transferring his af
fections from the Lord and from Heaven, to himself and
the world, and so brought himself to relish no other de
lights, but what proceeded from the love of self and of
the world, upon which his internal faculties, before open,
to Heaven, became shut, and his external faculties wide
open to the world ; and where this is the case, man is in
light witlr regard to the things of this World, and in
darkness with regard to the things of Heaven.
253. Since those times, it has rarely happened for any
one to speak with the Angels of Heaven, though some
have with Spirits that are not in Heaven : for the interior
and exterior parts of Man are so constituted, that they
are either turned to the Lord as their common Centre,
n. 124, or to self, and so reversely from the Lord: in
the former case they are turned towards Heaven ; in the
latter towards the world; and where, they have this latter
direction, it is difficult to elevate them to things above ;
yet, as far as such elevation is possible, it is effected by
the Lord through the conversion of their love, which is
wrought by the instrumentality of Truths from the
Word.
254. I have received information in what manner the
Lord spake to the Prophets, through whom the Word
was revealed, and that it was not by influx into their in
terior, according to the manner of his communication
with the ancients, but by emissary Spirits, whom the
Lord filled with hjs aspect, and so inspired the words
which they dictated to the Prophets ; and therefore the
revelation was not by influx but by dictation ; and as
the words came immediately frem the Lord, therefore
they were replete with Divine Truth, and contain an in
ward meaning, so that the same words which Men un
derstand in a natural sense, the angels receive in a celes
tial and spiritual sense ; so hath the Lord joined together
Heaven and this world by the Word. It has also been
shewed to me how Spirits are filled with Divine Truth

from the Lord by aspect : the Spirit that is so filled
knows no other than that he himself is the Lord, and the
Fountain of what he utters, till he has finished his mes
sage, and then he perceives and owns that he is only a
Spirit, and that he spake not from himself, but from the
Lord. From this being the state of the Spirits that spake
with the Prophets, it is said by them, that Jehovah [the
Lord] spake ; and even those very Spirits called them
selves Jehovah as appears both from the prophetical and
historical parts of the Scriptures.
255. That the Reader may be informed as to the man
ner of the union of Angels and Spirits with Man, I find
myself at liberty to declare the following remarkable par
ticulars, for the elucidation ofthat matter. When Angels
and Spirits turn their faces to a man, so as to be in com-
'
munion with him, at such times they know no other than
that they and the Man are of one and the same language,
and this because they are then in his, and not in their
own, of which they have no remembrance ; but as soon
as they turn themselves from him, they immediately en
ter again into their own angelical, spiritual language, and
know nothing of his. The same thing happened to me
when in company with some Angels, at a time when I
was in a similar state with them, for then I conversed
with them in their own language, having no knowledge
or remembrance of mine ; but I was no sooner disengag
ed from their company, than I was in my own again. It
is also worthy of remarking, that when Angels or Spirits
turn their faces to a man, they can converse with him at
any distance; and have spoken with me as audibly when
far off, as when near to me ; but when they turn away
their faces from a man, and converse together by them
selves, the man hears nothing that they say, though they
speak close to his ear ; whence it was evident to me, that
all communion \omnis conjunct io~]
in the Spiritual World,is
according to the direction of the face. It is also a memor
able particular, that several of them con converse with a
Man at the same time, and the Man with them : the man
ner is thus : When they would hold conversation with
any man, they send a Spirit to him from their company,

which elnissary Spirit turns to the Man, and they to
their Spirit, by which means they concentrate their
thoughts, which the emissary delivers, he not knowing
at the time but that he utters them from himself, nor
they that sent him, but that they are the speakers : thus
a communication of many with one is conducted by con
version or direction of the faces. (179) But of. these
emissary Spirits, which are also called 'Subjects, more
shall be spoken hereafter.
256. No Angel or Spirit is allowed to converse with
Man from his own memory, but from that of the Man
only, for Angels and Spirits have memory as well as
men : if an Angel or Spirit were from his own memory
to converse with any man, the latter would in that case,
know no other than that the things mentioned were his
own, though they really were the Spirit's, and conse
quently it would be like the remembrance of what he
never saw nor heard of ; and that this is so, has been
given me to know by experience : hence some of the
ancients were of opiition, that at the expiration of some
thousands of years, they should return to their former
life on earth, and live over again all the particulars of it ;
and that they had aotually so returned ; and this they in
ferred from hence ; viz. That sometimes there occurred
to their minds a recollection of things which they had
never seen nor heard of during their present life : now
this happened to them, because some Spirits had, by in
flux into their minds, excited therein ideas from their
own (the Spirit's) memory.
257. There are also some Spirits, which are called na
tural and corporeal Spirits, which, when they come to a
man, do not join themselves to his thinking part, like
other Spirits, but enter into his body, take possession of
his senses, and speak through his mouth, actuating like-

are called Subjects, n. 4403, 5856. That communications in the Spi
ritual World are conducted by such emissary Spirits, n. 4403, 5856,

they write from celestial skill ; and that it is thus natural

because the progression of their thoughts and
affections, and the whole communication of their under
standing and wisdom,
is

Writing.
I
have been informed, that such also was
•
the manner of Writing by the most ancient inhabitants
of our earth, before the invention of letters; and that
it
was afterwards translated into Hebrew characters, which
were all indexed formerly, and not terminated by Spa
ces,
v
as at present: hence
it
is, that the Word con
tains divine and heavenly secrets, even in its jots, tittles,
and points.

. This manner of writing, in characters of
a
ce
lestial form,
is
used by the angels of the inmost heaven,
who excel the others in wisdom, and by them they ex
press the' very affections from whence their thoughts
originate, and proceed in order, according to the sub
ject treated of, replete with wisdom not to be conceived
by the human mind
:
these WritingsI myself have
seen
:
but this kind of writing
is
not known in the low
er heavens, but others of
a
similar kind, and of like
letters with those that are used by us in this world,
though not intelligible by us, as being the language of
angels, which has nothing in
it
that agrees with human
languages, n. 237
;
for they express affections by the
vowels, and the particular ideas of their thoughts
proceeding from those affections, by the consonants
;
and by the words derived from thence, the whole sense
of the matter
:
see above, n. 236, 241
:
this kind
of writing contains more in
a
few words than any man
can express in some pages
:
these also
I
have been
gratified with
a
sight of. Thus
it
appears, that they
have the written Word in the lower Heavens, as well as
in the highest Heaven, though in the latter, in
a
celes
tial form.

It
is
worthy of remark, that Writing by the an
gels flows naturally from their thoughts, and with the
same ease, as
if
thought cast itself upon the paper

do they experience any hesitation as to the choice of

words, as both the words which they speak and write
correspond to their thoughts ; and all correspondency is
natural and spontaneous. There is also in the Heavens
a kind of writing without the use of the hand, as being
solely from coirespondence with the thoughts; but this
is not permanent.
263. I have also seen writings from Heaven that con
sisted merely of Numbers (Figures,) placed in order and
sequence with the same regularity as letters and words,
and was informed that they were from the inmost Hea
ven ; and that their celestial Scripture, of which see
above, n. 260, 261, presents itself in Numbers by in
flux to the angels of the next Heaven, and also contains a
depth of wisdom not to be fathomed by thought, nor
consequently to be expressed by words ; for all Num
bers are in Correspondency, and according to the Cor-,
respondence respectively, signify things equally with
words, (181) only with this difference, that numbers
express things in the general, and words in their particu
lars ; and as one general includes in it numberless parti
culars, therefore this way of writing in numerals is far
more comprehensive than the literal way of writing :
hence it appeared tevident to ^me, that Numbers in the
Holy Scriptures signify things as much as words. What
is therein signified by the simple numbers, as 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10r 11, 12; and what by the compound
ones, as 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, 144, 1000, 10000,
12000, and many others, may be seen in the Arcana
Ccelestia, in the places where they are mentioned. In
the Scripture beforementioned, the radical number from
which the others proceed in sequence, and on which
they depend as their principal, is prefixed to the follow
ing ones, and is, as it were, the index of the subject
(181) That all numbers in the Word [the Scriptures] signify
things,: n. 482,. 487, 647, 648, 755, 813—9659, 10217, 10253.
This revealed from heaven, n. 4495, 5265. That multiplied num
bers signify the same things (in substance) with the simple numbers
whence they arise in multiplication, n. 5391, 5335, 5708,7973.
That the most ancient of the human race preserved their heavenly
secrets in numbers, in manner like an Ecclesiastical Kalehder (Com-
fiutum £cclesia»ticwn,) n. 575.

treated on, and from which the rest receive their deter
minate signification with regard to the particulars of that
subject.
264. They who know nothing of heavenly things, and
reject every other idea of Heaven than that of its being a
mere atmosphere, in which the angels hover about as in
the air, like so many intellectual minds, or thinking spi
rits, but without any sense of sight or hearing ; such can
have no notion of their being able to speak or write, inas
much as they confine these and numberless other acts to
material substances : whereas the things in Heaven
(though not material) have really as substantial an exis
tence as the natural things of this world ; and the angels
have there all things as means conducive to life, increase
of wisdom and happiness.
CONCERNING THE WISDOM OF THE ANGELS OF
HEAVEN.
265. IT is very difficult to form any moderate concep
tion of the Wisdom of the heavenly angels, as it so far
transcends all human Wisdom, as not to admit of any
comparison with it ; now what exceeds the reach of the
latter must appear as nothing to it : however, it may be
described by some things, which, though at present un
known to us, yet are knowable, if the mind takes de
light therein ; for delight, as proceeding from love, car
ries light with it ; and on such as are affectionately dis
posed to become acquainted with divine and heavenly
Wisdom, light shines from Heaven, and illuminates
their understanding.
266. The greatness of the angelical Wisdom may be
gathered from their being in the light of Heaven : now
the light of Heaven
is,
in its essence, the same with di
vine truth or wisdom
;
and this light enlightens the eyes
of their understanding, as well as gives them external
sight: that the light of heaven

the heat of Heaven, which is in its essence, divine good
or divine love, from which they derive their affectionate
desire of Wisdom ; that the heat of Heaven
is,
in its
essence, divine good or divine love, see above, n. 133
to 140
:
that the angels are so highly advanced in Wis
dom, that they may even be called Wisdoms, may be
gathered from hence, that all their thoughts and affec
tions are congruous to the form and constitution of Hea

dom, and that their interior, which
is
the recipient of
it,
is
according thereto
;
that their thoughts and affections
Bow in such direction, and consequently their understand
ing and Wisdom, see above n. 201 to 212
;
that the
Wisdom of the angels
is
highly eminent, may also ap
pear from this, that their speech or conversation
is
the
language of wisdom, for
it
flows immediately and spon
taneously from their thoughts, as these do from their
affectkms, insomuch tfiat
it
may be said, that their speech
is
thought and affection in an external form
:
hence
it
comes, that nothing interrupts or disturbs the divine
influx into them, nor any of those foreign things or
thoughts which in man so often break in upon and clash
with his communications
;
that the language of angels
is
the language of their thoughts and affections, see n. 234
to 245. To this Wisdom of the angels also conspires
not
a
little, that all which they see with their eyes, and
perceive by their senses,
is
congruous to their Wisdom,
as being correspondences, and accordingly so many re
presentative forms of things appertaining or relating to
W isdom
;
that all things visible in Heaven correspond
to things internal in the angels, and are representatives
of their Wisdom, see above, n. 170 to 182. Moreo
ver, the thoughts of angels are not limited and straitened
by ideas from space and time, as the human thoughts
are
;
for space and time are peculiar to nature, and what
is
peculiar to nature withdraws the mind from spiritual
things, and fetters the understanding
:
that the ideas of
angels have no relation to space and time, and are there
fore less confined than our's, see above, n. 162 4to

210 A treatise concerning
and 191 to 199. The thoughts of angels are neither
drawn down to earthly and material things, nor interrupted
by any cares or necessities of life, and therefore are not
detained from the sweet relish of Wisdom after the man
ner of men ; their food, their raiment, their habitations,
and all things being freely given them of the Lord, n.
181, 190: and they have also many pleasures and de
lights bestowed on them in proportion to their reception
of Wisdom from the Lord. Thus much has been said,
to shew from what causes the angels are so eminent for
their Wisdom. (182)
267. That the Angels are in a capacity of receiving
so high a measure of Wisdom
is,
because their interior
faculties are open, and Wisdom, like every other perfec
tion, has its increase inward, according to the opening of
the interior. (183) There are three degrees of life corre
sponding to the three Heavens in every Angel
;
see n.
29 to 40
:
they in whom the first degree
is
open, are in.
the first or lowest Heaven
;
they in whom the second de
gree
is
open, are in the second or middle Heaven
;
and
they in whom the third degree
is
opened, are in the third
or inmost Heaven
;
and in proportion to these degrees
is
the Wisdom of the Angels in the Heavens
:
hence
it
is
that the Wisdom of the Angels of the third or inmost
Heaven immensely transcends that of the Angels of the
middle Heaven
;
and the Wisdom of these, that of the
Angels of the lowest Heaven; see above, n. 209, 210; and
(182) That the Wisdom of angels
is
both ineffible and incompre
hensible, n. 2795, 2796, -802—9094, 9176.
(183) That as far as man
is
elevated from external to internal
things, so far he enters into light and true understanding, n. 6183,
6313. That this
is
a
real elevation, n. 7816, 10330. That eleva
tion from externals to internals, is, as
it
were, from
a
mist in
to
a
clear day, n. 4598. That what
is
external in man
is
pro-
portiortably remote from what
is
Divine, and by consequence respect
ively obscure, n. 6451

and also respectively inordinate, n. 996,

Divine, n. 5146, 5147. That in the interior are thousands
of particulars, which in the exterior appear only in the light of one

what these degrees are, n. 58. The reason of these differ
ences is because those things which are ofa superior degree
are more particular and distinct ; and those of an inferior
degree, of a general and common predicament, in which
precision and distinction lie concealed; now the former are
to the latter as thousands or myriads to one, and in such

who have their thoughts elevated a*bove matter and
sense ; and still more so with such as have their minds
open to the heavenly Light.
268. We may also form an idea of the exalted Wisdom
of Angels from their mutual communication of all things
without reserve, insomuch, that the understanding and
Wisdom of one is communicated to another ; for Heaven
is a communion of goods of every kind, it being of the
nature of heavenly Love to impart of its own to others,
and accordingly no one there considers any thing he has
as good, unless others partake of it : this principle of Love
constitutes the essential happiness of Heaven, and is de
rived to the Angels from the Lord, whose Divine Love
is infinitely communicative. It has been granted me to
have an experimental knowledge of such communication
in the Heavens from being present with some Spirits of
great simplicity, which, upon their exaltation thither,
were illuminated with Angelical Wisdom, and under
stood and spake things which were inconceivable and in
effable by them before.
269. The Wisdom of the Angels is not to be describ
ed in words, but may in a sort be conceived by some
general instances ; thus, the Angels can express more in
one word than a man can in a thousand ; and moreover,
every word of their's is replete with numberless things,
not to be expressed in haman language, and containing

nereis of Wisdom beyond the reach of our faculties ;
and farther, where words fail to utter the copiousness of
their meaning, the Angels supply that defect in the
sound of them, which expresses the affections therein ;
for, as was said before, n. 236, 241, they express their
affections by sounds, as they do their ideas and thoughts
by words ; whence it is said, that in Heaven are heard
things that cannot be uttered. The Angels also can ex
press in a few words the contents of a whole volume,
and likewise insinuate into every word a power of rais
ing the subject to a more interior sense ; for their lan
guage is so constructed, as to be consonant to the affec
tions, at the same time that the words communicate the
ideas of the speaker ; and what is still more extraordina
ry, their words admit of infinite variations, whereby to
express in exact order and sequence all the combinations
and connection of parts that form the most complicated
subjects. The more interior Angels can discover by the
sound, and certain words of him that speaks, the whole
course of his life, perceiving by the variegations in the
voice, occasioned by the ideas in his mind, what is his
ruling passion, as herein are recorded, as in a register,
all the particulars of his life. (185) Hence we may form
some idea of the superior excellence of the Wisdom of
the Angels, it being respectively to man's Wisdom as a
myriad (ten thousand) to one, and comparatively as all
the moving instruments and powers in the body, which
are innumerable, to the act produced by them, which
appears to our senses ; or like the thousand minute parts
of an object, when examined by a good microscope,

21* A treatise concerning
which, when viewed by the naked eye, appears but as an
atom. To illustrate this by example : A certain Angel,
in describing the work of regeneration from the high
Wisdom he possessed, discovered a hundred secret
things in the chain of his discourse on the subject, eve
ry one of which abounded with still more mysterious
secrets, and so on from the beginning to the end of his
exposition ; shewing how the spiritual man is conceived
anew, passes, as it were, through a kind of gestation, is
born, grows up, and is successively perfected : he also
said, that he could swell the number of mysterious dis
coveries on this subject to some thousands : and that
what he had delivered thereupon concerned the regene-
•ration of the outward Man only ; and that unspeakably
more belonged to the regeneration of the inward Man.
These, and other like things, told me by the Angels,
evinced the sublimity of their Wisdom, and how that
of man may be stiled ignorance, if compared to it : as
he scarcely knows what regeneration means, and sees
not any one step he takes in his progress through it.
270. We shall now speak of the Wisdom of the An
gels of the Third or Inmost Heaven, and how far this
exceeds that of the Angels of the First or Lowest Hea
ven : now the Wisdom of the former is incomprehensi
ble by the latter, and that because the interior faculties
of the former are open in the third or highest degree,
and those of the latter only in the first or lowest degree :
now all Wisdom increases in proportion to its progress
inward, and is perfected according to the opening of the
interior, n. 208, 267 ; and as the interior of the Angels
of the Third Heaven is open in the third degree, there
fore Divine Truths are most intimately written in their
hearts, this degree being more near to the form of Hea
ven than those of the inferior Angels ; and because the
form or constitution of Heaven is from Divine Truth,
and therefore according to divine Wisdom, therefore
Divine Truths appear to the highest Angels as innate or
congenial to them, and therefore as soon as they are pro
posed, they immediately assent to and own them, and
presently after perceive, and, as it were, read them in

themselves. Such being the state of the Angels of the
Inmost Heaven, they have no need to reason concerningv
Divine Truths, much less have they controversies a-
bout any Truth, to know whether it be a Truth or not :
nor do they understand what it is to believe, or have
faith in this or that thing, saying, What is Faith, when
I perceive and know the matter to be so ? Using more
over the following comparisons $ viz. That it would be
as absurd in them to talk of believing, as if any one were
to view a house, and all things in and about
it,
and were
to say to one in company with him, that he must needs
believe that to be
a
house with such and such furniture
:
or as
if
any one saw
a
garden with its trees and fruit, and
were to tell his companion, that he could not but believe
that to be
a
garden with trees and fruit in
it,
whilst at
the same time his own eyes beheld them. Hence
it
is,
that the Angels before- mentioned never name the word
Faith, nor have any idea of
it,
and consequently never
reason nor dispute about the reality of any Divine Truth
:
(186) but the Angels of the First or Lowest Heaven
have not Divine Truth so implanted within them, as
having only their first degree of life open
;
and therefore
they reason concerning them
:
now they who reason on.

Angels of Wisdom enter, and enjoy the variegated de
lights of the whole in their full extent ; but that it is very
different with those that are in reasonings, and more es
pecially if in controversies concerning Truths : for such
persons not seeing them in the light of Truth, but either
receiving them from others, or from the literal sense of
the Scriptures without the spiritual understanding of
them, they cry out, You must believe or have faith,
without allowing any farther demonstration, or mward
manifestation of them : as touching these, they said, that
they come not even up to the gate of the palace of Wis
dom, much less enter in, and walk m its paradisiacal gar
dens ; whilst they who are m the very Truths themselves,
not only do this, but also make free excursions into
Wisdom's wide domains, passing by sight from Truth
to Truth, the extent and connections whereof know no
bounds. They said farther, that the Wisdom of the An
gels of the Third or Inmost Heaven, more especially con
sisted in their beholding divine and celestial things in ev
ery particular object, and stiH more wonderful flings in
an assemblage of many j for all that they see with their
eyes correspond to interior things ; thus, for example,
when they view palaces and gardens, their view does not
terminate in the objects themselves, but extends to the
contemplation of their causes and correspondences, and
that in all the variety represented by the different forms
and appearances of the corresponding visible objects, be
sides innumerable things answering to their order, series
and connexions respectively, which delight even to ex*
tacy their intellectual faculties. That all visible things
in the Heavens correspond to Divine things derived
from the Lord to the Holv Angels, see before, n. 170
to 176.

Heaven and Hell. 2 1 7
27 1 . That the Angels of the Third I leaven are thus con
stituted, is from their being in love to the Lord, and this
love opens the interior faculties of their minds to the third
degree, which renders it the receptacle of all things apper
taining to Wisdom ; and we are moreover to understand,
that the Angels of this Heaven are continually advancing
'
to still higher degrees in Wisdom, and this in a different
manner from the Angels of the Lowest Heaven, as not
committing Divine Truths to their memory, and so
forming them into a science ; but from a clear perception
of them as soon as offered, ingrafting them into their ve
ry life, whereby those Divine Truths, which are their
rule of life, become, as it were, written upon their hearts :
but the case is otherwise with the Angels of the Lowest
Heaven ; for they first commit them to memory, and
then digest them scientifically, calling them forth occa
sionally for their intellectual improvement, but without
any interior perception of their Truth, so that they see
them but obscurely in comparison with the former An
gels ; however, they constantly use them for the direction
of the will, and government of life. It is worthy of being
noticed here, that the Angels qf the Third Heaven ad
vance in Wisdom by hearing, and not by sight ; for what
they hear from preaching enters not into the memory, but
immediately into their perception and will, and so into
the form of their life : but what the other Angels behold
with their eyes', they commit to their memory, and reason
and discourse therefrom; whence it plainly appears, that
their way of encreasing Wisdom is by hearing,. and that
by correspondence, for the ear corresponds to obedience,
and obedience relates to life ; but the eye corresponds to
the intellect, and intellect relates to doctrine. (187) The
state of the Celestial Angels is described in many places
(187) Of the correspondence of the ear and of the hearing, n. 4652.
That the ear corresponds both to perception and obedience, and
therefore signifies them, n. 2542,3869, .,653,5017, 7216, 8361, 9311,
9397, 10065. That it also signifies the reception of Truths, n. 5471,
5475, 9926. Of the correspondence of the eye and its sight, n. 4403
to 4421,4523 to 4534; that therefore the sight of the Eye signifies
the Understanding that conieth of Faith, and also Faith itself, n, 2711,

218 A treatise concerning
of the Scriptures, and particularly by Jeremiah, as foU
lows : "I will put my law in their inward parts, and
" write it in their hearts : and they shall teach no more
"every man his neighbour, and ever}'' man his brother,
" saying, Know the Lord : for they shall all know me,
" from the least of them unto the greatest of them," xxxi.
33, 34. And in Matt. v. 37. " Let your communica-
" tion be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more
" than these, cometh of evil." By cometh of evil, is
meant comparatively and respectively so, as not coming
from the Lord ; for the Truths possessed by the Angels
of the Third Heaven are from the Lord, as proceeding
from love towards him. Love to the Lord in this Hea
ven, is to will and act from Divine Truth, for Divine
Truth is essentially one with the Lord in Heaven.
272. To the reason already given in proof of the angels
being receptive of such exalted Wisdom, this farther one
(which is of primary consideration in Heaven) may be
added, viz. That they are without self love ; for so far
as any one is free from this, in such proportion he is ca
pable of receiving Wisdom in Divine things ; for that
kind of love shuts the inward eye and faculties to the
Lord and heavenly things, whilst it opens those that are
external, and gives them a direction to itself; and there
fore all those over whom this passion gains the dominion,
are in darkness with regard to heavenly things, however
quick sighted they may be in those of this world : and
on the other hand, the Angels, as not being infected with
it,
are
in
the pure Light of Wisdom
;
for the Celestial
Loves with which they are principled, viz. to the Lord,
and to their neighbour, open their hearts to the Divine
Influx, and so the Lord
is
in them. That these two
Loves constitute Heaven as its common, essential prin
ciples, and also form
a
Heaven in every one in particular,
sec above, n. 13 to 19. As these Celestial Loves open
the inward Man to the Lord, so all the Angels turn their
faces towards him, n. 142
;
for in the Spiritual World
it
is
the divine principle of Love that turns the heart of ev
ery one to itself, and whither

therefore
it
joins itself thereto, (for
it
is
the bond of Spi
ritual Union) and communicates of its own to them

and
from this conversion and consequent conjunction and
communication, the Angels derive their Wisdom. That
all conjunction or union (or fellowship) in the Spiritual
World,
is
according to this conversion or turning, may
be seen above, n. 255.
273. The Angels continually advance to higher degrees
of perfection in wisdom
;
(188) and yet attain not in eter

the Divine Wisdom

for this

infinite and their's only
finite, and between finite and infinite there
is
no propor

274. As Wisdom constitutes the perfection of Angels,
and also the very form of their life
;
and as Heaven, with
all the good things therein, communicates with every An
gel in proportion to his wisdom, so all there desire and
hunger after
it,
even as
a
hungry man after his food
;
for
knowledge, understanding, and wisdom, are as truly spi
ritual nourishment, as earthly food
is
natural nourishment,
and they also mutually correspond.
275. The Angels of the same Heaven, though of one
and the same society, differ in degrees of wisdom
:
they
being in the highest who are situated in the centre, and
the rest in lower degrees of
it,
in proportion to their
distance from the centre, decreasing gradually like light

see above, n. 43. 128. They have
also light in the same degree
;
for the Light of Heaven
and Divine Wisdom agree in one, and every one has so
much of the former as he receives of the latter. Concern

it,

220 A treatise concerning
pF THE STATE OF INNOCENCE IN THE ANGELS.
276. FEW in this world have any tolerable notion
concerning Innocence, and they who are in the evil prin- -
ciple, none at all : they see indeed, something that carries
in it the appearance, especially in the faces, language and
actions of little children ; but yet they understand not
the true nature of
it,
much less that
it
is
the receptacle
of Heaven in man
:
that the reader therefore may be the
better instructed in this matter,
I
shall proceed in the
following order to shew, first, what
is
the Innocence of
Little Children
;
then, what
is
the Innocence of Wis
dom
;
and lastly, what
is
the State of Angels with res
pect to Wisdom,
277. The Innocence of Infancy, or of little children,
is
not genujne Innocence, as being only in its exterior
not interior form
;
and yet we may conceive something-
of Innocence by what appears in their looks, in some
of their actions, and their prattle, which affects us the
more, as they have no design nor reflection, know nei
ther good nor evil, nor what
is
true or false, from
whence reflection proceeds
;
and consequently they have
no prudence of their own, no deliberation, purpose, nor
ill intention
:
neither have they as yet attained to any
notion of property from the love of self and the world
;
but look on themselves, as obliged to their parents,
for all that
is
given them, with which they are pleased
and content, not being solicitous about food or raiment, or
what may befal them, neither regarding the world, nor
the things of
it,
but confining their affections to their
parents, nurses and little companions, and shewing a
ductile obedience to their governor
:
such being their
btate, all that they are capable of receiving enters into
the form of their life, and constitutes (without their
knowledge) the whole of their winning behaviour, and
serves for the rudiments of their language, memory, and

thinking, accoiding to the State of Innocence respect
ively : but yet this kind of Innocence, as was said before,
is only external, as belonging to the body, and not
mind, ( 1 89) their minds being not yet formed ; for mind
consists of intellect and will, and as such only becomes
the fountain of reflection and true affection. I have been
taught from Heaven, that little children are in a particu
lar manner under the Lord's care and protection, and
that they are the subjects of an influx from the Inmost
Heaven, which is the State of perfect Innocence, which
influx pervades their interior, and operates in them by
the effects of Innocence, exhibiting appearances of it in
their faces and certain of their actions, thereby exciting
in their parents that natural affection, which we call by
the name of Storge.
278. But the Innocence of Wisdom is the true and
genuine Wisdom, as being internal in the mind, and
consequently in the will and understanding ; and where
Innocence is in these, there also is Wisdom, for they
are Wisdom's dwelling ; and therefore it is a common
saying in Heaven, thit " Innocence dwells in Wisdom ;"
and that every Angel has so much of the latter as he
possesses of the former, and they confirm it by this ar
gument ; viz. Because they who are in Innocence as
sume nothing to themselves, but ascribe all they have to
the goodness of the Lord as his free gift ; that it is their
desire to be led and governed by him, and not by them
selves; that they love every thing that is good, and de
light in all truth, inasmuch as they know and perceive,
that to love Good (that is, to will and do
it)
is
to love
the Lord
;
and to love Truth
is
to love their neighbour
;
that they are content with what they have, be
it
little
(189) That the Innocence of infants
is
not the true Innocence,
but that the true Innocence dwells in Wisdom, n. 1616. 2305,

not Spiritual Good, but becomes so

222 A treatise concerning
o
or much, as knowing that all is given what is needful
for them, little to those that need little, and much to
them that need much, and that they know not what that
fit measure
is,
but the Lord only, who possesses all
things, and provideth all things for all
;
and therefore
they are not solicitous about what shall befal them, call
ing this the " taking thought for the morrow," and being
anxious about what does not belong, to them, nor
is
needful for them. They never deal deceitfully by their
fellows, but uprightly and in sincerity, calling every
other way by the name of subdety which they avoid as
poison, and contrary to all Innocence
:
and as they de
light to be under the tuition and guidance of the Lord,
above all things, ascribing whatever they have to his
free bounty, therefore they are far removed from sel
fishness, and so far enriched with Divine Communica
tions from the Lord. Hence
it
is, that whatever they
hear immediately from himself, or through the means of
the word, or of preaching, they do not lay by in their
memory, but apply
it
to practical use, that is, will
it
and
do
it,
their will serving them instead of memory. The
external aspect of these is, for the most part, that of
great simplicity, though within they are full of wisdom
and prudence, being such as are meant in those words
of our Lord: " Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless
" as doves"; Matt. x. 16. Such
is
the nature of that
Innocence, which
is
called the Innocence of Wisdom.
Now as Innocence takes no merit to itself, but gives the
praise of all good to the Lord only
j
and as
it
delights to
depend upon him for all the goodness and truth which
constitute genuine Wisdom
;
therefore
it
is
so appoint
ed, that man, during the time of his infancy, should
have the external form of innocence, and when old, its
internal form, that so through the former ^he may pass on
to the latter, and in the latter to
a
resemblance of the
former
:
and accordingly
it
comes to pass, that man in
his old age decreases in bulk, and in many particulars
puts on, as
it
were, the child again
;
but this in order
to be as
a
wise child, as an angel
;
for

an eminent sense of the word,
is

is, that in the written Word a child signifies one that is
innocent ; and an old man, one that is wise, in whom
dwelleth innocence. ( 1
90)
279- It happens in like manner to every one that is re
generated, for regeneration is a new birth as to the spi
ritual man : and here he is first brought into that inno
cence of childhood, to be sensible that he cannot attain
to the knowledge of good and truth from himself, but
from the Lord only, and to desire and hunger after them
as his true nourishment ; and these are given to him ac
cording to his growth in the spiritual life : first, he is
given to know them scientifically, then intellectually,
and after this, he is brought into wisdom ; seeing and
confessing all the way, from the Innocence and humility
within him, that his sufficiency herein is only from the
Lord, without which faith and conviction no one is ca
pable of heavenly commmunications, in which chiefly con
sists the Innocence of Wisdom.
280. As it is the property of innocence to chuse the
Lord only for our guide, therefore all in Heaven are
irj
Innocence, as this
is
the choice of all that are there, as
knowing well, that to set up for our own directors,
is
to
abandon ourselves to self-love, and to renounce the
Lord's government over us
:
as far therefore as any angel
is
in Innocence, so far
is
he under the divine leadings
and influence, and so far in Heaven, or, in other words,
so far
is
he principled in goodness and truth, which
constitute the bliss of Heaven
;
and therefore the Hea
vens are distinguished according to the different degrees
of Innocence
:
thus they who are in the lowest or ftrst
Heaven, are in Innocence of the first or lowest degree
;
they who are in the second or middle Heaven, are in
Innocence of the second degree

a
the third or inmost Heaven, are in Innocence of the
third or highest degree, and may be titled the very In
nocences of Heaven, as they are more particularly dis
tinguished for their love of being guided and governed
by the Lord, as little children by the common Father ;
and therefore, whatever divine truth is communicated
to them, either immediately from the Fountain of all
Truth, or by means of the word, or preaching, they
instantly receive it into their will, and so consign it to
life and practical use ; and hence it is, that they so far
excel the angels of the inferior Heavens in wisdom ; see
n. 270, 271. Such being the nature of these angels,
they are next in honour to the Lord, who is the author
of their Innocence ; and they are so far removed from all
propriety, and every thing that borders upon self, that
they may be said to live in him. Their external form
expresses great simplicity, and they appear in the sight
of the inferior angels as little children with little show of
wisdom, whilst they are in reality the wisest of all the
angels, yet knowing at the same time, that they are
only receivers of all they have, and that it is a part of
wisdom to be sensible of
it,
and also that what they do
know
is
nothing in comparison with the things they are
ignorant of: to be thoroughly convinced of this truth,
they call the first step to wisdom. These angels are
without any garment or covering, for nakedness corres
ponds to Innocence, (191)
281.
I
have discoursed much with the angels concern
ing Innocence, and been informed by them, that In
nocence
is
the essence of all good, and that the latter
cannot subsist without
it,
consequently ihat wisdom
is
only so far wisdom, as
it
leads to Innocence
;
and that
the same may be said of divine love, charity towards our
neighbour, and faith
;
(192) from whence
it

that without Innocence no man can he qualified for hea
ven, according to those words of our Lord ;
" Suffer the
" little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,
**
for of such is the kingdom of heaven : Verily I say
**
unto you, that whosoever shall not receive the king-
" dom of Heaven as a little child, shall not enter therein,"
Mark x. 14,, 15. Luke xviii. 16, 17. where, as wejl
as in other parts of the Word, by little children we are
to understand innocent persons. The state of innocence
is also described by our Lord, Matt. vi. 24, &c. but
merely by correspondences. The reason why good is
only so far good as Innocence is in
it,
is
because all
good
is
from the Lord, and Innocence consists
in
a
dis
position to be led and governed by him.
I
was also in
formed, that good and truth can only be mutually con
joined by the medium of Innocence
;
and that therefore
any angel
is
only so far an angel of heaven, as he partakes
of Innocence, for heaven
is
not in any one till truth be
joined to good with him
;
therefore
it
is, that this conjunc
tion of truth and good
is
called the heavenly marriage,
for this constitutes heaven.
I
was also informed, that
true conjugal love derives its nature from Innocence, as
proceeding from the union of good and truth in two
minds, viz. of husband and wife, which union, in its de
scent from above,
is
represented under the form of con
jugal love
;
for where two such persons are joined toge
ther, they necesarily love each other, and in them the
conjugal state may be called
a
display of the delights of
Infancy and Innocence. (193)

'226 A treatise cancemmg
282. As Innocence (*) is the very essence of good in
the angels of heaven, it follows, that divine good pro
ceeding from the Lord must include it in its principle,
for it is that very principle in the angels that disposes
and qualifies them for all the blessedness of heaven. The
case is similar with regard to little children, whose in
terior is not only formed by a transflux of innocence
from the Lord, but also disposed and adapted to receive
the good of celestial love, forasmuch as the good of in
nocence acts from their inmost faculties, and
is,
as was
said before, the essence of every good
:
and as all Inno
cence
is
from the Lord, therefore he
is
called in the
word The Lamb, for lamb signifies Innocence
;
(194)
and as Innocence
is
the essence of celestial good, so
it
affects the minds of others with so much sweetness
and delight, that he who
is
sensible of its influence, (as
happens on the approach of an angel from the inmost
heaven)
is,
as
it
were, ravished from himself, and feels
a
joy which far surpasses any that this world can yield.—-
I
speak this from experience.
283. All who are in the good of Innocence are, in
proportion thereto cordially affected with the same in
others
;
but
it
is
far otherwise with those that are not in
a
similar state
;
and therefore all the Infernals are utter
enemies to Innocence, though they have no idea of what
it
is,
nay, their evil nature
is
so opposite to
it,
that they
burn with
a
desire to injure every innocent person, and
therefore cannot bear with little children, but are seized

mischief: hence it appeared evident to me, that a con
tracted spirit, filled with the love of self, is contrary to
Innocence, as is the case of all in Hell. (*)
CONCERNING THE STATE OF PEACE IN HEA
VEN.
284. HE that has not been in the Peace of Heaven,
can have no true perception of that Peace which the
angels enjoy ; forasmuch as the perceptions of man, dur
ing his close connexion with this mortal body, are in
nature, and hinder such experience; and therefore, in
order to be capable of
it,
he must be brought into such
a
state of elevation above nature, by an abstraction of hi^
spirit from the body, that he may be with the angels
:
now as by this means
I
have been favoured with the pri
vilege of experiencing this heavenly Peace,
I
am quali
fied to give some account of
it
:
not as though human
language were equal to the description, but in such
words as may express
it
comparatively, with that rest or
tranquility (commonly called Peace) of mind, which
is
the common privilege of godly persons.
285. There are two most inward principles in heaven,
viz. Innocence and Peace
;
and they are called most inward
or inmost as proceeding immediately from the Lord.
Innocence
is
that from which springs every good in hea-
(*1 This description of infernal spirits by our Author, as to their
enmity to all innocence and goodness, exhibits likewise a melancho
ly, but too true
a
representation of that malignity, which the human
nature
is
capable of in its greatest degree of depravity and corrup
tion
;
as when men, self-alienated from divine grace, and abandoned
to evil, instead of being the temple of the living God, through the
effectual operation of his Spirit, become the habitation of evil Spirits,
and, as such, haters of their brethren, and despisers of them that
are good
:
so true
it
is, that man even in this life may be as an angel
or
a
devil,- according to the spirit that governs him
;
for his servants
we are whom we obey, and become like unto the master that rule*i
over us. Tr.

i>'28 A treatise concerning
o
ven ; and peace is that which constitutes the delightful
sense or relish (jocundum boni) of such good ; for every
good, has its delightful sensation (suum jucundum :) now
both the good, and its delightful savour or relish, are in
the love property (sunt omoris,) for what we love we call
good, and take delight therein ; and consequently these
two inmost principles of Innocence and Peace proceed
from divine love, and constitute the central joy of angels.
That innocence is the fundamental ground of good, see
the preceeding article ; and that Peace is the ground of
delight, arising from the good of Innocence, will appear
from what follows.
286. And first for the origin of Peace : and this has
its source in the Lord from the union of his Divinity
with his Divine Humanity, and so giving birth to the
Divine Peace in Heaven by his communication with the
Angels, and more particularly by the conjunction of good
with truth in every angel : and as such is the origin of
Peace in Heaven, it must necessarily be a divine prin
ciple communicating blessedness to every good therein,
and be the spring of a joyous life in all the Celestial inha
bitants, it being nothing less than the joy of divine love
flowing from the Lord into every one of them. Such is
that Peace which constitutes the joys and happiness of
the blessed above. (195)
287. From this divine original of Peace, the Lord is
named the Prince of Peace, and speaks of himself as the
author and giver of it : hence likewise the angels are cal
led the Angels of Peace, and heaven the Habitation of
Peace, as in the following places :
" Unto us a child is
" born, unto us a Son is given, and the government
" shall be upon his shoulder ; and his name shall be cal-
(i93) That by Peace, in the highest sense of the word, is meant
the Lord, as being the fountain of Peace, and in the inward sense,
Heaven, as the seat of Peace, n. 3780, 4681. That peace in the
heavens is a divine influx, constituting essentially the blessedness
of every good and truth therein, and that the nature of it is incom
prehensible by man, n. 92, 3780, 5662, 8455, 8665. That di
vine peace is in every good, Wut not in truth void of good, n.
S7^2.

" led Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The
" everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace : Of the in-
*f crease of his government and Peace there shall be no
" end," Isa. ix. 6, 7. Jesus said, " Peace I leave with
" you, my Peace I give unto you : not as the world
'»
giveth, give I unto you," John xiv. 27. " These
" things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might

" the highways lie waste," Isa. xxxiii. 7, 8. " The
n work of righteousness shall be Peace ; and my people
" shall dwell in a peaceable habitation," Isa. xxxii. 17,
18. And that by Peace in the Word we are to under
stand a divine and heavenly Peace, will appear from other
places wherein it is mentioned, as Isa. iii. 7. liv. x. lix.
8. Jer. xvi. 5. xxv. 37. xxix. 11. Hag. xi. 9. Zecha.
xviii. 12". Ps. xxxvii. 37. and elsewhere. Forasmuch as
Peace stands also for the Lord its author, for heaven, for
heavenly joy, and the blessing of every good ; therefore
the usual salutation in old times, from whence we also
derive the custom, was " Peace be with you !" And this
received divine sanction from our Lord, when he sent
out his disciples, saying :
" Into whatsoever house ye
** enter, first say, Peace be to this house ; and if the
" Son of Peace be there, your peace shaU rest upon it,"
Luke x. 5, 6. And likewise when our Lord appeared to
the Apostles, he said, "Peace be unto you," John xx.

Word bv " A sweet savour unto the Lord," as in Exod.

fies the union of the Divinity with the Divine Humanity
in the person of the Lord, and his conjunction with hea
ven and his church, and with all that receive him in both,
accordingly the sabbath was instituted in remembrance
thereof, and had its name from Rest or Peace, being a
holy representative of the church ; and therefore the Lord
called himself Lord of the sabbath, Matt, xii* 8. Mark
ii. 27, 28. Luke vi. 5. (197)
288. As the peace of Heaven is that inward divine
principle which gives blessing to all the good in the An
gels, so it only manifests itself to them perceivable by a
heart-felt joy, when in their happiest frames ; as also by
a sweet relish of the truth which is concordant with their
particular good, when they hear it ; and by an e'xhilerat-
ing delight on the union of both, diffusing a joyous influ
ence in all they do, and all they think, and manifesting
itself in all their looks. However, this Peace, as to its
specific quality and degree, differs in the different hea
vens, according to the innocence of their inhabitance re
spectively; for Innocence and Peace, as was said before,
go hand in hand with one accord, Innocence being thfe
source of heavenly good, and Peace the delightful sensa
tion of that good [jucundum illius boni
;~\
so that nearly
the same that was said in the preceding article, of the
state of Innocence in heaven, may be said of Peace in
this, as they are conjoined in like manner with good, and
its pleasant fruit, for good
is
known by the delight it
yields, and the particular delight distinguishes the kind
of its proper good, and
is
owned by it. Hence
it
appears
that the angels of the inmost or third heaven are in the

inmost [highest] degree of Innocence; and that the an
gels of the inferior heavens are in a lower degree of
Peace, as being in a lower degree of Innocence ; see
above, n. 280. That Innocence and Peace go together,
like good, and the pleasing sensation of
it,
may be known
by little children, .which are in Peace, because in Inno
cence
;
and because in Peace, there all things serve to
them as matter of play and harmless delight
:
however,
the Peace of infants
is
only external, for internal Peace,
like internal Innocence,
is
only to be found in wisdom,
and consequently where good and truth are conjoined,
for hence comes wisdom. There
is
also an heavenly or
angelical Peace in such men as are possessed of wisdom
from
a
conjunction of good with truth, and thereby find
themselves resigned to the will of God
;
but this Peace,
during their abode here, lies concealed in their inner Man,
but
is
manifested when they quit the body, and enter
in
to their heavenly rest, for then the things that were hid
den will be revealed.
289. As Divine Peace originates from the conjunction
of the Lord with Heaven, and particularly
in
every An
gel, from the conjunction of Good and Truth, therefore
the Angels, when in their highest State of Love, are in
their most perfect State of Peace, for then Good and
Truth are
in
their most perfect conjunction with them.
(*) That alternate changes of States take place in the
Angels, see above, n. 154 to 160. Similar to this
is
the
regeneration of Man, when the conjunction of Good and
Truth
is
formed within him
;
which more especially
is

* The reader for the better understanding of our Author's mean
ing, is to take with him all along, that as the two chief constituent
principles of man's spiritual nature are the will, and the understand
ing or intellect, so the divine good of love
is
the perfection of the for
mer, and the divine light of truth that of the latter
;
and that when
these two principles or faculties in man arc thus dignified and exalt
ed, he
is
then in his most perfect state, as having the highest good
and truth conjoined or united in him
:
hence proceeds, derivatively
from the ^ord, the relative perfection both of men and angels. Tr.

232 A treatise concerning
fill State of heavenly Peace. (198) This Peace may be
compared to a lovely morning in the spring season, when
Nature appears revived, as well as beautified, by the
warmth and splendor of the newly risen Sun, whilst grate
ful odours, exhaling from the vegetable world, mix their
rich sweets with the descending dew of Heaven, and at
the same time that they add fertility to the earth, regale
the senses and exhilerate the minds of men : and this
comparison must appear the more apt, as the morning
redness in the spring time corresponds to the State of
Peace in the heavenly Angels; see n. 155. (199)
290. I have also conversed with Angels on this sub
ject of Peace, and told them that the men of our world
call that Peace, when wars and hostilities cease between
nations, and enmity and discord between neighbours ;
and have no other notion of internal Peace, than of that
which consists in a freedom of anxious cares about things
future, and especially in a pleasing tranquillity of mind
arising from the success of their temporal affairs : to
which the Angels replied, that however such ease and
tranquillity might, in their opinion, carry in them the
appearance of Peace, yet they had nothing of the true
nature of
it,
except with those who were in the principle
of Celestial Good, as in that Good only the true Peace
was to be found, seeing that
it
was
a
pure influence em
anating from the Lord into their inmost or superior facul
ties, and thence descending into their interior ones, and
so producing true rest and tranquillity of mind, and the
joy that proceeded thence
:
but as to those who are in
the evil principle, they know not what Peace
is
;
(200)
for as to that apparent tranquillity and pleasure which
ihey have, when things go according to their wishes,

It all external and superficial only, whilst enmity, hatred,
revenue and wrath, with other evil passions, remain un-
mortified within, and are ready to break out on the first
provocation or incitement, when unrestaitied by fear ; and

OF THE CONJUNCTION OF HEAVEN WITH MAN.
291. IT is a received doctrine in the Church, that all
Good is from God, and none originally from Man, and
that therefore no one ought to assume any merit to him
self on that account ; and it is equally confessed, that
Evil is from the Devil ; and accordingly it is common
for those who speak from doctrine to say of such as live
well, preach the Truth, and are of a godly conversation,
that they have God for their Guide, and the contrary of
such as are of bad life and conversation ; but this could
not be so, were there no communication between Hea
ven and Hell and Man, and that with their wills and in-
tellects, as from these the body is actuated, and the
mouth speaks. What kind of communication or conjunc
tion this is, shall now be shewed.
29'2. There are good Spirits and evil Spirits present
with every Man ; by the former he has communication,
with Heaven, by the latter with Hell ; now both these
kinds of Spirits belong to that intermediate State, or
World of Spirits, which is betwixt Heaven and Hell, of
which we shall particularly treat hereafter. When these
Spirits come to any man, they enter into the whole of
his memory, and the whole of his thinking ; the evil Spi
rits into all the evil that is in his memory and thoughts,
and the good Spirits into all the good therein : now these
Spirits know nothing of their being in the person, but

mory and thoughts are their own ; neither do they see
him, for the things in our solar world are not objects of
their sight. (201) The Lord has in a particular manner
provided, that the Spirits should not know that thty are
present with the person, for were they to know this, they
would converse with him, and so the evil Spirits would
have power to destroy him; for as they are conjoined
with Hell, they covet nothing more earnestly than his
destruction, not only as to his Soul, or which is the same,
his Faith and Love, but also as to his body: but it is
far otherwise when they converse not with him, for in
that case they know not that they think his thoughts, nor
communicate them to their fellow Spirits, for they con
verse together from Man, as it were by proxy, whilst at
the same time they believe that they think and speak from
themselves ; now, as it is natural for every one to esteem
and love himself, so these Spirits are allured to esteem
and love the Man [for their own sakes,] without know
ing that they do so. That Spirits are thus conjoined with
Man, I can and do certify from many year's full expe
rience.
293. That Spirits which communicate with Hell are
also joined to Man, is because that Man is born into all
kinds of evil, which are, as it were, the elements of his
natural life; and therefore, unless Spirits similar to him
self were joined to him, he could not live, nor conse
quently be reformed and regenerated ; so that he is con
tinued in life by means of his communication with evil
Spirits, and attracted to good by thr good Spirits, and so
stands in a kind of equilibrium between both, and in this
equilibrium consists his liberty or free will, whereby he i9

could he be thus free, did he not stand in the exact me-
dium between the equal influence of evil Spirits on the one
hand, and the counter influence of good Spirits from Hea
ven on the other. (*) It has likewise been made known
to me, that if Man, as now born and constituted in his
present fallen state, had not the power of being in the evil
that he chu6es, and was destitute of free will, he could
not continue in life ; as also that he cannot be compelled
to good, forasmuch as what he does by constraint makes
no part of his proper life, nor continues with him ; but
that the good which he receives freely, takes root in his
will, and so becomes, as it were, his own property : and
hence it
is,
that man may have communication with Hell,
and also with Heaven.
294. What kind of communication subsists betwixt
Heaven and good Spirits, and what betwixt Hell and evil
Spirits, and consequently what kind of Conjunction
is
formed thereby respectively, shall here be mentioned. All
* It must be owned, that the discoveries held forth to us in this
article or section, are no less wonderful than important, as explain-
ing man's relation to good and evil spirits
:
his communication with
heaven or hell through them
;
and the origin of free will. Surely,
I
think that human reason or invention could never have hit on these
discoveries, nor that cool, unbiassed reason can easily reject them
when offered, especially as they so well consent with what-
is
record
ed in the sacred writings concerning the agency and influence of Spi
rits on the human intellect and will
:
nor
is
it
any new point of belief
in the church, that the influence and operations of the Holy Spirit on
the hearts and minds of pious Christians are conducted by the instru
mentality of the good angels, who are stiled w
ministering spirits
sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation." And
by like authority we may conclude, that Satan advances the dominion
of sin, and " worketh in the hearts of the children of disobedience,"
by the ministry of his evil angels. And as the Holy Angels are repre*
sented in scripture as ministering in spiritual things from God to
man, so are they likewise there represented as the mediums or con
veyancers through which spiritual sacrifices ascend from man to
God
;

A treatise concerning
Spirits in the World of Spirits have communication with
Heaven or Hell, the good with the former, the evil with
the latter ; and both Heaven and Hell are distinguished
into separate Societies, to one of which every particular
Angel belongs : and as he subsists by influx from
it,
so
he co-operates in all things with
it
:
hence
it
is,
that ac
cordingly as
a
man
is
joined to Spirits good or bad, so
is
he joined to Heaven or Hell, and also to that particular
Society in either, which he. resembles most in his affec
tions or prevailing love
;
for all the heavenly Societies are
classed -according' to their affections of good and truth
;
and all the infernal Societies according to their affections
of evil and false. Concerning the Societies of Heaven, see
above, n. 41 to 45, as also n. 148 to 151.
295. As Man
is
with regard to his affections or love, ac
cordingly similar Spirits are joined to him, the good Spi
rits by appointment from the Lord; but the evil Spirits
arc attracted to him by Man's own self
:
however, the
Spirits that are for his companions, are changed according
as his affections vary
;
thus one sort attends him in his in
fancy, another in childhood,
a
third sort in youth and man
hood, and another in old age
:
in infancy he
is
attended
by such Spirits as are more particularly distinguished for
their innocence, and as such, communicate with the In
most or Third Heaven
;
in early youth by those who are
in the affection of knowledge, or such as communicate
with the Lowest or First Heaven
;
in riper age by those
who are
in
the affection of Truth and Good, and so on to
intellectual attainments, and as such communicate with
the Second or middle Heaven
;
and in old age they have
for their associated Spirits such as excel in wisdom and
innocence, and have communication with the. Inmost or
Third Heaven
:
but this association or adjunction
is
ef
fected by the Lord in those who.are in
a
capacity of be
ing reformed and regenerated, and not in any else,
it
be
ing otherwise with such
;
for though persons, who are in
no such capacity, have good Spirits attending them to keep
them from evil, as. far as
it
is
possible,to be done, yet their
close connection [conjunction

with evil Spirits that com

associates of like disposition with themselves : thus, if
they are addicted to self-love, given to filthy lucre, re
vengeful, or adulterers; in this case similar Spirits be
come present to them, and unite with their evil affec
tions; and where such a one cannot be kept from evil
by the good Spirits, they inflame his evil passions, and
enter in and dwell with him. In this manner bad Men
are joined to Hell, and good Men to Heaven.
296. That Man is thus under the government of Spi
rits by divine appointment, is because he is not consti-
ted, in his present state, according to the laws and order
of Heaven ; but subject by the depravity of his nature,
to the evils which originate from Heil, and as such, con
trary to the order of Heaven, to which he must be re-
stored, which can only be by the ministry of Spirits,
whereas the matter would be otherwise were Man born
perfect according to the order of Heaven : for in such
case he would not have been under the mediate govern
ment of -Spirits, but under that of Divine instinct, and
subject to the general laws of influx ; and by influx Man
is now governed as to those things which proceed from
his thoughts and will into act : as for example, his words
and actions; for these flow spontaneously, according to
the established laws of order in this natural world, with
which the Spirits that are joined to him have nothing in
common. The inferior animals also are governed by a
general instinct, or influx from the Spiritual world, for
they are in the appointed order of their nature, which
they could not corrupt or destroy, as being without ra
tionality. (202) As to the difference between Men and
them, see above, n. 39.
(202) That the difference between the human anil the bestial na
ture consists in the capacity of the former to be exalted to a partici
pation of the Divine : that men are qualified by grace to think of
God, to love him, and to be joined to the Lord, and consequently to
become heirs of eternal life, of which the brute beasts are in no wise
capable, n. 4525, 6323, 9231. That the brutes come into the world in
the appointed order of their nature, and therefore in a condition every
way suitable thereto; but that it is otherwise with Man, who is to be
introduced again into the primitive order and condition of his nature
by instruction, and the improvement of his intellectual faculties.

238 A treatise Concerning
297. With respect to the Conjunction of Heaven with
Man, we are moreover to know, that the Lord acts upon
him according to the established law of order, both in-
wardly and outwardly, and disposes him to receive the
heavenly influence, and so both parts of his constitution,
'viz. the outward and inner man, may mutually co-o[>erate
in one uniform obedience to his government. This influx
from the Lord is called Immediate, and the former by
Angels, which depends on this, is called Mediate Influx ;
immediate influx is from the Lord's Divine Humanity in
to the will of Man, and through the will into the under-
standing ; or, in other words, into his good, and through
the good into his truth ; or, which amounts to the same,
into his love, and through the love into his faith, but not
alternately, or vice versa, much less into a faith without
love ; or into a truth without good ; or not into under
standing not influenced by the will. This immediate kind
of divine influx never ceases, and is received in the good
principle by the good, but not by the evil, for these reject,
stifle, or pervert it ; and therefore they continue in that
kind of evil life, which in a spiritual sense is called Death.

they be such as communicate with Heaven or with Hell,

never operate on him by influx from their memory and
thoughts; for in that case he Would be led to mistake
their memory and thought for his own, see above n. 256 :
but the influence which he receives from Heaven through
them is affection principled with the love of good and
truth, and that which he receives from Hell through them
is affection principled with the love of what is evil and
false : and as the man's affection is concordant with the
influx, so far he receives it into his mind and thoughts,
for Man's inward thoughts keep pace with his affection
or love ; but in proportion to their disagreement the in
flux is rejected. Hence it appears, that a Man receives
not his thoughts through the Spirits but only the affec
tion of good, or of evil, that he is endowed with elec
tion, or is free to receive good or evil, concerning which
he is instructed in the written Word ; now which of
these he receives into his mind with affection and desire,
that becomes his own, or a principle witliin him ; but
what he does not so receive, that makes no part of him
self, or is not appropriated to him. Thus much may
suffice to shew the nature of influx of good from Heaven,
and of evil from Hell in Man.
299. It has also been given me to know whence anxu
ety, grief, and that sadness of mind, which we call
melancholy in Man, proceed : there are certain Spirits,
that are not yet joined to Hell, as being newly departed
from the body, (of which hereafter, when we come to
treat of the World of Spirits) which take delight in
things indigested and putrid, suoh as meats corrupted in
the stomach, and hold their confabulations in such sinks
of uncleanness in man, as suitable to their impure affec
tions ; now if these their affections are contrary to those
in Man, they become in him the occasion of sadness and
melancholy ; but on the contrary, if they correspond to
his own affections, he is pleased and delighted therewith.
These Spirits appear near to the stomach, some to the
right, some to the left of
it,
some higher, some lower,
some nearer, some more distant, according to their dif
ferent kinds of affection
:
and that they cause uneasi
ness of mind,

I have seen and heard them, and felt the uneasiness
caused by them, and I have also conversed with them :
upon their removal, the uneasiness has ceased, and re
turned upon their return ; and I have also been sensible
of its increase and decrease, according to the degrees of
their approach or removal respectively : and hence I
have learnt whence it comes, that they who have no
notion of conscience, from not having any themselves,
ascribe the anguish of it to disorders in the stomach or

300. The communication (conjunctio) of Heaven with
Man, is with the interior of his mind, that is, with his
spiritual or inner Man, and with his natural or external
Man by Correspondences, of which more particularly in
the following article, wherein we shall treat of the Con-
j unction of Heaven with Man through the Word.
301. That the Conjunction of Heaven with Man is of
such a nature, that they have a mutual dependence on
each other, shall be spoken to in the following article.
302 I have conversed with the Angels on this subject,
and told them, that such as are members of the Church
on earth do indeed doctrinally hold, that all- good is
from God, and that Angels are present with men ; but
that few inwardly and truly believe that they are joined
to them, much less in their thoughts and affections. To
which the Angels replied, that they knew there was
such a contradiction betwixt profession and actual belief
among men in this matter, and especially in the Church,
(204) That they who are without conscience themselves, have no
notion of what conscience is, n. 7490, 9121. That there are some,
who, when they hear mention made of conscience, turn it into ridi
cule, n. 7217. That some believe there is no such thing; others,
that it is nothing more than some natural melancholy or disorder, oc
casioned by bodily indisposition, or disappointment in worldly mat
ters ; and some, that it is only superstition in vulgar minds, n. 950.
That there is a true conscience, a spurious conscience, and a false
conscience, h. 1033, That remorse of conscience is an uneasinesss
of mind for something unjust, deceitful, or evil, that a man has
done, which he considers as contrary to his duty to God or his neigh

which they wondered at the more in those who were in
possession of the Ho!y Scripture, which instructed them
in the things of Heaven, and Man's communication
therewith, especially asJiis power of thinking, and the
whole of his spiritual life, depended on such Communi
cation and Conjunction with Spirits : moreover they said,
that the cause of this ignorance in man was his belief,
that he lived wholly from himself, without any connec
tion with the Author and Fountain of Life ; and that
his connection was through the medium of the Heavens,
and that were this broken or interrupted, Man would
instantly die. Did Man firmly believe, as is the very
truth, that all good is only from the Lord, and all evil
from Hell, in that ease he would not assume any merit
to himself on account of the former, nor would the lat
ter be imputed to him ; but in all the good he thinks
or does, he would look up to, and ascribe the praisp
of it to the Lord ; and ail the evil wherewith he is tempt
ed, he would give back to Hell from whence it came ;
whereas by disbelieving all influx, either from Heaven
or Hell, and by supposing that all he thinks and wills is
in and of himself alone, he appropriates to himself tha
evil, and corrupts the good by a vain conceit of self-
righteousness. „

OF THE CONJUNCTION OF HEAVEN WITH MAN
BY THE WORD.
303. ALL who reason from any depth of thinking
know well, that there is a connection between all things
and their first cause through intermediate causes, and
that whateyer is not so connected must immediately
cease to be, as nothing can subsist from itself but from
something prior to itself, and all things from that which
is original or first ; and that this connection, with what
is prior to itself, is an effect from its efficient cause, which

cause being removed, the effect necessarily ceases, Hence
it is become a maxim among the learned, that subsistence
is no other than a continuation ofexistence ; and that there
fore all things subsist from that First Cause to which they
owe their existence : but as to the particular connection
of every tiling with its prior cause, and so back to the
first cause or origin of all things, this is so multifarious,
as not easily to be described ; and therefore let it suffice
to observe in general, that there is such a connection be
twixt the spiritual and natural worlds, that all things in
the latter correspond to those in the former, concerning
which Correspondence,see n. 103 to 115; as also that
there is a connection, and consequently a Correspondence
between all things in Man, and all things in Heaven, of
which see above, n. 87 to 102.
304. Man is so formed by his nature, as to be capable of
Connection and Conjunction with the Lord, but only con
sociation with the Angels of Heaven ; and why not Con
junction, is because he is by creation similar to an Angel
with respect to his inward man, having a like will and a
like understanding, and therefore after death, if his life had
been according to the divine order and laws, he becomes
an Angel, and oflike wisdom with the Angels ; and there
fore by Man's Conjunction with Heaven is meant his Con
junction with the Lord, and his conosciation with the
Angels ; for Heaven is not constituted from any thing
proper or peculiar to the Angels, but from the Divinity
of the Lord; and that this is so, see above, n. 7 to 22.
But Man has, moreover, this privilege above the Angels,
that he not only belongs to the spiritual world with res
pect to his interior part, but is also an inhabitant of this
natural world in respect to his exterior or outward man.
Now to this latter part of his composition appertain all
things belonging to his natural or external memory, toge
ther with his thoughts and imaginations from thence, as in
general is his knowledge of such arts and sciences, and
the natural delights these yield him ; as likewise his natu
ral senses, speech, and actions, which constitute the low
est part of his nature, and arc the ultimate things in which
the divine influx terminates ; for it passes through what

is intermediate in man to the most inferior parts of his
composition : whence it will appear, that in man is the
last and lowest display of the divine influx and order,
and, as it were, the basis and foundation of it. Now, as
such is the transit of divine influx through its medium
{the angelical Heaven) to its ultimatum or termination in
Man; and as nothing is unconnected or independent,
so the Conjunction of Heaven and mankind forms so
close and necessary a relation between them, that neither
can subsist without the other ; insomuch that Men with
out Heaven would be as a chain without a fastening (cate.
na ablato unco,) and Heaven without mankind, as a house
without a foundation. (2Q5)
305. But forasmuch as man has broken his connection
with Heaven, by that which has estranged his affections
from heavenly things, and tnrned them to self and the
world by the love thereof, and so withdrawn himself
from good, that he was no longer in a capacity to serve
for a basis and foundation to Heaven ; therefore the Lord
has graciously provided a substitute in the room thereof
by the medium of the Word, for his Conjunction with
Heaven ; and how this serves for such a medium has
been shewed in many places of the work intitled, Arcana
Calestia, or Heavenly Secrets, which are to be found
collected together in a little treatise on the White Horse,
spoken of in the Apocalypse ; as also in the Appendix
(205) That nothing exists from itself, but from a prior cause,
and all things from a First Cause : that they owe their subsistence
to that from which they derive their existence, as subsistence is a
continuation of existence, n. 2886, 2888, 3627 —6056. That Di
vine Order terminates not short of Man, but in Man as its ultima
tum, n. 634, 2853, 3632 — 10329, 10335, 10548. That internal

30&. I have been informed, that the most ancient
Church on earth had immediate revelations, as their
minds and affections were turned towards Heaven, and
therefore, that then there was a conjunction of the Lord
with men ; but that after that time there was no such,
immediate revelation, but a mediate one by Correspond-

ences, and that their divine worship consisted in these ;
whence the Churches in those days were called Repre
sentative Churches, for they then understood the na
ture of Correspondences and Representations, and that
all things on earth correspond to spiritual things in Hea
ven and in the Church, or, which signifies the same,
represented them ; wherefore those natural things, in
which their outward worship consisted, served them as
means to their thinking spiritually, and so with the An

sentations was lost, then the Word was committed to
writing, all the words and senses of which are according
to the rules of Correspondency, and so containing that
spiritual or inward sense in which the Angels understand
them ; for when a Man reads the Word, and understands
it in its literal or external meaning, the Angels receive
it according to its internal or spiritual sense ; for the
Angels think spiritually, as men think naturally ; and
though these two ways of thinking appear widely differ
ent, yet they come to the same by Correspondency.
Thus it came to pass, that after Man had broken off his
connection with Heaven, the Lord substituted the Word
as a medium, whereby to restore that connection.
307. In what manner Heaven is joined with Man by
the word, shall here be illustrated by some passages
taken from it. The New Jerusalem is described in the
Apocalypse as follows: "I saw a New Heaven and a
" New Earth ; for the first Heaven and first earth were
" passed away : and I saw the Holy City, the New Je-
" rusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven :
" and the City lieth four-square, and the length is as

large as the breadth : and the Angel measured the
" City with the reed twelve thousand furlongs : the
" length, and the breadth, and the height of it is equal :
"and he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and
" forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a
"Man, that
is,
of an Angel: and the building of
it

and be succeeded by
a
new heaven and earth, and that
on the latter shall descend the Holy City Jerusalem, of
the above given dimensions: but the Angels take

the New Heaven and the New Earth they understand
the New church, and by the City Jerusalem coming down
from God out of Heaven, its heavenly doctrine as reveal,
ed by the Lord ; by the length, breadth, and height thereof
as equal, and by twelve thousand furlongs, they understand
every good and truth contained in that doctrine in their
complex or total : by the wall thereof they understand
the truths which guard and defend that doctrine, and
by the measure of the wall, viz. one hundred and forty-
four cubits, which is the measure of a man, i. e. of an
Angel, all its auxiliar truths in their complex, and their
several kinds ; by its twelve gates of pearls, they un
derstand initiatory or introductory truths, such being
meant thereby ; and the foundations of the wall of the
City, as garnished with all manner of precious stones,
the knowledges (cognitiones) upon which its doctrine
is founded : and by pure gold like unto transparent
glass, of which the City and its streets consisted, they
understand the good of love, from which the heavenly
doctrine of the New Church originates, together with
all its clear, convincing truths. Such are the perceptions
of the Angels as touching these things, and so different
from those of men ; and in this manner the natural ideas
of men are converted and changed into spiritual ideas in
the minds of the Angels, without the latter knowing any
thing of the literal sense of the Word, as of a New
Heaven and Earth, of a New City called Jerusalem, of
a wall and its foundations, and of measures : however,
the thoughts of the Angels coincides with the thoughts
of Men by Correspondency, and meet together like the
words of the speaker, and the sense of those words in the
mind of the hearer, who attends not to the sound, but to
the sense of the words. From what has been said, it
may appear how heaven is joined with Man through the
medium of the Word. But to; illustrate the matter by
another example from the written Word :
" In that day
" shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria ; and

" Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst
'* ofthe land, whom the Ltord of Hosts shall bless, saying ;
** Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of
" my hands, and Israel mine inheritance," Isa. xix. 23,
24, 25. The difference in thinking and understanding
between Angels and Men, on reading the above passage,
will appear by giving both the literal and the spiritual
sense of it. Now, according to the former, Men under
stand, as meant thereby, that the Egyptians and Assyri
ans are to be converted, and find acceptance with God,
and to make one church in conjunction with the people of
Israel : but the Angels interpret it spiritually, of the man
of the spiritual church, who is there meant, according to
the inward sense ; and whose spiritual part is signified by
Israel, his natural part by the Egyptians, and his rational
part (which is the medium between the two former) by
the Assyrian :
(207) and yet both these senses meet in
one by Correspondence ; and therefore, at the same time
that the Angels think and understand in a spiritual,
and Men in a natural manner, they are conjoined like bo-
dy and soul, the internal sense of the Word being, as it
were, the soul, and the literal sense its body. Such is
the Word throughout, and consequently a fit medium of
Conjunction between Heaven and Man, to which the li
teral sense serves for the basis or foundation.
308. There is also a Conjunction of Heaven, through
the Word, with those that are without the Church, and
have not the Word ; for the Church of the Lord is ca
tholic or universal, consisting of all who believe in a
God, and live in charity one with another, for such after

248 A treatise concerning
proper place, when we come to treat of the Heathens*
The universal Church in the sight of the Lord is as one
Man, as was said before of Heaven, n. 59 to 72 : but
the Church were the Word is, and wherby the Lord is
known, is as the heart and lungs in that Man. It is well
known that all the viscera and members of the body de
rive life from the heart and lungs through various channels
and conveyances ; so that part of mankind which is with
out the Church where the Word
is,
yet derive virtue from
it,
as members of the same body
:
the conjunction of Hea
ven, through the Word, with those that are at
a
distance
from the Church, and therefore have
it
not, may also'be
compared to light propagated from its center to the cir
cumference
;
now in the Word
is
Divine Light, and
therein the Lord
is
present, and diffuses light,
in
a
mea
sure from thence to all that are afar off, which would not
be so but for the Word. This may be farther elucidat
ed by what has been said before concerning the form of
Heaven, according to which the consociations and com
munications therein are regulated
:
but this
is
among
those secrets of wisdom, which are to be understood by
spiritual minds only
;
for as to those who are possessed
of natural light,
it
will be too hard for them, as the for
mer discover innumerable things, which the latter see
not, or see but very obscurely.
309. Unless such
a
Divine Word had been dispensed
to the inhabitants of this world, they would have been
separated from Heaven, and in that case would have ceas
ed tobe rational creatures
;
for the rationality of our na
ture proceeds from the influx of heavenly Light
;
besides,
men here are so constituted, as not to be capable of im
mediate revelation, and so to be instructed in Divine
Truths, like the inhabitants of other worlds, (of whom
I
have treated in
a
distinct small piece) as being more
word,the Church ofthe Lord consists of all throughout the wholeworld,
who lead
a
good life according to that religion which they profess, n.

believe in God, are accepted of the Lord, n. 2589 to 2604, 3861, 286S,
3263, 4190, 4197, 6700, 9256: and also all infants vheresBevcr

outward, whereas they are the inward and spiritual only,
who are receptive of such revelation ; for if they who are

it,

:
and that such
is
the nature of men at this day on earth,
is
evident from
many within the church, who, although they have been
instructed from the Word concerning Heaven and Hell,
and
a
life after this* yet remain unbelievers
in
their hearts;
among whom are some who have shewed an ambition
of being thought more learned than their neighbours, and
consequently from whom might have been expected
greater proofs of wisdom than from many others.
310.
I
have sometimes discoursed with the Angels
concerning the Word, and told them, that some held
it
in contempt on account of the simplicity of its stile
;
and
that as its internal sense was no longer understood,
therefore few believed that
it
contained such
a
rich trear
sure of wisdom
:
to which the Angels replied, That
though the stile of the Word in the sense of the letter ap
peared so simple, yet nothing was comparable to
it
for
excellence, as
it
contained Divine Wisd >m, not only in
every sense, but
in
every word, and that the illuminaton
therefrom, was manifest in Heaven, meaning thereby
that
it
was the Light of Heaven, as being Divine Truth;
for Divine Truth has
a
visible splendor in Heaven
;
see
above, n. 132. Moreover they said, that without such
a
Divine Word, men on earth would have no Divine
Light, nor any conjunction with Heaven; for in propor
tion to the former
is
the latter, and also everv one's mea-
sure of revealed Truth
:
that Man's ignorance as to such
conjunction through the spiritual sense of the Word, in
correspondence with its natural sense,
is
the cause of his
ignorance likewise as touching the spiritual perception and.
language of the Angels, and the difference between
their's and those of us poor mortals
jn
this our natural
state
;
without understanding something of which, he
can form no judgment concerning the spiritual sense of
the Word, and how thereby man may be conjoined with
Heaven. They moreover said, that

man believed.

250 A treatise concerning
that such an inward and spiritual sense belonged to the
Word, and in some sort framed his mind according
thereto on reading
it,
he would advance in Wisdom's
school, and to
a
nearer conjunction with Heaven, through
a
greater conformitwjfo the Angels in spiritual concep
tions.
THAT HEAVEN AND HELL ARE FROM MAN
KIND.
311. THAT Heaven and Hell are from Mankind,
is
a
doctrine intirely unknown in the Christian world,
it
being
therein believed by all, that the Angels were first created
such, and so Heaven became their dwelling
;
and that the
Devil or Satan was an Angel of Light, but on revolting
from his obedience was cast down from Heaven, together
with his rebellious' crew, and that so Hell came from them.
That such
a
belief should prevail among Christians
is
matter of astonishment to the Angels, and a still greater,
that they should be under
a
total ignorance as to Heaven,
though
it
ought to be so fundamental
a
doctrine in the
Church
:
as men have been so long in darkness touching
these important points, the Angels expressed great joy
that the Lord was pleased now at last to vouchsafe to them
farther discoveries concerning Heaven and Hell, in order,
as far as possible, to dispel that darkness which has con
tinued to increase upon them, and that the rather, as the
Church [with respect to its preseut dispensation
J
has
now entered upon its last period, and
is
near to the end of
it
:
therefore
it
is
their desire that
I
would declare upon
assurance from them, that there
is
not
a
single Angel in
the universal Heaven that was created such at first, nor a
single Devil in all Hell that had been an Angel of Light,
and afterwards cast out from Heaven
;
but that all, both in
Heaven and
in
Hell, are of the human race
;
in the former,
such as had lived in the world in heavenly love and faith,
and in the latter, such as had lived in hellish affections and
dispositions; and that the whole of Hell taken collective-

well that Hell which is behind, (*) in which are the evil
genii called the Devil, as that Hell which appears in front,
in which are the evil spirits called Satan ; (209) of which
shall be spoken more distinctly hereafter. They moreover
said, that the erroneous belief of the Christian world on
these subjects proceeded from certain passages in the
Word taken according to their literal sense, and not illus
trated by the light of genuine doctrine, as delivered in the
same Word ; and that the letter of Scripture, if not un
derstood and explained by the rule of the latter, often mis
leads the mind into mistakes and erroneous opinions, from
which have arisen heresies in the church. (210)
312. The forementioned error in Christian men has
given occasion to that other in believing, that no one
goes to heaven or hell before the time of the last judg
ment, when they suppose that the present visible frame of
things shall perish, and be succeeded by a new creation,
and that our souls shall then be re-united to our bodies,
and so we shall live again as men ; and this belief is con
nected with that of the angels having been created angels
from the beginning, as it cannot be thought that heaven
and hell are inhabited by the human race, if none of them

me, and also of conversing with some that are in hell, and

mnrnii gtili evening, and o to receive information concern
ing both kingdoms ; and this to the end that Christian
men may no longer continue in their mistaken notions
concerning the resurrection at the final judgment, the state
of souls in the mean time, and also concerning angels and
the devil ; which notions, being founded on a false belief,
introduce darkness into the mind, and in those who are led
intirely by their own reasonings, engender doubtings, and
at length a total denial of the truth itself, whilst they argue
thus with themselves : How can it be that such a rich glo
rious heaven, with all its rich furniture of stars, together
with sun and moon, should be destroyed and perish ; and
how can the stars fall down from heaven to the earth,
which are so much bigger than it ? How can bodies, af
ter they have been devoured by worms, passed through
corruption, and been scattered by winds to the four cor
ners of the heavens, be restored to their proper forms for
the use of their respective souls ; and what, in the mean
time, becomes of the «oul, and what sort of a being is it
without all sense? With many such like difficulties,
which, being unintelligible, fall not within the province of
faith, and, with respect to many, beget infidelity concern
ing the immortality of the soul, Heaven and Hell, and o-
ther articles of faith as held by the church ; and that they
have been productive of such effect, we have a proof in
all those who say, Who ever came from Heaven to tell
US what sort of a place it is ? or who from the other
world to tell us whether there be such a place as Hell ?
W7hat means being tormented for ever in fire ? and what
the day of judgment? Have not men looked for it ma

rank disbelief of all the articles of the Christian faith.

this ignorance, which
is,
thatexternal things, such as mun
dane and corporeal, have so captivated and filled their
minds, as to render them unreceptive of the light of Hea
ven, and of the truths maintained in the church, any
farther than as to doctrinal knowledge, (not as principles
of life,) and that from such earthly and sensual affections
arises
a
darkness with respect to any thing farther than
mere speculative belief.
313. Many of the learned from the Christian world,
when they find themselves, after death, in
a
body, in
garments, and in houses, are in amazement
;
and when
they recollect their form;r thoughts concerning
a
future
state, the soul, spirits, Heaven and Hell, they are cover
ed with shame, own their past infatuation, and that the
simple illiterate believer was far wiser than themselves.
On scrutinizing into some of these learned sophisters,
who had confirmed themselves in their errois, and parti
cularly in ascribing all to nature,
it
was found that their
interior or spiritual part was shut against all influx from
Heaven, and their exterior or natural opsn and expand
ed, shewing that they had not turned their thoughts and
affections to Heavenly things, but to things earthly, sen
sual, and devilish
:
for according to the opening or shut
ting of the spiritual or natural part in man respectively,
so are his thoughts and affections directed to things above,
or things beneath
;
and as his interior
is
formed for the
reception of Heavenly things, and his exterior for things
of this world, so
if
he receives only the latter, without

3 1 4. That the inhabitants of Heaven are of the human
race, may also be gathered from hence, that the minds
of Angels and men are al&e, both possess the same
'fa
culties of understanding, perceiving, and willing, and
both are equally formed to receive the heavenly virtue and
powers
;
for the human mind
is
capable of like wisdom
with the angelical, and the only reason why men are not
as wise
in
this world as the angels,
is
because they are
here confined to earthly bodies, and in such
a
prison the
spiritual mind can only think naturally, or according to
the nature
it
is
joined to
:
but when
it
is
set at liberty
therefrom,
it
no longer performs its operations naturally,
but spiritually, stretches itself beyond the reach of mor
tal ken, comprehends things inconceivable by the natu
ral man, and possesses the wisdom of an angel
;
from
whence we may gather, that the interior part
in
man call
ed his Spirit, is, in its essence, angelical
;
see above, n.
57
;
(213) and when delivered from its earthly prison,
appears in the same perfect human form with the angels
j
that such
is
their form, see above, n. 73 to 77
:
but
when man's internal principle
is
not open in its superior
part, but only
in
its inferior, then, after his separation
from the body, he continues indeed to appear in
a
human
form, but in such
a
one as
is
deformed and diabolical
:
nor can he look up to Heaven, but only down to Hell.

him, n. 304, and makes a part of his original compositi
on ; consequently, heavenly or angelic wisdom may be
formed, renewed, and augmented in him. Divine or
der does not stop short of its utmost possible progress,
for if so, it would not be full and perfect ; but it proceeds
to its ultimatum or limit ; and when it has attained there
to, it proceeds afresh (according to the divine fecundity
therein, and by the use of appointed means) to new forma
tions ; and these it effects by the means of procreation,
which so becomes a new seminary or display of the divine
wisdom and wonders.
316. That our Lord rose again, not only as to his Spirit,
but also as to his body, was because, when in the world,
he glorified his whole Humanity, that is made it divine ;
for the soul which he received from the Father was the Di
vinity itself [ex se ipsum Divinum fuit,~\ and the body
was formed after the similitude of the soul, that is of the
Father, and so also was' made divine ; and therefore he
rose again as to both, (^14) differently from all other men j
which he a Iso declared to his disciples when they took him
for a si irit, saving,
" Behold my hands and my feet, that
" it is I mvstlf : handle me, and see ; for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye see me have," Luke xxiv. 39. By
which he made it appear, that he was man, not only as to
his spirit, but also as to his body.

Heaven and Heli. 249
CONCERNING THE GENTILES, OR PEOPLE
WITHOUT THE CHURCH, IN HEAVEN.
318. It is a common opinion, that all who are bom
and die without the pale of the church, such as are
called Heathens or Gentiles, are not in a way of salvation,
as being without the Word, and so remaining ignorant
of the Lord, without whom none can be saved ; and yet
we may better conclude on the other hand, that they are
in a salvable state, because the " Lord's mercy is over all
his works," and therefore he is merciful to every man,
they being men as well as those who are born within
the pale of the church, and by far the greater num
ber ; and also because it is not their fault that their know
not the Lord : besides every one that is in any good de
gree rational, will conclude, that the Lord made none of set
purpose for Hell, as he is love itself, and that it must be
a property of divine love to will the salvation of all men;
to which end he has provided, that all should have some
religion, and consequently some sense of a God and of an
inward spiritual life, for that all religion teaches, inas
much as it respects God, and so far it turns the thoughts
from the world, and from outward things. (215)
319. That the Heathens are in a salvable state, as well
as Christians, is easy for such to know, as know what
constitutes Heaven in man ; for Heaven, strictly speaking,
(215) That the Gentiles are saved as well as Christians, n. 932,

is within him, and they who have the heavenly principle
within them, and cherish
it,
may go to Heaven. Heaven
is
said to be in man when he owns
a
God, and conforms
to his will
:
this
is
a
fundamental in all religion, without
which
it
cannot subsist
;
and all religion teaches that God
is
to be worshipped
in
some manner, so as to render the
worshipper acceptable to him. This
is
an acknowledged
principle
in
the mind of man, and so far as he
is
led by
it,
so far he acts conformably to the will of God and his
conscience. It
is
well known that the Heathens led as
moral lives as Christians, and many of them excel pro
fessing Christians in this particular: now morality
is
that
which we practice either in respect to God, or in respect
to men
;
and the former
is
called the spiritual life
;
both
outwardly appear alike, but inwardly and in principle they
are very different
:
the one is
profitable to salvation, the
other
is
not
;
for he who lives
a
moral life, as command
ed by God, such
a
one
is
actuated by
a
divine principle
;
but he who does the same only from human respect,
is
actuated by
a
selfish principle. To illustrate this by an
example
:
He that forbears to injure his neighbour, be
cause
it
would be acting contrary to religion, and conse
quently to the divine will, such forbearance is from a
spiritual origin
;
but he that refrains from doing the like
through fear of the law, of loss of character, honour, or
advantage
;
such
a
one's restraint from evil being only
from selfish and worldly respects,
it
has nothing of virtue
or religion in
it
:
and as the former
is
a
spiritual, so the
latter
is
a
mere natural man
;
in the one
a
heavenly influ
ence opens his interior, and. so proceeds to operate in his
exterior life
;
in
the other
a
worldy principle from beneath
influences his external man, but not his internal
;
for no
influx
is
from the natural to the spiritual world, but vice
versa
:
wherefore,
if
the good principle from above
is
not received at the same time, the interior gate in man
becomes shut, and such
a
one altogether
a
man of this?

of good and its truth : thus, they who are in the affection
of good from love to God, they also love divine truth,
for good and truths of the same kind love one another by
sympathy, and tend to union ; (216) and therefore the
Heathens, though they be not in genuine truths in this
world, yet in the love-principle receive them in the nexti

had lived in all good charity in his life here, being in
company with some Christian spirits, heard them dis
puting on the articles of their belief, (for spirits reason,
especially on the nature of good and truth, more fully
and acutely than men) upon which, expressing some
surprize at the warmth of their controversy, he said, that
he could not endure to hear any more of
it,
for that their
dispute was merely from appearances and fallacies, say

I
am in the good principle,

can
easily know the truths that proceed from
it

I
see not at present may be given me hereafter.

I
have been fully taught that the Heathens who
have led
a
good moral life,
in
becoming obedience and
subordination, and in mutual charity, according to the
religion they knew, and thence derived
a
principle of
conscience, are accepted in the other life, and are there
diligently instructed by the angels in all things of good
and truth respecting faith, and readily receive truths so as
to be principled with them, behaving with great modesty,
and shewing
a
teachable disposition
;
and that they re
ceive instruction the more readily, as not having been
tinctured with erroneous doctrines or prejudices against
the truths of faith, and as such to be first purged from
their minds, much less with heretical doctrines concern
ing our Lord's divine person, like many professing Chris
tians, who entertain no other conception of him than as
of another man

252 A treatise concerning
as soon as they are informed that God became man, and
manifested himself to the world in our nature, they pre
sently acknowledge and adore the Lord, saying; " It
" must needs be true, that God did so manifest himself
" as he is the God of Heaven and Earth, ancL as the hu-
" man race are his offspring." (^17) It is indeed di
vine truth, that without the Lord there is no salvation;
but then it is to be understood thus, viz. that there is
no salvation but from the Lord. There are many worlds
in the universe, and those full of inhabitants ; and yet
very few among them know and think of our Lord's
having assumed the human nature in this our world : but
nevertheless, as they "worship the Deity under a human
form, they are accepted of the Lord, and taken under his
guidance. Concerning which subject, see a little piece in-
titled, De Telluribus in Universo, Of the Worlds in the
Universe.

difference, 1 was allowed to converse with both, some
times for hours, at others for days together ; but of the
wise, few such are to be found now as in former times, par
ticularly in the ancient church, which spread over a great
part of Asia, and from whence religion was propagated
in many other countries : that I might judge of their abil
ities, it was allowed me to have familiar conversation with
some of them ; and accordingly I was in company with

one, who wis formerly in high reputation for his wisdom,
and as such well known in the learned world, with whom
I discoursed on various subjects, and it was impressed
upon my mind that he was Cicero ; and knowing him to
be a man of understanding, I reasoned with him on wis
dom, on intellectual knowledge, on order, on the Word,
and lastly, on the Lord : concerning wisdom he snid, that
nothing deserved that name, but what related to the con
duct of life; and as to true intellectual knowledge, that it
was the offspring of wisdom ; with respect to order, he said,
that it proceeded from the most high God, and that to
live according to it was the best wisdom and understand
ing : in regard to the Word, when I read to him a por
tion from the prophetic writings, he appeared highly de
lighted, and in particular, that all the names and words
therein had an inward and spiritual meaning, expressing
his wonder at the same time, that the learned at this day did
not take delight in the study of it ; whereby I could plainly
perceive that his mind was inwardly enlightened. More
over, he said, that he was not able to attend farther to
my reading, as the sacred influence that flowed in up
on him was too much for his faculties to l>ear : at last we
entered into discourse concerning the Lord ; of his being
born man, but conceived by the Deity ; and how he put
off the human part received from his mother, and put on
the Divine Humanity ; and that he is the Great Governor
of the universe. To which he answered, that he knew
many things concerning the Lord, which he understood ac
cording to the measure of his capacity ; and that mankind
could not have been saved by any other means. At this
time certain heretical professing Christians present suggest
ed some scandalous things on what had been said, which
he; seemed not to regard in the least, saying, no wonder ;
if they who had corrupted their minds in their bodily life
time with such irreverent notions on these subjects, were
harder to be convinced than the ignorant, who were not
tainted in like manner.

who lived in old times, who were distinguished for wis

could even there discover my secret thoughts with such
sagacity, as to know from a single idea the whole train to
which it belonged, and also how to fill my mind with
pleasing images and instructive emblems of wisdom ;
from which it was easy to judge, that they were sages of
an eminent class : and it was told me, that they were an
cients of renown : they then draw nearer, and as I read to
them a portion of the Word, they appeared greatly de
lighted ; and I could perceive, that it gave them a more
particular pleasure to find that all and singular the things
I had read to them out of the Word, were representative
and descriptive of celestial and spiritual things ; they told
me, that when they lived upon earth, their manner of
thinking, speaking, and writing, was of the same kind, and
therein consisted their study of wisdom.
324. As to the modern Heathens, they come short of
the ancient in wisdom, but most of them are men of great
simplicity ; and such among them as lived in mutual
charity on earth, readily receive wisdom from their in
structors in the other world, of which I shall here give an
example or two. As I was reading the history of Micah,
Judg. ch. xvii. and xviii. how the Danites took away-
his graven image, his Teraphim and his Levite ; a certain
spirit from the Gentile world was present, who, in the
time of his living in the body, had been a worshipper of
a graven image ; and upon hearing of the injury done to
Micah, he was so affected with
it,
as to be overwhelmed
with grief, shewing unquestionable marks of his innocent
and tender affections
;
which some Christian spirits pre
sent taking notice of, they wondered that an idolater could
be affected with such tenderness of compassion on the oc
casion
;
presently after this, two good spirits joined him,
and told him that no image was to be worshipped, and
that he might know so much, as
a
rational creature or
man
;
and therefore, that he ought to extend and direct
his thoughts and worship beyond such senseless objects
to the Great God, the Creator and Governor of Heaven
and Earth, and that God
is
the Lord. Upon uttering these
words,
it
was given me to perceive (by communication
with his spirit) an affecting sense of interior devout ador-

ation within him, beyond that of many Christians ; from
which we may gather, that many from the Heathen world
gain a more easy admission into the kingdom of Heaven,
than modern professing Christians, according to those
words of our Lord :
" And they shall come from the East,
" and from the West, and from the North, and from the
" South, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God : and
** behold there are last which shall be first, and there are

the state in which he was, he was capable of being imbued
with all things pertaining to a true faith, and of receiving
them into his affections ; in him was compassion from the
love-principle, and in his ignorance was innocence ; and
where these are conjoined, true faith gains a spontaneous
and welcome admission ; after this, he was received into
the society of angels. (*)
325. One morning I heard a company [chorus] at a
distance, which by their badge of distinction (representing
a kind of woolly goat,, a cake of miilet, an ebony spoon,
and a floating city) appeared to be Chinese ; on their
nearer approach, some of them desired to be alone with
me for the sake of private conversation : but they received
for answer, that their companions resented the proposal
as having a right to be present also ; upon which, per
ceiving anger Fising in their minds, they began to question
with themselves, whether they had not some how given
just cause of offence to their brethren ; and shewed marks
of trouble and shame, as though they had done them
wrong, giving proof hereby of a tender conscience, and
of their being in the principle of charity. Soon after I
entered into conversation with them, and turned the sub

I perceived them to shew some repugnance when I men

from some prejudice they had been tinctured with in this
life from seeing the Christians lead worse lives, and to
shew less of charity than their own countrymen -, but
when I only used the name of the Lord, they gave tokens
of a devout reverence ; they were then informed by the
angels, that the Christian doctrine recommended and
enjoined love and charity beyond all other religions in
the wo'ld, but that few of its professors lived according
thereto. There are some Gentile spirits, who, in their
life-time here, knowing from character and conversation
with them, how Christians, many of them, lived in
adultery, hatred, strife, drunkenness, and other vices,
which the Gentiles held in abhorrence, become thereby
more timid in the other world in embracing the truths
of the Christian faith, till instructed by the angels, that
the Christian religion teaches the very contrary to such
practices, though the generality of its professors walk less
by its rules and precepts than the Heathens themselves ;
upon which, though after some delay, they embrace the
faith, and worship the Lord.
326. It is customary for such of the Gentiles, as were
wont to worship any supposed god under the form of an
image or statue, to be introduced, on their entrance into
the other world, to some spirits who were to represent
such gods or idols, and that, in order to expose and cure
them of such vain and foolish phantasies; and after staying
with them some days, they are dismissed: and they who
have been given to worship men, are introduced to those
very men, or some appointed to represent them ; as
many of the Jews are to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, or
David ; and when they find that they have no divine
power to help them, they are put to confusion, and re
manded to their proper stations. Of all the Gentiles,
the Africans meet wiih the kindest reception in Heaven,
as they shew the readiest disposition to receive all the good
things and truths of that kingdom ; they chuse to be called
the obedient, and not the faithful, saying, that the latter
character belongs to the Christians, as being in the faith,
and not to them, unless they had received
it,
or are, as
they term
it,
capable of receiving it.

327. I have conversed with some who were of the
ancient church : that is here called the ancient church
which was next after the deluge, and which spread over
many kingdoms, viz. Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria, Ethi
opia, Lybia, Arabia, Egypt, Philistia to Tyre and Sidon,
through the land of Canaan on both sides of Jordan :
(218) and they who at that time were instructed in the doc
trine of the Lord's Advent upon earth, and received the
faith, but afterwards departed from it to idolatry, had
their station in front to the left, in a dark place, and were
in a miserable condition ; the sound of their voice was a
piping monotony, and they scarce talked rationally : they
said that they had been there many ages, but were at times
set at liberty to do drudgery and servile offices for others.
By their condition was given me what to think of many
professing Christians, and of their state in the other world;
I mean such as, though not outward idolaters, yet are so
inwardly, worshipping themselves and the world with an
affectionate service, and denying the Lord in their hearts.

dispersed over the face of the earth, and therefore it is
denominated catholic or universal, including all of what
soever religion that live conscientiously according thereto;

and has attained to the knowledge of the Lord thereby, is

OF INFANTS, OR LITTLE CHILDREN IN HEAVEN.,
329. ACCORDING to the belief of some, no other
Infants go to Heaven than those which are born in the
church, and the reason they assign is, because such are
bapfized, and hy baptism initiated into the faith, of the
church
:
but such persons are to be told, that baptism
is
not the pnxurirg cause either of Heaven or of Faith to
any one, but serves only for
a
sign or nu-morial that such
person
is
to be regenerated
;
and that they who are born
in
the church have the means of being so, as therein
is
the
Word, which contains those divine truths, by which re
generation
is
eft. cted, and whereby the Lord is
known,
who
is
the author of regeneration
:
(219) and they are
also to know, that every Infant, dying such whether he
be born in the church, or out of the church, whether
of godly or ungodly parents,
is
accepted of the Lord, and
educated by angels, according to divine order
;
and thus
being formed to good affections, and through them *a
the knowledge of truth, when advanced in understanding
and wisdom, he
is
introduced into Heaven, and becomes
an angel. Every one that thinks rationally may know of
a
truth, that none were ever designedly born for Hell, but

is
a
sign of regeneration from the Lord through
the truths of faith revealed in the Word, n. 4255, 5120, 9089, 10239,
10386, 10387, 10388, 10392. That baptism
is
a
sign of our belonging
to that church, where the Lord, who
is
the Author of Regeneration,
is
acknowledged, and in which
is
the revealed Word, from which we
derive those truths of faith, by means of which regeneration
is
ef
fected, n. 10386, 10387, 10388. That the outward baptism neither
gives faith nor salvation, but
is
a
sign and pledge of their being re-,

on the Contrary, all for Heaven ; and consequently that
whoever goes to the formi r, must owe it to his own fault,
which cannot be the case of Infants.
330. All who die Infants, are equally such in the orher
world, of like infantile minds, of like innocence in igno
rance, and a like tenderness in all things, being only as
the young plants that are to grow up to Angels, for Infants
are not Angels as yet, but only in tie way of becoming
such, seeing that everv one appears, upon his entrance
into the ot er world, in the same state in which he depart
ed this, whether Infant, Child, Youth, Adult, or aged ;
but, in some time after, every one's state is changed ; but
it is to be observed, that the state of Infants has this ad
vantage over others, that being in innocence, actual evil
by consent of will has not taken root in them, so that they
are easily receptive of all heavenly good ; for innocence is
the proper receptacle of the truth of faith and the good
of love.
331. The state of infants in the other world is much
higher than in this, as there they are not invested with
an earthly body, but with one like to that of the Angels,
for the earthly body being gross, does not receive its first
sensations and movements from the interior or spiritual,
but from the exterior or natural world and therefore In
fants here must learn to walk, behave, and speak, nay,
their very senses, as seeing and hearing, must be formed
by use ; but not so in Heaven, for then, being spirits, they
are actuated by an interior impuse, walk spontaneously
ofthemselves ; they also speak, but at first on y confusedly
from the impulse of affection in general, withouY'any
distinct arrangement of ideas: but this they soon come to,
as their exterior part is conformable to their interior.
That the discourse of Angels flows spontaneously frora
their affections modified by their ideas, and therefore
speak as they think, see above, n. 234 to 245.
332. Infants as soon as raised from death, which is im
mediately after their decease, are 'taken up into Heaven,
and are delivered to such of the female Angels as,when
in this world, were more particularly fond of children,
and who also loved God : now as such, from a certain ma.

ternal tenderness in their nature above common, loved all
Little Children, so they receive them as their own ; and
the Children in return love them as their own mothers,
each of which takes as many of them under her care as her
tenderness for them prompts her to take. This particular
Heaven appears full in front in the same direction of view
wherein the Angels behold the Lord, and that because
all Little Children are under the immediate tuition of the
Lord ; and their influx is from the heaven of Innocence,
which is the third Heaven.
333. Little Children are of different dispositions, some
like the Spiritual, some like the Celestial Angels : such
as are of the former class, appear in Heaven stationed to
the left hand ; those of the latter class, to the right hand,
and all Little Children in the Grartd Man or Heaven,
are in the province of the eyes ; such as resemble the
Spiritual Angels, in the province of the left eye; and
such as resemble the Celestials, in the province of the
right eye ; and that because the Lord appears to the An
gels of the Spiritual Kingdom, fronting the left eye ; and
to the Angels of the Ci lestial Kingdom, fronting the
right eye ; see above, n. 118. Little children being
thus in the province of the eyes, denotes them to be un
der the immediate guardianship and protection of the
Lord.
334. How Infants are educated in Heaven shall here
briefly be told. They are first taught to speak by those
that have the care of them : their first utterance is only a
kind of t; ffcciionate sound, which, by degrees, grows
more, distinct, as their minds become furnished with
ideas, lor the ideas of the mind springing from the affec
tionate part, immediately give birth and form to the
speech of the Angels, as mentioned above, n. 234 to
245. Into their affections, which all proceed from inno
cence, the delectable things, which are the objects before
them, first insinuate themselves ; and as these are of a spi
ritual origin, they serve as receptacles of such heavenly
things as aie of use to open their minds, and enlarge their
faculties in the way of *intellectual attainments: after
cjpn.pietin^' this their first age, they are translated to ano

ther Heaven, where they are instructed by angelical Mas
ters, and so pass on to further improvements.
335. Little Children are first taught by beautiful simi-
litudes and instructive emblems, adequate to their genius
and capacity, containing lessons of wisdom beyond ima
gination : thus they are gradually formed to that wisdom,
which has goodness for its essence. To mention here.
Only two similitudes or representatives that I was witness
to, whereby to judge of the rest : and first, they repre
sented our Lord as rising from the sepulchre, and also,
the uniting of his Humanity with the Divinity, and that
with such divine skill, as far exceeded all human wisdom,
and, at the same time, with infantine simplicity : they .
represented likewise the form of a sepulchre, and also of
our Lord, but in so delicate and refined a manner asi
scarcely to be perceived ; and that because there is some
thing so affectingly mournful and sad in that image of
mortality, which they thus prudently softened : they then
caused to pass into the sepulchre, as it were, a thin lucid
vapour, remotely to .represent the spiritual life signified
in baptism. After this I saw a representation of our
Lord's descent to the Spirits in prison, (1 Pet. iii, 19, 20.)
and his ascent with them into Heaven, conducted with
incomparable skill and pious reverence ; and in order to
accommodate the representation to their childish minds,
they let down, as it were, small cords of the finest tex
ture, to aid in the elevation of his body ; guarding at the
same time, with religious caution, against admitting any
thing into the representation that did not image and lead
their tender thoughts to something spiritual and heavenly j
not to mention other kinds of emblematical scenery made
use of, in order to instil into them good affections,, and
to form their minds to truth, by entertainments adapted
to their faculties.
336. I had also a proof of the delicacy of their senti
ments once, as I was praying the Lord's prayer, when
they joined their ideas with mine ; and I became sensible
of an influx proceeding from their intellectual part, as
that of tender affection ; and that their minds were open
to the Lord, so that I could perceive, thai what at first

seemed an influx from them, was a transflux through
them ; for there is a near communication from the Lord,
to the minds of Little Children, as not being shut against
the divine influx like those of adults, and neither oppos
ing the entrance of truth through the resistance of error,
nor hindering the admission of good, and so of wisdom,
by any wilful and acquired evil. Hence we may learn
that infants do not enter upon the angelical state immedi
ately after death, but are gradually prepared for it by the
knowledge of good and truth, according to heavenly or
der ; the Lord providing means suited to their capacities
and dispositions, to fit them as recipients for all the truths
pertaining to good \ycra boni.~\ and all the good things
pertaining to truth, [bona veri.~\
337. It has also been shewed to me how things inward
and spiritual insinuate themselves into their tender minds,
through such external delights as are accommodared to
their genius respectively. 1 have seen them beautifully
dressed, and adorned on their little arms and breasts with
flowers of celestial colours ; and thus I saw them once
walking with their angelical instructors and virgins in one
of the gar> ens of paradise : the gardens were not so much
adorned with trees, as with what may be compared in a
sort to our laurel espalies and arched walks, with alleys
leading to sweet recesses ; and as the Little Children drew
near, the borders of flowers seemed to glow with fresh
and more lively lustre ; from whence we may gather what
pleasure they must receive from such exhilerating scenes,
ministering to the increase as well as delights of innocence
and charity, through the bounty and influence of the
Lord.
338. Is has been shewed to me by a manner of com
munication common in the other world, what kind of
ideas Infants have of the objects they see ; and it was
found, that they all appeared to them as having life, from
whence the idea of life became joined with all their
thoughts. It appeared also to me, that Children here on
earth have much the same ideas in all their little diver-
isons, as not having yet attained, like those of a more ad
vanced age, to know by reflection what it is to want
life.

339. It has been said above, that all Little Children
are by disposition and genius distinguished into celestial
and spiritual respectively : now they of the former class
are easily known by this, viz. that there is something
soft and gentle in all they think, say, and do, as if it
spontaneously flowed from a principle of good within, of
love to the Lord, and to other Litde Children ; whereas
the latter shew not the like softness but something quick
and smart [alatum et vibrati/e] in all their behaviour. (*)
The like also appears in their resentment, and other
ways.
340. Many may think that Little Children keep their
State in Heaven, and so continue Children among the
Angels ; and they who know nothing of the nature of
Angels may be confirmed in this mistake, by seeing An
gels painted and carved in the churches : but the matter
is quite otherwise; for as understanding and wisdom are
essential to an Angel, so Children, being destitute of
these, though among the Angels, yet are not of their
number; but as soon as they have attained thereto, they
then first become Angels ; and then, which was matter
of wonder to me, they no longer appear as Children, but
as Adults, having, through wisdom, changed the infan
tile genius and character for that which is angelical. That
Children in Heaven, when perfected in understanding
and ivisdom, appear in the form of Adults, or as Youths,
is because understanding and wisdom is their true spirit
ual food; (220) and what is nourishment to their minds,
serves for the same to their bodies also, and this by Cor
respondency ; for the form of their body [with respect
to all in the other worlds] is the form of the spirit within.
(*) See n. 241.

ing, and wisdom, and also constitutes the good and truth from which
they proceed, n. 3114, 4459, 4792, 5147 —5656, 8562,9003. Hence
that food, in a spiritual sense oi the word, signifies all that proceed-
eth out of the mouth of God, Matt. iv. 4. n. 681. As bread signifies
all kinds of food in general, consequently so does it signify all celes.

264 A treatise concerning
It is here to be noted, that in Heaven Children advance
not in their external form and appearance beyond Youth,
or the flower of their age, but stop there forever : that I
might know this for certain, it was permitted me to con
verse with some that were educated in Heaven as Chil
dren, and grown up ; and also with s*»me others whilst
they were children, and with the same afterwards when
they had attained to their flower of youth ; and from both
I received information concerning their progression in life,
from state to state.
341. That innocence is the receptacle of all heavenly
good things, and therefore that the innocence of Little
Children is the plain er ground of all their affections for
good and truth, may appear from what has been said be
fore, n. 276 to 283, concerning the Innocence of the
Angels in Heaven ; that it consists in a resigned submis
sion to the government of the Lord, and a renunciation
of man's own will, who is only so far in innocence as he
is remote from self, and so far only is he in the Lord, or
partakes of his righteousness and merits : but the inno
cence of Little Children, as observed before, is not ge
nuine innocence, because void of wisdom ; for genuine
innocence is wisdom, and so far only is any one to be
reputed wise, as he is resigned to the will of the Lo'rti,
or is content to he "under his guidance : and therefore
Children are conducted from their primary external in
nocence of infancy, to that internal innocence of wisdom,
which crowns their education and progress ; and wlien
they have attained to this, their formal external inno
cence, which was the ground of the latter, is joined with
it,
and so they become perfect Children or Angels.' The
innocence of Children was imagined to me by the repre
sentation of
a
Child
in
wood with scarce any thing of life
in
it,
but which was vivified gradual)}, answerably to
the progress of Children in their knowledge of truth, and
their affection for good
:
and afterwards
I
had
a
repre
sentation of genuine innocence in
a
very beautiful Child
quite lively and naked
:
for the innocents which are in
the inmost Heaven, and as such nearest to the Lord, ap

innocence is represented by nakedness without shame, as
we read of the first man and his wife in Paradise, Gen.
ii. 25 ; but when they lost their innocence, they were
ashamed, because of their nakedness, and hid themselves,
chap. iii. 7, 10, 11. In a word, the more the Angels
excel in wisdom, the higher is their degree of innocence ;
'
and the higher their degree of innocence, the more do
they appear to one another as Little Children : hence it is,
that Infancy in the Word signifies innocence ; see above,
n. 278.
342. I have conversed with the Angels concerning In
fants, and asked them if they were pure from all evil,
seeing they had not committed actual evil lik-j Adults ; to
which they answered, that they were in evil as well as
the latter ; nay, that of themselves they were nothing but
evil ; (221) but were kept from evil, like as were the An
gels, and preserved in good by the Lord, and that in a
way so little perceived by them, that it appeared to them
as if they were good of themselves ; and therefore all In
fants, after they are grown ui> in Heaven, in order to
cure them of such a false conceit of themselves, as though
they possessed any good but from the Lord, are some
times left to their own hereditary evils for a while, to
convince them of the truth of the matter : one such, who
was a certain king's son, and had died an Infant, but was
grown up in Heaven, had conceived the foregoing erro
neous opinion, and was therefore suffered to be possess
ed of his own hereditary innate evils ; upon which I per
ceived from his sphere, that he was of an imperious mind,
(221) That all men, without exception, are by nature born to all
kinds of evil, so that as to their proper selves, they are nothing but
evil, n. 210, 215, 731, 874, 875, 876 — 10284, 10286, 10731. That
therefore man must be born again, thalis, regenerated, n. 3701 . That
it is an hereditary evil in man to love himself more than God, and this
world more than Heaven, and to esteem his neighbour as nothing in
comparison of himself) or only for himself, so that he may be said to
be love of self and the world in the very abstract, n. 694, 731, 43 17,
5660. That the prevailing love of self and of the world is the root of
all evil, n. 1307, 1308, 1331, 1594, 1691—10038, U'7-J2 ; such as
contempt of others, enmity, hatred, revenge, cruelty, deceit, Sec. n.
6667,7372,7373,7374,9348, 10038, 10742 ; and that from these evils

and made light of adultery, having inherited these pro
pensities from his parents : but after seeing what he was}
by nature, and being humbled at the sight, he was re
ceived again into the Society oi Angels to which he be
longed. No one suffers punishment in the other world
merely for hereditary evil, as that was not contracted by
his own fault, but only for that actual evil which proceed
ed from himself; and consequently, only for so much of
hereditary tvil as he adopted and appropriated to himself
by his own will and deed : nor are Infants, when grown
up to Adults in Heaven, consigned for a time to their
proper natural state of hereditary evil, merely for the sake
of punishment, but in order to their conviction, that of
themselves they are only evil, and therefore delivered
from Hell, which belongs to an evil nature, by the mere
mercy of the Lord ; consequently, that their heavenly in
heritance is from his free gift, and not from any merit
in themselves ; and therefore they have nothing to glory
in, or whereof to esteem themselves above others, on ac
count of any self-assumed good ; for that in so doing,
they would as mm h trangress the law of mutual love, as
the true doctrine of faith.
343. Oft times when companies [Chori]
* of Little
Children have been with me, and their speech sounded
in a soft confused manner, as rot having yet attained to
speak in concert as when grown up, 1 observed with
something of surprize, that certain spirits present could
not refrain from urging them to speak in another manner,
on which the Infant Chorus shewed a repugnance, deno
ting something like resentment, saying, when given them
to speak, that it should not be so. This I have often per
ceived, and was to4d, that it was for their trial, and to
accustom them to resist any temptation to what is false
or evil, as also not to suffer themselves to be compelled
to think, speak, or apt, by direction from any other than
the Lord only.
* By the word Chori in this place, the Author means such com
panies of Spirits or Angels as think in unity, and speak in symphony,
so concentrating, as it were, their thoughts and voids, as if they
constituted but one person : but this is hard to describe ; see above,

344.- Thus much may serve to shew in what manner
Infants are educated in Heaven, that so through the
knowledge of truth, and the wisdom of good, th^y may
be qualified for the angelical life, consisting in that love
to the Lord, and one another, which has its ground in
innocence : but how contrary is the Education of Chil
dren with many on earth ! To give only the following in
stance. As I was one day walking in the street of a cer
tain great City, I saw some boys fighting, which present
ly drew a great croud round them, which seemed much
pleased with the sight ; and I was told, that the parents
of the young warriors were among them, encouraging
their sons to the combat : certain good spirits and angels
then present with me saw all that passed, tar'mgh my
eyes, and were affected, even to horror, at the sight,
more especially at the encouragement given to the fray by
the parents ; saying, that all such ways of inciting chil
dren to hatred and revenge, tended to extinguish in them
all mutual love and innocence implanting in them by the
Lord ; consequently, .that they did all in their power to
disq ualify their own Children for Heaven, where all is
love. May such parents as wish well to their Children
take warning thereby.
345. And here for a word concerning the difference
between those who die in their Infant state, and those
who die Adults. Now the latter have in this life acquired
a ground or plane \_planum,~\ which they take with them
to the other world, and which consist of their memory
and prevailing natural affections ; this remains fixed, and
though quiescent after death as to any activity, yet it
serves as an ultimate ground or basis to the thoughts;
and hence it follows, that according to the quality of this
ground or plane, and the Correspondence of the rational
part therewith, so is the man after death : * but such
* As it is very difficult to give a clearer translation of the fore
going passage ; so probably few of our readers, besides those who
have been accustomed to thinking abstractedly, will readily enter in
to the Author's meaning : let it suffice here to observe, in general,
that by the acquired ground, or plane, (or fund) here spoken of, we
are to understand such an habitual disposition or tendency to the

as die Infants have no such plane, but one that is natural-
spiritual [planum naturale spirit uale,~] as not having con
tracted any impurity from tin's material world and earthly
body, and therefore not being infected with the like gross
affections and cogitations, but having imbibed all they
have from heavenly influence : besides, Infants know no
thing of their having been born in this world, but look
upon themselves as natives of Heaven, being ignorant of
every other kind of nativity than what is spiritual, and ef
fected by knowledges of good and truth, and that under
standing and wisdom from which man is only properly
denominated man ; and as these are only from the Lord,
so it is their belief, and their rejoicing therein, that they
are the Lord's* But notwithstanding this, the condition
of Men, who have had their time in this world, may be
equally perfect with that of Infants in the next, if they
put away from them their corporeal and earthly affections,
which are the love of self and of the world, and in the
room thereof become receptive of spiritual loves.
OF THE WISE AND THE SIMPLE IN HEAVEN.
346. IT is commonly believed, that the Wise Men
will be exalted in Jheaven above the Simple in honour
and dignity, because we read in Daniel xii. 3. that " they
**
that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firma
things of this World as remains with us after death, and by a kind of
secret influence of habit withholds the thoughts and affections from
heavenly things : and yet not so to be understood, as if this tenden
cy were not to be done away by the methods appointed for our purifi
cation in the intermediate state, where it was not by free choice and
determination of the will become radical and essential in the consti
tution of the soul. Let it be observed, that the lesson held forth to
the reader is of infinite importance, as it denotes, that grace may be
so extinguished, and the habitual love of sin so confirmed in this life,
as to place us beyond the possibility of help in the next, according to
those words of the Prophet : " Can the Ethiopean change his skin ?
" or the leopard his spots '. then may ye ajso do good that are accus-
" tomed to do evil," far. xiii. 23. Tr.

" ment, and they that turn many to righteousness, as
" the stars for ever and ever ;" but few seem to know
who are meant here by the Wise, and by those that turn
many to righteousness ; it being generally thought that
this is spoken of the learned and the wise doctors in the
church, who excel in doctrinal knowledge and preaching,
and more especially such among them as have converted
many to the faith ; these are called men of wisdom and
understanding
irk
this world, but they are not so
in
a
spi
ritual sense, unless their wisdom be of
a
heavenly quali
ty, which shall here be spoken to.
347. True understanding, in
a
heavenly sense of the
word,
is
interior understanding, springing from the love
of truth, and not from any motive of glory either here or
hereafter, but from
a
pure regard to truth itself in minds
intimately affected and delighted with
it
;
and all such
love the Light of Heaven or Divine Truth, and conse
quently the Lord himself, who
is
the Truth itself; see
above, n. 126 to 140. Now this heavenly Light of Truth
only enters the interior recesses of the mind, as be
ing its proper receptacle
;
and as
it
enters and
is
receiv
ed there,
it
gives delight, as
is
the property of all influx
from Heaven to do
;
such
is
the origin of genuine affec
tion for Truth, for its own sake
;
and they who are in
this affection or love, are in the true heavenly understand
ing, and "shine as the brightness of the firmament:"
they are said to shine, because Divine Truth in Heaven
appears splendent; see above, n. 132; and the firma
ment or expanse of Heaven signifies by correspondency
that interior intellectual part both in Angels and men,
which
is
in the Light of Heaven
;
but as to those who
love truth only for the sake of honour here, or glory
hereafter, such shine not in Heaven, forasmuch as their
delight
is
not in the Light of Heaven, but of this world,
which of itself, without the former,

but as the means subservient to that end ; and therefore
as 'their view is directed, not to Heaven, but to this
world, not to the Lord, but to themselves, consequent
ly they are not in the Light of Heaven, but in that of
this world only ; these, Ldeed, to outward appearance,
and before men, seem as knowing and wise as the Chil
dren of Light ; nay, and sometimes wiser, as being more
warmed with the fire of self-love, and having learned to
speak in like manner with them, and also to make a shew
of heavenly affections ; but inwardly and in the sight of
the Angels they appear very different. Let this suffice
to shew who are meant in Scripture by the Wise, who
shall " shine in Heaven like the brightness of the firma-
" ment :" and now for a word as to such as are meant
by those " that turn many to righteousness, who shall
" shine as the stars."
348. By such as turn many to righteousness are meant
the truly Wise, and they only are called such in Heaven,
who are in the good of life, or who apply Divine Truths
immediately to practical use ; for Divine Truth, when
so applied becomes, good, as being animated with free
will and love, which constitutes the very essence of wis
dom : whereas they who are called intellectual or under
standing men, live not from truth as as a principle, but
commit it first to their memory, and from thence as a store
house draw occasionally the documents of truth, where
by to regulate their life. * In what particulars these

world, n. 9754, 3108. That the light of this world is as darkness to
the angels, n 1521, 1783, 1880.
* The difference between wise and intellectual men, according
to our Author's definition, appears to be this; viz. that the former
receive divine truths into their affections, (and not speculatively on
ly) and are led thereby spontaneously, as from a divine principle or
instinct, into all good ; whereas the latter treasure up truth in the
memory, and so fit the external life thereto by a kind of reflex opera
tion of mind ; so that the good life of the former stems, as it were
natural, and the good life of the latter, as it were studied and artifi
cial. 1 wish that I may have so expressed mys; If here, as to render
the matter more clear to the reader. Let it be remembered, that

lestial and the spiritual, n. 20 to 28 ; and alsoiii the arti
cle concerning the Three Heavens, n. 29 to 40. They
who are in the Celestial Kingdom of the Lord, which is
the Third or Inmost H aven, are called Righteous, and
that beeause they ascribe no righteousness to themselves,
but all to the Lord on y. Now righteousness in Heaven
signifies good proceeding from the Lord ; (223 ) and they
. who receive the same, and minister therefrom to the con
version of others, are such as the Lord speaks of, Matt,
xiii. 43. " Then shall the righreous shine forth as the
" sun in the kingdom of my Father." Their shining as
the sun, is from their being in love to the Lord from the
Lord, as that love is signified by the sun; see above, n.
li.6 to 125 : their light also partakes of the brightness of
flame ; and their ideas are vivacious and corresponding
thereto ; inasmuch as they receive the good of love im
mediately from the Lord as the heavenly sun.
349. All who have acquired tiue understanding and
wisdom in this world are received into Heaven, and be
come Angels, every one according to the measure and
quality thereof; for whatsoever principle any one has ac
quired and fixed in himself in this world, that remains
with him after death, and is also augmented to fulness,
but that within the degree of his affection and desire of
good and truth, and not beyond it ; they who have little
affection and desire, receive but little, but yet as much
as they can contain ; and they who have much affection
dom {inlelligentia et safiientia,) precisely according to these defini
tions; but where ti.cy are spoken of in distinction, they are to be un
derstood according thereto. Tr.

good which prevails and reigns in Heaven, n. 9486, 9;;86. That the
righteous or justified person is he to whom is imparted that merit and
righteousness; and he the unrighteous and unjustified person, who
builds upon his own fancied righteousness and merit, n. 5069, 9263.

affection and desire in every one being the measure
that is to be filled : the reason of this is, because love,
the properties of which are affection and desire, receives
what is answerable or suitable to itself according to its
measure, as signified by those words of our Lord,
" Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall
"have more abundantly." —"Good measure shall be

350. . All are received into Heaven, who have loved
good and truth as such ; and they who have loved them
much are called Wise, and they who loved them little
are called Simple ; the former enjoy much light in Hea
ven, the latter less ; each according to the degree of his
love : to love good and truth as such, or for their own
sake, is to will and to do them from choice, for such
only can be said to love them ; and they are the people
who love the Lord, and are loved by him ; for good and
truth are from the Lord, and consequently the Lord is
in them as proceeding from him, and also in all such as
receive them into their life's principle by willing and do
ing them. Man also, considered in himself, is no other
than his measure of good and truth from the Lord, the
former constituting his will, and the latter his understand
ing ; and as the will and understanding are, such is the
man : hence it follows, that so far any is loved of the
Lord, as his will is formed by good, and his understand
ing by truth : to be loved of the Lord is inseparable from
love to him, for love is reciprocal, and to him whom
the Lord loveth, he giveth to love him again.
351. It is commonly believed in the world, that they
who are men of learning and skill in the doctrines of the
Church, and the letter of Scripture, or in the Sciences,
are more acute discerners of truths than other men, and
consequently excel them in true understandingand wisdom;

false. True understanding and wisdom consists in see
ing and perceiving what is good and what is true, and there
by what is false and evil, and in accurately disinguishins:
betwixt them, and that from an interior intuition and dis
cernment. There is in every one an interior and exterior,
the former be longing to the inward orspiritual, andthe latter
to the outward or natural man; and accordingly as the inte
rior is formed and co-operates with the exterior, so a man
sees and perceives. The interior of man can only be
formed in Heaven ; but the exterior is formed in this
world. When the interior is formed in Heaven, then
heavenly things pass by influx into the exterior, which is
from this world, and from it to a Correspondence with
the former, that so both may co-operate or act as one ;
and when this is effected, then the man sees and per
ceives from an inward sight. In order to the formation of
the interior, this one medium is requisite; viz. That
man look up to a Divine Supreme Being, and to Heaven ;
for, as was said before, the interior is formed in Hea
ven ; and a man is then said to look up to the Divine Be
ing, when he believes in him, and that he is the Foun
tain of all good and truth, and consequently of all under
standing and wisdom; and is willing to be led and go
verned by him : so, and so only, the interior- of man is
opened to divine things. A man in this belief, and li
ving according thereto, is in the power and capacity of
becoming intellectual and wise ; but in order to his being
really so, he has many things to learn, both concerning
Heaven and this world ; as touching the former, from
the Word and the doctrines of the Church ; and as touch
ing the latter, from scientific knowledge ; and is also to
take along with him, that in the same proportion that he
applies knowledge to the purposes of good life, so far
only is he worthy of being reputed an understanding and
wise man, as in that degree and no farther, his interior
sight, which is the property of his intellect, and his interior
affection, which is that of his will, are in their progress to
perfection. The Simpleare of the foliowing class, viz. such

a
moral, civil, or natural ; such have" indeed a sight of
truths, and receive them when heard, but have no in
ward clear perception of them : but they who are deno
minated Wise are as follows, viz. such who have not only
their interior affections open to Divine Good, but also
their intellectual faculties so cultivated and enlarged, that
they see Divine truths by an internal evidence. Thus
much may serve to shew what is meant by a true under
standing and wisdom.
352. A spurious understanding and wisdom is not to
see what. is true and good, and from thence what is false
and evil, from any interior sight, but only to believe
it,
so on the authority of others, and then to study to confirm
ourselves in that belief, Now as such persons receive
not Truth by the Light of Truth, but on the credit given
to another, they are equally liable to embrace falsehood as
well as truth, and to confirm themselves in the former by
reasonings and arguments adapted thereto, so as to give
it
the appearance of truth, for whatever
is
so confirmed puts
on that appearance
;
and there
is
nothing but what
is
ca
pable of such kind of confirmation. Now the interior fa
culties of such persons are only open from beneath, but
their exterior in proportion to the degree of such confir
mation
;
and therefore the light they see
by
is
not the light
of Heaven, but the light of this world, or natural light, in
which light what
is
false may appear as true, and when con
firmed by
a
specious kind of arguments, may carry in them
an apparent lustre of evidence, but not so when viewed
in
a
heavenly Light. Ofthis class such are least intelligent
and wise, who have dealt most in this way of confirmation;
and they come nearest to wisdom, who have practised
it
the least. Hence may be gathered what
is
meant by
spurious understanding and wisdom
;
however, we range
not under this class what has been received by children
on the authority of their teachers,
if
when grown up to the
use of reason they do not implicitly enslave themselves
to their documents, but study to find out the truth, and
cherish
it
when found
:
as such are led by
a
sincere affec

it by arguments .
(224) To illustrate this by an example :
Certain Spirits were reasoning together, how it came to
pass, that the brute animals were born toall knowledge con
gruous to their nature respectively, but not man ; upon
which they were told, that the former stood in the prim
itive order of their nature, but man not so, and therefore
he is to be led back into it by instruction and dicipline :
whereas ifman had preserved his original perfection, con
sisting in loving God above all things, and his neighbour
as himself ; in that case he would have been born with
innate understanding and wisdom, and to the belief of all
truth, according to the enlargement of his faculties. Now
the good Spirits immediately perceived the evidence of
this argument by the Light of truth ; but the Spirits who
had confirmed themselves in Solifidianism, and thereby,
had cast aside Divine love and charity, could not receive
it,
as their confirmation in error had obscured in them
the Light of truth.
353. False understanding and wisdom
is
that which
is
separate from the acknowledgment of
a
Divine Being in
all those who place Nature in the room of God
:
all such
think as mere animals, and are no other than sensualists,

iJ7<5 A treatise concerning
the objects of sense laid up in their memory, and viewed
in the light of material nature, though the same natural
sciences are of subservient use to form the minds of per
sons truly intellectual : by the Sciences we understand ex

believe the operations of a divine principle, and have no
higher sentiments of religion than what relate to the out
ward man ; such see nothing farther in the Scriptures
than others do in their sciences,nor consider them as con -
taining matters that are to be understood only by a rea
son enlightened from above ; and this because the inner
gate of their minds, and the faculties next to them, are
shut against Divine illumination ; and this because they
have turned away Uieir affections and understanding
from heavenly to earthly things ; and therefore it is
that Truth and Good are to them as darkness, and false
hood and Evil as light : but, notwithstanding, mere sen
sual men can play their part at reasoning, and some of
them very acutely, but then it is from the fallacies of sense
in which they have confirmed themselves by the subtleties
of science, and because of their adroitness herein they con

nessand warmth to their reasonings : such are they who are
in false understanding and wisdom.and are meant by those
words of our Lord, Matt. xiii. 13, 14, 15. " Seeing they
"' s-ee not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they un-
" derstand," &c. xi.25. "Thou hast hid these things from
" the wise and prudent, and revealed them unto babes."
354. I have had the privilege of conversing with many
learned men after their decease, some of them of great
fame, and celebrated in the learned world for their writ
ings ; and with others of less note, but of deep under
standing: now, such of them as inwardly disbelieved a
Divine Being, though they outwardly professed one,
became so stupid in the other world, as not to be able to
comprehend truths relating even to civil matters, much
less such as are spiritual : and I could also perceive, nay,
behold (for in the spiritual world such things are repre
sented in a visible manner) that their interior was so
darkened, even to blackness, and so shut against every
thing spiritual, as to be inaccessible to all heavenly light
and influx : and that inward blackness appeared more
particularly intense in those who had confirmed them
selves in unbelief by their scientifical reasonings. All
such in the other world greedily imbibe falsehood and
error, as a sponge does water, and reject all truth, as
rain is impelled from the tile of an house ; nay, I have
been informed, that the interior of those, who have ex
alted Nature in the room of God, appears, as it were, os
sified ; and their heads, even to the nostrils, have the re
semblance of ebony, in token of their being destitute of
all spiritual and intellectual preception : they who are
of this class are plunged into a kind of gulphs or bogs,
where they are disquieted and terrified with fantasies
produced by the falsities they had adopted and cherished :
the infernal fire of their life is a thirst of glory and the
pride of distinction, by which they are incited to exas
perate one another, and. to torment all they can such as
refuse to worship them as deities ; and this they do by
turns. Such is the end of all the learning and wisdom
of this world, which, not having its foundation in the
faith of Almighty God, is utterly destitute of heavenly
light.

355. That such is the lot of the persons before menti
oned, in the other world, may be gathered from hence ;
viz. that all things in their natural memory, and im
mediately connected with their bodily senses, (as are
the scientifical acquisitions spoke of above) are then
totally quiescent, and only the conclusions or principles
formed from thence remain as a fund to supply them
with thoughts and matter for conversation ; for though
a man carries his natural memory along with him, yet
what he had laid up therein falls not under his intuition
as before, as not being concordant with the light of a
different world, and therefore he cannot call them forth
to use ; whereas things of a rational and intellectual na
ture, grounded on scientific principles, quadrate with
the light of the spiritual world ; consequently, so far as
any one has attained to rationality by the use of the
sciences in this world, so far he is rational after he is set
free from the body, it being the same spirit that thinks
in both worlds. (227)
356. But as to those, who, by the cultivation of their
minds, by the sciences and different kinds of knowledge,
have acquired true understanding and wisdom,' as is the
case with those who apply all their attainments to the
purposes of good life, walk in the fear of God, reverence
his Word, and adhere to spiritual morality fspiritualem
moralem vitam, see above, n. 319.) To such the scien
ces serve, as the means of attaining to wisdom, and of
strengthening the things appertaining to faith : it was gi
ven me to perceive (he interior of their minds, wherein
all appeared transparent from the light within them, and
representing the sparkling colours and brightness of the
diamond, the ruby, and the sapphire, in degree of lustre,
according as they had employed their knowledge of the

is the appearance which true understanding and wisdom

OF THE RICH AND THE POOR IN HEAVEN.

that the Poor only, not the Rich, meet with a reception
there ; others hold, that both Rich and Poor are admitted
alike ; and a third sort, that the former can gain no ad
mittance without first divesting themselves of their
wealth, and entering into a voluntary poverty : and all
these support their different opinions by passages from

the Scriptures : but they who make such distinctions be
tween the Rich and the Poor, in respect to their qualifi
cation for Heaven, shew themselves strangers to the right
meaning of the Scriptures, which have both a recondite
or spiritual, and also a literal or natural sense ; and they
who interpret them only according to the latter, must
mistake their true meaning in many places, particularly
in what is spoken therein concerning the Rich and the
Poor in relation to this subject ; as for instance, that it is
as impossible for the Rich to enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven, as for a camel to pass through the eye of a
needle ; but that it is easy for the Poor, as we are there
in told, that "their's is the Kingdom of Heaven," Luke
vi. 20, 21; whereas they who know any thing of the
spiritual sense of the Word, understand these sayings
very differently, being convinced on the authority there
of, that the Kingdom of Heaven is appointed for all who,
live the life of faith and love, whether they be Rich or
Poor ; and who they are that are meant by this distinc
tion in Scripture, shall be explained in what follows.
From much conversation and long abode with the An
gels, I know of a truth that the Rich find as ready admis
sion into Heaven as the Poor, and that no one is exclud
ed merely on account of his wealth, or received because
of his poverty in this world; both classes are there alike
and more of the Rich in the higher stations of bliss and
glory than ofthe Poor.

that a man may lawfully acquire riches, and increase his
store according to the opportunity afforded him, provid
ed he keep free from subtle devices, and every evil art ;
may eat and drink of the best, if he place no part of his
happiness therein ; may dwell magnificently, if accord
ing to his rank in life : converse like others upon com
mon worldly topics, and share in the public diversions ;
that there is no need of severity of behaviour, downcast
looks, and other appearances of mortification ; but he may
be pleasant and cheerful ; nor is under any other obliga

282 A treatise concerning
■a
may lay uporphim: in a word, that as to externals,he may
live in a common way like other orderly people, with
out any bar to his admission into Heaven, provided that
he inwardly cherishes a due reverence and fear of the
Lord, and acts justly and with all good conscience to
wards his neighbour; for every one's real character is to
be estimated according to his internal sentiments and
affections, or by his faith and love : for these are the prin
ciples that give life and character to all that proceeds from
him, as the life of the act is in the will, and the life of the
speech is in the sentiment; for as we act from the will,
so we speak from the thought ; and, th-.refore, where it
is said in Scripture, that every one shall be judged ac
cording to his deeds, and recompensed according to his
works, we are to understand
it,
as
if
it
were said, accord
ing to his thoughts and affections, from which his works
proceed, or which are in his works
;
for without the for
mer, the latter are of no consideration, and therefore re
ceive their quality and character from them. (229) Hence
we see that
it
is
not the exterior, but the interior, which
commands the exterior, that does all
in
man. To illus
trate this by the following instance
:
He that refrains from
defrauding another only through fear of the laws, and of
the loss he might otherwise suffer in his reputation or in
terest, and who but for such restraints would not scruple
to take all advantages of him in his power
;
such
a
one,
(229) That
it
often occurs in Scripture, that man shall be judged
and recompensed according to his deeds or works, n. 3934. By deeds
and works there, we are not to understand them as they appear in
the external form, but as they are in their root or inward principle
;
for even bad men do works apparently good
in
their external form,
but only, good men such as are both outwardly and inwardly good, n.
3934, 6073. That all mor:l deeds, as well as bodily acts, proceed
from man's inward faculties and powers, as his thinking and willing,
and owe their essence and qualities thereto
;
and therefore, accord
ing to the internal principle
is
the external production, n. 3934, 891
1,
10331
;
consequently, 'according to
a
man's love and faith, n. 3934,
6073, 10331, 10333; that therefore the works contain their principle,
or the principle itself in effect and operation, n. 10331. Therefore,
to be judged and recompensed accoi ding to our deeds and works,
is
the same as
if
spoken of the principles of our lives, n. 3147, 3934,
6073, 89

0331, 10333. That those works which have respect to
self, and the world, are not good works, but only such as respect the
Lord, and the good of our neighour, n. 3147.

however honest his dealings may appear outwardly, yet
is guilty of deceit and fraud in his thoughts and will, and
is governed by a principle from beneath \Jnfernum in se
hahet.\ On the other hand, the upright man, who re
frains from taking all undue advantages of another,

be contrary to his duty to God and his neighSour ; such

life in externals, may acquire riches, and live elegantly
according to his rank, as to good cheer, dress, and
dwelling ; carry on his worldly business like other men,
and take pleasure in the good things of this life, to the
comforting both of his body and mind, provided that he
lives in the true fear of God, and in love to his neigh
bour. As this is the case, it will not appear so difficult
a matter to get to heaven, as some imagine : (*) the
main difficulty lies in resisting the love of self and of the
world, that they gain not the victory over us ; as from
this quarter all our danger proceeds : (230) and that
otherwise our way is not so hard to make, as some sup
pose, we may learn from those words of our Lord ;
" Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and
" ye shall find rest unto your souls ; for my yoke is easy,
* It must be owned, that our Author here is far from shewing any
thing of the precisian, or of monastic rigour ; and yet his doctrine,
when taken along with the applied restrictions, is as far from giving
countenance to carelessness, or over indulgence ; and the danger he
subjoins that we are in from the love of self and of the world, and
whatever wrong habits we may have contracted thereby ,will be found
to minister to the best of us abundant matter for repentance, self-de
nial and watchfulness. Tr.

284- A treatise concerning
" and ray burden is light," Matt. xi. 29, 30. Now the
yoke of the Lord is easy, and his burden light, so far as
man renounces the evils flowing from the love of self and
of the world, for so far the Lord is his guide, and gives
him the mastery over them.
360. I have conversed with some afcer their decease,
who in this life abdicatedthe world,and betook themselves
to solitude, that they might be more at leasure for devout
exercises, as the safer way to Heaven : but such mostly
appear of a melancholy cast in the other world, lightly es
teem those ^that are not like themselves, and are dissatis
fied, through a supposed merit in themselves, that they
are not exalted to a higher state than others ; they have
little affection for others, and therefore are backward to
exercise those oflices of love, which is the bond of a hea
venly conjunction :
* they exceed, it is true, in an ardent
desire for Heaven, but when they are exalted to be with
the Angels, they carry with them a certain sadness that
damps the joys of the former ; wherefore they are disjoin
ed from them, and betake themselves to a kind of lonely
situations, where they lead a recluse life, as they did in
this world. Man can only be formed for Heaven in this
World, where his affections have their beginning ob
jects, but vanish and come to nothing, if not exercised in
social connections, or rather sre swallowed up solely in
self, to a total neglect of his neighbours so that a life of
charity towards our neighbour, consisting in a conscien
tious discharge of every relative and social duty, is the
pathway to Heaven; and not a mere speculative piety
separated therefrom ; (231) now action and not inaction,
is the vital support of charity, I shall here give an in
stance of this from experience ; I have known more in
the regions of bliss among those that have acquired rich
es in trade by an honest industry, than among such as
* Hitherto we are to understand them as in the intermediate state.

had become wealthy through the emoluments of high and
honourable offices in the state; as the latter are so liable
to be infected, on account of their honours and impor
tance, with the pride of life and love of the world, which
have a natural tendency to bi'get self-love, and conse
quently to alienate the affections from heavenly things.
361. The lot of the good Rich, when translated to
Heaven, is that of being in a condition of greater splen
dor than others ; some of them d»vell in stately palaces,
richly furnished and ornamented as with gold and silver,
together with abundance of all things ministering to the
delights of life ; however, they place no part of their af
fections on these things, but only on their uses ; of these
they take good notice, but the mere ornamental part, as
gold and silver, they regard with little attention, and that
because when in this world their minds were set on uses,
and they considered gold and silver only as means sub
servient thereto. Now uses in the other world appear in
splendid forms, the good of use as gold, and the true of
use as Silver ;
(232) and according to their practical uses
in this life, such is the splendor and such the delights
of their state in the following. Among the good uses,
are those of providing things needful for ourselves and
families suitably to our rank ; to seek the means of pro
moting the public good ; and also to have wherewith to
help our neighbour, which he that abounds can better do
than he that does not ; besides, that such a diligence to
procure what may be for the good of them that lack, pre-

gives our internate evil the power to take possession of
us. These are among the good uses, as far as they are
invigorated by a divine principle, or so far as man is ac
tuated therein by motives of duty to God, and regards
worldly means only as subordinate thereto.
362. But quite contrary is the lot of such Rich persons
in the other world, as lived without religious faith in this,
nay, hardened themselves in unbelief: all such are in hell,
where filth, misery, and want of every comfort, is their
portion ; for into these are Riches changed, when loved
for their own sake ; and not only their Riches, but also
the uses to which they applied them, such is their luxu
ry and self-indulgence for the gratification of their other
corrupt passions, or to evidence their pride and contempt
of others : Riches in stu h hands.having nothing but what
is earthly and vile in their use, become changed into vile-
ness at last. A spiritual use and application of Riches
is, as it were, a seasoning and preservative to them, and
may be compared to the soul in the body, or to the light
and heat of the sun in their effects on a humid soil ; but
in the other case, Riches may be considered as a body
without a sou| to preserve it from putrefaction ; or to a
swampy ground in a deep valley shaded from the light of
the sun : such are the men who suffer Riches to alienate
their heart from God.
363. Every one's darling affection or ruling passion
continues with him after his departure from this world,
nor is it extinguished in eternity ; * for the spirit of a
man is as the love that prevails in and possesses him ;
and, moreover, (which has hitherto been a secret on
earth) the body of every spirit and angel is the external
form of the love that presides in him, and corresponds to
the internal form of his mind and will, insomuch that
* It must here be observed to the reader, that a more concerning
doctrine, (:md highly credible it appears from scriptural authority) or
one that inf.-rs more important caution as to what affections and ha
bits we contract, cannot present itself to the mind of man ; and there
fore the subject of this particular number is warmly recommended
to his serious attention. Tr.

spirits know one another by their countenances, gestures,
and speech ; and by the same correspondent marks it
would be known what spirit a man is of in this world,
were he not accustomed to act the counterfeit in these
particulars ; the ruling passion would equally manifest
itself in time, as it does in eternity. I have conversed
with some that lived seventeen centuries ago, whose
lives are recorded in the writings of those days ; and
-they appeared to be governed by the same affections and
dispositions by which they are charactered therein : from
which we may gather, that the same love of riches, and
for the same ends, continues with, every one hereafter,
though with this difference, that the riches which had
been applied here to good purposes, are changed into
heavenly pleasures to the owners in the other world, ac
cording to their uses respectively ; and that the riches,
which had been applied here to bad purposes, become
changed to the owners into filth and corruption hereafter,
answerably to the evil uses they had made of them ; nay,
such nastiness they take pleasure in, as corresponding to
those filthy lusts to which they had made their riches
subservient, or to that sordid avarice which consists in the
love of riches, for their own sake ; for such passions are a
spiritual filthiness defiling the soul.
364. The Poor(are not qualified for Heaven by their
Poverty, but by their principles and life, for these fol
low every one, be he rich or poor, nor is there any dis
tinguishing mercy for the one more than the other ;
(233) but he is received whose life has been good, and
he is rejected whose life has been evil : besides, Poverty
may be turned into as great a snare and hinderance to a
man in his way to Heaven, as Riches themselves, seeing
that many of the poorer sort fall into discontent at their
condition, covet many things above their rank, and look
ing upon Riches as the greatest of blessings, (234)

grudge if they be not satisfied, and indulge murmurings
againsts God's providence ; add, to these, their envy ings
against others, their fraudulent practices, and gross sen
sual indulgences : how different will be the lot of these
from thatfof their sojourning in all godliness and honesty !
I have sometimes conversed in the othtr world with cer
tain departed peasants, who had lived here in the fear of
God and all good conscience, who having an affectionate
desire to know the truth, sought to be more particularly
instructed as to faith and charity, having heard much
concerning the former in this world, and more concerning
the latter in the other; on which it was told them, that
charity has respect to every thing belonging to life, and
faith to every thing belonging to doctrine; consequently,
that the former consists in willing and doing every thing
that is just and right, and the latter in thinking and be
lieving according thereto ; and that when any one wills
and does what he thinks and believes to be right and
good, then faith and charity are no longer two but one,
just as thought and will unite in forming a determinate
act of the mind : this they well understood and received
with pleasure, saying, that when in this world they did not
look upon believing as a thing different or separate from
living.
365. From what has been offered on this head, it will
appear, that the Pich may find as easy an admission into
Heaven as the Poor ; and the notion of its being more
difficult to the former as from a wrong understanding of
those plures in Scripture, where both are mentioned.
By the Rich there, in a spiritual sense, we are to under
stand such as abound in the knowledge of good and
truth, and accordingly those who are within the chufch
where the Word is known ; and by the Poor, such as are
destitute of that knowledge, but desire
it,
consequently
those who are without the church, and strangers to the
Scriptures. By the Rich Man clothed in purple and

190 A treatise concerning
camel, and the eye ofa needle, is not understood at this
day, because the key to that knowledge which explains
how spiritual things are signified by the liberal sense of
the Word, is not in the hands of the church ; for there is
both a spiritual and a natural sense throughout the Word,
it being written according to correspondency between
things natural and spiritual, to the end that there might be
an alliance between heaven and earth, and between angels
and men, since the time of their immediate communica
tion ceased. Thus we have shewed who are meant in
particular by the Rich in the Word, viz . such as abound
in the knowledge of good and truth, and that by the sev
eral kinds of this knowledge are meant the riches there
spoken of, as may be seen in the passages here referred
to, Isai. x. 12, 13, 14. ch, xxx. 6, 7. xlv. 3. Jer. xvii. 3.
xlvii. 7. 1. 36, 57. li. 13. Dan. v. 2, 3, 4. Ezek. xxvi.

that by the poor are meant those who have not the same
means of knowledge, but are desirous of them, see Matt,
xi. 5, Luke vi. 20. 21. xiv. 21. Isai. xiv. 30. xxix. 19.

the angels there are of both sexes ; and as by the order
of creation the woman is for the man, and the man for

well as on earth, though very different in Kind. Now
wherein they differ, and wherein they resemble each
other, shall be the subject of the following chapter. *
367. Marriage in heaven is the conjunction of two in
unity of mind, the nature of which shall here be explain
ed. The mind consists of two. parts, one of which is
called the Intellect or Understanding, and the other the
Will ; and where both these co-operate or act in union,
they form one mind. Now the Husband there represents
and exercises the intellectual part, and the Wife the pro
vince of the Will ; and when the interior union of both
manifests itself in the exterior or sensitive part, it is call
ed Conjugal Love ; whence it appears, that conjugal love
derives its origin from the conjunction of two in unity of
mind, and this is called in heaven Cohabitation, without
the idea of distinction of parties ; and, therefore, where
two are so united in Spiritual Marriage, they are not
called two, but one angel. (236)
368. That such is the proper conjunction and intimate
union of minds between Husband and Wife, is indicated
by their very formation, the man being formed more for
intellectual purposes, and of deeper thought ; but the
woman naturally to be led and actuated more by the mo
tions of the will. The like also seems denoted by the
particular genius and form of each respectively ; by the
genius, in that the talent of the Man consists more in the
exercise of reason ; that of the Woman in the display of
affection : and by the difference of form, in that Man has
a rougher and less comely aspect, a harsher speech, and
* The reader will have no reason to be offended at the title of this
chapter, when he is told, that the spiritual union here treated ofvun-
der the name of marriage, is quite of a different kind, both as to
means and end, from that marriage which our Lord declares to have
no place at the resurrection, as will evidently appear to him as he
proceeds. Tr.

will, or thought and affection ; and so also between truth,
and good, and faith and love ; for truth a id faith respect
the understanding, as good and love respect the will.
Hence it is, that in the/Word, by youth and many in a
spiritual sense, are meant the understanding of truth ;
and by virgin and woman, the affection of good ; and
likewise that the church, from its affection to good and
truth, is represented by and denominated Woman, and
also Virgin ; as likewise that all who are in the afftction
of good, are stiled Virgins ; thus in Apoc. xiv 4. (237)
369. What has been said above is not so to be under
stood, as if husband and wife were not each separately
endowed with understanding and will, but only that the
intellectual part has the ascendant in the former, and the
will part in the latter, and each is denominated from the
predominant property, though, strictly speaking, there
is no predominancy in the heavenly Marriages, because
the will of the wife is that of the husband, and the intel
lect of the husband is that of the wife, both willing and
thinking the same, and consequently of one mind: and
this union is the more close and intimate, as the will of
the wife joins itst-if to the intellect of the Husband, and
the intellect of the husband to the will of the wife, and
that more especially when they face each other ; for, as
has been said more than once, there is then a mutual
communication of thoughts and affections in the Heavens,
and more especially between husband and wife through

greater mutual affection. Thus much may suffice to ex
plain that conjunction of minds, which is the bond of-
Spiritual Marriage in the Heavens, and is the source of
Conjugal Love, viz. when each freely communicates
their spiritual good things to the other.
370. I have been told by the angels, that as for worth
as any two are conjoined in this bond of mental union, so
far are they advanced in conjugal love, and also in under
standing, wisdom, and happiness, and that because di
vine truth and good, from whence proceed all true un.
derstanding, wisdom, and happiness, have their ingress
into conjugal love, as their proper plane or ground,
wherein truth and good unite ; for as their is a conjunc
tion of intellect and will, so is there also of truth and
good, because the intellect is that which receives divine
truths, and is formed thereby ; and the will is that which
receives divine good, and also receives its form from it ;
for what a man wills, that is his good ; and what he re
ceives into his understanding, that appears to him as
truth ; and therefore it comes to the same, whether you
call it a conjunction of the intellect and will, or a con
junction of truth and good. The conjunction of truth*
and good constitutes an angel, and also his understanding,
wisdom, and happiness ; for according to such conjunc
tion is the degree of angelical perfection ; and, therefore,
as far as truth and good, or, which comes to the same,
as far as faith and love are conjoined in any angel, such
is his angelical character and excellence.
371. That a divine virtue proceeding from the Lord
is the influencing principle in true conjugal love, is be
cause the latter is derived from the conjunction of good
and truth; for, as was said above, it is all the same,
whether we call it the conjunction of intellect and will,
or the conjunction of good and truth ; now this conjunc
tion of gooO and truth derives its origin from the divine
love of the Lord towards all in heaven and earth. From
this divine love proceeds divine good, and divine good
is received, both by angels and men in divine truth as its
proper receptacle ; and, therefore, he, who is in no de
gree of divine truth, can receive nothing from the Lord

and from Heaven ; but as far forth as good and truth are
conjoined in any one, so far is he joined to the Lord and
Heaven. Such is the origin of true conjugal love, and
accordingly a fit plane or ground for the reception of the
divine influx ; and hence it is, that the conjunction of
good and truth is called in heaven the Celestial Marriage,
and that Heaven in Scripture language is compared to
and called Marriage ; and also that the Lord is called the
Bridegroom and Husband, and Heaven with the Church,
his Bride and Wife. (238)
372. Good and truth as conjoined in angel or man,
are not two, but one, because there the good is in the
truth, and the truth in the good ; this conjunction is as
when ar.y one thinks of what he wills, and wills what he
thinks of, for so the thinking and willing co-operate and
constitute one mind, the thought being the form to the
will, and the will as the essence and life of the thought;
and hence it
is,
that where two are joined together in
this spiritual Marriage, they are not called two in hea
ven, but one angel. In this sense are to be taken those
words of our Lord
:
" Have ye not read, that he who
" made them from the beginning, made them male and
" female
?
And said, For this cause shall
a
man leave
" father and mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they
" twain shall be one flesh
;
wherefore they are no more
" twain, but one flesh
;
wherefore what God hath joined
" together, let no man put asunder

all men cannot re-

it

the angels, and also the conjunction of good and truth ;
and by a man's being forbid to separate what God hath
joined together, we are to understand, that good is not
to be separated from truth.
373. Thus has been explained the origin of true Con
jugal Love, and shewed how it is first formed in the
minds of the parties, and thence descending to the cor
poreal part, is there sensibly experienced as love ; for
whatever is perceived in the bodily affections is derived
from man's spiritual part, viz. his understanding and
will, which constitute the spiritual man ; and though in
such descent it assumes a different form, yet it is similar
and consentaneous to its principle, just as the body acts
conformably to the direction of the soul, or as the effect
is obsequious to the efficiency of its cause, according to
what has been laid down in the two articles concerning
Correspondences.
374. I heard an angel describe true conjugal love, and
its celestial delights, as divine good and divine truth
from the Lord, so united in two persons, as to form in a
manner but one ; and he said, that every married pair in
Heaven was an instance of this heavenly love, forasmuch
as the good and truth in every one is his proper self both
in mind and body, seeing that the body is the express
image of the mind, as being formed after its likeness.
He inferred from hence, that a divine likeness is imagin
ed in two persons that are in true conjugal love, and con
sequently that they are a similitude of Heaven, as the
universal Heaven is divine gold and divine truth pro
ceeding from the Lord, and cosequently that the whole
of Heaven was represented in that love, together with
beatitudes and delights innumerable, which indefinite
term he expressed by a word that signifies myriads of my
riads. He expressed astonishment, that members of
the Christian church should continue such strangers to
this truth ; whereas that church is the Lord's representa
tive of Heaven on earth, and Heaven exhibits a complete
Marriage of good and truth. He likewise appeared ama
zed at adultery being more commonly practised within
than without the church, as the inordinate gratification of

*296 A treatise concerning
that passion in every spiritual view is the love of false"
joined with evil, and the pleasure of it of an infernal na
ture, being diametrically opposite to the delights of Hea
ven flowing from the love of truth conjoined with good.
375. Every one knows that two married persons, who
are in mutual love, have -m interior bond, as it is essen
tial to the true conjugal state that there be a union of
minds and affections, and according to the quality of these
such is the union, and consequently the love : now the
mind is intirely formed of the species of truth and good
that it has imbibed, for all things in the universe have
some relation to good and truth, and also to their con
junction ; wherefore the union of minds is according to
the quaiity and kinds of truth and good from which they
are tormed, and that is the mo^t perfect union where the
latter are pure and genuine. It is to be remarked here,
that there is no stronger sympathy than between truth and
good, and accordingly from this source it is that true con
jugal love deduces its origin :
(239) there is also a sym
pathy between false and evil, from which proceeds a love,
but of an infernal kind, and the end of which is Hell.
376. From what has been here said concerning the ori
gin of conjugal love, we may be able to pronounce who
tire in conjugal love, and who are not : now of the for
mer class arc all they, Who, through divine truths, attain
to divine good, conjugal love being only so far pure and
genuine, as the truths which are joined to the good are so:
and as all good in union with its truth, is from the Lord,
it follows, that no one can be in a state of perfect conjugal
love, unless he acknowledge the Lord and his Divinity,
ior otherwise the divine influence and presence are not
in the truths, which a man has, to sanctify and make
them divine.

377. From hence we may conclude, that they who
come under the predicament of false,* or opposite to
the truth [qui in jalsis,~]
more especially if from an evil
principle [in Jalsis ex malo,~\ cannot experience any thing
of true conjugal love, as their inward gate is shut against
the heavenly influx, and their external or natural part oc
cupied by false and evil, which through their close con
junction, from an infernal kind of Marriage ; some in
stances of which I have seen : they converse indeed to
gether, and ha^e external fellowship in lewdness ; but in
wardly hate one another beyond all description.
373. Neither can there be true conjugal love between
two persons of different religions, as the true of one
agrees not with the good of the other ; and two dissimi
lar arid discordant persuasions cannot consist with unani
mity, and therefore their love cannot be of spiritual ex
traction ; or if they cohabit and agree, such agreerhent
is the effect only of natural causes; (240) for this reason
Marriages in the Heavens are formed only of those who
belong to the same society, as being in good and truth,
of the same kind and quality : that all there of one and
* It is not easy to render our Author's meaning in this place intel
ligible to the common reader without a paraphrase, not only on ac
count of the difference of idioms in the two languages, but also with
respect to the conception of the matter. Thus where he speaks of
'
the false of evil, and the true of good, he not only uses those words
as substantives, which are adjectives in the English," but in a sense
which we have no substantives that fully express. Thus, the error,
falsehood, or falsity of evil, conveys not the idea meant ; but the
false of evil here signifies a contrariety to whatever is right and true,
proceeding from a disposition of mind or principle contrary to every
thing that is good, or a wrong understanding issuing from a perverse
will and depraved affections. Thus, the unconverted, natural man,
who loves only himself and the world, is an enemy to all spiritual
truth through the malignity of his nature ; and all that such a one
thinks, says, and does, is contrary to the divine order and will ; as
there is no divine love in his heart, there is no divine light in his mind
and understanding, but such a one is in spiritual darkness, or in the
false of (from) evil. Tr.

298 A treatise concerning
the fame society, are in like good and truth, and differ
from those of other societies, see above, n. 41, W seq.
This was represented among the Israelites by their mar
rying within their own tribes, and in particular into their
own families, and not with others.
379. Neither can there exist true conjugal love be
tween a husband and different wives at the same time, as
this counteracts the spiritual origin and end of Marriage,
which is the union of two minds, and consequently hin
ders the interior conjunction of good and truth, which is
essential to this love : now Marriage with more than one
wife is like an understanding divided into many wills, or
as a man that joins himself to different churches, whereby
his faith is so distracted, that it comes to nothing. The
angels declare, that to marry several wives is absolutely
contrary to the divine order, and that they are assured of
this many ways ; particularly from hence, that as soon as
they entertain any notion of such Marriages, they lose
their heavenly peace and joy, and become, as it were, in
toxicated through a separation between their internal good
and t -uth : and if their mental faculties become so dis
ordered through thinking with the least inclination on
polygamy, they conclude with the strongest convictions,
that the engagement itself would darken their minds, and
banish their joys, and that from a heavenly conjugal love
they should fall into a gross inordinate passion inconsistent
with the purity of celestial delights: (241) they say, that
t,241) As husband and wife should be one in the essential principles
.of life, and as they constitute one angel in Heaven, therefore true con
jugal love cannot subsist between one husband and different wives, n.
1907, 2740. That to have more wives than one at the same time is
contrary to the divine order, n. 10835. That marriage can only be be
tween two, evidently appears from those who belong to the Lord's ce
lestial kingdom, n. 865, 3246, 9902, 10172; and that because the an
gels of that kingdom are in the most intimate union of good and truth,
3346. That it was permitted to the Israelites to have more wives than
one at the same time, and also to keep concubines, but not so to Chris
tians; and the reason of the difference is because the former were only
in the externals of religion, but the latter are called to inward and
spiritual religion, and consequently to the internal marriage of good
wul truth, n. 2246, 4337, 8809.

Heaven and Hell. 299
it is difficult for men now o'days to form any conception
of this matter, as so very few have any experience of true
conjugal love, without which they must remain intire stran
gers to that inward satisfaction which results from
it,
whilst they experience nothing more than the gratification
of the sensual part, which in
a
little time changes into
disgust; whereas the spiritual delight of pure conjugal love
not only lasts even to old age in this world, but after death
makes
a
part of the joys of Heaven, where
it
is
exalted
to higher spirituality and perfection in eternity.
:
they
moreover said, that the beatitudes of truly spiritual con
jugal love might be reckoned up to many thousands, of
which not one was fully known by mortal man, nor can
i
be thoroughly experienced by any who are not in that state
of heavenly marriage, which consists in the union of good
and truth from the Lord.
380. Love of dominion
in
one of the married parties
over the other banishes true conjugal love and its heaven
ly
delight
;
forasmuch as the latter, as was observed be
fore, consists in conformity of wills on both sides by
mutual consent and choice, which the thirst of dominion
,
in the party aiming at government totally defeats, by ex
alting the will of self over that of the other, and obstruct-
ingthat tree and equal communication of love and its friend
ly
offices, in which the happiness of marriage consists
;
nay, so opposite
is
the lust of power and rule to every
thing that
is
celestial and spiritual in that state, as to ren
der the very mention of
it
ridiculous. Where one wills and
loves as the other dos, there
is
liberty in both, for liberty
is
the offspring of love
;
but where the spirit of governing
presides, all
is
servitude, for the party, who
is
instigated
by the desire of dominion,
is
a
servant to the imperious
passion. These things will not appear in their full evi
dence to such as are wholly strangers to the sweet liberty
that
is
in heavenly love
;
but enough has been said on this
subject to shew, that the exercise of dominion
is
so far
from uniting, that nothing tends more to divide minds
;
it
may indeed subdue, but
a
mind subdued or subjuga
ted,
is
either without
a
will of its own, or has an opposite
will;
if
it
has no will,
it
consequently has no love

an opposite will, the passion that prevails in it is hatred
and not love ; and such married persons as are in this con
dition and character, are all at strife and war within, how
ever they may smooth over their behaviour towards one
another with an external decency for the sake peace. This
inward hostility manifests itself in the other world, where
thev attack each other with fury and open violence when
they meet, as I can testify from having been a spectator
of their quarrels and vindictive rage, as in the interme
diate state every one appears outwardly what he is inward
ly, being free from those restraints and motives to save
appearances, by which they regulate their behaviour in
this world.
381. We have indeed instances of apparent conjugal
love in some, but without the reality, if they are not in the
love of good and truth; and it is not unusual to counter
feit this appearance from various motives, as for example,
that the parties may live quietly and at ease in their fami
lies, may be properly accommodated in sickness and old
age, or that the children they are fond of may be duly ta
ken care of; some practise an affectionate behaviour
through fear of the other party, through regard to charac
ter, to prevent bad consequences, and in some cases on
account of natural passion. Conjugal love has also its
different degrees in married persons ; some have it in a
higher, and some in a lower degree, nay, one may be in a
disposition for
it,
and the other in none at all; and under
such difference, Marriage may be to one as Heaven, and
to the other as Hell.
382. The most perfect conjugal love
is
in the inmost
Heaven, as the angels there are most highly graduated
in conjoined truth and good, and also in innocence
;
the
angels of the inferior Heavens are also (according to their
degree in innocence) in pure conjugal love, which, con
sidered in itself,
is
a
state of innocence, and attended with
heavenly delights, whilst the blessed pairs, from an infan
tile simplicity of disposition, receive pleasure from all
that they see, and give pleasure in all that they do
;
for a
heavenly virtue tinctures all things to them
:

ed by a virgin of exquisite beauty, girt about, as it were,
with a white cloud ; and it was told me, that all the angels
derive their beauty from conjugal love, that all the par
ticular affections and sentiments, that issued from this
source, were represented by adamantine atmospheres in
termixed with carbuncles and rubies, exciting sensations
that penetrated even to the mental affections. In a word,
Heaven represents itsell by conjugal love, and that be
cause the Conjunction of good and truth in the angels con
stitutes Heaven, and the same conjunction constitutes
the essence of true, spiritual, conjugal iove.
382. Marriage in the Heavens differs from Marriage
on earth, and herein more particularly, that the latter is in
stituted for the procreation of children, whereas the end
of heavenly marriages is the procreation or multiplication,
of good and truth, in the conjunction or union of which
such marriages consists ; and as the love of good and
truth is the bond of
it,
so are these the fruit of
it
;
hence
it
is, that
by
births and gene.ations in the Word, we are
to understand such as are spiritual, viz. of good and truth;
by father and mother, truth conjoined with good as the
propagating principles
;
by sons and daughters, the truths
and goods propagated
;
and by sons and daughters in-law,
the conjunc.ions of thvse, and so on. (242)
It
is
evident
from hence, that Marriages in the Heavens are very diffe
rent from Marriages on earth, the former being spiritual,
and not so properiy called Nuptials, as Conjunction of
minds through the union of good and truth

led husband and wife ; but each other's partner [coniiix~\
is named (from an idea in the angels of two minds united)
by a term answering to his or her natural, or second self.
What has been here said, may lead us to the true meaning
of those words of our Lord concerning Marriage, Luke
xxi. 35, 36.
383. It has been given me to see how Marriages are
contracted in the Heavens : now it must be observed,
throughout Heaven, such as are of like dispositions and
qualities are consociated into particular fellowships ; and
such as differ in these respects are dissociated or separated,
so that every society in Heaven consists of similar mem
bers ; and these are brought together by the Lord, and not
through their own seeking; see above n. 41, 43, 44, &?
seq. In like manner the husband and wife are brought
together, being such whose minds are capable of union
with each other, on which they love each other with
mutual cordiality at first sight, immediately perceive
their appointed union, and enter into Marriage : thus all
Marriages in Heaven are from the Lord only : they also
celebrate a festival on the occasion in the presence of ma
ny ; these festivals differ in different societies.
.384. As Marriages in this world are the seminaries of
mankind, and also of future angels, (for, as was observed
under its proper article, Heaven is peopled by the human
race) and being according to the true institution of them a
spiritual origin, through the conjunction of good and
truth, and the divine blessings on pure conjugal love ; on
these accounts they are considered as holy by the angels ;
and, on the other hand, they look upon adultery, the op
posite to conjugal love, as profanation ; whilst they be
hold in one the image of Heaven, through the conjunc
tion of good and truth therein, and in the other the image
of Hell, through the conjunction offalse with evil ; where
fore, on the very naming of adultery, they turn their backs
in token of aversion: from this contrariety in it to every
thing sacredj it comes to pass, that the gate of Heaven is
shut against the adulterer, the consequence of which is

his turning infidel, and renouncing the faith of the'church.
(243) That all in Hell are enemies to conjugal love, was
given me to perceive by an impression on my mind by
the sphere exhaling thence, which seemed as a continued
effort to dissolve and violate the marriage bond ; denoting
thereby, that the ruling passion in Hell is that of adul
tery, and consequently, an enmity to the union of good
and truth, which is the foundation of Heaven. From
which we may conclude, that the gratification of this in
ordinate passion is nothing short of an infernal pleasure,
and diametrically opposite to the innocent satisfaction of
pure conjugal love, which is a heavenly pleasure.
38*,. There were on a time, certain spirits, who from
a practised behaviour in this life, followed me with an
over officious sedulity, and with an air of softness that
resembled the humility of good spirits; but by the influx
from their spheres, I could perceive fallacy and guile
within. At length I entered into conversation, with one
of them, who, 1 found, had been a commanding military
ofBcer, and as I discovered something of the libertine in
his ideas, I turned the discourse to the subject of Marri
age, in that way of spiritual conversation which is by re
presentatives, equally expressive with any other, and
much more copious, though laconic; and he told me, that
in this world he had made light of adultery: I had the
freedom to tell him, that adultery was abominable, what
ever pains they who were guilty of that sin might take
to reason themselves into a persuasion of its lawfulness,
and that he might know this from marriage being the se
minary of the human race, and also of the celestial king

berty ; for all liberty proceeds from love, and the high
est degree of itfrom conjugal, which is also celestial love;
but the progression of adulterous love is by inverse de
grees towards Hell, and so on to the lowermost Hell,
where all is dire and horrible: such is the lot ofadulter

who take delight in the gratification of this sinful passion,
but have no relish for the innocent delights of pure
conjugal affection.
OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ANGELS IN
HEAVEN.
387. THE Functions of the angels in Heaven cannot
be enumerated or described in particular; and therefore,
being- indefinite and various according to the different of
fices and services of the several societies, we can only
sprak of them in a general way. Every society has its
particular offices, for they are all distinct according to
their peculiar excellencies and species of good, (see
above, n. 41.) and consequently according to their uses;
for that only is considered as good by all in Heaven
which is good by operation aad act; there every one
performs good offices; for the Lord's kingdom is the
kingdom of Uses. (244)
388. There are different Administrations in the Hea
vens as well as on earth, viz. Ecclesiastial, Civil, and,
Domestic : of the first has been spoken in the article
(244) That the kingdom of the Lord is the kingdom of uses, n. 453,
696, 1103, 3645, 4054,7038. That to serve the Lord is to do uses,
n. 7038. That all in the other world are appointed to usefulness. n»

what manner, n. 696. That all have their character and denomination

30(? A treatise concerning
concerning Divine Worship, n. 221 to 227; of the se
cond, in the chapter concerning Governments in Hea
ven, n. 213 to 220; and of the last, in the chapter con
cerning the Habitations and Mansions of tlv Angels, n.
183 to 190: and also in the last chapter concerning
Marriages in Heaven, n. 366 to 386 ; all which make
appear, that there are several functions and administra
tions established in every one of the heavenly societies.
389. Ail things in the Heavens are instituted accord
ing to D'vine Order, which is preserved throughout by
the administrations of Angels ; those things which relate
to more general good or use, by the Angels who are
most eminent for wisdom ; and such as are of more pri
vate or particular consideration, by those which are less
eminent, and so on ; all in subordination, to Divine Or
der according to their uses respectively ; and hence it
follows, that to every angelical office is annexed a dignity
according to the dignity of its use; however, the Angel
assumes not the honour to himself, but as^gns it to the
use, and as the use- is the same with the good which he
administers, and all good is from the Lord, therefore to him
he ascribes all the praise : nay, were any disposed to ap
propriate to himself any part of the honour, he would
thereby disqualify himself for any high office in Heaven,
as seeking his own glory more than the use of his office,
and the honour of God. By use here is to be understood
the Lord, seeing as was said before, use signifies the same
as good, and all good proceeds from him.
390. From what has been said a judgment may be for
med concerning the nature of subordination in Heaven
End how every one there not only loves, esteems, and
honours tl(e good use of administrations, but also the in-
'strumeiits empldyed in conducting them, and that in pro
portion to their humility and gratitude in giving glory to
the Lord in that behalf ; for in proportion thereto is their
wi;dom, and the extent of their usefulness ; and as spir-
tual love, estimation, and honour respect the use, so the
honour ot the person ministerng it arise thence. (^.45) He

also that considers men by the standard of spiritual truth,
forms his judgment according to the same rule: he sees one
man resembling another, whether in a higher or lower
degree of office anddignity, and estimates the difference
only by the difference of wisdom that is in him, viz. the
wisdom of loving usefulness, whether for the good of his
fellow-citizen, or his society, his country ,or the church he
is of. In this exercise of uses consists our love to the Lord,
from whom proceeds all the good that is in uses; and also
our love to our neighbour,whose real good and benefit is
to be the object of of our love and beneficence, whether
"
considered under the character of fellow-citizen, or the
complex relation of society, country or church.
391. All the societies in the Heavens are distinct [or
distinguished] according to the administration of uses
therein, in the same manner as they are distinguished ac
cording to their respective goods, (kinds of good ) and
those goods are actual, or goods of charity, as observed
above, n. 41. et seq. or, in Other words, good of uses : thus
some societies arc appointed to the charge of infants; o-
thersto instruct and educate them till they are grown up :
there are particular societies instituted for the improve
ment of such young persons of both sexes as have been
prepared for Heaven in this world by a virtuousand pious
education ; and others to form for Heaven such as are well
disposed,but ignorant: some of whose officeitis to instruct
those that are from the various Heathen nations: some to
receive the novitiate spirits, or such as are newly arrived
from this world, and to defend them against all assaults
from evil spirits: some also there are.whose designation is

respecting the principle, love good and evil alike, n. 3820. That

Lord, is our neighbour, and that to do good thereto from the love

308 A treatise concerning
to minister to those who are detained for a while in the
lower earth : some,\vhose province it is,by turns,to preside
as overseers in the infernal kingdom, to restrain the evil
spirits from tormenting one another beyond due measure,
and lastly, some are appointed to the care of those who
are raised from death. (246) In general, the Angels of
every society are employed about men, in order to pre
serve and lead them from evil affections, and the thoughts
which they are apt to excite in their minds ; and toCinspire
them with good affections, as far as they can receive
them consistently with free will ; and hereby they guide
and influence tf)eir works or actions, and bend their in
clinations from evil, as far as may stand with the nature
of free agents. The Angles, whilst they arejpresent with
men, reside, as it were, in there affections, and are nearer
to or further from them, according to the degree of good
life from true doctrines ; but all these administrations are
from the Lord through the Angles, which act only as
his instruments therein. Hence it
is,
that by angles, in
the inmost sense of the Word,
io
meant some attribute or
operation of the Lord, and also that the Angels in Scrip
ture are called Gods. (247)
392. The forementioned are the common functions of
the Angels
;
but besides these, every Angel has his charge
or office in particular
;
for every common or general use
is
compounded of innumerable others, which are called
mediate, ministering, or attendant uses
;

which, whether co-ordinate or subordinate, are accord-

perfect the common use or common good.
393. They who love the Word in this world, and stu
diously investigated the truths therein, nor for honour or
secular advantage, but for purposes of practice and good
life, both with respect to themselves and others ; such
are those who are appointed to the Ecclesiastical Func
tions in Heaven, and according to the degree of such their
pious pursuit, is their illumination and wisdom from the
Word in the Heavens, the sense of which there is not
natural, as in this world, but wholly spiritual ; see above,
n. 259. These exercise the offices of preachers, and ac
cording to the established laws of Divine Order, excel in
eminence of rank and dignity, as they are superior to
others in divine illumination. As to matters of civil ad
ministration, they constitute the province of such as in
this world loved their country, and preferred the good of
it to their own private advantage, doing that which is just
and right from affection snd principle : as far as these
took, pleasure to improve their minds in the knowledge
of the laws of justice and equity, in such degree are they
qualified for offices- in the heavenly societies, which they
administer, each according to his intellectual abilities,
which are in proportion to the degree of their affectionate
zeal for the common good. In a word, the offices, admi
nistrations, and employments in Heaven are innumerable,
and far exceeding those that are to be found in this world,
and all that are concerned therein take delight to be so en
gaged from their love of usefulness ; where no one is
actuated by selfish or lucrative motives, or under the
temptation of anxious care for the needful accommoda
tions of life, as these are all ministered to them grutuit-
-ously, as suitable habitations, vestments, food, conveni
ent, &c. From all which it follows, that they who have
loved self and the world above usefulness, have no place
nor portion in Heaven ; for the ruling passion or affec
tion, which has taken possession of the heart of any one
in this world, follows him in the next, nor is it cxtirpa-
ted to all eternity ; see above, n. 363..

310 A treatise concerning
394. Every one in Heaven is in his office according to-
Correspondence ; but this Correspondence respects not
merely the outward office or act, but its use and tenden
cy; see above, n. 112; and there is a Correspondence,
in all things, n. 106. He, who in Heaven is in any
Function or work corresponding to its use, is in a similar
state of life to that which appertained to him in the body,
(for things spiritual and natural are the same by Corres
pondence) with this difference, that there his delight in
good is more interior and central, answerably to his spi
ritual life, which is more receptive of heavenly joy. *
OF THE JOYS AND HAPPINESS OF HEAVEN.
395. FEW or none at this time have any conception
of Heaven, and the joys and Happiness thereof; nay,
the ideas of those, who have excercised their minds
most on these subjects, are very gross or next to none :
I had the best opportunity of knowing this from the
spirits, whoh.-id newly been translated from this world to
the other, and which, left to themselves, think as they
had done before. Now this ignorance in man concern
ing the Joys of Heaven arises from their conceiving
them to be similar to the outward gratifications of the
natural man in this world, and from their having no no
tion of the inward and spiritual man, nor of what con
stitutes the Happiness of his condition, insomuch, that
were anyone to describe to them such spiritual delights
from his own experience of them, the description could
take no hold of their gross material ideas, nor excite any
perception in their minds of what was told them, but be
immediately rejected by them : and yet it is rational to
(*) Thcreis sone difficulty in oo Tv>rchciulingthc sense of our Au-
iher in this passage, which seems to be as follows, viz. the interior
htatc of a good man on earth has its corresponding state in Heaven,
though the sweet relish and delectable sensations of it is different in
these different kingdoms : thus the love of God and the peace of
God are the same divine affections in the soul in both worlds, yet their
beatitudes can only be fully experienced in the angelical state, as free
from the imperfections and impurities of animal nature. Tr.

conclude, that when any man is divested of the external
or natural part of his composition, he must wholly enter
upon that which is internal and spiritual, and conse
quently, that his Pleasures and Joys must be of the same
nature with himself, and if inward and spiritual, so ne
cessarily more pure and refined, in order to be suitably
accommodated to the condition of a soul or spirit. This
may serve to evince, that what his spirit took delight in
here must constitute the delight of his spirit hereafter;
as to the corporeal gratifications of our nature, being of
the earth earthly, they can makje no part of a heavenly
state ; but the things of the spirit of a man follow him
into the other world, where he lives spiritually.
396. All Pleasures flow from love as their only source,
for what any one loves, that is pleasant to him; conse
quently, according to the kind of love, such is the Plea
sure it yields: all corporeal or sensual Pleasures issue
from the love of self, and the love of the world, from
which proceed all kinds ofconcupiscence and voluptuous
ness ; but all true delights of the soul or spirit originate
from love to God, and love to our neighbour; and trom
these sources are derived our affections for good and
truth, and out most satisfying interior Pleasures. These
two loves, with their concomitant pleasures, proceed by
influx from the Lord, and form Heaven by internal ema-
tion from above, and affect the inmost recesses of the
soul ; but the former spurious loves, with their pleasures,
issue from the carnal part, and from the world outwardly,
or from beneath, and affect the exterior senses. As far
therefore as the two heavenly loves before-mentioned
are received and affect us, so far the inward gate of the
soul or spirit stands open to the divine influences; and as
far as the other two spurious loves are received and affect
us, so far the outward gate of the bodily senses open
to this world and its evil influences : and as these differ
ent kinds of love gain admission into our hearts, so also
do their respective pleasures, those of Heaven into the
inward, and those of the world into the outward man;
for, as was said before, every pleasure is attendant on its
parent love.

3 1 2 A treatise concerning
397. Heaven is so constituted, as to abound with Plea
sures ; insomuch that, considered in itself, it is an aggre
gate of Beatitudes and Delectatibns-; and that because
divine good, proceedingfrom the love of the Lord, consti
tutes Heaven both in the general, and also in particular,
in every one there: now it is the property of Divine
Love, to will th^ Salvation and Happiness of all, and
that intimately and fully ; so that whether you say Hea
ven, or the Joys of Heaven, it comes to one and the same
thing.
393. The Pleasures of heaven are unutterable, astbey
are- innumerable ; but innumerable as they are, no man
that is absorbed. in carnal and sensual gratifications can
have the least notion of any one of them, and that because
as was said before, all his receptive faculties are turned
backward from Heaven to this world, and consequently,
being immersed in the love of self and of the world, he
is incapable of taking pleasure in any thing but the ho
nours and riches of this world, or in sensual gratifications;
whereas these things do, as it were, extinguish or suffo
cate all sense of the refined Pleasures of Heaven, even
so far as to render the reality of them incredible ; such
a one would be ready to wonder, were you to tell him
that there are Pleasures, of which honours and riches
make no part ; and still more, should it be affirmed, that in
Heaven there is an endless variety of Delights, to which
the most splendid enjoyments ofthis world, added to the
highest gratifications of sense, are not worthy to be com
pared: how can it seem strange, that persons of so gross
an apprehension should be unable to form any notions
of celestial happiness !
399. Something of an estimate may be made concern
ing the superlative Felicity in Heaven from the follow
ing single consideration, viz. that it constitutes part of the
Plappiness of Angels, to communicate their joy* to one
another; and as all of them pre like minded in this
matter, how jovous must be the effect ! seeing, as was
said above, n 268, in the Heavens there is a mutual com
munication bet ween one and all ; and this results, as was
said before, from the twofold love that prevails there ;

which are of a communicative nature. Now love to the

and all who love him partake of his Spirit, which is the
bond of communion and communication in his holy an
gels; and that love toward their neighbour is of like
tendency and effect, will appear from what follows;
though what has already been offered may suffice to in
dicate the natural tendency of these loves in those that
possess them, to communicate Of their best things: but
it is far otherwise wich respect to the love of self and the
love of the world; for the former of these is a greedy
desire of enriching self at the expence of others, and
therefore draws all to
it,
seeking only its own things;
whilst the love of the world grudges to others the share
they possess of
it,
thinking that themselves can never
have enough; so that these two loves are destructive of
all pleasant and friendly communication; or where such
persons do communicate to others,
it
is
for their own
sakes, and that
it
may some way or other redound to
their own profit or pleasure
:
that this
is
the case,
I
have
had frequent experience when in company with spirits,
who had been addicted to these loves whilst they lived
in the body, always finding my pleasant frames to de
part from me upon the first approach of such
;
and
I
have
also been told, that when they draw nigh to any angeli
cal society, the members of
it
feel
a
diminution of their
joy according to the nearness of their approach; and
what
is
no less strange, that the evil spirits on their part
receive
a
proportionable increase of pleasure
:
hence we
may know, that the state of anyone's spirit, after its se
paration from the body,
is
similar to what
it
was upon
leaving
it
;
and that those here spoken of have the same
covetous desire for the goods ofothers in the other world
that they had in this, and take the same pleasure
in
pro
curing to themselves the possession of them: and
it
may
be farther observed from what has here been said, how
destructive of heavenlv joys the love of self and of this

world are and consequently how contrary to the loves
of that blessed kingdom, the essential property of which
is to be communicative.
400. It is here to be noted concerning those who are
under the dominion of the love of self and the love of
the world, that the pleasures they feel on their approach
to any of the heavenly societies, is the pleasure of their
own evil concupiscence, and directly opposite to every
celestial delight, and that such pleasure proceeds from
depriving others ofthat heavenly joy: but when no such
deprivation takes place, the case is quite otherwise with
them, for then they dare not advance a step towards
them, or if they should, they would be sure to suffer
great perturbation and anguish, and therefore they sel
dom have the boldness to come near them : and as I
have often had experience of this, I shall here relate some
thing by way of instance. There is nothing which
spirits newly arrived in the other world more earnestly
desire then their immediate admission into Heaven: this
is the case with almostall, supposing that to be in Heaven
isno otherthan to be introduced andrcceived into a certain
place; and accordingly, pursuant to their longing, they
are conducted to some society in the first or lowest Hea
ven. Now as soon as they who are in the love of self
and of the world approach to the entrance of Heaven,
they begin to feel such internal pains and anguish as to
find a Hell instead of a Heaven within them, and
therefore precipitate themselves thence, without being
at rest till they join company with their fellows in Hell.
•It often happened, that some of this class had a longing
desire to experience something of the Joys of Heaven,
and upon being told that these were only experienced in
the sensations of the angels, they desired communication
with them, which was granted; for what any spirit,
which is not yet in Heaven or Hell, desires, is readily
granted, if it may be ot any use; now upon such com
munication being opened between them and the angels
they felt such agonizing pains, that they could not con
tain themselves, bending their heads down to their feet,
rolling on the ground, and twisting themselves into

various forms, like so many serpents, through the anguish
they felt within. Such effects had the heavenly sensa
tions of the angels, when communicated to those, whose
souls were immersed in the love of self and of the world,
such corrupt concupiscences beingquite contrary to those
pure affections, which are the inmates of angels : when
one opposite acts upon another, the effect is violence and
strife ; and thus the celestial virtues of the angels, operat
ing on the evil qualities of the other party, occasioned
the violent disorder within them, which produced those
contortions and conflicts.- The cause of this contrariety,
as assigned before, is, that they who are influenced by
the divine graces of the love of God, and charity towards
their neighbour, are liberal and communicative of what
they have
;
whereas they who are under the dominion
of those evil passions, the love of self and the love of the
world, are grudging and greedy of what belongs to
others
:
hence
it
is
that Heaven and Hell are not only
separate, but opposite to each other. Now all in the latter
are such as in this life abandoned themselves to temporal
and carnal gratifications from the love of self and the
love of the world: and all in the former, such as here
took delight in spiritual things from love to the Lord,
and love to their neighbour; and consequently, as their
loves were opposite, so are the kingdoms to which there
belong, insomuch, that were they who are in the hellish
kingdom to extend but
a
finger beyond the sphere of
it,
they would suffer pain thereby. This
I
have often been
witness to.

into horrors, signified by the name of Hellfire, and alter
nately into such kinds of nastiness and filth, as correspond
to those impure gratifications, in which (however strange
it may be thought) he takes pleasure ; but that which, as ob
served before, was no more than an inward, secret, and ob
scure satisfaction in those who were in the love of God
and of their neighbour, is then changed into clear percep
tion, and joyous sensations; and what was before" a hidden,
though spiritual root of blessedness, does, in their mani
fested state of spiritual life, bring forth the pleasant fruit
of spiritual delights.
402. All the pleasures of heaven are connected with
and inseparable from uses, these being the good fruits of
love and charity in the Angels ; and according to the qua
lity of the uses, and their alacrity to perform them, is the
degree of their joy : that this is so, may be illustrated by
comparison with the five bodily senses in man, each of
which derives its pleasure from exercise and use; the
sight from beholding beautiful objects; the hearing from
harmonious sounds ; the smelling from odoriferous scents,
and the taste from food of good savour ; and the uses
which they severally perform by their respective offices
are well understood by those that attentively consider
them, more especially if they are acquainted with their
correspondent relations in respect to the intellectual and
animal economy ; thus, the pleasure annexed to seeing,
is from its subservient usefulness to the understanding,
which is the internal sight of the mind ; and the pleasure
of hearing from the service it ministers to the intellect
and will, by hearkening, in order to obedience :
(*) the
sense of smelling has its pleasure from the refreshment
and aid it yields to the brain and lungs; the taste, from
its Lse in supplying the stomach with food for the nou
rishment of the whole body ; and the touch, considered
* Obedience is signified by hearkening in many places of the Sa-
credWritings ; thus in particular, Acts iv. 19. " Whether it be right
to hearken unto you more than to God, judge ye." To hear likewise
has the same signification, not only in Scripture language, but also
in many other writings: thus, A'eqtic audit currus habenag. Virg.

gation of the human species, and thereby providing a
seminary for celestial inhabitants. All these pleasures
with innocence are communicated to the senses by influx
from the heavenly world, where every delight has its
use, and is in proportion to its degree of use.
403. Certain spirits, from a notion they had entertain
ed in this world, fancied that the happiness of Heaven
consisted in a life of ease and indolence', and being ser
ved in all things by others; but it was told them; that no
society could subsist happily m such a state, and that
where all were to be served, there could not be any to
serve ; moreover, that a life of idleness would render
them stupid and good for nothing ; that action was es
sential to felicity, and rest only the means of fitting them
the better for it : they were likewise given to understand
that the life of angels principally consisted in doing of
fices of love and use, and that it was their highest de
light to be so employed : and then to make them asham
ed of so absurd a notion, as that of happiness in Heaven
consisted in everlasting indolence, there was given them
a perception of such a state, by which it appeared to
them most irksome and melancholy, and such as would
not only be destructive of every joy, but in a little time
be^attended with disgust and loathing.
404. Some spirits, which thought themselves wiser
than their fellows, had conceived an opinion in this
World, that heavenly joy consisted altogether in praising
and worshipping God, and that this constituted the ac
tive life of angels ; but it was told them that God needed
not their praises and worship, but willed rather that they
should mostly be employed in performing offices of use
and love to one another ; but this they considered more
as a task of servitude than true happiness, although the
asgels assured them, that it was a most free and delight
ful employment, as proceeding from the most affection
ate good will, and which they executed v> ith unspeak
able pleasure.

318 A treatise concerning
and all celestial spirits one and the same Heaven ;
whereas there is an endless variety in both, neither is one
Hell or one Heaven quite similar to another, as there
ure no two men, spirits, or angels, that exactly resemble
each other, not even in the face ; and when I went about
to figure to my Imagination two such exactly the same,
the angels seemed to shudder at
it,
telling me, that eveiy
whole was formed by the harmonizing consent of many
different parts, and that as was th; harmony or agree
ment of the component parts, such was the aggregate
or whole
;
and that in this manner every society in
Heaven, was one body formed of several different indivi
duals, and the universal complex of Heaven was formed
of all the different societies, and that the bond of their
union was love from the Lord. (248) Uses in the Heavens
have also their like variety and diversity, no two of them
being exactly similar or the same, nor yet the pleasures
resulting from them, though to every use belong innu
merable pleasures and though all different, yet so orderly
disposed and connected as to harmonize together, like the
uses of every member, organ, and bowel
in
the human
body, nay which
is
still more, of every vessel and fibre
in each member, organ, and bowel, which are so won
derfully adjusted, as to co-operate with their associates,
and perform their distinct offices one in all, and all
in
every one
;
whilst separately, yet conjunctly, they form
one regular system of complicated uses without the least
confusion or disorder.
406.
I
have sometimes conversed with spirits newly
come from this world concerning their eternal state, ob
serving to them, that
it
nearly concerned them to know
(248) That every whole consists of various different parts, from
which
it
receives its form and quality; and according to the harmony
and consent of its component parts, is the degree of its perfection, n.
457,3241,8003. That there
is
an infinite variety in the works of
God, alid no two things exactly alike, n. 7236, 9002. The same
holds true in the Heavens, n. 5744, 4005, 7236, 7833, 7836, 9002.
Hence, that all the societies in the Heavens, and every angel in each
society, have their distinct characters, and their different kinds and
degrees as to good and use, n. 690,3241, 3519 —7236, 7833, 3986.

and makes them to be as one man, n. 457, 3986, 5598.

if
such, as travelled into

try in this world considered
it

it
was of still greater importance to them to be inform

now were, and wherein they were to live for ever
:
that
therefore they were to know, that the Lord of glory was
the king of Heaven, and also the supreme Governor of
the universe, and therefore that they were his liege sub

and moreover, that the laws of his kingdom were
eternal truths founded on that universal indispensible law
of loving the Lord above all things, and their neigbour
as themselves
;
nay, what was still more, that now,
if
they would be as the angels, they ought to love their

on hearing which they
were struck dumb
:
for though
in

possibly have heard of such
a

nay, that
it
was possible for any one to love
his neighbour better than himself: but they were inform
ed that all kinds of good became immensely increased in
the other world, and though in this life few, through the
imperfection of human nature, could go farther than to
love their neighbour as themselves, as being here sub
ject to corporeal affections
;
yet on their removal from
these impediments, true love became more pure and ex
alted, even to an angelical standard, which
is
to love
their neighbour more than themselves, and to esteem
it
their happiness to do good to others without seeking- their
own good, unless for the sake of their neighbour^ that
he may receive the benefit of
it
by communication
:
and
that this was properly to love their neighbour better than
themselves
:
and with respect not only to the possibility,
but also to the reality of such love, they were told, that
many convincing proofs might be brought from exam
ples in this world: thus, in the conjugal state, where

other; nay, even in decent and polite company, where
such kind of love h only imitated, how common is it for
p!e of good breeding to offer preference, and the best
things to others, from mere civility and shew of greater
respect ; and lastly, they were told, that it was of the
very essence and nature of true love to do all kind offices
to the objects of
it,
not from selfish views, but from dis
interested affection. But notwithstanding the force of
these arguments, they who were deep in the love of self,
and had been greedy of filthy lucre in this world, could
not receive such doctrine, and the covetous least of all.

A
certain spirit, who, in the life of the body, was
in
high power, and still retained the love of command,
was told, that his authority was now at an end, he being
in
a
very different kingdom, where every one's estimation
was only according to the good and truth that was in him,
and from the mercy of the Lord, who had translated him
thither; and
it
was moreover told him, that the country
to which he now belonged had indeed this in common
with the world he came from, that riches and the favour
of the prince conferred pre-eminence
;
but then
it
was to
be remembered, that good and truth were the only rich
es there accounted of; and that the favour of the prince
Mas no other than the Lord's mercy to those who had been
faithful stewards of the grace they had received Irom him

consequently the greatest, for the Lord is to him both
strength and wisdom ; and what means greatest but hap
piest, or what do the mighty propose by their power, or
the rich by their riches, but to be happier than others ?
Moreover, it was told them, that it made no part of hea
venly happiness to desire to be the least, in order thereby
to be the greatest, for that was aspiring after grandeur ;
but that it consisted in heartily wishing better to others
than to themselves, and in doing them the best services for
their own sak.es with a disinterested love.
409. What heavenly Joy is, in its essence, will not
admit of description, as being seated in the inmost prin
ciples cf life in the angels, from which it diffuses itself
into all their thoughts and affections, and thence into eve
ry thing they say and do : it is as if the secret recesses of
their souls were wide open to the divine influence, in or
der to give it free admission into every fibre of their spi
ritual bodies, thereby to excite perceptions and sensa
tions of delight surpassing the power of expression : for
what takes its rise in the center, is propagated through
all the derivations from it to the circumference, or exter
nal parts. The good spirits, which have not as yet been
received into Heaven, nor consequently entered into this
Joy, are even transported at the sensation of
it,
when
communicated to them
by
the efflux or sphere of love is?-
suing from any angel, as
is
sometimes granted to those
who have an earnest desire to taste of heavenly Joy.
410. Certain spirits, on
a
time, were anxious to feel
something of this Joy, and accordingly they were per
mitted to taste as much of
it
as they were able to bear
;
and though the quantity communicated to them was so
extremely small, as scarcely to deserve the name of ange
lical, yet they deemed
it
to be highly celestial, as being
superlative with regard to their sensations; which con-
vinced me, not only that there are many degrees in hea
venly Joy, but also, that what
is
the highest degree to
one scarcely equals the lowest degree in another
;
and
also, that every one has his limited or utmost measure of
Joy, which
is
Heaven to him, and that more, instead of
increasing his happiness, would be painful and more than
he could sustain,

322 A treatise concerning
411. There were some other spirits of no bad disposi
tion, which sunk into a trance, and were favoured with
heavenly visions ; for spirits, even before the gate of
communication is opened in their interior, may be trans
lated into Heaven, and there become acquainted with
the happy state of angels : I saw them in this stillness
for half an hour, and then restored to their former state,
in full remembrance of all they had seen : they said, that
they had been with the angels in Heaven, and seen stu
pendous things glittering like gold and silver, with vari
ous forms of exquisite beauty, which changed themselves
into others in a wonderful manner ; but that the angels
did not seem to be pleased so much with those external
objects, as delighted with the things represented by them,
which were unutterable, as full of divine wisdom : they
likewise declared, that they had been given to know in
numerable things, which could not be described in any
human language to the ten thousandth part, nor quadrate
with ideas conversant with material objects.
412. The ignorance of almost all that enter into the
other world, in relation to celestial happiness, proceeds
from their being such strangers to true internal Joys, and
having been accustomed only to relish the pleasures of
sense, and of this world ; and therefore what they know
not passes with them for nothing ; whereas sensual and
worldly pleasures are as nothing when compared to the
former : therefore it
is,
that for the instruction of some
good spirits
in
this matter, who are without any notion
of the nature of heavenly Joys, they are at first entertain
ed with
a
sight' of paradisiacal representations, which, for
their beauty, surpass the reach of imagination
;
upon
which they suppose that they are in the true heavenly pa
radise
;
but are told, that they are as yet far short of it.
In the next place, they are brought into
a
state of inter
nal Joy to such
a
degree as they are capable of receiving
;
and then into
a
state of heavenly peace
;
at which they
express
a
sense of Joy that exceeds the power of words
to describe, or even of thought to conceive
:
thus they

413. That I might be inwardly convinced both of the
reality and nature of celestial Joys, the Lord has graci
ously been pleased to grant me an experimental sense
thereof, and this often and long together ; and therefore
I can testify to them, though not describe them ; howe
ver, a word shall be spoken on the subject, in order to
convey some imperfect idea thereof. It is an affection or
state of the soul, in which innumerable lesser pleasures
or joys form one total or aggregate, in which the compo
nent particular ones harmonize, but are not distinctly and
severally perceived, but only as forming one general or
common perception or sensation ; however, I could find
that there were innumerable others therein disposed in
marvellous manner according to heavenly order, for in.
all, even the very least, such order is observed, though,
all combined form but one general sensation according to
the quality of the recipient. In a word, in every gene
ral are infinite particulars, every one of which has its vi
tal influence and operation, and that from the inmost
ground or center from which heavenly Joys proceed. I
perceived also, that this joy and delight, issued, as it
were, from the heart, diffusing itself gently and sweetly
through all the original fibres, and from them to their se
veral ramifications and complications, and that with so
exquisite a sense of pleasure, as if every fibre were a
fountain of joyous perceptions and sensations, in compa
rison to which, gross corporeal pleasures are but as the
muddy waters of a putrid lake to the wholesome venela-
tions of refreshing breezes. I found by experience, when
ever I was prompted by a motive of benevolence, to com
municate the Joy I felt to any other, that in the room of
what was so communicated, a fresh and more copious
stream of Joy flowed in upon my soul, and that accord
ing to the degree of such benevolence. This I perceived
to be from the goodness and free bounty of the Lord.

324 A-treatise concerning
i>
cording to their proficiency in love, charity, and faith.*
There such of the female sex as had departed this life
broken with the infirmities of old age, but after having
lived in the faith of the Lord, in charity towards their
neighbour, and in all the social duties of conjugal affec
tion, after a succession of ages appear as advancing to
wards perfection in the bloom of youthful beauty surpass
ing description, whilst goodness and charity add graces
to their persons, and express themselves in every feature
of their faces, insomuch that they may pass for forms o f
charity : certain spirits that beheld them were astonished
at the sight. Such is the form of charity, which in Hea
ven is represented to the life, for it is charity that pour-
trays
it,
and
it
is
pourtrayed in
it,
and that in
a
manner
so expressive, that the whole angel, more particularly as
to the face, appears as charity itself
in
a
personal form of
exquisite beauty, affecting the soul of the spectator with
something of the same grace. In
a
word, to grow old
in Heaven
is
to grow in youth and beauty, as
is
the case
with all those who have here lived in love to the Lord,
and in charity towards their neighbour. Such are the
forms of the celestial inhabitants, though with unspeaka.
ble distinction and variety.
*
Something has been said before in
a
former note concerning
faith in Heaven
;
and
it
may not be improper further to observe hi
this place, that though
it
be
a
generally received opinion in the
church, that faith in Heaven will cease, as being swallowed up in
vision and the accomplishment of the promises, yet however
a
hu
man faith, as to the reality and certainty of future things, will cease
when those things now future shall come to pass
;
yet
it
follows not
that
a
divine, dependent, confidential faith in the Lord for the con
tinuance of his goodness and blessings will ever fail, as
it
is
the ex
ercise of
a
duty naturally springing from the relation subsisting be
tween the most exalted of created beings, and their adorable Creator
and Benefactor, to whose free bounty and goodness they stand in
debted both for the continuation of their existence, and the happi
ness of
it
;
of which, faith, love, and obedience, may be the abso
lute conditions, though no less voluntary on their part on that ac
count. Tr.

Heaven and Hell; 325
OF THE IMMENSITY OF HEAVEN.
415. THAT Heaven is of immense extent may be
gathered from many things laid down in the foregoing
part of this work, and particularly from what has been
said concerning its being inhabited by all good people of
the human race, (see above, n. 311 to 317) both from
within and without thejchurch, from the creation of the
earth. He that knows any thing of geography, may form
some judgment how vast a multitude must people this
our world, and will find, upon a moderate calculation,
that several thousands die every day, and some millions
in the space of a year, and that mortality has been going
on with us from the earliest times now for some thou
sands of years, passing thus continually into the world
of spirits : how many of these have and do become An
gels, cannot be known ; but thus much 1 have been told,
that very many such there we-e in ancient times, for
then men were more spiritually minded, and more hea
venly in their affections ; but not so many in the follow
ing ages, as in process of time they turned more to the
world, and set their affections more on things below.
From this first consideration it may appear, that Heaven
is of great extent from the number of inhabitants therein
from this world only.
416. But the immensity of Heaven will still farther
appear from considering, that all Infants that depart this
life, whether within or without the church, are adopted
by the Lord, and advanced to the angelical state, and
that the number of these amounts to the fourth or fifth
part of the human species on earth. That every infant,
where-ever born, and whether sprung from good or bad
parents, is after death received by the Lord, educated
in Heaven, and according to an established order of that
kingdom, principled with good affections, and instruct
ed in the knowledge of the truth ; and, when perfected
iii understanding and wisdom, adopted into the order of
Angels; see above, n. 329 to 345. How great a multi
tude of Angels may we suppose to come from this single
seminary from the creation to this present time!

326 A treatise concerning
417. Another proof of the Immensity of Heaven is de
ductible from hence, viz that all the planets so visible to
our sight in this solar system, are so many worlds or
earths ; and that there are also innumerable others in the
universe, all inhabited, concerning which I shall quote
the following passage extracted from a little work writ
ten by me, intitled, De Telluribus in Universo. " That
" there are many worlds inhabited by men, who after-
" wards become spirits and anguls, is a truth well known
" in the other life ; for every one there, that desires it
" from the love of truth and useful knowledge, is allow-
" ed to converse . with the spirits from other worlds in
" order to be convinced of the plurality of worlds, and
" that not this earth only, but also innumerable other are
"
peopled by the human species. I have sometimes con-
" versed with spirits from our world on this subject, and
" told them, that any man of rational understanding
"
might conclude from things clearly known, that there
**
are more worlds besides this, inhabited by human crea-
" tures, as it was highly reasonable to conclude, that
" such great bodies as the planets, some of which exceed
" our earth in magnitude, are not mere solitudes, and
" created only to revolve round the Sun, and shed a lie—
" tie inconsiderable light on our earth, but designed for
" far more important uses. He that believes, as every
" rational man must, that Divine Omnipotence created
" the universe for human creatures, and through them
" for Heaven, they being the seminary for the peopling
" of Heaven, cannot but believe that every world is in-
" habited by mankind. That the planets, which are so
"
conspicuous to us within the limits of our solar system,
" are so many habitable worlds, manifestly appears from
" their exhibiting all the phenomena of terrestial bodies*
" such as reflecting to us the light of the Sun, and, when
" viewed through a telescope, not shewing themselves as
"
glittering masses of fire, but as solid globes of earth
" variegated with dark spots ; as also from their resem-
**
bling our earth in their revolutions round the Sun in
**
their progress through the Zodiac, thereby describing

" was found, that upon the supposition of there being a

to take place in the compass of six thousand years, and

" which would be but as a point compared to the uni-
" verse, as any one of the Satellites seen from our earth

" an universe of worlds, to Infinite Power? I have had
" conversation with some angels on this subject, who ex-
" pressed like sentiments on the matter, saying, that their
"thoughts were more employed about states than space;

but that it was very evident, that all the generations of
" men, and countless myriads of worlds, were as nothing

compared to Infinity." As to the worlds in the uni
verse, and their inhabitants, and spirits and angels from
thence, see the little work before mentioned : all therein
related was revealed and shewed to me, in order to make
manifest somewhat of the Immensity of Heaven, and that
all the inhabitants thereof were originally of human ex
traction ; and also to make known that our Lord is eve

418. The Immensity of Heaven will farther appear
from hence, that Heaven in its whole complex resem
bles one man, and also corresponds to all and singular
the parts in man, and that such Correspondency cannot
be so full, as to admit of no increase, seeing it not only
has relation to all the members, organs, and viscera of
the body in general, but also to the most minute particu
lars thereof, and to every vessel, nerve, and fibre ; and
not only to these, but also to those moat subtle organi

whence arise those interior active-powers, which are the
next immediate instruments subservient to the operations
of the human mind ; for whatever internally exists in man,
exists in some substantial form as its subject, without
which it is nothing : now there is a Correspondence be
tween all these and the heavenly world ; see ch. Of the
Correspondence of all Things in Heaven with all Things
in Man, n. 87 to 102. This Correspondency can never
be at its ne plus ultra, because the more numerous the
angelical consociations, which correspond to any one
member, the higher is the degree of perfection in Hea
ven, for all perfection there increases according to plura
lity, and that because in the Heavens one end is pursued
in all things, and by the unanimous consent of all : now
this end is the common good, from which arises benefit
to the individuals, and from the good of the individuals
arises benefit to the community ; this proceeds from the
Lord turning all in Heaven towards himself, (see above,
n. 123) and thereby making them all one in himself. That
the unanimity and concord of many, more especially from
a divine original, and such a bond of union, must produce
perfection, every one of sound judgment will readily
allow.
419. I have been favoured with a sight of the Heaven
that is inhabited, and also of that which is not inhabited ;
and I saw that the former was of such vast extent, as not
to be filled in eternity, on a supposition that there were
many myriads of worlds like this of ours, and every one
of them equally full of inhabitants, concerning which see
my little work, De Telluribus in Uhiverso, n. 168.
420. Some erroneously suppose, that Heaven is not of
such vast extent as is here mentioned, but rather compara
tively small ; being led into this error by some passages in
Scripture ill understood as vyhere it seems to be implied,
that the poor only are admitted into Heaven ; or none
but the elect ; or such only as are within the church ; or
those alone in whose behalf the Lord intercedes ; as also
where heaven is represented as being shut after having
received its full number, and that there is a fixed time
appointed for this : but let them know, that Heaven will

moreover are of opinion, that every one receives his ap

means no more than admission into

the Lord leads every one by his mercy that receives him
;

;

OF THE
W ORLD OF SPIRITS,
A ND OF THE
STATE OF MAN AFTER DEATH.
WHAT IS MEANT BY THE WORLD OF SPIRITS.
421. What is called the World of Spirits is neither
Heaven nor Hell, but a place or state betwixt both, into
which man enters immediately after death, and after stay
ing there a certain time, longer or shorter, according to
Avhat his past life had been in this world, he is either
received up into Heaven, or cast down, into Hell.
422. That there is such an intermediate place appoint
ed for man after this life, has been manifested to me from
having seen Hell beneath, and Heaven above it; and that
man, whilst there is in neither of them. The heavenly
state in man is from the conjunction of good and truth
within him, and the hellish state in man is from the
conjunction of evil and false within him; by the former
he is prepared for Heaven, and by the latter for Hell ;
now this conjunction is completed in the World of Spirits,
or the intermediate state; whether we call it the con
junction of the understanding and will, or the conjunction
of good and truth, it comes to the same thing.
423. Something must be premised here concerning
this^ conjunction of the intellect, and will, and their co-
relatives good and truth, as completed in the World of
Spirits. To man belong understanding and will : the
former is the recipient of truths, and is formed by them
and the will is the recipient of goods, and is formed
thereby : so that whatever a man understands and brings

332 A treatise concerning
into thought, that he calls truth ; and what he wills and
brings into thought, that he calls good. A man may
think from his intellectual part, and thence perceive
what is true, and what is good ideally ; but he thinks it
not trom the will part or faculty, unless he chuses and
does it ; but when he wills
it,
and from the operation of
'willing also does
it,
then
it
is
both in the understanding
and
in
the will, and consequently in the man, who con
sists of both jointly, but not ofeither singly and separate
ly
;
and therefore in that case only
it
is
appropriated
to him, or becomes properly his own
;
whereas what a
man has only intellectually and in theory, however
it
may serve him to reason upon, and to make
a
counterfeit
show of outwardly, yet having; got no hold on his will,
it
makes no part of himself, but is only
a
matter of memory -
and science, which he can take up or lay down, but
gains no essential form in him.
424.
It
is
provided that man should be able to think
from the intellectual part separately from the will, to the
end that he may be reformed and changed; for he
is
re
formed by means of truths, and these appertain to the
intellect, as was said before. Man
is
born into the world
-
with natural propensities to evil, whence
it
is
that he
is
so swallowed up in the love of self, as to grudge and
covet the good things of others, and to take pleasure in
their loss
if
it
may turn to his gain, being only intent on
the honours, riches, and pleasures of this wrorld; now
that this malignity of his nature may be reformed, he
is
endowed with the power of apprehending truths in his
understanding, that he may thereby counteract and sub
due the evil affections in his will
;
hence
it
is
that he can
speculate truths in his intellect, and bring forth into
speech, and act according to them
;
yet they are not pro-
perly his own till they be dictated from his heart and
will, and flow spontaneously into his life and actions
;
and
where this
is
the case, the thoughts of
a
man's mind, or
understanding, constitute his faith
;
and the thoughts of his
heart or will constitute his love
;
and so his faith and love,
like his understanding and will, are united and agree in
one.

425. As far therefor: as truths in the understanding arc
conjoined with good [boms'] in the will, and consequently,
as far as any one is freely actuated thereby in the practical
manifestation of them, so far he has Heaven in himself,
or is in a heavenly state ; for as was said before, the con
junction of good and truth is Heaven in the soul ; but as far
as falsest/so] in the understanding are conjoined with
evil in the will, so far a man has Hell in himself, or is in
a hellish state; for the conjunction of false and evil consti
tutes Hell : but as far as truth in the understanding is not
united with good in the will, so far man-is in a middle
state between both ; now almost all at this time are in a
state of knowing something of truth intellectually or sci
entifically, whilst some live more, some less, and some not
at all according to it ; nay, some quite contrary to it
through the love of evil, and from thence through a false
belief ; therefore, that every one may have his full prepar
ation and fitness for Heaven or Hell, he passes immedi
ately after death into the World of spirits, where the con
junction of good and truth is compleated in those whose
lot is to Heaven ; and the conjunction of evil and falsity
in those who are to have their portion in Hell ; for in those
two kingdoms none are allowed to be divided betwixt
good and evil, or to think one way, and will another ; and
therefore the Angels in Heaven, who have their wills in
good, have their understandings in truth ; and the spi»
rits in Hell, who have their wills in evil, know only the
false ; consequently, in this intermediate state of final pre
paration, whatever of false \falsa~\ has cleaved to the good
spirits is done away, and such truths as are accordant
and conformable to their good are given diem ; and from
the bad spirits are taken away such adventitious or spec
ulative truths as they may have acquired, and they be
come possessed of such falsities \Jhlsa\ in their room, as
are accordant and conformable, with their evil nature.
(*) Thus much may suffice to explain what is meant by
the World of Spirits.

numbers may appear to some of our readers, (though we have used our
best endeavours to reader the matter intelligible to all) it must be ob
served, tha.t they hold forth to us a doctrine of great importance, and

o
426. In the World of Spirits is always a very great
number of them, as their is the first resort of all, in order
to their examination and preparation ; but their is no fixed
time for their stay there for some are translated to Heaven,
and others consigned to Hell soon after their arrival,
while t some continue there for weeks, and others for
several years, though none more than thirty, this depend
ing on the correspondence or Non-correspondence be
tween the interior and exterior of men. How they pass
from one state to another in this world, in the course of
their preparation, shall be spoken of in what follows.
427. As soon as they arrive in the World of Spirits,
they arc all classed by the Lord according to their several
qualities and dispositions, the evil with such infernal so
cieties as they had communication with in this world in
the ruling passion ; and the good with such of the hea
venly societies as they had communication with in love,
chaiity, and faith: but however they are thus diversely
classed, vet all meet and converse together in that world,
worth v of their most attentive consideration ; and the knowledge thereof
is highly conducive to the clearer understanding of the Author in ma
ny parts ofhis writings: he therein treats of the two great constituent
principles of man, the understanding and will, and shews how the de
praved affections of the latter arc to be subdued and reformed here by
the light and ]>owcr of truth received from the former; in which case
the understanding and will are in union, and truth springs not so much
from the exercise of reasoning, as from the principle of good in the
will: the tree beiii;;; made good, the fruit is consequently the same :
but without this union, the understanding and will may be contrary to
each other, and the former think the things that are excellent, whilst
(he latter follows those that are contrary thereto, as is the case with the
speculative believer, whose life is not as hecometh the Gospel of
Christ, but contrary to his faith. Now in the World of Spirits, where
all arc finally prepared for Heaven or Hell, the understanding and will
are united both in the good and the bad Spirits, when the latter, having
their understanding darkened through the evil in their will know only
what is false, or contrary to truth, whilst the former have their under
standing enlightened with the knowledge of the truth from their love
of good in the will, and so both good and bad Spirits think and speak
and act in all things consistently with the governing principle within
them respectively. Let it be noted here, that this intermediate state
has nothing in it of the probationary kind, for that is all over with the
life of this world, but is a state of separation, or reducing every one to
his proper prevailing principle, and, as such, finally preparatory for
Hoavcn or Hell. Tr.

Heaven and Hell: 335
when they have a desire so to do, who have been friends
and acquaintance in this life, more especially husbands
and wives, brothers and sisters : I have seen a,father con
versing with his six sons with a perfect remembrance of
them all, and also many others with their kindred and
friends ; but as most of them were of different inclina
tions and habits of mind, according to the different ways
of life here, they were soon parted ; but it must be noted
both concerning those that go to Heaven, and those that
go to Hell, that after their arrival in those two different
kingdoms, they no more see or know one another, un
less they are of like minds and affections. The reason why
they meet and know one another in the World of Spirits,
and not so in Heaven or Hell, is, because in the first of
these Worlds they pass through the same states they were
in in this life, and so from one to another ; but afterwards
all are fixed in one permanent state respectively, accord
ing to the state of that love which prevails in them, in
which one knows another from similarity of condition ;
for as was observed above, n. 41 to 50, similitude joins,
and dissimilitude separates.
428. As the World of Spirits is a middle state with
man between Heaven and Hell, so is also a middle place,
having the Hells beneath, and the Heavens above. All
the Hells are shut next to that World, except that some
holes or clefts, like as in rocks, or wide mouths, are left
open ; and these so guarded, that none can pass through
them but by permission, which is granted on particular
occasions, of which hereafter : Heaven likewise appears
as fenced all round, so that there is no passing to any of
the heavenly Societies, but by a narrow way, which is like
wise guarded. These outlets and inlets are what in Scrip
ture are called the doors and gates of Heaven and Hell.
429. The World ofSpirits appears like a valley between
mountains and rocks here and there sinking and rising.
The doors and gates opening to the heavenly Societies are
only seen by those who are in their preparation for Hea

gates of the Hells visible to any, but those that are g~»ing
to enter therein, to whom they are then opened ; at which
time there appear, like as it were, dark and sooty caverns-
leading obleaquely down to the deep, where there are also
more gates. Through those dark and dismal caverns ex
hale certaiu fetid vapours, which are most offensive to the
good Spirits, but which the evil ones are greedily fond of ;
for as was the evil which an)r one took most delight in
Avhen in this world, such is the stink corresponing thereto
that most pleases him in the other ; in which they may be
aptly compared to those birds and beasts of prey, as ra
vens, wolves, and swine, that are attracted by the rank
effluvia emitted from carrion and putrid carcases : I once
heard one of those unhappy spirits loudly bemoaning him
self, as from some inward anguish, on being struck with
a fragrant odour from Heaven ; and afterwards relieved
from his misery on scenting a fetid exhalation from Hell.
430. There are also in every man two gates, the one
of which opens towards Hell, and to all that is evil and
false (malis et falsis) proceeding thence ; the other gate
opens towards Heaven, and to all good and truth bonis et
veris that issue thence ; the infernal gate is open in those
who are in evil and its false (in malo et inde Jhlso,) and
they receive from above only some glimmering of hea
venly light, just sufficient to serve them to think, reason,
and talk of heavenly things ; but the gate of heaven
stands open in those who are in good and its truth in bono
et indevero.) There are also two ways leading to the ra
tional mind in man, the superior or internal, by which
good and truth is communicated from the Lord : and the
inferior or external way, by which evil and false are
communicated from Hell, and the rational mind is in the
midst ofthese two ways : hence it is, that as much of the
heavenly light as any man admits into his mind, so far is
he truly rational ; and so much as he admits not of
it,
in
such proportion he
is
not rational, however he may think
himself so. These things are offered, to shew the Cor
respondence that subsists between man and Heaven and

being in Heaven, and the things beneath it in Hell; the
former are opened, and the latter (as to all influx of evil and
false) are shut with respect to those who are in their pre
paration for Heaven ; but, on the other hand, the things
from beneath are opened, and the things above are shut
(as to all influx of good and truth) with respect to those,
who are in their preparation for Hell ; consequently, the
latter can only look down to the things beneath them, or
to Hell ; and the former only to the things above them, or

to the Lord, who is the common center to which all hea

i338 A treatise concerning
deed customary to ascribe action, motion, and power to
the body in the common forms of speaking ; but to sup
pose that these properties belong to the instrument, and
not solely to the principle that actuates
it,
is
erroneous
and absurd.
433. Asrall vital power, both of acting and thinking,
appertains solely to the spirit, and
in
no wise to the body,
it
follows, that the spirit
is
truly and properly the man,
and that without its influence and operation there
is
nei
ther thought nor life from the crown of the head to the
sole of the foot
;
consequently, that the separation of the
body from the spirit, which we call death, takes nothing
from that which in reality constitutes the man.
I
have
been informed by the angels, that some, even after
death, before they are raised to their second life, have
sensible perception for
a
while, as
if
still in the body,
though without the power of bodily motion.
434. Man would not be capable of thinking and will
ing, unless there were
in
him substance to serve as the
subject of these operations, and to suppose otherwise
would be ascribing existence to non -entity, as may appear
from man's not being able to see without that organ,
which
is
the subject of vision, orto hear without the organ
of hearing
;
these senses being nothing without such sub
jects of their operations. Now thought
is
internal vision
or the sight of the mind, as perception
is
the internal
hearing, and these without internal organized substances,
as their proper subjects cannot exist
;
so that the spirit of
a
man has equally
a
form, and that
a
human one, as also
its sensory and t>enses, Avhen divested of its material body
as
it
had before
;
for all the perceptive life of the eye and
the ear, and of every other sense that appertains to
man,
is
not from his material body, but from his spirit
and the vital powers thereof, in all and singular the or
gans and parts of his body
:
hence
it
is, that spirits see,
hear, and feel, as well as men, in the spiritual world,
(*) though not in this natural world after their separation
(*) To suppose
a

to annihilate the very idea of spirit

from this mortal body. That the spirit had natural sen
sations in this world, was owing to its union with a natu
ral or material body, but then also it had its spiritual senses
in various modes of thinking and willing.
435- The foregoing doctrine is here offered, to con
vince the rational reader, that man, considered in him
self, is a spirit, and that the corporeal part of his compo
sition annexed to him in this natural and material world
is in order to his relation thereto, and what he has to do
therein, but is not the man himself, but only designed to
be instrumental to the operation of his spirit ; but, .as
few are capable of receiving abstract reasonings, and
many are apt to run them into matter of doubtful dispu
tation, by arguments drawn from fallacious appearances
of sense, I chuse, for confirmation of the doctrine in hand
to appeal to truths founded on experience. Such as have
confirmed themselves in the belief of the contrary side,
are given to think, that as the beasts have life and sensa
tions as well as men, so they have both the same spirit
and the same end; but this is a gross error, as the spirit
of a beast immensely differs from that of a man, as being
destitute of that sublime principle of a heavenly life, by
which the latter is made receptive of the divine influx,
and capable of being exalted to a participation of the
divine nature ; and therefore it is that man is so highly
privileged above the beasts, that he can think of God, and
the things pertaining to his kingdom both in heaven and
tives) so every spirit has its body suited to the world it belongs to, ac
cording to that distinction laid down by the apostle ;
" There is a
" natural body, and there is a spiritual body :" and indeed, it is as ra
tional to conclude, that a human spirit should have a human, organized
body endued with spiritual senses in a spiritual world, as that the same
spirit should be invested with a material organized body with natural
senses in this natural world. It is to be lamented, and the more for its
tendency to promote infidelity, that'many of the learned, so called, have
in a manner defined and refined spiritual nature into nothing, by dives
ting it of substantiality, to which it has a more particular right by far
than matter; nor is the body of an angel less substantial in a proper
sense of the word than a solid rock, though not according to the con
dition or material nature. Upon the whole, the common ideas of the
vulgar and illiterate come much nearer to the truth and reality of hea
venly things, than the vain conceits of such speculating sciolists. Tr.

earth, and be led thereby to love the Lord, and to be
united to him ; now that which is in the capacity of such
union is not liable to perish, like that which is not. As
to this inmost or supreme part in man above what the
beasts possess, something has been said before, n. 39, but
which it is thought proper to repeat in this place, as ap
posite to the subject before us, viz. " I am here led to say
" something concerning the angels of the three Hea-
" vens, which has hitherto continued a secret, through
**
want of knowledge as to the three degrees of the divine
" order, spoken of, n. 38. viz that there is in every
" angel and in every man an inmost and supreme de-
" gree or part, which more immediately admits the di«
" vine influx from the Lord, and whereby all that is
" within man in the inferior degrees are orderly disposed
" and regulated. This inmost or supreme part of the
" spirit or soul, may be called the Lord's entrance into
" angels and men, nay, his very habitation in them ;
" and hereby it is that man is distinguished from the
" brute animals, which have it not, and is rendered
" capable of near communication with the Lord in the
,(
inner man, of believing in him, loving him, and of
" seeing him : nay, from hence it is that man is a recipi-
" ent of understanding and wisdom, and also that he is
" endowed with a rational life, and an heir of immortali-
" ty ; but how or what the Lord operates in this inmost
" recess or supreme part of man, exceeds the capacity of
■*
an angel to comprehend."
436. That man is a spirit internally, has been given me
to know from an experience, which would take up many
sheets to relate. I have conversed with spirits as a spirit,
and also as a man in the body, and when I conversed with
them in the former character, I appeared to them as a spirit
in a human form like to themselves, my interior part being
in all things conformable thereto, for at such times the
corporeal material part did not appear.
437. That man is a spirit internally, may also be evinced
from hence, that upon his separation from the body by
death, he still continues a living man as before : that I
might be certified of this, it has been allowed me to con

verse with almostall that I was acquainted with intheirlife-
time here, with some only for hours, with some for weeks
and months, and with some for years ; and this was permit
ted, to the intent that I might be confirmed in this truth,
and also be qualified by experience to bear testimony to
the same.
'
428, To what has been said I have permission to add,
that every one whilst here in the body is, as to his spirit,
in some society of spirits, though he knows it not, and by
means of them has communication either with some hea
venly or infernal society, accordingly as he is good or bad,
and also that he is joined thereto after death. This is
often told and shewed to those who pass from hence into
the world of spirits: not that a man appears, whilst he
lives in this world, as a spirit in such society, and that
because he as yet exercises his thinking faculties according
to his state in nature ; but where any are such as think
abstractedly from the body, they being in a spiritual
frame, do sometimes appear in their respective societies,
and are well distinguished by the spirits that are of it ;
their manner is to go about musing and silent, without
looking at others, and as if they did not see them ; but
as soon as any spirit speaks to them, they immediately
disappear.
439. To illustrate that man is interiorly a spirit, I shall
here shew from experience, what it is to be withdrawn,
from the body, and what it is to be carried by the spirit
to another place.
440. As to the first, viz. to be withdravyn from the
body, it is in this manner: a man is brought into a mid
dle state betwixt sleeping, and waking, during which he
knows no other than that he is perfectly awake, foras
much as all his senses are as lively as ever, his sight, his
hearing, and what appears still more strange, even his
feeling : nay, this last is at such a time more exquisite
than at others. In this state I have seen spirits and an
gels to the life, have heard them speak, and, what will
be thought still more wonderful, have touched them,
though the material body then bore no part therein: it is
in reference to this state that we read of being absent from

the body ; and also of not knoiving whether one is in the
body, or out ofthe body. Into this state 1 have been brought
only three or four times, to the intent that I might have
some experience of
it,
and also know that spirits and an
gels are possessed of every sense, and man also in spirit
when withdrawn from the body.
441. As to the second of the states mentioned, viz. that
of being translated by the spirit to another place
;
this
I
have had living proof of, though only twice or thrice
;
my
experience of which
is
as follows. As
I
was walking in
the streets of
a
certain city, and at another time out in the
fields, to all seeming perfectly in the use of my bodily sen
ses, and seeing my way as at other times,.
I
was in
a
trance,
conversing with spirits, and saw
in
the vision, groves,
rivers, palaces, houses, men, and many other objects
;
when after walking thus for some hours,
I
suddenly re
turned to my natural sight, and found myself in
a
far dis
tant place
;
at which
I
was at first greatly amazed
;
but
on recollection perceived, that
I
had been in the like state
with those that are said to have been carried
by
the spirit
into another place
;
for during the trance or transit, the
person had no idea or thought concerning the way, though
of many miles
;
nor of the time, though
it
should be of
many hours, or even days; neither
is
he sensible of any
fatigue. Thus he
is
conducted through ways he
is
an
entire stranger to, by
a
certain direction, to the place
appointed.
442. But these two states of man, as being of the more
interior kind, or, which signifies the same, when he
is
in
the spirit, are an extraordinary dispensation, and only oc
casionally made known to me as realities acknowledged
by the church; but to converse with spirits, and to be with
them as one of their own society,
is
a
privilege which has
been granted to me in the most perfect use of all the bodi
ly
senses, and that now for many years.
443. That man, as to his interior state,
is
a
spirit, may
further be confirmed by what has been said above, n. 311
to 317, on the subject of Heaven and Hell, as consisting
of the human race.

spiritual, and constitute the very essence of the human
species ; and, also according to their respective difference
therein, the particular distinction of one individual of it
from another.
OF MAN'S BEING RAISED FROM DEATH AND HIS
ENTRANCE INTO IMMORTALITY.
445. WHEN the body of a man is no longer able to
perform its natural functions corresponding to the thoughts
and affections of his spirit, and which are derived to him
from the spiritual world, then he is said to die; which
comes to pass when the lungs and the heart cease their
respiratory and contractile motions ; not that man then suf
fers extinction of life, but only is separated from that cor
poreal part of his composition, which served him for an
instrument of usefulness in this world; but he still con
tinues a living man, and that in a power and literal sense
of the expression, inasmuch as man receives his denomi
nation not from his body, but from his spirit, since it is
the latter that thinks in him, and that thought with affec
tion essentially constitute the man; so that when any man is
said to die, it means no more than that he passes from one
world into another ; and hence it is, that by Death in the
Scripture, according to the internal sense of that word, is
signified Resurrection, and continuation of life. (251)
446. There is a very near communication and corres
pondence betwixt the spirit and respiration, and the motion
of the heart [the systole] betwixt thinking and respira
tion, and betwixt the affection of love and the heart; (252)

344 A treatise concaiiing
so that when these two motions cease in the body, a sepa
ration presently ensues ; for these two motions, viz. that
which is respiratory in the lungs and that which is called
the systole or contractile power of the heart, are the two
bonds of the union, which when broken, the spirit is left
to itself, and the body, being destitute of life from the spi
rit, becomes cold and putrifies. That so intimate a com
munication subsists between the human spirit and respira
tion, and the heart, is because all the vital motions in this
world depend thereon, not only in common, but also in
every particular part of the body. (253)
447. The spirit of a Man remains some little time in
the body after all signs of life disappear, but not longer
than till a total cessation of all power in the heart ensues,
which varies according to the nature of the disease he
dies of, for the motion of the heart continues long after in
some, but not so in others ; but as soon as the total cessa
tion of it happens, the Resuscitation of Man commences,
and this by the sole power of the Lord. By Resuscita
tion here is meant the liberation of the Spirit of a Man
from his body, and the introduction of it into the world
of Spirits, and commonly called Resurrection. That
the Spirit of a Man is not separated from his body
before all motion and power in the heart intirely ceases,
is because the heart corresponds to the affection of love,
which is the very life of man; for it is from love that
every one derives his vital heat; (254) therefore so long

actuates and communicates life to the body.
448. The manner in which Resuscitation is performed,
has not only been told to me, but also manifested to me
by actual experience in myself, to the end that I might
be fully certified thereof.
449. I was brought into a state of insensibility with
respect to the bodily senses, and nearly into that of dying
persons, the interior life, together with the power of
thinking, remaining at the same time perfectly intire, so
that I could perceive and retain in memory what happen
ed, and also know how it is with those who are raised
from the dead : I perceived likewise that the lungs scarce
ly continued their office, but there remained an interior
respiration in my Spirit, joined with a gen'le and almost
imperceptible breathing of the body : I then first expe
rienced a communication of the pulse of the heart with the
heavenly kingdom, for that kingdom corresponds to the
heart in Man ; some Angels also appeared from thence,,
some at a distance, and two placed themselves near to
my head, upon which all concern and regard for myself
ceased ; however thought and perception remained with
me : in this state I continued for some hours. At length
the Spirits that were about me departed, supposing me
to be dead ; and at the same time an aromatic odour,
like that of a body embalmed, diffused itself around; for
on the presence of the Celestial Angels, that which would
be otherwise a cadaverous smell, is changed into such a
fragrancy, (*) which is so offensive to bad Spirits, as to
hinder their approach : and it is by this means that they
are kept from molesting such as are in their .passage to
eternal life. The Angels which had placed themselves at
my head were silent, only communicating their thoughts
to mine, which being received, they know that the Spirit

of the Man so recipient, is in a proper state to be convey
ed from the body. The manner of communicating their
thoughts to me was by looking at me full in the face, for
such is the manner of like communication in Heaven.
As thought and perception all along remained with me,
to the end that I might know and remember the way of
Resuscitation, so I perceived that the Angels before men
tioned scrutinized into my thoughts, to know whether
they were like to those of dying persons, which are gen
erally employed on the subjects of eternal life, and also I
found, that they endeavoured to direct my thoughts that
way ; I was told afterwards, that the Spirit ofevery dying
Man was preserved in his last best thoughts, till the pre
vailing power of those, which proceeded from his ruling
love or passsion when in the world, took possession of
him. I was given to perceive and experience, in a par
ticular manner, a certain violent attraction of my inward
Man or Spirit from my body; and it was told me, that
this was from the Lord, and introductory to Resurrec
tion.
450. The Celestial Angels, after joining themselves to
any raised Spirit, do not leave him, for they are loving
to every one ; but if he be one that is not qualified to
be their companion, he earnestly wishes to be separated
from them, on which he is joined by some of the Angels
from the middle or spiritual Heaven, who bring him to a
sight of the external light, for hitherto all had passed with
him inwardly in vision, I beheld the manner in which
this appeared to be done, namely, by an evolution of the
external coat of the left eye back to the fence or septum of
the nose, in order to give a free ingress of light to the
eye for the purpose of vision. (*) This seems to be a

them against indulging a vein ofliberty bordering on profaneness, as far
as it may extend to the parables of our Lord, and the visions in the
Prophets and the Apocalypse, wherein spiritual things in the Heavens
are represented by natural similitudes on earth. Besides, it is very

lids upon a man's first waking in the morning : it seem
ed to me to be of a celestial colour, but I was told after
wards, that it appears differently to different persons : af
ter this, a kind of tegument or veil is perceived to be
gently removed from the face, but this also is in appear-
ance only, such evolution representing a spiritual frame
of mind and thinking, succeeding to that which before
was natural only. Moreover, these Angels use their best
endeavours to hinder any sentiment or affection from be
ing excited in the mind of the new-raised Spirit that i»
not tinctured with love ; after this they give him to know,
that he is now a Spirit. After these ministrations of
light and knowledges to his condition, the spiritual An
gels shew all kind offices to the new Spirit that accord
with his state, and instruct him in things pertaining to
the other life, so far as consist with his present capacity ;
but if he is such a one as is not capable of receiving ben
efit from their friendly endeavours, in that case he desires
be to separated from their company, not that they leave
him, but he quits them ; for the Angels love every one,
and it is their highest delight to attend, instruct, and to
conduct them to Heaven. When he has thus separated
himself from their society, he is next received by the good
Spirits [in the intermediate state] into their society, who,
in like manner, do him all kind offices; but if his life in
this world has been such as disqualifies him for their socie
ty, he is desirous, as before, to be separated from them
also ; and so on, till he can associate with such as are like
himself, in whose company he finds his true enjoyment;
and with them he lives (however strange it may seem) a
life conformable to that which he chose in this World.
451. But this way of life in his new state lasts only for
some days ; after which he continues his progress from
eel to the apprehensions and ideas they carry with them ; nay, that all
things spiritual will eternally he visibly represented under significant
emblems, both for the instruction and entertainment of the heavenly
inhabitants, as this may constitute no small part of Celestial Delights.

348 A treatise concerning
state to state, till it finally terminates in Heaven or Hell,
as will appear in the sequel, and of which I have had con
vincing proof.
452. I have conversed with some the third day after
their decease, when they passed through all that has been
mentioned in the foregoing numbers, n. 449, 450 ; and
also with three who were of my acquaintance in this world,
whom I informed, that their friends were at that time pre
paring their funerals, and that they were then on the point
of interment ; at which account they appeared astonished,
saying, that they knew themselves to be alive, and there
fore that they could only bury what had been of use to
them in this world, but now belonged to them no more ;
and presently after expressed their wonder, that whilst in
this world, neither they, nor so many others in the church,
truly believed in such a life after the death of the body.
Such as in this world had little or no belief of a life after
death, appear confounded and ashamed when they expe
rience the contrary; but as to those who had taken pains
to confirm themselves in unbelief as to this matter, they
are classed with their fellows, and separated from such as
had lived in the belief of it ; and as to the greater part of
them, they are in chains with a certain hellish society, being
such as had denied God, and held the fundamental doc
trines of the Christian Church in contempt ; for as far as
any one studies to confirm himself in the disbelief of a fu:
ture state, so far he declares himself an enemy to heavenly
things, and to the Church of God.
THAT MAN AFTER DEATH IS IN A PERFECT
HUMAN FORM.
453. THAT the Form of the Spirit ofa Man is in a Hu
man Form, or, in other words, that the Spirit is the true
formed Man, may be evinced from many of the foregoing
articles, particularly from those wherein is shewed, that
every Angel is in a perfect Human Form, n. 73 to 77

and also that every Man is a Spirit as to his- inner Man, n.
432 to 444 ; and that the Angels in Heaven are from the
human race, n. 31 1 to 317. This also more evidently ap
pears from Man's being denominated Man from his spi*
rir, and not from his body, and because the corporeal Form
is an adjunct to the Spirit after its Form, and not contrari
wise, the former being but the cloathing of the latter.
Moreover, the Spirit is the sole moving power in Man,
acting upon tod actuating every the most minute part of
the body, insomuch that when any part no longer de
rives vital influence therefrom, it presently dies. Now
the ruling powers, which govern the body as their subject,
are the thought and the will ; but these are from the Spi
rit only, nay, constitute its very essence. The reason why
we do not see any separate Spirit, nor not yet that of ano
ther Man whilst in his body, in its Human Form, with our
present organs of sight, is because these organs of vision
are material, and therefore only capable of discerning ob
jects of material nature, whereas spiritual things must be
seen by a spiritual eye ; * but when the corporeal sight is
extinguished by the death of the body, and the Spirit's eye
is opened, then Spirits appear to one another in thtir Hu
man Form, not only in the spiritual world, but they also
see the Spirits of those who yet live here in the body.
454. That a Human Form is proper to a human Spirit,
follows from Man's being created in the Form of Heaven,
and also receptive of all things of a heavenly nature and
order, (255) consequently with the faculty of receiving
understanding and wisdom ; for whether we express it by
the words, faculty of receiving understanding and wisdom,
or, the faculty of receiving Heaven, it comes to the same,
(*) It is to be noted here, that when spirits are seen by any one in
the body, they are not seen with the corporeal organs of vision, but by
the spirit of the beholder abstractedly from the body, though the ap
pearance is exactly the same in both cases, as implied in those words
of the Apostle, where, speaking of his visions, he says, " Whether
in the body, or out of the body, 1 cannot tell."
(255) That Man is the subject participating of all things relative to
the Divine Order, and that by creation he has a Form of Divine Order,
n. 4219,4220, 4223, 4523 —9706, 10156,1047. That as far as any
one lives here according to Divine Order, so far he appears perfect,
aind of beautiful form in the other world, n. 4839, 6605, 6626.

350 A treatise concerning
o
as may appear from what has been said before concerning
the Light and Heat of Heaven, n. 126 to 140; concern
ing the Form of Heaven, n. 200 to 212; concerning the
•Wisdom of Angels, n. 265 to 275 ; and in the Article
wherein is shewed, that Heaven, as to its Form resembles
a Man both in whole and in part, n. 59 to 77, and this
from the Divine Humanity of the Lord, from whom Hea
ven and its form originate, n. 78 to 86.
455. What has hitherto been said on this subject may
be understood by the rational Man, from this view of cau
ses and thcrr effects of premises and their consequences ;
but not so by the obstinately irrational, and that for many
assignable reasons ; but principally, because he is averse to
all doctrines which are contrary tothe false principles that he
has adopted in the room of truths ; and he that has thus shut
up his mind, hath shut the gate of Heaven against himself,
so that no light from thence can illuminate his rational fa
culties ; and yet that gate might be opened, if his will did
not resist ; see above, n. 424. That any Man (free from
natural defect) may form a rational conception of truth
when offered, if his will be not averse to it,
Ihave had con
vincing proof. Thus
I
have known bad Spirits, who hav
ing rendered themselves irrational by
a
wilful opposition to
Divine Truths, and by confirming themselves in unbelief,
yet, when compelled to turn themselves towards those
who were in the light of truth, they became intelligent
like the Angels, had
a
clear comprehension of the truth,
and confessed
it
;
but they no sooner returned to them
selves, and the bias of their prevailing love or will, than they
lost all, and declared themselves on the contrary side
:
I
have also heard some infernals confess, that their actions
were indeed evil, and their thoughts contrary
;
but that
they could not resist the ruling passion or bent of their
will; and moreover, that under the influence thereof upon
their minds, they saw evil as good, and talse as truth. —
This makes
it
evident, that they who are in fuUe think
ing from an evil principle [_/« Jalsis ex malot~\ might be
possessed of
a
rational understanding,
if
they were in
a
willing disposition for
it
;
and that the reason why they
are not so,
is
because they love the false above the true,

[falsa brae veris,] as more agreeing with the evil they
have adopted, and which they chuse to follow. It is to
be observed, that to love and to will a thing is the same :
for what a man wills he loves, and what he loves, that he
also wills. As men are thus constituted, to be in a capa
city of receiving the truths relating to tlie kingdom of
God, both in Heaven above, and in his church on earth,
if their wills be accordant thereto; therefore I have been
called to this ministration of confirming the truths in both
kingdoms by rational arguments, that so the errors which
have been introduced by false reasoning, may be discus
sed and refuted by such as are true, if so be that any by
this means may be brought to the knowledge of the truth ;
for to confirm spiritual truths by rational arguments, is
the proper province of those who are in the principle of
truth ; for how should any one rightly interpret or under
stand the Sacred Writings from the literal expression,
without the aid of reason enlightened from above ! To
the want of this qualification in expositors it is owing,
that so many heretical doctrines have been introduced
into the church. (256.)
456 That the spirits of men are real men after their
separation from the body, I can testify to from a daily
experience of many years, and after having seen and heard
them a thousand times : I have also discoursed with them
on the incredulity of many here on earth as to this matter,
and how they who are believers in this respect are consi
dered by the learned as weak and credulous. The spirits
expressed a heart felt grief, that such ignorance should
prevail among men, especially in the Church, saying,
that this incredulity took its rise from the learned, who,

from their gross, sensual ideas of substance, as appropri
ated to material bodies, conceived no otherwise of the
soul than as of mere thought without any visible subject
to inhere and subsist in, and so vanishing into a kind of
volatile subtle asther upon its separation from the Body :
but as the church believes in the Immortality of the soul
on the evidence of the Scriptures, they could not but as
cribe to it some vital property, as of thought, though
they divested it of all human sensitive perception till its
re-union with thq body, according to their doctrine of
the Resurrection at the time of the last judgment. Hence
it is, that when any one thinks of the soul according to
their hypothesis, he has no conception of it as a spirit in a
human form ; and this falls in with the general ignorance
as to the nature of spiritual beings, whether Angels or
others ; whence it comes to pass, that almost all, upon
their arrival in the other world, stand amazed on finding
themselves to be living men, and that they can see, hear
speak, and use their bodily senses equally as in this world ;
see above, n. 74. But when this wonder is over, they
wonder next at the great ignorance in the church concer
ning such a state after death, as also concerning Heaven
and Hell, when they see all after their departure from this
life as truly living, human persons as they were before. :
and as some of them seemed to be totally at a loss to|ac-
count for so important an article of belief not being put be
yond all doubt by visions and supernatural appearances
to men in this world : they were informed, that nothing
was easier to be done, by divine permission, than this ;
but that all such, as had confirmed themselves in a con
trary persuasion, would not even believe their own sen
ses on the occasion ; and moreover, that it was danger
ous to confirm any thing by supernatural evidence to those
who have grounded themselves in falsities (in falsis,) as
alter conviction at first by such evidence, they would
afterwards depart from
it,
which would subject them to
the guilt of profaning such truths

354 A treatise concerning
a man's spirit differs greatly from that of his body, the
latter being derived from his parents, but the former a
correspondent to his predominant affection, of which it is
the signature or image, and which becomes appropriated
to man in the other world, upon the manifestation of his
interior state ; this is his third state. I have seen some upon
the first of their arrival in the other world, whom I knew
by their face and voice ; but when I saw them some
time after, they were so changed, that I knew them not ;
euch of them as were endowed with good affections ap
peared with beautiful countenances, and they whose
affections were contrary looked deformed and ugly ; for
the spirit of a Man rightly considered is the same with
his predominant affection. or love, and his face is the ex
ternal form of it. This change respecting faces in those
who pass from hence into the other world, is founded on
this law, That no dissimulation or counterfeiting is there
allowed, but all must appear to be what they really are,
and consequently express their thoughts in their words,
and their affections and desires in their looks and actions,
so that the faces of all there represent their minds respec
tively. Hence it is, that though a 1 who knew one ano
ther in this world are a ike mutually acquainted in the
World of Spirits, yet it is otherwise in Heaven and Hell
as shewed before, n. 4-27, (258)
458. The faces of hypocrites undergo not their proper
change so soon as the faces of others, and that because
they have by custom contracted a habit of forming their
minds to a kind of imitation ofgood sentiments and affec
tions, and therefore they appear not uncomely for some

time ; but'as the disguise gradually wears off, and their
inmost thoughts and affections manifest themselves, they
appear more ugly than others. The hypocrites here
spoken of, are such as know how to talk like Angels upon
divine sublets, and yet in their hearts exalt nature on
God's throne, and disbelieve all heavenly truths, as ac
knowledged in the church of Christ.
459. It is to be observe d, that the human form of every
man after death is beautiful in proportion to the love he
had-^br divine truths, and a life according to the same,
for by this standard things within receive their outward
manirestion and form, so that the deeper grounded the
affection for what is good, the more conformable it is to
the divine order in Heaven, and consequently the more
beauty the face derives from its influx. Hence it
is,
that
the Angels of the third or inmost Heaven, whose love
is
of
the third or highest degree, are the most beautiful ofall the
angels
;
whereas they whose love for divine thi ngs had been
in a lower degree, or more external than that of the ce
lestial or highest angels, possess an inferior degree of
beauty; and the translucent lustre in their faces, as pro
ceeding; from
a
lesser degree of divine virtue within them,
is
comparatively dim: for as all perfection rises in degrees
from the inward to the inmost, so the external beauty,
to which
it
gives life and vigour, has its degrees in the
same proportion. (*)
I
have seen the faces of some an
gels belonging to the third Heaven, of such exquisite
lustre and beauty as no painter on earth could describe,
(*) That beauty springs from goodness or virtue as its source, or
is
the form of
it,
is
a
doctrine that seems to carry its genuine evidence
with it, and
is
received as soon as proposed to the virtuous mind.
The two last lines of the following well-known epitaph express much
of this idea.
" Underneath this stone doth lie
" As much virtue as could die,
" Which when alive did vigour give
" To as much beauty as could live.
"
Nay, The wiser heathens annexed the idea of pulchritude to the
excellency of virtue
;
whence that saying,
I
think, of Tully
;
« That
K
if
Virtue were to assume
a
human form, all her beholders would be
" ravished with the charms of her beauty."

even to the thousandth part; though a consummate artist
might he able to give us some near resemblance of the
faces of the lowest angels, or such as belong to the first
Heaven.
460. I shall conclude this chapter with mentioning
what has hitherto remained a secret to all, viz. that all
that good and truth [omne bonum etverum) that proceeds
from the Lord, and constitutes Heaven, has a human
form both in whole and in part, even to the least portion
thereof; and that this form has respect to and influences
every one that receives good and truth from the Lord,
and also is the cause of every one in Heaven having a
human form according to his reception of it respectively ;
and hence it is, that Heaven is similar to itself, as well
in every particular, as in its complex, inasmuch as the
same human form that belongs to the whole, belongs in
like manner to every society, and to every individual
angel therein, as has been set forth in four articles, from
n. 59 to 86 ; to which it must here be added, that the
same holds true with respect to every thought in the
minds of angels, that takes its rise from celestial love.
But this doctrine will not easily gain admittance into the
human mind, though it is clearly understood by the an
gels.
THAT MAN, AFTER DEATH, RETAINS EVERY

AND AFFECTIONS, WHICH HE HAD IN THIS

world into the spiritual, which is at the time of his death,
he takes with him all that belonged to him as man, has
been manifested to me by repeated experience : for
when any one enters into the spiritual world, or into the
life after death, he is equally in the Body as before, nor
is there to all appearance, the least difference : but his

Body then is a Spiritual Body, and separate from all the
grossness and impurity of matter ; and as when a spirit-
ual Body sees and feels that which is spiritual, it appears
the same as when a natural Body sees and feels that
which is natural ; so Man, when first become a Spirit,
seems to himself to be as he was in this world, and
knows not as yet that he has passed through Death.—
Man, when become a spirit, possesses every sense, both
external and internal, that he possessed before ; he sees,
hears and speaks as before ; has the same smelling, taste
and feeling as before ; and he has the same appetites and
desires ; the same thoughts, reflections and affections as
before : and he who took delight in studying, reads and
writes as before. In a word, when a man passes from
one life to another, or, which is the same thing, from
one world to another, it is but as removing from one
place to another; for he takes all with him that belongs
to him as a man, so that he cannot be said to have left
any thing behind him but his mere earthly covering: —
Moreover, he takes with him his natural Memory, re
taining all that he ever heard, saw, read, learned, or
thought in the World, from his infancy to his leaving it;
but as to the Memory of such natural objects, which
there is nothing in the spiritual World to revive the ideas
or, that is quiescent, like as in a man when he thinks
not of them, however, these also are again excited
in the mind occasionally, by the Divine permission, to
answer certain purposes : but with respect to this
species of Memory, and the state of it after Death, more
will be said hereafter. Such a state of Man as this
after Death, will appear incredible to the mere sensual
ist, who is incapable of receiving any ideas, even of spi
ritual things, but according to natural: for such a one
being led only by sense, makes no account of any thing
but what he can see with his eyes, and feel with his
hands, as is said of Thomas, John xx. 25, 27, 29. —
Concerning the sensual Man, see above, n. 267, and

the natural World, and that with respect both to his ex
ternal and internal senses, and the affections thereof re
spectively. Thus, for instance, all in Heaven have their
sight, their hearing, and all their senses, in far greater
perfection than when in this World, and also their minds
more abundantly replete with wisdom: for they see by
the light of Heaven, which greatly exceeds that of this
World, see above, n. 126 ; and they hear through the
medium of a spiritual atmosphere, to which that of our
earth is not comparable, n. 235. The comparative differ
ence between these two senses there and here, is as that
of a bright sky to a thick fog, or as the lustre of the me
ridian sun to the dusk of the evening. Now the light of
Heaven, which is divine truth, makes manifest the mi
nutest things to the perception of Angels, and as their
external corresponds to their internal or intellectual sight,
so by mutual influx they co-operate in forming the high
perfection of angelical perspicuity. In like manner their
sense of hearing corresponds to their perception, both in
the understanding and will ; so that in the sound of the
voice, and in the Words of the speaker, thty can trace
the minute particulars of his affections and thoughts; in
the sound, what relates to his affections, and in the words
what concerns his mind or thoughts; see above, n. 234
to 245 : but it is to be observed, that the other senses of
the Angels are not in the same high degree of perfection
with those of sight and hearing, and that because the
latter are the subservient instruments to their under
standing and wisdom, and not so in the others, which,
if equal in powrr, would lessen their preference to intel
lectual delights over and above those of their spiri:ual
bodies, as we find to be the case with men in this world,
who, according to their greater relish and indulgence as
to their grosser senses, have the lesser appetite and sen
sibility with respect to spiritual things. That the interi
or or spiritual senses of the Angels, (viz. such as respect
their thoughts and affections) are more exquisite and per
fect than they had been in this world, has been declared
before, in the article concerning the wisdom of angels,

are in Hell, compared with those that are in this world,
this also is very great; for, in proportion to^hc exceed
ing excellence and perfection both of the external and
internal senses in the Angels, above those on earth, is
the comparative imperfection and degradation of those
that are in Hell ; but of the state of the latter, in what
follows.
462. That Man takes with him all his Memory from
this World into the other, has been fully shewed before ;
I have had much sensible and memorable experience of
this, part of which shall here be orderly related. There
were certain spirits in the other World, who denied the
crimes and enormities which they had been guilty of in
this ; and therefore, to the end they might not pass for
innocent in these matters, all the capital sins they had
committed in the course of their past life, particularly
those of adultery and fornication, were set before them
in order, as they were recorded in their own memory ;
as likewise some others, who, by various artifices ofdeceit
and fraud, had wronged their neighbours, to whom also
their various acts of craft and injustice were enumerated,
many of which were known only to themselves ; and as
these were discovered to them with clearness of evidence,
even to all their circumstances, and also what had passed
in theit own minds relating thereto, they could not but
confess their guilt. There were some who had sat in
the seat of judgment, and suffered themselves to be cor
rupted by gifts and bribes, whose memories were scruti
nized, and all their malversations and inquitious practices
in office produced against them, to the number of some
hundreds, together with the time, place, and the state
of their minds during such transactions; nay, however
wonderful it may appear, the very books in which they
had entered these things were opened, and read to them
page by page. There were others who had seduced and
violated the chastity of virgins, who were brought to the
same trial, and convicted by the evidence of their own
Memory made manifest even as to time, place, conver
sation, and other particulars, nay, the very faces of the

virgins and women they had seduced, were all at once
fully represented, and that sometimes for hours together.
A certain spirit, who in this World had been much ad
dicted to slandering and backbiting, which he had here
studiously endeavoured to conceal from the parties in
jured, was there exposed to open shame by a public re
cital of his calumnies and defamation, and that in his
own words, together with the names of the persons be
fore whom he uttered them. Another, who had deceit
fully deprived a kinsman of his inheritance, was in like
manner judged and convicted ; and, which will appear
very strange, the letters and writings that had passed
between them, were read in my hearing; and I wras
told that they were exact to a word : the same spirit had,
a little before his death, taken away the life of his neigh
bour by poison, which was made manifest under the
following representation : he appeared as digging a hole
in the ground, and having ended his work, a man was
seen to rise out of it as from his grave, crying out to
him, What have you done to me? Upon which he
made a full discovery of the truth, and related how the
poisoner bespoke him in a friendly manner, and handed
to him the fatal cup ; and also what passed in his mind,
and what followed after: upon this evidence the delin*
quent was sentenced to Hell. In a word, all murders, rob
beries, fraudulent devices, and sins and crimes of every
kind, are so evidenced from the memories and consciences
of all offenders to their full conviction in the other
World, and all the circumstances of them set in so clear
a light, that not the least room is left them for evasion or
denial. I have also heard from the memory of a certain
spirit, as viewed and examined by the angels, all that pas
sed in his mind from day to day for a month together,
without the least mistake, and that by a revocation of
particulars as to the perception of the party himself, in as
clear a manner as at the time of the first impression.
These examples may serve to evince, that man retains
the Memory of past things after he has entered upon the
other world ; and that nothing is kept so secret here, as
not to have its manifestation there, and that m\\^ pres-

Lord :

463. When all that a man had done here in his natural bo
dy is made manifest to him after death, then the examin
ing angels inspect his face, and commence their inquest,
which .begins at the fingers of each hand, and is from
thence continued throughout the whole body : as I won
dered at this way of proceeding, I was told, thai as all the
particulars belonging to thinking and willing have their
first signatures in the brain as their subject and begining
to manifestations, so are they continuedx through (he
whole body, and terminate in its extremities; so that a
man is intirely similar to himself in whole and every part,
according to the quality of his will and intellect; thus an
evil man is his own evil; and the derivative good in any
one constitutes the good man. (259) What has here been
said explains what is meant by the Book of Life in the
Word, that all the deeds and thoughts of any one are so
incribed upon his whole man, that when recollected by
his Memory they appear legible as ir. a Book ; and are
imaged in his very person, when he is viewed in the
light of Heaven. I shall here add the following remark
able particular concerning man's Memory, as remaining
with him after death ; whereby 1 am convinced, that
things not only in their general, but also in their most
minute particulars, are never totally obliterated in him : I

Memory of the writer, without the difference of a single
word from those written by the same author in this world ;
which shews, that from the Memory of any other person
many particulars might be collected, which he himself
had forgotten in. this world; and the reason of this was ex
plained to me. viz. from man's having a twofold Mem
ory, (*) the one external or natural, and the 'other inter
nal or spiritual ; and that all the thoughts, desires and ac
tions of a man, and the things that he had heard and seen,
are inscribed on his internal Memory, (260) nay, on the
very members of his spiritual body, as was said before,
never to be obliterated, for that his spirit was formed ac
cording to his thoughts and acts of voliiion : I know that
these things will appear as paradoxes, and gain credit
with few; but they are no less true for that. Let no one
therefore flatter himself, that any one thing which he has
(*) That there may be a memory within a memory, unknown to
that which is outward, will not appear incredible to the attentive read
er when he reflects that our minds are chiefly formed by what we
learned and rend many years ago, little of which we have a distinct
remembrance of ; thus we may have received much instruction, the
improvement both of heart and mind, from books that we do not re
member to have read, nor even the names of which must have been
laid up somewhere. In a word, this distinction of the human faculties
and powers into exterior, and interior, or natural and spiritual, has its
foundation in the nature of man, and opens many mysterious things

ivithout knowing it. Tr.

thought or done in secret will not be known after death,
for all will then be made manifest as in open' Hay. '
464. Although the external or natural Memory remains
with man after death, yet things merely natural are not
reproduced therein in the other life, but only such spiri
tual things as are adjuncts to the natural by corres
pondence, which nevertheless, when exhibited to sight
appear in the same form as in this natural world : for all
'things in the Heavens appear1 in like manner as they do
on earth, though in their essence they are not natural,
but spiritual, as may be seen in the chapter Concerning Re
presentatives and Appearances in Heaven, n. 170 to 176.
But then it must be observed, that the spirit, by means
of that external or natural Memory, derives no use from
those appearances with respect to materiality, time,
space, and other natural properties, as it did in this
world ; as here (when not in the use of his intellectual
powers, but of his external senses only) he thought na
turally, and not spiritually ; but in the other life (where
he is a spirit in a spiritual world) he no longer thinks na
turally, but spiritually; now to think spiritually, , is to
have the mind intellectually or rationally employed; Hence
it is, that the external or natural Memory, in respect to
all things material, is quiescent in the other world, making
no use of any of that nature, but such as he had applied to
rational and intellectual improvement in this. The reason
why the external Memory is quiescent with respect to
material things in the spiritual world, is through want of
things of a similar nature there to excite or reproduce ideas
of that kind ; for spirits and angels converse from their
affections., and the thoughts which spring from them
in the mind ; nor can they express any that are hetero
geneous thereto, as may be seen in what has been men
tioned before, concerning the Conversation of Angels
in Heaven with one another, and also with Man, n. 234
to 257. This may serve to shew, that it is not the mere
knowledge of languages and sciences, as such, but the
intellectual use and improvement from them, that renders
the spirit more rational both here and after death. I have

had furnished their own with a pretty large stock of other
men's sayings ; thus affecting to be rich in what did not
belong to them, as not having any fund of truth in their

of them foolish, not being able to distinguish between
right and wrong in common matters ; and 1 have had con

the scientific way, and had acquired some reputation in
the world by their writings; some of these could reason
about truths, whether they were such or not, and could
also understand them when they turned to those that
were in the light of truth ; but when they turned back
to their own confused dark minds, they would not re
ceive, but rejected them ; and some of them were as void
of true knowledge, as the illiterate vulgar; to so little
purpose of real intellectual improvement had they studied
the sciences. But as to those, who, by an abuse of their

from it against the truths of religion, and to confirm
themselves in unbelief, all they have gained by it is a
trick of disputing and reasoning without rationality,
(however it may pass for such with the world )and of
giving to error the appearance of truth by a falacious
sophistry ; it is impossible for such to attain to a right
understanding, whilst they adhere to the false principles
they have adopted ; for though by the light of truth we
can detect error, yet in the darkness of error we cannot
find the way to truth. Now to oppose divine truths, is

sowed with seed, cannot bring forth fruit without the
fructifying influence of the sun, so neither can the rational
pait in man, however cultivated by natural knowledge,
attain to wisdom without the light of Heaven, which is
divine truth, and the heat of Heaven, which is divine
love. It is matter of great grief to the angels, that so
many of the learned, through the opositions of science,
falsely so called, should so far sacrifice to the pretended
sovereignty of nature and natural knowledge, as to ex
clude all communication of divne light from their jninds ;
on which account it is, that all such in the other world
are deprived of the faculty of reasoning and appointed!
to be in desert places, to the end that they may not
stumble or perplex the simple, good spirits with their
infidel notions and sophistry.
465. A certain spirit seemed muc h disturbed at his not
being able to remember many things that he knew in this
world, and expressed grief for the pleasure he lost there
by : but he was told, that properly speaking he had lost
nothing, but was in possession of all knowledge that could
be of any use to him ; that the things which he no more
remembered did not suit with his present state, and that
he ought to be satisfied that he could now think and speak
more perfectly than before, without having his mind de
praved with gross, material ideas, which could answer no
good end in the kingdom where he was at present, and
where he was richly supplied with all things conducive to
an eternal happy life ; and moreover, that true intellectual
knowledge was so far from being lessened by the removal
of all material images from the memory, that the more the
mind was disengaged from all such natural impediments
of the outward man, the more it was at liberty to make
higher advances in the contemplation of spiritual and hea

of the human brain, to denote the distinction between
them : they who only studied to furnish their memory
here with ideas, whilst they neglected to cultivate their
rational part, their callosity appears of a still harder
texture, and streaked within as with tendons ; they who
in this life stuffed their memory only with falsities and
figments, their callus appears rough and hairy from the
confused heap and lumber therein : they who retained
nothing in their memory, but what was connected with
the love self and of the world, their callus represented a
glutinous tconsistence, bordering upon ossification ; they
who studied to search out the divine secrets by their
scientifical,and more especially their philosophical inves

squared therewith, their memory was represented under
the appeaiance of, as it were, a gloomy cavity which
absoi bed the rr\ys of light, and converted them into dark-

the good of love towards God and their neighbour, and in
the truths of faith ; with them there is no such appearance
of callosity, for their interior memory transmits the rays
of light to the exterior, in which they terminate, as their
proper basis or ground; for the exterior memory is the

468. A few words shall here be spoken concerning the
cultivation of the Rational Faculty in man. Genuine Ra
tionality consists in truths,l not in falses [non in fulsis~\
Now truths are of three kinds, civil, moral, and spiritual:
civil truths relate to judicial matters, and such as respect
public government, and, in a general consideration, justice
and equity; moral truths have relation to the conduct of
life with respect to societies and lesser connections; in gen-
teral, to sincerity and rectitude; and in particular, to vir
tues of every class; but spiritual truths relate to the things
of Heaven, and of the Church on earth ; and in general to
the good of love, and the truths of faith. There as three
degrees of life in every man ; see above n. 267 : the ra
tional part in man is opened to the first degree by civil
truths ; to the second by moral truths; and to the third by
spiritual truths. But let it here be observed, that man's
rational part is not opened and formed merely by his
knowing sucli truths, but by living according to them
known, that is by loving them with a spiritual affection, or
that Section of his spirit, in other words, by loving justice
and equity as such, sincerity and rectitude of manners as
such, and good and truth as such; whereas to love them
only from external regards, is loving them for the sake of
self, for one's own character, honour, or profit; and there
fore such a love, as it terminates in self, gives not a man a-
ny right to the character of rational, as such a one uses
truths as a lordly master uses his servants, viz. for his
pleasure or interest : and where this is the case, they
make no part of Man, nor open so much as the first
degree of life in him, but only have a place in his
memory, like other scientifical ideas, under a material
Form, where they unite with the love of self in mere
animal nature, Hence it may appear how man becomes
truly and properly rational, viz. in the third or highest
degree, by the spiritual love of good and truth, or the
things of I leaven, and its representative the Church; in
the second degree, by the love of sincerity and rectitude ;
and in the first degree, by the love of justice and equity ;
which two last loves become spiritual by influx of the

spiritual love of good and truth from the highest degree-

them its own likeness. (*)
469. Spirits and Angels have also a memory in like
manner as men, and they retain whatever they hear, see,
think, will and do : hereby their rationality increases
to higher degrees of improvement even to eternity, and
they grow in understanding and wisdom through in
creasing, knowledge of truth and good as the human spe
cies here on earth, That spirits and Angels are endowed
wich memory, I have frequently been witness to when
they have given proofs of it by a recital of what they
had Thought and done, both openly, and also in private
company with other Spirits; and I have also known some
simple, good Spirits, with but a moderate degree of the
light of truth, advanced by the gilt of knowledge to
higher degrees ot intellectual light, and then raised up to
Heaven [from the intermediate state ;] but then it must
be observed, that the measure ot such illumination is ac
cording to the kind of affection tor good and truth they
were in during their life in this world, and not beyond it;
for every Spirit and Angel continues to possess the same
kind of affection, or a love of the same quality that he po-
sessed in this life, in which he advances hereafter to higher
and higher degrees of perfection •eternally ; for theie is
no end to perfection there, but every good as proceeding
from an infinite cause, is capable of infinite variation and
increase. That Spirits and Angels continue to advance to
higher and higher degrees of undertanding and wisdom by

v I will punish them for their whys, and reward them
" their doings* Hos. iv. 9. " According to our ways, and
" according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us,"
Zech. \.6. Our Lord, in his predictions of the last judg
ment, makes mention only of works, and declares that
thev who have done good shall enter into life eternal,
and they who have done evil into everlasting fire, Matt.
xxv. 32 to 46; and aho in many other places, where he
speaks of the salvation, and the condemnation of Man.
Now it is evident, that works and deeds are Man's out
ward life, manifesting the principle of life within him.
472. But by deeds and works here, we do not mean
such, considered only in their external form, but accord
ing to what they are internally; for it is allowed by all,
that every act and deed of Man must proceed trom his
thought and will, otherwise it would be no better than
the movement of a piece of mechanism; but what we
call a Man's act or deed, is an effect which has its cause
and principle in the human mind, and may be said to
be the thought and will of a man expressed cr represent
ed in an external form ; consequently, as is the thought
and will, which give being and life to the act, such is
the quality of the act ; if the former be good, so is the act
or deed; but if evil then such is the deed of work like
wise, however they may both have the same outward
form. A thousand men may do the same act, so like in
appearance, as not to admit of distinction, and yet the act
of every one of them may be different in quality through
the difference in the will, or motive of the doer. Thus, for
example, in the act of dealing justly and faithfully with
one's neighbour; nne may discharge this office, as to the
outward part, for the credit and reputation of passing for
an upright Man; another, for the sake of lucre and world
ly advantage; a third, with a view to recompense; a fourth
from some particular attatchment of friendship ; a fifth,
through fear of the law, loss of character or employment ;
a sixth, in order to bring some over to his party; a
seventh, that he may gain credit for an opportunity of
deceiving afterwards to greater temporal benefit : and
so on : but all such apparent honesty and justice, however

372 A treatise concerning
good as to the external act, is- entirely void of
it,
or con
trary to
it,
relatively to the party, and to principles, as
not being done for the sake of truth and justice, but from
the love of self and of the world, to which they sacrifice
even the semblance of virtue, as
it
may serve their turn,
as an imperious master uses his slaves, merely in subser
viency to his interest, and the gratification of his passions,
and turns them off when they can no longer answer
these purposes. On the other hand, the same external acts
of justice and fidelity towards their neighbour are done by
such as are principled
in
these virtues
;
some from the obe
dience ot faith, as being enjoined
by
the authority of
God's Word
;
others from
a
religious conscience
;
some
from charity towards their neighbour, and some from love
to the Lord, having
a
sincere affection for justice,truth,
and goodness or every kind, as proceeding from him, and
partaking of his divine nature. Now as the acts of these
persons are from the source of
a
good internal principle,
so are they properly and truly good works
;
for
it
is
the
quality of the thought and will, as observed before, that
detennins their distinction and kind, and without which
they are no better than mere mechanical movements.
Thus much may suffice to shew what
is
meant
by
deed and
works in the Scriptures.
473. As works and deeds derive their nature from
will and thought, so consequently from love and faith,
and are of the same quality with them
;
now whether
we say the love or will of
a
man, or the faith or thought
of
a
man,
it
amounts to the same, for what he loves, that
he wills
;
and what he believes, that he thinks
;
and
if
he loves what he believes, then he wills and does
it
ac
cording to his power. That love and faith appertain to
the willing and thinking, and are not extraneous to
them,
is
allowed by all, as the will has its fire from love,
and thought its light from faith, so that to think wisely
is
to have the mind or thoughts enlightened by the truths
of faith. Thus every wise man thinks and wills the
truth, or, in other words, believes and loves it. (261)

474. But we are to observe here, that it is the wiU
that properly constitutes the man, and thought no far
ther than as it issues from the will, and that deeds or
works proceed from both ; or, which comes tq the same,
that love constitutes the man, and faith only so far as it
springs from love, and that works proceed from both ;
consequently that will or love is the man himself, for
that which proceeds belongs to the source or principle it
proceeds from : now to proceed from a thing, is to be pro
duced by it in a proper form or mode of operation, for
the sake of manifestation. (262) It is an obvious conclu
sion from the premises, that what is called faith, separated
from love, has no reality of faith in
it,
but
is
only
a
notional thing void of all spiritual life
;
in like manner,
works, that proceed not from love, have no virtue or life
in them, and consequently
.
are dead works; and as to
and understanding, n. 803, 10122
;
and that, because his will
is
the
recipient of good, and his understanding of truth, n. 3332, 3623, 9300,'
9930. Whether we say truth or faith,
it
comes to the same, because
they are correlatives, like good and love, n. 4353, 4997, 7178, 10122,
10367. Hence
it
follows that the understanding
is the recipient of
faith, and the will of love, n. 7178, 10122, 10367. And as the under
standing of man
is
receptive of faith in God, and the will of love to
God
;
so man,
by
faith and love, may be joined to God, and he that
is capable of being joined to God, by love and faith, cannot die eter
nally, n. 4525, 6323, 9231.
(262) That the will of man is the essence of his life, as being the
receptacle of love or good
;
and that his understanding
is
the exist
ence (form) of his life from thence, as being the receptacle of faith
or truth, n. 3619, 5002, 9282. Therefore, that the life of the will
is
the principal life of man, and that the life of the understanding
is
de
rived from thence, n. 585,590,3619 — 10109, 10110, as light issues
from fire or flame, n. 632, 6314
;
consequently Man
is
Man from the
will, and its derivative understanding, n. 8911, 9069, 9071, 10076,
10109, 101 10. That every one
is
amiable and estimable for the good
that
is
in his will and understanding jointly
;
and that to have
a
good
understanding and no good will,
is
a
contemptible character, n. 8911,
10076. That the condition of a man after death
is
according' to the
state of his will and mind (or understanding) as formed thereby, n»
9069,9071,9386,10153. That therefore the condition of man after
death
is
according to his love and faith resulting therefrom
:
and that
matters of belief called faith, which are not joined with love, then va-
. nishinto nothing, as not being in nor of the man, n. 553, 2364, 10153.

3 7 * A treatise eoncein mg
whateve appearance of life they may have from an evil
love and a false faith, it is in Scripture deemed and stiled
Spiritual Death.
475. It is farther to be noted, that the whole man
stands represented in his deeds or works, and that his
willing and thinking, or his love and faith, which are
the principles of his inner man, are not complete till they
are imaged in the works of his outward man, as being
the ground or limit in which they terminate ; and with
out such termination or fixedness, they are but vague,
uncertain things, without residence or body. To think
and will without acting, where power is not wanting,
may be compared to a candle shut in a colse vessel, where
it is soon extinguished ; or to seed sowed in the sand,
where it loses its prolific virtue, und perishes •, whereas
to think and will, and thence proceed to act, is like the
same candle set in a proper place diffusing its light around
it,
or to seed sowed in good ground, where
it
thrives and
ripens into
a
flower or tree. Who does not know, that to
will, and not to act when any one may, is
the same with
not willing; and to love, and not do good when opportunity
serves,
is
not to love, but only to fancy that one loves, and
but as the phantom of
a
thought, which vanishes into no
thing
;
whereas love or will
is
the very life and soul of
action, and forms to itself abody (or makes itselfsubstantial)
by operation
:
just so
it
is
with the spiritual body, or the
body, of
a
man's spirit, which
is
formed of that which pro
ceeds from
a
man's love or will
;
(*) see above, n. 463.
In
a
word, the works of
a
man are the image and likeness
of himself,. (-_>63)
(*) This hint of our Author starts
a
subject to the mind no less im-
portant, than of new and curious consideration, viz. how the Spiritual
body, which we shall have in the other world,
is
formed in this life, from
the affections, qualities, and properties of the spirit acquired here,
even (if the comparison may be allowed) as the shells of certain ani
mals are formed from the juices transpiring from the body of the ani
mal within;
if
so, as

the nature, qualities, and properties of the spirit
ofa Man here, such will be those of his Spiritual Body hereafter. Qu.

Heaven and HelL 375
476. We have here seen what is meant by that life
which remains with every one after death, viz. that of his
love and faith, not only in their principle, but act, conse
quently in deeds and works, as these are the product of
all that appertains to love and faith in every one.
477. There continues a ruling love in every one after
he has left this world, which changes not its particular
kind, even in eternity ; and though he may be said to
have many affections, yet they all have relation to the
principal one, and co-operate with
it,
as many ingredients
in one compound. All the operations of the will, which
accord with the ruling passion, bear the name of loves
;
and these are both intenor and exterior, some of them are
immediately connected with the principal or ruling pas
sion, some mediately, and many of them subservient to
it
different ways
;
but considered collectively, form, as
it
were, one kingdom or government in man
in
their differ
ent offices and places
;
and though
a
man knows nothing
of their order and arrangement in this life, yet something
of
it
is
manifested to him in the other, for according there
to
is
the direction of his thoughts and affections there
:
to
the Heavenly societies,
if
his prevailing love consists of
Heavenly affections
;
and to the infernal societies,
if
it
consists of infernal affections. That all the affections and
thoughts of Angels and Spirits have
a
direction or exten
sion to some particular societies, see above, in the chap
ter concerning the wisdom of the angels, as also in that
which treats of the form of heaven, with respect to the
consociations and communications therein.
478* But what has hitherto been said on this subject
is
of deep consideration
;
in order, therefore, to render
it
ground and limit, n. 634, 6239, 6465, 9216, 9217; and that they
not only successively pass into the outward, but also have therein
a
simultaneous subsistence, and in what order, n 5897, 6451, 8603,
10099. That so Spiritual things have
a
connection and form in na
tural things, n. 9828. That deeds or works are their ultimate form. n.
1033
1.
Therefore to be judged and recompensed according to works
or deeds, means the same as according to all things appertaining to
love and faith, or to the will and thoughts of Man, as these form the
essence and quality of such works, n. 3147, 3934, 6073,8911 1Q33J-,

376 A treatise concerning
a
more intelligible and plain to all, I shall here adduce some
experiences, by way of illustration and confirmation, td
shew, First, that every man's ruling love or will conti
nues after death to be his essential self. Secondly, that
his particular character or quality for ever remains, ac
cording thereto. Thirdly, that every one, whose prevail
ing love is spiritual and heavenly, goes to Heaven ; and
that every one whose prevailing love is sensual and mun
dane, and as such, contrary to all that is heavenly, goes
to Hell. Fourthly, that all faith, which has not heavenly
love for its root, vanishes into nothing after death. Fifthly,
that operative love is that only which continues with him
and constitutes his true life.
479. That every man's ruling love or will continues
afterdeath to be hisesscntial self, has been evidenced to me
by full experience. The universal Heaven is distinguished
into different societies according to their different degrees
in the good of love respectively ; and every spirit that is
exalted to Heaven, and so becomes an Angel isfirstcon-
ducted to that society, which is in the same love with him
self; and when he isjoined to
it,
he
is,
as
it
were at home
in his proper self: this he becomes immediately sensible
of, and enters into an intimacy with his friendly associ
ates, when he leaves them at any time to make an occa
sional visit elsewhere,
it
is
with
a
kind of reluctance and
Tie always feels an attraction to the society of those with
whome he
is
in the closest fellowship of the same love.
In this manner consociations are formed
in
Heaven ;nor
is
it
otherwise in Hell, according to their infernal loves.
That both Heaven and Hell consists of societies distin
guished and ranked according to their respective different
loves, see above, n. 41 to 50, and n. 200 to 212
:
and
that
it
is
every one's love that constitutes his proper self
after death, may further appear from hence, that every
thing
is
then removed or taken from
a
Man that docs
not accord with his ruling love: thus all adventitious evil
and faUes
is
removed from the good, as not agreeing
with his governing principle: and every apparent good
and truth from the Man of evil principle that so every
one may be wholy and consistently in that love» which

is the ruling power of his life: and this separation is effec
ted when a spirit advances to his third state, of which in
what follows. Now when this has taken place, the spirit
has always before his eyes the object ofhis love, which way
soever he turns himself: see above, n. 123, 124. All
spirits are led by those who have hold to their affection
even as they list ; and though the former know it they have
not power to resist, but are drawn as with a strong cord :
I have often seen the experiment made, whether they
could resist the attraction, and found they could not..
The case indeed is much the same with men in this
world, who are under a strong influence of the prevai
ling affection,and the leading of others who have hold
thereon: but the same operates still with greater strength
when they become spirits in the other world as then they
are not subject to the counteraction of any other passion,
which may lay a restraint on their inclinations. The thesis
at the head of this article is further confirmed by what fre
quently happens in the conversation of spirits in the other
world. Thus where any one does or says in company what
is agreeable to the prevailing love of some particular spirit,
the latter appears to be of an expanded, pleasant, and
lively countenance; but when any thing is done or said in
opposition to such love, his counienance presently chan
ges, is obscure, and at length becomes totally invisible as
if he were not present. On my shewing some amazement
at this as a thing unknown in this world, it was told me,
that the like thing happened to the spirit of man in this
world, which upon conceiving an aversion to another,
became invisible to him. (*)
(*) This passage is of difficult comprehension, but from other
parts of the Author's writings seems to mean thus, viz. that the spi
rits of men in this life (if they are in good agreement) are visible to
each other, otherwise not : and though this be not known to us here,
whilst we think in or according to nature, yet it is not more to be
wondered at than our spirits, «ven whilst .connected with these bo
dies, should at the same time communicate with Spiritual societies
in the other world without knowing it ; and yet it is founded on nothing
less than scripture evidence, that Spiritual Christians have in this
life fellowship with " the general assembly and church of the first-
"born, and an innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of just
" men made perfect." Heb^xii. 22. 23. Tr,

378 A treatise concerning
That every spirit is one and the same with his ruling love,
is evident from his earnestly coveting and appropriating
to himself all things relative and corresponding, and his
rejecting all things contrary thereto; just as the spongy
root of a plant attracts and imbibes those juices which
favours its peculiar kind of vegetation, and repels the
others ; or as the brute animals are led by a native in
stinct to chuseonly that particular kind of food which is
suitable to their nature; so every love is supported by
that which is congruous to its nature, an evil love by that
which is false, and a good love by truths. Accordingly,
I have sometimes seen good spirits apply themselves to
instruct such as were evil, upon which the latter left them
with speed, and went to their fellows to feast on folly
suited to the tast; and also when good spirits have been
discoursing together upon divine truths to which those of
their own class listened with attention and delight, that
such as were of contrary disposition appeared quite heed
less and unconcerned. In ihe world of Spirits there is an
appearance of high- ways or roads, some of them as lead-
to Heaven, others to Hell, and every one of them to
some particular society therein: the good spirits take
those that lead to Heaven, and to such societies therein
respectively as possess the same particular good love
with themselves, nor do they see the other wavs ; but the
evil spirits take those that lead to Hell, and to such par
ticular societies therein respectively as best suit with their
own depravity and corrupt affections, neither do they see
any of the other ways, or if they do, they go not in them.
These appearances of ways in the Spiritual World cor
respond to verities and falsities [viris el falsis,~\ and ac
cordingly truth and error are signifiied by -ways in the
Scripture. (264) These proofs from experience confirm
what was said before from reason, viz. that every man
after death is one and the same with his ruling love or
will, which are synonymous terms.
264. That way, fiath, street, 8cc. signify truths' leading to good, as

480. Thatman also con 'inuesfor ever in the same will, or
predominant love that he takes with him into the other world,
has been confirmed to me by many convincing proofs ; it
has been granted to me 10 converse with some that lived
above two thousand years ago, whose lives and manners are
transmitted down to us in history ; and they in all things
answered the characters therein given of them, and as to
the ruling passion that influenced their actions ; others I
have conversed with that lived above seventeen hundred
years ago, in like manner characted in history, with
others that lived above four centuries ago, others above
three, and so on; and they were all found to answer the
description given of them, and to possess the same pre
dominant affection as in this life, only with this differ
ence, that their delight was placed in the correspondences
of those things which they were passionately fond of here.
I was told by the angels, that the predominant affection did
not change in eternity, and that because every one was the
same with his governing love, and therefore to deprive a
spirit of that would be to deprive him of his being ; the
angels farther assigned this reason for
it,
viz. that man was
no longer capable of being reformed by instruction after

that the Gospel faith is a sincere affection for the truth
proceeding from that divine love, which is the Lord'3 own
gift.

That the Man who
is
influenced here
by
divine and
spiritual love goes to Heaven; and he who
is
under the do
minion ofcarnal and worldly love without any thing of the
heavely, spiritual life
in
him, goes to Helt, has been evi
denced to me by all whom
I
have seen taken up into Hea
ven, and cast into Hell, all they of the former class being
in the first, and all those of the latter class, in the second of
those loves. Now
it
is
the essential property of heavenly
love to love goodness^truth, and justice for their own sake,
and to be led thereby to the practice of them, which
is
the true heavenly, life, as herein consists the love of God
and of our neighbour, for these duties themselves bear to
us the relation of neighbour
;
(265) but
it
is
the property
of carnal (corporeus) and worldly love to love goodness,
truth, and justice, not for their own sake, but the sake of
self, and as the means of procuring to ourselves the
glory, honour, and gain of this world. All such, as having
no regard to the Lord and their neighbour in what they
do, turn virtue into vice
;
and they appear in the garb of
truth and justice, are inwardly guilty of hypocrisy andde-
(265) That in the highest sense of the word, the Lord, (considered
in his Humanity"!
is
our firojcvnus, or nearest neighbour, as deserving
our love above all things, fiovr to love the Lord,
is
to love all that
proceeds from him, as bearing his image, and consequently all good
and truth, n. 2425, 3419, 6706, 67.11 —8123. That to love good and
truth, as proceeding from him,
is
to live according thereto, and that
this
is
properly to love the Lord, n. 10143, 10153 — 10578, 10648. —
'
That every man and society, as also our country, the church, and in
an universal sense, the whole kingdom ef the Lord
is
our neighbour,
and that to do good to them, according to their different relations,
is
to love our neighbour, n. 6818 to 6824, 81~23. That also moral good
or sincerity, and civil good, which
is
justice, are our neighbour
;
and
to a-:t sin cerely and justly, from the love of sincerity and justice,
is
to
love our neighbour, n. 2915, 4730, 8120,8121, 8122, &123. There-
fore that charity to our neighbour extends through the whole life of
man, n 2417, 8121, 8124. That the doctrine more particularly
in
sisted on in the ancient church, was the doctrine of charity, and that
this constituted
a
great part of their wisdom, n. 24

eeit. As every one's life is thus estimated according to the
quality of hrs love, therefore all, at their first arrival in the
World ofSpirits, undergo a scrutiny with respect to the state
of their affections, and are classed with those of similar dis
positions either for Heaven or Hell ; and after having gone
through their first and second states, are separated so as to
see and know one another no more, for then every particu
lar difference in their loves within becomes signatured ac
cordingly in the form of the body, the features of the
face, and the sound of the voice, so that the exterior
part is a correspondant image and likeness of the interior.
Thus, such as are in corporeal and earthly loves, appear
gross, dark, or black and deformed respectively; but
such' as are in heavenly loves, appear lively, shining, fair
and .beautiful ; nor- is there less difference in their minds
and intellectual capacities, for as the former are stupid
and foolish, so the latter are intelligent and wise : also,
when permission is given to inspect the interior state and
frame of the affections and thoughts of those who are in
heavenly love, some of them appear in the form of a
shining light, some of a flame colour, and such of them as
are nearest to sense, beautifully variegated like rainbows,
whilst the same in such as are of gross, corporeal affec
tions, present a black appearance, and in such as are sub
tle and malicious, a resemblance of a dusky, fiery red
ness, whilst the more external state of their minds ap
pears of a dismal hue and aspect ; for it is to be noted,
that both the inmost and outermost states of the mind,
and its operations in the spiritual world, are at times, by
divine permission, represented by visible appearances. —
These here last mentioned see nothing of the light of
Heaven» for that is to them as darkness, and that so ter
rifying to their inward sight or understanding, as to af
fect them with madness; wherefore to avoid
it,
they hide
themselves in dens and caverns, of
a
depth proportionate
to their degree of false from evil [falsa ex malis."] But
they, on the other hand, who are in celestial love, the
farther they advance into the light of Heaven, the more
clearly they see all things, and the more beautiful do all
things appear to them; and what

erand deeper is their understanding and wisdom. Again,
they who are in gross corporeal affections, cannot live in
the heat of Heaven, which is celestial love, but only in the
heat of Hell, which is the love of unmercifulness to all
that are not obsequious to them ; for contempt of others,
enmity, hatred and revenge, are the elements and comfort
of their lives, whilst they know not what it is to do good
to others from 'any thing of benevolence ; and when they
do any apparent good, it is from an evil principle, and to
an evil end. And lastly, they who are of this class have
no use of respiration in Heaven, for when any spirit comes
thither, he gasps as if in agony ; whereas they who are in
the celestial love, the farther they advance into Heaven,
the more free is their respiration, and the more complete
is their enjoyment of life. From the foregoing observa
tions we cannot but infer, that celestial and spiritual love
is Heaven in Man, as carrying with it the signatures of
all heavenly things; and that gross corporeal, affections
are Hell in Man, as bearing the image and superscription
of all things hellish. Thus much may serve to confirm the
foregoing thesis, That he who lives under the influence of
celestial and spiritual love goes to Heaven, and that he
who is governed by a sensual and earthly love, without
any principle of heavenly life in him, goes to Hell.
482. That no faith abideth with Man, that does not
spring J) om heavenly love. The truth of this has been
manifested to me so abundantly, that were I to relate
the whole of what I have seen and heard concerning this
matter, it would fill a volume ; and from which I can
testify, that they who live to the world and to sense,
without any affection for spiritual things, neither have,
nor can have true faith ; whilst that which passes with
them for such, is no better than natural science, or a faith
of persuasion, which they make subservient to their in
clination and wishes. I have known many such, who
fancied themselves possessed of true faith, who, after some
free communication with such as were really in the faith,
were brought to confess that they had no right faith, and
that mere assent to divine truths delivered in the scrip
tures, was not a saving faith, but only the love of it from

a spiritual principle joined to good life, and a willing obe*
dience thereto : and it was likewise demonstrated to
them, that the persuasion which they called faith, was
but as the light in winter, which being destitute of genial
heat, had not the power of communicating the vital
warmth of vegetation to the frozen earth : and not only
so, but this glimmering light of their faith of persuasion,
when penetrated by the rays of celestial light, is extin
guished; nay, turned into darkness, which so far obscures
and confounds their intellectual faculties, that they be
come, as it were, mad with folly ; and therefore the light
of divine truth from the word and sound doctrine is with
held from them, and they are left to that false judgment
which best suits with their evil life : for there all join
themselves to, and, as it were, incorporate with their own
proper loves, and the delusions that are suited thereto,
and then become haters of the truth, as inimical to the
principles they have adopted. This I can testify to from
the whole of my experience, as to the things of Heaven
and Hell, that those Solifidians, who had professed the
doctrine of being saved by faith alone, after having led
wicked lives, are all in Hell, I having seen several, thou
sands of them cast in thither : concerning which, see my
little work, entitled, Of the last judgment, and Babylon
destroyed.
483. That love in act, or operative lore, is tliat which
remains with Man, and consequently is the proper life of
Man. This proposition follows from what has been here
advanced from experience, as its proper inference ; and
also from what has been said above concerning works and
deeds. Now, love in act or exercise, is the same with
work and deed.
484. It is to be remembered, that all outward acts and
works appertain either to the moral or civil life, and
comprehend all the duties of sincerity and rectitude of
manners relative to the former, and all the duties of jus
tice and equity relative to the latter; and the love they
proceed from as their principle, is either celestial or infer
nal : the works and acts both respecting moral and civil
life are celestial or heavenly if they are done from a hea

have spiritual bodies in the other world, see above n. 73
to 77, and n. 453 to 460 ; and what is signified by Cor
respondence between spiritual and natural things, n. 87
to 115.
486. All the delights belonging to man have relation lo
his ruling love ; for what gives him pleasure, but that
which he loves? and what the greatest, but that which
he loves most ? Now these pleasures are as various as the
different kinds of love, or as many in number as there are
men, spirits, and angels; for the predominant affection is
not exactly similiar in all respects in any two of them;
and therefore it
is,
that no two have exacdy the same face,
for the face
is
the image of the mind in every one, and in
the spiritual world
it
is
a
true index of the piedominant
affection. There
is
also an infinite variety
in
their particular
pleasures and gratifications, as well
in
those that are suc
cessive, as in those that are simultaneous; and yet these
particular different pleasures in every one are all relative
to the governing love, nay, are so many in gredients
in
it,
and as such make one with
it;
and as all particular Delights
in every individual are relative to the predominant affec
tion, so the general kinds of affection in all, both in Hea
ven and Hell, correspond in eich to one universal love,
viz. to the love of the Lord in Heaven, and to the love of
self in Hell.
487. As to the kind and quality of those spiritual De
lights, into which those that are natural and peculiar to e-
very one here are changed after Death, this can only be
known from the doctrine of Correspondences; which
teaches in general, that all things natural have their corre
lative spiritual Correspondents
;
and in particular, the
kind and quality of such Correspondents; consequently,
he that
is
an adept in this science, may judge concerning
his own state after Death from the knowledge of his own
prevailing love, and the relation
it
bears to that universal
love before- mentioned, to which the inferior loves are
subservient and relative

firm themselves in their delusion, they call truth; and jet,
were they but willing to take advice from men wiser than
themselves, they might be set right in this matter, but
such willingness is wanting in them : so great is the infatu
ation of self-love, as to shut the ear to the voice of wis
dom. On the other hand, they who are influenced by hea
venly love are receptive ol instruction, and learn to know
both their innate evils, and their propensities to them
from those truths which make them manifest; for by the
light ofc truth shining from the good principle, we may
discover evil, and the false belonging to it; but in the
darkness ofevil we see not the good and its truth ; nay,
all such are as blind men that grope at noon-day as in the
night; nay, like owls, chuse the darkness (267) rather,
than the light; see n. 126 to 134. I have been confirmed
in this, truth by experience communicated from the an

likewise all malignity in the unhappy spirits that are in
the intermediate state or world of spirits, though such
spirits see not their own evils, being so far gone in depra
vity, as not to know what is meant by the good of heaven
ly love, or conscience, or disinterested justice, or to be
subject to the Lord ; but, on the contrary, deny the reali
ty of these things. What has been laid down in this arti
cle, is to the end that man may examine himself, and from
the things he most delights in come to the knowledge of
his predominant love, and thereby be able to form a judg
ment (according to his skill in the doctrine of Corres
pondences) concerning his future state.
488. How the pleasures of this life in every one are
changed after death into their figurative representations,
may be learned from the doctrine of Correspondences;
but as that science as yet remains a secret, I shall illus
trate the matter by some examples. All that are in the
principle of evil, and have confirmed themselves in oppo
sition to the truths of religion, and more especially by their
disbelief of the scriptures, all such avoid the light of
Heaven, and hide themselves in dark caverns and the
clefts of rocks, and because they hated the truth, and
loved the false, which corresponds to darkness, as repre
sented by such hiding-places, (268) wherein they take
pleasure ; nor is it otherwise with the insidtuus and sub
tle, who had addicted themselves to the deceitful works
of darkness in this world, who, in like manner, hide
themselves in caverns and obscure corners in the other,
where they wisper to one another in the dark ; for such
sort of concealments correspond to those clandestine do
ings in which they had taken pleasure. They who had ap
plied themselves to the study of the sciences, merely for
and of their dependence on their infinitely perfect Creator and Bene
factor ; but in order to this end, they must be conscious, at times, of
such imperfection, defect, or evil, and yet in a way consistent with
their happiness and free will.

They who had indulged themselves in making false ap

correspond to that kind of profanation. (269) They that
Were infected with a sordid avarice have their abode in

ravish their minds and senses with unspeakable delight ;
whilst the same light, which illuminates their intellectual
part with the knowledge of divine truths, images to their
external sight the things that correspond thereto. That the
appearances in the Heavens are outward visible signs of
things inward in the Angels appertaining to their faith and
love, and consequently to their understanding and wis
dom, has been shewed before in the chapter concerning
-Representations and appearances in Heaven, n. 170 to

Angels, n. 265 to 275. As I have produced some exam
ples from experience, in confirmation of the matter in
hand, and to illustrate what had been advanced doctrin-
ally, so I proceed to farther instances in respect to those
correspondent heavenly pleasures, which succeed to the
natural ones in those who live here in celestial love. They
who have loved divine truths and the sacred writings with
an inward affection, or from the affection of truth, have
luminous dwellings in the other world upon eminences
which have the appearance of mountains, where they con
tinually enjoy the light of Heaven : they are strangers to
the darkness of our nights in this world, and are blessed
with a perpetual spring, whilst delightful scenes of mea
dows, cornfields and vineyards, are represented to their
view; the splendor, like as of precious stones, beautifies
their houses, and through windows, as of pure chrysta),
they behold ravishing prospects ; and whilst these exter
nal objects entertain the outward sense, so do they at the
same time convey an inward delight to their minds, from
the correspondent relation they bear to divine truths ; for
the truths of the Word, which such are enamoured with,
correspond to corn-fields, vineyards, precious stones,
windows and chrystals. (270) They who, upon their first

vine, and though the objects themselves are without them,
yet the Divine Correspondence that is in them, does by
a secret influx affect their minds and fill them with bles

smile and play : of which, see above, n. 270. They who
have taken pleasure in studying the sciences, so as to
render them subservient to useful intellectual improve
ments, and to impress their minds with a deeper sense
of di'ine things, the rational delights of such are chan
ged in the other world into spiritual delights, as sublime
attainments and discoveries in the knowledges of good
and truth : such have their dwellings in beautiful gar
dens, curiously adorned and diversified with flowers,
plar.ts, trees, walks, porticos, &c. The flowers and trees
also are varied every day, so affording fresh entertainment
to the senses, and gratifying both the mind and eye with
new successions of delightful scenes, whilst at the same
time they exhibit instructive emblems of divine things,
from which, by their skill in the doctrines of Correspon
dences, they continually draw fresh supplies of matter
for their spiritual intellectual improvement and delight.

speakable pleasure to their intellectual sight. Their houses
glitter with adamantine splendor ; and 1 was told that the
walls thereof were as chrystal, and of like transparency,
(exhibiting also fluent representations of divine things
with unceasing variety) and that because such transparen
cy corresponds to a mind in illustration from the Lord,
and totally freed from all shadow of doubting, and from
every impurity from the love of natural things. These,
and innumerable other things, are related by those who
have been in the [third] Heaven ; and moreover, that
they have seen and heard these things which none else
ever saw or heard. Such as had acted with openness and
simplicity, and made no secret of their thoughts, as far as
the relations of civil life allowed of
it,
strictly adhering to
the rules of truth and justice from a divine principle, they
appear in Heaven with lucid faces, representing, as
it
were, hi visible forms, the thoughts and dispositions of
their minds, whilst their speech and actions express the
reality of their affections
;
and therefore they are beloved
above others: whilst they are speaking there seems to be
as
it
were, obscurity on their countenances; but when
they have done, what they have delivered appears legibly
and in full light signatured on their faces
;
and as the
things about them correspond to those within them, so do
they represent them in so striking
a
likeness as to make
them plainly understood by others. Such spirits as had
been accustomed to subtlety and clandestine dealings,
avoid coming neaf them, and are seen to creep away like
serpents, as soon as they spy them. Such as held adultery
in horror, and lived chastely in conjugal love, stand
in
the heavenly order and form above others, and therefore
appear
in
beauty and the bloom of youth with particular
distinction
;
the delights appertaining to their love are
inexpressible, and go on increasing to eternity, for all
the joys of Heaven communicate
by

392 A treatise concerning
gel in particular: see above, n. 366 to 386. In a word,
the delights of those here mentioned are not to be descri
bed in words : but what has been said of the porres pond
ing delights enjoyed in Heaven by those who have lived
here in celestial love, falls very far short of their num
ber.
490. Thus much may suffice to shew, that the plea
sures of every one in this life become changed after death
into such as correspond to them in the spiritual world,
the principal love- continuing the same in every one to
eternity ; whether, for instance, it be that of conjugal
love, the love of justice, sincerity, goodness and truth,
the love of scientific knowledge, the love of intellectual
knowledge and wisdom, and so on ; and the pleasures
which flow from them, as streams from their fountains,
continue with them in like manner, but are augmented in
proportion to rhe difference between natural and spiritual.
OF MAK'S FIRST STATE AFTER DEATH.
491. THERE are three States which Man goes through
after Death, before he enters into Heaven, or Hell ; the
first respects his exterior part ; the second his interior;
and the third is his State of final preparation. These States
Man passes through in the world of Spirits : however,
there are exceptions, as some are immediately after Death
taken up into Heaven, or cast into Hell; of the former
class are they who are regenerated, and so prepared for
Heaven in this world, and that in so high a degree, as to
need only the putting off all their natural impurities with
their bodies; these are immediately carried by the Angfls
into Heaven, and some such I have seen so conveyed
thither within an hour after their departing this life. On
the other hand, such as have been internally evil, under
the mask of externally apparent goodness, and so have
filled up the measure of their iniquities by hypocrisy and

deceit, using the cloak of goodness as a means whereby
to deceive others; these are immediately cast into Hell ;
and this I have seen to be the case with some within an
hour after their Death, and in particular one such who
had been an hypocrite and deceiver above others, cast in
thither with his head downward, and his feet upward;
and others in a different manner. There are also some
who are committed to caverns immediately after their
decease, and so separated from others in the World of
Spirits, but afterwards released; and remanded thither
by turns ; such are they who, under civil pretexts, dealt
fraudulently with their neighbours: but the fore-men
tioned are very few compared to the many classes of those
'who are detained in the World of Spirits, in order to their
preparation for Heaven or Hell, according to the estab
lished order of Divine GEconomy.
492. As to the First State before mentioned, or that
which respects the exterior, this, Man enters upon imme
diately after Death. Every one's spirit has belonging to
it properties exterior and interior ; the former are those by
which he governs and accommodates the corporeal func-
tions in this world, more. especially ths face, speech, and
bodily gestures, according to his social connections ; the
latter are proper to his will and free thoughts, which are
seldom made manifest by the face, speech, and outward
behaviour, Man being accustomed through education
and example to counterfeit friendship, sincerity and be
nevolence, and to conceal his true thoughts even from hi».
intancy. Hence it
is,
that so many learn the external
practice of morality and good manners, however differ
ent they may
in
reality be within, and so, mistaking cus
tom for principle, know not themselves nor enter into
any examination concerning the matter.
493. The First State of Man after Death nearly resem
bles his last in this life, and he
is
much the same in the
external operations of his mind; nay, he still retains the
like lace, speech and inclinations, and also the like dis
positions ;-with respect to moral and,civil life, insomuch,
that he knows no other than that he
is
still an inhabitant
of this world, unless he seriously reflects on^the things

him by the Angels on his resuscitation, of his being a Spir

n. 450. Thus one life
is
progressively continued to
another, and death
is
only the passage between them.
494. As such
is
the State of Man's spirit immediately
after his departing this life, he
is
consequently known in
the other world by such as weie his friends and acquaint
ance in this, not only from his face and speech, but also
from the sphere of his life, and that on the first approach.
When any one there thinks intensely of another, and
is
impressed in his mind and memory with his likeness, and
certain particulars of his life, (having at the same time
a
strong" desire to see him,) the person so thought of becomes
immediately present to him, as
if
sent to him; and this
comes to pass from the nature of the Spiritual World,
where thoughts are mutually communicated at any dis
tance, and where space
is
very different from what
it
is
here; see above, n. 191 to 199
;
by which means such as
pass from hence thither are readily known by their friends,
relations, and acquaintance
;
and they converse and associ
ate together after the manner of their former connections
;
I
have often heard their mutual congratulations on the
occasion of these meetings. It
is
common for husband
and wife to meet thus, and to abide together for
a
longer
or shorter time, accordingly as they agreed in this world;
but
if
they had not lived together in conjugal love, which
is
an union of minds from
a
heavenly principle, after some
short stay they are separated: but
if
they had lived in
variance and hatred,
it
is
not unusual for them to break
out into strife and quarrelling, even to fighting
;
but, never
theless, they are not totally separated before they enter
upon their Second State, concerning which hereafter.
495. As the life of men newly become spirits
is
so like
to their natural life
in
this world, and as they are at first
strangers to their new state, without knowing any thing
more of Heaven and Hell than what they have learned
from the letter of Scripture, and their preachers
;

as before, they find themselves urged by a desire of know
ing -what and where Heaven and Hell are : upon which
they are instructed by their friends in things relating to
eternal life, and are conducted to various places, and differ
ent societies, and some into cities, gardens, and beautiful
plantations, and more particularly to see magnificent
buildings, as such external objects suit with the present
external state of their minds. Then they are led to inspect
-those interior sentiments and ideas, which they had in this
life concerning the state of souls after Death, and concern
ing Heaven and Hell, not without indignation to think of
their own past ignorance, and also that of the Church in
relation to these important subjects. Almost all in the
World of Spirits are desirous to know, whether th y -hall
go to Heaven or not, and the greater part judge in favour
of themselves as to this particular, especially such as had
lived by the external rules of morality and civil ob'igatiou
here ; not considering that both good and bad do the same
to outward appearance, as also do many good offices to
others, and in like manner go to church, hear sermons, and
bear a part in the public worship; not reflecting that these
external acts, and this outward form of worship, avail nothing
in themselves, considered separately from the disposition
and principle of the worshipper, and that it is the interior
or inner man that stamps the character and value upon the
outward work and form ; but scarcely one in a thousand
knows what is meant by the interior, and even after being
taught it place all in the words and bodily service; and
such is the greater part of those, who at this day pass from
the Christian world into the other life.
496. The new comers are tried as to their qualities by
the good spirits, and that according to various ways; for
in this their First State, the bad speak and act, to ap
pearance, like the good, and that from having kept up
an outward moral deportment in the world, in conformi
ty to the laws of government and the rules of society, to
preserve character and the praise of men, for the sake of
worldly advantage : but the internally bad spirits are par
ticularly distinguished from the good by this among other

without them, but give little attention to inward and
spiritual truths. They are also known from turning-
themselves frequently to certain points of the compass, and
from taking the ways that lead thereto when left alone,
both of which are marks in the other world of the particu
lar kind of love that influences and directs them.
497. All spirits, on their leaving this world, are indeed
in fellowship with some particular society either in Hea
ven or Hell ; but so only in their inner man or ground,
which is not manifested to others, whilst they are occupi
ed in the exterior mental faculties and exercises, [such as
border on the senses or outward life,] for external things
cover and hide what is internal, especially in those who
are rooted in evil, but hypocritically good in the outward
life; but afterwards, when they enter upon their Second
State, the outward is quiescent, and what was inward is
made manifest.
498. This First State of Man after Death continues to
some for days, to some for months, and to others for a
year, but rarely for longer to any one, though to all dif
ferently, according to the agreement or disagreement be
tween their interior and exterior; for in the spiritual world
they must be brought into Correspondence and consent;
as it is not allowed there for any to think and will one way,
and to speak and act another, but every one must hi? an
express image of his thoughts and affections, or must ap
pear outwardly as he is inwardly; and therefore the exter
nal state or province of the spirit must first be so manifest
ed and regulated, as to serve for a correspondent plane or
ground to the internal.

the more external functions of
it,
as exercised in his First
State, are then quiescent or dormant. Whoever carefully
attends to the lives, words and actions of men, may soon
find .that every one has both his exterior and interior
thoughts and intentions; thus for example, the Man of
civil connections and manners forms his judgment of oth
ers by what he knows of them by character and conversa
tion; and though he should find them to be far otherwise
than men of probity and worth, yet he does not speak
and behave to them according to his real sentiments of
them, but with something of seeming respect and civili
ty
:
and this
is
still more strongly exemplified in the be
haviour of persons addicted to dissimulation and flattery,
who speak and act quite contrary to what they think and
mean
;
and also in hypocrites, who can talk of God, of
Heaven, and Spiritual things, and also of their country
and neighbour, as
if
from faith and love, when at the
same time they have neither the one nor the other, and
love none but themselves. This evinces that there are
thoughts in the same mind of two different complexions,
the one interior and the other exterior, and that
it
is
com.
mon for men to speak from the latter, whilst their feal
sentiments in the interior are contrary thereto
;
and that
these two arrangements of thoughts are of distinct and
separate apartments in the mind, appears from the pains
such persons take to prevent those that are interior from
flowing into the exterior to manifestation. Now, man was
so formed
by
his original creation, that both these were
as one by correspondence and consent, as
is
the case now
with the good, who both think and speak what
is
good
and true
;
whereas in the evil the interior and the exte
rior are divided, for they think evil, and speak good,
thus inverting the order of things, whilst the evil
is
in
nermost, and the good outermost —the former exercis
ing rule over the latter, and using its services for tem
poral and selfish ends, so that the seeming good which
they say and do
is
corrupted and changed into evil,
however the undiscerning may be deceived by its
outward appearance. On the other hand, they who

398 A treatise concerning
God's creation, whilst the good in their interior flows
into the exterior of their minds, and thence into their
words and actions. This is the state in which man
was created, and thus they have communication with
Heaven, and have the Lord for their leader. Thus much
may serve to shew, that man thinks from the two distinct
grounds, the one called the interior, the other the exteri
or-; and when we speak here of his thinking, we include
likewise his faculty of willing, as his thoughts are from
his will, neither can they exist separately.
500. When willing and thinking are considered under
*heir particular distinctions, then by the will is also to he
understood the affection or love, with the particular plea
sures annexed to
it,
as these also have relation thereto as
the subject in which they inhere; for what
a
man wills,
that he loves and takes pleasure in, and so reciprocally,
what he loves and takes pleasure in, that he also wills;
and by thought
is
meant that opperation of the mind by
which
a
man confirms and fixes his affection or love,
it
be
ing the form of the will made manifest in the light of the
understanding. This form of the will may be consider
ed under various relations to the Spiritual World, and
is
properly the spirit of
a
man.
501.
It
must be noted, that man
is
to be estimated ac
cording to what he
is
inwardly, and not according to
what he
is
outwardly only, and that because his interior
things appertain to his spirit, which
is
the proper life of
Man, and
is
that which animates his body
;
and therefore
accordingly as Man
is
in his interior, such he remains for
ever; whereas exterior things, as appertaining to the body
and its senses, are separated after death, so much of them
only as remaining (and that
in
a
quiescent, dormant state)
as may serve as
a
plane or ground to his interiors, as was
shewed before in the article treating of the Memory re
tained
by
Mun after Death. Hence
it
may appear what
properly belongs to Man as himself, and what not; thus
for example, the good that bad Men speak and do from
their exterior thought and will,
is
not their proper own,
but only that which proceeds from their inner . Man, or
the ground of the heart.

502. After that Man, now become a spirit, has pone
through his First State, which is that of his exterior
thoughts and will, he passes into his Second or interior
Stare, and this he enters upon insensibly, which resem
bles that of a Man in this world, who, finding himself at
liberty from every restraint and dissipation, recollects him
self, and enters into the most secret recesses of his soul.
Now in this state of introversion, when he thinks freely
from his inmost disposition and affections, he is properly
himself, or in his true life.
503. When a spirit is in this state of thinking from his
will, consequently from his ruling affection or love,
thought and will in him appear so much one and the
same, that he seems only to be in the exercise of the lat
ter : and the case is nearly the same when he speaks, only
with this difference, that then he is not without some little
fear of betraying the whole of his affections, and that
through a habit contracted in this worid from the re
serves practised in ordinary conversation.
504. All without exception enter into this state in the
other world, as proper to spirit, for the former is assumed
and practised in accommodation to society and transac
tions in this world; and therefore, though it remains with
man for some time after death, yet it is not long contin
ued in, as not being suitable to the nature of a spirit, for
the following reasons : First, Because a spirit thinks and
speaks from the governing principle of life without dis
guise ; see article Concerning the Speech of Angels, n.
234 to 245 ; nay, the same is the case of Man in this
world, when he enters into his inmost self, and takes an
intuitive view of his inward Man, in which kind of sur
vey he sees more in a minute than he could utter in an
hour. Secondly, Because in his conversation and deal
ings in this world, he speaks and acts under the restraint
of those rules which society has established for the main
tenance of civility and decorum. Thirdly, Because man,
when he enters into the interior recesses of his spirit,
exercises rule over his outward ceconomy, prescribing
laws thereto, how to speak and act in order to conciliate
the good will and favour of others, and that by a con

400 A treatise concerning
strained external behaviour. These considerations may
serve to shew, that this interior state of liberty is not only
the proper state of the spirit of a man after death, but
even in this life.
505. When a spirit has passed into his second or inte
rior state, it then appears outwardly what manner of man
he had been in this world, as he now acts from his pro
per self; thus, if he had been a wise and good man be
fore, he now manifests still higher degrees of rationality
and wisdom in his words and actions, as being freed from
those corporeal and earthly embarrassments which had
fettered and obscured the inward operations of his mind,
whereas the bad man evidences greater folly than before,
for whilst in this world he fashioned his external beha
viour by the ru les of prudence, in order to save appear
ances; but not being under the like restraints now, he
gives full scope to his insanity. A bad man that apes the
manners and behaviour of a good one, is nothing better
than a neat vessel well covered, but replete with filthincss ;
and answers to that comparison of our Lord :
" Like un-
" to a whited sepulchre, which indeed appears beautiful
" outward, but is within full of dead men's bones, and
"of all uncleanness," Matt, xxiii. 27.
506. All who in this world lived uprightly, and pre
served a good conscience, walking in the fear of God,
and in the love of divine truths, applying the same to
practical use, seem to themselves as men awaked out of
sleep, and as having passed from darkness to light, when
they first enter upon their second or interior state ; for
they think from the light of pure wisdom, and they do all
things from the love of goodness ; Heaven influences
their thoughts and affections, they are in communication
with angels : and they love and worship the Lord from
the very principle of life ; for they have entered into the
holy of holies, in which the true worship consists, and is
to them and in them a service of perfect freedom : such is
the state of those hereafter, whose life here has been ac
cording to the Gospel of Christ. But very different is the
condition of those, whose lives have been contrary there
to, and therefore have denied the Lord in their works,

however they may have confessed him with their lips ; all
such, when they enter upon their interior or second state,
and so are set free from outward restraints, appear as in-
fatuated and mad in all they 6ay and do; for being now
under the -full uncontrolled, dominion of their evil lusts
and passions, they commit all iniquity with greediness, as
contempt of others, mocker)', hatred, revenge and blas
phemy, and some of them are crafty and malicious to a
degree exceeding belief ; in a word, they appear wholly
destitute of rationality, though wise in their own conceits :
they are sometimes, during short intervals, restored to
their external state, together with the remembrance of
these flagrant enormities ; at which some of them seem
ashamed, and confess their madness ; but others are void
of all shame. Some of them also appear indignant, that
they are not suffered to continue in their former exterior
state ; when it is told them, that this would prove to their
detriment ; for that they would go on to commit the
same things in a clandestine manner, would do evil under
the appearance of good, and defraud the simple-hearted
by their dissimulation, till by degrees they waxed as
wicked openly as they were inwardly, and so encreased
their condemnation and wretchedness.
507. The spirits of this state appear outwardly such as
they were inwardly whilst in this world, and also public
ly declare the things they had spoken and done here in
private, and endeavour to repeat the same without regard
to decency and character ; and this is permitted, that they
may be known to the angels for what they are. Thus,
their hidden things are made manifest, and their secret
things declared openly, according to those words of the
Lord :
" There is nothing covered that shall not be re-
•*
vealed ; nor hid that shall not be made known. There-
" fore, whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness, shall be
"heard in the light, and that which ye have spoken in
" the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house -
" tops.'' Luke xii. 2, 3. " I say unto you, that every idle
" word that men shall speak, they shall give account
" thereof in the day of judgment." Matt. xii. 36.

402 A treatise concerning
508. The condition of the evil in this state respective
ly cannot be described in a few words, as every one's in
fatuation there, is according to his particular concupis
cence : from the following examples some judgment may
be formed of the rest. They who had been absorbed in
self-love, so as not to attend to the good uses of their re
spective offices and functions, but discharged them only
with a view to their own estimation and honour, appear
more stupid than others ; for in proportion to the degree
of self-love in any one, is his distance from Heaven, and
co nsequently from wisdom : but they, who to the evil of
self-love, had added crafty devices, and by means thereof
advanced themselves to worldly honours, associate them
selves to the worst of spirits and addict themselves to the
magical arts, which are profane abuses of the divine order,
by means of which they molest and vex all that pay them
not honour ; the practising of insidious wiles, and to kin
dle strife and hatred, yield them the highest pleasure ;
they burn with revenge, and long for nothing more than
to tyrannize over all that submit not to their will ; and all
these wicked passions they gratify as far as their evil as
sociates give them assistance ; nay, so far does madness
hurry them on, as to make them wish to scale Heaven,
either to subvert the government of the Holy kingdom,
or to cause themselves to be worshipped for gods there
in. Such of this class as were of the papal church, are
more mad than the rest, as vainly thinking that they have
power over Heaven and Hell, and can forgive sins at
pleasure ; some of these arrogate to themselves divine ho
nour, and exalt themselves into the place of Christ.—
Such diabolical persuasions spread darkness and distrac
tion upon their minds ; they are indeed similar in both
the foremen tioned states, but in the latter of them they
totally loose their reason. Concerning their madness and
their eiibuing lot, something shall be particularly said in a
little piece, intitled, Of the Last Judgment and Babylon
destroyed. As to those who in this world ascribed all
creation to nature, and so in effect denied a God, and con
sequently all divine truths, such herd together in this state,

soning, and giving him divine honour. I have seen some-
such in their conventicle worshipping a magician, holding
conference concerning nature, and behaving more like
brute beasts than human creatures, and among them .some
were dignitaries in this workl, and had the reputation of
being learned and wise, and others of a different character.
From thus much we may gather what they are, the interior
of whose minds is shut against divine things, as their's is,
who receive no influx from Heaven through looking up to
God, and a life of faith. Now let every one judge from
himself, what sort of creature he should be, were he to
live without regard to laws both human and divine, and
without all external restraints arising from fear in respect
to life, character, honour, advantage, and the pleasures re
sulting therefrom. However, the madness of those before
mentioned is so far restrained by the Lord, as not to break
all bounds of uses, for even a use arises from every one of
them, evil as they are ; for in them the good spirits see the
odiousness of evil, and what man is, separate from the
divine direction and leadings. Another use
is,
that all
evil
is
so collected into
a
visible body, and that all apparent
good and truth, which served them only for
a
cover to
their malignity,
is
taken from them, and they so left to
their own evil, and the false issuing from their evil, that
they may be totally disqualified for all society with the
good, and fitted for their own place
;
for no one
is
allotted
to his portion in Hell, before evil and the false from evil
have taken full possession of him, and that because
it
is
contrary to the laws jof the other world to have the mind
so divided, as to think and speak one way, and to have the
will set the contrary way
;
but every evil spirit must think
and speak there from the false of his own evil or proper
affection, as he did in this world when under no constraint
or restraint; and that because the affection or love
is
the
same with the will
is
man's proper self or nature, which
is
formed according to his life in this world, and never
forsakes him, as
it
is
not to be reformed by anv power of
thinking, or knowledge of the truth in the next".

404* A treatise concerning
punishment. Now punishments in the world of Spirits
are manifold, and they are inflicted on all alike without
respect of persons, had he been a king, or the meanest
servant; for sin carries its suffering with it by necessary
conjunction, and consequently, he that is in evil is also
in the pain of evil ; nevertheless, no one suffers there for
the evils he had committed in this world, but for those
which he is in, loves, or does in the other ; for it comes
to the same, whether we say they are punished for past or
present sins, as every one after death returns to the state
of his own life, and consequently into all the evils belong
ing to it : for the spirit of a man is the same that it was
in the body, see n. 470 to 484. The reason of inflicting
punishment here, is because the fear of it is the only means
of suppressing evil in those on whom exhortation, in
struction, conscience, or regard to character have no in
fluence, but they act solely from the bent of their nature,
which can only be awed and restrained by punishment. —
On the other hand, the good spirits suffer no punishment,
and though they had done evils in this world, yet they
make no part of them in the other; and it is also given
them to know, that the evils which they had done, were
of another kind or nature, and not of set purpose and de
termined opposition to the truth, nor from any other bad
disposition than what was derived to them from their pa
rents, or which they were instigated to commit by the
urgency or some blind passion, when their externals were
not influenced by their internal principles.
510. Every oae betukes himself to that society to which
his spirit belonged in this world, for every man in this
life is joined to some society in spirit, either to an infer
nal or celestial one, tire bad to the former, and the good
to the latter, see n. 438 ; and after some successive ex
periments m ith respect to other societies after his depar
ture hence, he is at last conducted to his own, which he
joins himself to. An evil spirit, when in his interior state,
gradually turns towards the particular society he belongs
to, till at length he fully faces
it,
and that before his state
of preparation for
it
is
quite finished
;

Some evil spirits in this their second state go in and out
of Hell by turns, but appear not to be cast down in the
manner just now mentioned, as when in full preparation
for their final abode there : they have also sometimes,
when in their external state, a sight of the society they
had fellowship with in spirit, when in this world, to give
them to understand, that they belonged to the infernal
kingdom even in this life, though they were not at the
same time in a like condition with those that are actually
in Hell, but only with those that were in the World of
Spirits on their way to it; of whose condition, in respect
to the infernal spirits, something shall be said hereafter.
511. The separation of the evil from the good spirits
takes effect in this second state, for they are both together
in the former ;state i for spirits, whilst they are in exter
nals, are in the same condition of state as in this world,
the bad with the good, and the good with the bad ; but
it is otherwise when they are in their internals, and so
entirely under the dominion of their own nature and will.
This separation takes place after various- methods, but
commonly by carrying them round about those societies,
with which they had communication by good thoughts
and affections when in the first state ; and then round those
which they had induced to believe, by outward appear
ances, that they were not in the principle of evil. It is
an usual way for them to be led round the other societies
in a wide circle, and to be exhibited to the good spi
rits in their proper form and aspect, on which the good
spirits all turn their backs to them, and the evil spirits on
their part, do the same to them, with their faces towards
such infernal societies as they respectively belong to, and
are appointed for ; not to mention many other ways by
which this separation is conducted.

406 A treatise concerning
OF THE THIRD STATE OF MAN AFTER DEATH,
WHICH IS THE STATE OF INSTRUCTION FOR
THOSE THAT GO TO HEAVEN.
512. THE Third State of Man, or of his spirit, after
death, is the State of Instruction, which is appointed for
those that go to Heaven, and become Angels ; but not
for those that go to Hell, as such are not in a capacity
of Instruction, and therefore their Second State is their
last, and answers to the Third in others, as it terminates
in their total change into that prevailing love which con-
stitutes their proper principle, and consequently into a
conformity to that infernal society with which they have
fellowship. When this is accomplished, their will and
thoughts flow spontaneously from their predominant
love, which being infernal, they can only chuse the evil
and false, and reject all that apparent good and truth
which before they had adopted, solely as means subser
vient to the gratification of their ruling passion. On the
other hand, the good spirits are introduced from their
second into their third State, which is that of preparation
for Heaevn by the means of instruction ; for none can
be qualified tor Heaven, but through the knowledges of
spiritual good and truth, and their opposites, evil and
false, which can only come from previous instruction. —
As to good and truth in a civil and moral sense, com
monly called justice and sincerity, these may be learned
from the laws of nations, and from conversation in virtu-
ous company ; but spiritual good and truth, as ingrafted
principles in the heart, are only received by the teach
ings of a divine light : for though they are literally set
forth in the Scripture, and the doctrines of the Christian
churches founded thereon, yet they only gain the efficacy
of a vital principle trom a celestial influence manifesting
itself in a conscientious obedience to the divine laws, as
promulgated in the written word, and that in respect to
the divine authority of them, and not from selfish and

worldly motives; then a man is in the heavenly life, or
in Heaven, even whilst in this world. But in order to
this, he must first be taught, that there is a God, a future
state, a Heaven and Hell; and that God is to be loved
above all things, and his neighbour as himself; and that
the Holy Scriptures are the rule of faith, together with
other rudiments of the Christian religion, without which
a man attains not to that spiritual understanding and
will, which are the proper recipients of the heavenly
infl ux and divine wisdom. Thus the spirituality of re
ligion is by vital influence from the Lord, which, when
received into the heart of man, enters even into all his
moral and civil virtues, and sanctifies them also, as being
done from and to the Lord ; so that all the common of
fices of life, proceeding from this divine source or prin
ciple, are so many effects of the spiritual life; and as
every effect partakes of the nature of its efficient cause,
so it makes one with it.
513. The angels appointed for instructors are from
several societies, but chiefly from such as are in the north
and the south, as their understanding and wisdom more
particularly consists in the distinct knowledges of good
and truth. The places set apart for instructing are to
wards the north, and are various well-ordered, and divi
ded according to the particular classes of the disciples to
be instructed in heavenly things, that so all may have
their proper portion according to their particular capaci
ty and genius, respectively. These places extend far and
wide in a circular form, and thither are led by their di
vine guide, the good spirits that are to receive their In
struction, after having passed their Second State in the
World of Spirits, but not all of them, as some of their
number received their full instruction in this world, and
so were here prepared for Heaven by the Lord, and are
conducted thither another way; some immediately after
Death, some after a short stay with the good spirits in
the World of Spirits, in order to be defected and puri
fied from some impurities contracted in their thoughts
and affections from the honours and riches of this world ;

and some not till they have undergone vastation*, which
is performed in subterraneous places, called the lower
earth [terra inferior'] where some pass through a very
painful discipline ; such in particular as had confirmed
themselves in gross errors, whilst at the same time they
led good lives; for false doctrines confirmed by reason
ing into a belief of them, stick very close to the mind,
(*) The words vastatio and vaatcti, as here used by our Author,
with respect to good spirits, and more particularly in his large work,
intitled, Arcana Cxlestia, arc difficult to translate by any singic words
in the English language : those" of purgation, and purification, or the
physical terms, depuration, and defecation, come the nearest to what
lie means by vauta£io?i, viz. a kind of refining or separating discipline,
by which a spirit whose radix or principle is good, is cleansed from
those stains and pollutions, which it had contracted in its passage
through this word, and as yet hinder its fitness for Heaven. Some
who liave a bigotted aversion to every doctrine indiscriminately that
is held by the Romish Church, and not adopted by the Protestants,
will doubtless be offended at one so nearly bordering upon Purgatory
as this before us; but that we cannot help: it is for men of more en
larged minds to seek out and embrace truth wherever they find it;
nor is a pearl the less valuable, because it has lain among rubbish.—
In a word, it is the doctrine of a Romish Purgatory, as stuffed with
absurd figments, and the gainful superstitions introduced into it by
the Priests, that is to be rejected, and not that of a state of purifica
tion after death, which, as it is consonant both to the goodness of God
and to our most rational ideas of a future happy state, so it is no less
comforting to the mind of the serious Christian : for few, I think, are
so well satisfied with their condition and state of acceptance at the
time of their departure hence, as to think themselves entirely meet
for the kingdom of Heaven; so it cannot fail to minister great conso
lation to their spirit, to believe that the Lord hath appointed a state
hereafter, wherein every thing that hinders shall be removed out of
their way (o the heavenly inheritance. But the word vastation (vat-
(alio J relates also to «vil spirits, and in such application of it, signi
fies the divesting them of that seeming good which they might derive
from mere outward nature or practice, and used as a cover to the
predominant evil principle within, and therefore to be done away by
this vastation or separating discipline, that they may be wholly in
their own proper principle, and so fitted for the kingdom to which
they belong. Thus both the good and the evil spirits become entire
ly their real selves without any heterogeneous mixture. N. B. The
word vaslatio will be translated by that of vastation in the following
note, and where else it may occur ; but as the particle vastali literal
ly translated vastattd would sound more harsh to an English ear, the
word divested will be used in its place.

where these instructions are held ; and therefore, when
they are seen from Heaven, they appear from thence as
a Heaven of a lesser form; they extend in length from
east to west, and in breadth from south to north, but
appear ot less breadth than length. The order or classes
is as follows: foremost are they who died infants, and
were educated to their early part of youth in Heaven,
and after such their first tuition in infancy, are appointed
hither by the Lord for instruction in knowledge. Be
hind these are the places for the instruction of those who
died adults and who in this world were in the affection
of truth from the good of life. Next to them are such as
had professed the Mahometan religion, led a moral good
life, believed in one God, and acknowledged the Lord
for his prophet, who, after death, finding no help to be
had from Mahomet, go to the Lord, and worship him,
and acknowledge his Divinity, after which they are in
structed in the Christian religion. Behind these, more
to the north, are the places appointed for the instruc
tion of the various Gentiles, who had led a good life ac
cording to the religion they professed, and that ftmn a
conscience agreeing thereto, and so practising wrnt is
just and right from an inward law, and not merely in
obedience to civil institutes. All such are soon brought
to the knowledge ot and belief in the Lord, through the
means of instruction ; and the more so, as it is a funda
mental of their creed, that God is visible in a human
form. These aiV? the greater number [of the appointed
for Heaven] and the best of them are from Africa.
515. But all are not instructed in the same manner, nor
by angels of the like societies: such as were educated in
Heaven from their infancy, are instructed by angels of
the two interior Heavens, as not having imbibed danger
ous errors [falsa] from false principles of religion [ex
Jiilsis religionis,] nor defiled the spiritual part with the
pollutions of worldly honours and riches. They who died
in their adult state, are, as to the greater part of them, in

piency in their present state. The Mahometans are in
structed by angels, who had been of the same religion in
this world, and afterwards converted to the Christian;
and the Heathens in like manner by their angels.
5 1 6. All instruction there, is by way of doctrines drawn
from the' written Word, and not from the Word itself
separately from the doctrinal form. Thus for example ;
The Christians are instructed from such heavenly doctrines
as are most adapted to the internal or spiritual sense of rhe
Word ; others, as the Mahometans and Gentiles, from
such as are most adequate to their capacity and genius,
and may lead them to the spiritual life by the way of a
Christian morality in a sort conformable to the best and
most sublime of their own moral precepts.
517. The way of conveying Instruction in the other
World diners from that oa earth, inasmuch as truths there
are committed, not to the memory, but to the life; for
the memory of spirits is in. their life's principle, and they
receive and imbibe only what is conformable thereto, for
spirits are so many human forms of their own affections.
As the nature of spirits is such, therefore they are con
tinually inspired with an affection for truth for the uses of
life ; for the Lord has so ordered
it,
that every one should
love the uses that accord with their particular gifts and
qualities
;
which love
is
likewise heightened by the hope
of their becoming angels; for in Heaven all particular and
singular uses have relation to the general use or good of
the Lord's kingdom, and may be considered as so many
parts of one whole, so that the truths which they learn are
both truths and the uses of truths conjunctly
;
thus the
angelical spirits are prepared for Heaven. The affection
or love of truth for the purposes of use
is
insinuated into*
them many ways not known in this world, more particu
larly by various representations of uses under such delight
ful forms as affect both their minds and senses with un
speakable pleasure, so that when any spirit
is
joined to the
society for which he was prepared, he then enjoys life most
when he
is
in
the exercise of its proper uses (273) Hence

it may appear, that not the ideal knowledge of truths, as
things without us, but an implantation of them, in the af
fections and life for the purpose of uses, is that which qual
ifies for the kingdom of Heaven.
518. There were certain spirits who had flattered
themselves in this world, not only with the expectation
of going to Heaven, but also of being received there
with particular marks of distinction on account of their
learning, and for their great scientifical knowledge in the
Scriptures and the doctrines of the several churches, sup
posing this to be wisdom, and that such as themselves
were meant by those in Dan. xii. 3. " They that be wise
" shall shine as the brightness of the firmament.'' These
were consigned over for examination, whether their
knowledge resided in their memory only, or was carri
ed also into practicle use. There were others who pos
sessed a genuine affection for truth, for the sake of spi
ritual use and improvement, who, after they had passed
through their course of Instruction, were received into
Heaven, and given to know the cause of splendor there,
viz. that it was divine truth (which is the essence of light
in Heaven) in use, which use is the plane or ground that
receives tne rays of that light, which it converts into va
rious splendors ; whereas they whose knowledge resided
only in their memory for the purposes of reasoning
about truths, and oftentimes to confirm their belief in
error ; such not being in the light of Heaven, but self-ex
alted through their pride of knowledge into a fancied su
periority above an»els; these, in order to cure them of
their vain conceit, were introduced into the first or low

light struck them with dimness ; their minds were per-
turbated and confused, and they gasped for breath like dy
ing persons; and upon feeling the heat of Heaven,
(which answers to heavenly love) they were tormented with
inward excruciating pains, and immediately cast down
from thence ; so learning by experience, that it is not
knowledge, but life influenced by knowledge, that qual
ifies for the angelical state; whilst the former, considered
in itself alone, is but as a foreign plant ; but the latter as a
tree of life in the midst of paradise.
519. After that the angels are duly prepared for Hea
ven in the places before described, which comes to pass
in a short time, as spiritual minds are of quick compre
hension, they are then clothed in angelical garments,
which, for the most part, are white as of fine linen, and
conducted to the. way which leads up to Heaven, and
delivered to the guardian angels there ; after which they
are received by other angels, and introduced to different
societies, where they partake of various delights ; after this
every one is led by the Lord's guidance to his particular
proper society, and this by various ways, sometimes di
rect, sometimes otherwise, not known to any of the an
gels, but to the Lord only. Lastly, When they are come
to their own society, their inmost thoughts and affections
[interiora illoruni] open and expand themselves, which
meeting with the like returns of cordial sympathy from
their fellow angels, they are immediately known and re
ceived by them with a joyful welcome,
520. I am led here to mention a memorable particular
concerning the ways which lead from the places before
mentioned to Heaven, through which the novitiate angels
pass thereto : there are eight such, two from every place
of instuction, the one of which ascends to the East, the
other to the West : they who are appointed to the Lord's
celestial kingdom [the third Heaven] take the eastern
way : but they who are appointed to his spiritual king
dom [the second Heaven,] take the western way. The
four ways which lead to the former kingdom are beauti
fully planted with olive and other fruit-bearing trees of va
rious kinds; the other four leading to his spiritual kingdom.

vines and laurels correspond to the affection of truth and
its uses ; and olives and fruits to the affection of good
and its uses.
THAT NO ONE IS APPOINTED FOIt HEAVEN BT
AN IMMEDIATE [ARBITR VRIOUS] ACT
OF MERCY.
521 . THEY who are not rightly instructed concerning
Heaven, and the Heavenly life in man, are apt to sup
pose, that admission into Heaven is by a particular grant
of favour and mercy in behalf of certain persons who are
in a particular belief, and have the privilege of a peculiar
election through our Lord's intercession in their behalf;
and some, that all men may be saved by an arbitrary will
without respect to meetness or qualification ; nay, even
the very devils : but all such are utter strangers to the
nature of man, viz. that he is identically one and the same
with his life's principle, and that this is one and the same
with his predominant love, not only with respect to his
interior, but also to his exterior life, for the latter is only
the external form, in which his will and intellect manifest
themselves in visibility and effect ; and therefore, that
man is wholly according to his love or ruling passion ; see
above, n. 363 : nor do they understand, that the body
lives not from itself, but from its spirit, and that the spi
rit of a man is his affection; and that his spiritual body
is no other than his affection in that human form, in which
he appears after death ; see above, n. 453 to 460. Igno
rance, as touching these things, leads many to think that
salvation is nothing more than a mere gratuitous act of
favour and good pleasure, called Mercy, without any
respect to means or qualification.

sion towards all men, to the end that they may be saved,
abiding with every one, and never departing from him ;
and therefore all may be saved, whom it is possible to save,
but that only in way of divine means. These are revealed
to us in the Scriptures, and are called Divine Truths,
teaching us by what kind of life salvation is attainable :
and by these truths the Lord, who is loving to every man,
directs all in the way to Heaven, and imparts to them a
principle of life, provided they refrain from evil, but oth
erwise they are not receptive of his gift, for evil hinders.
This is that pure mercy of the Lord to every one that
walketh not in the ways of evil, and which abides with
him from infancy to the end of his days here, and for
sakes him not in eternity; but not Such an immediate ar-
bitrarious kind of mercy, as some falsely suppose, by
which all may be saved, however unrighteously they had
lived.
523. The Lord never does any thing contrary to order,
for he is himself the fountain of
it,
and the divine truths
proceeding from him are the laws of
it,
by
which he con
ducts the salvation of men, and to which an immediate or
arbitray mercy, with means and fitness in the subject of
it,
would be
a
manifest contrariety. Divine order
is
Heaven
in man, which he had perverted by disobedience to its
laws, or to divine truths; and therefore he must be re
duced by the pure mercy of the Lord by Divine Truths
to the same order from which he had fallen, and as far as
he recovers this state, so much of Heaven he receives
here, and becomes meet to be
a
partaker of its joys here
after; thus he receives all from mere mercy, but not by
an immediate unconditional act of it. (274)

416- A treatise concerning
524. If men might be saved by immediate, arbitrarious
Mercy, then all would be saved, even the devils, nay in
that case, there would be no such place as Hell; for seeing
that the Lord is all Mercy, Love, and Goodness, it would
be nothing less than denying his nature, to say, that he
could save all men immediately if he would but is not
willing; whereas it is declared in his Word, that the Lord
willeth not the death of a sinner, but that all shculd be
saved.
525. The greater part of those, who pass into the other
world from Christendom, retain the belief, that they are
to be saved by an immediate Act of Mercy, and according
ly they implore it; but .upon examination it is found, that
they have no other idea of the happiness of Heaven than
by admission into it as a place of all delights, (without
considering the necessity of preparation and fitness for
it)
thus shewing their ignorance as to the nature of Heaven
and Heavenly joys; upon which
it
is
told them, that the
Lord denies entrance into Heaven to no one, and that
if
they desire
it,
they may not only be admitted, but stay
there
:
accordingly some tliat were so desirous were admit
ted: but no sooner did they enter, and feel the heat of
Heaven, which
is
that love in which the angels are, and
were struck by the influx of the Heavenly light, which
is
divine truth, than they were seized with such
a
heart -felt'
agony, that instead of Heavenly joy they were racked
with infernal pains, and, as
it
were, mad through anguish,
cast themselves down headlong; thus learning, by dear-
bought experience, that the fruition of Heaven, though
it, n. 4219, 4220, 4223—10156, 10472. That man by birth inherits
not good and truth, but only evil and false, and consequently
is
in con
trariety to the divine order
;
therefore he
is
born in mere ignorance
and must be born again or regenerated by divine truths, that so he
maybe restored to order, n. 1047, 2307, 2308—.10286, 10731. That
when the Lord regenerates man, he disposes all things in him accor
ding to the form of Heaven, n. 5700, 6690, 9931, 10303. That all
evil and false
is
contrary to order, and that such as are therein are
governed by the Lord, not as regulars, but irregulars, n. 4839, 7877,
10787. That
it
is
impossible tor any one that
is
in the evil principle
to be saved by an immediate, instantaneous act ofmercy, as this would
be contrary to the divine order, n. 8700.

all from pure Mercy, yet is not from an immediate act
of Mercy separate from the means of meetness, through
preparation, for the Heavenly inheritance.
526. I have sometimes conversed v. ith the angels on
this subject, and told them, that the greater part of those
in this world, who live in sin, in the freedom of conversa
tion concerning Heaven and eternal life, speak of going to
Heaven, as a mere admission into such a place through a
mere act of gratuitous favour, and unconditional Mercy;
and they in particular who lay down faith as the only means
ofsalvation; for having fixed upon this as the fundamental
principle of religion, they pay little regard to life, nor to
those operations of love which constitute the essence of
life, nor to any other means which the Lord has appointed,
whereby to render man a recipient of the spiritual life,
and of Heavenly foys ; and thus having rejected the use
of all preparatory means, they by necessary consequence
from the principle they have adopted, maintain, that God
the Father is prevailed upon, by the intercession of his
Son, to advance some particular favourites to the kingdom
of Heaven by special grants of Mercy. To which the
angels replied, that such a belief was a necessary conse
quence of the Solifidian doctrine ; and as this was the
foundation of their creed, no wonder that from an error,
so far distant from all truth, should proceed such ignorance
among Christians concerning the Lord, concerning the
state of life after death, and the joys of Heaven; or that they
were so little acquainted with the true nature of love and
charity, and the necessity of good being joined with truth,
to constitute the divine life in man, which consisted
no less in the will and its operation than in thoughts
of the mind; and consequently not a persuasion
called faith, separate from love, and the effects of
love. The angels -shew concern for their folly, in sup
posing that true faith can subsist in any one singly and
alone ; as faith separated from its orgin, which is love, is
no otherthan science, ora certain kind of persuation, which
is no better than a counterfeit, of faith, (see above, n. 482)
and makes no part of the life of man, as not being con
joined with love. Moreover, the angels said, that all of

the Solifidian persuasion must necessarily believe, that sal
vation must be by favour of grant, or from immediate,
unconditional Mercy, (separate from the use of means) as
thty know both from the light of nature, and from ex
perience, that sue!) kind of separate faith makes no essen
tial part of life, and therefore that evil doers may work
themselves into the same doctrinal persuasion of their own
salvation with others ; and hence it
is,
that the bad are be
lieved by such to be equally
in
a
salvable state with the
good, prov ided they have but confidence sufficient to ap
ply the merits and intercession of Christ to themselves in
tl
ieir last hour1:, and to rely on an immediate Act of Mercy.
The angels declared, that they had never known any one
that had passed his life in sin, to be made partaker of Hea
venly joy, whatever confidence he might have had in this
World, under the name of Faith, as touching his salvation;
and being asked as concerning Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
David and the Apostles, whether their portion in Heaven
was not by
a
special grant of immediate mercy and favour
;
they answered, that not one of them, but each had his re
ception and portion according to what his life had been in
this world
;
that they knew their place and lot, and that they
were
in
the same degreeofestimationandhonourwith others
of their own class; that th reason of the honourable men
tion made of them in the written Word,
is
because, that in
the internal sense of
it
they were so many typical repre
sentatives of the Lord
in
their several characters and call
ings
;
thus he was represented oy Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, as to his Divinity and Divine Humanity
;
by David
as to iiis Divine Sovereignty
;
and by the Apostles, as to
Divine Truths. Moreover they said, that when the Word
was read by any man, they (the angels) received not the
ideas of the persons representing, (for names enter not
Heaven) but instead thereof so much of the Lord as was
represented by them
;
and therefore no mention was made
of them in the written Word
in
Heaven, (of which see
above, n. 25P) as that Word contains only the inward and
spiritual sense of that which we have
in
this world. (275)

597. That it is impossible for those to receive the prin
ciple of Heavenly life in the other world, who have re
jected and lived contrary to it in this, I can witness to
from abundant experience in many. There were certain
spirits which possessed the notion, that they could readily
receive divine truths after death, as soon as tliey should
be declared to them by the angels, and that in conse
quence thereof, they should believe, and change their
course of life, and become qualified for Heaven. An ex
periment of this kind was made on many who were of
the liffe persuasion to the end they might be convinced,
that ihere is no repentrnce after death ; som of those on
whom the trial was made, appeared to understand the
truths that were announced to them, and also to ad
mit them at first ; but no sooner did they return to their
ruling love or life's principle, than they immediately re*
jected them, and argued against them : and others re»
jected them as soon offered, and would hear no more of
them. There were some in particular, who were de-
sirious to be wholly deprived of that governing love, or
life's principle {vita amoris which they had contract
ed in this worly, and that the angelical life, or life of
Heaven, might be infused insteak thereof: their request,
was granted; but no sooner did the change take effect,
than they lay as dead without any power over themselves.
From these and other means of experience, the single-
hearted, good spirits were convinced, that every one's
Humanity, n. 1893, 4615,6098,6185, 6276, 6804, 6847. That the
name Abraham is not known in Heaven, n. 1834, 1876, 3229. That

420 A treatise concerning
state tibideth the same after death ; and that beyond this
period an evil life cannot be changed for a good one, nor
that which is infernal, for one that is angelical ; because
that every spirit is in every part throughout the snme with
the love that predominates in him, and that a change of
it to its contrary would be to destroy the spirit. The an
gels affirm, that a night-owl may sooner be changed into
a pidgeon or a buzzard into a bird of paradise, than an
infernal spirit into an angel of Heaven. That man conti
nues after death in a state conformable to his life in this
world, see above, in its proper article, n. 470 to 484.—
Thus far may suffice to shew, that no one is made a par
taker of the kingdom of Heaven by an act of immediate,
unconditional Mercy, or without the means and fitness
of a qualifying preparation.
THAT IT IS NOT SO DIFFICULT A THING TO
LIVE FOR HEAVEN AS SOME SUPPOSE.
528. SOME suppose that the spiritual life, or that
which qualifies for Heaven, is extremely difficult; and
that because we are told, that we must renounce the
world, and die to the lusts of the flesh, and live to the
spirit; which they so construe, as if we were to reject all
worldly things, particularly the riches and honours of this
life ; to be constantly exercised in pious meditations of
God, salvation, and eternal life, and to employ a great
part of our time in prayer, and reading the Word, and
other pious books. This they call renouncing the world,
and to live, not after the flesh, but after the spirit ; but
that the truth of the matter is otherwise, I can testify both
from experience, and from conversation with the angels ;
nay, that they who so renounce the world, in order to be
come spiritual, are such, for the most part, as contract a
melancholy and sourness of spirit, which indisposes them
for the reception of heavenly joys ; whereas man, in order
to qualify and form himself for a heavenly life, is to bear

his part in the relative duties and offices of this ; and by a*^
life of morality and a discharge of the duties respecting
civil society, ascend to the spiritual life, as preparatory
for Heaven : for, to live an eternal life separate from the
external, is like dwelling in a house without a proper foun
dation, which therefore necessarily sinks into the earth,
divides or falls into ruin.
529. The life of man, when considered in a rational
view, will appear to be threefold; the spiritual, the mor
al, and the civil life ; and these three are distinct: for,
some lead a civil but not a moral and spiritual life ; some
both a civil and moral, but not a spiritual ; and some, a
civil, moral and spiritual life also ; and the last are they
who live a heavenly life, whilst the other two live only
the life of this world. From this view, it may appear,
that the spiritual life, though distinct,- is not separated
from the natural, or life of this world, but closely con
nected with
it,
as the soul with the body, and
if
separated
from
it,
would be like the house before mentioned
;
for
the moral and civil life constitute the activity of the spi
ritual life
;
and as the will to good
is
the property of the
latter, so the doing good
is
the property of the former;
and
if
this were separated from the other, then the spirit
ual life would consist only in thiiiking and speaking, and
the will would remain solitary and inactive, as having no
outward termination to reflect and display its operations
;
and yet
it
is
the very principle of the spiritual life in
man.
530. That
it
is
not so difficult
a
thing to live for Hea-
ven, as many think, may appear from the following con
siderations
:
Who can say, that he has no power to lead
a
civil and moral life, when every one from his infancy
is
educated to
it,
and may establish his ideas of
it
from \tfhat
he sees around him
in
the world
;
nay. even the bad (if
not abandoned to profligacy) as well as the good, act
it
externally, and to save appearances with the world, for
the sake of interest and character? The spiritual man
does the same, but with this difference, that he has faith
in God, and does
it
not only in obedience to the laws of
society, and of moral obligation, but in obedience to the

422 A treatise concerning
authority of the divine laws ; for as he sets God always,
before him, he has fellowship with the angels in Heaven,
having his inmost or spiritual man open to such commu
nion ; and in this state he is an adopted child, under the
Lord's leadings, even when he knows it not, discharges
all the duties both of civil and moral obligation from a
principle of vital love, and so serves the Lord with his
whole heart. His justice and truth, as to external nviiii-
feslation and form, appear indeed like the same in natural
men, even of the most infernal dispositions, but inwardly
they are totally different : for, the evil say and do the
same things from selfish and worldly respects only -, but
having neither conscience, nor fear of God, were it not
for human laws, and the fear of suffering in character, in
terest or other ways, they would give full scope to their
wicked wills, to commit all iniquity with greediness, as
evidently appears in the other world in such as are of the
like dispositions : who being no longer under such out
ward restraints, manifest openly the malignity that is
within them, turning into mockery all virtue and godli
ness, and holding on the same course to eternity, n. 499;
whilst they who have the divine laws written in their
hearts do all things well, and that more abundantly, as
their liberty and freedom from restraints is the greater
•,*
adding to their goodness wisdom, which
is
ministered
unto them from the Lord by the angels of wisdom, with
whom they are in blessed fellowship. Thus we see, that
the spiritual man may act
in
all the relations, both of mo
ral life as the natural man does, only with this difference,
that with respect to his internal man, or his will and
thought, he
is
in
conjunction with the divine Being.
531. The laws of the spiritual life, as also of the civil
and moral life, are laid down in the ten precepts of the
Decalogue;
in
the first three are the laws of the spiritual
life;
in
the four following, the laws of the civil life; and

The different motives in these two sorts of persons for refraining
from the same things, are well expressed in the following lines:

in the three last, the laws of the moral life. Now, the
mere natural man [of decency] pays an external obedi
ence to these precepts, as well as the spiritual man : thus
he is present at the celebration of divine worship in the
church, hears preachings, and composes his exterior to a
form of devotion ; he refrains from committing murder,
adultery and theft, bears not false witness, and defrauds
not his neighbour of his goods j but in all these things
he has regard only to himself, and to save appearances
with the world, being inwardly the reverse of what he ap
pears outwardly, as having no sense of God in his heart,
playing the hypocrite with the form of religion, and se
cretly deriding things sacred, as only so many inventions
of state policy, to keep the simple multitude in awe and
order ; and therefore, such a one stands in no relation to
Heaven, and being destitute of all spirituality, so neither
can he be said to possess either moral or civil virtue: for,
though he does not kill, yet he hates and wishes venge
ance on all that oppose or provoke him and but for hu
man laws, would execute his wrath upon them, and
therefore is in heart no better than a murderer ; nor is it
from any better principle that he refrains from adultery,
theft, or other crimes and immoralities prohibited in the
Decalogue. Such a one is every man that disbelieves a
God, and has no principle of conscience formed in him
by a sense of religion ; and that this is the case with all
such, appears from like spirits in the other world, who,
being left to their freedom, openly declare against every
thing that is heavenly ; and as they think and act like de
vils, so with them is their everlasting portion : but they
that fear the Lord, and walk in the ways of his command
ments with a pure heart, and faith unfeigned, are after
death brought into their full interior liberty, and into a
degree of wisdom that far surpasses what they possessed
before, their sorrow is turned into joy, and all being di
vine within them, makes all things heaven without them.
So different are these two classes in the other world, who
to appearance, were so much alike, as to the outward
life in this.

424 A treatise concerning
532. It is well known that the thoughts, or intellect,
which is the eye of the mind, receives that direction,
like the eye of the body, which the intention or will
gives
it,
and also takes its delight therein. Thus,
if
the
intention be directed to heaven, the thoughts become
heavenly
;
if
to self, sensual
;
if
to this world, earthly
;
and as the ruling love makes one with the intention, so
from the direction and employment of the thoughts may
be known what any one loves most, and what the interi
or state of his mind
is
with respect to things above, and
things beneath. Such, for example, as love themselves,
and the world above all things, have the inward gate of
their minds so shut to all heavenly influx and heavenly
things, that they see not the truths of religion at all, or so
very obscurely, that they either deny, or understand them
not
;
the things of sense and of this world are all in all
with them, and these are continually suggesting many
gross, impure, or profane ideas imcompatible with hea
venly influx, and the due consideration of divine things.
It
is
the intention or will of man, as observed before,
that directs his thoughts or internal sight, and
if
Hea
ven
is
the object, his whole mind
is
there, from whence
he looks down on this world, as on things beneath him
;
and from the same elevation sees and judges all that
is
evil and false in his inferior nature
;
which he, who
is
des
titute of the same spiritual sight, cannot discover, because
he
is
in
it,
and not above it. Hence we learn from what
sources man derives his wisdom, or his folly, which res
pectively determines his state after death, when he will
be left at liberty, not only to will and think, but also to
act and speak without disguise, according to the ruling
principle within him. Thus much for the distinction be
tween the inward and outward man.
533.
It
is
not so difficult
a
thing, as many imagine,
for
a
man so to live, as might qualify him for the hea
venly inheritance, where he, when tempted to evil, to
stop and reflect that he ought not to consent to
it,
as be
ing forbidden by God's command; some such reflection
[like that of Joseph] often repeated, would beget an ha
bitual fear of offending, by degrees draw the attention to

heavenly things, and open the inward gate of the mind to
the divine influx, whereby it would obtain a full sight of
the deformity of sin. Every one has received power and
freedom so to think and refhet, in order to this process,
till the operations of divine grace should overcome all
the reluctances of the will, excite an abhorrence to sin in
the mind, and subdue the power of it in the soul, till the
man experience the truth of those words of our Lord ;
" My yoke is easy, and my burden is light," Matt. xi. 30.
The difficulty with regard to serious consideration and
reflection, in the first instance, arises from a hasty surren
der of the will to the temptations of evil, till custom in
sining reconciles to
it,
and then begets love for
it
;
and
so the unhappy proficient goes on to excuse; and then to
defend
it
by
every kind of fallacious arguments, till at
last he confounds all distinction of right and wrong, put-
ing evil for good and good for evil. Such
is
the case of
those, who, in the early part of life, rush into evil courses,
like the horse into the battle, and so, losing all sight of di
vine truths, become infidels.

I
had formerly represented to me the way which
leads to Heaven, and also the way which leads to Hell,
in
the following manner. There was first
a
broad way
bearing to the left or north,
in
which many spirits ap
peared as walking
-,
and at
a
distance where the broad way
terminated was seen a large stone, from which went two
ways, the one to the left, and the other to the right
;
the
former was natrow and strait, leading westward to the
south
;
the other broad and spacious, leading obliquely
downwards toward Kell. They all appeared to hold on
their way together, as far as to the great stone
;
but when
they came thither they separated, the good taking the
left hand narrow road leading to Heaven
;
but the bad,
not seeing the stone, fell upon
it,
and received hurt, but
recovering themselves went fast on
in
the broader way
to the fight, leading to Hell. The interpretation of
it
was given to me afterward as follows, viz. that by the
first broad way, in which both good and bad spirits went
together conversing as friends, without any apparent dif
ference between them, are signified those who lived so

alike in ihe way of an external righteousness as not to be
distinguished. By the corner stone at the end of the com
mon bread road, on which the bad stumbled, and after-
wards took the way leading to Hell, was signified divine
Truth, denied by those that walk therein, and in the high
est sense was signified by that stone the divine humanity
of our Lord ; but they who acknowledged and believed
divine Truth, and also his divine Humanity, were conduct
ed in the way leading to Heaven ; shewing hereby that the
principle from which men act, is that which determines the
difference of their states after death ; the thoughts of the
mind proceeding from the heart and will, being repre
sented in the other life by ways; and accordingly in
Scripture, the internally righteous are said to walk in the
ways of the Lord ; and there the quality of spirits is
known by the ways that they are seen to walk in. Whit
has been said above may serve to illustrate those words
of our Lord ;
" Enter ye in at the strait gate ; for wide is
" the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruc-
" tion, and many there be which go in thereat ; because
4*
strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth
"unto life, and few there be that find it." Matt. vii. 13,
14 ;' not, implying that the way is difficult to find, but on
ly that it is sought, and therefore found by few. By the
corner stone before mentioned, seen where the common
broad way terminated, and the two opposite ways took
their direction, is plainly given to understand the meaning
of those other words of our Lord :' " The stone which the
" builders rejected, the same is become the head of the
" corner : whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be
•*broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind
"him to powder." Luke xx. 17, 18. The stone signifies
divine truth, and the stone of rock of Israel, the Lord as
to his divine humanity ; the builders are the rulers in the
church ; the head of the corner signifies where the two
ways meet ; and to fall upon, and be broken to powder,
signifies a denial of the truth, and destruction ensuing
thereon.

austerities of discipline, under the notions of renouncing
the world, and of attaining to higher degrees of purity in
the spiritual life ; but most of these, from having contract
ed a severity, and sourness of mind, contrary to a life of
charity, had rendered themselves unfit for the society of
angels, who are pleasant and amiable, and take delight in
exercising offices of kindness and love towards one-ano-
ther. Besides, they who so devote themselves to a life
of solitude and abstraction from all social relations, are for
the most part deeply infected with conceits of their own
fancied merit, whence they are led to look upon Heaven
as their reward by debt ; so that when they are permitted
to come into the company of angels, and are witnesses to
their joys, (which they ascribe solely to the divine good-
ness) and when they behold their innocent liberty and free
communications, and the pleasure they take in their af
fectionate exchange of good offices, they are offended, as
at things contrary to their strictness of religion; and be
ing not capable of partaking in their joys and delights,
they quit their company to consociate with those that are
like-minded with themselves, and had lived in the same
manner in this world. As to those who affected a sancti
monious show of godliness in their outward religious
forms and mortifications, to pass for saints both here and
hereafter, thinking highly of themselves, and despising
others; they have no lot with saints in the other world,
as having profaned sacred things with the impurities of
self-love; nay, some of them there become so infatuated
and mad with pride, as to fancy themselves gods, and
are so consigned over to such infernal societies as resem
ble themselves. Some are full of subtlety and deceit, who
have also their lot among those who, by various crafty
devices, had bewitched the vulgar with a belief of their
extraordinary sanctity. Many of these were of the Rom
ish religion, and appeared in like form and outward de
meanour, as when in this world; I have conversed, with
some of them in the other. Hence it may appear, that it is

CONCERNING HELL.
THAT HELL IS UNDER THE LORD'S .
GOVERNMENT.
536. THROUGHOUT the foregoing Treatise on
Heaven it has been shewed, that the Lord is the God of
Heaven, (see in particular, n. 2 to 6,) consequently that
the whole government of the Heavens is in his hands ;
and as Heaven and Hell are to each other as two contra
ries in mutual opposition, from the action and reaction of
which results that equilibrium by which all things sub
sist: therefore, in order to the preservation of such equi
librium, it necessarily follows, that he who governs the
one must also govern the other: for, unless the same
Lord were to restrain the fury and madness of Hell, the
equilibrium would be lost, and all would be destroyed.
537. But to say something first concerning equilibri
um. It is well known, that when two things are so in
mutual opposition, that reaction on one side is equal to
action on the other, there remains no excess or superior
ity of power on either side ; so that through such extinc
tion of power by their equality of opposition, they become
subject to the disposal and will of any third agent. Such
is the equilibrium between Hell and Heaven, but not as
betwixt two bodies of equal powers; for it is of a spiritual
nature, viz. of false against true, and of evil against good ;
from Hell proceeds false from the root of evil, and from

"430 A treatise concerning
•Heaven truth from the root or principle of good ; and from
this, equilibrium in spirituals it is, that man's freedom of
thinking and willing arises ; for whatsoever a man thinks
and wills has relation to evil and its false, or to good and
its true ; therefore, when the mind is in this balance, it
is at full liberty to admit the former from Hell, or the
latter from Heaven ; and in this equipoise man stands
by appointment of the great Governor of Heaven and
Hell: but-why this is the case with him, and that he is
not wholly separated from the sphere of evil and false,
- and fixed in that of good and true, shall be spoken of
under its proper article..
538. It has sometimes been given me to perceive the
sphere of false from evil issuing from Hell, as a per
petual endeavour or malignant will [conatus] to destroy
all good and truth, joined to rage and madness at not
being able to effect it ; but this efiux of malice was prin
cipally directed against the Divinity of the Lord, as the
Fountain of all good and truth : on the other hand was
perceived a sphere of truth from good from Heaven op-'
posing and restraining the fury and madness of the for
mer, from whence proceeds an equilibrium. The hea
venly sphere was perceived to be an emanation from the
Lord, though it appeared as proceeding from the angels ;
but the latter could not really be the case, as every angel
knows and acknowledges, that no good and truth ori
ginates in them, but all from the Lord.
539 All power in the spiritual World appertains to
truth issuing from good, and none to false issuing from
evil, and this, because the Deity, who is the source of all
power, is also the source of all good and truth, which
being only in Heaven, and their contraries in Hell, there-
tore to the former kingdom belongs all power, and none
to the latter: see in the articles concerning the first, se
cond, and third state of man, n. 491 to 520 : and that all
power belongs to truth from good, see chapter concern
ing the poiver ofthe angels, n. 223 to 233.

Hell ; and all in the World of Spirits are in this equili
brium, as being, betwixt both : and hence it

men in this world are in the like equilibrium, as being
under the Lord's Government through the ministry of the
Spirits in the World of Spirits ; of which hereafter. Thus
all things are balanced by the wisdom, power, and good
ness of the great Sovereign of the universe, who keeps
Hell within its bounds, and preserves the world from
being destroyed by evil. In this equilibrium stands the
liberty or free will of men.
541. Hell has its distinct societies as well as Heaven,
and as many in number, every society in the one having
its opposite in the other, and that in reference to equili
brium ; and as the societies in Heaven are classed ac
cording to their distinctions as to good and truth, so are
the infernal societies, according to their distinctions as
to evil and false : for, every good has its opposite evil,
and every truth its opposite false, there not being any
thing without its relation to a contrary, by which it is
distinguished both in quality and degree ; nay, this gives
the difference to all perception and sensation. And thus
the Lord disposes and regulates the evil in HelJ into so
cieties of contradistinction and opposition to the societies
in Heaven, for the sake of ordeT and equilibrium.
542. As there is the same number of societies in Hell
as in Heaven, so there are as many different Hells ; for
as every society in Heaven, is Heaven in a lesser form,
(see above, n. 51 to 58) so every society in Hell, is Hell
in a lesser form ; and as in the general division there are
three Heavens, so also three Hells, the lowest of which
is respectively opposite to the inmost or third Heaven ;
the middle Hell, to the middle or second Heaven, and
the uppermost, to the first or lowest Heaven.
543. A word here, as to the administration of the
Lord's Dominion over the Hells, which, in general, is
by a common efflux of divine good and truth From the
Heavens, by which the evil efflux from the Hells is ob
structed and restrained; and also by a special efflux from
each of the Heavens, and from each society therein : and
in particular, they are governed by such angels as are
commissioned to inspect and still the tumults and mad

sent to the infernal societies to reduce them to order by
their personal presence. In general, the infemals are
governed by their fears, and some by those of the same
kind which awed them here; but as these for the most
part wear off by degrees, or are insufficient to influence
them they are chiefly deterred from perpetrating their
wickedness by the dread of suffering for it. Now the
punishments in their state are multifarious, more gen
tle, or more severe, according to their malefactions, for
the most part, they are placed under discipline to such
as are more malignant than themselves, who keep them
under subjection by subtle arts and devices, or by seve
rity and dread of punishment, but are not allowed to ex
tend their severity beyond the bounds appointed. But it
must be observed, that the only means of keeping these
rebellious spirits in order, is the dread of punishment.
544. It has hitherto obtained in the world, as an arti
cle of belief, that there is one certain Devil, who rules
as a king over Hell; and that he was created an angel of
Light, but upon his rebelling against the Almighty, was
cast down from Heaven with his apostate followers; and
this belief is grounded on a literal interpretation of those
passages of Scripture, where the words Devil, Satan, and
Lucifer occur ; whereas by Devil and Satan in those
places is meant Hell ; by the former that Hell which is
hindermost [quod a tergo] and occupied by the worst of
the Devils, called Evil Genii ; and by Satan, that Hell
which is foremost, and occupied by such as are of lesser
malignity and called evil spirits : and by Lucifer, such
are meant as are from Babel or Babylon, who are for
usurping a dominion and power even to Heaven. That
there is no one particular Devil that rules as Chief in the
Hells, may be gathered from hence, that all both in the
Heavens and in the Hells are from the human race, (see
n. 31 1 to 317) in which are myriads of millions from the
creation to this time ; and that every one in the latter, is
a Devil from the same quality, which distinguished his
particular enmity against all that is divine and good when
in this world, see above, n. 311, 812.

THAT THE LORD CASTS NONE INTO HELL,
BUT THAT THE SPIRITS CAST THEMSELVES
INTO IT.
545. IT is a prevailing opinion with many, that God
turns away his face from man, rejects and casts him into
Hell ; in a word, that he is angry with him for sin, and
inflicts vindictive punishment upon him on that account ;
and they confirm themselves in this belief from like ex
pressions in the Scriptures, not considering, that the spi-
titual sense of the Word, which is the true interpreter of
the letter, is very different. Now the genuine Doctrines
of the Christian Church, as founded on the spiritual sense
of the Word, teach us, that God is not inexorable, nor
implacable, neither hath any vindictive wrath, nor casts
any one into Hell : and this all may plainly know, that
read the Scriptures with any degree of divine light in
thtir understandings, as He is there represented as the
Fountain of all good, love, and mercy, and consequently,
that it is contrary to his nature and essence to reject and
cast away any : but contrariwise, that he willeth the
good and happiness of all men, and dealeth with them
according to his infinite love and mercy. They that so
read the Word of God, will not fail to discern therein
that hidden, spiritual sense, which gives light and iife
to the letter, which is written in a sense acccommodated
to our natural capacities, and first rudiments of knowledge.
546. Men of an enlightened understanding, moreover
see good and evil in the same fulness of contrariety and
opposition that Heaven and Hell stand in to each other,
and how all good comes from the former, and all evil
from the latter, (n. 7 to 12) and consequently, that man
is continually drawn to good by the Lord of Heaven, as
well as to evil by the attractiou of Hell ; and that unless
man stood between these two contrary attractions, he
would neither have thought, will, nor liberty, these be
ing the effects of his equilibrium, betwixt good and evil \

consequently, were the Lord so to turn away from man,
as to leave him wholly to the power of evil, he would
immediately cease to be human. This divine influence
extends to every man both bad and good, only with this
difference, that in respect to the former, its operation
consists in withdrawing from evil ; in respect to the latter
in attracting to all good ; and the cause of the difference
is the quality or will of the recipient.
347. It has here been shewed, that the evil which a
jtnan does, is by influx from Hell; and that the good
which he does, is by influx from the Lord ; but by be
lieving (and consenting to it as such,) that the evil which
he does, is from himself, he makes ir his proper own,
and therefore is the cause of his own evil. Evil in man.
[as his choice] is Hell within him : for whether we call
it Evil or Hell, it amounts to the same. Now as far as
man is the cause of his own evil, so far he is his own
leader to Hell ; and so far is the Lord from being charge
able with his destruction, that He does all that divine
goodness can do to deliver him from it, as far as can
consist with his choice and free will. All that be
comes essential in
a
man's will and love, remains with
him after death [n. 470 to 484
;]
he that wills and loves
evil in this world, wills and loves the same after death,
and then
it
is
no longer separable from him
;
and there
fore
it
is,
that he who by choice continues in evil here,
binds himself to Hell, and
is
actually in
it
in spirit, even
in this life, and after death desires nothing more than to
be where his own belov
d
evil may be in its proper pro
vince and exercise
;
consequently, such
a
one
is
cast into
Hell by himself, and not by the Lord.
548. How the above
is
effected shall here be menti

When any one first enters the other world, he
is
received by angels, who do him all kind offices, enter
into conversation with him concerning the Lord, Heaven,
and the angelical life, and instruct him in various kinds
and relations of good and truth

ence with the angels, he desires his dismission ; upon which
they leave him. He then, after some conferences with
others, associates with spirits like unto himself (see above,
n. 445 ;) which done, he turns away from the Lord, and
sets his face towards that particular Hell which he had
fellowship within this world, and where the infernalsare
of the same evil affections with himself. By this we may
learn, that the Lord strives with every spirit to draw
him to himself, by the ministry of angels, and by an in
flux from Heaven ; but that such as are under the do
minion of sin are reluctant to all his gracious means for
good to them, being drawn away from them as by a rope
by their evil propensities, and so voluntarily cast them
selves into Hell. This will seem incredible to most in
this world, from the general idea conceived of Hell ; nor
do those miserable wretches think that they so precipitate
themselves, but only that they enter in of their own accord,
though such of them as enter their dismal prisons under
ardent propensities to evil, appear to the good spirits as
ifthey were cast headlong thither ; and from this appear
ance of precipitation comes the notion of the Lord's cast
ing them into Hell by his Almighty power ; see more
on this subject hereafter, n. 574. Let thus much suffice
to shew, that the sinner's destruction and casting into
Hell, is not from the Lord, but from himself both in this
world and the other.
549. That the Lord, who is the essential good, love,
and mercy, cannot exercise them towards all alike, is
because of the hindrances which evil and false lay in the
way, and so weaken or repel the divine emanations. Evils,
and falses are as so many black clouds, which, by their
interposition between the sun and the human eye, inter
cept its lovely light and cheering influences, whilst the
sun continues the same, all glorious, and strives to dissi
pate the obstructing medium ; nay, transmits, though a
fainter light, through the intermediate veil. The case is
similar in the spiritual world ; the Lord and his Divine
Love are there represented by the spiritual sun, (n. 116
to 140) and the light thereof is divine truth, n. 126 to 140;
the black clouds are theialses. from evil ;

This comparison may represent to us how the Lord is
present to every man, but differenty according to his re
cipiency.
550. Severe punishments are appointed for the evil
spirits in the Spiritual World, to deter them from the
commission of evil ; and the infliction of them appear as
i ftrom the Lord ; but in reality it all proceeds from the
evil that is in them ; for evil and its punishment are inse
parable companions. Infernal spirits wish and delight in
nothing more than to do mischief, and to torment others
that are not under the Divine Protection ; and as all that
offend through malicious wickedness withdraw them
selves from that protection, on such they rush and exer
cise theircruelty. This may beillustratedfrom the adminis
trations in this world, wliere the punishment also follows
its evil. Thus human laws have provided a penalty for
every crime, and which the delincpjent brings upon him
self, only with this differenc, that offences may be con
cealed here, but not in the other life. Thus the Lord can
no more be said to be the Author of the sinner's misery,
than the king, the judge, or the law to be the cause of
the criminal's punishment, ns having nothing to do with
the guilt that entails it upon him.
THAT ALL WHO ARE IN THE HELLS, ARE EV THE
VERY PRINCIPLE OF EVIL* AND IN OPPO-
SITION TO TRUTH FROM THE LOVE
OF SELF, AND THE LOVE OF
THE WORLD.

spective falses, and none in evil and truth conjunctively,

truth by their pastors, and in conversation ; nay, some of
them, by hypocritical appearances in their words and ac
tions, had passed for sincere Christians, whilst at the
same time they had abstained from evil, only through
fear of the laws, human respects or other selfish consider
ations; but in the other world, (where all external mo
tives and restraints are removed) they shew outwardly
what they are inwardly, and that all their knowledge
and practice of truth and good were nothing but specula
tion and immitation, without reality and principle. In
this their internal state, they can no longer speak truth,
or counterfeit good ; but the evil that rules within them,
and exercises dominion over them, manifests itself in all
their words and actions. Every evil spirit is brought into
this state before he is cast into Hell (see above, n. 499 to
5l2;)and this is called Vastation as to good and truth,
(277) which means the reducing any one to his proper
principle, or condition of spirit, and to the free liberty of
acting according thereto; see above, n. 425
552. In this state of man after death, when he is no
longer between man and spirit, as in his first state, (of
which above, n. 491 to 498) but is truly and properly a
spirit, having both face and form corresponding to the
inward disposition of his mind, or, in other words, being
an external type of his spiritual life; in this their third
state the spirits appear to be what they really are at first
sight, and are known, not only by their countenances,
and the torms of their spiritual bodies, but also by their
speech and gestures, for now they are uniformly their
proper selves ; and as there is a mutual communication of
the thoughts and affections in the World of Spirits, so
they naturally turn to and consort with such as are like
(277) That the Evil, before they are cast into Hell, are divested of
all that is good and true, on which they betake themselves to Heil of

themselves, for with them only they have liberty and
true enjoyment. We are to know, that mutual commu
nications in the Spiritual World are according to the con
version of the face, and that they who are in the same
kind of love, constantly front one another, which Avay so
ever they turn their bodies; see above, n. 151. Hence it
is, that all the infernal spirits have their faces averted from
the Lord towards an opposite black spot, that is to them
instead of the Sun and Moon of this world; but that all
the angels of Heaven turn their faces to the Lord, as to
the Sun and Moon of Heaven ; see above, n. 123, 143,
144, 151. From what has here been said it will appear,
that all the infernals are in evils, and their consequent,
falses, and that their sole bent and direction is to the
attainment of their own lusts.
553. All spirits in the Hells, when seen in the light of
Heaven, appear in the several forms of their particular
evils respectively, as so many types or portraits thereof;
for in every one the interior manifests itself in the exte
rior, and exhibits the signatures of his particular distinc
tion, so as to be visibly known to be what he is, by his
fare, by his spiritual body, his speech, and his gestures.
These forms in general, are such as express contempt of
others, and threatening of those that refuse them homage :
forms of hatred and revenge of various kinds; forms of
rage and cruelty, &c. But when such spirits receive adu
lation, homage, or worship from others, their features
soften into a shew of self-complacency and secret satis
faction. It is no easy matter to describe these forms un
der their various appearances, as no two are exr-ctly alike ;
only it must be observed, that among all that are in the
same species of evil in any society, there is one common
ground of similitude ; or, as it may be called, of family
likeness, however it may be diversified in the individuals.
In general, their faces are hideous anrl ghastly, like those
of carcases, some black, some resembling firebrands,
and some deformed and ugly with warts, carbuncles, and
running sores; many appear as having no face, but in the
room of it something ot a visage of hair or bone; and
some only a kind of snout with prominent teeth: their

from anger, hatred, or revenge; for as every one speaks
from his False, so he sounds his voice from his own
Evil ; in a word, they are all so many images of their
particular and proper Hell. It has not been given me to'
see the form of Hell in the whole of
it,
but only
it
has
been told me, that as the universal Heaven resembles in
form one Man, so the universal Hell resembles in form
one Devil, and may be conceived under that image
;
see
above, n. 544; but as to the form of particular Hells, or
infernal societies, it has often been given me to see
it,
for
at the apertures or mouths of those Hells, which are call
ed the Gates of Hell, there for the most part appears
a
monster, representing the general form of those that are
within it; their rage and cruelty likewise are represented
by such horrid images, as
I
am restrained from mention
ing. But
it
is
to be remarked, that though the infernal
spirits appear thus like hideous monsters in the light of
Heaven, yet to one another they appear as Men, and that
from Divine Mercy, that they may not be so abominable
to one another, as they are to the angels. But such ap
pearance
is
all deception, for no sooner does the light of
Heaven appear, than their human forms exhibit them
selves in their real monstrosity, for in that light every
thing appears as
it
is
;
for this reason they shun the hea
venly light as much as possible, and seek to appear in
their own light, which resembles that which comes from
fire coals, or burning brimstone
;
but even this light
is
turned into mere darkness by any influx of that from Hea
ven. Hence
it
is, that darkness and thick darkness are
predicated of Hell, to denote the falsesfrom evils that are
there.
554. Upon
a
narrow inspection into those monstrous
forms of the infernal spirits expressing, as was observed
before, contempt of others, and also hatred and vindic
tive anger towards scuh as did not favour and honour
them,
it
appeared, that they were in general so many
forms of the Love of Self and of the World, and that
their particular differences were but so many derivations
from thence

were their ruling passions in Hell, and were fundamental
in the constitution of it ; and that Love to the Lord and
our Neighbour were the prevailing and constituent prin
ciples of the kingdom of Heaven : and that those two
infernal, and these two heavenly Loves, were diametri
cally opposite.
555. At first I was in wonder how it came to pass,
that the Love of the World and the Love of Self, should
be of so diabolical a nature, as to give such monstrous
forms to such as were under the dominion of these passi
ons ; whereas in this World we are not apt to pass con
demnation on the Love of Self further than it manifests
itself in that eletion of mind with respect to external things,
which we call Pride ; and besides, short of this, the Love
of Man's Self is thought to be a becoming vivacity of
spirit, inciting to a laudable ambition in quest of honour
able employments and offices of public usefulness ; in
which things, unless distinction and reputation were held
to his view, the mind of man would be torpid and inac
tive. Thus the men of this World reason, little consi
dering that the Love of Self considered in its own nature
is of infernal extraction, and that which is the begining of
Hell in man ; which leads to the saying something con
cerning this Love, and to shew how all Evils and their
respective Falses [omnia malo et inde falsa] originate in
it.
556. Self-love is that principle in any one that leads
him to seek his own good only, and that of others no
further than it may be subservient thereto ; nay, such a
one isa mercenary in the whole of his zeal and regards
for his religion, his country, or any human society, and
all his wishes and endeavours for their respective interests
center in views to his own private advantage, honour, or
welfare, and therefore he cannot so properly be said to
love them, as himself in them, for Self is the root of his
Love : and as the root is evil, so is the fruit also. Such a
one may indeed love his children and descendants, and
those who are nearly connected with him by the ties of
consanguinity or interest, and such he calls his own, but
still the matter reverts to the same, for he loves them only

as so many parts of his own dear Self : and the same
holds good in regard to the affection he bears to those
who shew him respect and honour.
557. The odiousness of Self-love will manifestly ap
pear by comparison with its opposite, or that Love which
is celestial, consisting in the love of uses for the sake of
usefulness, and the Love of good for the sake of goodness,
whether a man exercise himself therein in behalf of re
ligion, his country, or fellow-citizens, studying and la
bouring to promote their interest and welfare with all the
sincerity of a cordial affection, and takes pleasure in the
work, without any view to consequences respecting Self.
This is to love God with all our heart, and our neighbour
as ourselves ; and as we do this from the Love which is
from God, so in doing it we glorify him, who is the
giver of every good and perfect gift. But how different
is the man of Self, who, being the idol of his own vanity,
considers others as his slaves, and only estimates them by
the service and worship they pay him ; little knowing,
that so far as he departs from the disinterested Principle
of celestial Love, so far is he distant from the kingdom of
Heaven.
558. As far as any one is actuated by this Divine Prin
ciple of Heavenl" Love in the conscientious and affecti
onate discharge of all the relative duties of religion and
morality, so far is he under the Divine Guidance and
Safeguard whilst the man of Self-love takes the govern
ment out of the Lord's hands into his own, and becomes
a slave to the hereditary corruptions of his nature ; and
as in man through his original depravity, dwelleth no
good thing, so in his unconverted state Evil appears to
him ss Good, and Good as Evil, " because of the blind-
" ness of his heart," loving himself more than God, and
earth above Heaven ; (278) nay, corrupting the very good

442 A "treatise concerning
that he does, by placing Self in the center of
it,
as the
object of his affections. There are certain evil spirits
that dwell in those regions under the Heavens that Ue
between the North and the West, which, with great
subtlety, know how to practise on the minds of virtuous
spirits, so as to give them
a
turn to the selfish and other
bad properties of nature, and this either
by
means of
open flattery, or by artful insinuations into their affections
;
and so far as they succeed in their wicked devices, they
draw, for the time the minds and thoughts of such virtu
ous spirits from heavenly things, darken their under
standing, and call forth and stir up the corrupt properties
of their nature.
558. That the Love of Self
is
opposite to the Love of
our neighbour, will appear from the origin and essence
of both
:
they who are led by the former principle go by
this maxim, "that charity begins at home, and as every
one
is
his own nearest, so he should be his own dearest
neighbour. Thus his love to others originates in Self,
and issuing thence, as from its center, lessens as
it
pro
ceeds, according to the diminution of his interesting
connections, making no account of the wisdom or probity
of others, but only of their subserviency to his own
private ends, and holding all for his enemies that cross
them. Such
is
the corrupt tree of Self-love, and such
the corrupt fruit that
it
brings forth
;
whereas true and-
genuine Love to our neighbour (279)
is
of heavenly ex-
predominant Loves of Self and of the World proceeds Evil of every
kind, n. 1307, 1308, 1321,9348,10038,10742; Such as contempt of
others, enmity, hatred, revenge, deceit, cruelty, n. 6667, 7372, 7374,

and that from these Evils come failses of every
kind, n. 1047, F0283, 10248, 10286.

duty oi Love to our Neighbour, are apt to suppose, that every man

gift of the Lord, communicating itself, like its Divine
Author, to all that are receptive of it :
" It suffercth long,
and is kind ; it " seeketh not its own things ; it beareth

" dureth all things, and never faileth ; and it compre*
" hendeth all the properties of that Wisdom which is from
" above, being pure, peaceable, gentle, easy to be in-
" treated, full of mercy and good fruits, without jmrtia-
"lity, and without hypocrisy."
559. So unbounded is the ambition, so insatiable the
thirst of rule in Self-love, that were it free from all re
straints, and had power equal to its will, it would aim
at the sovereignty, not only of the whole earth, but of
Heaven also. YVhat examples have we of this unlimited
ambition in those greedy conquerors, who, not satisfied
with kingdoms and empires, have aspired after universal
dominions ; and also in Ecclesiastical Babylon the Great,
by her arrogant usurping claims to Divine Authority and
Power. All of this character after death are on the side
of Hell against the Lord and his kingdom ; see a little
piece, Concerning the Last Judgment, and the Destruc-
tion of Babylon.
560. If we figure to our minds a society of such as love
themselves only, and others but for their own sakes, such
a love must appear to us oo other than that of a company
of robbers, who continue in all good agreement and
friendliness whilst they are confederates in their iniquity,
but are no sooner separated than they are ready to exercise
the same viilany on one another, as on strangers. Self-love,

our beneficence towards him is the office of Curistian prudence, n.

where interest is concerned, is the same Principle im
others, however covered with the veil of an external de
corum, as being equally void of justice, conscience,
and religion. This will appear still more evidently from
the infernal societies of this character mentioned here-
after.
561. The inmost thoughts and affections of those
abovementioned being thus turned wholly to Self and
the World, and so from the Lord and the things of his
kingdom, they fall under the power of infection from
their other natural corruptions, and this, because they so
render themselves unreceptive of the Divine Influence,
which can alone subdue their Evil, and renovate their
nature; so impossible it is for those to be helped, who
turn their backs upon the Lord, and wilfully oppose the
corruptions of their nature to the influences of his grace.
Hence it
is,
that in the other world all such turn their
faces from the Lord towards
a
certain dark orb, which
is
to them
a
substitute for the Sun of this world, and dia
metrically opposite to the Sun of Heaven, the representa
tive of the Lord
:
see above, n. 123. Darkness also sig
nifies Evil, and the Sun of this world emblematically sig
nifies the love of self. (280)
562. Such as are absorbed in the love of self, are ad
dicted to the following evils in general
;
contempt of oth
ers, envy, enmity towards those that side not with them
and hatred;
if
against them, revenge, craft, deceit, unchal

aversion to divine things and religious worship, which in
the other life becomes changed into hatred towards them

tidhed, more particulary, if called The Lord, but would
appear agitated with such indignation and fury, as denote d
his wishing to dethrone him ; and sometimes in the rage
of his ambition and pride would wish himself a Devil, that
he might declare open hostility against Heaven. Several
of this class were such as had been devoted to the Papal
authority and power, who become frantic, when they find
that to the Lord alone belongs all power in Heaven, and
none to themselves.
563. Some spirits were seen by me in a region to the
south-west, who, boasting of their having been advanced
to posts ofhonour and authority in this world, claimed by
title of merit the like pre-eminence in the other; and ac
cordingly they were tried by the angels as to their in
ward fitness and qualification for such superiority of sta
tion; but upon examination it was found, that they had
exercised their functions here, not with any view to the
benefit of society, but only to their own private interest :
however, as they earnestly desired some office of distinc
tion they were appointed to be of a council, which had be
fore them a matter of great consequence to determine ;
when it appeared, that they did not enter into the merits
of the case in hand, nor propose any thing tending to
good use and expediency, but were all for determining
things in an arbitrary manner, so as might most conduce
to their own private advantage ; and therefore they were
dismissed from their office, and left to shift for them
selves. They then went westward, where, after several
like receptions, they were told, that their sordid avarice
and selfishness had corrupted their judgment, and de
based their understading, even to stupidity, and they
were no other than mere sensual corporeal beings, and as
such sent to whence they came ; after which they were
seen going about in an abject condition, like men that seek
employment. Thus, it appears, that they who are deep
ly affected with the love of self, whatever show they may
make of wisdom in this world, it is not that " wisdom that
descendeth from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."

understanding ; and therefore in the other life, where they
can no longer draw from their fund of natural memory,
they become more stupid than others^ as being totally ali
enated from the wisdom that is from above.
564. To sum up this matter in brief; These two op
posite Loves, respecting our neighbour and ourselves,
form two governments in the hearts of men. They who
are under the former, wish well to all, seek the good of all,
and study to be useful to their fellow-members of society
in every station and relation both of the religious and
civil life according to their ability, and take delight in
being so employed. They decline not offices of dignity,
trust, and power, but willingly accept them, not for the
sake of the honour, but for the means of greater good and

after the example of the blessed Hierarchs in Heaven,
which in their several orders and degrees of government,
under their Supreme Sovereign, glorify God by exer
cising all the endearing offices of Love towards their fel
low-angels. How different is the case with those that
love none but themselves, seek only their own things,
insensible to the wants of others, and seeking honour and
power, not to promote the interest of religion, virtue, or
of their country, but only for the sake of their private
honour and advantage ? How unfit are such for the soci
ety of angels, and the bliss of heaven, where all is har
mony and happiness, peace and joy, because all there are
in pure, disinterested love. The love of dominion re
mains with eviry one after death ; but as in those who
are principled with the love of their neighbour, it is no
other than a laudable desire of pre-eminence for the sake
of good influence and usefulness, they are advanced to
offices of government in the Heavens, as instruments un
der the Lord for heavenly uses, so that it must be under
stood, that it is not they, but the Lord that governs in
and by them. But as to such as exercised dominion here,
not with any view to the good of others, but solely from
the love of self, and by an arbitrary use of their power,
they have their allotment in the infernal regions, where
they are in the condition of the meanest slaves. I have

tates, in that very condition ; and others of them confin
ed there in very unclean and offensive places.
565. As to the love of the World ; though it be highly
dangerous and pernicious to the soul of man, yet it has
not altogether the same degree of malignity with the
forementioned love, as not standing in the same direct
opposition to all love of heavenly things. It shall suffice
here to observe, that it consists, in the general, in an ea
ger desire after the riches of this world, and to acquire
them by any means, however indirect ; and also in such
a passionate fondness tor them, as alienates the affections
from all love of spiritual things, and from true love to
wards our neighbour, which is of spiritual extraction.—
This love of the World is multifarious in kind ; thus it is
the love of riches, as these may be the means to worldly
honour and eminence of station j or it is the love of Dig
nity and Eminence, as these may be the means subservi
ent to the acquisition of riches ; it is the love of riches, in
order to a fuller gratification of the senses, for ostentati
on, and the pride of life ; or it is the love of riches, for
their own sake, and so the same with avarice. These,
with many others, are the snares and hindrances that the
love of the World lays in our way to Heaven : to guard
us against the dangers and delusions of which is that im

spiritual, but literal sense only ; and accordingly some
have thereby understood material fire, some torment in
general, some remorse of conscience, and others that it
was only made use of to deter men from sin, by the con
sideration of its penal consequence; whilst by Gnashing
of Teeth, they have understood as meant such an actual
sound, or a horror like that occasioned by it ; but these
words, like the rest of the Scriptures, have a more in
ward signification; for though the spiritual things con
tained therein must be expressed by such as are natural,
in accommodation to the natural understanding of man,
yet to the mind that is capable of receiving
it,
they are to
be interpreted according to their recondite and spiritual
sense
;
it
shall therefore here be explained what
is
meant
by Hell Fire and Gnashing of Teeth, as applied to the
sufferings of evil spirits in the other world.
567. Thvre
is
a
two-fold origin of heat, the one from
the sun of Heaven, which
is
the Lord, and the other from
the sun of this world
;
the heat from the former
is
spiri
tual, and in its essence
is
love (see
above, n. 126 to 140;)
the heat from the latter
is
natural, and has not love for its
essence, but serves as
a
receptacle to spiritual heat or love.
That love in its essence
is
heat or fire,

fervour

communicates, first to the mind, an

then to the
body of man, according to its degree and quality, in winter
as well as summer; and also from the increasing heat of
the blood from its influence. That natural heat serves
as
a
receptacle of the spiritual heat, or love appears from
the desire in all animals towards the other sex in the spring
and summer seasons
;
not that this orgasm proceeds from
natural heat any farther than as this disposes their bodies
to receive the spiritual heat (the essence of which
is
love)
from the spiritual world
;
for the spiritual world operates
by influx on the natural, as cause on effect, but not so the
natural on the spiritual
;
and therefore
it
is
a
great error
to think that animal love
is
caused by the natural heat, for
love
is
a
property of life, and all life
is
spiritual; nay, the
whole natural world exists and subsists
by
influx from the
spiritual world. To this all the subjects of the vegetable

whilst the natural heat only does the office of opening and
expanding their seeds and vessels, and of disposing them for
the reception of the genial and fructifying influences of the
spiritual world ; thus joining in concurrent evidence to this
truth, that there are two kinds of heat, the one spiritual,
and the other natural, the former of which is from the sun
of Heaven, and the latter from the sun of this world; and
that by influx from the first, and the co-operation of both,
are produced those visible effects which present themselves
to us. in this natural world. (281)
568. The spiritual heat in man is his vital heat ; for
as was said before, its essence is love.' This is the heat
which is signified by Fire in the Word ; love to the
Lord and our neighbour by the heavenly Fire and the
love of self and the world by the Fire of Hell.
569. Both infernal and celestial love originate from the
same divine principle, but the former becomes infernal
only from the will and disposition of the recipient ; for
all influx from the spiritual world is according to the
condition or state ofthe subject receiving it, in like manner
with the heat and light from the sun of this world, which
operating on odoriferous plants and flowers, produces the
most grateful and delicious scents
;
whilst the same fall
ing upon putrid carcases, and foetid bodies, gives them to
exhale the most offensive stinks. Thus likewise the same
light from the same sun, which strikes the eye with
pleasing and refreshing colours from some objects, causes
others to reflect
a
sad and mournful hue. The case
is
the
some with respect to the heat and light proceeding from
the heavenly sun: for when these enter by influx into
good subjects as good spirits, good men, or angels, they
advance their good properties to higher degrees of per
fection, by augmenting the vigour and lustre of them.
On the other hand, when they fall upon the ungodly, they

reverberate, suffocate, or oervert the good influx, and so
turn it to their own greater detriment. Thus the light of
Heaven, incident on the truths of good, increases under
standing and wisdom ; but the same, when incident on.
the falses of evil, is transmuted by the recip ems into the
most extra\agant phantasies and madness. Thus all
things become in quality according to that of the receiver.
570. As the infernal Fire consists in the love of self and
the love of the world, so likewise in aJl the inordinate
passions and evil concupiscences which spring from those
loves, and consequently in the gratification of them; for
what a man loves he passionately desires, and what he de
sires he takes delight in. Now these are all the evils
before mentioned, viz. contempt of others, enmity to
those that are not on his side, envy, hatred, and revenge,
and in consequence thereof, unmercifulness and cruel
ty.; and with regard to things divine and sacred, unbe
lief, contempt, derision, and blasphemy, which after death
become changed into indignation and hatred against them ;
see above, n. 562. And as these infernal passions na
turally aim at the ruin and destruction of those who are
the objects of them, so where such evil minded persons
have it not in their power to effect this, they however
give the fullest scope they can to their diabolical malevo
lence and hatred. These are the things meant by Fire
in the Scriptures, as applied to evil men and evil spirits,
as will appear from the fo lowing quotations ; **

the false proceeding from evil.
57 1. It has been shewed in the foregoing article, that
bv the Fire of Hell is meant all those evii affections and
propensities which proceed from the love of self and of
the world, and with which all the inhabitants of the in

with smoke ascending from the pit, as from a house on
fire, more thick and dark fiom the Hell where self-love
is predominant, and of a flame colour from that where
the love of the world prevails; but when the Hells are
shut, no such phenomenon of Fire is seen, but in the
room of it a dense exhalation as of smoke, which affects
the senses as from a heat within, in some places resem
bling that of a stove, in others the vapour of a hot bath;
when this heat extends its influence to a man on earth, it
excites in him inordinate appetites and desires : it insti

452 A treatise concerning
in spirit with those Hells whilst here in the bodj\ It
must be observed in this place that they who are actually
in Hell, have no sensation of Fire or burning, as is com
monly imagined, but only experience such a kind of Heat
or Fire as inflamed their irascible and other evil passions
in this world; that all about them appears in the form of
Fire, is from Correspondency, and that because every
love, according to its kind, corresponds to Fire, and in
the spiritual world all things have their representations
and visible forms according to the laws of Correspon
dency.
572. It is to be noted here, that this infernal Heat
or Fire is changed into intense Cold on any influx of heat
from Heaven, and at such times the infernals are seized
w ith a convulsive shivering and rigour like persons in an
ague fit, and that because of the contrariety between the
elements of Heaven and Hell, insomuch that the heat of
the former, which is divine love, extinguishes the heot of
the latter, which is the love of self, these being opposite
to each other. The dusky light that is from the Fire of
Hell, is likewise at such times turned into darkness, and
the infernal spirits are so overcome by the divine influx
as to fall into astonishment and extreme infatuation: but
such a visitation seldom happens, except when the tumult
and uproar in Hell requires such a discipline to reduce
them eto ordr and subjection.
573. As this Fire of Hell signifies every propensity to
evil flowing from the love of self, so likewise it signifies
its punishment in those self-tormenting passions of hatred,
revenge, and cruelty towards those who are the objects
of them ; for this kind of love is the root of all tyranny
and arbitrary power, and the enemy of God and man ;
it quits not the soul even in death, but follows it to Hell,
and there becomes its confirmed infernal passion, for
ever excluding divine light and love, and binding itself
in chains of darkness, and the penal Fire of its own evil.
574. It was said before, that the evil spirits cast them
selves into Hell of their own accord; now how it comes
to pass that they should voluntarily commit themselves to
a place of such miseries, must be explained. From every

particular Hell exhales a sphere of effluvia from the
passions and qualities of the inhabitants therein, which
striking: the senses of those who arc of similar affections,
it excites in them the most grateful perceptions, as every
one's pleasure is according to the kind of his love. The
spirit that is thus agreeably affected, presently turns him
self to the quarter from whence the sphere arose, and
wishes to be there, for as yet he is unacquainted with the
miseries it is replete with, nay, if he knew them, still he
would wish the same ; for in the spiritual world no one
can resist the propensities of his ruling passion or love, for
therein is his will, and the these constitute his nature, and
there every one goes by the bent of his nature. On the
spirit's first arrival in Hell, he is received with a shew of
kindness, insomuch that he now thinks he is with his
friends: but this lasts only a few hours; for after sift
ing into his genius and particular turn of mind, they
begin to molest and vex him different ways, and so go
on to greater provocations, till they lead him to a deeper
Hell ; for the more interior and deep the Hell, the more
malignant the spirits that dwell there ; and here, after
other exercises of discipline, they torment him, till they
have intirely brought him under subjection to their will.
But p.s there arise continual tumults and insurrections
were all hate one another, and every one strives to be
the greatest; so they who were lately subdued to the
will ofothers, become in turn confederates with some more
potent infernal, to strengthen his faction, and support his
pretensions to superiority. Thus the scene of disorder and
confusion continually varies, whilst all according to their
power evilly intreat and tyrannize over others. Such
are the miseries and sufferings which go by the name of
Hell Fire.

and contradiction betwixt false and false [pugna Jli/so-

strife, whilst every one fights for his own falsity, and calls
it truth. These wrathful contentions, as heard by those
that are not within those Hells, sound like the Gnashings
of Teeth, and are changed into such when truths from
Heaven are manifested there. In these Hells are all those
who set up nature for God; and in still deeper Hells such

athes'ical persuasion. All of thisclass.as being unreceptive
of light from Heaven, and consequently having no percep

al men, believing nothing" but what they can see with
their eyes, or touch with their hands ; whence it is, that all
the fallacies of the senses pass with them for real truths,
and all that is spiritual for fallacy ; which is the cause of
all their disputes and vain janglings having a resemblance
to the Gnashings of Teeth in the spiritual world, where
all falses have that sound. Now Teeth correspond to the
extremities in nature, and to the lowest things in man,
such as those which are sensual and corporeal. As to
Gnashing of Teeth in Hell, see Matt. viii. 12. xiii. 42,

the intellectual powers, as knowing, that he himself cap
conceive, reason upon, and form a judgment of more
things in a minute, than he can express or commit to
writing in half an hour; learning hereby, how far a man
under the exercise of his intellectual or spiritual faculties
excels himself at another time, and consequently how
much more he shall excel when he comes to be a pure
spirit, divested of his earthly body; for it is the spirit alone
that thinks in him, whilst the body is no more than the
instrument whereby he expresses his thoughts: and hence
it is that the angels possess unspeakably greater under
standing and wisdom than when they were joined to this
material world by their corporeal vehicles, in connection
with which the mind is for the most part susceptible only
of general and obscure notices of things, and unable to
discern innumerable others pertaining to spiritual know
ledge not to mention the many hindrances in the way 10 it
from worldly cares and connections ; but when man is
freed from these defects and impediments, by a transla
tion to the angelical state, (for every angel once lived
here as a man, and in the same low degrees of knowledge)
he no longer sees as through a glass darkly, but a new
intellectual world opens to his view, and he has clear
perceptions of things inconceivable by the mind of the
natural man.
577. In the same degree that the angels excel in under
standing and wisdom, the infernal spirits increase in ser
pentine craft and deceit ; for after this life every spirit en*
ters into the whole of its good or evil, and thinks, wills,
and acts therefrom without disguise ; whereas in this life
the evil of a man's spirit was curbed by legal restraints, re
gards to character, interest, and other human considera
tions ,nay, sometimes so artfully concealed under an out
side shew of justice, sincerity, and the form of godliness,
that he did not know himself, nor discover the latent
evils in his heart and nature, which manifests themselves
to his astonishment w hen he arrives in the world of spirits.

witness thereto several times; for the Lord has granted
me the privilege to be in [as one of] the spiritual world
as to my spirit, whilst in this natural world as to my bo
dy; and this I can affirm, that so great is the malice of
evil spirits against man, that except the Lord did take
him under his protection by the ministry of angels, (for
both attended him here, see n. 292, 293) it would be
impossible for him to deliver himself from the power of
Hell. But man withdraws himself from this protection
by denying his Divinity, and renouncing a life of faith
and charity, for so he turns away from the Lord to the
evil spirits, and enters into fellowship with the powers of
darkness ; yet even so (when lost to all sense of conscience)
the Lord makes use ot external restraints and fears, in or
der to deter him from the commission of outward evils;
but then these means are unavailable to introduce him
into the spiritual life, seeing this can only be affected by
a real conversion of his mind, will, and affections.
578. The worst of spirits are those, who in this life
were immersed in the principle of self-love, and at the
same time actuated by a serpentine subtlety ; for all de
ceit and craft enter deep into the thoughts and intentions,
and so poison the very root of life in man, as to destroy
every seed of spiritual good therein. Most of these are
in the Hells behind, and are called Genii ; their pleasure
is to make themselves inconspicuous, fluttering about
like bats by night, that they may do their works of dark
ness in secret : these suffer more than any other of the
evil spirits, Such as were in the like principle of self-love,
but not actuated by the like subtlety and deceit, are also
in the Hells behind, but not of like depth. And as tothose
who were possessed by the evils proceeding from the
love of thf world, but not so deep in the love self, nor
alike addicted to hatredand revenge, deceit and subtlety,
they are called Evil Spirits, and their Hells are milder,
as they suffer less from their lesser degrees of maligni
ty.

affections, which they scent by a pecu'iar sagacity, like
as dogs do their game ; and when they have made the
discovery, they make it their business to turn and wind
the good affections of any one, all they can, to their con
traries, and this by drawing them off to other objects by
allurements suited to 'heir particular inclinations and com
plexions ; and this they manage with such art and cun
ning, that the party is not aware of the deceit, as they
hinder him by various crafty, devices from attending to
and making reflections upon ?he matter. Their situation,
when with man, is under the occiput, or hinder part of the
head. These, when bving in 'his world, were such as
cunning'y applied to the ruling passions of men, and by
artfully insinuating themselve« into their affections capti
vated their minds, in order to lead them more easily into
the traps and snares they laid for them ; but all, of whose
reformation and regeneration there are the least hopes, are
carefully preserved by the goodness of the Lord from
these ins duous spirits, whose power and subtlety are
otherwise sufficent to remove the barriers of conscience,
and to awaken and put in motion all the hereditary evils
in man's nature; and therefore they are not permitted to
infest such persons. Such are the companions, and such
the mansions, to which all crafty and malicious deceivers
are consigned after death : when viewed in the other world
in their proper form and character, they appear in the

other, in disturbing the Divine Order in its lowest clas

lies. By these, and various other deceitful arts, they vefc
and torment one another in their miserable societies ;
but as all these, wicked arts, except the last mentioned,
are unknown in our world, I forbear to describe them,
not only because they would not be understood, but also
because they are not fit to be mentioned.
58 1 . This severity of sufferings and tormenting disci-
Eline
is permitted by the Lord, 'to keep within certain
ounds the flagrant evils of the infernal spirits, by their
mutual opposi'ion, as they are subject to no other re
straint than the fear of suffering for them, without which
Hell would be tenfold itself in uproar, rage and madness ;
a picture of which we may form to ourselves by the idea
of an earthly kingdom without coercive laws with penal
sanctions. (*)
OF THE APPEARANCE, SITUATIQN, AND PLURAL
ITY OF THE HELLS.
582. IN the Spiritual World, where spirits and angels
have their abodes, thk-re are the same appearances of
things as in this our natural world, as of plains, mountains,
hills, rocks, valleys, waters, &c. but all from a spiritual
origin, and therefore only visible to those spiritual beings,
and not to man whilst in this natural state, unless it be
given him to be conversant in the spiritual World as a
spirit: nor can an angel or spirit behold the material
things of this world, except he be joined to man in like
* This observation of our author may suggest to us a good addition
al argument in vindication of the Divine Ptovidcncc, in perm.tting
the calamities of tumults, insurrections and wars, in the present de
generate state of mankind : tor Uiough these are coniessedly great
evils, yet they serve as means preventive of greater, by operating on
the fears and passions of men various ways ; thus, by restraining the
oppressions, tyranny, and cruelty of wicked rulers on the one hand,
and by experience of the evils and miseries thereof, curbing the li
centiousness of the multitude on the other, which is only awed by
fear of sufferings from venting their malignity every man on his neigh
bour, and from turning all things into chaos and confusion. Tr.

manner; for as the sight of the former is adapted only to
natural light, so is the sight of the latter to spiritual light,
though the eyes of both are to appearance the very same.
This will hardly be received by the natural man, much
less by the sensualist, who being governed in all things
by his bodily senses, can form no conception of reality
and substance, as pertaining to any thing beyond material
nature; but notwithstanding this, the resemblance be
tween the spiritual and natural world is such, that man,
for some time after his departure hence, knows not but
that he is siill in the latter, insomuch, that his death may
very properly be called a translation from one world to
another like it; and that there is such similitude betwixt
them, has been shewed before in the chapter concerning
Representatives and appearances in Heaven, n. 170 to 176,
583. The Heavens there appear above ; the World of
Spirits beneath; and the Hells are under both. The Hea>-
vens are not seen by the spirits that are in the World of
Spirits, except when their interior sight is opened ; at other
times they appear only as through a mist, or as lighf clouds,
and that because the arlgels of Heaven are in a more inte
rior state of understanding and wisdom, and accordingly
above the sight of those that are in the World of Spirits:
but the spirits, who are in the plains and valleys, see each
other, except when they are internally separated by in.
tromission into their interior states; for at such times the
evil spirits do not see the good, but the good spirits
see the evil ones, but turn away their faces from them,
and so become invisible to the others. As to the Hells,
they are not seen in this world, as being shut, but only
the entrances into them, called their gates, when they are
opened for the admission of those that are consigned to
them. These gates afe visible in the World of Spirits, but
not in Heaven.
584. There are Hells every-where under the moun
tains, hills and rocks; and the holes or gates leading into
them, appear as so many clefts or fissures in rocks, some
of large, and some of narrow extent, and they all appear
dark and dismal, though the spirits within have a kind of
light like that from burning coals, to which their sight' is

darkness as to divine truths through unbelief, they had no
other light than what proceeded from vain reasonings and
error, and therefore they can see nothing in the light of
Heaven, when they quit thi'irgloomy mansions; suchop-
posites are the light of faith, and the darkness of unbe
lief.
5R5. • The openings or gates leading to the Hells
which are undermaih the plains and valleys, have different,
aspects, some resemble those which are underneath the
mountains, hills, and rocks; some of them look like dens
and caves; some like wide m -uihs and gulfs, and others
like Jak'js and pools of wat r. They are only open when
evil spirits come thither from the World of spirits, to be
parsed into their respective Hells, at which times are seen
to issue *rom them fire, and flame with or without smoke,
as ata >thick clouds of fuliginous vapour ; though it is said,
that they do not appear as such to the infernal spirits, as
being then in their own proper atmosphere, and the ele
ments that are congrous to their nature ; for they corres
pond to the evils and falses thereof: for example, such,
fire to hatred and revenge ; smoke and soot to the falses
belonging thereto; flame to the evils of self-love; and
black clouds and vapour to the falses thereof.
Sb6. I was allowed to look into the Hells, and take a
View of their inside ; for the power of such inspection is,
by divine permission, granted at times to the angels and
spirits above them, even when they are not open ; such
an inside view of them I had. Some of the Hells appear
ed like caverns in rocks, first proceeding far horizontally
and then descending either perpendicularly, or by wind
ings, to a great depth. Some resembled the dens of wild
beasts in the woods : others the subterraneousworks in
mines, with different chambers and descents to still lower
floors. Most of them arc of three degrees of descent, the
uppermost dark, as corresponding to the falses of evil j
the lowest of a fiery appearance, as corresponding to the
evils themselves. In the lowest Hells are those who ac
ted immediately from the root or principle of evil ; but in
snch as are less deep, those who acted from evil errors,

ruins of houses and towns after some dreadful conflagra
tion in which the infernal spirits skulk ; and in the milder
Hells are seen a kind of rude cottages, and in some places
contiguous in the form of a city or large town, with streets
and lanes, inhabited by infernal spirits, that live together
in strife, hatred, quarre'lings, and fightings even to blood,
whilst in the streets and publick ways are committed thefts
and robberies ; and in some of the Hells are places like
publick stews shocking to behold, as full of uncleanness
and filth of all kinds. There are also gloomy woods, in
which the infernal spirits wander about like wild beasts,
and also subterraneous caves, into which such as are pur
sued by others
fly
for refuge. Moreover, there arc bar
ren and sandy deserts, ragged rocks with caverns, and
scattered cottages; and to these desert places are consign
ed such in particular as had passed through severe suffer
ings in the other Hells, and had been foremost among
those who deceive others
by
Crafty devices and wicked
stratagems. This
is
the last state of their appointment.
587. The exact particular Situation of the Hells
is
not
known even to the angels, but to the Lord only, though
their general distinctions are known from the quarters

these distinctions being the
same as

and as the Hells are in all things opposite to the
Heavens, so the principal or regulating quarter there
is

of Heaven, n. 141 to 153.) Hence
it
is,
that the Western
Hells are the worst and most horrible of all, and that m
proportion to their greater degrees of distance from the
East. To these are appointed such as in this world were
so swallowed up in the love of self, as to hold in con.

462 A treatise concerning
souls of men ; and as they still retain the same proud vin
dictive spirit, so to shew their rage and cruelty is their
greatest pleasure ; but this turns to their greater misery
in the other world, for all of their class being actuated by
the same infernal passion of domineering, they exercise
their fury and malice upon one another; but more of
this in a small work Concerning the Last Judgment, and
the Destructi n ofBabylon, As to the particular circum
stances relative to the Hells, it can only be said, that the
worst ofthem are to the northward ; that they abate in de
gree of malignity towards the south, and still more to
wards the East. Towards the last also are many who
were high-minded arid atheistical, but not of like savage
cruelty and infernal subtlety as those nearer to the West.
At this time there are no infernal societies in full East,
they having been translated nearer to the Western re
gions ; but the Hells in the North and South are very
many, and inhabited by such as were immersed in the
love of the world, and the various evils derived from that
source, as enmity, hostilities, extortion, wrong and rob
bery, artifice, avarice, and uncharitableness, increasing
or decreasing in degrees of milignity, as was said before,
^according to their greater or lesser degrees of distance
from the East. Behind the Hells in the Western and
Northern divisions are the gloomy woods and deserts be
fore mentioned. Thus much concerning the Situation of
the Hells.
588. With regard to the Plurality of Hells, it is here
to be noted, that they equal in number the angelical so
cieties in the Heavens ; for there is a society of infernals
answering to every society of angels, according to the
nature of opposites. That the heavenly societies are in
numerable, and all distinct, according to the different
kinds and degrees of their goods of divine love, charity,
and faith, see under the article Concerning the Societies of
-which the Heavens consist, n. 41 to 50 ; as also in that,
Concerning the Immensity of Heaven n. 415 to 420. In
like manner the infernal societies are distinct, according
to their respective evils opposite to. the goods before men

or general, which contains in it innumerable species or
particulars ; however, this may not appear to those who
form to themselves only one simple idea of every evil ;
as for example, of contempt, hatred, enmity, revenge; de
ceit and the like ; whereas every one of these contains so
many specific differences, and under them as many par
ticular subdivisions, as would more than fill a volume
to enumerate them all. According to these manifold dis
tinctions in evil, and their nearer or more remote distan
ces from one another, are the several Hells divided and
regulated with the utmost exactness and congruity.
There are also Hells under Hells, communicating with
one another, some by passages, and some by exhalations,
according to the agreement or affinity betwixt evil and
evil. That the Hells are so many and various, appears
from its being given me. to know, that under every moun
tain, hill, rock, plain, and valley, there were particular
Hells of different extent in length, breadth, and depth.
In a word, both Heaven and the World of spirits may be
considered as convexities, under which are arrangements
of those infernal mansions. So much concerning the Plu
rality of Hells.

of action and re-action between two opposite powers, pro
ducing Rest or equilibiium ; and this according to an es

the very atmospheres, in which the lower and denser air
re-acts on the superincumbent columns ; nay, even be
twixt heat and cold, light and darknesss dry and moist;
and the middle point is the temperature or Equilibrium.

A-Oit A treatise concerning
action and re-action, or actives and passives, producing- or
restoringan Equilibrium in nature. In the physical wor/d,
the agent and re-agent are called Power and conatus;
and in the spiritual world, Life and will, as being living
power and conatus ; and here the Equilibrium is called
Liberty. Thus there exists a spiritual Equilibrum or Li
berty betwixt good and evil, by the action of one, and
the re-action of the other ; for example, in good men this
Equilibrium is effected by the action of the good princi
ple, and the re-action of the evil principle ; but in bad
men, evil is the agent, and good is but the re-agent.
That there is a spiritual Equilibrium betwixt good and
evil, is because every thing appertaining to the vital prin
ciple in man, has relation to good or evil, and the will is
the receptacle of both. There is likewise an Equilibrium
betwixt true and false; but this depends on th_- Equilibri
um betwixt good and evil, according to their kinds re
spectively. The Equilibrium betwixt truth and false is
similar to that which is betwixt light and darkness [un-
bramt~\ which operate, according to the heat and cold
therein, on the subjects of the vegetable kingdom; for
that light and darkness have no such operation in them
selves alone, but only through the heat in them, may ap
pear from the similarity that is betwixt the light and dark
ness in Winter and in Spring. The comparison of truth
and false with light and darkness is from correspondency,
for truth corresponds to light, and false to darkness, and
heat to the good of love. Spiritual light also is the same
with truth, and spiritual darkness is the same with false;
concerning which see the chapter, On the Light and Heat
m Heaven, n. 126 to 140.
590. There is a perpetual Equilibrium betwixt Hea
ven and Hell; from the latter continually exhales and as
cends a conatus of doing evil; and from the former con
tinually emanes and descends a conatus [tendency to or

»f spirits, which is situated in the midst betwixt Heaven
and Hell (see above, n. 421 to 431 :)and this may ap
pear from hence, that every man immediately after death
enters into the World of Spirits, and there continues in
the same state in which he died; is examined and proved
thereby, as a touchstone of his principles ; and remains
under the same free will, which all indicate an Equilibri
um; for such a spiritual Equilibrium there is in every
man and spirit, as observed before. The particular kind
and tendency of this liberty or free will, is *ell known by
the angels in Heaven, by the communication of thoughts
and affections ; and it appears visibly to the angelical spi
rits, *
by the'pathes and ways which they chuse to walk
in as the good spirits take those which lead to Heaven,
and the evil spirits those which lead to Hell: for such
ways and walks have actually a visible appearance in that
world ; and this is the reason that the word way or ways
in scripture signifies those truths which lead to good,
and in an opposite sense, those false* which lead to evil;
and hence also it is, that to go, walk, or journey, signi
fy the progressions of life in the same Sacred Writings.
(282) It has oftentimes been given me to see such ways
or roads and the spirits walking and passing therein, as
they were led to chuse the one or the other by the partic
ular bent of their minds and affections.
591. That evil continually exhales and ascends from
Hell, and that good continually flows and descends from
Heaven, is because every one is surrounded by a spiritual
sphere, flowing or transpiring from his vitial affections
and thoughts, (283) and consequently the same from eve-
thi» material world, in their different properties of attraction, repul
sion, gravitation, See. TV.

4S6 A treatise concerning
ry society celestial or infernal, and collectively from the
whole Heaven and the whole Hell. This universal efflux
of good fom Heaven originates in the Lord and passes
through the angels without any mixture of their propriety
[proprium\or self-hood; for this is suppressed in them by
the Lord, who grants them to live in his own divine pro
perty; whereas the infernal spirits are in their own pro
perty of selfish nature, or what only belongs to them-
8clves[yDro/>r/«;n,]which, as unblessed with divine com
munications from the sole fountain of all good, is only e-
vil in every one continually. {284) This may suffice to
shew, that the Equilibrium both of the angels and devils
diners from that in the middle World of Spirits ; the
Equilibrium of the former being according to their free
will in the principle of good from a life and love of good,
and hatred to evil in this world ; but the Equilibrium of
the latter, according to their free will in evil from a life
and love of evil, and hatred to good in this world.
592. Except the Lord kept the government of the
Heavens and Hells in his own hands, there would be an
end of Equilibrium, and consequently both of Heaven
and Hell ; for all things in the natural and spiritual world
subsist thereby, and the balance once destroyed, all things
would necessarily run into disorder and confusion. 9uc
would be the case in the spiritual world, unless the pow
er of evil were restrained by the reaction of the good prin
ciple, and so hindered from acquiring the superiority....
Unless this were effected by the sole government of the

the whole human race : the words sole government ofthe
Lord, must here be repeated, as he alone is sufficient for
this work ; for every thing belonging to the creature as
his proper own or self, whether it be angel, spirit or man,
is nothing but evil, and therefore absolutely incapable ot
making any resistance to the efflux and powers of Hell,
as being more on their side ; so that the whole of salva
tion in every creature is solely owing to the government
and grace of the Lord : nor can it be supposed that less
than his omnipotent arm can be sufficient to keep within
bounds the hostile fury and malice of all the Hells, which
join in one common confederacy against Heaven, and all
that are therein.
593 The Equilibrium between the Heavens and the
Hells is determined by the number of those that enter
therein, which amounts to several thousands every day ;
and to adjust a matter of such universal importance can
only belong to that omnipresent Lord, who weighs all
things in the balance of infinite wisdom ; for wise as the
Angels are, they see comparatively but a little way, nor
know all things that pass within the circle of their own
societies.
594. Something has been offered before on the gov
ernment of the Heavens and the Hells with relation to the
subserviency of all therein to the preservation of Equili
brium ; as that all the societies in both are disposed and
regulated according to their general and specific distinc
tions in good and evil ; and that under every celestial
there is an infernal society answering thereto as its oppo
site, from which opposite correspondence results the
Equilibrium, whereby the evil if restrained from over
powering the good, and a provision made by the divine
wisdom to check every tendency to superiority in the
former over the latter ; and this is effected by various
means : as by a stronger operation of the divine presence,
or by a sricter confederacy in good among particular an
gelical societies. There are also other means made use of,
in order to this end by various regulations as to the
Hells ; thus, by dividing particular societies therein, and
by ejecting a certain number into the deserts before men-

tioned ; by the translation of some infernals from one
Hell to another, and divers other admininistrations of
government both in the Heavens above, and in the Hells
beneath. By so many ways does the Lord provide for the
preservation of that Equilibrium between good and evil,
on which the salvation and happiness of men and angels
so much depend.
595. The Hells are continually plotting against Hea
ven, and exerting their hostile malice for its destruction ;
though impotent and vain are all their endeavours against
those 'who are under the defence of the Lord omnipotent.
I have often seen their enmity and hatred to all things di
vine and sacred, represented bv the form of a sphere as
cending from the infernal regions, as if to insult and as
sault Heaven : whereas the Heavens, on the contrary,
make no assault on the Hells, the divine sphere proceed
ing from the Lord being an efflux of love for the salvation
of all ; but as those miserable spirits, through the evil
they are in and chuse, render themselves incapable of
such salvation, therefore this emanation of the divine
goodness can effect nothing more in their behalf, than to
restrain, as far as possible, their vindictive malice from
wreaking itself with unbridled fury and madness on one
another ; and to this end he is graciously p leased to em
ploy various means -, so merciful is the Lordevento wards
the impenitent and incorrigible.
596. The Heavens, in the general, are distinguished
into two kingdoms ; the one which is called the celestial,
the other the spiritual kingdom ; of which see above, n.
20 to 28 The Hells likewise are distinguished into two
kini-doms; the one of which is opposite to the celestial,
tte other to the spiritual. That which is opposite to the
celestial is in the West, and they who belong to it are
called Genii ; and that which is opposite to the spirit
ual kingdom is in the North and South, and they who
belong to it are called Evil Spirits. All in the celestial
kingdom excel in love to the Lord, and all that are in the
Hells opposite to that kingdom, are under the prevailing
power ol self love ; all that belong to the spiritual king
dom are distinguished in excellence by Love to their
Neigbour, and all Uiat are in the Hells opposite to this

kingdom, are slaves to the Love of the World ; so that
Love to the Lord, and the Love of Seif, are in the same
diametrical opposition to each other, as the Love of our
Neighbour and the Love of the World. Effectual provi
sion is made by the Lord, that no power of evil from the
Hells, that are in opposition to the celestial kingdom, may
reach the subjects of the spiritual kingdom, as the conse
quence in that case would be the subversion of the lat
ter, for the reason given in n. 578, 579. Thus does the
Lord keep the ballance betwixt good and evil in his own
hand for the preservation of his kingdoms.
THAT THE LIBERTY OR FREE WILL OF MAX,
IS FROM THE EQUILIBRIUM THAT SUBSISTS
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL.
597. IN the foregoing chapter we have treated of that
Equilibrium which subsists between Heaven and Hell,
and shewed, that it is no otherthan an Equilibrium be
twixt the good that proceeds from the former, and the
evil that proceeds from the latter, and so constituting the
essence of human Liberty ; and as good and evil, truth
and false, are of a spiritual nature, so also is that Equili
brium in which consists the power of thinking and wil
ling the one or the other, and the Liberty of chusing or
refusing accordingly. This Liberty, or Freedom of the
Will, originates in the Divine Nature, but is given to
every Man by the Lord for a property of his life, nor
does He ever take it back again. This good gift to Man
is to the end that he may be regenerated and saved, for
without Free Will there is no salvation for him ; but that
he actually posses
it,
he may know from the operations
of his own mind, and what passes inwardly in his spirit, he
being able to think and chuse either good or evil, what
ever restraints he may be under from uttering or acting
the latter in respect to laws divine or human. Now this
inward experience evinces beyond
a
thousand arguments,
that Liberty belongs to Man, as his spirit
is
his proper
self, and
it
h>
that which freely thinks, vyills, and cbuses

47 0 A treatise concerning
consequently, Liberty is to be estimated according to
the inner man, and not from what he may be outwardly
through fear, human respects, or other external restraints-.
598. That Man would not be capable of being reform
ed or regenerated without Free Will, is because he is
by the original constitution of his nature born to evils of
every kind, which must be removed in order to his salva
tion ; and that can only be by his knowing, owning, re
nouncing, and abhorring them. To this end, he must be
instructed in the nature of good ; for it is by good only
that he can see the evil, but by evil he cannot see the
good : accordingly, he must be early educated in the
knowledge of spiritual truths by teaching, by reading the
Scriptures, and by the preaching of the Word, that so he
may attain to a right understanding of what is good ; as
he is likewise to cultivate his mind with the knowledge
of moral and civil truths from his intercourse with society
in the difii. rent relations of life ; all which imply the use
and exercise of Freedom. Another thing to be considered
is, that nothing becomes appropriated to Man, or can be
called his own, that is not received into the affectionate
part ; other things he may apprehend or form an ideal
knowledge of, but what enters not his will or love, which
is the same thing, (for what a Man wills he loves) that
makes no part of him, nor abides with him. Now Man
being naturally prone to evil, he could not receive its
contrary, the good, iito his will or love, so as to become
appropriated to him, unless he were endowed with
Liberty or Freedom of Will, seeing that the good is op
posite to the evil of his nature.
599. As Man is possessed of Liberty or Free Will, in
order to be capable of regeneration, therefore he can
have communication in spirit with Heaven, or with Hell ;
for evil spirits from the one, and angels from the other,
are present with him ; by the tormer he possesses his
own evil ; by the latter he is in the principle of good
from the Lord ; and herein stands his Equilibrium or
Liberty. That every Man nas both angeis and evil spirits
attending him in this world, see the chapter Concerning
the Conjunction ofHeaven with the Human Race, n. 291
to 302.

Heaven and Hell. 471
600. Not that this conjunction of Man with Heaven or
Hell is an immediate confunction, but mediate only, and
that through the Spirits that belong to the World of
Spirits ; for these are the spirits that attend on Man, and
not any immediately from Heaven or Hell. * By the
evil spirits belonging to the World of Spirits, Man joins
himself to Hell ; and by the good spirits of the same
world he has communication with Heaven ; for the World
of Spirits is intermediate between Heaven and Hell, and
constitutes the true Equilibrium ; for these two particulars,
see above, n. 421 to 431 ; and n. 589 to 596. Thus much
for the origin of human Liberty.
601. Let it be observed, as touching those spirits that
are appointed to be Man's associates here that a whole
society may hold communication with another society,
and also with any individual wheresoever, by means of
an emissary spirit, which spirit is called, The Subject of
many ( Hubjectum piurium J The case is similar with
respect to Man's communication fconjunctioj with the
societies in Heaven and in Hell, by the intervention of his
associate spirits from the World of Spirits.
602. As to that common impression of belief concern
ing a future life on the human mind, which some call in-
nate, or natural, though in reality it be from celestial in
flux, the following memorable particular shall here be re
lated. Certain spirits, which in their life-time here had
been of tint simple pi beian class which live in all good
faith, were reinstated in the same low degree of under
standing and thinking that they possessed in this world
(as may be the case of every one, by the Divine Per-
• Tiiis is intirely consistent with what was affirmed by the Author
in the foregoing number, as the good spirits belonging to the World
of Spirits, being in their final preparation for the angelical state, arc
called Angelical Spirits ; and as they have immediate communication
with the heavenly angels, so has man, through them, a mediate com
munication with the same On the other hand, the bad spirits, belong,
ing to the World of Spirits, being in their final preparation for Hell,
are called Infernal Spirits, and have immediate communication with
devils ; and wicked men, through them, a mediate communication
with the same. Thus all communications between man, and the
highest and lowest in Heaven and Hell, are conducted through me
diums adapted to his nature and states respectively. Tr.

mission, to answer certain ends.) On this change they
discovered what ideas they had here concerning the state
of Man after death, and related as folio vs; viz. That
they were asked on a time by home learned men when iff
this world, what they thought of their souls after death;
To which they answered, that they did not know what
the soul was. They then asked them, what their belief
was concerning their state after death ? To which they
replied, that they believed they should be living spi
rits. They asked them what their faith was as to spi
rits ? They said, that a spirit was a man. They asked
them, how they knew that ? They answered, after their
simplicity, that they knew
it,
because
it
was so. On
which these learned querists stood astonished, to find such
simple illiterate people possessed of
a
stronger faith than
what they had themselves
;
manifesting hereby, that in
all who are in communion with Heaven there
is
a
princi
ple of faith, as touching the immortality of the soul by
a
divine influx from the Lord, through the medium of
those spirits which belong to the World of Spirits, but
not received by such as, through
a
vain philosophy and
science, falsly so called, poison their minds with corrupt
doctrines concerning the soul
;
as that
it
is
nothing else
than mere thought, or
a
certain animated something pro
ceeding from matter
:
and then go to find out the parti
cular place of its residence
in
the body
;
whereas the im
mortal spirit is the Man himself that animates his body,
and uses
it
only as its instrument or servant to peribm
the functions of life
in
this natural world, according to
his different states and relations therein, on his pilgrim
age to and preparation for
a
better country, even
a
hea
venly one.
603. What has been delivered in this Work concerning
Heaven, the World of Spirits, and Hell, will appear ob
scure to those who have no relish for spiritual truths, but
clear to such as take delight therein, more especially to
all who are in the love of Truth for its own sake. What
we love, we readily receive and understand
;
and where
Truth
is
the object of our affections,
it
recommends
it
self to the mind
by
the evidence
it
brings with
it
;
for
Truth
is
Light.
