Sir O liver Lodge
\ Jj[Y friend Mrs. de Crespigny has asked me
4 V I to write an introduction to her book on the
Beyond. She is so well-known that it seems to me
quite unnecessary* assuming it is any help, I
agree. The book h pjfccdcaHy an autobiography,
and relates her struggles with scepticism at the
beginning, until an intferviev with Mars. Etta Wriedt
of Detroit opened her eyes to the truth. Mrs- de
'iiaay' be c^ ed a;;.sciehtmc:."
which rendered her rather specially
sceptical; but she had am ind that was .©pea,.and ■
the evidence was too strong. Mrs. Wriedt is a good
medium, with whom I have had sittings myselfi her
special phenomenon being what is called “ the direct
” which sometimes was so loud that, when
;with the windows open, as M r. Appleyard o f
- i testifies, people walking in the road

Mrs. de Chespigny’s father was President of the

Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and First Sea- ,
Lord of the Admiralty, and was made an F R S
She received ultimately very convincing messages
both from her father and her husband, of which she
tells The result is that she has devoted her hfe to
the work, has accepted the Honorary Principalship
of the Psychic College, at 15, Queen’s Gate, where
she continues to do good work.
One episode m the book bears on a much con­
troverted subject She went through the Fire Test,
and relates her experience,— it is a thing for which
Crookes’ testimony is very good, though the ex­
traordinary nature of the phenomenon makes it
difficult to believe without confirmatory evidence,
which is here forthcoming. But the whole book
represents the passage from incredulity to conviction,
not only about survival, but about many other more
unlikely things; and I commend it to anyone inter­
ested or willing to allow their mind to become
interested in a subject which m spite of a growing
tendency towards open-mindedness is still too much
taboo
But Mrs de Crespigny has many ideas, some of
which sound extraordinary but have a bearing on
deep questions ofTheology. She has expressed some
of these to lofty spirits on the other side and has
received from them approbation to a surprising
extent The most striking ofthese she narrates at the
end of this book, and those who know the reverence
usually felt for a personality as high as “ Imperator”

they will feel it is a genuine record Perhaps there
may be truth in other modes of expression arrived at

CHAPTER ONE
LTHOUGH I am well aware that there is
already an overwhelming amount of literature
on the subject of psychic research, I make no excuse
for adding to it Life, being made up of experience
in every form, must be to some extent enriched by
the presentment offacts, great and small, which may
vary according to the outlook and mentality of the
percipient.
Therefore these pages are written in the hope that
they may be ofsome use to others in search ofa truth
hidden more effectually than at the bottom of any
With so many aspects of this difficult subject, it is
not easy to decide upon which of them to begin;
perhaps, before passing on to the more practical
angle of personal experience, it will be well to
approach it from the purely academical and logical
point of view. Instead of asking “ Does man sur­
vive'”’ let us put it the other way and ask “Why
should he not survive?”
From the very beginnings of the race man has
believed m the continuity of his personality after
the death -of-the body We know this was the
well
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
philosophy of primitive man by the traces of it he
has left behind him, the unmistakable evidence that
this was his creed The ancient mounds and burial
grounds all tell the same story ofthis primitive belief
m survived In those bygone days of Neanderthal
Man, when the ape-hke superciheury ridges were still
a characteristic and he could only just walk upright,
the traces of primeval burial rites eire still eloquent
of his belief in what is commonly called a soul.
The dead were buned with a respect not accorded
to the lesser animals, whose bones are found thrown
carelessly aside, but with the obvious signs of cere­
monial practices, with moreover the tools, drinking
utensils and weapons that had been used in this life
placed conveniently, and bearing the one explana­
tion—-that they might still be of use in a further
condition of existence to which their owner had
presumably departed
How this behefbecame rooted in the mind of man
at this early stage in his evolution is an interesting
conjecture The scientist admits the fact but, so far
as I know, offers no explanation. The sceptic has
suggested that man’s innate egotism is responsible
for what he would term this primeval form of super­
stition; that an overweening opinion of his own
importance in the universe was the origin of his
refusal to accept the fact of his final extinction But
that will hardly hold water
The power of argument from abstract principles
necessarily based on experience was still in the future
''TEs-Oniy basis for the for-ming^o f judgments and
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
drawing conclusions lay m his powers of observa­
tion, his arguments purely empirical Through these
channels he learnt that the physical body dies,
decays and disintegrates, that dust returns to dust,
and there is an end ofit
What led him to suppose there was any part of
man capable of survival?
And yet he did believe it 1
Intuition would likewise be ruled out by the
sceptic The actual meaning of the word being “the
power of knowing without being taught” the
materialist would object that when it comes to un­
seen worlds there is nothing to know, and that
intuition is a false jade at best
That the idea was pure invention cannot be upheld
as an explanation Our limited intellect is unable
to conceive anything new That there is nothing new
under the sun is not only a platitude, it is a truth.
Man cannot postulate anything that has not been
m some form presented to him , he can invent neither
colour, nor shape, nor circumstance He can adapt,
re-arrange, discover, but he cannot mvent nor con­
ceive anything that has not come within the range
or experience of humanity
And yet again—Neanderthal Man did believe m
survival!
From the materialist’s point of view what is the
answer'*
So far as I know none is forthcoming But to those
ofus familiar with psychic research and its attendant
phenomena surely there need be no mystery?
3
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Natural law is the same yesterday, to-day and to­
morrow. We hear it argued that if “miracles”_so
called— could be worked m the past they can be
produced in the present, an argument ofequal value
if applied in the opposite direction If supernormal
phenomena can be produced to-day—and the
evidence of those with experience goes to prove
that they can— they could equally have been pro­
duced m the past, and the visions and voices seen
and heard by sensitive to-day may also have been
heard by primeval man, from the time God walked
with Adam in the Garden of Eden.
In fact, man, in all probability, obtained his
knowledge of the truth of survival from the same
source whence we get it to-day—from those who
have survived.
It is also possible that then, as now, there were
those who believed and those who did not; that the
burial-grounds still extant only represent the belief
of a certain proportion of the population. It would
be interesting to learn from the expert whether there
are any signs of sceptics on this point who disposed
of the remains of their relations as carelessly and
irreverently as those of the animals.
If we attach any weight to legend and tradition,
man learnt the greater truths through the early
contacts with higher spiritual beings, which psychic
research is now teaching us to be within the bounds
of reason. The Churches may have asserted it all
down the ages, but have refused to satisfy the
demands of reason by furnishing any basis for the
+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
grounds for their faith beyond the voice ofauthority.
And yet, down through the centuries, the hidden
secrets that to-day are becoming commonplace have
never been entirely lost. They were handed on by
such bodies as the Gnostics, Freemasons, by Quakers
and Eastern sages, although man outside those bodies
has done his best to smother them.
Gradually, in the absence of the restraining
i influence of intellect, the threads of an entanghng
web of superstition became interwoven with the
original fabric Belief, in any and all forms of
superstition, ran riot through ignorance and fear,
peopling the world with spirits discarnate and other­
wise; spirits that had to be placated, bribed by
sacrifices, or rendered innocuous by religious rites,
methods that were fostered and encouraged by
successive priesthoods who knew that therein lay
their power to rule the ignorant masses and to im­
pose their will upon them.
After centuries of drifting along such lines, it
became impossible to sift the wheat from the tares,
to differentiate between pure fantasy or exaggera­
tion, and the facts supported by reliable testimony
Habit has been responsible for so much that has
crystallized into accepted tradition.
There is an amusing story told as an instance of
this, of a High Priest, who daily performed the sacri­
ficial rites of his religion. His domestic cat acquired
a habit offollowing him to the place of worship and
creating an unseemly disturbance at various points
in the ceremony. So in the interests of order her
5
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
owner solved the difficulty by tying her to whatever
represented the door-post m those days during the
performance ofhis priestly office
In due time the High Priest died and was suc­
ceeded by his son, who continued the daily estab­
lished practice of tying the cat up while he con­
ducted the rites ofworship '
Finally the cat died, whereupon a new cat was
obtained, and tied every day to the door-post in
accordance with what had come to be considered an
essential part of the religious ceremony!
It is easy to understand how some commonplace
superstitions to-day have had their roots m habits and
customs equally fantastic
Meanwhile the evolution of man’s brain was
steadily advancing, and intellect began to jib at the
demands put upon it Science, springing in the first
instance from guesswork or accident, but already
establishing a methodology of its own, began to ask
awkward questions to which tradition as repre­
sented by the various religious cults had no answer,
a situation as exasperating m those early days as it
appears to be in modern times Had any attempt
been made to furnish answers, to give reasonable
foundations for faith, the war between science and
religion waged throughout succeeding centuries with
varying degrees of bitterness might never have
started
But intellect, coming into its own, was not to be
gainsaid. Questioning, probmg, discovering and
imparting its newly found knowledge, it refused to
6
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
hoping, helping where we can to ease the burdens of
others, struggling forward in a hopeless race?
Without the hope of a hereafter the only reasonable
and sensible members of society are those who at
the first hint of suffering or disaster commit suicide;
the greatest benefactor he who could sweep humanity
from off the face of the earth and end its struggles
once and for a ll1
One of our foremost scientists has said: “ Without
the belief in survival, no religion of any sort could
have lived”— and without religion all the ethical
standards that have built upon religion would
crumble— as surely we can see for ourselves if we
look round us to-day I
With the world in this condition, m a century
eminently devoted to physical achievement, with the
evolving mentality of rising generations asking
questions to which there appeared to be no answers,
the Powers that be, deciding perhaps that the reign
of materialism had gone far enough, sent two
gifts to earth; two pearls of great price— one to
Religion, clinging in spite of all to faith in survival—
the other to Science, believing m no phenomena that
could not be explained through the laws of matter.

T
HE first message was conveyed m a manner so
homely that, according to our preconceived
ideas, it might be said to border on the grotesque
Not to the wise and learned was it delivered. It
came through two simple girls, living with their
parents m a village in the United States, girls whose
education was probably of the most elementary
description, “babes and sucklings” so far as their
intellectual level was concerned, who accepted facts
as they found them without straining after abstruse
causations or attempts to explain away
It came in the form of mysterious rappings at
which they were at first alarmed, but eventually
translated mto a code that established a means of
intelligible communication between themselves and
the unseen operator
The story of the Fox sisters, of how in 1848 the
other world came knocking at the door of this with
a renewed message ofhope to befogged and doubting
humanity, is too well-known to need repeating here.
It is said the communicator, according to his own
story, had been a pedlar in this life, had been
murdered m the house and his bones buried in the
cellar, and that excavation led to confirmation ofthe
story
12
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
It is also said that later on m their lives the sisters
“confessed” to having produced the raps fraudu­
lently, again later, that they recanted, asserting the
“ confession” had been drawn from them under the
pressure of an urgent need for money
Whether the phenomena were true or false the
results were lasting, so lasting that one doubts if they
could have been built on fraud So high an edifice,
of such obviously enduring material, was erected on
the foundation of these early rappmgs— an edifice
that has grown and flourished with the years— that it
is difficult to believe its foundations were ofsand, the
outcome due to the mischievous invention oftwo half-
educated girls' Fraud and imposition may “get
away with it” for a little while, but in these days of
education and the rapidly growing intelligence and
experience of the pubhc, time itself has justified the
allegations of those early phenomena
O f the experience of the Fox girls, spiritualism in
its modem form was boin; the whole army of
investigators and the pioneers of the last century
found themselves launched into the tangles, prob­
lems, controversies, disappointments, contumely and
ridicule that for some abstruse, psychological reason
was the lot of those who took up psychical research
as a serious study Why, in a country professing to
be Christian, contempt and hostility should be shown
toward those who attempt to prove one of the chief
tenets of Christianity to be true, is a mystery that
must go unsolved until secrets are no longer hid.
But so it is Men’s careers have been adversely
13
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
affected by their open profession of a belief in the
possibilityofcommunicationwith thosewhohave pre­
ceded us m the next step on the ladder of evolution
“ Tell me the name of any reputable scientist who
accepts spiritualism and I, too, will believe1” the
public cries, and when name after name is given of
men known to the world for their achievements in
science or other lines, we are told they have “ gone
off the rails,” and that, though sound enough m
other directions, are sufferingfrom aberrationm this1
A vicious circle to which, like other circles, there
is no end, and on a par with the mentality of a
woman who said to me one day:
“ Do people go mad because they are spiritualists;
or do they become spiritualists because they are
mad?”— an attitude of mind with which the gods
themselves would find it difficult to deal1
In spite of opposition, open and otherwise, the
great wave of a renewed belief m survival started by
the Hydesville knockings, is flooding the world The
advance may be slow, as is the advance ofeverything
worth while, but it is sure The sifting of evidence,
the attempt to place the investigation on as sound a
footing as other branches of science, has gone on
steadily, followed up by reliable workers, earnest
inquirers with open minds, some of them bearing
names of world-wide renown After all, science in
many of its branches started from beginnings as
uncertain as those ofpsychic research; from accident,
or guess-work in the first instance, followed up by
persevering, indomitable work and research, until
1+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
what is called an inductive methodology was estab­
lished and the phenomena ofthe individual branches
became stabilized. The investigation of psychic
phenomena is still far from having reached that
pomt even approximately, owing in great part to
difficulties to be dealt with later on
That the movement is spreadmg and increasing in
vitality and the arousing of general interest there is
no doubt Apart from the interest from a scientific
point of view in the exploration of new territory, the
message of assurance of a life to come offered to
struggling humanity is at least worthy of attention
Professor MacBnde, world-known as one of our fore­
most biologists, still m the attitude of an inquirer
only, and therefore presumably unbiased, said lately
m referring to the subject
“— as time goes on more and more people en­
counter such phenomena and the revival of a belief
in a future life spreads ”
The use of the word revival implies the failure of
the Churches to have kept alive the fundamental
belief in the world of intellectual minds. To quote
further from the same source.
“ The belief is like leaven, spreading through the
lump. No one who has not investigated the matter
has any idea of the extent of this spread.” — This
opinion of a critical brain, outside the movement,
eminently fitted to give it, is invaluable testimony to
the advance made during the last eighty years or so.
The gift to Intellect, represented by Science, came
in different guise; not in the homely fashion of the
IS
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Fox phenomena, but in the revelation of the
wireless wave— discovered by Sir Oliver Lodge, and
first demonstrated by him in this country—at a
garden party in Liverpool—to be subsequently
adapted and applied to practical purposes by others.
We learn there are many waves travelling through
space, having their source in differing manifestations
of energy, to which, until aided by recent develop­
ments, we have been bhnd and deaf, there may be
many more not yet explored—we know there are
some— and who is to say what further doors they
might not open could we establish contactwith them?
And here, with the object of avoiding confusion,
may a word be said about the suggested ostracism of
the term ether7
A sentence quoted from Sir Oliver Lodge will help
to explain the situation
“The ether in its various forms ofenergy dominates
modem physics, though many prefer to avoid the
term ‘ether’ because of its nineteenth century
association, and use the term ‘space ’ The term used
does not matter much.”
Sir William Bragg, Director of the Royal
Institution, in “ Scientific Aids to Industry,” {Times,
1930 justifies a continued use ofthis word:
“ Some source oflight there must be,” he says, “ to
send out waves in the ether; this language is perfectly
legitimate even though we may speak of light in
other terms when we want to consider it in other
respects The ether waves are turned aside into our
eyes by objects which they encounter ”
16
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
If space or ether be endowed with certain qualities,
it becomes a mere question of nomenclature and,
following such eminent authorities, for the purposes
of this book we may as well call it ether—whatever
it may be!— as anything else
The Rosicrucians postulated four different grades
of ether, each with its specific function in the
Universe; yet during the Meurig Morris trial it was
suggested by the opposing counsel that her control,
“ Power,” was talking mere jargon when he referred
to different kinds of ether—a reference to which Sir
Oliver Lodge, when in the witness-box, did not take
exception
Since the beginning of time many of these lately
discovered waves—lately discovered at least within
the present span ofcivilization— have been travelling
about in earth’senvironment Instruments have been
invented through which we can “tune in” to the
varying lengths of them, each wave-length bringing
to us a different story, opening the door to a different
world—worlds which have been there all the time.
Through mechanical inventions we are beginning to
realize in some degree how very limited is the range of
wave-lengths to which our physical senses are able
to react The scale that modern science and con­
trivance has brought within our powers of reaction
may give us some idea of the vastness of that which
still lies without.
The man blind from birth is shut out entirely from
a world with which those of us who are more
17
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
fortunate are familiar; withoutthe normal machinery
ofvision he cannot “tune m” to it
The same with the deaf mute He is able to react
to wave-lengths of which the blind man is uncon­
scious, but he has his own limitations, and the world
of sound, so far as he is concerned, is non-existent.
If it were not for the mass of evidence available
through the fact that those who can see and hear are
m a vast majority over those who cannot, the blind
and deaf would doubtless refuse to believe in worlds
which must appear to them to be entirely fabulous
The wave-lengths pass them by
Take as a simile a block of ice It is composed of
oxygen and hydrogen, will react to heat and pressure,
and to nothing else It is, if it may be so expressed,
conscious ofno world beyond its own A very limited
field of reactions, while the beauties of a far more
extensive world may be all round it, the limitations
are its own
Subject it to heat, that is, change its condition, not
its location m space, and the door ofanother world is
opened to it; it becomes tuned-in to the unseen
conditions surrounding it As water—though still
composed of hydrogen and oxygen only—it reacts to
the skies above it, which it reflects on its surface, to
various sources of energy within its reach, to
obstacles in the path ofits passage in rivers to the sea,
in a hundred ways to which, m its condition as ice,
it was dead and unresponsive It can itself become,
as water, a means of energy in the driving of
machinery and the work ofthe world.
18
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
But the change has been in itself, a readjustment to
conditions that have always been there
Is it unreasonable to believe there may also be
worlds around us— real, well-ordered worlds— to
which the normally equipped individual cannot
react without a readjustment ofhis own limitations?
Is it not almost more reasonable— especially in the
light of later scientific discoveries— to postulate that
there are?
If we study the whole gamut ofvibrations to which
naturally or with the aid of artifice we are able to
respond, extending from the radio-active rays below,
to the cosmic or Millikan rays above the spectrum,
what a tiny tract m space is included1
— the spectrum
itself, comprising the whole field of man’s power of
vision, is a mere thread in comparison with the fields
that have already been explored What then of the
fields beyond?
The ancient Egyptians seem to have been familiar
with the fundamental law which the modern
physicist in this civilization is only now beginning to
grasp The present conception of matter in terms of
energy and ether seems also to have been theirs,
although they described it more poetically than we,
with our dry, scientific terminology and mathe­
matical abstractions They postulate the cosmos as
a series ofoctaves ofvibrations; they certainly do not
speak m modern phraseology of atoms and electrons,
but when they assert that in the seven notes of the
lyre he all the laws ofthe universe, it comes to much
the same thing as the electronic theory of to-day
19
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Matter is no longer conceived of as “solid” and
stable, but as fluid and liable to variation as the
ether of which it is composed.
That the great import to spiritualism and psychic
research of the discovery of the wireless wave should
be stressed, is not so much on account of any direct
connexion between them as for the effect it has had
on the mentality of its own and succeeding genera­
tions The developments that have followed are now
a matter ofuniversal acceptance and understanding.
To the man in the street no less than to the scientist,
it forms a link between the seen and the unseen, the
opening of a door to a world of which he had been
unconscious Science, it is true, has opened many
doors in many branches ofscience, but not to worlds
into which the ordinary layman found he also could
enter, to which he too could turn the key once he had
been shown the way
The worlds laid bare through difficult mathe­
matical calculations, the technical knowledge re­
quired for the proving of such phenomena as the
velocity ofhght, the movements of planets and such­
like, he has had to take on trust But to this other he
can turn the key himselfand enter when he chooses.
Not a new world, springing suddenly into being,
but a world which had been waiting for us all the
time. It has raised the average of the general power
of perception and brought man a little nearer to
what has been called “ thinking in space.”
Professor Levy, quoted in Science and the Changing
World, edited by Mary Adams, complains that a
20
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
correspondent seems to suggest that modem re­
searchesmtothe constitutionofthe atom providesome
information about hfe after death. In hisown words :
“ I am completely baffled by the apparent relation­
ship between atoms and immortality, and I doubt if
the most sturdy believer m psychic research would
countenance the suggestion ofany relationship And
yet the belief is fairly widespread that, m some
peculiar way, recent investigations mto atoms and
electrons point to the discovery of something
‘spiritual’ at the core of scientific theory ”
Up to a pomt, the psychic researcher would agree
with Professor Levy. But the suggestion would not
be of a spiritual core to a scientific theory, but that
the nature ofscientific theory smce the advent ofthe
wireless wave and the present theory of the con­
stitution ofthe atom, have effected this readjustment
of the general mentality Men’s minds have become
more fluid since the scientist himself has more or
less deserted the old strongholds, to find himself led
by the light ofhis own torches from the concrete into
the ether, to deal with problems of time and space,
and to theorize about dimensions further than those
with which we are already familiar The whole
trend ofscientific and philosophical thought seems to
be undergoing a change.
Sir Oliver Lodge says, writing on “ The Spirit of
Science”— “But every increase of knowledge ought
to advance true civilization, and enlarge our per­
ception of the material universe .. The revelations
of Astronomy have enlarged the universe beyond all
21
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
previous conception and raised strange problems
about time and space and the fundamental nature of
matter and energy . . All this study is valuable in
the highest degree It does not affect the bodily
welfare ofman, but it affects, whatis more important,
his whole faith and outlook ”
That is what the “new background of science” is
doing The suggestion to which Professor Levy
objects is not that there is a spiritual core to thefacts
revealed by modem discovery; it is rather that the
facts admitted through the evidence now available
have become signposts pointing m the direction
which, through our powers of inference, we may
presume our future road may lie It is beginning to
dawn m the minds of many intelligent thinkers to­
day that reason is ranging itself on the side of the
cloud of witnesses to which hitherto science and
learning have turned deafears Ifthere be this world
of sound which has revealed itself to us without any
doubt or question* a world that interpenetrates our
own, to which we become aware only through the
tumng-in to certain wave-lengths, why should it be
illogical or unreasonable to suppose there are still
others, invisible, inaudible, waiting around us,
within our environment, waiting, as that other has
waited, untilman’spowers ofperception, aided orun­
aided, have advanced to the pomtofdefinite contact?
In making that suggestion I am quite aware that
I am “ extrapolating”—unforgivable sin in the eyes of
science! But as I have no claim to be enrolled in the
ranks of the learned I can extrapolate if I choose 1

IWAS quite a child when circumstances first
brought me into contact with the serious side
oflife. I
My father—eventually The Right Hon. ¡Sir Astley
Cooper Key—in years too far back to count, was
Adm Supt. at Portsmouth Dockyard when\ H.M S
Captain was fitting out for her first cruise ; she was one
of the early ironclads and her tripod mascs were
something of an experiment Captain Burgoyne, in
command of her, and Mr Cooper Coles, thev con­
structor, were, if I remember rightly, guests an our
house in the Dockyard At all events, we saw them
constantly, and some of the younger officers oft^he
ship were the friends and self-constituted playmates
of my small brothers and myself With the sailor’s
kindheartedness toward children they entered intp
our games, told us stories, and added considerabl r
to the joy of life in both nursery and schoolroom
We often visited them on board the Captain, ar
remember taking a particular interest m the fur
mg of the after cabin, Captain Burgoyne’s
domain; it was decorated m a scheme of b’
gold, a new idea m those days, and in eft
and gloomy, and considered by many in

lines, coloured by the hymns I sang in church— not
jthe sermons, because I never listened to them I
pictured them clothed in white with the inevitable
iharp in their hands, singing hymns day and night,
for ever and ever.
l Frankly I did not believe it—and said so— that
lit would bore them stiff, as it would bore me— or
cwords to that effect— and thereby earned a repn-
hnand from Authority, and from our nurse of many
cyears standing in particular, as a staunch adherent
ipf the Scottish Church; and as no sort of effort was
fumade to substantiate these descriptions of the
«heavenly state by any kind of evidence or logical
^argument, I continued to reiterate my question—

able questions did more harm than was realized by
a generation that in the main could accept what it'
was told of religious dogma. But even in those days
a new age was dawning, intellect was beginning to
assert itself, and once a question about a vital truth
has come into a mind either young or old there is
no turning back m the search for an answer
Materialism was in the air all around us, permeating
the serious literature of the day, determining the
trend of thought The names of Darwin, Huxley
Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill, were bandied
about m ordinary conversation, and although expres­
sions of opinion became guarded when within
reach of juvenile ears, a question mark began to
loom big in our lives, and if we failed to get answers
from others, we proceeded to worry them out fo
ourselves

very definite opinions, and ignorance was no bar to
the vehemence with which we expressed them. To
nisquote Henley, when it came to argument, our
eads might be bloody, but they remained unbowed
1 spite of any bludgeomng
So while Authority imagined its rulings were
leekly accepted, we of the young generation were
usy formulating our own creeds, wrangling among
urselves about what to believe and what not to
elieve, throwing the caps of traditional opinion
ver windmills and rejecting unanimously the wings

A snow squall came up, swept across the watei
and blotted the ship—a noble sight with all her sail

When the squall passed, the Eurydtcehad vanished
There was not a sign of her. The friends we h'

No wonder, as it was said at the tune, the crowd of
expectant friends and relatives, waiting to greet
hose from whom they had been parted, rubbed
heir eyes, hardly believing the evidence of their

To those who lived through the devastation
aused by the Great War, such incidents may appear
comparatively trivial But at that time the Great
Var had not happened; moreover, during that
isastrous interval, the world was keyed to a note of
expectancy, ofpreparedness for the worst— and even
n those circumstances the loss of the Lusitama
seemed to strike a chord apart, made a notable
mpression against the grim background of death
and chaos
But when I was young and living in a world of
comparative peace, a ship going down with all hands
as the Capiatn and the Euryiice went down in so
iramatic a setting, was as a bolt from the blue, and
T am sure those events had a more lasting effect on
my life and trend of thought than I was conscious
of at the time.
After Portsmouth Dockyard, our next move was
to Malta, where my father was Admiral Superinten­
dent ofthe Dockyard and also second in command of
the Fleet, and a great part of my life was spent on
and in the sea. It was here I was brought into every­
day contact with a religion other than my own— a
religion that had so far in my life figured mainly in
fiction, and that, according to the tradition of those
days, I had been taught to believe was fundamentally

Variations of creeds and dogmas were never the
ocus of family discussion in our most argumentative
lays. We confined ourselves to the wider issues of
heology1 The point was not so much the merits or
iemerits of any particular Heaven or Hell, but
whether such speculative localities existed at all;
ve were occupied less with the diversity of the mter-
iretations of the “Word of God” than whether the

more serious events of life seem to stand out and
mpress themselves quite unjustifiably on a child’s
nemory for all time. Who can ever say what memory

will retain or reject? Knowing what jade’s tricks
it can play on us here in a world of which we have a
little understanding, is it not unreasonable to lay
down the law, as one so often hears the law laid
down, as to what we should remember and what
we should not on arrival in the next? The sub

Shortly afterwards there was a luncheon party, and
one of the guests referring to certain recent arrival!

Whereupon I, eager to display my knowledge of a
nice long word, suggested brightly: “Perhaps she is
illegitimate.”
To this day I remember the cold silence that fell
like a pall on the company, and the homily I received
about the advantages of being seen and not heard;
but I still consider I was blameless in the matter!

Not only that, but it put a romance into commerce
and the exchange of merchandise— ships going up
the Thames with one cargo, and down on the return
journey with another that could not fail to make an
appeal to the dullest imagination
It was at Greenwich College, owing to the general
atmosphere around us perhaps, that the intense love
ofnatural science m all its forms, flourished and grew
into something that has lasted me all my life, and has
been the core and motive force not only ofthe interest
in psychic research, but also of the attitude toward
religion which has been inseparable from it
As a child I always preferred stories ofearthquakes,
floods, volcanoes, to ordinary fairy stories; the
dynamic causes fascinated me, bringing home the
beauty and poetry underlying the laws of nature;
the grandeur of God’s message to man, which is
surely man’s business to decode so far as he can.
Alfred Noyes’ wonderful poem “ The Torchbearers”
is torched with this beauty, his description of the
great) telescope filling the mind with awe and
reverence, though some have pronounced it a prosaic
theme for poetry
Professor Huxley and Professor Tyndall were
among our visitors m those days, and well I remember
the S'we with which upon a few occasions I regarded
them; and there were others less well known at the
times who later rose to eminence If I recollect
rightly, Professor Huxley was beginning to try and

THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
produce life spontaneously from what I irreverently
called a “ boiled vacuum ”
But one of the most vivid impressions left on my
mind is that at least halfthe world at that time must
have been busying itself m an effort to produce per­
petual motion—a secret the present generation seem
to have solved for themselves without any trouble!
Everyone with a turn for invention appeared to
indulge it with a passionate desire to set something
going that would never stop. No particular aim
seemed to be in view; nothing necessarily to be
achieved; it was in fact hard to see what could be
achieved, as one of the first essentials was the
absence of all resistance, including the friction of the
atmosphere
Elaborate devices of cog-wheels and scales, wheels
in vacuums, wheels not in vacuums—the correct
plural sounds too pretentious—delicate balances,
disks poised on pin-points, clocks which once wbund
up were to go for all eternity, fairy-like pistons worked
by water, devices to eliminate every conceivably form
of friction, and devices that, according to the inven­
tor, appeared to be independent ofmost ofthe known
laws of nature, were continually arriving far my
father’s consideration, and adorned our dining-room
mantelpiece in rows. I
He received a remarkable letter upon one occasion,
among many remarkable letters, from a crank lager
to persuade him the world was not round buZ flat.
A pamphlet accompanied it containing many argu­
ments by the author m support of his contention,
40 T
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
which he hoped would be taught to the students at
the College.
My father replied that he feared it would be diffi­
cult to convince the naval officers in his charge that
the world was flat as so many of them had sailed
round, it 1
The Shah of Persia visited the College while we
were there, and never shall I forget the gorgeousness
of the pageant— a real one and no fake about it!
He and the royal party arrived in the state barges at
the main landing gates and proceeded to the
Painted Hall where they were entertained at lun­
cheon He and his suite wore jewels that sparkled in
the sun as the whole procession walked into the Hall.
My most vivid impression is of the Princess of Wales,
afterwards Queen Alexandra, arm in arm with her
sister, the Tsarina, dressed alike in navy-blue with a
bird’s-eye spot on it!
And throughout all these years my mind was
working; rebelling against the unsatisfactory answers
to problems offered by the orthodox Church,
questioning the authority upon which those answers
were based Why were the books constituting the
Bible/called the Word of God and said to be inspired,
and those called the Apocrypha ruled out as not
inspired?— and who by? How did the “fathers”
know the latter was not inspired'*
Hfow did they know we went to Heaven— or Hell
whewwe died? They did not pretend to knowwhether
we met our friends again; they only hoped; they
admjitted that much. I frankly refused to believe,
41 i
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
without any supporting evidence, that our physical
remains were brought from the grave and caught up
into the air against all the laws of nature—not being
built on the lines of the White Qjieen m “Alice m
Wonderland,” who could believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast1
Above all it puzzled me where to draw the
dividing line between the sheep and the goats. If
halfthe world went up and the other halfwent down,
there must be a sharp and definite boundary line be­
tween the two, and how near to that line was it pos­
sible for a sheep to go without becoming a goat? It
seemed a pity to be unnecessarily good1
It all really did puzzle me and, needless to say, I
got little help from Authority— was only told it was
wrong and irreverent to ask questions and throw
doubt upon the Word of God; I should have more
faith, when what I wanted to be sure of was thjat it
was the Word of God I
I was thrown back upon myself as scores of cither

My mother died while we were at Greenwich.
With the inexperience of childhood, life lost for the
tame all its colour, seemed as though it would always
be grey, never the same again That is part of the
tragedy of youth
The Sunday before she was taken ill— she was ill
for five days only— I had what is called a “ true”
dream I dreamt I went to my room— at that tame
my mother was m her usual health— and on the bed
was laid out an entire set of mourning clothes.
Mournmg was mourning m those days, and it was
all dead black and heavily laden with crape. It was
a vivid dream and I mentioned it to several people.
That day week the mournmg was there My dream
had come true! I suppose some friend or guardian
from the beyond had tried to convey to me some sort
of warning of the blow about to fall
Not that I had any claims to psychic gifts, cer­
tainly not at that time. We all have our moments
probably when conditions make it possible for con­
tacts to be made I can remember nothing further
of the sort happening to me for many years, but
about this time I began to speculate— stimulated by
my own loss and the sight of my father’s deep sorrow
43
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
—as to whether, if we really did survive, it might not
be possible to get into touch somehow with the
people who had gone before. Stones of “ghosts”
offered an interest such as they never had previously.
If these visitors from the other world, recognizable
by their friends, could appear, it must be the result
somehow of natural law—for the idea of “miracles”
had gone by the board long before1
If they could appear now and then, they must be
there all the time, and the trouble was—why could
we not see them'*
This started a new subject for argument among the
young generation of the family, the insuperable
obstacle to any conclusions I could bring to them
being the impossibility ofpersuading them to believe
in ghosts at all on the evidence available1
Among other men ofscience of the day Sir George
Airey, the Astronomer Royal, stands out m my early
memories. My father and I used sometimes to walk
up to the Observatory m Greenwich Park to have
tea with him and his daughters I used to look at his
head and think about all the knowledge there was
stored in it—and where would that knowledge go
when he died? How could he take it with hfrn to
another world if his head was left here? I ’jwas
allowed to see the great telescope with its enormous
field of vision shifting as the earth revolved on its
axis. I saw the craters m the moon through it once,
and was terribly intrigued about the other sid,e of
that satellite which we have never seen, prompted, It
may be said, by the curiosity which is supposed to be

a vice of my sex But if the other sex were entirely
free from it we should never have got to the North
Pole'
It filled me too with an odd sort of awe— and does
still—to realize that our feet point plumb to the
centre of the earth, and that the great cosmic law
of gravitation has to be put into operation to prevent
us from turning upside down'
Schoolroom tea was a great institution in those
days, into which friends and acquaintances drifted
between four and five, including various well-known
sailors and men who were to become well-known
later on. Sir Edmund Commerell, a frequent visitor,
was always an object of morbid interest to us young­
sters, owing to the fact that he had a *‘slug” embedded
m the neighbourhood of his lungs, an unpleasant
memento ofthe Ashanti war Prince Louis ofBatten-
berg, who was First Sea Lord at the Admiralty at
the time the Great War broke out, was a young
lieutenant— or sub-lieutenant—at the College, and
paid his farewell call on my mother with a face
patterned with adhesive plaster, owing to a con­
troversy with a messmate who had emphasized his
remarks with a claret decanter1
Sir Leopold McChntock was another admiral who
came to our schoolroom teas— of Arctic fame; it is
said he was directed in his discovery of the body of
Franklin by “spirit guidance.” The story of it is as
follows:
After several fruitless Government expeditions in
search of Sir John Franklin's remains in the Arctic
45
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
regions, Sir Leopold McClmtock, in the Fox,
equipped by Lady Franklin and some of her friends,
succeeded m solving the mystery, although in the
opinion of the experts it would remain unsolved
“unless by some unexpected miracle ”
The “miracle” materialized, and for the account
of it I am indebted to Lieutenant G Hunt, late
R N and at present Curator of the Museum at the
Royal Naval College, Greenwich, m the book which
he kindly lent to me, “ Sir John Franklin A Reve­
lation,” pubhshed in 1889, a detailed account of the
incident is to be found
At a time when everyone believed the ill-fated
expedition was to be sought for m the neighbourhood
ofWellington Channel, and five vam attempts in that
area had been made by the Government, a little
girl, daughter of Captain Coppin, who lived at
Londonderry, had a vision
Captain Coppin had lost a child of four years old,
and the rest of his family were often conscious of
“Weasy’s” presence about the house, and one even­
ing her sister asked her to tell them where the
Franklin expedition was to be found. Immediately
the sister saw on the floor a complete Arctic scene,
with two ships embedded in blocks of ice, with a
dear channel leading up to them. The child seems
to have caught up the conditions, as we know
to be so often the case with mediums, and shivered
with cold She at once drew a careful and skilfully
outlined chart of what she saw.
She then asked how the spot was to be reached and
46
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
on the wall opposite m large letters there appeared *
“ Erebus and Terror Sir John Franklin. Lancaster
Sound Prince Regent Inlet Point Victory. Victoria
Channel ”
No such place at that time was to be found on the
charts
Lady Franklin was at the time sending out a fresh
expedition with Wellington Channel still their
objective, and after some cogitation and natural
reluctance Captain Coppm decided to tell her of his
little daughter’s vision The chart and the story
differed so entirely from all preconceived opinion
that he doubted if he would be believed For­
tunately, the story brought back to Lady Franklin’s
memory something Sir John had said about his
return voyage before leaving, and so convinced was
she that there might be something m the vision, that
she decided the second ship m the proposed search
expedition was to follow the child’s chart
Needless to say, the whole army of scoffers and
sceptics were immediately to the fore—which per­
haps was not to be wondered at in those early days
of psychic research It directed the search to be
made in an entirely new district instead of the
Wellington Channel But Lady Franklin persisted;
the second ship of the expedition, commanded by
Captain McChntock, was to go by the chart that had
appeared on the floor— a “little child should lead
them,” and m spite of discouragement from official
quarters, the area to be searched was to be that
described on the wall of the room.
47
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
To recount the details ofthe voyage would take up
too much space but, as all the world knows, within
the area indicated on the chart the cylinder with the
full record of Franklin’s expedition was found, with
the history of the attempt and failure written on the
margin of the document, with Franklin’s death and
the total losses at the time In the Victoria Channel
the ships had found their grave A little way from
Point Victory a boat was found, in which were two
skeletons and some guns
The writer of the book remarks that Captain
Kennedy, who commanded the other ship, admitted
his failure through not having followed the route
pointed out by the child, and that Sir Leopold
McChntock was “ often struck at the literal truth
of what the little girl must have seen ”
Admiral Nares at this time was on the eve of
starting on his Arctic expedition in command of the
Alert and Discovery, and though the expedition failed
to reach the North Pole, it did yeoman service of a
scientific nature in other ways I was proud to have
helped to make one of the Union Jacks earned by
the sledges later on1
The sailor’s life is perhaps conducive to contacts
from the “other side,” especially in the old days,
when for weeks and even months they were in close
touch with nature in her grandest moods. Living
at high tension very often, danger never very far
away, nerves and attention stretched to the limit
of endurance, are capable of reactions denied to
more normal moments; just as you will get a high

note out of a fiddle string at its tautest that is not
possible when it is slack.
My father, although he would have called himself
a sceptic so far as psychic experience goes as we
know it to-day, used to speak of two incidents in his
hfe that had made an impression upon him, without
any attempt to explam them
When passing an important examination in
mathematics as a heutanant at the old R N College
he dreamt the solution to a difficult problem and,
acting on it, passed with flying colours
On another occasion he was in command of the
Bulldog and was carrying as passengers the British
Ambassador to Rome and his party during the
trouble in Italy of *48. They were running up a long
bay or arm of the sea with, according to the charts,
ample deep water when my father joined his guests
at the dinner-table below
After a short time he became uneasy, reassured
himselfby remembering the chart, sent up to find out
what the soundings were, and told himselfthere was
no cause for alarm
Qjiite suddenly, however, and, as he thought,
unreasonably, his uneasiness returned with great
urgency; he ran up on deck and with no apparent
justification gave the order to go full-speed astern
As the vessel lost way her bows ran gently into a
sandbank that had silted up at the head of the bay!
It had not, by some error, been charted. Owing to
his prompt action there was little difficulty in extri­
cating the ship from what might otherwise have
49
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
been a serious position, but he could never account
for the urge that sent him racing up on deck
That is the story as he told it to me and, m spite
of the years that are gone, it is, I think, accurately
recorded.
A small picture stands out m my memory, a
vignette of a little incident at Greenwich— of my
sister at the age of eight, curls bobbing about her
head as she moved, running to and fro between the
grass lawns of the College and the railings along the
river path, with hastily gathered bunches of daisies
which she presented to a row of grimy little hands
thrust through the railings to receive them1 In the
love of flowers surely all the world is kin1 As Mrs.
Stawell she has made a name for herself since as a
translator of French into English, particularly m
connexion with books dealing with the French
Revolution and its period
From Greenwich we went to the North American
Station for two years, a very pleasant life for a girl
from sixteen to eighteen years old During the
six summer months the Fleet had its headquarters
m Halifax, Nova Scotia; during the winter at
Bermuda We made the transit twice a year on
board the Flag-ship, crossing the Gulf Stream, the
masses of gulf-weed reminding one of Christopher
Columbus and the legends of dark, weed-infested
oceans of his day.
It was a gay life, lawn tennis, much dancing on
board ship and on shore, boat-sailing—I won many
a race with my hand on the tiller—dodging about
iO
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
among island and coral reef m a real birch-bark
canoe presented to me by the North American
Indians of Nova Scotia, and in which I was twice
capsized and had to swim ashore with the canoe m
front ofm e1 I have wondered smce whether the good
feeling and gratitude engendered by that act has
influenced my relations with the Red Indian
“controls,” for whom I have a sincere respect and
affection, so often receiving from them friendlv
messages through third persons
There was an earthquake and a hurricane while
we were m Bermuda— and a centipede quite six
inches long inside my mosquito curtains when I
woke up one morning I have never got out of bed so
quickly before or since
Captain, afterwards Lord Fisher, was my father’s
flag-captain for part of our time on the North
American Station. We knew him all our lives; he
was one of my earhest recollections m nursery days,
when he was a young heutenant on board the
Excellent I could tell many an incident of hfe out
there which might have its interest, both grave and
gay, but would be perhaps outside the purpose of
this book
From Bermuda we visited many of the West
Indian Islands, the Fleet being, of course, feted and
entertained everywhere, and I remember on one
occasion on landing from the ship for a ball at
Government House at Barbados, with a heavy sea
running, having to take our opportunity ofspringing
on to the landing-stage when the launch hovered
51
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
momentarily on the crest of a wave, in our ball-
dresses with long trains to them1 A crowd of laugh­
ing negresses met us on thejetty and cut offso many
bits of my blue sash for “souvenir” that by the time
we reached Government House I had hardly any of
it left!
One of the greatest thrills life has given me was to
stand at my father’s side and hear every gun m the
Fleet thundering out a salute to him—not so much
for the personal element as that for the moment he
stood for all the glories of the British Navy1
Mark Twain visited Bermuda and came to
Admiralty House while we were there, a special
object of reverence, as “Tom Sawyer” had been
published not so very long before and was being
read with avidity by young and old The author
remained in the island for a short visit, but was
unfortunate m the weather—Bermuda can be as
damp as anywhere when it puts its mind to it—
having, as he described it, rained hot water for a
week; he went back to New York I have the honour
to be an Honorary Fellow of the Mark Twain
Society of America, a literary society created since
his death.
Bermuda m those days was a comparatively quiet
corner of the globe, not easily got at A steamer
plied between the islands— Bermuda is a group of
365 islands, some no more than a coral reef— and
New York, carrying not only the mails and passen­
gers, but onions, one of the staple products, and
tomatoes, less insistent on advertising their
52
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
proximity! To look over the gunwale of a boat on a
radiant, sunny day straight down into the emerald
deeps of a Bermuda sea was to open the gates of a
fairyland, the mysteries of a fascinating world just
out of reach Great waving forests of seaweed,
swaying unceasingly, rhythmically, at the bidding
of a restless ocean, spiky fingers ofcoral pointing up­
wards, passing flotsam, glistening “angel” fish dart­
ing in and out of a brown and orange undergrowth;
and patches of yellow sand, all as clearly revealed
as though through the glass of an aquarium And
on the surface, paper-white Portuguese men-o’-war,
fragile, sailing their delicate shells, making heavy
weather of every ripple— and ready to give you a
very nasty sting should you be rash enough to inter­
fere with their course!

IFE at Halifax during the summer months was
equally full of colour and incident, but m spite
of external excitements the thread ofserious thought
never ceased to wind and weave itselfinto the back­
ground of my days, were they for the moment ever
so concerned with the affairs of this world.
I heard many banalities from many pulpits;
ceased to ask questions to which experience had
taught me I should get no answers, and, as I left the
schoolroom behind gradually, accepted the fact that
if I wanted solutions to problems that refused to
cease from troubling, I should have to find them for
myself, which is perhaps what we all have to do
sooner or later I never lost faith m what seemed to
me the basis ofscientific truth underlying the history
and facts as recorded m the Bible; it was the inter­
pretation, or want of interpretation, offered by
orthodoxy that common sense and an innate respect
for natural law—God’s laws—perforce rejected, in­
cluding miracles in the generally accepted meaning
of the word. But I believed m the phenomena
recorded as a matter of history Christ Himself
claimed to work through the law, not against it.
I accepted them not as miracles outside law, but as
demonstrations of super-physical laws so far beyond
54
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
our knowledge; an attitude I have lived to see to
some extent justified through the discoveries of
science and personal experiences in the stance-
room—and having proved so much to be true I can
wait patiently for the solution of the rest.
At the Sunday morning services on board ship,
which we generally attended, nothing very sug­
gestive or erudite was wont to come from the
pulpit, I am afraid my attention during the sermon
on such occasions took lively excursions into the
fourth dimension or time-space, or anvwhere except
the dimension m which it should have remained *
In the absence of a chaplain the service on board a
ship, of course, is taken and the sermon preached by
the captain; and there is a story told of one who
afterwards became a well-known admiral who, quite
unversed m theology, found himself in this position.
He spoke briefly but with the voice of authority,
taking for his text, Eternity
“ Eternity,” he told the ship’s company, “is very
difficult to understand None of you men can hope
to understand it Great minds in all ages have failed
to understand it Even I can hardly understand it
Pipe down
Would that all our knotty pomts could be disposed
of so simply1
One of the finest sights I remember was that of the
Fleet progressing up the wide waters of the St.
Lawrence and coming to anchor under the cliffs
upon which stands the historic city of Qjiebec.
From there we cruised to the northern waters of
55
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Newfoundland, off which, in the following year on
our way home, we came on icebergs m latitude not
far removed from that m which the Titantc met her
tragic fate
The sailor has always been renowned for his super­
stition, and my father, wishing to throw discredit
upon evil tradition, on one occasion ordered the start
for our return to Bermuda to be made on a Friday.
He hit upon an inauspicious moment, for north
of the Gulf Stream we encountered so violent a gale
of wind that the ships were in considerable danger,
and it was even reported m the American newspapers
that the flag-ship had gone to the bottom.
To which the moral will doubtless be pointed
according as you believe in Friday’s ill-luck or not!
The fogs m those latitudes are well-known and we
were once hung up for three days outside Halifax—
an experience that inspired the following, written
many years afterwards, one ofthe first ofmy poetical
effusions to appear m print It has also figured in
“ The Writers’ Club Anthology” , and is shortly to
appear in another.
A FOG AT SEA
Silent and grey ’neath ocean’s sombre thrall
The stagnant moisture hangs ’twixt sea and sky
Drenching m dark salt mist relentlessly
All that within its soft embrace may fall
While unseen dangers lurk beyond the pall
Of hidden mystery. Nor any sigh
Of faintest breath is there, nor seabird’s cry
To break the sullen silence over all.
56
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
The water with a restless strength endowed
Laps gently m famt effort to be free
And drip, and drip, and drip from mast and shroud
With soft reiteration ceaselessly,
Is all that breaks the hush of that grey cloud
Wrapping m gloomy union sky and sea
Rose Champion de Crespigny.
Looking back on it all now, the life then seems to
belong to another plane of existence altogether The
curtain came down on that particular phase of it so
far as I was concerned, when we came home and at
the age of eighteen I married, and for family and
financial reasons my husband, who had been a
lieutenant on board the flag-ship on the North
American Station, retired from the service He was a
brother of Sir Claude Champion de Crespigny,
sometimes called the sporting baronet, a great lover
of sport and games of all kinds, and with a passion
for flowers and gardening. He was a fine golfer
and played cricket for his county He was not
interested m my particular lines of thought, except
in so far as he liked to hear about what I was reading
and writing, and, since his passing, has told me what
a great assistance even the little he knew had been
in adapting himself to the new conditions m which
he found himself
We settled down in that loveliest tract of English
scenery, the New Forest, to what might be called
over thirty years ofideal married life— happy in spite
of financial and other worries, and the usual buffets
fate deals to most of us when we axe not looking.
57 s
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
But the old problems, although dormant for the
time being, were still very much alive
When I had read all the novels I had not been
allowed to read m the schoolroom1
—adapted myself
to the conditions of a life so different from that m
the past; had m fact, had time to look round, the
serious side of thought and speculation re-asserted
itself, the everlasting riddle again raised a head only
temporarily suppressed I found myself tackling the
old vexed questions that so persistently eluded
solution, and that all the sifting and winnowing m
the world seemed to end m conclusions more destruc­
tive than constructive m their nature
From rural pulpits m those days there was little
to be gleaned— whatever may be the case now— of
theological argument likely to assuage the doubts of
the sceptic The dogmas presented were narrow and
unsatisfying, full of leakages, so it seemed to me, that
required a good bit of tinkering before they would
hold water
In a parish not far removed from our own a
sermon was actually preached when aeroplanes first
came into use to the effect that man, not having
been provided with wings, was flouting Providence
by flying m His face No witticism was intended.
When the congregation broke up, a retired naval
man shouted to a friend across the churchyard
“ Have you got web feet?” and on being answered m
the negative, asked what in that case he meant by
swimming, when a beneficent Providence had
evidently intended him for dry land!
58
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
A situation between Ghuich and Science that
surely takes us back to the days of Galileo1
What are commonly called “ghost-stories” had
always greatly interested me It must be remem­
bered that at the time of which I am writing,
spiritualism as we know it to-day, and psychic
research were only beginning to emerge from a
chaotic muddle of tradition, rumour and sensational
accounts of apparitions that were for the most part
attributed to hysteria and hallucination, and consid­
ered beneath the serious attention of sensible people
But with the inception of the Society for Psychical
Research, and greatly owing to the efforts of the
late Mr W T Stead, beginning with the publication
of “Juba’s Letters” and the establishment of the
“Bureau”— object of so much newspaper witticism
at the time, m which I regret to say I was at first
inclined to j’oin—the subject of psychical research
began to be more widely talked about When such
names as Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir
William Barrett and others began to be linked up
with serious investigation, the roots became estab­
lished from which has sprung a spreading tree of
knowledge that is now bringing hope and consola­
tion to mankind m every part of the habitable globe.
While spiritualism was going through these early
struggles—and by spiritualism I mean the belief m
and practice of communication with the so-called
dead—theosophy was attracting a good deal of
attention among those who were not only serious
thinkers but had a certain power of “ vision.”
59
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Materialism was rapidly spreading with the advance
of education and its consequent effect on the general
level ofmentality The world at large was beginning
to think for itselfand m the tenets of theosophy could
find a rational and logical solution of many riddles—
up to a point
It interested me as it interested others. It answered
so many questions to which otherwise there appeared
to be no answer It finally disposed of the old
orthodox trappings ofHeaven, the wings and crowns,
and the conditions of the life hereafter, so hopelessly
removed from any possible conception of an ordinary
three-dimensional brain accustomed to seek for law
and order m all things It made it possible to accept
a much more rational idea of the world to come,
without m any way rejecting the fundamentals of
the Christianity m which I had been brought up.
My reading was catholic and avid Huxley,
Darwin, Haeckel, Alfred Russel Wallace, Herbert
Spencer, all came as grist to an insatiable mill, and
that epoch-making book, “Natural Law m the
Spiritual World,” in which Professor Drummond, at
the nsk of bemg accused of heresy and blasphemy,
was brave enough to suggest that law and order as
we understand it might extend to worlds other than
the physical, that a scheme of evolution having in it
no gaps, no lapses from the eternal cosmic laws of
cause and sequence, was a nobler conception and
more worthy of its Creator than a scheme liable to
arbitrary interference and interruption, even by the
Hand presumably responsible for its creation
60
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Professor Drummond in effect put into words what
so many had been groping for, whose intelligence
forced them to believe m the principle oflaw working
more or less automatically from a first cause, but
who were instinctively reluctant to let the old
traditions go and accept the alternative— a material­
ism that every fibre of bram and mind assured them
was a stone and not bread
That, unknown to himself, Professor Drummond
was endowed with pronounced psychic gifts seems
probable according to his biographers He radiated
apparently a personal influence of which all who
came in contact with him were aware Most writers
— all m fact ofthose who practise any ofthe arts— are
conscious of some inspiring influence at times that ap­
pears to be quite outside themselves, and m “Natural
Law in the Spiritual World” traces of these inspira­
tional sources are evident to those whose experience
has been sufficient to make intelligent comparisons
Qjiotmg from an article published some years
ago by A W Trethewy, well-known as the author
of “The Controls of Stamton Moses,” we find
comparison made between some of the character­
istics of Drummond’s writings and automatic script,
and Mr Trethewy finishes his article with the
query: “Is it not possible that he was inspired by a
higher power more than he realized? May he not
have been a channel for a further instalment of
revelation, and may not some of his theories which
are criticized as weak in scientific argument be
anticipations offuture discovery?”
61
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Truly a great book; throwing a wider and deeper
npple across the surface of contemporary thought
than this generation, accustomed to a greater tol­
eration, can realize It is easy to be wise after the
event, and to accept what others have been at pams
to discover, and even to imagine you have known it
all the time
My sister, when seven or eight years old, was shown
the church window at Folkestone put up to the mem­
ory of Harvey When told that he had discovered
that the blood in our bodies continually circulates:
“ Good gracious1” she exclaimed “ Why, I could
have told him that1”
I have found m life that necessity is not the
mother of invention only, but of most of the effort
that has “made the world go round,” and that one
of the most eloquent arguments in favour of an
Intelligence behind the universe as against the purely
mechanistic theory seems to lie in “nature’s” power
of prevision A cosmos produced from chaos through
automatic processes, an exclusively emergent evolu­
tion might be admitted, for the sake of argument, to
have found birth in a “fortuitous concourse ofatoms”
— wherever they may be supposed to have come
from—and subsequent developments be the result of
an endless chain of cause and effect
But what of the evidence of looking ahead on the
part of “nature,” of what appears to be an ordered
arrangement of machmery for the bringing about or
inhibition of certain eventualities?
How account for the foresight that gave man a
62
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
physical body for whose sustenance and well-being
physical food is a necessity, the acquisition of which
is dependent upon his own exertions? If it had not
been for the immutable law that he should dig for his
dinner, would a hand’s turn of work ever have been
got out ofhim? The necessity for food made a hunter
of him m the first instance, or, as m hot countries
where food is easily obtainable and a little goes a
long way, is it not more likely he would have been
content to lie on the beach and throw pebbles into
the sea? But the body must be fed, and there are
other instances of a controlling force of sufficient
intelligence to foresee certain contingencies and to
provide for them
Natural inhibitions that have so often cropped up
m the history of man’s advance, point surely m the
same direction, inhibitions that have automatically
raised barriers and prevented his discoveries in
physical law and extended opportunities for the
exercise of free-will, to outrun his sense of respon­
sibility According to Professor Millikan, the
American physicist, the latter will always keep pace
with the former The Angel with the flaming sword
has never ceased his vigil, but continues to safeguard
mankind m his ignorance and presumption from self-
destruction
Perhaps it was natural that with so much working
and seething m my brain, I should feel an urge
toward the expression of it m some form In the first
instance this certainly sprang fiom a desire to clarify
and tabulate thought and ideas for my own satis-
63
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
faction, rather than any wish to mfhct it on my
fellow creatures I began to write about ghosts—
short articles trying to prove there was nothing
supernatural m apparitions, but that it would prob­
ably be found such phenomena obeyed some law
which at the moment we did not understand It did
not seem common sense to reject wholesale the
testimony of so many persons otherwise reliable and
obtainable at first hand, nor should tradition be
entirely discredited by the majority merely because
they had had no experience of such phenomena
themselves Mr Stead’s “Borderland” came out and
excited a great deal of interest, and the S P R were
beginning to collect and tabulate stones of reputed
“hauntmgs” and attracting the attention of quite
senous-minded people
But there were other urges goading at me As the
responsibilities of married life increased, I became
vividly aware of the necessity for some definite and
strenuous effort to “balance the budget” 1 And this
is the point at which I return to the statement that
invention is not necessity’s only offspring It may be
humiliating but is nevertheless true that she will
plumb depths m the individual that would otherwise
lie undisturbed, her whip can be as compelling as
that of any slave-driver She countenances no
keeping of talents m napkins, but will bring to the
blossoming all there is m either man or woman with
ruthless pertinacity
I can honestly say that had it not been for the
exigencies of various financial crises—to make mole-
64
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
hills into mountains—the little that I have attempted
to do m the world would probably have been left
undone, not so much perhaps to the world’s detri­
ment as to my own, when accounts are finally made
up
I always had a passion for painting, and worked
hours a day to teach myself, as m the heart of the
Forest the ordinary channels for learning were out
of reach Having been brought up by and on the
sea, my efforts ran m that direction I believe it is
often the case that artists, although finding themselves
in quite different surroundings, will revert to the
type of environment in which they have been bom
and bred and attain their happiest results, the
surroundings of youth making an indelible impres­
sion on a young and growing brain
Anyway, in the middle of the verdant glades and
heather-clad stretches of the New Forest I wanted
to paint ships1
And paint ships I did, travelling here and there on
the quest, within reach of the battleships at Ports­
mouth, and studying the varied craft on the Thames,
from red-sailed barges to full-rigged ships, m and
below the London Pool I had many “ one-man”
shows m Bond Street, and exhibited otherwise a
great deal, a fact continually referred to in the
séance-room and given as “ evidence” from the other
side
Before the War I could state the displacement and
armament of every battleship m the Navy and most
of the cruisers When the “hush-hush” régime arose,
65
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
naturally sources of information as well as oppor­
tunities for drawing them ceased With a growing
family, money melts as quickly—or more so— as it
materializes, the evidence of work done lies in the
many pictures of mine that are scattered over the
world, some of which have been reproduced m
newspapers and elsewhere
I also, while m my twenties, started to write a
novel, of which the foundation came m a dream, and
whatever its faults no one could have accused it of
dullness1
It was called “ From the Grave,” and m the first
chapter the hero, having apparently died of an
obscure variety of catalepsy—which I feel sure would
have greatly interested the medical profession—was
buried alive and the coffin deposited in the family
vault The undertaker had evidently not made a
good job of it, for the occupant, having come to,
pushed up the lid without any difficulty, sat up and
looked over the edge—-just m time to see the villain
of the piece enter the vault and bury a dead body
under the stones of the floor
The rest of the story was equally gripping, and it
was accepted by the editor of a magazine m the
North He asked for my photograph and biography
— at which I am not surprised— and published the
first number The magazme immediately collapsed,
whether as the result of my contribution or not never
transpired, but the editor eloped with the rest of the
story, and I have neither seen nor heard of it since—
and I hope I never shall1
66
CHAPTER SIX
HAT first effort was followed by a second, this
time on less lurid lines I had a strong desire to
write a story embodying the philosophy of life that
had been gradually shaping as the years went on
But it is not easy to put such a thesis convincingly m
the form of fiction
At the moment I was interested m the hypnotic
experiments earned out by Charcot and others at
La Chanté in Pans, more particularly where they
dealt with the transference of certain diseases from
one subject to anothei It seemed to me that here
was possibly a clue to the principle of vicarious
pumshment, an idea I followed up many years later,
and that formed the basis of an article I wrote that
was published in the Nineteenth Century, and that will
be dealt with at length m a subsequent chapter.
So m the new venture m fiction, a thread ofhypno­
tism ran through the fabric of it, politics also played
a part I have no recollection of the story now;
according to the psychologists it is stored somewhere
m my subconscious memory, and I can only hope
nothing will bring it to the surface again. My
leading lady was a sort of modem version of Hypatia
and Sappho welded into one The manuscript went
the round of the London publishers without getting
67
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
a kind word from any one of them, and finally came
to roost m my wastepaper basket1
The determination, however, to write a novel that
would find a publisher remained unshaken Faint
though still pursuing, I gave up trying to be clever,
and served an apprenticeship m short-story and
article writing, and some years later “From Behind
the Arras” came out m Fisher Unwin’s First Novel
Library and launched me seriously on my career as a
writer The thrill of the moment that first book saw
the light has never been eclipsed by any ofthe twenty-
two novels of which I have since been guilty—
an experience I believe common to most of the
craft
It was shortly after that first early attempt that I
met Laurence Oliphant We were fellow guests at a
house in Scotland, and at the time his wntings were
attracting a good deal of attention He was attempt­
ing flights in philosophy and theological problems
that fitted m with the awakening mentality of the
time Minds were beginning to question the un-
assailabihty of the old traditions, to reach out
toward something more satisfying to the intelligence
than mere statement from authorities that could
bring forward no credentials,and Laurence Oliphant,
with his suggestions of a philosophy founded on
rational deductions, had a following
Looking back m the tight of these later years he
stands out as a remarkable personality; m essence,
however vehemently he might have denied the
impeachment, a spiritualist As a matter of fact,
68
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
I believe he admitted it, but the word was rarely
heard m those days
He openly professed to be conscious of the con­
stant presence of his dead wife, that she stood behind
his chair at the dinner-table and on other occasions,
and that he was m frequent communication with her
To have admitted to spiritualism in those days was
to put yourself on a level with a nigger revivalist, or
a “ shaker,” or a follower of any other “ crank”
denomination, m the early days it was considered
not only unintelligent but not respectable, and I am
afraid Mr Oliphant’s professions excited more covert
amusement among his fellow guests than serious
interest He was too shining a light m the literary
firmament for open ridicule, but, at the time, the
genuineness of his psychic gifts was certainly not
recognized We younger ones used to try experi­
ments At the mention ofhis name, were it whispered
ever so softly fiom the far end ofa very long room, he
would turn slowly and stare at the speaker m a most
disconcerting manner No doubt the unbeliever
would suggest unusually good ears, or mere coin­
cidence, but the unvarying result of the experiment
seemed to call for something further m the way of
explanation even to our ribald and ineverent minds1
Another interesting personality I met about this
time was Queen Victoria's marine painter, Sir
Oswald Bnerley I mention him especially in con­
nexion with the name of a ship that figures later on
in these pages
When the Duke of Edinburgh commanded
69
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
H M S Galatea on her voyage round the world,
Mr. Brierley, as he was then, was a passenger in his
capacity as official marine painter My husband was
a sub-lieutenant on board—it was some years before
we first met one another—and he told many stories
of the risks the artist would take and the discom­
forts faced m the determination to capture certain
effects
There is a well-known picture by Bnerley of the
Galatea in a typhoon which they encountered m the
Indian Ocean Undismayed by the desperate
conditions, he stood under the poop, bound to a
stanchion to prevent him from being washed over­
board by the heavy seas continually flooding the
decks Great towering waves came swooping down
on them, sea and sky blended into a blinding mist of
spume and fog, as though all the devils of the deep
had broken bounds m their efforts to engulfthe ship,
a mere cockleshell m the grip offurious nature And
through the welter Brierley sketched, undeterred by
the surrounding chaos, making the studies from
which his picture was ultimately painted, only con­
cerned with keeping his canvas protected from uttci
destruction, and with getting the best effects possible
m the circumstances An instance of what the artist
will brave in the pursuit of his ruling passion
The Queen’s marine painter had not attained to
that position without an intimate knowledge of ships
and sailors, he knew as much of the technical side of
the profession as anyone on board But he loved to
“pull the legs” of the youngsters on board by asking
70
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
questions about the rigging and sails, listening to the
information they were more than ready to impart,
with as much deference as if he had not known all
about it before most of them were bom— until they
found him out1
My husband often talked to me about that cruise;
pruning as it did early in his naval career, it made a
vivid impression and left many memories It was m
its way like a royal progression Queen Victoria’s
subjects m the outlying parts of her dominions, eager
to show their loyalty to her son, wonderful and
lavish hospitahty was shown at every stage of it
At the Australian ports m particular it seemed
enough could hardly be done m their honour, meat,
chickens, fruit were sent on board with a generosity
sufficient to have fed twice their number All as a
free gift; the ship’s company took up savings and
had their share of the general goodwill, and for
years afterwards it was looked upon by both officers
and men as the “time of their hves ”
I am emphasizing this episode as it has a bearing
on the manner of my introduction to definite com­
munication with the other world My husband, for
financial reasons, left the Service when we married;
he became a very fine amateur carpenter and when
the Galatea years later came to an end of her career
and was broken up, a friend, knowing of his skill,
sent him a bit of one of her beams which he made
into a box that is still m my possession
Life in the New Forest was as different from the
life m which I had been brought up and he had
71
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
adopted as can be imagined, but I quickly grew to
love my new surroundings
Communicators from beyond often insist upon the
importance of contacts with growing things, con­
firming what some philosophies teach and many
nature-lovers have beheved through past ages
Some sensitively developed persons say they can
hear plants grow, certainly, during the many hours I
have spent in the heart of the woods, surrounded by
the splendid oaks and beeches of the New Forest, I
have been very conscious of the active life around
me Nor do I think it necessary to have pro­
nounced psychic gifts m order to sense the latent and
active energy of growing trees
The scientists tell us that every centre of chemical
change creates around it a disturbed area m the
ether. The processes of nature m both the animal
andvegetablekingdominvolve chemical changes,pre­
sumably projecting waves into the ether which cause
the disturbance, and thesepresumably may be picked
up by any ultra-sensitive organism within reach.
Living so many years, as I did, not only m constant
contact with these woodland giants, but making of
them a special study from the artist’s point of view,
I grew tofeel the life m them, to know that m laying
my hand on the surface of their shining or rugged
stems as the case might be, I could absorb that hfe,
make their vitality my own, identify myself with
their strength and steadfastness, and through the
wonder of their beauty and the realization of their
undeviating obedience to law, be for the moment
72
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
removed from the material conditions of this world
and nearer to the God who made them.
We are losing something m this mechanical age. It
may bring its own compensations but we seem to be
getting farther from these contacts with the sources
oflife, and contenting ourselves with mere reflections.
In every direction we see the denser forms of matter
intervening between us and the vital springs of life.
We get our drama, our music secondhand; in the
cinema, and m the mechanically worked musical
instruments ofto-day we lose contact with the source,
the life, the living, human emotions that are directly
conveyed by the singer, the instrumentalist, or across
the footlights in the drama, and reacted to by the
audience ready to receive them Conveyed through
the machinery ofinorganic matter we get a reflection
only of the real thing There is no life m it It is the
same with art.
My father once said when looking at a sketch by
one of his sisters: “ Even a bad water-colour is better
than a photograph *
”— not the way one would have
wished to express it perhaps1
— but indicative of the
sense of dissatisfaction with a mechanical reproduc­
tion instead oforiginal creation, be it ever so halting.
Our medicines are synthetically produced from
minerals and chemicals mstead of the magnetically
charged herbs ofthe soilj we are m daily contact with
motor-driven vehicles instead of horses, instinct with
the breath of life; even our letters are typewritten—
which in some cases may be considered an advan­
tage rather than the contrary!

THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Man lives and thrives m the sunlight3but cannot
live in moonlight only Yet it is the same ray, the
one is a mere reflection of the other What has the
comparatively dead matter of the moon done to the
sun-ray? Or is it just a matter of quantity? I think
the race is losing something m this age of mechanical
device Perhaps it gams in other directions
Filled as I was with doubts and scepticism during
the later years of the last century, trying to evolve
for myself a scheme of philosophy that would recon­
cile the doctrines m which I had been brought up
with the advance of scientific discovery and the calls
of common sense, I found the religious education of
my growing family a serious problem I have never
been m sympathy with merely destructive policies,
and would always hesitate to sweep away without
something to offer m replacement There was no
trouble with regard to the ethical side of the ques­
tion, as I considered and do consider, true Christian­
ity as preached by Christ the finest religion
m the world, representing the purest and most
altruistic teaching possible Neither spiritualism nor
anything else has ever presented us with anything
finer In my pre-marriage days I had determined to
allow any children I might ever have to grow up
without prejudice as regards any or all religions and
allow them to take their choice ofthem when arrived
at years of discretion
But when m due course I had a family ofmy own I
discovered it was other people’s children I wished to
try experiment on' So every Sunday morning in
7+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
orthodox fashion we walked, or occasionally drove,
two miles to the village church of Bramshaw, men­
tioned in Doomsday Book, with its ancient yew from
which m the long past bows and arrows for anything
but Christian purposes had been made, and which
was situated, as so many old churches are, on the
apex of a hill inconveniently removed from the
village it served What was given from the pulpit
might not have been particularly inspiring, but the
walk in all weathers was so much to the good m
discipline, and I hoped the Bible truths imbibed
and the habit of church-going might have their
lasting effects.
But one’s best efforts go agley' After years of
church advantages and my own endeavours to
inculcate an understanding of an all-loving, all-
merciful Father, I heard one ofmy sons of about eight
years old, when asked by a well-meaning visitor to
explain what thunder was, answer “I always thought
it was God growling
Theosophy at that time was very much m the air.
A P Sinnett—who later on became a valued friend
— had published his thought-provoking book, “ The
Growth of a Soul,” and his logical arguments and
sound reasoning threw light on much that was
obscure m the Bible It confirmed the conception of
different spheres or planes of progression, and of
hierarchies m the worlds to come, although the
terminology might not be the same The Arhats,
Masters, Brothers, Logoi and so on corresponded to
some extent with the Angels and Archangels of the
75
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Scriptures It taught of the powers latent within us
all, and of the training necessary to the development
of clairvoyance, clairaudience and other powers
beyond the ordinary—a secret knowledge never lost
sight of entirely during the dark ages of ignorance
and materialism, but handed down through the
centuries by such sects as the Gnostics, Rosicrucians,
Freemasons, Quakers and other disciples ofoccultism
For various reasons unnecessary to go into here,
theosophy has failed to make the headway with the
serious-minded public that was at one tame expected
of it, but putting the theory of reincarnation aside,
there is much to be learnt from its conception of the
construction of the various bodies, active and latent,
possessed by man, and from its exposition of the
world that is man’s immediate heritage at death, and
is already here around us; not situated as a locality
far removed m space as the old idea of Heaven
implied, but a change of condition, a re-orientation
of the consciousness, a tuning-m to wave-lengths that
enables us to react to a different and more subtly
constituted environment It taught in days when the
teaching was not so generally accepted as it is now,
since we have been m communication with those
“ beyond,” that man himselfin regard to his charac­
teristics, emotions and mentality is not radically
altered by the phenomenon we call death; and that
the surprising leap in evolution from the ordinary
individual to angel or devil on the casting of the
flesh that orthodoxy had required us to accept, could
be ruled out
76
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
This conception of man’s next state has become so
familiar now that the channels through which it has
filtered are apt to be overlooked and the idea
accepted as though always presented by religious
dogma. It is assuredly to be found m the Scriptures,
but theosophy as well as spiritualism, have been
responsible for getting rid of the old conception of
harps and crowns
I was told ofa well-known bishop at the end of the
War who, in addressing a large gathering of men,
assured them that five minutes after death they were
exactly the same as they were five minutes before.
How did he know?—unless he had been told directly
or indirectly by those already m the future life and
therefore in a position to speak with certainty.
Theosophical theories, to my mind, seemed to fall
in with the more rational conceptions built upon
observation of the natural processes going on around
us. In evolution there seem to be no “gaps,” all
advance, m whatever direction, being accomplished
m steps so ordered and gradual as to be for the most
part imperceptible
But to establish these facts, each one for himself
through direct experience, as theosophy invites, is
to entail an arduous training and the sacrifice of a
vast amount oftime, more than those engaged m the
strenuous life of to-day might be able to give The
practice of Raja Yoga, even m its early steps,
demands time, patience and quiet, and may be prac­
tised for years before definite results are attained.
Those results are attainable, but unless they are
77
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
demonstrable, although invaluable to oneself they
are of no sort of use to others, more is required to
bring comfort to those who mourn and to those, so
rapidly increasing m numbers, who can no longer
accept without question doctrines that had satisfied
a less intellectually developed generation, and for
whose doubts and struggles in .search of light that
might not prove a will-o’-the-wisp, I had so pro­
found a sympathy
So, as a working hypothesis I was— and am—ready
to accept theosophy from a logical and reasonable
point of view, but as real proof of the survival of
personality it was a failure But my own inner con­
viction through experiences of an inner spiritual
nature— I am not speaking of the psychic aspect—
remained unshaken, as was my belief m the Bible,
regarding it as a storehouse of occult, psychic,
scientific and spiritual knowledge, m which was to
be found by those who could rightly interpret it, the
fundamentals of the Christian religion as taught by
Christ, and the survival of personality
And short of this strenuous training for develop­
ment of the inner faculties, acceptance or rejection
o f the theories offered by theosophy obviously
depended upon the clairvoyance or clairaudience of
others.
So what did it amount to? A reversion to the old
position—appeal to Authority, and having been
unable to accept the authority of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, why should I accept that of Madame
Blavatsky?

CHAPTER SEVEN
S
HORTLY after the controversy had been
waged between Professor Huxley and Mr
Gladstone xn the later years of the last century on
the authenticity of the first chapter m Genesis I had
the pleasure of meeting the latter through the intro­
duction of Sir William Harcourt, who was a near
neighbour of ours m the New Forest The discussion
excited a great deal ofpublic interest at the time, and
I had been so warmly m sympathy with Mr. Glad­
stone’s opimons that to meet the author of them was
something of an event He was kind enough sub­
sequently to read the MS of the article on the subject
of the “atonement,” which m rather altered form
appeared years afterwards m the Nineteenth Century,
and encouraged me very much to follow up the line
of thought Since then I had a communication from
the “other side” which has thrown considerable light
upon the opening phrase m the Bible, which Pro­
fessor Huxley had discredited on the plea that
according to the narrative hght was created four
“days” before the sun, presumably the source of it,
came into being, the absurdity of which he pointed
out
Since then a good deal more has been discovered
about light and light-rays and the manner of their
79
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
transmission, and a communicator later on inciden­
tally outlines what might now be recognized as a
reference to the cosmic rays, many years before their
discovery by Professor Millikan
As Mr Gladstone recognized the importance ofthe
question of spiritualism m his day, the confirmation
from “beyond” of his opinions on the first chapter of
Genesis, from one claiming to be endowed with
a wider field of vision, might have interested him
The high peak to which rank materialism attained
during the latter half of the nineteenth century had
at least one beneficial effect. It set, not only the
more highly educated classes, but the man in the
street, thinldng as he had never thought before
The practice of discussing serious subjects, the things
that really matter, began to creep into ordinary
social hfe, different points m theology, arguments
for and against the various forms of religion, were
no longer taboo, and ceased to be “ bad form.”
Mrs Humphry Ward arrested world attention
with “Robert Elsmere,” a presentation, daring in
its novelty, of the orthodox priest beset with doubts
as to1
1the foundation of his faith Edna Lyall,
although not perhaps on the same level of literary
excellence, set the world considering how far a man
was justified in professing an atheism—that would
now be termed agnosticism—due to a perfectly
sincere desire to arrive at truth; both books being a
step toward the breaking down of a religious intoler­
ance that had turned mto argument the age-old
hostilities between science and the Church.
80
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Possibly this deeper plunge into materialism was
pre-ordained by the powers that be to obtain the
reactions necessary to a higher and a more wide­
spread spirituality; a spirituality with a firm founda­
tion, drawing all the faculties of man into the vortex
of essential spirit, adding intellect to the emotional
content as balance to the less stable qualities of
intuitional impulses
My father had died in 1888, after seven years as
First Sea Lord of the Admiralty and three years
spent m retirement on the outskirts of Maidenhead
No man could have left a cleaner record nor a deeper
regret for his loss among the friends who knew him
He shed a radiant influence ofkindness and goodwill
and steadfastness wherever he went, I can see it now
and give it due appreciation, but the young are apt
to take so much for granted, and my girlhood had
been left far behind before I realized how widespread
was this influence Every workman m the Dockyards
in his charge knew he had a friend to come to when
in trouble or distress, and although at the time of
his death he had lived in the neighbourhood of
Maidenhead for only three years, it was a tribute to
the influence of his personality that during the hour
of his funeral the principal shops in the town put
up their shutters and flags were flown at half-mast.
There is a window to his memory m the parish
church.
His death was very sudden A telegram was sent
to me late in the evening, which was not delivered
until the following morning But, again, as at the
81
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
time my mother died, although unaware ofhis death,
I dreamt uneasily throughout the mght I was
looking for him—searching, searching, in a grey
city of high walls lit by a dim twilight It has always
been a comfort to me that I failed to find him
When later on I found what I had been seeking for
so many years— a sure foundation for faith m a here­
after, he was one of the first to come and speak to
me
In September 1912 my husband died after a long
and trying illness We had been inseparable com­
panions, and leaving the home so full of memories,
I came to London, and embarked on the third phase
of life that for me seems almost to have been divided
definitely into three acts, the curtain coming down
sharply between each.
My daughter and two sons being out m the world
and living their own lives— as each generation
should— I was moie than grateful to the Powers that
be for making it necessary to carry on the painting
and writing that by dint of much real work had been
steadily developing durmg those years spent m the
country. There is nothing like hard work for easing
the sadnesses of life, and from the first I was able to
fix my eyes on the future instead of dwelling on the
past Too much so, perhaps, some of my friends
think, for if I express impatience for the moment
when the door to the “great Adventure” will be
opened I am told I am morbid 1
I did a great deal of sketching on the river during
the first year or two m London The days alone by
82
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
the riverside, watching the many craft moving up
and down, suited my mood I had permits for all
sorts of points of vantage, the penny steamboat
piers, the river police stations, the Port of London
jetties, and most especially the frontage of the
Custom House, a luxurious sketching ground, and
much to be recommended to any who wish to go and
do likewise
I had many amusing adventures when m search of
subjects, such as arriving at a river police station
armed with my permit, to be received by a dubious-
looking sergeant, who assured me the landing-stage
on which I proposed to pitch easel and chair would
be rather dirty It was a blazing hot day with a sky
of brass, ideal for sketching, and it was going to take
more than dirt to deter me
“What sort of dirt'”5 I asked
“ They are landing bags of sugar,” he replied still
more discouragingly; I got the impression, in fact,
that my room, as they say, would be more welcome
than my company—which added to my determina­
tion to enforce the privileges of the permit
“ I don’t mind sugai,” I replied firmly
“ It’s brown sugar,” he added
“ I don’t care what kind of sugar it is,” I protested
“ It’s melting in the sun,” he eyed me tentatively,
“and turning into treacle— all over the landing-
stage,” he finished.
The sergeant won.
I could relate many amusing little incidents of the
sort, but would like to register this fact; that never
83
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
in all my wanderings on the river and its purlieus
have I ever—except on one occasion when I lost
my way in the neighbourhood of the Docks—
encountered anything but the greatest civility from
everyone with whom I came m contact I found the
bargee, accredited m general with language more
picturesque than polished, always ready to let me on
board his barge, anxious to furnish me with water or
any other concomitant ofthe artist’s trade within his
reach, and I could only come to the conclusion that
the language attributed to him is after all only skin
deep1
Then, not long before the machines of war ripped
their way through the peace of nations, and turned
life into temporary chaos, I met Mrs Etta Wnedt
It was m May 1914'
Everyone with any knowledge of this subject of
psychic research knows Mrs Wnedt as a celebrated
medium for the direct voice Her home is m Detroit,
but at one time she spent a great deal of time m
London and was well-known to all the prominent
pioneers of the moment at that time. To her I owe
one of the greatest pnvileges of my life—my first
introduction to Sir Oliver Lodge, who has many a
time extended a helpmg hand when I have been
floundering m doubt or difficulty
I was introduced to Mrs Wriedt by a man who at
the time was a mere acquaintance, afterwards
developing into an intimate friend—the late Colonel
E R Johnson, who knew nothing of my life in the
past, had never met my husband and who first
8+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
mentioned Mrs Wnedt’s name to me in casual
conversation
S
TI may as well confess at once that I was full of
prejudice; no objections on principle, nor disbelief
m the possibility of communication, but I was
“ up against” mediums m any form, connecting them
with fraud, hoaxes and audiences of credulous
people ready to swallow anything that came along,
which latter is an attitude often adopted by persons
toward others who happen to believe something they
themselves do not1
All I can say m extenuation is that I took the means
at hand to correct these erroneous conclusions, and
quickly realized that I was faced with a marvellous
truth that every sense I possessed of logic, under­
standing and reason told me was fundamental and
had been there waiting for man to open the door to
it ever since the world began
I had disliked the very word medium, although
now I know no other teim so aptly describes the
living organism that appears to be the link be­
tween physical, ethenc and astral conditions—
the intermediary wave-length that can contact
both worlds Every known force in nature re­
quires a medium through which it can make itself
manifest, without it our senses are unaware of its
existence Electricity, magnetism, gravitation must
have a means of manifestation. Séances, sittings,
circles were all terms which in my ignorance were
the expression of the entire gamut of trickery and
imposition, but in spite of that I was ever conscious
85
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
ofthe inborn conviction that somewheie lay the clue
to communication between ourselves and those who
had passed on to another woild—a common-sense
world of some kind, unconnected with harps and
wings, and that if we could only put our hand on the
key we could open the door It was something impos­
sible to put into words—an echo perhaps that clung
to me and had come with me into this life from
somewhere else?
So, as I was always ready for adventure, I felt the
experiment could do no harm even if it led to
nowhere ; through the kind offices of Colonel
Johnson a sitting was arranged, my name bemg kept
m the background, and on a fine bright day m May
I found myself at a house m Wimbledon which I
learnt later had once belonged to Mr W T Stead
The knowledge of technical procedure m psychical
research has so advanced during the last twenty
years, and experiences m the séance-room become so
widespread that it seems superfluous to go into a
detailed description of the conditions under which
my first séance was held, but as I hope to interest
readeis who perhaps have not been able to gam
first-hand experience for themselves, I will give a
briefdescription of the technical differences between
a “direct voice” séance and that of the variety
known as “ trance ”
Etta Wnedt never went into trance, so far as I
know She remained throughout the sitting her
fully conscious self, enteung into the conversations
m her ordinary voice, remembering afterwards all
86
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
that had taken place, and on many occasions over­
lapping with her own conversation the voices of
communicators trying to “come through ”
On this first occasion we were alone, m a large
room empty of furniture beyond the chairs we sat
on— I think there was a sofa m one corner of the
room—with a distance of five or six feet between
us, and the aluminium trumpet— used to assist those
operating on the other side m concentrating the
vibrations, as a megaphone is used here— at my feet
between myself and Mrs Wriedt
The room was darkened, an essential with this
medium in obtaining the best results; for the same
reason that a wireless message will travel consider­
ably farther at mght than m the daytime The action
of light has a destructive effect on ectoplasm and all
phenomena dependent upon the use of it, and as the
movements of the trumpet and no doubt the
“larynx” formed by the unseen operators and
instrumental m the transmission ofthe voices involve
the use of this tenuous substance thrown out by the
physical body, darkness is of the greatest assistance
m this form of demonstration
At the same time the phenomenon has been pro­
duced m my own room when conditions made it
impossible to exclude the light completely, and I
have seen the levitation and>movement of the trum­
pet take place without human contact of any kind
Mrs Murphy Lydy, a direct voice medium also
well-known m America, produced the voice success­
fully m full daylight
87
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
It was rather a weird experience, sitting in the
pitch dark with a total stranger waiting for— I hardly
knew what1
But once the communications began the common­
placeness of the situation and the voices robbed the
phenomenon of any feeling ofghosthness or uncanni­
ness. I did not recognize the voices, but the explana­
tion ofthat is simple enough The difference in tone
of physical voices is due to the formation of the
organs through which they are produced, and as
these organs disintegrate with the physical body, the
physical voice as we knew it can never be counted on
in the different conditions Some people, I believe,
do recogmze some of the voices that come through,
but I say frankly I have never done so Mannerisms,
tricks in expression and so on continue and can be
identified, I once recognized an uncle by his laugh
before he gave me his name
Very shortly after the light was turned out I was
touched on the knee, Mrs Wriedt still talking from
the same spot five or six feet away, and immediately
afterwards I heard a voice speaking through the
trumpet 11 was a physical voice and would have been
audible to any number of persons had they been in
the room. There was no question of imagination or
telepathy; it was an objective voice, and as Mrs
Wnedt continued to ta’Jc, I was obliged to ask her
to desist as someone was trying to speak.
Mrs Wnedt descnbed a figure she saw come into
the room, a good descnption of my husband “in
dark blue uniform with gold lace and shiny things
88
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
on the shoulders ” (Epaulettes ) She said he was
dancing—we had both been very fond of dancing—
and before he spoke a bar from our favourite waltz
“Daheim” was whistled through the trumpet'
A voice then that claimed to be that ofmy husband
spoke He called me by my Christian name and
seemed to be greatly agitated, but as it was not like
my husband’s voice, and moreover spoke with a
pronounced American accent, it was not surprising
that I doubted the identity of the speaker1 Elucida­
tion has to come gradually But although m the first
flush of a novel experience, and ignorance ofthe laws
governing the situation, I doubted the claims of the
speaker, I knew myselfto be face to face with a marvel
greater than the birth of steam engmes, aeroplanes
or anything yet discovered by the ingenuity and
perseverance of mankind
I was “up against” the most marvellous incident
in my life1
The voice spoke for some time asking and answer­
ing questions; the answers seemed to me a little
illusive, unsatisfying I wanted proof—indubitable—
complete. We all do— incontrovertible proof, that
will save us the trouble of further doubt and inquiry
— proof, that we shall never get without patience and
persistent seeking
I wanted to set my own tests, a line of action and a
frame of mind that always seems to inhibit the best
results Patience and a certain attitude of tolerance
when things do not go exactly as we expect, hardly
ever fail to bring proof m the end. That, at least, is
89 7
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
my experience, but the evidence must be furnished
by the operators on the other side in their own way
To attempt to impose our way on them while we are
so ignorant of their limitations generally ends m
disaster
After this, another voice claimed recognition,
giving a Christian and surname which at first were
unintelligible Finally the speaker explained who he
was by reference to my husband by a name that only
a few members of his family had used, and I recog­
nized him as a brother-m-law who had passed over as
theresultofanaccidentatpolo fifteenyearspreviously
I was much surprised I considered him one of the
most unlikely people tospeak to me, but I asked what
he was doing and if he was happy.
“ Qjute happy,” he replied. “ I am studying the
subject of evolution and am much interested m all
such subjects now ”
“I have always been interested m natural science,”
I replied
“Yes, I know, but I never expected to find you
here ”
“Why not?” I asked “ Communication with
another world has always seemed to me one of the
solvable problems of the future ”
“Well, you axe the only member ofthe family who
has tried to speak to us.”
That was true, but might have been a guess He
then went on to remind me of a dance we had been
to when we were both young and of some floweis
I had worn Which was correct
90
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
He added, my husband had asked him to come
through and assure me it was he who had spoken
first
I had other visitors, including one who, although
a stranger to me on this plane, has since become a
valued link with the other
She said she was Florence Nightingale and showed
me her lamp as an “identification mark”— the Lady
of the Lamp It was a luminous disk about the size
of a bicycle lamp and as sharply defined She waved
it several tunes close to my face and I put out my
hand and passed it right through the light A case of
fools stepping in where angels fear to tread1 I
certainly would not do such a thing now!
I left Mrs Wriedt’s not satisfied There is no need
to deal with the usual objections urged by the novice,
and which any ordinarily intelligent investigator is
of course keeping m mind, such as—
Ventriloquism'*
On one or two occasions Mrs Wnedt was speaking
at the same time as the voice through the trumpet.
I had to ask her to stop Also, I am told ventrilo­
quism is not possible m the dark
Telepathy?
At this fiist sitting this might have accounted for
the matter of the communications, but not for the
manner ofconveying them No one ofany intelligence
who has ever heard the direct voice m favourable
circumstances will try to account for it through
telepathy It has no bearing on the problem
The subconscious mind?
91
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Even tins overworked beast of burden may plead
not guilty The subconscious mind cannot—it is to
be presumed— create an objective voice and, with
telepathy, may be dismissed as of no assistance
The identity of the sitters remained the knotty
point Mrs Wriedt might have been suspected of
looking up family names, if by any chance she had
managed to learn my own, and refer to members of
my family correctly There had been nothing
absolutely convincing m anything that had taken
place
In fact there had been a big error m a statement
made
The voice alleged to be that of my husband had
said, among other things “Thank you for the
f l o w e r s I , wishing to make my own tests, replied
“Do you mean flowers I put on your g r a v e a n d
I thought the answer had been “ Yes”— which was
quite wrong1
92
CHAPTER EIGHT
Y
ET, there were points that required a good deal
ofexplaining away
I went over the evidence carefully bit by bit,
weighing the pros and cons with as little prgudice
as possible, convinced only upon one point Who­
ever their owners might be, the circumstances of
mysurroundings and myown commonsenseindicated
that the voices came from that country from which
Shakespeare m direct contradiction of the Bible, has
told us there is no return
There seemed to be no other explanation—if my
ordinary senses were of any use to me at a ll1 And m
the main they had spoken of affairs that could not
possibly have been known to the medium.
My first argument took a more or less negative
form. If any person could communicate from the
other side, my husband should be equally able to do
so; and if he could, he would—a point those who have
lost anyone for whom they greatly care would do well
to consider
But— and it was a big but in those first days of
uncertainty—the voice was not hts voice, and he had
made little mistakes m diction and phrases it was
difficult to account for I had not learnt then, as I
have already explained, that the timbre, the actual
93
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
rmg of the old voice had presumably gone for
ever
But my brother-m-law, who had given his name
and referred to trivial incidents that could not have
been known to the medium, nor found m any
reference book—how was he to be explained'*— and
how about the bar of “Daheim” that had been
whistled as an introduction'*
Thought-reading? But that was merely suggesting
a fresh miracle to account for the first, and anyway
it did not explain the voices—nor the whistling
With so much uncertainty m my mind it might
have been a long time before I visited Mrs Wriedt
again I should have done so eventually, because I
was puzzled— and when you have an inquiring mind
you are not content to remain so, but the following
day Colonel Johnson, whom I have already men­
tioned, spoke to me after a Theosophical lecture
we had both attended, he said he had a message to
give me
He had visited Mrs Wriedt that morning, had
taken notes of the message on the spot, being an
expert at doing so m the dark, and written them out
afterwards
“ I don’t know what it means,” he explained, “but
was told you would understand, and I give it to you
verbatim ”
A voice, it seemed, had spoken to him from the
trumpet m a state of great agitation, giving my
husband’s Christian and surnames, saying his wife
had been there the previous day and had gone away
94
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
doubting his identity, that she had misunderstood
him, and he was most anxious Colonel Johnson
should put it right He said her father, Sir Cooper
Key, was there, very happy and they had spent
many hours together
He then said most earnestly “ She misunderstood
me— she thought I said she put flowers on my grave
But it was her mistake. I have no grave My body
was cremated ”
He then added “ It is very difficult to do this—
as difficult as she found her painting when she first
began Ask her,” he went on, “if she remembers
the Galaton— on the Australian Station This will be
understood
“I am sorry I mismanaged it. (The séance ) We
often do the first time ”
It is quite impossible to describe the overwhelming
flood of conviction this message brought ! It was as a
crowmng point of evidence after a lifetime of inquiry
and honest speculation I had been knocking all my
life, and the door had at last opened
No one butmyhusband wouldhavesent me that message
Those who have read the previous pages may under­
stand the full force of it The name of course should
have been Galatea, showing how little Colonel
Johnson understood the point of it
None of it was known to the medium, nor to
Colonel Johnson. Even if she had had the means of
finding out so many details in my husband’s life,
she would only have had two days m which to do it
He had left the Navy thirty-four years previously,
95
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and to have suspected her of consulting ancient
Navy lists, which are not at all easy to get at, would
have been childish Nor, if she had had the oppor­
tunity of doing so, would she have had any reason
for selecting the Galatea among all the ships he had
served m as of special interest. In its very triviality
lay the weight of the evidence
At the séance my husband had been followed, so
Colonel Johnson said, by his own wife who had died
some years before I made his acquaintance, and we
had been unknown to one another during her earth
life She, too, sent me a message, to the effect that
“ Mrs. de Crespigny’s father was present with her,
and wished to say something about Malta, where
she had been when she was a little girl ”
These messages, may it be noted, were brought to
me by a third person, who knew nothing of my past
life nor of the names given to him and passed on to
me. They were not drawn from his subconscious
mind as the information had never been known to
him, and it was all sufficiently arresting to send me
again to Mrs Wnedt—this time to have all doubt
removed, and to be convinced of a truth that is
indeed the Pearl of great price
At the next sitting with Mrs Wnedt my husband
was preceded by his brother, who said the message
about the Galatea had been sent to me as a proof of
his identity, as he knew all it would convey to me,
and he had been so distressed at having been pre­
viously misunderstood My husband followed, called
me by the old names and again mentioned the
96
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Galatea, and did I remember how often he had told
me of the good times they had?
Trivial? O f course, most of life is made up of
trivialities. If he had told me the names of our
children, the date of my marriage, or of his own
death, the medium might have looked it up m a
book, if he had given me a dissertation on philo­
sophy, it would have been so unlike him I should not
have believed m him at all, if he had described his
life m that other world, I had first to be sure there
was another world to describe It was the reference
to the httle insignificant things m life—things known
perhaps to him and me alone, that drove the truth
home as could nothing else in the world How would
you prove your identity to someone who doubted it
on the telephone?
I remember a case m point At the time the search
for the poor httle Lindbergh baby was going on, the
Captain of the liner which had a short time before
conveyed Colonel Lindbergh from England wished
to speak to him on the telephone. Colonel Lind­
bergh, distracted, poor man, as he was, insisted upon
the establishment of the communicator’s identity
before he would answer the call, and it was only
after a trivial incident that had happened on board,
known to them both, had been mentioned that he
consented to go to the telephone
My husband and I at that sitting had some really
intimate talk, and when he said he must go my eyes
filled with tears
Although it was pitch-dark and my voice was
97
THIS WORLD—-AND BEYOND
under perfect control, he exclaimed at once • “Don’t
cry *
”
My father came at that sitting, to my great dehght
The bond between us on earth had been very real
He asked after his sisters, using the pet name of one
of my aunts who at that time was m physical life;
she has come to me many a time since she passed on
He again reminded me of Malta— and mentioned
our old Scottish nurse, calling her by her not very
common name, Euphemia, and also the pet name
by which we had all called her as children
Then an uncle whom I have already mentioned,
having recognized him by his laugh. He had been a
Bishop m South Africa on this plane, and when I
asked him if he was surprised at his surroundings
when he found himselfm the next world, he replied •
"Indeed I was *
”
Then came further confirmation Two days later I
received a letter from Admiral Usborne Moore.
He was a stranger to me and addressed me
as “ Madam ” He was known as the writer of
several books on spiritualism and was a keen in­
vestigator
He wrote that at a séance with Mrs Wriedt a voice
had come through claiming to be that of Philip de
Crespigny
“But I never knew you,” the Admiral protested
“Which of the de Crespignys are you9 I never
knew any of them, but one was m the Navy and
married a daughter of Sit Cooper Key.”
“That is my wife,” was the answer “I am Philip.
98
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
I was m the Navy, and I have two brothers still
alive,” and he gave the names correctly
“But I did not know you,” Admiral Moore went
on “ Why have you come to me?”
“Because you knew Sir Cooper Key He is here ”
“ When did you pass out
“About a year and a half ago ”
The Admiral fancied vaguely he had heard of my
husband’s deathfive years previously, and wrote to a
mutual friend to inquire The friend also thought it
had been about five years, but the year and a half
given by the commumcator from the “other side”
was correct— putting any suggestion of telepathy or
the subconscious mind out of court again.
I had at this time a near relative who wished to
verify for herself the experiences of which I spoke.
I was anxious she should have something of a con­
vincing nature, so previously to her piojected visit
I asked my husband to recall some incident that
would satisfy her with regard to his identity.
I asked him to give the pet name by which he had
called her After some hesitation he said he could
not quite get it, but it was a short name with three
letters in it This was correct, and he made a further
attempt which was almost successful, and interesting
as being evidently a genuine effort of memory
He told me that as they leave the physical brain to
disintegrate with the body, it is uncertain how much
they can take over with them of facts stored in the
memory There is also to be considered the readjust­
ment of the vehicle of consciousness necessary before
99
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
they can tune m to physical conditions; for us on this
plane to attempt to arbitrate upon how much or
what they ought to remember when ^returning to
communicate, is probably a display of ignorance on
our part
' My relation obtained the evidence that certainly
convinced her at the time, and she said afterwards
had robbed her of the fear of death for good and all
My husband gave his name and asked if she re­
membered a ring he had given her many years ago
She was nervous and hesitated; then with an effort
of memory asked
“ Do you mean the silver ring you gave me in
Bermuda when I was twelve years old?”
“ Yes,” he rephed, “with the crown on it ”
She gasped with astonishment The ring referred
to was of silver beaten out of a shilling by the ship’s
armourer m the days when my father had been C m
C on the North American Station, leaving the
pattern of laurel leaves round it and the crown in
the centre
“And you lost it,” he went on, “ but knew when
you lost it.”
It seemed she had allowed it to be put into a
Christmas pudding and had never seen it again
Trivial—but it went home1
I have heard many languages spoken in Mrs
Wnedt’s stance-room; one of special interest, both
sides of the conversation being carried on m Hindu­
stani.
A man known to me, and his wife, had lately
100
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
returned from India, where he had held an official
position, and the latter came with me to a sitting
with Mrs Wnedt at which about ten persons were
present
A native landowner known to her and her husband
m India spoke m— to me— a strange language She
was touched by the trumpet, showing the com­
munication was for her, someone suggested she
should answer the speaker m Hindustani This let
loose the flow of his eloquence, a torrent of words
m a strange tongue was the result, some of which
was evidently intelligible to her The only syllables
I could disentangle from the riot of speech were
“Bala Khan,” which I heard distinctly, and was
repeated when he finished up at the top of the scale
m a sort of screech which I was told was very
characteristic
Then Colonel Johnson, who was present, and had
himselfspent a great part of his life m India, said *
“ Turn Hindustani boita?”— I think I have got it
right; the other voice shot out “Beshakk1”— the
question being “Do you speak Hindustani?” and
the answer “ O f course '”
“Dr Sharp,” who controls Mrs Wriedt’s séances
from the other side, then came to explain that the
old man, Bala Khan, was trying to say how much he
loved the family, and added.
“You have a daughter ”
She said yes, and the voice then, so strong and
powerful, it could have been heard easily throughout
the house, went on :
101
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
“ The old man was saymg that he was living in
the glory of God ”
“Has he forgiven the man who sent him across?”
“ That man was innocent,” was the reply
“Then who was guilty?”
“He will tell you that himself,” and later on at
another sitting he came again and described the
conditions of his own murder, exonerating the
relative who had been suspected of it
On one occasion after a sitting, when the light was
turned up, the trumpet that a moment before had
been on the floor m the centre of the circle, was
hanging by its thin end to the ceding of the very
high room; it hung there sufficiently long for every­
one to see it Then, as the ether was thrown into
movement by the sudden influx of light, it fell and
hit one of the party a really sharp blow on the
shoulder—sharp enough to convince him it could
not be put down to his subconscious mind1
One evening I was sitting alone with a reading-
lamp at my left shoulder, when quite .suddenly a
shadow passed between me and the printed page
It was so unlike an ordinary flicker of the electric
current that it caught my attention There seemed
to be something more deliberate about it as though
a bat or bird had passed between me and the light.
But discovering nothing to account for it, I resumed
reading and thought no moie about it
The following day I was lunching with friends and
unexpectedly to me Admiral Usborne Moore—
whom I had met and made friends with after his
102
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
first letter to me— was one of the guests On meeting
me he exclaimed:
“I did not know I was to meet you, but apparently
the Lady of the Lamp, who I suppose was Miss
Nightingale, did, for I was at Mrs Wnedt’s this
morning and she asked me to give you a message
It conveys nothing to me but you may be able to
understand it
“I was to tell you it was she who threw the shadow
across your book last night ”
There we have another instance of a communica­
tion that cannot be explained by the subconscious
mind
At another time the Admiral, before witnesses who
can confirm the circumstances, greeted me with :
“Have you a son in the Dardanelles?”
I hesitated
“ I thought you told me your son was fighting in
Egypt,” he went on, “ but at a séance this morning
your husband came through and asked me to tell
you not to be anxious about your son in the Dar­
danelles, as he and others were looking after him ”
My son had been fighting m Egypt, but two days
previously I had received the news of his appoint­
ment as A D C to General Sir William Birdwood in
the Dardanelles, with whom he served afterwards m
France until he finally rejoined his regiment m
India
There seems to be a tendency on the part of new­
comers into investigation of this subject to ignore
good evidence and batten on the bad1
103
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Many a time have I been to séances and m sub­
sequent discussion the novice— and sometimes some
of those one might have expected to have learnt
better through experience—will pass over the really
sound evidence put before them and emphasize the
weak spots, where, often owing to our own ignorance
or misapprehension, some small but mexphcable
error may have been made A sitter will complain—
quite reasonably—when his father’s name has been
given as William when it should have been John,
but pass over without comment a string of familiar
names his neighbour may have received that put the
genuineness of the message beyond question
If why is asked in the first place, why not with
equal insistence m the second'1 Not only should the
lesser m weight and quantity not be allowed to
swallow the greater merely because it is adverse, but
the smallest bit of evidence for—so long as it be
evidence— should carry just as much weight when
explaimng-away begins as the other Qjiahty is of
even more importance in this direction than quan­
tity.
104
CHAPTER NINE
IHAVE heard four voices speaking simultaneously
m Mrs Wriedt’s stance-room; one at my ear,
purporting to be my husband m a voice audible to
everyone present, speaking apparently from the air
about my own private affairs, while one at the further
side of the circle was speaking in Dutch At various
times thirteen or fourteen different languages have
been spoken; Mrs Wriedt is familiar with no
language except her own These languages have
included Brtton-French— a very distinctive patois—
Hindustani, Croatian, Serbian, Maltese, modern
Greek, besides the more ordinary French, German,
Swedish and others There was no fumbling among
the sitters for a response; in every case the com­
municator directly addressed the one person in the
circle without any hesitation who understood the
language spoken This m itself is evidential. On
occasions when it was an unusual tongue such as
Serbian or Croatian there would be present only
one person who understood it, and there might be
great difficulty m getting through more than a word
or so; but sufficient for recognition by the sitter for
whom it was intended. “ Dr Sharp,” the control,
would then speak and throw light on the situation
With no direct voice medium have I ever heard so
105 8
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
many strange and unusual languages articulated in
the seance-room
Sceptics are apt to accuse psychical investigators
ofcredulity and easy acceptance ofso-called physical
phenomena It becomes wearying after a time to be
assured by some quite new inquirer that he— or she—
is “very hard to convince ” The implication is not
flattering' “ It’s all very well for you” the speaker
geems to imply, “ but I require some really sound
evidence before I can accept the phenomenon as
g e n u i n e M a y I say we have all been hard to
convince; all of us who are serious thinkers have
required “ sound” evidence before accepting the
results But the fact of the phenomena once estab­
lished it is not to be supposed that every case of a
similar phenomenon is to be met with incredulity
and rejected until it has been sifted to the dregs
Life is too short for such procedure We know the
thing to be possible.
Let us suppose that in the early days of the
electric telegraph a message might be received from
a distance m what seemed to the recipient an
incredibly short space of time He might refuse to
accept the statement without verification, pay a visit
to die Post Office, interrogate the postmaster,
inspect the instrument, cross-examine the operator
and become at last convinced of the genuineness of
the message He may even repeat this process half a
dozen times before being finally satisfied
But is he, every time he receives a telegram, to
go through the whole performance for the rest of his
106
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
life?—And if he omits to do so is he necessarily to
be considered credulous if on some occasion a faked
telegram should take him in'1
In recordmg instances within my own experience,
of communication with those who have “ gone
before” I am selecting so far as possible those that
seem free from any possibility of suspicion of owing
their origin to the subconscious mind or thought-
reading on the part of the medium Phenomena
that do come under this suspicion lose their in­
terest from the psychical pomt of view and become
purely psychological They cast no light— nor
doubt—upon the vast number of instances that
appear to be quite independent of any such agency
Mr Hereward Carrington, mhis “Story of Psychic
Science,” observes with regard to the tendency to fall
back on the subconscious mind m the search for
explanations
“The structure of mechanistic science is based
upon a certain set of observed phenomena— entirely
ignoring another whole set of phenomena (psychic)
which cannot be dovetailed into their system----- ”
and may I suggest with all respect that when it
comes to some of the explanations of psychic pheno­
mena seriouslyoffered by the mechanist, the credulity
does not he on the side of the psychic researcher1
When my father’s time as C m C on the North
American Station came to an end, he was recalled
with some urgency to England with Captain Fisher,
as he was then, to take command of an emer­
gency fleet specially mobilized, owing to what was
107
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
at the time called the Russian “scare” — though
of what the particular scare was about I have no
recollection Whatever it was, it came to nothing;
fortunately the situation was cleared up and the
fleet waiting for orders at Weymouth was eventually
demobilized as rapidly as ithad beencalled intobeing
In Mrs Wnedt’s stance-room on one occasion I
was talking to my father, who had passed over more
than five-and-twenty years previously, and for some
reason I referred to this incident—mainly, I think, as
a small test of memory, but on this occasion I was
hoist by my own petard1
“ Do you remember,” I asked, “taking command of
the emergency fleet assembled at Weymouth at the
time of the Russian ‘scare’ m 1879'*”
“ O f course I do,” he answered instantly, “ but it
was in ’78 not ’79 ”
My memory was at fault, not his1 He was per­
fectly correct, as I found out afterwards In 1914,
when the sitting took place, very few even among
naval men would have remembered the Russian
“ scare,” which came to nothing, of all those years
ago—much less Mrs Wnedt; but the voice, as
objective as yours or mine, corrected me without a
moment’s hesitation
When m Malta as a child, among the friends of
my parents I can remember a Captain and Mrs,
Morant, the latter was specially impressed on my
mind owing to the fact that she gave me my first
paint-box—a tm box with real water-colours1 very
different from the pale substitute generally con-
108
+ j
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
sidered good enough for the early dabbler1 I had
entirely lostsight ofthem and had never seen or heard
ofthem smce those days ofchildhood
At the sitting at which my father first spoke, he
was followed by a voice giving the name “ Sophie ”
“ I am sorry,” I replied, “ I never knew anyone
called Sophie ”
“Yes, you did—you knew me,” was the answer
“ Can you give me your other name— your sur­
name?” and when the name Morant was given
I remembered and placed the speaker.
“Your father brought me to speak to you Do you
remember me?”
“O f course I d o '” I exclaimed “You gave me my
first paint-box when we were m Malta. But I didn’t
know your name was Sophie ”
“You probably never heard it We were friends
of your father and mother, and we still are friends
over here ”
“ Have you been over there long'*”
“About two years My husbandis still m earth life.”
On consulting a book of reference after the sitting,
I found the Christian name of the speaker had been
Sophia, that she had passed over about two years
previously and that her husband was still alive.
On another occasion the sitter next to me, whom I
knew, was the mother of a young lieutenant m the
Navy, who had been killed a short time previously
in the War Some engravings ofsome value had been
missing since his death, and as he had been very in­
terested in them his mother was anxious to trace them.
109
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
When a voice “came through” giving his name, she
explained how they had searched for them every­
where m vain, both m their country and London
homes, but the engravings seemed to have entirely
disappeared
He remembered them perfectly, said he had sent
them to be framed, and told her to write to a well-
known firm in Portsmouth, giving the name quite
clearly, and from whom he felt sure she would get
the necessary information
His mother wrote to me later as she thought I
should be interested in the subsequent development.
She had written to the firm m question asking if
they could tell her anything ofthe missing engravings
The reply was that they remembered them per­
fectly, but they were no longer m their possession,
they had been framed, packed m a case and des­
patched to their country house m Oxfordshire
On receipt of this information another search had
been carried out m the house, and finally the missing
engravings were discovered inside an unopened
packing-case lying among some lumber m an attic
As often happened during the economical days ofthe
War, an old packing-case had been used, which had
put the searchers off the scent m the first instance,
and they had not taken the trouble to open it* It is
difficult m such a case to see where the subconscious
mind could have come in, without stretching the
point beyond the bounds of probability.
During the years Mrs Wriedt was in England the
number of my sittings with her must have run cer-
110
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
tainly into three figures, and I think I may say I
could count the blanks upon the fingers ofone hand.
Her kind-heartedness toward those who mourned
was never-faihng; she would use her gift for them
freely and with a generosity that often left her tired
and spent On the rare occasions when there were
no results she refused to take a fee, saying that “ if
you pay for a pair of boots you have the right to
expect to get the b o o t s a n d that if she gave nothing
she would take nothing
Shortly after one ofMrs Wriedt’svisits to England,
a newspaper was sent to me anonymously from
America It contained an article headed “ Exposure
of Mrs Wriedt ”
The mam indictment was that after one of her
sittings the writer had detected drops of water
adhering to the inner sides of the trumpet, which
obviously suggested the condensation of human
breath, with the implication that Mrs Wriedt had
been herselfspeaking through it.
As it was her invariable custom to hold the trumpet
under the cold water tap between each sitting— an
office I had often performed for her— the “ exposure”
made no more impression upon me than many other
“exposures” ofthe same description, which I hope to
consider in a later chapter.
The evidence for survival of personality bearing
the hallmark of characteristics, memory, tempera­
ment and so on was given me m such abundance
through the channel of Etta Wriedt’s mcdiumship
that it is impossible to record more than a mere
111
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
fraction, and the repetition of instance after instance
is apt to become wearisome It is also a fact that
nothing will ever bring conviction with the force of
first-hand experience It is possible to accept what
you hear, to acknowledge the probability, the logic,
the truth itself on the evidence of others, and to be to
that extent convinced But to believe intellectually
is not to realize, and realization m its full sense comes
only with personal experience, an iota of which is
of more value than all the arguments m the world
And it is through the little everyday references to
life, the trivial happenings, that conviction comes.
My husband’sgrandfather, on his mother’sside, Sir
John Tyrell, came to speak to me at a séance, I had
never known him m earth life and it greatly surprised
me that he should wish to communicate He had
been very autocratic m earth life, afew years ago his
family place was bought by Mr Henry Ford, to be
near his works at Dagenham, and had the sale taken
place before my interview, I have no doubt he would
have had something to say on the subject1
He spoke on several matters not only connected
with the family, but gave some information about his
own development since passmg over He also made
one or two allusions to matters I was not clear about
At my next sitting, his daughter, my husband’s
mother, came through to explain, and solved some
confusion I felt as to her identity by describing her­
self as the “ Dowager,” she referred in detail to
family dissensions and their consequences, about
which the medium could have known nothing, and
112
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
of which I knew very little, as it had all happened
before I married mto the family
No subconscious mind could be reasonably held
accountable for such results, nor for the strong
objective voices audible to everyone present
At one time I had very excellent results with Mrs.
Roberts Johnson Through her mediumship many
of my friends became convinced of survival O f late
years the voice of her control has appeared to be
located so near the throat ofthe medium herselfthat
it became extremely difficult to persuade new­
comers of the genuineness of the phenomenon But
I have heard the voice travelling to and fro on
presumably an ectoplasmic cord or rod from the
trumpet to Mrs Johnson’s throat m the manner of a
flame running up and down a thread of smoke, and
have also heard her singing while voices were
issuing from the trumpet
I have had, and have heard others receive, con­
vincing proof of survival through Mr Maskel, who
is totally blind; and have sat with Mr Sloan, through
whom Mr Arthur Findlay obtained his evidence,
and who on one occasion covered my hand with
ectoplasm—and very unpleasant it was! Cobwebs,
cold, made of silk, slimy, is the only way m which I
can describe it, which clung to my fingers and
refused to be removed until they dissolved naturally
and melted away
The Misses Moore’smediumship has been dealt with
mextensoby the Rev V Duncan in his book*‘Proof;’*
a clear and most convincing record to put into the
113
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
hands ofthe newinquirer Through the Misses Moore,
Lord Fisher came to me As Fisher had been the
maiden name of one of the sitters, a friend of mine,
she very naturally claimed the speaker as her father
But the voice repudiated the relationship, refusing
to be turned aside, and finally I realized it was
“Jack Fisher” who was addressing me He called me
by my name and reminded me that the last time we
had methe had kissed me m the middle of Piccadilly1
Quite true, and not unnatural as he had known me
from the age of four, but very unlikely to have been
known to the mediums1
I have sat with frauds in the stance-room, an
unpleasant experience from every point ofview
There was a man off Baker Street who professed to
produce the direct voice, whom I visited anonymously
on a voyage of exploration He was very anxious I
should write my name m his visitors’ book before
the sitting, which I firmly refused to do He was
equally anxious to have my money There were
five sitters, and the first point that aroused my sus­
picion was the thick black cloth with which the
trumpet was swathed outside It naturally added
considerably to the weight, an important and un­
desirable factor m its manipulation by the unseen
operators, and the only possible object would be to
prevent any glint of reflected light that might help
the sitters to locate it, should there be a leakage of
light m the room or reflection from a luminous
wnst-watch.
Secondly, the trumpet appeared to be worked as
114
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
though from the hub of a wheel, and a narrow line
ofluminous paint on the inside of the rim showed up
the face of the sitter when turned m the right direc­
tion ; no doubt to enable the medium to locate each
individual and run no risk of an accidental blow ni
the face or eye' The messages were all m the
medium’s voice—though that is no evidence either
way—and were of the “if you are good you will be
happy” type that convemently fits everybody
A few weeks later he was definitely found out and
“warned off” for good and all
Probably the movement will never be free from
attempts at fraud—what movement is? But fortu­
nately it is much more difficult to “get away with it”
than it was at one time Science has furmshcd us
with further devices for the detection of imposture,
and the public is more versed in what to look
for But in spite of any advance we should bear
in mind our still abysmal ignorance of the laws
governing the forces with which we are dealing, and
the whole subject suffers from the tendency offools to
step m where angels fear to tread
Those who seek will always find— eventually, but
the seeking must not be of the superficial sort that
considers a single visit sufficient basis upon which to
build theories, or pioclaim incredulity Many
professed searchers after fact seem more anxious to
prove they are right and the rest of the world wrong
than really to find the truth— which may be human,
but does not add much to the world’s store of
knowledge.

CHAPTER TEN
D
URING the years of the War, owing perhaps to
the state oftension and nervous strain prevalent
on all sides, there was evidence of a more general
response to psychic influences than m normal times;
which does not for a moment indicate that the in­
fluences were not genuine; merely, that the
instruments were more ready to respond to them
I will repeat my earlier parallel • A fiddle-string
stretched to its greatest capacity will produce a
higher and more piercing note than when slack It
may be that the human organism when keyed up to
something beyond normal, may be capable of
responding to more subtle wave-lengths on the mental
plane than in ordinary conditions
There is an apt illustration ofthis.
Suppose that the consciousness of the child newly-
born into this world may bnng with it a dim recol­
lection of worlds from which it has come, the notes
of the celestial flutes still echoing m its ears. As it
advances through the years it becomes gradually and
inevitably tuned in to the more insistent vibrations
of matter and the things of earth; the beating of the
big drum of material environment may drown the
delicate notes of the flute and the child in maturer
years lose touch with them. But if for any reason
116
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
the beating of the drum be muffled or stilled, the
soft notes of the flute are heard, again—never having
really ceased, going on all the time, although the
beating ofthe drum may have temporarily smothered
them
I was sitting on one occasion with a friend, Miss
Tweedy, who has since married but was quite a
young girl at the time. We sat at a small table
round which were ranged the letters of the alphabet,
and messages were spelt out sometimes slowly and
laboriously, sometimes very rapidly by means of a
glass “pointer” upon which we each placed a finger.
A name was given, spelt out slowly, of which
neither of us knew anything
“Are you for me?” I asked.
“Yes— I want you to send a message to my wife,”
was the answer
“But I don’t know your wife. Have you ever met
either of us?” meaning my companion or myself.
The answer was in the negative.
“ Then how am I to give the message? Can you
tell me her address'*”
He then gave his name m full with the prefix of
Captain, said he had been killed in France about
three weeks previously and was most anxious to
let his wife know “ they were all happy with
Bessie.”
He then gave an address m the North of London
of which I had never heard, and said I should find
his wife there.
So, without much hope of any result, I wrote a
1 1 7
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
postcard worded m such a manner that should it be
returned through the dead letter office I should run
no risk of arousing suspicion with regard to my
sanity, and awaited events
After an interval of about a week I received a card
in answer. With the exception of the number, the
address was correct/ I had traced his wife solely
through the information given by the unseen com­
municator.
His sister-in-law answered my card, saying his
wife was out of London but she would forward my
communication to her I followed it up with the
sister-in-law and learnt that she also had lost her
husband a few weeks previously—the two brothers
having been killed within a day or two ofeach other
The sisters-m-law were living together while their
husbands were m France, but she did not know who
“Bessie” was
No more did 1 1 So it looked as though it must be
left at that I had found the address and given the
message
However, we arranged to meet She was interested
and wanted to hear further details After a short
conversation she admitted incidentally that Bessie
had been her husband’s mother’s name1
On asking why she had not accepted the name in
the first instance she objected that he would not have
referred to his mother by her Christian name
But why not? How do we know how they may
refer to one another, nor how far earth relationships
and customs may stand m other conditions? There
118
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
would have been a purpose in the mention of the
name which was recognizable, whereas the general
term “ mother” would have conveyed nothing in the
shape of evidence
Having been entrusted with a message given m
circumstances which appeared to give it the stamp
of truth, from one who was unable to give it himself,
I wrote to the wife giving her merely an accurate
account of the occurrence, but I received no reply!
Each one to his taste, but I think I would take a
risk— even to my own soul’s safety'— on the off-
chance of the message being genuine rather than
turn a deaf ear to such an appeal from a “ dead”
husband
Another experience with no “ professional”
medium present was striking in that there would
seem to be no flaw m the chain of evidence.
I was dining with two friends— Miss Julia Smith,
whose psychic gifts and writings under the
pseudonym of “ Pax” are well-known; and the late
Mrs. Kelway Bamber, author of “ Claude’s Book”
and sequels received “inspirationally” from her son
in the other life
After dinner it was suggested we should lower the
lights and see if anything interesting transpired
This is what came— imparted to me by them
jointly, the one apparently seeing clairvoyantly, the
other hearing through clairaudience
There was a man, they told me, standing behind
my chair, who looked like Mephistopheles This
was not such a shock as might be supposed— and
119
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
our enemies would say no less than was to be ex­
pected i I had never met Mephistopheles, but I felt
convinced he would do nothing so crude as to come
dressed for the part, so I merely asked for further
enlightenment
They went on to say he was a foreigner, and as I
did not consider any country entitled to regard the
Prince of Darkness as a foreigner, I still awaited
further developments
The next words brought me sharply to attention.
He was a foreigner, they repeated, connected with
music He came from Milan. They got grand opera
with him
Above my head there was an M outlined m gold.
Memory returned with a rush, and when it was
added that he wished to thank me for a service I
had done him in the Law Courts, I knew precisely
who “Mephistopheles” was *
Years previously, before I had become acquainted
either with Mrs. Kelway Bamber or Miss Julia
Smith, when my husband and I were living m the
New Forest, an Italian opera-singer called Mhanes,
with an invalid friend, had taken rooms in our
village. Before I married, while I was in the school­
room, I had devoted my chief aims m life and
interest to music, and as opportunities for indulging
any particular taste are not always forthcoming in
the country, I naturally jumped at the chance when
it offered.
So Signor Mhanes often dined with us, and in the
evenings we played and sang, mostly from Faust, an
120
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
opera ofwhich my husband was very fond, sometimes
until one or two o’clock m the morning For him to
have reappeared m the garb of Mephistopheles was
quite intelligible, and certainly neither of my
friends could have had any idea of the explanation
In those far-back days Signor Mhanes had known
the composer, Claude Trevor, who came occasionally
to stay with him and his friend m the village and
with whom I also became acquainted
When eventually Signor Mhanes’ companion died,
leaving to him whatevei property he was possessed
of, the will was disputed, and it was greatly owing to
the evidence given in the law court by my husband
and myself that his rights were vindicated and the
will made to stand This of course explained the
message clairaudiently heard
I admitted the correctness of my friends’
“reading,” but that was all I had lost sight of
Signor Mhanes ever since he had left the village over
five-and-twenty years previously, and did not even
know if he were alive or dead Nor had I heard of
Mr Claude Trevor since Mhanes had won his case in
court. I had to leave it at that
But within a week of this sitting I received the
following letter, forwarded through the office of
Light and dated 1921 *
—
17 Lung Arno Torrigjani,
Florence
“Dear Mrs de Crespigny,
“ I do not for one moment imagine you will
121 9
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
remember me, though I do you very well and the
kind hospitality you and your husband extended
to me during a visit of my dear friend Signor
Luigi Mhanes to you both m the New Forest
many, many years ago I have so often seen your
name m the pages of Light that I have often been
tempted to write to you and speak of the constant
compamon of my life for thirty-four years, and
who passed away m 1917, but I have up to now
been deterred from doing so thinking it might
bother you However if such is now the case I
can only ask you to forgive my doing so During
our long comradeship he was constantly used to
speak of you and your husband so warmly, and
your kind help when he was fighting a lawsuit
and you both appeared for him — ” followed by
a few remarks not relevant, and signed
“ Claude T revor.”
It would surely be difficult to pick a hole m that
bit of evidence of an agent beyond the normal at
work?
There were the two witnesses besides myself to
confirm the account of what took place, neither of
them having the slightest knowledge of the original
circumstances
During all those years I had heard no word of
Signor Mhanes, nor did I know of his death
Finally the letter, written by a man who could not
by any means have known of the sitting and the
“reading” given by the two ladies, and received by
122
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
me within a day or two after that event, following a
silence of more than twenty-five years
Under what urge I wonder was the letter sent so
opportunely!
The well-known medium, Mrs Eileen Garrett,
as she would herself admit, owes much of the fine
quality of her mediumship to-day to the painstaking
and intelligent training of Mrs Kelway Bamber,
who gave up a long period oftime to sitting patiently,
not only for the development of Mrs. Garrett, but
also of her control “ Uvani ”
Mrs Bamber believed the super-sensitivity of the
medium m trance could be greatly modified, and
working to this end, she impressed upon the Arab
guide the necessity for calm imperturbability m
spite of noise or interruption
I was present on some of these occasions, with
“ Uvani” m control the trance state of the medium
remained undisturbed by such incidents as the
banging of doors or the sudden intrusion of visitors.
It is possibly due to this rigorous training that Mrs.
Garrett has faced so successfully the tests of a scienti­
fic and psycho-analytical nature lately applied to
her mediumship with such invaluable results, the
trance condition having become so stabilized that
the usual super-sensitivity has not interfered with
the experiments
I have seen very remarkable results from circles
similar to my sitting with my two friends—private
circles with no “professional” medium present, the
phenomena being obtained through contributions
123
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
from all the sitters, or from one m particular These
circles, m my opinion, lead to more satisfactory
results than a strictly “home” circle where all the
sitters are familiar with each other’s private affairs
and those of the family to which they mutually
belong, besides the possibility of bang imbued with
the same mental bias, evidence in these circum­
stances, free from the suspicion of having come from
the unconscious influence of some mind present, is
difficult to obtain
The trouble m establishing such a circle is to find
the requisite number of sitters who may be counted
upon to attend without fail, which is not so easy to
do as it sounds It entails patience, perseverance,
enthusiasm and a certain amount of self-denial, and
behind those qualities a sense of the deep importance
and value of reliable results The attitude of mind
that will allow trivial circumstances to intervene and
prevent a regular attendance is not likely to be a
valuable addition to any circle The excuse “ I have
married a wife and therefore I cannot come” is no
morejustifiable to-day than it was in days ofold, and
nowadays a tea-party is often good enough as a
plea for absence I am sometimes told by persons
who think they are earnest followers of the subj'ect:
“You know I have given up everything for
spiritualism *
” and I long to ask what exactly they
have given up1 And unless you give something you
have no right to expect to get To get something for
nothing is against the laws of God and man.
If the sitters are m earnest—real earnest, honestly
124
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
m search of the truth—nothing short of some inevit­
able call of duty will be allowed to interfere with
regular attendance
For about eight years I sat in such a circle It was
composed of Captain and Mrs Henshaw Russell of
4 Leinster Gardens, Colonel E R Johnson and
myself We sat alternately at each other’s houses,
and never missed the meeting except on account of
illness or an absolutely unavoidable call elsewhere;
no one besides ourselves was ever admitted
We obtained many remarkable results, some of
which m the nature of prophecy could not be
attributed to anyone’s subconscious mind There
was much that, although interesting, we had to take
on trust and accept with a certain amount of
caution There was a proposition which we definitely
discarded But we were given information that
threw a rational complexion upon vexed questions
and that came either in the form of symbols or
allegory, but were never of a nature to save us the
trouble of thinking for ourselves We might be
given a clue, or stimulus, but the unravelling of the
problem was left to us for final solution.
We were all interested in theosophy and other
forms of Eastern philosophy, and much of the
instruction received was m theosophical terms, and
referred to the theories and arguments of that line
of thought There was not a great deal that could
not have been learnt through the literature, but it
was differently expressed, confirming or elucidating
matters to be found m the Hermetic Doctrine, the
125
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
use and development of the vital centres— the
chakras— and the constitution of the various bodies
of man; the auras and the inner meamng of some of
the ancient Egyptian ritual
I have already referred to some information given
to our circle one day by a “teacher” from the other
world He spoke of “bringing light to a dead planet.”
I asked what was meant by that
“ Certain heavenly bodies,” he answered, “have
their appointed period of activity and then become
‘dead’ ; that is to say cease to have any power of
reaction to outside stimuli ”
“ Like the moon?” I suggested “Although the
moon is not really dead matter or, I suppose, it
would not react to light and give back a reflection ”
“ The whole universe,” he went on, spelling out
the words so rapidly we could hardly follow, “ as the
Easterns have always maintained, is in an alternate
condition of maya and prelaya—a period of rest
followed by renewed activity When we wish to
reclaim the dead matter of a planet— to bring it to
life again as one might say—we direct upon it rays
of light which stimulate the physical particles into
life again.”
“ Light from our sun?” a sitter asked
“ No Rays of a different order brought from far
distant stars If I were to try to explain it to you,
you would not understand at present ”
Might not this have been a dim foreshadowing of
the Cosmic rays discovered by Professor Millikan
about ten years later? Rays, not from our sun, but
126
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
from the vast distances of interstellar space, bom­
barding our earth’s surface day and night, and
replenishing the wastage through radiation, of the
earth’s crust, m the words of one of our scientists,
“winding up the universe as fast as it runs down,”
and incidentally putting new meamng into the
opening phrase of Genesis “ Let there be light
Is it not also true that the dark and apparently
empty patches seen m space and hitherto called
“pockets” are now suspected to be due to the inter­
vention of dark celestial bodies— in the condition
described as maya?
Science is indeed a magnificent poem, and the
poet perhaps more of a scientist than he is aware
Whether man studies m God’s laboratory or His
garden, as Wordsworth has it, the message comes out
much the same m the end
127
CHAPTER ELEVEN
T
HE methods of communicating through ouija-
boards, planchette and other instruments of
the same variety might be regarded as a bridge
between physical and mental mediumship This
would include the two forms of automatic writing,
physical in that the manipulation of any sort of
matter seems to require the use of the connecting
link of a material nature, mental, m so far as the
bram of the medium is also called into requisition
as an aid m setting up conditions necessary for com­
munication , to what extent and upon what occasion
the latter is used seems to depend upon the decision
of the unseen operators, and, it may be supposed,
the capacity of the medium
In automatic writing, no less than m the use of the
ouija-board, the motive force immediately behind
the operation may be essentially of an inspirational
nature In this case anything ofan ectoplasmic origin
would be dispensed with, the directing force acting
directly upon the medium’s brain, which m its turn
conveys the necessary message to the arm and hand
m the ordinary normal manner This more delicate
expression of the forces at work seems to connect
the phenomenon with the mental side rather than
the physical, whereas in automatic writing the
123
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
reverse would be the case It has, however, the draw­
back of arousing m the medium a suspicion of the
reliability of the results, as the words to be regis­
tered are formed m the brain and therefore known to
that brain before they find expression through the
hand, the medium is not unnaturally led to imagine
they “come out of her own head” 1
In the case of purely “ automatic” writing the
unseen operator manipulates directly the hand of the
writer and, so far as we know, for this a certain
amount of ectoplasm must be drawn upon m order
to make contact This would bring the phenomenon
more strictly under the heading of physical, and m
my experience— I have no desire to dogmatize—
communications are not generally on so high a level
as those obtained through “inspirational” methods
We hear a good deal, from our opponents, of
mental unbalance m connexion with the practice of
spiritualism and psychic research We try to pin the
matters of these statements down to verifiable facts,
to find generally they are lost in a maze of confusion
and inaccuracy Our lunatic asylums are not filled
with spiritualists, there are far more religious
maniacs and sex maniacs to be found m them than
ever will be found m spiritualism, not to mention
other sources of lunacy1
But if there is a danger in “ dabbling” m psychic
matters on the part of the ignorant and the ill-
balanced, m my opinion it would be more likely to
he at the door of automatic writing than at any
other
129
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
It is the commonest form of mediumship and the
easiest come by With care and training it can be
developed into a very perfect channel; but to allow
either brain or hand to be lightly used without that
care and training is to step m where angels fear to
tread The very fact that perfect passivity is a
necessary essential to results, should speak for itself
A door is opened through which anyone can walk,
and as m the case of doors m this world, it is easy
enough to allow a person to walk m, but may be a
very different affair when it comes to persuading
him to walk out1
My own recommendation to those who find them­
selves becoming obsessed by the desire to write
automatically m season and out of season is— cut it
off altogether, at all events for a time, it would be
advisable to nip a desire for drink m the bud, or
addiction to drugs, and the uncontrolled self-
indulgence of writing automatically whenever the
urge is felt is equally weak-minded and may be as
pernicious In other forms of communications such
as trance, direct voice or materialization, the risks
are run by the medium, rarely by the sitters, and the
former have learnt—if they are wise—how to
minimize those risks, and guard the sitting from
adverse influences
In a right and proper use of spiritualism there is
nothing but good; but in other circumstances it is
playing with fire— or worse still, with unknown
forces not understood and often but only half-
believed in
130
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Private and home circles may have their advan­
tages as a method of communication, but they also
have their inherent drawbacks The Angel with the
flaming sword again interfering to prevent man from
obtaining access too easily to knowledge, for the
right use of which he requires long years of training
and preparation Just as he has had to earn his right
to every stage ofscientific advance by the overcoming
of apparently insurmountable obstacles, so is his
path toward the final solution ofthe greatest problem
of all strewn with difficulties—Aunt Sallys, many of
them, erected by his own intellect and which he is
therefore all the more reluctant to demolish1
After a long period of close and intimate contact
between members ofa “home” circle, the harmonious
relations obtained may possibly act not only
beneficently as a perfected channel between the two
planes of existence—as it undoubtedly does— but
may also incidentally develop any powers of tele­
pathic intercourse latent m the sitters, and sofrustrate
the evidential value of the communications
Harmony, so far as we can judge by the evidence
available, is an appreciable adjunct to successful
telepathic results, in a family circle the possibility
of telepathic interference would be greatly increased,
and so decrease the value of the results.
Communications obtained through a strange
medium, entirely ignorant of even the name of the
sitter, is more likely to bring conviction to the fresh
inquirer than circumstances tainted with the sus­
picion that the evidence obtained might be due to a
131
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
knowledge of family history or to memories stored m
the subconscious minds of relatives forming the
circle
The fact is that we all look for the definite, clear-
cut evidence that will settle the question for us once
and for all1 But m every step m advance m know­
ledge and discovery since it dawned upon man’s
brain how to fashion tools out of flints, we have had
to dig and to probe, to fail and try again, before the
desired end is reached A fresh rung attained on the
ladder of human endeavour may cost and often has
cost not only labour and sacrifice but life itself to
the pioneers who have dared all m the struggle.
From the dawn of the race to the iron ships, the
steam engine, the miracles of the surgeon’s knife, of
the harnessed electric current, the wonders of air and
ether, all of which are our heritage to-day, man has
been obliged to carve the way for himself, Heaven
may have indicated the track but man has had to do
the blazing Help from higher Powers may have been
available when sought, but we have had to solve our
own riddles
And to this—the greatest riddle of them all— are
we to get the answer ready-made
Are we to expect the solution of the most vital
question in the whole world, compared with which
the discoveries ofall the ages melt into nothingness—
does man survive'’—handed out to us the first time
we knock at the door?
Moreover— are we to get it for nothing’’—as many
seem to expect Are our mediums to work and tram
132
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and live lives of self-denial for no material reward
while we reap the fruits of their labours'*
There is nothing necessarily spiritual about com­
municating with friends merely because they are
divided from us by the narrow stream of death
Holy influences such as love and gratitude may
prevail m the seance-room, but they may also
prevail m the hospital, and we do not consider that
a sufficient reason for not paying our dues1 In these
communications we are using a telephone and a
super-sensitive instrument at that1 But that is by
the w ay1
In the past there have been fine examples of
inspirational writing, quite apart from the traditional
sources of many of the sacred books of all ages and
nations “ Spirit Teachings ” given through the
hand of Stainton Moses and well-known to all
interested in the subject, is a fine example and has
been exhaustively dealt with by A W Trethewy in
his book, “ The Controls of Stainton Moses ”
At the present time we have Mrs Hester Dowden,
who has a world-wide reputation; and Miss Geraldine
Cummins, who, as the transcriber of “ The Scripts of
Cleophas,” “ Paul in Athens,” “The Road to
Immortality,” of which Frederick Myers is believed
to be the instigator, and “ The Great Days of
Ephesus,” published November 1933, may well
claim place m the front rank of modern inspirational
writers
But, to the uninitiated, there is danger m playing
with fire, with forces of which we understand but
133
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
little, and I would recommend would-be automatic
scribes m their own interests to leave the practice
to the past-masters of the art, unless they are pre­
pared to devote both time and trouble to the
requisite training As m the case of every other
branch of psychic research work, the quality and
reliability of this pariiculai form of phenomenon
among those really qualified to practise it has risen
to a high level, much to the advantage of spiritualism
in general The whole subject has suffered, more
definitely than any other line of investigation from
the uninformed and irresponsible claimants to ab­
normal powers, whose “ guides” profess to descend
from the highest spheres for the purpose apparently
of expressing themselves m pious platitudes, poetical
effusions of the doggerel variety, or instruction m
science of a nature to make the entire Royal Society
turn m its grave—had it arrived there—while the
various scribes, honest, earnest and sincere as they
may be, oveilook the fact that they themselves are
entirely incapable of adjudicating on the merits or
demerits of any communication dealing with sub­
jects beyond the facts of ordinary hfe
This, naturally, has done as much m the past to
bring the whole subject into disrepute among those
who are capable of judging, as the exposure of
materializing mediums, and supplies the scoffer with
a keen-edged weapon for further attack I am not
attempting to throw discredit upon all automatic
writing—far from it—but merely suggest it is an easy
way to “go off the rails” from more than one point
134
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
of view, unless approached with care and diffidence
The attitude toward the subject of spiritualism m
all its branches has so altered during the last ten or
fifteen years that it is difficult to recapture the sense
of hostility and ridicule which its adherents once had
to face A broader-minded and more tolerant genera­
tion has arisen—the tolerance that comes of in­
difference, perhaps, on the one hand, on the other,
a true tolerance, brought about by the wonders of
modem science which seem to make all things
possible It is certainly a generation less prone to
scoff at other men’s gods merely because they do not
understand them
Few of us are protected by armour so clunk-proof
that it cannot on occasion be penetrated by the
subtle shafts of ridicule, and to be regarded with
indulgent amusement by persons whose intelligence
you know to be no less, and perhaps more, limited
than your own is an unenviable position1 When the
same measure is meted out to the really great minds
who have been brave enough to declare their faith
before the world, the martyr’s crown in very truth
should be awaiting them1
With a natural but foolish reluctance to face such
a situation, I once found myself in an inconvement
impasse of my own making It was in the early days
of my life in London I wished to visit Mr David
Gow at the offices of Light, then situated with the
headquarters of the London Spiritualists Alliance in
St Martin’s Lane.
Unfortunately, when I got there I could not
135
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
remember the number, and having tried two
numbers without success I turned, as we all do in
distress, to the nearest policeman.
I have always more or less had the courage of my
opinions, but I did shrink from the use of the word
“ spiritualist”— firstly because being new to the
practical side of the subject, I was not sure how far
the representative of the law might not feel justified
in “taking me up” as a vagabond; secondly because,
to be frank, I was reluctant to invoke the amuse­
ment I suspected would dawn under the shadow of
the austere official helmet that stood for common
senseinexcelsis.
So, carefully avoiding the pernicious word, I asked
if he could direct me to the Alliance Rooms.
“ Yes, madam,” he replied promptly, “last door
down on the left, next to the Coliseum,” and
following the direction I found myself in a Lyons
restaurant!
So 1 tried again— this time selecting a messenger-
boy, and varied the form of the inquiry.
“ Can you tell me the way to Light office?” I asked.
“ Yes, mum,” was the answer, “—last door up the
street on the right— ’lectric light office you mean!”
So 1 gave it up.
Soon after I came to London to live 1 met the well-
known theosophist, A. 1\ Sinnett; in spite of his
years upright, alert and with the bluest eyes I have
ever seem. Our friendship lasted until his death in
1921. His personality was remarkable, his brain
keen-edged, his flow of words and readiness of reply
136
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and metaphor on the public platform amounting at
times to the heights of oratory
For nine years he had held the position ofEditor to
the Pioneerm India, relinquishing the post eventually
because he and the proprietor of the paper did not
see eye to eye, and Mr Sinnett preferred to stand by
his faith and his principles rather than his own
interests He had been a personal friend of Madame
Blavatsky and told me many experiences m con­
nexion with that lady’s undoubted powers— many of
which I have had confirmed by other reliable
witnesses
From him I learnt much— of practical value and
otherwise— that greatly increased my wish to know
more of the scientific side of both theosophy and
spiritualism A P Sinnett had no psychic gifts
himself, beyond very considerable mesmeric pow'er
which, however, I never saw him put into practice
His books, of which there are many, deal with both
subjects from the intellectual standpoint The
modern edition of his book “ The Growth of a
Soul” traces the journey of man’s spirit through the
mazes and tangles of evolution from the view-pomt
of ancient Eastern philosophy, amplified by the
discoveries of modem science, much of which is
shown to have been foreshadowed in early sacred
writings Much of it no doubt must be placed under
the head of conjecture, but conjecture built upon
logical reasoning, affording glimpses of a cosmic
scheme that seems to bring us a step nearer to an
understanding ofGod’s purposes with regard to man.

It was through Mr Sinnett’s introduction to Mr
Robert Kong that I first came m contact with
psychometry, that wonderful gift that seems to lie
m the borderland between the physical and super­
physical world Mir King’s reputation as a psychic
is widespread, and as m psychometry the facts can
be immediately and more directly verified than in
the case of most other psychic or semi-psychic
phenomena, it affords a valuable introduction of the
subject to minds likely to be interested in the more
scientific side
I had already heard of the abnormal powers of
Mr King. ColonelJohnson, ofwhom I have already
spoken, had related to me one incident personal to
himself, having taken a small image carved m
ivory to be psychometrized
After holding it in his hand for a few moments
Mr King gave the following interpretation
“I get a sensation of rushing water The owner of
this object must have been drowned—no—that is not
so— the sensation I am getting is pleasant—water—
rushing water— cold— nothing but water—and that’s
all!” he finished and handed it back
The image was carved out of a whale’s tooth1
That story is not of a personal experience, it was
told to me and vouched for by Colonel Johnson,
but it is such a fine example of psychometry that I
give it here
My own experiences with Mr. King have been no
less remarkable The following is one outstanding
example ofmany
138
THIS WOPLD— AND BEYOND
For some years after my husband’s death I wore
his gold-linked watch-chain twisted twice round my
wrist as a bracelet On my first visit to Mr King,
who knew me so slightly at the time that he was not
certain of how to pronounce my name, he asked me
to give him something to hold to link him up with my
conditions, and I handed him the watch-chain
After a short pause he proceeded to give me every
detail of my husband’s last illness, with all his mam
characteristics, quite correctly, connected him with
water and the sea; referred to his predilection for
sport and games; even sketched m a little bit of his
family history, and finished off with a description of
our house m the New Forest where wc had lived for
over thirty years, and a remark about the happy
atmosphere and close comradeship of our married
life
That was the first stage m the incident, I have
drawn attention to the detail on account of what
followed
Some ten or twelve years after his death, the links
of the chain which I continued to wear as a bracelet
began to wear out Over and over again I had to
take it to be repaired, and finally I was warned it
was unsafe to go on wearing it as it might fall off m
the street and I should lose it altogethci
So m face ofsuch possible disaster I handed it over
to be put into the melting-pot and then to be
remoulded in the form m which I now wear it, a
solid gold bangle
Not long after this, I visited Mi Robeit King,
139
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
whom I had not seen for a considerable time, and on
being asked by him for something to hold, I handed
him, without a word, the gold bangle, quite un­
recognizable m its present form Having worn it for
so many years since it had first been psychometrized,
I fancied the original “vibrations” or “associations”
or whatever the right term may be, might have
taken up the overtones of my own life and have
somewhat confused the original
But the first question Mr King asked me was
“ Has this been m the San Francisco earthquake'*”
“ Good gracious, no!” I replied “What makes you
think so?”
“ I am getting nothing from it but the feeling of a
violent cataclysm1 Fire— a terrible heat—it might
be a volcano1
*”
And that was the only reaction he did get, and I
had to give him something else I was wearing to
establish the necessary link

HAT laws lie behind these psychometric
phenomena?
Call it a super-sensitivity that reacts to stimuli of a
more delicate nature than the normal The super-
sensitmty of—what?
None of the physical senses are called into action
on these occasions, the psychometnst is obviously
drawing on a centre of feehng, or it may be of
intuition lying beyond the range of ordinary normal
reactions
In animals, the more highly developed senses of
sight and smell may be called, from ourpoint ofview,
super-sensitivity; but that applies obviously to the
physical senses and' gives us no help toward a
solution of the processes of psychometry.
The laws of association may offer a clue if it can
be called as much A word, a sound, a scent buried
under the weight of years may suddenly re-awaken
into consciousness some slumbering cell m the brain,
a long-forgotten memory that, until the impinge­
ment of some particular wave-length, was to all
intents and purposes dead. In a flash a scene is
reconstructed of long ago and lives once more m all
its vibrant colour as real to the mental perception as
m the first moment of its creation m physical matter.

The fragment of a song— a whiff of red roses— and
like a picture flashed on the screen, some incident long
dead confronts the “ mind’s eye” with all the vivid
detail of yesterday
At Admiralty House m Bermuda the crew of the
Admiral’s galley were housed m a wooden structure
built among the trees by the path that led at a steep
gradient to the cove and garden below One of the
boat’s crew— I never discovered which—played the
flute, and on still nights the thread of some trivial
little melody used to reach our ears up at the house
He was not an accomphshed perfoimer, a hesitating
and tremulous uncertainty appeared to be the key­
note of his inspiration; the music was of no account
and could make no impression but of the most
superficial
And yet— all through the many decades that have
intervened whenever the thin notes of a flute fall on
my ear, m a flash the scene rises up, reconstructs
itself and confronts me— the soft indigo of the
tropical sky pierced with stars of a brilliance never
seen m these more sober climes, the moon shining
with a pale radiance upon the darkly outlined
branches of trees, great clusters of “Indian pride,”
the blossoms of purple in the daylight a luminous
grey under the moon, tangles of palm leaves thrust­
ing spiky fingers' upward toward the soft void of the
night; the creamy bells on a flowering aloe— and all
so still— so still and motionless it might have been a
scene on a stage, the gentle lap-lap of the water in
the cove below against the rocks—and that thin
142
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
little tune, repeating itself, meaning nothing, leading
to nothing, yet with a power so indelibly to impress
itself that upon one memory at least the record will
remain for a lifetime!
Is that a sort of mental psychometry? And if so,
may it not be as real as the other— and just as
wonderful1
Frau Lottie Plaat is one of the most accomplished
psychometrists m the world From a tiny bit of
rough stone held in her hand I have heard her
rebuild a scene stimulated into being— heaven knew
how1
— and described by her as
“— violent noise— fire— volumes of smoke----- 5
5
then, just as the listeners were deciding on a volcano
m eruption, she added, “— crowds of people----- ”
and finally, “ —water— water •” and from the owner
of the fragment we learned that he had himself
chipped it from the mole at Zebrugge after the
action
How was the history of that event recorded in the
stonei>
— and will it thiough all the ages continue to
radiate its life-history for those who have the
psychometncal sense through which to pick it up5
*
From a spot of blood on a piece of blotting-paper
sealed m an envelope I have heard Lottie Plaat
diagnose a case of cancer and give intimate details
of the nature and advance of the disease
I have been present at Marylebone House when
Mrs Spiers— well-known as psychometrist and
clairvoyante, m the world of psychic researchers—
gave over thirty readings m an evening from objects
143
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
claimed afterwards by their owners with an admission
ofthe accuracy ofthe descriptions, the most obdurate
sceptic m the world can neither deny nor refute the
facts of such demonstrations—he can only fail to
explain them1
Why should the psychologist, or the biologist, or
the expert m any branch of science most suited to
investigate the matter, refuse to take it up as a
serious study? A gift so delicately balanced on the
borders of both mental and physical and giving
results that can be immediately verified or dis­
credited, lies outside the area offraudulent activities
The scientist need have no fear of being “ let down”
as he has been on occasion when he takes the risks
of the physical phenomenon m the seance-room,
and there are many well-known accredited psycho-
metrists with whom to experiment— Mrs Spiers,
Horace Leaf, Miss Jacqueline, Ruth Vaughan, to
mention only a few of their numbei, and among
amateurs Maiy Monteith, now Mrs Humphrey
Marten, stands m the front rank.
In the case of the trance medium it is not such
plain sailing, in so far as m the eyes ofthe sceptic the
genuineness of the trance may be considered open to
question whore no confirmatory matter is obtained
m the content of the messages. Further, in this
branch of super-normal phenomena the scientist is
beginning to treat the subject seriously and to admit
that here is presented a problem which can no
longer be brushed aside by the orthodox doctor as a
form of epilepsy The experiments made lately on
144
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
psycho-analytical lines by scientific investigators m
America and that, it is to be hoped, may before long
be given pubhcity, should lead to the establishment
of such phenomena on a firm and indisputable basis
The scientist is, of course quite rightly, the very
embodiment of caution Whatever may be said to
the contrary the dictum of science leads the world in
its acceptance and concept of intellectual values m
the departments of knowledge We take its decisions
on trust, not because the scientists are never wrong,
but because we cannot prove them for ourselves
either way The man m the street would not know
how to prove that light travels at 186,000 miles a
second, but he believes it because science tells him
it is so, and once the seal of scientific approval is set
upon the phenomena which psychic researchers know
to be true through the empirical argument of
observed fact, we shall say a final good-bye to the
scoffer and to a certain type of “hard-boiled” sceptic
m the seance-room
Science is long m making up its mind. Sir Richard
Gregory, the editor of Nature, once said to me in
answer to a question about some discovery quoted
in the daily papers as likely to “revolutionize
science”
“If it’s new, it isn’t true; and if it’s true, it isn’t
new!” a testimony to the caution exercised by the
worker m the laboratories ofscience.
Orthodox medical opinion has turned a cold
shoulder to the trance of the medium, brushing it
aside as a variant of epilepsy or hysteria— if not
1+5
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
fraud1
— and exhibiting symptoms common enough
in the consulting-room, that mediumship m fact is
unworthy of special consideration from the doctor’s
point of view
The late Professor Waller, however, so far back as
1921, arrived at a different conclusion, and at a
lecture at the Royal Institution treated the super­
normal sensitivity of the medium m some of its
aspects as worthy of serious study, acknowledging
certain characteristics as definitely differentiating it
from ordinary pathological conditions
The lecture was entitled The Electrical Expression
of Human Emotion, and through the movements of
a galvanometer the physical reactions to various
emotions were demonstrated A spot of light,
fluctuating with the movements of an instrument
connected with the palm of the hand and the fore­
arm, registered visibly the passing emotions of the
subject of the experiment And there are no doubt
those who will object that there is nothing new m the
experiment; very possibly—the novelty lay in its
serious treatment in such an environment1
On the details of the process it is not necessary to
enlarge; anyone really interested can follow it up
and obtain any information required It is m
Professor Waller’s conclusions that our chief interest
lies
He classified the results ofhis studies systematically,
describing the reactions of the subject registered
through the galvanometrical deflections, to be m
three mam classes as follows
146
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
The emotive response of
Glass I Spiritualistic mediums and others “ Sen­
sitives” giving large responses (ten per
cent or more) from both hand and fore­
arm
Glass II “ Normals” giving httle or no response
(two to five per cent) from the hand, but
httle or no response from the forearm
Class III “ Insensitives” giving little or no response
(one per cent) from hand or forearm
Under the last heading subjects suffering from
shell-shock were included
He referred to three spiritualistic mediums with
whom he had had “the privilege of experimenting”
and finished the lecture with the remark that this
method might be used successfully for distinguishing
the true medium from the false, and “ that more
observations are necessary and more observers.”
Unfortunately, Professor Waller’s death occurred a
short time after the delivery of his lecture at the
Royal Institution, and an investigator who might
have carried on a most valuable line of research was
lost to psychic science
Since that memorable occasion, passed over at the
time, m my opinion, with too little comment, many
steps m advance have been made, m spite of the
continued and natural reluctance on the part of our
foremost thinkers to come out in the open and con­
fess to an interest in the subject The experiments
that have been lately carried on m America with the
147
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
co-operation of Mrs Garrett, the well-known trance
medium, should shortly place that aspect of medium-
ship on a much more stable footing. I am not re­
ferring only to the good work of Mr Hereward
Carrington who, as a psychic researcher, is auto­
matically “suspect” by the outside world, but by
orthodox experts m psychology and psychiatry, un­
connected withpsychicscience, and holding a position
in the world of knowledge that will carry weight m
itself We can only hope that the experiments may
lead to such indubitable and definite results that the
knowledge will not be withheld from a world that is
finding the gifts of the materialist but Dead Sea
fruit
The work has been carried on through psycho­
analytical tests, leading to the conclusion that the
entities controlling the medium when m trance and
when not m trance are definitely different personali­
ties. The reactions to the usual psycho-analytical
tests, if there be anything m them at all, appear to
prove this fact, putting out of court the old cry of
“dual personality,” meaning different aspects of the
same personality—a supposition that,I would suggest,
commends itself as a way out rather than an explana­
tion
Those who hold responsible positions m the various
psychical societies are not likely to under-value
the support of science in the fight still waging be­
tween materialism and the spiritual influences of the
universe, they know only too well how lightly and
how frequently the accusation of fraud is brought
148
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
against the trance medium and how difficult it is to
refute it We may know, through long experience, the
trance state to be genuine m the case of our tried
and reputable mediums, and be prepared to stand by
them in face of all antagonism
But when it comes to unsatisfactory sittings, where
the newcomer receives no proofs of identity, and the
messages are apparently quite unmeaning, it is not
an easy matter to persuade the disappointed sitter
that the “trance” is not merely histrionic display
on the part of the medium, and the inexperienced
are so much more ready to give positive opinions than
the tried investigator1 Many a time have I, when
carrying on my work at the British College, after
interviewing a dissatisfied sitter been left with the
impression that m believing in the bona fides of the
trance medium, I must be either a knave or an egre­
gious fool
On one occasion when my word had been ques­
tioned by an antagonist in the public press and I
was feeling sore m consequence, I poured out my
complaint to the ever-sympathetic ear of Sir Oliver
Lodge
“ I don’t mind bang called a knave,” I said, “ or
a fool I am used to both— but I do hate being called
a liar
“ No one would wish to do that,” Sir Oliver an­
swered “No one would be so discourteous as to call
you that What they mean is—they don’t quite
believe what you say •”
I was fortunate enough to get some of my early
149
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
experience of trance mediumship through Mrs.
Osborn Leonard and her control of world-wide
repute, “Feda ” At the beginning much of the
communication I received was of what the objector
calls the trivial type, my friends busying themselves
with establishing the fact of their identity beyond all
question m order that the dehvery of future evidence
and information should not be hampered by the con­
tinued seeking for “tests” on the part of the sitter,
an attitude which if protracted after a sufficiency
of “tests” has been received militates considerably
against successful results
A sitting with Hazel Ridley, the “voice” medium,
gave me a startling bit of evidence during her last
visit to London, m which no loophole was left for the
shaft of the sceptic
To the great loss of investigators on this side of the
veil, Miss Ridley passed beyond it some months ago
Miss Ridley’s gift was of an unusual kind, it might
almost have been called a blend of voice and trance
conditions The voice appeared to come from the
solar plexus, the articulation produced with scarcely
any movement of either tongue or lips, the medium
being m a condition of deep trance
My friend, Colonel Johnson, whom I have already
mentioned, died a few years ago at the advanced
age of eighty-three During the twenty years and
more that I have lived m London our acquaintance­
ship at the time of my experiences with Mrs Wriedt
had ripened into friendship, and when he died after
a long illness, his executor wrote to inform me of the
150
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
bare fact of bis death— nothing more—knowing I
should hear of it with regret.
A few months later, and having received no further
information, I had a sitting with Hazel Ridley A
voice purporting to be that of ColonelJohnson came
through, giving his name and the initials E R very
clearly Miss Ridley had never known him We
had a talk of ten minutes or so and, after sending
special messages to friends whom he mentioned by
name, he said he must go
“ Good-bye,” I said and, thinking only of his visit
to me, I added, “ and thank you for remembering
me ”
His answer surprised and a little bewildered me
“Not at all,” he protested, “I am glad to give it
to you! You deserve i t h e kindly added
I was referring only to the time he had given and
his kind remembrance of me, and I thought it rather
a quaint way of putting it. It was not till afterwards
I realized he must have thought I was speaking of
something else
A few weeks later I understood it.
I received a letter from his lawyers informing me
that he had left me a sum of money in his w ill1
Not an easy matter to explain through either tele­
pathy, or the subconscious mind 1

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
S
O far as I have been able to judge, friends and
teachers from the other world, although re­
fusing to solve our riddles m a manner that would
save us the trouble of thinking for ourselves, often
give a hint that sets the mind adventuring into un­
explored fields of speculation that prove to be pas­
tures in which it is well worth while to browse, or a
clue that leads, like Eric’s golden thread in the story
of our childhood, through the tangle of conjecture to
a new conception of some difficult problem.
Although our opponents continue to harp on the
worn-out string of trivialities in the seance-room m
spite of the several thousand books which piove the
contrary, I have often beenset thinking on serious and
quite fresh hnes by criticisms or suggestions on the
part ofcommunicators They will not put our doubts
at rest on such matters as reincarnation, different
forms of sectarian religion, or equally controversial
subjects Even if they cando so, why should they?
If there be any order or meaning m evolution we
have been set riddles to solve, were they to tell us the
answers not only would the divine scheme be frus­
trated, but the original presentation of the conun­
drum would be reduced to a meaningless futility
We have to do our own thinking, draw our own
152
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
conclusions, and be responsible for our own mis­
takes.
It is m the wholesale acceptance by the inex­
perienced of so-called “revelations” from the other
side that much harm is often done Each inquirer
on this side, especially if he be new to die subject, is
apt to consider his own communications only to
bear the hallmark of truth, and they are given to the
world as though fresh from the lips of omniscience
But to judge by results, there is as much divergence
of opinion among experts m the other world as
there is m this, and that prejudices and convictions
built mto the mentality here, have also to be
reckoned with there, and take a great deal of living
down
Therefore I suggest that, just as we have through
intellectual development discarded blind acquies­
cence with the rulings of Authority here, we should
be wary of according a too-ready acceptance merely
because the information may come from one who,
though no longer in the flesh, may still be bound by
his old limitations But the investigator may often
find himself able to give a useful push to the door
that is still but aj'ar, by following up speculations set
going by some incident m the stance-room. A word
may sometimes let in a flood of illumination to a
groping mind
At a sitting with Mrs Mason just a word once set
me thinking on such speculative lines
She was in deep trance and her control told me a
man giving the name of Hooper was standing behind
153
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
me I could remember no one ofthat name and said
so
“He is someone very near to you,” the control
assured me
“I knew someone called Hooker,” I suggested,
thinking of Sir Joseph Hooker, the Professor of
Botany, whom I had met m my youth, “ but so
slightly that he is not in the least likely to visit me,
but I never knew anyone called Hooper ”
The medium shook her head emphatically
“This man is near to you,” she repeated, “a rela­
tion. He is on yourfamily vibration ”
I left it at that—and later on realized I had given
another example of how slow and stupid one can be
in the seance-room, as I remembered my father’s
name was Cooper1
The error lay in the first letter, not m the fourth
as I had supposed But it was the remark about the
“ family vibration” that interested me
The control— “Maisie” —had sensed it, and stuck
to it m spite of my asseverations to the contrary She
knew in spite of my repudiation of all knowledge of
the visitor that he was a relative— on the family
vibration And, as my memory assured me later,
she was right and I was wrong1
What was it she sensed'* Some wave-lengths that
synchronized, thrown out by each of us into the
aura from some basic dynamic point of energy
common to those of the same blood?
Nonsense perhaps? But the medium did see some­
thing that led her to stick to her point in spite of all
154
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
I said to the contrary, and on the physical side we
get something analogous— there is a clue there that
might lead somewhere
Human blood is divided into four types In the
case of transfusion of blood that of the giver and of
the patient must be of similar type, or the results
are disastrous When it comes to the family it is
found that the children follow the type of blood
inherent m one of the parents If the father’s differs
from that of the mother the children will inherit
either one or the other There will be no fusion,
nor modification
The blood is the life— pulsating with the life force,
always m movement, and presumably sending out
into the aura some detectable demonstration of the
processes going on within In the admission of
science that there is no centre of chemical change
without a disturbed area m the ether surrounding it,
does not the human aura become a reasonable
hypothesis even to those not fortunate enough to be
able to see it?
This modem knowledge of the blood character­
istics is now utilized, so I have heard, by Scotland
Yard as evidence in criminal cases
Can we carry it tentatively a step further and see
something— more perhaps than mere analogy—
between this family obedience to a blood type and
the “family vibration” sensed by the medium?
This basic vibration or keynote of the individual
may be traced through colour—which as indicating
a certain rate of vibration would be regarded as a
155
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
symptom, not a cause At the present moment some
interesting experiments are being earned on with a
view to obtaining more definite light on the matter
Should they lead to even a working hypothesis it
opens a vista of future possibilities that may unravel
some of the tangles of the seance-room and be of real
assistance in stabilizing the conditions of some
forms of phenomena
It may even be possible through colour tests to
register the “ basic vibration” ofthe vanous mediums
working m the different organizations for psychic
research, and through comparison with that of the
proposed sitter be able to bring together the medium
and sitter most likely to be in accord with one
another In this way many failures might be averted
and a greater stability of results established
It may be that some law connected with this, the
synchronization of wave-lengths— or the want of
it—may he behind the many instances ofsuccess and
failure obtained by the same medium; one sitter will
obtain excellent results and recommend the medium
to a friend, who gets nothing at all! We all know of
innumerable cases of this sort
It would be an interesting experiment on this
plane, to bring together a medium and a sitter
whose blood-type coincides and see whether better re­
sults are obtained than with others where the types
of blood are dissimilar
The same process if applied to the healers and
patients m the movement might have valuable
results and save time and disappointment
156
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
To accept advice blindly from communicators in
the seance-room is obviously inadvisable and often
leads to trouble Common sense and the rules of
ethics are as essential m such cases as they are m
ordinary life; also a sense of proportion, which as
regards affairs of this material world, seems to get
sometimes clouded after a long period in a world of
very different values The ultimate decision m most
directions must always lie with ourselves, we can
never rid ourselves of responsibility, whether m this
world or the next We may accept the advice of a
doctor, but it is for us first to decide which doctor
it is to be The same in the world of business; we
may decide to take the advice proffered, but we must
feel our faith is justified in the man who offers it.
But once identity is established and you are con­
vinced the speaker is worthy of your trust, excellent
advice may be gleaned from those who care for you
and are watching over you. It was very early in my
experience with trance mediums that my father
came through to me and gave me an injunction,
which although I thought lightly of it at the time,
has affected my subsequent actions.
When, a great many years ago, I was very busy
thinking and writing on the subj'ect of psychic
investigation, I disliked the idea of public speaking
so fundamentally that I never contemplated such a
form of activity becoming a part of my life, and would
have stoutly denied the probability of it so doing
At the time I was doing a little “ hearthrug­
speaking,” as it might be called, meeting at some
157
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
friend’s house and addressing a small gathering in
an informal way Even that was against the gram, a
real effort, and that I should ever extend the scale
of the perfoimance in any further direction never
entered my brain
But my friends on the other side had apparently
arranged otherwise, for my father, in communicating
-with me one day, said earnestly
“ I wish you to remember this When you are
asked to speak m large halls you are not to refuse1
Promise mef”
So, m the full conviction that such a contingency
was never likely to arise, light-heartedly I promised,
thinking I was quite safef
When the proposition subsequently materialized
the promise rose up and confronted me1 The fact
of the situation having arisen implied a knowledge
on my father’s part that impressed me, drove me
into mastering an inherent reluctance, and even­
tually urged me into doing my best on the platform,
which otherwise I should certainly have evaded
Since then I have gone from bad to worse, and
nowadays when facing an audience runmng into
hundreds or even thousands, and wishing I had
never been bom, for the tension immediately before
speaking never seems to abate, I remember my
father’s injunction and wonder by what means he
was able to lift a corner of the veil and see what was
to happen m the future
I asked my husband on one occasion, through
Mrs Wnedt, whether the act ofcommunicating with
158
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
us on the earth they had left was m any way in­
jurious to them. It is continually suggested by the
inexperienced that it “ drags them down” or— most
unsubstantiated fallacy of all— keeps them “ earth-
bound ” Personally I had always felt it was an
insult to suggest such a thing— even to hint that
they were capable of turning their backs on those
they had loved on earth and to whom they were
tied perhaps by bonds of gratitude, for the sake of
their own “ advancement ”
My husband was very emphatic on the subject
“ The pull of love never yet dragged anyone
down,” he said, “nor could it be m any way in­
jurious— so long as it is real love, with no shadow of
the self behind it Love is the most divine, the most
ennobling, besides being infinitely the most potent
force in the Cosmos Do you suppose that where
true love exists the tie can ever be broken— be it
across limitless space or aeons of time? So long as
there remains on earth one soul we care for, wc
remaun within reach ofthe earth condition and renew
our touch with it—when we choose When the last
soul for whom we have any affection comes over
here, we may turn our backs on earth if we choose
and give it no more attention ”
‘‘Then coming ‘down’ tousdoesnotkeepyou back?”
He laughed
“ O f course not To begin with, unless I wish to
come, you could not force me to do so We can
always ‘tune m’ to a lower plane when we choose,
to the higher the right of entry has to be earned.
159
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Take a case on the earth plane Does xt injure your
mental condition to hold a conversation with, say,
an illiterate tramp on the roadsp You have to
bring yourself down to his level, to enter his world,
but he cannot rise to yours, or enter your world until
through education he opens the door to it It does
you no harm so long as you do not elect to remain m
his world of undeveloped mentality, and so revert to
his level for good and all 5

“What would you describe as earthbound'5

“ Souls become earthbound that have been and
remain so wrapped up m material interests, the
things of this world, that they continue to linger m
the conditions which still give them some satisfaction
Those who are actuated by revenge, lust, jealousy,
love of money, desire for personal fame, who made a
god of their possessions These are the souls who
become tied to earth, living on a wave-length from
which they find it impossible to switch off, until the
earnest wish to do so, coming from within themselves,
calls to their aid some of the ready helpers always to
be found in a world where service to others is the
mainspring of action. ‘Set your affection on things
above5were not empty words
In answer to the question “ Why do we hear of so
many cases of ‘haunting5by priests, monks, nuns and
so on, souls who it may be presumed led a good and
holy life while m this world? Why should they find
themselves ‘earthbound5 when they leave it'5
5

He replied: “Because their attention was focused
on the trappings of religious worship rather than on
160
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
the inner spiritual meaning The embroidered altar
cloth, the golden chalice, the priceless vestments,
the genuflexions, they all loomed larger m the ritual
of their religion while on earth than the essence of
the religion itself They had persistently tuned m to
the material side, to a wave-length that kept them
fast bound to the level of the things o f earth You
very quickly learn here that we make our own heaven
or hell— which although man professes glibly enough
to believe, the profession is but skm deep, he fails
to realize the inescapable law that lies behind, or he
would be at greater pains to avoid the inevitable
consequences of its operation There is no arbitrary
punishment—just cause and effect; his fate hereafter
is the result of his own actions A way was opened
two thousand years ago through which, by the super-
imposition of a still greater law those results may be
mitigated— but it is in man’s own hands to put that
law into operation and to study the working of it ”
Another light on the future life was given to me by
my husband through Miss Francis and her fine
control, “ Lucio,” m the early days of my experiences
with trance-mediumship
When on earth, my husband was a great gardener.
Anything he put into the ground seemed to grow
without any trouble So it was not a surprise to me
to hear that m the land of results, where our wishes
here bear fruit, he should describe the beautiful
garden he was preparing for me there. He spoke of
flowers of a texture and magnificence that I could
not even imagine, and colours beyond all the beauties
161
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
our limited spectrum could boast, and that our eyes
had not seen nor dreamed of
He also spoke of other work upon which he was
engaged, prompting me to ask what happened to the
garden when he was not there to tend and pay
attention to it.
“ I get someone else to do it for me,” he replied
“Do you pay him for his work as we do here?” I
asked
“ I pay him—yes; but not as you do I give him
my gratitude That makes you smile,” he added—
and it certainly did! “ I am afraid in your busmess-
ndden world it would not count for much1 But here
it’s different. A vibration—if we can call it that—
there seems to be no better word—is an asset m this
world Gratitude and love make the currency of
the country with us If on earth you have lived a
selfish life, shut yourself away from your fellows,
drawing to yourself neither love nor gratitude, you
come over here a pauper, bankrupt, insolvent,
destitute of any means for exchange Nothing to
give anybody for what they may give you That love
is the ruling force of the Cosmos is not merely a
picturesque manner of speech
“ But,” he went on, “although we may not have a
currency in terms of money let no one imagine he is
going to get an easy something for nothing If he
has acquired neither love nor the goodwill of his
fellow-creatures on earth, a long term of service for
others and remorse for having neglected his oppor­
tunities may lie before him before it can be put right ”
162
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
HROUGHOUT the past history of science
how many instances have there been, I
wonder, of impostors foisting alleged scientific
discoveries on the world of learning and “getting
away with it?”
Within my memory there remain two outstanding
attempts— omitting the case of Louis de Rougemont,
whose celebrated effort was aimed not particularly
at the scientists but at the world m general— to
hoodwink the men of knowledge from the Royal
Society downwards, both of which proved futile
within a negligible space of time Men of science
are not so easy to deceive as some of our critics would
have us believe1
One of these unsuccessful attempts to deceive was
made, it will be remembered, when a certain
traveller on returning to England claimed to have
reached the North Pole Within a span that could
be measured in days his claim was discredited by the
scientists, and the world at large that had been
ready enough to crown him with laurels, accepted
their dictum The traveller with his tale passed in­
to oblivion The processes that knocked the bottom
out of his claims were of an abstruse nature, and
whether his eventual recantation was due to mathe-
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
matical calculation or to a justifiable third degree
interrogation I do not now remember
To digress for a moment, this episode curiously
enough gave me the inspiration for a novel, and led
to a little incident that may be worth recording
It seemed to me when I read ofit m the newspapers
a good theme on which to build a story— either that
a man should profess to have reached the North
Pole and subsequently be proved an impostor; or
that he should have succeeded in getting there and,
m the absence of definite proof, be disbelieved and
discredited on his return
It was in the comparatively early days ofmy career
as a novelist; we were living m the New Forest, out
of reach of all ready means of getting information,
or any sources of knowledge to which to apply I
was greatly set on this idea, and my fellow writers
will understand my reluctance to let this child of
my brain die at birth!
But the idea seemed to be unmanageable. To
prove anything for or against an alleged visit to the
North Pole was possible only through mathematical
calculations of times and distances that were quite
beyond me, and anyway would have bored my
readers.
So I moved the locale of my story elsewhere My
adventurer should visit some little-explored tropical
forest m the Amazon country, contract a disease
that could be contracted only m that particular
region, return to England, have his claims as an
explorer discredited, and finally vindicate his
164
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
character by dying of the disease he could not
possibly have contracted anywhere else1
To push it to its ultimate would be, of course, going
too far— but he would have to very nearly die of i t 1
The trouble was to find the appropriate disease1
Out of reach of research doctors and colleges of
medicine, it seemed almost an insoluble problem
Needless to say, I confided m no one, there has
always been a tradition among writers that to
“ broadcast” a story still m embryo is asking for
possible trouble m a world where walls have ears
But all my life I have believed that if you wish for
anything hard enough and steadily enough, it will
come to you, which is a crude presentation of some­
thing to be dealt with later on
By day and in my dreams at mght I turned the
problem over in my brain, loth to give it up, but
hopelessly at sea as to its solution The idea was good
ground I felt sure, all that was required was the
suitable seed to sow in it
Then, from the blue, when I had almost deter­
mined to give it up and turn my attention m another
direction, I received a note from a neighbour in the
Forest, Sir William Mather, to whom I had never
mentioned the subject, with an invitation to lunch
on the following day,
“ Professor Balfour,” he wrote, “is staying with us,
and I think you would be interested to meet him
He is the Head of the College for the investigation
of infectious tropical diseases at Khartoum, and is
shortly going back there ”
165
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
If earnest desire be in itself a prayer, then never
had I had more direct or definite answer1 Needless
to say, I accepted the invitation
And Professor Balfour— as he was then; afterwards
Sir Andrew Balfour, Director of the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine— most kindly
entered into the spirit of the matter, being himself
something of a novehst, and supplied me with all the
material I wanted
It seemed there was an unpleasant hasmogregarine
that had been found m rats m the forests of South
America, which had m their turn infected a species
of mosquito So far this particular specimen had
not been found m human blood, but Professor
Balfour said they were expecting this further develop­
ment to present itself at any moment m the shape of
a patient suffering from some hitherto unknown
tropical disease The mosqmto would play the part
of intermediary host between the rat and humanity
He gave me treatises on the subject to read, with
accounts of exhaustive experiments that had been
tried on rats, but to my great discouragement it
seemed at first glance that all the rats had died1
That of course was no good to me. The hero of
my adventure had to hve, and it was with relief that
I discovered on further investigation that Rat No 14
had 'got the better of the haemogregarme and made
a triumphant recovery1
What a rat could do, man could do, and on that
basis I wrote my book; not as might be supposed,
from the foregoing description, as a comedy, but in
166
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
a vein that was seriously treated by the press and my
readers, and for some reason that I cannot now
recollect, called it “The Valley of Achor ” It led to
my becoming acquainted with the explorer, Colonel
Fawcett He wrote as a stranger to ask how I had
acquired my knowledge of South American forests,
I could only imagine from a previous incarnation1
He came to see me and spoke ofhis hopes and aims—
of an impregnable city and a white race m the heart
of unexplored regions, and I saw him just before
he started on the journey from which he has not so
far returned
And now, after a digression showing how really
earnest wishes may be brought to pass by those
invisible friends who help us with our worldly
affairs, and for which I hope I may be forgiven, I
will return to the subject matter of the opemng
remarks of this chapter
O f the second attempt to hoodwink the scientists I
cannot speak with accuracy, but anyone whose
interests have run along such lines will remember
the occasion, when a so-called inventor came for­
ward with the tale of a discovery of a certain ray—
did he call it an F ray?— by the application o f which
mines and such-hke could be exploded from a
distance at sea
Experiments were made somewhere off Toulon—
but it was the pretensions of the impostor that
exploded, not the mine
By which I suggest that it is not so easy to take the
scientist m as the man in the street seems to suspect.
167
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
The consideration of his individual hne of study is
not of so much importance as the power of percep­
tion, of a mind trained to accurate observation, as the
scientific mind is trained If a scientist— such as
Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William
Barrett and a host of others—be incapable of decid­
ing that a phenomenon is genuine, why should the
man m the street be capable of deciding it is a fake?
However, the physical phenomenon of the seance-
room, after a strenuous battle of over eighty years,
has become an acknowledged fact to those who have
really been sufficiently interested to study it seriously,
the attitude of the investigator to-day is no longer—
are these things true? but, why do they take place'*
— and how can we sufficiently understand the law
that rules them to induce the phenomena at will by
producing the necessary conditions?
That we have not advanced more rapidly is, m my
opimon, to a great extent our own fault; through the
nature of the so-called precautions taken against
fraud, half the time we are inhibiting the very
phenomenon we wish to induce The mediums for
this form of phenomenon have become more rare,
more difficult to find than m the halcyon days of
Eusapia Palladino, Mrs Guppy, Darnel Home,
Florne Cook, Cecil Husk and others; again, greatly
our own fault.
During the Middle Ages, under the name of
witches, mediumship went near to being exter­
minated through the ignorance of their persecutors;
to-day any ignorant newcomer, inexperienced in
168
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
psychic research, can bring charges of fraud m
the stance-room and discredit the medium, who is
thereupon of necessity discarded by the various
societies owing to risk of trouble in the law courts,
where the present attitude of the law makes the
battle one-sided
Perhaps it is not always the inexperienced who are
to blame So little headway has been made in the
understanding of these phenomena, where even the
wise and learned are obliged to acknowledge their
ignorance, that mediums for the physical phenomena
are continually lost to us through the suspicion of
fraud, when with a little more knowledge a legitimate
explanation might be forthcoming, not only super­
normal law, but answers to such questions as— what
is the basic cause of the differences between the
medium and the ordinary individual?— what is it
that facilitates a ready surrender of superfluous
ectoplasm?— and what is the effect likely to be on
the medium of that continual surrender? Not only
m the case of ectoplasmic demonstrations, but with
trance, where the entire machinery of mind and body
is given over to a control possibly unfamiliar with or
indifferent to the metabohc processes of the body,
temporarily ^divorced from its rightful owner?
Owing to this dearth of physical mediumship, it
was some little time after I came to hve in London
before I was brought into contact with any form of
“materialization” —beyond what might be called
the half-way house of the direct voice My first
experiences were with Miss Bessmet from America,
169
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
when on a visit to the British College of Psychic
Science in its old quarters m Holland Park I was
no longer looking for proof of survival, having ob­
tained enough to satisfy me through the direct voice
My interest was centred m the problems presented
by the scientific aspect of the subject, and the search
for truth along any lines that offered
Miss Bessinet’s form of materialization was of an
unusual kind The séance which I first attended
consisted of from ten to twelve persons,seated round
a large table with the medium at one end Mr
Hewat McKenzie, founder and Hon Principal of
the College at the time, sat on the medium’s im­
mediate left, and was in control of the gramophone
The séance was conducted m the dark Sir Arthur
and Lady Conan Doyle were present among the
sitters
The manifestation took the form of faces,
illuminated by an attendant hght which, with the
face, remained poised m mid-air m front of the
sitter for whom it was intended The faces faded and
reformed, as materialized objects will, a sort of ebb
and flow of the power that keeps them m being
The most interesting, because the most convincing
point, from my own point of view, lay m the fact
that the “materialized” faces were appreciably under
normal size Judged roughly, they were about three
quarters as large as that of the ordinary adult
Miss Bessmet is not a small woman, she has a fine face
and distinctive features, nor would it have been
possible for her to present it to the sitters either from
170
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
her chair, or standing at the end of the table at the
particular angle at which each face did confront us.
If masks at the end of a stick, as I have heard it
suggested, should be the solution, how would they
have been imported into the séance-room after the
medium had been rigorously searched by expert
investigators?
The faces were the colour of plaster, not so white
or luminous as alabaster or marble, and beautifully
moulded— if moulded they were— and m most
instances definitely recognizable The face that was
shown to me was undoubtedly that of my mother.
Sir Arthur also recogmzed his mother, pointing out,
to Lady Doyle, the striking likeness and tracing the
hnes on her face m detail
We were told that each sitter would be drawn to
his or her feet for the personal demonstration When
my turn arrived I felt something that might have
been the fingers of a hand take me by the collar of
my coat, and I was lifted on to my feet by a force as
inexorable and impossible to resist as the pull of a
steam crane would have been, from directly above
my head It was not m the nature of the upward
pull given by a man’s arm, there was no give in it.
The steady, inevitable force of a steam crane in
action is the only thing to which I can compare it.
To have attributed this phase of the phenomenon to
action on the part of the medium would have been
an absurdity Miss Bessmet was seated at least two
yards away from me, with two sitters between her
and myself. Any upward pull on her part from
171
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
such an angle would have had a forward or sideways
inclination—if she could have reached me at all.
The pull which drew me to my feet was from directly
above, and the irresistible power of it inspired me
with a lasting respect for the unknown forces with
which we so light-heartedly tamper1
Subsequently there were doubts raised as to the
genuineness of Miss Bessinet’s mediumship, and far
be it from me to step m where angels have not feared
to tread1
But the doubts were based mainly on the fact that
on one occasion after the séance, when the light was
turned up, the medium was found to be standing on
her feet instead of sitting on her chair Now I have
seen m good red light the throes and contortions into
which a medium may be thrown before giving birth
to ectoplasm, when it was evident that had she not
been securely tied m the chair, she would have
been ramping round the room Therefore, m the
case of Miss Bessmet, from my own personal point
of view and m the light of my experience, my faith
in the genuineness of her mediumship remained
unshaken
“ Feda” once complained to me of how greatly we
on this side under-estimated the “ pull” of ectoplasm
“ It will draw a leg or an arm after it as the ectoplasm
is extruded from the limb,” she explained; “ it is
always the impulse of the limb to follow Then if
investigation at an unfortunate moment reveals a
hand or foot mixed up with the ectoplasm the
medium is of course accused of fraud — which is
172
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
another instance of the subtle difficulties presented
by psychic research as compared with its legitimate
sister, physical science1
The phenomena produced by Frau Silbert under
the guidance of her control “Herr Nell,” were less
spectacular than the materialized faces of Miss
Bessmet, but equally interesting When I sat with
her we were given good examples of telekinesis,
or the movement of objects without contact We sat
at a table m the top of which a square aperture had
been cut, with a loose cover of dark cloth over it
Objects were placed on the floor beneath the table,
converted into a immature “dark room” by a sur­
rounding table cover, and with Frau Silbert’s hand
held by the sitters on either side of her and her feet
under equally effective control, these objects would
be thrown up on to the table through the aperture
in the top of it
Some of them, such as a penknife or cigarette case,
would be found to have the name of the control
“Nell” scratched on them after an incredibly short
interval of time, and a materialized hand, the
means presumably of the operations below, would
appear for a moment through the aperture, visible
to all the sitters present
The cruder forms of the purely physical type of
phenomenon, such as the throwing about of tables,
spinning of tambourines, ringing of bells, do not
seem to be helping us much along the road to know­
ledge They are negligible so far as proof of survival
is concerned They may testify to the presence of
173
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
unseen operators with intelligence at work, but there
is no solid ground for the assumption that those
operators were ever here m the flesh, unless the
demonstration embraces more than telekinesis only
Here again “ Feda” threw a little light on the
causes of success or failure m the stance-room
“The operators who are actually doing the work
are what you would call navvies,” she said, “nothing
but manual workers— only it’s done in a different
way They have people directing them, who are
directed m their turn by higher intelligences who
understand the laws governing the operations, just
as operations are carried out here m fact If the
navvies go out on strike— such a noosance— (she
interpolated)— “ and they do sometimes— then no-
tlung happens
It sounded simple enough— but, as far as I was
concerned, the explanation appeared to be as far
away as ever1
174-
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
IN the world of physical phenomena the
“ Reflectograph” has been to me a most fruitful
field for study, with Mr B K Kirkby as director
and Mrs Singleton as medium
I had the privilege of working with them to a
certain extent m the earlier stages of development,
and had opportunities for the study of ectoplasm
and its ways that has stood me m good stead ever
since
The story of how this particular form of demon­
stration came into being is a romance in itself, and
shows us how plans and resolutions made on this
plane may sometimes be carried out subsequently
on the next as the result of deliberate intention and
preparation.
Mr B K Kirkby tells the story At a chance
trance sitting at which his mother took control, he
had his first introduction to spiritualism; as the result
of an injunction from her to pass on the knowledge
wherever he went and not “to keep it to himself as
the rest of the world are doing,” he took up the
subject m good earnest, and has devoted his life to
it ever since
Shortly after this sitting, he met a man called
George Jobson, at that time paralysed and bed-
175
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
ridden, but with a brain still alive and working along
old lines George Jobson had brought one of the
first telephones into this country, he had travelled
the world over m search of knowledge and was one
of the early pioneers of photography and wireless.
To cut a long story short, they made a pact that
they would try and establish some means of com­
munication after George Jobson had passed into the
next hfe, not only made a pact, which many seemed
to have done and then found it impossible to carry
out, but set to work to go through a definite prepara­
tory training m the hope of laying some foundation
for success w the experiment hereafter
“ I will call you up,” he said, “with letters as they
do on the wireless Choose the letters
After some deliberation they chose Mr Kirkby’s
initials, B K K , as the sign between them
The paralysed man then had these letters written
in large size upon a piece ofpaper and pinned up on
the foot of his bed Morning, noon and mght he
repeated them, memorized them, impressed them on
his brain Up to the last two or three days of his hfe
those letters stared him m the face; whenever his
eyes were open they confronted him for months, his
lips continually repeating them, in the hope that they
might form the link between the brain ofhis physical
body and that of his astral, proving the continuity of
memory which is the corner-stone of personality.
Three months after Jobson’s death, Mr Kirkby,
at a seaside place, met a psychometrist who was a
stranger to him, but who had been highly recom-
176
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
mended as a “ seer ” Not having the time at the
moment to sit with the psychometrist, he gave him an
article that had belonged to George Jobson with a
request that if he should obtain from it anything of
an interesting nature he would let him know. As the
medium would be in trance, his sister promised to
make a faithful record of anything that transpired
A few days later Mr Kirkby re-visited the psycho-
metnst and his sister, and asked if any message had
been obtained
“ This is all we have got— and we can’t under­
stand it,” was the answer “For nearly a quarter of
an hour these letters were impressed * ‘B K K —
B K .K ’ ” then followed “ ‘Remember the signal.
Now we see through a glass darkly, but later we are
going to see one another face to face It is George—
George— George *
’ ”
From that incident sprang the co-operation be­
tween the two planes— Mr. Kirkby and Mrs Single-
ton working together on this, George Jobson and his
“control,” a young girl who passed early from earth
life, called “ Ethel,” on the other
In giving my experience with this group I am
merely transcribing to the best of my ability exactly
what occurred I do not say the conditions so far as
“ test” were concerned, might not have been tightened
up m accordance with the best traditions; but to
have watched the gradual development of the ecto­
plasmic rod, and be allowed to take part in the ex­
periment, gave me opportunities which were suffi­
cient to convince me through my physical senses,
177
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
plus common sense, of the genuineness of the
phenomena In this behef, Sir Ohver Lodge, later
on, was willing to support me
When I first sat with the Reflectograph group the
display of ectoplasm was crude and immature The
medium, Mrs Singleton, sat m a semi-dark cabinet,
the room illuminated by a good red hght, and at that
early period the medium herself being partially
visible from certain angles to the sitters She was
tied to the chair, the back, arms and legs of it, by
cords which with Mr Kirkby’s consent I often mani­
pulated myself The keyboard upon which “ Ethel”
was to operate was placed at some distance m front
of her, well outside the cabinet
This keyboard consisted of the letters of the alpha­
bet, each painted on a disk so delicately poised that
the shghtest touch, or even a breath, was sufficient
to depress them Against the wall was placed an
indicator also displaying the letters of the alphabet,
each of which became luminous as its duphcate on
the keyboard was touched, presumably by the ecto­
plasmic rod manipulated by “ Ethel ” In this way
messages were spelt out, sometimes pertinent and
recognizable, sometimes not, but it was on the
phenomenal side rather than the content of the mes­
sages, that the interest ofthe sitters focused, especially
if their mentality was of the scientific order I shall
always be grateful for the opportunity of watching
developments of a super-physical order in circum­
stances where experiments were so frankly and
openly carried on
178
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
At my first sittings with the Reflectograph, a rod of
ectoplasm only was visible, starting from the direc­
tion of the medium and extending to the disks on the
keyboard, a faint line of luminosity, but evidently
directed by some intelligence, as its movements with
regard to the letters on the keyboard testified As
each letter was depressed the contact was reflected on
the indicator against the wall, haltingly at first but
gaining in strength and confidence as time went on—
passing from individual letters only to the spelling of
intelligible words
With the idea of making assurance doubly sure,
experiments were tried with a gauze curtain stretched
across the front of the cabinet between the medium
and the keyboard
Although the ectoplasm passed through it, how­
ever, the impact appeared to break up the rod, divid­
ing it into rays giving the appearance of a searchlight,
no one of them having sufficient force to depress
the disks independently A coarse net was tried
with the same result, and the experiment was given
up.
It was not long before patient endeavour was
rewarded, and a further development took place
A hand was formed at the end of the rod, with
fingers and thumb folded m what is termed the
“snake’s head” form; followed later by an opening
out, the fingers and thumb becoming widespread and
perfectly moulded Faint and misty at first, a wisp
of cloud taking the form of a hand, materializing
and fading away, and materializing again— that ebb
179
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and flow ofthe power that I have already mentioned
as accompanying all physical phenomena
Finally the hand, so misty and undefined in its
earlier stages, developed into something concrete,
solid as flesh and bone, every finger perfectly formed,
and I was allowed to touch and handle it, or rather to
allow it to touch me
I found it at that stage verycold, lifeless and heavy,
as one would imagine a dead hand might be; but
later on the temperature of it became normal, more
like that of a human hand, of a different type and
size from that ofthe medium, but to sight and touch
a normal human hand, in every detail
When this stage was reached, Sir Oliver Lodge was
good enough to come and give an opimon of the
phenomenon He tied the medium m the chair and,
visible at first as a filmy outline, the hand material­
ized as usual; he was able to examine it at close
quarters, handling it, touching nails and knuckles,
which he pronounced to be perfectly formed m every
respect, and finally expressed his conviction that
the demonstration was genuine.
It is not easy for the inexperienced sitter to take in
the true significance of such a phenomenon at first
glance It exacts a sudden re-orientation of previous
conceptions that the understanding is apt to jib at,
and it is almost impossible at first to get away from
the suspicion of a conjuring trick. Therefore the
utmost caution before “turning down” a physical
phenomenon at a single sitting, or even more than
one, is as essential as in accepting it. The new sitter
180
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
may find it difficult to understand his— or her— own
limitations through inexperience, not realizing how
hard it is for the intelligence to swallow so large a
dose at one gulp1
Many a time have I been “up against” this situa­
tion in connexion with the materialized hand of the
Reflectograph What sort of “miracle” the new­
comer actually expects is difficult to imagine, but if
the appearance and the feel of it differ from that of
flesh and blood— which was sometimes the case m its
earher stages of development— it is immediately
suggested by the sitter that it is a counterfeit made of
wax or mdiarubber or some other material which
must have been smuggled into the cabinet by the
medium This suggestion is upheld, no matter how
meticulous the preparatory search may have been,
and which incidentally reduces all such search to
futile waste of time
But the more minutely the materialized hand
resembles the genuine article— as was the case in its
final development— the more convinced the tyro
becomes that it obviously is a human hand— and
therefore must be fraud and is the hand of the
medium1 A vicious circle1
From a smgle hand “ Ethel” advanced to a demon­
stration of both hands, and from that arrived at the
achievement ofthe full figure; draped forms standing
m front ofthe cabinet with a faint red light illuminat­
ing the rest of the room, she herselfbeing one of the
first appearances George Jobson also materialized,
fulfilling his early promise that his friend and he
181
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
should see one another “face to face ” Many other
forms recognized by sitters, most of them clad in
clinging white drapery that seemed to have a lumi­
nosity of its own—something beyond the ordinary
appearance of a white object such as a handkerchief,
m semi-darkness, and justifying the age-old tradi­
tion of “ghosts” and heavenly visions, the “radiantly
white” figures spoken ofin the Bible
I passed my hand on one occasion—with per­
mission— through the gossamer-like drapery hanging
from the arm of a materialized form, it passed
through it as though it were mist not substance, and
though I was conscious of a soft touch on my hand,
there was no feeling ofany sort of obstruction
Among the various materializations I have seen
there a little coloured gill sometimes appears She
is full of life and spirits, shows the whites of her eves
and a little bright red tongue in sharp contrast to
her dark skin Everyone present sees it and hears
her childish chatter If Mrs Singleton, hands tied
to chair, can blacken her face and get it clean again
inside the cabinet m the time at her disposal she
ought to go on the music-hall stage1 That there are
no masks and faces hidden undei her chair I can
testify personally
I have seen figures at these manifestations de-
matenalize by sinking through the floor, not merely
vanishing by retiring into the cabinet
With regard to messages received through this
channel success has not, within the bounds ofmy own
experience, been so marked This of course may
182
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
depend upon many factors, and be partly owing to a
slight impatience on my part— quite unjustifiable—
due to what has sometimes seemed a rather tedious
process, and not nearly so easy and rapid as the
direct voice, or even the channels of trance medium-
ship. To spell out every word, be it ever so swiftly, is
somewhat akin to table-rappmg, which must always
be a strain on the patience of most temperaments.
When I have been present a large proportion of the
messages being addressed to others has made it diffi­
cult to form a definite opinion, but very many of
them have seemed to be unrecognized My own
private opinion has always been that the powers
on the other side have been more definitely con­
cerned with and interested m the physical side of the
phenomena than m the conveyance of communi­
cations, and have dedicated the power, of which
there is only a limited supply, to this end Perhaps
I have come to this conclusion because I myself was
more interested in the materializations than m the
messages and a natural bias was the result!
At the same time it is to be recorded that I have
received two outstanding messages through this
agency, of a nature sufficiently convincing to prove
that whatever the proportion of failures the poten­
tiality for the establishment of direct communi­
cation is there and the efforts made entirely genuine.
On the first occasion Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
purported to be the communicator,and he reproached
me m unmistakable terms for having neglected to act
upon a letter he wrote to me some time before his
183
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
death suggesting I should adopt a certain hne of con­
duct with regard to a medium I regret to say I had
pushed it into a drawer and forgotten all about it1
No one knew of that letter except myself for I had
mentioned it to no one We discussed the contents
through the Reflectograph, and finally I acted upon
it
The other incident was even more remarkable
With the object of showing it to a member of the
Council, I had carried a document belonging to the
British College of Psychic Science away with me one
Saturday afternoon, and on my return home to my
flat m Westminster found to my dismay I had lost it.
Whether it had been dropped m ’bus, taxi, m the
street or in the car of a friend with whom I had
driven some little distance I had no idea. I was dis­
tracted 1 The document did not belong to me and
should certain circumstances arise it might be of the
greatest importance— and I, through some sort of
carelessness, had dropped it !
I spent a nearly sleepless night and on the next day,
Sunday, inquired in every direction I could think of
in the hope of tracing it, with no result On Mon­
day I made equally vain inquiries at the Scotland
Yard Lost Property Office, and then gave up all
hope of ever seeing it again
Late on the Tuesday evening I had an engage­
ment to go to Wimbledon for a sitting with the
Reflectograph group Almost the first message that
ramp through was for me, “Ethel” spelling it out on
the keyboard
18+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
“ For Mrs de Crespigny Don’t worry It will be
all right The missing paper will return ”
I could hardly beheve my ears, for, with the ex­
ception of Mrs. Hankey, the secretary of the College,
who was not present, I had mentioned my loss to no
one, in the hope my sm would not find me out !
I thanked my informant, and had a good night in
the assurance through long experience that mes­
sages given spontaneously and not as the result of
questions never “let me down”— and on Wednesday
mormng the document arrived by the first post, from
a stranger who had picked it up on the pavement m
Victoria Street the previous Saturday; had been in
two minds as to whether it was worth while to return
it at all, and finally decided to despatch it to the
address that was on the opened envelope !
That was one ofthe best bits ofevidence in the way
of a message I ever received It was given before
witnesses, Mbs Hankey could testify to the original
loss of the paper, and as no one present at the séance
knew anything of the circumstances— not even my­
self so far as the finding and return of it was con­
cerned—the suspicion of interference on the part of
the subconscious mind, or thought-reading could be
put out of court It is some considerable time now
since I have had the opportunity to watch further
developments with this group so I can offer no
opinion on them I can only speak of and vouch for
what occurred within my own knowledge
The point about the validity of messages given
spontaneously is worthy of consideration, and of
185 «
3
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
careful record on the part of sitters Personal ex­
perience is the field for individual observation, and
results may possibly differ, but I have found that
in questions asked with a bias m a given direction, or
even an earnest desire with regard to the answer—
and it is difficult to eliminate all bias on such occa­
sions—an influence ofsome sort reaches the medium’s
mind, and the answers obtained cannot be relied
upon with certainty They may afterwards prove to
have been inaccurate, especially when prophecies
with regard to future events are concerned
But when information is spontaneously volun­
teered, without any lead, conscious or unconscious,
having been given by the sitter, then m every case I
have known, I may almost say without exception,
information so given turns out to have been correct
One of the many handicaps in the investigation of
this subject lies m the fact that so many messages
received are of a private nature and not to be
blazoned abroad. But to select one that is not so, a
httle story of an incident connected with “ Lucio,”
the control of Miss Nina Francis, may be of interest
although the subject of it is entirely personal Years
ago he predicted that a certain novel of mine would
eventually be produced on the screen, but he could
not give the name of it beyond the fact that the title
had something about “ Evidence” m it
186
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
A
S it is the ambition of most novelists to see
their work produced on the screen I may be
forgiven perhaps for the personal element in this
brief story As the years passed and nothing further
transpired, the incident drifted to the back of my
brain and, although loth to decide the message had
played me false, I really ceased to think any more
about it
And then, only last year, I received another
Mrs AnnieJohnson was giving clairvoyance at one
of the Marylebone Society’s Sunday evening
meetings at the Queen’s Hall, and singled me out
from the audience Her reading was very brief;
she told me a man was standing before me offering
a beautiful purple and silver thistle
In the secretary’s room afterwards I asked for an
interpretation
“Do you know what the thistle m e a n s s h e
asked
“ I know it’s covered with prickles,” I laughed, “so
it’s probably a warning of some sort ”
“ No, I don’t read it like that,” was her answer,
and went on to say that I should receive an offer from
a Scotsman I was to be sure to accept She had said
no more at the time as of course I was personally
187
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
known to her and she had not wished to take up the
time from the audience m the hall
Within a few months I received an offer through
the agency of Mr Walter Maxwell, whose acquain­
tance I had only recently made, there was the Scots­
man 1
— and as the result of that offer, after the pass­
ing of years, “ Lucio’s ” prophecy is to be fulfilled
and my novel “Tangled Evidence” to appear on the
screen very shortly
Moreover, there appeared in the Sunday Times
shortly afterwards, in answer to an assertion m a
previous issue, that the Order of the Thistle had
never been bestowed upon a commoner, a letter
from a correspondent to say this was incorrect, as
upon three occasions in the past the Order of the
Thistle had been bestowed upon a member of the
family of Maxwell, but that no other commoners
had ever received it
Call it coincidence if you will!—the arm of coin­
cidence seems to be— especially in the hands of
critics disposed to stretch it a little beyond what it
will bear—very elastic on occasion1 But three
instances in a single incident— the fulfilment of the
original prophecy, the nationality of the man who
brought the offer, and the emblem of the Thistle
and its significance with regard to the name of
Maxwell—seem to ask for a good deal of explaining
away1
The path of the psychical investigator is certainly
beset with thorns of a sort unknown in the realm of
legitimate science Evidence for super-normal
188
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
phenomena is the most elusive quantity possible, it
can so easily slip into the rut of the vicious circle
Give the psychometnst, for instance, an object
through which future events are contacted and the
objection will be that, unless in the immediate
future, the statement cannot be verified Should
the contact made concern the past, remote or other­
wise, something perhaps of prehistoric interest which
may be verified, it is then urged the medium may
have read about it in book or newspaper and that
it has its source in the subconscious mind, or if
anyone present knows the history of the object
submitted, thought-reading is brought to the fore
But in spite of the obstacles with which the road is
bestrewn, psychometry is becoming acknowledged
as an established art
In full-form materializations the difficulties are
greater still, no doubt on account ofthe strain on the
credibility of the newcomer, partly also because of
the elusive conditions that must of necessity prevail,
but mainly owing to our own abysmal ignorance
of the laws dominating a fourth dimensional world—
which is merely a way of speaking, as we do not
know what sort of world we may be attempting to
deal with
And here I reiterate what I have long suggested—
that m many ways we have added to those diffi­
culties with which such investigation bristles, by
turning down as fraudulent, mediums and pheno­
mena with the too-ready facility of which our
opponents accuse us m our acceptance of them.
189
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
By the inhibitions we continually evoke through
the traditional precautions against fraud, I believe
we prevent the very phenomena we wish to induce
A study of what I may call the “habits” of ecto­
plasm, within my own experience as well as that
recorded by others, seems to justify this conclusion
But tradition is difficult to discredit, and the precon­
ceived idea hard to break down, the processes of the
séance strike me at times to be more m the nature
of an established ritual rather than a likely road to
anything really beneficial
Theie is also a tendency m sitters to overlook or
pass over as negligible, incidents which bear the
hallmark of truth m so far as a normal explanation
of them seems to be impossible, and to “ bank” on
some item which is open to suspicion— in other
words, they overlook the good and pick out the bad ;
which as a basis for argument is quite as illogical
as the reverse1
On one or two occasions I have sat with the
mateiiahzing medium, Mrs Duncan I am aware of
the diveisity of opinion that exists with regard to her
mediumship and can only “speak of the good as I
have found it ” I have received through her very
good bits of evidence and I know a considerable
number of people who would say the same
The difference m voice and accent between Mrs
Duncan and her control “Albert” appears to me to
require a good deal of explaining away, and should
certainly give any critic pause before condemning
her offhand Mrs Duncan speaks unmistakably
190
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
•with the accent of her country; if her life depended
upon it I do not believe she could speak as “Albert”
speaks, because she is probably quite unaware of the
manner of her diction, nor could she change it even
if this were not so
“Albert” may now and then make grammatical
slips, as we know controls using another’s mentality
are apt to do, but m no circumstances that I have ever
heard of has he ever spoken remotely like his
medium
In my own experience I have seen “ Albert’s”
form fully-formed, tall and luminous, standing at
the entrance to the cabinet with his medium short
and dark by his side I am able personally to vouch
for the thoroughness of the examination beforehand,
and that she certainly had no extraneous objects on
her person when she went into the cabinet
The evidence I received myself through Mrs
Duncan’s mediumship was ofa different order, being
technically more on the mental side than the
physical, and though it is rather a long story, may
be of sufficient interest to record
During the visit to London of that very fine direct-
voice medium, Mrs Murphy Lydy in 1931, sittings
with her were held at the British College two or three
days a week for a period of thiee months, and
occasionally I joined the circle without giving pre­
vious notice
On one of these occasions a “ voice” was heard,
calling out very clearly the name of a famous
novelist, who had died a short time previously No
191
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
one claimed him as a friend though all heard the
name plainly, so after considerable hesitation I
said:
“Well, I knew the speaker when he was here on
earth, but so slightly that I don’t think he can
possibly wish to speak to me ”
“Yes *
” the voice answered at once, “it is Mrs de
Crespigny I want— ” but as is so often the case, in
the anxiety to get a message through, the voice
trailed off into an unintelligible whisper, the only
words we could catch soundmg like “kind offices.”
At that we had to leave it
I am on the committees of several benevolent
societies, and on my next visit to one of them the
secretary greeted me with the information that a near
relative of the wnter who had spoken had applied
for a small grant ofmoney She had been dependent
on an allowance from the writer which, owing to
circumstances, had ceased at his death, and the
request was urgently made as she was m need of
help to tide her over a difficult time The request
beingjustifiable was acceded to, and beyond wonder­
ing whether m saying the words “Lind offices” the
communicator had been trying to right a wrong
done here, from the other world, I thought no more
about it
Some weeks later through the Rcflectograph group
there was a sequel to the episode.
Before starting the séance, Mr Kirkby placed
paper and pencil on the floor of the cabinet in case
any spmt communicator might prefer to write a
192
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
message. On this occasion, after the sitting, the
paper was produced; upon it was written very
clearly the Christian name of the novelist who had
spoken at the Murphy Lydy sitting, with the first
syllable only of his surname He had apparently
been unable to finish it, but so far as it went it was
quite clear and unmistakable, and definitely recog­
nized later as being his handwriting by Mr Hannen
Swaffer, who had known him intimately
This was airesting, as for several reasons I had not
spoken of my previous experience, and the Reflecto-
graph group could have known nothing of it I
attributed this second effort on the part of the
deceased author to be due to a wish to say a word of
gratitude for what had been done through the
benevolent society, and again gave the incident no
further thought
And then I sat at a séance with Mrs Duncan
It was at the house of Mrs Hirst, the well-known
trance medium, and several figures materialized and
spoke to friends, none of whom were for me
But “Albert,” the control, brought me a message.
“There is a man here,” he said, and gave the sur­
name of the writer who had spoken at the Murphy
Lydy séance and wntten lus name through the
Reflectograph group. “He is not able to materialize
but he wishes me to give a message to this lady,”
indicating me “He wants to thank her for what she
did for his relative, and was pleased it went through
without any disagreement or disputation.”
Though no one else understood it, the message
193
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
was of course perfectly intelligible to me, although
no one could have been more surprised than myself
to receive it, for the whole affair had passed entirely
from my mind
Here we have the same communicator coming
through the different mediums, each of them un­
aware of any previous communication, the last of
three messages being delivered through Mrs Dun­
can’s control “Albert” in a form perfectly intelligible
to me, bearing on what had gone before, and audible
to everyone present m the room
Far be it from me to say that, m momentswhen the
power flags, mediums may not fall to the temptation
to “fake” m order to produce what is expected of
them, but I do maintain that a large percentage of
so-called “ exposures” are no exposures at all, but
brought about by the ignorance of super-physical
laws from which all of us m a three dimensional
world must necessarily suffer, and owing also to this
ignorance, I believe some of the conditions imposed
at “test” séances m themselves frustrate the very
means through which we hope to obtain results
For instance, we learn two important facts with
regard to ectoplasm from a study of Dr Crawford’s
experiments with the Goligher circle—that it travels
very near the surface of the body, and that for
materializing purposes the ectoplasm must be drawn
from the neighbourhood of the limb or part which
it is expected to reproduce That the substance we
call ectoplasm must m fact be trained, or impressed
with certain tendencies
194
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Professor Durker made some expenments in
Germany that incidentally bear upon this subject
He cut off the tip of the tail of a newt and grafted
it on to the shoulder The section of the tail so
grafted throve and grew, but it did not produce
another tail, but another fore-limb, showing that it
followed the engrained tendencies and charac­
teristics of the cytoplasm upon which it had fed
It would seem that ectoplasm follows the same law.
Speaking generally, and I am sure investigators of
experience will agree, if for a materialization a hand
should be required, the necessary ectoplasm will be
drawn by the unseen operators from the neighbour­
hood of the medium’s hand, if a foot, from near feet
and ankles, if a voice, from the throat and larynx
When sitting with a direct-voice medium, I as a
sitter only— and we know the sitters also contribute—
am hoarse as a crow afterwards, indicating that to a
certain extent my throat has been drawn upon
Mrs Etta Wriedt told me she once sat with a circle
of deaf-mutes; no voice nor sound was heard, but
directly they were joined by a person whose faculties
were normal, the voices came through as usual
I have wondered sometimes whether, following
these lines, the materialization of the little negress at
the Reflectograph sittings was in any way con­
nected with the presence of a coloured gentleman
who was often among the regular sitters
My introductory sitting, m company with others,
with Mr. Kirkby and Mrs Singleton was not
successful, and looking back at the conditions and
195
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
following up these suggestions with regard to
“ exposures” I feel certain the failure should not be
laid at their door
The medium, Mrs Singleton, was placed m the
cabinet, with her hands pushed through holes m each
side of it and held respectively by two sitters—the
hands— nota bene—from which the ectoplasm was
presumably to be drawn for the materialization that
was to manipulate the keyboard in front ofher
Nothing happened—and the demonstration was
turned down by the critics, but I suspect the failure
was due to the inhibitive precautions taken against
fraud, the rigid control of the hands preventing the
very phenomenon we were hoping to produce
Dr Crawford tried some experiments with carmine
powder, which he placed in the boots ofthe medium
At the close of the sitting the track of the ectoplasm,
which had apparently caught up the powder m its
return passage, was plainly visible through the skin
of ankles and legs, showing how near the surface it
travelled How often, I wonder, m the rigid tying
up of mediums in the séance-room do we interfere
with the free passage of this super-delicate substance
and spike our own guns?
Other forms of so-called “exposures” may also be
founded m misconception, owing to ignorance of
psychic law—and probably are Why should articles
found on the floor, as we know sometimes to be the
case, at the close of a séance brought to an un­
expected close, be necessarily a proof of fraud? If it
be so, it would be m the first place a proof of the
196
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
unreliability of those who examined the medium
beforehand
There is a general impression, to put it colloquially,
that at a materializing séance the figures seen are
“ made of” ectoplasm, and nothing but ectoplasm
But m its finer forms— I would suggest its purer
form— ectoplasm is not visible to the physical eye
The very term “materialization” suggests that what
the sitters really see and touch is ectoplasm plus
matter By the time it comes within the range of our
normal physical vision it is no longer pure ecto­
plasm The matter for flesh and bone would doubt­
less be drawn from the body of the medium, the
diminution m size and weight recorded in well-
known instances would indicate so much ; the matter
required for draperies would be taken from anything
conveniently placed, such as curtain, handkerchief,
table-cover and so on of a similar nature to the ob­
jects to be reproduced— be it cotton or silk or wool
At the end of the séance, the draperies are de-
matenalized, the substance of the flesh and bone
returning with the ectoplasm to the medium’s body
But should the séance for any reason be brought to
an untimely end and not enough time for the final
“clean up” or necessary process of de-materializa-
tion to be effected, a residuum of physical matter
might naturally be found on the floor, and the
medium is promptly denounced as a fraud
A careful study of the story of the mediumship of
Madame d’Espérance, one of the finest materializing
mediums of the past, can teach us something in this
197
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
direction Her memoirs are written under the title
of “ Shadow-Land,” and as she was a well-educated
woman, the record ofher work is written with clarity
and intelligence The description given of the de-
matenalization of her control “Yolande” at the end
of a séance is worth quoting
“ The de-materializationofYolande’sbody occupies
from two to five minutes, while the disappearance
of the drapery occupies from a half to two minutes
On one occasion, however, she did not de-matenalize
this drapery or veil, but left the whole lying on the
carpet m a heap, until another spirit came out of the
cabinet to look at it as if moralizing on poor
Yolande’s disappearance This taller spirit also dis­
appeared and was replaced by the little, brisk,
vivacious child-form of Nmia, who likewise came to
look at Yolande’s remains, and curiously picking up
the left-off garments, proceeded to wrap them round
her own little body ”
Madame d’Espérance’s sittings were conducted m
daylight, the light being allowed m through the
upper part of the windows, at night an arrangement
of gas-jets illuminated the room Inside the cur­
tained cabinet it was dark
An instance of the failure to de-matenahze is given
at some length. The materialized object, placed m
full view of the sitters, was a tall, white lily about
seven feet high, with eleven fine blossoms hanging
from the stem, some fully blown, some m bud and
damp with dew The scent ofit, the account tells us,
was almost overpowering
198
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
“ Yolande” being very pleased with her success,
said if they wanted to photograph it, it must be done
at once as she had pi omised to return it The photo­
graph was taken by means of a magnesium flashlight,
and shows a very fine specimen of an auratum lily m
full bloom
But unfortunately, at this point, the power was
found to be waning, and after a sitting prolonged
until midnight, “Yolande” told them despairingly
she could do nothing more, and the plant remained.
A message from the unseen operators was then
received to the effect that “ ‘Yolande5 only got the
plant on condition she brought it back She finds the
medium is exhausted and cannot bear any more
You must let the plant remain m darkness till she can
come again and fetch it ” —Which, after photogiaph-
ing it from several angles, they did, and at a séance
a week later, after being placed m the centre of the
circle, it “vanished as mysteriously as it had come ”
Possibly this should be classified as an “ apport”
rather than a true example of how physical matter
may be left m the séance-room owing to unfavourable
conditions, without necessarily being an indication
offraud— a remark I address not to the inexperienced
sceptic who in his ignorance would no doubt attri­
bute the whole incident to fraud from beginning to
end, but to the experienced and earnest investigator
who knows that these things can be, and who is
seeking with the rest ofus foi reasonable explanations
of some of the baffling problems with which we are
from time to time confronted
199
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
In this subject we are always grateful for comic
relief— and we certainly get i t 1
A. visitor came into the College one day not long
ago and said she wished to get into touch with her
husband
“ If I was sure it was him, I’d give him a bit of my
mind— it ’nd be well worth the money But I don’t
want to throw it away on somebody who isn’t ”
“ Isn’t w h a t I asked mildly
“ Isn’t him,” she snapped
“ Perhaps he wouldn’t come,” I suggested, “he
needn’t, yon know, if he doesn’t want to ”
“ If he don’t come when I call him he’s changed a
bit more than the spiritualists make out,” was the
grim reply, and not being m a position to offer an
opinion I held my tongue
200
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
B
EFORE passing on to the subject of mental
mediumship, it might be worth mentioning an
incident at a sitting held some time ago at the British
College, m its old premises.
Sloan was the medium, already well-known for his
work m “direct voice,” when Mr Arthur Findlay m
his wonderfully popular book, “ On the Edge of the
Etheric,” brought him into special prominence.
Probably no book written on popular lines has had a
greater success or sown richer seed over so wide-
spreading an area than this work
At the sitting, which took place m the dark, the
medium offered to let me feel ectoplasm if I would
put out my hand. I did so and immediately was
conscious of a most unpleasant sensation. My hand
became coated with a cold, slimy substance; cob­
webs made of silk came into my mind as a simile,
but there was also a slippery quality about the feel
of it that I found most disagreeable Shake and rub
my hand as I might there was no result, the stuff
stuck fast, and m the end I had to wait patiently until
it dissolved and left my fingers free again I have
never wished to renew my acquaintance with ecto­
plasm at such close quarters1
To deal m detail with all the physical mediums of
201 H
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
whose work m convincing a doubting humanity of
worlds beyond their own I have had personal ex­
perience, would be a lengthy task, and m some ways
superfluous, as so many of them and the good they
have done have been brought before the public m
other ways A series of demonstrations that brought
me into contact with the phenomenon of “apports”
and furnished wonderful evidence ofthe operation of
super-normal law were obtained through a medium
from the north called Lynn He gave remarkable
demonstrations of the passing of matter through
matter, and the sudden appearance of objects from a
distance, upon a table m full view ofus, in a good red
light and m such close proximity to the sitters that
the most meticulous observation of the phenomenon
was possible.
Photographs of these manifestations of “apport”
phenomena were made by flashlight by Major
Mowbray, research officer at the College at the time;
they show the various objects while held m suspen­
sion, gripped by the rod of ectoplasm immediately
before they were deposited on the table At the end
of the rod, which appears to come from the solar
plexus of the medium, something m the nature of
a fist is gripping the object before finally releasing
it
As the sitters gather closely round the table m a
good red hght, the fact that neither the object m
suspension nor the ectoplasmic surround is visible,
is a good example of the greater sensitivity of
the photographic plate to that of the physical eye,
202
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
the camera, in fact, can see what we are unable to
perceive
The photographs are very fine, the work of an
expert, and are always on view at the College for the
benefit of those especially interested
The door to the “beyond” having been opened to
me through the more sensational because more direct
agency of the “direct voice,” it was some time before
I fully appreciated the more delicate varieties of
phenomena to be obtained through trance medium-
ship But although the value and beauty of mind
speaking to mind through the agency of trance
mediumship have now become very real to me, the
wonder of those first experiences m direct voice will
never cease to arouse in my mind an awe and rever­
ence for the marvels worked through God’s laws that
nothing else can ever quite equal
The telephone that links us with far countries
through the world of sound is marvel enough 1 But
the realization— which must come and does to the
patient investigator— that the next world and those
m it are separated from our own by one throb of the
ether to which we have found a means of tuning m,
can never fail to thrill any mind to whom science and
its miracles are more than a mere word
At the same time, m trance mediumship we find
ourselves m conditions that take us a step farther
from earth and the material aspect of the universe;
the processes and results bemg of a mental quality,
originating on the mental plane, and due to opera­
tions beyond the realm of ectoplasm
203
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Here, except presumably for the necessary use of
the grey matter of the brain as an instrument, those
on the other side work through mind rather than
matter, the “ tuning m” being between mind and
mind, and when it is remembered the transfer of a
message is made from fourth dimensional conditions
to three dimensional, from a fourth dimensional
brain to a brain limited to three dimensions, it is not
the baffling mistakes and inaccuracies of the mes­
sages that sometimes occur that should be empha­
sized , the marvel is that we get anything at all!
It is natural that the clairvoyant should not always
repeat accurately incidents and appearances from the
other side We make similar mistakes m this world
with which we are familiar It is probably more often
due to misinterpretation of the things seen and heard
that mistakes are made The average medium knows
nothing of the laws appertaining to this plane—much
less those of any other1
Imagine a denizen of a world fundamentally dif­
ferent from our own suddenly finding himself on
earth with no knowledge of the laws of reflection
Believing the story told him by the mirror, he might
well carry away the conviction, through the evidence
of his sense of sight, of six persons m a room where
there had been only three, or not understanding the
tricks of refraction, would swear to the bending off
at a considerable angle of a stout piece of wood such
as an oar, on penetrating the surface of water In
both instances he would be speaking the truth ac­
cording to his hghts; it would be a misinterpretation
204
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
of the situation owing to his ignorance of physical
law
The same argument may be applied to the deduc­
tions of the clairvoyant Either the consciousness of
the medium goes exploring in countries of whose
laws he has no knowledge, returmng to pass on con­
clusions possibly drawn from erroneous premises; or
m the passage of the message from the higher dimen­
sion into the lower, a certain degree ofrefraction may
ensue, with the result that it arrives with us m not
exactly the form m which it started
One might remark parenthetically that such cases
are not unknown in ordinary earth life, but refraction
is not the term generally applied to them1
This possibility of a twist, or distortion, should be
taken into careful consideration when weighing
evidence
In trance mediumship Mrs Osborn Leonard and
her control “ Feda” will always stand out as shining
lights; they have won a name for themselves that
makes any mention of them in these pages super­
fluous, beyond the expression of my sincere admira­
tion for the woik they have done for humanity I
have not personally had a great many sittings with
Mrs Leonard, as, having already obtained the
evidence I desired, it seemed wiser to leave an in­
strument so widely sought after for those who have
not But the few sittings I have enjoyed will always
be among my most cherished memories
The proofs, not only of survival, but of a world of
superior intelligences to our own received through
205
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
trance mediumship, are so abundant that it is not
easy to winnow the grain of what may be of interest
to others from the chaif that will not Friends in­
numerable have come through to me and estabhshed
their identity m many ways, for the most part
through some little trivial thing that would appear
negligible to the outside world, but that goes right
home to those who understand I have heard of a
man who, after many vain attempts, became at last
convinced of his wife’s identity because the medium
told him she was holding out half an orange, of an­
other who could only persuade a friend on this side
he was the person he claimed to be by reminding
her of an occasion upon which he upset a cup of
coffee over her dress1 It is the small detail that brmgs
conviction rather than the big things in life, and this
was borne m on me not long ago when a brother who
had lately passed over came to me through the trance
mediumship of Mrs Hirst
He had never taken any interest m what he
irreverently called “spooks” — a favourite appella­
tion by those who do not beheve m them, but he
had been eminently broad minded, and was evidently
ready to change his mind once he was on the other
side, for he communicated with me much more
quickly than is usual “ Rosie,” Mrs Hirst’s control,
gave a very accurate description of him as a “ man of
the sea,” of very fine character and likely to be a
force in his new conditions; also that he had held
some public position, not of the sea, in the later
years of his life He was a Gentleman Usher at
206
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Buckingham Palace for many years before his
death
She then began to spell out what I took to be his
initials, letter by letter His full name was Edmund
Moore Cooper Key “Rosie,” with great assurance,
said he was giving her a big E and an M, which I
acknowledged as the first letters of Edmund Moore
But when she followed them up with a D , ex­
pecting C K., I shook my head She stuck to it So
did I. I thought of names beginning with D and
rejected them all Finally “Rosie” gave it up and we
left it
It is possible to be indescribably “ thick-headed” m
the séance-room The bram at times seems to get set
m a certain direction and nothing will deflect it
I had initials fixed in mine and initials were all I
looked for.
Some time after the sitting on re-reading the notes
taken at the time, I found EMD staring me m the
face— the unusual abbreviation of Edmund by which
my brother had invariably been known to all his
relations all his life •
At my next sitting with the same medium he came
again and announced his presence with a most
characteristic remark
“ I was so relieved,” he said, “to find I wasn’t an
angel1 I am still a man with my own individuality
There was a further detail at this séance for which
the subconscious mind must be held guiltless
“Rosie” described the house in which my brother
lived,
207
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
“ I see a window with little panes—you know—
tiny panes ofglass like a pattern ”
I negatived this The windows in the house were
of ordinary plate-glass “Rosie,” however, stuck to
it
“ I see that,” she said
The next time I saw my sister-in-law, without any
preamble I asked her if I was not right m thinking
the windows oftheir house were all ofordinary plate-
glass She immediately answered m the affirmative,
and before I had time to wonder what “ Rosie” had
meant, added• “Except the window in E M D ’s
dressing-room, which had little leaded panes across
the upper half ”
I had never been into his dressing-room and had
never seen the wmdow
It is m trifles such as this, once more, I emphasize,
that we find the best evidence, and become weary of
the reiterated stricture on the part of the critics that
nothing but triviality is obtained through commun­
ication with the other world. Every experienced in­
vestigator will testify to the contrary, and there are
thousands of books in the psychic libraries to the
same effect, but the weed still thrives
I was once waiting m a car outside a house m a
street where another car with a woman m it, also
waiting, was drawn up to the pavementjust beyond.
Presently a man came out of a house, apparently
an acquaintance, and crossing the pavement to the
occupant of the other car, started a conversation.
“ So you have come back *
”
208
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
She agreed to this self-evident fact, and he went
on:
“A lovely day— isn’t it?”
“ Very fine,” she replied, “ a much better day than
yesterday ”
“But it was touch and go this morning Quite a
fog where we are ”
“ I thought it was going to be foggy too— but the
sun came out ”
He— sapiently “Yes— the sun came out and ate up
the fog It often does, I’ve noticed, this time of year
Well— good morning1”
Would those two, I thought to myself, were they to
meet in the stance-room, one on one side of the veil
and one on the other, refuse to recognize each other
owing to the trivialities of their conversation >
* Why
should people accustomed to such a style of inter­
course m this world be expected to talk high philo­
sophy directly they arrive m the next?
But for those who wish to arrive at something more
illuminative than personal communication is likely
to produce, there are teachers and instructors in
abundance ready to help, as can be learnt by anyone
sufficiently m earnest to study the literature
May I also remind such critics that the outstanding
aim and goal of spiritualism is to prove Survival;
and that is only to be accomplished through the
agency of those who have survived and are there­
fore m a position to speak with certainty Philosophy,
ethics, science can be tapped through other channels;
but in the estabhshment of the survival of man’s
209
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
personality as a fact not a speculation—valuable as
emergent side-issues may be and are—is the core of
the message of spiritualism to the world
Mrs Barkel’s control, “White Hawk” is a great
personality, and has given me many a message which
bore the stamp of truth from my “ship-man,” as he
calls my husband His chorthng laugh is one of the
most infectious things I know, and I have had an
“ apport” through his agency passed through my
tightly clenched fist
The variety m characteristic and temperament
shown by the different controls, each true to
nationality and mentality, quite independently of
whether the medium be British-born or not, is a point
worthy of consideration “ Maisie,” the httle Zulu
girl who is Mrs Mason’s control, answered in Zulu
on one occasion when a sitter who was familiar with
South Africa said good-bye to her in that language—
a language of which, it is almost needless to say, Mrs.
Mason is entirely ignorant
In fact, the list of these wonderful gateways to the
world beyond is long and growing longer, and still
not nearly long enough to supply the ever-increasing
demands of a world waking up to the possibilities
within it
“ Lucio,” known and beloved by all who know
Miss Francis, gave us an account of his early life;
of how he had been Prior of a monastery which he
named, and from which he had been expelled owing
to some attempted reforms which had brought him
into disfavour. Every detail was afterwards verified.
210
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
I asked him on one occasion why it was ordained that
he should remain so near to earth when he had
presumably led a holy life
“When I was m the monastery,” he replied, “ there
were many instances of clairvoyance and clair-
audience among the brothers We welcomed it as a
gift from God But when instances of either gift
were brought to us from outside, we said it was from
the Devil and would have nothing to do with it
“ Now I have to remain m touch with earth and
give back so far as I am able the light I kept from it
during my life among men ”
The old cry of service— of forgetfulness of self m
the desire to serve others Is any plane too low for
the application of this divine decree? He that
would save his soul shall lose it 1 Better far to be con­
cerned with the saving of the souls of others
Sir Oliver Lodge m “ My Philosophy,” p 292,
touches on this aspect of hfe hereafter
“ Religious people seem to think that we are
transported or transmuted into a totally different
kind of existence far beyond mortal ken, from which
we can make no sign to survivors They assume that
we have lost interest m one another, that we are
absorbed m higher things, and hope that those left
behind will not disturb us or make any attempt at
interrupting us m our new rôle of continuous
religious exercises and constant adoration ”
211
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
IN no other form of mediumship has there been
such marked advance during late years as m
“platform clairvoyance,” the only term that really
describes it
So far as I know there is no indication of the
practice of this very remarkable manifestation of
psychic power during the last century, nor even in
the early years of this It is noticeable not only as a
new development in method, but as a distinct step
upward on-the ladder between this world and the
"liex'f
This would apply equally to any form of normal
clairvoyance, that is to say, where the medium does
not go into trance, and thereby qualify as a channel
only for others to use The clairvoyance and clair-
audience necessary for public demonstrations on the
platform, signifies an unfoldment of the medium’s
inner senses which makes possible a conscious func­
tioning on a plane of superior dimension In other
words it is the difference between bringing the
denizens of those planes down to our level, and
acquiring the power to rise to theirs According to
their own statements, the former process, although
doing them no harm from an evolutionary point of
view, does us no good, whereas m the development
212
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
of our own latent powers for functioning on higher
levels, we are ourselves taking a step forward on the
path toward final perfection
I have seen a good deal ofclairvoyance given from
the platform, m large and small gatherings, and
never ceased to be amazed at the magic of it *
To watch the medium select from an audience
numbermg anything, from a handful up to six or
seven thousand, some utter stranger— the selection
being frequently ofpersons with whom I have known
collusion to have been impossible— and tell them, in
the words of the woman of Samaria, all things that
ever they did, with names and surnames, appropriate
to their families, and recognized, is an experience
that never loses the keen edge ofits power to impress
I have been present at the Albert Hall where Mrs
Estelle Roberts gives such remarkable evidence of
her gifts, and at the Queen’s Hall and elsewheie,
when thiough clairvoyance, or more often clair-
audience fromthe platform, menor women have been
rescued from disaster through some message sent by
friend or relative m the nick of time—messages
sometimes of so private a nature that the medium
refuses to deliver them m public and sees the
recipient privately after the meeting is over; the
identity ofthe communicator being established some­
times m a swift flash of recognition, sometimes after
long and patient inquiry with the medium as
intermediary
If the devil is at the back of these manifestations
as we are so often told, he is either doing his work
213
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
very badly, or he is not nearly so black as he’s
painted1
Mrs Estelle Roberts has won a world-wide
reputation through her platform work, and must
have brought the little bit of personal experience
that brings conviction home to literally thousands of
souls searching for the truth The exhibition of her
gifts m this direction at the Armistice Sunday Ser­
vice of Reunion held yearly at the Albeit Hall under
the auspices of the Marylebone Association, shows
under what difficult conditions she is able to work
To experience any novelty m the way of a “ thrill”
seems to be the main object to-day of the rismg—
and risen—generations, the most wonderful thrill
of them all is there, under their noses for the seeking,
but the majority turn their backs on it Little or no
notice is taken of it by the press, who prefer to con­
centrate on the overworked thrill of a sensational
crime case in the search for a “story” which, at this
period of history, reiteration has robbed of any
novelty at all1
In Mr Arthur Ford, who visits us now and again
from America, we can study the art of platform
clairaudience m excelsis I have seen him give
“readings” to members of strange audiences in this
country, startling in their accuracy, and revelation
of both past and future He raiely seems to make a
mistake, and displays a knowledge of family history
and names that, as m the case of Mis Roberts, is
absolutely bewildering to the newcomer, who finds it
difficult to get beyond the idea of a conjuring trick l
214
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
There are many otheis, too numerous to mention,
who are working week m and week out including
Sundays, often their busiest day, to bring this
inestimable message to humanity They may be
paid for it, and should be, I for one, say thank God
for paid mediums who may be approached m a
business fashion1 How far would this knowledge
have spread if every sitting had to be begged for as a
personal favour? And from the other pomt of view,
why should we expect to get something for nothing—
not to mention so great a boon? We have to pay for
it if we wish to telephone to Paris Why not if we
wish to telephone to Heaven'1
For there is nothing necessarily spiritual about
communicating with friends, to think so is to confuse
the spiritual with the merely psychic For truly
spiritual contacts there is no price—nor could be
Direct intercourse between man and his Maker is
his natural heritage, his inalienable right For
neither prayer nor praise is the intervention of any
third person necessary In the silence, m the market­
place, m the temple, be the form of it what it may,
the spirit of God incarnate in man is free to make
contact with the Source whence it came
But when we take advantage of the gifts of the
medium, developed and fostered with care and self-
denial, the reward should surely be given un­
grudgingly This knowledge of Survival and the
opportunity to talk with those who have gone before
is surely the Pearl of great price for which all lesser
pearls must be sacrificed if necessary
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
I have had personally several messages from the
platform, bringing me advice or reassurance, and
as I am generally known by sight to the medium
there is always some little touch given as intro­
duction to establish the bona fides of the message to
follow
I remember an occasion at the Queen’s Hall,
when it was evidently desired to get a rather urgent
message through to me, my father was first described
as standing behind me, m an audience of a thousand
people or more His naval uniform and orders were
accurately given, and finally the medium added,
“and some funny gold things on his breast which I
don’t understand,” but that I recognized as the gold
lace atgmlletteshe wore as Principal A D C to Queen
Victoria, and very distinctive evidence as regards
his identity
There was no pre-knowledge on the part of the
medium as she did not know I should be among the
audience, and if from among the thousand men­
talities surging around me she could disentangle my
‘thoughts” and present me with a clear-cut descrip­
tion of something about which I was not thinking,
Santa Claus coming down the chimney at Chiistmas
would be comparatively easy to swallow!
It is simpler to accept the explanation that she
saw, clairvoyantly, a vision of my father.
Trance-address is a form of psychic demonstration
that, at its best, should be a channel for good and for
the further enlightenment of humanity groping in a
fog, on the other hand, at its worst, or even second
216
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
best, it appears to be the tiresome self-exploitation
of some self-centred, would-be orator m the other
world, who, failing to induce anyone to listen to him
m that sphere, dumps his pious platitudes and tedious
exhortations on long-suffering audiences m this,
who are often disposed to receive anything from the
next stage of existence as jewels of wisdom and
learning, and who do not realize that when it comes
to science or philosophy their particular form of
education may not have qualified them to judge as
to whcthei they are listening to anything of value
or not1
Personally, I have learnt just enough of both
subjects to know I know nothing at all, and I should
hesitate to pass any opinion adverse or the contrary
on the alleged science or philosophy given to us
from “beyond” without the confirmation of wiser
minds than my own
Something must of course be attributed to the
inadequacy of the instrument, not always to a
paucity of ideas at the source, and those who have
listened to trance-addi esses from “ Red Cloud,”
Mrs. Barkers control “ White Hawk,” “White
Eagle,” “ Chang,” the wise and philosophic guide of
Philip Shaiplm m his trance-healing— and there are
many others of whom if no mention is made here,
it is only that I have had no personal experience of
their work—know that much that is instructive,
illuminating and, above all, suggestive, can be
received through such sources It may be that in
some cases the speakers temper the quality of their
217 '5
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
subject matter to the mentalities with which they
have to deal and, to paraphrase an old saying, it
takes all sorts of mentalities to make a world
The control m trance-speaking of whom I have
had the fullest experience and of whom I am there­
fore in a position to say most, is the famous “ Power”
who, strictly preserving his anonymity, delivers his
addresses through the mediumship of Mrs Meung
Moms. She is well-known, not only on account
of her psychic gifts, but for her brave stand m a hbel
case that at the time it took place aroused the
interest of every country m the civilized world, to
judge by the leading articles m the newspapers m
every language
As a tribute worth recoidmg m evidence of the
importance of a case which some critics— even those
who are sympathetic— at the time averred should
never have been brought, I quote at some length
from the Law Journal of April 23rd, 1932
“ Outlaw,” referring to cases in the Royal Courts of
Justice in the Strand proceeding at the time, re­
marked especially on the case in Court IV, as deal­
ing with a “ medium”
“ It is not so very long since the plaintiff, appear­
ing with full legal rights and recognition of the same,
and represented by counsel ofsuch eminent respecta­
bility as the Serjeant and Mr Constantine Gallop,
would have incurred grave risk, under the law then
m force, of being burned as a witch Now, because
of certain words used of and concerning her and
m connexion with her vocation or practice of trans-
21S
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
imttmg messages from the other world, she sued for
damages for libel, and received a patient, careful
and judicial hearing of her case before Mr Justice
McCardie, and a jury Beyond all doubt this is a
notable event, and, quite irrespective of the verdict
marked a tremendous advance, not only m spiritual­
ism but m toleration ”
and under the heading of Spiritualism and Justice he
continues
“ Lest I should offend, let it be said that I pretend
not to know whether spiritualism is true or false or
whether the belief m it is good or evil but from the
legal point of view that trial was one of remarkable
interest, not only by reason of the eminence and
respectability of so many of the witnesses called for
the plaintiff, but by reason of the admission that
a spiritualistic medium might be defamed by woids
used of her m connexion with her profession and
might lawfully claim damages m respect thereof
“Another curious fact appearing fiom the tual
and m the course of it is that the jury might be ex­
pected to find that a ‘discarnatc spirit’ might tians-
mit messages through a medium; or at the least
that such a belief might honestly be held by intelli­
gent and reasonable men ”
To have afforded an opportunity of impressing
upon the legal mind the reasonableness not only of
the claims of a medium and of the whole standpoint
of spiritualism, but also of enforcing serious attention
to the subject all over the globe, is m itself sufficient
justification for having carried the fight through the
219
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
King’s Bench Court to the bitter end in the House of
Lords
The poster proclaiming “ Medium found out” was
widely exhibited, and it was upon the implication
of those words that Mrs Morns based her claim.
Well might Sir Henry McCardie open proceedings
the like ofwhich had never before been held in those
precincts with the lemark, delivered with much
emphasis, that m the ensuing discussion the riddles
oflife and ofdeath would occupy the attention ofthe
Court; an introduction that immediately raised the
whole situation from the sordid suggestion of com­
mon fraud to the greater question—was Mrs Morris
justified in her claim to be controlled by a discamate
spint, or was she not-*
No wonder the legal luminaries did not quite
know where they were!
There was so much to be explained— so difficult
of explanation! Such niceties as the differences
between body and consciousness, between physical
and mental mediumship—a hopeless snag this to the
very end— between the promptings of the subcon­
scious mind and the independent control of a dis-
carnate entity; all fresh food and difficult ofassimila­
tion by minds generally concerned with pounds,
shillings and pence, disputes over property or other
entirely material considerations To the end there
must have been many who when the final dramatic
scene took place had little idea of what was actually
happemng. The bewilderment evident m some ofthe
newspaper reports told us that much
220
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Even “ Power’s” final cry when he was forced to
resign control “Do not touch me until I have left
this body>
” must have fallen on stony ground The
human body viewed as a mere vehicle “ run” by an
alien consciousness taking temporary control was a
situation inconceivable to minds to whom it was
presented for the first time, especially m such
uninspiring surroundings as the Law Courts; which
makes it all the more remarkable that the jury
should have decided that Mrs Moms was what she
professed to be
The story of the “ vision” as recounted by the
press at the time, gave a false impression of what
actually took place
At one moment while in the witness-box Mrs
Moms appeared to be going under control; so much
so that from those present who understood there was
a general cry of “ Don’t touch her•” m which Mr
Justice McCardie himself joined
But she reached semi-trance only, and as she
returned to full consciousness, murmured m a half-
dazed manner “ It is Chnst ■” After a pause, the
apology to the Judge for the interruption was given;
not all in one flippant sentence, as was indicated
by the newspapers.
She said subsequently she had seen a shining
figure standing by her side and a voice had said
clearly • “Those that are with you are greater than
those that arc against you
Throughout the trial, during which I had the
privilege of sitting at the lawyers’ table, and was
221
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
therefore in full view of the Judge at fairly close
quarters, I was continually impressed by a suspicion
that Mr Justice McCardie understood a great deal
more of occult matters than he was inclined to
admit, not only from the direction m which some of
his observations tended, but from personal experience
when I was m the witness-box On one occasion in
particular when the defendants’ counsel, Mr
Birkett—the most courteous of cross-examiners—
asked me if I could tell him anything about the
pineal gland, which had been mentioned m the
course of one of “ Power’s” discourses
I did what I could—told him where it was situated
m the skull, that he would find an explanation of it
in the dictionary; that some people considered it the
vestigial remains of a third eye; and finally, that any
doctor could tell him more about it than I could, as
it was a physiological fact
Here I stopped short, although I could have said
more, and Mr Justice McCardie, leaning forward
from his seat, said gently
“ — and more than that, Mrs de Crespigny?— more
than that?” and I replied “Yes, my lord— and more
than that *
”
He knew, as I knew, of the particular occult sig­
nificance attached to the pineal gland, and that it
would have served no purpose to lay it before the
majority of the good souls and true that sat in the
jury box
Since the Judge’s death he has spoken to me
through the mediumship of Mr Gerald de Beaure-
222
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
pane He referred to my knowledge throughout the
trial that he had not been so ignorant as he professed
to be, mentioning it through the medium as a
guarantee ofhis identity
It has been suggested even by some ofhis adherents
that “ Power” was ill-advised in his interruption of
the Judge’s summing-up
From this criticism I differ entirely To begin
with, is it not conceivable that with his wider range
of vision and greater knowledge he was m a position
to know best? The dramatic demonstration was, m
my opimon, timed to a nicety, delivered at the end
of the summing-up— when the effect of it was m no
way modified by further antipathetic remarks from
the Judge, and the jury retired with the voice of
“ Power” still reverberating in their ears
No one present that afternoon could have denied
the force ofthat drama enacted m the Court *
As the Judge approached the final words of his
summing-up, I felt Mrs Morris, who had been
sitting by me, leaning against my shoulder, worn out,
limp, the tears streaming down hei face, suddenly
stiffen and become rigid
The tears ceased She rose to hei feet There was
a moment’s pause— a tension in the air.
Then “ Power’s” voice—if at that moment the
controlling force were “ Power”— rang out through
the Court, the strong clear tones filling the i oom to
the roof
“ Brother Judge— hearken unto my words----- !”
There was no doubt about the sensation it caused,
223
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
whatever attempts may have been made afterwards
to explain it away1
Startled bewilderment, dismay, astonishment,
every sort of emotion, showing alarm and perplexity,
was portrayed on the faces of all within my view,
from theJudge downwards, m the dramatic moment
that followed
But with a face white as the bands at his neck Mr
Justice McCardie ordered the ushers to remove the
medium from the Court, and I wonder how many
among the lawyers, the press and thejury understood
the meamng of that last cry from her “control” .
“Do not touch me until I have left this body!”
224
CHAPTER NINETEEN
HE injunction, however, was disregarded, and
for two hours after her removal Mrs Morris lay
unconscious, occasionally under control— sometimes
apparently a vagrant, casual control— that filled
those of us who understood the danger of a sudden
recall from trance, with fear that she might never
return It is sufficiently dangerous to awaken even
a sleep-walker1
Had it not been for the cloud of tragedy overhang­
ing the situation, it might well have figured as
comedy1 Having tried for a fortnight by every
sort of device to make the assembled company
understand exactly what occurred when “ Power”
controlled the medium, directly the jury were given
the opportunity to judge foi themselves she was
ordered out of court!
There was a great deal of talk about the “jargon”
of which “ Power” was accused; anything may be
consideredjargon by those who do not understand it.
We have heard of legal jargon, there may even be
some sense in that to those who under stand it ' The
extracts quoted from “ Power’s” sermons by the
defendant’s counsel were perfectly intelligible The
meaning of monism could have been found in the
dictionary, the “grades of ether” so contemptuously
225
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
referred to, is no new idea, the Rosicrucians have
always postulated four grades ofether, and Sir Oliver
Lodge in the witness-box denied that it was non­
sense
But m spite of all the serious testimony to the con­
trary “ Power’s” sermons were referred to as “jargon”
to the last1
I have perhaps over-emphasized the account of
this trial which made so great a sensation when it
took place, and made history m the story of Spiritua­
lism I have quoted to some extent from my own
record of it, published in the Psychic News at the
time, and written while events were fresh m my mind
But m my opinion the importance of this case to
Spiritualism, with its verdict, ridiculous m itself, but
entirely exonerating Mrs Meung Morns from the
accusation of fraud, cannot be over-emphasized It
made a definite step m the advance of Spiritualism,
and created an interest m the subject that many
years of the usual quiet plodding endeavour would
have failed to accomplish For a week, m law circles,
little else was talked of, the Lancet, m an article
headed “Medicine and the Law” testified to the
interest aroused among doctors, and should surely
have helped to persuade them that trance-medium-
ship and epilepsy are not synonymous terms1
To me, the entire episode was a never-to-be-for­
gotten bit of life I had a much-appreciated oppor­
tunity to learn more about the ways of the law and
the psychology of law courts that I could ever have
hoped for otherwise It was extraordinarily interest-
226
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
mg to watch the faces of the jury, some stolid, un­
responsive, determined to give nothing away some
reacting to every fresh suggestion on the part of
Judge or witness, all vitally interested m a drama
such as had never before been enacted within those
walls I learnt also to admire and respect a man who
was subjected to contumely, misrepresentation and,
on occasion, to the cheap wit of the disputants, and
who, by facing it all couiageously and willingly— in
his own words— paid m full for much m the past that
he regretted, and was honest enough to say so.
The jury were over four hours befoie delivering
their verdict, and when the curious terms of it are
taken into consideration the wonder is they arrived
at any decision at all' To acquit the medium of
fraud and then to say it was “ fair comment” to have
declared her to have been “ found out” is a difficult
proposition for the lay mind! The old ordeal of the
ducking stool for witches would not have been so long
drawn out and peihaps have left less indelible results
upon the victim
From the trial to the human aura may seem some­
thing of a jump, but in the course of my evidence m
the witness-box Mr Norman Birkett asked if I
beheved in auras, and I told him that at the moment
I could see his own1 In answer to a remark from
Serjeant Sullivan, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr.
Birkett turned to speak to him and on resuming his
cross-examination asked if I could still see his aura.
As his movement had altered the conditions I
said “ no,” whereupon he upbraided the Serjeant
227
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
with “There— that’s your fault1 If you hadn’t in­
terrupted, I should still have got my aura *
”— which
needless to say entertained me as much as the rest of
the Court1
But it was not what is commonly known as the
“aura” that I saw, an explanation that in its subtle­
ties would have been thrown away m thosesurround­
ings
It was the ethenc or Kilner aura that was visible to
me; as it may be visible to anyone with either par­
ticularly good physical sight, or the first beginning of
clairvoyance. The aura that Dr Kilner made
perceptible through certain screens is not the
coloured “astral” aura that varies with the different
moods and emotions, nor the mental, that reflects
mentality and intellectual effort, it is a radiation of
the human frame, having its source m the ethenc
body—that link or “transformer,” part physical, part
non-physical, that bridges the gulf between physical
and astral
Step by step, as science advances, the claims of the
seer are being gradually justified Even legend or
tradition, scoffed at for so long by the disciples of
“ common sense,” is proving that much regarded as
mere superstition has been built unconsciously on a
basis offundamental truth
The human aura or coloured radiance that sur­
rounds the form of man or woman, seen by the clair­
voyant and disbelieved m by those who could not
see it, can now claim at least consideration in the
light of present-day science There is a school of
223
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
philosophers, I believe, on the Continent who have
long admitted the existence of this aui ic emanation;
they called it anthropoflux R , which sounds learned
but seems to have come to much the same thing
The particular phenomenon of which I wish to
speak is the coloured aura pertaining to the psychic
or astral body and subject m appearance to every
change of mood and emotion, with a basic colour
denoting general temperament and the mental, so
closely associated with the astral that it seems dif­
ferentiated by the highest type of clairvoyant only,
and that registers the working of the mental and in­
tellectual processes
And to-day science is telling us that there can be
no centre of chemical change, no movement of
electrons from atom to atom without the creation of
a disturbed area m the sui rounding ether. Should
that ether be vibrating undei the influence of light­
waves, the waves generated and thrown out by a
centre of chemical change must modifty the move­
ment m the ether, and as every length of light-wave
in the spectrum has its own colour, a general change
and interchange ofcolour should be the result
Where there is no reaction from a brain, it may be
objected, there is no colour— coloui being, of course,
an impression only, conveyed by certain wave­
lengths to the bram It may be that the clairvoyant,
when functioning on a higher plane, may perceive
many colours we are unaware of, but that terms of
description lack by which they can be conveyed to
our three dimensional understanding; possibly, and
229
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
I think probably, the psychic himself cannot bring
the perception ofthem through to the physical plane.
But where there are known to be wave-lengths at
work, I suppose we may postulate, m certain con­
ditions, colour as a result
We can observe the process ofthis change ofcolour
as the result of chemical action for ourselves m the
physical world, by throwing salt on the fire, when the
result ofthe chemical changes caused mamfest them­
selves immediately m the colour of the flame
To carry on the argument, science also tells us
that the act of thinking generates heat, which would
seem to be following m the grooves of physical law,
for light has never yet been generated unaccom­
panied by heat in greater or lesser degree When it is
realized that the operation of thought actually
wastes, eats up the physical matter of the brain
tissues, matter which it is necessary to replace by food
before the exhaustive process of thinking can be con­
tinued or resumed, it is presumably not illogical to
suggest that the same natural law is at work as in the
processes of other parts of the body The chemical
changes presumably ensuing m both cases would
cause the inevitable disturbance m the surrounding
ether due to the movement of electrons, sending out­
wards waves varying m length— and therefore m
coloui could we perceive it— according to the degree
of mental or emotional activity exercised
The chemical disturbances in the brain resulting
from acute emotion such as rage, grief and so on, or
even the ordinary processes of thought, unceasing
230
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
during waking hours, can be imagined to result m the
kaleidoscopic changes m the aura—the “disturbed
area m the ether” of the scientist— observed and
recorded by the clairvoyant of all the ages, each
temperament, mood or emotion registering its own
particular colour on a plane of more subtle reactions,
visible only to that inner sense which either latent or
developed lies within every one ofus
And as the “ foreign bodies” m glass may mar the
perfection of its transparency, so our imperfections,
twists, distortions of character, may cause like im­
perfections m the aura, disharmonies bieakmg up
the perfect ray as though passing thiough a spectro­
scope and perceptible m the aura as all the colours of
the rainbow, still beautiful but broken up, each,
though a part of the perfect lay, incomplete m itself
In that key to many riddles ofthe umverse, the Bible,
there are references to this “rainbow” appearance
surrounding sometimes a form, sometimes a con­
course ofpeople, and the implication given is that the
perfect aura is of the ray complete— of puie white
light, as in the Transfiguration where “ His face did
shine as the sun, and His raiment was wliite as the
light.” Always that seems to be the aura ascribed to
any representation of the Chust
In the pure white ray lies the whole octave of
colour within the physical plane spectrum— repie-
sentmg m the human aura spirituality, love 111 its
completeness, and gold indicated in the halo of the
Saints— and standing for wisdom and all knowledge
— the sign manual of intellect m the aura—shines
231
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
forth as the beacon of a sublime and divme per­
fection
All of which is “extrapolating” m excelsis1 But as
I have already suggested, words may be forgiven to
babes and sucklings that would be unjustifiable on
the lips ofthe learned1
There appears to be a good deal of misconception
among inquirers with only a surface knowledge ofthe
subject, with regard to “earthbound” spirits The
earthbound soul need not necessarily be either silly
nor mischievously disposed There may be many
reasons for the bonds which seem so difficult to break,
fetters forged by themselves when m the flesh. It
may be perhaps that they cannot understand they
are no longer m the flesh, and continue to wander
among old scenes, tied to the interests which filled
their minds when on earth It may be the sense of
ownership that draws them back to their former
possessions, money or jealousy or some ignoble or
earthy desire that makes them unable to shake
themselves free or to listen to the call of those in the
other world who would help them if they could
The bond of love is a very different matter The
glorious force that inspires the universe, the most
potent magnet m God’s creation, can never be de­
basing in its results Those who return to earth— of
which there are many—m obedience to the pull of
love are not “earthbound,” they come voluntarily
and are obeying the finest urge of which the heart
232
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
of man, whether on this plane or the next, is capable
Whether the urge be that of a mutual tie, or the ex­
pression ofself-sacrifice on the altar ofa desire to help
those still bound by the limitations ofphysical matter,
they surely do not come within the range of the
“earthbound” m any sense at all
There are several varieties of “hauntings,” and
although in offering any sort of explanation we, as
inquirers, are groping only, these conclusions are
built upon expenence, and the repetition of the same
phenomenon m the same conditions; although so
many exceptions seem to be necessary in proving
any rule in ,the methodology of psychic phenomena,
that anything like laying down the law is to be caie-
fully avoided There are, however, a few broad
lines which phenomena certainly appear to follow,
which would account for the variation m the ex­
perience of the percipients
For instance, there are many cases of a so-called
“ghost” who is visible only to one or more members
of a family or household; the rest may be entirely
unaware of its existence This would point to special
development of the inner senses on the part of the
individual who could “see” it Even should no
clairvoyant be present, it would not necessarily
mean there was nothing there— as we know from the
stories of those “gone over” who so vainly attempt
to attract the attention of their friends in this world;
it would only mean there was no one present who
could see clairvoyantly
In instances where everyone present, or all the
233 16
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
members of a household, can see or hear the abnor­
mal visitor, it argues a complete or partial manifes­
tation of a sufficiently matenal nature to cause a
reaction on the part of the physical eye, or ear; or m
some cases physical sensation of feeling To produce
this phenomenon the assistance of ectoplasm is
necessary, and we must presume someone in the
immediate neighbourhood with sufficient mediumis-
tic properties to supply it All “ghosts” sufficiently
materialized to be visible to everyone, telekinesis or
movement of objects without physical contact, the
disturbances caused by Poltergeistand so on would fall
into this class
A family may inhabit a house reputed to be
haunted for years without the appearance of any­
thing of an abnormal nature; to be succeeded by
another family whose lives are made a burden to
them by apparitions pleasant or otherwise, due to the
presence of one of its members, possibly a child or
servant, from whom, unknown to themselves, the
“ghost” is able to draw sufficient ectoplasm for
physical manifestation
There is another form of “ haunting” that seems to
ask for an explanation differing from either of the
foregoing, and of which Mr Frank Hives m his book
published by John Lane, “ Glimpses into Infinity,”
gives a good instance.
This appears to be a kind of thought-form or
impression thrown off into the ether
Riding through rough country m New Zealand
he saw what he took to be a man, sitting on a fence,
23+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and describes him accurately m his book He
addressed some words to him but got no reply, the
figure being apparently concerned with his own
thoughts After a short interval the man got off the
fence, walked across to an adjacent pond and threw
himself into it Mr Hives carefully noted the
absence of any splash or disturbance of the water’s
surface
All the movements of the figure seem to have been
entirely automatic, a mere re-enactment of some
incident m the past There was no sign of any power
ofinitiative, no reaction to any stimulus from outside,
nor m fact of consciousness of any sort There are
many stories of a similar nature
The effect of the action being apparently so com­
pletely automatic, tempts one to ask whether such
manifestations can be called “ghosts” m the accepted
meaning of the term In these days of television, still
in its infancy, it would be premature either to accept
or reject speculations of what may or may not be
capable of registration on the ether
May it not be possible that m moments of acute
emotion such as would be engendered by murder or
suicide, an impression may be projected and regis­
tered, and that m the manner of a cinematograph
the scene is enacted over and over again until at
long last the energy runs down and the image
fades away?
That theory may at present be unsatisfactory to the
strictly scientific inquirer, although it falls m with
those very ancient lines of philosophy which have
235
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
long maintained that every act and definite thought
projected by the human race are automatically
registered in the ether of space for those to read who
know how to do so, that we are in fact our own
“ recording angels ” After the modern revelations
through scientific discovery and the glimpse we are
getting of the possibilities of sound with the ether
as recording agent, who is to say such things are not
possible *

O f the vagaries of Poltergeist I have had one per­
sonal experience
I was staying as a guest, nineteen or twenty years
ago, in one of the old Colleges at Oxford My host
was a learned Professor and I should have thought/
very unpromising ground for experiments on the
part of mischievous spirits On arrival my hostess
asked me if I objected to sleeping m a “haunted”
room, which, as we were strangers to one another until
that moment, I thought a rash suggestion—many
people I know would have preferred to sleep on the
stairs'—especially those who “do not believe m
ghosts ”
Having agreed to take any risk there might be I
asked what particular form of “haunt” was to be
expected
“ A noise,” was the answer, “sometimes quite
deafening It doesn’t happen every night and may be
either m the room you are m or in the room above.”
“ And there isn’t a rat on the place,” the Professor
assured me, “so don’t make out it’s rats after you’ve
heard it'”
236
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Rats1 He need not have warned m e1
It was a very low room, so low I could touch the
ceiling by reaching up a hand, and panelled in old
oak Quite a good setting for any sort of weird
visitor, but apparently nothing was ever seen, only
heard I elicited the further fact that the sounds
were not ofgroaning, nor rattling chains, nor hysteri­
cal laughter, butjust noise, and plenty ofit.
So, although not what might be called nervous, I
went to bed a little strung up, stayed expectantly
awake until three o’clock m the morning, and finally
went off to sleep without any sort of manifestation of
a disturbing nature having transpired1
The following night I went to bed and to sleep
without thinking any more about it.
In the early hours of morning, still pitch-dark, I
was crashed into consciousness— I can use no other
expression— by the most appalling dm it has ever
been my fate to experience under any roof1
On bare boards over my head furniture was being
pitched and dragged, bumping, tearing across the
floor. It was in the room above but owing to the low­
ness of the ceiling it might have been m the room I
was occupymg, and at each fresh crash I thought
everything must be coming through on top of me I
had forgotten my hostess’s warning and only thought
how surprisingly inconsiderate ofthe servants, if they
had to get up so early they might at least make less
noise about it 1
Then a clock outside struck three, an hour at
which the most industrious of households would
237
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
refuse to rise, and remembering the “haunt” I sat up
m bed and took notice
It went on for about twenty mmutes, what might
have been boots taken offand flung into every corner
of the room, tables overturned, glasses smashed,
heavy weights dropped, a never-ceasing, deafening
dm which stopped as abruptly as though a shutter
had suddenly been dropped between myselfand it
In describing it to my hostess I remarked there
could not have been a bit of anything left whole m
the wreck
“Would you like to see the room above yours
she asked, and we went up to an attic room on the
floor above
Bare boards, bare walls, an entirely empty room
confronted me, not a trace of any sort of furmtuie
was there Not so much as a broomstick to be seen 1
Whether I heard the sounds clairaudiently, or
whether they were conveyed to my physical ears by
the atmosphere m the normal manner, I cannot say
I only know I was awakened by them and m full
possession of my senses as I sat up and hstened to
them1
The Professor had told me I was not to say rats;
but I am not sure that that is not what he would
have said, if/had said, Poltergeist!
238
CHAPTER TW ENTY
A
P Smnett, the well-known theosophist already
mentioned m these pages, was essentially an
occultist and very little of a mystic From him I
learnt a good deal of fact and of theory with regard
to super-physical law to be rejected or accepted
according to the appeal it presented to my own sense
of logic and reason, which, although it may sound
over self-confident, must be eventually the ultimate
appeal for each one of us
By his critics he was sometimes called credulous
Eveiyone is accused of credulity sooner or later who
believes m what the majority of people do not be­
lieve m But the slow and difficult march of evol-
lution is accomplished in the main through the slow
and difficult persistence of minorities, and the
pioneers who have had vision concerning matters
which cannot be demonstrated m the laboratory or
by mathematics, will always be called credulous till
the rest of the world finds out there is after all a
method in their madness
Mr. Sinnett was a man of considerable attainment
After relinquishing his position as editor of the
Pioneer m India he continued to be attached to that
paper as scientific correspondent for years after his
return to London, which speaks for itself He told
239
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
me of what was stated to be a super-physical law
through which ether could be compressed into so
solid and invulnerable a consistency—for want of a
better word— as to be impenetrable and impervious
to all contacts of a physical nature, that m cases of
levitation this process was called mto operation, and
that a “sheath” of this description placed round a
physical object would form an impenetrable barri­
cade against outside contacts
Well, that might or might not be It was interest­
ing and as a theory no more fantastic than many
theories I had seen put into practical demonstration
in the stance-room would have been accounted by
the uninitiated
The elimination of fear is the first essential m the
operating of all super-physical law “To dare all”
and “to be silent” have always figured m the educa­
tional course of the would-be initiate from the days
of the hierophant of ancient Egypt to the esoteric
student of modern times The vibrations induced
by the emotion of fear and conveyed outward
through the aura, would tend to break up the
“etheric sheath” and destroy the conditions necessary
to success It may be remembered that m the
records of the so-called “miracles” of the New
Testament there are certain districts mentioned in
which Christ was unable to perform them owing to
the subjects’ want of faith
Peter was sustained by the water until, through
fear, he destroyed the conditions established by the
Master of knowledge and of the laws of the universe,
240
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
when immediately he began to sink Fear, m any
form, of the future, of disease, of material conditions,
is the most destructive element of all the ills that es­
caped from Pandora’s box to plague humanity It
lies behind most of our failures, and bnngs with it
the very shadow from which we would flee
With the keen inteiest that every phase of the
working of natural law has always aroused within
me I readily accepted an invitation which came to
me a good many years ago now, to attend a séance
with a “fire-medium ” She was a Mrs Annie
Hunter, who, under the control of an ancient fire-
worshipper, was said to handle fire and live coals
with her bare hands as Daniel Home had done some
years previously The circle had been organized by
Mr Gambler Bolton and natuially I jumped at the
opportunity
We met in a large, empty house in St John’s
Wood m broad daylight The circle consisted of ten
or twelve persons, some of whom I knew, some were
strangers A newspaper correspondent fiom a well-
known daily was among them, and we sat in a semi­
circle before a large grate m which a red-hot fire of
coal and coke was glowing
After a short interval the reporter from the daily
paper was invited to go down into the cellar and
select a log of wood from the stack he would find
there
He did so, bringing back a log of a size usually
burned in ordinary grates, it was placed on the fiic
and turned about until it was red-hot Mis. Hunter,
241
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
whose hands had been thoroughly examined by a
doctor present and pronounced to be in a perfectly
normal state—they had been washed just previously
with soap and hot water— then went into trance
When she rose to her feet she was to all appearance
a totally different personality—gave an impression of
age, became very excited, gesticulating and repeating
a word that to me sounded like “ Maseta” over and
over again It has since been suggested it might
have been “ Mazda,” the name of ancient Persia’s
fire-god 1
After a few minutes of energetic declamation she
walked to the fire and with her bare hands removed
the glowing log, passing it from hand to hand while
she walked round the circle Finally, she stopped
opposite the repoiter and in spile of a ceitam
amount of natural alarm that made him shunk away,
brought the log so close to his rather heavy crop of
hair that we could hear it sizzle1
— a fact he com­
mented on m his own account of the sitting next
morning
Then for some reason known, I suppose, to the
“ control,” certainly not to me, she smgled me out
and offered me the log, still red-hot, as it had been
several limes re-heated m the fire
While the medium had been walking about with
the log I had been busy reasoning m my own mmd to
the effect that every phenomenon connected with
physical law, great or small, must be obedient to
cause and effect If there were any apparent
variation from this rule it must be attributed, m the
242
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
absence of other explanation, to the superimposing
of a super-physical law—some still more potent law
that could abrogate the other.
Accordmg to the laws of matter, human flesh,
when placed m contact with a red-hot log, must burn,
whether the subject be in trance or asleep or dead,
that law would operate
But here was a case where it was not operating!
Therefore it was to be presumed some superior
law had been called into action, and I remembered
the “ ethenc sheath” which so far I had only known
in theory
It looked as though that process might be the key
to the situation How, I could not say, certainly
through no power of mine But my knowledge of it,
first theoretically and now being, as it seemed, put
into piactice before my eyes, gave me the faith to
conclude that as the medium’s hand was not burned,
neither would mine be, the law m operation would
equally protect me
So without a qualm I put out my bare hand and
she laid the radiantly glowing log upon it and left it
there while she walked round the circle; not for
long but quite long enough, as the newspaper cor­
respondent put m his report next day, for my hand to
have been burnt to the bone m ordinary circum­
stances.
When she removed it there was not so much as a
red mark!
Logic, common sense and the slight knowledge of
occult law had pievented me fiom feeling any fear I
243
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
did nothing I do not know how to operate the law;
it was due to no effort of will on my part I was
merely the means through which the operator was
able to achieve the desired end— and unless such a
medium were present, wild horses would not per­
suade me to take any red-hot log off any fire1
But it was a wonderful experience As I looked
down on the log lying on my open palm m defiance
of all the laws of physics as we knew them, I knew
that every word of the records of the marvels worked
by Christ was true; not to be explained away as the
Church itself seems inclined to do to-day, as fairy
tales, distorted tradition, the accretions of the
centuries* inaccuracies But the bald truth, the
record of One who said He came to work through the
law and not to destroy it
I should not presume to offer an experience so
difficult for the inexperienced to accept, on the
testimony of my word alone I append here the
testimony of two eye-witnesses, members of the
circle, both letters I quote from the newspapers in
which they appeared
The first is from Lieut -Colonel E R Johnson,
under the heading of “More about the red-hot log” *
“ Sir,
“ I was at the séance referred to by Mrs Cham­
pion de Crespigny m the Daily News of December
13th The medium came first of all to me holding
the burning log dropping red-hot fragments of
wood which fell on the floor
244
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
“ She intimated} though not in words, that it
should be placed on my head I naturally hesi­
tated because nature has left me quite unpro­
tected on that part ofmy body, and I remembered
too that I was wearing a new suit of clothes which
might suffer even if my head escaped injury.
“ Mrs de Crespigny gallantly held out her hand
and held the burning log for some time
E R Johnson, I.M S
(Retired)”
Windham Club,
St James’s Square
The second letter is from Mr James Coates, Ph D.
The letter is too long to quote m full, the following
extract will be sufficient.
“ I should not refer to the extraordinary incident
mentioned by Mrs de Crespigny had I not been
present and witnessed the fact ”
Mr Coates referred to an address given by me in
Brighton at which he had been present.
“At the conclusion I asked if she would tell
us of her experience with a fire-medium m St.
John’s Wood . . Mrs de Crespigny then told
us of her experiences, but added that she had less
hesitation m stating the facts as the writer of this
was an eye-witness
“The occurrence is m direct opposition to our
2+5
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
conception of physical law, and it indicates the
operation ofsome super-physical powers which are
beyond our present knowledge, but within the
knowledge of super-physical beings By the
damage which the fearing journalist sustained,
and the immunity which the passive Mrs de
Crespigny obtained, we at least learn that part of
the control of those powers is due to the mental
psychic part of the sitters; and this suggests some
explanation ofthe difference m results experienced
by sitters of varying temperaments and this m
physical phenomena too ”
The account which appeared m the Daily Express
the following morning and which I still have, is a
corroboration of what I have already given I will
merely quote the sentence m which my part m the
incident is mentioned*
“Again the log was put back m the fire It was
then carried by the medium and placed on the open
palm of another woman ” (The reporter did not
know my name ) “ It was not there long, but quite
long enough to have burned it under normal con­
ditions She felt no pain . Later the Daily
Express representative attempted to pick the log off
the fire It was impossible to hold it for even a
fractional part of a second The performance
is perplexing There was no cabinet, no darkness,
none of the usual dubious appanages of spiritualism
It all took place within a twelve-foot circle m full
light.”

THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
This experience, although a wonderful and
dramatic incident m my own life, proving the truth
of many ofthe Biblical records of wonders worked by
the initiated, I make no claim to have been m any
way unique It is well-known that Darnel Home
was able to handle live coals with impunity, and the
following account, sent by a rehable eye-witness, of
“walking through fire” in India, appears to have
been worked through a law similar to that in
operation at the house m St John’s Wood. I give it
more or less m his own words
He describes having been present on three
occasions when, by virtue of the power over fire
possessed by Syed Husein \tashi, many persons
were able to walk uninjured through glowing embers
and through flames
In each instance a large number of spectators,
including well-known British and Indian ladies and
gentlemen, witnessed the spectacle The acting
Police Commissioner presided on the first occasion,
which took place on the 17th of November, 1927
A trench twelve feet long, four feet wide, by one
foot deep, had been filled with glowing embers of
about halfa ton of burning firewood On the arrival
of the Police Commissioner, Syed Husein Atashi,
calling aloud repeatedly the word “ Gulzar,” invited
those present to walk through the trench without
fear
Two Mohammedans then entered the trench.
Taking courage from this example, several people,
among whom were a few Parsee ladies, followed
247
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
bare-footed from one end of the trench to the other.
No one complained of hurt
The writer also took off his shoes and walked m
his socks through the glowing embers, feeling only
the sensation of treading on a slightly warm rough
surface.
Syed Husem Atashi then had pieces of matting
thrown on to the embers, and when these were burn­
ing, again asked anyone who desired to pass through
the flames Several spectators did so without injury
Lastly, pieces of matting were saturated with
paraffin and flung into the trench Again people
walked unharmed through the flames that reached
their knees
A little Mohammedan girl about eight and her
brother about ten passed through the fire, and the
loin-cloth of a young Hindu who inadvertently
placed his foot outside the limits oj the trench (the italics
are mine) caught fire but his skin was not scorched.
A doctor who noticed the incident stated that m the
ordinary course ofevents the youth would have been
burned seriously enough to necessitate his im­
mediate removal to hospital.
This statement is endorsed by the British Resident
of Gwalior State
The Biblical story of the casting of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego into the fiery furnace may
possibly be an example of the same super-physical
law in operation. We are told that the three men
were bound in their coats and other garments and
248
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
thrown into a furnace so hot that the men who
threw them in were slam themselves
After a short interval Nebuchadnezzar, unable
to beheve his own eyes, rose up and asked. “Did not
we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire'1
”
and when told this was so, protested “Lo, I see four
men loose, walking m the midst of the fire, and they
have no hurt, and the form of the fourth is hke the
Son of God ” Finally it is recorded that the great
assembly present “saw these men, upon whose
bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of
their head singed, neither were their coats changed,
nor the smell of fire had passed on them ”
Arguing from the circumstances of the fire-
walkers’ demonstration m India, and by my own
experience m St. John’s Wood, we may presume the
fourth man seen by Kang Nebuchadnezzar was the
medium— or occultist— thiough whom the necessary
laws were put into operation. It was of old, just
as it is to-day, a natural human impulse to attribute
any vision of a “heavenly visitant” to the most
exalted source. We need hardly accept the state­
ment in its literal sense, that “ God walked m the
Garden of Eden in the cool of the day ”
Were the claims often made by well-meaning
persons of having interviewed the Christ Himself
or even of being directly associated with guides from
the highest spheres, the claimants would probably
not be here to make them; for the rate and power oi
the attendant vibrations would be absolutely disin­
tegrating to any physical body on so low a level as
249 17
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
the earth. At best we must suppose them to be
messengers or delegates of some sort
In the light of persistent tradition from the past,
well-attested confirmation from India and all parts
of the world, added to the experience of many
persons in modern times, the facts can hardly be
denied, facts not only m connection with fire-
phenomena, but with a wider range of physical
manifestations The accepted marvels of scientific
discovery surely prove that almost all things are
possible, why should it appear to be so insuperably
difficult for the average mind to accept the further
possibilities of super-physical law— so difficult that
the Church, finding itself unable to explain, is
attempting to deny?
The scientist shrinks from an investigation where
the facts appear to be on so unstable a basis as to
make reliable evidence hard to come by Once
again, I remind, “fools step m where angels fear to
tread.” The time may come, is, I think, coming,
when the world, so far as psychical research is con­
cerned, will be grateful to the fools for having braved
public opinion and, in spite of it, torn aside the veil
between the two worlds1
A certain bishop not so many years ago wrote a
book m which he discredited all the New Testament
“ miracles” except those of healing—though why
those should have been exempt it seemed hard to
say.
Having been given so wonderful an experience
myself I considered it “up to me” to go and tell him
250
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
of it—the learned sometimes get so wedged in
among the higher branches of their particular tree
that they find it almost impossible to chmb down.
I have always considered it one of the bravest
acts of my life when—though I had httle hope of the
result— I bearded him m his den
He was kindness and courtesy itself and we had
an interesting talk on reincarnation.
But when it came to the burning log I am quite
sure he did not believe a word I said!
251
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
O
NE of the many arguments advanced against
spiritualism, meanmg communication with
those upon a higher plane through a medium, is that
it interferes with the personal development of the
individual That is the mam root of the hostility
to the subject so long shown by so many theosophists,
an attitude on their part that is becoming greatly
modified as the uses of psychic research, as a founda­
tion stone for many forms of structure, are becoming
more and more evident
But to a certain extent the objection is valid
To take the easier road through an intermediary,
instead of developing the powers that lie latent
within each one of us, has been called the lazy man’s
route to the goal in view
The trouble is that in the strenuous and exacting
world of physical matter m which we live to-day the
training and study requisite for such development
present an almost impossible proposition to men and
women leading ordinarily busy lives The time and
energy demanded are out of reach, and the sug­
gestion that all members of the human race should
develop along psychic lines would be more or less a
counsel of perfection
But the fact remains It would be better assuredly,
252
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
from the pomt of their own evolvement, for them to
learn to rise to the level of those who communicate,
instead of asking them to descend to ours In the
latter case it does us no good from the point of view
of self-development, even though on the other hand
it may do themno harm—and in speaking of develop­
ment I mean the highest form of it, not a flooding of
the community with second-class clairvoyance and
clairaudience, of which there is already more than
enough
The first step toward the unfoldment of the inner
senses, clairvoyance, clairaudience, psychometrical
readings and so on, is the practice of that most
difficult exercise in the world— concentration Not
the concentration, let it be noted, that comes from
interest m the subject m hand To be absorbed m
the occupation of the moment is very necessary
to success concerning that subject, but for the time
being, as regards the mind, it is allowing it to run
along the lme of least resistance The concentration
that counts as a preliminary to any form of mental
or psychic development lies in the power to fix the
mind upon something that m itself is not interesting,
something from which the mind wishes to stray and
has to be recalled by the disciplinary action of the
will; a deliberate focusing ofthe attention upon some
object or, better still, some abstract quality, and
refusing to allow it to wander, for a definite period,
in spite of any attempt on its part to do so
Real “ one-point’’ concentration, although only a
first step on the road, is exceedingly difficult of
253
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
accomplishment It may be years before sufficient
control over the mind is established to keep the
attention immovably fixed on anything, either
concrete or abstract, for more than ten minutes—if
as much I know an advanced psychic who practised
it for five years before he could say the power was
his to any noticeable degree The mind will wander;
consequently it is often said that we cannot control
our thoughts But we can, if we go the right way to
work and moreover m the doing of it we incidentally
become more valuable members of the community
in that through command of the mind we can
control the body, learn to think clearly and lucidly,
and in the more advanced stages of the practice
become an influence m our immediate surroundings
that has to be reckoned with
This power of concentration, developed and
amplified until complete control of the mind is
attained, and the attention can be focused upon a
given point at will for an indefinite time, is the first
step m occult growth It cannot be evaded Often,
would-be students complain that m their particular
circumstances it is impossible to give the time, that
the effort produces headache, that the necessary
conditions of silence and detachment aie out of
reach There is but one answer to such complaints—
that their training m occultism must be deferred
until such time as the fulfilment of the conditions
should become possible, there will be no abrogation
of law to suit anyone’s convenience or particular
circumstances If the conditions cannot be fulfilled,
254
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
training in occultism will have to be postponed But
my experience m life has been that for the most part
where there is a will there is a way
The importance of this practice of concentration
is emphasized m all the religions of civilizations,
ancient and modern, although comparatively few
of their votaries understand the inner working of the
forms they may be practising It is enjoined through­
out the philosophies of the East, m the Hermetic
Doctrines of ancient Egypt, where the paramount
importance of the absolute control of the mind was
the very essence of the teaching, it is the basis of
Indian Yoga and the preliminary to the meditation
that gradually enabled the saints, Christian and
otherwise, old and new, to see visions and to hear
voices The occultist and the mystic must indeed
travel by the same path to reach an identical goal,
but while the former takes notice of the signposts and
understands the meaning of the obstacles he has
surmounted on the journey, and can be therefore
perhaps ofmore assistance to those who would follow
in his footsteps, the mystic keeps his eyes fixed upon
the Star m the East, walks blindly along the road
of which he takes no notice and arrives, not knowing
how he got there perhaps, nor anything of God’s
wonderful laws which have been put into operation,
more or less unconsciously, for the attainment of his
end
Who is to say which is the better part? It must be
each one to his taste1 But the law in each case must
be fulfilled, and the secret lying behind the practice
255
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
of concentration has been explained along lines that
are at the least plausible
The mill which is the brain is for ever grinding;
during our waking hours inexorably, ceaselessly
transmuting the physical tissues into the more
subtle form of thought In modern-day philosophy
the thought as a thing is coming mto its own Those
interested in psychic research know that thought can
be not only seen, and transmitted, but on occasion
photographed, which, as the physical matter of the
biam becomes exhausted in the process of its genera­
tion, should not be impossible to accept as at least a
working hypothesis
As a result of these processes of the brain, myriads
of vibrations so rapid as to be hardly more definite
than a sustained quiver are discharged into the aura
— again an admissible hypothesis m the light of the
area of disturbed ether granted by the scientists as
necessarily surrounding any centre of chemical
change
Professor d’Orsay, and no doubt others, maintain
that thought-processes generate heat as a result of
the definite chemical changes that take place in the
brain
Through this envelope of constant motion it is
almost impossible, so our “communicators” tell us,
for vibrations of a still more subtle nature to pene­
trate , take sis an analogy the fact that wireless-waves
travel more easily at night, owing to the absence of
disturbance in the ether of light-waves, than by
day
256
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Arrest this rapid, movement in the aura by stilling
the processes gomg on in the bram, thought suc­
ceeding thought in restless procession, through
focusing the mind steadily upon one pomt and
refusing to allow it to wander, and the influences
and suggestions from higher planes can then be con­
veyed to the consciousness without distortion or
deflection, just as perfect reflections can be obtained
from the surface of still water, but not if it be broken
up into ripples
The power of concentration is also a means of
leaving the physical body at will
Different teachers have different methods Lord
| Tennyson tells us he left the body through the con­
stant repetition of his name. The Rosicrucian
method is a favourite with some students, and
incidentally it is also a pleasant exercise of the
imagination, a visualization of the growth of a flower
from seed to blossom. First, picture to yourself a
seed m the earth, darkness all around it, sending out
the succulent white roots from beneath to grope
among the particles of brown soil foi stability and
sustenance. Then see the strong white shoot above,
starting on adventure, deterred by no obstacle on
its journey to the light; twisting in between the little
hard clods that hinder and eventually piercing the
surface and getting its first glimpse of the world
As it is touched by the light of heaven, it turns
from white to palest green, or perhaps a rosy red,
and gathers strength and solidity before starting on
the next stage of the journey
257
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
Watch it with the eyes of your mind as it mounts
higher into the air from which it now draws half its
strength and vitality. You can see it swell as it
drinks in the raindrops and the leaves begin to push
out from each side, have a clean mental vision ofthe
form and characteristics of them, large or small,
simple shapes with a midrib, or serrated and delicate
as lace-work If the form of them should be left
hazy and indeterminate, there will always be a
disturbing sense of incompleteness, want of definite­
ness when you subsequently build up the picture
Finally the buds appear, singly or m clusters,
according to your own conception, enfolded tightly
in the closed green calyx, they swell slowly, until
under the warm rays of the sun the chmax arrives
and the treasure within, pink, blue, yellow or of
glistening white, as created by your mind, appears
in full perfection, and if you have truly concen­
trated on its growth and fulfilment you may even be
conscious of the sweetness of its scented aura
Three times I have achieved conscious absence
from the body through this process, on the first
occasion, standing by my bed and looking down on
my body lying inert— and I was so astonished that I
snapped back into it without further adventure!
But at the end of the mental visualization I once
found myself standing on a wide lawn of vivid green
grass, m an atmosphere that I camonly describe as of
a radiant sort of gold dust— exquisite, with shadows
cast by high trees that fell across the grass as blots of
indescent colour. In the distance, my husband was
258
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
sitting reading He looked up and his face lit on
seeing me standing there, and I—in the moment of
recognition— back I flashed into my body— with a
memory I shall never forget so long as I live1
A dream'1
Have I lived all these years without being able to
distinguish between that and a dream?
Let others who have had the same experience
answer
Not m a day nor a month, not possibly even a
year, but at long last, when all effort m the per­
formance has ceased, patience and pertinacity will
have its reward But real concentration that is going
to count is a very slow process.
The “secrets” ofthe inner knowledge, the develop­
ment of man’s higher powers have been kept and
guarded until as a race he was ready for initiation.
The Angel with the flaming sword has stood at the
door and, as ever, saved him from himself The
knowledge has been handed down through past
ages by certain sects and individuals; the Gnostics,
the Freemasons, Qjiakers, Rosicruaans, and cei-
tainly, m some degree, the Roman Catholic Church
Psychic research is unveiling some of them, but the
deepest and by far the most important concern the
powers that lie within the man himself, the realiza­
tion and contacting of the God within.
This “inner knowledge” to which the alluring
word “secret” is often apphed, is no fairy tale, but so
far from being as sensational as the word might im­
ply, the tyro is tempted to protest, as Naaman pro-
259
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
tested, against the simplicity of the prophet’s exhor­
tation to bathe in the River Jordan as a cure for his
ills, at the prosaic nature of the foundations from
which the mam structure is to spring As concen­
tration is one of the first essentials, so is the develop­
ment of the will through the conservation and trans­
mutation of energy
The scientist will tell you that as regards physical
matter nothing can give out more energy than it
possesses That sounds trite, but it is sometimes
necessary to emphasize known facts through repe­
tition
Energy in some of its forms can not only be given
out but can also be conserved for years and used
when desired, as a result of every chemical change a
certain amount of energy is freed We are con­
tinually performing this process in the physical
world of “bottling up” energy m ways both great
anH small We do it when winding up a watch or
any mechanical toy, it is stored in the spring, and
the energy remains latent until gradually released
On a large scale, energy is stored m the vast coal­
fields of the world The energy that was poured into
the earth from radio-active sources has lain there,
stored and inactive, neither destroyed nor lost, but
latent, waiting until through the development of his
intellectual faculties man has been able to release it
anA use it for his own ends Even then it is not des­
troyed, only re-distributed, obtaining its reactions
in a different form
The story of the schoolboy who, when asked what
260
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
electricity was and having sought vainly for inspira­
tion, answered desperately “ God knows ■” might
equally well be told of energy, for, to paraphrase the
Biblical aphorism, only by its works do we know it
But the laws governing its relation to physical
matter seem to be equally applicable, with certain
modifications, to the higher levels, both mental and
spiritual—planes upon which mind and will ap­
parently function through direct contacts without
the intervention necessary in physical conditions,
such as manipulation or the use of appropriate in­
struments, will being always the guiding principle
without which energy is useless on any plane, a pre­
mise not altogether absurd m these days when science
is beginning to bcheve that all is mind, and that mind
is everywhere.
To develop a will worth the name, something that
counts, that has behind it sufficient dynamic force to
ensure the desired reactions, definite laws must be
obeyed. In support of this we should marshal the
evidence emphasizing the supreme importance and
efficacy of man’s will rightly directed, to be found in
our own Scriptures and other ancient writings.
Not only are Christ’s teachings rich in exhortations
to this end, but in the Old Testament continual
reference is made to the advantages, even from a
worldly point of view, to him “that overcometh ”
This is another of the basic “occult secrets,” prosaic
and familiar as it may sound, that had it been as
generally appreciated as it is now becoming among
those who “understand” at an earlier stage m man’s
261
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
evolution, he might easily m the wielding of it have
wrought his own destruction Again the Angel with
the flaming sword has stood guard to save him from
himself
It would almost seem that the primary object of
the descent ofspirit into matter was the development
of will-power, on the rough and sometimes cruel
grindstone of hfe on earth. Why—it is beyond our
power to conjecture It might be imagined that an
Almighty Will could have accomplished all its ends
without pursuing what appears to be so laborious a
method m the doing of it. It may be that, as Pro­
fessor Bergson and other philosophers have sug­
gested, the Deity Himselfis evolving and has not yet
reached the pinnacle of a final perfection? That we
human beings should be put through so drastic an
ordeal as life in physical conditions, suggests that
human consciousness as part ofHis own consciousness
is acquiring through the experience of pain and
endeavour something that is to be added to the sum-
total of the eventual whole If indeed this is not so,
the skem of evolution appears to be a greater tangle
than ever, and all we go through here a sort of wan­
ton sport on the part of the Creator— and no sane
mind can believe that!
So, not understanding, we must leave it and do the
best we can with what we can understand, and by a
careful consideration of the lights available, we
gather that man’s will has in it all the power, all the
magic, all the potentialities of the Divine Will of
which it is a part
262
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
The maxim “He that ruleth his spirit is gi eater
than he that taketh a city” is so familiar to all of us
that it has become a platitude that does not even
go in at one ear, much less travels so far as to go out
at the other1
— which is the way of platitudes, how­
ever true they may be But it is no platitude to the
occultist, who knows and understands the bald
truth lying at the back of it No mere poetical
figure of speech, but a vital fact
He that has mastered the weaknesses of the flesh
that is his body, that has subdued the physical
particles of it and controlled their natural reactions
to stimuli either from without or from within, has
drawn to himself a power to be reckoned with, has
become the focus of a force actually more potent in
its influence over men and matter, than the force­
fulness essential to the generalship that can take a
city
The messages m Revelation to the Churches,
strike the same note To Ephesus “ To him that
overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life ” —
To Smyrna. “And he that overcometh and keepeth
my works until the end (fulfils the law) to him will I
give power over the nations ”— “ To him that over­
cometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
even as I also overcame ”— “ To him that overcometh
will I give to eat of the hidden manna,” and, m the
XXIst Chapter of the same Book “ He that over­
cometh shall inherit all things ”
Initiation into the mysteries of Isis included many
ordeals and trials by which the will-power of the
263
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
hierophant would be strengthened and developed.
Ordeal by fire, by water, by air, all had to be faced,
and the fears of the flesh brought into subjection by
the will. An exacting priesthood, having themselves
been subjected to like trials, saw to it that none
following in their footsteps should evade payment
of the uttermost farthing.
According to Hermetic Doctrines, special reward
was promised to those who had strong wills—not
“self-will” to be imposed upon others, but the will
that masters the self, that rules the mind and
through the mind the body. The same thread runs
through the fibre of the Toga of the East; will-power
deliberately developed, according to our ideas per­
haps misapplied in the majority of instances, but
pointing to a knowledge ofthe power that lies behind.
Faith reinforced by such well-directed energy can in
truth remove mountains.
Rudyard Kipling touches the fringe of the inner
knowledge in “ If,” the poem that, having outlined
almost every channel for self-discipline, epitomizes
the result of such exercise in the line:
“The world is yours and all that there is in it.”
No mere figure of speech, but hard fact.
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
N
O T only can this power of the will— poten­
tially as mighty a force as the Divine Will of
which it is a part—be developed, it can be conserved,
as can energy, of which it would seem to be a mani­
festation, through the exerase of a fundamental law
analogous to the physical
The processes necessary to this end were known to
and appreaated by the initiates and hierophants of
old and are also to be found in terms that all who run
may read, in our own Scriptures and the sacred
writings of other religions. The means are at hand
for all The will can be deliberately developed and
reinforced through the reactions to be found in daily
life There is no life high or low, great or small,
lacking in the straw for the making of the bricks so
essential to building up of character.
The opportunities to capture and store the power
that will definitely influence the material as well as
the mental conditions of circumstance, are within
the grasp of each and all, the same means through
which the “magicians” of Egypt, the fakirs of the
East, the initiate wherever he is to be found, has
acquired control over certain generally accepted
“laws of nature ”
To treat so vast a subject briefly, the end is
265 18
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
achieved by capturing and storing the foice that lies
behind all desires and every form of temptation,
whether of the material plane or the mental Desire
m any form is a stimulation exercised by some in­
fluence possibly unseen but apprehensible, with
driving power behind it, such power that it can
persuade us into actions that may be contrary to
every instinct and even to common sense It makes
us do things “against our will”— an admission of
its superior strength— goading the flesh or the
mentality into actions that may be called wrong
or may only be called foolish But under whatever
heading it may be ranged, and whatever its source,
it is the manifestation of a force that can bend the
will to its own purposes It is a demonstration of
energy
If, through giving m to it, it obtain its reaction,
the energy is dissipated, wasted, you have had your
opportunity and lost it.
If, on the contrary, you refuse to succumb, you can
deliberately store it— “ bottle” it, just as the energy
of the coal-fields is “bottled”—and reserve it de­
liberately for future use The power lying behind
the temptation may be transmuted; not permitted
to exhaust itself in a useless reaction, but reserved
and directed into a different channel as desired
It can be done1
Every time, even m the little trifles of life, when
you are conscious of the current of temptation assail­
ing you in any form—to say perhaps what would be
better left unsaid— to indulge m small bad habits—
266
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
to yield to the allure of fame, praise, self-indulgence
of any sort—instead of weakly giving way, take a
long breath, think to yourself* “ I take this power, it
is mine; I store it for future use,” and gradually you
will become aware of it in your nerves, your brain,
you will be conscious of something definite acquired
— and you will see the results You will become to a
great extent master of your fate
Each act of self-indulgence squanders the precious
force that might be yours
What was Christ’s ordeal m the wilderness but
a development and storing of the power through
which, according to law, as He said Himself, His
wonders were subsequently performed? What
would have been the sense of fasting for “forty days”
unless by it some end was to be achieved'1 Mastery
of the flesh that He had taken on—flesh that was
subject to the weaknesses of the material body, was
surely the end in view'* And finally having, through
fulfilment of the law, drawn to Himself force m
abundance, the consciousness of the energy stored
within Him prompted the subsequent “ temptation”
through the knowledge that all the cities ofthe world
were literally at His feet
Answer to prayer is promised “if ye keep the
Commandments,” and fasting is coupled with the
exhortation to pray, the self-discipline that will
mean dynamic force behind the prayer Man be­
comes a battery that can command reactions If
this were more fully understood we should not hear
so much about “ miraculous answer to prayer,”
267
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
with nobody more surprised at getting any result
than the supplicant1
This power to acquire and conserve a store of
dynamic energy is again one of the “occult secrets,”
one of the ways m which God made man m His own
likeness, endowing him with God-like potentialities
The force so acquired must not be directed to selfish
ends, but is legitimate enough if applied for the
honest furtherance of work m this life, or for the
good of others, one of the means given to us for
accomplishing life’s task with all our might
Tradition has it that the lost continent of Atlantis
came to grief owing to the advanced knowledge of
occultism possessed by the Atlanteans, who used it
for personal aggrandizement Be that as it may, no
truer word according to occult law was ever spoken
than by the Roman soldiers at the Crucifixion when
they cried. “He saved others, Himself He cannot
s a v e —who could have summoned legions of angels
to His help at will
To those who find hypotheses such as the above un­
convincing and are inclined to scoff, I would only
say— Try it!
This development is obviously on the positive side
of evolution and is not to be recommended to anyone
desirous ofpurely mediumistic powers. The occultist
and the medium are ofopposite polarity Christ was
not a medium m the sense m which we use the word.
The wonders He performed were not achieved by an
extraneous force making use of Him as a mere chan­
nel, but by His innate knowledge and power to work

through laws of which He was a supreme Master
When man has achieved concentration, which is
master of the mind, and self-denial, which is mastery
of the body, he will have made a long step forward
on the journey upward, toward the God m whose
image he was made.
Reference to the positive and negative aspects of
human development drifts naturally into another
field of speculation as regards mediumship
I have before me a list of seventy-eight well-known
accredited mediums, of both sexes Doubtless there
are many more who do not happen to be on this list.
But of those seventy-eight, sixty-one are women.
Why should this be?
Allowing that men’s work m the world would of
necessity preclude some who might have a natural
gift for mediumship from following it up, the pro­
portion of men to women still remains unaccounted
for; moreo\er, the same objection would hold as
regards the latter no less than the former The work
that falls ordinarily to the lot of women would be
a hopeless bar to the practice of really good medium-
ship and would stand in the way of finished develop­
ment quite as much as in the case of the other sex
Most of us know from experience without further
argument, that, of trance and other foims of mental
mediumship, far more exponents are to be found
among women than men
I suggest the clue to it is to be found in the story
of the Creation—the age-old story with the thread
of truth running through it, broken here, perhaps,
269
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and tangled there, but still discernible, and science
with its discoveries of modem miracles is helping
to straighten it out, to bridge the gaps and opening
our eyes to the possibility that after all the Bible
may have known all the time, and m spite of its
critics, what it was talking about.
Man’s body was made of the dust of the earth, of
matter without modification, and it was found to be
inadequate as an instrument through which spirit
could function To put it crudely m terms of to-day,
the gap between the wave-lengths was too wide to
make any form of synchronization possible between
spirit in its higher forms, and matter
A helpmeet, or go-between— I have always
thought the former word aibitrarily and eironeously
interpreted—was necessary, something that perhaps
might be called a “transformer ”
So God created woman He gave her a body, not
of the dust of the earth, not of matter unmodified,
but matter already inspired with spirit, a body in the
allegorical language of the text, made from Adam’s
rib, and with that much advantage at the start
capable of contacting a shorter and more spiritual
wave-length than the more material body of the
male.
Now let this be not for a moment interpreted as a
rlaim for superior sanctity on the part of woman!
It is not1The assumption is merely a suggestion that
in the more delicate fibre of the female body may lie
a possibility of making finer contacts by the mind of
which it is the instrument, that the «actions pro-
270
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
duccd may be of a quality not so capable of endur­
ance or achievement on the material plane as those
of the other sex, but able to make closer contacts
with the more spiritual side of nature
This might account for what is called— and it is a
real thing—feminine intuition, the fact that matter
talks to man more eloquently than to woman, and
the impulse that has led him to put her on a pedestal
— of a sort1
— and to consider a fall from grace on her
part a greater descent than in his own case'*
All ofwhich is not to imply any kind ofsuperiority;
only that where the man may have an advantage on
the infra-red end of the spectrum, the woman may
gam something on the ultra-violet
Which is an allegory1
— built perhaps of the stuff
of which dreams are made But what would hfe be
without its dreams?
The theory of the special functions of the ethenc
body held by theosophists and others who have
founded it on the ancient writings and the results of
clairvoyance, differs from the views of most
spiritualists But m my opinion and without any
wish to dogmatize, the theosophical reading appears
to be on the side of logic, and to throw some light
on the idiosyncrasies of sex
I will put it as briefly as possible. The physical
body is built up of physical matter; the astral body,
in which we function on the astral plane, consists of
astral or super-physical substance Like East and
West, “never the two can meet” without an inter­
mediary—a medium of some sort to bridge the gap.
271
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
We know this to be the case in the stance-room,
where ectoplasm plays the part of intermediary
In the constitution ofman himselfthe ethenc body
is the link between the other two, again a sort of
“transformer” , and is the body,theaura ofwhich Dr.
Kilner was able to make visible through his arrange­
ment of screens; a very different matter from the
astral aura, which registers in varying colours the
moods and emotions, and is only perceived through
clairvoyant vision The ethenc aura is discernible
to very good normal sight or to the beginning of
clairvoyance
The ethenc body, m its office of link, keeps the
physical and astral bodies together, but it is never
the vehicle of the consciousness. Through certain pro­
cesses it is projected m sleep, releasing the astral
body to function on other planes while it remains in
the near neighbourhood of the physical vehicle to
which it belongs and is attached, m a condition
which has been described by clairvoyants as absolute
passivity
It can be artificially released or projected through
the action of an anafsthetic, and leaves the physical
body finally at death, when the umbilical cord is
severed— “the silver cord be broken” in Biblical
language— and the astral body is freed never to
return.
The ethenc body is said to disintegrate pan passu
with the physical, m the neighbourhood of which it
remains, and is supposed to be the basis of many a
story of graveyard “ghosts” ; a shadow-body that,
272
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
when it has played its part, is re-absorbed eventually
by the ether whence it had its source.
Many people can see the etheric aura, myself
among them, who are not sufficiently clairvoyant to
see the astral. My own powers of clairvoyance are
very slight, and the result of deliberate training,
but I have to a certain extent “ etheric” sight I
can see the atmosphere, the currents of air m a room,
and on two or three occasions on waking I have seen
the whole of space before my eyes entirely filled with
tiny geometrical shapes—triangles, oblongs, dia­
monds, circles, squares— and watched them till they
faded out It is said to be a sign of having just
returned from the mental plane, but I have no
evidence to sustain the assertion1 I only know it was
a curious phenomenon which must have some cause
behind it
The etheric aura is visible as a blue-grey mist, pro­
jecting for a distance of about six inches round every
living form. I have seen the “ shadow” of my hand
outside the hand when the latter has on occasion
gone “ dead ” It is interesting to try the experiment
of placing the tips ofthe fingers of both hands within
two inches of each other m a good light against a
dark background and you will quite possibly see the
“mist” between them, and even its formation of
threads, much finer than hairs, streaming from the
finger-tips If you move your hands the “ mist” will
move with them
No doubt it will be remarked: “A natural emana­
tion from the body'” Possibly—whatever it may be
273
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
we may be sure it is “ natural,” though it may not
be entirely physical
The aura of fresh flowers can be very apparent—
not m colour, only as rqpid movement of the
atmosphere, much the same as can be seen rising
from the earth on a very hot day As the flower
withers the aura fades away.
According to the theory with which I am dealing,
the physical and ethenc bodies are of opposite
polarity They consequently hang together The
waste of tissue caused by the usual activities during
the day, transforms the polarity of the physical into
its opposite, and as two bodies of similar polarity are
bound to part, the ethenc leaves the physical, the
astral is freed, and sleep ensues
Dunng the hours of rest and recuperation the
process is reversed, a re-adjustment of polarization
takes place automatically, the bodies re-unite, and
the sleeper awakes
It is said that the polarization of the bodies is
opposite m man and in woman; m the former the
physical body is positive; m the latter negative.
This would perhaps confirm the implications of the
story m Genesis, and might account for the male
being m closer touch with the things of earth It is
often referred to as “ a man’s world,” which up to
the present time it certainly has been. His to deal
with and to conquer, to subdue matter, the thorns
and thistles that were his inheritance outside the
Garden of Eden, and to wrest a livelihood from the
soil, since the days of the Stone Age He gets more
27+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
out of the world than does woman, who has m
consequence been more inclined to keep one eye on
the other world— and hope for the best1
But heredity has been doing its work; confusing
the issues, and by now there must be so much of the
woman in man and of the man in woman that
generalization becomes a stumbling-block and should
be treated cautiously
That intuition at least, has become the heritage
of both sexes was apparently the opimon of a certain
judge when oflering the following advice to a newly
joined colleague on the Bench “ Give your verdict
with confidence, for it is sure to be right; but don’t
give your reasons because they are sure to be
wrong!”
Is it in this difference of polarity that we must look
for a clue to the undue proportion of women as
mediums’* Has the instrument through which man
must make his contacts with dense matter a “ bias”
m the direction of the material, while woman with
a physical body of negative polarity faces toward
the spiritual'*
The last century was pre-eminently a period of
physical achievement Youth to-day, suffering from
the deplorable reactions of the War, attributes
present ills to the errors of its forbears, is inclined
to blame science for the ingenious instruments of
destruction, and its immediate predecessors for
having landed the world m the most prodigious
mess it has ever known.
But, putting aside the fact that every generation
275
THIS WORLD-r-AND BEYOND
has to pay for the sins ofits predecessors, and that the
War was the culmination for which all the generations
of all time were responsible, the young people of
to-day should bear in mind the benefits accruing
to themselves at the present time from the labour
and effort of those fathers and grandfathers.
It was presumably the “job” of the past century
to concern itself mainly with the fuller development
of matter; men’s minds turned naturally toward dis­
covery, invention, the perfecting of things to do with
the physical plane, and a mechanistic outlook leading
to materialism was a natural corollary, And in this
connexion the words of Professor Millikan the
American physicist should not be forgotten— that
for one destructive use to which a scientific discovery
can be put, such as poisons, high explosives, gases
and so on, at least six beneficent uses will be found.
In such conditions, influencing and influenced by
the current trend of thought, it was .only natural
that phenomena of a physical nature should be in
the ascendant rather than those of higher levels.
It is however in the field of mental mediumship that
I believe the future of spiritualism to lie. As a
communicator of some note said to me not long ago:
“ The mental plane is of most importance, where
mind contacts mind. The only real bridge we can
make is through mind.” If carefully tended, weeded
of tares, kept within the sober bounds of reason, in
the hands of spiritualism will lie the salvation of the
world. It is saving the world. It is permeating the
Churches, the world of science, the vast army of the
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
world’s thinkers It is bringing comfort to millions
who had lost their faith; the knowledge of survival
is bringing renewed energy to those who had lost
all hope
There is a vastly greater volume of well-organized,
lucid thought being given out to-day by the brains
of the world than was the case even a few hundred
years ago Man’s intellect, thanks to education and
other factors, can get a grasp on many abstiuse
problems that not so long ago had no meaning for
him An understanding of the properties of the
ether, of the nature of matter, of laws of nature that
have to be dealt with as abstractions, his mind can
now handle as established facts. It was at one time
supposed that any conception of the “fourth dimen­
sion” was and for ever would be, beyond the com­
prehension of the three dimensional brain
But this “ thinking m space,” as it was described
by Sir William Bragg, has enabled the bram of man
to contact higher pinnacles in thought than ever
before Time-space is no longer an empty word to
the ordinary thinker The conception of other
dimensions than those in which we live here is
within the mental giasp of the many to-day As we
have grown and expanded until the hitherto un­
attainable has come within reach, so m the near
future we should be able to make more lofty con­
tacts, and touch still greater heights

THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
murder as damaging to oneselfas to commit it? Why
was the death upon the Cross necessary to appease
God’s anger with the world?—which He had
Himself cieated To a child with any sense of logic,
and most children have an inborn sense of logic and
justice, life was full of whys, which if I did not try
to answer myself, it seemed unlikely would be
answered at all.
If Christ came to fulfil the law, there was surely
the shadow of it behind every word He spoke If we
think murder—tune-in to murderous desire, like
drawing to like, we should find ourselves on the
appropriate level—with murderers, should we pass
over so thinking It is not necessary to have done
murder, Christ told us that It is the attitude of
mind that counts
If we should tune-in to thoughts ofhate, an enemy
likewise attuned, if we have one, and sending out
like vibrations, will attain his reactions and vice
versa But if the consciousness be keyed to a non­
synchronizing wave-length, he can no more affect
us by evil thought than Paris can be contacted by
tumng-in to Berlin I am speaking, of course, of
the mental level; on the physical, there are other
means of self-defence in accord with physical con­
ditions. But those New Testament exhortations
were spoken by One familiar with the fundamental
laws of nature from lowest to highest
And along these lines m the present conception of
matter, as ether m varying rates of rapid vibration,
may we not find a clue to an explanation ofthe death
280
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
upon the Cross which is the keynote of Christian
belief, that will appeal to the reasoning side of man’s
faculties no less than to the devotional. To throw
it aside as spectacular fiction, without historical
justification, to deny it or attempt to explain it away,
which seems to be the tendency of the Church at the
moment, is to beg the question, the last resort of the
great majority who are content to take the line of
least resistance Surely it would be wiser to explore
every possible channel of a possible explanation
before deciding to reject it altogether'*
The prelude to the final sacrifice as foreshadowed
in the story of the Scapegoat given m Leviticus is
at least arresting There is nothing m it to justify
the inference that it was merely typical, and in the
nature of an allegoiy
With much ceremony, intended to prepare minds
at that stage of the world’s evolution easily impressed
by outward ritual, with the priest as medium, sug­
gestion as the means, the “ sins” of the flesh— the
carnal, material impulses—were transferred from
the people to the victim The goat, having become
the focus of the ever-slowing vibrations that lead to
destruction— inertia— was then to be driven forth
into the wilderness, led by the hand of a “fit man”
for the purpose, one may suppose this insistence on a
“ fit man” indicated one whose own spiritual develop­
ment and knowledge were sufficiently advanced to
ensure immunity from contamination by contact
with the more carnal conditions. It is also specified
that the destination of the animal was to be a “land
281 *9
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
not inhabited,” as though the victim had become a
source of danger to society at large, and was to be
isolated from all possible contacts
The priest who had been the medium of the trans­
ference and whose hands had been laid upon the
goat, and the “ fit man” selected for the purpose of
conducting it into the wilderness, were commanded
to go through elaborate processes of purification
before resuming intercourse with their fellow
creatures
Were these meticulous instructions mere empty
words7— play-acting to fool the onlookers7 The
reference to the incident m the epistle to the Hebrews
does not give this impression A “shadow of things
to come” m so much as it was only to a degree effi­
cacious, and had to be continually repeated; this
partial deflection of evil results was all that could be
achieved by the ceremony
But Chnst, a wiling victim, making the supreme
sacrifice, never made before or since by any of
Heaven’s Messengers, with perfect knowledge and
the power that springs from it, was able to contact a
wave-length beyond anything that humanity un­
aided would have been able to reach, and by so
doing “saved the world,” bringing into operation all
the great motive power of love and will In a uni­
verse wherein every manifestation is but a valiant of
vibratory action, He opened once for all the way
through which the retarding vibrations ofa material
world could be deflected into the lme of least re­
sistance, to rebound and react no longei upon the
282
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
conditions of physical matter that had engendered
them; to transmute the energy for evil into an energy
for good In minor degree, a like transmutation of
energy through the triumph of man’s will is going
on around us m everyday life.
The Force that rules the umverse of both matter
and spirit is Love, and its supreme manifestation
appears to be self-sacrifice We do not know what
Love u, we know it only by its works Nor do we
know what electricity is, nor chemical affinity, we
can only recognize them by their results, and it need
not be considered any more fantastic to acknow­
ledge love as a force than these others of equally
enigmatical origin
To “ tune-m” the spirit within Him to the con­
ditions—and the vilest conditions— of densely ma­
terial planes, was to court separation from all that
is spiritual, to sever Himselffrom the Heavenly world
that was His own As the focus of all that was evil
He was hedged round by a bamer of ether obedient
to its law m establishing conditions through which no
finer, no spiritual vibrations could be contacted.
He was placmg Himself voluntarily for the time
being out ofreach of all holy influences.
For the moment He was contacting, through the
operation of eternal law, the lowest Hell— and the
lowest Hell only
That surely was the sacrifice' Not the physical
death upon the Cross suffered by many before and
since, but the transcendent manifestation of the
power of Love that willingly and for man’s sake
283
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
endured temporary exile from Heavenly places, and
that prompted the last despairing c r y “ My God1
My God ! Why hast Thou forsaken Me1
*”
God had m very truth forsaken Him, m touch as
He was with earth and Hell alone ; and tuned-m to
that wave-length, He was carried, m obedience to
law, to the “spirits m prison” to whom He ministered
for three days
And since this great sacrifice that, m the intensified
power of its reaction, made contact with the higher
levels of the spirit and mankind, we are told the way
lies open The law which Christ came to fulfil must
in the ultimate be obeyed, for no one can work
against it without working his own destruction To
understand the law would be to fulfil it Once under­
stood, we keep the physical laws m self-defence, but
m the spiritual kingdom we appear to imagine any
law can be broken with impunity and hope for luck
at the end1
To direct into the channel thus opened, the im­
pulses of the lower self, the temptations of the flesh,
leaving the spiritual m man to rise unimpeded m
ever-subtler vibrations to the Highest of all, requires
more than a passive faith, mil is as potent and neces­
sary a factor and, greatest of all, love—the love that,
acting m the more subtle conditions of higher levels,
as we believe gravitation to act in the physical, can
by the law of attraction bind souls together for all
eternity ; the love that forgets itself, that will sacri­
fice itself for others, that obtains complete mastery
of the flesh ; the love for God and your neighbour—
28+
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
to do good, not m obedience to legislation, not
because it seems advisable, not to appease a pricking
conscience, but because from your heart your chief
desire is to better the condition of those about you;
this being the foundation stone of cosmic evolution
upon which hang “ all the Law and the Prophets 5
5
Ever since the restless days of my early twenties,
that reading of the inner meaning of Christ’s sacri­
fice has been working m my mmd I held fast to an
intuition— and still do so— that a great basic truth,
never expounded by the Church, underlay what has
been called the “vicarious punishment ” That it was
not a punishment, nor an expiation m the accepted
meaning of the term, but a fulfilment of law, neces­
sary to the salvation of the world of matter, and only
possible to the divine knowledge and moral per­
fection of the incarnate Christ
To the expression of this theory and belief, the re­
sult ofthe thought of a lifetime, there is now a sequel
m which some of my readei s may be interested
During the writing of the preceding pages I was
invited to dine with some friends— Sir Wilfrid Laurie
and his sister, Mrs Anderson, after dinner, con­
versation drifted on to this much vexed question of
the so-called “ Atonement ”
After some discussion, during which I put forward
some of the foregoing ideas, Sir Wilfrid said that
through Miss Nina Francis, at the British College
of Psychic Science, he had lately been in com­
munication with “ Imperator,” a name familiar
285
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
to all who have read “ Spirit Teachings” by Stainton
Moses, and Mr. Trethewy’s analytical work m con­
nexion with it
Sir Wilfrid most kindly suggested I should be
present at his next sitting, and should ask “ Im-
perator” for his opinion on this subject— an offer
which I accepted with enthusiasm
The report of the sitting, which was taken down
by a stenographer, present with Sir Wilfrid and my­
self, and which proved to be of great interest—in
spite of the oft-repeated statement that nothing but
trivialities is ever obtained from the next plane!— I
give as concisely as possible
“Imperator” took direct control of the medium
almost immediately and Sir Wilfrid having intro­
duced me, put the following question to him
“In your book, when asked about the ‘Atonement,’
you have said m a sense it is true. Then you go on
to deny the vicarious sacrifice theory I want to
know in what sense His death could be an atonement
for sm Mrs de Crespigny also has a question on
this theory ”
Imperator. Let me get that very clearly You
desire to know m what way the death, or shall we say
the sacrifice of the Great Master influenced
humamty?
Sir Wilfrid. What good it did to humanity!
Imperator. I find a little difficulty in expressing
myself this mormng (this was afterwards explained
on the score of mixed vibrations) If it had not been
for this apparent sacrifice, the Christian religion, as
286
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
it is called, would not be as it is to-day I wonder if
you follow me^
Sir Wtlfrtd O f course it was a great advertise­
ment for the Christian religion It drew attention
to it
Imperator I would not call it advertisement
Sir Wilfnd I am putting it plainly I understand
the effect it would have on posterity—that His death
would draw attention, that He sacrificed His life as
any other martyr might, for His faith?
Imperator Do you not think that those perhaps
who understood Him a little better, would realize
the greatness behind it all— a man who could appar­
ently have saved Himself—because you know He
could1 You do realize that, don’t you?
Mrs de C I will, if I may, say what my idea is.
The death on the Cross, although not an atonement
nor a vicarious expiation, saved the world in this
way We are m human bodies and each one is a
focus for good or evil
Imperator • That is right.
Mrs de C And surely that story of the Scape­
goat m Leviticus was not merely an ornamental way
of talking7 It was true In Christ’s final sacrifice he
tuned-m to the low and carnal vibrations generated
all through the world’s evolution, and that were
gradually acquiring such momentum that they were
carrying the world down to inertia which is destruc­
tion so far as matter is concerned, Christ made
Himself into a transmuting station
(I heregaveas concise a review aspossible ofwhat I
287
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
have writtenin theearlierpart ofthis Chapter,finishing
on the note that Christ made contact with certain wave­
lengths whch humanity would never have been able to
contactthrough theirownunaidedefforts)
Imperator Only He could have done it Yes, yes
You have given me food for thought But I would
like to think it over a little before I say whether I
truly beheve it m your way or not; because that has
not been exactly my point of view, but there is a
great deal m what you say O f course, only He m
His divinity, His greatness could-----
Mrs de C Could make the necessary contact
Imperator' Would you come and see me again,
because it is a new point of view.
Mrs de C.. Indeed I will.
Imperator You have certainly put it in a way
which I had not considered before Hence my Book
You know it is not quite the same idea
Sir Wilfrid No, you do not express that idea m
your book
Imperator But we are always ready to learn, you
know
Mrs de C I think it is wonderful of you to say
that
Imperator: No, oh no1 (A pause ) It would give
a very different construction to the whole thing On
the other hand, is there not really the fear that
humanity may dwell too much on the fact that there
is One who can take their sms upon His shoulders
and so relieve them of the responsibility?
Mrs. de C But may I say that I don’t think they
288
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
can? He made Himself into a transmuting station
and said, “ Cast your sins upon my shoulders ” We
have to “tune-m” voluntarily to the wave-length He
has contacted; it is for us to do the casting— no easy
task1
Imperator. O f course that is so That would illu­
mine that Yes I think, you know, that you have
given me something which I would hke to work upon,
and I would hke to alter a little of what I have said
perhaps But let me think it over because, to me, it
is rather new You will think it strange that one
should not change all these thousands of years'
Mrs deC.. I don’t know enough about it I don’t
know enough about the conditions or-----
Imperator If one has been quite certain of one’s
own ideas, outlook—it remains with one, and they
become shall we say, more definite
Mrs. de C The preconceived idea is a terrible
obstacle sometimes
Imperator• It is. That is why I want time to think
this out. But I am grateful, because maybe you are
right But I would not say yet. You will forgive me
— yes? I am sorry—I want to think it out first Now
you will come and see me again and I will tell you
then, because I want to speak also to others on the
subject, to see what they think
Mrs de C Thank you very much indeed
Imperator I may even be able to get into nearer
contact with the Jesus of Nazareth Himself, that I
cannot say, but I may We have means, and we are
allowed, if it is really for a good and necessary pur-
289
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
pose, and I think I may be allowed m this case If
I can I will surely let you know If I find I agree
with you, then I want the correction to be made
public, please Ah yes—I do not want error to go to
the world None of us, you know And if I find I
have made an error I want it put right before the
world, and you will help me to do so
Mrs de C O f course I will I am putting this
theory into a book because it has been so near my
heart all my life and it is so difficult to get people to
listen.
Imperator Perhaps if you will allow me, when you
are writing your book, also to look at it through your
eyes, then maybe I shall understand it better I will
stand by you while you write
Mrs de C Indeed I do thank you very much, and
my friend, Sir Wilfrid, for having introduced me to
you
Sir Wilfrid I felt it would be very interesting to
hear what you two could have to say on the subject,
because it has always puzzled me very much.
Imperator And shall we say, too, that this is prob­
ably the moment in which we had to meet for greater
purposes than we realize?
Mrs deC . I would hke to think so indeed
Sir Wilfrid You mean that the meeting was what
we call providential?
Imperator There is nothing left to chance, as Mrs.
de Crespigny knows (he called me by another name).
There is no chance This was to be And I am going
to give it, I assure you, my most earnest attention,
290
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and will also try to get into contact with those that
might help me— and when we meet again I will be
able to give you an answer.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
T
HAT sitting took place onJanuary 25th, 1934,
and on February 23rd, Colonel N P. Clarke,
who is a member of the British College of Psychic
Science, brought me the following message, which
had been given to him at a sitting with Miss
Francis
The communicator purported to be J Hewat
McKenzie, who said he was the bearer of a message
to me— mentioning me by name—from “ Imperator ”
Colonel Clarke was told to write the name down,
which he did.
The message was to the effect that “ Imperator”
wished to speak to me alone He wished to talk
about the book I was writing. He explained that I
had previously been at a séance with two other
people and the mixture of vibrations caused a clash
So he wished me to come alone m order to talk about
the book I was engaged on at the moment There­
fore on March 2nd I arranged to have a sitting with
Miss Francis “ Imperator” took control—m a
manner quite different from “ Lucio,” her usual con­
trol— and greeted me with a text from Malachi,
which unfortunately I did not take down at the time
He explained that the clash of vibrations had
interfered with his flow of thought and speech on

the previous occasion, but that with himself and me
alone it would be much easier
I was prepared to be told my theories were all
wrong, and to be “let down” as gently as possible1
So my surprise and pleasure was the greater at his
opening words
Imperator; “ Your outlook on this subject is
right—and always has been I have been talking to
many who can judge There are two great powers,
Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, and the
former must prevail eventually It is true that
Lucifer fights on the side of Evil The great Lord of
Hosts— the Christ— became incarnate m order to
contact Himself the powers of Evil, for all effort, all
dominance must come through the physical to the
spiritual Jesus of Nazareth was truly the divine
Son of the divine Father He knew He was the
Messenger He took on Himself deliberately the
flesh to prepare the way, m order to contact the
carnal and material vibrations of earth that enabled
Him to penetrate into the bowels of Hell, and in the
reaction to contact still higher vibrations—to put the
world in touch with more spiritual levels than man
of himself would have been able to achieve You
have there the true light— and I agree * You may put
my name to it I have talked about it with many
over here
“ Children of the Lord are apt to make no effort—
to sit and wait. But true salvation can only be had
by following in the path He opened—you speak m
wave-lengths— that is true— all has Law behind it
793
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
He prepared the way—contacted vibrations that
are a link between God and His children In this
meaning He is the only way—the law He preached
and died to put into operation is the only way—
there is but the one law Self-sacrifice is the expres­
sion of it—love to God and your neighbour—it is
theLaw Many others helped —the great Teachers—
but none but Christ died to save the world That
was why preparation was required He took on the
physical to make the true contact God has never
been tangible—never more than what must be called
a myth Christ was a demonstration of the Godhead
here on earth
“ Christ is with you now—on this physical earth
—in your midst Much will be swept away—but
Christ will remain.”
And so ended—to me— a most wonderful ex­
perience It is known that “Imperatoi” is alleged
to be the Prophet Malachi He confirmed it, and
gave me permission to say so With regard to the
matters we had been talking about he made an
interesting remark.
“You must remember,” he said, “you are living
m a more enlightened age than I did. You can
look back—we could not, there was so little behmd
us You have history and tradition to build on ”
And there, as I thought, the episode closed
But while lately visiting the Edinburgh College of
Psychic Science, there was a sequel, putting as it
were the final touches to as good a piece of evidence
294-
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
as I ever hope to obtain, quite apart fiom the value
ofthe content ofthe message Considering the nature
of the subject matter and its quality, it came through
the most unlikely of mediums— Mrs Duncan, for
psychical phenomena do not as a rule stray into the
realm of the mental
She announced before the sitting that her control
“Albert” had been arranging something specially
for my benefit, but had said nothing of the line m
which it was to run I therefore imagined something
evidential in the shape of a materialized figure which
might be recognizable— which subsequently did
take place— a half-brother of mine showed himself
fully materialized outside the cabinet, gave his name
and the manner of his death at the age of mneteen,
but as it was not the point of interest that evening I
will not dwell upon it further
Having gone through the usual preliminaries, a
personal examination and search of the cabinet, we
sat m a semi-circle of eight persons, in a really good
red light, in the stance-room at the Edinburgh
Psychic College, at the top of the house.
“Albert’s” voice, pleasantly modulated m good
English, was heard almost immediately, and several
materialized figures, including the one already men­
tioned, succeeded one another, coming out of the
cabinet into the centre of the circle “ Peggy” was
among them, and she sent a special message to
Mr Barbanell of the Psychic News, the context of
which I did not understand, but faithfully delivered
But the “ evidence” which had been pre-arranged
295
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and concerned myself, lay in the appearance of a
slim and graceful form who walked out of the cabinet
and across the circle m full view of us all. She
claimed to be the sister of one of the sitters, Mr
Scott, who acknowledged the claim.
I was writing the last chapters of this book at the
time, and had shortly before finished the account of
my discussion with “ Imperator,” which I had not
mentioned to anyone I give the following account as
I wrote it down at the time, and which was signed
by six of the persons present as correct The other
two were not available
Mr Scott put a question to the materialized form
of his sister concerning the Holy Communion After
she had answered it, she turned directly in my
direction, to my great surprise, and asked for my
opinion She then, to my still greater surprise,
broached the subject of the “Atonement” and pro­
ceeded to discuss the subject with me on the lines I
had so recently been engaged on m writing this
book. No one present knew I was writing about it,
nor could have had any understandmg of the refer­
ences made I may add that, so far as the medium is
concerned, the whole tenor ofthe conversation would
have been “Greek” to her
I asked the materialized form how she knew about
my interest m the subject
She said she had stood by my table while I was
writing, m my house in London (meaning the
British College m Qpeen’s Gate), and proceeded
to describe accurately the position of my table as
296
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
standing across the comer of my room; that there
was a window opening like a door close to it, with
some plants in the window She also described a
green carpet, which I denied— until I remembered
that the present carpet had replaced a wide strip
of bright green which had been there until quite
lately I asked if she knew “ Imperator ”
She answered “ yes”— she had seen him standing
beside my table while I was writing

Mrs Duncan has never been m my 100m at the
College. O f “ Imperator” I had spoken to no one,
nor of his promise “ to stand by me as I wrote;”
yet the answer to my question was that she had seen
him standing by my table while I was writing
If such evidence can be explained away, then
indeed not only Heaven but earth itself can be
explained away1 The subconscious mind, hallucina­
tion, self-deception, telepathy, are little more than
words, and if they were would not fill the bill in
such instances Hypnotism, individual and collec­
tive, can be quoted light-heartedly as an answer to
the riddle, but what is hypnotism? The action of
mind on mind, and through mind on matter— but
how is it donep It is no more than a word when
applied to some of the wonders of the siance-room
and outside it.

The weapons m the sceptic’s armouiy are showing
signs of wear, due possibly to over-use m directions
for which they aie not really fitted Some of them
are worn out, all require looking to The handbooks
of the scientist come and go, and will continue to
come and go, but the Bible stands, with truth as its
foundation stone, waiting its time throughout the
ages, always ready to unlock the doors of its
treasure house to those who knock, to all who are
not content to take the world at its face value, or to
drift along m the ruts carved by tradition and
authority without question or desire for further
knowledge.
Why should it be so hard m this day of marvels to
believe m this other world to the existence of which
there is so great a cloud of witnesses Why should
the evidence, increasing daily, be so difficult to
accept— at the least by minds already professing
to believe m survival? Have they really believed m a
world of winged angels, of harps and never-ceasing
hymns of praise ■’ If they could believe in that world,
so far beyond their understanding, surely it should be
easier to believe m a world within it?
Every fresh advance m scientific knowledge of late
years has driven a nail into the coffin of materialism,
for those who have eyes to see or ears to hear. To
deny an Intelligence behmd the universe is no
longer common sense—it is scarcely sane1
Apart from the wonder ofthe stars in their courses,
ofthe planets that hang like lamps m space on a clear
night, which we have always had with us, what of
298
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
this universe, of systems, of forces, that have been
brought within our knowledge to-day? O f worlds
governed by law and order on a scale so vast, so
minute m its detail that it arouses m man’s mind
awe rather than comprehension
Worlds regulated by apportioned “ wave-lengths,”
governed by forces held m leash, to each of which
has gone forth the command: “Thus far shalt thou
go and no farther
Many worlds there are— of sound, of light, of
electricity, of radio-activity, to mention some of
them, each working on its own wave-length,
bounded by its apportioned limitations— a wave­
length, secure from promiscuous interference from
without, carrying with it inherent inhibitions for the
prevention of unauthorized excursions from within
Worlds of which we are unaware until with the
appropriate key we are able to open the door; so
faithfully guarded by the Angel with the flaming
sword until man was fitted to come mto his heritage
Picture the confusion, beyond the brain of man to
imagine, of nature’s forces running riot1
Could so magnificent and ordered a scheme have
been the child of chaos?
It may be that in the future stages of evolution,
spiritualism will have an important part to play;
that within it lie potentialities but little dreamed
of, resulting m a permeating of matter by spirit
through the constant linking up of the two planes,
involving processes of far greater import than the
sifting of creeds or philosophies.
299
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
The opening chapter of Genesis records how the
first contacts between matter and spirit—or con­
sciousness— were made From that initial movement
of the ether caused by energy which resulted in
physical matter as we know it to-day, land and
water had evolved but not life at the moment we
read that “the spirit of God moved over the face of
the waters ” With the help of modern science the
imagination can conjure a picture of the spirit of
God waiting, watching for the moment when the
gulf would be bridged, when a contact could be
made, and spirit—the higher aspect of the Deity—
could “ tune-m” to the vibration of the lower aspect
— matter, and obtain a reaction
Then and then only, when such contact became
possible, the one-celled prohst came into existence;
life appeared on earth, no germ bred of surrounding
conditions, no vagrant seed dropped by plant or
meteor; but a sudden impulse due to contact made
with some wave-length, some electrical stimulus
until then out of reach And with the contact the
descent ofspirit into matter became an accomplished
fact.
Long ages had to run before matter was ready for
the next great contact—«//^consciousness, and the
further step which was to transform man from a mere
puppet into a responsible creature endowed with a
small degree of free-will and the potentiality to
win it in full measure—with an intellect and a
brain that would enable him to carry on the task
of the spiritualization of matter—if it may be so
300
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
termed— through the processes of thought and will­
power.
It may be that the brain, working as a transformer,
will eventually raise matter, the lower aspect of
spirit, into the higher, through these mental pro­
cesses, permeating the physical globe with the higher
vibrations of the thought plane, and thereby fulfil
the mam aim of evolution to the full, and that
this transmutation will continue until the material
particles of this planet become spiritualized— the
present “Jerusalem” merged m the New, then
indeed will the Holy City be within sight and sound
of all
At a later sitting with a direct-voice medium, this
idea was referred to by a communicator interested m
the subject, who said: “The two worlds will merge
by a bridging of wave-lengths. We are working at
that now It will bring peace The two worlds will
merge into one, and sorrow and pam will cease ”
And m this process pf the “ spiritualization” of
matter, what is called Spiritualism is surely playing
its part In demonstrating the truth of survival and
opemng up communication with those on higher
levels of consciousness, it will have been an aU-
unportant factor in establishing the final contact
with the planes above; for with the opportunities
it affords for guidance from thosewho are more far-
seeing than ourselves, it should lead the world, not
only to think but to think rightly, permeating and
influencing the thoughts and actions of statesmen,
the Church and men of Science As ever, this great
301
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
contact which has opened to us the door of the other
world, could not have been made m full measure
until mankind was ready to receive it—keyed up
through the slow processes of evolution to the neces­
sary pitch.
But, once established, the continual interchange of
vibratory forces, back and forth between ourselves
and the higher levels of consciousness, must surely
have its effect in lifting the physical to something
nearer to the spiritual until eventually the whole
becomes leavened, and finally when man, thiough
the action of his will and his brain, has completed
the transmutation of matter, this physical plane
merged in the next, there will be “ a new Heaven and
a new Earth,” for the first Heaven and the first
Earth will have passed away, and man will have
made one more step towaid that higher world oi
spirituality to which the psychic planes are but the
ante-room
For true spiritual contacts arc dependent upon
neither medium nor stance-room
They lie between man and his Maker, without
bar or intermediary—spirit calling to the Source
whence it came— in the silence, in the market­
place, in the temple, will rise unhindered on the
wings of its own earnest desire and find expression
in prayer or praise.
But to make conscious contact, of mind with the
spirit that isyou, like all else worth while, does not
come easily, but as the result of years of effort.
A realization of the spirit present within the body
302
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
through which it functions, is a different matter
from an intellectual belief The contact ofyour own
awareness, must be preceded by years of concentra­
tion, of holding the idea of the inner self— m the
silence. To touch the knowledge— fleetingly—that
the very awareness that you are you— is you, is to
understand the mind of Socrates, threatened with
untold ills at the hand of his enemies, when he said :
“they have to catch me first
You can contact thejot/ within— hold it for a fleet­
ing moment—lose it;— but once touched, once
realized, you know for ever that the spirit within that
is you—is of God— a part of His consciousness—in­
destructible, immortal, and one with the conscious­
ness of every other living soul
In Cogito ergo sum Descartes epitomized this
realization of the awareness that is the self
Words in such contexts aie unavailing, nor will
they ring convincingly to other minds Each of us
must probe and experience for himself; each of us
may, if he will, weave a thread into the pattern of
the universe that may help to make the whole more
intelligible
O f the meaning of the suffering, the partings, the
tears so unavailing, we shall some day perhaps under­
stand more of the scheme in which each of us
willingly or unwillingly has played a part. Does
the key to the secret lie in the fourteenth Chapter of
Revelation in the words
“ And I heard a voice from Heaven, as the voice of
many waters, and as the voice of a greaf thunder :
303
THIS WORLD— AND BEYOND
and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their
harps
“And they sung as it were a new song before the
throne . . and no man could learn that song but
the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
were redeemed from the earth ”
No one can learn that song— can “trune-in” to the
wave-length— except those who have gone through
the griefand suffering oflife on earth, and the repres­
sions of self-control
And surely the keynote of its melody must be—
that there is no death1 That the grave has an empty
victory, and that we should grasp this blessed know­
ledge of survival with both hands—the great Truth
that has come to us m part through Science, in part
through Religion—but for the most part through
the divine Force that inspires the worlds that are,
and are to come— Love
