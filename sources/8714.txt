  		      5118.    Michele C NDE     12/29/2022.      NDE 9505.       From Italy.  Original in Italian, translated to English by Amy     I was in an absolute state of serenity, never before felt on earth. I distinctly saw my body and all my loved ones, or rather the ones who were part of my nuclear family. I had the gift of being everywhere at once. I saw my mother, my grandmother and my sister, all in despair. I would have liked to tell them to not worry since I was feeling wonderful. At the same time, I saw my father at work. He was  being advised by someone running beside the ambulance.  
  NDE due to unspecified life-threatening event at age 10.   

  5117.    Sanna F SDE     12/29/2022.      SDE 9509.       Exceptional Experience.     I believe I said, "She is seeing God!". My sister and cousin could not move as they just started in amazement. I felt compelled to get my mother and uncle who were in the kitchen to come and see what we were witnessing. They returned with me quickly. A total of 5 family members were beside my grandmother's bed as she was dying. Her eyes remained fixed on something above her as though she was receiving a message. Some sort of light (either from within or reflecting from her) was illuminating her eyes.  
  Remarkable shared death experience with five family members present with the dying.   

    5116.    Mahala S STE     12/29/2022.      STE 9508.       From Denmark     After a while, Jesus came to get me. He and I went outside in what looked like a courtyard with pillars. We sat down on a little fountain and he gave me gifts; toys I had as a kid. I became so full of joy to see them again and to see the marks I had made on them while using them. The marks were still there.  This realization confirmed to me that it was the same toys I'd once owned. He laughed aloud. The town looked like a mix of ancient Greece and heaven.  I didn't see mansions, but it looked like everything my heart truly longed for.
  Remarkably detailed STE at age 14.   

        5115.    Lena S Anesthesia     12/28/2022.      Anesthesia 9507.       From Russia.  Translated to English by Jim.     I didn’t feel anything, I didn’t even hear that the doctor was calling to me to make sure I was out, as I did at my first colonoscopy. I remember a dream -  a girl in a blue shirt is lying on a table, it’s all white around her, and someone says "Lena, wake up!" This was repeated around four times. And at this point I think "Well, I need to see the rest of it, I need to see whether or not she wakes up!” I saw two women from above, and one of them said "I don’t understand why she’s not waking up!" At this point I woke up. Before the procedure they had given me a blue shirt, but I had not seen myself in it since I had not gone to the mirror. It was only when I woke up that I realized that the girl was me.  
  Anesthesia Experience.   

      5114.    Doug C NDE     12/20/2022.      NDE 9502.       Exceptional Experience.     I also remember being amazed that my sense of humor was still intact, and that I was still "ME" in this other place. I remember feeling so good and so light with no cares at all. I felt like I was finally going home and immediately was experiencing a presence through my being that I was communicating with instantly. It said to me first "Dont worry, we've got ya". Every thought I had was instantly answered as soon as I thought it. Time seemed to be irrelevant and I didn't care because I was enveloped in a blanket of what I could only describe as pure love and acceptance.  
  Exceptional NDE due to head trauma.   

    5113.    Christopher C NDEs     12/19/2022.      NDEs;Drug Experiences 9501.       From United Kingdom     Emotionally I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and comfort; it was a beautiful and ecstatic feeling and very calm and serene. It felt very natural. My mind was more clear and more lucid than it had ever been. The next part is tough to put into words. I don't know if I received new information or if, in this otherwordly state, I could see and comprehend things that I already knew, but I realized that I knew the answer to everything. I knew what we are, where we came from, and what the universe is.  
  Two NDEs described.  One NDE due to heroin overdose.  Another NDE after ingesting alcohol and ketamine.   

    5112.    Richard S NDE     12/19/2022.      NDE 9500.            Then, I became part of something I can’t fully describe. I had no more pain. I was euphoric and had no anxiety. I knew I had died and I was very happy!  
  NDE due to shock from receiving excessively hot IV fluid.   

      5111.    Jeanne H NDE     12/18/2022.      NDE 9498.       From United Kingdom     I had a two-year-old son and was giving birth to a much-wanted second son. I just knew everything would be ok. I thought about what it would be like not to go back and I knew that everything and everyone would be fine. It was then that I looked to my side to see an angelic presence.  
  NDE during childbirth.   

    5110.    Joshua G NDE     12/18/2022.      NDE 9499.       From Australia     I found myself standing in the middle of a crowded path. There were men, women, and children of various backgrounds. In the distance, I saw the skyline of a city with tall, shiny, silver skyscrapers surrounded by mountains. To my right, there was a large blue lake and green grass, bushes, and shrubs. The path was lined with glass-paneled railings made of bronze-colored stone.  
  NDE due to alcohol overdose.   

      5109.    Jim H NDE     12/6/2022.      NDE 16128.           The black and white spiral was indicative of life leaving my body. It was very fast, was a white spiral in background and the corkscrew part was the black outline of the coiled sight and feeling.  Yes, the phenomenon was both felt and seen. The feeling was one of deflating like a balloon when the end is released by a child seeking flight.  I sensed the life being sucked out of me. The downward trajectory led me to the black triangle. Also, I felt a concentrated headache on the left side; a very unusual experience. My left brain was blacking out.  What I saw was a descent like falling down a mountain crevice or dropping off a tall structure.  The experience was taking me away from reality and heading toward point zero of the spiral.
  NDE from cardiac arrest a couple months ago.   

    5108.    Jayne J Probable NDE     12/4/2022.      Probable NDE 9494.       From United Kingdom     I could see the edge of a bed or platform slightly lit by the light. I suddenly thought, 'Oh, I’m dying.' I realized that I felt ok with dying. I was very calm and wasn't afraid. Suddenly, I was worried who would tell my daughter and son that I was ok with dying. I was moving towards the end of the tunnel and knew that reaching the end meant death for me.
  Probable NDE during surgery for apparent femoral artery surgery.   

    5107.    Iain T NDE     12/3/2022.      NDE 9495.            I was greeted by a strange, robed figure who led me down a path to a field. Numerous people were sitting there. I recognized my grandmother, great aunt, and a close family friend. All of them had died when I was younger. I ask the robed figure, "Who are you?" Instead of getting an answer, everyone else was asking me what I was doing there so early. I replied, "I don't know." 
  Remarkable NDE occurring during unconsciousness following two planes colliding near him on 7/17/22 (NDERF: https://news3lv.com/news/local/planes-were-approaching-for-landing-at-north-las-vegas-airport-before-crash-that-killed-4-ntsb-federal-investigators-nlv-southern-nevada-air-traffic-control).   

    5106.    Susan H NDE     12/1/2022.      NDE 9492.       From Australia     I clearly remember a feeling that I was in a tunnel. I was floating towards a light that was getting larger the closer I got to it. I felt very relaxed. But, I also remember becoming increasingly annoyed as the nurse kept calling out to me and telling me to come back. Although I was annoyed at being disturbed,  I listened to her. 
  NDE due to allergic reaction.   

    5105.    Kelly G Other     11/27/2022.      Other;Life-threatening 23506.            I believe that "upper" part is the part of my brain involved in connecting with the Divine. My "lower" brain retains a great deal of my intelligence, but is somewhat slower, and my memory isn't so great, especially when I'm under stress. I can feel sad, angry, and scared, but Happiness is rare. I compare it to the corona of a solar eclipse - I can feel the edges of joy, but the full burst of it remains hidden from me… Medical science doesn't acknowledge mystical experience, so doesn't think I have any impairment since I still test well cognitively.  
  Ruptured brain aneurysm.  Following this, sense of reduced spiritual awareness/connection.  Important experience in the consideration of awareness of spirituality and consciousness.   

      5104.    Anita B NDE     11/27/2022.      NDE 9491.            I had the sensation of "floating" above the operating table.  I very calmly watched all the surgical personnel being upset.  I heard a nurse yell out "We almost lost her" and I came back.  
  Brief NDE during surgery.   

    5103.    Andrea G FDE     11/27/2022.      FDE 9490.       From United Kingdom     I was above the car. I remember thinking, 'I’m glad mum can’t see this as she hates going backwards.' I looked down at something and realized it was me. My eyes were open and my face was white. I think I must have come back to my body then. 
  FDE due to car accident with being struck in the rear of their car, then dragged by a large truck.   

    5102.    Chris C NDE     11/27/2022.      NDE 9489.       Originally from the United Kingdom, now living in China.     I was suddenly in this other dimension.  There was no experience of going there, nor any memory of where I'd come from. It felt like I was floating in a soft, warm void. It was a dark, faintly-glowing, soft, and shaded space. I can't really describe any particular feature, and nor did I feel like I had a body.  I was just there; it was utterly peaceful and comfortable. 
  NDE at age 11 from playing dangerous childhood ‘game’ to induce unconsciousness.   

    5101.    Ricky C Probable NDE     11/27/2022.      Probable NDE 9488.       From United Kingdom     I was in darkness. It felt like I entered a new dimension or another realm. My future life was shown to me.  I was shown the changes I need to improve myself to make sure I led a safe and healthy life. It was a really intense dream state.  I truly believe I was quantum hifting in that moment.
  Probable NDE due to being struck by car.   

    5100.    Tina K Probable NDE     11/11/2022.      Probable NDE 9484.            I was taken to see Jesus and remember feeling like I was getting ready to see a famous rockstar. I was so nervous. I remember feeling embarrassed because I did not lead more people to God's word or even pray very much. Jesus told me that he understands the distractions of earth. I promised him I would do better. My family and friend beings asked if I was ready to go back. I remember saying "no." 
  Probable NDE associated with nitrous oxide for dental procedure.   

    5099.    Jillian C NDE     11/11/2022.      NDE and Possible NDE 9483.            I am transported out of my body and surrounded by the brightest warmest light ever.  The only way to explain it is our true home it felt very familiar it felt like home.  I had never felt at "home" here on earth before or after this experience.  I didn't feel or see my body I believe I was more like pure light source that just flows like a river pure love and joy.  I was just so happy to be home.  
  NDE due to apparent electrocution at age 7.  Possible NDE at age 25 associated with apparent alcohol overdose and possible drowning.   

    5098.    Deanna R NDE     11/9/2022.      NDE & ADC 9479.            I looked over Jesus’ left shoulder to a door. The door looked like a wooden swinging door at a restaurant. Coming through the door was my father; my sweet dad who had died many years before at the age of 57 from a massive heart attack in his sleep. He looked so amazing. He was beautiful, glowing, happy, and restored to good health. When my eyes locked onto his, I felt the most amazing feeling of love. I have NEVER felt that kind of love on Earth from anyone. I felt love wash over me, and over every single cell in my body all at once. The light had the most amazing, pure love with light and warmth to it. As he came through the door, I glimpsed a glowing, bright light behind the door. 
  NDE due to heart failure.  Encounter with Jesus and deceased father.  ADC from person who died in a different part of the hospital.   

    5097.    Colecia W NDE     11/9/2022.      NDE 9478.            I was coming out of myself and it felt like I was underwater. I didn't realize I was dying until I tried to breathe and  couldn't do it. I was lying down. When I sat up and  turned around, I saw myself still lying there.   
  Brief NDE due to auto accident.   

    5096.    Jacqueline C Possible NDE     11/7/2022.      Possible NDE;Drug Experience 9480.            I could see a thin silver, shining thread/cord of light coming from my body. As I watched the thread, I noticed that I could feel it taking my spirit out of my body. After watching for a few more minutes, I finally realized that I didn't want to go. As I started to stand up, the string floated away from my body and disappeared into thin air. 
  Possible NDE due to potential accidental narcotic overdose.   

    5095.    Melinda C NDE     10/30/2022.      NDE;Drug Experience 9477.            My father was with me. His presence was so reassuring and I knew that he had been watching over me, protecting me, and giving me signs/clues about when to get out over the years so that I wouldn’t get hurt. I felt the warm embrace of my grandfather and other loved ones who had passed over. It was more like our energies mingling or combining. I was filled with love and no feelings of guilt for who I was in my earthly life or any of my weaknesses. I was told by an entity that they needed me to go back. My family would suffer too much of they lost me. I “knew” they would help me out of my situation and lead me into another life that would be fitting for me.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt with medication overdose.   

    5094.    Zhenya T NDE     10/30/2022.      NDE;Drug Experience 9476.       From Russia     I remember being in a white void; which reminds me of Aleph, Ein Sof, a "space" where everything and nothing exists. It is just pure existence. I remember being scared after realizing I couldn't think with words except for animalistic concepts. I didn't really have a local position in this space, there was no point of relativity, and no location to set myself to. I think I was as much the space itself as I was in this space. 
  NDE with atypical content.   
  
    5093.    Bahar Y NDE     10/30/2022.      NDE 9475.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     Then I could see from above my body how my teacher was swimming towards me.  She pulled me out and put me on the floor. All the children had been standing around. I didn't think about anything and didn't feel any sadness, fear, or bliss. Unfortunately, I also didn't see relatives or other light beings. I also didn't see a tunnel or anything else that other's describe.  I only watched while I was out of body, that's all.  
  NDE around age 4 or 5 due to drowning.   

    5092.    Nicholas G NDE     10/27/2022.      NDE 9474.            The only thing I focused on was the light and God. I kept repeating “God, God, God” to focus my thoughts as I traveled. The tunnel walls were pure black with a beautiful gold light pulsating through and encircling the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was a brilliant, golden light. As I began to travel through the tunnel, I came to the realization that my body was nearing its end. Although I was still strongly aware of my body and its dire situation, I resolved to continue through the tunnel to the end of it.  
  NDE due to cystic fibrosis and difficulty breathing.  Experience shared less than two weeks after it occurred.   

    5091.    Cynthia D STE     10/24/2022.      STE 9472.            Then I was in the most beautiful, brightest, and indescribable place. I knew immediately that I was Heaven. The music was so beautiful. There were gorgeous golden waterfalls shining so brightly. Angels were all around, singing in a tone that is not of this earth. (I’m getting tears writing this all down.) Everything was paved in the most beautiful, golden light. The love I felt there, was unlike any love on this earth.  
  STE that is very NDE-like.   

    5090.    Dr. Phil P FDE and NDE     10/24/2022.      FDE and NDE 9471.       Exceptional experience from Austria.     I feel my life is connected with all life on this earth. I see countless communicating crystals shining and flashing in different colors. Everywhere it sparkles and flashes as if this earth's life would also fight for its survival against the final darkening.  
  Remarkably detailed FDE preceding an NDE.  In FDE, life review memories help him know what to do to survive the car crash leading to the NDE.   

    5089.    Mary G Probable NDE     10/17/2022.      Probable NDE 9469.        From Venezuela.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Camille.    I felt that I was hurled backwards at an incredible speed, and I then abruptly found myself in a beautiful landscape full of flowers. It was huge and I wondered where I was; I could see on every side, and everything was pure nature, with flowers of all kinds of colors; it was a really beautiful place. After a while, I felt that I hurled out again, but forward this time.  
  Probable NDE during anesthesia procedure.   

    5088.    Renata D NDE     10/13/2022.      NDE 9465.            At that same time, I will never forget the bright, white, and yellow light that illuminated everywhere.  I was told it wasn't my time by what I believed to have been Jesus.  I have never felt the most peace, calm, or tranquility in my whole life as I did then.  
  NDE due to motorcycle accident.   

    5087.    Dono J NDE     10/13/2022.      NDE 9464.            It was like a "pop" accompanied by a very loud "whooshing" noise.  I flew up at an incredible speed and could see my body lying still on the mattress.  I also heard what I described later as the sound of wild animals, like a horse or something.  Anyway, when I "arrived" I was in a very dark place.  
  Brief NDE due to a seizure at age 11.   

    5086.    Carmie S STE     10/11/2022.      STE;FDE 9461.            I believed this was the voice of God. He asked me three questions. His first question was, 'Do you understand what is happening to you?' I thought I had died and this was God speaking to me, so I answered, 'yes'. His second question was 'Do you understand the consequences of your sins?' Because I only saw how I was hurting others and believing this was God judging me, I answered 'yes.' I assumed that I was going to be sent to hell based on the life review. The final question was, 'Do you understand you will be eternally separated from your children?'  
  STE/FDE with hellish content.   
  
    5085.    Sandra E NDE-like     10/7/2022.      NDE-Like; STE 9460.            I focused on that star wondering why it was so bright. In an instant the star and I raced together. The star stopped in front of me. It was the brightest light I’d ever seen. I was surrounded by unconditional love that permeated through everything. Then a tunnel formed. There was a presence of a being. Telepathically, I was told that the being was "the guardian." It had no gender. In fact, I learned there is no gender on other side. We are all equal and have talents. We can do things over there we can’t do here.   
  STE associated with meditation.   

    5084.    Kavis NDE     10/7/2022.      NDE 9459.            The feeling I had before. That feeling of being alive to do something was the strongest feeling I’ve ever felt to date. So while I was trying to be pulled up with such force, I fought against going with every fiber of my being. I didn’t see any beings. I can’t say I saw God. But I can say when I looked back, although no words were ever spoke, almost as if telepathic, I was told if I let go I wouldn’t be in pain anymore. I would know peace. I would be free.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    5083.    Kathleen SDE     10/3/2022.      SDE 9457.       Exceptional Experience.     The intense love being expressed through my heart while simultaneously hearing the thought, “I love him”, was so intense.  I felt what I would describe as being crippled in love and awe. It was both an emotional and physical experience.  I felt as if I was tilting my head into my left shoulder in awe, like one would do when witnessing the most innocent and beautiful thing you could ever imagine, while at the same time...my heart just swelled in love.  
  Exceptional and detailed shared death experience with father who died at the same time, although she did not know he was dying.   

  5082.    Lisa R NDE     9/27/2022.      NDE 9456.            I tell him that it feels like time has stopped and that I have been here for a very long time. The angel tells me that I am currently outside of time. When I ask him what he means, he tells me that the angels had to slow down time in order to save me. When I give him a look and ask him if he can do this, he nods and tells me that the angels can control time, temporarily slowing it down or speeding it up in order to do their job. He tells me that there is no time where we are, but if I go back only a short time will have passed since the accident.  
  NDE due to car crash.  Remarkable discussion with angels.   

      5081.    Michael H Probable NDE     9/26/2022.      Probable NDE 9454.            The Senior EMT, who I call him my angel, said to them, 'The guy is dead. We’re just basically going to drive him in and go to the morgue. The hospital dispatch said, 'OK give him the second stimulant.' My heart started back up. I have no memory for 48 hours. I didn’t see the light and I didn’t experience the full death experience because I had no memory of that time period. But I have three very vivid messages ringing in my head; they seem to come from an angel.   
  Probable NDE due to cardiac arrest with a miracle resuscitation.   

    5080.    Jeff L NDE     9/26/2022.      NDE 9453.       Exceptional Experience.     I concluded that my brain's executive functions were intact. I decided to test my short-term memory. Sure enough, I could remember everything leading up to collapsing at the entrance to the emergency room. Not only that but I could remember all of it in exquisite, vivid detail. I then decided to test my long-term memory and arbitrarily chose 8th grade. Immediately, I was furnished a rush of detailed memories. The sharpness and vividness of those memories quickly overwhelmed me. I wondered, 'Where could all that have been stored?' I concluded that my long term memory system was intact and it was much broader and deeper than I believed possible.  
  NDE due to STEMI heart attack.   

    5079.    Nicholas C Probable NDE     9/26/2022.      Probable NDE;Drug Experience 9452.            I was quickly overcome by the purest white light imaginable. I was so white, it was almost blue. It was as if if it was there the whole time. My first feeling was fear. I was almost immediately comforted by what I perceived to be the Creator. I I can only describe this as the feeling of being a lost child found by his parents and receiving a hug. There were no exchange of words because communication was exchanged through an emotional connection.
  Probable NDE associated with THC and alcohol use.   

    5078.    Ismael Probable NDE     9/18/2022.      Probable NDE 9450.       From Equador.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Camille.     I woke up very excited, and told my mom that I had felt my body leave the planet like a rocket, and enter a supernatural world or dimension where I had met God. According to me, at that time, I described him as an old man who had a white tunic and said that what stood out the most were his sandals. After that, God told me that I had to go back because my mother was crying a lot and I couldn't leave her alone.  
  Probable NDE due to peritonitis at age 4.   

    5077.    Constanza S NDE     9/12/2022.      NDE 9446.        From Argentina.     I was aware of everything that had happened, as I fell from that dark tunnel with a light at the end. A light that was cold and warm at the same time, that gave peace. I was thinking about my mom, and it all happened too fast, I guess not in real time. I felt my soul fall into my body and I didn't open my eyes. I felt peace and despair.  
  NDE due to being struck by a car at age 9.   

    5076.    Colleen M NDE     9/12/2022.      NDE 9445.       From Canada     I was moving down a tunnel at the end of the tunnel there was a place of such peace and calm.  I felt so loved.  I was no longer suffering; all of my pain went away.  I was unaware of anything happening externally around me.  I was fully aware, even hyper aware of the overwhelming feeling of peace, love and indescribable bliss.  I continued to move down the tunnel and recognized that continuing to move meant leaving the physical world and going somewhere else.  I completely at peace with moving forward.  
  NDE due to pulmonary embolus.  Experience occurred slightly less than three months before it was shared.   

    5075.    Dianne B NDE     9/9/2022.      NDE 9444.            I then had a panoramic vision of the room.  The baby wasn’t in a nursery, but a dining room with the table and chairs pushed across the room so the crib could fit.  The room had wallpaper with ships on it and olive drab full length curtains.  The room looked out to the front of the house with two big windows with bushes in front of them.  It was dark and the house was quiet.  
  Remarkable NDE at age 2-3 months with very detailed OBE observations confirmed years later.  NDE shared 56 years after it occurred.   

      5074.    Marlon C Pre-Birth     9/9/2022.      Pre-Birth 23501.            It's very difficult to explain, but the consciousness of the older man, and my current consciousness either merged, or swamped position. I eventually penetrated what I initially thought was a wall. I was going to hit it and afterwards, splat. Instead, I squeezed through it, as if it was a thick liquid. I saw the embryo but was communicating with something telepathically. It was telling me I had to enter the embryo, but I got a glimpse of another place and wanted to go there. I was very adamant about not wanting to come back here, but, in a very soothing voice, it simply said, 'you have to go back'. 
  Remarkable pre-birth remembrance of observing man dying, aware of his consciousness apart from the body, then awareness of themselves as a sperm beginning a new life.  Shared 50 years later.   

    5073.    Hobart G Probable NDE     8/29/2022.      Probable NDE 9441.            I saw five ghostly beings that did not recognize.  I remember a heavenly, peaceful feeling that was so overwhelming that I personally cannot describe the feeling. I never felt any type of pain whatsoever. I remember seeing myself in the driver's seat of the truck. After that, I remember seeing rotor blades of a helicopter.  
  Probable NDE due to truck crash.   

    5072.    Gail C NDE     8/27/2022.      NDE & Anesthesia 9440.            At this time a neat visual thing started happening, like a kaleidoscope of moving colors, pure glowing colors that were very beautiful and interesting to watch.  This was the most pleasant (and actually the only) option of any available activities for me and so I chose to watch and was very intrigued by this, all the while noting the impacts of the kicks to my body.  I was watching my lightshow and then the same voice as before spoke to me again from over my left shoulder.  He said to me “Remember last time?”  
  Anesthesia experience at age 7 and NDE at age 36 due to being dragged by a horse.   

    5071.    Richard C Probable NDE     8/24/2022.      Probable NDE 9439.            I saw a cluster of sparks that were under the edge of a clear shelf. The shelf was like glass but not like glass. It was almost clear but not completely. It looked like it was harder than glass would be. Two people were on the shelf one in a large chair and the other standing beside it. Just before I got there I was informed that it wasn't my turn and I had to go back. It's not like I heard the words, I just knew them. The words were part of my thoughts. It was like I know my hand is at the end of my arm kind of thing. The sparks were other people that had already made it and were waiting to go above the shelf.  
  Probable NDE due to apparent low blood pressure.   

    5070.    Yin-Ya NDE    8/21/2022.      NDE 16127.         Non-western NDE From China.  Original in Chinese, translated to English by Jenny   A chubby woman in a medieval white robe and wearing a white sleeping hat with fungus shaped brim greeted me with a smile. Slowly I flew into a dark space, tilted upward in a steady way, and there was a gleaming light very far away. On the way, there was a set of 3-dimensional shapes that composed of light. Although it was light, I knew that it is some sort of material which is rather a law of the universe. Its appearance is similar to a treble clef, and there is a long, lit arm reaching out from the right side and a three-dimensional spiral line underneath it, which became smaller progressively.
    From Zhi Hu forum 12/24/21   

    5069.    Robin G NDE     8/20/2022.      NDE 9437.            I felt myself being whisked down a long tunnel and I saw a very bright white light at the end.  I never got to the end because they brought me back to consciousness.  I remember for that entire day walking around on campus feeling completely serene and at peace. A state of tranquility that I had never experienced before.  
  NDE due to passing out while donating blood.   

    5068.    Janice F NDE     8/16/2022.      NDE 9436.       From Canada     As I was heading up all of a sudden to my left there were people under the water.  It looked like a living nativity scene.  I was totally shocked seeing them there and found the colors of their clothing to be so vivid making them look completely out of place.  I just stopped and stared trying to make sense of what they were doing there.  They were all looking down as if in a play waiting for someone to yell action.  I was focused on Mary as she was first and wearing the most intense colored blue robe.  I assume baby Jesus was there in the manger but don't recall seeing him.  
  NDE at age 3 due to drowning.  Shared 53 years later.   

      5067.    Wade K Possible NDE     8/15/2022.      Possible NDE;Probable OBE 9435.            Each of the beings were smiling. The sky was an incredible fluorescent color of blue I have never seen on earth. The bright golden-white light emanating from the portal consisted of golden light particles that floated outward from the portal. The strange part was, as the light particles crossed my body, I felt No fear. No part of me was afraid. I did not feel judged. I neither felt like completely in heaven nor hell. Neither the light, the spiritual beings, nor spirit said a word. There was No music. No further gestures to come near, but No one appeared to overtly prevent me from moving forward, so I felt as though I was floating toward the two women. Suddenly, the darker skinned woman raised her hand, plam facing me, as if to say, "Stop."  
  Probable OBE dream vs possible NDE at time of exhaustion.   

    5066.    James B NDE     8/15/2022.      NDE 9434.            I was No longer on the football field, or even in this world; I was in another realm or dimension.  I seemed to be in some kind of room.  A shadowy room with thin shafts of light trickling down.  The room was marked by total and complete stillness and silence.  Nothing moved.  There was No sound.  I experienced myself as standing completely still.  
  NDE due to injury during football scrimmage at about age 14.  Shared about 58 years after experience.   

    5065.    Franklin R NDE     8/14/2022.      NDE 9433.            The man came closer and closer until he was standing right in front of me. He told me he wanted to show me something and so he lifted me under his arm like you would do a child and we lifted off the ground at an incredible pace. We raced through the universe where he told me every name of every planet. I could all at once understand this information even though it was coming at me so fast. We then went to a place which seemed like the middle east (I have traveled my whole life, and this is the closest place I can place the location). We then sat and listened to a young boy talk (I believe Jesus as everyone was saying his name).  
  NDE due to illness.   

    5064.    Pam T NDE     8/10/2022.      NDE;Drug Experience   9432.       From the United Kingdom.    I had been going towards a very bright light and there was such a feeling of pure unjudging, all-encompassing love. It was wonderful.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt at age 15.  Shared 52 years later.   

    5063.    Andrew M NDE     8/7/2022.      NDE 9431.            There was no sound or light.  But, I had the feeling my eyes were finally actually opened.  The most perfect peace and contentment surrounded me like it was water and I was in the deep-end under the surface.  I was surrounded and enveloped by it.  I could sense others around me, my grandmother and grandfather, love and peace itself, and pure consciousness in my belief.  I was duly conscious of the fact, I had not vanished or disappeared.   
  NDE during surgery to repair an aortic dissection.   

    5062.    Patrick P NDE     8/4/2022.      NDE 9430.            In the shades of a colour I cannot describe, like a brown-purple-grey-black, I saw a rope and ballard line like the line to a club with rope gates leading to the front of a building. The "bouncer" quickly clasped the rope closed and some of my deceased family members were there telling me "no, go back!"  
  NDE due to apparent cardiac arrest.  NDE shared about one week after it occurred.   

    5061.    Albert vM Probable NDE     8/1/2022.      Probable NDE 9429.       From the Netherlands     I remembered I was in a completely dark, empty and silent void. I had No body (that is, I was not aware of having any physical body) and No thoughts. But I was conscious. I was just hanging there like some orb in the void, there was No space or time whatsoever. When thinking of it afterwards there could have passed hours or days, I could not tell.  
  Probable NDE due to faint during a medical procedure.   

    5060.    Eleanor W STE     8/1/2022.      STE 9428.       From Ireland.     Something told me telepathically that this space was reserved for me. “One day, your essence, your spirit, your experiences, will find a home there. Nothing is ever be lost or destroyed. I promise you, all will work out fine in the end. There’s No need to worry. But, you have plenty of things to be getting on with. So, go, live your life well.” I felt so much incredible love from this entity. The intensity of the love I felt from it is indescribable, and the bliss that I felt in myself beholding that was beyond ecstasy.  
  STE at age 14 at time of great despair.   

    5059.    EB STE     8/1/2022.      STE;SOBE 9427.            I found myself standing in a large open space that looked like a large grassy field. Off in the distance, miles away, on top of a rise there was a large white, domed building, with a shallow dome, much wider than it was tall. Around the bottom edge, it appeared to have columns. The building was very far away, so it was hard to see detail. I looked behind me, and there was a forest. I looked down to my right, and could see a neat garden, with perfect rows of small round plants.  
  Sudden SOBE into unearthly realm.   

    5058.    Rhonda M STE     7/27/2022.      STE 23499.       Exceptional Experience     The main being said I learned enough about knowledge, now I was to go back and learn about love. The information about 'love' is not what we think of here in the physical world. Love is not sexual or possessive, but spiritual. Love is more like endless compassion, without judgment. I was to go back and learn about love. I was not alone; they were with me and guiding me and I would know I had the capability to communicate through this "tone of thought" that we were presently communicating with.    
  Exceptional STE with profound spiritual wisdom.   

    5057.    John B FDE     7/19/2022.      FDE 9426.       From Italy     I wasn’t inside the car anymore, the time was frozen or didn’t exist, I felt complete calm, peace and lucidity. I was only “consciousness”: I didn’t see anything, I was in another dimension, I experienced only feelings and thoughts. In that moment I realized the end of my life without any drama, without any regrets, with total acceptance and serenity. I was somewhat amused, thinking “WTF! Who would have thought that I would die at 44, away from home, in such a silly way?”  
  Fear-death experience at time of car accident.  Shared about one month after experience.   

    5056.    Karen NDE     7/17/2022.      NDE 9425.            The light came from inside of me like a beacon and I floated through it. I felt an all-consuming love like I have never felt on earth. I saw and felt familiar with an elongated figure waiting for me at the end of the light tunnel. It felt like I was returning home. I looked back at my body on the porch and did not want to return to it.  
  Nurse's NDE due to cardiac arrest from Covid infection associated heart damage.   

    5055.    Tony W NDE     7/8/2022.      NDE 9422.            I felt a feeling of love thousands of times more powerful than any love I have ever felt ever, it's impossible to describe in words, everything was very peaceful and I do not remember hearing any noises at all just feeling love and peace. As I am looking down on my body, A question came to my mind, without words being spoken, I was asked if I wanted to stay up here or go back down...everything went fast after that because as soon as I made a thought of I want to go back down

    5053.    Naomi NDEs     7/8/2022.      NDEs 9420.            He was totally accepting of me. He was not judging me for being annoying, or jumping too much. The more I jumped and laugh around him, the happiest he was with me. That's why I felt great acceptance and no judgment of my actions.   
  Two NDEs, at age 6 and 26.  First due to apparent cessation of breathing from  cause and the second due to pulmonary embolism.   

    5052.    Polly S STE     7/6/2022.      STE 9419.       From the United Kingdom.     I felt no fear and was totally at peace. Then I felt a rush of energy or some force from below that propelled me upwards. I don't know how far upwards I went, but when I stopped I was aware of blocks of black matter. The black matter was coming from both sides, although I was in a cylinder of light. My progress was stopped at that point, like clamps on the outside of the tunnel. I found that I could swim, play, and twizzle about in the 'stream of light'. I felt perfect peace, joy, hope and love. It was totally fulfilling and I was having fun. I could move freely upwards.   
  STE at time of severe depression.   

    5051.    Gregory K NDE     7/6/2022.      NDE 9418.       From Australia.     It was as if the blackness began covering me like a warm blanket. I still remember the total calmness that came over me as I kept inhaling the blackness all around, which now also began to feel as it was filling me up from the inside. I actually felt as I was drifting off into a lovely deep sleep. It was as if a thick, black liquid began to cover my eyes and was slowly making its way around the outside of my body and the inside of my brain. I began feeling like I was actually flying in the blackness, with a calmness and peacefulness becoming my entire existence. I began the transition from my body’s physical mass into nothingness. But, there was also an amazing 'Home-like Welcoming Feeling' of being loved. I felt surrounded by people who loved me and that I also loved, but they were people I actually didn’t know in this life.
  NDE due to dramatic near drowning in Antarctic Ocean and hypothermia.   

    5050.    Mimi D NDE     7/6/2022.      NDE 9417.       From Australia.     I was standing/hovering up at the back of this woman who was trying to revive me. I was there with my mother who had passed over. She was not young or old, and she looked different than when I had known her. I knew it was her even though we didn't speak. It is hard to explain. It was like knowing; like being part of everything.   
  NDE due to cardiac arrest associated with atrial fibrillation.   

    5049.    Estelle G STE     7/1/2022.      STE 9415.       From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Camille.     Then, I felt the presence of three people on my right, one closer to me, and two behind. I didn't see them, but I knew very clearly that they were there.
