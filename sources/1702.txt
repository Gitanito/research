PREFACE.
When an Author ventures to communicate his reflec-
tions to the Public, it is surely required of him, that
he at least should be convinced of the necessity as
well as the value of what he has to offer. Candour
demands that he should be actuated by no sinister or
unworthy motive ; but that the governing principle of
his conduct should be a simple desire to convey in-
struction or amusement to mankind at large. And
when he ventures to select the same field of moral
observation and inquiry that others have previously
chosen ; when he professes to believe there yet remain
many beauties unexplored in the same tract, and in-
dulges the hope that he can throw a new and more
pleasing light on truths which others have investigated
before him ; it is justly asked on what ground he rests
his claim to public attention, and why he conceives it
necessary to add another to the countless muhitude of
ephemeral productions.
IV PREFACE.
To the question, why the author has resolved on
publishing his sentiments, he would briefly reply, that
his determination has arisen from the firm conviction
that such a work was still a desideratum to the mourner.
Sustaining this character himself, by the removal of his
nearest and dearest relatives, he was induced, in his
hours of solitude, to seek that sympathy, instruction,
and support, which his situation required, from the pen
of those who had written professedly on the subject.
It is true, that much which is kind, and useful, and
excellent, is to be found in these little books ; but it is
equally true, (at least so it proved in his own case,)
that no one, nor indeed all combined, are exactly
suited to the wants and fears, the cares and sorrows,
of the genuine mourner. He would desire fully to
appreciate the valuable labours of those who have
preceded him, but still he would consider " A Tribute
of Sympathy, addressed to Mourners,^' as desirable;
and with parental fondness he would conceive the
present little work calculated, in some measure, to
supply the existing deficiency.
During a season of sorrow the mind is softened, and
prepared to receive the instruction which may be
derived from its present circumstances. But to gain
access to the heart, to engage the attention, and awaken
the judgment to the arduous duties which the afflicted
are invited to perform, it is necessary that their sorrows
PREFAeE. V
should be soothed, that their anguish should be re-
spected, their feelings participated, their anxieties
allayed, and their distress alleviated. The eye suffused
with tears is incapable of perusing and deriving ad-
vantage from the intrinsically excellent, but frigid de-
clamations of the uninterested observer. The wounded
heart must be healed, and the tearful eye must first be
dried, by the tenderest sympathy, ere it can attend to
the lessons of instruction. The troubled bosom must
be calmed, before it can be animated with the genial
glow of resignation to the will of God, or be enabled
to appropriate the inaportant truths conveyed in this
gloomy and mysterious providence ; before it can ap-
preciate the duties connected with its situation, or
realize the prospects of mercy and comfort with which
it is surrounded. And since the mind> oppressed with
care, will very soon become fatigued with simple
argumentative disquisitions, in which, oftentimes, it
can scarcely feel an interest; it is devoutly to be
wished, that truth should be conveyed in a style so
pleasing and so chaste as to engage the understanding,
while it wins its way to the heart. And though the
author laments most sincerely that his situation, and
constant professional engagements, disqualify him for
the task of gratifying the refined taste of individuals,
who may possibly honour him with a perusal of his
work; yet he trusts that he has in some measure
1*
VI PREFACE.
succeeded in gaining a readier access to the heart,
and in preparing it for the reception of truths which,
in another form, might have been probably overlooked.
The circumstances of the mourner acquire a peculiar
claim upon our tenderest regards. We are accustomed
to feel compassion for every case of distress, and the
hand of benevolence is readily outstretched for the
relief of the indigent and the suffering poor. The sick
and the miserable demand our attention, and all those
comforts which a kind Providence has enabled us to
bestow. Yet the mourner, in a much higher degree,
is entitled to our sympathy. He has lost, perhaps,
the friend in whom centered all his plans of earthly
happiness, his every prospect is clouded by the gloom
of desertion and despair, hope has abandoned a heart
already overwhelmed with grief, and there is none to
comfort him. If, then, we can be interested by the
tale of human wo, if we can be animated with the
liveliest sympathy towards those whose distress results
simply from present and bodily privation ; can we
refuse to drop the tear of pity over the mental sufferer
;
can we withhold our exertions to impart relief, or
conceive an object more worthy of our active benefi-
cence? Hence it will be acknowledged, that every
attempt to alleviate the sorrows of the afflicted, to
administer comfort to the mourner, and lead him to
the only source of solid peace, is entitled, in so far as
PREFACE. VU
it accomplishes this object, to be received with indul-
gence.
Such, indeed, has been the exclusive design of the
author, in offering to other mourners those considera-
tions which served to calm his own mind, those bright-
ening prospects which led him forward to the glorious
realities of an infinite and eternal world, and those
reflections which, he trusts, had a tendency to animate
him to the love and service of God. In presenting his
thoughts to the public, he has no interest to serve, no
party views to promote, no favourite dogmas to en-
force ;
his simple view is to administer consolation to
the afflicted, and to lead them to make a proper
improvement of their sorrows. If he has failed in
accomplishing this object, it has not been from want
of sincerity, of earnest desire, or of as great a devot-
edness to the pursuit, as his professional engagements
would admit, but from incapacity.
How far the present little work fulfils these inten-
tions, must be left to the decision of an impartial
censor : if the author must relinquish the attainment
of the good he has designed, he will still enjoy the
satisfaction of having attempted what he conceived to
be necessary, and if he shall have so far succeeded, as
to administer to the comfort and improvement of such
as are called to mourn for those who are translated
from earth to heaven ; if he may have the happiness
Vlll PREFACE.
to smooth the thorny pillow, to still the troubled bosom,
to elevate the heart to God, and lead it to the only
fountain of peace and consolation ; then will he indeed
rejoice in the delightful task he has undertaken, then
will he render thanksgiving and praise to the gracious
Hand which visited him with suffering, in order to
prepare him for this labour of love. He now desires
to leave his little work in the hands of Him who alone
can bless it; imploring, with humble fervency, that an
Almighty Father would be graciously pleased to smile
on this feeble attempt to promote the honour of his
name and the glory of his kingdom: and that He
would render it instrumental in cheering and supporting
the weary and the sorrowing, and in leading them to
himself, as the only source of comfort. That those
heart-broken mourners into whose hands this little
Treatise shall fall, may share in the consolations of the
Spirit of Grace, prays, with sincerest desire,
Their obedient Servant,
THE AUTHOR.

FOURTH EDITION,
In presenting to the Public a Fourth Edition of the
Tribute of Sympathy, the author has only to express
his unfeigned gratitude to Almighty God, for the many
testimonies he has received of the efficacy of his little
work in administering consolation to the mourner ; and
to' add, that having carefully revised it, previously to
its going to the press, he hopes he shall have rendered
the present edition more acceptable to his readers,

TRIBUTE OF SYMPATHY,
CHAPTER I.
ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF.
ii>F all the varied emotions of which the human
}nind is susceptible, that arising from the exer-
cise of sympathy, or the capacity for suffering,
in ourselves, the cares and sorrows of those
around us, is perhaps at once the most engaging
and the most extensively useful. When once
excited, the heart is expanded to the full opera-
tion of the benevolent affections, and the most
self-denying sacrifices are cheerfully made, in
order to secure the happiness of its object. The
high excitement of feeling occasioned by the
exercise of this principle, is in itself so large a
source of present pleasure, that we sometimes
meet with individuals who glaringly obtrude
their claims to its possession ; but with whom it
is an ineffective stimulus to action, administerino-

simply to their own gratification, and diverted
from the obvious design for which it was im-
planted in the human breast, viz. the alleviation
of the sufferings of humanity.
Notwithstanding the powerful influence of
envy, in narrow ing the circle of social kindness,
yet, when this principle does not actively pre-
dominate, it is not difficult to joy with those who
rejoice; and that heart must be cold indeed,
which, in contemplating the happiness of others,
does not experience a kindred glow of satisfac-
tion, which does not secretly indulge a hope^
that the present scene of pleasure may be long
secured from the wintry air of affliction. But
to participate the sorrow of friends, and truly
to sympathize with their suffering, involves not
only a present emotion of disinterested benevo-
lence, but a long train of active duties. Real
sympathy will never rest satisfied with ineffective
good wishes, or the common routine of polite
and unmeaning profession; but it will seek to
share the burden which it is unable to remove
;
it will enter into the feelings of the sufferer, and
if it cannot dissipate the gloom with which the
death of a beloved object has enveloped his
every prospect, yet will it strive to illuminate
the dark and silent hours of solitude and grief,
by pouring in upon the mind the balmy ray of
heavenly consolation, with which even the niffht
Ox\ THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF. 15
of desertion may be cheered. They who have
suffered affliction, must have experienced the
rehef obtained by the participation of their sor-
rows, and will readily acknowledge the powerful
influence of the affectionate voice of friendship,
in exhibiting the sources of their consolation,
soothing their aching hearts, moderating their
boundless grief, and elevating their thoughts
and desires to that kingdom whither their dearest
friend has gone before them, and is now enjoying
the perfect felicities of that rest whence every
tear is eternally banished.
It is to this office that the friend who now
addresses you would aspire. Like yourself, he
has been visited with great distress ; he has felt
the want and has experienced the worth of a
kind friend to whom he could confide his feelings
;
particularly in those seasons of solitude and
seclusion which are so earnestly desired by the
mourner ; but in which the mind, left to prey
upon itself, is too apt to indulge its propensity
to dwell on all the aggravating circumstances of
the present affliction, rather than on the came
which has rendered it necessary, the hand which
has inflicted it, the design with which it is sent,
or the blessing with which it is encompassed.
And although the voice of sympathy may be
removed from him for a short time only, yet he
finds that he requires its welcome accents to be
16 ON THE INDULGENCE OP GRIEF^
perpetually reiterated in his ears, and its valuable
consolations to be ever before his eyes. He
needs the frequent repetition of the same cheer-
ing truths, to preserve him from sinking into
despondency ; and a constant review of the same
alleviating circumstances, the same motives to
resignation, the same enlivening promises, the
same animating prospects.
It is to remove this deficiency in the hour of
solitude, that the present address is undertaken.
Sympathy alone has induced the author to per-
sonate the character he has drawn. He has
been the possessor of peace and joy for a short
time, even in this world of wo. He has had
every wish of his heart gratified. He has proudly
contented himself with his domestic happiness,
equally careless of the little troubles and vexa-
tions of the day, as of that beneficent hand
which made his cup to run over with blessings.
But he has been taught the vanity of reposing
his hopes in the creature. A husband and a
father, death has deprived him of every earthly
comfort. One short month has witnessed the
dissipation of his prospects, which he had
lengthened out to an almost indefinite period.
He has been called to mourn his folly and his
loss, and has been left alone on this wilderness
world, in order that he may learn, by dearly
bought experience, the insufficiency of earthly
ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF. 17
pleasures, the instability of present scenes of
comfort, and the perfect sufficiency of the Bible
to afford peace and consolation to the agitated
mourner. He has found that the greatest afflic-
tions convey the most instructive lessons of
happiness, by demonstrating the real nature of
the objects on which man places his dependence;
and he hopes that the following observations
may prove as cheering to others, as they were
productive of serenity to himself.
Yes, my dear friend, 1 venture to break in
upon your solitude with " A Tribute of Sympa-
thy." Nor would I interrupt your grief: I
would weep with those that weep ; I would
mingle my tears with yours, and during the
first transports of sorrow, I would only seek to
participate the agonizing feelings which over-
whelm you. Perhaps you are mourning over
the decease of an aged parent, the guardian
and the guide of your youth, and the fond
counsellor of your maturity. Or, death may
have made its first inroad on the family circle,
by snatching away a brother or a sister; and
you nic^y have been called to resign this endeared
relative, at an age when fraternal afi'ection had
been confirmed by the award of judgment, when
the varied excellencies of the character were
fully expanded, and had proved it worthy of
your highest esteem. Your heart may have
18 ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF.
been called to bleed over the removal of a
beloved child, the development of vs^hose dawn-
ing faculties you had carefully watched, and
whom you were anxiously training up in the
admonition of the Lord, and thus preparing for
activity in his service. Or, to complete the
climax of human wo, you may be inconsolable
for the loss of a fond husband, or an affectionate
wife, one with whom you had enjoyed many
hours of happiness ; the partner of your cares
and joys, your dearest constant companion, and
your best friend. You are mourning a loss
which is severe indeed, a loss which is irrepara-
ble, and for which, too, you were pirobably un-
prepared. The stroke may have been sudden
;
a few days, or perhaps even a few hours, may
have dispelled the enchanting prospect which
was before you, and of which you had just hoped
to realize the pleasing illusions.
You arc unexpectedly removed from the
summit of human happiness, to the abyss of
human wo. And shall the silent eloquence of
grief be denied you? Shall a measured and
philosophical sorrow be alone permitted ? Shall
these affecting appeals be made to the tenderest
sensibilities of your nature; and shall the ex-
pression of suffering be contracted within limits,
to be defined by the eye of the moralist, during
a moment of cahn self-complacency?—No; the
ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF. 19
heart knoweth its own bitterness : nor can the
individual who is only theoretically acquainted
with sorrow, legishite the thoughts, the feehngs,
and the actions of him who is indeed afflicted.
Christianity does not require this unnatural
restraint ; but distinctly teaches, that affliction
for the present " is not joyous, but grievous."
The silent apathy of the stoic is perfectly incon-
sistent with the exercise of Christian fortitude.
The heartless obedience of the unfeeling differs
most essentially from the resignation of the
feeble but sincere Christian. It is no argument
in favour of the possession and influence of
Christian principle, to hear ivith submission losses
and suffering which we do not feel. This indeed
evinces only culpable indifference to the events of
God's providence, and to the particular design
with which He has seen fit to correct us : it is the
off'spring of carelessness and contempt, rather
than the expression of resignation. It is pro-
voking the anger of a righteous God, by refusing
to listen to His voice, who speaks more power-
fully and energetically to the heart through the
medium of affliction, than man can do, by all the
fowers of abstract reasoning. It is incurring the
judgment denounced against those *'
who have
not grieved," when jEZe had afflicted them—" who
have refused to receive correction," when He
had consumed them—" who have made their
20 ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF.
faces harder than a rock, and have refused to
return."*
Since, then, insensibility to the chastening
hand of God is so clearly pointed out as displeas-
ing to Him^ it surely follows, that to feel most
sensibly the wound He has inflicted, and to ex-
press that feeling, is not improper in itself, though
it may become so when excessive in degree.
Weep on then, my dear friend; indulge your
sorrow ; lay open the recesses ofyour aching heart
to the bosom of friendship, and more especially
make them known to that Friend who has
chastened you for your profit. Recollect, that
you are never less alone than when alone. God
is every where present, and ready to afford con-
solation and support to those who call upon him.
His providence watches over all: he makes his
snn to rise upon the evil and the good ; he is
acquainted with the secrets of your heart; he
sees your distress ; he waits to be gracious ; he
is infinitely wise to guide and direct, and kind
and beneficent, as well as unlimited in ability, to
give you peace and joy. It is his delight to dwell
with the humble and contrite heart, to revive the
spirit of the humble, to be present with his peo-
ple in their affliction, to put underneath them his
everlasting arms, and sustain them under the
pressure of the greatest misfortunes.
* Jer. V. 3.
ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF. 2K
When his servants, in the days of Nebuchad-
nezzar, refused to infringe the laws of the Lord
their God, and were cast into the furnace of fire,
he exhibited his power to save, and his deUght
to support them in suffering, by his presence ; for
•*
there were seen four men walking in the midst
of the fire, who had no hurt : and the form of the
fourth was like unto the Son of God."* And,
although we do not now expect the same visible
interference and miraculous preservation, we are
assured that the people of God are equally his
peculiar care ; that it is his delight to be doing
them good, and that he is ever nigh unto them
by his Word and by his Spirit. His ear is open
to their cry : this almighty Friend is always ac-
cessible ; he is willing to hsten to their complaints,
and he has the power to sooth their sorrows.
Come then to this Friend, and pour out your heart
before him : detail all your cares, and seek to
obtain the benefit which he has intended: trust
yourselves and your all in his hands, and then
you shall find that he is a very present help in
trouble; that, in opening your heart unto him,
the severity of your grief has been mitigated; and
that you have in heaven a Friend who loveth at
all times, a Friend more certainly endeared than,
the nearest and most perfect human relation.
* Dan. iii. 25.
22 ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF.
Our Lord Jesus Christ himself has left us an
example of a real mourner ; he was indeed " a
man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." It
is recorded of him, that he wept over the grave
of Lazarus, and that, because he loved him. He
does not rebuke the tears of the bereaved rela-
tives, though he strives to comfort them ; and, so
far from affording to his followers an example of
unmoved suffering, ^'
he is troubled," he "groaned
in his spirit ;" yea, he drops the tear of sympathy
and affection over the deceased.* Jesus was a
mourner here below, and he has smoothed the
rugged path of sorrow, by leaving us an example,
not of unyielding indifference, but of submission
to the will of his heavenly Father, and of the re-
lief bountifully provided for the sufferer, in weep-
ing over his loss. And although it is not now the
first concern of our Lord and Saviour, to recall
to earth the object of his solicitude ,
yet the bodies
of his people are his peculiar charge, and he will
raise them up at the last day to glory, and honour,
and immortality.
This idea beautifully illustrates Ids divine com-
passion ;
" for we have not an High Priest which
cannot be touched with the feeling of our infir-
mities : but who was in all points tempted like
as we are, yet without sin."t He knows the

extent of your sufferings, for he has felt the same
;
his heart overflows with pity, and is expanded
towards you, in all the fulness of redeeming grace
and dying love ;
you are interested in his com-
passionate regards, and he seeks to allure you to
himself. He invites you to cast your burden
upon him, and is only seeking, by this light afiiic-
tion, to recall your wandering affections from the
creature, and to withdraw your erring footsteps
from the uncertain track of time and sorrow, to
the satisfying pursuit of substantial good. He
seeks tliat the heart may be softened and ren-
dered accessible ; and he appears, not as a God
of judgment, but of mercy—chastising, but in
love—afllicting, but from the purest compassion
—and supporting with the richest consolations.
He sees, he feels your sorrow—he hastens to your
relief—he interposes his cheering presence, his
animating voice. He says, " Weep not^" and
proclaims himself as the " resurrection and the
life." Yes! he comes to you in the endearing
character of friend ; he calms your agitated bosom
by his sympathy, he comforts by his Spirit, sup-
ports by his grace, and leads your thoughts
onward to that glorious period of immortality
and ])eace, when you shall be re-united to your
lost relative, in realms of unfading bliss; and
shall associate with his glorified spirit, now trans-
formed into the image ofyour mutual Redeemer,
24 ON THE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF.
in ascribing all the glory of your salvation and
eternal felicity to the " Lamb that was slain."
Our great High Priest and Advocate still lives
and reigns to make intercession for us ; he is
*'
Unchangeably faithful to save,
Almighty to rule and command."
" Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne
of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
grace to help in time of need."* Let us com-
mune with our own hearts, and with this almighty
Saviour, that we may listen to his voice, and
obey his word, and follow him whithersoever \w
leadeth.

CHAPTER II.
ON THE MODERATION OF GRIEF.
Christianity does not forbid its disciples to
mourn; but rather sanctions the expressions of
grief, occasioned by the loss of friends, when
viewed as the consequence of sin generally, as
the result of our ow n carelessness and folly, and
as forming a part of that probationary discipline
which is designed to prepare us for another and
a better world. Grace does not destroy, but
simply regulates nature ; it does not supersede
the affections or forbid their influence, but only
moderates and dijrects their exercise.
Could we distinctly view every object and
event through the chastened medium of Chris-
tianity, there would be no danger in the indul-
gence of grief: there would be no fear of offending
God by weeping over the loss of those blessings
which he has conferred, together with all capa-
city for their enjoyment : there would be no
necessity to restrain the exercise of those affec-
tionate sympathies which he has implanted in
our bosoms, as the source of many of our plea-
3
26 Ox\ THE MODERATION OF GRIEl.
sures, and the principle upon which much, and
that the most admirable part of our conduct, is
grounded.
The feeble glimmering light of nature is in-
sufficient to guide our affections or actions. The
objects we perceive through this medium are so
distorted by prejudice, so deceptive by their
energetic appeal t,o our feelings and passions,
that our judgment is rendered vacillating and
uncertain; and we become incapable of forming
a correct estimate of their real nature, and of
their respective combinations and affinities ; or
of the results to which they lead. But the torch
of divine truth enables us to discover the way in
which we should walk ; it unmasks prejudice, de-
velops the secret influence of feeling, dispels the
mists of error, and, by its clear and steady radi-
ance, safely guides and invigorates the sincere
inquirer ; discloses to him the hidden treasures
of hope, and regulates his conduct by its own
unerring laws. We no longer walk in darkness
and uncertainty, but are enabled to descry the
dangers we must avoid, as well as the object we
must pursue, and the means by which it may be
attained.
The Christian mourner is not left in doubt as
to the limits which should define his sorrow : for,
although we must rejoice at the present, eternal,
and unfading happiness of the spirit of the de-
ON THE MODERATION OF GRIEF. 27
parted Christian, and the infinite and incalculable
value of the exchange he has made ;
yet to
mourn for the dead, and more particularly for
those who die in the arms of their Lord, is a duty
which nature and affection demand—which is
perfectly compatible with the purest influence of
religion, sanctioned by the example of eminent
saints, and required by God himself. Abraham,
that faithful servant of the most high God,
mourned for Sarah. " Abraham came to mourn
for Sarah, and to weep for her." So did Jacob
for his son Joseph, and Joseph and his brethren
for their father Jacob.* Instances might be
multiplied ; but the bare mention of these is
enough to prove, that to mourn was not incon-
sistent with their patriarchal piety and primaeval
simplicity. Indifference to the death of the
righteous has been plainly reproved by the Spirit
of Truth, who declares that " the righteous
perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart."t It
is not then sorrow in itself, but its excessive in-
dulgence, which is to be avoided by the Christian
;
for •'
godly sorrow worketh repentance to salva-
tion not to be repented of."|
It is indeed true that affliction is grievous to
be borne ; and it is equally true, that the ravages
of intemperate grief intercept our views of the
" Gen. xxiii. 2 ; xxxvii. 34 ; 1. 10. t Isa. Ivii. 1.

28 ox THE MODERATION OF GRIEF.
Great Disposer of all events and of the hearts of
men, becloud our prospects of eternity, depress
the spirits, shrivel and contract the heart into the
coldest selfishness, and impair the health of the
body. Griefis a passion which requires the great-
est watchfulness ; for its influence steals upon
us insensibly, under the disguise of positive duty
;
and acquires the power of expanding itself to an
almost indefinite extent, till it has so occupied
the heart, that there is great danger lest it should
overwhelm us, and prevent our deriving those
advantages from affliction which our merciful
Father has intended. Hence it is enjoined that
Christians should moderate their sorrow: *'
My
son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him."* Ex-
cessive sorrow is combined in the same precept
with that hardness of heart which refuses to be
softened, and to feel under the chastening hand
©f God. We are commanded not to faint ; hence,
sorrow should be so moderated as riot to interfere
with the discharge of the private duties of reli-
gion. It should bring us ^to God more humbly,
more intimately, and more devoutly, rather than
alienate us from him. If we indulge the soft
luxury of grief, our minds will become enfeebled
for religious duties; we shall be completely ah-
•*

5n the moderation op grief. 29
sorbed in contemplating the occasion of our sor-.
row, and we shall scarcely lift from the heart one
aspiration of praise to Him who doth all things
well.
Perhaps we have lost an object which we loved
with idolatrous affection. Almighty God has
seen fit to remove that which rivalled the posses-
sion of our hearts ; how careful should we be,
that we do not embrace another idol—that we
do not supply the vacuity death has made in our
affections, by yielding ourselves to the uncon-
trolled dominion of that sorrow which ''
worketh
death!" The eyes of the world are fixed upon
professors of religion, especially on those who are
removed from the obscurity of humble hfe : and
it expects now to perceive the influence of those
animating and consoling truths which had been
so frequently extolled. It does not expect to find
them without a refuge from the storm, a prey to
the influence of ungoverned passion, and over-
whelmed by the agony of despair. It does not
expect to find them sullenly complaining, or in-
deed silently suffering what they know to be in-
evitable, as if it resulted from a fatal necessity,
governed by chance, or directed by the wildest
caprice. It will not even grant those allowances
which the infinite variety of natural temper and
disposition, and of the strength of the intellectual
powers, appears to demand. It will require that

the influence of the principles they profess, and
the doctrines they believe, shall be exemplified in
their conduct: it will expect that their minds
shall be calmed by a consideration of the good-
ness of God, and the equity of his government;
by his wisdom, and his gracious designs towards,
his children ; by a prospect of that rest which
remaineth for the people of God ; and by a firm
reliance on his promise, that all events shall ad-
vance the best interests of those who love him.
It will expect that they will cheerfully resign,
when he calls for it, their dearest earthly comforts,
without murmuring ; and that, on the v/hole, they
will evince a peaceful serenity of temper in the
most distressing circumstances. Religion is in-
deed much exposed to contempt by the immo-
derate sorrow of those who profess their belief
of its truths. If, says the objector, its mild pre-
cepts, its animating hopes, its supporting pro-
mises, and its consoling anticipations, so fre-
quently the subject of discussion in the peaceful
hour of prosperity, be insufficient to support the
mourner under the immediate loss of his relatives
and friends, surely these can be of httle value
;
and the consolations of philosophy are equally
important. If religion and its hopes and joys be,
as they are represented, an all-satisfying good,
how is it that he is so overwhelmed with sorrow
at the loss of one who has entered into his rest.
ON THE MODERATION OF GRIEF. 31
and who, by his removal, has rendered earth less
pleasing", and has engaged his affections more
exclusively in heaven ? He has one attachment
the fewer to the world, and he possesses an ad-
ditional attachment to heaven ; whence, by his
own principles, his religious pleasures should
shortly be increased. To be thus absorbed in
sorrow, manifestly indicates inconsistency with
the possession of such cheering doctrines, and
evinces that he does not really believe the truths
he pertinaciously contends for, or that they are
not in their nature and influence such as they
are asserted to be. Thus, in fact, the prejudices
of the irreligious are strengthened on every side
;
and surely Christians should be doubly careful,
lest they oppose the influence of Christianity, by
placing obstacles to its reception in the way of
others.
The followers of our ascended Saviour arc
commanded not to sorrow " even as others
which have no hope," and are pointed to one
grand source of consolation ;
*'
for if we believe
that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
him."* Here is a positive injunction that Chris-
tians should moderate their grief; and a most
powerful reason is annexed ; for, if we believe
iv. 13, 14.
32 ON THE MODERATION OF GRIEF.
the fundamental truths of the Bible, we are as^
sured that the disembodied spirit of the deceased
over whom affection sheds its fondest tear, is
Tiow infinitely happier than on earth ; it would
not exchange its present peace for the cares and
sorrows it has just quitted, for all the world calls
good or great. From the enjoyment of such
present felicity we would not wish to recall him
whom we have lost : our thoughts are led forward
to the happy period, when we, if the people of
God, shall join the chorus of the redeemed ; and
unite with his glorified spirit, in ascribing "glory,
honour, and blessing to Him that sitteth on the
throne, and to the Lamb for ever."
Again, the Christian remembers that every
event is under the superintendence of God ; and
that, from whatever immediate source the present
affliction may appear to spring, still it originates
with Infinite Wisdom, and is directed in its
period, and in all its circumstances, by Infinite
Love. He knows that he is in the hands of a
merciful and faithful Creator, and trusts in his
power and goodness, though he cannot distinctly
trace that hand which governs even the minutest
event. There are many natural phenomena, of
which we cannot possibly fathom the rationale;
but we are assured that these are influenced by
laws as definite as any others with which we are
more intimately acquainted. We cannot attempt
O^ THE MODERATION OF GRIEF. 3^^
to trace the footsteps of Omnipotence ; our con-
stricted capacities are incapable of discovering
the ways of Providence ; but we are happy in the
assurance that the powers of Omniscience are
engaged in fixing and preserving in its order
every occurrence. The Lord of heaven and
earth sees, and knows, and governs all things
—
the motion of an atom and a world : and though
we are ignorant of his designs, we may safely
confide in Him who does and will direct all con-
tingencies.
" I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, be-
cause thou didst it," is the language of humble
and submissive confidence. While nature weeps,
the Christian remembers that every painful event
has been appointed by omniscient goodness;
and while the silent tear steals down his grief-
worn cheek, he will not be utterly cast down
;
he will review the mercies which have followed
him all the days of his life ; and perceiving that
those events which he now esteems his greatest
blessings, were painful in their nature, he will
come and make his complaint to God, and not
to man. While his heart and eye tend upwards
to the sky, he will not be in danger of excessive
sorrow ; for he will supplicate a gracious Father
with deep humility, for the sinful cause which
has rendered affliction necessary, aiid yet with
filial confidence, assured that he will not lay
34 ON THE MODERATION OF GRIEF.
upon him a burden heavier than he can bear
;
assured that in due ,
time, when his gracious
design shall have been accomplished, he will
give him peace, and deliver him from every
distress. These considerations will prove suf-
ficient to excite him to assuage his grief. He
dares not murmur, or call in question the good-
ness or the justice of God; for he invites his
children to pour out their requests unto him
;
and though in great mercy he sees fit frequently
to deny them what they ask, yet he always
giVeth liberally, and gives exactly, not that
which may be most pleasing, but which will be
best for them in the present and a future world.

CHAPTER III.
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW.
It is not easy to define the precise limits wliefe
every kind and degree of sorrow becomes ex-
cessive ; for a moment's reflection will convince,
that expressions of grief, which nature and
religion both demand and allow under the
severe sufferings to which humanity is exposed,
would be unjustifiable and sinful under the
lighter cares and perplexities of daily life.
There are many persons who view their own
trials through a magnifying medium : they un-
justly trace out aggravating circumstances, which
a fond selfishness alone can discover, and thus
endeavour to excuse their impatience, by the
supposed weight of suflfering under which they
labour. They conceive their affliction to be
more severe than ever was intended by its
Author; and, unaccustomed to the yoke, they
vainly imagine that no burden is equal to theirs,
and believe that their complaints may lawfully
exceed the bounds prescribed for others. Yet
it is manifest, that the same indulgence of grief
cannot be allowed to the sufferings of unsubdued
36 ON EXCESSIVE SORROW.
passion, as to those real mourners who are borne
down with the weight of their sorrows, and with
a humbUng sense of God's justice and mercy
in their infliction—to those whom God hath
wounded in the tenderest relations, and who
feel the full extent of human wretchedness.
Some allowance must be made for natural
disposition, and the peculiar texture of individual
minds. Let not one pride himself on his sub-
mission to afl^ictive providence, when in truth
his equanimity arises from the absence of those
acute feelings which constitute the man of quick
sensibility. Let not that be termed patience,
which consists in indifference ; nor suffer that to
be extolled as a virtue, which is a mere gift of
iiiature, or the offspring of a mind well trained
and disciplined in the depths of abstract reason-
ing, and rendered less susceptible of the acute
feelings a more lively imagination would experi-
ence. Nature has cast some minds in a sterner
mould ; their perceptions are correct—their as-
sociations few and accurate—their judgment
firm—their sensibilities obtuse; while she has
endowed others with a greater degree of vivacity,
quick and inaccurate perception, lively and un-
limited association, and a judgment too fre-
quently influenced, and even carried away, by
the acuteness of their feelings. In characters so
unlike, the expression of sorrow will be different
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 37
in degree, and dissimilar in kind. That sorrow
which would be excessive, and therefore sinful,
in the former character, may be safely allowed
to the latter. In either case, the principal dif-
ference will consist in the external expression of
grief; and there will still remain certain pre-
cepts, whereby the heart of each may alike be
tried and regulated. These will apply to all
;
and each individual may thus form a judgment
for himself, far more easily than those who
frame their opinion from external appearances.
What then is the tendency of your grief?
Does it lead your heart to God, or alienate you
from him ? Does it engage your thoughts and
affections principally on the circumstances of
the affliction which has befallen you, or on the
gracious design with which it has been commis-
sioned? When the Almighty extends his chas-
tening arm, it is to remind us that he is our
chief good, to abstract our hearts from objects
of inferior moment, or to purify and fit us for a
closer walk with him here, and for more intimate
communion with him hereafter. This design
can alone be effected by our returning to him in
sincerity, earnestly striving, that we may be
more entirely devoted to his service, that our
hearts may be more expanded by a Saviour's
love, and that our affections may be animated
with the desire of living to his glory.
4
^ 0\ EXCESSIVE SORROW.
Are you anxious to view all your trials in thi?f
light, and to come to God, and to him alone, for
comfort and support ? Do you delight to have
your thoughts much with him, pray to him, and
diligently strive that the end for which affliction
Was designed, may be accomplished in you?
Or do you rather fondly dwell on the value of
the blessing you have lost, and still concentrate
your affections on that gift which a merciful God
has seen fit to remove ? Do you rather excite
the mind to the recollection of past scenes of
happiness, so fondly and so properly endeared
to memory—to your prospects of earthly plea-
sure, withered by the chilly gale of premature
mortahty, and to your present forlorn condition,
while you lose sight of the hand of God ? Then
is your sorrow excessive, for it is opposed to the
will of heaven, and you are suffering without
the possibility of appropriating those cheering
consolations which are provided for the humble
mourner.
But again,
There's mercy in every place
;
And mercy, encouraging thought,
Gives even affliction a grace,
And reconciles man to liis lot."
hence, sorrow becomes excessive, when we
forget the goodness of God displayed in the
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 39
expressions of his mercy and his love, which we
have enjoyed—which we even now participate
;
and are looking forward to the full disclosure of
his merciful intentions towards us. The ways
of God do indeed sometimes seem marked with
severity. He knows our whole hearts better
than we do ourselves ; and of all possible things
in this world, he does that which is most adapted
to make us feel. Probably, when you examine
the present affliction, you will find that the
stroke is such, whether you consider the person,
the period, the place, and a hundred circum-
stances and associations, past or then expected
;
and thus will you trace the design of God, and
obtain a consciousness that no other hand could
have inflicted it.
Nothing can be more erroneous than the in-
dulgence of suspicions concerning the goodness
of God. He is a righteous governor ; his conduct
is not directed by arbitrary caprice, nor is it the
offspring of envy, since "justice and judgment
are the estabhshment of his throne."* " But
God is also love.^^f His gracious determination
to secure our happiness, and fix it on a perma-
nent basis, gives existence to those very events,
which we are sometimes disposed to construe
into acts of unkindness, and deplore as pregnant
' Psa. Ixxxix. 14. + 1 John iv. 9.
40 OiN EXCESSIVE SORROW.
with the greatest evils. This assurance, there-
fore, should lead us to bow to his dispensations,
not only because they are on our part quite
unavoidable; but subniissively, under a convic-
tion, that if we *'
love him, and are the called
according to his purpose, all things will work
together for our good."* When the stream is
dried up, our condition is not hopeless nor cheer-
less, if we have constant access to the fountain,
and find it always overflowing with good. When
the creature interposes between God and us,
and we cannot contemplate the former for the
latter, surely it is not unkind that he should
remove the intervening vail, in order that he
may acquire his own perfect right, and at the
same time that we may be made substantially
and permanently happy.
Besides, are there no circumstances of alle-
viation ? Is it the worst possible evil that has
befallen you ? and is every aggravating associa-
tion concentrated in this one event ? Perhaps
you may be inclined to answer in the affirmative.
But inquire whether it might not have been
worse with you ; whether, instead of your present
pleasing hope of the immediate happiness of
your deceased friend, you might not have been
harassed with doubts, and fears, and apprehen-
" Rom. viii. 28,
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 41
sions respecting his safety; whether your ex-
pectation of being one day re-united around the
throne of God, might not have been involved in
the uncertainty of your own state, and of your
prospects of future blessedness ; and, if these
consolations be absent, whether you might not
have been in the same situation with your lost
relative, have passed the boundary of time, and
have been reduced to that state, where you
would be alike incapable of entering into the
joys, as of preparing for the services of eternity ?
Rehgion can trace mercy and comfort, even
in the darkest hour ; and her chaste rays, re-
flected from the pages of inspiration, will render
pervious the thickest gloom, since she exhibits
present good and future joy as the result of
present suffering improved. It is not only in
our actual circumstances that we trace the good-
ness of God, but in their ultimate and more
remote results ; since these form a part of that
discipline which is to prepare us for a future
happy existence in a world of everlasting bliss ;
and to lose sight of all these alleviating circum-
stances, is as unbecoming the character of the
Christian, as it is offensive to the Majesty of
heaven.
Unrepressed and intemperate grief leads us
to distrust the faithfulness and love of the Most
High) to call in question his justice, to arraign
4«
42 ON EXCESSIVE SORROW.
his providence : and thus discontent is fostered
in our bosom, corroding every comfort, distort-
ing all our views, and sapping the foundations
of our peace. When we first deviate from the
narrow path of rectitude, the gradations of error
are so frequent and imperceptible, that we are
conducted to a labyrinth of uncertainty, before
we are aware that we have quitted the way of
truth; and when once lost, it is with the utmost
difficulty we can regain our former positions.
It is not at once, but gradually, that we are
induced to entertain doubts concerning the wis-
dom and justice of God. We should shrink at
first from the decided avowa? of such a conclu-
sion ; the mind must be prepared for it, by the
slow and silent, but constant and equable opera-
tion of minor suspicions, which ultimately lead
to this unhappy result. Short-sighted intellect
may indeed be at a loss to discover a reason
why this particular affliction is necessary, and,
from being disappointed in the search, may be
induced to imagine that there was no cause; and
between this avowal and the immediate distrust
»f God's goodness and faithfulness, the gradation
is so gentle, that the latter is early presented to
the mind. This sentiment, rejected at first with
aversion, begins to be tolerated, from the unva-
ried repetition of the same image ; is then enter-
tauied with complacency ; and, finally, received
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 4'J
as a legitimate conclusion. This step once
gained, we can readily imagine how the heart
will be drawn aside, and suffer itself to disbelieve
the other attributes of the Deity, and to doubt
his wisdom, and power, and love. The peace
of the troubled bosom is destroyed ; and peevish-
ness, discontent, and fretfulness, are the conse-
quence. The temper is soured, because the
mind is exfJosed to a constant source of irrita-
tion, with no balm to sooth the angry passions,
or calm the aching heart. How watchful should
we be against the first beginnings of evil, since
we perceive how easily sorrow may become
excessive, and how certainly it will then hurry
us away into a thousand inconsistencies, which
the genius of Christianity blushes to acknow-
ledge.
This error may be committed by taking pains
to provoke and re-excite our grief, by a careful
recapitulation of circumstances which are in-
finitely dear to memory, till they become too
exquisitely painful to be borne. The first trans-
ports of sorrow, who would venture to oppose ?
Nature attempts her own relief, by these ex-
pressions of the wounds she has received; but
grief has a natural tendency to exhaust its own
violence; the feehngs become less acute from
fatigue ; and the gradual waste and expenditure
of their energy, at length brings the mind to a
44 ON EXCESSIVE SORROW.
State of tolerable composure. Christian principle
should now be invited to confirm what nature
has effected, for this state of quiescence is only
the prelude to a storm. The diminished excit-
ability of the mourner will soon be recruited,
and bis sufferings will be felt with redoubled
violence. Nothing short of Christianity and its
animating hopes can render permanent the calm,
by exchanging the quietude of exhausted power
for the peace and serenity of religious consolation.
Instead, however, of having recourse to this
powerful principle, we may, with all the ingenuity
of self-torture, busily engage ourselves in stimu-
lating the languid feelings, and goading the
already fluttering heart to increased action, by
the detail and recollection of every painful asso-
ciation connected with this sad event. Chris-
tianity demands not that we should be forgetful
of the dear comfort we have lost, but that we
should contemplate the affliction through the
medium of revelation ; and that we should stu-
diously endeavour to engage the mind with the
blessings designed, and the consolations provided
for the humble sufferer, rather than allow it to
become the prey of its own mournful images.
By the indulgence of excessive grief, the
health is decidedly endangered. It is difficult to
define the nature of the connexion which subsists
between the mind and the body ; our knowledge
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 45
respecting it is almost entirely limited to an
acquaintance with the effects produced by their
reciprocal action. Although the existence of
this sympathy may be denied by those who plead
for the unrestrained indulgence of their sorrow,
yet nothing can be more certain. We see every
day the one suffering with the other—the mani-
festations of mind enfeebled by disease, and the
animal economy materially disturbed by dis-
orders of the mind. It is well known how in-
stantaneously joy or grief will pall the appetite
;
that it is impossible to cure many derangements
of the animal syStem, whilst any cause of mental
irritation exists; and that many maladies are
immediately produced by the influence of de-
pressing passions. The indulgence of excessive
grief, then, is by no means innocent, since, al-
though its immediate effects may be escaped, it
may still lay the foundation of insidious disease,
which, though long protracted, may in the end
terminate fatally. Nor is this caution unneces-
sary ; for many mourners practise a kind of self-
deception, by allowing themselves to believe
their health is not endangered, provided no im-
mediately serious ravages are perceptible to
themselves, while yet their strength is visibly
declining. It is true, the vigour thus impaired
may be recovered, and that quickly; yet care is
^ecessary ; and when we recollect, that in the
4ld ON EXCESSIVE SORROW.
code of laws to which we profess to yield obedi-
ence, there is a command which says, *'
Thou
shalt not kill ;" and reflect that every prohibition
implies a positive injunction; we must surely
allow that such a precept requires that all lawful
means be assiduously employed for the preser-
vation of our own life, as well as the lives of
others.
Life is desirable; during its rapid progress
our eternal destiny is fixed ; and when the body
can no longer be inhabited, the immortal spirit
which actuated it, is immediately translated to
the enjoyment of exquisite pleasure or endless
punishment. It is rendered sensible of the ex-
haustless treasures of infinite love, or of the
deserved anger of a just and holy God. This
gives to life its chief value : now is the accepted
time, now is the day of grace ; and are we yet
prepared to die ? With what thankfulness should
we enjoy, with what care should we cherish, life
and health, until we gain substantial evidence
that we are ripening for an inheritance with the
saints in light, until we enjoy a pleasing hope of
eternal felicity
!
And even supposing that, on this head, we are
as completely at rest as was the Apostle Paul,
when he said, " to die is gain," alluding to him-
self; yet we should remember, that, connected
with this expression, is the assertion, " for me
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 47
to live is Christ."* We cannot be said to live
to Christ, if we do not embrace every opportunity
of employing the talents we possess in offices of
piety, and the various and constantly increasing
duties of disinterested benevolence. The Chris-
tian's is an active life; he is called to do good,
and to glorify God. How many are there whose
earthly happiness materially, if not essentially,
depends upon us ! how many whose sorrows we
may sooth, whose burdens we may contribute to
support, whose miseries may be lessened, whose
ignorance may be dispelled, whose happiness
may be enhanced by our exertions ! Performed
on right principles, these things are acceptable
to Christ; and we should recollect, that it is
only during the short uncertain space of life
that we shall enjoy an opportunity of pleasing
G<jd in this way, and of being thus useful to
others.
The same may be observed with regard to
the eternal interests of our fellow-men. The
light of truth dispels the darkness, by which the
God of this world rules ; and Christians should
shine as lights in the world, pointing out the
way to glory. How impeneti'able the gloom by
which we ai*e surrounded ; and how inadequate,
how comparatively feeble and glimmering is the
* PhU. i. 21.
48 ON EXCESSIVE SORROW.
faint light emitted by the followers of our Re-
deemer ! Let us not be among those who vo-
luntarily extinguish their light, or put their
candle under a bushel; let us rather most care-
fully preserve our health, as the choicest earthly
blessing. May we be quickened by the lov e of
Christ, and according to his holy precept and
example, diligently diffuse the light of life, by
our w^ords, our spirit, and our conduct !
But again, a degree of sorrow which has
escaped the foregoing limitations, may become
excessive by its protraction. It is not pretended
that sorrow or mourning should have a limited
duration, and that regret for the loss of the dear
objects of our fond esteem should quickly find
a termination. This, indeed, would seem to be
the effect of UgMy esteeming the chastisements
of the Almighty ; or to arise from the want of
proper affection for the deceased, whose loss we
cease to deplore because we do not feel. This
would be highly inconsistent with the Christian
character. But it is distinctly asserted, that a
degree of sorrmc^ which might fairly be allowed
to the mourner when suffering the first emotions
of grief, may still become sinful by its continu-
ance ; and that it does so, when its expression is
incompatible with the discharge of the duties
assigned us by Providence, when it unfits us for
necessary intercourse with society, when it em-
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 4^
bitters oiir present comforts, and incapacitates
lis for worshipping and praising God.
If it be asserted that these limitations are too
precise to be universally applicable, and that,
however true they may be as general rules, they
will still admit of particular exceptions ; who is
there that will not plead his title to individual
exemption? Who is there that does not fancy
his own to be the weightier affliction? Who
would not determine his to be the precise cir-
cumstances which would admit of excessive sor-
row ? The great mass of mankind are deceived
by their general reception of particular precepts,
as speculatively true, which they individually
and practically disregard. Thus all men think
all men mortal but themselves; they will yield
their cordial assent to the sinfulness of human
nature, provided their individual freedom from
its pollution may be granted; they will acknow-
ledge the danger of certain errors and tempta-
tions, to almost all others but themselves. Thus
are they deceived, saying, " Peace, peace, when
there is no peace;" they lose sight of the im-
mediate connexion of their happiness with the
exercise of constant obedience ; they busy them-
selves in discovering the vices and exposing
The errors of others, and applying appropriat(?
remedies, while they forget their own heart.
To allow individual exemption from the in-
5
50 ON EXCESSIVE SORROW.
-Huence of these restraints, would be to render
them perfectly inert ; impartial investigation will
evince the universality of their application. It
may, indeed, be pleaded, that all your hope and
joy was bound up and centered in the life of the
deceased, that you were abundantly happy in
his society, and that, while permitted to enjoy
it, you knew no care or sorrow, and wished for
no addition to your joy. Yet does not this prove
the necessity of the affliction ; even because of
your inordinate attachment ? Perhaps you will
conceive that you have no comfort remaining,
or you will regret that your friend is removed
from a sphere of eminent usefulness, and will
fondly imagine that his habitual preparedness
for heaven rendered him peculiarly fitted for a
longer residence on earth : you will deplore the
very short time you enjoyed his society on this
wilderness world, and the long and dreary night
of mourning and solitude which you have before
you.
It would be quite endless to attempt the
enumeration of the infinitely varied pleas for
immoderate sorrow which the different circum-
stances of individual mourners will elicit, or to
expose the ingenuity by which a thousand pro-
tean forms of excuse are invented; yet we shall
find that they all resolve themselves into the
powerful principle of selfishness.
ON EXCESSIVE SORROW. 51
The desire of present freedom from pain is
natural to man; " but should it be according to
thy mind:"* Wilt thou, O vain man, contend
with Him that formed thee? Wilt thou bring
thy judgment into opposition with the decrees
of Infinite Wisdom ? Shall the short-sighted
reasoning of mortality be placed in competition
with the determinations of Omniscience ? Shall
thy blind and foolish self-love be opposed to the
designs of Infinite Goodness, and mercy, and
love ? Wilt thou, a perishing creature, presume
to give laws to Omnipotence, and to obtrude thy
puny will against His who doth all things well
;
whose boundless presence fills every heart, and
directs every event ; who governs all things by
his power, and without whose supervision not
the smallest circumstance can come to pass?
Reflect on the incongruity of such conduct ; con-
sider thy situation as his servant, and the perfec-
tions of the Almighty Disposer of all things.
Seriously recollect, that impatience under his
chastening hand is highly oflfensive. The all-
wise Jehovah afliicts with the most gracious
design ; his chastisements are sent on the kindest
errands of love. What ingratitude to despise his
correction, to murmur at his dispensations, and
to be impatient for the removal of affliction

before it shall have accomplished the end he has
proposed ! Surely, if we reflect on the compar-
atively minute section of our lives dedicated to
^this salutary discipline; if we appreciate the
long intervals of ease and prosperity frequently
allotted to us, the many comforts with which
our darkest hours are interspersed, and the
secure refuge from the storm which is provided
for our safety and comfort ; discontent and im-
patience will be banished from our bosom, every
expression of immoderate grief will be hushed
to repose, and our hearts will be animated by
affeetionate obedience to the will of Him in
whom we live, and move, and have our being,
and who is infinitely worthy to receive our hum-
ble adorations, and our highest ascriptions af
praise.
53
CHAPTER IV.
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
A DISTINGUISHING feature of the Christian re-
ligion, is the state of trial and of suffering it
involves ; as the grand mean of perfecting the
character of its disciples, bringing out their prin-
ciples into active exercise, proving their sincerity,
purifying their hearts, elevating their affections,
chastening and improving their temper and dis-
positions, and as the prelude to that eternal rest
and happiness which are reserved for the people
of God, for those icho are made perfect through
sufferings.
It is indeed true, that religion's " ways are
ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are paths
of peace.''* Yet it is equally true, that, to fallen
man, the obedience it requires is repugnant, the
duties it enforces are painful : and the sufferings
inseparably connected with its exercise, so far
from communicating peace, serve to excite the
angry turbulence of our nature, and to fill the

heart with innumerable solicitudes. It is only
when the mind becomes convinced of the infinite
excellence of divine truth, of the holiness of its
precepts, and the importance of the realities it
develops ; when the heart is animated with the
love of God, and with its dependence on Him in
whose favour is life, that it can unfeignedly em-
brace the self-denying precepts of Christianity,
that it can rejoice to " suffer all things," that it
may " win Christ, and be found in him." Chris-
tianity does not consist in a certain scheme of
doctrines and precepts, which demand our assent
:
it is a practical principle, a principle of action,
constantly and universally operative, giving its
peculiar tone and temper to the entire character,
and pervading and influencing every part of the
conduct. It is not a principle which we can
assume to-day, and dispense with to-morrow,
according to our particular fcehngs and interests
:
but we must be alike governed by its influence,
in whatever circumstances we may be placed.
We are not required, nor would it be prudent
or proper, to be always talking about religion
;
but by our example, which will speak louder than
words, we should evince its holy tendency, and
regulate our conduct by its dictates.
But this by the way; for, while the genius of
Christianity requires us to«be active in doing the
will of God, it demands our passive obedience :
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.. 55
k teaches us to suffer, and exhibits a state of
trial as the only way to a haven of eternal rest.
The voice of affliction silently, but energetically,
whispers, " My son, give me thine heart."*
God demands the whole heart : he will reign in
the affections of his people, and requires their
will to be ceded implicitly to his commands.
Sorrow serves to prove the heart, and to discover
to us whether tliis is really the case—whether
we can resign our blessings into the hands of
Him who gave them, with cheerfulness; and
can still praise Him, though he sees fit to smite
our choicest earthly comforts. It informs us
whether we love God supremely, and can readily
yield our present pleasures to advance his glory
and honour.
Perhaps it is more difficult to suffer on Chris-
tian principles, than it is to be actively engaged
in doing good: and if so, the more necessary
and important will be the process by which we
may be taught to glorify God in suffering for his
sake. Affliction accomplishes this object, since it
teaches the necessity of cultivating, with the
greatest care and diligence, those graces to which
the heart is particularly adverse, and especially
those which interfere with our individual feelings,
and spirit, and temper.
*
Prov. xxiii. 26.
56 ON THE ADVANTAGES OP SORROW.
Almost strangers to the exercise of humility^
patience, resignation, or obedience, but for the
goodness of God in afflicting us, it becomes us to
rejoice even in tribulation, and to receive the
chastisements of the Almighty with meekness
and love. No trial or difficulty should destroy
our trust in God : these are intended to confirm
our faith and hope, that we may " be steadfast,
unmoveable, always abounding in the work of
the Lord."*
" For this I say, time is short ; it remaineth,
therefore, that they that have wives, be as
though they had none ; and they that weep, as
though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as
though they rejoiced not ; for the fashion of this
world passeth away."f If, indeed, spiritual and
eternal things were more distinctly seen, and
impressively felt by us, we should walk more by
faith, and less by sight. Faith is a noble and an'
animating principle ; and whatever sacrifices of
present enjoyment may be required by the means
employed to generate or preserve this principle
until it be ripened for immortality, and exchanged
for the full fruition of God in heaven, we shall
be gainers in the end: " For I reckon, that the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory that shall be revealed
in us."|

Grief silently but eloquently teaches the value
of intercourse with God, and proves that strength
and support are to be derived from communion
with him. Intimate access to a compassionate
Saviour is a balm for every sorrow :
*'
Pour out
your heart before him : God is a refuge for us."*
We have access to him with boldness.
We are not only allowed^ but encouraged, to
speak all our mind to him. We are permitted
to utter, and enlarge, with unrestricted freedom,
upon every complaint, in the immediate presence
of Him who numbers and keeps the tears of his
children, and who delights to relieve and abun-
dantly bless those that mourn. This is an un-
speakable privilege, and it is enhanced by the
promise that those who sow in tears shall reap
in joy. " Light, is sown for the righteous, and
gladness for the upright in heart :"t and to those
who continue waiting upon God, we may confi-
dently expect the dawning of a brighter day.
Already the light of the Sun of Righteousness
begins to irradiate the gloom, and the gladdening
horizon will proclaim that he is risen with healing
in his wings. Presently the dark clouds which
now envelop you shall pass away ; and your days
shall be like " the clear shining of the sun after
rain."—" Wait then upon the Lord: be of good

courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart i^
wait, I say, on the Lord."*
It is well that we are not left to our own
guidance, and that all events are entirely re-
moved from the possibility of our controlling
them in opposition to the will of God. For, so
averse is the heart to the salutary though unpa-
latable discipline of suffering, that if we could
escape the trials and the sorrows with which a
kind Providence encompasses our path, we
should eagerly adopt those measures which ap-
pear to promise an immunity from pain. Could
we choose the sphere in which we would move,
we should select a long and uninterrupted series
of present ease and temporal welfare ; we should
prefer a situation of respectability and affluence
;
and nothing but prosperous circumstances and
unclouded prospects would enter into our calcu-
lation.
But our heavenly Father is too wise and good
to trust us with the disposal of ourselves. He
knows our feeble frame, and in tender pity he
appoints those chastisements, from which we in-
deed should shrink, but which are necessary for
our present happiness and eternal welfare. He
knows the temptations inseparably connected
with a life of ease: and while we are sighing
* Psa. xxvii. 14.
ON THE ADVANTAGKS OF SORROW. 59
aftet riches, and honour, and prosperity, he is
appointing us to live in poverty, obscurity, and
affliction. It is most for his honour and our own
good that we should not move in the sphere on
which we may have fixed our hearts, but which
is thickly strewed with snares, and dangers, and
temptations.
And, indeed, it pleased God to make the Cap-
tain of our salvation perfect through sufferings.
In a most emphatic sense, the life of the Author
of Christianity was a life of suffering ; and He
has left us an example of patience and obedi-
ence, while he has smoothed the rugged way,
and divested it of its native terrors, by having
pursued this path to heaven, where he now sits
enthroned in light which is inaccessible, and
calls his people to follow him. And if they
would be with him where he is, why should
they hesitate to tread in his footsteps, or fear
the thorny way ? There is no affliction or pri-
vation which the Christian is called to suffer
here, to which Jesus was a stranger ; for he has
** borne our griefs and carried our infirmities."
Since it has pleased the Father to bruise him,
who was his only-begotten Son, and who was
especially the object of his tenderest regard, it
is not surprising that his people should be called
to share the same burden, nor that they should
esteem it light, and easy to be borne.
60 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
Besides, he who knew the extremes of hu-
man wo, has promised (after they have suffered
awhile) rest for the weary : he has invited the
heavy-laden to himself, for he will give them
peace and rest on earth by his presence, while
he has prepared for them a crown of glory which
fadeth not away in the mansions of the blessed :
He knows that it is sin which invests affliction
with its fearful aspect; and that this is the
grand mean of discovering, in the hearts of his
children, the secret lurking-places and fastnesses
of this cruel enemy. Were it not for the influ-
ence of sin over the heart, we should be enabled,
in the exercise of faith, and hope, and patience,
to rejoice in tribulation ; we should no longer
be averse to its corrective discipline, however
painful ; we should quietly rest ourselves in God,
under every changing scene ; we should rejoice
in being counted vi^orthy to suffer for his sake.
But for the agency of sin, we should be bewil-
dered by no clouded prospects, we should be
harassed by no distressing doubts and perplexi-
ties ; we should be agitated by no fearful re-
trospect; and we should be reheved from the
recollection of mispent hours, cold affections,
and innumerable wanderings from the Rock of
our salvation. These we contemplate as in a
ffreat decree the causes which have rendered
necessary the affliction under which we sufien
OTJ THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 61
Solid peace of mind will be thus obtained, in
exchange for that feeble security which arises
from distorted views of ourselves, our prin-
ciples, and conduct, or from carelessness and
neglect.
This tranquillity is confirmed by the aug-
mented capacity of the mind for the enjoyment
of the pleasures of religion. Suffering has an
immediate tendency, not only to multiply the
sources of our moral happiness, but to give such
an increased sensibility to the conscience, so much
additional power of discrimination to the judg-
ment, and of renewed fervour to the affections,
that we become more careful in our walk and
conversation, more heavenly-minded, more at-
tached to the ways of religion and the oracles
of divine truth; we increasingly fear sinning
against God, and in walking more circumspectly
we obtain peace.
When affliction accomplishes the design with
which God has commissioned it, it produces
repentance and contrition : for, *' behold this
self-same thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea^
what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indigna-
tion, yea, what fear, yea, v/hat vehement desire,
yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge !"* In all
•2Cor.vihll,
6
62 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
this, it is evident, that repentance forms the
groundwork of the superstructure, and that
" godly sorrow" is the great end and design of
sanctified affliction. It is sin alone which ren-
ders painful that suffering which is intended to
discover to us its secret malignity and influence.
We are probably by no means aware of its
extent: we may be slumbering in placid ease,
flattering ourselves that we are travelling with
our faces towards a heavenly world, and pre-
paring for its blest inheritance; while, in fact,
we are unprofitable serv^ants; while we come
under the curse denounced against those who
are "at ease in Zion;" while we are making
no progress in the divine life, but are rather
retrograde, than advancing day by day in the
knowledge and love of God ; while we are con-
stantly deviating from the line of rectitude pre-
scribed by the word of God, and while our
hearts are estranged from the fountain of living
waters by a thousand cc^res and solicitudes.
But we are visited by affliction ; we are brought
acquainted with ourselves, and are obliged to fly
for refuge to the only Source of real comfort
;
the visionary fabric of our own righteousness
is dissipated, and we discover in our bosoms,
instead of peace and holiness, nothing but folly,
sin, and error. Our attention has been absorbed
by objects of inferior importance, while we have
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 63
scarcely fixed one wandering affection upon God.
We find much sin, where we had fancied there
existed little else than purity ; and thus are we
brought to repent and confess our sin to God,
and to seek his pardon through the sacrifice of
a crucified Redeemer. We are awakened from
a state of lethargy as to our present and future
prospects, and obUvion of our past mercies, to
a consciousness of our aberrations from God.
It is well to contemplate the gracious Dis-
penser of afliiction, rather than refer its origin
to those secondary causes which are governed by
the great First Cause, While we confine our
views to the events which have been appointed to
accomplish the trials with which we are visited,
we shall be involved in endless perplexities.
We shall, perhaps, regret that our conduct has
been instrumental in bringing about the very
cause of our sorrow ; and shall imagine a thou-
sand neglected opportunities of having escaped
the present source of our affliction. We shall
be equally anxious to calculate the events to
which this may give rise, to devise plans where-
by we may avoid our burdens, and elude the
consequences with which they are attended.
Thus will the mind be harassed by care, so long
as its finite views are engaged on the subject of
its sorrow ; but when we regard a gracious God
accomphshing his designs in us, through the
64 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
medium of his chastening providence, all is
harmony and beauty. We admire his goodness
in afflicting us, his compassion in soothing and
alleviating our cares, his love in leading us to
repentance, to a more intimate acquaintance
with himself, and to a more complete knovi^ledgc
of our own hearts.
Jehovah is our refuge and strength, when " the
storm of the terrible ones is as a blast against
the wall." We learn our own helplessness and
dependence, and we come to him as the only
source of consolation : we raise the half-express-
ed desire to heaven, and he is ready to attend
unto oLir cry. In his own time, God will work
deliverance for us, and he is willing to give us
every consolation ; to heal our back-slidings, and
afford us peace—a blessing infinitely greater
than the possession we have lost, if enjoyed
without the smiles of his reconciled counte-
nance.
Affliction invites us to pray to God for sup-
port under our trials, and for their removal,
when consistent with the will of their compas-
sionate Author. If sorrow produces a good effect
upon our hearts, and we derive any lasting ad-
vantage from suffering, one of the first lessons
we shall learn, will be, the vanity and folly of
looking to the creature for assistance and sup-
port, and the danger of placing our confidence
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 65
m any thing short of the consoling presence of
God. Our dearest earthly comforts are removed,
and whither shall we go for consolation ?
The world can offer no equivalent for our loss;
it may indeed present its unmeaning condolence,
it may invite us to join in its recreations, it may
exhibit its pleasures as a source of peace. But
if we are not yet throughly convinced of the
emptiness of what the world calls pleasure, and
the unsatisfactory nature of the happiness it
affords, we shall now be taught this important
lesson; for engaging in its proffered amuse-
ments, and tasting all the happiness it boasts,
w^e may indeed feel its excitement for a time,
but the result will be the dissipation of pain and
mourning for a moment, only to recur with in-
creasing violence from the exhaustion which the
spirits have suffered, and from the conscious
feeling, that here is no rest for the weary, no
consolation for the distressed. We seek for
peace, but there is none; for quietude, but it
does, and in scenes hke these ever will, elude
our pursuit. Society will not tolerate the feelings
of the mourner, it will not indulge his gloomy
speculations. This would cast a chilling damp
upon its gaieties, and mildew all its pleasures.
In society, the sorrowful must be gay, and con-
tribute his share to the general hilarity :
this he
cannot do; and the powers of his mind are en-

66 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
feebled by the continued effort to wear a face of
pleasure with a heart of pain.
Neither can he derive peace from pursuits of
a Horary nature. These may enhven his soU-
tude, and cheer his darkest hours, when held in
subservience to objects of greater importance.
They present a fund of pleasure which will
never cloy—an amusement which provides the
capacity for its enjoyment, as well as the source
whence it is derived ; and which is constantly
increasing with every fresh acquisition of know-
ledge. The mind of the man of taste is strength-
ened and refreshed by reading ; and the sources
of his pleasure are augmented by a thousand
associations of which another is incapable : and
the more amply this taste is indulged, the
greater will be his sensibility, the more multi-
plied and lasting will be his gratifications. Yet
these pursuits are insufficient ; for the time will
arrive when they can no longer be enjoyed : the
mind becomes fatigued from constant exercise
;
it loses its elasticity, and consequent power of
action, from unremitting exertion, and is no
longer capable of receiving pleasure from its
appropriate stimuli. A period of rest and re-
laxation is required, and where now will be
found a refuge from the inroads of grief? What
can quiet the troubled bosom during the sleepless
night ? What can give peace to the agitated
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 67
heart, through the wearisome days of indisposi-
tion, or divert those cares which rob the mind
of its power to enjoy Uterary pleasure ? Some
other source of comfort must be devised ; and
yet there is none to which a rational being can
resort for certain consolation. When his books
fail of affording pleasure, (and they must fail,
from the alliance of the powers of the soul with
mortality, and its consequent susceptibility of
fatigue and exhaustion,) he has no refuge.
But the mourner may seek for happiness in
the domestic pleasures which are still left him.
And yet, with the late instructive lesson full in
his memory, of the uncertainty of domestic hap-
piness, it would be the extreme of folly to look
for comfort from a source so frail, which a
moment may destroy. Depending on the con-
tinuance of the slender thread of life, which the
motion of an atom may divide, and on an abso-
lute freedom, in the social circle, from the
slightest cause of infeUcity, the foundation of
domestic happiness has been undermined : and
when the sufferer reflects, that perhaps only
yesterday he was gratulating himself on the
unclouded sunshine of his days, cheered and
animate4 by that sun to his domestic system,
which has now suffered an eternal eclipse, he
cannot surely rest in this as a source of conso-
lation. He may indeed rejoice in the comforts
68 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
he has left, but he will not seek them for solid
peace of mind. Thus is he taught the impossi-
bility of the world's affording him happiness ; he
learns that the fascinating pursuits of literature
will not procure his freedom from the inroads of
care ; and is guarded from estimating too highly,
and placing his affections too intensely, on his
yet remaining comforts.
Whither, then, must he flee for rest and peace ?
He is not left without comfort and without hope,
destitute of support and consolation, a prey to
hopeless sorrow ! For there is a voice, saying,
**
I am with you always : I will not leave you
comfortless. Peace I leave with you, my peace
I give unto you : not as the world giveth, give I
unto you."* Religion is the only source of solid
peace. When, and only when we enjoy these
comforts, can we be happy in appealing to Hea-
ven. Without a direct reference to the Holy
Spirit, the Comforter, as the author of serenity,
we shall be unhappy : but if we trust in him
alone for support, we shall be little anxious
about coming events, for we shall be possessed
of that better part which can never be taken
from us. Come, then, to this source of every
blessing, and with humble faith implore the
Divine Majesty for restinhim; pray for patience
* Matt, xxviii. 20; John xiv. 27.
ON THE ADVAiNTAGES OF SORROW. 69
and resignation to his chastening hand, and
entreat deliverance in his time only, and with
entire submission to the guidance and disposal
of Infinite Wisdom. Leaving yourself in his
hands, you will be secure; your mind will be
freed from corroding anxieties, and filled with
that peace which passeth understanding.
Another important lesson may be derived from
this affliction, viz. the folly of placing our depen-
dence on earthly comforts, and seeking happi-
ness from any objects which do not raise our
thoughts and affections far beyond the present
passing scene. We are feelingly reminded that
the comforts we enjoy are not our own, that they
belong to God, that they are the product of his
bounty; and that as he is almighty to bestow
his blessings, so is he all^dse to withdraw them
for his own glory, or for our benefit. Mortality
is stamped upon every enjoyment. A single
moment may dissipate all our fairy scenes of
happiness, and leave us without one ray of hope
or comfort to be derived from inferior objects.
God is our refuge during the storms of sorrow
;
and since he is likewise the Author of every
blessing, would it not be wiser to rejoice in hitih
as our sun and shield, to protect us from danger
during the hours of prosperity, and to guide our
wandering feet ?
If our affections were but fixed half so ear-
70 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
nestly on the Author and Giver of every good
and perfect gift, as they too frequently are ex-
clusively on the gift itself, we should little fear
the cares and troubles of life ; and our happiness
would be established on a basis which death
itself could not impair. But until mortality shall
be exchanged for everlasting life, we shall carry
about with us the evil tendencies of the heart
;
and these will incline us from God, and fix our
hearts on earthly objects and pursuits. Yet we
should learn not to dote too intensely on the
comforts we still enjoy, not to love these the
more inordinately because we have fewer objects
to engage our attention ; since this would be to
defeat the great end of affliction, which is to
wean our hearts from this world and its idols.
The human mind is naturally disposed to
expand its feeble powers in the exercise of be-
nevolence to the creature simply, and to rest
with delight on the objects which immediately
surround it, rather than on God. Nor is this
surprising : for, to love those with whom reci-
procal acts of kindness are exchanged, requires
no effort—it is natural, as to hunger or thirst
;
and the mind is restless and uneasy, unless
engaged with its favourite pursuit. But to love
God, and to prefer him, requires the habitual
exercise of a superinduced principle, a principle
of faith, a principle totally adverse to the bia«
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 71
of the human mind, and which grace alone can
implant. God is a spirit ; nor is it easy, till we
love him in sincerity, to form just conceptions of
him who is infinite in holiness, power, and love
;
while the objects of earthly love are present to
Our senses, and thus acquire an ascendancy, a
commanding influence over the heart, which
aims to be progressively increasing, and would
aspire to occupy the whole soul.
The world is the narrow circle in which we
are appointed to move, from the circumference
of which, every thought, feeling, and action
should converge to God, as its centre. We are
too much disposed to fix the world as the centre,
towards which all our desires and affections
gravitate, and in which every thought and feel-
ing, drawn from the circumference of action,
should meet and rest. We forget that the pre-
sent is a season of preparation for a future state*
We lose sight of the great design of living, the
promotion of the glory of God, in the 'indulgence
of selfish gratification : we forget that we are his
creatures, and we live as if we formed ourselves,
and were our own.
Even supposing we acknowledge our depen-*-
dence upon God, his sovereign authority over us,
his entire property in us, and that he is entitled
to our supreme regards ;
yet we shall find, that
prevailing earthly attachments exert an injurious;
^^ ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORKOW.
influence over the mind. They dispute the pos-
session of the heart with the Lord of Hosts, and
challenge their full share of the affections. The
Christian's love grows cold, and consequently his
vitality inert. He is no longer active and zealous
in the cause of religion, but imagines a thousand
excuses for indolence : he is no longer diligent
in the discharge of his duties, and lightly esteems
the worship of the Most High. In secret, he is
disinclined to inquire into his motives, and to
examine the principles of his conduct ; in his
intercessions, he is lifeless and formal ; his bosom
is filled with worldly projects, and his time occu-
pied with the selfish enjoyment of his unnumbered
mercies. He forgets the hand which provides
even these, and Ipoks no farther than to second-
ary causes as their origin. He seldom thinks
about religion, and when he does, it is more as a
matter of speculation than as the grand pursuit
of his whole life. He readily admits excuses for
the dereliction of duty, and can scarcely find
time for any engagement which does not directly
or remotely tend to strengthen his attachment
to earthly objects. He thinks, speaks, and acts
as a good citizen of this world, and not as one
who is mindful of *'
that better country," to which
it should be his great aim to hasten. Christianity
may be kept alive in such a heart as this, but it
liannot grow and flourish : it may, indeed, put
<5N THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 73
forth the sickly leaves and variegated hues of
profession ; but it cannot produce good fruit to
the praise and glory of God.
Heaven should be the Christian's home, and
God the great source and object of his delight*
The duties of rehgion should engage his whole
soul ; and its pleasures, its consolations, and its
prospects should so fill the heart, as to leave
little room for the caprices of earthly love. Yet
it is obvious that this is quite impossible, when
the mind is fully occupied with the concerns, and
the heart solely absorbed by the affections of
mortality ; and that in proportion as this is the
case, so will the growth and exercise of Christian
principle be stunted and repressed.
Heaven-born Christianity cannot be made to
flourish in an earthly soil. The warm hue of
this sickly exotic proclaims that it is "ready to
die," and that the only method of preserving its
vitality, is to cut it down, and remove it to a
situation more congenial with its nature. This
is God's gracious design in sending affliction.
As a tender husbandman, he looks upon every
plant in his vineyard; he perceives that there
are some which are sickly and unfruitful ; yet he
does not destroy them, but graciously removes
the soil into which they have wandered, that by
rooting more deeply in their native plain, and de-
riving tkeir support from its pure source, they
7
74 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
may bud, blossom, and bring forth fruit to his
glory.
A compassionate Jehovah sees the injurious
influence of creature attachments ; and to warn
us of our danger, he kindly takes away their ob-
ject; and is thus pleased to weaken our interest
©n earth, and strengthen our desires after him-
self. He knows precisely where our affections
are most deeply fixed : and as he will not tolerate
a rival in our hearts, he beneficently removes
the idol ; and thus informs us at once, that we
were inordinately attached to present scenes,
declares the sin for which he afflicts us, and
invites us to himself as an all-sufficient portion.
As our hearts become detached from earth, so
will they be fixed in heaven ; and thus every pur-
pose is most kindly effected through the agency
of sorrow. Divine goodness commissions afliic-
tion, to divest the world of its enchantments, to
unmask its delusive features, strip its pleasures
of the glittering tinsel in which they are arrayed^
disclose its real nature, and unvail its hidden de*
formities. We are enabled to look on its pass-
ing scenes with composure, and candidly to ac^
knowledge its emptiness, its entire unworthiness
of our affections. Our thoughts are abstracted
from its vanities, and our conviction is deepened
(if the infinite importance of eternal objects.
While suffering is rendered useful to convince
ON THE ADVANTAGES OP SORROW. '75
the judgment, it is equally powerful to correct
the heart, to restore its obliquities, and lead it
to drink deeply of the spirit of the Saviour.
This end is accomplished by discovering to us
its corruptions, and their secret influence on the
conduct of the life. During the halcyon days of
prosperity, perhaos we made few inquiries con-
cerning its state ; we conceived all was going on
well, because we were in peace; and we were
so dazzled by the brilliance of our prospects as
to be unable to discern the deviations we had
gradually, though insensibly, made from the
narrow path of rectitude. But when we feel the
weight of sorrow, we begin to scrutinize within
;
and we are struck by the existence of palpable
deformities, which we had overlooked before, or
even mistaken for excellencies. We become ac-
quainted with ourselves, and with our distance
from the pure standard of divine truth. We
rise from these humiliating considerations, with
mournful reflections on the past, but with fixed
determination to oppose these very corruptions,
in the strength of divine grace ; and are stimu-
lated to seek after greater attainments of holi-
ness, and to walk in the fear of the Lord.
It is justly observed in medicine, that the
knowledge of a disease is more than half its cure.
So it is with the mind. It will slumber in secu-
rity, unconscious of evil ; but when awakened by
76 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
sorrow, it discovers the secret perversity of its
actions, and is animated to oppose its wander-
ings. The principles of divine grace are called
into more vigorous exercise : and as one devia-
tion from the path of rectitude paves the way
for another, and successively renders opposition
to evil less and less energetic and effective, so
will the foundations of virtue be strengthened by
exercise ; the delusive flatteries of vice and of the
world will each day exert an inferior influence
;
and at the same time, opposition to their power
will be daily increased and rendered more suc-
cessful, till it ripens into a habit, the involuntary
product of an active principle, inwrought into
the soul, and interwoven with the life.
Thus is the heart prepared for greater attain-
ments in piety and knowledge, and strengthened
to enjoy the smiles of prosperity without danger,
and to encounter the frowns of adversity with-
out dismay : whilst, by discovering how great are
its propensities to evil, affliction excites a fear of
oflfending God, and wandering from his way, and
is admirably calculated to preserve the Christian
from falling into the snares of his subtle adver-
sary. He is taught to avoid whatever may have
even a remote tendency to irritate his sorrow;
he is desirous of not offending God, and there-
fore prays, and earnestly strives, to behave with
meekness and gentleness, and submission to the
will of Heaven.
ON THE ADVANTAGES OP SORROW. 7t
Affliction is the means of perfecting the
Christian's character : deprived of its animating
influence, he would lose much of the worth of
his greatest pleasures, and would be debarred
from attaining the most valuable principles. It
is an affecting proof of the depravity of human
nature, that we so. frequently need this painful
exercise to remind us of our duties and of our de-
pendence upon God, to excite our diligence and
quicken our exertions in the cause of Christ, to
teach us the important lesson ofour mortality, and
the necessity of being active while it is yet day,
since the "night cometh, when no man can work."
It is a proof of the loving-kindness of God to
his people, that when he sees them wandering
from himself, the fountain of blessedness, he
should graciously recall them: for he chastens
us in love ; his corrections are lighter than our
sins ; he compassionates our helpless condition ^
and, while he suits his mercies to our sorrowing
state, he causes us to feel only just so much aa
will excite us to lift up our hearts to himself.
The wicked enjoy his common favours ;
but it is.
for the good that he reserves his choicest bless-
ings, and particularly those of an afflictive
nature. While "our Father which is in heaven"
is governed, as to the nature and weight of our
trials, by the most enlarged affection, he has an
especial regard to our good, since he administers

end to be accompHshed : even to make us more
wise, more humble, more holy, more teachable
and childlike, more dependent upon him, more
devoted to his service. He does not wantonly
or unnecessarily inflict pain, but to quicken us
in the exercise of faith, and hope, and every
virtuous active principle. He would have us to
know more of himself, and to grow in confor-
mity with the image of our Redeemer. He
wills that our understandings should be enlarged
to see more beauty in the Saviour, that our
hearts should be expanded, and our affections
guided by his love; that our principles should
be tried and estabhshed; and that the love of
holiness should be more deeply written in our
practice. He aims to make us active and zealous
Christians, that we may show forth his praise, and
prove the sincerity of our attachment to his cause.
This great end is accomplished by exciting
in us an earnest diligence to search and try our
hearts and thoughts, our dispositions and actions,
and to se^ that they be right with God. This
circumstance alone would render affliction un-
speakably valuable ; because it is only by a dis-
tant and confused view of our conduct that we
are so frequently deceived as to our motives
and principles ; while we discover, on closer
inspection, that these are very unlike what we
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF S0RReW. 79
had expected. From a distance we behold a
lovely landscape, adorned with nature's richest
attire; and we are induced to imagine that
nothing but beauty and excellence can here be
traced; that no venomous reptile lurks along
the verdant plain; that no poisonous shrub
grows unseen beneath the protection of the
stately oak ; and that the stillness which reigns
around is never interrupted by the accents of
distress, but only by the soft murmurings of the
distant stream.
In the dream of imagination, we conceive
that happiness reigns in the sequestered cot,
whose issuing smoke informs us of the abode of
man ; and that innocence and joy are alone in-
habitants of this peaceful region. Yet how dif-
ferent, and how distant from the truth is this
idea! A closer inspection will discover much
to deplore—much to dislike. So it is with our-
selves : we appear best, placed with our own
features at a distance, while a more intimate
acquaintance brings to our sight many an un-
subdued passion, many a turbulent and sinful
thought, many an earthly bias, and a thousand
evils which would have escaped unseen, but for
the afflictive event which has induced us to look
within our own bosom, and to seek acquaintance
with our own hearts. Perhaps much thought-
lessness and levity have hitherto marked our
80 ON THE ADVANTAGES OP SORROW.
conduct ; and that cheerfulness which the geniuK
of Christianity demands, has too frequently de-
generated into an offensive inconsideration.
Affliction tends to weaken the influence of this
faihng, and to show us the value of sobriety and
vigilance.
If we bear correction as we ought, if we are
desirous of reaping the benefit intended by God,
we shall be brought to inquire into his design
:
and besides, the necessary consequence of this
trial, and its attendant temporary abstraction
from our customary pursuits, is, that we are
obliged to commune with our own hearts ; and
it is almost impossible not to be engaged on such
occasions with the most serious thoughts. Nor
can we again very readily lose the impression ;
we carry it along with us into the world, and our
whole conduct and intercourse with it is tinged
with seriousness, not with the mere influence of
depressed spirits, not with the simple feeling of
our present loss, nor with the moroseness of the
solitary, but with serious cheerfulness, arising on
the one hand from a view of the importance of
affliction, and on the other, from reflection on
the consoling ray with which Christianity cheers
and illumines our prospects.
Affliction, when it is well sustained, affords
the means of improving every part of the Chris-
tian character. It is a disciphne which, by
ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 81
pruning redundancies, discovering and healing
diseases, and exciting and encouraging languid
actions and dormant principles, diffuses its in-
fluence over the heart, and consequently shows
itself in the life, in more correct and energetic
practice, more diligence, more of the Christian
spirit, and of resemblance to the Christian's
great and perfect Exemplar, more entire devot-
edness to the service of the Most High.
The great design of the Christian's life should
be to promote the glory of God, and extend the
limits of his kingdom. And yet how feeble his
exertions ! how cold and lifeless his endeavours,
how inadequate to the magnitude of the design
to be accomplished ! There is none who does
all that he might and ought to do in this great
cause : and how many are content to hide their
talent in a napkin, to sepulchrate their influ-
ence, and to attempt nothing towards the at-
tainment of an object so magnificent!
Affliction, by promoting a habit of self-inspec-
tion, produces a conviction of our unprofitable-
ness, leads us to set a greater value on religion,
and to venerate more highly its gracious Author
:
whilst, by teaching us the vanity and insuffi-
ciency of the joys and prospects of the present
life, it weans our hearts from the world, en-
feebles our attachment to its scenes, brings to
our views the crown of joy reserved in heaven
82 ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW.
for those who love and serve God ; and thus has
a direct tendency to elevate our thoughts above
the feelings and maxims of the day, and teaches
us to seek guidance and direction from the God
of all grace, with the humble desire of being
entirely devoted to his service.
In the exercise of this principle we are not
simply desirous of being employed actively in
the execution of his purposes : but if he pleases
to place us in obscurity, to thwart our schemes
of active duty, and to try the fixedness of our
trust in him, by requiring us to -surrender, not
only ourselves, but all our concerns, all we are,
and have, and think, and feel, and do, to his
will, we are prepared to yield submissively to his
disposal. There can be no such thing as reser-
vation here ; God will have the whole heart, and
will not endure its partition by a rival.
This devotedness of the heart to God is not
an occasional impulse, but a constant principle
of action ; it does not consist in any outward
sign, which may be assumed to-day, and laid
aside to-morrow ; it does not extend to one part
«f the conduct only, while the rest is tinctured
with the wild impulse of ungoverned passion
;
it does not show itself in some particular instan-
ces, while the general disposition of the mind is
averse to God ; but it produces consistency of
conduct and of feeling ; it implies and gives
©N THE ADVANTAGES OF SORROW. 83
such a degree of firmness and of fixedness to
the character, as to lead its aspirations more
habitually to heaven, to prepare the Christian
for every event, and to enable him to praise God,
and to walk continually with him.
If such be the advantages of sorrow, who
would not " choose rather to suffer aflliction
with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea-
sures of sin for a season ?"* Who would not
deliberately prefer suffering, with all its inestim-
able benefits, to a life of ease and security, and
present uncertain pleasure ? Inasmuch as eter-
nity is longer than time, the doctrines of Chris-
tianity are to be preferred to the maxims of the
world, and *'the sufferings of this present time,
which are but for a moment, work out for us
a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory ;"+ so is affliction to be preferred as the
means of preparing us for heaven, and exciting
us to love him in whose favour is life, and whose
service is perfect freedom. If we "endure pa-
tiently," we shall inherit the promise: forget-
ting this world and its allurements, we shall be
quickened in our progress towards heaven, and
stimulated to "lay up our treasures there, where
neither nK)th nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves
break through and steal."|
* Heb. li. 23. 1 2 Cor. ir. 17. % Matt. ri. 2().
84 ON THE ADVANTAGES OP SORROW.
How carefully should we pray and strive after
a proper improvement of sorrow, that this may
prove a source of consolation, and of joy un-
speakable and full of glory, in the anticipation
of being soon landed on the bhssful shores of
immortality ! Whilst, however, we reflect with
delight on the advantages to be derived from the
influence of affliction, we must not forget the
guilt we shall incur, if we despise this abundant
source of blessing—if we neglect its warnings,
and are heedless of the instruction it aflfords.
No benefit will accrue from suffering, if it be
Hot improved. Then, indeed, afliiction would be
unspeakably painful: we should suffer equally,
and, perhaps, more, without any title to the
consolations provided for those who mourn in
Zion, and at the same time we should incur the
just anger of God, in refusing to listen to his
voice, and to come to him, that "we might have
life." If the affliction under which we groan do
not detach us from the world—if it do not
weaken the influence of sin, and invigorate the
principle of piety in our hearts, we lose a bless-
ing "which is better than riches: and all the
things that may be desired are not to be com-
pared with it."*
* ProT. iii. J5.

CHAPTER V.
ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
If the influence of affliction be thus extensive,
and its advantages so important ; if our eternal
welfare be connected with its improvement ; and
if there be a danger of foregoing these advant-
ages, it is necessary to ascertain whether we are
reaping the instruction designed hy this mmrn-
fid event. To rest in uncertainty where the
interests of eternity are concerned is irrational
;
and at this season of solitude, the inquiry well
befits us, What are we the lietter for our sor-
rows?—A mistake on this subject may be of in-
finite consequence, and, therefore, the greatest
care and diligence should be observed in the
scrutiny,
If it be true, that the foundation of all useful
knowledge must be laid in an acquaintance with
ourselves ; and if it be granted, that we are in-
disposed to the fulfilment of this duty, because it
leads us to be dissatisfied with our actions; it
is the more necessary that we seriously prosecute
the inquiry as in the presence of Him who
. 8
86 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
searches the heart and tries the reins of the
children of men; and that we do not cease to
examine ourselves, while we entertain a doubt
of the integrity of our conduct.
He who is a God of love does not willingly
afflict his people : infinite wisdom and infinite
goodness influence his decisions, and his decrees
are executed with an especial regard to mercy.
Hence, there can be no question but that the
present scene of distress is commissioned to ac-
complish some ivise purpose; and perhaps, by a
little attention, it may not be diflicult to discover
the particular design. Yet, if this were not the
case, when we look into our hearts, and observe
so much evil constantly springing up ; when we
detect so much attachment to the world, and
alienation from God ; we cannot be at a loss to
perceive the necessity for some great change,
that we may bo made holy and acceptable in his
sight.
" Wherefore should a living man complain
—a man for the punishment of his sins ? Let
us search and try our ways, and turn again to
the Lord."* This is precisely the frame of mind
in which we should meet affliction. Conscious
of our sinfulness and manifold infirmities, that
we deserve to suflfer the wrath of God, and that
* Lam. iii. 39, 40.
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 87
it is of his infinite mercy we are yet the hving
to seek him, we should not venture to approach
him with complaints ; we should be humbled
under the mighty hand of God, and be stimulated
to inquire, whether ice have chosen the Lord as
our God ; and if so, wherein we have deviated
from his ways, that we may turn unto him with
the whole heart.
" Show me wherefore thou contendest with
me,"* should be the language of our minds.
We may not rest contented with a general ac-
knowledgment of our sinfulness, nor be satisfied
with a cold and languid confession of our hard-
ness of heart, and of our proneness to wander
from God. This, alas! is too frequently the
mind's subterfuge, to escape that piercing scru-
tiny which will reveal what is wished to be for-
gotten : it is an attempt to lose in generalization
the peculiar features of the present trial.
God afilicts his children only when chastise-
ment is most required ; and hence we may often
discover in the nature of the trial an indication
of its design, and of the evil to ivhich it is opposed.
Self-examination, in proportion as it brings us
acquainted with our own hearts, leads us to
entertain higher thoughts and juster conceptions
of the majesty, power, and goodness of God.
* Job X. 2.
Ob ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
We can no longer allow the intrusion of doubt
respecting his wisdom, mercy, or love, because
we find so much that is averse from him, and
hateful in his sight. We can enumerate so many
provocations against his glorious majesty, so
many offences against his patience and forbear-
ance, and such a distance from the standard of
purity he has exhibited for our imitation, that
we are constrained to acknowledge the justice
of his displeasure, his wisdom in correcting us,
that he may recall our wandering footsteps to
liis v/ays, and supply us with the consolations of
his grace.
We are placed in the world, in a situation of
trial and of danger, in the midst of our fellow-
creatures, in the relation of social beings ; and
we have all some part or other to perform on
this wide theatre. Since we are naturally at-
tracted by the present scenes, and necessarily
and lawfully engaged in our several stations, it
is useful to examine, whether we have estimated
the world and its possessions in a proper light,
or whether, on the contrary, these have not
occupied too much of our time, and pre-engaged
our thoughts.
We are commanded to be "active in business,"
but at the same time fervent in spirit ; and it is
obvious that a degree of diligence in the former,
which interferes with the right performance of
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 89
religious duties, and infringes on the time allotted
for the peculiar service of God, or which renders
us unfit for the exercise of that worship which
should be our delight, must be proscribed. Ex-
cessive anxiety about the cares and pursuits of
this life, is an insurmountable barrier to the
maintenance of vital rehgion in the heart.
Worldly solicitude slowly preys upon the spirits,
and, by depressing the powers of the mind,
prevents its looking up to God, and deriving its
happiness from his service. It securely takes
its root in the very basis of the heart : there it
vegetates and sends forth its shoots : these grow
and entwine themselves around its surface, till
at length they meet and inosculate, and thus
repress its few and feeble efforts to send one
lingering wish on high.
This effect w^ill be produced, when present
anxiety is suffered to oppress the mind and
obscure its perceptions ; when the soul no longer
feels the delight which it once experienced in
contemplating the wonders of God's providence,
and tracing his gracious and affectionate hand
in all the acts of his goodness, and is incapable
of appreciating the value of his preserving and
sustaining mercy. When the mind ceases to
contemplate these interesting scenes with plea-
sure, and is absorbed with worldly projects and
desires, then it is that, no longer directed te
8*
mi ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
their proper object, the affections wander from
God : they diverge from their native centre, and
they fall irregularly on some inferior object ; in-
asmuch as any thing short of the goodness and
the majesty of heaven is undeserving supreme re-
gard. The views are no longer directed towards
the skies ; but, on the contrary, the distant
glimpses which are caught at intervals of a
world to come, are illuminated only by the feeble,
glimmering, and uncertain light of reason ; the
desires are faint and languid ; the heart no longer
beats responsive to the stimulus it should receive
from contemplating the love of God ; while all its
powers, and energies, and activity, are concen-
trated on some present good of little real value.
Perhaps, too, we may be pufsuing, an unlawful
object : not only one which absorbs our thoughts
and affections, but which engages them in direct
hostility to the commands of God. We are
heaping up riches, and may be little scrupulous
about the means of obtaining them, while God
says, *'
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth, Vvhere moth and rust doth corrupt, and
where thieves break through and steal : but lay
up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where
neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves
break through and steal."* While he commands
" Matt. vi. 19. 20.
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 9h
US to " seek first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness,"* we lose sight of those grand
objects, and pursue the attainment of present
good—riches, honour, or reputation.
This injurious influence exerted upon the heart,
is visible in the life. We have no longer Chris-
tianity in its lovely, active form. There is,
indeed, a name to live, but there is no vitality.
The character, the hopes, the joys, the principles,
and the prospects of the aspirant of heaven, are
merged in the undefined and cloudy views of
the man of the world. The present world is his
element : in it he lives, and breathes, and acts ;
but take him from his busy scenes to his chamber,
how cold his heart ; how feeble, formal, and un-
felt are his addresses to the God of grace ; how
diminutive his exertions in the cause of religion,
when contrasted with his general activity ! His
conduct is influenced not by the pure standard
of divine truth, but by worldly maxims and
motives of expediency and pohcy, while it ceases
to be characterized by that genuineness of prin-
ciple which distinguishes the activity of the
humble follower of Jesus.
This state of mind is hateful to God, who
wills that his creatures should live as candidates
for a future, better world, and should show forth
* Matt. vj. 33.
92 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
his glory on earth. And yet, so insidious is its
attack, so measured and cautious are its ap-
proaches, that the mind may be wholly pre-
occupied with the world, before we are sensible
of having lost our first love. Can there be a
question, then, of the necessity of self-examina-
tion, that \ve may ascertain whether we have
declined from the ways of God, and have turned
aside to other paths? If this be our case, it
becomes us to balance the pleasures and pursuits
of this life with the favour of heaven, and ask
whether the former are deliberately to be pre-
ferred? In a season of affliction, we shall as-
suredly answer in the negative ; and thus shall
we learn the relative value of present and eternal
considerations; we shall discover our own un-
happy choice ; we shall repent, remember whence
we are fallen, and, in the strength of divine
grace, we shall do " the first works."
But, again, are our attachments fixed on
things above, or upon things on the earth ? Man
is a rational being ; but he is so situated in this
world, that the great basis of his happiness is
made to consist in the exercise of the social
affections. The Almighty has beneficently im-
planted in his breast a desire to promote the
happiness of those who are dear to him, and
has imparted to this principle such a degree of
influence over his conduct, that it gives a peculiar'
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. . 93
character to his actions. As the mind expands,
the benevolent sympathies are evolved ; during
a state of infancy their influence is circumscribed
;
but soon the exercise of filial, strengthened by
fraternal love, is expanded into the fulness of
that benevolence which stamps the mind with
peculiar beauty and excellence. Allowed, how-
ever, to range through the wide field of know-
ledge and of society, there are some objects,
which, by possessing a greater number of affini-
ties with his character, will necessarily attract
and engage the attention more than others, and
finally enlist the heart in the choice. Hence the
origin of friendship and love, and of that delight
which arises from the communion of kindred
souls, in pursuit of the same great objects, and
guided by the same immutable principles.
While the affections, when rightly directed,
may lead us to greater activity in the service of
morality and religion ; so it must be confessed,
that they have a natural tendency to pre-occupy
the heart, and abstract its allegiance from God.
Though just and pure in themselves, yet, by
aiming no higher than their immediate object,
they become so concentrated upon it, as to be
very little capable of more extensive and exalted
action, and often prove the means of alienating
the heart from the pursuit of virtue. But God
is a jealous God ; and as the supreme good, he
94 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
requires our hearts to be placed on him, and is
angry when they are directed from him. He
will not tolerate a rival in our bosoms, and if
we inordinately love the creature, we put this
object in the room of the Creator; we substitute
an idol for the true God, and worship with our
hearts a poor imperfect creature, whose every
excellence is derived from the infinitely just and
holy God.
As God demands the heart, and is provoked
when it is bestowed upon another, so he is
sometimes induced to remove from our sight
the endeared object which has thus proved the
occasion of weaning us from himself, instead of
exciting our gratitude towards him. Has this
been the case with us ? Has not the beloved
object of our fond solicitude proved the occasion
of dividing our hearts, and abstracting our
thoughts and affections from pursuits of infinite
and supreme importance ? Have we not rested
in the pleasantness and excellence of the gift,
while we have forgotten from whom it was
derived f Have we not been overwhelmed with
anxiety for its welfare f Have we not made the
enjoyment of its society our home—our refuge ?
When care and sorrow have invaded our bosoms,
have we not sought the oblivion of our grief in
the delightful intercourse of chastened affection ?
yea, has not our happiness consisted in this,
ON SELF-EXAML\ATIOi\. 95
while we have forgotten to choose God as our
portion, to seek his guidance, and come to him
as our only substantial good ? The continuance
of present scenes has been all our desire; we
have felt as if nothing could blast our happiness
or destroy our pleasures. Yet God has shown
us that we are in his hands ; he has smitten our
pleasant flower, and dissipated all our fairy
scenes of present peace.
And has not his conduct in this instance been
marked by merciful loving-kindness ? He is
teaching us that no lasting happiness is to be
found on earth, and that heaven alone is our
home. He perceives that we are satisfied with
our present comforts, and wisely directs the
removal of these intervening objects, in order
that we may practically, learn the transitory,
fleeting nature of terrestrial joys, and be con-
strained to place our hopes above. Earnestly
then should we strive to reap the benefit of the
lesson thus painfully inculcated.
In the present dark and clouded season, every
object will assume an appearance differing from
its late fascinating hue. A tender father is
manifesting the insufficiency of this world to
satisfy the desires of an immortal mind ! You
expand your heart, and place your aff'ections
on the creature of a day ; but in an unexpected
moment, death snatches away your dearest
06 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
friend, and you are convinced of the futility of
expecting abiding felicity from any object so
uncertain in its continuance. While you enjoyed
its presence, you wished for nothing more ; but
you now find a void, which no recollection of
past happiness can fill ; and you are driven to
seek from some other source the solid peace
you have lost. Thus, while you learn the inca-
pacity of the creature to make you substantially
happy, you are instructed in the all-sufficiency
of a Saviour ; for, even under these distressing
circumstances, he is present with you ; he puts
underneath you his everlasting arms ; he oflfers
himself to your acceptance as a God of mercy
and love ; and he invites you to put your whole
trust in him. Exquisitely dear to the heart as
is the recollection of past scenes of love, yet they
will now appear as mispent hours, because they
have induced you to neglect the Lord your God ;
and the more poignant your grief, the greater
will be your desire to five in future to his glory.
There is no dividing the heart between God
and his gifts; you cannot at the same time love
both the one and the other supremely. The
human heart is so formed^ or perhaps charac-
terized by its fallen state, that it would aim to
share its powers between God and the creature
;
but it is impossible. If the latter be loved equally^
it will be loved superlatively. The only chance
OIV SELF-EXAMINATION. 97
of safety is when love to the creature is enter-
tained in direct subservience to the will of God.
If, then, by this self-inspection, we learn the
inordinate wanderings of present affection, we
shall be desirous of transferring all the love
which we once sinfully placed on our lost relative
to the Saviour, who is the fountain of all good-
ness ; we shall be desirous of seeking him, as
the supreme object of our delight, and shall
earnestly pray for the assistance of his Spirit, to
enable us to choose him as our chief good, and
our all-sufficient portion.
This is not a place of rest. Hitherto, we
have derived our happiness from terrestrial com-
forts ; we have calculated on their continuance,
and we have wished no change : we have fondly
imagined that the late happy scenes would not
be dissipated till a period most remote, and we
have been contented to seek no other home.
The integral beauties of the domestic, small, but
perfect circle, have been our paradise of earthly
bhss. Here we have enjoyed all that heart
could wish, or a fond imagination realize, when
depicting its fairy prospects of felicity; and we
have forgotten that this is but the journey to an
eternal world, or that we are travellers to a
heavenly state. We have slumbered on the lar
of ease, and our life has been but as a dream
perfect pleasure ; we are now awakened t
9 /
98 UN SELF-EXAML\ATIOxN.
consciousness of our delusion ; and while wc
regret the visionary fabric that has passed away,
we are forcibly reminded of its original instability
and emptiness : we estimate these only as they
deserve, we find mutability stamped on every
thing human, and our only hope of tranquillity
is derived from seeking an acquaintance with
that everlasting blessedness of the righteous,
which we should be preparing to enjoy. When
we look at the Christian, and recollect that it
should be his delight to be conformed to the
image of his Redeemer ; when we remember,
that in this world the Son of Man had not where
to lay his head, that he was despised and rejected
of men, and forsaken even by his disciples in
the hour of peril ; surely we should be ashamed
of assuming this for our resting-place, when we
should be striving to inherit his kingdom, and to
be with him where he is, there to behold his glory
!
Again ; the great God, who first breathed into
man the spirit of life, who endowed him with
rational faculties, and gave him an immortal
soul, has conferred upon each one of his crea-
tures some varied and peculiar talents, which,
in their different measures, all are directed to
improve, and exercise in his service, and to his
honour : the greater, therefore, our talents, the
greater will be the sin of perverting or neglect-
ing them.
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 99
If we possess talents, and are indifferent to
iheir cultivation and employment, we are un-
profitable servants ; and if we pervert them by
lending their influence to the cause of sin and
error, we are doubly criminal ; for it is hardly
possible to calculate the extent of the injury thus
inflicted on the interests of truth. There is a
serious responsibility attached to the exercise of
talent ; and since its eflfects are so extensive and
remote, and its perverted influences© destructive,
it behooves us to inquire, if we are free from the
charge of negligence or inattention. Perhaps
our ability may be small ;
yet each in his appro-
priate sphere possesses an important power of
good or evil. If this influence be duly exerted,
its exercise will be guided by a prevailing desire
to extend the knowledge of God, and promote
the glory of his kingdom. It will be contemplated
as a sacred deposit, which we should diligently
employ in accomplishing this great end, in so
far as our ability may extend. To advance the
interests of morality and civil order will surely
never be forgotten, though it may be esteemed
as a secondary object, and arising out of the
former.
Where genuine religion is implanted in the
heart, morality follows necessarily as its fruit
;
and hence our great concern will be to promote
its best interests in the world. Yet the present
100 ON SELF-EXAMINATIOX.
comforts of mankind at large will not be over-
looked. Benevolence opens a wide sphere for
action ; and though we may regret the limited
means with which we are endowed, yet we shall
be constantly devising new plans of usefulness,
and seeking new evils to be remedied, new
sorrows to be alleviated, and new blessings to
be conferred. Real charity does not derive a
motive to inactivity, from the contemplation of
what has been effected through its influence
;
hut every renewed exercise of the principle gives
it additional energy, and a consequent increased
power of action, while it gradually, but invari-
ably, forms the mind to habits of benevolence.
It will never rest satisfied with the exertions of
yesterday, while the activity of to-day can, by
the remotest possibility, contribute to the happi-
ness or welfare of one other object.
The glory of God, the advancement of his
kingdom, and the good of mankind in its largest
acceptation, will be the points towards which
the exercise of talent should converge. And
the motive should be disinterested. The love of
applause, or the desire of power, must be dis-
allowed and combated, as principles of action
;
while the love of Christ should constrain and
animate us with affection to his people, and
furnish abundant incentives to activity. We
dften do right; we exert our talents to tbe
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 101
Utmost, in a good, nay, in the very best of causes,
but perhaps from unworthy motives. If we do
not hope to obtain the love and esteem of the
world, yet the influence we fondly anticipate
over our little social circle, is often too attractive
to be resisted. In this scrutiny of the heart we
cannot be too rigid ; for it is the motive which
characterizes the act, and not the act itself, the
source from which it springs. This indeed may
appear pure to others, and yet may be the most
contaminated. We must investigate the motive
and the aim of our conduct ; and if, in the
exercise of talents intrusted to us, conscience
will approve both the former and the latter ; if
we are satisfied that there is no abuse of the
influence we have exerted ; we have still to ask,
whether we have done so much as we ought,
whether we have done so much as we could,
and have been as diligent and active as our
situation has demanded. It will be well indeed
for us, if we have not to lament the improper
use of our capacity to do good ; but we can
hardly expect to be able justly to acquit ourselves
of neglect, of inattention to opportunities of
exertion, and of the Avant of purity in our
motives. Aflliction detects the lurking#evil, and
discovers abundant cause for the judgments of
God inflicted on us.
This afilictive providence leads us still further
102 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
to inquire into our habitual preparedness for
death, and the solemn realities it will disclose.
Mankind in general look around them ; and in
the circle of their-acquaintance, many, one after
another, are taken away : the rich and the poor,
the young and the old, the just and the unjust,
are alike the subjects of mortality. Those with
whom we have associated to-day, are no more
seen in their accustomed situations : others suc-
ceed them : and perhaps even this generation
passes away, and yet man is unmindful of his
approaching end. Among those who survive,
the ravages of disease are evident, and we see
some maintaining a lingering existence, whom
we certainly calculate on soon consigning to the
tomb. Yet we forget that we must follow them.
We are unwilling to live in the constant recol-
lection of the uncertainty and brevity of human
life, and we are naturally inclined to postpone
the certain approach of death to a very distant,
and yet more distant day.
*'
Man that is born of a woman is of few days,
and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a

deed, is aptly compared to a flower : it flourishes

advances to maturity, promises to disperse its
fragrance and its charms to a widely extended
circle. We gaze and admire, as it expands its
freshening beauties, and we fervently pray that
nothing may impair its vigour or arrest its
growth. But we are soon painfully taught the
rapidity of its progress. For, while our hearts
kindle into contemplation on the coming pros-
pects and anticipated pleasures which promise
to attend its full-blown sweetness, it has passed
at once to a state of decay. A few days only
are allotted for the completion of this process
;
and it is uncertain whether even these few days
may be accomplished. For a nipping frost has
chilled its powers ; the pelting of the untimely
wintry storm has stripped it of its vitality and
beauty ; or the destructive worm has slowly but
effectually preyed upon its roots, destroyed its
healthy active hue, substituted the wan character
of disease, and now it " fieeth as a shadow, and
continueth not."
Human life is indeed promising at its outset,
but it is rapid in its progress, and uncertain in
its duration. Yet, in entire forgetfulness of the
testimony of the Sacred Writings, the evidence
of our observation, and the undisputed fact, that
a very large majority of mankind die in the
most promising period of human existence, in
childhood and youth, we cannot be practically
104 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
convinced of our own mortality. But death has
now invaded our own immediate circle, it has
removed from our sight one in whom we de-
lighted, and on the protraction of whose days
we securely calculated, and even fondly built
the realization of all our future scenes of happi-
ness ; we have lost the friend, without whom the
domestic circle will be incomplete ; and this event
has occurred in a most unexpected moment.
Surely, then, it becomes us to obtain a deep
conviction of the uncertainty of life, practically
to entertain the idea of our own approaching
mortality, to put the question, " Am I also
ready ?" and to seek after a constant preparation
for this great change.
Yes ; we are mortal ! nor can we possibly post-
pone the appointed hour of dissolution. Sooner
or later, and we know not how soon, we shall
be called to leave this world for another. A few
days, perhaps only a few hours since, our dear
friend was in perfect health, cheering and cheer-
ed by our mutual intercourse ; and though fully
prepared for this awful, sudden change, little
dreamed that the messenger of separation was
so near at hand. Instead of his removal, the
summons might have been made to the survivor
;
and are you equally ready to meet your God ?
No man knows the time or the manner of his
death; it is a wise provision, that we remain
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 105
ignorant of its approach ; but, since it may come
as a thief in the night, and as the sick-bed is
not the place for repentance, when the mind is
clouded by disease, and its perceptions too fre-
quently distorted ; if we would wish to die in
peace, and in the assured hope of a happy
resurrection, we should have our prospects for
eternity clear and well defined during a state of
health ; we should be watchin<? for the coming
of the Lord, and be prepared to yield ourselves
into the arms of the Redeemer of sinners :
—
thus to die is infinite gain.
Should death be the only circumstance we do
not anticipate, the only journey for which we
are careless of our safety and comfort, the only
important vicissitudes which claims no regard?
Surely this is not the part of prudence. May
we be no longer unmindful of its approach, but
earnestly inquire, if our lights are burning and
our lamps trimmed; and if not, may we diligently
prepare them, and stand having our "loins girt
about with truth, and having on the breast-plate
of righteousness ; and our feet shod with the
preparation of the Gospel of peace ; above all,
taking the shield of faith, wherewith we shall be
able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword
of the Spirit, which is the word of God : praying

Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perse-
verance and supphcation for all saints."*
Christianity is a vital animating principle, and
it is highly important for us to know whether its
influence is really extended over our hearts and
lives, or whether we merely profess a belief in
its truth, while our temper, our feelings, and
our conduct remain unaffected by its influence.
The external profession of religion in the
present day is very common ; I had almost said,
it has become fashionable ; at all events, it is
not now that strange thing which once sub-
jected its friends to reproach and persecution.
It would indeed be uncharitable and unjust to
deny the rapid increase of vital religion ; but at
the same time, as the stream has widened it has
become shallower : and as difficulties have been
removed, so has arisen the temptation to choose
its flowery banks, from custom and habit, early
prejudice, or perhaps interested motives. These,
and a thousand causes such as these, may induce
us to take up our lot with the disciples of Christ,
while it is yet evident that we have no title to
true religion. Our attendance upon the worship
of God, reverence for the Sabbath, activity in
promoting the progress of religious truth, and
chooging other professors as our companions and
" Eph, vi. 14—18.
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 107
friends, do not prove that we arc sincerely de-
sirous of being taught of God, and influenced
by his Spirit to purity of action. Yet on these
grounds we may be seeking repose, and lulling
our consciences into security, while we should be
tremblingly alive to the dangers of our situation.
The peaceful but lifeless professor is in greater
danger than the avowed profligate, since the
avenues of his heart are closed to the importu-
nities of divine truth.
But if it be thus easy to mistake on the
ground of a sincere reception of Christianity, it
is even more so to impose on the heart, by the
external propriety of our conduct. We may
rest for safety on the purity of our lives, on our
charity and good works : or we may err equally
on the opposite side of the question; for, as
faith without works is dead, so good works, if
they do not proceed from correct motives, are
the body without the soul; they want the vital
principle which stamps them with value.
Simple morality does not, cannot comprehend
the wliole scheme of Christianity. It can eflfect
much in ameliorating the temper and correcting
the life; but it can never change the heart; it
can never induce holy principles, nor originate
good actions^ springing from pure motives, and
having a direct tendency to raise the thoughts
to heaven, or the affections to God. Afflictioa
108 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
unmasks these errors: for it finds us destitute
of the consolations of religion, a principle which,
having never vegetated in our bosoms, cannot
therefore produce its fruits: if we attempt to
look back on our past lives, we find so much
evil, that we cannot derive comfort from the
retrospect ; and even if we could, this would fail
of imparting peace under circumstances so dis-
tressing.
Perhaps we have no concern about religion,
and are looking to the world, to philosophy, and
a thousand false hopes, for consolation in the
hour of trial. Diligent self-inspection will dis-
cover our error, show us that we are seeking
comfort where none is to be found, point to the
only real source of happiness, and induce a con-
viction of our own helplessness, and of the suit-
ableness of a Saviour's grace to supply our
wants, to lead us from darkness to light, and
from self-reliance to Jesus, the Mediator of the
new covenant, and finally bring us to inherit a
crown of glory which fadeth not away.
The Christian will be anxious to inquire if he
has embraced the whole of Christianity, and if
its principles produce their legitimate influence
on his heart and life. When he is chastened,
he will suspect some secret evil, and desire to
be brought acquainted with it, and enabled to
resist it in the strength of divine grace. His
\3N SELF-EXAMINATION. 109
principles are put to the test. Do they now
•afford him consolation and support? Do they
enable him to be meek, patient, and submissive,
and lead him to dependence upon God? It is
highly important that his views should be well
defined, his hopes brightened by truth, his pros-
pects fixed on eternity, and all his principles
extracted simply from the Bible. This must be
his last appeal, his counsellor, his best and con-
stant friend.
Christianity is not a revelation from which
we may cull, for our reception and obedience,
such parts as are most congenial to our feelings :
but the whole truth must be received from the
heart, as a perfect rule of life, and unerring
guide through every difficulty, and the immuta-
ble standard of opinion and action. We can-
not retain one of its doctrines, while we reject
the rest : we cannot yield obedience to some of
its precepts, while we are habitually negligent
of others. We may not forget the self-denial it
enjoins, nor the rigid activity in the service of
God which it requires, while we receive the se-
curity it offers, both now and hereafter, to those
who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. We may
not lose sight of the good works it enforces,
while we rest our faith on the promises it con-
tains. We may not separate the practice from
the principle, nor the principle from the practice.
10
110 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
We must be careful that the principles wo
have imbibed are drawn from this pure source
;
and that they are unadulterated by any modifi-
cation of human invention. These principles
must be examined, and their efficacy must be
proved. Whilst the Christian is led to God, in
the exercise of humble prayer, by the contem-
plation of his own sinfulness, and the suffering
he endures, he will yet wait with patience, as-
sured that, in his own good time, God will work
deliverance ; or, if this be impossible, that he
will grant what is infinitely more valuable, the
sanctification of the affliction. We must not
be weary in waiting upon God. Though he
does not answer our petitions immediately; or
though, in infinite wisdom, he does not see fit to
grant the requests of short-sighted mortality;
yet he may bless us in some other way of
far greater importance. If we are purified,
and sublimed, and prepared for heaven, are we
not abundantly benefited ?
This consideration will induce the mourner
to remember his past sufferings, and to inquire
what good lie has derived from those afflictive
events which are now past, and from that under
which he at present labours. Have trials, com-
missioned by the long-suffering mercy of a com-
passionate God, produced their proper effect in
making him more holy and heavenly-minded.
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. Ill
more afraid of sin, and more desirous of living
to his glory ? Perhaps he can look back on past
scenes of sorrow with bitter recollection, on
hours of suffering misimproved, and talents per-
verted. Perhaps he will lament the little fruit-
fulness which has sprung from this beneficent
culture ; and to his present sorrow^ will be added
the ao^o^ravation of havinof trifled with the Most
High; of having suffered, yet without advant-
age. If this be the case, he will be doubly
anxious to reap the benefit of present affliction
;
and he will obtain a fresh and powerful motive
to self-inspection. He will be assured that the
Lord doth all things well, and will be concerned
that he still needs this discipline to wean him
from the earth, and fix his attachments on
heaven; he will regret that he has made so little
progress towards the celestial kingdom ; and he
will be desirous of having his pace quickened,
and of acquiring a new, and powerful, and last-
ing stimulus to diligence and exertion.
But there are dangers and errors attending
even this process of self-examination, which it
will be right to keep in view, or we may arrive
at false conclusions ; and with all our scrutiny,
and all our sorrow, derive no advantage from
either.
So great a flatterer of its thoughts and actions
i's the human heart, that there is no inconsiderable

danger lest we be induced, with specious self-
complacency, to proclaim to ourselves, " Peace,
peace, where there is no peace."* The principle
of self-love is, of all others, the most intimately
interwoven with our nature ; it is almost the
first stimulus to action, and it lends its charac-
teristic influence to the whole of our conduct.
Under one or other of its ever-varying forms it
is perpetually exhibited in our lives, and affords
its peculiar bias to our opinions, while it confirms
the habits and strengthens the prejudices we
have entertained, and thus presents an obstacle
to the discovery of truth, lest we become ac-
quainted with the unwelcome fact, that hitherto
we have been in error. Its immediate influence
is to reconcile u^ to ourselves, and to make us
well pleased with what we are, rather than with
what we ought to be.
The discovery of the unbounded influence of
this principle will humble us, will assist in pre-
serving us from error, and, by laying open to
our view the secret wickedness of the miad, will
prove that *'
the heart is deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked ;"t that it "is
prone to evil, and that continually ;" and that
nothing short of divine power can eflfect a change.
This will induce us to look from ourselves to
* Jer. vi. 14.- tJer. xvii. 9.
ON SELF-EXAMINATION. 113
the Author of all good for wisdom and strength;
and while we would desire to maintain a constant
warfare with evil, we shall still be expecting
support from him ; since it is only in his strength
that we can obtain a victory. It is by his grace
we shall escape the delusions of sin and error
;
and it is only by his power we can be preserved
from falling.
In this trial we shall need a standard of
purity, that we may compare the actual state of
our bosoms with the principles, the feelings,
and the actions which should constitute the
Christian character. But this standard must
not be of our own selection, or we should accom-
modate the test to our peculiar views : we are
too apt at all times to frame systems, and to
make facts and opinions subservient to their
support ; and when so materially interested, it
would not be surprising if we adopted a mode
of comparison so congenial with our prejudices.
Neither must we adopt a standard of purity
which the world has selected ; since this will be
ever varying according to the deepening shades
of error which encompass the votaries of fashion*
and, at the bidding of the thoughtless and the
gay, will be easily moulded by circumstances,
and will assume almost any shape and form,
and length and breadth, which convenience may
require.
10*
114 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
But moral rectitude is unchangeable and un-
accommodating. It is the same to-day as a
thousand years ago ; it is the same under every
circumstance ; nor can it sustain the smallest
alteration in its nature, without suffering a pro-
portionate loss. We look in vain for some un-
erring guide : we cannot find it in ourselves, nor
in the maxims of the world, nor in the subhme
ethics of philosophy. The only true standard
is the Holy Scripture, and it is by its precepts
we must investigate our hearts. Here we shall
find an estimate of purity the most sublime, a
tone of morality the most exalted, principles the
most refined, and precepts the most beneficent
and engaging. We shall not be lulled into
security by false opinions and distorted maxims
;
but the way of truth will be so plain, that we
cannot mistake ; so pure, that we cannot be
deceived. It is the motive which characterizes
the act ; a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good
fruit : and thus are we led to the source of the
evil, and to the only possibility of cure, in a new
heart and a right spirit, which are the gift of
God. We have no longer any excuse for wan-
dering in the dark ;
" a light" is provided '* for
our feet, and a lamp unto our paths." If we are
in a state of uncertainty, here we may be directed
into the way of all truth, the way which leads
to present peace and everlasting happir.css. To

this Standard alone we must accommodate our
views ; by this must we estimate our conduct
;
and if we are really desirous of ascertaining the
truth, there will be little danger of error.
A superficial glance, however, will not suffice.
We must not be contented to examine the ex-
terior profession only, nor be concerned to fix
the degree of estimation in which our character
is held by those with whom we are associated.
We may not please ourselves with the correctness
of our actions, and be contented to remain in
uncertainty with regard to the principles which
produce them : neither may we assume the rec-
titude of our motives, because we are induced to
be more attentive to the concerns of religion,
and are more fastidious in some parts of our
conduct, than are some of our neighbours : the
very evil we should detect, may still lurk under
a plausible garb of professed piety, and thus
readily elude our feeble search.
We are not called to examine ourselves as
we appear to others, when we know the eye of
the world is fixed upon us ; but as we really are
at home, in the secret retreats of life, in the
midst of our family, with our every-day tempers
and dispositions, exposed to unnumbered sources
of irritation, to trials, to sickness, and privations;
and, more than all, to the deceitfulness of the
heart
!
116 ON SELF-EXAMINATION.
Nor are we simply in danger of looking at a
few weeds on the surface, and of forgetting the
source from which they spring ; but we are like-
wise disposed to give only a partial inspection.
We possess, perhaps from nature, some quality
which we vainly imagine is superior ; we pride
ourselves on its exercise, we conceive that this
will hide a multitude of defects, and atone for
the errors and the follies of our daily life ; and
it is to this part of our conduct that we most
readily turn the inquiring eye, while we fondly
strive to forget all our faults in the complacent
satisfaction we derive from the conscious ex-
ercise of this one virtue. We must be divested
of partiality before we can be prepared to in-
vestigate our conduct ; and we must distinctly
remember that it is to the whole, and not to the
exercise of one insulated principle, that our
attention must be directed.
It will be generally found, that this is not a
pleasant duty, that it brings to our view so much
that affords matter for sorrow, as to divest us of
all our self-complacency. But if we are sinful
and estranged from God, this is the very effect
intended to be produced; and why should we
hesitate to employ the means f The end designed
by affliction is the sanctification of its subject.
And how can this be accomplished, but by the
discovery of error, by repentance and turning
Oi\ SELF-EXAMINATION. 117
to God, and by the exercise of faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ, as the only Mediator ? We cannot
mortify sin, unless we know and trace its exist-
ance and its power ; nor resist temptation, unless
we are acquainted with its influence. We cannot
grow in conformity with the image of Christ,
unless we seek diligently to destroy the reigning
power of mortal corruption; nor become ac-
quainted with the heart, unless we commune
with ourselves, and examine its inmost recesses.
We shall not justly appreciate the littleness of
the events of this life, and the magnitude and
importance of the concerns of eternity, until we
know our own hearts, their aversion from all
that is good, their tendency to evil, their attach-
ment to the earth and all its vanities, and their
entire unfitness for heaven.
We cannot indulge security, unless we are
satisfied of our advancement in the divine life
.
and how can we be satisfied with our puny attain-
ments^ when the great apostle of the Gentiles
declares that he acts not as though he had
already attained, either were already perfect,
but exclaims, " I follow after, if that I may ap-
prehend that for which also I am apprehended
of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself
to have apprehended : but this one thing I do,
forgetting those things which are behind, and
reachinof forth unto those things which are before,
118 OS SELF-EXAMINATION.
I press toward the mark for the prize of the
high calUng of God in Christ Jesus."* Let us
then be active and dihgent ; let us not be slothful,
but followers of them who, through faith and
patience, inherit the promises.
It is then our duty to examine ourselves with
sincerity, entreating the presence and assistance
of the Holy Spirit of Truth. For we are feeble,
guilty creatures ; we cannot think a good thought,
nor do a good action ; and it is only through
strengthening grace that we shall be able to
perform this duty aright. We must do our part
;
but God alone can bless our feeble efforts ; he
only can thoroughly know the heart and disclose
its secrets to us, can lead and guide us into the
way of truth, enable us to walk in the light of
his countenance, and teach us to profit by his
word and by his dispensations. With earnest
soHcitude, then, shall we adopt the prayer of the
Psalmist: "Search me, O God, and know my
heart : try me, and know my thoughts : and see
if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me
in the way everlasting,"! with the delightful
confidence that the prayer of faith will be heard
and answered.

CHAPTER VI.
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION.
Submission to the will of God under the afflic-
tive events with which he is pleased to visit his
children, is a lesson of the first importance, and
a paramount duty of the Christian mourner.
The sacrifice of a contrite, obedient spirit, is
well pleasing to God. The exercise of cheerful
resignation to his will is, perhaps, a duty the
most difi^icult to perform ; but it involves a prin-
ciple which, when it originates from a heart-felt
conviction of the power and wisdom of Jehovah,
regulated and characterized by his mercy and
love, from a persuasion of his right to do with
us as seemeth good in his sight, and of his in-
flexible justice and matchless purity ; when it is
strengthened by the recollection of His faithful-
ness, who has promised that all things shall work
together for the eventual good of those who love,
and serve, and fear him ; when it is founded on
the propriety of our obedience to Him whose we
are; and when it is sanctioned by an abiding
sense of our own sinfulness and exposure to the
120 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION.
wrath of God, with just views of the great good
to be accomplished in us, is at once the most
dehghtful and the highest attainment of the
Christian temper on earth.
However plausible and easy this may appear
to be in theory, however much it may seem to
be the natural result of the Christian character,
it is quite certain, that to feel the chastening
hand of God, and at the same time to exercise
a cheerful acquiescence in the divine appoint-
ment, is so contrary to human nature, that it is
extremely difficult to bear suffering with that
meekness, humility, patience, submission, and
sorrow for sin, which are included in this grace.
Hence the necessity of becoming familiar with
the duty, and striving most earnestly not only
to know, but to feel and practise it.
Resignation presupposes a decided preference
of doing what God commands, and undergoing
what he inflicts, to the enjoyment of our own
pleasures and desires. Before the human mind
can cheerfully bear its inclinations to be thwarted,
and its affections nipped in their kindliest growth,
it must be deeply imbued with the righteousness
of Jehovah's character and government, and
with the infinite value of the soul : it must have
been taught the vanity of seeking happiness in
the creature, and the superior nature of religious
joys. Naturally self-willed, attached to the pre-
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 121
sent scenes, and desirous of gratifying those
affections and feelings which own a depraved
heart for their source, and present objects for
their centre, it is not easy to give up our own
will thus entirely, and requires not only our
renewal by the Holy Spirit, but likewise the
exercise of a constant reliance on Him who
demands these sacrifices only for our good.
Resignation implies a distrust of our own
understanding, and a cheerful confidence in the
wisdom of God. The mind fondly clings to the
imperfect views of mortality, and with the scanty
knowledge of a day, often vainly imagines that
it could remedy evils and alleviate suflferings
which we now see and feel to be prevalent and
inevitable. But the pride of inteKect must be
abandoned; we must become as little children
before we can suflfer the will of God with placid
submission. We must cease to speculate on
the causes and consequences of our sufi'ering,
and to scrutinize inquisitively the reasons of the
divine appointment ; we must believe that it is
right, because he does it; and rely with confi-
dence on his gracious promise, that " what we
know not now, we shall know hereafter." God
has promised to reveal to us his designs in a
future life, and to enable us to perceive the end
of that afiliction which sovereign mercy has
commissioned to detach us from the world.
11
122 ON THE DUTY OF REStCNATlON.
This duty pre-siipposes ahelief of the goodness
of God. We must possess exalted views of a
Saviour's character, before we can trust our all
in his hands. Could we entertain a doubt of
his infinite holiness, believe the possibility of his
imkindness, or indulge the thought that all his
dispensations are not the result of his compassion,
we could not commit ourselves to his care and
guidance. But God is love: he has revealed
himself under the most endearing characters
;
he has exhibited his mercy, in that he has re-
conciled us to himself through the blood of a
dying Redeemer ; and will he not likewise give
us inferior blessings .? He is infinitely good ; he
does not willingly afflict his children, but chastens
them for their profit ; and, assured that all our
trials proceed from this pure source, we cheer-
fully resign ourselves to his disposal.
Our heavenly Father has promised to support
us, and informs us that he has commissioned
trials to bring about our sanctification. And if
we contemplate the character of God, the equity
of his government, the appointments of his pro-
vidence, and his dealings with ourselves, we shall
have reason to believe that He is faithful icho
lias promised, and that he is able to keep that
which we have committed to his care.
The duty of resignation comprehends farther,
an unfeigned dedication of ourselves to the Lord
OK THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 123
of heaven and earth. We must have chosen
him for our God, because he has made us his
children ; and have determined to know nothing
among men save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
We must have been convinced of our dependence
on him, and have resolved with all our hearts
and minds to live to his glory, before we can
cheerfully seek to know and to do his will exclu-
sively. Then shall we not be moved by any of
these light afflictions, but shall consider simply
the hand of God, acknowledge that not the
minutest circumstance escapes his observation,
and be earnestly desirous of doing what he re-
quires, under every changing scene.
From this slight sketch, it is evident that the
perfect exercise of this principle is no ordinary
attainment ; but it is not a trifling good we have
placed before us as the prize. The active in-
fluence of this grace difl'uses so much peace and
serenity over the mind, aflbrds such solid ground
of consolation, and gives so well founded a hope
of our eternal interest in the Saviour's righte-
ousness, that it is indeed worthy our pursuit
;
for success will prove a source of unspeakable
blessing, and we shall praise the hand that has
afflicted us.
The possession of this virtue in its active in-
fluence, as it weans from earth and leads us to
place our aflections on heavenly objects, is id-
124 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATIOA.
finitely more necessary to our peace than any
comfort w© may have lost. An all-wise Jehovah
has taken from us a beloved object—the source
of much present pleasure ; but it is his design to
bring us to love Iiim more—to mature us for
the enjoyment of richer blessings in a world of
unfading bliss, and to make us more like unto
Him who was a man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief.
We are in the frequent habit of repeating
that beautiful and concise petition, " Thy will be
done ;" yet we too often overlook the extensive
duties it embraces, and the boundless submission
which it promises. It is reasonable that God
should try the patience of his children, and teach
them obedience to his will. Hence, there are
the best of reasons for their afflictions, without
which they would be destitute of these graces,
which can only be exemplified when their wills
are opposed. The Christian character can be
perfected only by the exercise of these principles
;
and hence we pray daily, that God would try us,
and purify us, and, consequently, would oppose
our inclinations and desires ; in truth, that he
would afilict us.
This prayer includes a profession of our readi-
ness to suffer for Christ's sake. When, there-
fore, death removes *'
the desire of his eyes with
a stroke," the Christian still will bless God
—

will praise him for that grace which enables
him to support his trials—will look to Jesus as
to the kind shepherd who will not suffer him to
want—will receive all his appointments with a
placid and grateful heart, and seek to be more
and more closely united to him. We pray that
the work of patience may be wrought and per-
fected in us, and we leave the care of accom-
plishing this great end to Him who best knows
our hearts, and can well appreciate its necessity.
It is possible that, in effect, we entreat that
some of our favourite schemes may be thwarted,
our loveliest prospects shrouded, and our greatest
earthly blessings removed from us ; and yet, in
the anticipation of all these circumstances, we
promise a cheerful acquiescence in the divine
will. It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth
him good, is the temper in which the greatest
afflictions should be encountered. We may, in-
deed, pray for their removal, with submission to
the appointment of Heaven ; but we must con-
clude our petition in the words of our Saviour:
••
Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done."
The best safeguard of our peace, and the most
appropriate expression of our afiectioiiiite de-
pendence on the divine power, will be to exercise
contentment with our lot however adverse, and
to suppress the secret murmnrings of that heart
which is by nature prone to rebellion against
II*
126 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION:.
God. It will not be sufficient that we avoid
accusing of injustice the Supreme Being, or
uttering our displeasure by insinuations against
the goodness and purity of his character ; that
we avoid accusing him of unkindness or partiality
in the distribution of his favours; or that wc
profess our submission to his appointments, our
obedience to his will, and our attachment to his
government and his cause : but the secret dis-
content of the heart must be sought out and
combated, a feeling which, though frequently
unexpressed, occupies and estranges the mind,
and fills it with unjust and injurious thoughts of
our heavenly Father.
Do we, then, now entertain exalted ideas of
Jehovah's character, and of the equity of his
dealings with us? Can we deliberately pro-
nounce his work to be good ? And are our af-
fections warmed and kindled by the discipline
with which he has visited us, rather than con-
tracted and shrivelled by the indulgence of dis-
content f If there be no expansion of the heart
;
if we cannot bless God for his mercy in afflict-
ing us, we have not yet learned the duty of ac-
quiescence in his will.
The Christian's temper, and particularly hi§
decided preference of the love of God to every
inferior blessing, is peculiarly exercised undejr
seasons of affliction. Submission to the will of
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 127
God cannot readily be counterfeited: there is
nothing in the human mind sufficiently analo-
gous with it, to assume its prevailing features^
It cannot be mistaken for the principles of the
stoic. These, indeed, may do much in fortify-
ing the mind ; but they can never bring it to a
patient submission to the disposal of Infinite
Wisdom. The highest lessons of philosophic'
morality fall very far short of this last but best
attainment of the Christian. And, indeed, this
important point of duty can only be learned of
God ; it can only be kept alive in the heart by
his power ; it can only be invigorated and sup-
ported in the soul that lives with God. The
heart which dwells much upon the earth; the
thoughts that are engaged on worldly objects;
the affections which are anxiously fixed on the
things that are seen, and which do not princi-
pally delight to love God, and to hold commu-
nion with him, are obstacles to the exercise of
resignation.
It is, indeed, quite possible to bear sufifering
without complaining, and yet not to be resigned
to the will of Heaven ; it is possible to practise
the careless apathy of indifference, without the
smallest claim to that calm composure of heart
which knows and feels, admires and loves, the
chastisements which proceed from God. There
are characters whose pride will bear them far
128 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION.
above the influence of complaint, but whose
breast is agitated by tumultuous passions, and
occupied with harsh and rebellious thoughts
against God, and his goodness and mercy.
There are, unquestionably, those, who, in the
apparent calmness with which they meet trials,
would seem to hold out examples of suffering
affliction, but who endure from necessity what
they consider as unavoidable, because murmur-
ing would but add to their disquietude; and who
stubbornly refuse to yield obedience to the all-
wise hand which dispenses every affliction as
well as every pleasure. Their quietude arises
from want of feeling on the one hand, or from
indifference to the judgments of God, not from
that peace which passeth all understanding.
The equanimity of the Christian may, per-
haps, arise in part from similar principles, and
while he aims to be submissive to his heavenly
Father, he will inquire if his resignation pro-
ceed from just principles, and if its tendency be
to wean the heart from the world, and to make
him more in love with the beauties of religion,
ar^d the glorious prospects of an unseen state.
In the performance of this difficult but import-
ant duty, he will be desirous of obtaining every
assistance, to strengthen his faith, and hope, and
dependence upon God. Such assistance has
been supplied in the animating example of suf-
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 129
fering saints, with which the Holy Scriptures
abound.
Abraham was called upon to sacrifice his son
Isaac—his oidy son—the child of his old age
—
and him on whom so large a promise depended.
He was called to yield him up into the hands of
God who gave him, when his opening faculties
had endeared him to an aged father's heart, by
many interesting associations and brightening
prospects of his future greatness, and useful-
ness, and blessedness. For this sad event he is
quite unprepared; and it is aggravated, too, by
being apparently within his own control. His
darhng child is not taken away by disease, or
by any of those accidents to which human na-
ture is liable. Had this been the case, Abra-
ham might have reflected on the impossibility of
his returning to him, and of the mercy of God
in having removed him. But he is directed to
prepare for his death—to be himself the instru-
ment!—to immolate his son to the Almighty!
Can any circumstances more distressing be con-
ceived, which would more probably excite all
the agonizing reluctance of parental affection?
And yet, when the Lord Jehovah calls him, he
answers, " Here am I ;" in faith he resigns
himself to the disposal of God ; and with the
most perfect submission to his will, he proceeds
even to the last extremity. God, however, in-
130 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATIOiN.
terposes; and he will interpose for you; nou
indeed, in the same miraculous manner, but in
enabhng you to bear with meekness and pa-
tience the trial with which he has visited you.
We see how honourable a testimony is borne to
Abraham's faith by the Apostle Paul, and the
great and inestimable benefits with which it is
connected. And the Lord himself declares that
he is well pleased with this humble sacrifice;
for, *'By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord,
because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son : that in bless-
ing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as
the sand which is upon the sea-shore; and thy
seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ; and
in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice."*
Here is encouragement to wait upon God,
and do his will: an incentive to acquiescence in
all his appointments, however painful and ad-
verse. Here too is a distinguishing proof of
the influence of religion in supporting the mind
imder the most afl^ictive dispensations; and
when we recollect, that this was exhibited by
one who did not, as we do, enjoy a clear revela-
tion of Jesus Christ, it is enough to excite the
* Gen. xxii. 16—18.
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. I3l
crimson glow of shame, that, with all our privi-
leges, we are so far behind the patriarch of old.
Let us emulate his example, and earnestly pray
for his faith, his submission, his obedience, and
then may we expect to inherit the blessings
which are prepared for those who follow his
steps.
Many other eminent saints have felt exam-
ples of resignation and patience under affliction,
such as Job, and David, and others; all serving
to strengthen and confirm the inferences we
have drawn from the example of Abraham.
Neither are the instances of a patient endurance
of affliction confined to the Old Testament dis-
pensation: for the Apostles counted it joy to
sufifer for Christ's sake; and the primitive Chris-
tians, actuated by Uvely faith in the Redeemer,
endured the cross, despised the most cruel per-
secutions, cheerfully underwent a great variety
of privations, and suffered distresses, fully equal
to any which can fall to the lot of humanity, in
the present day. Yet their strength was made
perfect in weakness ; they were enabled not only
to be submissive, and to endure with fortitude,
but to rejoice in tribulation, to triumph over
death in every frightful shape, and to commit
the keeping of their souls unto a faithfid Crea-
tor. God was with them and supported them :
his presence was the ground of their joy, and
132 ON THE DUTY of RESIGNATION.
their acquiescence in his will the means of their
receiving the richest blessings. He is able to
keep us from falling, to preserve us from every
danger, and to refine and purify us from all
iniquity.
God has likewise given for our imitation, the
example of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ.
Our adorable Lord was no stranger to sorrow,
for he was despised and rejected of men ;
yet he
opened not his mouth: he took upon himself
our infirmities, and supported the accumulated
weight of human wo; yet without the smallest
admixture of sin: in this world he was poor,
despised, and persecuted, arraigned as a crimi-
nal, and condemned, though innocent, to sufifer
the death of the cross : surely, he has borne our
griefs and carried our infirmities ; he bore our
sins ill his own body on the cross ; he suffered
the wrath of God due to the sins of guilty rebels
;
and, above all, he was deprived of the support-
ing, comforting presence of his Father^ so that
he exclaims, " My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken n>e?"* Was ever grief like this ? "My
soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death."t
Yet, though he prays earnestly and repeatedly,
*' O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me ;" he adds, "nevertheless, not as
* Matt, xxvii. 46. t Matt. xxvi. 38.
ON THE DUTY OF RESl«NATION. 133
1 will, but as thou wilt."* Thus, in his incarna-
tion, his life, his sufferings, and his death, he
every where exhibits, for the imitation of his
followers, an example of perfect submission.
Can there be a more powerful stimulus to
resignation than this, to resemble in some faint
degree the perfections of a dying Redeemer,
unto whose likeness we must be conformed in
life, and into whose image we shall be changed
from glory to glory in a world of bliss f We
shall be happy in proportion as we resemble
our crucified Lord ; and can expect the consola-
tion of his grace only in following him. Under
trials, it is delightful to the Christian to reflect,
that it is by the instrumentality of these unwel-
come monitors he is led to follow Christ. During
the calm sunshine of prosperity, he may per-
chance maintain his ground, more probably will
grow lukewarm; but it is only through much
tribulation he can follow his incarnate Lord.
His path to heaven led through difficulties, and
sorrows, and temptations, and so will that of all
his children who take up their cross and follow
him. Let us then welcome the affliction which
promises, if sanctified, to advance us nearer to
his throne, and to assimilate us with himself.
May we be ashamed that we live at so great a

12
134 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION.
distance from God; that, in the calmest mo-
ments of resignation, we fall so far short of His
obedience to the will of his heavenly Father,
and that our hearts are so cold and lifeless, in
being taught "to profit." May we seek the
guidance of his Spirit to lead us into the way of
all truth, and to bring us to himself.
He who well knew the human heart, and that
it needed " line upon line, and precept upon
precept," has not only given us examples of
obedience, but his word is amply stored with pre-
cepts and promises to enforce the duty. A few
scattered observations from the Sacred Writings
are placed below. " Thou shalt call, and I will
answer thee. He shall call upon me, and 1 will
answer him : I, will be with him in trouble ; I
will deliver him, and honour him. With long
life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.
The Lord is nigh unto all that call upon him, to
all that call upon him in truth. The righteous
cry, and the Lord heareth them, and delivereth
them out of all their troubles. How excellent
is thy loving-kindness, O God! therefore the
children of men put their trust under the shadow
of thy wings. Fear thou not; for I am with
thee : be not dismayed ; for 1 am thy God : I
will strengthen thee ;
yea, I will help thee ; yea,
I will uphold thcc with the right hand of my
righteousness. For I the Lord thy God will
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGXATION. 135
hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not
;
for I will help thee. When the poor and needy
seek water, and there is none, and their tongue
faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I
the God of Israel will not forsake them. I Imve
seen his ways, and will heal him : I will lead
him also, and restore comfort to him and to his
mourners. But now, O Lord, thou art our
Father ; we are the clay, and thou our potter
;
and we all are the work of thy hand. For I
know the thoughts that I think towards you,
saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of
evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall
ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto
me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall
seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for
me with all your heart, and I will be found of
you, saith the Lord. Though he cause grief,
yet will he have compassion according to the
multitude of his mercies. For he doth not afflict
willingly, nor grieve the children of men. The
sacrifices of God are a broken spirit ; a broken
and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not
despise. Be careful for nothing ; but in every
thing by prayer and supplication with thanks-
giving, let your requests be made known unto
God. And the peace of God, which passeth all
understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds
through Jesus Christ. If ye endure chastening,

But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all
are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not
sons. Hide not thy face from me in the day
when I am in trouble ; incUne thine ear unto
me : in the day when I call, answer me speedily.
In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me,
and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe : and I will
have respect unto thy statutes continually. O
God, be not far from me : O my God, make
haste for my help. Make haste to help me, O
Lord my salvation. Forsake me not, O Lord
;
O my God, be not far from me. Be pleased, O
Lord, to deliver, me: O Lord, make haste to
help me. Will he plead against me with his
great power ? No ; but he would put strength
in me. The Lord is on my side ; I will not fear
what man can do unto me. The Lord is the
strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid i
Though an host should encamp against me,
though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil. Cast thy burden
upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee : he
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

High shall abide under the shadow of the Al-
mighty. He that toucheth you, toucheth tljQ

apple of his eye. We have a strong city ;
sal-
vation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee,
to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear
thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone."*
Afflictions are indeed blessings in disguise.
David says, " Before I was afflicted I went
astray : but now I have known thy ways." And
he concludes " that it was good for him to have
been afflicted :"t he esteemed it one of his
greatest mercies : and thus it ever is with the
children of God in this world; they will find a
blessing concealed behind the darkest cloud,
provided they wait and pray for it. The consi-
deration of this circumstance should lead us to
the exercise of cheerfulness. We should aim
not only to be submissive, but grateful; not
merely to bear with contentment the hand which
smites, but likewise to praise him from whom
all blessings flow.
It is not contended that the mourner should
not feel and lament, but only that his brow

should not be ever clouded by anxiety, his spirits
depressed beyond recovery, nor his temper ren-
dered wayward by discontent. He should aim
at that cheerfulness which arises from casting
all his burden upon God, and the consciousness
of having intrusted himself and his all in his
hands. " Let not your heart be troubled : ye
believe in God, believe also in me. In my
Father's house are many mansions : if it were
not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare
a place for you. And if I go and prepare a
place for you, I will come again and receive
you unto myself; that where I am, there ye
may be also."*
When the fond husband or the tender parent
weeps over the dear relative whom death has
snatched away as the fragrant blossom was
hastening to maturity, the earth appears a mere
blank, an empty space, a Hfeless portrait, a
landscape in which we must appear to move,
but whence the vital principle, which till now
has animated our bosoms, has fled for ever.
He must finish his journey alone, and the solitude
of his aching bosom will be relieved only by
those unparticipated disquietudes which await
him as he passes through life.
But when he looks beyond the grave to the
* John xiv. 1—3.
OiN THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 139
rest which remaineth for the people of God;
when he contemplates the dearest friend of his
bosom removed from suftering, and entered into
this rest ; translated from earth to heaven, from
sorrow to joy, from pain to immortality, and
transformed into the image of his Redeemer;
he experiences a degree of peace which nought
else can afford. He calmly yields to the will of
his heavenly Father, and finds a satisfaction
almost indescribable, while his spirit bounds
farward in anticipation of the blissful period,
when mortality shall be swallowed up of life
;
when this corruptible shall have put on incor-
ruptioii, and his spirit, disengaged from the dull
prison of mortality, shall wing its flight to realms
of day.
Imagination fondly pictures the guardian care
of those we have lost, as especially extended
over us; and as it verges to the last closing
scene, and looks forward to the translation of
the soul to a heavenly world, it faintly portrays
the exquisite delight it would experience, on
being welcomed to this peaceful habitation by
that glorified spirit, now the hapless occasion of
his grief and of his tears ; but ever after tlie en-
deared companion and participator of his eternal
felicity. You may weep for your loss : even the
Saviour wept for Lazarus : but all his disciples,
all who hope to be with him hereafter, must
140 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION.
*'
weep as though they wept not," must be pre-
pared to resign every blessing they enjoy, when
called upon to take up their cross and follow
him. For *'
whosoever loveth father or mother,
or husband or wife, more than me, hath no part
in my kingdom:" while we are assured on the
other hand, that " these light afflictions which
are but for a moment, work out for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory:
and that in due time we shall reap, if we faint
not."
With these glorious prospects, who would
not pray for submission to the will of God ? It
is an arduous but imperative duty, and trusting
to our own strength, we must fail in the per-
formance. Hence the necessity of seeking for
divine assistance from Him who has declared,
*'
I will not leave you comfortless : 1 will come
to you. In the world ye shall have tribulation
:
but be of good cheer, I have overcome the
world."* So long as we attempt to exercise
submission to the will of God of ourselves, so
often shall we find that the human heart is
enmity against him, and that it is not naturally
subject to his will. While we remain frail, im-
perfect, erring creatures, we shall stand in need
of extraordinary consolation and support, or we
* Johnxiv. 18; xvi, 33.
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 141
shall be incapable of glorifying God by our ac-
quiescence in his will, and our humble, cheerful
reliance on his goodness, and mercy, and love.
Thus our almighty and compassionate Father
has provided for our necessities : he knows our
hearts and frailties better than we do ourselves :
and he has kindly promised the assistance of his
Spirit, who is emphatically styled the Comforter,
even the Spirit of Truth, who " shall teach you
all things, and bring all things to your remem-
brance." *'
Without me ye can do nothing,"
says the Saviour ;
" and in his strength you will
be more than conquerors."
Those only who are taught by the Spirit of
grace, can feel that entire acquiescence in the
word of God, from which so much comfort is to
be derived. Though the Scriptures may con-
ciliate our regards by their intrinsic beauty, and
majesty, and grandeur, yet they will never engage
our hearts and affections but through the agency
of the Spirit. And unless this be the case, the-
efficiency of the divine word as a source of con-
solation, will rest on a very precarious basis.
How shall we obey the commandments of the
Lord, unless we seriously and believingly receive
them ? And how shall we receive them, if we
are not taught of God? It is only by the Spirit's
influence that we become united to Christ, and
heirs of the blessings which are treasured up in

him : it is only as '<
the Spirit of holiness" dwells
in us, that we can be estranged from the world,
become dead to. sin and alive to righteousness,
and can do that which is well pleasing in his
sight ; or that we can live by faith, and walk in
newness of life. It is his office to take of the
things of Christ and reveal them unto us ; and
by his agency alone we can be strengthened,
and enabled to yield to the merciful corrections
of our almighty Friend.
Nor was this Comforter promised only to the
Apostles, but to all the children of God. Were
it not for his effectual presence and blessing,
they could not sustain the trials with which they
are, and have been, visited. But he is ever
present with those that love him, he will be
found of those who seek him. Through his
wisdom we shall learn obedience; through his
strength we shall be encouraged to walk on in
our duty ; and by his influence we shall be puri-
fied from sin, and receive the riches of grace
which are treasured up in Christ Jesus; we
shall be enabled under every affliction to main-
tain adequate and right thoughts of God; our
spiritual strength will be preserved; we shall
walk correctly, since he helpeth our infirmity;
and as he maketh continual intercession for us,
we shall come boldly to a throne of grace, and
8£ek jgrace and strength for every time of need.*
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 143
Happy are we, if we have in some degree
realized his comforting, supporting presence;
if we, through his influence, have embraced a
Saviour, and are desirous of being taught of
God ; if, forsaking every present vain and feeble
prop, we come to Jesus with child-like disposi-
tions, simply desirous of submitting our whole
souls to his disposal. Then have we reason to
rejoice in the darkest hour: even during the
storm we shall not feel its terrors, we shall be
safe, for Jesus is our hiding-place. Guide us,
O blessed Spirit, to this safe abode, and pre-
serve us from wandering from thy way.
Yet so feeble is the mind, so prone the heart
to deviate from its centre, that we stand in need
of every possible support in the performance of
this most important duty. Hence, it is well
frequently to review those considerations which
form the basis of acquiescence in the divine ap-
pointment. And when the turbulence of passion
is almost enough to overwhelm the Christian,
and induce him to distrust the faithfulness of
God, let the circumstances of his affliction be
reviewed, let him regard them with the eye of
rehgion, weigh them in the balance of Scripture,
and ask himself, whether God has forgotten to
be gracious—rather, whether he has not remem-
bered mercy at the very moment his arm was
extended to afflict.?
144 ON THE DUTY OF KE8IGNATIOIN.
Are there not very many circumstances of
palliation in the present affliction, to excite your
gratitude and confidence? Have you not many
mercies to be thankful for, and might not these
likewise have been smitten? Might not God
have required your all, instead of this loveliest
blessing? And is it not infinitely kind of him
to provide you such everlasting and substantial
consolation? to promise to be with you, and im-
prove you by means of suflfering ? Besides, has
not your dear relative been taken from the evil
to come, and translated from a thorny wilderness
to the joys of Paradise? A gracious Saviour
had nurtured and prepared him for everlasting
glory ; and should you wish for his return to
earth and sorrow ? This would be a sad ex-
change indeed, vvhile death has paved the way
to everlasting happiness and peace.
Perhaps you had watched all the expanding
beauties of his character, had seen them advance
to the maturity of the Christian, and had pro-
mised yourself much enjoyment of its excellen-
cies for many years. God chooses M'iser and
better for you ; he has ripened the blooming
ear, and gathiered the fruit into his garner. He
has saved it from the chilly air of sin, from the
blasting mildew of indifference, and from the
destructive influence of error. Jehovah has per-
fected the character, and your friend has entered
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 145
into the joy of his Lord. He calls upon you to
follow him, to prepare for a heavenly world, to
be weaned from earth and attached to heaven,
to seek that haven of rest where he has now*
securely anchored.
The Lord God is the sovereign Disposer of
all. He is the supreme Governor of the uni-
verse, his eye is upon the evil and the good, he
is every where present, and directs every event
by the word of his power. In the government
of the world, he displays the most inflexible
Justice. " Justice and judgment are the habita-
tion of thy throne. Surely his salvation is nigh
them that fear him; that glory may dwell in
our land. Mercy and truth have met together
;
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth shall spring out of the earth ; and righte-
ousness shall look down from heaven. Yea,
the Lord shall give that which is good ; and our
land shall yield her increase. Righteousness
shall go before him ; and shall set us in the way
of his steps."* He is not man that he should
err, nor the son of man that he should repent
;
but a Beiiig of infinite purity and holiness, pre-
siding over the actions and thoughts of men,
and overruling them to his glory.
No caprice, no unjust and unworthy motives,
* Psa. iMxix. 14 ; kxxv. 9—13,
13
146 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION*
no angry passions influence his conduct; his
decrees are the offspring of hoHness, justice^
and truth : what he has appointed should come
to pass, none can hinder : for, even the winds
and the waves obey him, and all things, animate
and inanimate, are controlled by his will, and
become subservient to the execution of his pur-
poses. He is infinite wisdom. Nothing can
occur without his knowledge. Where least the
hand of Omnipotence can be traced, still there
he silently governs and directs the most trivial
event. Nothing can escape his piercing eye:
he sees the past, the present, and the future;
and what he arranges for the good of his chil-
dren, is the offspring of boundless intelligence.
No contingencies happen to him ; no unforeseen
circumstances influence his will ; for he is ac-
quainted with all possibilities, and knows at
once the remotest consequences.
As our adorable Lord is infinitely wise, so is
he merciful and good. He beareth long with
sinners; he suffereth our wanderings from him;
he showers down his blessings upon ungrateful
man ; he surrounds him with mercies, and would
allure him to the enjoyment of everlasting peace
and happiness in his service and love. Surely
then it becomes us to be obedient to the acts of
his government, whose punishments are ever
lighter than our sins ; who is able to preserve
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 147
US from falling, and to supply every want ; wh®
is acquainted with the most secret recesses of
our bosom ; whose heart is filled with pity and
compassion, and overflows with loving-kindness
to his children; who does not willingly afflict
them, and only for their good ; who is able to
support, and willing to afford them everlasting
consolation.
Nor must we forget, that, as a Sovereign, he
has a distinct claim to our obedience, and a per-
fect right to do with us as seemeth good in his
sight. He is our Creator and Preserver; in
him we live, by him we breathe, and our com-
forts are sustained. We are his children, his
subjects; and, as such, obedience to his laws is
required of us. For, can we temporize with
him who sees our inmost thoughts, and is inti-
mately acquainted with all we feel ? His yoke
is "easy," and his burden "light;" for he sup-
ports the cumbrous load: and though he will
have his children willing to sustain the trials of
his disciphne, yet he has promised strength
equal to their day; he has engaged to be with
them ; yea, he sympathizes with them, and kindly
shares the weight of sorrows under which they
groan.
This idea is still further enhanced by the
consideration of our dependence upon him. Our
daily blessings are received from his hand ; oiir
148 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION.
especial mercies are the offspring of his love and
of his care. The good we commonly enjoy,
and almost overlook the hand which dispenses,
comes equally from Him to whom we owe our
greatest benefits. Perhaps we undervalue our
blessings of light, and air, and health, because
we enjoy them every day ; when, in fact, for the
continuance of these, we are equally dependent
upon God. Were it not for his goodness and
ever-watchful care, were it not for his constant
preservation, we should no longer be cheered
with the vicissitudes of the seasons, the sun
might withhold its light, and the air we breathe
would soon become contaminated, had he not
wisely provided for its renovation. Ungrateful
man is alone insensible to his Creator's kindness,
when all nature wakes out of sleep, and as the
day dawns from on high, hails the rising sun
with cheerful aspirations of praise to Him who
governs and preserves the universe in its present
harmonious perfection.
Should we then undervalue our comforts be-
cause they are daily received ? Especial blessings
are alone required on particular emergencies;
it is every day we need a renewed supply of
daily mercies. It is the goodness of God which
leads him to declare it to be his delight to dwell
wirli ti e children of r/ien. It is solely his mercy
and love which induce him to take pity on us,
ON THE DUTY ©F RESIGNATION. 149
and to offer us his friendship, and presence, and
blessing. It is his infinite goodness which leads
us to bear with our wanderings, and affection-
ately to invite us to repentance. It is his good-
ness which supplies our wants, corrects our
errors, and defends us in danger. " Of ourselves^
we are insufficient as of ourselves to think any
good thing : but our sufficiency is of God ; for
of him, and to him, and through him, are all
things."*
If we have any hope of eternal happiness ; if
we have any benevolent dispositions towards
those around us ; if, when we have backslidden
from God, our hearts are filled with sorrow and
contrition, and we wish to return unto the Shep-
herd and Bishop of our souls ; if we obtain par-
don of our iniquities, and reconciliation to Him
whose favour is life ; and if we are enabled to
persevere in a virtuous course ; still all this is
of God, who worketh in us both to will and to
do ; all is of God, who hath first reconciled us
to himself, through Jesus Christ, his Son and
our Saviour, who is the medium through which
we receive the communication of his favours.
And still further, it is only by the quickening
influence of the Holy Spirit, which proceedeth
from the Father and the Son, that we can be
2 Cor. ill. 5.
13*
150 ^N THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION*
made capable of receiving the great blessing'^
he has to bestow. So entirely dependent are we
on Almighty God, for all we have, and are, or
hope to be hereafter.
Is it not most reasonable that we should cheer-
fully submit to Him who is thus our Sovereign
Guide here, and will be our everlasting Judge ;
that we should yield obedience to Him by whom
we think and feel, and in whom alone we live
and breathe : that we should delight to do or to
suffer the will of Him who bestows upon his
people such pecuhar blessings, and who makes
affliction the means of their sanctification ? Is
it not most wise to yield submissively to Him,
who, while he deprives us of one blessing, is
able, is willing, is waiting to bestow on us bless-
ings far superior, even " the ornament of a meek
and quiet spirit," and to fix all our hopes and
affections on himself? He removes temporal.
In order to confer spiritual blessings ; he takes
away your friend, in order to bestow upon you
himself, and teach you to value his presence,
his truth, his love.
But God is likewise a faithful Creator. In
contemplating the character of /Jehovah as the
Creator, this title must not be confined to the
mere act by which the heavens and the earth
were formed, but must extend likewise to the
preservation of all things. He superintends the
ON THE DUTY OF RESI6NATI0N. 151
work of his hands : by his watchful providence
he sees the wants of his creatures, and he affords
them suitable suppUes, always providing icliat is
best for them, " These wait all upon thee ; that
thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
That thou givest them, they gather : thou openest
thy hand, they are filled with good. Thou hidest
thy face, they are troubled : thou takest away
their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created;
and thou renewest the face of the earth."*
It is a source of pleasing reflection to the
Christian sufferer, that nothing happens to him
by chance. Even the sparrows are the objects
of the Almighty's care ; and how much more
man, in so far as he is better than many spar-
rows ! Even the hairs of his head are numbered,
and nothing can occur to him, but as the instru-
ment of divine compassion and tender regard.
Not the meanest insect escapes his providential
notice ; and, in a particular manner, he watches
over his people, and preserves them from harm,
or directs their path where he has chosen they
should walk.
All creatures are subject to his will, and none
can injure us, but in the accomplishment of his
designs ; and if we are sincerely desirous of
* Psa. civ. 27—30,
152 eN THE DUTY OP RESIGNATION*
loving and serving him, we know that love is
the mainspring of his conduct towards us. He
watches over his children with assiduity, and he
will not that any should harm them, but seeks
to recall them to his fold. Could we keep in
view the design of infinite benignity in afflicting
us, and rest assured of the wisdom of his ap-
pointments; could we regard the tendency of
affliction to humble us, to convince us of sloth-
fulness, to rouse us to the exercise of patience,
to subdue the irregularities of our affections and
passions, and excite us to practise Christian
self-denial ; we should then leave ourselves in his
hand. Though the eye be dimmed by the tear
of agony, and incapable of tracing his footsteps
in the storms which desolate our fairest prospects
and dearest hopes ; though we cannot penetrate
the cloud which surrounds us; and though our
little sun of earthly joy seems to have sunk
below the horizon, never to return and animate
us with his cheering presence ;
yet we must ever
remember, that God rides upon the whirlwind
and manages the storm, conducts every event by
the pure light of his wisdom and truth, arranges
each in the most exact order, and directs it to
its proper end. Soon the Sun of Righteousness
shall arise with healing in his wings ; and though
you have lost your dearest friend, yet his happy
spirit, freed from the shackles of mortality, hajR
ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 153
winged its flight to realms of day, and is now
shining, and will for ever shine, in the mansions
of the blest. " Lo ! these are parts of his ways,
but how little a portion is heard of him !"
The Almighty governs his people in love and
for their good ; hence they owe him their grateful
aspirations of praise for his gracious support, a
calm and deliberate dedication of themselves to
him during the darkest hours of adversity, and
a firm reliance on his goodness and love with
respect to the future. In the gloomiest seasons,
the Christian will still lift up his heart to hea-
ven, and pray for that patience and submission
which are the gift of God. " Yea, though he
walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
he will fear no evil ;" for he will exclaim, " Thy
rod and thy staff they comfort me."
But God is also a compassionate Father. In
this endearing relationship he is ever nigh unto
his people, and that to bless them. We are his
children by creation, and we partake the common
blessings of his bounty ; but we are his children
more especially by virtue of his grace implanted
in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. When we
have received Christ as our Saviour, and our
only hope ; when we have renounced our attach-
ment to the " pomps and vanities" of this w^orld
;
when we have learned to yield obedience to him,
and to strive earnestly to live to his glory; then
154 ON THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION.
we are, indeed, his children, and God is our
Father. As such, he provides for our every
want ; he watches over us with unremitting
care ; he restrains our wanderings from him
;
and when he sees it necessary to correct us, he
looks down upon us with the tenderest sym-
pathy.
How fondly does the affectionate parent watch
over the infant years of her helpless offspring
!
How eagerly does she listen to its feeblest cry,
and cheerfully abandon her own comforts for the
sake of her child! How large a space in her
heart is occupied by her darling babe ! All her
life is characterized by the pursuit of its happi-
ness. How tenderly does she watch over its
expanding mind ! How carefully does she pre-
serve it from the contagion of vice, while she
nurtures the benevolent affections, and, with the
earliest dawn of reason's morn, instills the pure
principles of Christianity! With what fearful
forebodings does she anticipate the period when
this sweet flower must be exposed to the stormy
world ! With what care does she prepare it for
the trials, the difficulties, and dangers of life!
With what diligence does she repress the first
angry emotions, the first symptoms of vice I Not

and raiment, and temporal comforts, and know-

the nursery of Piety for the Paradise of God
;
and while she would acquaint it early with its
fallen state, and the only hope of recovery, she
would earnestly train and discipline the mind to
propriety of conduct originating from correctness
of principle. Though her heart be filled with
affection and tenderness, yet with wisdom and
justice she corrects the wandering, and punishes
the disobedient and self-willed.
But our Father which is in heaven is infi-
nitely wise ; he is love ; his compassions fail not,
and he cannot be influenced by the infirmities
or necessities of our nature. " Surely he shall
deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover
thee with his feathers, and under his wings
shalt thou trust : . his truth shall be thy shield
and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the
terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by
day ; nor for the pestilence that walketh in
darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth
at noon-day. A thousand shall fall at thy side,
and ten thousand at thy right hand^ but it shall
not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt
thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Because thou hast made the Lord which is my
refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation
;
there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any
plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall

give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee
in all thy ways. On this wise ye shall bless the
children of Israel, saying unto them, The Lord
bless thee, and keep thee : the Lord make his
face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee
:
the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and
give thee peace. And they shall put my name
upon the children of Israel; and I will bless
them."* He declares that an earthly parent
may forget her offspring, yet he car not cease to
have compassion on his children. His bowels
yearn over their sorrows: in all their affliction,
he is afflicted ; and the angel of his presence is
nigh to comfort them.
What inference, then, must we draw from
this display of the tenderness of Jehovah's cha-
racter? Must we not allow, that as our Father,
when he requires that the heart and affections
should be placed on himself, he has an absolute
right to them? He knows what is best for us:^
hence the necessity of yielding obedience to him,
and the sinfulness of withholding any thing from
him.
He is an all-sufficient friend. Who has not
felt the value of friendship in the hour of sor-
row? Who has not proved the truth of the sen-
timent, that "it is the winter of sorrow best
proves" the worth of a friend? The kind hand

of affection; the sympathetic tear; the warm
heart which beats in unison with another's wo;
the bosom expanded to receive the expression
of heartfelt anguish, and animated with kindred
emotion; the mild and persuasive eloquence
which would alleviate when it cannot remedy,
and which would sooth and calm when it cannot
alleviate; and the anxious desire to participate
every painful feeling, and to share each rising
thought; possess claims which none can esti-
mate but those who have experienced their
power.
But friendship is bounded by the narrow
sphere of sympathy: it aims to relieve, where
it can only share the anguish of the troubled
bosom: it would set the heart at rest, but it can
only palliate its oppression : it would give peace,
and restore the lost blessing, when it can only
bear a part of the weight of suffering. But
Jehovah is able as well as willing. His bound-
less sympathy far exceeds the highest concep-
tions of human love ; and when he would share
our griefs and carry our burdens, he can give
peace to the mind—peace which passeth all un-
derstanding. He can participate our sorrows
;
and though he inflicts the wound, he will faith-
fully provide the balm : when he giveth quiet-
ness, who then shall create sorrow?
His faithfulness is engaged to support, com-
14
158 ON THE £)UTY OF RESIGNATIOX*
fort, and assist us ; and finally give us a happy
issue out of every trial. He is a very present
help in trouble. We cannot always enjoy the
soothing accents of the voice of friendship ; but
our Almighty Friend is alv^^ays with us: during
the sleepless night and restless day, his presence
is our stay. When dxjprived of earthly com-
forts, and the mind rests with gloomy delight
on the exquisitely painful and dreary solitude
with which it is encompassed, then God is nigh;
he kindly proffers his support : he can make the
wilderness to blossom as the rose, and the heart
of the widow to sing for joy.
A thousand circumstances may interrupt the
communion of friendship upon earth : but God
is not like to corruptible man ; he is omnipotent
and unchangeable. He knows not the shadow
of turning : he is a friend that loveth at all
times. Do we need to pour out the anguish of
our souls into the bosom of friendship, he invites
us to himself, and promises rest to the weary
and the heavy laden. Do we require sympathy^
he feels for us : he knows what sore tempta-
tions mean ; he is acquainted with the feeble-
ness of our nature, and affords support ; he is
ever present, hears our complaints, and has
engaged to send us answers of peace. Do we
need consolation, he is able and willing to save
;
he can bind up the broken-hearted, can heal
ON' THE DUTY OF RESIGNATION. 159
the troubled bosom, and restore peace to the
anxious breast. Do we require instruction and
direction along the stormy way, he has promised
to guide and protect us ; and offers his word
as a lamp unto our feet and a light iiKto our
path. He has said, " Let not your heart be
troubled : ye believe in God, beheve also in me.
I will not leave you comfortless : I will come to
you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto
you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid."*
He is a gracious monitor. To give advice,
and administer reproof, is one of the most diffi-
cult and last performed offices of human friend-
ship. But with God, this is no difficult task.
He afflicts in order that the mind may be
softened to receive reproof and instruction;
he prepares the heart to listen to his admoni-
tions, and thus gaining entire access to the soul,
he is enabled, by the still small voice of the Spirit
of his grace, to say, "This is the way, walk ye
in it." He suggests the existence of the very
evil his discipline is intended to remove, or
points to the necessity of exercising the graces
he has designed to strengthen. He awakens
the supineness and indolence of the lethargic

bosom, and rouses to activity and exertion in
the cause of God ; and thus prepares the heart
for a purer, a more fervent, and a steadier aim
to the promotion of his glory, and the advance-
ment and extension of his power. He enhghtens
the understanding, renews the Will, and enables
us to discern, as well as choose, the things which
pertain to our everlasting peace. He warns us
of danger, cautions against the indulgence of
evil, and admonishes of the benefits to be derived
from suffering.
Surely, then, we can but infer the peace and
safety of yielding submission to a Friend so
wise, who condescends to arrange our affairs for
us. Omniscient goodness knoweth all things.
He wisely ordains what is best for us ; and well
knowing that we are incapable of choosing for
ourselves, he condescends to superintend and
appoint the events v/hich shall befall us. Inti-
mately acquainted with these circumstances,
surely it is more than folly, if we do not meekly,
quietly, and obediently acquiesce in his appoint-
ments. Since we remain in his hands, we are
safe from every hurtful snare ; and we are
assured that all things shall work together for
our good; for he has promised us protection,
and has engaged to convert the bitter cup of
sorrow into the healing balm of contrition. He
will give rest unto his people. How urgent a

motive to be still in the hour of darkness, and
to wait for the peace and the deliverance which
he has promised in his own time ; assured of
our inviolable security, if we put our trust in
Him who is our refuge and strength :
" a strength
to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the
storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast
of the terrible ones is as a storm against the
wall. He will swallow up death in victory;
and the Lord God will wipe away tears from
off all faces."^ And "it shall be said in that
day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for
him, and he will save us : this is the Lord ; we
have waited for him, we will be glad and re->
joice in his salvation."*

CHAPTER Vir:
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
We have already traced the duties of the
mourner, and shall now take a view of the con-
solations provided for him, in submitting to the
will of God. These consolations are promised
to those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sin-
cerity and truth, who are desirous of imitating
his example, and hving to his glory.
" There is no peace, saith my God, to the
wicked;" neither can the troubled bosom,
agitated by a thousand turbulent passions and
solicitudes, lay claim to a participation of those
consolations which are provided only for such as
live by faith upon the Son of God. Yet even
those w^lio are estranged from God, though they
cannot appropriate these comforts to themselves,
^re not left vs^ithout solace under the loss of
their relatives. They claim our pity, for they
suffer acutely : they feel as much as others, and
they have not the same support under their
trials. They know the bitterness of sorrow,
without the pleasure of obedience ; they suffer
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 163
affliction, without the heart-cheering prospect of
eternal rest, when " death shall be swallowed
up in victory."
If these pages should fall into the hands of
such an one—if you are indeed mourning the
loss of your earthly comforts, and not a ray of
hope, reflected from eternity, cheers your soli-
tude, and animates you with delightful anticipa-
tions of futurity ; if you have lost your dearest
treasure, that in which your soul delighted, and
your prospects are now clouded by the gloom of
death ; if you are suffering under the mighty
hand of God, and yet perceive not the hand that
gives you the bread and water of affliction, nor
whence cometh your help ; if you are experi-
encing his wrath, and are not induced to inquire
wherefore he contends with you, and to search
and try your hearts, repent of your iniquities,
and turn unto the Lord your God ; if you are
angry with him under your trials, refusing to
yield submission to his will, and caUing in ques-
tion the equity of his government, or the purity,
wisdom, and goodness of his dispensations ; if
you harden that heart which he would mould
into conformity to his will, and impiously mur-
mur against heaven, or carelessly neglect its
admonitions, it is to you I would address the
following considerations ; and while they tend to
mitigate your grief, may they induce you to be
164 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
seriously concerned about your own state : for,
if you have no glimmering of peace, except a
vague and ill-defined idea of a future state of
ease, it is time that you begin to seek that rest
which "remaineth for the people of God."
How are you prepared to enter on an eternal
scene of existence, if you cannot bear the will
of God ? How shall you enjoy the happiness of
heaven, where it will be your sole employ to love
and serve him, or be conformed to the image of
the Saviour, when you refuse obedience to your
heavenly Father, and when your heart is fixed
and riveted to earth? It is in this world that
the state of man is irrecoverably fixed ; he will
receive hereafter according to the deeds done in
the body; and while you are living estranged
from God, and secretly hating his laws and his
government, how shall you follow your dear
relation, now gone to glory ? Thus unprepared
for death, and for your coming change, adore
the long-suffering goodness and sparing mercy
of Jehovah, that you are not called away from
this world, that life is still afforded you, that
you are still invited to seek God, and to attend
to those things which belong to your everlastings
peace.
Disease might have been commissioned to cut
short your slender thread of life, instead of
your dearest friends : at this moment you might
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 16u
liave been a nothing; and the future destiny of
your soul, born for immortality, might have been
fixed. Where, then, would the disembodied
spirit have found rest ? In heaven ? Alas ! no ;
for here there is nothing congenial with it. The
atmosphere of heaven is love; the Lamb of God
is the light thereof; and all its joys and all
its engagements centre in loving, adoring, and
praising Him that was slain for sinners. In
these acclamations you could not have united
with the spirits of the just; and here, therefore,
is no happiness for you. Yet this is the rest
prepared for the people of God ; and if you cannot
enter into it, you must be for ever excluded from
the blessedness of the righteous. Your spirit i;s
not fitted for communion with the pure intelli-
gences of a heavenly world : and since there is
no alternative but happiness and misery, if you
lose the one, you will necessarily enter into the
sorrows of those who are excluded from it.
As you have been living without God in the
world, and refusing to listen to his admonitions,
so have you increased his displeasure ; and justly
might he call you away from life, and consign
you to that cheerless abode, where Hope never
enters. But though God reminds you of the
uncertainty of life ; though he shows you the
necessity of an habitual preparation for death,
and seeks to soften and gain admission to your
166 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
heart; though he warns you to fly from the
wrath to come ; invites you to follow him who
has entered into the joy of his Lord ; offers the
blessings of salvation through a crucified Re-
deemer, and you refuse to listen —yet he spares
your life, and again entreats you to come to him,
that you might have life. Rejoice, then, that
your days are prolonged; and seek to follow
those who, through faith and patience, inherit
the promises. If you will but listen to the still
small voice of the Spirit of God, the affliction
under which you now suffer, may prove the
means of your everlasting blessedness ; it may
lead you to God for pardon, for grace and
strength, and every good and perfect gift.
You have been living in forgetfulness of God,
and ignorant of the beneficent hand which has
daily been doing you good. You have refused
attention to the invitations of the Gospel, and
obedience to the commands of a Saviour, de-
pending upon your own righteousness, and re-
fusing the righteousness of Christ. Affliction,
by bringing you to reflection, awakening your
fears, and exciting your attention to eternity,
may become the instrument of showing yau your
distance from heaven, and the entire helplessness
of your situation ; it may bring you to inquire
into the way of salvation ; to know the nature of
the blessings prepared for those who love God;
ON THE SOURCES @F CONSOLATION, 167
and thus you may be led to lay hold of the hope
set before you in the Gospel. If this should prove
to be the case, you will greatly rejoice that you
have been afflicted, though now for a season
you may be in heaviness.
You are environed by all the gloomy solemni-
ties of death. The voice which so lately cheered
you, is now hushed in eternal silence ; the ex-
pressive countenance, though the last smile of
affection may still linger on the features, and
almost seem to animate the cold and pallid
cheek with its wonted hue of pleasure, is now
no lonsfer the index of the thousand deliohtful
emotions w^hich once constituted the friend; the
beaming eye, so lately sparkling with the match-
less eloquence of mild intelligence, is now sunk
into its orbit ; the late active bosom, no longer
responsive to its kindred heart, lies motionless,
incapable of sympathy, alike insensible to pre-
sent joy or suffering. And can you look on that
beloved corpse; can you reflect on the endeared
scenes of affection, which memory too faithfully
depicts ; can you follow the departed spirit t©
the regions of the blest, and not be incited to
inquire, what is death, and how was this painful
separation introduced into the world ?
To this inquiry, an answer must be given in
the words of inspiration: " That by the disobe-
<lience of one man, Adam, sin came into the
168 ON THE SC>URCES OF CONSOLATION.
world, and death by sin.!'* What, then, is this:
great evil, which has entailed a curse upon the
children of men, and from which you yourself
are not exempt ? for, by the same infallible
Guide you are informed, that *'
to love the Lord
your God with all your heart, and with all your
soul, and with all your mind, is the first and
great commandment."t Yet your conscience
informs you, you do not so love God; and if you
do not, you have broken his law, and thus obtain
an affecting proof of the overwhelming influence
of sin over the heart. What, then, is the cause
of this aversion from God, and from his com-
mandments ? It is the reigning influence of a
corrupt, depraved nature, inherited from the first
transgressor Adam. The Scriptures of everlast-
ing truth inform us, that the heart of man is
" deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked;" that we cannot think a good thought,
nor do a good action ; that if we say we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, we make God a liar>
and the truth is not in us ; that we are prone to
evil, and that continually ; and that there is none
righteous, there is none that understandeth,
none that seeketh after God.
Man was created in the image of God, and
formed in purity and innocence ; but he broke
- Rom. V. 12: f Matt. xxji. 37, ^
ON THE SOURCES OP CONSeLATION. 169
the law of God, " whereby" (in the expressive
language of the established church) '* it came
to pass, that as before he was blessed, so now
he was accursed ; as before he was loved, so
now he was abhorred; as before he was most
beautiful and precious, so now he was most
vile and wretched in the sight of his Lord and
Maker; instead of the image of God, he was
become the image of the devil ; instead of the
citizen of heaven, he was become the bond-slave
of hell, having in himself no one part of his
original purity and cleanness, but being alto-
gether spotted and defiled ; insomuch that he
now seemed to be nothing else but a lump of
sin, and therefore, by the just judgment of God,
was condemned to everlasting death." And as
in " Adam all died," this curse fell not only
on himself, but on his posterity and children
for ever.
This is your condition, lost, ruined, and un-
done ; but your Bible informs you, that God is
merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abun-
dant in goodness and truth ; that he willeth not
the death of a sinner, but rather that he should
turn unto him and hve ; it invites you to repent-
ance, and liolds out the hope of eternal salvation
to those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
as the only way of acceptance and justification.

The oflfering of Christ once made, is that per-

feet redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction
for all the sins of the whole world, both original
and actual ; and there is none other satisfaction
for sin but that alone. It is a faithful saying,
and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners."
Because all men have broken the law of God,
and incurred his righteous displeasure, it is im-
possible that any can be saved by his own works.
All our most holy acts are polluted in the sight of
God, and can only be accepted by him through
the mediation and intercession of a Saviour.
Yet "when all hope of righteousness was past
on our parts ; when we had nothing in ourselves
whereby we might quench his burning wrath,
and work the salvation of our souls ; then, even
then, did Christ the Son of God come down
from heaven, to be wounded for our sakes—to
be reputed with the wicked—to be condemned
to death—to take upon him the reward of our
sins—and to give his body to be broken on the
cross for our offences ; that we, by virtue of his
blood shed upon the cross, and of his finished
righteousness, imputed to us through faith in his
atoning sacrifice, might be clean purged from
our sins, and made righteous again in his sight.
But the devils also believe and tremble; yet this
is not that faith which worketh by love. And
this true Christian faith hath no man, who, in
ON THE SOURCES OP CONSOLATIOx\. 171
the outward profession of his mouth, and in his
outward receiving of the sacraments—in coming
to the church, and in all other outward appear-
ances, seemeth to be a Christian man, and yet
in his hvino^ and deeds showino: the contrary."
Thus you do see that the only mean and in-
strument of salvation required on our parts, is
*'
faith ; that is to say, a sure trust and confidence
in the mercies of God. Yet faith without works
is dead : it is not faith, as a dead man is not a
man. This dead faith, therefore, is not that
sure and substantial faith which saveth sinners.
But that faith which worketh by love, is a quick
and living faith. And this faith is not without
hope and trust in God ; nor without the love of
God, and of our neighbours; nor without 4;he
fear of God; nor without the desire to hear
God's word, and to follow the same in eschewing
evil, and doing gladly all good works."*
From this brief summary of Christian doc-
trine you will learn your own miserable con-
dition, the necessity of repentance, humbhng
yourself before God, and crying to Him for
mercy who alone can give you peace, rest, and
quietness of conscience. These blessings he has
promised to those who dihgently seek him ; not
for their own merits, but of his great loving-

kindness and tender mercies, for the sake of
Christ Jesus, who was crucified, dead, and
buried, that he might be made ahve, fitted for
an inheritance with the saints in hght, and made
heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ. Un-
speakably happy will you be, if you are brought
seriously to reflect upon and embrace these
great truths, by the influence of afllliction; and
earnestly to fly to Jesus for grace and strength,
the forgiveness of sins, and conformity to his
glorious image. No longer continue careless or
indifferent; but implore the divine assistance,
to lead and guide you into the way of all truth,
and then, when the present cloud shall have
passed away, you will have reason to rejoice in
the Lord, and in the power of his might.
But I now turn to the Christian mourner,
and offer to him the rich consolations provided
in the Gospel. Your loss is indeed great
;
nature feels the dissolution of its tenderest at-
tachments ; let us then examine whence cometh
your help : and may the God of peace fill your
heart with peace and joy, a peace which passeth
understanding, a joy which arises from the anti-
cipation of the glory that shall be revealed in
you, when these light afflictions shall have ac-
complished their design, even the sanctification
of your souls.
It is the Lord's hand that is upon you
:
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 173
troubles do not spring from the dust ; they are
not brought about by fortuitous events, but are
commissioned by Infinite Wisdom to accomplish
its designs. He knows, and sees, and orders
what is best for you; and you may be assured
that he doth all things well.
While we confine our views to the circum-
scribed sphere of our present vision, our minds
are agitated and disturbed by a thousand vain
regrets and foolish wishes. But when we con-
template every event of our lives as sent by
God, and so nicely arranged and adjusted, that
nothing can happen but through his permission,
and even under his especial guidance and govern-
ment, we are induced to exclaim, " It is the
Lord. Shall we receive good at the hand of
the Lord, and shall we not receive evil ? The
Lord gave, and the^ Lord hath taken away;
blessed be the name of the Lord. I was dumb
with silence ; I opened not my mouth, because
thou didst it. The Lord killeth, and maketh
aUve; he bringeth down to the grave, and
bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor, and
maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
We will be still, and know that he is God ; for
the Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob
is our refuge."
When we look to him as the Author of our
sorrows, our minds become tranquil, our doubts
15*
174 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
are removed, every gloomy presage is banished,
the dark cloud is chased away, and the light of
the Sun of Righteousness beams upon our soli-
tary and benighted way, and shows that the path
to happiness and heaven leads thither through
much tribulation. We are no longer disturbed
by the solicitude of anxious inquiry as to the
causes by which such and such events have been
brought about ; for God condescends to appoint
them, and from him should we receive them;
assured, that if we are his people, we are im-
moveably secure amidst every changing scene.
God is the fountain of true comfort. But he
can be so to us only in proportion as we can call
him our God. Do we then feel satisfied that we
are his children, that we love him because he
first loved us ; and that we are desirous of serving
him, and living with a single eye to his glory?
We can be happy under the severest trials ; for
we know that we are the objects of his especial
favour and regard, and that nothing can hurt
us, since the faithfulness of Jehovah is engaged
to guide us through life, support us even in the
dark valley of the shadow of death, and finally
land us in the haven of immortal peace.
All things shall work together for good to
those who fear Him. But the question naturally
occurs, Are we his people? and what right
have we to appropriate these promises to our-
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 175
selves ? Surely we cannot be the objects of his
divine compassion and love, when we are suffer-
ing his displeasure, when he is evincing against
us the fierceness of his wrath? Yet beware of
writing bitter things against yourselves, and
tarnishing the lustre of Jehovah's immaculate
purity and boundless compassion ! Have you,
with a deep conviction of your sinfulness and
unworthiness, come to God, and sincerely en-
treated his forgiveness through the blood ofJesus ?
Have you embraced the Lord Jesus Christ as the
only way of salvation, and as your only refuge ?
Have you fled to him, desirous of being washed
in his blood, and made clean from your iniquities?
Do you hate and avoid the practice and indul-
gence of sin ? and do you earnestly implore the
assistance of the Holy Spirit, to enable you to
walk in his ways? Do you, from motives of love
to him, seek after conformity to the image of
your Saviour, and desire to advance his king-
dom, and love his people on earth? Do you
earnestly desire to devote your time and talents,
your all, to his glory ; and though you lament
your daily imperfections, do you breathe after
hohness, and forgetting those things which are
behind, do you strive to press forward toward
the mark, for the prize of our high calling in
Christ Jesus ? Then are you one of his people,
however feeble and glimmering may be your
176 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
faith : and as such you are interested in his care
of his children.
" Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth;
and break forth into singing, O mountains : for
the Lord hath comforted his people, and will
have mercy upon his afflicted. But Zion said,
The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking
child, that she should not have compassion on the
son of her womb ? yea, they may forget, yet will
I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee
upon the palms of my hands ; thy walls are con-
tinually before me."* The Almighty has pro-
mised that nothing shall hurt his children, for he
is the rock of their salvation, and a sure defence
in every time of need. As the mountains are
round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round
about those that fear him, to protect, guide, and
comfort them. He has promised strength equal
to their day, and by his Holy Spirit he supports
the feeble and cheers the distressed.
When God afflicts, he has far higher designs
than simply to exemplify his compassion, his
faithfulness, and his power in supporting under
trials; he wishes his people to wear more of his
image on their hearts, and to have their affections
set on heavenly things. He is well acquainted
* Isa. xlix. 13—16.
UxN THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 177
with the secrets of all hearts : he sees and knows
all that passes in the inmost bosom : nothing is
concealed from his scrutiny. He perceives that
your mind is occupied with earthly things, your
affections fixed inordinately on some beloved ob-
ject. He beholds you planting, nourishing, and
watering, with unremitting care, the gourd under
which you have taken shelter, and in whose shade
you allow your best affections to breathe out all
their fragrance. He sees that all your attentions
are directed to the support of this frail and lovely
flower, and that you lose sight of the kind hand
which gave^ and which has hitherto supported its
existence. You are indeed anxious for its wel-
fare, but you do not look to God alone to bless it,
and bless it to yourself. You are unmindful of
Him to whom you should consecrate the blessing.
The eye of Infinite Goodness perceives how your
thoughts and affections are alienated from him-
self, and solely engaged in the present welfare
of your darling idol. Most kindly then does He
commission disease to blast your gourd, and you
see it wither away and die before you.
And dost thou well to be angry ? Alas ! how
foolish has been your conduct ! You have been
building plans of happiness for many years, on
the creature of a day ; and in one hour, all is cut
down with a stroke. When you were busily en-
gaged in preparing for yourself the cruel recol-
178 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
lection of abused mercies, was it not an instance
of almighty care, that he warned you of danger,
and taught you the insufficiency of any thing but
himself, to confer substantial happiness? He
corrects, that you may deeply feel the sin and
folly of your past conduct, and return unto him
with full purpose of heart. Your earthly com-
forts are removed, in order that your hearts may
be prepared for better and more enduring bless-
ings, and that your souls may be left at liberty
to be engaged about his service.
The Lord God will have all his children to be
burning and shining lights in the world, to show
forth his praise. He has not called them out of
darkness into his marvellous light, in order that
they may extinguish or conceal the light that is
in them, or be like unto the feeble glimmering of
the glow-worm, chiefly visible during the gloomy
night, chained to earth, and destined to illuminate
its own little narrow sphere. But He wills that
the principles of divine grace be nurtured and
expanded into action, that they be wrought into
habits, and exhibited to the praise of the glory of
his grace. He wills that the Christian's light
should teach the way to heaven, and show to
others the beauty of holiness. His should be a
life of constant activity and vigilance : for he has
much to do ; and soon the night cometh, when no
man can work. And he is concerned, not only
ON THE SOURCES OP COiNSOLATloN. 179
that others, seeing his conduct, should glorify
God, but that he himself should be nurtured for
the heavenly world; and that, having been a
light to others, he should at last shine as a star
for ever in the firmament of glory.
Hence, he should be careful of his thoughts,
his feelings, and affections; and anxious that
they may be kept right with God, that the Al-
mighty may be their centre and source. This
cannot be, while he loves excessively any creature
;
and therefore God, in his great mercy, removes
the fondly admired object which absorbs the soul,
steals its richer facuUies from heaven, and hides
them in a vessel of clay. Thus the heart, which
before was engrossed with earthly care, is pre-
pared for the reception of himself, and perfected
for the heavenly glory above.
Is it not consoling, that the conduct of Jehovah
is governed by such gracious designs towards
you ; and that you are entirely in the hands of
one who so intimately knows what is best for
you, and is able to do more and better for you
than you can ask or think ? His object in afflict-
ing you is extensive and permanent. He will^
that you commit yourselves entirely to his guid-
ance and government; and he wishes to induce
that frame of mind, in which you will make a
distinct and entire surrender of yourself to him.
He designs that the chief aim of your life should
1^0 ON THE SOUkCESr OF CONSOLATION*
be to love and serve him ; that his Spirit should
abide in you and assist you in the performance
of his will: that your dispositions, temper, and
frame of mind should be purified and directed
towards Him whom you should supremely love
and regard.
It will be of little avail to contemplate Jehovah's
character as engaged to afford grace and strength
to the sufferer, if we do not pray for devotedness
to him. It is only to the humble, contrite soul
that his blessings are given : and it is not easy
to conceive the tranquillity, peace, and joy arising
from a fixed and entire dedication to his service*
From the heart we desire to be his, and to live to
his glory : we would know no other first principle
of action than love of him : we can no longer be
anxious about our concerns, for we are assured
that all is in his hand, and therefore are we safe.
We would earnestly desire to be more entirely
his, and to love and serve him better. We would
commit our way unto the Lord, and seek to
glorify him with our bodies and with our spirits.
He who inhabiteth eternity will take care of us
:
he asks for our heart, and we will give it him
unreservedly; for then, and then only, shall we
enjoy tranquillity : we shall rejoice in the God of
our salvation, who voluntarily and graciously un-
dertakes to relieve us of every burden, and to
give us peace.
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 181
No tranquillity can be compared with the peace
of God, the calm serenity diffused over the whole
soul, by a reliance on his goodness, and obedience
to his commands. When the paroxysms of grief
recur, when the mind is agitated by the retros-
pect of its lost happiness, and by the contempla-
tion of the fearful evils with which it is environed
;
if the mourner comes to God, and in humble faith
seeks comfort alone from him, he will give it, he
will manifest himself to the soul, so as to fill its
vast desires; he will allay the aching heart and
tranquilUze the troubled bosom, with his cheer-
ing and sustaining presence, and with the bright-
ening prospects of eternity.
The consolations of God are, however, to be
expected only in obedience to his will, and we
must be careful that we do not grieve the Spirit
of God, by murmuring, or calling in question the
righteousness of his proceedings. This, indeed,
would invalidate our claim to comfort ; while, if
we wait upon God in the way of his appointment,
in due time we shall reap, if we faint not. And
we shall reap, not only present comfort and
support from Him who can give us a name and
a place better than of sons or daughters, but
that peace which arises from the hope of our
interest in the pardoning love and favour of
God; that consolation which is founded on Christ
as our Mediator, Intercessor, and Advocate;
16
182 ON THE SOURCES OF COIN'SOLATIOX.
that cordial support which originates from the
influence of the principles of religion ; that calm
and holy joy which owes its birth to the prospects,
the glorious anticipations with which we are
s.urrounded :
" for 1 reckon that these hght afflic-
tions are not worthy to be com})ared with the
glory that shall follow." " For which cause we
faint not ; but though our outward man perish,
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
For our hght affliction, which is but for a mo-
ment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of glory ; while we look not at
the things which are seen : for the things which
are seen are temporal ; but the things which are
not seen are eternal."*
But we rejoice in the end which affliction is
accomplishing in us. It is preparing us to glorify
God, and for an abundant entrance into that rest
which he has provided for those who, through
much tribulation, have washed their robes in the
blood of the Lamb, and now inherit the kingdom.
It is the discipline by which we are taught to
regard God as our chief good. We learn the
frailty of our own nature, the folly of departing
from him, and of resting in any other source of
happiness. It will purify and exalt our graces,
that, thus fitted for breathing the purer atmos-
* 2 Cor. iv. 1G—18.
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 18^
phere of the heavenly world, these themselves
may be the spring of more abundant happmess,
where perfect pleasure dwells.
Afflictions, well sustained, prove a source of
comfort even on earth, from the manifestation
of the glory and grace of God ; while they endure
but for an instant of time, and will soon be
swallowed up in praise, in an exceeding and
eternal weight of glory. While the Christian
thus looks beyond the narrow boundary of mor-
tality, and catches a glimpse of the heavenly
state, he is ready to endure even far more, that
he may win Christ and be found in him. He is
concerned to glorify God, and anxious that his
heart should be elevated above present pains
and sorrows, and fixed on those eternal things,
during our steady regard on which only it is
that we can expect to derive benefit from the
exercise of sorrow. Let us then earnestly look
to God as the author of every affliction, and
derive unfeigned consolation from the recollec-
tion, that, as such. He afflicts in wisdom and
love, that he is engaged to uphold us, that he
chastens us for our good, that he is ever with
us, and prepares us for a residence with himself
in the kingdom of glory.
Consolation is again to be derived from the
nature of the comfort you have lost. At best, it
was a mortal blessing. You could have enjoyed
184 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATIOx\.
it but for a short time longer; and even this
enjoyment would have been intermingled with
many tears of sorrow, which your dearest friend
will now escape ; and w ould have been inter-
rupted and impaired by a thousand troubles and
disquietudes, which will now be avoided. The
blessing you have lost is of a temporal nature,
and you now feel how much you were attached
to it ; how deeply rooted were your affections,
not simply on the object of your fondest hopes,
but ramifying most extensively on this lower
soil. Many points of attachment to the earth
are now cut off; many sources from which you
derived supplies of present pleasure are dried
up; you have fewer attractions to the world,
and your most valued treasures are removed to
heaven : and " where the treasure is, there will
the heart be also." Yes ; your hearts will still
love to follow your beloved relatives, and delight
in anticipating the possession of heavenly /^//aYy.
Thus will you be aiming after conformity to a
dear Redeemer, that you may be with him, and
with his children : and you will not only find
that your spiritual pleasures are undiminished,
but that they are increased. All the imre sources
of present happiness are left untouched, nay,
are purified and enlarged: for, will not your
capacity to love God, your delight in his service,
vour humility, your confidence, your faith, yonr
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 185
hope, be magnified and established, when your
heart is thus raised to another and a better
world ?
Besides, you are feelingly taught the important
lesson, that there is no rest on earth, and that
disquietude and care are ready to mar your
happiest moments. The spirit of your dearest
friend has fled from the uneasiness of a longer
pilgrimage on earth, to a place of safety and of
rest ; has escaped the trials which are necessary
to remind us we have no abiding city here ; and
has for ever bidden adieu to the gloomy cares
with which the imperfection of our nature had
encumbered its path through this world's wide
wilderness. You have sustained the loss of a
beloved object, which too probably was the
means of dividing your heart, and weaning your
affections from God : and thus are you prepared
to receive him with your whole heart, to remem-
ber thy first love, " to remember from whence
thou art fallen, and repent and do thy first work :"
and are excited to "be watchful and strengthen
the things that remain, and are ready to die;"
that when your Lord cometh, you may be found
watching. You have lost a present comfort;
yet a wise and merciful God overrules for good
this afflictive event, and makes it the instrument
of bringing you to enjoy far greater and im-
perishable pleasures.
16*
186 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
But, again, a great source of consolation is
presented to the affectionate heart, in the im-
mediate perfect happiness of him who has been
removed. How inexpressibly joyful must be the
transition! Only conceive of the infinite sur-
prise of the holy, happy, disembodied spirit ;
perhaps suddenly translated from earth to hea-
ven, scarcely even tasting of death, and quickly
winging its flight across the dark and unknown
valley, to realms of everlasting day ; this hour
wandering on earth in perfect health, and, though
surrounded with trials and difficulties, imploring
its Maker for guidance and assistance in keeping
his ways ; the next, sleeping in the bosom of a
compassionate Saviour ; in a moment swept away
from all these vain and transitory scenes, and
introduced to the society of the blessed, with,
" Well done, good and faithful servant ; enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord."
Or conceive of the ravages of disease, slowly
depriving the cheek of its crimson hue of health,
undermining the powers of the constitution, and
impairing the activity of that body which was
lately subservient to the volitions of an active,
intelligent, affectionate, and pious mind. The
animal powers are fast verging to decay, and
ere long, the principle of vitality must be extin-
guished. Yet, even now, the Christian rises
above disease, and though his outward man de-
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 187
cay, his inward strength is renewed day by day
;
he bears an ample testimony to the goodness of
God, and to the supporting influence of the truths
of the Gospel; for he knows in whom he has
believed, and is persuaded that he is able to
keep that which he has committed to him, unto
the last day. Even in the closing scene, though
he may not die triumphant, yet his hopes and
joys are fixed on God, his faith and confidence
in the atoning merits of a Redeemer's sacrifice.
The happy spirit, though it still linger on the
confines of mortality, is pluming its wings to soar
above :
" The nearer still she draws to land,
The more her sacred joys expand
;
With steady helm, and well-bent sail,
Her anchor drops within the vail
!
'
Triumphant now she claps her wings,
And her celestial sonnet sings.
Glory to God !"
Sin has no longer any influence to damp the
joy and interrupt the prospects of the soul.
Faith is exchanged for sight, prayer for praise,
expectation for fruition. There is no darkness
now ; for he sees God, sees him as he is, is
conformed to his image, and filled with his
glory. It is impossible to conceive, much more
depict^ the felicity of the disembodied spirit, at
once freed from all the shackles of mortality,
188 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
and delighting in the service of the Most High :
all its faculties, its powers, and its affections,
centering in him, purified and sublimed, and
exercised on a scale the most comprehensive,
unlimited, and eternal.
Only conceive of the happiest moments you
ever spent on earth with our dear friend now in
heaven; those in which, prostrated before the
throne of God, in social yet private worship,
you joined hands and hearts in mutually sup-
plicating the favour of Jehovah, and the best
blessings of his smiles on your undertakings for
his service. Conceive of that sweetest com-
munion of souls which you have participated;
(how did your hearts burn within you, with love
to God, and to each other !) and the entire ex-
emption you have enjoyed from every jarring
sound. How sweet is the recollection of those
few happy moments ! now infinitely dear to
memory ! Yet, if you endeavour to multiply
these joys with all the powers of your mind, you
will fall incalculably short of the actual blessed-
ness of heaven; for " eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man
to conceive the joys which are reserved for the
people of God."
And this blessedness is eternal : it knows no
change, is the same yesterday, and to-day, and
for ever. Into this joy your friend has entered
;
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 189
and as you loved him on earth with disinterested
affection, are you not consoled by this delightful
prospect ? Nay, do you not rejoice to part with
your own ease, that he may be happy? Is it
not happiness to know that he is " where the
wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are
at rest ?" Yes, it is—you would not wish him
back again ;
you prefer his happiness to your
own, and only desire to follow him : you recollect
his present peace, and are comforted.
God has graciously removed one of his tender
feeble lambs ; has promised to keep it in his
bosom; to cherish it, and restore it to you at his
appointed time. He has taken it away from the
evil to come. Jesus says, " In the world ye
shall have tribulation ; but be of good cheer, I
have overcome the world." In Jesus, too, your
dear friend has been made more than conqueror,
and has escaped the tribulations of a protracted
warfare : he has escaped from his own frailties,
and has exchanged the infirmities of our nature
for glory, honour, and immortality.
Though he be no more seen upon earth,
though his place be vacant in the sanctuary,
though there be none to occupy his useful sta-
tion, and none to fill his domestic relations, yet
he is not lost ; he is not dead, but sleepeth ; he
ever liveth and reigneth with the saints in light.
He dwells not upon earth, but lives in immor-
190 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
tality, in the immediate presence of God, and
the service of the Redeemef. Sorrow is no
longer known to the bhssful inhabitant of a
heavenly world ; sin is for ever banished ; disease
and death are known no more, and can no longer
impair the activity of the soul: the understanding
is not fettered by the cumbrous medium of clay,
through which it receives its exterior notices;
the heart is no longer throbbing with wo, nor
agitated and disturbed by a thousand painful
feelings and conflicting passions, but animated
solely with the love of God ;
" The tears ar« all wiped from those eyes,
And evil they never shall see."
The understanding is enlarged to comprehend
what is the height, and breadth, and length, and
depth of the love of God; the heart is expanded
to feel alone its unbounded influence ; and the
whole soul is fitted and prepared, and all its
powers and faculties are rendered capable of
relishing the joys of the heavenly state, of ador-
ing, loving, serving, and praising God.
Though absent from the body, he is for ever
present with the Lord : he has joined the song of
the redeemed above, and has united in ascribing
praises to the Lamb that was slain. No longer
worn by disease, distressed by afliiction, assailed
by temptation, or haunted by sin, there is full en-
ON THE SOURCES OP CONSOLATION. l^J
joyment for the expauded heart in the worship
of God. He is present with his Redeemer, with
Him who, became a ransom for many, suffered
the wrath of God for the sins of his people, and
gave himself for tiiem, that they through Him
might find acceptance with God—with Him, who
has been his God, his father, and his friend; his
guide through hfe, his support under trials and
distresses, his everlasting portion in the midst of
every changing scene ; his hope, and all-sufficient
Saviour, in the last hour of death—with Him who
has been his joy, and is now become his exceeding
great reward—with Him in whose presence is
fulness of joy, and at whose right hand there are
pleasures for evermore.
From the contemplation of this state of endless
bhss, you are led forward to reflect on the present
perfection of the capacities of the deceased.
With pure and chastened delight, you have loved
and admired the character of your dear friend
while on earth. The mild and varied intelligence
of a well-stored mind ; the meek, disinterested
affection of a heart formed for tenderness, and
moulded by religion ; the benevolence of his dis-
position; his amiable temper; the rectitude of
his principles ; his fear of God, and obedience to
his commands; his delight in his service, and
desire of living to his glory ; the exceUence of his
conduct, and his unremitting exertions to be con-
192 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
stantly doing good to all the poor, needy, afflicted,
and wandering, in his sphere—formed so many
points of attraction, on which you delighted to
dwell with increasing satisfaction. And yet, with
all these excellencies, your dear friend's was not
a perfect character. An impartial recollection of
all he said and did will mark visible imperfection
;
will show that the soul was still militant on earth,
and affected by a variety of external circum-
stances, and these too frequently and too inti-
mately allied to human depravity, though con-
tinually deplored and opposed as the consequence
of indwelling sin»
Contemplate now the state of the souli its
perceptions quickened and enlarged ; its affec-
tions directed to their proper centre ; its faculties
wholly employed in the service of God ; its dispo-
sitions and actions purified and exalted; the
sphere of its sensations changed from earth to
heaven, and their nature now divine, no longer
subject to the inroads of pain and sin : all which
beautified the character on earth, all which made
it estimable, all which constituted it lovely in your
eyes, is rendered absolutely perfect by its trans-
lation to heaven. Conceive, then, of these same
amiable traits still in exercise, with the addition
of inconceivable purity : and do you not feel, that,
although dead, he yet speaks, and thinks, and
feels ? Do you not love him still, for the reasons
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 193
you loved him on earth? Is not your affection
increased by his present holy, happy state? Do
you not find it a source of pleasure, still to love
that which was imperishable, that which was
heavenly about him? and do you not derive a
large fund of consolation from this exercise of
affection? A ray of heavenly joy gilds your soli-
tary hours, and illumines your path through this
dark wilderness ;
guiding you by its chastened
light to the mansions of the blessed.
Yet there is another feature of the present
state of the deceased, which deserves your notice
;
—they sleep in Jesus, Death is frequently repre-
sented as a sleep ; and under this beautiful simi-
litude we are informed that it is only a temporary
cessation of hostility, and of the vital principle,
preparatory to some new state of existence, of
which we can form at best but an inadequate idea.
As, during sleep, the immaterial principle within
us remains still active and vigilant ; so, during
the long night of death, the soul, freed from the
prison of the body, is ever active in its sweet
employment just described. The powers of voir*
tion, and perception of external objects, have
ceased from the body : it is dead, it is now a
nothing, and will soon be removed from our ^ight.
Yet what affectionate heart is there, that does
not delight to linger over the body of his departed
relative ? Memory loves to trace in the affection-

194 ON THE SOURCES OF COx\SOLA'i ION.
ate intelligent smile, which still hovers around
the lips, and which not even death itself can yet
destroy, the delightful peace with which the soul
quitted its tenement of clay, as well as the testi-
mony of endeared affection to surviving relatives,
which indicates that the last thought on earth
was that of love for them^ and anticipated joy on
the very confines of eternity. Who does not de-
light to retrace in imagination, what the expres-
sive eye, sparkling with delight, lately told of all
its feelings, its cares, and joys? or contemplate
that form consecrated by a thousand endeared
recollections, and of which every wonted object
of participated pleasure now seems but as a sad
memento ? Yes ! feeble nature shrinks from the
sad parting even of this lifeless clay : though the
soul be gone, it rejoices to dwell and infuse ima-
ginary activity into each limb and every feature
;
hence the reluctance with which we commit the
body to the narrow cheerless cell appointed for
all the living.
Yet hush the murmuring thought ! Thy dearly
beloved friend only sleeps in Jesus : he is shrouded
in the arms of a Saviour's love, who died and
rose again, that all his followers might. Jesus
watches over the bodies of his saints, and will
keep them until the last great day of retribution.
Our blessed Lord himself tasted of death, though
he could not be subjected by it, and he has per-
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 195
fumed the grave by his presence. Shall we then
fear to commit our dear friend to that tomb where
Jesus lay, and whence he rose triumphant, lead-
ing " captivity captive," and trampling over that
last enemy, even death? " For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
put on immortality. So, when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal
shall have put on immortality, then shall be
brought to pass the saying that is written, Death
is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is
thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory ? The
sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is
the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us
the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ."*
Jesus " is the resurrection and the life." Through
him, that which you now commit to the grave,
shall be raised at the last day, in his image, to
sanctification and honour. Thus your dear friend
will only slumber till the morning of the resur-
rection; " for if we believe that Jesus died and
rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus
will God bring with him, and so shall we ever be
with the Lord.t If in this life only we have hope
in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But
now is Christ risen from the dead, and become
the first fruits of them that slept. For since by
* 1 Cor. XV. 53-^7 1 1 Thess. iv. 14, 17.
196 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
man came death, by man came also the resurrec-
tion of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even
so in Christ shall all be made alive."* And the
glorious change it will undergo, is thus described
in the beautiful, simple, and energetic language
of the Apostle: " It is sown in corruption; it is
raised in incorruption : it is sown in dishonour
;
It is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is
raised in power : it is sown a natural body ; it is
raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body,
and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written,
The first man Adam was made a living soul ; the
last Adam was made a quickening spirit. How-
beit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that
which is natural; and afterward that which is
spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy;
the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is
the earthy, such are they also that are earthy :
and as is the heavenly, such are they also that
are heavenly. And as we have borne the image
of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of
the heavenly."t
This is the glorious prospect revealed through
Christ Jesus, and reserved for those who are
kept by the power of God, through faith unto
salvation. You bid adieu to the body of your
dearest relative, but it is only for a time. It
^ 1 Cor. XV. 19—22. t 1 Cor. xv. 42—48.

i*e mains in its chrysalis state for the appointed
period, and then rises under new forms and
combinations, which indeed we cannot exactly
trace, but infinitely glorious, and like to Christ's
glorified body. In the arms of a kind Saviour
it will rest till the trumpet shall sound, and the
dead shall be raised incorruptible. Thus faith
descries infinite glories as the result of this
apparent disorganization of the animal frame
:
it beholds new scenes breaking upon the as-
tonished view; it commits the keeping of the
body as unto a faithful Creator in well-doing ; it
leaves its earthly all in His hands, who openeth,
and no man shutteth, and shutteth, and no man
openeth.
The Christian looks at death as the prelude
of eternity. *'
Thou fool, that which thou sowest,
is not quickened except it die." In this beautiful
similitude we find even the appearance of death
disarmed of all its terror. The seed is thrown
into the ground ; it is hidden from our sight
;
but by and by we are surprised to see the
tender blade ; it has assumed a new form of
existence; and, though visited by the wintry
blast, though again concealed from our sight by
the hoar frost and the snow, it is preserved, and
prepared, by this long night of comparative in-
activity, for future fertility and beauty. **
We
all do fade as. a leaf;" we pass the summer of
17 *
198 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATIQN,
life, and when visited by the autumnal gale, we
wither, droop, and fall away from our earthly
connexions. But this is not the termination of
existence ; for, as the leaf falls, and undergoes
its change of phytoseptic decay, it is prepared
to assume new forms of existence, and destined
soon again to appear with increased beauty : so
man, when he drops into the grave, is under-
going that change which will prepare him for
existence in a heavenly world. Let us, however,
remember, that as the richness of autumnal
foliage far exceeds the summer's beauty, so
should the evening of life increase in worth, and
evince a greater degree of heavenly-mindedness,
and conformity to the will of God ; so, in ap-
proaching the winter of death, and when the
head is already silvered over with the frost of
age, should the heart exemplify that its inspira-
tions are derived from a heavenly source.
If we consider man as a complicated machine,
admirably fitted for the performance of every
function to which his situation calls him ; or if
we look at him as an intellectual being, and
contemplate the vast resources of liis mind, we
are filled with wonder and admiration. Yet this
is man in the infant state of his existence, as the
creature of mortality, as a rational rather than
as a spiritual being. But go a little forward
:
the cold hand of death pales that cheek whicli
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 199
once glowed with vivacity; the expressive eye
is now sunk in its Hfeless orbit ; the heart, once
the seat of the warmest affections, no longer
beats, no longer flutters with joy or throbs with
anxiety ; the animated intelligence of the coun-
tenance has given place to ceaseless absence of
expression ; the mind no longer dwells there
;
and those active limbs once obedient to that
mind, now are stiff, cold, and inanimate. The
lifeless corpse is soon shrouded, it is placed in
its narrow habitation, and entombed. We see
it no more. But though the Christian cannot
explore the wintry sleep of death, yet he knows
and feels that this last closing scene of existence
is but preparatory to brighter prospects.
The immortal spirit still exists ; and though
the body slumbers in the tomb, yet, when the
night of death is past, it will be raised incor-
ruptible; it will be reunited with its kindred
spirit ; it will be received into heaven ; all the
faculties and affections of the soul will be puri-
fied and enlarged, and its happiness completed.
" Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord:
they rest from all their labours, and their works
do follow them.—May I die the death of the
righteous, and may my latter end be like his!"
Such is the limited nature of our faculties,
that it is not easy to conceive of the jovs of the
heavenly state ; yet that there is such a state of
200 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
happiness, and that it is adapted to the full
expansion of the intellectual powers, has been
revealed to us. Still we are unable to under-
stand its glories, or to form adequate and
correct ideas of half its blessedness : we can but
approximate towards the truth, and must be
contented to know but in part. We are assured,
that it is a rest prepared for the people of God
;
and that its chief employment will consist in
loving him with unwearied alacrity and increas-
ing delight. While we acknowledge the inade-
quacy of our faculties to conceive of this blissful
region, there is no impropriety in contemplating
the happy land to which, I trust, we are hasten-
ing; in following thither, in imagination, the
spirit of our departed relative, and anticipating
the measure of our knowledge there.
Fond affection anxiously inquires if it shall
again see and know the dear object of its joy on
earth : and appears to derive support from this
delightful hope. On what grounds it may be
entertained, will appear from the following ob-
servations. Heaven is a state adapted to the
entire perfection of the intellectual powers; and
these, freed from all impurity and every incum-
brance, will be placed on their proper objects.
These, while man continued in a state of inno-
cence, were such as in their exercise to consti-
tute him happy. By the fall they have become
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 201
debased : and by their alliance with the body,
and the intrusion of sin, their powers are in-
cumbered and weakened, while the objects of
their pursuit are frequently improper. But when
the soul shall have bidden adieu to this vain
gcene, when it shall have ascended to realms of
celestial glory, and the disembodied spirit shall
have been transformed into the image of its
Redeemer ; then all its powers will be enlarged,
and tend, in one uniform current, to the glory of
that Being whose presence constitutes the delight
of the blessed ; it will look back on its past life,
and admire the unsearchable riches of grace and
of divine love : it will be able to comprehend the
reason and the wisdom of the dealings of God,
and will contemplate with delight his long suf-
fering patience, and loving-kindness, and tender
mercies.
Its joys li'ill he derived from the same source
as on earth; only that here we see as through a
glass darkly, while there we shall no longer
live by faith, but sight : we shall no longer
experience the weakness we have felt below,
but shall be enabled to love and praise God with
the whole heart. The exercise of the intellec-
tual functions is not confined to one object, though
they will ultimately teml exclusively to the Su-
preme Being, and finally centre in him. Thus,
unquestionabk, the happiness of heaven will
202 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
be enhanced by participation, by sharing with
others its pleasures and its services. There
too, perhaps, the happy spirit, when disengaged
from the body, busies itself in watching over
those forms to which it was attached on earth
by the tenderest ties : it is probably one of its
cares and joys, in the capacity of a guardian
angel, to watch over and protect the endeared
mortal with whom it was formerly associated in
love as pure, in affection as exalted, as mortality
could reach.
Perhaps we have no direct instance of the
kind in the Sacred Writings : yet it is surely
not unfair to infer, that the same cause which
augments the misery of those who are banished
from the presence of God, will add to the happi-
ness of the blessed : and of these causes, none
are more powerful than perception and reflection.
*' The rich man, being in torments, lift up his
eyes, and beheld x'Vbraham afar off, and Lazarus
in his bosom. And he cried and said. Father
Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus,
that he may dip the tip of his finger in water
and cool my tongue : for I am tormented in this
flame."*
In this emphatic appeal on the part of the
rich man, we may descry a consciousness of the
* Luke xvi. 24.
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 203
felicity of Lazarus, or he could not render him
assistance, and increased power of the under-
standing to discern Abraham and Lazarus ; the
power of reflection on the folly of his own past
conduct, and the exercise of aff*ection for his
brethren, that they might escape his torments.
On the part of Abraham, the great gulf fixed
between him and the rich man, forms an obstacle
to the relief prayed for ; thus certainly admitting
the inference, that although the miserable are
excluded from the kind oflices of angels in hea-
ven, yet that this may not be the case with the
righteous, over whom God has given his angels
charge.
If it be allowed that these were sources of
anguish to the unhappy spirit, and that their
exercise, under different circumstances, might
augment the felicity of the just, it surely will
not be asserted, that these additions of happiness
are denied to the blessed spirit. Hence it is pre-
sumed that the powers of the soul are engaged,
and do derive pleasure from being engaged,
on objects of affection still left behind it on
earth; and, therefore, unless by some subse-
quent change (which is quite inconceivable) these
powers may have been extinguished, there will
be a continuance of their exercise, when the happy
spirits shall be reunited in realms of bhss.
There can be nothing improbable in this suppc-
S04 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
sition, and there appears to be strong ground
for believing its reality : for if the spirit, in it?
present separate state, be allowed to exercise
purified affection towards the relatives it has
left behind, such as, united to the body, would
have been termed social, why may not the same
principles continue in action, and form part of
the happiness of the blest, when reunited around
the throne of God ? Man was created upright,
in the image of God ; by the fall, he lost that
image : but when the spirit returns to God who
gave it, it is made like unto the image of its
Saviour; it resembles, in its purity and prin-
ciples, what it first was, when emanating from
the Deity.
That we shall know and love each othei*
hereafter, as those whom we have known, and
admired, and loved on earth, may be inferred
from the second of Samuel, and the twelfth
chapter ; where David, after the decease of his
beloved child, exclaims with genuine lively faith,
*'
I shall go to him, but he shall not return to
-me." Nor does this allude simply to partaking
the same happiness in heaven ; for if this were
the meaning of the passage, why is the personal
pronoun alone employed ? David might have
said, in confidence of happiness hereafter, I
shall go where he is, but he shall not return to
me ; though, even then, the last clause would
ON THE SeuKCES OP CONSOLATION. 205
seem to designate a personal interview. And
when this is conjoined with the strong expres-
sion, *'
I shall go to /iiV/?," there appears to
remain no doubt that he uttered these words
under the impression that he should have a
personal knowledge of his child in a future
world : and from its connexion with the former
part of the passage, this anticipation seems to
have formed, with David, a principal source of
consolation under his affliction.
This knowledge of each other may be likewise
inferred from Luke ix. 28, et seq. ; where the
Evangelist, in describing the transfiguration of
our Lord upon the mount, observes, that there
talked with him two men, which were Moses
and EUas. ''
And it came to pass, as they de-
parted from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master,
it is good for us to be here : and let us make
three tabernacles ; one for thee, and one for
Moses, and one for Elias : not knowing what he
said." Here Peter, and doubtless also James
and John, knew Moses and Elias; they knew
them, not merely as happy spirits, but individu-
ally. And this proves more than simple know-
ledge ; for, if we recognise each other in a
future world, in addition to the complacency we
must feel towards all the blissful inhabitants of
that heavenly, peaceful region, there can be little
doubt, from a consideration of the preceding
18
206 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
argument, that we shall love each other indi-
vidiially ; that affection entertained on earth will
be elevated, purified, and renewed in a fairer
world of spirits.
The exercise of affection is not that which
pertains solely to our fallen nature, and is super-
induced by it ; but it is a principle of the soul's
action ; it is that which elevates us the nearest
to our great Pattern and Redeemer, which em-
ploys the purest, the most sublimated energies
of the immortal mind. Affection was exercised
in a state of innocence, and it constituted the
greater portion of the happiness of Paradise
;
and that, not from being diffused over all the
works of creation, (for the whole must have
appeared amiable,) but from its being concen-
trated on one object. Nor does it at all appear
that this affection was inimical to the love of
God. Hence, individual affection may exist in
a future life, and flow uniformly from, and be
enhanced by, the affections centering supremely
in God.
A state of innocence is the nearest approach
to a future state of happiness, but still falls far
short of its glories. If, however, we behold
pure affection a source of pleasure in this vain
and transitory scene, and if we then endeavour
to form an adequate conception of the measure
of happiness thus produced in a state of perfect
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 207
purity, we shall irresistibly be led forward an-
other gradation in the scale of bliss ; we shall
cast our eyes on future scenes; when, added to
a state of freedom from guilt, the spirit shall be
relieved from the shackles imposed on it by the
body } and all the affections purified, and their
object exalted, their exercise shall be again
renewed, with an inconceivable accession of
felicity.
This fact appears also from the consideration
of that disciple whom Jesus loved ; and the ex-
ample of our dear Redeemer will not be deemed
one in which the frailties and deformities of
human nature were commixed. This love was
pure, pure as the source from which it flowed.
He who now liveth, and reigneth, and intercedeth
for us, who gave himself a ransom for the sins
of his people, no doubt loved them with an
everlasting, an unchanging love. He who loved
all his disciples, affords us an instance of parti-
cular affection, of pure exalted love, not founded
on the low considerations of mortality, but during
to all eternity. This love we find testified after
his resurrection, and immediately before his
ascension to heaven, his reception to glory : nor
can we then doubt that individual affection may
be exercised by pure intelligences.
Our affections are not changed, but purified,
exalted in their object, and enlarged in their
208 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
capacity. When this corruptible shall have put
on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put
on immortality, then all that is sinful, base,
sordid, and selfish, every impure admixture shall
be taken away, and disinterested benevolence
shall animate the heart. The present capacities
and faculties of the soul are indestructible : and
but that they shall be deprived of every charac-
teristic and distinctive feature which they derive
from the combination of our spiritual and animal
nature, they will remain unchanged. Love with-
out alloy will animate every bosom ; and its great
object will be that gracious, glorious, holy Being,
before whom angels vail their faces, and to
whom they are engaged in ceaseless ascriptions
of praise. Love, will fill the whole soul ; and
those affections which on earth so feebly tended
towards God, will now expand in the ripening
atmospliere of heaven, to the full-blown maturity
of joy and peace.
But will this love to God diminish our affection
for those who bear his image? No; it cannot
destroy, but it will augment, it will render more
intense that love which here we exercised to-
wards his people, and particularly towards some
individuals. We love God more, because the
hindrances to our affection are removed; and
^s our desires here were characterized, though
so imperfectly, by love to Him; so will they
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 209
Still converge to their proper object, and will
become intense, in proportion as their capacity
is increased. The same purifying and exalting
cause which rouses ardent affection towards
God, will equally rekindle love to the happy
beings around us.
Since, then, there is no change in the nature or
tendency of the affections ; but only that those
previously existing on earth, debased by sin, and
chained down to sense, are emancipated and ex-
alted ; it is reasonable to suppose that we shall
exercise similar principles in our intercourse in
heaven. Indeed, when kindred spirits have been
united here below , have participated each other's
hearts, have travelled together in the road to
Zion, have only parted for a short season on the
narrow verge of eternity; when this mutual
affection has had its basis in-iove to God, and
has been iniiuenced by it ; the change which the
disembodied spirit must undergo, in order to
exclude the reaction of such a principle, so con-
sonant with its nature and so agreeable to the
love of God, is absolutely inconceivable.
If the love of God animate our bosoms ; if we
really are the sincere followers of Christ, and
heirs with him of the kingdom and glory ; then
shall we love his people, in so far as tliey resem-
ble their great. Pattern, for his sake wliose image

whose lavYs are written in their lives. We shaM
love the people of God, wherever we meet with
them, in whatever nation, or people, or tongue,
and however divided into sects and parties, for
Him whose name they revere, and to whose cross
they look alone for salvation.
But we may go a step higher. Suppose natural
and Christian affection to have been superadded
to this love to the people of God as such, and that
the most endearing relationship shall have sub-
sisted ; that the Christian's cares, and joys, and
sorrows, shall have been participated ; and that
perfect harmony, and a single mutual desire to
do good, shall have formed the prominent cha-
racter of the union; this is the most engaging
form of that love which animates the heart to-
wards the people of God. There may be then,
modified by circumstances, different degrees of the
same principle in exercise; and this affection will
be more pure and more substantial in proportion
as the union is more and more spiritual. But it
is a spiritual union only, which we shall hereafter
sustain. Let us then look beyond the grave, and
anticipate, that the love which warmed our hearts
here below, shall fill the heart hereafter.
In heaven we shall love God without interrup-
tion ; and that love will necessarily animate us
with affection for others, for the blissful inhabit-
ants of that holy place. But as it is allowed tiiat
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 211
our happiness will be increased by the recollection
of our past difficulties and trials, and of our tran-
sition from a world of care to a world of bliss
;
so it will be granted that we shall experience an
accession of delight, from uniting our praises to
those with whom we have associated : and that
the measure of the happiness we shall derive from
this source, will be in proportion to the nearness
and the spiritual nature of the connexion which
subsisted on earth. Thus will it constitute a
portion of our pleasures, to meet in heaven those
endeared relatives towards whom the greatest
affection was exercised on earth ; the recollection
and reflection on which will heighten our felicity,
and contribute to augment our peace and joy.
We shall experience additional pleasure from
loving and praising God together. Let us enter-
tain exalted ideas of that blissful state ; but let
us appreciate its blessings when we can, and as
they deserve. Participation enhances pleasure
;
and our happiness in the heavenly state will be
increased by the myriads of happy beings around
us ; and still more so, by the safety of those wo
have loved, and esteemed, and delighted in
below, who almost constituted a part of our-
selves. Does not then the hope of the resur-
rection afford most abundant consolation to the
mourner ? Its glorious realities should be con-
stantly before him, and mitigate his sorrows
o
212 ON THE SOURCES OP CONSOLATION.
The present scenes will soon be lost : human
life is but as a shadow, which quickly passes
away; it is a tale which is soon told; it is a
journey, which, although we cannot descry its
termination, we shall soon accomplish, and we
cannot tell how soon. But this we know, that the
brevity of human life will quickly reunite those
whom death divides. At no very distant period,
you will be visited by wan disease, stretched on
the bed of sickness, and finally be no more seen
upon earth. While, however, this delightful
prospect animates and consoles you, remember,
that, though to die and be with Christ is infinite
" gain," yet to abide on earth during his will, is
" far better." Life is the time to serve God, to
show forth his praise, and prepare for eternity
:
and though it may be very lawful to indulge
ardent expectations of your removal from its
cares and sorrows, yet this becomes sinful,
because excessive^ when it renders yon unduly
anxious to depart, even " to be with Christ."
Be assured, that when yoi\ fretfully long to
be delivered from the present scenes of trouble,
you are not fitted to enter into the kingdom of
heaven. You are not entirely willing to do and
to suffer the will of God here, and consequently
are incapable of yielding that perfect obedience
and submission to him, v/hich the society and
happiness of heaven demand. Earnestly chack
OiV THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 213
the first impatient thought ; for this indulged^
may teach you to murmur and repine. Your
great security depends on loving God, and serv-
ing him with your whole soul : thus will you be
preparing for heavenly felicity, and ripening
fast for the kingdom of glory. When, therefore,
you look forward to this glorious change, it must
be with submission to the will of God, and desiring
to know and do every thing within the compass
of your talents to promote his honour, and to
accomplish all the good pleasure of his will.
It is delightful to the Christian, when suffer-
ing affliction, to reflect that very soon all his
sorrows will be soothed, when death is swallowed
up in victory. The approach of this relentless
tyrant is despoiled of terror to him : he knows
that his Redeemer liveth, and that he has con-
quered death : be looks to the last scene of
dissolution as the peaceful avenue leading to
eternal happiness : he welcomes the approach
of his kindest friend, and he sinks into his arms
with calm composure, " in sure and certain hope
of a resurrection unto life eternal."
How kind a Saviour, thus to have spoiled
death of its sting, to have softened all its terrors,
to have rendered its approach desirable ! How
gracious to have removed those nearest friends,
to have left whom would have clouded the last
lingering moments of life ; but who, as they are
214 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
gone before us, now serve to call our affections
to heaven, and to render the prospect of dissolu-
tion most welcome ! Now, indeed, death triumphs
over all your dearest comforts; it has robbed
you of your richest and purest earthly treasure
;
it has laid your hopes in the dust ; has exhibited
the fallacy of your anticipations of immediate
futurity by the removal of him who was your
guide and comfort during the gloomy, darkened
hours you spent on earth. Yet remember that
he exhibited only a borrowed light reflected from
the Sun of Righteousness; and that he is now
gone to illuminate another hemisphere, and to
shine in realms of glory. Soon, very soon, the
day shall break upon you ; the day-star shall
dawn upon your heart, and the Sun of Righteous-
ness shall arise with healing in his wings, give
you peace, and guide you to immortal glory.
Soon you shall triumph over the last enemy
!
Death shall be swallowed up in victory ! Now,
indeed, you are under its influence; but you will
ere long escape its power. Now he causes you
to feel his iron sway; but when he aims the fatal
shaft which is to take you from life, he will find
he has no power but on the body: the spirit will
wing its flight to realms of day : and though the
poor remains of what once was animate may
moulder into dust, yet soon, from the ashes of
this beauteous frame, will arise a more beautiful,
ON THE SOURCES OF GONSOLATION. 215
glorious, and spiritual body ; which, at the last
resurrection, shall be again united to the soul,
and awake triumphant from the chains of death
:
*'for flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incor-
ruption."
This union will take place in a state of purity.
The soul will be perfected, its perceptions ren-
dered acute, and its capacities enlarged to taste
its fulness of joy. No care, no sorrow, no per-
plexity will have admission there ; there will be
no difference of opinion, no necessity for the
exercise of forbearance, no indulgence of de-
praved principles, no sin, no unbelief, no coldness
of affection towards God ; but all will be love
!
No longer disturbed by trials and solicitudes, we
shall " rest unmolested" in the bosom of our
God and Saviour.
This happiness will be as everlasting as it is
perfect. It will endure to all eternity; and
when countless years shall have passed away,
when the power of numbers shall, by the utmost
stretch of finite capacity, be exhausted, eternity
will be but begun. There will be no interrup-
tion of blessedness, for every possible cause of
infelicity will be remov^ed. There will be no
more parting. A thousand accidents on earth,
prevent the enjoyment of friendship's balm, se-
parate those whose hearts are united, and cir-

€umscribe the exercise of the affections. There
€very conceivable facility will be afforded to
the eternal growth of celestial love ; love, ever
on the increase; adding to the solid pleasures
of the inhabitants of heaven, and filling up the
unlimited measure of their pure and peaceful
hoars. There will be no death there ; noic the
cause of our severest wo, but, as we shall then
see, only the friendly harbinger of everlasting
joy. From this last enemy we shall then be
free, and happy in the knowledge that nothing
can invade our peace.
Whilst on earth, if a transient gleam of joy
flit across our lives, it is embittered by the im-
mediate prospect of succeeding wo, and the
extreme uncertainty attending the continuance
of our enjoyments. We can never be free from
pain in possession or anticipated reversion. But
there we shall have no present thought but love,
no prospect but of inviolable security. Sheltered
from every storm, we shall repose under the tree
of life, and hymn the praises of the Lamb, say-
ing, " Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to
receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing."
There shall we be " before tlie throne of God,
and serve him day and night in his temple ; and
He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among
them. They shall hunger no more, neither
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 217
shall they thirst any more; neither shall the
sun light on them, nor any heat. For the
Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall
feed them, and shall lead them unto living
fountains of waters ; and God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes."
With these glorious prospects opening upon
his inquiring view, the Christian will be consoled,
the mourner will be comforted and upheld, he
will no longer contemplate the pallid lifeless
corpse as the last dull remains of all his happi-
ness : he will no longer confine his view to the
grave, which will soon shroud even this beloved
relic from his sight : but he will look forward to
the infinite joys which are beyond his ken, and
far exceed his utmost conceptions. He will fix
his eyes on those glories which are now in the
possession of his departed relative. He will no
longer dwell with sad remembrance on the ago-
nizing scenes which were the precursors and the
immediate consequences of dissolution : but he
will follow the happy spirit to heaven, where it
is adorned w ith an imperishable crown of eternal
life and glory ; an inheritance incorruptible, un-
defiled, and which fadeth not away. He looks
at the deceased as now, more than ever, the
object of his affection, because more beautiful
and excellent ; he recollects with unspeakable
joy, that all his happiness is derived from an un-
19
218 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
changing fountain of peace from God alone, and
from the fruition of his immediate presence and
blessing. To him, every source of uneasiness
has failed ; the heart has been lightened of every
sorrow ; every anxiety has been removed ; not a
single wish unfulfilled, not a want unsuppHed,
not a fear remaining ; every imperfection has been
entirely done away ; and every affection perfected
to love and serve God, to know and do his will,
to live to his praise. The mourner will no longer
delight to dwell with mortality ; but, as his affec-
tions will be fixed on heaven, he will be prepar-
ing for an abundant entrance into the kingdom
of his Father. He will familiarize himself with
death ; will seek to welcome its approach, and
desire so to live, that he may die in the arms of
his Saviour. He will labour more earnestly after
a well-grounded hope of his salvation : and though
he may, through fear of death, be subject to
bondage ; though he may dread the last struggle,
yet he places all his hope on God alone, and
trusts in him for support, who alone can give it
;
for, when the flesh and heart shall fail, God shall
be his support and stay, and his portion for
eYer.
And after all wc have done, we fall infinitely
short in our conceptions of the glory and the
happiness of heaven. We are passing through
Immanuel's land to mansions in the sky: and if.
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 219
with faith in Uvely exercise, we occasionally catch
a distant glimpse of the joys prepared for us, still
our vision is obscured, we see nothing distinctly,
and our most fervent anticipations fall far short
of the reahty. We perceive, indeed, enough to
engage our attention, and awaken our love and
desire. Yet, when we are walking through the
dark valley of the shadow of death, perhaps our
prospects partake of the gloom with which we
are surrounded, and we can scarcely appreciate
the excellent glory to be revealed in us. Soon, the
night of dissolution will pass away ; we are ^Imost
landing on the blissful shores of eternity ; we
shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the
people of God ; and we shall find ever new and
increasing objects of delight crowd upon us, and
fill us with admiration and joy ten thousand
times greater than we could have conceived.
May we prepare for that rest! and may Jesus
put underneath us his everlasting arms, enable
us now to realize its glories, and finally bring us
to possess its unfading felicities !
It is the surest wisdom to lay the foundation
of our consolation in God, with whom we can
only become intimately acquainted by perusing
the revelation of his will. Hence the afflicted
will come to this source of solid comfort, and will
earnestly and humbly seek that the Spirit of
Grace may apply its consoling promises, its
320 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
simple precepts, and its glorious prospects to his
heart, and lead him into the way everlasting.
Those who love God, who walk in his fear, who
are partakers of his salvation, may lay claim to,
and in due time will possess, comfort of which
the stranger must be ignorant. They will enjoy
peace and tranquillity ; they will yield themselves
up to God ; and in so doing, they will prefer an
humble claim to the infinite blessings which he
has in store for those who are his people. As
obedient children, they will be cherished, support-
ed, and comforted : they will enjoy the presence
of God, and some sweet anticipations of glory,
which will allay their fears, quiet their griefs,
supply them with an antidote to impatience, fill
their hearts with love to God, and give them
such a measure of joy and peace in believing in
Christ Jesus, as will more than compensate
their loss.
With this view the Christian mourner will
eagerly consult his Bible, and desire that its
spirit may be infused into his heart and life*
He will find instruction suited to his case in
almost every page ; and if he be anxious to pro-
fit, he will not labour in vain. Its promises to
the aflliicted will prominently attract his notice.
Here he will be encouraged, by the tender care
of Jehovah for his sorrowing children, by the
kind support he engages to aflford, and by the
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 221
inestimable benefits with which he covenants to
crown those who wait for his blessing : promises,
evincing the tender mercy and loving-kindness of
God, fitted for eveivy changing scene, and adapted
to comfort and support under the most painful
circumstances. Yet he will remember that these
promises are made only to those who obey God,
and keep his commandments ; he will be careful
not to appropriate them to himself, unless he
can trace an unfeigned desire to yield up the
whole heart to him, whose it is, and who demands
its homage. He will studiously examine the pre-
ceptive parts of Holy Writ, and desire that his
feelings and his conduct may correspond with
its principles. He will equally delight in those
passages which demand the submission of the
heart, as in those which bind up the broken-
hearted, and proclaim peace and security to the
wretched. He will be equally comforted by
obedience to his heavenly Father, as by appro-
priating the supports which he has afforded. He
will not take a partial view of the revealed will
of God ; for he will be anxious not to mistake on
a subject so important, nor lose the benefit
arising from his sufferings. He will desire, first,
conformity to the spirit, and tone, and temper of
the Bible, and then will anxiously wait, expect,
and plead for peace and comfort.
A few passaires of Sacred Writ are subjoined.

with the view principally of rousing the mourner
to inquire and diligently to search the Scriptures.
*'
But when they in their trouble did turn unto
the Lord God of Israel, and sought him, he was
found of them. Although afflictien cometh not
forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out
of the ground ;
yet man is born unto trouble, as
the sparks fly upward. Man that is born of a
woman is of few days, and full of trouble. They
cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and
he heareth the cry of the afflicted. When he
giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?
and when he hideth his face, who then can
behold him ? whether it be done against a nation,
or against a man only. Behold, happy is the
man whom God correctcth: therefore despise
not thou the chastening of the Almighty : for he
maketh sore, and bindeth up : he woundeth, and
his hands make whole. He shall deliver thee
in six troubles : yea, in seven there shall no evil
touch thee. If, when evil cometh upon us, as the
sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we
stand before this house, and in thy presence,
(for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto
thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and
help. And when he was in affliction, he be-
sought the Lord his God, and humbled himself
greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed
unto him: and he was entreated of him, and

heard his supphcation, and brought him again
to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh
knew that the Lord he was God. And he shall
judge the world in righteousness, he shall mi-
nister judgment to the people in uprightness.
The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed,
a refuge in times of trouble. And they that
know thy name will put their trust in thee : for
thou. Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek
thee. For this shall every one that is godly pray
unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found
:
surely in the floods of great waters they shall not
come nigh unto him. Thou art my hiding-place
;
thou shalt preserve me from trouble ; thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way
which thou shalt go : I will guide thee with mine
eye. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked ; but
he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass
him about. But the salvation of the righteous
is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time
of trouble. And the Lord shall help them, and
deliver them : he shall deliver them from the
wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
Blessed is he that considereth the poor : the Lord
w^ill deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord
will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing
:
thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. For
in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his
224 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION,
pavilion ; in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock. God is
our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble. Then they cried unto the Lord in their
trouble, and he delivered them out of their dis-
tresses. He forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou vt^ilt
revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thy hand
against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me. I know that the Lord will
maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right
of the poor. This is my comfort in my affliction
:
for thy word hath quickened me. Before I was
afflicted I went astray : but now have I kept thy
word. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are
right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted
me. Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be
for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy
servant. And it shall come to pass in the day
that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sor-
row, and from thy fear, and from the hard
bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, &c.
And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and
co.me to Zion with songs and everlasting joy
upon their heads : they shall obtain joy and
gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away. Behold, I have refined thee, but not with
silver; 1 have chosen thee in the furnace of
affliction. Sing, O heavens ; and be joyful, O
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 225
earth; and break forth into singing, O moun-
tains : for the Lord hath comforted his people,
and will have mercy upon his afflicted. Who
is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth
the voice of his servant, that v*^alketh in dark-
ness, and hath no light ? let him trust in the
name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. In
all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel
of his presence saved them: in his love and
in his pity lie redeemed them ; and he bare
them, and carried them all the days of old. But
though he cause grief, yet will he have com-
passion according to the multitude of his mercies.
In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her
that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven
out, and her that I have afflicted ; and I will
make her that halted a remnant, and her that
was cast far off a strong nation : and the Lord
shall reign over them in Mount Zion from hence-
forth, even for ever. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the
world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful,
but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. But
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,
concerning them which are asleep, that ye
sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the
people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin

for a season : for he had respect unto the re-
compence of the reward. Is any among you
afflicted? let him pray. Humble yourselves in
the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under
his wings shalt thou trust : his truth shall be thy
shield and buckler. I know the thoughts that I
think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of
peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected
end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall
go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto
you. And ye shall seek me, and find me. The
righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them, and
delivereth them out of all their troubles. How
excellent is thy loving-kindness, O God ! there-
fore the children of men put their trust under
the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abun-
dantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
and thou shalt make them drink of the rivers of
thy pleasure. Hold thou me up, and I shall be
safe : and I will have respect unto thy statutes
continually. If ye endure chastening, God
dealeth with you as with sons : for what son is
he whom the father chasteneth not ? In return-
ing and rest shall ye be saved ; in quietness and
confidence shall be your strength. In the fear
of the Lord is strong confidence. For I the
Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, and thou

ahalt rejoice in the Lord, and shalt glory in the
Holy One of Israel."*
But once more—prayer is a source of conso-
lation, and the best support under every sorrow.
The surest way to obtain peace of mind, is to
come to God, the never-failing fountain of hap-
piness, and to entreat it of him. Prayer is the
medium of communication between the soul and
its God, between earth and heaven: and it
serves at once to purify the desires, enlarge the
understanding, and exalt the alFections ; while it
ensures a rich supply of blessing from above.
This is a source of comfort, which can never be
taken from us. We may always pray. And
we shall find that we are able to derive strength
and support from this exercise, when we are
incapable of appreciating the value of other
sources of consolation.
When our hearts are overwhelmed with grief,
when the anguish of our souls is too grievous to
be borne, and we are almost ready to curse the
day of our bii'th ; when our minds are restless,

and disturbed by embittered retrospects, and
fearful gloomy prospects ; when anxiety sweeps
away every other barrier that would oppose its
progress, and we are left destitute of earthly
hope, in the most trying, agitating moments,
God is with us, and he can give us peace. To
Him then we can go, and seeking his support
and blessing, in confessing our sins and en*-
treating their pardon through Christ Jesus, in
devoting ourselves entirely to him and submit-
ting our will to his, in holding communion with
the Father of our spirits and reviewing the gen-
tleness, kindness, and necessity of his dealings
with us, in prayer and praise to him we shall
obtain peace. The ray of divine light which
emanates from the throne of omniscient love, in
passing to the uplifted eye of humble confidence,
though it may be refracted by the tear of sorrow,
or dimmed by the morbid hue of despair, yet
forms its characteristic image on the mind, and
gradually leads the aching heart to composure
and dependence upon God, to a quiet submission
to his dispensations.
The exercise of prayer has an amazing in-
fluence in composing the agitated bosom. The
heart which now throbs with the tumultuous
heaving of a sorrow which knows no alleviation,
will presently become calm ; it will look to God,
and exclaim, " Thou demandest the heart, and
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 229
mine thou shalt have, O Lord." Prayer hushes
to repose the contending passions of humanity.
The fear of God, the tenderest love for lost
relatives, the deepest sorrow, serve to lead the
mind to a compassionate Father, Saviour, and
Shepherd, rather than divert it from him. The
aifections, instead of wandering over the dear
lost objects of creature attachment, and fixing
on every agonizing circumstance, are led simply
to the Deity, and rest in his goodness and infinite
love, rather than on any thing short of an object
so supremely glorious.
Prayer contributes in a great degree to raise
the soul from earth, to engage the mind in
spiritual pursuits, and by repeated exereise to
strengthen faith and love in a crucified Re-
deemer, and to elevate our hopes and prospects
to the salvation he has accomplished, and the
blessings he has promised to those who follow
him through evil and good report. Let us then
come boldly to a throne of grace, that we may
be strengthened and find grace to help in every
time of need. Whatever we require for our
daily exigencies, and whatever extraordinary
comforts our situation demands, are all treasured
up in God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ ; and
are communicated to us in answer to fervent
prayer, since for all these things will God be
inquired of by the house of Israel. It is by
20
230 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
prayer that we hold communion with God, and
prefer our humble claim to the consolations of
his grace ; that we gain immediate access to the
Father, and are enabled to plead the fulfilment
of his gracious promises in our peculiar cir-
cumstances. And farther, when, in approaching
God, we lay open our whole souls at the foot-
stool of his mercy; when we cast our burdens
upon the Lord, and confess all our troubles to
Him who is infinitely able and willing to advance
our best interests ; we feel peculiar composure
from the assurance that he is entirely acquainted
with our necessities, that he watches over our
concerns with tender care, that he is able to
succour, and will enable us to bear every trial
;
that he will purify us, accept us, and grant us
his reviving presence.
When we thus approach God, as our last and
only refuge, we are earnestly concerned that
our hearts may be animated with a fervent
desire of seeking, loving, and worshipping him;
that no unsanctified wish may present itself to
our minds, in opposition to his will ; that we
may entertain the conviction, that all our com-
forts are derived from him, and that our hearts
may be animated with lively gratitude towards
him. Thus we are kept active, are constantly
reminded of our duty, and find that in serving
God there is great delight.
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 231
It is, however, necessary that the heart should
be warmed with a sense of its own immediate
interest in the blessing it asks for; and that it
should entertain exalted views of Jehovah's cha-
racter as the father and the friend of his people:
for, without some confidence in his goodness,
some hope in his favour, the mind will be occu-
pied by a thousand cares, which will disturb its
attention, divert its views from heaven to earth,
and fix its thoughts on self, rather than on its
Creator and Preserver. This consideration will
prevent our praying but v/ith submission to the
appointments of Omnipotence; and will fill us
with a deep sense of our own ignorance and in-
digence, accompanied with a conviction that our
sufficiency is of God alone, a genuine confession
of our sinfulness, and humble, earnest petition
for pardon and acceptance.
Prayer under affliction is a peculiar duty,
and an evidence of our desire of living entirely
to the glory of God. To the sincere exercise
of this duty is annexed a promise of infinite and
eternal good. "Call upon me in the day of
trouble. I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me. Ask, and it shall be given you:
seek, and ye shall find : knock, and it shall be
opened unto you. He will fulfil the desire of
them that fear him."*
*Psa. I. 15. Matt. vii. 7. Psa. cxlv. 19.
232 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
In our approaches to the throne of God, we
are encouraged by the promise of his Spirit, who
teacheth us how to pray, who. intercedeth for iis
with groanings which cannot be uttered; and by
the permission to present our petitions in the
name and for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord,
whom God hath given to be our Mediator, Ad-
vocate, and Intercessor ; through whom, as our
High Priest, we have access to God within the
vail ; w ho sprinkles our services with his atoning
blood, and will finally present us without spot
or wrinkle, before the throne of his glory, with
exceeding joy.
Again : when we present our petitions to God,
and approach him with the sacrifice of praise
and thanksgiving, we acknowledge our entire
dependence upon him, and we commit ourselves
and our concerns entirely to his guidance, dis-
posal, and government. " In every thing, by
" prayer and supplication, let your requests be
made known unto God." In so doing, the mind
acquires confidence in his goodness, while at the
same time it is relieved from the cares and per-
plexities of arranging its own concerns. The
mourner leaves himself in the arms of an all-
wise and compassionate Saviour, and is happy.
He enters into his closet in the dark season of
afl[liction, and having shut the door, he prays to
his heavenly Father which is in secretj assured
ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. 233
that his Father which seeth in secret, will reward
him openly.
Prayer teaches us submission. We pray ta
be enabled to yield ourselves to his will ; that he
would govern us in the way most conducive to
Jiis glory and our own everlasting good; that
our hearts and minds may be renewed ; that we
may know no other desire than that of acquies-
cence in his disposal ; that we may be led by his
Spirit, to do whatever he enjoins, and carefully
to avoid whatever he disapproves; that we may
be reheved from excessive care about our pre_
sent welfare, and be brought to wait patiently
upon God, for the infinitely superior blessings,
he has to bestow.
To those who humbly wait upon him, will God
grant abundance in poverty, and consolation in
the deepest affliction. For, though our friends
and dearest comforts are snatched away by
death, yet God will not forsake us : he will not
despise the cry of the humble, contrite spirit, nor
disappoint his prayer. He will draw us to
himself, and will amply compensate the loss we
have sustained in others, since he comprehends
in himself every blessing ; since he sustains to
his people the most endearing relations, and will
reveal to us the gracious wisdom of his designs,
at that day when his kingdom will be fully
manifested. Thus, in waiting upon God, there
234 ON THE SOURCES OF CONSOLATION.
is great reward, and in communion with him
there is abundant consolation, and a good hope,
through grace, of an eternal inheritance with the
saints in light. Thus has a wise and gracious
Father provided the richest consolations for his
suffering children, to support them in their dark-
est hour, and to enable them to rejoice with joy
unspeakable and full of glory, as they approach
nearer the termination of their pilgrimage.
Thus is the name of the Lord a strong tower,
into which the righteous runneth and is safe.
And now, my dear friend, having completed
my design, and with the earnest prayer that the
Author of benevolence would smile on this
humble attempt, .
*' I commend you to God,
and to the word of his grace, which is able to
build you up, and to give you an inheritance
among all them which are sanctified. And now
unto Him that is able to keep you from falling,
and to present you faultless before the presence
of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise
God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion
and power, both now and ever. Amen."*
