There were no clouds I could see one hundred fifty yards full circle all the way around me.

I remember helping an old man sit down under a tree in the grass and I was talking to him. We talked for a while, but I don’t remember what we talked about. I looked toward the ambulance and said that I have to help them get that body in the ambulance. I didn't know it was my body. 

I remember once in the ambulance it was moving and rocking and I had a hard time laying back down.

I woke up at hospital asking where I was and what happened, I was knocked out for four hours.
