you
I think they&#39;ve backtracked for six
months so whoever took it not only do
they take on our circulation but they
won in the database and they erased and
I&#39;m serious about this
I enlisted Marine Corps are the under
the delayed Entry Program in July of
1994 and I graduated Mount Tabor high
school and went to Salem North Carolina
on in June of 1995 and I enlisted of
course you know delayed entry a year so
I went to boot camp on the 18th of June
the Sunday I went to boot camp I
graduated 8th September of 95 and from
there my MOS was Oh 311 which was a
grunt and from there I went to school of
infantry training at Camp Geiger you
know in late September of 95 I did not
complete training because I was injured
and I hurt my back and I was sent to the
medical butene there on Camp Geiger
North Carolina which is adjacent to a
campus Union and I was there I don&#39;t
need it for about a month or two months
and in January January late January of
96 I was given new orders and given a
new MOS military occupational skill
listing a 70 t12 stinger Avenger gunner
and subsequently given 10 days leave and
then sent to Fort Bliss in El Paso Texas
so I was in training for to be a air
defense gunner on the fim 1992 alpha
Stinger missile it&#39;s a service tier
missile and the Avenger weapon system
which is a pedestal or a turret with
what eight stingers are mounted on the
back of a Humvee and I was in training
for February to light May of 96 and I
after graduated from that school I was
reassigned my first duty station a
second Marine Air Wing 28th marine air
control group ii little altitude air
defense battalion Cherry Point North
Carolina with and I was assigned a
battery B then in June of that 96 and I
went on several ops the operations we
call them ops for short and basically I
was there and then I was transferred
over to the section for laser strike in
February of
seven after going to weapons attack his
instructor 197 and you may resume when I
got back I was asked if I wanted to go
and I said sure so I&#39;ll volunteer and I
was send to the section then we shipped
out and me all excuse me of March excuse
me of that that year we were sent there
to provide perimeter security to this
radar installation basically these radar
station was tracking supposedly drug
aircraft that were exiting in and out of
Peru and Bolivia airspace basically what
we were doing there you know we had live
ammo and weapons and one day sergeant
Alan and and
the other the other sergeant and I
remember his name seemed certain Adkins
they were and sergeant Almonte Alegre
and he he was he was a staff sergeant
east seven I mean excuse me six the
other guys hurry five sergeant and they
came to us and said look you know we got
we got a situation where we we have an
aircraft crash that&#39;s possibly friendly
and they need us to go and secure the
crash site and we&#39;re like fine say it
well this is the row this is late at
night I&#39;m at about 11 or 12 at night I
was on guard duty that night so I was
already up and it was my shift we have
12 hour shifts 12 on 12 off and where we
where we rotate our section so we all
went out that night we got up on a three
or four of the morning and headed out
and Humvees we had about five or six
Hummers and we drove to where we needed
to go and then we from there you know we
had to hump through the bush so we got
there out on there six seven just just
one daylight had just started to get
light and well we found the area really
easy because there was a there was a
huge gash in the land were or something
in crashed and it didn&#39;t break anything
you know you know I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve
ever been to a crash site where they had
you know a trees you know just broken
like Mike and half everything was burned
and it was like like if you had
cut like a warm butter with a knife I
mean it was just it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s
like something on fire or had entered or
some kind of energy and like a laser or
mousse it had like gutted I mean it was
really strange and anyway I was I was in
the front with Serge now and in certain
tactics we were up front and we were we
were point basically and we were like I
don&#39;t know 10 20 meters ahead of
everyone else we had we all had maps and
radios and compasses so we knew so we
wouldn&#39;t get lost and basically we were
the first ones to see the object and
basically what happened is we didn&#39;t go
straight up the hill because basically
this thing went up the hill and then off
into the side of the ravine of the ridge
this is about a 200-foot ridge at least
solid granite I mean is rock I don&#39;t
know if it&#39;s green it was buried in the
side of the cliff but anyway we didn&#39;t
go straight up we went to the - all on
to the left and walked up to the top of
the ridge that&#39;s when we saw the craft
this is a huge ship and you know I used
to be in the sci-fi movies when I was a
kid but this is nothing like I&#39;ve ever
seen and when I first saw it you know I
was scared it scared the end of the heck
out of me you know I didn&#39;t know what to
do and and it was just I was really it
was really confusing so we I went we all
climbed down and it was it was very for
about a 45 degree angle and to the side
of the end of this end of the side of
the cliff there the the ridge and I mean
this is steep cliff I mean it&#39;s straight
up and down and it was dripping this
CERP like like certain viscosity this
liquid it was everywhere all down
everywhere when we went down there
because there were plants and everything
it was it was weird it was a purplish
green color and it was it was a greenish
purple and it kind of like like
fluctuated like you couldn&#39;t really when
you&#39;d look at it one time then you look
at again and it would like it&#39;s almost
like I don&#39;t know if it was like a lava
it was just changing but every time you
looked at it you saw a different shade
of green as purple as the strange there
was a there was one light on it that
slowly went around and in the
she and I could hear it I could hear I
guess because it was still functioning
and it had like a like a hum to it like
like a really bass like say if you
unplugged an amp from a guitar that kind
of mmm you know it was really really you
know it was really deep and it kind of
fluctuated and then and finally he just
cut off and everything just seemed to
stop except the colors and the shades
and it was still that way when I was
looking at the craft it was buried so I
could see the back of it and there were
these large events well they look like
Vince sort of like a fish Gill on the
back I couldn&#39;t see around the other
side
and I guess I&#39;m assuming it was the same
way on the other side that looked like I
don&#39;t know that they could that could
have been used for propulsion I&#39;m not
sure again this this liquid that had
come out of the ship was it got all my
camis and you know it it discolored them
and ate them almost like acid then ate
some of the skin all of those excuse me
the the hair off my arms and it was and
I didn&#39;t know that until later on but
basically when I was down there with the
ship
there was three holes I guess I&#39;d have
seemed that they were hatches but I
there&#39;s no way to tell they were not
flush with the with with the body the
main body of the craft there I don&#39;t
know a few inches below I knew there was
one on top because you could slightly
see it I don&#39;t know about the other side
but there was another hatch the same
same width in diameter or whatever of
the top hats and it was kind of crooked
to the side and it was half open and I
didn&#39;t see any lights or anything coming
out of it but I felt this presence that
it&#39;s real strange I guess it was almost
like I think the create I told Leslie is
I thought the creatures were they calmed
me and it was like weird and they were I
think they were trying to communicate
with me like I guess telepathically it&#39;s
really weird and I don&#39;t believe in it
and any of that stuff but anyway it was
I could I could hear like and it was
terrible because it kept going and it
still comes and goes it&#39;s like basically
sitting in your car and turn on like a
a.m. station that&#39;s not that you know
it&#39;s just white noise and it&#39;s turning
really high
and that&#39;s what I heard when I when I
first got in there this is pretty crude
two-dimensional drawing but this is
jungle here
this was the craft and it was embedded
in in the rock like this and I I&#39;m not
sure if this tapered off or how it went
but these right here are the hatches
these two objects here this one was the
one that was half open and you could see
into it but I mean it was just black it
was like looking into a closet 10 meters
and width and about 20 meters in length
I&#39;m just not sure that&#39;s just an
estimate from what I remember but it was
huge I mean it was big man and it was
shaped like almost like between an egg
and like a teardrop on this it was
really look really aerodynamic at least
in the shade but the closer I was close
enough to take out detail on it that
ever it was not just smooth that was
there was you know there was bumps and
you know notches and things in it it was
really organic it was almost like art
that&#39;s really how you would and it
looked like something that somebody made
in a shop you know it didn&#39;t have that
clunkiness or that that that tin can you
know kind of deal it was more of a it
was more of art I would I would say look
to be that it was it could have been
handmade but you know out of what and
what materials and on there definitely
nothing nothing like it had nothing like
titanium it wasn&#39;t it see this is the
whole thing it looked metal but it
didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t have any reflection on
it man I mean you know that the sun&#39;s
coming down and if you got something me
and a metal regardless of it I mean
maybe if it&#39;s subdued with paint and
it&#39;s got a cami shame on it you know
you&#39;re not gonna see in a reflection but
you know I could see the different the
different shades of the craft they
didn&#39;t shine it just like it was it
didn&#39;t reflect anything and and I
guarantee if I die fine I feel like a
flashlight on I wouldn&#39;t reflected it
what the creatures I think we&#39;re calling
me to help them everything was going to
be all right then I was so mesmerized
and into it and you know Sargent Allen
and Adkins are they&#39;re hollering their
cousin and you know get the hell out of
there well I think they why&#39;d they I
think that they were scared and they
didn&#39;t want me to get hurt I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t know they were all pissed off at
me after subsequently but basically what
happened was uh after we climbed back up
the I think the do a Department of
Energy people were there they knew about
it and I don&#39;t know why we went there
still of this date but anyway I was
arrested I had all my gear taken from me
by men and black hammies had new new
name tags they they were older men
probably in their 30s or 40s
how long was I at the site probably
about 15 20 minutes we were the first
people in position Yeah right there were
other people I guess they were
government I don&#39;t know they were there
and they had containment suits and they
they had guys they they had a position
that that that was that looked like I
don&#39;t know if it was already there or
there was some gap in the jungle where
they landed to ch-47 Chinook s-- their
army taught twin-rotor you know
helicopters and they&#39;re big and they had
guys coming out on these containment
suits they must have just got there I
don&#39;t know while we were down in the
gorge because when we climbed up there
those guys were in that well there were
the guys and the black camis and then
they took me they put me on a cot that
they had and they had me cuffed with
those left they had me cuffed both hands
down and then they had my my legs tied
together with those there&#39;s plastic
fasteners at the police use I don&#39;t you
know they&#39;re like kind of like cuffs and
then they took me in the siege 47 and
they they they sent me to we took off
and and and they they didn&#39;t drug me or
anything like that and I was just awake
there and know that they said that you
know that I was they were cussing at me
and saying that I was a dumb [ __ ] or
that why don&#39;t you why don&#39;t you [ __ ]
people ever
pay attention to orders and you wasn&#39;t
supposed to be there and you&#39;re not
supposed to see this and you know you&#39;re
gonna be dangerous if we let you go and
all this stuff and you know I mean I
thought was gone I thought they were
gonna kill me for about two days I think
and they had a tenant colonel from the
Air Force and he did not identify
himself he might have I just don&#39;t
remember and he told me you know you
know you know if we just took you out in
the jungle you know they&#39;d never find
you out there and I&#39;m like long and you
know I didn&#39;t want to say you know you
know I didn&#39;t want to test him to see if
you&#39;d really do that sussing yeah he&#39;s
like you gotta sign these papers and you
never saw this and I don&#39;t exist and
this situation never happened and if you
tell anybody you know you&#39;ll just come
up missing and he was a real abrasive
just just just a cynical [ __ ] I guess
the best way to put it it was I was at
the same installation but they had me
segregated with Air Force personnel for
like three weeks and then after that I
was sent back approximately oh I saw
there was Americans and there&#39;s a lot of
other nationalities there Chinese
Germans I think were there and I mean a
lot of other people were at this other
base but I mean this thing it was really
I mean I didn&#39;t go in and all they did
was take me to like I liked us you
couldn&#39;t call it a cell was more of like
it was more like an interrogation room
and I sat in their front on their 15
hours of those guys with a light I mean
they put this light in my face and they
were yelling at me and I couldn&#39;t really
readily identify any of these guys but I
knew I knew that I knew one of them was
at the crash site because they were one
of the guys that I recognized cuz he was
in black fatigues and he was like what&#39;d
you see and he&#39;s like yeah he&#39;s like
growling mmm you know he goes are you a
patriot you like the Constitution I&#39;m
like yeah and he&#39;s like well we don&#39;t we
do it we know we&#39;re on our own program
you know we don&#39;t obey we just do what
we want he&#39;s like yeah and they&#39;re like
but they&#39;re growling and they&#39;re rushing
you know and they&#39;re yelling at me and
they&#39;re they&#39;re hollering and cursing
and you didn&#39;t see anything you know and
we&#39;ll do you and your whole goddamn
family and they&#39;re there you know it was
it was basically that for about eight or
nine hours I mean they took breaks they
were like look
and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna
just we&#39;re gonna take you off in the
helicopters kick your ass out out out in
the jungle and you&#39;re just going to you
know we&#39;re gonna end you in all this and
they didn&#39;t physically they didn&#39;t
physically put their hands on me but I
was sitting in a chair and I was
handcuffed to the chair and I couldn&#39;t
move so basically you know it was just
this just like harassment I didn&#39;t need
anything for like a whole day no water
no nothing I just set there my section
was about eight to ten guys now I know
just me
Sargent Island insurgent Hamptons were
the only ones I saw and now they saw the
crash and well at least you know the
jungle were where it came through they
saw that but they didn&#39;t go into the
ridge cuz like I said we were 10 to 20
meters in front of them and they radioed
just you know to halt that we found and
everything&#39;s fine listen it was in late
March early April of 97 so we&#39;re talking
like when I got back you know I
approached sergeant Allen about it
because of course he&#39;s married he&#39;s got
like a 1 or 2 kids and I went to his
house on on-base housing and he got all
upset and threw me out of his house said
he didn&#39;t want to talk about it and I
mean they scared I guess they scared
this guy&#39;s to me
and see I mean you gotta understand you
know I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the
armed service but the Marine Corps
everything it&#39;s you know it&#39;s monolithic
and when they&#39;re told to do something
they&#39;re gonna they&#39;re gonna do it and
and if you don&#39;t want to go along with
this though they&#39;ll basically Aurora
I didn&#39;t want to keep my mouth shut
about it and I told my first sergeant
First Sergeant pal I told him about it
and I don&#39;t even know if he I don&#39;t
think he&#39;s still there anymore I mean
we&#39;re talking three years ago so yes
there was life forms and the ship I and
I could they were it&#39;s almost like if
someone was like reading your mind and
that&#39;s the way it felt I felt like I
felt a presence it was like supernatural
it was no debris that I saw but there
were big gashes in there in there in the
rear of the of the aircraft and what I
looked what it looked like as it had
been hit with maybe a service deer
missile there were a couple Hawk
batteries and that&#39;s a homing all the
way killer that&#39;s all
low-to-medium service dear any any
aircraft missile basically it doesn&#39;t
have to hit the target in order to
destroy the target what it does is it
gets in proximity of it and it has a
high-explosive fragmentation warhead and
it basically explodes like a big shotgun
in the vicinity of the the targeted area
and by fragmentation it&#39;s supposed to
destroy the target or and/or damage it
so it won&#39;t be able to continue its
mission
so it&#39;ll I think we shot it down this is
what I think happened is we shot it down
the peruvians shot it down the other
guys knew it was flying I knew there
these these aircraft were flying because
I&#39;d been in the command center there at
the radar installation and and and I
heard a couple women they&#39;re in the
airforce talking about aircraft flying
in and out of the atmosphere at Mach 10
plus so these aircraft are flying around
they&#39;re you know they&#39;re you know
they&#39;re reenter of the atmosphere or
whatever and you know I believe that the
higher-ups knew it was fine in the area
as these were these large events it
looked like they went into the craft but
I couldn&#39;t tell but it I mean it was a
shadow that was the only thing that
really cast has shattered the rest of
this well is another thing was these
vents cast to the shadow where you could
see where there wasn&#39;t light but the Sun
was shining around on the object and it
didn&#39;t cast a shadow not on on anything
it was like kind of like absorbing the
light it&#39;s weird this is not one of ours
you know I&#39;m you know when stinger
school they teach you about all
different kinds of aircraft and stuff
like that and I knew I knew a lot of
aircraft anyway because I like I like
reading about aircraft and data that
stuff and well essentially when I saw it
I&#39;m like man this is not this is nothing
that I know of
okay basically the radar was sitting and
this was get on a hill its kami dumb and
you know it rotates and everything and
there&#39;s a command bunker that was built
under the under that under the earth and
I mean it looks like star wars in there
and I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s total
air-conditioned I mean it&#39;s really nice
and there&#39;s like computers and they got
the the the you know the control panels
and everything that control the radars
and their I guess they&#39;re linked to
other side
you knew and they get other data coming
in and well we had guard duty and I and
the night that this happened this was in
the early evening and it was my shift
and I was in there and I was checking
people going in and out you know they
got ID and you know check you know
whatever so like these two girls they
come walking out and they were talking
about we got these aircraft flying again
and the other girl says yeah you know
they&#39;re coming in and out of the
atmosphere but he came in there and he
told me to come back with him then we go
back there and and he goes I want the
logs cuz they log all these flights
coming in you know they&#39;re burying what
they are what code they&#39;re squawking all
that so he gets the books and I had to
sign off for him to take all that I mean
when you got when you got objects that
are re-entering the atmosphere and then
stopping on a dime and then turning
around and going exactly the opposite
direction you know that&#39;s kind of
strange meteors don&#39;t do that all this
this happen all the time there was like
three or four incidents where I was Duty
there that the same on the same Air
Force officer came in there to get books
yeah these were tracked from this
particularly radar that were logged men
the reason I guess the reason they were
taken him is they didn&#39;t want people to
know that they&#39;re tracking these
aircraft I guess I mean again as I&#39;m
just assuming that yeah I think they
knew it was coming in and they said we
can&#39;t identify it it&#39;s violating
airspace so they could have radiated the
peruvians said take them out and then
they shot it down that was confident
that when I saw the the aircraft it had
been hit by something something that had
had took it out they were scared and it
was the apprehension the fear and then
that they that they were not here to
harm us thats really what what it felt
like and I mean that&#39;s not that&#39;s not my
own emotions I&#39;ve seen the creatures in
my in my thoughts and I&#39;ve seen and I
saw them what they look like oval egg
head with big dark eyes big eyes nose in
a small mouth new years and they were
projecting that
here they were here they were here they
weren&#39;t here you know that they weren&#39;t
gonna harm me and that was basically
that everything is gonna be all right
just help me get just help us get out of
here I think there was I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
know how many were on the craft yeah
definitely more than one probably by
four or five
I think it was organic and alive yeah
yeah I think that I think that that
whole craft it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s
almost like if you had an extension like
your arm or your leg and I think the way
they can I mean this is just for
thinking about it that that the way they
control the craft is with their thoughts
and they have new buttons or anything
they push it&#39;s not from Earth I mean I
knew that when I looked at it you know I
mean I&#39;m not doing this to make money or
publicity or anything but I think it
needs to be told I think people need to
hear it whether they agree with me or
not is a new consequence their cover was
there to track the track drug aircraft I
think I don&#39;t know but from what I
understand that they were doing a whole
lot more than just tracking drug or
craft I mean they had a laser
rangefinders and all kinds of high-tech
stuff that I&#39;ve never seen before and I
can&#39;t really explain I knew that there
was a couple of lrf there I don&#39;t know
what their lrf laser rangefinder I don&#39;t
know what they had those through there
but they were huge man look like big
telescopes but they had them in a bunker
and it was able to rise up and they can
zoom around a song doing I mean just a
bunch of weird stuff and then not even
that we had like a live fire shoot in
the jungle and there was Green Berets
army airborne I mean a bunch of these
spec ops guys a Delta Force they&#39;re you
know the murders at wake over there it
is you know all these you know all these
guys out there I mean the Chinese
Chinese are there you know they&#39;re out
there training man and we&#39;re their
training the Peruvians too so it&#39;s weird
man weird situation well this is
definitely something like NATO or some
multi multinational deal and what I keep
you know I keep going back and really
thinking about that why are all these
guys here why would the Chinese be
concerned with drugs being smuggled or
you know or any kind of drug
paraphernalia being smuggled into the
states I mean personally I mean I knew
for a fact that our government are the
ones that are importing drugs I mean you
know I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s I mean but
the fact that do I think that
that this dis command center I think it
was permanent think he&#39;s been in
operation for a while they had the big
deed you know Delta Oscar an echo on the
back of their back on a couple the guys
were wearing like these these rain
jackets because it had been raining the
font of the previous day and they were
in there and there were other guys were
wearing a containment like biological
suits it wasn&#39;t like that it was more
height act like there&#39;s big jump suits
that you zip up the back and you can
like we&#39;re a breathing apparatus in
there those guys there was about 30 of
them at least and they marched right by
me as I was I was being taken away they
were marching to get down into the cliff
I guess they were in there to check this
thing out well I think happen I think
they went in there and they took
everything out and they shipped it back
home
I think the behavior the people yeah I
was definitely it was this is routine
man I mean these guys were squared away
they were exactly what they&#39;re doing
they&#39;ve been trained to do this stop
before that was the atmosphere the total
professional cold unassuming of nature
you know it&#39;s just you know we&#39;re here
to do a job and and you get the [ __ ] out
of our ways is basically not the
attitude I was raised in a Christian
home to believe that there was a God and
that he created everything near the
universe and here they are these these
creatures that I&#39;ve never seen before
never come in contact with and this
happens man and it just it made me do
chromis crazy not like suicidal but I
just couldn&#39;t I had to like reevaluate
everything that I need it&#39;s sort of like
when you&#39;re a kid you know you&#39;ve been
told Santa Clauses is is you know real
then you find out that he&#39;s really not
and the Tooth Fairy you know it&#39;s like
now that you know there&#39;s no going back
there&#39;s like no there&#39;s no denial
there&#39;s no sin well you know this is you
know I don&#39;t really see this and I
couldn&#39;t really deal with it you know it
was that is that what do I do you know
do I tell people but I mean who&#39;s gonna
believe that that another Lance Corporal
or mink or in the Marine Corps in the
middle of the [ __ ] jungle is going to
see an aircraft like this it&#39;s more like
I was sitting watching a fly got like a
film like I was sitting and I was
watching what was happening and I was I
was basically you know with these aliens
these creatures and they were touching
me you know not not like sexually or
with instruments or anything they were
holding my hands and they had their
hands on me they don&#39;t
four fingers by the way it was a warm
like loving feeling like like you would
have if you were with a family these
creatures are like I guess you get
probably the closest thing I could say
that they were like homeless like angels
and if I had to I&#39;d go with them right
now
I mean I&#39;d get a walk and I had this
obsession with that you know I guess it
was I guess because the pain of the
experience and then the Marine Corps
that I just wanted to escape you know
and and I was thinking about you know
being with these creatures a lot and
they&#39;re wanting to go with them and
wanting to get out of here because these
different agencies are just on their own
they they don&#39;t obey the law they
they&#39;re just the rogue you know they&#39;re
just they&#39;re just off on their own
I don&#39;t do I think this is a project
that goes up through the government and
everyone has a piece in it no I think
these guys just operate on their own no
one knows what they do these guys
they&#39;re just off on their own there&#39;s no
oversight no control and they just do
whatever they want they don&#39;t I mean and
they&#39;re evil man these people are evil
you know do I think it goes to Bill
Clinton and to the Congress there may be
guys up there that knew about it they&#39;re
not gonna say anything man they say
anything you know they&#39;re free you know
for those of you don&#39;t know and I knew I
knew Marine snipers that I know I&#39;ve
heard other guys talk about it
and I&#39;ve heard that that these guys you
know they go on the streets and they
stalk people and they kill them I know
that air fort
I know that excuse me that army airborne
snipers do the same thing they use Delta
Force to to go to go grab these people
and silence them by killing them and
maybe something else onto telling well
you know this goes on where do they get
the money to finance all this and stuff
well very simply either they&#39;re selling
arms they&#39;re selling drugs a lot a lot
of this business about you know having
the spec ops and they get these
unlimited amounts of money well they&#39;re
not coming it&#39;s not coming from the
government coffer and it&#39;s coming from
running drugs or weapons or you know the
selling of hardware or whatever
he knew that there was something going
on that was a big secret that he could
not divulge Verner von Braun actually
told me that the spin was alive that the
premise for space-based weaponry the
reasons that were going to be given the
enemies that we were going to identify
were all based on a lie
