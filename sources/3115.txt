E are slowly em erging from a century of scientific
thought based, in the broadest sense, on a m aterialistic
outlook. This slow em ergence is partly due to causes within
the édifice of science itself, and, as w e should expect, it is
most apparent in the basic domain of physics. Signs are not
w anting that the biological sciences are becom ing sensitive
to the new life, and the rise of psychological m edicine is an
interesting pointer to a broader outlook in the applied field.
O ne o f the most interesting growths o f the last twenty-five
years has been the science o f para-psychology, w hich m ay
briefly be described as the application o f experimental
method and statistics to the field of psychical research. H ow -
ever suspicious the m ajority of scientific men m ay still be o f
psychical research in general, here in para-psychology are
facts w hich com pletely underm ine the com placent m aterial-
ism of the past century. E xcept to those w ho prefer not to
see them lest they should hâve to recast their thinking, these
facts présent an inescapable challenge. I venture to think
that the next century w ill be notable to posterity for tw o
things— (i) that nuclear energy com pelled m en to find an
alternative to w ar, and (2) that a w idening récognition o f
the im portance o f psychical research changed the w hole
clim ate o f thought.
I hâve not written this book for scholars and experts, but
for the ordinary thoughtful person who has not a great deal
of time for reading but w ould like to understand w hat
psychical research is ail about and w h y I regard’its im plica­
tions and its future as o f such im portance.

R O M ancient times there hâve persisted records of, and
beliefs m, w hat today w e call para-norm al phenomena.
Such things as thought-reading, “ second-sight” , prophecies
and prémonitions, ghosts and haunted houses, hâve often
found a place in literature, but where entertainment value
is the criterion, the scientifîc m ind is not disposed towards
enquiry. T here has, however, always been a persistent, if
fragm entary record of strange expériences which, if accepted
as facts, do not seem to corne under the well-ordered laws of
m odem science. Such records hâve appeared frequently in
connection w ith spiritualism and the phenomena o f trance,
and these observations hâve been m ade in some instances by
most com petent and trustworthy observers. O ver seventy
years ago Professor Sidgw ick said :
cT t is a scandai that the dispute as to the reality of
these phenom ena should still be going on, that so m any
competent witnesses should hâve declared their belief in
them, that so m any others should be profoundly in-
terested in having the question determined, and yet that
the educated, as a body, should still be sim ply in the
attitude of incredulity.”
In 1882 the first m eeting was held in London o f the
Society for Psychical Research. It was founded b y a group
of Cam bridge scholars w how ere prepared to investigate these
phenomena in a strictly scientifîc spirit, and w ere concem ed
to collect, in the first instance, reliable and trustworthy data.
T h e Society was cxtrem ely fortunate in the intellectual
p .r .— 1*
2 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
calibre and dévotion of its founders, w ho gave m any years
of their life to personal and painstaking investigation, and
created for their successors a tradition of sound and critical
scholarship. Xndeed, the seventy years o f enquiry w hich hâve
been recorded in the Proceedings and the Journal o f the
S.P.R. now make it possible for the unprejudiced student to
form reliable opinions on m any of these phenomena. A book
such as this could not hâve been written were it not for the
devoted labours of these men and their successors. T h e
moving spirit was H enry Sidgwick, who becam e K night-
bridge Professor of M oral Philosophy in Cam bridge. His
pupil and friend, F. W. H . Myers, a brilliant classical scholar
and minor poet— a man with a passion for truth— also
played a leading part. Edmund G um ey, a Fellow of T rinity
with a particular aptitude for psychological experiment and
with medical qualifications, joined them later. In addition,
Sir William Barrett of Dublin, Lord Rayleigh, M rs. H enry
Sidgwick and others of scientific standing gave their time
and energy to the Society. D uring its history the Presidential
Chair has been occupied by men such as Professor Balfour
Stewart, Earl Balfour, Professor W illiam James, Sir W illiam
Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Professor Charles Richet, Bishop
Boyd Carpenter, Professor Henri Bergson, D r. F. C . S.
Schiller, Professor Gilbert M urray, D r. L. P. Jacks, Lord
Rayleigh, Professor W illiam M cD ougall, Professor Hans
Driesch, Dr. W. F. Prince, and others. These names alone
are an indication of the respect in w hich the Society’s work
has been held by eminent men. T hey are a rem inder also to
the person who, without ascertaining the facts, supposes that
psychical research is concerned m erely with “spooks” and
“ ghosts” and the paraphernalia of popular spiritualism and
superstition, that far more im portant issues are at stake.
W hat these are will be discussed later in the light o f reliable
data.

E arly W ork
W hen the Society first began its investigations, six small
committees w ere formed, each being entrusted w ith the study
of a spécial topic. T h ey w ere as follows :
1. A n exam ination of the nature and extent of any in­
fluence w hich m ay be exerted by one m ind upon another,
apart from any generally recognised m ode of perception,
2. T h e study o f hypnotism and the forais o f so-called
mesmeric trance, w ith its alleged insensibility to pain; clair­
voyance and other allied phenomena.
3. A critical révision of Reichenbach’s researches with
certain persons called “sensitive” , and an enquiry whether
such persons possess any power of perception beyond a
highly exalted sensibility o f the recognised sensory organs.
4. A careful investigation of any reports resting on strong
testimony regarding apparitions at the mom ent o f death, or
otherwise, or regarding disturbances in houses reputed to be
haunted.
5. A n enquiry into the various physical phenomena com-
m only called spiritualistic; w ith an attem pt to discover their
causes and general laws.
6. T h e collection and collation of existing m aterials bear-
ing on the history o f these subjects.
I shall not interrupt this brief historical survey to indicate
how far the seventy years of subséquent work hâve
illum inated these matters. T h ey are mentioned in order to
show the type of phenom ena which at that time were con-
sidered to call for investigation. T h e measure of success
achieved will, it is hoped, be made clear in later chapters of
this book.
Som e of the landmarks in the history of the Society can
4
. P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
be mentioned briefly. Messrs. Gurney, M yers, and Podmore
published in 1886 a large collection of data in a book called
Phantasms of the Living. It was a pioneering work, valuable
even today as a source-book, as well as for the theoretical
views developed.
Ànother landmark was the Gensus of Hallucinations in
1889—
90 to discover how widespread were expériences of
this para-normal type. T he main question asked was : H âve
you ever, when believmg yourself to be com pletely awake,
had a vivid impression of seeing or bem g touched by a
living or inanimate objecta or of hearing a voice ; w hich im ­
pression, so far as you can discover was not due to any ex-
tem al physical cause?5
5 O f the 17,000 replies, approxim ately
10 percent, answered “yes” . It was particularly interestmg
to find that of these, about 32 per cent, were hallucinations
of living persons, 14*3 per cent, of dead persons, and 33-2
per cent, of unidentified persons. Thus, contrary to1popular
belief, apparitions of the living are m ore common than
apparitions of the dead.
W ith the deaths of H enry Sidgwick m 1900 and of
F. W . H . M yers m 1901, followed by the posthumous publi­
cation in two large volumes of M yers5 great work, Human
Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death, w e corne to the
end of the fïrst phase of the Society5s work. Reliable data
had been collected m m any fields. M yers had put forw ard
important theoretical views, including his concept of a sub­
liminal mind. Perhaps most important of ail, the technique
of investigation had been discovered b y expérience; high
standards had been set and maintained. Sources of m al­
observation and the types of précaution necessary to give
data o f scientific value were laid down. In no field of enquiry
are these thmgs more important than in psychical research.
Here w e are often dealing with phenomena which seem to
the orthodox scientific mind to hâve an inhérent aura of
H I S T O R Y O F P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H 5
improbabxlity about them. H ow ever prejudiced such an
attitude m ay be3it has to be reckoned with, and it can, I
think, justly be said of the Society for Psychical Research
that the standard o f its investigations and the records in its
Proceedings w ill bear favourable comparison w ith that o f the
best learned societies in any field o f enquiry.
In 1888, six years after the parent body was instituted, the
A m erican Society for Psychical Research was founded, and
through its Proceedings and Journal it has also added
greatly to the body o f our knowledge.
T he Présent C entury
I shall not attem pt to summarise the growth of knowledge
of the last h alf century. This little book w ill itself be a
présentation of such knowledge to the reader. A bout twenty-
five years ago there was, in the founding o f the Para-
psychology Departm ent at D uke TJniversity, N orth Carolina,
an event of great im portance. T h e im portance lay not only
in the academ ie récognition given to w ork in psychical re-
search, but also in the systematic developm ent of research
of an experimental kind, of such a nature that statistics could
be used to evaluate it.
O ne of the most im portant m ethods o f enquiry in
psychical research is to collect a large stock of well-attested
records. These are naturally of spontaneous and uncontrolled
happenings, T h ey often hâve about them an impressive and
dram atic character, and appear to be associated w ith some
crisis or emotional expérience in w hich a person is involved.
T h e collections of large numbers of such cases can be
examined, analysed, and compared, and gradually there
emerge common éléments w hich perm it hypothèses to be
formulated. L et m e présent one such spontaneous event
w hich m ight be labelled as “ clairvoyance” (though to attach
a label to a case is not to hâve an understanding o f it).
6 P S Y C H Ï C A L R E S E A R C H
Case J.— Mrs. Bettany (from Phantasms of the Living,
Vol. ï,p . 194):
“W hen I was a child I had m any rem arkable ex­
périences of a psychical nature, which I remember to hâve
looked upon as ordinary and natural at the time.
“ On one occasion (I am unable to fix the date, but I
must hâve been about ten years old) I was w alking in a
country lane at A, the place where m y parents resided. I
was reading geometry as I walked along . . . when in a
moment I saw a bedroom known as the W hite Room in
m y home, and upon the floor lay m y mother, to ail appear-
ance dead. The vision must hâve remained some minutes,
during which time m y real surroundmgs appeared to pale
and die out; but as the vision faded, actual surroundings
came back, at first dim ly and then clearly. I could not
doubt that w hat I had seen was real, so instead of going
home I went at once to1the house of our m edical m an and
found him at home. H e at once set out with m e for m y
home, on the w ay putting questions I could not answer, as
m y mother was to ail appearances well when I left home,
ï led the doctor straight to the W hite Room, where we
found m y mother actually lying as in m y vision. This was
true even to minute details. She had been seized suddenly
by an attack of the heart, and would soon hâve breathed
her last but for the doctor’s tim ely advent. I shall get m y
father and mother to read and sign this.”
In answer to questions, M rs. Bettany added :
(1) I was in no anxiety about m y m other at the time of
the vision.
(2) I found a handkerchief with a lace border beside her
on the floor. This I had distinctly noticed in m y vision.
(3) This was the only occasion, I believe, on w hich I
saw a scene transported apparently into the actual field of
H I S T O R Y OF P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H 7
vision, to the exclusion of objects and surroundings
actually présent. I hâve had other visions in w hich I hâve
seen events happening as they really were in another
place, but I hâve also been conscious of real (î.e. immé­
diate) surroundings
O f course spontaneous events, by their vcry nature, corne
unsought. T h ey cannot be controlled or repeated at will. In
this respect the field of study is like that o f astronomy,
geology, or m eteorology : the data hâve to be collected and
observed as they arc or when they occur. In the above case
there is clearly some com m unication between the mmds o f
the m other and child, origm ating in the form er m ind and
building up in the latter m ind into something w hich has ail
the vividness of Visual perception. T h e com m unication itself
was of a little group of related ideas born in a desperate
situation.
Experimental work deals w ith the com m unication of sim­
ple ideas : numbers, anim al figures, colours, or geom etrical
symbols, wherc it is agreed that there shall be only a lim ited
range of choice (say, five different symbols). In this restricted
type of com munication it is possible to assess w hether the
scoring estimated upon a chance basis is exceeded or not.
M oreover, in any appréciable departure from chance scoring
it is possible to calculate w hat are the odds that such a depar­
ture from the expected score is likely to be a chance dévia­
tion. Expressed simply and briefly, this is the prototype of
Professor J. B. Rhine’s w ork at D uke U niversity. It has of
course been greatly developed and elaborated, and is now
conducted in a van ety of forms in m any parts of the world.
For this type of work there is m uch to be said.
1. It is controlled experimental work and substantially
repeatable.
2. It permits variation of m any relevant factors, and thus
8 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
helps to disclose the mode of operation of the para-norm al
faculty.
3. T h e application of statistical m ethod makes it possible
to say what the odds are against “ coincidence” or “ chance”
as an explanation.
On the other hand, the phenomena being so investigated
are those on the fringe of norm ahty : they hâve none of the
emotional associations and dram atic undertones o f m any
spontaneous phenomena. T o name a card as a “ circle” rather
than a “square” is not a very stirring disclosure— and it m ay
well be that careful study of para-norm al phenomena in
their full flowering m spontaneous cases will reveal m uch
that cannot be found in experimental work.
I think w e can sum up by saying that both modes o f study
hâve made, and will continue to make, an im portant con­
tribution to psychical research. There is a third m ethod of
study, but this is for the future. R apid progress m ay be
expected when some well-educated, scientifically disposed
persons are prepared to undergo the hard discipline of
developing their own extra-sensory faculties and bringing
them under the control of the will. W ith these prelim inary
remarks, we shall plunge into our subject.

H E terra telepathy was coined by F, W . H . M yers, and
refers ta the com m unication of ideas from one m ind to
another w ithout the use o f an y of the recognised channels of
sense. T h e term clairvoyance means literally “clear seeing” ,
and refers to the m ind’s pow er o f acquiring know ledge of
physical objects or events (as distinct from m ental ones)
w ithout the use o f any o f the recognised channels of sense.
O ther closely related ternis, such as clair-audience or clair-
sentience w ill be a t once understood. T h e percipient m ind
describes its para-norm al know ledge as though it was o f the
type which w ould be acquired b y norm al hearing or feeling.
O ther terms havebeen w idely used in recent years, such as
“ extra-sensory perception” (E.S.P.) and “para-norm al cog-
nition” (P.N.C.). These are terms w hich em brace ail o f the
above phenomena. Some authorities dislike them : the first
because w e hâve no right to- assume the m echanism is akin
to norm al perception; the second because it is scarcely
cognition if the inform ation is not appreciated to be true
knowledge. D r. Thouless has suggested that the G reek letter
ÿ (psi) should beused to designate thefaculty, sin ceit carries
no such ideas. W e shall not w orry about the use of terms,
however, as long as these objections are realised.
Some of the most interesting and convincing examples of
telepathy occur in everyday life. T h ey are of no evidential
value to anyone except the im m édiate experiencer, but
where they are o f frequent occurrence to a person, they leave

little room for doubt. I présent a few cases out of a w ealth of
data which m ay be regarded as typical of the more dram atic
variety :
Case 2.— Commander Aylesbury (from Phantasms of the
Living, Vol. II, p. 227) :
“T he writer, when thirteen years of âge, was capsized
in a boat when landing on the island of Bally, east of
Java, and was nearly drowned O n com ing to the surface,
after being repeatedly submerged, the boy called his
mother. This amused the boat’s crew, w ho spoke of it
afterwards, and jeered him a good deal about it. M onths
after, on arrivai in England, the boy went to his home,
and while telling his mother of his narrow escape, he said,
‘W hile I was under water, I saw you ail sitting in this
room ; you were working somethmg white. I saw you ail
— Mother, Emily, Eliza, and Ellen.’ His m other at once
said, ‘W hy yes, and I heard you cry for me, and I sent
Em ily to look out of the window, for I remarked that
something had happened to that poor boy.’ T h e time,
owing to the différence of East longitude, corresponded
with the time when the voice was heard.”
Commander Aylesbury adds :
“ I saw their features (my mother’s and sisters’), the
room and the furniture, particularly the old-fashioned
Venetian blinds. M y eldest sister was seated next to m y
mother.
“ I think the time must hâve been very early in the
morning. I remember a boat capsized the day before, and
washed up. The mate said we would go and bring her off
in the morning, but the exact time I cannot remember. It
was a terrible position and the surf was awful. W e were
knocked end over end, and it was the most narrow escape
I ever had— and I hâve had m any; but this one was so
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E II
impressed on m y minci w ith the circumstances— the re­
marias and jeers of the men— ‘Boy, w hat was you calling
for your m other for ? D o you think she could pull you out
of D a vy Jones’s locker,’ etc., w ith other language I cannot
use.’5
O ne of his sisters wrote :
“ I distinctly remember the incident you m ention in
your letter (the voice calling ‘M other’); it m ade such an
impression on m y mind, I shall never forget it. W e were
sitting quietly at work one evening; it was about nine
o’clock. I think it m ust hâve been late in the summer as
w e had left the Street door open. W e first heard a faint cry
of ‘M other’ ; w e ail looked up, and said to> one anothçr,
‘D id you hear that? Someone cried out “ M other” .’ W e
had scarcely finished speaking, when the voice again
called, ‘M other5, twice in quick succession, the last cry a
frightened, agonising cry. W e ail started up, and M other
said to me, ‘G o to the door and see w hat is the m atter.’ I
ran directly into the Street and stood for some minutes,
but ail was silent and not a person to be seen; it was a
lovely evening, not a breath of air. M other was sadly upset
about it. I remember she paced the room, and feared that
something had happened to you. She wrote down the date
the next day, and when you cam e hom e and told us how
nearly you had been drowned, and the time of day, Father
said it w ould be about the time nine o’clock w ould be w ith
us. I know the date and the tim e corresponded.”
Case 5.— M rs. Taunton (from Phantasms of the Living,
V ol. II, p. 3 7 ) :
“ O n Thursday evening, i4th November, 1867, I w as
sitting in the Birm ingham Tow n H all w ith m y husband at
a concert, when there cam e over me the icy chill w hich
12 PS Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
usually accompanies these occurrences. Alm ost imme-
diately, I saw with perfect distinctness, between m yself
and the orchestra, m y uncle, M r. W ., lying in bed w ith an
appealing look on his face, like one dying. I had not heard
anything of him for several months, and had no reason to
think he was ill. T h e appearance was not transparent or
filmy, but perfectly solid-looking; and yet I could some-
how see the orchestra, not through, but behind it. I did
not try tum ing m y eyes to see whether the figure m oved
with them, but looked at it with a fascinated expression
that m ade m y husband ask if I was ill. I asked him not to
speak to me for a minute or two; the vision gradually dis-
appeared, and I told m y husband, after the concert was
over, what I had seen. A letter came shortly after telling
of m y uncle’s death. H e died at exactly the tim e w hen I
saw the vision/’
Case 4

I well remember m y w ife telling m e of the follow ing
incident— one which we hâve recalled several times since
it happened over twenty years ago. O ur eldest daughter
M . was a little girl between two and three years old at the
time. T he following is m y wife5s account of the events.
£
£T was looking out of the w indow into the garden
where a young married friend was playing w ith M ., and
in particular was teaching her to turn somersaults. I felt
some concern, as M . seemed very small to be learning these
contortions, but I said nothing as I did not w ant to hurt
m y friend’s feelings.
£
££
That same night when passing through the drowsy
State just before going to sleep there suddenly flashed into
my mind a picture of M . with her neck broken. I quickly
threw it off, of course, and went to sleep.
£
£Tn the m om ing one of the first things w hich M . said
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 13
to me in her childish w ay was, £
£
M y neck îsn’t broken, is it
M um m y?” 35

I shall comment briefly on these cases. Case 2 has
ostensibly a reciprocal element about it. T h e boy apparently
saw clairvoyantly his home surroundings while several mem-
bers of his fam ily clair-audiently heard the voice. It is the
latter phenomenon to w hich I particularly draw attention,
for there w ere several percipients and there was corrobora­
tive evidence that the boy called for his mother. In Case 3,
the event was conveyed to M rs. Taunton’s m ind as a verid-
ical vision or hallucination. It m ight be descnbed as clair­
voyance on M rs. Taunton’s part, or as a télépathie
com munication from her uncle’s m ind to her own w hich
rose into consciousness as a group of Visual images w hich she
regarded as objective. In Case 4, the piece of visual im agery
and its accom panym g idea was conveyed to the little girl’s
m ind and given verbal expression. This last case is obviously
one of pure telepathy, involving at unconscious levels a
mind-to-mind relationship. In the two previous cases, in-
stead of invoking clairvoyance and clair-audience, w e could
regard the phenomenon as telepathy, but say that an audi-
tory vehicle in the one case and a visual vehicle in the other
case were the means of presenting the inform ation to the
consciousness of the percipient. Sometimes a piece of know ­
ledge m ay be conveyed para-norm ally to another m ind—
w holly symbolically. I stress these features because, w hile it
is convenient is some respects to retain terms like telepathy,
clairvoyance and clair-audience, the truth m ay be that the
mind has one great faculty o f appréhension (which w e m ay
label \
[
r if w e so desire). T h e m ind m ay create, however, a
variety of vehicles to transport this appréhension to the level
of conscious awareness.
i4 P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
Q ualitative Experimental W ork
A great deal of experimental work of a simple and
straightforward kind has been recorded. In principle, there
hâve been two persons, one concerned w ith the attem pt to
transmit an idea (the “agent” ) and the other concerned w ith
îts réception (the “percipient” ). T h e ideas which hâve been
transmitted hâve been of every variety : playing cards, con­
crète abjects, proper names, numbers, simple designs
(geometrical and otherwise) drawn on paper, colours, sen­
sations of taste, localised sensations of pain, etc. T h e first
three volumes of Proceedings of the Society for Psychicol
Research contain records which are well worth perusal and
présent the sceptic with facts of an impressive kind. This
type of work does not lend itself, except in spécial cases, to
accurate quantitative assessment. A picture, for example,
drawn by a percipient m ay show points of undoubted re-
semblance to the picture constructed by the agent, and one
may hâve to describe it as a “partial success” . W here hum an
judgment is involved in assessing the results, préjudice in
one direction or the other easily arises. H ow far such terms
as “chance” and “coincidence” can be applied then becomes
a matter for debate.
I propose to describe in this section only the work of
Professor Gilbert M urray, who with his daughters M rs.
Arnold Toynbee, Miss Agnes M urray, and other members
of his family, carried out (1910-24) two long sériés o f experi-
ments in pure telepathy. T h e nature of the ideas, both as
regards character and complexity, is such that the measure
of success obtained is phénoménal— indeed, it is most im ­
pressive. T h e procedure is described by Professor M urray as
follows {Proc. S.P.R., Vol. X X IX ) :

H ere are a group of eight experiments m ade on tw o suc­
cessive occasions, w hich speak for themselves.
1. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : “ Lord Jim being tried
at Aden in Gonrad’s book. T h e scene in the L aw Court.”
Professor Murray : “No, not a glimmer.”
2. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : “ M r. Fisher and M r.
B. drinking beer in a café in Berlin.”
Professor Murray : “ I f s got something to do w ith a pub-
lic-house— no, ifs beer. I fs Fisher and somebody else drink­
ing beer— somebody who has nothing to do w ith Fisher. I
can’t be at ail sure— I should think little B.”
3. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : “ Savonarola having the
pictures burnt in Florence and standing up and a crow d
around.”
Professor Murray: “ I fs Italian— I think ifs something
in a book. W ell, this is the merest guess and m ay hâve some-
ï g PS Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
thing to do with the spark that came out of the fire I get a
smell of burning, the smell of a^bonfire— I get Savonarola
burning thepictures in Florence.
4. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : “ I think of a scene m
a Strindberg play— two people sitting in a round tower and
the m an has a fainting fit and the wife hopes he îs
dead.”
Professor Murray : “ This is a book and a book I haven t
read. No— not Russian— not Italian. It’s somebody lying in
a faint. It’s very horrible. I think somebody is fainting^ and
his w ife or some woman is hoping he is dead. can’ t be
M aeterlinck— I think I hâve read them ail— oh ! it’s Strind­
berg. [‘Can you get the place?’] I thought o f them in a great
round tower. T h at was w hy I thought of M aeterlinck.”
5. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : “ I think of that funny
old Irishman called Dr. H unt in the hôtel at Jam aica. 1 11
think of the race where they wouldn’t let him rid e w ith his
little grey mare.”
Professor Murray : “ Tropics. It must be something to do
with Jamaica. I can’t get it a bit clear. I feel as if it w ere
a drunken Irish doctor talking w ith a brogue. I can’t get it
clear.” [Mrs. Toynbee did not mention that he got drunk,
but he did.]
6. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : “M rs. G. hitting the
Purser with a skipping rope.”
Professor Murray : “ I think it’s M other hitting the Purser
with a skipping rope— no, it’s your woman, the over-dressed
woman, Mrs. G.”
7. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : “T h e little crocodile on
the Gaptain’s trunk, and him showing it to Isabel and m e.”
Professor Murray : “ W here’s Denis’s lizard gone? Because
I thought it was Denis’s lizard pursuing you and Isabel—
the lizard on a bed in a cabm, and you and Isabel looking
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 17
8. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : £
T 11 do D , S. in a dug-
out canoë on the Serpentine.”
Professor Murray : “ Is it somebody w alking in Kensing-
ton Gardens ? D . S. w alking in Kensington Gardens. N o, I
didn’t see w hat else he was doing— perhaps he was in a
boat.”
T o the suggestion that perhaps unconscious m uscular re-
sponses under Professor M urray’s hand furnished dues, I
think a sufficient answer lies in the com plexity of the ideas
and the fact that Professor M urray seldom withdrew or con-
tradicted w hat he had said. M oreover, any contact seemed
unessential, as was shown b y m any experiments in w hich
there was none. T h e last three examples given above were
in the absence of any contact.
In the first long sériés o f 505 experiments conducted be-
tween i g i o and 1915, 33 per cent, w ere judged successful,
28 per cent, partially successful, and 39 per cent, failures.
In the second sériés of 295 experiments conducted between
1916 and 19243 there were 36 percent, successes, 23 percen t,
partial successes, and 41 per cent, failures.
This group of experiments is one of the most rem arkable
and convincing w hich has ever been undertaken and
officially recorded.
Q u a n t it a t iv e E x p e r im e n t a l W o rk
About twenty-five years ago D r. J. B. R hine of D uke
U niversity, U .S.A ., began system atic research of a kind to
w hich statistical methods are applicable. T h e results o f this
hâve been m ade available in the Journal of Paraypsychology
and in several books which he has published. T h e basic type
of experiment can be very quickly described.
A pack of “Zener” cards is used, consisting of 25 cards
each w ith similar backs— of the playing-card variety. Five
symbols are selected— say, square, circle, star, cross, w avy
l 8 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
line— and there are five of each kind in the pack. T h e pack
is shuffled, and the “agent” w ith the pack sits at one end of
a table, being obscured by a screen from the view of the
“ percipient”, who sits at the other end. T he agent now
looks at the cards one at a time, gives an audible signal as
he does so, and the percipient records on paper w hat he
guesses the card to be. T h e lisl can be checked subsequently
against the pack. T h e laws of probability indicate that the
chance of guessing correctly is i in 5. Suppose 100 trials
were made, and instead of 20 bem g correct, there were 30
correct. Elementary statistics applied to these results allows
us to say that the likelihood of this déviation from the ex-
pected score occurrmg as a m atter of chance is approxi-
mately 1 in 150. In other words, it is very probable that some
unrecognised factor is influencing the guessing. O ne of D r.
Rhine’s early collaborators, A. J. Linzm ayer, m ade 4,505
guesses in one experiment with 33-6 per cent, correct. T h e
odds against so big a déviation from 20 per cent, as this> are
astronomical if chance alone is supposed to be operative.
Such a simple experiment as that described above is said
to be under conditions of general extra-sensory perception
(G.E S.P.). In other words, the percipient could hâve
acquired knowledge telepathically from the agent’s mind,
or clairvoyantly from the pack itself. T h e experiment could,
however, easily be conducted under conditions of clair­
voyance alone. T he pack of cards would be shuffled; no
person would look at it, and the percipient would guess w hat
he believed the order to be from top to bottom of the pack.
O ne of Rhine’s assistants, G. E. Stuart, m ade 7,500 guesses
under these conditions, scoring 24-2 per cent, correct. H er­
bert Pearce, another collaborator, m ade 10,300 guesses w ith
36-4 per cent, correct. T h e odds with results of this kind are
billions to one in favour of a factor other than chance being
operative.

D uring the years that followed this early work, every
reasonable cnticism of experim ental conditions has been
met. A great variety of experiments has been m ade, and
some of the laws governing success hâve emerged. H ere are
facts w hich cannot be gainsaid, and the omis of disproof
now lies with those w ho deny them.
î shall refer briefly to experim ental w ork done by
G. N . M . Tyrrell, w ith M iss Gertrude Johnson as percipient.
Miss G. J. had a flair for finding lost objects when not con-
sciously looking for them, and T yrrell devised experiments
to use this faculty for investigation. Five small boxes were
laid side by side and projected through a screen on a table.
O n the side of the table w here Tyrrell sat, the boxes were
open; on the side o f the percipient (G. J.) the boxes had
sloping, overhanging lids. T h e boxes w ere heavily padded
inside. Tyrrell placed the end of a wooden pointer into the
boxes at random, saying £
£
In” as he did so. G. J. opened the
lid of the box where she believed the pointer to be, and
T yrrell could score success or failure b y the light com ing
through. M ost careful tests failed to detect any sound m ade
when the pointer was placed in a box. In 30,000 trials there
should hâve been 6,000 successes on a chance basis. In fact,
there were 9,364 successes (30-2 per cent.). T h e odds against
this on a chance basis are billions to one. In criticism o f this
work it was suggested that T yrrell m ight hâve had certain
habit patterns in the insertion of the pointer into the various
boxes. These m ight hâve coincided w ith certain habit pat­
terns of G. J. in choosing a box. T h e answer to this is :
1. Six different operators successively worked w ith G. J.,
and in 8,500 trials 25 per cent, successes were recorded. It
is most unlikely that these various operators would hâve the
same habit pattern as Tyrrell’s— assuming that there is such
a thing.
2. In a later piece of apparatus the agent’s sélection of
20 PS Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
box was made by a chance method based on a rotating
mechanical device. T h e results of G. J. were unaffected. In
a later apparatus, Tyrrell used light-proof -boxes com pletely
closed and containing pea-lamps, one of w hich could be lit
by a chance mechanical device. T he operator (Tyrrell) using
this did not himself know which lam p was being lit. T h e
recording was also m ade autom atically on a m oving strip of
paper. W hen a lid was raised by the percipient, an ink-
wheel marked the paper. If the selected box contained the
lighted lamp, a second wheel also m arked the paper. In one
experimental senes of 7,809 trials, 1,841 (23*5 per cent.)
were correct. It was noticed that at intervals there w ere little
runs of six or eight correct guesses— a feature also suggesting
that for a short period the para-norm al faculty was in
action.
T he sceptic m ay perhaps suggest that some m inute leak-
age of hght from the boxes was a sensory due. A part from
the précautions taken, the answer to this was provided by
Tyrrell in a relay device which he could put m to the circuit
by a switch. The sélection of the lamp by the agent was
made as before by a chance method, but the lamp selected
did not light up until the relay cam e into operation. T h e
relay was operated once any lid had been raised by a slight
amount. T h e reader w ill perhaps reflect on the im plications
of this : that G. J.’s hand moved towards a box where a lam p
would— a short time later— be lit. Here, in fact, is evidence
of clairvoyance, not of a présent event but of a future one
(unless clairvoyant perception of the intricacies of the elec-
trical wiring is assumed).
Tyrrell remarked that it was one of the most impressive
features of the research, that it did not appear to m atter
whether the delayed-action relay was operating or not. T h e
evidence for a precognitive faculty— of which this is only
a fragm ent— will be dealt w ith in the next chapter.
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 21
F a c t o r s a f f e c t in g ^-f a c u l t y
O ne of the most interesting and signifïcant discovenes
associated w ith experim ental work is that the distance be-
tween agent and percipient does not appear to affect the
faculty. If two persons are able to achieve a certain rate of
scoring, the same rate is m aintained whether the distance
between them is measured in yards or hundreds of miles.
Here, then, is somethmg very different from physical types
of radiation. T h e m ind of a person is certam ly linked w ith
his brain, and permits both of action of the person and the
receipt of impressions at the point o f space where his body
is. T h e m ind of the person must not, however, be assumed
as “in” space at ail. A part o f its activity, and in particular
its relation w ith other minds, is apparently on a level to
which our fam iliar spatial considérations do not apply.
If successive runs through a pack are set out in horizontal
rows underneath each other, the successes are m ore m arked
in the earlier h alf of a run than m the latter half. Some
kind of fatigue effect appears to operate. In addition, the
successes are frequently more m arked in early rows than in
later ones— as though once the stimulus of novelty and in­
terest has departed, it is less easy to evoke ^-faculty. It has
also been rem arked that a cheerful, informai, friendly atm o­
sphère is m uch m ore likely to give rise to success than one
of grim seriousness. It has also been shown b y Schm eidler
that persons who approached experimental work w ith a
favourably disposed attitude were m ore likely to exhibit
^-faculty than those who were highly sceptical.
Some work has been aone on the corrélation o f personality
types and intelligence-rating w ith ^-faculty. Speaking
generally, the “ expansive” type rather than the restricted
type favours ÿr-faculty. W e do not know m uch as yet of the
effects of glandular dis-balance on the faculty. There was,
22 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
however, an umisualîy high-scoring percipient who averaged
about 38 correct guesses out of 25 for 74 runs through the
pack, in experiments with Dr. Reiss. This person suffered
from hyperthyroidism— and after correction of the condi­
tion by medical treatment the scoring rate fell to a chance
level.
O ur knowledge of the action of drugs on ^-faculty is also
meagre. Narcotics appear, in general, to diminish the faculty,
while stimulants given to counteract the narcosis restore the
faculty.
In 1945 Dr. S. G. Soal began a sériés o f experiments w ith
Mrs. Stewart, a high-scoring subject. Indeed, her average
scoring for about 17,000 trials was about 28 per cent. Some
of these experiments will be described briefly, because they
îllustrate the development of experimental work and offer us
dues to the mode of functiom ng of ^-faculty.
Tw o criticisms m ight be levelled agamst the simple type
of card experiment described at the beginning of the pre-
vious section : (à) the pack m ight not alw ays be satisfactorily
shufïled so as to secure a random distribution, and (b) the
pitch or inflexion of the voice of the agent m ight offer dues
to the percipient. T o meet these possibilités Dr. Soal placed
the percipient within earshot in an adjacent room, and had
two people— the agent and an assistant— sitting on opposite
sides of a table. T he two latter were separated b y a screen
across the table, the screen having, however, a 3-inch square
aperture in its centre. T he agent had five playing cards, each
having an ammal-picture on the reverse side : Pélican,
Zébra, Giraffe, Lion, and Eléphant. It was his initial duty
to shuffle the cards and place them face downwards in a
row. T h e agent’s assistant was furnished w ith a table of
random numbers between 1 and 5, and had five cards w ith
these numbers printed on them. It was his duty to présent a
number-card at the aperture, and after a short pause to say
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 23
aloud “ First Guess” . T h e agent would then look at the card
indicated (counting from the left end of the row) and then
let the card fall back again. If the conditions w ere not general
extra-sensory perception but pure clairvoyance, the agent
w ould m erely point to or touch the back of the indicated
card. T h e percipient in the adjacent room recorded his guess
and said aloud “ R ight” , whereupon the second trial pro-
ceeded. A fter 50 trials the assistant w ent to the agent’s end
o f the table, tum ed over the five animal-cards and recorded
the code thus : J? ^ ^ ^ T h e percipient usually recorded
P E Z L G
his guesses b y putting down the initial letter of the anim al
guessed. A fter about 400 trials his score cards were decoded
into numbers, and these were compared w ith the assistants
table of random numbers.
B y this procedure it w ill be obvious that both criticisms
are met. In particular, the assistant who signais the various
trials to the percipient does not know w hat anim al-picture
the agent is looking at.
I shall now refer briefly to some of the m any and varied
experiments w hich Soal and his collaborators m ade w ith
M rs. Stewart, who, in a total of 17,000 trials, averaged a
correct score of 7 out of 25.
It was easily possible, unknown to the percipient, to alter-
nate blocks of 50 trials under general extra-sensory condi­
tions w ith blocks under pure clairvoyant conditions. T w o
o f D r. Soal's best scorers under G .E.S.P. conditions in-
variably failed to score above chance under clairvoyant con­
ditions. T heir ÿr-faculty was essentially telepathoic in its
character. In this respect it contrasted w ith some of D r.
R hine’s best scorers, and w ith Miss G. J., w ho worked w ith
G . N . M . Tyrrell.
In one of the experiments in which M rs. Stew art was
P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
24
percipient, the agent was instructed, just before the expéri­
menta to turn over the five animal-cards and look at them for
30 seconds before turning them face downwards again. H e
was to make no effort to remember the order o f the five
cards; he was merely to look at them. In the experiment,
when the assistant presented a number at the aperture in the
screen, the agent was m erely to tap the back of the animal-
card indicated. The success of scoring was not apparently
dimimshed by this procedure, nor was it afîected when the
agent5
s preview of the cards was reduced tO' 5 seconds. For a
correct guess by the percipient, obviously two pièces of in­
formation were necessary : the order of the animal-cards,
and the number of the card chosen (counting from the left).
T h e first of these pièces o f information was in the subcon-
scious mind of the agent already. This resuit suggests
strongly that it îs not necessary for the agent to retain in his
consaous mind information he desires to transm it tele-
pathically. T he popular idea that some intense effort of
conscious concentration is essential to success m ay be quite
ill-founded.
In another experiment w ith Mrs. Stewart, two agents were
used. O ne of these, sitting behind the screen at the aperture
of which random numbers were presented, had five blank
cards in a row. O n présentation of a number he m erely
tapped the corresponding card. T h e second agent was in
another room, and he had the five anim al-cards in a row, at
which he was instructed to look for 30 seconds prior to the
experiment. The two pièces of inform ation essential to a
correct guess were thus in different minds. Again, the degree
of success scarcely differed from the normal. W ere the two
pièces of information first brought together by M rs. Stewart
or by one of the agents, or is the best viewpom t that a com-
mon subconscious mental field existed ?
In one of the above experiments the following variation
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 25
was tried. For 200 trials Mrs. Stew art was given the impres­
sion that there was only one agent (i.e. that the agen t at the
table receiving the random numbers was in possession of the
animal-cards). For the next 200 trials she was^ however,
given the true impression (that the tw o agents w ere mvolved).
In the first part M rs. Stewart’s score was a little below
chance expectation. In the second part she scored 60 correct
(compared with a chance expectation of 40). C le a rly a cor­
rect orientation to the conditions o f the experim ent is
necessary.
T h é o r ie s o f ^-f a c u l t y
L et us consider telepathy, in the first instance, and ask
ourselves if w e hâve any dues to its nature. O n e possible
type of theory would be that it is the product o f an unrecog-
nised type of electro-magnetic radiation— a kind o f cérébral
radio. Such a view is seen to be impossible as soon as it is
critically examined— and for three reasons :
(1a) T h e electrom agnetic type o f radiation Implies a
m aterial transmitter and receiver w orking on well-recognised
principles. There are no such mechanisms known in the
human body. (b) T h e well-known la w that th e intensity of
radiation falls off inversely as the square o f distance from
the source is incom patible w ith the experimental evidence
that, so far as w e know, telepathy is unafiFected b y distance.
(c) AU mechanisms o f com m unicating ideas to each other,
using m aterial means, such as speakîng or w riting o r tele-
graphy or the Braille code, require the ideas to b e first
encoded (in words, usually), then transmitted and finally
decoded. T h e possibility of being understood then dépends
on two persons using the same alphabet and know ing the
same language. N o one has ever heard of any encoding or
decoding o f ideas where; by hypothesis, the channels o f sense
are not involved.
26 P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
Thouless and Wiesner hâve advanced w hat m ight be
called a psycho-physical theory of telepathy. Suppose w e
call A the agent and P the percipient. W e know that A ’s
mind is intimately related to A ’s brain. It conveys ideas
leading to action to the m otor side o f the brain, and it
receives sensory data leading to ideas from the sensory side
of the brain. The same remarks apply to P. If A ’s m ind
acquired a temporary relation to P ’s motor-brain of the
same kind as it had to its own motor-brain, this would be
called by Thouless and Wiesner ^-telepathy. Alternatively,
the mind of P m ight acquire a tem porary relationship to the
sensory side of A ’s brain of the same kind as it has to its own
sensory brain, which would be called y-telepathy. T h e m erit
of such a theory is that it explains telepathy in terms of the
mmd-brain relationship, w hich is fam iliar to us even though
mysterious I personally think that w hile some phenom ena
m ay possibly be explained in terms of this theory, telepathy
is not one of these. I shall not enter into reasons for this, but
mention only that they are based upon a study of spon-
taneous cases.
W e are then left w ith a purely m ental theory of telepathy,
viz. that it is a mind-to-mind relationship. T h at inclividual
minds manifest in a “ network” of relationships is, I think,
highly probable on the evidence we hâve before us. T h a t
the only modes of communication between minds should be
such indirect methods as speech, writing, and signalling
would, I think, hâve always been regarded as an unreason-
able supposition had it not been for the (now obsolète)
théories of the causal dependence of m ind on brain. N o
similes should be pressed far in attem pting to convey w hat
we understand by a mind-to-mind relationship, since these
are very crude and imperfect. In a network where the inter­
sections or knots represent individuals, a displacement m ay
spread out from one point and in some degree affect ail
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 2 J
others. In a railw ay System the m ain cities m ay represent a
group of minds w hich are intim ately related by their charac-
ter and affimty, and on these lmes of com munication there
m ay be m uch traffic both ways. But the m ore rem ote towns
and villages are part of the whole System of relationships,
and w ith these there are also lines of com munication even
though little used. Again, w e m ay picture the em ergence of
îsland peaks (individual minds) from the sea of matter, w ith
the knowledge that the îslands are ail emergent from the
submarine land-mass (the collective unconscious of J u n g 0)
W e m ight even picture custom ary means of com m unication
between îslands as seabcrne traffic, w hile recognising the
possibility of other extra-sensory com munication via the sub­
m arine land-mass— so that a tremor on one island spreads
out and îs felt on the others. W e would stress again that such
picturesque modes of thm km g are not to be taken too
seriously, but m ay serve to convey an impression o f the right
kind in this obscure field.
Garington accepts a purely m ental theory of telepathy,
but in a spécial form w hich he based upon the psychological
fact of the association of ideas. It is w ell recognised that if
in an individual m ind two ideas, say A and B, are linked
together, then the subséquent présentation of B to conscious-
ness makes it likely that A also w ill emerge. Carington’s idea,
simply stated, is that the présentation of B to another per-
son’s mind w ill resuit in an increased likelihood of A emerg-
ing in that m ind also.
O n such a view telepathy w ould be expected to take place
more freely between persons w ho hâve a large num ber of
ideas in common. In card experiments perhaps the “idea of
experimenting” is such a common “B-idea” , but in m any
of the spontaneous cases the nam ing of the com mon associa-
tional link is difficult and often seems far-fetched. I think
that the psychological mechanism o f idea-association m ay
28 PS Y C H X C A L R E S E A R C H
affect the mode of emergence into consciousness o f tele-
pathically communicated ideas. It is, however, too small a
base on which to build a satisfactory theory of telepathy,
which fundam entally involves a relationship between minds
at unconscious levels. W e do not know enough as yet to
formulate such a theory, but we do know that the télépathie
affinities between different minds differ w idely I do not
know of any work correlating these degrees of affinity w ith
the number and type of ideas held in common.
T he Pro blem o f C l a ir v o y a n c e
T he problem of clairvoyance seems at first sight to présent
real difficulties, for here w e hâve the appréhension b y a
mind of something different in kind, viz. w hat the plain m an
calls “m atter”. This basic assumption (following Descartes)
of two orders of phenomena is the background of the plain
man’s thinking, and since this book is written for ordinary
people— not philosophers— we shall adopt it here and look
at clairvoyance with this background. T h e most useful
working hypothesis is, then, that there is a “substance” —
which we m ay label perhaps a “psychic æther5
5 w hich is
intermediate between m atter and mind. This must partake
of some of the qualities of m atter such as the occupation of
space and a degree of permanence of form, and it m ust also
hâve qualities akin to m ind in sustaining and carrying
émotions and thought-images. This psychic æther is m allé­
able and moulded b y m atter so that it forms w hat m ight be
called æthenc duplicates. A truer statement would perhaps
be that the ætheric duplicate is the m odel on w hich the
material structure is condensed. It is this æ thenc duplicate
which the mind apprehends in clairvoyance and through
which it manipulâtes m atter in psycho-kinesis (see C hapter
V), and in matérialisation phenomena (see Chapter V I). O n
the other hand, the psychic æther linked w ith a m aterial
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 29
object can be im pregnated w ith m ental characteristics, i.e.
w ith em otionally toned ideas. T h e appréhension of this by
a sensitive’s m ind m ay be regarded as the basis o f “ object-
reading” (see Ghapter IV ); or, if there is an intense concen­
tration of emotional energy, it m ay be the basis o f hauntings
(see Ghapter V II), and in certain spécial cases of poltergeist
phenomena (see Chapter V). This hypothesis o f a psychic
æther is a unifying one o f considérable range and pow er; it
bridges the gap between m atter and m ind, and becomes a
convenient vehicle for interpreting ail these para-norm al
phenomena.
In the case of M an himself, we should anticipate a com-
plicated vehicle interm ediate between m an’s body and m an’s
mind*— for the psychic æther w hich stands in this spécial
relationship is m oulded to the physical body, and also the
fiinctional bridge or piece of mechanism w hich allows body
and m ind to interact. T here is, indeed, a persistent tradition
in ancient H indu and E gyptian literature o f a “vital” or
ætheric body,1 and the same idea is found in m uch occult
writing— w hich purports to be the fruit o f intuitive know­
ledge, or at least o f the exercise o f para-norm al faculty. For
m y own part, I regard it as a useful and reasonable
hypothesis likely to prove of increasing value in relation to
psychical research and an understanding of the com plex field
of m an’s ow n nature. I think it is in this région of an ætheric
body that w e shall find d ues to a deeper understanding of
such varied phenomena as healing b y the use of the hands,
mesmerism, the nature o f some types of insanity, water-
divining, m agic, and, indeed, to m any basîc biological
phenomena. I think w e m ay corne to find the hypothesis of
a psychic æther as useful as the hypothesis of m atter in
clarifying the description of phenomena and in suggesting
new directions for experimental enquiry.

Perhaps the reader is a little shocked at m y regarding the
existence of m atter as a hypothesis. H e m ay regard it as
indisputable. This is one o f the points at which the ordinary
common-sense viewpoint differs w idely from the philoso­
pher^ view. It would take us too far afield to justify this
statement— indeed, it would plunge us into that difficult
branch of study called metaphysics. W hen w e look below
the surface of things and ask such questions as how w e corne
to know things and what is the relation between sense-data
and objects of knowledge, we corne to réalisé that the plain
man’s view is far from satisfactory. M an y of us are com-
pelled to recognise that if m atter in some useful sense exists,
it is of the nature of mind or a product of mind. W hen one
cornes to this position, it becomes clear that the hypothesis of
a psychic æther has no better status than that of m atter—
although it m ay be a useful aid to clear exposition and
fruitful thought in this domain of enquiry.
^-FACULTY IN NATURE
W hile the m ajority of observations of ^-faculty are on
the human level, it is reasonable to look for evidence o f its
operation on sub-human levels. This is obviously a fïeld
where a good deal of research should be xlone, but indica­
tions of its existence at this level are not lacking. T h e sensi-
bility of a good sheep-dog to the shepherd’s whistle suggests
a measure of rapport between the m ind of the dog and his
master, T h at the whistle alone accounts for the intelligence
of the dog*s actions will seem to m any an inadéquate ex-
planation. W holly on the sub-human level, w e hâve the
sudden déviation of shoals of minnows, the wheeling of
flocks of birds, the simultaneous action of myriads o f fire-
flies, the apparently purposive and co-ordinated action of
insect communities (bees, ants, termites, etc.). These
phenomena lead us to speculate w hether in fact there is not
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 31
something akin here to a group-m ind controlling the whole
as a unit— a kind of m ental field w hich conform s the
behaviour o f individual units to the pattern through a kind
of ^-faculty. W ith rise in the evolutionary scale w e find, of
course, a grow ing ability to départ from the controlling field
and create distinctive individual patterns of behaviour. This
w e find in domestic animais. T h e problems o f bird m igration
and their seemingly intelligent behaviour, the route-finding
and the timing, suggest again the exercise b y a group-m ind
of r^-faculty closely allied to w hat w e hâve labelled as
clairvoyance and precognition.
T h e study of prim itive peoples from this particular stand-
point is likely to be fruitful in its data. Trustw orthy observers
hâve reported the spreadingof news am ong prim itive peoples
w ith a rapidity inexplicable b y any ordinary means. It w ould
seem plausible to suggest that here individuals can m ake
easy contact w ith the prim itive group m ind from w hich they
are less insulated than m ore advanced peoples. D r. John
L ayard tells o f “prim itive peoples w ho quite suddenly w ill
ail act of one accord w ith no visible or audible cause” (Proc.
S.P.R., V ol. X L V I I , p. 239, 1944).
D r. L ayard says :
“ I instanced the other day the case o f the anthropologist
accom panied b y a native in the depths o f the A frican bush
when distant drums were suddenly heard, whereon the
native fell on his face saying : £
T h e C h ief o f So-and-so is
dead/ T h e anthropologist thought, ‘N ow I shall be able to
solve the riddle o f drum-signals’, and asked his com panion
just w hat rhythm it was that had given this very précisé
inform ation. T h e native looked wonderingly at him . T h e
anthropologist insisted, but m et w ith an uncom prehend-
ing gaze. It finally transpired that the drum-signal was a
perfectly common-or-garden one, sim ply telling the native
32 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
to internalise his attention, whereupon the native had seen
the im age of the ch iefs dead face conveyed not through
the cérébro-spinal system, but, as I believe, through the
sympathetic nervous System through which as w ith the
insects this form of communication occurs.”
It is quite clear that the biological field and the abundant
data of natural history should provide one of the most in-
teresting areas of enquiry m relation to t/
/
. W hen w e reflect
upon the amazing behaviour patterns— of the web-spinning
spider doing something in a novel situation without tutorial
assistance or practice; of créatures of a low ly order prepar-
ing a food supply essential to the welfare of a future progeny
which they will never see— w e hâve in these concepts of
psychical research dues to biological mysteries which are far
more promising than the naïve supposition of inheritable
brain tracks. Frofessor A. G. H ardy, F.R .S., of O xford, has
recently m ade such exploratory incursions into this field
(Journ. S.P.R., p. 225, 1950; Proc. S.P.R., p. 96, 1953).
So m e R e fle g tio n s an d Sp éc u l a t io n s
I am convinced, after studying a représentative part of
the enormous mass of recorded evidence, that ^-faculty—
including telepathy, clairvoyance, and precognition— is an
established fact. T h e wealth of observation, the variety of
experiment, the précautions taken to exclude fraud, and the
abundant criticisms of experimental work which hâve been
reasonably met are such as to establish these things w ith the
same confidence as that which is given to the foundations of
other basic sciences. W hen we start to reflect on the im plica­
tions of ^-faculty, it becomes apparent that here is an order
of phenomena with its own laws, and that a deeper under-
standing of these m ay revolutiomse our outlook on the world
around us. T h e conception of a psychic æther— even though
T E L E P A T H Y A N D C L A I R V O Y A N C E 33
from a m etaphysical standpoint it has no better status than
the concept of “m atter”-— opens to us a new w orld of sig-
nificant energies and forces w hich w ill profoundly affect
m any fields of scientific enquiry— hiology, physiology, psy-
chology, and philosophy. It seems obvious that the old
scientific m aterialism is com pletely underm ined.
T h e fact that minds m ay be in com m unication w hen the
brains to w hich those minds are related are thousands of
miles apart throws into a new perspective any théories o f
m ind and brain, and suggests, even if it does not prove, that
m ind has no causal dependence on brain. Bergson holds the
view that the physical brain is prim arily an organ of action,
and that perception serves the practical purpose o f guiding
action. As a means of gathering knowledge, he believes the
function of the brain is secondary; suçh knowledge could be
gathered otherwise b y the m ind. T h e brain is, in fact, an
organ of lim itation so far as the m ind is concerned, focusing
the latter’s attention on to the m aterial environment. It is
only in certain States w hen the close Hnkage o f m ind and
brain is loosened that the w ider ^-faculties o f the m ind
becom e apparent.
T h e question is sometimes raised as to whether ^-faculty,
by reason of its greater accessibility to prim itive peoples and
the greater part w hich it plays on the sub-human level, is
not a submerged or even vestigial faculty overlaid b y th e
grow th in im portance of the brain and spécial senses. Som e
hâve taken this view, and rem arked on the vastly greater
reliability and précision o f the spécial senses for know ledge
of the im médiate environment. Others havetended to regard
^-faculty as an extension of the m ind’s awareness in a
“ higher” direction, and look upon it as something whose
developm ent m ight m ake available to us knowledge and
understanding far beyond the range of sensorily acquired
knowledge.
P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H

I incline to the opinion that both views are right but that
the assumption that these views refer to the same thing is
wrong. Itm ayprove necessary to define lower-^ and higher-^
modes of communication concerned respectively w ith the
ætheric level and the higher-mind. T h e first of these has
perhaps been submerged in the évolution of man ; the second
of these m ay prove his gatew ay to greater knowledge and
insight.
It should perhaps be unnecessary to say that the field of
psychical research has no more to do w ith religion or w ith
a “spiritual” world than has physics or physiology. This
idea is, however, not uncommon, and it dérivés, I suppose,
from the naïve assumption that w hat is non-m aterial is ipso
facto “spiritual” . T he fact is that there are m any significant
levels of phenomena lying behind the superficial one w hich
we call physical and to which our senses respond. T h e région
of psychical research is not far removed from the physical,
and extends through the level we hâve labelled “ætheric” up
to that of mind. But beyond higher-mind lie ranges of greater
significance, and it is into these more sublime régions that
we must penetrate if w e are concerned w ith spiritual things
and the values of life.

A N w e hâve knowledge of the future? T here are of
course m any examples of reliable prédiction, such as of
future éclipsés or times of high tide at a particular place, but
these are ail based upon observation o f past sequences o f
events. W e are interested not in these but in prédiction or
foreknowledge w hich cannot be based upon the past and
therefore w here rational inference is not involved. T h ere
must be few people w ho hâve not corne across sortie instance
of prophecy or “ second-sight” , or some fragm ent of a dream -

on the “ coincidence” , but few are disposed to consider
seriously that there m ay be a détermina te future w hich under
certain circumstances m ay becom e known, for if there were
it would seem that the existence of free-will is in jeopardy.
O u r first concern therefore is to look at typical data w hich
conform to the following conditions :
i. A n ostensible precognition or piece of foreknowledge
should hâve been recorded in w riting and handed on to
someone else, or told verbally to someone, or acted upon in
a significant manner, before the subséquent incident vérifiés
it.
2. It should either be sufficiently detailed or unusual in its
character to m ake chance coincidence unlikely.

attending the Duke of Hamilton, and it is countersigned by
the Duchess of Hamilton.
tcA fortnight before the death of the late Earl of L., in
1882, I called upon the D uke of Ham ilton, in H ill Street,
to see him professionally. A fter I had finished seeing him
we went into the drawing-room, where the Duchess was,
and the D uke said to me, cOh, Cooper; how is the E arl?’
“T he Duchess said, £
W hat E arl?’ and on m y answering
‘Lord L .’, she replied, ‘T hat is very odd. I hâve had a most
extraordinary vision. I went to bed, but after being in bed
a short time, I was not exactly asleep, but thought I saw
a scene as if from a play before me. T h e actors m it were
Lord L., in a chair, as if in a fit, with a m an standing over
him with a red beard. H e was by the side of a bath, over
which bath a red lamp was distinctly shown.’
“ I then said, ‘I am attending Lord L. at présent,* thereis
very little the matter w ith him , he is not going to die; he
will be ail right very soon.’
“ Well, he got better for a week and was nearly well, but
at the end of six or seven days after this I was called to see
him suddenly. H e had inflammation of both lungs.
“ I called in Sir W illiam Jenner, but in six days he was
a dead man. There were two m ale nurses attending on
him; one hadbeen taken ill. But when I saw the other the
dream of the Duchess was exactly represented. H e was
standing near a bath over the Earl and, strange to say, his
beard was red. There was the bath w ith the red lamp over
it. It is rather rare to find a bath w ith a red lamp over it,
and this broughtthe story tom ym ind.
“T h e vision seen by the Duchess w as told tw o weeks
before the death o f Lord L . It is a most rem arkable
thing.”
It appears that the Duchess only knew Lord L. b y sight
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O G O G N ï T I O N 37
and had not heard that he was ill. She knew she was not
asleep, for she opened her eyes to get rid of the vision and,
shuttmg them, saw the same thing again.
Case 6 (from Foreknowledge, pp. 64-5 : H . F. Saltm arsh.

“ In 1928 he [Mr. Galder] was appointed headm aster of
H olm forth Secondary School in Yorkshire. Before leaving
M iddlesex, where they then resided, Mrs. Galder, w ho had
never been to Yorkshire, dream ed of an old grey-stone
house, set in a lovely valley through w hich ran a stream
of clear but black-looking water. In their househuntm g
near H olm forth they cam e across the very house w hich
M rs. Galder had seen in her dream ; they took it, orrath er
one half of it, and m oved in in A ugust 1928. T h ey found
that the water of the stream was frequently discoloured
by indigo from a nearby dye-worlcs. In her dream M rs.
Galder had seen that only one half of the house was
occupied, and that outside the door of that h alf was a
barrel w hich was used as a dog-kennel. W hen they w ent to
live there, though the other half was occupied, there was
no barrel. A year or so later there was a change of tenants
of the other half of the house. W hen the new people
arrived they brought w ith them a dog and placed a barrel
outside the door for îts kennel.”
Case y (from An Experiment with Time: J. W . D onne.
A . & G. Black Ltd., 1927):
“ I seemed to be standing on high ground— the upper
slopes of some spur of a hill or mountain. T h e ground
was of a cunous w hite formation. H ere and there m this
were little fissures, and from these jets of vapour were
spouting upward. In m y dream I recognised the place as
an island of w hich I had dreamed before— an island w hich
was in im minent péril from a volcano. And, when I saw
the vapour spouting from the ground, I gasped, T t’s the

island ! Good Lord, the whole thing is going to blow up !5
For I had memories of reading about Krakatoa, where
the sea, making its w ay into the heart of a volcano through
a submarine crevice, flushed into steam and blew the
whole mountain to pièces. Forthwith I was seized w ith a
frantic desire to save the four thousand (I knew the num-
ber) unsuspecting inhabitants. O bviously there was only
one w ay of doing this, and that was to take them off in
ships. There followed a most distressing nightmare, in
which î was at a neighbounng island, trying to get the
incredulous French authorities to despatch vessels of every
and any description to remove the inhabitants o f the
threatened island. I was sent from one official to another;
and finally woke myself by m y own dream exertions,
ciinging to the heads of a team of horses drawing the
carriage of one c
M onsieur le M aire5, w ho was going out
to dine, and wanted m e to return when his office would
be open next day. AU through the dream the number of
the people in danger obsessed m y m ind. I repeated it to
everyone I met, and, at the moment of waking, I was
shouting to the 'M aire5

There is one rem ark to be m ade here.
“ T h e num ber of people declared to b e killed was not, as
I had m aintained throughout the dream, 4,000 but 40,000.
I was out b y a nought. But, w hen I read the paper, I read,
in m y haste, that num ber as 4,000; and in telling the story
subsequently, I alw ays spoke of that printed figure as
having been 4,000; and I did not know it was really
40,000 until I copied out the paragraph fifteen years later.
“N ow , when the next batch of papers arrived, these
gave m ore exact estimâtes o f w hat the actual loss of life
had been; and I discovered that the true figure had
nothing in com mon w ith the arrangem ent of fours and

that its wrongness w as likely to prove a m atter just as

Case 8 (from Supernormal Faculties in Man, p. 175 :
E u g èn e O s t y . M ethuen & Co., 1923).
D r. Eugène O sty, w ho devoted tweive years to the in ­
tensive study of sensitives— several o f whom had quite
exceptional powers o f precognition— gives two prédictions
m ade in relation to his own life. T h e first of these, given two
years before the event w hich fulfilled it, was as follows :
“ O h ! Péril of death after a w hile . . . perhaps an acci­
dent . . . but you w ill be saved, your life continues.. . .5
Î
Four months prior to the event m ore detail is given :
“ T ake care, you w ill soon hâve a serious a ccid e n t.. . . I
hear a violent shock . . . a loud n o ise.. . . Y o u w ill be very
near death. . . . W hat luck ! you w ill take no hurt ! I see a

man bleeding on the ground ; he is moaning, and ail round
him some things are strew n,1 can’t say w hat.”
Dr. O sty’s account of the event itself on August 15$!,
1911,1s :
“ I was going at an easy pace in m y car, when a drunken
baker, driving furiously, pulled the w rong rein and col-
lided. T he shock was such that the shafts, which struck
the frame of the front glass, were shivered to pièces, and
one wheel mounted the bonnet and crushed it in. M y
friend Th. Stenuit, who was with me, and I also, were
stricken with amaze at the suddenness of the accident
and our good fortune in being unhurt. T u m in g round w e
saw the horse galloping off, the cart in the ditch, wheels
uppermost, and the baker stretched m oaning and bleeding
in the m iddle of the road w ith a num ber of loaves scat-
teredround h im ”
Case g (from Proc. S.P.R., V ol. X I, p. 488) ;
“Mrs. G. dreamed that she was being persistently
followed by a monkey, and this terrified her as she par-
ticularly disliked monkeys. A t breakfast, being unable to
throw off the unpleasant memories, her husband suggested
she should go out for a walk with the children. She
adopted this unusual course, and to her horror— in the
streets of London— was followed by a m onkey.”
It would be possible to fill a book with stories of this kind,
which fulfil the two conditions mentioned. T b appreciate the
real weight of evidence a serious student of the subject
should be willing to read some of the works m entioned at
the end of this chapter.
In examining cases of ostensible precognition, we should
fïrst discard those which can be accounted for on any other
P R E G O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O C O G N I T I O N 41
ground. Suppose, for example, a person dreams of receivm g
a letter from someone who has not com m um cated for some
years, and the next day such a letter is received. W e m ight
possibly account for this b y telepathy between the writer and
the récipient, or by clairvoyance on the part o f the récipient
of the letter then in existence. In Case 6 above w e m ight
regard the dream -view of the house, which was already in
existence in another place, as an exercise of clairvoyant
faculty by M rs. Calder. T h e “barrel” incident, however,
seems undoubtedly precogm tive.
Cases where suggestion or auto-suggestion m ight hâve
opérated as a cause must be view ed with great reserve. For
example, w here a person foresees his own death or a serious
illness com ing in spite of apparent good health, auto­
suggestion m ight conceivably be operatm g towards the fulfil-
ment.
Again, consider the case below :
Case io (ïxomProc. S.P.R., V o l X , p. 332) :
“Being at length tired, I sat down to rest upon a rock
at the edge of the water. M y attention was quite taken up
w ith the extreme beauty of the scene before me. There
was not a sound or m ovement except the soft n p ple of
water on the sand at m y feet. Presently I felt a cold chill
creep through me, and a curious stiffness o f m y limbs, as
if I could not move though wishmg to do so. I felt
frightened, yet cham ed to the spot, and as if im pelled to
stare at the water straight in front o f me. G radually a
black cloud seemed to nse, and in the midst of it I saw a
tall man, in a suit of tweed, jum p into the w ater and sink.
“ In a moment the darkness was gone, and I again
becam e sensible of the heat and sunshine, but I was awed
and felt eerie— it was then about four o’clock or so— I
cannot remember either the exact time or date. O n m y

sister’s arrivai I told her of the occurrence; she was sur­
prise^ but inclined to laugh at it. W hen w e got home I
told m y brother; he treated the subject m uch in the same
manner. However, about a week afterwards a M r. Espie,
a bank clerk (unknown to me), committed suicide by
drowning in that very spot H e left a letter for his wife,
indicating that he had for sonie time contem plated his
death. M y sister’s memory of the event is the only evidence
I can give. I did not see the account o f the inquest at the
time, and did not mention m y strange expérience to any-
one saving m y sister and brother.”
Here we must allow for the possibility o f the bank clerk’s
intention being communicated telepathically to M rs.
Alpine’s subconscious mind, and rising into consciousness
through a visual vehicle, containing, however, some symbolic
éléments.
W e shall discuss some of this case m aterial later in trying
to find a theory of precognition.
E x per im en ta l E v id e n c e
It will be quite obvious that the experim ental card tech-
nique used in the investigation o f extra-sensory perception
is adaptable to détermine the possibility of precognition.
T h e simplest experiment would be to invite a percipient to
write down the order of the cards as they will be in a pack
which is to be shuffled in ten minutes’ time. This type of
experiment has given results w ith some sensitives quite out-
side the range of chance as an explanation. Even w hen the
pack is shuffled by m echanical means and subsequently eut
in a m anner determined by chance, the scoring remains
significant !
W e hâve described briefly in the last chapter Tyxreirs
work w ith G. J. In some of this work, he could, b y pressing
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O C O G N I T I O N 43
a switch, put a relay into the circuit. O n e of the lamps was
preselected b y a chance method, but it was not actually lit
until the relay worked, and the latter was operated b y the
fîrst lid opened. T h e percipient did not necessarily know
whether the relay was in action or not. In 1,845 trials with-
out the relay, 28-6 per cent, were scored correct; in 1,855
trials w ith the relay, 26*2 per cent, were scored correct. In
the second case it is clear that a faculty of precognitive
clairvoyance is involved— for the lamp was not lit at the
time the choice was made.
T h e experim ental work of D r. S. G. Soal and M rs. Gold-
ney is of particular value in relation to precognition. D r.
Soal had investigated about 160 persons, hoping to confirm
Rhine’s general results, but w ithout appréciable success. A t
the suggestion of W hately Carington he exam ined his files
of data again, looking for the possibility that some o f these
persons were scoring— not on the contem porary card, bu t on
the card one ahead (or on the card one behind) in time. W e
call these for brevity the + 1 and the — 1 cards. T w o o f the
160 were found to be scoring fa r beyond chance expectation,
sometimes on the -f 1 card and sometimes on the — 1 card.
Extensive experiments were later m ade w ith these two per­
sons. M r. Shackleton’s faculty appeared to be a displacement
o f E.S.P. in time, either forwards or backwards b y 2% to 3
seconds, for when the rate o f calling of the cards was in-
creased to one call every i£ seconds, he scored on the + 2 or
— 2 cards. O n the other hand, if the rate of calling was
slowed down to one call in 5 seconds, he only scored at the
chance level.
T h e other unusual scorer was M rs. Stewart, and her
faculty showed some different but interesting features.
W hereas in 1936 she had shown the 4 -1 and — 1 displace­
m ent effects, in 1945 ^er faculty had shifted on to the con­
tem porary card. She was able through 17,000 trials to score
P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
44
on an average 7 correct ont of 25 as comparée! w ith the
chance expectation of 5. Subsequently there slowly
developed m Mrs. Stewart a new and surprising effect, viz. a
significant deficiency (i.e. scoring belom the chance level) on
+ 1 card. This of course is as remarkable as scoring in excess
of chance, and indicates para-normal awareness of the + 1
card. Dr. Soal surmised that perhaps M rs. Stewart’s subcon-
scious mind resented M r. Shackleton’s réputation, w hich
was built up on his high scoring on the -f 1 card !
Experiment showed that w ith both these persons the
faculty was exclusively télépathie in its character, and not
also clairvoyant, as with G. J and m any of Rhine’s workers.
T he evidence for precognition would be incomplète with-
out mention of W hately Carington’s sériés o f group-experi-
ments which took place over several years. A large number
of collaborators in different parts of the country w ere each
supplied with ten forms, Ten experiments took place on ten
successive nights. Each evening Garington selected a con­
crète object, m ade a drawing of it, and pinned this up in his
study from 7 p.m. to 9.30 a.m. T h e percipients had to draw
what they believed each target to be and forward it to
Garington. Garington’s choice of an object was determined
by the chance process of opening m athem atical tables at
random and using this to détermine at w hat page a
dictionary should be opened. T h e first concrète object was
selected. In comparing drawings w ith the original targets,
the problem of degree o f resemblance always arises in assess-
ing whether it is a “hit” or a “miss” . T he statistical analysis
used was such that whether the judgm ent was too rigorous
or too lax did not matter. W e shall not go into detail about
these methods, but refer to the significant conclusions. H e
found that as the occasion of display o f a target was
approached the proportion of ostensible hits on the target
began to rise, reaching a maximum at the tim e of its display,
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O G O G N I T I O N 45
and falling off gradually after this occasion. T h e incline
towards the m axim um indicates appréciable precognition of
a target w hich had not then been chosen— but w hich w ould
be chosen b y a chance m ethod 48 hours or 24 hours later î
T h e décliné after the m axim um indicates appréciable
retrocognition. T h e latter is always viewed o f course w ith
less surprise, for an explanation might be that the product
of ^-faculty was received contemporaneously w ith exhibition
of the target picture, but was delayed in its em erging into
consciousness. In general, it must be adm itted that group-
experiments are seldom successful, and Carington’s experi-
ments are therefore the m ore notable.
D is c u s s io n o f t h e Pr o b l e m s
It w ould be possible to continue giving examples of pre­
cognition, both from the field of experimental work and
from the records of spontaneous occurrences. I w ould em-
phasise again that the serious student w ho wants to be con-
vinced of the phenomenon itself should read some o f the
books devoted to it. T h e distinguished physiologist Charles
Richet, at the end o f thirty years of careful enquiry, was
prepared to say, “ Precognition is a demonstrated verity. It is
a strange, paradoxical and seemingly absurd fact, but one
that we are com pelled to admit. . . . T h e explanation w ill
corne (or w ill not corne) later. T h e facts are none the less
authentic and undeniable.” I think that most, if not ail those
w ho are prepared to read and study tho data w ill be driven
to the same conclusion. In the strange field o f psychical
phenom ena it is not a question as to w hat w e should wish
to find or wish not to find— but what are the facts.
W e shall proceed on the assumption that precognition is
accepted. Readers of O sty’s book will find scores of
examples o f the faculty exemplified in Case 8. Some sensi­
tives seem able to achieve a km d of télépathie rapport w ith a
P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
46
very deep level of the subject’s self— a level which w e m ay
label “ transcendental” , to which the pattern of events w hich
will happen to the physical self is an open book. It looks as
if to this transcendental level of each individual, the distinc­
tion of past, présent, and future, which is so clear-cut for
the superficial self, has no marked existence. O ne is inclined
to consider that the transcendental self has substantially laid
down a pattern of events through w hich the superficial self
must pass. T h e former is architect and builder of the rési­
dence; one is disposed to add that it also chooses the fum -
ishings. T he superficial self can apparently do little more
on the physical level than make slight rearrangements o f the
fum iture provided. Its significant activity is, however, the
quality of life which it lives within this setting.
As we meditate upon life our prédisposition m ay be to
accept without surprise the broad pattern— the pattern in
outline, K e y points of the pattern, such as Case 8 illustrâtes,
perhaps do not surprise us by their existence; but the exist­
ence of the trivial detail, such as the barrel of Case 6 and the
monkey of Case 9, cornes to us w ilh rather a shock. It does
not look like a bare house which is offered to the superficial
self, but a fully furnished one— with no option.
T he sensitives with whom Dr. O sty was fortunate in
working appeared to hâve had in an unusual degree a
capacity for rapport with an individual’s transcendental self.
O f most sensitives it can be said that their rapport isi m uch
more likely to be w ith the more superficial levels of the m ind
of the individual. As a conséquence of this, it is often fears,
hopes, memories, and desires w hich are withdrawn b y the
thought-reading process from an individual’s mind. Such
data are then re-presented to an individual b y a sensitive
who is in a trance, and this is the com m onplace expérience of
seance rooms, both public and private. It must be emphasised
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O G O G N I T I O N 47
that the first-class sensitive w ho is aware of the level of rap­
port is very rare indeed. M oreover, it must be remembered
that a good sensitive m ay be able to achieve a recognised
rapport w ith the transcendental level of one individual and
fail com pletely w ith another individual. T h e evidence o f Dr.
H ettinger on p. 60 in the next chapter illustrâtes this. M rs.
L . J. Bendit gives a typical, but impressive, illustration o f the
same thing (Payne and Bendit : This World and That,
pp. 158-60. Faber & Faber). She had an astonishing “read-
ing” of her character, work, and interests, together w ith
detailed precognitions w hich were fulfilled in both the near
and more distant future. A friend w ho was w ith her, how-
ever, received nothing except the customary nonsense from
the same sensitive.
In Case 5 the Duchess o f H am ilton is the sensitive, “pick-
ing-up5
5 w ithout any conscious volition a sensational frag­
m ent from Lord L .’s transcendental self. In Case 10 M rs.
Alpine plays a similar part in relation to the bank clerk.
There is some télépathie quality or affinity— even though
w e know nothing of its nature— in virtue of w hich certain
minds can, in varying degrees, be in relationship, while
others cannot achieve this.
I hâve always thought that a good case can be m ade for
the view that precognition is essentially precognitive tele-
pathy, i.e. of either a fragm ent of one5s own future m ental
state or of another person’s future m ental State. Thus in
Case 5 the Duchess’s vision m ay hâve been either of M r.
Cooper’s future m ental state when he would see the drama,
or of her own future m ental state when M r. Cooper told
her subsequently that he had seen it. In Cases 6, 8, and 9
the sensitive’s own future m ental state may hâve been cog-
nised. In Case 7 there is interesting positive evidence that it
was so. H ere Dunne did not precognise the future m aterial
event; it was not precognitive clairvoyance, at any rate as
P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
48
regards the number of lives lost. It was apparently his men­
tal State when readxng the newspaper w hich he precognxsed,
and the partxcularly interestmg feature of thxs is that he
misread the newspaper statement that 40,000 persons were
probably lost and beiieved he had read 4,000. H e did not
discover thxs misreading until going through the papers
some years afterwards. In his preçognitive dream it was the
figure 4,000 which haunted him. T h e W hately Carxngton
experiments could also be regarded as exhibiting on the part
of some percipients a cognition of Carington’s m ental States
one day or two days in advance of their occurring.
Outsxde the possibilxty of interprétation as precognition
of the future mental State of someone is T yrrell’s electrical
apparatus with the automatic recording and the relay work-
ing. T h e preçognitive clairvoyance w hich ostensxbly took
place in this case was, I suppose, of the order of 1 second
It m ay be that experimental precognitions o f this order are
to be accounted for in quite a different w ay from those in-
volvxng time intervals o f days, weeks, and months.
So m e T héories o f Preco g n itio n
It m ay be best to state frankly that no satisfactory theory
of precognition exists. T he problenx of T im e is one of the
most difficult that çonfrçnts philosophers, and these diffi­
cu ltés are not made easier by the fact o f precognition. Pro-
fessor A. N. W hitehead, philosopher and m athem atician,
one o f the most outstanding thinkers of our day, once said :
“ It is impossible to m editate on Tim e and the m ystery of
the créative passage of N ature without an overwhelm ing
émotion at the limitations of human intelligence.” It is safe
to say that in a thousand years’ time, when m any o f the
problems of our physical world which now vex scientists
wxll hâve been resolved or understood as aspects of larger
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O C O G N I T I O N 49
problems, the problem of the nature of Tim e w ill still be de-
bated. T h e reason for this arises in the peculiarly intimate
relationship of our own minds to Tim e. It is rather like ex-
pectm g a crâne, w hich has proved its abihty to lift other
objects, to lift itself. W e shall therefore not be able to do
more than show w hat the difficulties are and how some
thinkers hâve suggested that w e m ight try to overcome them.
W hen the subject of precognition is discussed, we always
become m volved m three different, though not unrelated,
problems. (i) T h e nature of Tim e and the status o f events
in Tim e. (2) T h e problem of free-will and determimsm. (3)
T h e problem of causation, viz. w hat causes the precogmtion.
Expressing it as simply as possible, we m ay say that the
first view regards time as a sort of dimension m w hich ail the
events of history are spaced out at appropnate intervals. T he
events of a person’s life m ight be regarded as the beads
stretched out upon a string. O ne m ight im agine a narrow
siit (with its breadth allowing us to see only one bead at a
time) m oving in the direction o f the string’s length. This slit
corresponds to the “présent” moment. O n the first view of
tim e w hich w e m ay call that o f the “Eternal N ow ” , ail the
events of a lifetime, both those past, those présent, and those
to corne, co-exist. T h ey hâve the same status or degree of
reality. T h e observer looking through the slit only expéri­
ences them m succession because the slit is moving. T h e
other view recognises the past as fixed and unalterable, but
the future as blank and still to be created. It is as though the
beads on the one side of the slit were missing, while on the
other side they were “ there” in some historical sense—
although inaccessible— w hile new ones were being created
within the interval of the slit as it m oved onwards into the
future O n the first of these views, where ail events in some
sense co-exist in time (which w e shall call Tim ej), the m ain
problem w ith w hich w e hâve to deal is that of the existence
P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
50
and m eaning of free-wiil. T h e problem of causation of pre-
cognition of a future event does not seem insoluble, when
we can assume the event is already in existence. O n the
other view of time, where the future is a blank and hence
the precognised event does not yet exist, how can w e hâve
knowledge about it? H ow can a non-existent event be the
cause of présent knowledge? This view préserves a place
for free-will in the créative movement of the slit, but it leaves
the cause of precognition obscure.
There is perhaps a third view of T im e interm ediate be-
tween these two. W e m ay call it the theory of a plastic
future. T h e idea is that there is some kind of a future in
existence in the sense that it would inevitably resuit from
causes existing in the past and présent, provided no new
unpredictable factor is introduced by the exercise of free-
will. It would envisage a precognition as a view of the
future, as it is at the moment of the precognition. Presum-
ably if a new factor is introduced subsequently and another
precognition o f that région o f the future obtained, it would
differ from the first. T h e future is only frozen into its un-
alterable form when it passes through the chilling cham ber
of the présent moment. This view attempts clearly to pré­
serve free-will, and yet hâve some kind of ghost-future which
can be the cause of precognitions. T h e difficulty of this view,
attractive though it is in m any ways, is to m ake precognition
of this ghost-future a very superior kind of inference—
which borders on omniscience. It is not a cognition o f the
future which will be, it is an inference o f the future condi-
tioned by présent factors. O sty seemed to lean towards this
view of a plastic future, and noted that greater précision and
detail were precognised by the sensitive as the event drew
nearer to actualisation. W hen one considers the innumer-
able factors which contribute to any event— such as the
collision of Case 8, for example, or the order of the cards in
P R E G O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O G O G N I T I O N 51
a pack w hich has been placed in a m echanical shuffler— any
process of inference seems ruled out, and a cognisable future
of some kind must therefore exist. Perhaps the chief difficul-
ties arisein our assumptions. W e assume thatphysical events
are physically determined by the law of cause and effect,
and we look back over casual chains of events w ith innumer-
able interlinkings like a network. W e assume, w ith our sense-
centred thinking, that in such a network of m aterial events
are ail the dues— both causes and effects— if only w e could
disentangle them. W hat if the physical pattern of events is
only or chiefly a level o f effects, the product of the out-work-
ing of factors w hich operate on a deeper level— say the level
of M in d? W hat if there is a W orld of M ind, full o f created
possibilities, some of w hich are causal so far as the physical
level is concerned, but w hich d on ot necessarily on their own
level stand in a causal relation to each other ? Perhaps in this
world of M ind, Im agination is the great créative force, and
the created things there are not related in causal chains ? Is
it possible that w e are running down a blind alley in looking
for causal relationships everywhere in the physical scene?
N o one doubts that there is a valid dom ain of such relation­
ships in physics and chemistry, for example, but hâve w e in
our scientific enthusiasm given them a universal application
which they are far from possessing? Perhaps causal relation­
ships hâve only a very lim ited domain on the physical level,
and their really significant and im portant domain is in re-
lating the world of m ind to the physical world.
Such ideas m ay seem heresy or nonsense to the reader of
this book; but if they seem queer, I shall plead that w eh ave
queer data to account for. L et us leave these spéculations
and return to a brief survey of ideas about precognition.
J. W . D unne wrote an interesting and stim ulatm g book in
1927 called An Expériment with Time. H e m ade over m any
P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
52
years a close study of his own dreams and found that occa-
sionally he had dreams of an unusually vivid kind w hich
proved to be substantially precognitive. A part from these he
considered that m any dreams contain fragments and distor-
tions of futunstic material as well as m atenal drawn from
the past. H e adopted the hypothesis of an “Eternal N ow ” —
not as applicable to some transcendental level of R eality,
but as applicable to the physical order. A il events co-exist.
T he Battle of Hastings is still being fought, Brutus is still
stabbmg Cæsar, and our remote ancestors are still hanging
from the trees by their tails— just as m uch as they ever were.
T he string of “bead-events” is ordm ary T im ex. But since w e
can only peer through the slit, we see them only one at a
time. The slit, however, is moving, and to account for this w e
must postulate Tim e2 to time the m ovem ent of the slit in
Tim e!, Then it follows that since Tim e2 is flowmg, w e must
postulate Tim e3 to account for this rate of flow, etc. T he
nature of Tim e éludés us— or as D unne would say— it is an
infinité sériés. W hen we look at the Observer w ho is inter-
ested in the events, w e find that he also comprises an
infinité sériés of observers. Observer! is really the string w ith
the beads. H e is the sum of ail the physical events w hich
hâve happened to him between birth and death. But there is
another aspect of him— Observera w ho looks through the
slit and to whom Tim e2 is related closely, and so on. W hen
philosophers find themselves led to serial concepts, they
usually look again at their basic assumptions to see w hat is
wrong. Dunne, however, conceives of a serial universe, and
develops these ideas. A t this point I believe he is wrong. His
mistake was fundam entally in treating T im e as though it
were a dimension of space. M oreover, if the “Eternal N ow ”
concept is true, I cannot regard its truth as applicable to the
level of physical events. If it is true, it can only, in m y
opinion, hâve relevance to some Timeless State of conscious-
ness— of which w e know nothing.
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O C O G N I T I O N 53
Precognition is not, however, fundam entally difficult to
account for on D unne’s views. Briefly, he considers that the
attention of Observer2 is lim ited to the focus of attention of
Observer!— m the normal w akm g State. If Observer! sleeps,
however, or otherwise relaxes, then the attention of
Observer2 can w ander over an appréciable range of T im el3
w hich m ay include data both m the past and future of
Observer!. In terms of our analogy, the slit m ay widen in
States of sleep or relaxation of O bserver!.
H . F. Saltmarsh has putforw ard a view {Proc. S.P.R., V ol.
X L I I, 1934) of the mechanism of precognition w hich is a
slight variant of D unne’s. T h e “ specious présent5
5 (î.e. the
w idth of the slit in our analogy) is norm ally regarded as a
fraction o f a second for the conscious part of the mind.
Suppose, however, for a deeper level of the subconscious
mind, the “ specious présent5
5 was greater. Then clearly the
latter m ight apprehend a group of events as présent, w hich
so far as the conscious m ind was concerned were partly past,
partly présent, and partly future. If one of the latter was
thrown up m to consciousness, it would be regarded as p re­
cognition. I think this type of theory m ay account for the
card-precognition expenments, where the specious présent of
a subconscious level is perhaps 4 or 5 seconds. It is difficult,
however, to believe that precognitions involvm g days,
months, and even years can be explained in this w ay. It is
difficult— but perhaps this is the w ay w e ought to think:
Suppose that far deeper than this subconscious level with a
specious présent of a few seconds, there is a transcendental
level of the self for which the specious présent is very exten­
sive, if not infinitely w ide? W e hâve then arrived at an
“ Eternal N ow 5
5
— or so it would be described b y the con­
scious part of our minds. I cannot, however, conceive o f it
as a continuum in w hich ail physical events inhere (as
D unne does), but only as a State of consciousness in which
ail im aginable possibilités are inhérent.
P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
5 4
Another type of hypothesis put forward tentatively by
C. D . Broad is a two-dimensional theory o f time {Proc. Ans-
totelian Soc. Supp., Vol. X V I, 1937). I shall not attem pt to
expound it here; it involves some novel ideas. A il I can say
is that no one has so far felt any deep conviction that this is
the key to the mysteries !
In attempting to account for precognition, I hâve else-
where (The Imprisoned Splendour, p. 166. H odder &
Stoughton, 1953) suggested that if ail precognition can be
assimilated to precognitive telepathy, w e are dealing
obviously with a mental sériés of events. W e then hâve a
precognition (P), and at a later point of time the event (E),
which arerelated togetherin some w ay. I speculated on p. 51
that on the level of mind events are perhaps not linked in
causal chains. (Jung’s principle of synchronicity m ay hâve
its roots in this level.) W ithout developing this thought here
— and supposing there is a causal relationship between P and
E — what is its nature? W e should be disposed to reject
completely the suggestion that P causes E. Another possi-
bility is that both P and E are effects, one earlier and one
later, of a common causal ancestor w hich preceded them
both. Thus in Case 10 it is possible that contem plation of
suicide by the bank clerk caused both M rs. Alpine’s precog­
nition and the later event. It is obvious, however, that in
Cases 5 to 9 such an explanation w ill not fit. I hâve there-
fore suggested that E m ay be the cause of P. These are both
mental events. Perhaps w e hâve been oblivious to the possi-
bility that on this level the future m ay contribute equally
with the past, or m ay even act alone, to cause the présent.
O n the physical level w e hâve become accustomed always to
look for causes of events in the past, and this m ay hâve
misled us. But of course on such a view w e leave unsolved
the status of the future event E. Presumably it must exist if
it is to be a cause of something else.
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O G O G N I T I O N 55
O f the problem of free-will w e hâve so far said nothing.
It is difficult to say anything w orth w hile until w e are clear
about the background against w hich w e view it, viz. that of
the “Eternal N ow ” — that of a plastic future or that of a
blank future. If the first o f these is our assumption in the
w ay in w hich Dunne interprets it, there seems no room for
free-will. T h e second view attem pts to provide a “provi-
sional” future, w hich while allowing us to account for pre-
cognition leaves room for m odification of the foreseen
“future” by acts of human volition. Saltmarsh has pointed
out, quite logically, that because certain events hâve been
precognised— w e should not necessarily assume that ail
future events can be precognised. W e hâve already discussed
the difficulties of this theory. W e shall leave the subject in
this unsatisfactory State; but w e foreshadowed this would be
the case.
R e tr o co g n itio n
This is the com plem entary phenomenon which, if we
accept precognition as factual, would be expected also to
exist. It is the non-inferential cognition of events in the past
w hich are outside the range of a person’s m emory. It has not
received the attention accorded to precognition, and this is
probably due to the fact that its existence would not appear
to create the same philosophical problems as the latter. But
another reason probably is that the vérification o f retro­
cognition implies either that the data are in a living m ind or
exist somewhere in docum entary form, and are therefore
theoretically accessible to clairvoyance.
O ne of the most famous and frequently quoted causes of
retrocognition is that of Miss G. A . E. M oberly and Miss
E. F. Jourdain, w ho were respectively Principal and V ice-
Principal of St. H ugh’s College, Oxford. T h e full story is
told in the book An Adventure, first published in 19 11— a
^6 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
book which has passed through several éditions. It is an
account of a visit they made to the Petit T n an on in V er­
sailles m 1901, during which they ostensibly saw the gardens
as they were m the mid-eighteenth century in the tim e of
M arie Antoinette. T hey met eight persons there whose
behaviour, dress, and manner seemed to them at the time
rather peculiar, and they saw m any features of the grounds
and palace which did not correspond w ith w hat they after-
wards found to be the reahty. T h ey undertook considérable
research in French national archives to check up on the
strange appearances of their first visit, and the whole case
that is presented 1s remarkable and impressive. It has very
properly been subject to close critical scrutm y b y several
authorities (e.g Journ. S.P.R., p. 178, 1950; p. 117, 1953,
etc.); but it still stands as the most detailed account o f a
retrocognitive expérience described by two trustworthy per­
sons.
A number of further expériences w ill be found in M yers :
Human Personality, V ol. I, pp. 591-4 (1903). I shall briefly
describe only one other, given by Miss Edith O livier in Ghap-
ter X V I of her book Without Knowing Mr. Walkley (Faber
& Faber, 1939). Some years elapsed before sherealised th atit
had para-normal features. She was driving a small car from
Devizes to Swmdon between 5 and 6 p.m. on a w et O ctober
evening in 19x6. She left the m ain road and found herself
passing along a strange avenue “ through a succession of
huge grey megaliths which stood on either hand, loom ing
like vast immovable shadows withm a curtain o f softly falling
rain” . She assumed shemust be approaching Avebury, w hich
she had not visited before but of which she knew as having
been once the site of a circular m egalithic temple. A t the end
of the avenue she climbed on to an earthwork w hich sur-
rounded the temple and saw the great stones, some standing
and others fallen, w ith cottages interspersed am ong them.
P R E C O G N I T I O N A N D R E T R O G O G N I T I O N 57
O n this night she apparently “saw” a village fair in pro­
gressa w ith flares and torches from the booths and the usual
accompaniments o f the fair. N ine years later, w hen visiting
A vebury w ith a friend, M iss O livier discovered from a
guide-book that a fair had been held annually in Avebury,
but that it was abolished in 1850. W hen she visited A vebury
the next year in order to study the m onum ent as a member
of a learned society, she discovered that the avenue of
m egaliths up w hich she believed she had driven on her first
visit had disappeared before 1800. Ostensibly she must hâve
had a retrocognitive expérience, view m g the scene as it m ay
hâve been in the eighteenth century.
T h e retrocognitive vision, in contrast w ith the precognitive
type, seems to be generally associated with a particular place
or locality. W hether this is an essential feature of it, w e do
not know enough to say. In so far as it is so, w e m ay perhaps
regard it as a spécial type o f object-reading to w hich brief
reference w ill be m ade in the next chapter.

H E R E are some sensitives who, if handed an object, are
able to proflFer information about the person or persons
who hâve touched the object. Such inform ation m ay be very
detailed— of their physical appearance, idiosyncrasies,
character, and interests, of their environment, of past events
in their lives, and occasionally even of events w hich are still
in the future. In the light of w hat w e hâve already discussed
of psychic faculty, the simplest interprétation o f the facts
would seem to be that the object acts as a lmk, enabling the
sensitive to achieve télépathie rapport w ith some level o f the
person to whom the object belongs. O nce the rapport is
established, the object plays no essential part. O n e m ight
almost describe it as a locus o f psychic finger-prints, enabling
the author of them to be identified ! W e shall follow our
usual course of looking fîrst at représentative data w hich
establish the probability of the phenomenon itself. W e can
then consider how it is related to»other aspects of ^-faculty.
Dr. H ettinger is an electrical engineer and, following some
years of research, he wrote in 1940 and 1941 tw o books
which embodied his data and conclusions. This work has
been vigorously criticised by Scott {Proc, S.P.R., V ol. X L I X ,
p. 16, 1949), and although H ettinger’s conclusions m ay not
be fully justified, his work is valuable as a pioneer effort to
establish the phenomenon by statistical methods on a reliable

Hettinger took with him to each sitting, which was of about
an hour’s duration, some half-dozen different articles in
sealed envelopes. These were of great variety— pens, pencils,
wallets, watches, rings, letters, hair, etc.— and were obtamed
from different persons. Each envelope was handed in turn
to the sensitive, who might touch it (or perhaps merely
“concentrate5
5 on it), and would proceed to make on an
average a dozen statements about the person to whom the
object belonged. D r. Hettinger did not know, when handing
over the envelope, whose object it contained, otherwise the
statements might be of knowledge drawn by the medium
telepathically from his mind. In checking up the correctness
of the medium’s statements, it would be of no scientific value
to présent a list of these to the person about whom they were
made and ask for a judgment of their correctness. Glearly
one or two strikingly unusual statements which were
admitted as correct would carry much weight, but the in­
correct majonty always leave the question open as to how
far “chance5
5or “coincidence5
5 can be stretched. Hettinger
therefore devised a number of control methods, of which the
following may be regarded as typical. The original state­
ments made by the medium were mixed with an equal num­
ber of spurious statements drawn at random from a large
number of those made previously by the sensitive about other
persons. The subject was then asked to indicate which were
regarded as applicable and which were not applicable. In
this way Hettinger was able to détermine the number of
items regarded as correct from among the sensitive5
soriginal
statements and the number correct from the equal number
of spurious or control statements. If the first of these sub-
stantially exceeded the second, we should hâve evidence of
para-normal faculty on the part of the sensitive.
A variety of control methods was used, and we shall not
6o P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
consider them here. As typical of the results obtained, we
may quote a sériés of experiments in which 76 different
objects yielded 948 statements. O f these 328, or 34*5 per
cent., were claimed as correct, while from 948 control state­
ments only 222 or 23*5 per cent, were claimed correct. This
latter percentage would be regarded as a measure of the like-
lihood that an applicable statement would be made by
chance. The total time involved with the two sensitives was
623 hours and 6,631 statements were made. O f these 38*75
per cent, were regarded as applicable, while from an equal
number of control statements only 28*85 per cent, were
accepted. The sensitive scored 34 per cent, better than the
control.
Among the general observations made by Hettinger are
some which, if true, are of importance in formulating any
theory of the faculty.
(a) The nature of the objects is not significant, nor are the
emotional or sentimental associations of the object for the
owner of significance.
(i>) Handling of the objects by the sensitive is not essential
to the exercise of the faculty.
(c) The degree of the sensitive’s response differs from sub-
ject to subject. In a long sériés of experiments some subjects
had on different occasions presented a number of articles,
and it was found that the sensitive was reasonably consistent
in the degree of success (or otherwise) attained.
(d) O f the correct statements, an attempt to find their
relevance to the past, présent, and future of the subject re-
sulted as follows : 33 per cent, were true from 14 to 5 days
prior to the experiment, 25 per cent, true from 5 days to
1 day prior to^the experiment, 32 per cent, true on the day of
the experiment^ a^d 10 per cent, applicable at the time of
the experiment. î&eference to the future was rare.
(e) M any correct^statements concerned expenences of the
O B J E C T - R E A D I N G O R P S Y G H O M E T R Y 6l
subject between the time he had parted with the article and
the time of the experiment.
(/) The sensitive cannot always distinguish between the
owner of an article and someone associated with the owner.
A il these observations are consistent with the view that the
exercise of the faculty is essentially one of télépathie rapport
between the minds of the sensitive and the owner of the
article. The question may be raised as to the origin of the 60
per cent, incorrect statements made by these sensitives. Some
may be guesses; others may be items stimulated by the associ­
ation of ideas in the sensitive’s mind; other items may arise
through temporary rapport with the mind of the expéri­
menter or with minds closely linked to the subject’s mind.
Finally, it is always possible that the subject who checks the
list may overlook significant points.
In his second book the tests were of arather different kind.
The subject, whose article was presented to the sensitive, was
asked to co-operate by reading or looking at pictures in an
illustrated magazine or prepared album. He marked on each
page the time at which it was viewed. The sensitive’s state­
ments were timed to coïncide with this activity of the subject.
M any striking resemblances werefound. Although Hettinger
did not do so in this work it would doubtless hâve been pos­
sible to adopt a control System making statistical évaluation
possible.
This valuable pièce of pioneering work should be repeated
and extended by others. In spite of severe criticism of H et-
tinger’s work, it lends, in iny opinion, considérable support
to the view that this is a genuine faculty.
W ork of D r . E ugène O s t y
D r. Osty, a French investigator, has provided many
notable examples of object-reading in his book Supernorm al
F aculties in M a n (Methuen & Go, 1923).

Case of G. M.
“On March i3th, 1915, M . Emile Boirac, Rectorof the
Academy of Dijon, asked me in course of conversation to
give him an instance of Mme MorePs metagnomic output.
“I said, c
The best example would be an impromptu ex-
periment. Hâve you anything belonging to a person
known to you well enough to enable you to judge of what
she may say?’
“Boirac took some papers from his pocket, hesitated in
his choice, and finally handed to me a little manual of
Espéranto.
“In absolute ignorance of the person whose book this
might be, I put it into the hands of Mme Morel, hypno-
tised, asking her to speak of the life of the person to whom
it belonged.
“She said, ‘A young man appears to me, tall and rather
slight. There is nothing very characteristic in his appear-
ance but his eyes, which are not like those of other people.
There is nothing wrong with them, but their form is
peculiar... .
“ T see this young man for a long while in a place
where there is no danger . . . he was there with many
other men. . . , Then one day, one moming, he départs
with others . . . a long march . . . he then goes in a train.
I see him a little later with others in a kind of hole . . .
he is standing up with shining eyes. . . . I hear much noise.
. . . I see fury in his brain; he goes up. . . . What a noise
I hear I He feels a blow and falls . . . gets up . . . receives
another blow, and falls afresh with others on a road . . .
on one side I see grass and cultivated land, on the other
side grey mud. He is wounded in the throat and head by
a piece of iron. . . . I see a hole on one side . . . he is in
OB J E G T - R E A D I N G O R P S Y G H O M E T R Y 63
pain . . . he remains long on the ground. . . . I see him
white and pale . . . then there is quiet.. . there are men
there who take him up gently .. . he is tall and heavy . . .
then they wrap him up . . . he moves a little . . . they take
him away in a kind of carnage with other wounded men
. . . there is confusion . . . a man bends over him and takes
some papers and something round and hard .. . they are
keeping this wounded man as a prisoner . . . he still lives
. . . then everything is blurred, . . . I no longer hear his
breath. . . . I see no more. He is not far from the place
where he fe ll.. . . His body w ill be found . .. it is near a
church... . I see vaults near him . . . like a quarry. . . . To
right and left there are woods. One can walk under these
stones, they are as it were vaults. . . . To find him one
must go towards the frontage of the church, going up the
road nearly facing the church, and looking in the wood.
. .. There are many there .. . heis there.. .. There is no
stream there; the earth is dry.’
“On March ijth I sent M . Boirac the account above.
On the 24th he wrote to me :
“ Th e little manual of Espéranto that I gave you was
taken from the civilian clothing left at my house by the
son of one of my friends. The young man was afterwards
a second-lieutenant in the 27th Régiment, killed or miss-
ing on December i2th in a trench attack at the Bois-Brule.
“ £
G. M . was aged twenty-five or twenty-six, tall, slight,
face rather long, and his eyelids had a slight fold, like the
Chinese, serious and quiet expression. . . . As far as is
known, he was wounded leading the attack, but continued
at the head of his men, then fell at the edge of the Ger-
man trench which is still in the hands of the enemy.
<
cTh e first wound seems to hâve been in the shoulder,
the second in the head. The body is supposed to hâve been
P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
64
taken up by the Germans and buried by them, but there
is no certainty. He was returned as “missing” . The vision
is therefore correct, with some particulars that cannot be
ascertained. I can State that the little book was touched
by G. M . some months before the scene to which it gave
rise. It had remained with M . Boirac while this young
man passed through the last stages of his life.’ ”
I quote one more case of D r. Osty. He was approached by
M . M iraultj manager of the estâtes of Baron Joubert, to ask
if he would help in tracing an old man of eighty-two who
had been missing for sixteen days, and of whom no trace
could be found. The estâtes covered about 2,750 acres of
woodland. D r. Osty asked only for a description of the old
man, and was given a neck-wrapper belonging to him and
taken from his wardrobe. The detail of this case is very im-
pressive (see pp. 104-8 Supernorm al F a cu lties in M ari), and
it is necessary to give an abbreviated summary here. Three
sittings were held with Mme Morel as the sensitive. When in
deep hypnosis the neck-wrapper was placed in her hands
with the instruction to look for the person who had owned
it. In the first sitting, Mme Morel said :
“I see a man lying at full length, his eyes are closed, as
if sleeping, but he does not breathe . . . he is dead. .. . He
is not in bed, but on the ground .. . the ground is damp,
very damp . .. fiat ground . .. uncultivated. . . . There is
water not far ofï .. . a large tree . . . some very big thing
quite near . . . something very bushy— a wood.”
“Foliow that man on the day he went there. Look for
the way he went.”
“I see a country house. , .. He leaves th a t. .. he walks.
.. . He is ill, his breathing is difficult. . . and his brain is
confused. .. . He leaves the path .. . goes into a thicket,
a wood. . . he sees much water near b y .. . . He falls on the
O B JE G T - RE AD I N G O R P S Y G H O M E T R Y 65
damp ground . . . then after a little time he breathes no
more. It is not far from the house ta the place where he is
lying. . . . Follow the path from the house towards the
water. There are two paths from the house, one goes up
and the other down towards the water. The latter is the
one to take : he went that way.”
“Describe the place where he is lying and give a de­
scription so as to find the place.”
“I see blocks of stone . . . very large trees . . . and
w ater.. . . I see the body . . . it is lying on the wet ground,
. . . He is bald, has a long nose . . . a little white hair
above his ears and at the back of his head . . . wearing a
long coat . . . soft shirt . . . hands closed. . . . I see one
finger which has been hurt . . . very old and wrinkled
. .. pendent lips. . . . Forehead much furrowed, very high
and open. . . . He is lying on his right side, one leg bent
under him.”
In spite of further prolonged searching and more detail
in a second sitting, he could not be traced. In a third sitting
Mme Morel said in answer to the instruction to look for the
exact way he took when he left the house :
“He leaves the houses . . . passesby the side of them . . .
goes towards the other houses . . . reaches the cross-ways
where three roads meet, in front of which there is a house.
. . . He passes a barrier . . . hésitâtes . . . he has an old
stick in his hand . . . he taps the ground with it . . . his
mind is confused. . . he goes to the right on a descending
road . .. hésitâtes. . . returns to the cross-ways leaning on
his stick . . . takes the left-hand road . . . walks on its
right side, holding his stick and a check handkerchief . . .
passes near a fence and goes into the wood by a path
which is barely visible on a level with the road . . . goes
there with the intention of hiding. . . .
p.r.— 3*
66 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
“From where the body is, the house and the hut are not
visible ; one must go back to the road to see them. . . .
He did not go far into the wood . . . near the place where
the ground slopes down somewhat. . .
This time a search in the more restricted area was naade
with complété success, and the surroundings were exactly as
described by Mme Morel, as was aîso- the position of the
body. In this case the mental contact was ostensibly not with
the mind of any living person— but with the discarnate mind
of the old man. It is further noteworthy that the neck-
wrapper placed in contact with the sensitive had not partici-
pated in the events described. Some sensitives, such as Mme
Morel, exercise their faculty best under hypnosis ; others—
the majority— in a more normal conscious State.
Some of the general conclusions of D r. Osty about the
faculty are these :
(a) Each individual who has touched the article may be
cognised without any confusion of persons and attributes.
(b) Once the rapport has been established the object has
no further part to play and could be destroyed.
(c) The life of the subject can be cognised as it is in the
présent, irrespective of the time interval since the object
was touched by that person.
(d) Objects placed in contact do not apparently com-
municate their peculiar psychic qualities to each other. [This
conclusion is not apparently shared by Miss G. Cummins,
who in her book U nseen A dventures, p. 57 (Rider & Co.,
1951), gives an instance where a letter of hers written under
conditions of great emotional stress, and placed with five
other letters, gave to an object-reader a feeling “sa intense
that it seemed to permeate the entire sériés of objects” .]

W o rk o f D r . Pa g e n ste g h e r
D r. Pagenstecher was a German physician practising in
the city of Mexico. One of his patients, Senora Marie Reyes
de Z, when in an hypnotic trance, exhibited the faculty to a
marked degree. Her faculty was further investigated in 1921
by D r. W. F. Prince, one of the naost experienced American
workers in the field of psychical research. An account of
this is found in P ro c. A m erican S.P.itï., Vols. X V and X V I.
One of the most impressive examples of Senora Z5
s faculty
is described below. A friend of Pagenstecher, at that time in
Japan, sent him a letter, and also two sealed envelopes.
When one of these sealed envelopes was placed in Senora Z ’s
hand she gave a description of the sinking of a large liner,
that people were frightened and were putting on life-belts.
The language spoken was English. A man wasi described in
some detail, distinguished by a scar over the left eyebrow,
who was writing a message. This he tore out of the book,
sealed it in a bottle, and threw it into the sea. When the seals
of the envelope were broken in the presence of D r. Pagen­
stecher and D r. Prince, a slip of paper apparently tom from
a pocket book was disclosed, with the following message (in
Spanish) written upon it. “The ship is sinking. Farewell my
Louisa; seethat my children do not forget me. Your Ramon.
Havana. M ay God care for you and me also. Farewell.”
The other sealed envelope contained the facts which were
known about it, and a description of the supposed writer. It
seemed that the bottle had been picked up on the coast of
the Azores and that in Havana lived a lady who identified
the writing as her husband’s. Her husband had used the
assumed name of Ramon B, and had for political reasons
left in 1916 without disclosing where he was going, He had
been in New York about the time of sailing of the Lusitania
68 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
on her ill-fated voyage and was presumed lost with the ship.
The detailed description, including the scar, corresponded
closely with the sensitive’s description.
1
1 is of course possible to claim that in this case the con­
tents of the two sealed envelopes were read clairvoyantly.
In other cases no such explanation w ill hold, as where a frag­
ment from a temple in the Roman forum was placed in her
hands and the characteristic psychometric ability resulted
in a description of the Roman forum.
T h e o r y and Sp é c u l a t io n
When we ask ourselves precisely how an object can be
modified by being touched, so as to permit a sensitive to
achieve rapport with the mind of that person, clearly
nothing which we know of the ordinary properties of matter
can provide us with a due. The hypothesis of a psychic
æther already introduced (see p. 28) here finds one of its
most useful applications. The psychic æther modified in the
object— which we w ill for brevity call the ætheric duplicate
— can sustain also émotions and thought-images. We may
suppose that by touch the characteristics of the ætheric body
of the subject are communicated to the ætheric duplicate of
the object. O f the nature of this modification, which is
characteristic of the mento-emotional nature of a person, it
is idle to speculate. Sensitives, however, refer to it as quite
distinctive, and making unique identification possible. It is
noteworthy that ail investigators remark that there is no
intermingling of such characteristics in an object; they re-
main separate, just as many persons might overlay their
handwriting on the same piece of paper. One of D r. Osty’s
sensitives, M . de Fleuriere, described some of his sensations
asfollows {loc. cit.j p. 170) :
“When I am in proximity to an unknown person, and
especially when a Üght touch places us in contact, I feel
O B J E C T - R E A D I N G O R P S Y G H O M E T R Y 69
as though I were permeated by an indefinable fiuid that
radiâtes from his whole person. . . . Just as one cannot
find two faces absolutely alike, I think that I hâve never
found two fluids that hâve given me exactly the same im­
pression ; there are those that seem to me gentle, agreeable,
sympathetic, and even pleasant like spring breezes, light
and transparent like the blue of the sky; they seem en-
dowed with calming and beneficent power. On the other
hand, there are some that are keen, sharp, violent, and
repellent, pricking like needle-points, hard and piercing
like winter winds; these carry what feels like an anti-
pathetic and discomforting principle. When I desire to
fathom the intimate personality of one who projects a
fluid into me, there are cases in which the psychic interior
of that person appears to me illumined like a large room
flooded with light, in which ail the contents are to be dis-
cerned in order and in strong relief. On the other hand,
there are cases in which the fluid is quite different in
essence, and when I seek to penetrate interiorly the per­
son to whom it pertains, I hâve the impression of looking
into darkness . . . and things appear but slowly as the
eye becomes used to the dimness.”
The simplest view of object-reading is that the sensitive
discovers the mind of the person who communicated this
distinctive quality to the ætheric duplicate of the object, and
thereafter dérivés information from some level of that per-
son’s mind or deeper self. It is futile to speculate how such
“discovery” is made; we know virtually nothing about the
linkage between minds apart from the basic fact that it
exists and varies in its degree as between different minds.
One of the interesting observations of Hettinger was that
it did not appear essential to the exercise of the faculty by
some sensitives that they should themselves touch the object.
P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
70
A certain form of “concentration” or adjustment of their
mind towards the object was sufficient. When we reflect that
the mind, w'hile concentrating its activity at a certain; point
of space and time (described as a physical brain), is not
limited in its exercise of ^-faculty to this point, Hettinger’s
observation is not surprising. Moreover, one would venture
to predict that the “charging” of the ætheric duplicate of
the object with the distinctive personal quality should not
dépend on physical touch, but could be donc by a suitable
mental “concentration” on the object. Research to verify
these features should be undertaken.
It seems not unreasonable to speculate at this point. It
may well be that sacred relies, images, and places of worship
and pilgrimage hâve, on the ætheric level, been saturated
by the émotion and vénération of générations of people, and
thus become the foci of psychic energies. To these, other
persons who are in any degree sensitive may achieve a
measure of rapport and make a response. Likewise it may
equally be true that certain jewels and relies from Egyptian
tombs, sometimes described as ill-omened to their possessors,
may hâve had communicated to them, on the ætheric level,
psychic fields of a particularly undesirable kind. We are here
approaching a field of “magic” which orthodox science is
disposed to dismiss summarily as superstition. We must cer-
tainly move with critical caution; our basic need is, however,
for careful research, not for either préjudice or dogma. I
may perhaps be permitted to draw the reader’s attention to
a notable example, where merely the touch of a garaient
placed a patient in momentary rapport with the mind of its
possessor and effected an instantaneous healing (Mark v.
25“ 34)-
The subject of psychometry or object-reading is one which
w ill certainly repay ail the research and careful examina­
tion which can be given to it. Here we are exploring in that
O B J E G T - R E A D I N G O R P S Y C H O M E T R Y Jl
interesting région which holds the dues to an understanding
of what we call mind and what we call matter, and of what
is the relation between them. On the hypothesis of the exist­
ence of a psychic æther which is functionally a bridge be­
tween the two levels, clairvoyance might be regarded as
operating near the material end of the bridge and object-
reading as operating near the mental end of the bridge. The
first is concerned principally with form and the second with
feeling.
There may be a very close connection between retrocog-
nition (see p. 55) and object-reading, where the object may
be in fact a locality. I think we must bear in mind the possi-
bility that there may be a type of object-reading different
from that which we hâve discussed in this chapter. In this
type the sensitive’s mind is not put en rapport with another
mind or minds which hâve been related to that object or
locality, but rather with a time sériés of events which hâve
in some way left their impress on the psychic æther of that
locality. Such a suggestion points to an extended view of
memory. It may be that a memory-record is not exclusively
associated with what we call mind, but is equally associated
with what we call matter (through its psychic æther). M ind
may be the sole instrument of apprehending memory, but
not the solerepository of it.
Sooner or later we shall of course hâve to abandon this
nomenclature of matter, psychic æther, and mind, andrecog-
nise that M ind is fondamental, while the other levels are
modes or aspects of M ind’s functioning.

E now turrx to another aspect of the mind’s activities.
So far we hâve considered the sensory side of the
mind’s function : its ability to interpret the impressions re-
ceived through the spécial senses. We hâve seen that the
mind has apparently a faculty of gathering knowledge of
events and ideas apart from the use of these spécial meehan-
isms of the body. The other side of the mind’s activity in
relation to the material world is m otor— Le. a power of
action in the world. The assumption has hitherto been made
that such activity is necessarily through an associated body,
i.e. through the activity of nerves and muscles. But is this the
only possibility? The mind has been shown to hâve extra-
sensory ways of gathering knowledge; may it not also hâve
extra-muscular means of performing actions? It is a ques­
tion which experiment must answer for us. We may
anticipate the results of this chapter to say that the answer
is “yes” . If we refer to ^-faculty, we may then need to dis-
tinguish between \py
> the sensory variety, and \j/K} the motor
variety.1
In March 1943 D r. Rhine and his co-workers at Duke
University published in the Journal o f Parapsychology the
firstfruits of ten years’ research in the field of telekinesis, or
psycho-kinesis (P.K.) as it is now called. The procedure con-

sisted of attempting to influence the fall of a die by the
mental attitude adopted. Granted that a true unbiased die
is used, the chance of any chosen face coming uppermost in
a random throw is i in 6. If two dice are thrown simultane-
ously, the sum of the faces may range from 2 to 12. It is
easy for the reader to see that there are 36 combinations of
the two dice, and of these 15 add up to values of 8 or more,
15 to values of 6 or less, while six combinations are of value
7. Hence by throwing two dice simultaneously we hâve a
chance probability of 5 in 12 that the score w ill be high (8
or more), and also of 5 in 12 that the score w ill be low (6 or
less). We could try by our attitude of mind to favour a high
or, alternatively, a low score. This kind of experiment, like
those with cards, can be treated statistically, allowing a state-
ment to bemade asto the chance likelihood of any déviation
taking place from the expected number of throws.
One of the most obvious criticisms which may be made
of these experiments is that an absolutely true die probably
does not exist, and that a small bias might easily be revealed
in a large number of throws. This objection was met by
always making two sériés of throws of approximately equal
numbers- in one sériés a high score would be the aim, in the
other a low score would be the aim. Obviously, a supposed
bias could not benefit both these sériés, except in the event
of a peculiarity which would create a deficiency of sevens.
In the course of experimental work many variations were
tried. Dice were placed on a corrugated inclined surface and
allowed to roll down under gravity. They were also placed
in an electrically rotated cage with flat ends. The manner of
throwing did not, however, appear significant. Variations
such as the number of dice thrown at one time, the size,
shape, and material of the dice were also made. A throw of
twenty-four dice was standardised as a “run”, whether this
was twenty-four separate dice, twelve twos, eight threes, etc.
P S Y C H O - K I N E S I S A N D P O L T E R G E I S T S 75
One of the most characteristic and significant effects
noticed was that a first run usually gave a marked score
above chance, a second run would give a smaller P.K. effect,
a third run one smaller still, and so on. This “décliné5
5effect
was characteristic of E.S.P. also (see p. 21) Interest and
novelty appear to be important stimuli, and to maintain a
P.K. effect after two or three runs some change or variation
of conditions is désirable. The existence of this décliné effect
which results in scoring practically at the chance level after
a few runs is the strongest evidence against bias m the dice
as an explanation of the effects.
Experiments were made throwing different numbers of
dice at one time, ranging through 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 to 96.
If the force which operated to secure above-chance scoring
was physical in its nature, one would expect that the larger
the mass to be moved the less marked would be the effect.
There is no indication of any such relationship. On the con-
trary, Rhine and his co-workers found that in experimenting
with the throwing of larger and larger numbers of dice, the
results improved each time. A il that can probably be in-
ferred from this is that novelty and interest are important
déterminants. Tests with dice of different volume, and of
the same volume but of different material, showed no corré­
lation of P.K. with these factors. Where, however, an ex­
périmenter appeared to hâve a mental attitude of preference
for one kind of dice, this favoured the effect.
In experiments designed to discover any corrélation be-
tween P.K. and the distance between the dice and the ex­
périmenter, no significant change was observed up to 25 feet.
It was noticed, however, that where the mental attitude
favoured either proxim ity or distance, the P.K. effect fol-
lowed the direction of preference.
D . J. West, in a critical survey of the American P.K. re-
search (Proc. S .P .R ., Vol. X L V II, p. 281), has stated that
P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
76
in his opinion “the case for R K . does not seem to be chai-
lengeable; it is probably even more clear-cut and conclusive
than the case for E.S.JP. itself5
\ We hâve not so far offered
the reader any experimental data on which to form a judg-
ment himself; chiefly because it is in the whole mass of ac-
cumulated facts that the strength of the case lies.
Without entering into mathematical considérations very
far, we may take as an imaginary expenment 1,200 throws
of a die for which the probability of any chosen face turning
up is 1 in 6 or 200 times. We hâve set out in the table how

+ 20 iin 15-3
+ 3 ° 1in 89-3

likely it is that an upward déviation from this number would
occur on a chance basis. Thus the chance that in 1,200
throws 230 or more appearances of a particular face w ill
occur is 1is 89. Below are two actual experiments where a

J. B. Rhine has drawn attention to the very marked
parallels which exist between E.S.P. and P.K. They are in-
fluenced by the same factors. Whether we are considering
the factor of distance, the actions of drugs on the experi-
P S Y C H O - K I N E S I S A N D P O L T E R G E I S T S JJ
menter, the décliné effects, the importance of interest and
novelty, the inhibitory effect of distractions and soon— we
find a notable similarity. It looks as though these two aspects
of the mind’s faculty are inter-linked as the notation
(E.S.P.) and x
j/
K (P.K.) remind us. Indeed, it would seem
reasonable to suppose that far from being para-normal,
^-faculty may be of the essential nature of the mind’s func-
tioning. We choose to call the familiar the “normal”, and
this may be where ^-faculty is wholly operative through the
ÏNDIVIDUAL
senses or through the muscles. We choose to call the less
familiar activity of ^-faculty— where it is not mediated
through the brain of the observer— “para-normal” . There
may be in essence only one faculty with two complementary
aspects, sensory and motor. Provided the mind can be dis-
engaged from its close focusing on the material world,
through the brain, we can then become aware of the mind’s
more extended powers.
If we want to find a place in the attached diagram for our
psychic æther, it may be regarded as the medium or vehicle
of activity of the \
f/
y and ÿ*, just as the now-discarded æther
78 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
of the physicists was once pictured as a vehicle for electro-
magnetic waves. Rhine has suggested that R K . really implies
E.S.P. as a necessity, using the argument that para-normal
knowledge of the orientation of the die is essential to the
effective application of P.K., in order to score above chance
on a particular face. One might almost visualise the ætheric
duplicates of a group of dice being orientated by P.K., much
as a transient magnetic field would orientate a group of
magnets. In any deeper understanding of these things I am
confident, however, that we shall hâve to abandon models
and mechanism, just as physicists hâve found it necessary to
do this in their more profound studies of the atom. Per-
haps represents a fundamental relationship of mental
rapport between a so-called individual mind and the sus-
tained thoughts of a Divine or cosmic mind. Perhaps jf/K
represents our own puny power of modifying and affecting
locally the cosmic mental field. A il sense-data are created and
sustamed by Divine Imagining. A il natural laws are ideas
created and sustained in this cosmic mental field. The laws
of chance are an example. When we introduce our own
imagining we can temporarily and locally modify the mental
field. Another and different form of doing this w ill be con-
sidered in the next chapter dealing with apparitions.
When we were considering E.S.P. we remarked that the
card experiments revealed only the faculty on the fringe of
its development, not in its fuller manifestation as some of the
spontaneous cases revealed it. The same remarks apply to
P.K. in the dice experiments. The more strîking forms of it
are found among the phenomena of physical mediumship,
where curtains are blown about, objects levitated, and
various manifestations of powerful physical forces hâve been
exhibited.

Pronounged F orm s o f P sy c h o -kin esis
When in 1870 Sir William Crookes, O .M ., F.R.S., pub-
lished his researches in this field with the aid of the medium
D. D. Home, he met with the incredulity and ridicule of the
scientific world. Crookes was a man of unquestionable
integrity and outstanding distinction, being elected President
of the Royal Society in 1913. The record of his experiments1
is worthy of study, not only for the sake of the evidence
provided, but as an account of the bitter opposition which
he had to meet in presenting experimental data which would
not fit into the orthodox scientific thought-pattern of the
time. Crookes said in his defence : “Not until I had w it-
nessed these facts some half-dozen times, and scrutinised
them with ail the critical acumen I possess, did I become
convinced of their objective reality.” He continued :
“Remember, I hazard no hypothesis or theory whatever; I
merely vouch for certain facts, my only object being— the
truth. Doubt, but do not deny; point out, by the severest
criticism what are considered fallacies in my experimental
tests, and suggest more conclusive trials; but do not let us
hastily call our senses lying witnesses merely because they
testify against preconceptions ”
In the presence of D. D . Home, Crookes witnessed an
8-lb. weight on a weighing machine in three successive trials
increase its reading ta 36 lb., 48 lb., and 46 lb. respectively
“under strict scrutiny” .On a second occasion, in the presence
of other observers, three trials showed the 8-lb. weight read­
ing 23 lb., 43 lb., and 27 lb,, where Crookes had complété
control of the experiment and took every précaution to ex-
clude trickery.
He built an apparatus consisting of a simple lever, a
1 Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism: W. CROpKES
(1953; Psychic Book Club,48 Old Bailey, E.C.4).
8 0 P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
spring-balance, and an automatic recorder of the balance
readings, and was able to record and measure the force
which Home could exert when his hands were not in contact
with the apparatus or when they dipped into a basin of
water placed on the lever under conditions where
mechanical force was precluded. Crookes said that the force
which Home could exert varied enormously from hour to
hour; it might be inappréciable for an hour or more, and
then suddenly become very strong. Crookes also remarked
that while the force was capable of acting at a distance of
2 or 3 feet away from Home, it was always strongest close to
him. This characteristic variation with distance and the fact
that the force appeared to emanate from the hands suggests
at least the possibility that this kind of force may not be the
same as that involved in Rhine’s R K . experiments.
Crookes records numerous examples of heavy objects
being moved at some distance from the medium. He refers
to five occasions on which he had seen a heavy dining-room
table rise between a few inches and feet from the floor
under spécial circumstances which rendered trickery impos­
sible.
Crookes mentions that there were at least a hundred
recorded instances of the lévitation of D. D . Home, and that
he witnessed three of them. “On three separate occasions I
hâve seen him raised completely from the floor of the room.
Once sitting in an easy chair, once kneeling on his chair, and
once standing up. On each occasion I had full opportunity
of watching the occurrence asit was taking place.” He refers
to detailed accounts which he had heard from the Earl of
Dunraven, Lord Lindsay, and Captain C. Wynne of their
own observation of lévitation phenomena with Home.
Crookes also States that in his own house, where trickery or
any sort of fraudulent préparation were quite out of the
question, he had witnessed an accordion play in his own
P S Y G H O - K I N E S I S A N D P O L T E R G E I S T S 8l
hand while he held it with the keys downwards, and he had
seen and heard the same accordion float about the room
playing ail the time. He daims to hâve seen a water-bottle
and tumbler rise from the table, a coral necklace rise on end,
and a fan move about and fan the company.
The same kind of things hâve been recorded by trust-
worthy observers in the presence of many famous médiums.1
I shall therefore refer here only to one other outstanding
example— that of Anna Rasmussen. Professor Winther of
Copenhagen studied this medium for fifteen years, and pub-
lished the details of his studies (Journ. Am erican S .P .R .,
January-M ay 1928). In Winther’s laboratory, on a stable
base, there was supported a glass chamber within which
were suspended a number of pendula of different lengths
and with different bobs. In the presence of this medium the
pendula, or any selected, could be made to swing or stop or
change their direction as requested, with no possibility of
mechanical interférence. These phenomena were observed
in broad daylight on many occasions.
These are strange things, and many readers w ill feel
bewildered. They are not everyday occurrences, and few of
us w ill ever hâve the opportunity of investigating them at
first hand. They are, of course, no stranger than many of
the extra-sensory phenomena; but we tend to think we
know what ought to happen in the physical world. We hâve
built up for ourselves preconceptions, and it is the weight of
these against which psychical research has to contend. When
a sufEcient number of observations hâve been made by
responsible persons under conditions where fraud can be
ruled out, I think we must be prepared to jettison our pre­
conceptions and seek for a wider world-view within which

these things can find an intelligible place. Innumerable
questions arise conceming phenomena such as we hâve
described. What is the source of the energy which produces
these effects? Does the physical law of the Conservation of
Energy and Matter hold? Are we to conceive of the
medium’s subconscious mind as the directive agency? It is
easier to ask these questions than to find even tentative
answers. We shall leave them for the présent and look at
another group of similar phenomena.
POLTERGEIST EFFECTS
The German word poltergeist has passed into English
usage, and has the meaning of “a boisterous noisy spirit5
5
.
We shall use the term without necessarily accepting thisi im -
plied theory of the phenomena. Accounts of happenings
described as “poltergeist5
5 hâve been current through the
centuries, and the reader who desires to form an impression
of the accumulated records should read some book devoted
exclusively to the subject. They ail run remarkably true to a
general type : unexplained noises in empty rooms and cor­
ridors, sounds such as of fumiture being dragged about,
sounds of blows or raps upon bedposts, or even from the
interior of tree trunks, sounds as of breaking china or glass—
where there is no apparent physical cause. In addition to
acoustical effects there are sensational kinetic effects, in
which objects of ail kinds may fly about. Books fly off
shelves, household utensils are projected through space or
dance about on the floor and are sometimes broken, beds
are overturned, etc. Occasionally, unusual thermal effects
hâve been recorded : foci of a sustained fall of température
or of a sustained rise of température. From the standpoint
of energy production, acoustical effects, while impressive to
the auditory sense, involve comparatively little energy. On
P S Y C H O - K I N E S I S A N D P O L T E R G E I S T S 83
the other hand, thermal effects are impressive in relation to
the magnitude of the energy involved.
I shall give an abbreviated account of one case only,
selected because it was witnessed personally by Sir William
Barrett, Professor of Physics in Dublin.
T h e D errygonnelly Case {Proc. S .P .R ., Vol. X X V , p. 390,
1911):
“The cottage in which these phenomena were observed
was an isolated farmhouse occupied by a grey-headed
farmer who had recently lost his wife, and a family of
four girls and one boy. The youngest was about ten years
of âge, and the eldest, Maggie, round whom the disturb­
ances centred, was about twenty. The noises generally
began after they had retired and often continued ail
through the night. Rats of course were first suspected, but
when objects began to move without any visible cause,
stones to fall, candies and boots repeatedly thrown out of
the house, the rat theory was abandoned and a general
terror took possession of the family. Several neighbours
urged them to send for the priest, but they were M etho
dists, and their class leader advised them to lay an open
Bible on the bed. This they did in the name of God, put-
tîng a big stone on the top of the volume; but the stone
was lifted off by an unseen hand and the Bible placed on
top of it. After that, ‘if , as the farmer called the unseen
cause, moved the Bible out of the room and tore seventeen
pages right across. Sir William Barretfs own observations
were as follows : ‘After the children, except the boy, had
gone to bed, Maggie lay down on the bed without un-
dressing so that her hands and feet could be observed.
The rest of us sat round the kitchen fixe, when faint raps,
rapidly increasing in loudness, were heard, coming
apparently from the walls, the ceiling and varions parts of
84 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
the inner room, the door of which was open. On entering
the bedroom with a light the noises at fïrst ceased, but
recommenced when I put the light on the window-sill in
the kitchen. I had the boy and his father by my side, and
asked M r. Plunkett to look round the house outside.
Standing in the doorway leading to the bedroom the
noises recommenced^ the light was gradually brought
nearer, and after much patience I was able to bring the
light into the bedroom whilst the disturbances were still
loudly going on. A t last I was able to go up to the side of
the bed with the lighted candie in my hand, and closely
observed each of the occupants lying on the bed. The
younger children were asleep, and Maggie was motion-
less; nevertheless, knocks were going on everywhere
around; on the chairs, thebedstead, thewalls, and ceiling.
The closest scrutiny failed to detect any movement on the
part of those présent that could account for the noises,
which were accompanied by a scratching or tearing
Sound. Suddenly a large pebble fell in my presence on to
the bed; no one had moved to dislodge it even if it had
been placed for the purpose. When I replaced the candie
on the window-sill in the kitchen, the knocks became still
louder, like those made by a heavy carpenter’s hammer
driving nails into flooring.’
“On two successive evenings following this, Sir William
Barrett with Rev. Maxwell Chase, M r. Close, and M r.
Plunkett again heard these manifestations. Barrett said
that the entity would, at request, respond by the correct
number of raps to a number of which he thought. Four
times, with his hands in his overcoat pocket, he asked for
the number of fingers which he had extended— and this
was indicated correctly by the raps. On the second of
these occasions, the farmer begged the visitors not to leave
without riddingthem of the poltergeist. The clérical mem-
P S Y C H O - K I N E S I S A N D P O L T E R G E I S T S 85
ber of the party therefore conducted a short service. Sir
William says, ‘The noises were at first so great we could
hardly hear what was read, then as the solemn words of
prayer were uttered they subsided, and when the Lord’s
Prayer was joined in by us ail, a profound stillness fell on
the whole cottage. The farmer rose from his knees with
tears streaming from his eyes3 gratefully clâsped our
hands5 and we left for our long midnight drive back to
Enniskillen. I am afraid this does not Sound a very
scientific account, but it is a veracious one.’ There were
apparently no further disturbances from that night
onwards.”
Those who care to read the interesting accounts of the
Borley Rectory haunting w ill find abundant records of
poltergeist phenomena. H arry Price was himself a witness of
the end of the flight of a red glass candlestick down
the well of a staircase, the candlestick having been seen
a short time before on the mantelpiece of an upstairs
room. Such a flight must hâve involved turns round two
corners. The significance of this observation is that it was
obviously a case of guided flight rather than free flight in a
parabolic trajectory. There is some kind of intelligence
behind the manifestations specifically controlüng them. It is
not merely a case of the explosive release of an initial amount
of energy. This conclusion is supported by Barrett’s observa­
tion of an apparent télépathie rapport between the entity
and himself. Barrett also expresses the view that poltergeist
phenomena “can be inhibited by suggestion acting either
upon the human ‘radiant point’ or upon the unseen agency,
or upon both” .
One of the most striking features of the poltergeist
records is that in a*large majority of cases a young person
seems to be the unconscious agent of the effects. In most of
these cases it is a girl rather than a boy who is responsible.
P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
86
There seems considérable evidence that physiological
activity, and more particularly that of sexual change, is in
some of these cases closely linked up with the phenomena
(vide H arry Price : Poltergeist over E ngland, Ghapter
X X X ). It cannot be overlooked that even at Borley Rec-
tory, where the phenomena continued over many years and
cannot be associated with any one person alone, Mrs.
Foyster was a young woman, and Price informs us that
except for interludes there* had been young girls always
living there.
One of the most instructive cases of poltergeist phenomena
is that of Jean Baptiste Vianney, the famous Curé d5
Ars,
between 1786-1859. Here we find the poltergeist pheno­
mena, associated also with extra-sensory perception, being
produced and maintained by him for over thirty years. The
significant features— at least they are distinctive and un-
usual— would seem to be (a) his physical austerities and (b)
his mental attitudes. As to the first, he engaged rigorously in
ascetic practices, such as fasting, self-scourging, and going
without sleep. As to the second— apart from the influence of
the body on the mind— he gave himself to intense suppli-
catory prayer for his sinful “flock”, and considered that in
some way through his penance and suffering he was ex-
piating their guilt. Gerald Heard, commenting on the curé’s
energy output, remarks that “the source of the leakage must
be looked for in what we may call the psycho-physical belt
of the mind-body”. W ith this I agréé. What we hâve for
convenience called the ætheric body— the bridge between
the physical on the one hand and the lower-mind on the
other— was subjected by him to enormous stress from both
sides. It is in this “ætheric5
5région— and in this body or
vehicle— that we must look for the keys to ail poltergeist
phenomena.
We do not know enough to do more than speculate, and
P S Y C H O - K I N E S X S A N D P O L T E R G E I S T S 87
any théories put forward must be very tentative indeed. I
think we should recognise that on each significant level,
whether physical, ætheric, or mental, we hâve types of
energy characteristic of these world-levels. There is, for
example, the testimony of clairvoyants to the existence of
certain energy circulations in the ætheric body of Man (vide
Payne and Bendit : The Psychic Sense, p. 79. Faber & Faber,
1943). This has of course found no récognition yet by ortho-
dox psysiology. There can be no doubt, I think, from the évi­
dence of object-reading, of the existence in the psychic æther
associated with objects of emotional energy and thought-
characteristics. I extend this idea a little, and postulate that
associated with the psychic æther in certain places and in
certain pensons (like the Curé d’Ars) there hâve been built
up intense réservoirs of energy which seek to find release.
According to their nature and provided a person of the right
type of ætheric body is available, these réservoirs of energy
can be dissipated. The phenomena may be sensory in some
cases, giving rise to visual apparitions (ghosts), or auditory in
other cases, or the phenomena may be kinetic, as when
material objects are hurled about. We hâve then what is
effectively a transmutation of energy from one mode which
we may broadly call psychical to another which we describe
as physical. Such transmutation is not, I venture to think,
commonplace or easily effected; if it were, we should
probably never hâve had a pnnciple of conservation of
energy in physics.
It may be that when the ætheric vehicle is of a certain
quality or in a State of instability and change (as in
adolescence), the possibilities of this transmutation are
présent with startling results.
So m e Spéc u la tio n s
It is perhaps unwise to speculate in a field where so little
is known. It is, however, easy and tempting to do so, and
88 P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
perhaps some justification may be found in the possibility
that enquiry and research, which are so urgently needed,
w ill be stimulated.
I hâve avoided so far expressing any views about the
nature of the poitergeist. Those who would tentatively
accept the release of a dammed-up réservoir of energy in
the psychic æther as the proximate cause of poitergeist
phenomena, may wish me to indicate the origin of such a
réservoir. In the case of the Curé d’Ars, he himself, by his
practices, created and constantly replenished it. In the case
of many others— where the phenomena appear to be
associated with a person rather than with a place— they may
be unconsciously the creators and sustainers of the réservoir
of energy. Where the phenomena appear linked with a place
or locality, we may regard it as the legacy of intense stress
or émotion in which persons who once lived there were con-
cerned. Clearly, however, it îs only one further step to the
spiritistic hypothesis, if it be assumed that the discamate
mind which once created this emotional réservoir is still in-
terested in maintaining it. Sir William Barrett indeed says :
“Possibly these poitergeist phenomena may be due to some
of these mischievous or rudimentary intelligences in the
unseen : I do not know why we should imagine there are no
fools or naughty children in the spiritual world; possibly
they are as numerous there as here.” It may be so ! When
little boys throw stones into a pool, we do not seek for the
meaning or purpose behind their activity; it is sufficient to
assume that it affords them pleasure— and perhaps even
greater pleasure if they fïnd it irritâtes grown-ups !
In an interesting paper by D r. John Layard (Proc. S .P .R .,
Vol. X L V II, p. 237,* 1945), which created much con-
troversy, two cases are described of a psychological kind in
which dramatic poitergeist effects were regarded as
associated with the process of mental healing. If such be true
P S Y C H O - K I N E S I S A N D P O L T E R G E I S T S 89
we hâve here an energy transmutation in which mental
stress disappears and kinetic energy is manifested.
The apparently controlled lifting of heavy objects (to
which Crookes refers) suggests the possibility that such forces
may hâve been used in the ancient world to effect engineer­
ing feats at which we wonder today. Huge tri-lithons like
those of Stonehenge, or the raising into position of stones
weighing up to 1,200 tons in the ancient temple of Baalbek,
are difficult to account for with the mechanical resources of
that time. No one has any knowledge of the limits to which
psycho-kinetic forces can reach. Those who are interested in
the literature of the great religions w ill find many examples
of recorded “miracles” in which such forces may hâve been
operative. The destruction of the walls of Jéricho (Joshua vi.)
described in the Old Testament, and the stilling of a storm
(Mark iv. 37-41) in the New Testament, may perhaps be
examples. St. Matthew describes very impressive psycho-
kinetic phenomena following the crucifixion (xxvii. 50-4).

PARA-NORMAL phenomena may be divided into two
broad groups, the subjective or extra-sensory, and the
objective or motor phenomena. Ghapters II, I II, and IV
dealt with the first group, while Chapter V and the présent
one deal with the latter group. To the plain man the
phenomena of matérialisation are perhaps the most extra-
ordinary of ail. They consist in the appearance of some kind
of material substance, which has apparently exuded from
the person of a medium. The substance, usually called
ectoplasm, is capable of being moulded into forms which
carry out intelligent movements.
These phenomena are comparatively rare, but their occur­
rence is attested by such able scientific investigators as D r.
Schrenck-Notzing, Dr. Osty, D r. Gustave Geley, Sir Oliver
Lodge, Sir William Crookes, Sir William Barrett, M . Camille
Flammarion, Professors Charles Richet and Driesch. These
men were ail fully aware of the possibilities of fraud, and
took steps to prevent it. None of these men were easy to con-
vince, none of them had anything to gain by stating their
conviction of the existence of these things. They did so
because they were honest men and felt in honour bound to
express their findings. It is quite true that a good deal of
fraud has been associated with the subject of physical
mediumship, and this has tended to make responsible people
view the whole field with mistrust. If, however, only 5 per
cent, of the phenomena were genuine we should, in the
scientific tradition, be in honour bound to investigate them
fully, and détermine their significance for our world-view.
M A T E R I A L I S A T I O N P H E N O M E N A 91
Speaking o f fraud, I think it is im portant to distinguish
between w hat w e m ay call conscious fraud and unconscious
fraud. As for the first of these, while some o f it has been
unscrupulous trickery for m onetary gain, this has seldom if
ever deceived com petent investigators. Som e conscious fraud
has arisen from vanity— as in the case of the Neapolitan
m edium Eusapia Palladino. She had demonstrated beyond
question her ability to create genuine phenomena, but these
were dépendent on a power w hich she could not control or
command. W hen, however, the power was w eak or not
présent, she was undoubtedly capable of resorting to trickery
if given the chance to do so. D r. H ereward Carrington has
said of her phenom ena : “E very group of scientific men that
ever experimented w ith Eusapia knew very w ell that she
w ould defraud them if the chance were given her to do so.”
Eusapia’s phenomena at their best were so extraordinary,
that R ichet says : “A il the men of science, without exception,
w ho experimented w ith her w ere in the end convinced that
sheproduced genuine phenomena.”
As for unconscious fraud, w e must remember that when
a m edium is in trance w e should not necessarily expect the
same standard o f conduct as would be anticipated in the
normal State. Indeed, there is m uch evidence to suggest that
in a trance a m edium is sometimes very suggestible, and that
if there are suspicions of fraud in the minds of investigators,
they m ay be communicated to deeper levels of the m edium ’s
m ind and productive of this very thing. W e shall now look
at some of the evidence of m atérialisation phenomena.
O s t y ’s E x pe r im e n ts w it h R udi S ch n eid er
In 1932, in his own laboratory in Paris, Dr. O sty m ade
experiments to test the psycho-kinetic power of the Austrian

half a minute or more, and when this happened flashlight
photographs showed the m edium fu lly controlled and re-
vealed nothing visible in the path of the beam. W hatever was
causxng the bell to ring had appréciable infra-red absorption,
but it could be dismtegrated by latéral illum ination of the
beam w ith visible light. In later experiments the bell was
replaced by a quick-period galvanom eter and a recording
drum, so that the observation of the infra-red beam could be
studied. It was observed that the process of obscuration had
a rhythm ic character w hich coincided w ith the rhythm of
breathing of the entranced medium. This observation, which
was carefully checked, suggests that the production of the
“ ectoplasm” was in some w ay linked w ith respiration. It is a
curious observation, and one w hich w ill hâve to be accounted
for when w e know more of the relations between the physical
and ætheric bodies.

Frank K luski was a Polish m edium — non-professional—
and Professor R ichet and D r. G eley m ade a joint investiga­
tion of his powers. In his presence w hile entranced, the so-
called ectoplasm issuing from his body was m oulded into
forms, such as hands and feet, and these w ould carry out
intelligent movements. T h e investigators provided in the
séance room a bath of molten paraffin w ax, and the idea
was that if an ectoplasmic form w ould dip itself into the w ax
a glove of w ax could be obtained w hich would rem ain as
permanent evidence. R ichet’s account is as follows :
“ G eley and I took the précaution o f introducing, un-
known to any other person, a small quantity of cholestérol
M A T E R I A L I S A T I O N P H E N O M E N A 93
into the bath of m elted paraffin w ax placed before the
medium durm g the séance This substance îs soluble in
paraffin w ax without discolourmg it, but on adding sul-
phunc acid it takes a deep violet-red tint; so that we
could be absolutely certain that any moulds formed
should be obtained from paraffin provided b y ourselves.
. . . D uring the seance the m edium’s hands were held
firmly by G eley and m yself on the right and left so that he
could not liberate either hand. T h e first mould obtained
was of a child’s hand, then a second of both hands (right
and left), and a third of a child’s foot. The creases in the
skin and the veins were visible on the plaster casts m ade
from the moulds.
“B y reason of the narrowness of the wrists, these
moulds could not hâve been made from living hands ; for
the whole hand would hâve had to be withdrawn through
the narrow opening at the wnst. Professional modellers
secure their results by threads attached to the hand which
are pulled through the plaster. In the moulds here con-
sidered there was nothing of the sort, they were produced
by a matérialisation followed by a de-materialisation.” —

T h e Ph e n o m e n a o f W . Sta in to n M o s e s
In early numbers o f the Proc. S.P.R. (Vols. IX and X I),
the reader w ill find a sélection of records edited by F. W . H .
M yers which cover phenom ena of great variety and of an
extraordinary character. W . Stainton Moses was bom in
Lincolnshire in 1839 and died in 1892. H e was an O xford
graduate, a curate in the Ghurch of England, and a man of
exem plary character. M yers wrote of him : “ M ore im portant
than the précisé degree of attractiveness or of spiritual re-
finement in M r Moses’ personal demeanour are the funda-
m ental questions of sanity and probity. O n these points
94 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
neither I myself, nor, so far as I know, any person
acquainted with M r. Moses hâve ever entertained any
d ou b t” M r. C. G. Massey, Barrister-at-Law, wrote : “How-
ever perplexed for an explanation, the crassest préjudice has
recoiled from ever suggesting a doubt of the truth and
honesty of Stainton Moses.5
3 T h e chief, and often only wit-
nesses of the phenomena were Moses3close friends Dr. and
Mrs. S. T . Speer and M r. F. W . Percival (Barrister-at-Law
and Exam iner in the Education Department). Dr. Speer was
a distinguished physician, having worked in the m edical
schools of London., Edinburgh, Paris, and M ontpelier, and
had held various hospital positions. H is cast of m ind was
thoroughly scientific and his disposition rather towards
matérialisai than towards a religious outlook. O f M rs. Speer,
M yers wrote : “ I regard her as an excellent witness.3
3
T h e physical phenomena covered a period of about eight
years, and for m any of the sittings there were independent
contem porary records by M rs. Speer and sometimes Dr.
Speer or M r. Percival. M yers had the opportunity of com-
paring and studying ail these, and w rote : C
C
I at least can see
no via media w hich can possibly be taken. T h e perm anent
fraud of the whole group or the substantial accuracy o f ail
the records are the only hypothèses w hich seem to me
capable of covering the facts. . . . M y only personal con­
tribution to the data before us lies in m y somewhat confident
impression that m y friends whom I am thus frankly discuss-
ing are and were in the habit of speaking the truth.3

From the hundreds of records, a sum m ary of the variety
of para-norm al phenom ena m ay be made. W here quotation
marks are used, the words are o f one o f the observers.
(i) A variety of raps “on door, sideboard, and walls ail
rem oved some distance from the table at w hich w e sat. These
raps could not possibly hâve been produced b y any human
agency ; of that I satisfied m yself in every conceivable w ay.3
3
M A T E R I A L I S A T I O N P H E N O M E N A 95
(2) Num erous lights “ usuaily like small illum inated globes
w hich shone brightly and steadily, often m oved rapidly
about the room and were visible to ail the sitters. U nlike
an ordinary lamp, they never threw any radiance around
them.”
(3) Scents o f various kinds were obtained. “ Sometimes
breezes heavy w ith perfum e swept round the cirde, at other
times quantities of liquidm usk, etc., would be poured on the
hands of the sitters and* by request, on our handkerchiefs.
A t the close of a séance scent was often found to be oozing
out of the m edium ’s head.”
(4) M usical sounds of great variety, intensity, and quality
where no musical instrument was présent in the room.
(5) W ritm g on a sheet of paper— answers to questions or
messages— a small piece of lead or a pencil being provided.
(6) M ovem ents of heavy bodies. “ T h e dining-table . . .
was m ade o f solid Honduras m ahogany, but at times it was
m oved w ith m uch greater ease than the combined efforts of
ail the sitters could accomplis!!.”
(7) T h e passage o f m atter through m atter : sometimes
called the phenomenon o f “ apports” . “ Photographe picture-
frames, books, and other objects were frequently so brought
both from rooms on the same floor and from those above as
well. H ow they cam e through the closed doors I cannot say,
except by sortie process of dematerialisation ; but corne they
certainly did, apparently none the worse for that process.”
These are of course bewildering phenomena, and the
reader m ay well read of them w ith incredulity. I f the friends
of Stainton Moses were the only responsible group to record
them, one w ould probably regard the probability o f self-
deception as greater than the probability of the events. T h ey
are, however, the kind of events recorded b y other careful
observers w ith several “physical” médiums. T h e reader w ho
wants to be satisfïed about the appearance o f such
g6 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
phenomena under conditions of rigorous control m ay read
some of the books by authorities such as Richet, Schrenck-
Notzing, and Price, mentioned at the end of this chapter.
Ph e n o m e n a o f N ik o l a e f f
In Proc. &.P.Æ., V ol. X L V II, p. 261, an account is given
of phenomena typical of most physical médiums. T h e inves-
tigating committee of six members signed the report and
testify to phenomena such as these (a self-lummous hand and
arm had been matenalised) :
“T h e luminous hand began soon to fly in the air and to
strike on the lamp glass cover and the counter shade with
such violence that it seemed as if these ought to fly into
splinters. A kind of savage bell-ringing was taking place.
U nder the eyes of ail those présent the luminous vapour-
hke hand suddenly tore off the lam p the silken shade and
tossed it through the opening in the curtain w ith such
violence towards Dr. Lestchinsky that the latter involun-
tarily drew aside. A fter the silken lam pshade had thus
flown out, the raps on the lam p grew w eaker and a second
luminous hand appeared on the m edium ’s left. Both
hands, still not quite materialised, form ed then a some-
thing like two luminous rays com ing out of the sides of
the m edium ’s body and separated from it by small dark
spaces. It seemed as if the medium, besides his two hands,
was now endowed w ith tw oother luminous hands m oving
in the air . . . they often flew aw ay from the m edium and
rapped violently upon the medium’s arm -chair or upon
its legs or upon the sofa. . . . A t times the hands w ould fly
from the medium still farther and blows were then heard
simultaneously on the ceiling, the floor, the walls, the
dining-table, the sideboard. . . . A fter which the right
luminous arm, having stretched itself towards the heavy
M A T E R I A L I S A T I O N P H E N O M E N A 97
sofa w hich stood in a corner nearby, began to displace it
towards those présent w ith a strength and adroitness
hardly accessible to an ordinary m an_
_ ”
If the reader desires further evidence of the same extra-
ordinary kind, where not m erely arms but a complété,
apparently solid living materialised figure appeared on
several occasions, he m ay consult Sir W illiam Crookes5book
Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism.
Sir Arthur Conan D oyle adds his testimony to that of
Crookes about the appearance of K atie K m g in the presence
of the m edium Florence Cook. A similar record has been
left by H arry Price of the appearance of a little girl Rosalie,
at a séance under conditions which heh ad himself controlled
in advance. Price was an experienced investigator and a
competent conjurer, and the detail of his account is remark-
able and impressive. These figures were touched, seen, and
heard, and were indistinguishable by the senses of the
observers from living normal human beings of flesh and
blood.
Such records hâve probably strained the credulity of
readers of this volum e to the lirait. W hat are w e to make of
them?
D is c u s s io n o f t h e Fa c t s
It seems to me, in the first place, that w e hâve to m ake up
our minds whether these and other records are factual.
W hen w e look at the names, the distinguished records, and
the compétence o f the men who, after m any years of study
o f these things, testified to w hat their own senses had
observed, w e cannot, I think, do other than regard them as
facts. These were men not easily duped : they required un-
questionable evidence under their own conditions. Above ail,
they had nothing to gain b y their testimony, except the
p.r.— 4*
P S Y C H I C A t R E S E A R C H
98
approval by their consciences of an attitude of courageous
honesty. In the second place, there seems to be no half-w ay
house in which w e can rest. If one single indubitable
matérialisation— even of a little finger— is adm itted, there
is no rational point at w hich w e can stop and say
“ impossible” .
W hat do the observations of “m atérialisation” am ount to?
This surely : that our senses record data5 i.e. visual data of
shape and colour and movement, tactile data of résistance
to touch, etc., similar to commonplace everyday sense-data,
but under conditions where w e should not expect to find
them. W hen w e ask ourselves w hat is the status of tables and
rocks and trees and living bodies, w hich we interpret as a
world outside ourselves, w e réalisé w hen w e think deeply
about it that this is our m ind’s interprétation of electrical
excitement in various parts of our cérébral cortex. If w e ask
ourselves w hy w e interpret the electrical excitem ent in this
strange w ay, it must surely be because the nature of our
minds is alun to, and in some rapport with, a D ivine M ind
w hich sustams these appearances— these other electrical
Systems— the rocks and trees and bodies. It créâtes and sus-
tains these things, and indeed the w hole phénom énal world
of sense-data owes its origin, préservation, and change to this
all-embracing m ental field. Em bedded within it are these
finite minds of ours, foci of limited observation and activity,
and perhaps it is possible and reasonable to see in so-called
m atérialisation phenomena a feeble, finite, and highly
localised m im icry of the world-creation of sense-data. T h e
“normal” world displays qualities o f perm anence w hich our
finite localised imitations are far from realising. This is quite
obvions, but m ay not the nature of the process be the same?
T here is a différence between m oving a die and m oving a
m ountain, between the para-norm al billowing of a curtain
M A T E R I A L I S A T I O N P H E N O M E N A 99
and the sustained trade winds, between a materialised hand
which lasts five minutes and a physical body w hich is useful
for seventy years5but perhaps the différence is one o f degree
in both space and time.
If we try to visualise in a little more detail how m atérialis­
ation opérâtes, I think w e must look at the normal
phenomenon of growth in Nature. If we ask such questions
as : W hy does a beech-tree produce only beech leaves and
not serrated leaves like the oak or a fan of leaves like the
horse-chestnut? W hy does a flower grow to its particular
pattern and shape, and no other? W hy does the repair of a
wound follow the pattern o f the original form and not
create an anatom ical monstrosity? W e must visualise the
existence of a force-field, a sort of three-dimensional pattern
to which w hat w e loosely call “m atter5
5 must conform. T h e
m edium in w hich this idea-pattern is sustained is our old
friend the psychic æther. Sense-data clothe this idea pattern
in the psychic æther as flesh clothes the skeleton. W e know
nothing, absolutely nothing of the process. A il w e can say is
that it seems possible— even probable— that in the m atérialis­
ation phenomena w e hâve an activity of our finite individual
minds w hich is of the same nature. If so, then the study of
the conditions of this créative and artistic activity in our-
selves— this so-called para-norm al activity— should offer us
basic dues to the nature of the physical world, and especially
to the nature of living things and the laws of growth.

H E R E has been m ade a number of collections of
apparitions or phantasms. O ne of the earliest of these
was Phantasms of the Living b y Gurney, M yers and Pod-
more in 1896. M rs. H enry Sidgwick published a collection
(Proc. S.P.R., V ol. X X X I I I , 1923) covering the period
1886-1920. Sir Ernest Bennett published fifty new cases in
I 9 3 9 ‘m a book called Apparitions and Haunted Hanses. T h e
most im portant single investigation ever m ade was that of a
committee of the S.P.R., w ho published their findings in
1894 (Proc. S.P.R., V ol. X ). It is a docum ent o f about 400
pages, and is a summary and analysis o f the results of a
questionnaire ta which 17,000 answers were received. T h e
question was— “H âve you ever, when believing yourself to
be com pletely awake, had a vivid impression of seeing, or
being touched b y a living being or inanîm ate object, or of
hearing a voice; which impression, so far as you could dis­
cover, was not due to any external physical cause.” O f the
total replies about 9*9 per cent, answered “yes” . W omen
appeared to be rather m ore perceptible than men, since
7*8 per cent, of the men and 12 per cent, o f the women
answered “ y es” * O f the affirmative answers about 32 per
cent, were apparitions of living persons, 14 per cent, of dead
persons and 33 per cent, of unrecognised persons. T h e re-
m aining 21 per cent, were not of persons, or w ere incom-
pletely developed. As regards the nature of the hallucina­
tion : 55 per cent, were exclusively visual, 25 per cent,
purely auditory, 7 per cent, purely tactile, and the balance
102 PS Y C H Ï C A L R E S E A R C H
were cases in which two or more of these senses were simul-
taneously involved.
T h e most outstanding contribution m ade so far to the
theoretical aspect of the subject is that of G. N. M . Tyrrell,
whose book, Apparitions, first published in 1943, ^aarks a
landmark in the study of the subject. In the four sections
which follow are presented a few illustrative examples that
cover the facts which we shall then proceed to discuss.
E x pe r im e n ta l A ppa r itio n s
It m ay be a m atter of surprise to the reader that there
are records of apparitions experim entally produced. Some
examples are given below.
Case of Miss Danvers and Mrs. Fleetwood {Proc. S.P.R.,
V ol. X , p .4 18 ):
These two ladies were well-known to F. W . H . M yers,
who says : “ I asked Miss Danvers to appear to M rs. Fleet­
wood without forewarning that lady and to send m e a letter-
card to tell m e of the attem pt before she knew w hether it
had succeeded or no. O n June 20th, 1894, M yers received
the following letter dated June i9th from Miss Danvers :
“ O n Sunday night (June 17A ) at 12 p.m. I tried to
appear to Mrs. Fleetwood (at a distance of about 9 miles)
and succeeded in feeling as if I were really in her room.
I had previously written m y statement, w hich I enclose,
together w ith M rs. Fleetwood’s, w hich she has just sent
me. She wrote it also at the time, not knowing I was
trying to appear. I was lying down, not kneeling, but the
other details are correct.”
T h e two enclosures were first a signed m ém orandum by
Miss Danvers :
“June i7th, 1894, 12 P-m - I w rite this just before trying
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S IO3
to appear to M rs. F. M y hair is down, and I am going to
lie down and try to appear w ith m y eyes closed.”
T he second m émorandum signed b y M rs. Fleetwood was
as follows :
“ Sunday night, June I7th, 1894— I woke from m y fïrst
sleep to see Edith Danvers apparently kneeling on an
easy chair by m y bedside, her profile turned towards me,
her hair flowing, and eyes closed, or looking quite down.
1 felt startled at first, as I always do, on seeing visions in
w aking moments, but determmed to keep quiet; and after
I was fully awake and able to reason w ith m yself the
figure still remamed, and then gradually faded like a
dissolving view. ï got up and looked at the clock. It was
just twelve. I was alone in the room. As I now write, it is
about two minutes after twelve.”
M yers says that in conversation w ith Miss Danvers on
June 23rd, she said she had seen in a sort of flash M rs. F.
start up in bed, rest on her elbow and look towards her. She
had not been clearly aware of her own attitude in M rs. F .’s
room, although she seemed aw are of her position w hich
corresponded to the place towards w hich M rs. Fleetwood
gazed.
Case of H. M. Wesermann (F. W . H. M y e r s : Human Per-
sonahty, V ol. I, p. 699).
H . M . W esermann had m ade numerous attempts to
transfer m ental images to sleeping friends— Le. to impress
dreams upon them. H e had been successful in four previous
cases. T h e experiment described below resulted in an ap­
parition. T h e intention in W esermann’s m m d was that in a
dream a lady who had been dead five years should appear
to L ie u t.------ n and incite him to good deeds. Contrary to
expectation, L ie u t.------ n had not gone to bed at the time
104 P S Y G H X G A L R E S E A R C H
of the experiment, but was discussing the French cam paign
with his friend Lieut. S------ in an ante-room. L ie u t.--------n
said that suddenly the door o f the room opened, the lady
entered, dressed in white w ith a black kerchief and un-
covered head, greeted S------ w ith her hand three times in a
friendly manner, then turned t o ------ n, nodded to him and
returned through the doorway. Lieut. S------ gave the fol-
lowing written account of the incident :
“ H e r r ------ n cam e to pay m e a visit at m y lodgings
about a league from A ------ . H e stayed the night w ith me.
A fter supper, and when w e were both undressed, I was
sitting on m y bed and H e r r ------ n was standing b y the
door of the next room on the point also of gom g to bed.
This was about half-past ten. W e w ere speaking partly
about indifferent subjects and partly about the events of
the French cam paign. Suddenly the door opened without
a Sound, and a lady entered, very pale, taller than H err
------ n, about five feet four inches in height, strong and
broad of figure, dressed in white, but w ith a large black
kerchief which reached to below the waist. She entered
with bare head, greeted m e w ith the hand three times in
com plim entary fashion, turned round to the left towards
H err ------ n, and waved her hand to him three times;
after which the figure quietly, and again w ithout any
creaking of the door, went out. W e follow ed at once in
order to discover whether there was any déception, but
found nothing. T h e strangest thing was this, that our
night-watch of two men, whom I had shortly before found
on the watch, were now asleep, though at m y first call
they were on the alert, and that the door of the room,
w hich always opens with a good deal of noise, did not
m ake the slightest Sound when opened b y the figure.”
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T 1 N G S IO5
It should be unnecessary to say that the dead wom an
had nothing to do w ith the appearance of the apparition.
This case shows the feature of collective percipience, even
though the agent, W esermann, did not know there were two
possible percipients.
C risis A pparitio n s
Case of Han. Miss K. Ward:
“ T w o years ago, on awaking one m orning at 8 o’clock,
I saw a distinct appearance of m y sister Em ily, seated at
the foot of m y bed in her nightgown. She was rocking
herself backwards and forwards as if in pain. Putting out
m y hand to touch her, the phantasm vanished. Going
into m y sister’s room h alf an hour later, I related to her
m y expérience, and she (being stxll in m uch pain) in-
formed me that at 8 o’clock she had actually been in the
position above described on her own bed and had medi-
tated com ing into m y room, but had not liked to disturb
me. (She had been perfectly well the night before.) M y
sister’s room is at some distance from mine, being divided
therefrom b y a corridor and cross-door.”
Case ofMr. Kearnei;
M r. Kearne, w ho was the percipient, had lived for some
years w ith two intim ate friends, Alfred H obday and Arthur
Bent. H e was expecting them back about io p.m. from a
musical tour of the provinces, and was sitting reading about
10.50 p.m.
“ I had read some tw enty minutes or so, was thoroughly
absorbed in the book, m y m ind was perfectly quiet, and
for the time being m y friends were quite forgotten, when
suddenly, without a moment’s w am ing, m y whole being
106 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
seemed roused to the highest State of tension or aliveness,
and I was aware, w ith an intenseness not easily im agined
by those who hâve never experienced it, that another being
or presence was not only in the room but close to me. I
put m y book down, and although irry excitem ent was
great, I felt quite collected and not conscious of any sense
of fear. W ithout changing m y position and looking
straight at the fire, I knew somehow that m y friend A . H .
was standing at m y left elbow, but so far behind m e as to
be hidden by the arm -chair in which I was leaning back.
M oving m y eyes round slightly w ithout otherwise chang­
ing m y position, the lower portion of one leg became
visible, and I instantly recognised the grey-blue m aterial
of trousers he often wore, but the stuff appeared semi-
transparent, rem inding m e of tobacco smoke in con-
sistency, I could hâve touched it w ith m y hand w ithout
m oving more than m y left arm. W ith that curious instinc­
tive wish not to see m ore of such a ‘figure’, I did no more
than glance once or twice at the apparition, and then
directed m y gaze steadily at the fire in front of me. A n
appréciable space of time passed— probably several
seconds in ail, but seeming in reality m uch longer— when
the most curious thing happened. Standing upright be-
tween m e and the window on m y left, and at a distance
of about four feet from m e and almost im m ediately be­
hind m y chair, I saw perfectly distinctly the figure o f m y
friend— the face very pale, the head slightly thrown back,
the eyes shut, and on one side o f the throat, just under
the jaw , a wound w ith blood on it. T h e figure rem ained
motionless with the arms close to the sides, and for some
time, how long I cannot say, I looked steadily at it; then
ail at once roused myself, turned deliberately round, the
figure vanished, and I realised instantly that I had seen
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S 107
the figure behind m e w ithout m oving from m y first posi­
tion— an impossible feat physically. I am perfectly cer­
tain I never m oved m y position from the first appearance
of the figure as seen physically, until it disappeared on m y
tum ing round.”
M r. K eam e described his anxiety for the following forty-
five minutes, until at 11.35 P-m * a hansom-cab drew up.
A . B. cam e upstairs and said, “ Corne and see A . H .; w hat
a state he is in !” T h ey found him in the bathroom with
collar and shirt torn open, bathing a wound under his jaw
which was bleeding. It appeared that they had been to a
restaurant after arriving in London, that A . H . had com-
plained of feeling faint from the heat of the place, and going
out into the fresh air had fainted and fallen forward, strik-
ing his jaw on the edge of the kerb. M r. K eam e calculated,
from the distance and average speed o f a cab, that this in­
cident must hâve been within about three minutes o f the
time of appearance of the apparition.
PO ST-M O R TEM APPARITIONS
Case of Miss L. Dodson:
“ O n June 5th, 1887, a Sunday evening, between 11 and
12 at night, being awake, m y name was called three times.
I answered twice, thinking it was m y uncle, ‘Corne in,
U ncle George, I am awake’, but the third time I recog-
nised the voice as that of m y mother, who had been dead
16 years. I said ‘M am m a !’ She then cam e round a screen
near m y bedside with tw o children in her arms, and
placed them in m y arms and put the bedclothes over them
and said, £
Lucy, promise me to take care o f them, for their
m other is just dead.’ I said, ‘Yes, m am m a.’ She repeated,
‘Promise m e to take care of them.’ I replied, e
Yes, I
promise you,’ and I added, ‘Oh, mamma, stay and speak
108 P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
to me, I a m s o wretched.’ She replied, ‘N ot yet, m y child.’
T hen she seemed to go round the screen again, and I re-
mained, feeling the children to be still in m y arms, and
fell asleep. W hen I awoke there was nothing. Tuesday
mormng, June yth, I received the news of m y sister-in-
law’s death. She had given birth to a child three weeks
before, which I did not know till after her death.
“ I was in bed but not asleep, and the room was lighted
by a gas-light in the Street outside. I was out o f health
a^d in anxiety about fam ily troubles, M?y âge w as 42. I
was quite alone. I mentioned the circumstances to m y
uncle the next m om ing. H e thought I was sickening for
brain fever. [I hâve had other expériences, but] only to
the extern of having felt a hand laid on m y head, and
sometimes on m y hands, at times of great trouble.”
T o questions put to Miss Dodson the following answers
were received :
“ (1) ‘Y es [I was] perfectly awake [at the time].’
“(2) ‘W as she in anxiety about her sister-in-law?’ ‘N one
whatever; I did not know a second baby had been
born, in fact, had not the remotest idea of m y sister-
in-law’s illness.’
(3) Did she think at the time that the words about the
children’s mother having died referred to her sister-
in-law? Had she two children?’ ‘No, I was at a total
loss toimagine whose children they were.’
“ (4) ‘I was living in A lbany Street, R egent’s Park, at the
time. M y sister-in-law, as I heard afterwards, was
confined at St. André (near Bruges), and rem oved to
Bruges three days prior toh er death. (N.B.— She had
tw o children including the new-born baby.)’
(5) My late uncle only saw business connections, and
having no relations or personal friends in London,
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S IOg
save myself, would not hâve been likely to mention
the occurrence to anyone.5”
Case of Mr. F. G. {Proc. S.P.R., V ol. V I, p. 17) :
“ In 1867, m y only sister, a young lady of 18 years, died
suddenly of choiera, in St. Louis, M o. M y attachm ent for
her was very strong, and the blow a severe one to me. A
year or so after her death the writer became a commer­
cial traveller, and it was in 1876 while on one of m y
W estern trips that the event occurred.
“ I had ‘drummed5the city of St. Joseph, M o., and had
gone to m y room at the Pacific H ouse to send in m y
orders, w hich were unusually large ones, so that I was in
a very happy fram e of mind indeed. M y thoughts, of
course, were about these orders, knowing how pleased m y
house w ould be at m y success. I had not been thinking of
m y late sister, or in any manner reflecting on the past. T h e
hour was high noon, and the sun was shining cheerfully
into m y room. W hile busily smoking a cigar and w riting
out m y orders, I suddenly became conscious that some-
one was sitting on m y left, w ith one arm resting on the
table. Q uick as a flash I turned and distinctly saw the
form of m y dead sister, and for a brief second or so looked
her squarely in the face; and so sure was I that it was
she that I sprang forward in delight, calling her b y name,
and, as I did so, the apparition instantly vanished. N atur-
ally I was startled and dumbfounded, almost doubting
m y senses; but [with] the cigar in m y mouth, and pen in
hand, and w ith the ink still moist on m y letter, I satisfied
myself I had not been dream ing and was w ide awake. I
was near enough to touch her, had it been a physical
possibility, and noted her features, expression, and details
of dress, etc. She appeared as if alive. H er eyes looked
km dly and perfectly natural into mine. H er skm was so
110 P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
Iife-like that I could see the glow or moisture on its sur­
face, and, on the whole, there was no change in her ap-
pearance, otherwise than when alive.
“N ow cornes the most rem arkable confirmation of m y
statement, which cannot be doubted b y those w ho know
w hat I State actually occurred. This visitation, or what-
ever you m ay call it, so impressed m e that I took the next
train home, and in the presence of m y parents and others
I related w hat had occurred. M y father, a man of rare
good sense and very practical, was inclm ed to ridicule
me, as he saw how earnestly I believed w hat I stated ; but
he, too, was amazed when later on I told them of a bright
red line or scratch on the right-hand side of m y sister’s
face, which I distinctly had seen. W hen I mentioned this,
m y m other rose trembling to her feet and nearly fainted
away, and as soon as she sufficiently recovered her self-
possession, w ith tears streaming down her face, she ex-
claimed that I had indeed seen m y sister, as no living
mortal but herself was aware of that scratch, w hich she
had accidentally m ade while doing some little act o f kind-
ness after m y sister’s death. She said she well remembered
how pained she was to think she should hâve, unintention-
ally, m arred the features of her dead daughter, and that
unknown to ail, how she had carefully obliterated ail
traces of the slight scratch with the aid o f powder, etc.,
and that she had never mentioned it to a human being,
from that day to this. In proof, neither m y father nor any
of our fam ily had detected it, and positively were unaware
of the incident, yet I saw the scratch as bright as if just
made. So strangely impressed was m y m other that even
after she had retired to rest, she got up and dressed, cam e
to m e and told me she knew at least that I had seen m y
sister. A few weeks later m y m other died, happy in her
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S JII
belief she w ould rejoin her favourite daughter in a bettes
world.”
In a further letter M r. F. G. adds :
c
There was nothing of a spiritual or ghostly nature in
either the form or dress o f m y sister, she appearing per-
fectly natural, and dressed in clothing that she usually
wore in life, and w hich was fam iliar to me. From her
position at the table I could only see her from the waist
up, and her appearance and everything she wore is in-
delibly photographed in m y mind. I even had tim e to
notice the collar and little breastpin she wore, as w ell as
the comb in her hair, after the style then worn b y young
ladies. T h e dress had no particular association for m e or
m y mother, no more so than others she was in the habit of
wearing; but today, w hile I hâve forgotten ail her other
dresses, pins and combs, I could gO‘ to her trunk (which
we hâve just as she left it) and pick out the very dress and
ornaments she wore when she appeared to me, so w ell do
I remember it.”
T he m other herself died a few weeks after the apparition
to her son. She was the one living person to whom the
“scratch” would hâve significance. It suggests that there
was definite purpose behind the appearance at that time.
H au n tin gs
There is a type o f apparition which appears to be linked
with a particular place, often a particular room or Jhouse. Its
behaviour is usually of the somnambulistic type. It carries
out a limited répertoire of actions of a stereotyped kind, and
then fades aw ay until the next appearance. This is of course
the traditional “ghost” . I shall give only one example, of
which the account is very m uch abbreviated-
112 PS Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
Thé Morton Case (Proc. S.P.R., V ol. V I I I , pp. 311-32) :
T h e six percipients in this case were ail interviewed by
F. W. H . Myers. T h e principal percipient, Miss R. G.
M orton, was a young m edical student, and the testimony
was very consistent. T h e phenomena covered a period of
years 1882-9, an<^ ^he full record is an impressive and
straightforward one, givm g an account of the large number
of occasions when it was seen and the num ber of witnesses
to it. There was substantial agreement in the descriptions of
the figure.
“ T h e figure was that of a tall lady, dressed in black of
a soft woollen material, judging from the slight sound in
moving. T h e face was hidden in a handkerchief held in
the right hand. . . . I saw the upper part of the left side
o f the forehead, and a little o f the hair above. H er left
hand was nearly hidden by her sleeve and a fold of her
dress. As she held it down, a portion of a w idow ’s cuflF
was visible on both wrists, so that the whole impression was
that of a lady in widow’s weeds. There was no cap on the
head, but a general effect of blackness suggests a bonnet,
with long veil or a hood.”
D uring the two years 1882-4 Miss M orton saw the figure
about half a dozen times, and on three separate occasions it
was seen by her sister, M rs. K ., by a housemaid, and b y her
young brother and another little boy. T h e appearances
reached a m axim um in July and August 1884, thereafter
gradually diminishing in frequency to 1889. From then on
the appearances ceased. T h e light muffled footsteps asso-
ciated w ith the figure persisted a little longer, but they also
eventually ceased. For the first two years Miss M orton de-
scribes it as appearing to be so solid and life-like that it was
often mistaken for a real person. It intercepted the light,
but M iss M . was not able to déterminé if the figure cast a
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S I I 3
shadow. Its appearance later became less distinct. T w ice
Miss M . reported having seen the figure pass through fine
strings, and says : “ It was not that there was nothing there
to touch, but that she always seemed ta be beyond me, and
if followed into a corner simply disappeared.” A n extract
from Miss M orton’s account w ill illustrate the type of ex­
périence.
“ O n the evening of August i ith w e were sitting in the
drawing-room w ith the gas lit but the shutters not shut,
the light outside getting dusk, m y brother and a friend
had just given up tennis, finding it dark ; m y eldest sister,
M rs. K ., and m yself both saw the figure on the balcony
outside, looking in at the window. She stood there for
some minutes, then walked to the end and back again,
after which she seemed to disappear. She soon after came
into the drawing-room, w hen I saw her but m y sister did
not. T h e same evening m y sister E. saw her on the stairs
as she cam e out of a room on the upper landing.
“ T h e following evening, i2th August, while com ing up
the garden, I walked towards the orchard, when I saw
the figure cross the orchard, go along the carriage drive in
front of the house, and in at the open side door, across
the hall and into the drawing-room, I following. She
crossed the drawing-room and took up her usual position
behind the couch in the bow window. M y father cam e in
soon after and I told him she was there. H e could not see
the figure, but went u p to where I showed him she was.
She then went swiftly round behind him, across the room,
out of the door and along the hall, disappearing as usual
near the garden door, w e both following her. W e looked
out into the garden, having first to unlock the garden
door, but saw nothing of her.
“ O n I2th August, about 8 p.m. and still quite light, m y
114 P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
sister E. was singing in the back drawing-room . I heard
her stop abruptly, corne out into the hall and call me. She
said she had seen the figure in the drawing-room close
behind her as she sat at the piano. I w ent back into the
room with her and saw the figure in the bow w indow at
her usual place. I spoke to her several times, but had no
answer. She stood there for ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour; then went across the room to the door and along
the passage, disappearing in the same place b y the garden
door.
“ M y sister M . then came in from the garden, saying she
had seen her coming up the kitchen steps outside. W e ail
three then went into the garden, when M rs. K . called out
from the window on the first storey that she had just seen
her pass across the lawn in front and along the carnage
drive towards the orchard. This evening then, altogether
four people saw her. M y father was then aw ay and m y
youngest brother was out.”
Miss M orton remarks that the figure was not called up by
a desire to see it, and says that on ail those occasions when
parties of them had sat up at night hoping to see it, they
had always been disappointed. T h e figure was believed to be
connected w ith a lady w ho had lived in thehouse (the second
Mrs. S.) and w ho had died in Septem ber 1878. M r. S., an
Anglo-Indian, had lived in the house from 1860 to 1876. His
first wife, to whom he was deeply attached, died, and he
becam e an intem perate drinker. H is second w ife had hoped
to cure him, but instead took to drinking herself, and their
life was embittered and quarrelsome. T h e grounds for iden-
tifying the figure w ith the second M rs. S. were (a) the
widow’s garb— M r. S. had died two years before she did; (b)
several people who had known her identified her from the
description, and Miss M orton picked out the sister of M rs. S.
from a number of portraits as being most like the figure.
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S I I 5
Miss M orton gives grounds for believing that the appari­
tion was on two occasions seen by dogs. She also< makes the
interesting observation that when fam iliarity w ith the appar­
ition had eliminated her feelmgs of awe, so that she could
be analytical and observe more closely, she was “ conscious of
a feeling o f loss, as if I had lost power to the figure3
’.
T he N ature of A pparitions
M an y questions now arise for us. Are they objective or
subjective phenom ena; that is5 do they differ in their nature
from tables and chairs and bodies of people whom w e see
around us? H ow are they created? W hy do they not last
long? Is there any evidence that they are sometimes visita­
tions of departed persons, etc.?
It w ill not be possible to go into these questions fully here,
and the reader is referred to>books of Tyrrell and others (see
list at the end of this chapter). As a prelim inary to consider-
ing the nature of apparitions^ we must consider the nature
of ordinary perception. W hen a person says “ I see a green
apple” , this act of perception is not so simple as the plain
m an supposes. T h e person is, in fact5 aware of certain sense-
data, such as a shape o f greenness, w ith shiny patches and
having a nearly circular outline. These sense-data are' ail he
really knows, but in the act of perception he makes an
intuitive jum p beyond the sense-data and assumes that out
there in space is an object, and that the greenness, shininess,
and roundness are properties of that object’s surface. If w e
think carefully about it, w e see that w e hâve no direct
acquaintance of this sort w ith things outside ourselves; w e
only hâve direct acquaintance w ith our own sense-data.
Indeed, one person (who is colour blind) m ight think the
apple was grey, another m ight see it without shine or oval
in shape. W ho is right— if these properties belong to the
P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
116
object’s surface? Since m any observers m ay each hâve sense-
data w ith m uch in common, and since using the sense of
touch they m ight ail agréé that there was an im pénétrable
région of space outside themselves to w hich their sense-data
seemed causaily related, they m ight agréé to refer to this
région as the cause of their apple-like sense-data. (They
m ight call it a subsistent object.) W e m ight put down the
simple équation :
M aterial object for a person = Subsistent object plus
person’s sense-data.
O f the nature of the subsistent object to w hich the indi-
vidual’s sense-data are causaily related we know nothing
and can know nothing through our senses. It m ay w ell be
that the world of subsistent objects îs a world of ideas sus-
tained by a D ivine m ind— that subsistent objects are, in fact,
of the nature of thought. Indeed, if w e try to im agine them
as anythm g else, w e find that w e are really attaching
properties of a sensory kind to them. T h e process o f creating
and sustaimng w hat we call the order o f N ature m ay thus
be something as follows. T here is a world of Ideas (or sub­
sistent objects). This in its turn créâtes and sustains a world
of an infinité variety of sense-data. O u r fimte m inds are
limited in the sélection of sense-data they can respond to
(because the spécial senses are limited in their range). Since
w e hâve finite minds in some sense akin to the D ivine mind,
w e then interpret the sense-data as proceeding from a
m aterial object. This is our feeble entering into knowledge
o f the original Idea.
G. N. M . Tyrrell regards the apparition as an aggregate
of sense-data without the subsistent object. (See the above
équation.) His view is that the sense-data are real enough,
but that their perception is not stimulated by light waves
falling on the retina, or Sound waves on the eardrum, or
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S 1 17
pressure on the hand. T h e sense-data are stimulated in-
w ardly or centrally— by psychical means. In ordinary per­
ception the sense-data are apparently stimulated through
light waves falling on the eye or Sound waves on the ear.
Even this, T yrrell thinks, m ay be misleading. H e suggests
that ail sense-data are “centrally” or psychically stimulated,
but that in ordinary perception the psychical stimulus semi-
autom atically follows the brain’s stimulus by a spécial sense.
It does so for m uch the same reason (viz. self-preservation)
as a motorist stops or starts following the signal of the traffic
lights. If, however, as in rare cases, the psychical stimulus is
given without the prior brain excitation by a spécial sense,
then w e hâve an apparition. Tyrrell would therefore view
apparitions as subjective. T h e sense-data are real enough—
but he would not adm it that apparitions reflect light so that
they could be photographed, or émit sound w hich could be
recorded on a tape, or exert pressure such as to m ove an
object or leave footprints.
O n the other hand, I consider that apparitions m ay hâve
the same sort of objectivity as chairs and tables. I take the
view that a finite mind (we call it the “agent” ) can do some-
thing similar to the créative activity of the D ivine mind, and
create a subsistent object w ith associated sense-data. It is
adm ittedly a weak and transient construction compared
with the strength and permanence of natural objects. A suit-
ably sensitive percipient m ay, however, perceive it in the
usual way. I think there is no essential différence between
the status of apparitions and ordinary objects : the contrast
is between their density and persistence in time, due to the
weakness of the subsistent object in the former case. Because
of their rare and unheralded appearance, the possibility of
photographing an apparition is obviously going to be small,
but there is one recorded instance w hich suggests that this
view m ay be correct and that they do scatter light. T h e

É
Captain Provand, A rt Director, and M r. Indre Shira,
Court Photographer of London, were photographing
Raynham H all, Norfolk, seat of the M arquess of Tow n-
shend. It was a routine commission. N either of these ex-
perienced photographers was interested in Psychical
Research. About 4 p.m. on September igth, 1936, they
were ready to photograph the oak staircase. M r. Shira,
observing w hat he described as ‘an ethereal veiled forai’
m oving slowly down the staircase, shouted excitedly, and
Captain Provand, whose head was under the cover, re-
moved the cap of the lens, w hile M r. Shira pressed the
flashlight pistol. Captain Provand was sceptical and not in
a position to hâve seen the apparition; M r. Shira stoutly
m am tained that he had seen it. W hen the négatives were
being developed Captain Provand suddenly exclaimed,
‘Good Lord, there’s something on the staircase négative
after ail.’ M r. Shira took a glance at the négative and
then hurried off to bring in M r. Jones, m anager of Blake,
Sandford and Blake, chemists, as a witness. H e arrived in
time to see the négative being taken from the developer
and placed in the hypo bath. M r. H arry Price examined
the négative, which he pronounced innocent of any faking,
and was unable to shake the witnesses’ story.”
O f course it m ay well be that the two viewpoints, T yrrell’s
and the présent writer’s, are both true, and represent two
different types o f apparition. W e tend too easily to im agine
that of two théories either one or the other must be right.
L et us look in a little more detail at the conditions under
w hich apparitions are created. There is alw ays apparently an
agent— the initiating mind. In the post-mortem cases this is
ostensibly the persisting discarnate mind. In cases of haunt-
ing this m ay also be true— but I shall m ake a réservation and
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S I i g
refer to this later. T h e agent initiâtes it and supplies the
original em otional energy to create and sustain it. T h e per­
cipient, however, plays a part which m ay not be quite so
passive as it appears to be on conscious levels. O ne of the
notable things is that where the apparition is of the agent’s
person, as w ith Miss Danver, Miss W ard’s sister, and Mr„
K earne s friend, the agent cannot be supposed to do more
than create the general idea of himself being m a certain
place, None of us know in detail w hat w e look like from a
point in space external to our body. T h e percipient5
s mind
clearly plays a part in this. Likewise the apparition often
does things the agent had not envisaged, and shows a know­
ledge of the environment in which it appears, which the
agent s conscious m ind does not possess. It w ould seem as
though there is a collaboration below the conscious level
between certain functions or levels o f the two minds, those of
agent and percipient.
Tyrrell considers that the apparitional structure is half-
w ay in its characteristics between the m echanical and the
purposive or volitional, and uses the term idea-pattern to
describe it. It is to be regarded as a psychical m arionette or
animated thought-form, and not as a vehicle of conscious-
ness. Its répertoire of actions is usually rather limited, and
having expended the lim ited energy w hich sustained the
subsistent idea-pattern, it fades out.
It m ay be asked what is the distinction between an appari­
tion and a materialised figure such as w e discussed in the
previous chapter. I do not think w e know enough to say
anything o f value. If we had to deal with a perfect appari­
tion, that is to say one w hich created the response of seeing,
hearing, and touching, there would be no grounds for distin-
guishing it from the body o f an ordinary person and any
distinction would hâve to be on the level of mental capacity.
M y inclination is towards the view that we m ay hâve a whole
120 PS Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
range of apparitions, from those of the “ T yrrell” type to
those full-scale, solid matérialisations such as Price and
Crookes recorded. T h e “ T yrrell” type is subjective and
psychically created by a co-operative activity between the
agent’s and percipient’s mind. It could not scatter light nor
create Sound, nor présent résistance to touch. T h e apparition
is, indeed, a vehicle for a télépathie stimulus received from
the agent’s mind, and the little dram atic scene is a joint
construction of certain levels of the two> minds. It is the sort
of créative activity which occurs frequently in dreams—
where, Jhowever, only the percipient’s m ind is supposed to be
involved. If w e feel the need for a m edium in w hich the
psychic draina is constructed— the psychic æther is to hand.
There seems to be another level of m ind w hich can now
become opérative and create the objective materialised
entity w hich in its perfection is indistinguishable b y any
physical test from a human being. W e m ay hâve apparitions
of an infinitely graded variety between these extremes. T h ey
m ay partake for the percipient of both the self and the not-
self. T h ey m ay be an adm ixture of the subjective and
objective. As I hâve said elsewhere— “ It is the level on w hich
awareness is focused w hich détermines w hat world w ill be
described as objective : expérience on levels interior to this
will then be described as subjective. This distinction is one
of convenience, but it does not correspond to anything sig-
nificant in the levels themselves : it describes only the rela-
tionship of an individual to these levels or worlds.” Thus in
dreams w e judge (at the time) the scenery to be objective,
but our thoughts are still subjective.
OüT-OF-THE-BODY EXPERIENCES
T h e apparitions so far discussed range from the subjective
psychical marionette w hich is anim ated by a few lim ited
ideas to the “full-blooded” materialised figure through w hich
A P P A R I T I O N S A N D H A U N T I N G S 121
a m ind appears to find more or less complété expression. T h e
phenomena of which I propose to give sonie examples now
are not, I think, related to apparitions, but this place m ay be
a convenient one to refer to them. In introducing them I
think it is suffîcient to saÿ this. T h e impression of those who
had the expérience was that they were outside their body—
which in some cases they could see lying on the bed or in
some other posture. H ere the agent, in full consciousness,
appears to be functioning in a subtle vehicle or body
although still connected by a sort of “ cord” w ith the physical
one. T h e agent does not, in the recorded cases, appear able
to manifest as an apparition to others. W hether this is pos­
sible or not must therefore remain an open question, but on
a priori grounds there would seem to benothing impossible in
it. T h e following cases are from Journ. S.P.R., Vol. X X X I V ,
pp. 206-11 (1948) :
Case 1:
“ I was stationed in Aden in 1913 and was seriously ill
w ith dysentery. I got to the stage of having to be lifted
from side to side, as I was too weak to move m yself in bed.
From the instructions I heard the M .O . give the orderlies
(we had no nurses in Aden then) I gathered that a collapse
was expected and that in the event of the occurrence I
was to be given a saline injection via the rectum.
“ Shortly afterwards, I found myself lying parallel to the
bed, about three or four feet above it and face downwards.
Below me I saw m y body and witnessed the giving of the
rectal injection. I listened to ail the conversation of the
two orderlies and of a strange M .O . who was directing
affairs and was indeed a very interested spectator of the
whole business. I remember well that the saline cam e from
an enamel kind of vessel w hich was connected to a rubber
tube— the vessel being held up at arm’s length b y an
orderly.
p.r.— 5
122 P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
“ I found myself next back in bed, feeling m uch better.
I told m y story to the orderlies, w ho w ere quite sceptical.
I particularly enquired about the strange M .O . I found
there had been one; he was en route for Bombay, I think,
and had called at the hospital in time to help. I never saw
him again.
“ I hâve always been convinced that m y spirit (or soûl if
you will) had actually left m y body but returned as a
resuit of the injection. W hen kindred subjects hâve
cropped up I hâve told friends of m y expérience. T h ey
hâve listened in a tolérant fashion, but I hâve alw ays felt
that m y story was really being received c
w ith nods and
becks and wreathed smiles5. Y ou m ay im agine then how
delighted I was to hear you narrate an almost similar ex­
périence— and I sat down im m ediately and wrote to
y o u . . . .
“ O n reading the above I find I hâve omitted to mention
that the orderlies said I couldn’t possibly hâve any know­
ledge of the matter, as I was quite unconscious before and
after the operation.5
3
Cases:
“ Six years ago I had pneumonia and pleurisy corn-
bined, and I remember the doctor saying (whilst in m y
room) that he could do no m ore and I must fight it out
myself. I cannot think I was supposed to hear this aside.
W ith w hat strength I had, I pinched m yself and said,
‘Y ou shall get better.3N bw this was the crisis. I feel quite
certain that I left m y body. I felt it getting heavier and
heavier and sinking into the bed. I was sitting on top o f a
high wardrobe near the door looking down on m y bed at
myself, and the nurse sittin gb y me. I was disgusted a t m y
unshaven appearance. I saw everything in the room — the
m irror on the dressing-table and ail small details. Fear was
A P P A R I T I O N S AND H A U N T I N G S 123
absent entirely. T h e next thing I remember was m y nurse
holding m y hand and shortly afterwards I heard her say :
‘T h e crisis has passed.5
“ Som e time after ali this I told the nurse w hat had
happened to me, described what she was doing at the
time and the details of the room. She said I was given up
and that it was because I was délirions.
“N o, I was dead for that time, but m ade m yself go
back.”
Case 3:
“ I was an armoured-car officer engaged in medium-
antl long-range reconnaissance work w ith the 2ist A rm y
Group. A t about 2 30 p.m. on August 3rd, 19 4 4 ,1 was in a
small armoured scout car which received a direct hit from
a Germ an anti-tank gun. O ur car, w hich was full of
various explosives, grenades, phosphorus bombs, etc.,
blew up. I m ight m ention that it was stationary at the
time, having just halted. T h e force of the explosion threw
m e about twenty feet aw ay from the car and over a five-
foot hedge. M y clothes, etc., were on fîre, and there were
various pièces of phosphorus sticking to m e w hich were
also bum ing. Now, m y immédiate reaction to the ex­
plosion, w hich appeared to m e from the m iddle of it like
a great white cold sheet, w ith a strong smell o f cordite,
was (naturally enough) fear. I imagined for a split second
that I had gone to hell, and I quickly tried to recollect
some particular vice w hich m ight hâve been m y qualifica­
tion. It is interesting to notice that I did not see any rapid
‘trader5 of m y past life as, I believe, drowning persons
report. A il this took a fraction of a second, and the next
expérience was definitely unusual. I was conscious of
being two persons— one, lying on the ground in a field
where I had fallen from the blast m y clothes, etc,, on
124 PS Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
fire, and w aving m y limbs w ildly, at the same tim e utter-
ing moans and gibbering with fear— I was quite conscious
of both m aking these sounds, and at the same time hearing
them as though coming from another person. T h e other
‘me’ was floating up in the air, about tw enty feet from
the ground, from which position I could see not only m y
other self on the ground, but also the hedge, the road, and
the car, which was surrounded by smoke and burning
fiercely. I remember quite distinctly telling myself, ‘It’s
no use gibbering like that— roll over and over to put the
fiâmes out.5 This m y ground body eventually did, rolling
over into a ditch under the hedge where there was a slight
amount of water. T h e fiâmes went out, and at this stage
I suddenly became one person again.
“ O f course, the aerial view point can be explained up
to a point as a ‘photograph5 taken subconsciously as I
was passing over the hedge as a resuit of the blast. This,
however, does not explain the facfc that I saw £
m yself on
the ground quite clearly and for w hat seemed a long time,
though it could not hâve been m ore than a m inute or so.
“N aturally there can be no witnesses as to this, and the
fact that I hâve told the occurrence to a num ber of people
since m ight hâve led m e to exaggeration of those details—
though I do not think this is the case. I can still remember
ail the details quite clearly as they happened at the time.”
T he above examples are cases where acute illness or shock
was the cause of the “projection” , but those w ho are in-
terested should study several books w hich relate expériences
b y S. J. M uldoon and others of an experimental kind. A il
such expériences need collating and studying for the light
they m ay throw on the structure o f the hum an psyché. T h e
late F. S. Sm ythe,a distinguished mountaineer, has described
in one of his books, The »
Spirit of the Hills, an occasion when
A P P A R I T I O N S AND H A U N T I N G S 125
he fully expected ta be killed. T he stress of the expérience
resulted in an out-of-the-body expérience— which can only
hâve lasted a few seconds— which he says convinced him
“ that consciousness survives beyond the grave” .

E are familiar with three States of consciousness : the
walcing State, the dreammg State, and the State of deep
dreamless sleep. There are, however, many other States in
which consciousness is withdrawn from the normal waking
level— which collectively we m ay call trance States. Some
can be created by hypnosis, some can be created by drugs
like mescaline or by anæsthetics, and others can be entered
by certain yogic practices. A “medium5
9 or a “sensitive5
9can
pass voluntarily mto one of these States, in which conscious­
ness is withdrawn to an interior level of the self, and can at
the same time mamtain a “communication line5
9
— by writing
or speaking to those around. It is therefore possible for a
sensitive to extériorise knowledge possessed by levels of his
own deeperself.
W e hâve seen something of the powers (^-faculty) of the
human mind, and in m edium istic trance such powers appear
frequently to be exercised. It is thus com m only found that
where persons are sitting w ith an entranced m edium they
m ay receive surprising information. T h e commonest of ail
phenom ena is the “w ithdraw al" of inform ation or know­
ledge from the m ind of one of the sitters (i.e. thought read-
ing or telepathy) and its re-presentation to the sitter through
the voice o f the medium. Another not uncom m on pheno-
menon is the présentation to the sitters of a piece o f inform a­
tion, not in their minds but w hich they can subsequently
verify as factual. This, of course, m ay be due to the m edium 9
s
exercise of clairvoyance. Rarer, but not uncommon, is the
présentation to a sitter of the prédiction of events w hich are
ME DI UM S HI P 127
subsequendy fulfilled. It is rarer, because the possibility of
access to precognitive data requires rapport between the
medium and certain deep levels of the sitter’s self.
T h e présentation of such data to a sitter by an entranced
m edium can be very impressive, and unless the sitter has an
appréciation of the range and possibilities of ÿ-faculty which
the m edium m ay be exercising, it is easy to assume that the
source must be some discarnate being, and to assume further
that this being has ipso facto access to ranges of inform ation
beyond our own. As regards the latter assumption, it m ay be
true, but how are w e to know in view of the potentially
unlim ited sweep of ^-faculty? As regards the former
assumption, which is of course basic to spiritualism, we shall
hâve to consider critically w hat evidence there is to support
it. W e shall do this in the présent chapter and the following
one. Proof of its truth is notoriously difficult to corne by, for
the reasons w e hâve just expressed. It w ill indeed be appre-
ciated that if w e postulate surviving discarnate beings, their
m ode of communication w ill presumably be through télé­
pathie rapport w ith the medium5s own subconscious. A n y
“p ro o f5 o f com munication from a discarnate m ind must
therefore dépend on a m yriad subtle psychological charac-
teristics of that deceased person which are convincing to
those w ho knew and remembered him. O f course the deter-
mined sceptic w ill m aintain that ail of these were drawn
from the memories of the sitter or of other persons. Some-
times a séance of personal interest to the sitters is invaded
b y an ostensibly deceased personality, w ho communicates
through the m edium and gives abundant inform ation of
himself of w hich none is known to the sitters. T h e deter-
m ined sceptic can still say that the medium5
s subconscious
m ind exercised ^-faculty to gather this correct information,
and that it was presented in a dram atic form and attributed
to a deceased person. Coercive “p ro o f5 is difficult to obtain,
128 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
and as w e shall see when discussing a num ber o f examples,
the decision as to which he considers the m ore probable
hypothesis is one for each individual to maire for himself.
T ypes of M ediumship
A broad subdivision m ay be m ade into (a) physical
médiums and (b) mental médiums. In the presence o f the
first type, para-norm al physical phenom ena occur, such as
psycho-kinetic effects, matérialisations, apports, etc. T he
second class is those w hich w e are now considering who
either through speech or writing, w hile in trance, provide
information of an extrasensory type. Phcebe Payne, in her
book hdcrn s Lûtcvit Pow&rs (Faber & Faber, 193^): has"made
a rough classification of sensitives w hich is based upon her
own clairvoyant perception of w hat is taking place in trance.
She wntes of : (a) T he natural poltergeist medium, (b) T h e
medium w ho uses unconscious self-hypnosis. In this group
there is^no evidence of any external m ind. A part of the
medium ’s own mind becomes a dram atic actor and imper-
sonates one character after another from Julius Cæ sar to
Q ueen V ictoria ! T h e sentiments attributed to them hâve
frequently an amusing sim ilarity to those o f the m edium ’s
own views. (c) T he m edium w ho appears partially con-
trolled. H ere the bizarre character of dram atic impersona-
tion has gone and the phenom ena ostensibly suggest a dis-
cam ate m ind com m um cating, presum ably by télépathie
rapport, w ith the medium, (d) T h e com pletely controlled or
dead-trance medium, where it is suggested that there is a
w ithdraw al of the “astral-projection” type, perm itting the
m anipulation of the physical mechanism o f the m edium by
a discarnate being. (e) T h e réceptive bu t self-controlled
medium, w ho remains self-conscious and directs his own
psychism at his own will. In effect, this type has para-norm al
MEDI UM S HI P 129
faculty w ell developed and can use it when he so détermines.
Such a classification is (without our prejudging the issue
of survival) a useful descriptive one. A t least it indicates the
variety of phenomena w hich are certain to be encountered
by anyone investigating mediumship. In the groups (6), (<
?),
and (d) a phenomenon known to investigators as the “guide”
or “control” frequently appears as soon as the medium passes
into trance. This invariably daim s to be a discarnate spirit
who has acquired some proficiency in m anipulating the
m edium ’s m m d or brain, as the case m ay be. H e daim s to
pass on messages from discarnate persons, to describe them,
and ifi general to act as a go-between. O ccasionally he w ill
step aside and allow the ostensible communicator to operate *
in his place directly through the medium’s entranced
organism. There has been m uch discussion of the status and
nature of these “controls” > w ho m ay d aim to be anything
from an innocent child to a R ed Indian chief. Substantially
there are two views about them. T h e control m ay be some
level or création of the medium’s subconscious m ind : a
secondary personality,, w ho frequently exemplifies traits and
qualifies excluded from the conscious personality. Such a
view sees in the existence of the “ control” a scapegoat or
convenient defence behind w hich the medium m ay shelter.
A n alternative view accepts their claim to be discarnate
beings and regards their fonction as protective against in-
discriminate invasion by others> and in some measure as
that of skilled m anipulation of the medium’s brain-
mechanism. I incline to think that both views m ay hâve
some truth in them3 but that the problem of communica­
tion m ay be more com plex than that assumed by these
points of view.
W e shall now look briefly at the activity of a number of
famous médiums.

T he M edium sh ip of M r s . Piper
M rs. Piper was an Am erican wom an whose mediumship
between 1884 and 1911 was closely studied b y some of the
ablest investigators in the field of Psychical Research. H er
mediumship m ay be conveniently regarded as fallm g into
four phases. (1) 1884-92. D uring this period her chief con-
trol was Phinuit, w ho claimed to be a French physician.
A number of others appeared from time to time w ho used
such names as “Chlorine” , M rs. Siddons, J. S. Bach, Long-
fellow, Commodore Vanderbilt, and an Italian girl, Loretta
Ponchmi. D uring this period the voice of M rs. Piper was
the means o f communication, and three reports werer pub-
lished— one by Professor W illiam James, one by an English
committee {Proc. S P.R., V ol. V I), and one by D r. Richard
Hodgson {Proc.y V ol. V III). (2) 1892-7. Phinuit still ap­
peared, but a friend of D r. Hodgson nam ed George Pelham
(“ G. P.” ), who died as the resuit of an accident, played a
dom inant rôle. A long report of this phase was m ade by Dr.
Hodgson {Proc.) V ol. X III) and Professor N ew bold (Vol.
X IV ). T h e chief means of com m unication was writing
while in trance, but quite frequently there would be simul-
taneous control, w ith Phinuit talking through M rs. Piperas
voice, and G. P. writing on a different them e through M rs.
Piper’s hand. (3) 1897-1905 (when H odgson died). D uring
this period a group of Controls, calling themselves Im perator,
Rector, Doctor, etc., who purported to be spirits w ho had
com municated through W . Stainton M oses when he was
alive, now took control. Reports of this period are found in
Proc., Vols. X V I and X X IV . (4) In the final phase, 1906-11,
a control claim ing to be H odgson also appeared, and reports
appear in Proc.) Vols. X X II, X X III, and X X IV . Finally, a
critical appraisal is m ade in a 600-page report (.Proc,, V ol.
X X V III ) by M rs. H enry Sidgwick in 1915.
MEDI UM S HI P 131
From this enormous mass of m aterial I shall select a few
opinions from the reports of D r. Hodgson (Vol. X III) and
Mrs. Sidgwick, since the conclusions arrived at b y these
investigators are opposed.
It is probably true that in the second phase of Mrs. Piperas
mediumship her faculty was at its best, and Hodgson writes
of the convincing communication of his friend G. P., to
whom he had introduced no fewer than 150 sitters, of whom
30 were friends of G. P. living. AU were recognised : “T h e
récognition was clear and full, and accompanied by an
appréciation of the relations which subsisted between G. P.
living and the sitters.”
“N early two weeks later cam e his most intimate friends
the Howards, and to these, using the voice directly, he
showed such a fullnessof private rem embranceand spécifie
knowledge and characteristic intellectual and emotional
quality pertaining to G. P. that, though they had
previously taken no interest in any branch of psychical
research, they were unable to resist the conviction that
they were actually conversing w ith their old friend G. P.
A nd this conviction was strengthened by their later ex­
périences. N ot least important, at that time, was his
anxiety about the disposai of a certain book and about
certain specified letters w hich concern matters too private
for publication. H e was particularly desirous of convinc­
ing his father, who lived in W ashington, that it was indeed
G. P. who was communicating, and he soon afterwards
stated that his father had taken his photograph to be
copied, as was the case, though M r. Pelham had not in-
formed even his w ife of this fact. Later on he reproduced
a sériés of incidents, unknown to the sitters, in which M rs.
H ow ard had been engaged in her own home. Later still,
at a sitting w ith his father and mother in N ew York, a
I32 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
further intimate knowledge was shown of private fam ily
circumstances, and at the following sitting, at w hich his
father and m other were not présent, he gave details of
certain private actions w hich they had done in the intérim.
A t their sitting, and at various sittings of the Howards,
appropriate comments were m ade concem ing different
articles presented which had belonged to G. P. living, or
had been fam iliar to him ; he enquired after other Per­
sonal articles, w hich were not presented at thé sittings,
and showed intim ate and detailed recollections of inci­
dents in connection w ith them. In points connected with
the récognition of articles w ith their related associations
of a personal sort, the G. P. com municating, so fa f as I
know, has never failed. N or has he failed in the récogni­
tion of personal friends. I m ay say generally that ont of
a large number of sitters w ho went as strangers to Mrs.
Piper, the com municating G. P. has picked out the friends
of G. P. living, precisely as the G. P. living m ight hâve
been expected to do, and has exhibited memories in con­
nection with these and other friends w hich are such as
would naturally be associated as part of the G. P. per-
sonality, w hich certainly do not suggest in themselves that
they originate otherwise, and w hich are accom panied by
the emotional relations w hich were connected w ith such
friends in the m ind of G. P. living. A t one of his early
communications G. P. expressly undertook the task of
rendering ail the assistance in his power towards estab-
lishing the continued existence of himself and other com-
municators, in pursuance of a promise of w hich he him ­
self reminded me, m ade some two years or m ore before
his death, that if he died before me and found himself
‘still existing*, he would devote himself to proving the fact,
and in the persistence of his endeavour to overcome the
difficulties in com m unicating as far as possible, in his
MEDI UM S HI P *33
constant readiness to act as amanuensis at the sittings, in
the effect w hich he has produced by his counsels, to m y-
self as investigator, and to numerous other sitters and
communicators, he has, in so far as I can form a judgm ent
in a problem so com plex and still presenting so m uch
obscurity, displayed ail the keenness and pertinacity
w hich were eminently characteristic of G. P. living.
“ Finally, the manifestations of this G. P. communicat-
ing hâve not been of a fitful and spasmodic nature; they
hâve exhibited the marks of a continuous living and per­
sistent personality, manifesting itself through a course of
ye<fcrs, and showing the same characteristics of an inde-
pendent intelligence whether friends of G. P. were présent
at the sittings or not.”
This is the sort of evidence which, at its best, is probably
the most convincing kind which we can hope ta get. It is
difficult to convey in a printed record the weight which
Personal reactions and peculiarities would convey to an
intimate friend,
Considering the hypothesis of telepathy between the liv­
ing as explanatory of ail these data, Hodgson says :
“A t the same time, if the information given at the
sittings, both in matter and form, was limited b y the
knowledge possessed by the sitters, w e should hâve no
hésitation in supposing that it was derived from their
minds, telepathically or otherwise; but enough examples
are cited in this report alone to show that the information
given is not so limited. W e must then make the arbitrary
suppositions that M rs. Piper’s personality gets into rela­
tion w ith the minds of distant living persons, (i) who are
intimate friends of the sitters at the time of the sitting,
and (2) who are scarcely known, or not at ail known, to
PS Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
134
the sitter. A nd m any of these distant living persons had,
so far as they knew, never been near M rs. Piper. These
cases then compel us to assume a sélective capacity in
Mrs. Piper’s percipient personality, and not only sélective
as to the occurrences themselves, but discrim inative as to
the related persons ; that is to say, attaching the various
pièces of knowledge respectively to the fictitious personali-
ties whom, if real and living, the events in question would
hâve concerned. If now w e widen this supposed percip­
ient personality of M rs. Piper, and differentiate its parts
so as to cover ail the various successes o f the communica-
tors described in this report, w ith the verisimilitudes of the
different personalities of the ‘deceased’, and so as to cover
also ail the types of confusion and failure, and so as to
allow for the yet mcreasing num ber of new communica-
tors, w e reach a conception which goes as far as the
‘spirit’ hypothesis itself.”
D r. Hodgson sums up his position by saying :
“A t the présent tirne I cannot profess to hâve any doubt
but that the chief communicators to w hom I hâve referred
in the foregoing pages are veritably the personalities that
they daim to be, that they hâve survived the change w e
call death, and that they hâve directly com m unicated
with us whom w e call living through M rs. Piper’s en-
tranced organism.”
M rs. Sidgw ick in her long review and critical analysis of
the whole of the Piper phenomena is by no means favourable
to this conclusion. She entertains no doubt w hatever that
M rs. Piper’s trance utterances show a good deal o f para-
norm ally acquired knowledge, but takes the view that
neither Controls nor communicators werespirits independent
o f Mrs. Piper’s organism, but were dramatised phases o f her
MEDI UM S HI P 135
own consciousness. W hen ail the “rubbish” of trance révéla­
tion is brought together and examined, any critically minded
person must undoubtedly feel misgiving. W e find absurd
impersonations like that of Julius Cæsar, Moses (of the O ld
Testament), “ Imperator” , w ho poses as an exalted spirit and
talks w ith vagueness and immaturity. T h e other Controls
regard him as exalted; in other words, the existence of false
communicators or Controls is not admitted by any o f them.
O ne m ay be disposed therefore to say that their nature and
origin is the same. If w e are satisfied about the absurdity of
some of them, what reliable criterion hâve w e got for m aking
distinctions ? M rs. Sidgwick says :
ci
“O f course communication w ith the dead, when it
occurs, must im ply a real communicator in the back-
ground, but the point is that this does not necessitate
either the dram atic communicator or the control being
other than phases or éléments of M rs. Piper. N br does it
exclude the possibility that the dram atic com municator is
a fiction, or a dream, or an hallucination of the control,
each of w hich things it sometimes appears to be. T h a t it
is w ith phases or éléments— centres of consciousness— of
Mrs. Piper and not w ith entities independent of her that
the sitter is in direct communication, seems to m e . . . the
hypothesis which best fits the facts so far as we know
them.5
5
Mrs. Sidgwick draws an analogy w ith the hypnotic State
in which a person by suggestion can be m ade to impersonate
others. She considers that a level m Mrs. Piper w hich m ay
be called the “hypnotic self” impersonates the various
characters. M rs. Sidgw ick does not deny the possibility of
veridical communication w ith the “ dead” , but says :
“ If the whole dram atic form were play-acting it m ight
still be the framework in which veridical communications
PS Y C H I G A L RE S E A R C H
ï 36
corne to us. In fact, the question of w hat is the nature of
the communicator as dram atically presented to us is dis­
tinct from the question whether there is any real com ­
m unicator in the background. A real com m unicator— say,
G. P.— m ight be the source of inform ation displayed, and
even the model for its dram atic présentation, without
being either an actor in the dram a presented to us or in
any w ay responsible for it.”
It cannot be pretended that this is a satisfactory State in
which to leave the subject. T w o very competent observers are
not by any means in agreement. Forty years later w e are
still not in a position to présent w ith confidence more reliable
views. Professer W illiam James, w ho studied the Hodgson
control of M rs. Piper, believed that the process was more
complex than that involved in the terms “ control” and
“ communicator” . H e wrote :
“Extraneous e
wills-to-communicate’ m ay contribute to
the results, as w ell as a ‘will-to-personate’, and the two
kinds of will m ay be distinct in entity, though capable of
helping each other out. T h e will-to-com m unicate in our
présent instance would be, on a prim a facie view of it, the
will of Hodgson’s surviving spirit; and it can m ake frag-
m entary gleams and flashes o f w hat it wishes to say m ix
with the rubbish of the trance talk on this side. T he two
wills m ight thus strike up a sort of partnership and rein­
force each other. It m ight even be that the will-to-
personate would be com paratively inert unless it were
aroused to activity by the other w ill...
I hâve dealt at some length w ith Mrs. Piper’s mediumship
because it was studied over so m any years by persons of
outstanding ability. It will show the reader how com plex is
the structure and functioning of the hum an mind, and how
little w e yet know about it. It will show him how
M E D I U M S H I P *37
naïve are the assumptions of popular spiritualism— that
com munication with the “ dead” is quite easy and straight-
forward. Y et I think it w ill also suggest to him that the pos-
sibility of communication— occasionally o f a convincing
kind— is there.
M r s. Willett’s M ediumship
M rs. W illett’s mediumship is of quite a different kind, in
that she retains during the process a consciousness of self. In
1908, when M rs. W illett started to experiment, the phe-
nomenon was automatic script in which her hand appeared
to her to be controlled b y some external influence. This
influênce purported to be sometimes F. W . H . M yers and
sometimes Edm und Gurney, two of the distinguished
scholars who prior to their death had been closely linked
w ith the Society for Psychical Research. Early in 1909 M rs.
W illett developed a different technique, w hich m ight be
described as a clair-audient perception of the thoughts of the
communicators, These she either wrote down at the time
(naturally, not automatically) or spoke aloud for someone
else to Write down. M yers wrote, shortly after the inception
of this phase :
“ I am trying experiments with you to m ake you hear
without writing. . .. D o not analyse whence these impres­
sions (which I shall in future refer to as D aylight Impres­
sions) corne from ; they are parts of a psychic éducation
framed by me for you___”
Mrs. W illett herself wrote about her feelings thus :
“ I got no impression of appearance, only character, and
in some w ay voice or pronunciation (though this doesn’t
mean that m y ears hear, you know !). T h a t is always so in
D .I. (î.e. D aylight Impressions). I don’t feel a sense of
£
seemg’ but an intense sense of personality, like a blind
138 PS YGHI G AL R E S E A R C H
person perhaps m ight hâve— and of infiections, such as
amusement or émotion on the part o f the speaker. ï f you
asked m e how I know when E. G. is speaking and not
F. W . H . M . , 1 can’t exactly define, except that to m e it
would be impossible to be in doubt one instant— and with
E. G. I often know he is there a second or two before he
speaks. . . . I then sometimes speak first. . . . T o me, by
now, there isn’t anything strange in D .I.s except when I
try to explain anything about them ; then I réalisé sud-
denly they are unusual ! But otherwise it gives me no more
sense of oddness to be talking to these invisible people
than it does to be talking to m y son, for instance. But
I don’t think I m entally visualise any sort of C
appea?ance’
with regard to them— it is as ‘minds’ and ‘characters* that
they are to me, and yet not at ail intangible or not-solid
realities...
In the later phase of M rs. W illett’s mediumship where a
“sitter” was présent, some autom atic script m ight introduce
the topic and D.I.s, naturally spoken, would follow. There
was undoubtedly a State of trance o f varying depth, but the
phenomena were in notable contrast w ith M rs. PipeFs.
There were no “controls” or impersonations. M rs. W illett
was self-consciously in direct touch w ith the communicators,
and occasionally m ade her own comments on the messages
she was asked to transmit. T h e number o f persons w ho pur-
port to hâve com municated through her constitute the small
group M yers, Gurney, Sidgwick, Butcher, and Verrall, who
were ail closely linked in the Society for Psychical Research
when on earth. T w o others com municated, but their names
are not given. Furthermore, the sitters w ith M rs. W illett
hâve been very limited. T h ey included Sir O liver Lodge,
Lord Balfour, Mrs. Verrall, M rs. Sidgw ick, and a few others.
T h e general character of the communications— or at least
MEDI UM S HI P *39
of those w hich hâve been m ade public— were not directed
towards proofs of identity or the recall of personal memories
so m uch as to philosophical and psychological matters, to
the mechanism of com m unication and the problems of
mediumship. I transcribe a few examples (Proc, S ,P .R .} V ol.
X L I I I ,p . i6 o ):
E. G um ey : “Thereis an aw ful danger in your thinking,
a heap of you, that the leam ing stage is so m uch over now
that you can think you hâve precedents, can lay down
rules, and that sensitives can be standardised. Whereas, as
a m atter of fact, there are m any varieties, and you can’t
la-^down canons, you can’t bring them up to a standard.
Y ou still hâve m uch to learn, so hâve w e .. . . ”
F. W . H . M yers : “Say this T he Idéal is the Real. W hat
men call Visionary is the Bare Fact. W hat they call fact
is often evanescent vapour which w ill m elt into nothing-
ness before the light of Truth. I yearn ta say the bare
bones are the unreal, the M agic Vision H oly Grail is the
Actual. I am feeling after m uch that is yet obscure to me.
M y knowledge is fragm entary and as I progress I feel its
limits m o re.. .
Some of the passages dealing with psychological matters
convey very clearly the sense of another m ind trying tocom -
m unicate difficult ideas in which Mrs. W illett herself had
no interest. T h e following extract is Edm und G um ey
answering a question of G. W . Balfour : “A re the centres of
consciousness of the subliminal related to each other in a
manner analogous to the relation of the subliminal to the
supralim inal?”
“ W ait. Something about centres of cognition. H e says
tentacles o f the star-fish. Interaction, he says, is right. T h e
supraliminal and the subliminal ebb and fiow; and he
says that the profundities o f the subliminal which grade
P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
140
right up and merge into w hat Tve spoken of as the trans-
cendental self, the central unity, the self-conscious whole
achieving its self-consciousness by the hem m ing off. But,
he says, if you’re going to confuse any of this w ith the
whole question of secondary and tertiary personalities and
their respective memories of each other, you’d be m aking
a mistake. These are cases of dislocation, im perfect and
often pathological. O h, he says, It’s the creak of the
machine, that. But, he says, the subliminal— he says the
supraliminal— has access to— he says to m e : Y o u ’ve got
the analogies ail wrong, try again. Begin the other end, he
says. T h e transcendental self— he says something about a
point of release— Oh, Edmund, you do bore me so— the
passing of itself into stratas of sublim inality— he says it’s
like a continuous impetus, like waves of sound. Bang
(here hand cam e down on the table w ith a thump); and
then the subliminal rippling out into the supralim inal” ,
etc., etc.
T h e reader m ay begin to share something of the boredom
of Mrs. W illett if the extract is further prolonged. It illus­
trâtes, however, that w e are here dealing w ith matters of
interest to scholars and not to M rs. W illett; a n d it is difficult
not to believe that their origin is the one w hich it purports
to be.
Lord Balfour himself says w ith regard to this subject :
“ It w ould be impossible to do justice to the argument in
favour of spirit com munication on the basis of the W illett
phenom ena without violating confidences w hich I am
bound to respect.. . . If I had before me only those W illett
scripts to which I hâve been referring, I frankly adm it
that I should hâve been at a loss whether to attribute
them to subliminal activity or to a source entirely outside
the personality of the medium. « . . But having before me
MEDI UM S HI P I4I
the whole o f the W illett scripts, and being in a position to
com pare them with the scripts of other automatists of
our group and w ith facts known to me but not known to
M rs. W illett herself, I am personally of opinion that they
contain evidence of supernormally acquired knowledge
which no mere subliminal mentation w ill suffice to account
for.”
Som e O th er M édium s
If there were space to do so, the mediumship of M rs.
Osborne Leonard could be reviewed, as worthy to rank with
that of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. W illett. T he late Rev. C. D ray-
ton 'îhom as m ade a prolonged study of Mrs. Leonard’s
mediumship, as the resuit of which he became a convinced
spiritualist. H e has given the evidence in support of his views
in several books and papers in the Proc. S.P.R. I propose
here to mention only one aspect of his investigation of M rs.
Leonard’s mediumship— usually called proxy sittings. (See
Proc. S.P.R., V ol. X L I, p. 139; V ol. X L I II, p. 439.) From
w hat has been said already, it w ill be understood that the
exercise of ÿ-faculty (particularly telepathy) by the medium
is the only alternative to the view that discam ate minds are
in communication. In proxy sittings w ith a medium, the
person in the medium ’s presence attends on behalf of some-
one else, and conveys the evidence to them afterwards. This
procedure would appear to render m uch less plausible the
hypothesis that the medium is drawing the inform ation from
others’ minds. O n the other hand, one cannot affirm that
this is impossible, for the exercise of t^-faculty could pre-
sumably dérivé from the m ind of the sitter knowledge of the
person on whose behalf he has corne.
I shall briefly mention a few other examples of medium­
ship— not because of their intrinsic importance, but because
they indicate the strange variety of data to be explained. In
142 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
1923 Mrs. Travers-Sm ith and a M r. V . did autom atic
w riting in which M r. V . held the pencil but was “activated”
by M rs. Travers-Sm ith placm g her Angers lightly on his
hand (Psychic Messages from Oscar Wilde: R e ster
T r a v e r s-Sm ith . T . W . Laurie Ltd., 1924). There were
marked resemblances to O scar W ilde5s handwriting in the
first script received, and these becam e even more m arked in
subséquent scripts. M r. V . was not aw are of having ever
seen any of W ilde5s handwriting, and he did not see any
until the scripts were complété except a facsim ile reproduc­
tion of seven words w hich appeared in a review about the
middle of his script writing. M rs. Travers-Sm ith was also
ignorant of his handwriting when the first script came, but
looked u p some of it following the first script. (See Proc.
S.P.R., V ol. X X X I V , p. 186.) ïn contrast with this type of
control, it was remarked by Lord Balfour that Mrs. W illett’s
autom atic script was at the com mencement of a sitting
different from her normal handwriting, but that it bore no
resemblance to that of the “com m unicators55. As the trance
deepened the transition to a handwriting very similar to her
normal handwriting took place. Facts such as these are not
easy to explain. T o describe handw riting as a psycho-physical
habit-pattern tells us nothing, and any understanding must
aw ait the accum ulation of m uch more data. If the hypnotic
self can impersonate numerous characters, it would be in-
teresting to study its capacity for sustained imitation of
handwritings which the w aking self has seen for various
lengths of time.
Another extraordinaxy phenomenon of mediumistic
trance is xenoglossy, i.e. the intelligent use of a foreign
tongue w ith which the medium has no w aking fam iliarity. In
his book, Psychic Adventures in New York, Dr. N eville
W hym ant, an authority on O riental languages, has given an
account of numerous séances w ith the m edium George
ME DI UM S HI P *43
Valiantine, a relatively uneducated man. In twelve séances
he had heard fourteen foreign languages used, including
Chinese, Hindi, Persian, Basque, Sanskrit, Arabie, Portu-
guese, Italian, Yiddish, German, and m odem Greek. O n
one o f these occasions the Chinese spoken was not a living
language but the archaic style of the Gonfucian period. A n
ode, of w hich D r. W hym ant says he could remember only
one line and of which the m eaning had never been under»
stood by Chinese scholars, was declaimed in such a manner
that new light was thrown upon it. This is certainly a very
subtle and impressive feature if we can accept the data as
factual. Speech, in the sense of pronunciation, is perhaps
anothhr psycho-physical habit-pattern, but understanding is
wholly psychical. If understanding of an ode was not présent
in Dr. W hym ant5
s subconscious mind, whence came the new
light upon îts m eaning?
Readers w ho are intrigued by this type of data will also
find the book A n cîen t E g y p t Speaks by H ulm e and W ood a
source of similar data. H ere “N ona” , the control of a m edium
called Rosemary, has apparently provided information o f the
pronunciation of Egyptian vowels (hitherto unknown) as
spoken in E gypt over 3,000 years ago. Indeed, D r. W ood
says : “Nona’s Egyptian is as fluent and easy as m y corn-
mand of English. M oreover it is consistent.”
There is one other extraordinary example of mediumship
w hich provides similar problems, and which has been
studied by several competent scholars. I refer to T h e C ase of
Patience W orth, by Dr. W . F. Prince, and P atience W orth
— a P sychic M ystery, by G. S. Yost. Professor Schiller of
O xford has also written about it {Proc. S .P .R ., V ol.
X X X V I). T h e medium was M rs. J. H . Curran of St. Louis,
U .S.A ., who in trance was controlled by “ Patience W orth” .
She claimed to be a girl w ho had lived in Dorsetshire in the
seventeenth century, had later emigrated to Am erica, and
14 4 PS Y CHXGAL R E S E A R C H
had been killed by Indians. Am ong several works considered
by experts to hâve considérable literary m erit is a poem,
Telka3of about 70,000 words, in blank verse. It was dictated
with great rapidity in the Anglo-Saxon dialect of three
centuries ago. Analysis of the language shows its vocabulary
to be 90 per cent, of Anglo-Saxon origin and that it contains
no word of later entry into the language than 1600 (except
“amuck” , w hich is early seventeenth century). Professor
Schiller comments :
“ W hen w e are told further that the Authorised Version
has only 77 per cent, of Anglo-Saxon, and that it is neces-
sary to go back to Layam on (11205) to equal Patience
W orth’s percentage, we réalisé that w e are face to face
with a philological m iracle.”
These are some of the strange, if rare, phenomena of
mediumship. If they are not the activity of discam ate minds,
it is difficult to find any satisfactory hypothesis short of some
universal psychic record or collective m em ory from w hich
wonders of ail kinds can be drawn by the m ind of a medium
suitably related to it. W hen w e are driven to a postulate of
this comprehensiveness it w ould seem m ore reasonable to
consider the claim m ade by the control. T h is does not im ply
that w e need accept daim s m ade b y ail m edium istic Con­
trols I I should personally accept the claim of G. P. (in M rs.
Piper’s trance); I am uncertain about one or tw o; and I
reject the daim s of most of the others. In particular, I en-
dorse the views of Professor W illiam James. In this strange
and varied field where a blend of both restraint and boldness
is required in the theorist, w e m ay m ake m any mistakes if
w e adopt the attitude of either/or in our thinking. O ur
knowledge of the vagaries and depths o f the hum an per-
sonality is as yet pathetically small. W e must collect more
and m ore data, study them w ith vigilance, and recognise
MEDI UM SHI P 145
that we are dealing with a subject w hich in millenniums to
come will still be a m atter for m an’s most earnest enquiry.

T R I G T L Y speaking, the issue of the survival b y human
personality of the change w hich w e call death is not one
w ith w hich psychical research is principally concem ed. It is,
however, for most people one of profound interest at some
stage o f their life, and the data of psychical research hâve
very great relevance to the issue. It is therefore appropriate
to consider it here.
T he M eaning o f Su r v iv a l
If I m ake the statement “ I expect to survive the death of
m y body” , it will be obvious that I hâve already form ed a
conception of m yself as distinct from m y body. M y body,
after ail, is a physical object am ong m yriads of others in our
fam iliar physical world It is certainly a very com plicated
one, but the chemist would assure m e that it could ulti-
m ately be broken down m to molécules and atoms and other
smaller parlicles, and the philosopher w ould assure m e that
it is an assemblage of sense-data like other physical objects,
and that even its appearance at ail is dépendent on a per-
ceiving mind. M aterialism in the old sense— that m atter is
the one fundam ental thing, that when it reaches a certain
Chemical com plexity it m iraculously produces life and m ind
w hich are essentially dépendent phenom ena— such m atérial­
isai is com pletely moribund. I hâve expressed elsewhere (The
Imprîsoned Splendour. H odder & Stoughton, 1953) m y
conviction that the self is a hierarchy; that m ind and body
are two different instruments of the self for contacting
different orders of reality, and that of these two, m ind is the
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L I47
more fundam ental and significant. W hen I refer to m y sur-
vival of death, I mean m erely that I shall some day discard
as no longer serviceable this outermost vehicle or instru­
ment. Another vehicle or instrument of myself, w hich I at
présent possess but do not consciously use, then becomes m y
outer or objective expression on a level of reality to w hich
it inherently belongs. Glimpses of its existence are found in
accounts of out-of-the-body expériences.
In this chapter we shall concem ourselves w ith the
evidence that mind, and that w hich uses mind, continues to
function after the body is discarded.
W h a t w o u l d c o n s tit u t e E r o o f ?
It would be an appropriate exercise for those of us who
are interested in this subject to write down on paper a list of
those criteria which, if fulfilled, would be regarded as proof
of the survival o f a personal friend. It is only when we hâve
formulated this that it is possible to consider how far evi­
dence has been obtained, or could be obtained, to satisfy
ail these criteria. Suppose w e are told that a friend of ours
is on the far side of an im pénétrable opaque screen which,
although it distorts the voice, still permits of conversation.
Could we satisfy ourselves of the truth of the statement?
M y answer would be “yes” . (i) I should dépend upon shared
memories w hich I believed were unknown to any other per-
sons. (2) I should bring along other persons w ho also knew
m y friend, and see if he could sustain w ith them a conversa­
tion typical of their past relationship and shared interests.
(3) I should recognise certain mannerisms and characteristics
— not m erely psycho-physical things like pitch of voice,
accent, or inflexion of speech— but eagerness or slowness,
cheerfulness or gloominess, w it or solemnity, the type o f his
interests, the quality of his mind, the inter-mingling of
emotional tones, and most important, the qualities of
I48 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
character w hich express his m oral sense and insight and the
sensitivity of his perceptions. There are a hundred such
factors which normally we do not sit down and analyse, but
w hich in their total effect can be convincing proof of îden-
tity to oneself. It m ight well be, however, that our own con­
viction would fail to împress others.
T h e situation in regard to survival of death is not quite
so simple, because the m edium through whom com m unica­
tion is possible is not m erely an impersonal screen, but is
liable to add to, subtract from, and otherwise colour the
alleged communications. Nevertheless, although w ith
greater difficulty, personal conviction can be obtained, and
has in fact been obtained by critical and responsible persons.
Although others5conviction must undoubtedly carry weight
with the seeker after truth, the question still remains : “ Is
there any objective proof of survival possible, apart from the
personal satisfaction w hich m ay arise through expérience
such as w e hâve outlined?5
5
A n y objective evidence has necessarily to be confronted
w ith w hat w e know of the para-norm al powers of the m ind
by w ay of gathering knowledge. This is where the difficulty
arises. K now ledge alone, however rem arkable, surprising,
and intimate, is not theoretically beyond the power of in-
gathering by ^-faculty exercised by a good medium. O n the
other hand, let us remember that the hum an personality is
not m erely a réservoir of memories, but can exercise and
demonstrate faculties of will, purpose, and planning. W here
an unknown personality breaks through into a séance to
convey evidence of identity of itself w hich can subsequently
be verified by devious means, this is certainly interesting;
where, in addition, it shows evidence of independent purpose
and intention quite outside the range of interests and pur-
poses of the m edium and sitters, this is an im portant feature
w hich has to be explained. This sort of activity, showing
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L I49
purpose and intention— whether it be in small matters, as of
a deceased soldier who wants a keepsake given ta his fiancée
w ho is not known by others ta exist— or whether it be an
erudite classical essay, fragments of which are conveyed
through several different médiums— this sort of activity can
be excellent evidence of an independent mind at work. I f it
is not the discarnate mind which it purports to be, then
whosem ind is it?
W e shall find, if we are determined ta be sceptical about
survival, that every case w hich can be cited is capable of an
explanation along the fines of the use of the m ind’s para­
normal powers by a living person— provided w e extend them
w idel'f enough. In some instances it would seem to m e that
the hypothesis of communication by a surviving discarnate
personafity is much the more probable explanation, but this
is where judgments will differ and each person must form
his own.
E v id e n c e o f Id e n t ity
It is perhaps appropriate to cite one or two examples
which will illustrate the statements we hâve made. In cases
given below, the knowledge presented by the medium was
not drawn from the sitter’s mind. W here the possibifity of
this exists, w e cannot consider the case as contnbuting to
proof of survival in view of our knowledge of ^-faculty.
Case of Ruth Robertshaw (from Psychical Investigations,
p. 172 : J. A rthur H il l . Cassell, 1917) :
J. A. H ill had numerous sittings with a non-professional
medium called Wilkinson, for whose honesty he vouches. In
a sitting on November 9th, 1916, the following conversation
took place :
Medium: D id you know someody called R uth Robert-
shaw? R .U .T .H .
150 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
J. A. H.: I don’t remember anybody at the moment.
Medium: About sixty-three or sixty-four. She has known
somebody who has been here. “ R uth Robertshaw5
5 is
not a common combination. I saw her perfectly. A
crescent-shaped light was over her head and her face
was illumined. She would be inclined to be rather pious
in her w ay.
J. A. H Q uite meaningless to me. N ever heard of any
R uth Robertshaw.
Medium: This woman R uth is no relation to you, I think.
. . . There was a gentleman belonging to her called
Jacob. I think he would be her husband. W hoever he
was, he was older than her. H e w ould be seventy-three.
She would be about ten years younger; it m ay be m the
time between them passmg aw ay— I’m not sure. I don’t
see him ; I only hear it.
M r. H ill says ail this m eant nothing to him, but that it
occurred to him to w rite to a friend, M iss North, w ho had
been a visitor to the house three days before, and ask if it
m eant anything to her. She replied :
“Y ou m ake me feel creepy. R uth Robertshaw was m y
father’s cousin— one of the sweetest wom en that ever lived.
She was a beautiful old lady when I knew her, and good.
Jacob was her husband. T h e âges given are just about
right.”
M r. H ill says that correct statements were also m ade from
the Robertshaws about a fam ily known to them but un-
known to him. M r. H ill was confident that the m edium did
not know of Miss North5s existence. T h e num ber of her
visits to see M r. H ill were estimated at about three per year.
This is rather interesting as a case. T h e alternative ex-
planation to the spiritistic one is that at a subconscious level
T H E P R O B L E M O F S UR V I V A L I5I
the mincis of M r. H ill and Miss North were in some measure
of relationship, and when M r. Wilkinson achieved rapport
w ith M r. H ill he ipso facta could use ^-faculty to draw
knowledge from her mmd. It is not, however, as though M r.
H ill had a proxy-sitting w ith M r. Wilkinson on behalf of
Miss North. T h e initiative appears to hâve been with the
discarnate Mrs. Robertshaw.
Case of F. and Madame Elise {Proc. S.P.R., V ol. X III,
p. 378) :
Dr. Richard Hodgson records this case without, however,
as m uch detail as one would wish. H e was going one m om -
ing tosa sitting w ith Mrs. Piper, and observed in the Boston
m orning paper a notice of the death of F., w ho was a near
relative of M adam e Elise. This lady had been a friend of
Dr. Hodgson when alive, and had communicated w ith him
through M rs. Piper on several occasions m a convmcing
manner. O n this occasion, without any anticipation of it,
Dr. Hodgson says that the ftrst writing that came through
was from M adam e E., w ho said that F. was there w ith her
but unable to communicate yet. She described how she had
been présent at the death-bed of F. and repeated w hat she
had “said3
3 to him — which Hodgson describes as “an un-
usual form of expression3
3
. She said he had heard and recog-
nised her. Hodgson gave to an intimate friend (who was
also a friend of the closest surviving relative of F.) an account
of this sitting, and this relative a day or two later spon-
taneously told their m utual friend that F., when dying, had
said that M adam e E. was speaking to him and repeated
w hat she said. T h e expression so repeated was identical w ith
that told to Hodgson by M adam e Elise.
This is an interesting grouping of facts, most simply ex-
plained on the basis above described. Indeed, ^-faculty
would hâve to be stretched to an extraordinary extent to try
to account plausibly for these facts.
152 P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
A different type of evidence w hich was specifically
designed to establish identity was undertaken by a group of
Am erican investigators. T h ey used a simple technique based
upon the para-normal P .K . effect of a tilting table. The
alphabet was recited and the tilting table cam e to rest at a
certain letter which was recorded. This was a slow method
of communication in w hich each letter o f every word had to
be received. In the course of 18 sittings 41 communicators
“ came through” , and provided inform ation about them-
selves w hich members of the group took steps to verify. A n
example of this is given below :
“ T h e name ‘Slane . . . Frédéric’ was given on
February i5th, 1932. T h e com m unicator stated that he
was a doctor, lived at W aterford, O ntario, C anada; that
he left Dorothea, and two children, a boy Fred, and a girl
Frances. Search was m ade in the Central Library, N ew
York, and a newspaper notice was found— ‘Slane, Frédéric
H ., M .D ., February ist, at W aterford, Ontario, C anada :
husband of D orothea T . Selby. Funeral and interment at
W aterford, Ontario, C anada.’ ”
O ut of 156 statements m ade about these cases, 105 were
checked up and found correct. O f the rem aining 51, lack of
sufEcient inform ation prevented 35 being checked. T h e
cum ulative effect of this type of investigation is impressive.
Clairvoyance, and a faculty of telepathy w hich can sweep
like a searchlight into the odd corners o f libraries and gather
inform ation which is almost always right, is certainly a pos­
sible hypothesis. But is it com parable in its plausibility with
the ostensible one w hich présumés the survival of per-
sonality? I f ^-faculty of this quality is available through a
table and an ordinary group of investigators— none o f whom
were aw are of exercising such rem arkable extra-sensory
powers— w e can only say that every reputable library ought
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L I53
to hâve its “ tilting table” as w ell as its catalogue. E very
foreign office and intelligence department, every police
headquarters and every defence department, should hâve its
séance room. W hy worry about security if the most recon-
dite facts and secret processes are open to this type of
“ clairvoyant” acquisition? W e cannot help but think that
there is a disposition on the part of some commentators to
extend the range of ÿr-faculty and the measure of its pré­
cision far beyond the point where experiment shows it to be,
in an effort to avoid the hypothesis of survival.
E v id e n c e o f Pu r po se
I sfiall select two examples only out of the hundreds of
recorded cases in which planning or purpose of some m ind
other than that of the medium or sitters is indicated.
The Pearl Tie-pin Case (see Voices front the Void: H e l e n
T r a v e r s -Sm it h . Rider & Co.) :
M rs. Travers-Sm ith was the medium, w ho used a ouija
board as a means of communication. Miss G., who was w ith
her, had heard of the death of a cousin w ho was an officer
in the British A rm y in France about a month prior to this
sitting. T h e board first spelled out the name of M iss G.’s
cousin, and then in reply to the question “D o y o u know who
I am ?” gaveher own name. T h e following message was then
transmitted : “ Tell mother to give m y pearl tie-pin to the
girl I intended to m arry. I think she should hâve it.” T h e
full name of this lady was then given, and the surname is
described as very uncommon and not the name of anyone
known either to the medium or Miss G. A London address
was given, but as a letter addressed there was returned, it
was thought that either a mistake had occurred or that the
whole thing was fictitious, and no further steps were taken.
About six months later, however, the W ar Office forwarded
p .r .— 6
154 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
the officer’s effects ta his fam ily in Ireland, and am ong these
was discovered a pearl tie-pin. In his w ill was given the
lady’s nam e in full (as had been mentioned at the sitting).
N either his own fam ily nor Miss C. had even heard of this
lady’s name, still less knew of his engagem ent to her shortly
before he went out to France. Sir W illiam Barrett received
a written assurance from M rs. Travers-Sm ith and M iss G.
that the message received was written down at the time of
the sitting and not afterwards.
The Chaffin Will Case:
This is a m uch-quoted case (Proc. S.P.R., V ol. X X X V I ,
p. 517), and is given below in a very condensed form^As a
lawsuit was involved, the facts were subject to careful
scrutiny and testing.
A farmer, James L. Chaffin, who lived in N orth Carolina,
m ade a w ill on Novem ber i6th, 1905, in w hich he gave the
farm to his third son M arshall, leaving his w idow and other
three sons unprovided for. O n January i6th, 1919, he
apparently repented of this and m ade a second will, which
was unwitnessed, but w hich would, according to the State
law, hâve been valid provided there was proof that it was in
the testator’s own handwriting. T h e new w ill read as
follows :
“A fter reading the 27Ü1 C hapter of Genesis, I, James L .
Chaffin, do m ake m y last w ill and testament and here it is.
I want, after giving m y body a decent burial, m y little
property to be equally divided between m y four children,
if they are living at m y death, both personal and real
estate divided equal if not living, give share to their
ch ild ren . . . etc.”
H e placed this second w ill between tw o pages of an old
fam ily Bible w hich had belonged to his father, folding the
pages over so as to m ark the place. N o one knew of the
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L 155
existence of the second will, and the eccentric farm er took
no steps to indicate its existence except that of stitching up
the inner pocket of his overcoat w ith a roll of paper inside it
bearing the words : “Read the 27Ü1 Chapter of Genesis in m y
daddie’s old Bible.” This posthumous treasure-hunt did not
apparently eventuate after the old farmer’s sudden death on
September 27th, 1921. T h e third son M arshall obtained pro-
bâte of the only known w ill— the first one— on September
24th of that year. In June 1925 the second son James started
to hâve vivid dreams of his father. In one o f these he
aPPeare<3 to stand at his son’s bedside wearing his black over-
coa,t and to say to him : “Y ou w ill find m y w ill in m y over­
coat Rocket.” Being convinced by this, James visited his
brother John, who Hved twenty miles aw ay and had taken
possession of the coat. O n discovering the roll of paper with
its message, James went w ith his daughter and two other
witnesses to his mother’s home. T h ey found the old Bible
after considérable search and the second w ill at the place
indicatéd. In Decem ber 1925 a lawsuit took place, and the
second will was adm itted to probate.
Com m enting on this : the period o f three-and-three-
quarter years w hich elapsed between the farmer’s death and
the son3
s dreams makes most unlikely any explanation w hich
assumes that the initiative was w ith the son James. I f his
subconscious mind, without any stimulus from the conscious
mind, exercised ÿ-faculty and found w hat his father had
donc (the dream-figure of the father being m erely a con-
structed vehicle to convey the information), w hy did it w ait
nearly four years? T h e same pertinent question applies to
any suggestion that the old farmer’s intention leaked tele-
pathically into his son’s m ind but remained there latent for
this period. In m y judgm ent the circumstances point to
initiative by the surviving discarnate mind o f the f armer.
156 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
C r o ss-correspondence
T h e evidence w hich is referred to as cross-correspondence
is at once the most involved and perhaps the most w eighty
testixnony to the existence of a discarnate mind, planning
and carrying out over a period of years an experiment to
demonstrate his survival. In the course of it he evinced a
wealth of classical knowledge w hich makes the conclusion
almost inévitable that F. W . H . M yers was in fact the
author and expérimenter— as he claim ed to be. M yers died
in 1901, and a few years later he purported to intim ate in
autom atic script that he w ith his friends was initiating a
new experiment. As an experienced worker in this fiêld, he
was fully aware of the nature of alternative hypothèses to
survival, and the cross-correspondence scripts were an
attem pt to eliminate the plausibility of these. T h e idea
briefly expressed is this. Suppose there w ere three médiums
capable of writing autom atic script. A n essay m ight be com-
posed b y an independent (discarnate) m ind and communi-
cated through these three persons. If the same essay were
com m unicated in its entirety through each of them working
separately, this fact being unknown to them, there would
certainly be a strong presumption of planning b y an inde­
pendent mind. T h e critic m ight suggest, however, that the
essay arose in the m ind o f one of the automatists and was
com municated telepathically to the minds of the others. If,
however, certain fragm ents of the essay were com municated
through one w riter A , the other fragm ents through another
writer C , while the key to relate these properly was com­
m unicated to B, w e could no longer seriously consider the
critic’s hypothesis. T h e writings of A , B, and G could be
forwarded b y these persons to a com m on centre— say the
Society for Psychical Research— and then careful study and
synthesis would m ake a cohérent essay. E ach autom atist
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L I57
would receive strings of words and phrases and allusions,
m aking no sense until they were properly related to the
others. In his study of this subject, H. F. Saltmarsh has used
the appropriate analogy o f a jig-saw puzzle. One m ight
im agine the jig-saw puzzle divided into three and given to
three different people, so that until ail three brought their
fragments together the picture and design would not be
apparent.
This is the “ cross-correspondence” research which began
three or four years after M yers died and continued for over
a dozen years. It was m ade possible by the faculty of auto-
m atic writing possessed by M rs. Verrall of Cambridge, M rs.
H ollatid (who lived for some time in India), M rs. W illett,
and to a subsidiary extent Mrs. Forbes, Miss H . V errall, the
“M acs” , and Mrs. Piper. T h e scholars who examined the
scripts and to whose labours w e owe the possibility of form-
ing a judgm ent upon them were M r. J. G. Piddington, the
Earl of Balfour (G. W.), Sir O liver Lodge, Mrs. Sidgwick,
Miss A lice Johnson, and Mrs. Verrall. M ost of these were
themselves acquainted with classical scholarship— an im ­
portant qualification in the unravelling of some of the in-
genious puzzles presented by the automatists.
I shall not add to the length of this chapter with
illustrations, but the real w eight of evidence can be appre-
ciated only if some of the original papers in the Proc.
S.P.R., or a book such as that of H . F. Saltmarsh, is carefully
studied.
There is only one hypothesis which m ight be considered
at ail as an alternative to the view that the surviving minds
of M yers, Sidgwick, and others were responsible for the
scripts. Mrs. V errall was herself a classical scholar, and it
has been suggested that some of these involved essays (with
m any classical allusions) originated in her subconscious mind,
and that selected fragments “ leaked” telepathically to the
158 P S Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
other automatists and were there “ thrown up” into script.
A part from the fact that cross-correspondence did not cease
in 1916 with the death of M rs. Verrai!, such a hypothesis
attributes to the subconscious m ind o f M rs. V errall a
capacity for scholarship, planning, and transmission of
meaningless fragments which I think w e hâve no justifica­
tion for doing on any considered grounds. It is a suggestion
as im probable as that the subconscious m ind of M rs. Curran
was responsible for the philological m iracle of “ Patience
W orth” (see p. 143).
Su m m in g -u p
This can be done briefly, for I hâve sufficiently indîcated
the alternative explanations o f psychical facts to allow the
reader to form a judgm ent for himself. It is almost ironical
that the labours of psychical research hâve enlarged our
knowledge of the m ind’s powers, and b y im plication m ade
the essential dependence o f m ind on m atter seem less and
less plausible. A t the same tim e the very existence of these
powers in us makes rigorous proof of the survival of dis-
carnate minds difficult. T o put it otherwise— whereas it was
once supposed that such rem arkable powers (of ^-faculty)
must establish the existence of a kind of superior discarnate
State of being, w e now rather ask ourselves by w hat sort of
test can w e hope to distinguish between ^-faculty exercised
by the discarnate and the incarnate? I am not sure that any
such test can be invented, and, if so, rigorous proof of sur-
vival m ay not be possible. I do not think that for practical
purposes this should cause us any concem . I should find it
difficult to give convincing proof of m y identity to a friend
of m ine in another country— if he was determined to be
sceptical— to demonstrate that I was in fact the person he
had known through his senses some years previously. D r.
R . H . Thouîess has suggested (Proc. S.P.R., V ol. X L V I I I ,
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L I59
p. 342, 1948-9) that an encoded message w ith the type of
cipher used should be published. D r. Thouless has done this,
and he hopes, if he finds himself surviving death, to com-
m unicate the keyword or words w hich w ill enable this
message to be decoded. It is désirable of course that médiums
should do w hat they can while Dr. Thouless is living to
obtain these keywords. I personally believe that an auto-
m atic script writer known to me could obtain these keywords
— but if so, how would she claim to do it? She would ask her
“control” to recover these words from the mind of D r.
Thouless, and the “control” in tum m ight say : C
T w ill call
F. W . H . M yers (for example), w ho w ill be able to do this
bette# than I can.” Suppose F. W . H . M . purported to com-
m unicate the keywords (which were correct), w ould this
establish anything? There would still be sceptics w ho would
say : “ Good thought-reading by the medium— and of course
the alleged F. W . H . M . is a vehicle created to convey the
inform ation in a dram atic fo rm ”
M y own considered view is this : that responsible indi-
viduals with caution and persistence can, and hâve, satisfied
themselves of the survival b y intimate friends of the death
of the body. I confess that this is m y own conviction in rela­
tion to an intimate friend of mine who died some ten years
ago. I consider, however, that this kind of conviction is Per­
sonal and cannot be handed on to others. W hen, however,
w e look at the issue of survival objectively, the cum ulative
evidence strongly supports the survival hypothesis as b y far
the most plausible. W ords read to the Society for Psychical
Research on behalf of Mrs. Sidgwick when she was elected
President of Honour at the âge of 87 are an appropriate
summing up. Lord Balfour said :
“M a y I be allowed before w e separate to add one or
two sentences of m y ow n? . . . Conclusive proof of sur-
yival is notoriously difficult to obtain. But the evidence
l6o PS Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
m ay be such as to produce belief, even though it falls
short of conclusive proof. I hâve M rs. Sidgw ick’s assur­
ance— an assurance which I am perm itted to convey to
the meeting— that upon the evidence before her, she
herself is a firm believer both in survival and in the reality
of communication between the living and the dead.”
T he C onception of A nother W orld
Perhaps one of the m ain reasons w h y thoughtful people
view with suspicion, or as a superstition, any talk of “ another
world’5 in w hich w e m ay find ourselves after death, is the
vagueness of current concepts about it. Som e of the com-
ments often proffered in this connection are these :
(1) Where is this other w orld? Y ou don’t expect m e to
believe it is somewhere in the stratosphère in this scientific
âge?
(2) W hen we read spiritualists5 accounts of trees and
houses and countryside and fam iliar things, is it not obvious
that this is a projected wish-fulfilment : an idealised version
of the world w e know?
(3) H ow trivial and banal are most o f the supposed com­
munications from the “other side5
5 ! C an you tell us of any
substantial contribution to thought w hich has corne
through? O ne m ight hâve supposed that, assuming com­
m unication is possible, there would be enough of wonder
and significance to unfold to us ; but w e either hear of trifles
and commonplaces or listen to the conventional “ uplift” talk
which is the output of thousands of pulpits.
T h e first of these questions is a very reasonable one, and
in an extremely interesting lecture (Proc. S.P.R., V ol. L,
P* I953) Professor H . H . Price has dealt both w ith this
and related matters. It is there shown that granted the next
world is one of mental images, there w ill resuit b y no means
an unsubstantial or “ unreal” world as some m ight suppose.
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L l 6l
I am personally impressed with the close correspondence
between the conception developed logically by Professor
Price and the statements of the best communicators as to
the nature of their world, as far as they hâve experienced
it. Professor Price points ont that in a dream one lives in a
world of images which hâve shape and extension and spatial
relations to each other. These spatial features hâve, however,
no relationship to the space of which w e become aware on
waking. H e says :
“ It follows that when w e speak of ‘passing’ from this
world to the next, this passage is not to be thought of as
an^sort of movement in space. Itshould rather be thought
of as a change of consciousness, analogous to the change
which occurs when w e pass from the waking expérience to
dreaming. It would be a change from the perceptual type
of consciousness to another type of consciousness in w hich
perception ceases and im aging replaces it. . .
If, as I believe, the so-called material world is a création
of M ind (with the ætheric world an intermediate créative
stage), then it is on the level o f M ind that the prototype of
the m aterial level exists. W hen a m an no longer retains
awareness of the material level, whether in sleep b y a tem-
porary inward withdrawal of consciousness, or whether by
discarding his body at death, consciousness is refocused on
an interior level, i.e. one w hich is a step nearer to the ulti-
m ately real. This new world-level then acquires objectivity
for him.
T h e second question has been largely answered by what
w e hâve said. Speaking of the argument that the “material-
istic” character of the communications is evidence against
them (loc. cit.9p. 19) :
“ M ost people in this life do like m aterial objects and
are deeply interested in them. This m ay be déplorable, but
P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H
1Ô2
there it is. If so, the im age world they w ould create for
themselves in the next life m ight be expected to hâve
just the hnaterialistic5 character of w hich these critics
complain. If one had been fond of nice houses and pleasant
gardens in this life, the im age-world one w ould create
for oneself in the next m ight be expected to contain
image-replicas o f such objects, and one w ould m ake these
replicas as hke ‘the real thmg* as one’s memories per-
m itted; with the help perhaps of télépathie influences
from other minds whose tastes were similar.”
Professor Price cogently pointed out that the issue of sur-
vival of death and of life in another world has nothing^to do
with our wishes; it is one o f evidence. But granted the fact,
then the nature of this world is likely to be very m uch in-
fluenced by our wishes. H e says :
“ There must surely be m any next worlds . . . corre-
sponding to the different desires w hich different groups
of personalities hâve.5
5
O n the third question raised, I think there is a widespread
but groundless presumption that ordinary mortals, once they
throw off the limitations of the body, ipso facto should ren
veal surprisingly adm irable and angelic properties. Pre-
sumably the environment effects this m agical change! O n
the contrary, it is far m ore reasonable that hum an nature
should rem ain essentially unchanged, w ith the m ental and
emotional content just as before. N inety-five per c e n t of
hum an communications on our présent level of existence are
trifling and commonplace, and it should not be surprising
that the same is true of m ediumistic communication. O n the
other hand, it is not true that ail communications are
trifling. T h e W illett scripts dealt w ith the m echanism o f
com m unication and w ith m etaphysical questions. T w o books
T H E P R O B L E M O F S U R V I V A L 163
of autom atic script written by Miss Cummins and inspired
by F. W . H . M yers deal with profound questions. Always, of
course, there is the problem of language, with its inade-
quacy to convey concepts which no expérience o f ours can
fill w ith significant content.
I think I m ight conclude the chapter w ith some words
com municated by M yers through Mrs. Holland {Proc.
S.P.R., V o l X X I, p. 230):
‘‘T h e nearest simile I can find to express the difficulties
of sending a message is that I appear to be standing be-
hind a sheet of frosted glass which blurs sight and deadens
sounds— dictating feebly to a reluctant and somewhat
obtuse secretary.”
But M yers also communicated through the same m edium
as follows :
“ If it were possible for the soûl to die back into earth
again I should die from sheer yeam ing to reach you, to
tell you that ail w e imagined is not half wonderful
enough for the truth.”

O D E R N physics présents to the thoughtful person a
spectacle of great interest. Those w ho hâve watched
the probe of enquiry going deeper into atom ic structure hâve
seen a succession of “particles” corne to light : électron,
proton, neutron, meson— and hâve wondered if the jfrocess
w ill stop. T h e term “ particle” w hich at one time seemed
to require no further définition then becam e ambiguous, and
wave-groups took their place— but only sometimes. Faced
w ith a fondam ental dilem m a of thiskind, a new attitude was
adopted. In thinking in terms of particles and waves, we
w ere transferring our ideas o f models and mechanics from
the large-scale world, where their usefulness is unchallenged,
to the microcosm where they apparently do not work con-
sistently. W hen w e ponder on this, let us ask ourselves
whether w e hâve any justification for talking about w hat an
électron or proton looks like. W e hâve no sense datum to
correspond. T h e term is only a Symbol, after ail— and to try
to visualise a m odel of it is a m ental process m aking a con­
cession to the prim ary im portance for us of the visual type
of sense-data. M odels were therefore abandoned by ad-
vanced thinkers in physics, and a System of m athem atical
relations between unknown entities was considered to be ail
that was necessary. Does it not look as if both the relations
and the entities are aspects of a m ental field sustained b y a
cosmic m ind with w hich our own finit© minds, as w e try to
unravel these mysteries, are in rapport?
I M P O R T A N C E O F P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H 165
Again, consider the strange interchangeability of m atter
and radiation energy. W e know to our cost today that what
w e call “m atter” can disappear and “ energy” can take its
place. These two terms both describe m ental concepts; in
any proper sense they are unknowns. The substantiality of
the world is far from being what our common sense sug-
gests. It is another of those attributes which w e hâve created
to describe our sense-data.
T h e more w e reflect upon the nature of the world w hich
science investigates, the less justification there seems to be
for the attitude of materialism which ftourished so confî-
dently during the last century. It is a quite unfounded
assumption that N ature works within limits which she has
already disclosed to us and which our senses hâve con-
veniently registered. O n the contrary, the world which our
minds recognise is only one significant world-Ievel of m any
potential world-levels, and some o f these, w e daim , are dis­
closed in the data of psychical research. T h e minimum
postulate w hich will help to account for these data is that
of an ætheric world-level sustaining energies and forces
whose very existence is as yet little recognised.
It m ay well be that w hat has been called ^-faculty is the
normal and characteristic faculty o f m ind when not geared
closely to a physical body. Thephysical brain m ay normally
be an organ of limitation. It canalises the sensory aspects of
^-faculty through the spécial senses, and it canalises the
motor aspects of ^-faculty through the cérébro-spinal ner-
vous System and the muscles. There is a fringe or slight
residue of unchannelled ^r-faculty, w hich can be detected
statistically by the experimental methods of psychical re­
search. T h e marked and dramatic phenomena become évi­
dent, however, only when the mind and brain are uncoupled
to a substantial extent, as in trance. Then w e m ay hâve the
surprising acquisition of knowledge which w e label clair-
l 66 PS Y G H I G A L R E S E A R C H
voyant or clair-audient, and the surprising movements and
créations of objects such as hâve occurred, for example, in
the presence of Stainton Moses and of other physical
médiums. T h e brain has thus been described as an organ of
attention to everyday life. If we ask ourselves w hat is gained
by this attention to life and w hat end it subserves, we
plunge into the deep waters of m etaphysical spéculation. I
shall do no more here than suggest that this process of lim ita­
tion serves the end o f differentiating and establishing our
finite minds from the m atrix of the collective or racial (un-
conscious) mind. It is a process of individualisation o f mind,
in which, from a new centre, the nature of existence can be
examined and enjoyed by an all-pervasive consciousness.
O f the laws of the ætheric world-level w e can scarcely as
y et daim to hâve any inkling. W e are still in the process of
collecting reliable data, and speculating as to how these
varied observations m ay perhaps be related to each other.
Gonsider for a mom ent M ind in its Creative aspect. If I
w ant to m ake a table I hâve to use an im aginative faculty
to form ulate the design. I then hâve to usem y m ind to direct
and control m y muscles, w hich, w ith the aid o f tools and
raw m aterial, can shape and construct the table. There
appears, however, to be possible another mode of construc­
tion, in w hich the m ind can utilise directly the psychic
æther— as in matérialisation phenom ena. H ere the use of
the muscles is not involved, but the end-product, w hile tem-
porarily providing équivalent sense-data to the normal
method, lacks permanence.
I cannot doubt, however, that the phenom ena of growth
in biology, and those characteristics of living things w hich
rem ain com pletely outside the région of explanation in terms
of physics and chemistry, w ill be profoundly illum inated b y
a fuller understanding o f these strange matérialisation
phenomena disclosed by psychical research. G. N . M . T yrrell
I M P O R T A N C E O F P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H 167
has reminded us in his Grades of Significance that an
aîtem pt to understand the phenomena of anysignificant level
in tenus of a lower level is doomed to faiiure, but that when
w e approach from the higher level real understanding is
possible. It is because this world-level of the psychic sether is
a bridge between what w e commoniy call m atter and m ind
— and is therefore just one step nearer to the Real— that I
advocate its study, believing that it has essential dues to offer
to a fuller understanding of the world around us.
W ithin the limits of a book such as this, it has been neces-
sary to select for exposition the best explored paths into this
territory. It goes without saying that there are scores of
phenomena w hich are proper material for psychical re-
search which it has been necessary to exclude. Dowsing, for
example, whether it be adapted to finding water, minerais,
or oil, or a diseased organ of the body, seems to be substan-
tially an example of the m ind’s clairvoyant faculty in action.
T h e use of a twig or piece of wire or a pendulum held in the
hands would then be regarded as a convenient conventions!
indicator to the conscious m ind of knowledge which the sub-
conscious m ind is able to acquire through its ^-faculty.
There may be types of energy radiation on the ætheric level
of a spécifie character to w hich the ætheric body of the
dowser is a sensitive receiver. These are apparently accepted
as factual, and are being studied under the general title of
radiesthesia b y people in different parts of the world.1 Such
radiations of an ætheric type may exist, and it is désirable
that proof or disproof of their existence should be secured b y
a responsible trustworthy body such as the Society for
Psychical Research. A t présent, daim s are put forward on
the strength of evidence w hich is far from convincing to the
scientific mind. In so strange and novel a field as this, every

observation should be repeated m any times and corroborated
by m any observers, and in particular it should be demon-
strated that well-established ^-faculty is unequal to account-
ing for the facts.
It will be a misfortune if conservative science remams
aloof and indifferent m uch longer to w hat can now be
regarded as the thoroughly tested and well-established data
of para-psychology. It will, on the other hand, be a misfor­
tune, if on the expanding frontier of enquiry in this région,
a pseudo-science grows up, comprising fantastic hypothèses
and insufficiently tested data of observation.
F or M edicine : N e w M eth ods of D iagnosis and
T reatm en t
It w ill be clear that the zone or level between the m ental
and the material, w hich in this book w e hâve labelled
ætheric, must be one of great im portance to physical health.
I f the psychic æther, w hich w e hâve postulated, is modified
by m atter on the one hand and m ind on the other, it is only
to be expected that a com plex organised ætheric vehicle or
body m ay exist as a part of m an himself. T h ere is a long-
standing tradition of this, and m any sensitives hâve
described in some detail their “ clairvoyant” perception of its
character and functioning. It is described, for example, as
giving rise to an aura surrounding the physical body, w hich
it interpénétrâtes completely, although it extends a little
beyond its limits. This aura is said to vary in its character
and texture w ith physical health, and to be substantially
m odified where a physical organ is diseased. Such statements
should be capable of vérification by research collaboration
between a good clairvoyant and a m edical practitioner. Gare
would need to be taken to exclude telepathy between the
tw o collaborators, but if the facts are substantiated clair-
I M P O R T A N C E O F P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H 169
voyance on this level, i.e. o f the ætheric body, should be a
valuable aid in diagnosis.
Clairvoyants say that there are types of energy circulation
in this ætheric body. Again, if this be true it is highly
probable that they will hâve an intimate relationship to the
health of the physical body. It seems to m e possible that
L. E. Eeman, who has described his researches in a book
Co-operative Healing, has discovered and used therapeutic-
ally one of these energy circulations. His work bears the
stamp of honest and careful enquiry, and should be exam-
ined by those concerned with the relevance of these factors
to both physical and mental health.
A $art from the importance of the ætheric body or vehicle
— of which at the présent we know very little— it isclear that
^-faculty, if it could be exercised at will, would be of enor-
mous service in diagnosis. T h e use of ÿ-faculty by a medium
in trance would be one possible line of enquiry, but every-
thing would dépend on the particular level of the patient’s
personality with which the medium established rapport. A
more superficial level of m ind would probably resuit in re-
vealing fears, hopes, and wishes (as O sty found). On. the
other hand, rapport with the deeper levels of the patient
m ight provide reliable information on matters of physical
and psychological health and disease. T h e exercise of
^-faculty at will, in a State of approxim ately normal con-
sciousness, is a com parativelyrare gift. It would appear, how-
ever, that there m ay be means by which ÿ-faculty can be
developed and controlled. Such methods are found in certain
yogic practices, and hâve been known for a long time in the
East.
There are some drugs, such as mescaline, w hich appear to
give rise to extrasensory perception, and it m ay weli be that
these or other related drugs w ill also make possible the
exercise of psycho-kinesis. Sometimes anæsthetics hâve un-
170 P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H
folded vistas of perception and even transcendental ex­
périence, but of the controlled possibility of this, or the
conditions favouring it, w e know very little as yet.
If, as the phenomenon of object-reading suggests (vide
Ghapter IV ), a good sensitive can b y touching an object
belonging to a person achieve a degree o f rapport w ith that
person, there is here available a potential m ethod of
diagnosis, both of physical and m ental disorders, not requir-
ing the presence of the patient. T h e sensitive w ho could
achieve 100 per cent, reliability b y such a m ethod is
probably extrem ely rare. D r. Connell’s book Perceptive
Healing describes experiments m ade w ith Miss Géraldine
Cum mins’ faculty in this w ay, and the results suggesî that
here m ay be a m ethod of great potentialities in the future.
I f extrasensory faculty m ay in the future aid diagnosis, it
is equally probable that psycho-kinesis m ay likewise aid
treatment. There are undoubtedly energies generated by the
m ind o f w hich w e know virtually nothing. T h ey m ay tilt a
dice or lift a heavy table. It is for the future to détermine
how to create, to control, and to direct such energies usefully
and precisely. There m ay w ell corne a tim e in the distant
future when the surgeon’s kn ifew ill becom e obsolète and the
operator be skilled in psycho-kinesis. W e are clearly only at
the beginning of strange new developments, which, fantastic
as they m ay appear to us in their applications, are not in fact
a n y stranger than some of the présent well-attested facts of
psychical research.
F or Ph ilo so ph y : N e w R e l e v a n t D ata
Philosophy is concerned w ith fundam ental questions
w hich underlie the various fields o f knowledge. Such prob-
lems as the nature o f knowledge and perception, o f the free-
dom of the will, of the status of space and time, of the nature
I M P O R T A N C E O F P S Y G H I C A L R E S E A R C H l*]l
of mind, and of w hat is real and w hat is illusory— these are
basic thèmes of philosophy. T he ordinary man attempting
to understand the views of philosophers finds himsftlf
immersed in a specialised terminology which he cannot
understand, but he is, nevertheless, aware of the need for a
“philosophy of life” . T he world familiar tohim , and the life
he has to live, présent problems which clamour for under-
standing m his méditative moments. O f these w e shall say a
little in the concluding section.
There are m any points at which, it seems to me, the data
of psychical research hâve a bearing on phiiosophical en-
quiry. (i) T h e relations of m ind to brain. (2) T h e problems
of TBne and Causation in relation to precognition. (3) T he
nature o f perception in relation to phenomena such as
^-faculty, apparitions, and out-of-the-body expérience. (4)
T h e old problems of force and action-at-a-distance in the
light o f psycho-kinesis.
T h e author has no compétence in philosophy and can do
no more than suggest that here m ay be new and relevant
data.
F or R eligion : A Friendly A l l y
T he question m ay hâve occurred to the reader’s mind as
to whether there is any relationship between psychical re­
search and religion. Fundamentally, I think that any rela­
tionship is quite remote. View ing the human self as a kind
of hierarchy or synthesis of m any different levels of reality—
physical, ætherie, emotionakmental, intuitive, transcendentaj
(or sp iritu a l)-^ will be clear that psychical phenomena are
concem ed with the lower levels o f personality and the in-
sights o f religion are concerned with the higher levels. There
is, of course, a comruon misconception that w hat is “non-
m aterial” is ipso facto “spiritual” , but such a dichotomy of
the world is quite valueless, and more précisé terms must be
172 P S Y C H I G A L R E S E A R C H
used if we are to account for the data of observation and
expérience*
T h e term ‘‘religion5
5 is used to em brace m any different
ideas. T h e essence of religion I take to be the m ystical in-
sights of some great soûl. T h e goal of religions aspiration, I
assume, is to share in these insights oneself— to expérience
and partake of that same reality. T h e term “religion5
5
, how-
ever, usually mcludes intellectual formulations and interpré­
tations of these insights, which corne to be built into, or form
the basis of, a system of thought, viz, a theology. T h e term
also covers a praxis— that is, a System of ritual w hich is the
expression on a symbolic level of the truths that are believed
by the faithful.
O n the highest level of m ystical insight, there is no point
of contact w ith psychical research. O n the lower level of the
intellectual form ulation of religious belief, there is perhaps
a point of relationship. D uring the last century the prevail-
ing scientific attitude of m aterialism and rationalism was
antagonistic to religious belief. This attitude is now slowly
changing, due to new ideas arising within science itself, but
the data of psychical research are providing a final death-
blow to materialism. W ith the récognition of new energies
and new phenom ena quite outside the scheme of physical
law, pointing as they do aw ay from a non-m aterial order,
the clim ate of opinion created should be m uch m ore sym-
pathetic and open to consider the data of révélation.
There is one other point at w hich psychical research im-
pinges on matters of interest to religion. In their historié
beginnings ail of the great religions hâve records in their
scriptures and sacred books of m iraculous happenings. In a
less scientific âge these were regarded as lending an aura of
prestige to those w ho worked them— providing, indeed, the
hall-m ark of divine approval of the Teacher. In the recent
era of scientific materialism, miracles w ere viewed by intelli-
I M P O R T A N C E O F P S Y C H I C A L R E S E A R C H 173
gent people as a stumbling block, as evidence of the in­
trusion of a good deal of superstition and legend into the
records. Today, most if not ail of the miracles can be
accepted as crédible in the light of the phenomena con-
sidered in this book. Powers of the mind which w e hâve
corne across already, if fully under the control of the will,
would be capable of performing these miracles. O ur concept
of the term “m iracle” would then be of an unusual physical
event, inexplicable on the basis of current laws of the
physical world, but w holly “natural” as an exercise of the
powers and energies of the mental level.
I can see no reason w hy Religion should not view
PsycM cal Research as a friendly fellow-traveller in the
search for Truth. Psychical Research is prim arily a search
for T ruth by the well-established scientific method of experi-
m ent and b y the traditional method of analysis of testimony
common to such disciplines as law and history. Its field
extends between the fam iliar material world we know
through our senses and the so-called subjective world of
M ind, Behind the levels of M ind are unplumbed depths of
being w hich take us nearer to the ultim ately Real. But this
is the territory— awesome, fascinating, rapturous, and in-
infinitely more important— of the Mystics.
