FROM WILLIAM MILLER.
'l'lIE ULEANSING 0F THE SANCTUARY.
DEAR BROTHER HIMES:-One short year
more of trials and afflictions, and I shall ex-
pect to see Him who will justify himself, his
word, and his people, before all flesh; and
then he will cleanse his sanctuary, and
"make the place of his feet glorious." Then
will his tabernacle be with men, and he will
dwell among them, and he will be their God,
and they shall be his people. Sighing and
sorrow shall be done away; tears shall be
wiped from off all faces, and death itselfbe de-
stroyed; and we shall reign with him on the
earth. What a glorious prospect! VVhat a
blessed hope! How full of immortality and
eternal life ! Come, Lord Jesus, 0 come
quickly!
You may ask, What is meant in Daniel
viii. 14-" Then shall the sanctuary be
cleansed?" I will answer you according to
my understanding; and if I am not right,
please to correct me.
"Sancluary," in the Scripture, generally
means the placewhere God is worshipped and
adored, and where he or his glory dwells,
4 cr.mNsnve or 'rua sane-rumv.
when it has reference to God or
holy things;
but when it has reference to man, it means
his house, or dwelling-place, city, or de-
fence.
I. Jesus Christ is called a
sanctuary. Isa.
viii. 14: "And he shall be for a
sanctuary;
but for a stone of stumblingand for a rock
of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a
gin
and for a snare to the inhabitants of
erusalem." Ezek. xi, 16: "Therefore say,
thus saith the Lord God: Although I have
cast them far oil' among the heathen, and
although lhave scattered them among the
countries, yet will Ibe to them as a. little
sanctuary in the countries where they shall
come." Why is he called a
sanctuary? Be-
cause God dwells in his person, and through
him we worship God. He is the refuge,
into which the righteous run and are safe.
II. Heaven is called a
sanctuary; because
God dwells there, is worshipped and adored
there, and it is the refuge of the saints.
Psalm cii. 19: "For he hath looked down
from the height of his sanctuary; from
heaven did the Lord behold the earth." Ps.
xx. 2: "
Send thee help from the sanctuary,
and strengthen thee out of Zion."
III. Judah is called a sanctuary. Psalm
cxiv. 2: "Judah was his sanctuary, and
Israel his dominion." Because God dwelt
in Judah, and was particularly worshipped
among them, and Jerusalem was a place of
refuge for God's people.
crmusms or 'ran smcrumr. 5
IV. The Temple at Jerusalem is called a.
sanctuary. 1 Chron. xxii. 19: "Now set
your heart and your soul to seek the Lord
your God; arise, therefore, and build ye the
sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the ark
of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy
vessels of God, into the house that is to be
built to the name of the Lord." Exodus
xxv. 8: "And let them make me a sanc-
tuary; that I may dwell among them." And
the tent in the wilderness was so called, be-
cause it was for God to dwell in, and there
he was to be worshipped. Both were typical
of his glorious presence with his people.
V. The Holy of Holies .was called a sanc-
tuary. 1 Chron. xxviii. 10: "Take heed
now; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build
a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do
it." Lev. iv. 6: "And the priest shall dip
his Hnger in the blood, and sprinkle of the
blood seven times before the Lord, before the
vail of the sanctuary." This was a t pe of
heaven, and was called a
sanctuary illr the
same reason heaven is.
VI. The earth is called a
sanctuary. Isa.
lx. 13: "The glory of Lebanon shall come
unto thee, the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the
box together, to beautify the place of my
sanctuary; and I will make the place of my
feet glorious." It is so called because God
will dwell with his people on the earth.
1 Kings viii. 27 :
"
But will God indeed dwell
on the earth? behold the heaven and heaven
1*

of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
less this house that I have builded Z" Rev.
v. 10: "And hast made us unto our God
kings and priests : and we shall reign on the
earth." Rev. xx. 6: "Blessed and holy is
he that hath part in the iirst resurrection:
on such the second death hath no power, but
they shall be priests of God and of Christ,
and shall reign with him a thousand years."
It is also thus called because he Will be
worshipped in earth as in heaven. Matt. vi.
10: "
['hy kingdom come. Thy will be
done in earth as it is in heaven." Because
it is h-is inheritance. Psalm lxxxii.8: "Arise,
0 God, judge the earth: for thou shalt
inherit all nations." Rev. xi. 15: "And
the seventh angel sounded; and there were
greatvoices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms
of this world are become ,the kingdoms ofour
Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign
forever and ever." Psalm xcvi. 6-13:
"Honor and majesty are before him: strength
and beauty are in his sanctuary. Give unto
the Lord, 0 ye kindreds of the' people, give
unto the Lord glory and strength. Give
unto the Lord the glory due unto his name;
bring an oifering, and come into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holi-
ness: fear before him, all the earth. Say
among the heathen that the Lord reigneth:
the world also shall be established that it
shall not be moved; he shall judge the
people righteously. Lettho heavens rejoice,
cuamsme or 'rua SANCTUARY.

and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar,
and the fulness thereoi Let the field be
joyful, and all that is therein : then shall all
the trees of the Wood rejoice before the Lord;
for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
earth: he shall judge the world with righte-
ousness, and the people with his truth."
VII. The saints are called a
sanctuary;
1 Cor. iii. 16,,17: "Know ye not that ye are
the temple of God, and that the Spiritof God
dwelleth in you? If any man defile the
temple of God, him shall God destroy: for
the temple of God is holy, which temple ye
are." For the reason that God dwells in
them, is worshipped by them, and they are
his inheritance. 2 Cor. vi. 16 : "And what
agreement hath the temple of God with idols 'P
for ye are the temple of the living God; as
God hath said, I will dwell in them, and
walk in them; and I will be their God, and
they shall be my people." Eph. ii. 21, 22:
"In whom all the building fitly framed to-
gether, groweth unto a
holy temple in the
Lord: in whom ye also are builded together,
for a habitation of God through the spirit."
The question now arises, Which ot" these
sanctuaries does Daniel mean, or the saint
who talked with Daniel, when he said,
"Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed 'I"
I answer, not the first, Christ, for he is not
impure. Not the second, heaven, for that is
not unclean. Not the third, in Judah, for
literal Judah in cut oil, and is no morea.
8 cnmnsme or rm: smcruanv.
people. Isa. lxv. 15: "And ye shall leave
your name for a curse unto my chosen: for
the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his
servants by another name." God will re-
member his covenant with literal Judah no
more forever, neither shall it come into mind;
but he will make a new covenant, in which
regeneration will be indispensable, and the
circumcision of the heart, instead of the
"
letter," will qualify them for the inherit-
ance of the sanctuary. Not the fourth, the
temple, for that is destroyed, and what is
not, cannot be numbered. Matt. xxiv. 2:
"And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all
these things? verily, l say unto you, There
shall not be left here one stone upon another,
that shall not be thrown down." Neither
the Holy of llolies in the temple at Jerusa-
lem, for that too was destroyed with the
temple. Daniel ix. 26: "And after three-
score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut
oll§ but not for himself: and the people of
the prince that shall come shall destroy the
city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof
shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the
war desolatious are determined." See Paul's
reasoning in Heb. ix. 1-12.
Then there are but two things more, which
may be called a
sanctuary, which may, or
ever will require cleansing; and those are
the .EARTH and the CHURCH : when these are
cleansed, then, and not till then, will the
entire sanctuary of God be cleansed, and
jZl&'if5§d, (as it reads in the margin.)

The next question which arises is, How
will the earth be cleansed? I answer, by
fire. 2 Peter iii. 7: "But the heavens and
the earth, which are now, by the same word
are kept in store, reserved unto fire against
the day ofjudgment and perdition of ungodly
men." When will the earth and the wicked
be burned by fire? I answer, when our God
shall come. Titus ii. 13: "Looking for that
blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ."
You will say, Where is your proof that it
will be at his coming? I answer, Psalm
xlvi. 6-10; l. 3: "Our God shall come,
and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
devour before him, and it shall be very
tempestuous round about him." xcvii. 3:
"A fire goeth befbre him, and bumeth up
his enemies round about." Isa. lxvi. 15, 16:
"For behold, the Lord will come with fire,
and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to
render his
anlger
with fury, and his rebuke
with flames o (ire. For by fire and by his
sword will the Lord plead with all flesh:
and the slain of the Lord shall be 1nany."
Nahum i. 5, 6: "The mountains quake at
him, and the hills melt, and the earth is
burned at his presence, yea, the world, and
all that dwell therein. Who can stand be-
fore his indignation? and who can abide in
the iierceness of his anger? his fury is poured
out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down
by him." Mal. iii. 17, 18; and iv. 1--3:
10 cnzimsmo or 'run smcrumv.
"For behold, the day cometh, that shall
bum as an oven; and all the proud, yea,
and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble:
and the day that cometh shall burn them up,
saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave
them neither root nor branch. But unto you
that fear my name, shall the Sun of righteous-
ness arise with healing in his wings; and
ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of
the stall. And ye shall tread down the
wicked; for they shall be ashes under the
soles of your feet in the day that I shall do
this, saith the Lord of hosts." Matt. xiii.
41-43: "The Son of man shall send forth
his angels, and they shall gather out of his
kingdom all things that offend, and
them
which do iniquity; and shall cast them lnto
a iitrnace of fire: there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous
shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him
hear." Matt. xiii. 49, 50: "So shall it be
at the end of the world; the angels shall
come forth, and sever the wicked from
among the just, and shall cast them into the
fttrnaee of
(fire:
there shall be wailing and
gnashingo teeth." 2'1'hess. i. 7-10: "And
to you, vho are troubled, rest with us, when
the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming
fire, taking vengeance on them that know
not God, and that obey not the gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished
cmunsme or 'run smcrunr. 11
.With everlasting destruction from the pres-
ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his
power; when he shall come to be glorified
in his saints, and to be admired in all them
that believe (because our testimony among
you was
believed) in that day." 2 Peter iii.
10-13 :
"
But the day of the Lord will come
as a thief in the night; in the which the
heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the elements shall melt with fervent
heat, the earth also and the works that are
therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that
all these things shall be dissolved, what
manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy
conversation and godliness, looking for and
'hasting unto the coming of the day of God,
wherein the heavens being on fire shall be
dissolved, and the elements shall melt with
fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according
to his promise, look for new heavens and a
new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
If this evidence will not satisfy Brother
Cheney, and others, that the earth and
wicked are burned at the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, before he reigns with his saints
on the earth, 110 words can prove it. For it
is the new heavens and new earth on which
Christ reigns; and the new heavens and new
earth are never to be burned, but to remain
forever; Isa. lxvi. 22; "For as the new
heavens and the new earth, which I will
make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord,
so shall your seed and your name remain."

Heb. xii. 27: "And thisword, Yet once
more, signifieth the removing of those things
that are shaken, as of things that are made,
that those things which cannot be shaken
may remain." And in that day of his reign,
or thousand years of his glorious reign, the
bodies of the wicked are ashes under the feet
of the saints. Isa. iv. 2-4: "In that day
shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and
glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be
excellent and cornely for them that are
escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass,
that he that is left in Zion, and he that re-
maineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy,
even every one that is written among the
living in Jerusalem: when the Lord shall
have Washed away the Iilth of the daughters
of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of
Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of bum-
ing." Ezek. xxviii.18: "Thou hast detiled
thy sanctuaries .by the multitude of thine
iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic;
therefore will I bring forth a fire from the
midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will
bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the
sight of all them that behold thee." Also,
Mal. iv. 3: "And ye shall tread down the
wicked; for they shall be ashes under the
soles of your feet in the day that I shall do
this, saith the Lord of hosts." Do these
brethren believe that after the resurrection
of the wicked their bodies are to be burned,
¢l-EAITSXNG or _'rin swcrunr. :13
and become ashes-'! -
If so, pray give me 'proo£
Are their bodies durable or not? ~If not, tell
me, how can they be tormented day and
-night, fbrever and ever? 'I`he only text that
I have ever known them bring, is in Rev. xx.
9: "
And they went up on the breadth of the
earth, and compassed the camp of the saints
about, and the beloved city: and fire came
down from God out of heaven, and devoured
them." And this text cannot mean.litera1
fire; for it would be very inconsistent to
suppose that durable bodies could be con-
sumed. The next verse explains. The
justice of God comes down and drives them
from the earth, or consumes them from the
earth. "Our God is a consuming fire."
-
The next question,-When will the saints
be cleansed, or justified? I answer, When
our Lord shall come. The whole church
will then be cleansed from all uncleanness,
and presented without spot or wrinkle, and
will then be clothed with fine linen, clean
and white. For proof, see l Cor. i. 7, 8:
"So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting
for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
who shall also confirm you unto theend,
that ye may be blameless in the day of our
Lord Jesus Christ." Eph. v. 26, 27: "That
he might sanctify and cleanse it with the
washing of water by the word, that he might
presentit to himself a
glorious church, not
having spot or wrinkle, or, any such thing;
but that it should be holy and without blem-
2
14 ouutsme or 'rn smcrunr.
ish." Phil. iii. 20, 21: "
For our conver-
sation is in heaven; from whence also we
look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
who shall change our vile body, that it may
be fashioned like unto his glorious body,
according to the working whereby he is able
even- to subdue all things tmto himselfl"
1 John iii. 2: "
Beloved, now are we the
sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what
we shall be: but we know that, when he
shall appear, we shall be like him; for we
shall see him as he is." Rev. xix. 8: "And
to her was
granted that she should be arrayed
in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine
linen is the righteousness of saints."
"
Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,"
when the will of God is done in earth as in
heaven. How perfectly inconsistent it is to
suppose that after Christ reigns on the earth
a thousand years, and possesses the king-
dom under the whole heaven, and all earthly
kingdoms are conquered, and broken to
pieces, and carried away, so that no place is
found for them-and after the saints possess
the kingdom, and have the dominion forever
and ever ;-that the devil, after all this, is to
obtain possession of the earth again, and
overpower the immortal saints, with Christ
at their head, so that a necessity would arise
for God to burn up the world, the beloved
city, and all the saints in it; for the saints
are never to be removed from the earth, after
Christ comes. Prov. x. 30: "The righteous
§
_
cnsmsme or 'nm snwrumv. 15
shall never be removed: but the wicked shall
not inhabit the earth." It is too absurd to ad-
mit even the thought for a moment. Yet this
must be the legitimate consequence of the
doctrine of those who believe that the earth
is not cleansed by fire until after the thou-
sand years' reign of Christ on the earth.
And Peter tells us plainly, (2 Pet. iii. 7,) "But
the heavens and the earth, which are now,
by the same word are kept in store, reserved
unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men." And it is cer-
tainly true that when the Ancient of days
comes and sits upon his throne, and the Son
of man comes before him with the clouds of
heaven, then the present heaven and earth
pass away. Dan. vii. 9-13: "I beheld till
the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient
of days did sit, whose garment was whiteas
snow, and the hair of his head like the pure
wool: his throne was like the fiery flame,
and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery
stream issued and came forth from before
him: thousand thousands ministered unto
him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
Stood before him: the judgment was set, and
the books were opened. ~I beheld then be-
cause of the voice of the great Words which
the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast
was slain, and his body destroyed, and given
to the burning flame. As concerning the
restrof, the beasts, they had their dominion
taken away: yet their lives were prolonged

for a season and time. I saw in the night
visions, and behold, one like the Son of man
came with the clouds of heaven, and came
to the Ancient of days, and they brought him
near before him." 2 Peter iii. 10: "
But the
day of the Lord will come as a thief in the
night; in the which the heavens shall pass
away with a
great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also
and the works that are therein shall be
bumed up." Rev. xx. 11: "And I saw a
great white throne, and him that sat on it,
from whose face the earth and the heaven
fled away; and there was found no place for
them." All this at the coming of Christ.
2 Thess. i. 7-10: "
And to you, who are
troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven with his
mighty angels, in flaming (ire, taking ven-
geance on them that know not God, and that
obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
who shall be plmished with everlasting de-
struction from the presence of the Lord, and
from the glory of his power; when he shall
come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
admired in all them that believe (because
our testimony a_nong you was believed) in
that day." Will this new heaven and new
earth be burnt up? Pray tell us how these
things can be. _
