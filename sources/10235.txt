  					 Hello my name is Delona and this is my story. In 1977 I was in a car accident and my son, age 8 1/2 was killed.  I broke 90 percent of my body. My daughter age 4 had her spleen ruptured. While the driver of the car we were in did not get hurt. After we were in the ambulance, the EMTs were working on my son. At the time, I did not know that he was so badly hurt. I remember holding out my left hand and taking hold of his right hand.


Then I remember one of the EMTs saying, “We just lost the Mother too.”


Then my son and I were walking hand in hand through a dark tunnel.  After we came to the end of the tunnel, loved ones and friends who had died were waiting for us. Then Jesus walked over to me and said that I had a choice; I could stay in Heaven or go back to Earth. He said that he would show me what would happen in my life if I was to go back to Earth but I was not going to remember any of it. I remember that my life was going to be hard and full of pain. I looked at my son and told him that I loved him very much; I then took his hand and placed it in my Uncle's hand.


I then told Jesus and my son that I had to go back to Earth because my daughter had nobody but me to care for her. In a blink of an eye, I was back in my body and still in the ambulance. I heard an EMT say, “My God, the Mother is back.”


In the years since that day, life has been very hard.  If I had it to do all over again, I would not have come back. I am the only person that I know that Jesus has given a choice to, but I know that there has to be more people out there. Life is still full of pain for me, not only because I lost the life of my son, but also because of all the injuries I had.  My daughter turned out to be a great pain, a very hateful person. I would have been better off if I would have stayed with Jesus and my son.
