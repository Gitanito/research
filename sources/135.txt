 This was a "naturalist" (nudist, natural living, water cure, and vegetarian) spiritualist journal.  The connection between nudism/naturism and spiritualism is not unusual and can be found in Naturopath, Lumiere et Liberte, and other journals.  Perhaps because of its encouragement of nudism (with regular plates of carefully posed, happy excursionists in the all-together), the journal was largely anonymous and pseudonymous.  To show its catholic (though distinctly non-Catholic) approach to spiritualism the title page of the journal carried portraits of Kardec, Amelia Domingo y Soler and Miguel Vives, and the section on "Nuestro Naturismo" showed pictures of Khune, Priessnitz, Kneip, and other prominent forerunners of naturism.  For unknown reasons, the journal changed the color of the text with every issue.  The journal included "Medianimicas" (reports of seances held by the organization), reports of conferences on naturism and the excursions of the Cenaculo's members into the wild, and extensive discussions on pacifism and disarmament and on "Nuestra Alimentacion Natural" (salt as the "agent of death"), etc.  Archivo General de la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola; BNE.
