I had a near death, out of body experience when my racing motorcycle crashed over a mountain ridge. I remember my consciousness floating high above the accident site, seeing my body sprawled on the ground next to the motorcycle on its side, watching people walk up to, stand, and look as the ambulance drove up. Then I was instantly back in my body looking up at the paramedics who were asking me " can you hear me...don't move ...where's it hurt?"
