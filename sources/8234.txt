  		              		Experience Description   

    I tripped at the top of a flight of stairs and fell down to the bottom of the stairs - all the way on my back. I got up at the bottom. I could not breathe in, only out. I knew I was dying.  I was totally calm and accepting of it, since I knew there was nothing I could do to change the fact that I was dying. I thought for a second how strange it was that I was so calm, because I always expected to be panicked if I would be in a life-threatening situation. I gasped to my wife to call an ambulance and then collapsed. 

  I blacked out for a second or two and then found myself floating above my body.  It was face down and lying on the floor. I didn't really think about the fact that I was out of my body. To me, it was just someone's body lying on the floor. I kind of knew it was mine, but it did not alarm me because I felt totally fine. 

The whole atmosphere around me was bathed in a purplish light.  It was like I was floating in an illuminated purple cloud but I could see everything in the house as usual, but through the cloud. I had no more pain and thought that I had dreamed about falling down the stairs and hurting my back.  But now, I had woken up from that horrible dream, and I was fine and had absolutely no pain anywhere. I was completely conscious and aware and felt fine. 

Then I started moving into a dark tunnel that seemed to just open up behind me.  All I saw were hundreds of people along the sides of the tunnel.  They were staring at me with shocked expressions on their faces.  Then some people started shouting at me to go back.  Then other people were shouting at me that it was not my time and that I had to go back. I did not recognize anyone I saw there. I was very shocked and scared at their expressions and the way they were shouting at me.  So I backed away from them and felt myself moving backwards out of the tunnel.

 The next thing I knew was that I heard/felt a loud POP and I was back in my body. Pain flooded back into my awareness. I jumped up and ran outside to get into the cold air to try alleviate the pain in my back. I was taken to the hospital where I was told after X-rays that my back was badly bruised but nothing was broken. It took me a few months to recover and get back to normal.

It was more vivid and stayed with me in more clarity and detail than other events that happened that day. I hardly remember going to the hospital or going back home or anything else that happened that day other than falling down the stairs being in terrible pain, not being able to breathe, feeling totally calm knowing I was dying, collapsing, and then being out of my body in the purple light, seeing the people in the tunnel shouting to me to go back, being very scared at them and popping back into my body and having all the pain flooding back into me.
