THE FIFTY-SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE
THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY
T H E P R E S I D E N T I A L A D D R E S S
Brethren :
Once more from the Chair to which you re-elected me for the third
time in 1921 I bid you a warm and glad welcome to the Central
Headquarters in the physical world of our Masters’ Theosophical
Society. W e have come to the last half-year of my term of office, and
I render to you my report of the ever-spreading activities of our beloved
Society. But you w ill join me first in our annual invocation to Those
who arc our Guides, leading us from the unreal to the Real, from
darkness to Light, from death to Im m ortality :
May Those who are the embodiment of Love Im m ortal, bless with
Their protection the Society established to do Their W ill on earth ; may
They ever guard it by Their Power, inspire it with Their W isdom, and
energise it by Their A ctivity.
TheComing ofthe World-Teacher
The outstanding event of the year for those of our members who
believe in the H ierarchy and in its immemorial relationship with our
world, is, of course, the completion of the long preparation for the
Coming of the W orld-Teacher, beginning in 1909, by H is own announce­
ment that Ho had chosen the body of one then a child, which, if he
should prove to be worthy of the choice when he grew to manhood, H e
would use “ on M y approaching visit to your world Shortly after
that statement the child came to A dyar, with his father, a widower,
4 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
and his younger brother. The two young boys were made my
wards, and after some difficulties, I sent them to England and they
were privately educated there. W hen the time was ripe, the special
preparation of the body took place in California and Ita ly , and
finally in Holland, where in August of the present year, 1927, such
part of the consciousness of the W orld-Teacher as could manifest
within the limitations of a human physical body descended and abode
in him, taking up the human consciousness into wondrous association
with the Divine Life . I, who have known him from a little child, and
have served him to my utmost ability, now have become his devoted
disciple and still serve him wherever I can.
The Society has suffered two great losses, one by the calling Home
of D r. M ary Rocke, who suddenly passed away from heart failure on
board ship, travelling in the same vessel with our little party. The
second, by the call which came to Sir Sadashivier, the noble retired
Judge of the H igh Court, Madras, who had consecrated all his time,
after he had left the Bench he adorned, in visiting the villagers of the
Presidency, in the company of his devoted and able wife, teaching them
in their own vernacular Hinduism in the light of Theosophy, and using
his high intelligence to purify and broaden their faith.
I mentioned last year that the externalisation of our F irst Object in
the practical manifestation of the Fellowship of Faiths had been
advanced by the foundation in the United States of a sim ilar movement,
started there within a few weeks of our own Convention ; I may add
that this year in London the pioneers of that movement visited England,
and held two very successful meetings in the C ity Temple, London, a
famous Nonconformist building, rendered illustrious by the names of
Moncure D . Conway, M r. John Robertson, the R ev. M r. Campbell, and
others. It has ever been a centre of light and leading. Two very
successful meetings were held there in the early summer and autumn ;
in the first, each speaker expounded his own faith ; in the second, he
spoke on what he regarded as the most valuable characteristics of
Christianity. A London journal made the quaint remark that in many
places of worship we heard attacks on other religions, but never before
had been heard appreciations of different religions by each other.
The W orld U niversity, the synthesising aspect of our Second
Object, has continued its unobtrusive and useful work in its three centres
THE PRESID EN TIA L ADDRESS 5
in Adyar, Loudon, and in a considerable group in Java. A new centre
in Holland has been opened, and one in France. The writing o£ Text­
books is going on. D r. Cousins is still the ever-active head of the studies,
and his energy seems to increase every year. H is cultural work is most
useful, especially in the prominence he gives to the wonders of Indian
painting and sculpture. M rs. Cousins adds her remarkable powers to the
uplifting of music in Madras.
The preparations for the Revival of the Mysteries, the practical
side of our Third Object go steadily forward.
Our International Lecturers
F ru k . D ijkgraaf, who had resigned from the General Secretaryship
of the Netherlands Section after years of most efficient and devoted
work, has been appointed one of our international lecturers for Dutch,
Germ an and English-speaking countries. Also, for the same area,
I have appointed Heer Vigevcno, who is doing specially useful service
in Germ any. Such lecturers from abroad give a great impulse to
Theosophical activities in other countries, and often remove misconcep­
tions due to ignorance.
Adyar Day
Once more we have to express our grateful thanks to M r. F ritz
K unz and D r. Ernest Stone for the exercise of their organising talents
on behalf of Adyar D ay.
The Auditor’s Sum m ary shows that in 1924,
A dyar received $ 1711*64

T ru ly a noble gift to the Headquarters from a single Section.
The clerical and other work has been done by voluntary helpers, with a
single exception, due to the heavy work for the Order of the Star
6 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
done by D r. Stone. The little notice sent mentions that the idea
originated with Mmo. M anziurly, and was taken up by M r. F ritz
K u n z— that tireless worker— for the United States. The Committee,
in addition to these two, has been : M ary S. Rogers, Alm a K u n z-
G ulick, H a rry J . Budd, Anna M. B rin kley. M ay I once more pay
the tribute of thanks to all who have so helped “ Our Masters
Land ” .
The U.S.JL. Headquarters
W e must w arm ly congratulate the General Secretary and the
Theosophical Society in the United States, on their great achievement
of completing their Headquarters at Wheaton within a year ; I laid the
foundation-stone last summer (1926), and the building and gardens were
opened this year. D r. and M rs. Arundale, who were the guests of
honor at the Convention of*-this year, speak enthusiastically of the
beauty and convenience of the new Centre.
Dr. and Mrs. Cousins
These tireless workers, one of whom is the creator of the Bralnna-
vidyRshrama, and the other the founder of the Indian Women’s Associa­
tion, are leaving for a tour round the W orld, that w ill take about a
year and a half. D r. Cousins w ill give a course of lectures at Yale
U niversity and at the U niversity of Tokyo, and who knows at what
others. W e shall miss them badly, but they have promised to write
for New India, and, I hopo, also for The Theosophi.st. This last
note does not belong to what is now last year. But thanks to the
speech being late in appearing, I shamelessly insert it here, in the
proof.
Charters up to the end of 1927
The number of Charters granted from the commencement of tho
Society to the end of 1926 was 2,519. In 1927, 89 new Charters wore
granted, raising the number to 2,608. 6,538 diplomas to new members
were issued, being 305 more new members than in 1926.

8 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
OurNational Sooiotieo
United States. A remarkable advance is reported, the visit of the
President being credited with the bringing back to the Society of a
large number who had dropped out. The net gain in membership for
the year is 639. The event of the year is the finishing and dedication
in August of the new headquarters building at Wheaton. The work of
placing literature on Theosophy in public libraries reported last year has
been carefully carried on. Three hundred libraries were thus supplied.
The Theosophical press shows an advance on last year. Increased
interest in Theosophy by young people is reported.
England. New members numbered 672, thus wiping out the
deficit in the number of enrolments in the previous year. The President
was in England for several months and presided at the Annual Conven­
tion in June. A t this Convention a resolution was passed expressing
the desirability of having a European Congress annually or biennially.
(This has been adopted by the Council of the European Federation,
which has decided to have a Congress annually in some European
country ) D r. Arundale and Shrim ati Rukm ini Devi, M r. J . Krishna-
murti and Bishop Wedgwood were also present at the Convention. In
June I delivered a series of lectures in the Queen’s H all on “ The New
Civilisation,” and M r. Jinarfljadasa lectured in the same hall on “ The
Divine Vision ” .
I was happy to be able to dedicate the fine and commodious new
premises of the Manchester Lodge on Ju ly 5. Baysw atcr (London)
Lodge has made a new departure in forming an A rt Group to draw
together those members who are artists and art-lovers, and to stimulate
and encourage the presentation of Truth as Beauty. Interesting
dramatic performances have been given under the auspices of this Lodgo.
During the year nearly a hundred special courses of lectures were
delivered in connection with various Lodges and Centres. Students’
week-ends were held in a number of places.
The General Secretary visited the United States of Am erica for a
lecture tour, and he records his happy recollections of the kindness
shown to him by the Am erican members.
The work of the Theosophical News Bureau in England
goes on.
THE PR ESID EN TIA L ADDRESS 9
India. A spirit o£ alertness and increase o£ life are reported.
Dormant members have decreased by half. Membership stands at 5,536,
a considerable increase on last year. Educational work in connection
with the Section is winning increased recognition, and is beneficially
influencing general education, especially in regard to the treatment of
children in schools. The work for the uplift of Indian women is
progressing, and brings an added strength to the Society through the
co-operation of women and men in the work of the Section.
The A ll-In d ia Federation of Young Theosophists received charters
for 11 Lodges during the year, making a total of 63 chartered Lodges,
with a regular membership of 2,034 and 84 associates. Organised
activity has been particularly evidenced in Maharashtra, the United
Provinces, Gujerat and Kathiaw ar, also in the Madras area where local
Federations are being formed. The Lodges have been active along
cultural and social service lines, and yeoman service was rendered to the
victims of the floods in Gujerat.
Australia. This virile Section sets a paco all its own. The broad­
casting station 2 G B has a splendid record of work, and its field of use­
fulness is growing. I t keeps its programmes up to a high standard and
caters specially for children. Through this wise general appeal the
prejudice against Theosophy has largely broken down. Bishop Lead-
beater has twice spoken over the radio with great effect. Australia has
given an example to the whole Society in the raising of funds for work.
It shows confidence in age bv giving Bishop Leadbeater youth to train
and a place to train them in, and it shows its confidence in youth in
having the youngest General Secretary.
Sweden. Thirty-seven new members were admitted during the
year. The Theosophical Bookshop supplies the public with books on
all kinds of idealistic subjects. I presided at the Convention in August.
New Zealand. The General ¡Secretary, touring as National
Lecturer, reports steady progress, and notes the enthusiasm and
devotion of many small country Lodges. There is an increase of
71 members. The various movements connected with the ¡Section arc
all working harmoniously. A group of visitors from Australia helped
to make the Convention a great success.
The Netherlands. The General Secretary has been released in
order to work up the European Federation and its Congress in Brussels
2
10 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
next summer. The new headquarters building at Amsterdam is nearing
completion. The National Council w ill share the building with the
Amsterdam Lodge. The Theosophical Order of Service has done much
good work. The Young Thcosophists have now eleven local groups.
The central office in Utrecht does both national and international work.
The members carry on meditation, study and action, and arc earnest
and reliable.
France. France reports a year of steady progress. Eig h t new
Lodges have been 'established, and there has been a net gain of 198
members. Three Lodges are dormant. M r. Jinarajadasa presided
at the Annual Convention, and his lectures were a source of much
inspiration and strength. W ork of outstanding importance is being
carried on by the publishing department. Many books have been
produced and sales are steadily increasing, much to the satisfaction of
the General Secretary, who regards this as one of the best means of
propaganda among the educated public. A branch of the Theosophical
W orld-U niversity Association was founded.
Ita ly . Ita ly sends no Report.
Germany. Germ any reports the formation of thirteen new Lodges
and a stirring of new life and enthusiasm largely through tours by
M r. Jose Vigeveno of Amsterdam and M r. John Cordes of Vienna.
Deep gratitude is expressed for his self-sacrificing labour, and the
Section has appointed him its National Lecturer. I presided at the 25th,
semi-jubilee, Convention in Hamburg. M y public lectures at Hamburg
and Berlin w ill be published by M r. Pieper who, continues his useful
activities in this line. Lack of funds and lecturers had greatly
hampered the Section’s work, but this year sees it once more firm ly
established, with every promise of future growth and activity.
Cuba. Cuba has a very satisfactory story to tell. She has
released a whole new potential Section from her ranks, yet remains
strong and actually larger. Nine Lodges, with 234 members, branched
off to form the Central Am erican Federation under a Presidential
Agent. Cuba has also been responsible for the development of the
Latin Am erican Theosophical Federation. Five Sections have joined
it, and they plan a Congress in Havana in 1928.
Hungary reports that the past year has been one of the most
eventful in the history of the Section. The Theosophical Order of
THE PRESID EN TIA L ADDRESS 11
Service and the Round Table have been reorganised, and the Young
Theosophists carry on very useful activities. The greatest difficulty
to be contended against is the lack of funds, the result of the extreme
post-war poverty of the Nation. French members sent a generous
donation to meet the most urgent requirements, and the Theosophical
Society in W ales made a gift of books. A succession of visitors,
including myself, are stated to have given great help and stimulus by
lectures.
Finland. I had the pleasure of flying to Finland in August.
The Section is developing its work along cultural lines, and is going to
erect a new headquarters building. Mrs. A dair’s visit from A dyar
aroused widespread interest in Indian art, on which she lectured with
original paintings as illustrations. Other activities were helped by a
number of visitors, such as Bishop Wedgwood, Madame Poushkine
and Miss Naomi Maggo.
Russia. The Russian Theosophical Society, whose members are,
under present political circumstances, outside Russia, ends a most
interesting Report. It is everywhere— Shanghai, San Francisco, and
most of the countries of Europe have at least one Lodge each. Many
activities are in operation, and books and a little magazine in Russian
are printed. In Tientsin (China) the Lodge runs a regular popular
university with evening courses. These scattered Lodges carry on a
very effective work for internationalism chiefly through the General
Secretary.
Czecho-Slovakia reports that the work of the year has largelj
consisted in efforts towards the consolidation and adjustment of th<
activities of the Section, rendered necessary by the secession of man]
members in 1925. The first Convention since the reorganisation wa;
held in June, and an Executive Committee was elected. Financial
assistance has been given to the Section by the European Federation.
I visited Prague during the year. The General Secretary records help
given by visitors from other Sections.
South Africa reports steady progress. Membership has increased
by ninety. The first Lodge building in A frica is being erected in
Pretoria. Durban and Cape Town hope to follow suit. The
R t. Hon. V . S. Srinivasa Sastri, P .C ., the representative of India in
South Africa, has delivered lectures under the Society’s auspices to
12 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
large audiences. These have helped to create a spirit of tolerance and
goodwill towards Indians in South A frica. Nairobi Lodge has joined
the Section, and it is hoped that a Lodge w ill shortly be formed in
Lourenco Marques in Portuguese Ea st A frica. A tribute is given to the
good work done by Captain and M rs. Ransom.
Nairobi Lodge, mentioned above, sends a separate Report which is
interesting in its association with India in the fact that books in Urdu,
H indi and Gujerati, which are languages of India, as well as in English,
have been sold.
Scotland has not much to say about numbers, but emphasises work
through dramatic performances in various parts of the Section.
Discussion as a propaganda activity is also being tried. The young
people promise well for the future.
Switzerland sends no Report.
Belgium has increased its membership by 45. I visited the
Section during the year and gave two lectures. The Section has
realised a long-cherished wish in the purchase of a house to be used as
National Headquarters. This was made possible by the generosity of
many of the members. The Section has advanced towards the fulfil­
ment of its ideal of spreading spiritual enlightenment in Belgium and
congratulates itself on the fact that the next Convention of the E u ro ­
pean Federation w ill be held in its territory.
Netherlands-indies. The most important event rccordod for the
year was Bishop Leadbeater’s tour in November of 1926, when he
visited the island Lodges on his way to Benares. This was his third
visit, and as usual his presence evoked everywhere love and enthusiasm.
Steady progress is being maintained in the various activities. Malang
opened its new Lodge building at the Annual Convention, adding
another to the large number of important Lodges who own their own
premises. There are several magazines published in the Dutch, M alay
and Javanese languages.
Burma records much good work and progress, also very helpful
visits from Bishop Leadbeater and M r. Yadunandan Prasad. These
helped to dissipate certain shadows of prejudice on the matter of the
W orld-Religion which had hung in the air from the previous year.
Austria reports the visits of Bishop Wedgwood and myself.
Members of the Section are doing good work in other countries, and
THE PRESID EN TIA L ADDRESS
members of other Sections, such as M rs. Rathonyi, Miss W anda
Dynowski and Miss A . C. B ell, have paid helpful visits. An Action
Lodge has been created which has taken up propaganda work.
Norway sends no Report.
Denmark reports my visit. W ork is carried on in the face of
difficulty and some disharmony, but the membership steadily increases.
Lecturing to other societies continues successfully. It is hoped that
the Broadcasting B ill introduced into the Danish Parliam ent w ill soon
be passed. This gives every society which is fighting for ideals the
right to broadcast, and w ill, if passed, enable the Danish Section of
the Theosophical Society to resume its former work in this way. The
Summer School continues its good service.
Ireland. This Section still labours under difficulties, m ainly
material. Dublin and Belfast are the principal centres, but public
work is done also in Cork and D erry, and a new Centre has been
established at Coleraine. The quarterly magazine is doing good work
in relating the folk-lore of Ireland to the Ancient Wisdom. English
friends have helped the Section in finance and also by lecture visits.
Mexico reports that no marked progress of spread of the
Theosophical movement can at present be looked for, owing to the
“ unfavourable political and economic conditions of the country ” .
Nevertheless the General Secretary reports that the work has at least
maintained the level of former years. Headquarters have been estab­
lished in a suitable building in pleasant surroundings.
Canada reports much misunderstanding of the W orld Religion and
of the announcements at Ommen in 1925. There is a decrease in
membership through lapses. The Toronto travelling library is doing
good work. Individual members are active in the field of literature.
The death is reported of the author, Michael Sherk, of Toronto Lodge,
and of the essayist and musician, Francis Grierson.
Tho Canadian Federation of Young Theosophists has a tale of
excellent work to tell along various lines. The Summer School run by
Siriu s Lodge is arousing the interest of non-Theosophists, and is to be
a permanent organisation. The North-W est Federation has purchased
26 acres of land, which it calls “ Ind ralaya,’* on Orcas Island,
Washington, where it hopes to establish a permanent Theosophical
community and camping place for visiting members. The Federation
13
14 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
had visits from Bishop Arundale, Shrim ati Ruktnini Devi, and other
well-known Theosophists. A book centre has been built up, and a
.magazine is in contemplation. A ll this is very satisfactory, and I
sincerely congratulate the Federation.
Argentina reports good growth in the ninth year of the Section’s
life. W hile curiosity seekers have dropped out, new workers have
come in. The bi-monthly magazine goes to all the Spanish-speaking
countries. The Theosophical Lib rary Association is particularly active,
and co-ordinates all the subsidiary activities.
Chile reports general approval in the Section of the scheme for
the formation of Latin-Am erican Theosophical Federation. Much
interest is taken by members in the new methods in education and the
scheme for the establishment of the Theosophical W orld-U niversity.
The Section has beneiitted by the generous bequest of the greater
part of the estate of M r. M. Yuraszech, and gratitude is expressed
for this.
Brazil. The General Secretary resigned owing to ill-health, but
was requested to be permanent Honorary President. M r. J . Mesquita
was appointed in his place. Money is being collected to build
headquarters. Meantime roomier premises have been found. Lodges
are working efficiently and steadily. A Branch of the Theosophical
Order of Service has been started. S. Paulo Lodge is marked by well
organised activity. It publishes a magazine and runs a Theosophical
College with 280 students, some in residence. The residential section is
vegetarian. The Damodar Lodge, besides doing fine propaganda and
social work, runs a school for poor children. The translation of The
Secret Doctrine into Portuguese is proceeding.
Bulgaria is progressing steadily, and her members show a spirit of
unselfish service. Lecturing is the main activity. A t the consecra­
tion of a Lodge’s new premises (the gift of the upper storey of a house
by a member) a priest of each of four different faiths (Greek Church,
Muhammadan, Jewish and Liberal Catholic) gave their blessing. A fter
the ceremony, the priest of the Greek Church mentioned how moved
he was to see in this act the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy, the
reunion of the faiths and the communion of the H oly Spirit. Though
he was afterwards forced to deny this, it was published in all-the
newspapers.
THE PR ESID EN TIA L ADDRESS 15
Iceland announces growth and extension in all ways. The visit
of the Vice-President was a great help. The number of members has
doubled, and is now 366. There are three lecturers besides the General
Secretary. Eig h t subsidiary societies, including the Young Theo-
sophists, carry on effective activities.
Spain again sends no report, but we are aware from other sources
that there are signs of increasing activity in the Peninsula, and that
two groups of students, associated with the Brahm avidya Ashrama at
A dyar, are at work in M adrid and Barcelona. I hope next year w ill
bring a cheering report.
Portugal still finds itself hampered by political conditions, but the
Section carries on a ;4peaceful penetration The Fraternal League (a
charitable organisation) and the National League for the Protection of
Anim als, movements carried on by Theosophists, are doing much useful
work. The outstanding event of the year was the visit of M r. and
M rs. Jinarajadasa, when large audiences gathered to hear lectures on
Theosophieal topics.
Wales. During the year, the Section purchased its own head­
quarters building for Theosophieal and allied activities. A Trust has
been formed to hold the property. Mr D . Jeffrey W illiam s has been
appointed National Organiser and Publicity Secretary. An effort has
been made by the Section to establish May 18 as Goodwill Day
throughout the world.
Poland sends no report.
Uruguay reports much consolidation and re-organisation. A s a
result the financial outlook is better and the future very promising.
New activities of the Lodges have included musical and art evenings.
Members have visited the jails for juveniles. One Lodge devotes itself
to visiting and aiding the sick. There is great solidarity among the
Lodges, and work is laid out on seven lines, each member choosing a
line : education, social affairs, arts and sciences, religion and philo­
sophy, philanthropy, administration and finance.
Porto Rico sends no Report.
Rumania. W ork here is much handicapped by the political
situation. Touch is kept with isolated members who are supplied with
bojeks by the Bucharest Lodge. Transylvania hopes for recognition as
part of the Section in order to get permission to meet. The growth in
16 THE GENERAL REPORT OF TIIE T. S.
this district is admirable. Strong Lodges have developed from tho
parent one. The Section has a difficult w ork in bridging the gulf
between the various nationalities and cultures.
Yugoslavia presented me with a coat of the National costume
during my visit in August, and derived much pleasure from my wearing
it at my public lecture. In spite of natural deductions, the membership
has increased by ten per cent, and the Section has now members in
thirty different towns. A quarterly magazine is published, and books
are slowly com ing-out in the indigenous language. The Order of
Service is active.
Ceylon reports a net gain of 35 members, though there is a net loss
of one Lodge. The Youth Lodge is developing dramatic performances.
Funds arc being steadily collected for a headquarters building.
M r. H . F re i, who has done much good work for the cause of Theosophy
in Ceylon during the last 25 years, resigned the General Secretaryship
on leaving the island in June. -,M r. N . K . Choksy takes bis place.
Unseotionalised
China. Hong K ong Lodge keeps up its good work, all activities
showing growth and effectiveness. The members are generous, one
fam ily giving the headquarters hall. Regular publicity is secured by
clever use of the daily press. Many leaflets are distributed. W ork is
done among the army and navy and by correspondence. The book
department has done very good service.
A Chinese Lodge has budded off from the Hong Kong Lodge. It
works through the Chinese language, and uses its own members for
class-room and platform work. The officers are all Chinese and a
Chinese library is being collected. A lecture-practice class is carried on.
Shanghai Lodge has nearly doubled its membership. It keeps up
a good headquarters with many activities. “ F irst Steps in Theosophy ”
has been published in Chinese. This is very good. W e need Chinese
Lodges and Chinese books. Fo r China, though so ancient, has a future.
M iss Arnold’s splendid and lonely work is bearing fruit.
Singapore Lodge, after trying affiliation with the Nctherlands-
Indies Section, reverted to A dyar for linguistic reasons. Tho Locjge
owes its success to Bro, J . H . Ruttonjoe of Hong Kong, who has much
THE PR ESID EN TIA L ADDRESS 17
helped it in the matter of rooms and in a gift of 133 books. The Lodge
entertained Dr. Rabindranath Tagore when he passed through on his
way to Java.
Japan. Mahayana Lodge has been actively working since October,
after an interval of inactivity due to the ill-health of the chief workers
and the death of D r. Em m a Erskine H ahn. The booklet “ Information
for Enquirers ” has been translated into Japanese for early publication. It
is hoped that a book on Theosophy in Japanese w ill be published in 1928.
Egypt. A fter last year’s stormy period, work is proceeding
quietly in an atmosphere of brotherhood. Two members of the Lodge
have translated At the Feet of the Msater into Arabic, and this has
been published. Visitors moving Ea st or W est occasionally call,
notably last year Bishop Arundale and Shrim ati Rukm ini Devi.
T.S. Outposts in the Wilderness
Greece resumed her activities by founding the Plato Lodge in 1923.
Now there are five Lodges and 700 members. They have nice head­
quarters at Athens, with a good library and useful activities. A little
deputation came to me in Paris, and gave me a coat, beautifully em­
broidered by Greek ladies.
Barbados Lodge reports a quiet yet busy year.
The Adyar Library
During the year D r. C. Kunhan R aja has filled the office of
Director. A thorough and systematic re-arrangement of the Western
Section was completed, and the same is being done in the Eastern
Section. The library has grown steadily in materials and in public
usefulness. Many valuable books have been added both by purchase and
gifts. The students of the Brahm avidva Ashrama make good use of the
library. Many additions have been made to the manuscript department.
Brahmavidya Ashrama
The Principal’s Report shows that one of the outstanding features
of the session has been a course of synthetical studies of the W ill by
18 THE GENERAL REPORT OF TH E T . S.
various memuers o£ the Ashrama, this being an attempt to carry out a
suggestion made by the Chohan K . H . to Mr. A . 0 . Hume in 1882.
Schopenhauer’s Philosophy of the W ill was presented by a German
student, Fraulein S. Leidtke. D r. Handy of the Bishop Museum,
Honolulu, gave a course of lectures which was practically an adjustment
of the principles of Ethnology to Theosophical fundamentals. Other
valuable courses are in progress, also a study group. Associated
Ashramas are being formed in other parts of the world through the
enthusiasm of members who have been at Adyar, and realised the value
of the Ashram a’s special work.
TheTheosophical World-University Association
A n Indian section of this international association was formed
early in the year, and has local groups working in all the areas of the
country. The members are kept in touch with the movement by pamph­
lets and circular letters. Thus the idea of the future W orld-U niversity
is being spread. Sections in Great B ritain , Am erica, Java, France,
Holland are also busily at work spreading ideas on the new education.
The Theosophical Educational Trust
The Trust continues its excellent work, though lack of funds
hampers its activities. The National College at A dyar continues to
grow in popularity and strength. Madanapalle has started a g irls’
hostel, and it has been decided to make the school and college entirely
residential. The Theosophical School at Allahabad reports rapid
developments, and now owns thirteen acres of land and two buildings.
The National G irls’ School at Coimbatore has been dropped owing to
lack of support, but the G irls’ School at Mangalore has been affiliated.
The Narmada En g lish School at Shukiatirth is no longer affiliated, and
the Montessori School at A dyar has been closed.
OlcottPanohama Free Bohools
W ork is carried on in these schools in a spirit of happy service,
and the inspector reports satisfactory conditions. Personal hygiene
THE PR ESID EN TIA L ADDRESS 19
receives much attention, and the A dyar Baby Welcome helps greatly in
this respect.
The Round Table
Australia reports a substantial gain in membership and much real
and consistent work. Five new centres have been established and
almost all report some increase.
Orderofthe Brothers of Servioe
This Order continues to serve various activities with its usual and
most commendable spirit of self-sacrifice. The work done by the Order
has been of incalculable value especially to education in India.
International Theoeophloal Orderof Servioe
Much progress in many countries has been made by this Order
under the enthusiastic guidance of Captain Max W ardall, and his scheme
for working the Order in the United States of Am erica should be care­
fully studied with a view to its adaptation to suit the needs of varying
conditions.
Women's Indian Aasoolatlon
The Association has now 70 Branches and 3,600 members. Good
work is being done everywhere for women and children, especially in
educational reform and in the movements for the abolition of child
marriage and the devadasi system. Most of the women now prominent
in public life, such as the Deputy President of Madras Legislative Council,
arc members of the Association. Its magazine Stri Dharma is a valuable
asset to international sisterhood as it is quoted by ex-changes abroad.
League of Parente and Teaehera
The League reports widespread and effective activities, but
like many another useful organisation reports a heavy loss on the

physical plane through the death of Sir T . Sadasivier who was its
President.
International Fellowship In Arts and Crafts
The Secretary reports an encouraging amount of activity during
the year. Numbers of small groups and centres have sprung up,
each with its own independent and often original activities, and
many members are working with and inspiring other organisations.
M r. Jinarfljadasa’s new book, Art as Will and Idea, has been of great
service to students. Reports have been received from 25 countries of
activities carried out chiefly along the lines of community singing,
dramatic art, and training in handicrafts. A n exhibition was arranged
at the Theosophical Order of Service Camp at Ommen in August. In
order to avoid overlapping it has been decided to incorporate the
Fellowship in the reorganised Theosophical Order of Service as the
nucleus of its art section.
T.S. Muslim and Association
The T . S. Muslim Association, so splendidly helped by Professor
H . C. K um ar, is at work in the vital task of drawing the two great
communities into closer accord.
Association of Hebrew Theosophists
The Association of Hebrew Theosophists is spreading Theosophy
most usefully in Judaism .
Theosophioal Sooiety Employees’Co-operative Credit Society, Adyar
This Society fills a special place in the domestic arrangements of
A dyar, and is going on satisfactorily.
Theosophioal Medloal League
This League was constituted at Ommen in August with the view to
preparing the ground for the creation of a new medical science “ touched

Theosophical movement Membership is open to all who sympathise
with the Theosophical objects, and who have a legal qualification to
practise medicine, surgery and obstetrics, or any branch of these, and to
certificated nurses and masseurs. The League has already fifteen
National Secretaries.
THE HEADQUARTERS
TREASURER’S REPORT
To the President, Theosophical Society.
The Incom e and Disbursement Account of our A dyar H eadquarters
for the year ending 31st October, 1927, shows a considerable excess of
expenditure over receipts, balanced fortunately, by the surplus carried
forw ard from the preceding year, the final result being a small debit
balance of Rs. 39-0-2. The actual figures are as follows :
Expenditure ... Rs. 78,892 15 2 = £ 6,069 at Rs. 13
per £ L.
Income ... ,, 74.020 8 7 = ,, 5,694 ,,,,
Deficit ... „ 4,872 6 7 = „375
Less Surplus from 1925-6 „ 4,833 6 5 = ,, 372
Dehit Balance to new
Account ... ,, 39 0 2 = „3
Compared with our budget for the year the expenditure has kept
fairly close to budget limits, the excess on five or six accounts being
equalized by savings on other accounts. Individual accounts do not
require special notice, with the exception, perhaps, of Construction and
Repairs Account which exceeds the amount allowed in the budget
(Rs. 20,000 = £ 1,538) by Rs. 2,995-2-3. The expenditure is made
up as follows :
Rs. 8,828 12 0 Repairs to roof and verandahs in Lead-
beater Chambers,
„ 1,373 6 0 Sanitary Installation at Besant Gardens,
„ 3,457 10 0 New Charcoal Shed and Im provem ents at
Powerhouse,
„ 4,247 9 0 A lteration to Street Lights,
„ 958 13 6 Drainage, Compound W all near Alsace
Grove, etc.,
„ 4,128 15 9 Sundry Repairs to Buildings.
Rs. 22,995 2 3 = £ 1,769.
26 T H E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T . S.
All the above have been necessary im provem ents. Further heavy
expenditure will await us in the coming year, as only one-third of the
roof of Leadbeater Chambers has been completed and the rem aining two-
thirds have now to be taken in hand.
Our statem ent of Disbursements includes three items which could
not appear in our b u d g et:
(1) Its. 1,148-8-2 ( = £ 88) Loss on “ Ihe Golden Book of the
T .S .” the cost of production having exceeded the original estim ate.
(2) Rs. 1,117-0-0 (= £ 8 6 ) Reserve for Isolation Hospital,
which is a transfer from Donations of the gift by M r. W . L. Ohiplonkar,
Akola, set aside for the above purpose.
(3) Its. 1,429-1-0 ( = £ 110) Reserve for Electrical Installation,
appropriated from the profit made by our Electrical and Engineering
D epartm ent, in order to increase the reserve for the replacem ent of the
battery and of m achinery to the round sum of Rs. 3,000.
Income
Rent and Interest Account.— O ur income of Rs. 20,395-5-2
( = £ 1.569) denotes a decrease of Rs. 1,872 com pared with the pre­
ceding year. It is due to the fact that we had a sm aller num ber of visitors
from abroad, only few of the rooms in Blavatsky Gardens and Leadbeater
Chambers having been occupied during the greater part of the year.
Garden Produce realized Its. 16,352-11-9 ( = £ 1,258), which
beats all previous records. The sale proceeds are derived from :
Cocoanuts ... ... ... Rs. 3,634 15 9
Sapotas 59 5,289 H 9
Pineapples 55 647 7 6
Firewood (Casuarinas) 99 2,575 6 3
Oranges 99 1,985 7 6
Bananas 59 351 13 0
M angoes 99 1,268 0 3
Papais u 58 11 9
Plants 59 93 0 0
Sundries ... ,,, 99 448 2 0
Rs. 16,352 11 9
t r e a s u r e r ’s r e p o r t 27
The income from Sapota trees, planted ten years ago, has again
increased by Rs. 1,006, this fruit yielding now a steady, good income.
W e also had a good Mango and Orange season, while Cocoanuts have
suffered from the failure of the monsoon last autum n and from the
continued drought throughout the summer of 1927, which has also had
a disastrous effect on our Casuarina plantations. About 2,200 trees,
among them a few fine old speimens, died and have to be cut down and
sold for firewood, leaving many a gap for which we arc sorry. The
proceeds come to about Rs. 5,000, of which am ount Rs. 2,000 were paid
in old account (part of Rs. 2,575-6-3 shewn above), while the balance
of Rs. 3,000 will benefit the year 1927-8. 1926-7 has been an
exceptional year and we cannot expect a similar result in 1927-8.
It is very satisfactory, however, that in all likelihood the income from
Garden Produce will always be in excess of the expenditure for pro­
ductive gardens, even if this excess does not amount to the record
figure of Rs. 6,648 of the present year.
The Electrical and Engineering Department Account closes with a
profit of Rs. 4,125-15-2 ( = £ 317), of which amount we have placed
Rs. 1,429-1-0 on reserve for replacem ent of battery, etc., as mentioned
above. The profit of this D epartm ent being mainly derived from
current supplied to, and work done for, the Society it really goes to
reduce the cost of lighting and of construction and repairs. Thanks to
M r. Zuurm an’s capable management this D epartm ent is able to undertake
all work in connection with building, repairs, furnishing and electricity.
Fees and Dues Account.— Rs. 23,522-11-7 ( = £ 1,809) also shows
a record figure. This am ount does not, however, refer wholly to the
year under review, but includes dues for preceding years, received
during 1926-7, as follows :
Account 1925 and 1926 ... Rs. 3,825 14 10 ( = £ 294)
„ 1927 ... ... „ 19,696 12 9 (= „ 1,515)
Rs. 23,522 11 7
About R s. 20,000 (roughly £ 1,500) may, with our present
membership, be considered our annual income from Section Dues under
the new scheme on the basis of 10°/o of the dues received by the
Sections. It is evident that this does not represent a great advance
28 T H E G EN ER A L R E PO R T O F T H E T . S.
on the form er scale of E ight Annas for each member, for with a m ember­
ship of 43,000 (the figure shewn in the R eport of 1926) the A dyar
dues would am ount to Rs. 21,500, provided each member paid his dues,
even leaving the higher scale for members attached directly to A dyar
out of consideration. In the case of most of the Sections 10%
amounts to less than E ight Annas per member ; only in a few cases is
there a slight excess, notably in the case of America, contributing
R s. 4,862-14-9 (the largest contribution) for 8,520 members. The new
scheme is certainly more equitable than the old one, especially as
affecting Sections suffering from an adverse currency, who now pay at
the rate of 10% in the currency of their own country.
Donations have brought in Rs. 9,623-12-11 ( = £ 740) as follows :
Rs. 1,117 0 0 from M r. C. W . Chiplonkar, Akola, set
aside for an Isolation Hospital, as men­
tioned above ;
99 4,537 0 0 “ A dyar D a y ” collection from American
Section,
9 9
1,906 2 9 “ A dyar Day ” ,, „ other
Sections,
99 2,063 10 2 Sundry Donations.
Rs. 9,623 12 11
W ith regard to the am ount of Rs. 4,537 from the American Section
it m ust be mentioned that the total gift sent by them for “ A dyar Day ”
amounted to Rs. 19,337 ( = £ 1,487), distributed as follows :
Rs. 5,000 to A dyar Library,
,, 4,537 ,, A dyar H eadquarters, as shewn above,
,, 4,500 ,, Theosophical Educational Trust,
,, 4,000 ,, the O rder of the Brothers of Service,
„ 1,000 ,, the O lcott Pancham a Free Schools,
„ 300 ,, the W omen’s Indian Association,
Rs. 19,337
a very great and welcome help to all these institutions.
Wo take this opportunity to express our appreciation and hearty
thanks to all who have so generously helped us with donations.
T R E A SU R E R S R EPO R T 29
Adyar Library
W e have been able to increase our Endowm ent Fund, which had
been dwindling for some years, from R s. 1,03,664-15-7 in the beginning
of the year to R s. 1,06,842-8-11 ( = £ 8,219) at its close, thanks largely
to the “ A dyar D ay ” gift of R s. 5,000 from America, as stated above.
Our Library abstract shows the following figures of income and
expenditure :
Incom e ... ... Rs. 14,941 14 6 ( = £ 1,149)
Expenditure ... „ 11,764 5 2 ( = „ 905)
Surplus Income ... Rs. 3,177 9 4
representing the increase of Endowm ent Fund.
C ontrary to expectation we have been able to tide satisfactorily
over an unpromising year. Financial difficulties, however, lie ahead of
us, for according to our budget for the coming year we require no less
than Rs. 25,000 ( = £ 1,923) in donations for the upkeep of H eadquarters
and of the A dyar Library. W e trust that our appeal for help will
evoke response, that this report and our balance-sheet will be read and
studied in order to get a clear idea of our financial position, and that
through “ A dyar Day ” and other gifts our needs will again be
provided for.

REPORTS OF THE GENERAL
SECRETARIES OF THE
NATIONAL SOCIETIES
T. S. IN AMERICA
To the President, Theosophical Society.
This year has been the most strenuous we have ever known in
Am erica. W e have been fortunate in having an increased number of
lecturers from abroad and our building program m e lias been additional
to our usual Theosophical work.
Our visitors who have made extensive lecture tours included
the President, Dr. A rundale and General Secretary M r. G ardner.
M r. K rishnam urti and M r. Rajagopal also spent several months in the
U nited States.
The coming of the President had a very m arked effect upon
membership. Several hundred persons whose membership had lapsed
applied for reinstatem ent. The net gain in membership during
the fiscal year closing June 30th was six hundred and thirty-nine
as against only one hundred and seventy.eight in the previous
fiscal year.
Our H eadquarters building at W heaton, the cornerstone of which
was laid by D r. Bcsant in August, 1926, has been completed and was
dedicated by Dr. Arundale in August, 1927. Perhaps a brief detailed
description of the building will be of general interest as it is the type of
building said to represent the last word in building construction in this
country. The m aterial is brick, stone, steel and concrete with some
wood used for doors, casings, etc. It is therefore practically fireproof.
It is designed for a combined office building and residence and special
attention was given to light and ventilation. No part of the building is
without abundant light and the direct rays of the sun enter each room.
The south wing contains the offices on the first and second floors. Two
large vaults for records and valuables were built into the south wing
and at the extrem e southern end is the library, two stories high,
extending the entire width of the building. The north wing contains
6
42 TH E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF T H E T .S .
the living apartm ents and draw ing room, while the west wing is devoted
to kitchen, dining room, garage, etc. An artesian well supplies w ater
to the building and pipes carry the w ater to all parts of the grounds to
supply abundant moisture to plants and trees in dry seasons. The
building is equipped with the latest devices for saving time and labor.
One machine softens the w ater for the laundry in the basement, whero
other machines do both the washing and the ironing. A “ Frigidaire ”
in the basement, operated by electric current, m anufactures ice in
abundance. Both the w ater and the heating systems are autom atic.
The lowering of the w ater in the pressure tank turns on the electric
current that operates the pump and the falling of the tem perature in
the building increases the flow of fuel oil under the boilers. No coal or
wood is used for fuel. Gas only is used for cooking. An intram ural
telephone system connects the offices with each other so that inform ation
needed in one office can be obtained from any other office w ithout either
party leaving his desk. Conversations may be carried on between
various offices sim ultaneously w ithout interference or confusion. For
example, the M essenger office may be consulting the book departm ent
about an advertisem ent while the Secretary-Treasurer’s office may be
asking the bookkeeper’s office for certain inform ation. Electric calls
connect each room in the living wing with the centre of the building.
The essentials kept in mind in designing the building were business
efficiency, fresh air, abundant sunshine and control of the tem perature
within the building.
During the past year we have stressed our public library work,
keeping one experienced and expert worker continuously occupied in
travelling over the country, placing free books in any public library
that would accept them and agree to keep them displayed. Unless the
library showed a co-operative spirit, or if the board of control was at
all hostile, the books were not given because experience has shown that
when those in authority are unfriendly the books are not catalogued and
are generally put out of sight in some obscure place. In the twelve
months three hundred libraries were thus supplied with Thcosophical
books.
The Theosophical Press continues to grow with the expansion of
the Society and each year the sales are an advance over the previous
year.
T . S. IN AM ERICA 43
There has been a m arked increase in the number and the interest of
the young people in Theosophy during the year. M r. R ay W . H arden,
the new head of the Round Table, who has had many years of experi­
ence in w orking with children, has taken the field with excellent results
and we are looking forw ard to a year of considerable Theosophical
grow th among the young people.
In general, Am erica has never had a more active and interesting
year of Theosophical life and with the President and M r. K rishnam urti
coming for the S tar Camp in M ay and, we hope, for our Annual
Convention, there can be no doubt of the continued high tide of spiritual
upliftm ent and the consequent beneficent reaction in the growing
strength and influence of the Theosophical Society in America.
L. W . R o g e r s ,
General Secretary.

Your Visit.— During the year we have had the inestimable privilege
of your presence among us for several months, and have also been
favoured by visits from the "Vice-President and M rs. Jinar&jadasa,
M r. K rishnam urti, Bishop and Mrs. Arundale, and Bishop W edgwood.
Your own four lectures in the Queen’s H all on “ The New Civilisation ”
drew large and attentive audiences, and as they have since been printed
in book form it is hoped they will reach a wide public. W e are
indebted also to M r. Jinar&jad&sa for his three lectures on the Divine
Vision given in the Queen’s H all in M ay, an experim ent which proved
a very great success. The Y ice-President has certainly established
himself in the hearts of the British public who are accustomed to attend
Theosophical lectures in the Queen’s H all. D uring the year we also
T . S. IN EN G LA N D 45
had the pleasure of having with us M r. A ria, the Recording Secretary
of the T.S., whose visit to this country, his first, I believe, has left a
very happy memory.
My American Tour.— A long standing promise was fulfilled this
year when at the invitation of the American Section I visited the U .S.A .
and carried out a lecturing tour in that vast country. It was a great
pleasure to me to meet so many of our Am erican members and I brought
back w ith me many happy recollections of their kindness personally and
of the earnest desire of the American members that their Section should
take its rightful place in the Theosophical fam ily.
The Annual Convention for 1927, held June 5th, 6th, 7th, at the
Queen’s H all, London, over which you presided, will be remembered
for its happy atm osphere and stim ulating helpfulness. W ith us also
were M r. K rishnam urti, Bishop W edgwood, D r. and M rs. A rundale,
and many other distinguished visitors from abroad. Most unfortunately
M r. Jinariljadasa was detained by illness in H arrogate.
Dr. van der Leeuw gave the opening lecture on The Mystic and
the Occultist and spoke with clarity, wide vision, and from obviously
profound experience. He brought us nearer to the world of reality
than is usually possible by lecturing alone. In the afternoon the
representatives of other countries rose at roll-call to give and acknow­
ledge greetings, and you spoke on the duties of tolerance and good-will
amongst members. Professor M arcault gave the Blavatsky Lecture, a
contribution to the psychology of the Intuition which all those
interested in the subject would be wise to read and consider carefully,
as it covers a wide field and represents the view of the intuition which
is being emphasized in the Theosophical W orld U niversity work. It
may be of interest to record here that Bishop W edgwood’s Blavatsky
Lecture of 1926, on The Distinctive Contribution of Theosophy to
Christian r
lbought, has been very widely distributed, among tho copies
sent out 500 having gone especially to clergym en and ministers of
religion in this country. On the Saturday evening there was Commu­
nity Singing and an invigorating greeting from D r. Arundale, who arrived
that day from A ustralia. Sunday was given over to allied activities,
and your first Queen’s H all lecture entitled The New Civilisation.
On M onday m orning the large hall of the British Medical Association
was overcrowded and, in addition, an overflow meeting in another hall
46 TH E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF T H E T .S.
near by listened by loud speaker to two of the addresses given. You
then explained that the Fellowship of Faiths was an extension of the
first object of the Society, as the W orld U niversity was an extension of
the second, and the M ysteries of the third. The Fellowship is no new
religion, but an expansion of consciousness in religious thought, the
recognition of the One Life worshipped under various forms. Bishop
W edgwood mentioned various ways by which we could prepare for
the restoration of the M ysteries, through ritual work in the Liberal
Catholic Church arid Co-M asonry, and by the conscious training and
deliberate use of our own astral and m ental faculties, so that co­
operation with the work of the Dcvas m ight become possible. Professor
M arcault spoke of the M ysteries of Knowledge, and the need for us
to train the intuitive faculty in order to make ready for the study of
the “ science of liberation,” which he considered to be the basic science
of the W orld U niversity.
A Garden P arty at W est'Side House, W imbledon, so friendly and
hospitable that even a shower could not spoil our pleasure, filled the
afternoon.
The closing meeting on M onday, after a charm ing program m e
arranged through the A rts League of Service, was addressed by
M r. K rishnam urti, who spoke with characteristic dignified sim plicity on
the search for the Ileal, the search for Happiness. D r. Arundale, with
his incomparable forcefulness in no way abated, stirred his audience to
a fuller appreciation of the vital needs of the moment, and you concluded
with a magnificent appeal to Theosophists to go out into the world and
remould it so that the G reat Plan of the E lder Brothers should be more
nearly realised on earth.
In one m eeting after another the wider vision of life had been
emphasised, and your final appeal to make the Unseen, and yet the
Real, more evident in daily life sent those of our members who were
fortunate enough to be present back to their Lodges, filled with some
of the “ burning earnestness ” of our leaders.
Theosophy in Europe.— The following M otion was subm itted to the
Convention during its business session on June 4th, 1927, by
Bishop W edgwood :
That this Convention of the Theosophical Society in England,
believing that in the shaping of a new Social Order the Theosophical
T. S. IN EN GLA ND 47
teachings are of param ount im portance, strongly urges upon the
European Federation of Theosophical Societies the desirability of hold­
ing a Theosophical Congress annually, or biennially (as provided
form erly in the Federation Rules) in a different European country.
It is satisfactory to know that the M otion has been adopted by the
Council of the European Federation, T .S., who have decided to hold a
Congress of the Society annually in one or other of the European
countries.
Theosophical News Bureau.— H aving proved its usefulness by its
twelve-m onths’ work during one of the busiest years this National
Society has known for some time, an office of the Bureau has been
opened in Paris, through which the Secretary who now resides in
France, will he concerned more particularly with the Continental Press.
The w ork of the Bureau in England will bo carried on as part of the
adm inistrative work of the N ational H eadquarters.
Manchester Lodge.— The M anchester Lodge began a new era of
activity in that great city by entering into possession of their tine and
commodious Lodge premises known as Ward Hall, Victoria Park, on
July 5th, 1927, when you dedicated the Lodge Rooms and addressed a
large meeting of members. The Lodge is indeed to be congratulated on
securing such a rem arkably fine property. The number of Lodges that
own their Rooms, usually in conjunction with a residential house and
garden, is constantly increasing. The value to the efficiency of all the
local Theosophical activities is inestimable and the spirit of helpfulness
and brotherhood is warmly fostered in the Lodge that has its own home
centre and from which to w ork.
Drama.— M any of our members have felt that, with the beginning
of the Society’s second half-century, the time has come for some special­
isation within the Lodges, which, up to the present have necessarily
been concentrating on propaganda and study. Such a step towards
group-w ork on special lines has been taken by the Baysw atcr (London)
Lodge which has form ed itself into an A rt Group for the purpose of
drawing together those members who are artists or art-lovers and of
creating facilities for art-expression within the Society and of stim ulat­
ing and encouraging the presentation of Truth us Beauty. The Lodge
also endeavours to link up and establish friendly relations with existing
A rt Societies, which it is hoped will prove helpful in increasing the
48 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T .S.
.sympathetic recognition of Theosophy. A lready a number of interesting
perform ances have been given under the auspices of this Lodge, and it
is proposed that they be continued throughout the coming w inter in the
M ortim er H all, where the portable stage has been transferred from the
U pper H all and fixed perm anently, w ith suitable lighting equipm ent, in
the Lower H all.
The Work of Members.— I cannot allow the opportunity, offered
by this R eport, to, pass without expressing appreciation of the steady
work done week after week by Lodges, Centres, and many of our
members individually. The success of the Society in this country, in
the ultim ate, depends upon the individual member who, by his study of
the truths of Theosophy, and his attem pt to live them, becomes a centre
of spiritual help to his fellows in the Society and in the outer world.
It would be easy to cite many instances of the working of this spirit of
helpfulness and brotherhood among our members during the year. The
results are chronicled, necessarily baldly, month after month, in our
“ News and Notes ” : healthy Centres formed in parts of the country
where the word Theosophy had never before been heard ; quiet Centres
bursting forth as flourishing Lodges through the self-sacrifice and
devotion of a few energetic members. One individual effort in particular
I would recall to your memory, the scheme set on foot by one generous
and thoughtful member whereby an increasing number of the more
advanced Theosophical books are placed in the hands of people who, in
some cases, could not have afforded to buy them, and in others, have
vainly sought for miyiy years just the enlightenm ent shed by that
special book. Everyw here such gifts have met with real «appreciation.
National Lecturers.— D uring the past year nearly a hundred special
courses of lectures, varying from a few days to several weeks, have been
delivered in connection with the work of Lodges and Centres. Such
courses, each carried on for a definite period, have been found of great
value wherever held.
Mortimer Halls.— On Sunday evenings throughout the year,
Theosophical lectures are given and are well attended.
Literature.— The following new booklets have been published (at
nine-pence per dozen) during the year : The Path to Happiness;
Theosophy and Christianity, by Annie Besant, D.L. ; Theosophy and the
Coming Race.
T. S. IN EN G LA N D 49
Orange posters for announcing Lodge Lectures are now greatly in
demand all over the country and are proving an effective method «£
advertising. Sizes of posters vary from lOin. X 8in. to 30in.X 20in. This
year we have also used a thousand very large orange posters dealing, the
one with Reincarnation and the other with Theosophy, which, wherever
displayed by Lodges, create great interest.
Fifty-tw o book-boxes are in use in Lodges and Centres. Each box
contains approxim ately thirty-five of the best known books dealing with
Theosophy, and is useful as providing the nucleus of the Lodge Library.
The demand for fortnightly booklets is greatly on the increase ;
in- six months nearly five thousand have been dispatched to enquirers in
response to about seven hundred applications. A point of interest is
that m any pass on their booklets to friends and further names follow,
'In one instance a single booklet w ent the round of twelve people,
tStudents’ Week Ends were held in the South, during E aster
week at Paignton, in D evonshire; in the N orth at K iplin H all
(Y orkshire) during Septem ber ; in the M idlands at Crich during May ;
in London at the Theosophical W orld U niversity Centre during the
Christm as week-end, and also during the week following the National
Society’s Convention in June.
These are greatly appreciated by all those attending and the
numbers have varied from fifty and upwards. The attractive features
of several has been that all are together as a house party for some days
and the delightful and harmonious spirit prevailing has been very m arked.
Among the lecturers visiting the gatherings were yourself, D r.
Arundale, Professor M arcault, M r. Jam es Scott, Miss Charlotte Woods,
Miss Clara Codd, M rs. Stevenson Howell, M ajor C. F. J. Galloway,
myself and M rs. G ardner, and members of the Science Group and other
organisations.
Special Lectures were given in the Queen’s H all, five being
given by yourself in June and October, and three by the V ice-President
in May. W e had also the privilege of three lectures from D r. van der
Leeuw on The Conquest of Illusion, given this month in the M ortim er
H alls.
You were also good enough to visit Leeds, Bradford, M anchester,
Liverpool, Nottingham and Bristol, and the V ice-President visited
Sheffield, Liverpool, M anchester, Bath, Birmingham, and H arrogate.

T. S. IN INDIA
The outstanding feature of the year ending 30th Septem ber has
been a spirit of alertness among our members. A lthough our Lodges
have, not yet overcome many of their difficulties, there is, generally
speaking, a cheerful and optim istic tone throughout the Society in India.
W e feel that we are receiving a new life, that we are going forward
and are ¿jetting ready for more strenuous work.
n n c,
A lthough the increasing communal tension has unfortunately
engrossed most of the attention of our people at present, it is at the
same time driving the serious-minded amongst us to find out a solution
of the troubles which are threatening to grow into a serious deadlock.
The better mind of the country is anxious to bring about peace and
goodwill between Hindus and M usalmans and is slowly beginning to
appreciate the practical advantages of the proper Theosophical attitude
tow ards different religions and our characteristic spirit of tolerance.
The T. S. Muslim League organised by the V ice-President in 1924
is awaiting the touch of a new and more vigorous life, though it has
not been quite inactive. Some of its members have been constantly
lecturing on Islam and have been placing the results of their Islam ic
studies before the public through the Section M agazine and other
Theosophical journals. Its membership needs the addition of much
further strength and we are hoping to enlist the sym pathy of a larger
number of non-Theosophist M usalmans to make it more serviceable at
the present juncture.
Membership.— Our membership in the main body stands at 5,536 as
against 5,029 last year. Among the A ll-India Federation of Young
Theosophists, however, there is a sudden drop from 1722 to 680.
Perhaps the chief reason for this large decrease is— as hinted by the
Secretary in his report for the previous year— that a system of
T o th e P r e s i d e n t , T h e o s o p h i c a l S o c i e t y .
52 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T. S.
Provincial organisations which will more effectively control Provincial
areas and m aintain a close relationship with the H eadquarters has not
yet developed. In the main branch o£ the Indian Section, however,
there is a very satisfactory increase of 507, although when we include
the num ber of Young Theosopliists our total membership comes down to
6,216 against 6,751 shown last year. The num ber of new admissions in
the main body is 809 against 618 in 1926 and in the Y outh Federation
299 as against 91. Our losses due to resignations come to 26 as against
44 last year and the toll of “ dorm ant members ” is only 210 as against
468 in the previous year.
Lodges and Centres.— The num ber of Lodges is 329 as against 334
last year. This seeming decrease of five is really due to the fact that
seven Lodges have been transferred during the year to the newly formed
National Society in Ceylon. Our Centres are also reduced from 30 to
25 this year.
Federations and Lodges.— The number of “ autonom ous” Feder­
ations rem ains the same as last year. The various Federations into
which the Indian Section has been sub-divided are showing signs of
better organisations and greater activity. As w ith the Indian Section
so with the Federations the paucity of funds greatly hampers the
efficiency of work, but judging from the increasing interest which our
members now take in our common work it is expected that the much-
needed financial support will be more readily and ungrudgingly given in
future. In South India there is a growing tendency in favour of
strengthening the Federations by am algam ating the sm aller areas
together. Some Federations are trying to increase the activities of
their Lodges in vigour and depth. There are happily a few strong and
wcll-conducted Lodges in every Federation area which are setting
an example to weaker Centres in establishing a deeper understanding
o f our teachings by encouraging serious study along with efforts in
the direction of public propaganda. There is also a growing tendency
among the Lodges to have a perm anent building of their own.
Field Work.— For the success of our work in this vast country
and for the proper understanding of the message of Theosophy, it is
essential that we should have a very much larger num ber of efficient
lecturers both in English and the different Indian Y ernaculars. That
has been the weakest point in our organisation for a large number of
T .S . IN IN D IA 53
years. In the South our veteran Joint General Secretary, B rother
T. Ram achandra Rao, with his lieutenants has, as usual, done solid work-
in the N orth Mrs. Huidekopcr and Brothers B. Sanjiva Rao,
H . C. K um ar, H arjivan K . M ehta and Panda Baijnath have been
extrem ely helpful in this direction.
The Section is much indebted to B rother Abdul K arim who kindly
made a long lecturing tour in N orth India. His thoughtful presentation
of Islam in the light of Theosophy was highly appreciated by his
audiences. We need many more M usalman friends like him to help us in
interpreting the beauties of the great Islam ic faith to the Indian public.
Our Ex-G eneral Secretary, the late Sir T. Sadasivier, whose
recent death has caused a trem endous loss to our Section, was almost
always touring in South India. He carried conviction to the hearts of
the people by his wide scholarship and deep earnestness, and by his
great devotion and high character. May the Peace of the Eternal
abide w ith him.
Publicity ami Propaganda.— Lack of necessary funds has also stood
in the wav of a wider publicity and a good supply of propaganda
literature which is so essential for placing before the people Theosophical
truths and the practical solution they afford of the many problems
troubling us in India. A t the last Pair at H ardw ar an attem pt was
made to approach the large number of Hindu Pilgrim s that had gather­
ed there and it is hoped that such experiments will also be tried in
future at several other im portant Centres of pilgrim age in India. Most
of our Federations are publishing their own M agazines in their respective
V ernaculars and by this means the message of Theosophy is being
carried to those who do not know English.
The Sectional M agazine, Theosophy in India, has been very much
improved and, we are given to understand, is being more and more
appreciated.
The Indian Book Shop.— The Bookshop which is the handsome gift
of the President to the Indian Section, has under the capable manage­
m ent of M r. Vcnugopal shown a certain amount of profit, although
since the change of its character from a branch of the T .P.H . at A dyar
it has had to contend against serious difficulties. There is a large stock
of pam phlets that we are selling at very much reduced prices in order
to encourage the Lodges in freely distributing them among the public.
54 T H E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T. S.
Our Educational Work is winning greater and greater recognition
and is increasing in efficiency as our w orkers are gaining more experience.
W hat is more, its influence is spreading among other institutions as they
are gradually introducing our methods regarding the treatm ent
of children.
The Womens Movement is progressing every year under the
auspices of our Indian W om en’s Association, and there is a considerable
accession of strength to the T. S. in India as our ladies are sharing with
men the great inspiration of Theosophy. The presence of our energetic
Joint Secretary, Mrs. B. Padm abai Rao, as one of the Chief Executive
Officers of our Section is a sure guarantee of the lead which Indian
women will soon give us in the Theosophical Society in India. To her
I owe a deep debt of gratitude for the advice and help she has always
un-grudgingly given me.
It is for the first time that throughout the whole of the year under
report our Section was deprived of the inestimable privilege of your
presence in this country which is so dear to your heart and for which
you have so tirelessly worked and mean to continue to work. The
absence of our beloved K rishnaji and our respected V ice-President and
of other leaders from the country has also been very keenly felt. B ut
I trust, dear President, your children in India have, on the whole,
done fairly well to deserve your confidence and the blessings of the
G reat Brotherhood whose service is the highest ambition of the members
of the Theosophical Society.
I q b a l N. G u r t it ,
General Secretary.
T.S. IN AUSTRALIA
To the President, Theosophical Society.
I have the honour to send you the following report of the
A ustralian Section of the Theosophical Society for the year ended
30th Septem ber, 1927.
Statistics.— The total membership for the A ustralian Section for
the year under report is 1,562. 177 new members were adm itted, but
on the other hand 204 were lost to us by death, resignation and lapsed
subscriptions. The number lost during the year is high, but Lodges
have for years been carrying many inactive members who have been
deleted from the roll since our dues have been increased. Though we
cannot claim the high number form erly reported these members are
mainly active and we carry little dead wood.
The Thirty-second Annual Convention was held in Sydney at Easter
and never before has this Section had such a rem arkable gathering
which planned so purposefully and well the campaign of work to be
done in the service of the M asters. W ith Bishop A rundale in the Chair
and Bishop Leadbeater ever ready to offer his wise counsel, all delegates
were welded into a united body each intent on using his best judgm ent
in the cause of Theosophy. Large issues were put before the Conven­
tion and im portant decisions made, chief of which was the adoption of
the Active Service Fund. Bishop Leadbeater’s talks all urged the
necessity for a virile patriotic spirit, and the General Secretary outlined
a striking policy for Australia, including a plea for government by the
wise and a larger all-A ustralian outlook.
A new feature of the Convention was the answering from many
different points of view of a pithy Questionnaire covering a number of
debatable Theosophical conceptions, an instructive and humorous
proceeding.
Section Officers.— W e rejoiced exceedingly that we had the
opportunity of re-electing Bishop A rundale as General Secretary.
56 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T .S .
The Revs. Byron Casselberry and Harold Morton were elected Joint
Assistant General Secretaries, the position of the former being taken
later by Miss Muriel Beaufoy and still later by Mr. Henry Frei,
late General Secretary of the Ceylon Section. Mr. Houstone and
Mrs. A. E. Dempster were elected respectively as Treasurer and
Assistant Treasurer, and Miss M. K. Neff was re-elected as National
Lecturer.
Finances.—The Active Service Fund inaugurated by the foresight
of the General Secretary is worthy of detailed report. This Section
decided on a large programme of public work, and in order to finance,
its activities Bishop Arundale made an arresting appeal to members to
subscribe 1,000 half-crowns per week, calling those who responded
“ the Happy Thousand ”. The amount thus derived from this source
during this year is being apportioned as follows :
£
Theosophical Broadcasting Station
cW
2,600
“ 80 Years Young Fund” . . . L300
Section (including magazines) ... ... 1,200
Star ... 1,000
.£ 6,100
While a regular income of 1,000 half-crowns weekly is a splendid
achievement, it is doubly appreciated because it is the donation of the
many and not of the few, a fact which keeps tho united spirit of the
Convention prominently before all. Tho inclusion of tho Order of the
Star is only for the convenience of members who belong to both or­
ganisations so that there may be only one appeal for funds. To carry
on this fund each year will enable us continually to enlarge our scope
of work, and the sacrifices made by members for this common purpose
aid the team spirit so vital to our work.
The Theosophical Broadcasting Station.__2G.B. has a splendid
record of work and is now entering on a still greater career. Standing
always for noble citizenship, culture, right education and brotherhood
it has fought down the ignorant prejudice against Theosophy, and the
Society is being recognised and more respected for its practical and
disinterested idoalism. A large public is boing reached, for besides the
T .S . IN A U STRA LIA 57
broadcasting of Tkeosophical and Star lectures, Anglican and other
Churches arc co-operating, and, which is of great importance to the
Commonwealth, a refined and cultured programme is broadcast espe­
cially for the children. Special efforts have been made by the manager,
Mr. A. E. Bennett, to keep the music at a high level so that the public
can always rely on having a first class musical programme from 2G. B.
Committees in each capital are drawing up plans for the establish­
ment at a later date of relay Stations to be erected when finances
permit.
Lodge Activities.—In Sydney we have had the aid of the Rt. Rev.
Gr. S. Arundale, Professor and Mrs. Wood, Dr. J. J. van der Leeuw and
Dr. P. K. Roest for series of public lectures. Twice during the year
Bishop Leadbeater himself spoke in the Adyar Hall, on White Lotus
Day about Madame Blavatsky and on the President’s Birthday about
Dr. Besant. These talks were all broadcast and the following extract
from the public press is worthy of report :
Slow, very distinct, grammatically perject and with wonderful
pronunciation, 1 cannot help Jeeling that here is a voice that
should he heard more often. What a pleasure it would he if
all the voices were like Bishop Leadheaters. The first person
that goes over with a voice like that is going to he famous in
radio realms.
Lodges.— Charters have been issued for three new Lodges, Kew,
Babinda, and Manly. A new Centre has been formed at Canberra,
the Federal Capital of Australia, which promises to be an im­
portant influence in the future, and another in the Dawson Valley,
Queensland.
It is unnecessary to report individually on the work of each Lodge.
We are as a Section carrying out big plans for the whole of Australia
and the strength of the Section is in the support which all parts give to
the greater plan.
National Lecturers.— Miss Neff has since Convention travelled
extensively over the vast spaces of Australia and broken much new
ground. Unfortunately the strain of constant lecturing has been too
severe and she has been forced to resign the office of National Lecturer.
This is a great loss to Australia, but our loss will mean some other
Section’s gain, for she is always a tireless worker.
58 TH E GEN ERA L REPO RT OF T H E T . S.
Mrs. Mason-Beatty has done valuable work in Queensland ; as a
well-known member of many public organizations she carries the
message of Theosophy to large numbers who would otherwise not be
contacted.
World Federation of Young Theosophists.— Miss Glare Tracey has
organized the work of the young Theosophists and co-operated always
with the Round Table. These two movements have done excellent
work for the youth of Australia.
Particularly are we glad to see the way in which adult members
are resigning their posts in favour of the young people in order that,
they may bo free for larger and more strenuous duties on behalf of the
Section.
Publicity.—Each month Advance ! Australia and The Australian
Theosophist are published ; the former devotes itself “ without fear or
favour ” to the interests of Australia, and the latter is more particularly
for members. The circulation of these magazines is 2,500 and 1,150
respectively. Seven numbers of The Australia-India League Bulletin
were printed until the appearance of the New India Weekly. One
thousand copies were printed. The Bulletin was posted to all State and
Federal legislators in the Commonwealth and undoubtedly created a
sentiment in favour of India and the Home Rule movement.
No pamphlets have been printed this year as our interests have
centred principally upon Advance ! Australia.
D r. Mary Rocke.— Wo desire to put on record our appreciation
of the splendid work done by the late Dr. Mary Rocke in the service
of the Masters. Having resided in Sydney for a number of years she
earned the love and respect of all who worked for her.
The R t. Rev. C. W. Leadbeater.—Australia has again been
honoured with the presence of Bishop Leadbeater. The great master­
pieces of his labour are the young people who com© to him for training
and leave him later as efficient and devoted workers in the Masters’
cause. Such a group is now gathered at Ihe Manor and they are an
example to us of the unity which Their workers endeavour to maintain.
May Australia prove itself worthy of his presence.
In conclusion I would say that this year has been one of
consolidation. Bold ventures were inaugurated last year and thin
year they have been established on stable foundations. Much public
T .S. IN A U STRA LIA 59
work has been done but of greater value than all this is the deter­
mination to work according to the Masters’ plans for the uplift of the
Commonwealth.
On behalf of this Section I have the honour to lay at your feet the
uttermost love and loyalty of your many obedient servants.
H a r o l d M o r t o n ,
Acting General Secretary.
T. S. IN SWEDEN
I have much pleasure in forwarding you my report of the activities
of the Swedish Section for the year ending October 31st 1927.
Statistics.— During the year 37 new members have been admitted.
Our Section has now a total membership of 1,094 and 43 Lodges. Our
magazine, Teosofisk lid skrift, is published in 10 numbers a year with
36 pages in each issue. The members receive it free of charge.
Annual Convention.— Dr. Annie Besant, our venerable President,
presided at our Convention held during August at her Scandinavian
tour. It was a great event for all of us and I need not montion
that her visit was a big success.
The General Secretary was unanimously re-elected for another year.
Lodges.—The membership is not very large but we have compa­
ratively many Lodges scattered all over our big country. The Lodges
are joined together in districts for inner work and propaganda.
Literature.—Our Theosophical Bookshop, “ Studio,” is doing
very good work. It is run on a broad and tolerant basis supplying
the public with books on idealistic subjects.
Propaganda.—The regular propaganda with public lectures has
been going on as usual.
This report carries with it sincere and heartfelt love and gratitude
to our deeply beloved President.

T. S. IN NEW ZEALAND
I have the honour and pleasure of submitting to yon a brief
Report of the Activities of the New Zealand Section for the year
ending 31st October, 1927.
Statistics.—New members 71, re-joined 8, transferred from other
Sections 1, resigned 14, passed away 5, lapsed 112, transferred to other
Sections 7, number of members on the register 1,198, active members
972, and active Lodges 19.
Annual Convention.—The Thirty-first Annual Convention was held
in Christchurch in the now Hall of the local Lodge on the 29th and
30th December, 1920. The lit. Rev. J. R. Thomson, President of the
H. P. 13. Lodge, was elected to the Chair, and gave the Opening
Address. The success of the Convention was due not only to the
friendly co-operation of visiting members from all parts of the
Dominion, but largely to the inspiration and help derived from the
presence of Professor and Mrs. Ernest Wood, the Rev. Edward
Branscombe and the Rev. Lawrence Burt—all from Australia. At this
Convention, the method of voting was slightly amended, and the Annual
Dues were raised by unanimous consent from 7/6 to 10/-
Puhlicity.— Theosophy in New Zealand continues to be a useful
means of propaganda.It is sent free to members, andthere is a long
list of exchanges. It is pleasing to note that there is a slight increase
in the number of subscribers.
Miss Selene Oppenheimer visited many of the Lodges in the North
and South Islands, and did excellent work on the lecture platform
shortly before her departure for England early in the month of July.
As National Lecturer, I have already visited seventeen of the
Lodges, and find that all is going well. Many of the country Lodges,
although small in numbers, are strong in devotion and enthusiasm.

Vasanta Farm .—This farm, consisting of 114 acres, was donated to
the Society sixteen years ago, and during that time it has been success­
fully worked by its present manager, Mr. Colin Macdonald. A
bungalow on the farm has been partly furnished, and is let to members
who are in need of a holiday.
Vasanta School.—This garden school, situated amidst beautiful
surroundings, and with a new open-air school-room, is making excellent
progress under the care of its Principal, Miss M. Faram and her
Assistant, Miss E. Brooke-Smith. Miss Faram is a friend and co­
worker of Miss Darroch who was in charge of the School at the time
of my last report, but was obliged to relinquish her post owing to
continued ill-health- The attendance at the School is now 34, as
against 27 last year.
Kindred Movements.—The various organisations associated with the
T.S. are all working together in perfect harmony under Leaders
who recognise that each movement has its part to play in the Great
Plan, and is necessary to the perfection of the whole.
W ith loyal and affectionate greetings from the members in
Zew Zealand.
W. C r a w f o r d ,
General Secretary.
T. S. IN THE NETHERLANDS
To the President, r
Theosophical Society.
Miss Dykgraaf, our former General Secretary, in handing over
her function to me on September 19th, left me in charge of the Annual
Report of our Section October 1st, 1926— September, 30th 1927.
In drafting it I have felt that I could hardly make an adequate
statement on the general condition of our Section. Especially after
having started on my visits to the Lodges and Centres I have found
that it is only by getting personally into touch with our members all
over the country, that I shall be able to know what the general attitude
of mind is.
With regard to the life-side of our Section I cannot therefore give
you any valuable information.
I can only give you facts as follows :
Lodges and Centres.—Three more Lodges and three new Centres
were formed during the year.
The Federations of Lodges at the Hague, Amsterdam and “ het
Gooi ” have continued their co-operation for special purposes, the Lodges
themselves however keep full autonomy and each of them works in its
own area; a Federation of Lodges and Centres was newly formed at
Rotterdam.
We have now 46 Lodges and 22 Centres.
Membership.— We lost 234 members during the year : 20 deceased ;
29 were transferred to other Sections ; 36 were cancelled after repeated
attempts to get some kind of response to our various appeals;
149 resigned, most of them because they disagreed with the policy
of our leaders especially with regard to the Statement, very likely
owing to misunderstanding. I shall make evory attempt to clear up
whatever miscomprehension existing on the subject. This seems the
64 TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF TH E T. S.
more urgent as many of those who resigned were among our best and
oldest members, and while I feel that we have to respect their point of
view as soon as it is based on honest conviction, yet it seems important
to try and keep their co-operation for our Section.
Owing to this loss of 234 we can only state an increase of 77
although 311 new members joined our ranks.
On September 30th, 1927, the total number was 2,832.
Change of Constitution.— As a consequence of the International
changes of constitution we had to adapt ours to the new conditions. We
succeeded in doing so but as change of name would have involved too
many legal and other difficulties we had to stick to our old name : T.S.,
Section of the Netherlands.
One important improvement with regard to the work of the General
Secretary is the appointment of an Assistant Secretary who takes
charge of the organising part of the work. 1 may add to this that we
have been fortunate in finding one of our very efficient and devoted
young co-workers willing to fill this place.
Our book-year will henceforth run from January 1st to December
31st.
Convention.— We had the great privilege of having both our
President, Dr. Besant and our Vice-President, Mr. Jinarajadasa, as
guests of our Convention. Dr. Besant’s address to members, her
public lecture on “ The New Civilization ” as well as Mr. Jinarajadasa’s
interesting talks in answer to various questions were highly appreciated.
We all felt what an exceptional occasion this was and in our hearts
lived the fervent wish that for many a year to come the splendid co­
operation between President and Vice-President may continue and be the
inspiring and guiding force in our Society.
I am sure for most of us the one shadow that lay over this
Convention was the fact that it was the last at which Miss Dykgraaf
was among us in her function as General Secretary. We owe her
our heartfelt gratitude for her devoted and effective work during
nine years.
New Headquarters.—The plans for our new Headquarters have
now reached such stage that it is possible in co-operation with the
P. C. Meuleman Foundation to start on the building in the immediate
future.
T. S. IN TH E N ETH ER LA N D S 65
The new building will arise by the side of our new E.S. Hall ; it
will consist of three parts : one for the Secretariat and the Library,
one - for the Theosophical Bookshop and one for the National Council
who will share its localities with the Amsterdam Lodge. We hope that
within ten months our new quarters will be ready for us.
Many are the financial sacrifices that our members have made to
get us so far, many more will have to be asked from them. We are
however convinced that our appeal will not be in vain.
Propaganda.—Our propaganda department has continually to face
the difficulty lying in the small number of speakers who are able to give
sufficient time to this work. We shall have to lind ways by which this
situation may be improved. We may safely say however that the
interest in Theosophy in our country is constantly growing. And no
wonder ! We are so highly privileged in having within our frontiers
two powerful spiritual centres of an international character, that we
cannot but expect such influence to permeate the whole of our little
country.
Library.—The Library is showing a constant growth ; it is looking
forward to its new quarters where extension of its activities will be
possible.
Publishing House.—Our Publishing House is doing efficient work
and is steadily developing.
Order of Service.—The Order of ¡Service is doing very efficient
work outside as well as inside our Section. Its area has extended itself
by the formation of local groups which are forming links with all sorts
of social work.
The Order took a large share in preparing the Congress of the
International Order of Service last August and was greatly helped by a
donation of grounds extending over 20,000 square metres for the
purpose of holding all sorts of camps. Large groups of young people
have been camping there during summer.
Young Theosophists.—The Young Theosophists have now formed 11
local Groups whose loaders work in close mutual contact.
A Central Office was formed in Utrecht, a kind of clearing-house
for national as well as international work.
Three lines of activities arc followed: Meditation, Study and
Action and we may say that the work is in serious and reliable hands.
66 TH E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF T H E T . S.
I have now been in office for almost three weeks—too short a time
to judge whether I shall be able to do the work as it ought to be done,
but long enough to know that I love it and can devote myself to it with
all my heart. I can only hope I shall be found worthy of it.
C . R a m o n d t - H i r s c h m a n n ,
General Secretary.
T. S. IN FRANCE
.To the President, Theosophical Society.
I respectfully beg to submit a report of the activities of the French
Section for the year 1926— 1927.
During that period eight Lodges have been established : Krishnaji
in Esch sur Alzette, L Aurore Guyannaise, in Cayenne, Socrate in
Paris, Bonheur in Toulouse, Unite in Nogent Lc Perreux, Agama in
Royan, Sagesse in The Havre, Evolution in Moycuvre la Grande.
On the other part three Lodges have become dormant : Krishnamurti
in Paris, Hypatie in Paris, Caritas in Le Havre.
During the year 420 members have been admitted, but 222 have
died, been transferred, have resigned or were dropped, thus making the
nett gain 198. The number of our active members stands at 3,456.
The Theosophical work has progressed normally in our Section
during the year 1926-1927, and has not been hampered by a long
absence of the General Secretary—lasting from 28th of November, 1926
to 20th February, 1927— thanks to the devotion of the Headquarter’s
Office staff and the good care of the Assistant General Secretary,
Mr. Point.
The slight excitement which arose after the Star Congress in 1926
had no evil consequences and was even useful in strengthening the
complete harmony existing in the French Section of the T.S.
Madlle. Crfcile Bayer undertook in February and March, 1927,
a long tour, in order to visit our Lodges. Her presence, together with
the confidence—inspiring quality of her speeches and lectures, of which
she delivered quite a number, have had the best results and won her the
sympathy of all.
During the month of March and again in June, the General
Secretary proceeded to Spain to fulfil a task apportioned by
6 8 THE G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF TH E T. S.
our President, and had the opportunity of drawing closer the ties
of Brotherhood which link so closely the members of the two
Sections.
Our National Convention was this year postponed to the 3rd
Sunday of April in consequence of the arrival in Franco of our dear
Vice-President, Mr. Jinarajadasa, who remained a week in Paris—from
the 22nd to the 28th of April—and presided the Convention meetings
with great authority and perfect tactfulness. This Convention was
rendered particularly attractive by the rare quality of the speeches and
lectures, and the large number of M. T. S. who attended it, some coming
from the farthest end of the country. I consider as specially worthy of
praise the opening and closing speeches of Mr. Jinarajadasa, in which
were embodied some very important pieces of advice. Mr. Marcault
had come from England to give his assistance as lecturer and translator,
in both of which capacities he showed his mastery. A lecture given by
Madame David Neel brought before our public a very interesting sketch
of her last stay in Tibet.
Two of our members, Madame Canudo and Mr. du Mas have this
winter done very good pioneer work in Iioyan, and have, before their
departure from that town, laid the basis for the foundation of a new
Lodge there, the name of which appears in the above list.
A bookbinding workshop has been established in the basement of
our Headquarters and is chiefly busy with the binding of the books of
our lending library. It is run by volunteers, all M. T. S. and has
proved highly efficient and useful, as the excessive prices now charged
by the professional bookbinders would not allow our Library to make
both ends meet.
An Association for the Thcosophical University has also been
founded. It is under the leadership of our Brother Monod Herzen and
the high authority of Mr. Marcault,
I cannot close this report without praising once more the work of
our Publishing Department—styled La Famille Thiosophique and Les
Editions Adyar—so efficiently managed by our Mr. Bondonneau. Quite
a number of books have been published this year, of which the appended
list gives a summary. In addition several books have been reprinted.
The turn over reaches a high figure and the sales are in steady increase.
These favourable results are so much more interesting for us that the
T .S . IN FR A N CE
propaganda through books is by far the best means at our disposal to
bring our teachings before the educated public.
W e look forward with the greatest confidence to the next
Presidential election, and we can assure our dear and revered President
that her re-election is certain without the shadow of a doubt, as far as
our Section is concerned, and will be carried practically unanimously.
I feel that our members are at one with me in expressing to the
Members and Delegates assembled at the Convention, our most heartfelt
wishes and brotherly greetings.
C h a r l e s B l e c h ,
General Secretary.

7 4 T H E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF TH E T. S.
This is tho highest number reached since the reorganisation of the
T.S. in Germany in 1913.
Activities.—The reports from the Lodges show that they have been
active during the whole year as far as the often very difficult outer
condition (lack of means for propaganada, of suitable lecturers and
rooms) have made it possible. The new Lodges in Western Germany
promise to become excellent centres of work and enthusiasm.
Mr. Robert Syring who has founded the Lodge at Karlsruhe has been
giving public lectures in different places. Every year he is holding a
Theosophical Summer School at Lieber zell i. Baden, where members
from different Theosophical organisations meet and try to live in the
spirit of real brotherhood and mutual understanding. Mr. Syring has
been for years a prominent member of the International Theosophical
Fraternity, founded by Dr, Franz Hartmann, but has left it and joined
the T.S. because be has found in the latter more tolerance than in the
first one. He is well known in the Theosophical world in Germany as
a writer and lecturer.
On Christmas the Young Theosopbists at Jscrlohn have made a
distribution of presents to 50 of the poorest children there.
In January Mr. Jose Yigeveno (Amsterdam) lectured at Essen,
Wesel and Lohberg. Mr. John Cordes gave public lectures at
Hamburg, Berlin and Hanover in January and February.
In February Mr. Vigeveno made his big tour and gave public
lectures at Dinsburg, Dortmund, Koln, Bonn, Frankfurt, Darmstadt,
Mannheim and addressed members at Rastatt where Mr. Syring lives.
This lecture tour has been extremely successful. Though it was made
just during the carnival, the halls were crowded everywhere. The first
results were Study Classes in tho different places held by Messrs. Piepcr,
Heidmann, Bremer and Syring. The second result was the founding of
6 Lodges and 1 Centre out of these Study Classes with about 200
members, that is nearly 10 per cent of those who had attended
Mr. Vigeveno’s public lectures in February. He went to the different
places in Juno to hand the Charters over to the Presidents of the
Lodges, as I was still in Italy to recover from a long and serious illness.
We cannot be thankful enough for what he has done for the T.S. in
Germany in giving his time, energy and enthusiasm and last, not
least, paying all the heavy expenses of the lecture tour himself.
T.S. IN GERM ANY 75
To show our gratitude, our Committee has appointed him as National
Lecturer.
The last year has brought another far reaching event: your public
lectures at Berlin and Hamburg. Not only that the halls in both places
were crowded and that at Berlin about five hundred people could get
no more seats, but the response of the public and the press has been
exceedingly sympathetic. At Berlin a Study Class has been formed as
one of the good results of your lecture. The way is free for more
lectures, and I do hope most earnestly that you will put into your
programme of 1928 two successive public lectures at Berlin. The
result for our work would be invaluable in its importance.
Two years ago, I wrote in my Annual R eport: “ It would be a
very great help indeed if prominent international lecturers of the T.S.
could include Germany in their programme and spend with us a few
months. The interest in Theosophy is growing rapidly in our country,
but we need lecturers who are able to present it in genuine form.”
(The General R eport of the T.S. 1925, p. 86.) The result of
your and Mr. Vigevcno’s lectures shows that 1 was right in saying
this.
The 25th Jubilee Convention at Hamburg from August 19th-21st.
—After your public lecture at Berlin in the big hall of the former
Herrenhaus (the German House of Lords) on August 18th and your
address to members on August 19th in the morning, you went to
Hamburg to preside over our Jubilee Convention. Though there were
less members present than in other years, we were from the beginning
united in a spirit of joyousness and thankfulness to have you again in
our midst. Your inspiring addresses made a very deep impression at
Hamburg too, your public lecture on August 20th was very well
attended by a deeply interested public. Your Berlin and Hamburg
lectures will be published in German with the title “ Yortrage in
Deutschland von Dr. Annie Besant,” by Mr. Pieper in his Ring-
Yerlag. Some of these lectures as well as some newspaper cuttings
about your public lectures will be published in the November issue of
our magazine, Theosophisches Streben. Those who have been at our
Jubilee Convention will never forget the love, wisdom and strength
that you have poured out over us to enable us to do our work better and
better. The words you have said about Germany’s capacities and its
76 TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T O F T H E T . S.
future will make our task so much easier than it has been during the
last years, and I am sure that the work will grow rapidly now.
Literature.—Since October, 1926, Mr. Ernest Pieper has published
German translations of the following books :
1. Mabel Collins. Light on the Path and Karma.
2. Dr. Annie Besant. A Study on Karma,
3. Dr. Annie Besant. The Riddle of Life.
4. Dr. Annie Besant. Religion and Music.
5. C. Jinarajadasa. First Principles of Theosophy.
6. C. W. Leadbeater. The Masters and the Path.
7. C. W. Leadbeater. Talks on “ At the Feet of the Master”.
8. C. W. Leadbeater. Rents in the Veil of Time.
9. C. W. Leadbeater. Ancient Ideals in Modern Freemasonry.
10. Awaken, Ye Children of the Light.
11. The Spirit of the Unhorn.
12. J. Krishnamurti, At the Feet of the Master. (Popular
edition.)
13. Wodehouse. The Taking of a body by the World Teacher.
14. Rajagopalacharya. Order of the Star, Information for
Inquirers,
Then he has published three pamphlets of the Liberal Catholic
Church, its Principles and its Liturgy.
The Star Group at Berlin has published one of your Queen’s Hall
Lectures, 1925, about the Coming of the World-Teacher as a pamphlet.
All these publications are of the greatest importance, because there
aro many people in Germany very much interested in Thcosophical
literature, but not able to read it in English.
After you had left Hamburg for Copenhagen on August 22nd,
Mr. Yigeveno gave there a public lecture with lantern slides in the
overcrowded big hall at the Curiohaus where our Jubilee Convention
had been held. Here too a Study Class has been organised which is
held by Mr. Boyken, our Hon. Secretary, and attended by more than
hundred people, this is about 20^ of those who attended the lecture.
When I look back over the first twenty-five years of the history of
the T. S. in Germany, I see a splendid beginning during the first ten years
under the most capable leadership of Dr. Rudolf Steiner, then, in 1913,
the heavy blow of the founding of the Anthroposophical Society, later
T .S . IN GERM ANY 77
on the complete isolation during the war and a weakening of our work
through these terrible years and the following revolution and inflation,
but .at the same time, since 1919, the coming into contact again with
Adyar and other National Societies, many proofs of understanding and
love from thorn, even material help of different kinds. The small
group of members which had remained in the T. S. faithful to its spirit
of brotherhood, faithful to the Masters Who embrace all nations and
people in Their love, had for years a very hard task to reorganise the
National Society and its Lodges, to stand the many misunderstandings
.caused by the suspicion and mistrust which had grown through the ex­
periences of the war.
Slowly but steadily all the difficulties have been mastered. Since
Mr. Jinarajadasa’s visit at our Convention at Weimar in 1923 and
your first visit at our Convention at Hamburg in 1924, our National
Society began to recover and to grow in strength and capacity, though
for some years the membership diminished again, as we had to revise
radically our lists of membership. But now, at the beginning of our
second twenty-five years of existence, I think I can say without any
exaggeration that our National Society is again established on a firm and
sound basis, and will do more and more important work for the T. S.,
for Germany and for the world at large. As we have been able to
overcome the difficulties of the last 25 years, we are not afraid of
possible difficulties during the next twenty-five years.
I have most gladly seconded Mr. Gardner’s proposal to re-elect you
as President for the next seven years, and I am sure that the great
majority of the members in Germany will do the same. May the T. S.
have you still as President for a very long time, and may Germany
fulfil its glorious destiny as you have shown it so wonderfully to us
this year !
Axel von F ielitz-Coniar,
General Secretary.
T. S. IN CUBA
To the President, Tfieosojyhical Society.
For the second time I have the pleasure and honour of submitting
to you an Annual Report of the T.S. in Cuba.
Since the date of the former, much has been done, not only in
connection with the re-organisation of our National Society, to enable
it to carry on its enhanced activities, but also in the obtcntion of
material results towards the development and aggrandizement of our
movement and the Thcosophication of our country.
I shall now proceed to give you a brief statement of the work
done, touching only the most important subject :
Lodges : 1926 1927 Increase

Annual Dues, remitted to Adyar. $456"821 $456-82
Adyar Day, Contribution to Adyar. 142-00 $142-00
New Headquarters.—Several months ago we moved to new, better
headquarters in the heart of the City and in the best Office building.
1Note : On September 30, 1926, our National Society was in arrears, as no
Annual Dues had keen remitted to Adyar for 1925 nor for 1926, and the sum of
$456’82 includes Annual Dues for 1925, 1926 and 1927, and also 1o/o for the World
Congress Fund.
T .S . IN CUBA 7 9
We are now trying to move to larger premises, with plenty of room
for our Offices, as the present quarters are insufficient to hold them,
and. also to be able to deliver public lectures to as large an audience as
possible.
Records.—Our records of Lodges and members have also been
improved, and an individual card system adopted whereby it is possible
to instantly locate any member, whether active or inactive.
We have also adopted the practice of giving to each member a
membership card, when paying their annual dues.
Accounting.— One of the most important accomplishments has been
the reorganisation of the Accounting System, to such an extent that for
the first time in the History of our Section, we are able to know exactly
what we have. A voucher system has been introduced, as many
accounts have been opened as required, and the best and latest account­
ing principles have been adopted, making it possible to prepare complete
and detailed Balance Sheets and to know exactly where we stand.
Departments.—Putting in practice the wise principle of the sub­
division of work, the various activities have been grouped under 7
Departments, i.e., Management, Propaganda, Publicity, Magazine,
Library, Foreign Affairs and Co-Related Movements. I attach hereto
a chart showing the distribution of work.
Each Department is in charge of a different member, with authority
to select his own helpers, and although all the Departments are to carry
on the work along the lines given by the National President, they have
sufficient autonomy to take whatever initiatives they may deem con­
venient to the movement.
Circular Letters to Lodges.— Circulars are frequently mailed now
to all the Lodges, and in some instances to each one and every of the
active members, suggesting new plans and activities, and stimulating
the work in general. In this manner interest is kept alive, and every
Lodge and member is maintained “ on the job”.
Joint Meetings of Lodges.—Throughout the year it has been re­
commended to Lodges located in the same town, to hold joint meetings
as frequently as possible, in order to strengthen ties of friendship and
brotherhood amongst their members, and so far results have proven
most satisfactory and in general a better feeling of good will and
co-operation is being developed.
80
lours.—In order to gain personal contact with the largest
possible number of members, and a better acquaintance with plans
of the National President and their own projects, tours have been
made to the majority of the towns where wo have T. S. Lodges. To
that end, the writer was successful in obtaining from the Railroad
Company, a free pass for all the railroads of the Island, and in this
manner it has been possible to travel more extensively in spite of the
fact that our Travelling Fund is very limited. Very shortly these
tours will be resumed, on a larger scale and combined with public
lectures, and no doubt they will largely contribute to the popularization
of our teachings.
Special Conference of November 17th.—So as to meet personally
the Presidents of the various Lodges, and in order that they could know
in details what the plans of the National President were, and at the
same time be able to put forth their suggestions and their own plans, a
special Conference of Lodges’ Presidents was called for November 17th.
Dr. Besant kindly consented in writing a special message for this
meeting, and another one For the people of Cuba, and they greatly
contributed to its success. Through this Conference a better under­
standing was attained, and also a more intelligent co-operation.
Public Lectures.—On occasion of the return of the writer from
New Orleans, where he went, together with other members, to greet
Dr. Besant, a special meeting was held by all the Havana Lodges, and
the audience, which included non-members, was addressed on Theo-
sophical subjects. This was the largest meeting so far held in our
Section, there being about 400 people. Also on November 17th and
May the 8th, and on July the 2nd, public meetings were organized, all
of them attended by a very large audience, specially that of November
17th, where we had about 500 people. This meeting was most important,
because, for the first time in thè history of our Section, a theosophical
meeting was held in our Academy of Sciences, which in Cuba is
equivalent to the Sorborne in France. That of July the 2nd, the eve
of our Annual Convention, was also held at the same place, and very
wide publicity was given by the press to it.
Special Lodge Meetings.—In order to awake enthusiasm and to
attract indifferent members, also ex-members, the writer has been
suggesting to the various Lodges to hold special meetings on the
TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF T H E T .S .
T .S . IN CUBA 81
occasion o£ the anniversary o£ their organization. Most of the Lodges
have followed the suggestion, and they have all reported most satisfactory
results.
Annie JBesant Medal.—This medal, created to be awarded to the
Lodge securing in the course of the year the largest number of members,
has been won this year by a Lodge which has added 35 new members
to its list. The writer feels contident that this incentive will operate
wonders in the coming year.
Book Department.— A Department has been organized to sell
Theosophical books to members and non-members at low prices. So
far sales have attained a satisfactory volume, and we intend to push
this Department not only to render a positive service to those who buy
Theosophical books, but also to obtain a reasonable profit for the
Society.
History of our Section.— We are gathering information to write
the history of our Section, from its organization to date. To that end,
we have been asking from the various Lodges to send us their own
histories, and already have quite a number of them. We will also use
Annual Reports, minutes of meetings hold by the Sectional Council and
Conventions, and any other documents available. Very likely this
History will be published in a Silver Book wo intend to print when
holding our twenty-fifth Convention, in 1929, with many other interest­
ing details.
Statistics.— Much of the preliminary work for the writing of said
History has been done, with the preparation of statistics showing the
growth of our Section from the date of its organization, covering
Incomes and Expenditures, Lodges, members, Magazine, etc., etc. They
have all been published in the body of the Annual Report submitted by
the writer to the twenty-third Annual Convention, which appears in our
July Magazine. I am attaching to this Report to you a number of them,
with some Charts, from which it will be possible to notice how our
Section has grown.
Sectional Magazine.—The name has been changed to Revista
Teosofica Cubana, and we arc making arrangements to have it sold at
the newspaper stands to the public in general.
We have decided to give to our Magazine a wider scope, and a
more flexible organization, so as to reach people connected with other
11
82 TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF T H E T .S .
movements working for the welfare of humanity, though it be in ways
and manners different to ours, and to that end new Sections have been
created to advocate for the Order of the Star, Masonry, Education,-Boy
Scouts, Physical Culture, Spiritualism, Science, etc., etc., making a total
of 25 new Sections, in addition to the regular Theosophical writings.
Naturally, all subjects related with the said movements will be treated
from the Theosophical view-point, whenever possible, or at least on the
grounds of mutual respect and tolerance.
It is hoped that this new organisation will gain us the good will of
all those connected with the aforesaid movements, who will contribute,
to get a wider circulation for our Magazine. We have already had
letters from two of our prominent public men, non-members, one from a
former Vice-President of the Republic, and the other from the leader
of the most important political party who is now President of the
Senate of the Republic and a Presidential candidate, praising our project
and endorsing the Theosophical movement.
The writer has also received a letter from Dr. Besant approving
the said project, and advising she was sending it to Ihe Theosophist so
that it may reach other National Societies.
Spiritualism.— The writer has been trying to make a gentleman’s
agreement with the President of the Cuban Spiritualistic Society, where­
by better good will be fomented between members of his organization
and those of the T. S. in Cuba, as during the past lack of understanding
and a certain spirit of animosity and criticism on the part of members
of the T. S. in Cuba had led to create a feeling of natural resentment
on the part of the spiritualists. The writer does not see any reason
why if spiritualists in Cuba believe in Karma, Reincarnation, Evolution,
and some others of the main Theosophical teachings, even if not exactly
as we Theosophists put them forth, there should not be at least fraternal
relations and good will between all. To that end, efforts are being
made to secure the co-operation of the highest types of spiritualists in
Cuba, in order to popularize those teachings in which there are no
discrepancies, leaving aside those that might bring some friction or
discussion. If these negotiations succeed, we might get a good number
of additional workers, as it might be said that one-third or more of the
total population of Cuba, either practises or believes in Spiritualism,
more or less intensely.
T .S. IN CUBA 83
Circular Letters to Other National Societies__In order to streng­
then bonds of brotherhood with other National Societies, and at the same
time, effect a kind of exchange of plans and activities, we have started
sending out to all of them a Monthly News Letter, giving a resumé of
our activities, and putting forth our projects. We have also asked the
various General Secretaries to appoint a member in their respective
headquarters to keep us posted on similar lines, Mr. Arundale having
given to those members the name of “ Theosophical Embassadors ”.
This exchange of plans will no doubt bear good fruits to this and other
.Sections.
Classification of Members.— Heretofore the practice had been
followed of definitely dropping from our lists those members not paying
their annual dues. We have decided to put these members on a list of
“ Inactive members,’' with the privilege of becoming active members
automatically when paying their pending dues. In this manner the link
is not broken, and apathic members, or those who for some reason have
been unable to pay, always have the door open to return to activity.
Anniversary Month.—The American T. S. adopted at their Annual
Convention of 1926, a resolution to celebrate the 17th of November as
the Anniversary Day, this resolution having been adopted about the
same time that the same idea was suggested to members in Cuba, in
August, 1926. We have finally adopted a resolution whereby the whole
month of November will be considered by us as the Anniversary Month,
of the Month of Offering, and a special effort will be made in it to raise
the largest possible amount to be devoted to propaganda and to unfore­
seen expenses, such as Travels, etc. Of course, on the 17th of November
we will hold, as usual, special celebrai ions ; but the idea is to have in
our National Society something similar to the Month of Offering in the
Order of the Star.
Order o f Servers.—In order to cope with special conditions pre­
vailing in our National Society, the writer thought it advisable to create
an “ Order of Servers,” on certain basis. This Order is now being
reorganized and vitalized, and very effective results are expected from it.
May be that eventually this Order will be merged into the International
Theosophical Order of Service, which we will try to organize in Cuba.
Synchronical Meditation.—Trying to unify thought currents from
members of our National Society, and at the same time prepare
84 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T .S .
mentality o£ the Cuban people *to receive Theosophical teachings, the
writer has organized a synchronical or joint meditation all over the
Island, and groups are being formed so as to have the largest possible
number of members meditating on the same subject at the same time
throughout the country, also when rising and at noon. Subjects for
study and meditation arc 12, one for each month, including Karma,
Reincarnation, Power of Thought, Brotherhood, etc. Once this
meditation is in full operation, no doubt wonderful results will be
obtained in preparing the public mind for Theosophy.
New Bye-Laws.— Our Bye-Laws have been totally changed, so as.
to avoid certain difficulties we had experienced in the past, and at the
same time to organize our Society on a wider basis, enabling it to take
care of the increased activities and of the greater development to be
attained through the intense campaign we are beginning you make to
Theosophize the whole country.
The main changes introduced have been :
The name of our Society has been changed to The Theosophical
Society in Cuba: the General Secretary has also now the title of
National President ; the National Council is composed of 13 members,
12 elected by Conventions and the National President ex-officio, and
also all Presidents of Lodges are members ex-officio, but without vote ;
the headquarters have been entirely separated from all Lodge meetings ;
the National Council may now hold meetings at the various towns of
the Island, instead of in Havana City only as well as our Annual
Conventions ; the procedure for the election of the National President
has been changed, giving Lodges and members opportunities to propose
their candidates, which function was heretofore limited only to the
Council; the secret vote method has been adopted for all elections ; all
Government’s rulings connected with Societies have "been embodied in
the new Bye-Laws, to avoid any legal troubles, with the result that
Government’s officials have praised this, stating that the only Bye-Laws
in the country made according to the Law are those of our National
Society ; the accounting system has been reorganized ; our Fiscal year
has been changed to make it more in accordance with that of the
International Theosophical Society ; dues have been raised to $3 per
annum, instead of $2 as heretofore, or an increase of 50/£, and we have
adopted the 44family dues ” whereby wives, unmarried daughters and
T .S . IN CUBA 85
sons under 21 years of age of all active members shall have to pay only
50% of the regular dues, or $1/50 a year ; and we have also adopted the
“ Life Dues,” whereby members paying $75*00 shall be exempted from
paying any other dues for the rest of their life; and finally, the
reorganization of Centres has been included in the Bye-Laws, in addition
to other details of secondary importance.
A translation of the Bye-Laws, which have just been approved by
our Government, will be prepared and forwarded to you, for your
final sanction.
R esults Obtained

during the year has been great and far reaching.

In Annual dues for 1927 is included the V/Q for the World
Congress Fund.
By the above you will observe that in the course of a year we
have covered Annual dues to Adyar for three consecutive years. This
was the result of the fact that our National Society was in arrears, and
we have succeeded in covering all indebtedness with the headquarters,
although the amount to pay was $456*62, or Its. 1,242.
Theosophical College.— The first steps are being taken to have the
first Theosophical College organized in Cuba.
Annual Convention.—Our last Anual Convention was a culmina­
tion of the work done during tho year. Happiness, co-operation, good
will and enthusiasm reigned, and all past troubles and difficulties were
eradicated. W c might say that it was tho best and most fruitful
Convention we have ever held.
Radio Station.— Our National Society has been lucky enough to be
the second one to acquire a broadcasting Station, which will soon be in
operation. This Station covers at present one half of the territory of
Cuba, but wc hope that it will be possible to make it reach the whole
country.
Presidential Agency for Central America.—One of the main achieve­
ments has been the organization of the Presidential Agency for Central
America, to which were transferred 9 Lodges and 234 members. In
spite of this, our National Society has at present more Lodges than in
October, 1926, and wc might say that it also has more members, as
the 129 members removed to the Inactive File were in almost its
totality already inactive in 1926, and should have been deducted from
88 T H E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF TH E T .S .
the 735 members appearing on that date which would leave a balance
of 606 active members, whereas we have at present 620 active members
for Cuba alone.
Latin-Am erican Theosophical Federation.—But the greatest achieve­
ment has been, in our opinion, the organization of the Federation of
Latin-American National Societies.
The project of tho Bye-Laws was made by us, and it deserved the
approval of Dr. Besant, and has been already accepted by four National
Societies, i.g., Forto Rico, Chili, Argentine and Uruguay, which
leaves the Federation practically organized. Wc feel confident that
Mexico, Brazil and the Presidential Agency for Central An^rica will
also enter the Federation, which will enable us to combine '^ .fforts
and resources in the Theosophication of the whole Latin America.
Four National Societies, viz., Argentine, Chili, Porto Rico and
Cuba have already agreed to hold the First Congress in the City of
Havana, in 1928.
The writer is endeavouring to obtain from Mr. Jinarajadasa to so
combine his trip to South America to make it possible for him to act as
Chairmen of the said Congress, and it is to be hoped that he may see his
way clear to do so. The tentative date has been fixed for June, 1928,
but the definite date will be fixed according to Mr. Jinarajadasa’s
reply.1
The Future Hefore Us.—The complete reorganization of our
National Society, which has been practically completed ; the intensifica­
tion of tho propaganda work, which already started ; the greater
enthusiasm that is being noticed amongst members ; tho enhancement of
the collective conscience of our National Society, through the ample,
tolerant and broad-minded plan of co-operation with all the useful
movements of our country, which has been prepared ; the improvements
in our National Magazine ; the organization of the different departments
to carry on the complex work of our Headquarters ; the goal fixed to
our members for next years’ work, calling for a 100%increase in our
Lodges and membership ; and finally the possibility of being honored by
the visit of some of our great leaders, Mr. Jinarajadasa and perhaps
1The tour which was planned has been cancelled. The General Secretary for
Chile, who is in charge of the arrangements, has notified me that the cost of travel
from India to South America and back cannot be met, though efforts were made to
collect the sum necessary.—C. J.

Dr. Besant and Bishop Leadbeater, to whom wc have invited to come if
they can so arrange it when coming next year to America, makes the
writer foresee one of the brightest futures that has ever offered to any
of our National Societies, which would make it a useful unit in the
Latin American Theosophical Federation, and an efficient instrument
in the hands of the Masters for the happiness and welfare of our
country.

T. S. IN HUNGARY
To the President, Theosophical Society.
I beg to submit my report which covers the period November 1,
1926—October 31, 1927.
The past year was one of the most eventful in the history of the
T.S. in Hungary. The transferring of the Headquarters from its old
premises in the Esztcrhazy u. to the new quarters VI. Drflibab u. 20 in
November, 1926, marked the beginning of a more active life in the
Society, helped by the larger lecture room, holding about 100 people.
Regular General Meetings were once a week on various Theosophi­
cal subjects, by different lecturers, apart from the Lodge-meetings
devoted to special study.
Propaganda Meetings were arranged every Sundajrfrom December
till the end of April. These meetings wrere very well attended and
several people joined the Society.
Kindred Movements.—“ The Theosophical Order of Service ” was
reorganised under the leadership of Chief Brother Mrs. E. de Hild.
Meetings were hold with the ceremony twice a month. The new Chart
introduced this year at Ommen by Capt. Max Wardall will be a great
help in organising the different activities of the Order.
“ The Round Table” has been reorganised by Chief Knight
Mrs. E. de Almasy. The meetings were held twice the month always
ceremoniously with addresses by different members of the Round Table.
“ The Young Theosophist” under the leadership of Mr. A. de
Rsithonyi have changed their objects before purely practical now study­
ing the principles of Theosophy and holding lecture classes.
“ The Order of the Star ” reorganised by Mr. A. Reisch arranged
several meetings and did useful propaganda work.
“ The Arpad Group ” and “ The Music Group ” under the leader­
ship of Mr. and Mrs. de Takach have done much useful work.
T .S. IN HUNGARY 91
All thcso kindred movements function as Lodges of the T.S.
L ibrary.—Through lack of funds, we had to give up subscribing
for foreign magazines and could not add to our library any of the new
books recently issued.
Publishing A ctivity.—Members have translated several books, but
cannot be printed through lack of funds.
Finance.—The financial position of the T.S. in Hungary is positively
distressing. This situation is chiefly due to the low membership fees
which had to be adopted because of the extreme poverty of the whole
Nation in consequence of the sore mutilation of the country.
Donations.—A donation of valuable books and pamphlets was
received from the T.S. in Wales. A generous donation of 1,000 Francs
was recently sent by the T.S. in France, to cover the most urgent needs
of the T.S. in Hungary.
Visitors.—We had the honour of receiving Bishop Wedgwood in
November, 1926—our first visitor in the new Headquarters—for a short
visit. This event was a turning point in the life of the Society
which received from him great help and stimulus for the work.
Kev. 0. S. Price our faithful friend and helper has visited our
Section twice giving several lectures and talks to members; his
help is greatly appreciated by all. Mr. John Cordes visited us
three times and his lectures were also much appreciated, so were
those of Miss Wanda Dynowska and Miss Catherine Bell. Wo
had the very great privilege of receiving Dr. Besant on the 3rd of
September this year. Her wonderful understanding and sympathy with
the needs and difficulties of our country, won the love and gratitude not
only of the members but of all who heard her or read about it in the
newspapers of the country. Her inspiring presence has given us
strength and courage to face the difficulties in our uphill work. Mr. J. R.
Aria’s short visit was also a great help to us. His lectures on peace
made a great impression.
General Secretary.—At our Annual Convention held the 24th of
June, our former General Secretary Prof. li. Nadler resigned his office,
which he held for 17 years and Twas elected General Secretary with
113 votes out of 174. Wo owe Prof. Nadler hearty thanks and gratitude
for the true impartiality and brotherly love with which he presided over
the Society all these years.

Lodges. We had at the beginning of the year which has just
elapsed 13 Lodges. During the year 3 new Lodges were formed and 2
dissolved. We have now 14 active Lodges.
Membership. We think that one of our chief duties is to form a
strong nucleus of good Theosophists, eager to learn and serve, therefore
we strictly applied our by-laws and removed all those members from the
roll, who besides not paying their dues for several years, show no longer
interest in the teachings of Theosophy and take no part whatever in
Theosophical worP.

of our deep love and gratitude to our dear and revered President.

To tlie President, Theosophical Society.
I have the honour of submitting to you the Annual Report of the
activities of the Finnish Section for the period October, 1926 to
October, 1927.

none has ceased to exist, wherefore the number of Lodges is the same
as it was the previous year or 23.

Annual Convention.—The Twentieth Convention, held at the
Society’s Headquarters in Helsinki (Helsingfors) the 15th—17th April,
was very well attended, and its most important decision was the erecting
of a new Headquarters building of brick, 5 storeys high, instead of the
old wooden and brick buildings, which are staying there now. A few
lectures were delivered during the Convention. The Convention went
on very peacefully and harmoniously.
94 TH E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF TH E T .S .
Publishing A ctivity.—Four books and four pamphlets were
published.
Magazine.— Teasoji (12 numbers a year, 352 pages).
Propaganda Activity has been carried out in a somewhat smaller
degree this year than before, because our national lecturer, Miss Hclmi
Jalovaara was away a great deal of the year and our accidental
lecturers had not time to replace her. These accidental lecturers,
Mr. A. A. Saarnio, Mr. A. Vcsentera and Mr. N. Rauvala, lectured
each in several places. Most lectures have been held in Helsinki
(Helsingfors), where aspecial Committee has arranged all the small Thco-
sophical festivals there and procured the performers of the programmes
(singers, musicians, lecturers, etc.) Some of our Lodges have arranged
one Lodge meeting a month public for interested people, having a
special for the public appropriate programme. Many Lodges have also
arranged one or more times a year public Theosophical entertainments
with lecture, song, music, recitation, etc. In Oulu ana Kotka some
Lodge members have given some Theosophical lectures in their local
people’s high schools.
Visitors.—This year our Section has had the great fortune of being
visited by several well-known, able Theosophical workers and leaders.
First came Mrs. Alice Adair, the fine apostle of Indian art, with a
multitude of Indian paintings, many about 2,000 years old, and held
art exhibitions both in Turku (Abo) and in Helsinki (Helsingfors),
which exhibitions aroused a lively interest amongst the public and
especially amongst the artists. She also lectured for members about
Indian art in both places in a most beautiful way, being much appre­
ciated by the members. She stayed in Finland for about 10 days in
October.
Next came Bishop J. I. Wedgwood in the middle of February and
stayed for six days. He helped us in many ways exceedingly well and
radiated out power and strength.
He gave excellent instructions in Co-Masonry and Liberal Catholic
Church work and delivered avery well attended public lecture in Helsinki
(Helsingfors) about “ New Ideas in Religion”. He also lectured
several times for members in Helsinki and once in Turku (Abo). Miss
Noomi Magge, the Star Representative of Sweden, who accompanied
Bishop Wedgwood on his way from Stockholm to Finland and back to
T .S. IN FIN LA N D 95
Stockholm, spoke to members of the Star both in Turku (Abo) and in
Helsinki (Helsingfors), and succeeded very well in arousing the interest
of the members towards more activity and work for the Star-idea.
Then came Mrs. B. Poushkine, the able Star worker from London
in the beginning of March and stayed here for some days, lecturing also
to the Star members here.
Lastly came you, our dear and loved President, to our capital town
the 26th August flying by the air, accompanied by two American
members, Mrs. and Mr. Logan. You formed the acme in the line of
our visitors. You landed on our northerly shores as a white bird from
higher regions bringing with you good Messages from spiritual worlds.
Your world-wide fame had in spite of the rain brought together at the
landing place thousands of devoted people and a troop of girl-scouts, all
eagerly waiting to give you a hearty welcome. Hands and hats waved,
flowers rained and hearts greeted you joyously and triumphantly. To a
thousandfold crowd of eagerly listening people you gave out your noble
messages with your clear voice, in your intelligible, convincing manner.
You gave new ideas, splendid teachings, and lifted your audience for a
moment to a higher world, full of peace and happiness. The newspapers
of our Capital took a favourable position, all mentioning your arrival,
your work, etc., and reproducing pictures of you from different
occasions. And your inner work here was certainly of a still greater
importance than your outer. All members present felt that they had
got so very much from you and that those days were the greatest days
in the history of our Section. Our joy and gratitude was extreme.
We saw that our great Mother had not abandoned her remote children.
Although our Section has not increased with more than two new
members during the year, we are nevertheless conscious that the interest
of the great public in Theosophical things has increased considerably and
that members now, after your visit, are more eager than ever before to
do anything of use and to work for our Movement. The passed year
therefore is in many ways a fortunate year, and we look forward with
glad hopes.
John Sonck,
General Secretary.
To the President, Theosophical Society.
Once more the first words of my report express to you the deepest
gratitude and the unswerving loyalty and love of us all.
During this year the “ R. T. S. outside Russia ” has steadily
increased in strength and in number.
Statistics.—We have lost 2 Lodges in Bulgaria—“ The White
Lotus ” and the “ Temple of Search of Truth,” because members had to
leave the place and seek work elsewhere ; they are dissolved but we have
at the same time 3 new ones : the Blavatsky Lodge in Shanghai, which
has attached itself to the “ R. T. S. outside Russia ” and 2 new Lodges :
one in San-Francisco, California ; the other in Harbine, Siberia, the
part of Siberia which is now Chinese. Thus we end the year with 12
Lodges and 15 Centres spread all over the world. Now we are 300
members, but there are hundreds of outsiders asking for books and
information. There is a big correspondence on this account.
Convention.—Our First Annual Convention took place in Prague,
in November, 1926. It was a very harmonious and enthusiastic Conven­
tion. On this occasion the General Secretary lectured in the local
Popular University.
Our Second Convention was held in August, near Bruxelles, this
year 1927, which gave us the opportunity of having many delegates
going afterwards to Ommen. It was very alive, reports of excellent
work done in all Lodges and useful schemes of work outlined for the
future.
Propaganda.—During this year the General Secretary visited the
Russian Lodges and Centres in Paris, London, Bruxelles and Prague,
lecturing a great deal. Miss C. Helmboldt, Vice-President, has lectured
in Paris, Lausanne and Bruxelles. Mme. B. Poushkine has made a
T. S. IN RUSSIA (OUTSIDE RUSSIA)
big tour through Europe, visiting Germany, Finland, Esthonia and
Yugoslavia.
Publishing A ctivity.—Our little magazine Vestnxk is appearing
regularly in spite of financial difficulties. Our Lodge Yaroslav-the-
Wise (in Yugoslavia) has issued 2 pamphlets : Occultism and Esoteri-
cism in Religion, by Dr. A. Kamensky. In Reval was issued the
Brotherhood of Religions, manual, by Dr. Annie Besant.
Subsidiary Activities.—Besides our special Theosophical work, we
have started many subsidiary activities : the Order of Service, the Round
.Table, Educational Groups, the Golden Chain, the Slavonic Cultural
Union for Brotherhood, Art-Groups. They work in Reval, Prague,
Geneva.
In Prague, under the able leadership of Countess de Suzor, the
Slavonic League has made great progress, uniting with the Arts and
Crafts group and working through art and beauty. Many outsiders of
diverse nationalities have joined, professors, writers, artists, social
workers, students, some having a high social situation, as for instance,
the President of the Czecho-Polish Club and the Head of the Red
Cross in Czechoslovakia.
In Tientsin a regular popular University with evening courses has
been started by the Lodge.
In Geneva, the Order of Service has held a Peace-Conference,
inviting speakers from different peace-movements. Russian and Swiss
members worked in very friendly co-operation to organise the Confer­
ence which was a success.
In P aris, the Lodge opened a reading-room for workmen and
classes for children.
1 do not mention the Order of the Star, which is an independent
and very active organisation with its own magazine. All our T. S.
members, with a very few exceptions, arc practically members of
the Star.
International Activities.—I must mention also our international
activities. As we are spread in many lands, we have opportunities to
help other Sections, especially in times of difficulties. For instance our
members are working for Esthonia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzer­
land, and in other countries. The General Secretary on her tours
generally lectures for other Sections (Belgian, French, Swiss). This

year she was asked to lecture in the World-University in London
during the Students-week and to give a lecture in the “ Palais Mondial ”
in Bruxelles, the subject being “ Universal Religion
We try now to enlarge our publishing activities and we look with
joyful hope into the future.
We send our loving greetings to the brethren assembled at the
Convention in Adyar and to beloved India.

T. S. IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
To the President, Theosophical Society.
When the great part of members of T. S. in Czechoslovakia
separated themselves from Adyar on account of the proclamation of
Dr. Annie Besant, in Ommen in 1925, of the Coming of the World-
Teacher, and founded, “ The Society for Mystical Studies/’ the smaller
part remained faithful to the Mother Society to which they belonged
since 1909.
After this important date September 11, 1925, our Section was
living for two years under the consolidation of the internal activities,
especially of the adjustment of the Statutes and other matters. And so
also was changed the title from T. S. in Bohemia into T. S. in Czecho­
slovakia. We principally encountered economical difficulties, then all
possessions like the library, etc., were taken by the majority of members,
who joined the late General Secretary, Mr. J. Bedrnicek, who left the
T.S., Adyar.
In these circumstances we were substantially helped by the
Federation of European Sections of T. S. which supplied us with £ 20
which were used to buy a type-writer and other things.
The tirst important step we can call the first Convention, which
took place at Mor. Ostrava on 26th June, 1927, where all question of
administration and ideas were dealt with and where the Executive
Committee were elected :
Josef Skuta, General Secretary ; Josef Parchansky, Hon. Secretary ;
Emilio Parchanska, Assistant Hon. Secretary ; Frant Repecky,
Treasurer ; Vaclav Cimr, Oskar Beer, Frant Novak, Albert Karsai,
Josef Drobisz, Josef Kaczynski; Michalik Frant, Loznov Bohdan,
Auditors of Accounts.
An event of the most importance was the visit of our dear
President Dr. A. Besant to Prague on September 1st, 1927, where in
100 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T .S .
the midst of her admirers she gave a lecture. We arc very thankful
to her for the mental encouragement which she offered us by her
presence and her lofty example. What a wonderful example she gave
us by her admirable action in her eighty years of age.
Her Eightieth Birthday was commemorated by 3 public lectures, en­
titled fi Dr. A. Besant and her World-Importance ” in which the General
Secretary explained her immense work, social, literary and spiritual. Let
us express on this occasion the wish of our Section that our honoured
President may enjoy good health for many years to come and may
masterfully lead the T. S. towards its great aims for which it was.
established by its great Founders.
Of great importance on the public and internal life was also the
visit of Miss C. W. Dijkgraaf who was accompanied by Miss Glen-
Walker. In clear and simple words, from the Theosophical point of
view, she dealt with the problems of daily life and of the Coming of the
World-Teacher. They have- done a great deal of work in the way of
re-establishment of our Section and we shall be grateful to them.
During their visit 5 public lectures took place, in addition to 2
lectures for members and three private. In Yarnsdorf, Prague, Brno
and Mor. Ostrava, Miss Glen—Walker also had an address in the
Anglo-Czech Club in Mor. Ostrava.
I am glad to state that Miss Wanda Dynowska, General Secretary
for Poland, also visited our country. She held 2 public lectures which
were well attended, and one private lecture.
Mme. A. Kamensky, General Secretary for Outside Russia, also
visited Prague and addressed a small audience on the “ Cultural Slavonic
Brotherhood
Besides this Prague was visited by the following guests : Miss Bell
and Mr. A. Schwarz of Adyar.
Statistics.—Memberships in 7 Lodges, as was supplied to the
Convention, is following : Mor. Ostrava: Blavatska: 26 ; Karvinna :
Jutrazenka : 17; Horni Sucha : Przebudzenie : 13; Michalkovice ;
Komensky : 13 ; Varnsdorf : Adyar : 12 ; Prague : Arjuna : 7 ; Brno :
St. Alban : 8 ; total members : 96.
Activities.—The principal activity consisted principally of public
lectures of which there were 22, in addition to 74 lectures for members
and 2 debating meetings.
T .S. IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA. 101
Co-operation.—Wo co-opcrate with “ Cas ” Czechoslovak Teetotalers
Union, in which Mr. Parchansky our member is very active. In this
Society lectured the General Secretary on the “ New Man” in the
Esperanto Club in Prague also Mr. V. Cimr lectured on “ The
Theosophy ”. The closest co-operation exists with the Order of
the Star.
The Order of Service just started with us and Mr. Beer was en­
trusted with its lead. We hope that it will well prosper. The first
work they have on their hands is to prepare the book : A t the Feet of
the M aster for the Blind and other works of smaller importance.
In the enclosed map of Czechoslovakia the places where the Lodges,
T. S., Adyar, have been established.
I also enclose a list of Lodges and ask you to supply me with the
Charters for all of them.
This is the visible work of our Section, described in general terms,
which I lay at the Feet of our Great Leaders with faithfulness and
love.
Jos. Skuta,
General Secretary.
T. S. IN SOUTH AFRICA
There has been steady progression, the membership increasing, and
the attendance of the public at lectures indicating a growing desire on
the part of thinking men and women to relate themselves more vitally to
life in its manifold phases. Mr. and Mrs. Ransom did excellent work
whilst here, and we shall reap the benefit of their wide experience in
Theosophical matters. There is manifest in the Lodges of the Section
a desire to acquire permanent homes and to this end some have started
building schemes. The Pretoria Lodge has actually started building,
the Durban Lodge hopes to follow suit shortly, Cape Town is working
quietly in the same direction. The appointment of the lit. Hon. Y. S.
Srinivasa Sastri, P.C., to South Africa has had a marked effect on public
opinion, and his charming personality and eloquence of speech is
creating a new spirit of tolerance and goodwill towards our Indian
brothers. He has linked himself in no uncertain way with the
Society, and has already given several addresses under its auspices.
The audiences composed of men and women of every religion and walk of
life ; Bishops, clergy, professors and students being present. Hundreds
have been turned away. The tide is turning and a change of heart is
manifesting itself. Nairobi has linked up with the Section, two new
Lodges have been granted Charters, one particularly being worthy of
notice—our Brotherhood Lodge in Cape Town. It is composed for the
most part of “ coloured members”. The word 11coloured ” in South
Africa refers not to the full blooded native races, but to those of mixed
colour. We welcome this as a definite stop in the direction of a realis­
ation of our first object. There is every hope that a Lodge will soon
be started in Lorenco Marques in the Portuguese Territory contiguous
to the Union. Healing Groups are being started in several centres.
These are not only doing good work, but are creating centres of force
T o th e P r e s i d e n t ,' T h e o s o p h ic a l S o c ie t y .

in the Lodge itself, which are bearing fruit. Mrs. Gowland, late
General Secretary for Uruguay, is now a member of this Section, and
with her husband, is doing good and useful work.
The membership at 31st December, 1926, was 425. There have
been 90 additions and 10 cessations (4 by death, 2 by transfer, 4 by
resignation) up to the time of writing this report, so that the
membership now is 505 all in good standing.
C. E. Gyde,
General Secretary.
T. S. IN SCOTLAND
On April 3>0th, 1927 (the close of our financial year) we had 783
active members on our roll. During the year 63 now members joined,
and 2 were transferred to us from other National Societies. Our losses
were 24 through resignation and 4 through death, while 13 were
suspended and 6 transferred away from us. Our membership shows a
gain of 18 as compared with the previous year.
One new Lodge, the Scottish Astrological, has been chartered, and
one Lodge, the Virya, returned its Charter, as the members wished to
unite with tl\e Aberdeen Lodge in the same town. One new Centre has
been formed at Newburgh. This Centre is the only visible result of
much Propaganda work done in Fife. An effort in the Border towns
met with little success. Indeed our indefatigable Propaganda Secretary
gives it as her opinion that we need more workers and new methods
We had visiting lecturers from England, Wales and China, and
we had the great pleasure of welcoming again to Headquarters our
old friend Professor Marcault, whose address on “ The University of
the New Age” was much appreciated. Bishop Wedgwood’s five
days visit to Glasgow and Edinburgh was a great joy, and his address
to members at Headquarters on “ The Way to the Masters ” was a
memorable one.
Our social gatherings on White Lotus Day, the 1st of October,
the 17th of November, and the 17th of February were particularly
happy occasions when games and tableaux had a prominent place.
The Orpheus Lodge continued its line dramatic work. Under the
auspices of this Lodge Masefield’s “ Poinpey the Great ” was produced
in Edinburgh, and members of the Lodge helped the Indian Dramatic
Association to produce Tagore’s “ Sacrifice The dramatic side of the
work is being developed by other Lodges. In Edinburgh a mystery
play by Miss Macphail proved a great success.

The Northern District Conference was held at Forfar in September*
when there was a good discussion on “ What Theosophy means to us m
various departments of life ”. The great value of this annual Confer­
ence lies in the fact that it brings together the members of the scattered
Northern District. The first Eastern District Conference was held at
Headquarters in January, the two subjects of discussion being “ How
to Thcosophize Scotland,” and “ The Efficient Worker No definite
conclusion was reached, but there was a general feeling that new
methods must be tried and that more attention should be paid to
Artistic and dramatic presentations of Theosophical truth.
We had the great joy of having you in the chair at our Seventeenth
Annual Convention, which was held in Edinburgh, on July 2nd and 3rd*
and was a most happy and successful one. It was a great privilege to
have indicated to us the main line of work for the immediate future and
the inspiration to carry it out given to us by our President.
It only remains to mention the bright and keen circles of young
people who are among the greatest assets of our National Society.
We send loving greetings to the Fifty-second Convention.

The number of our members, at the 15th of May, 1927, amounted
to 420, against 375 in 1926, that is, a gain of 45 members. During
the year 70 new members have been received, but 25 lost : in this
number, we count 6 Russian members, who have now to be considered
as belonging to the Russian Section outside Russia.
Last July, Dr. Besant gave, in the “ Balais des Académies,” two
splendid lectures on the “ Coming of the World Teacher,” and “ The
Three World Movements ”. They deeply impresssd the public, and
have been sympathetically commented on by the press. Bishop
Wedgwood was so kind us to give us two lectures, the first on
“ The Meaning and the Reality of the Spiritual Life,” the second on
“ Meditation, as Aid in the Spiritual Development ”.
Several University Professors have spoken from our platform :
Prof. Kreglingcr, on “ Steps of Religious Evolution,” Prof. Mahaim
on “ The Social Duty,” Prof. Dumont on “ The Upanishads and the
Vedanta ”. Dr. Kamensky, the devoted General Secretary of Russia,
spoke on “ Religions and Universal Religion,” and on “ Occultism ”.
The Rabbi of Brussels, Dr. Berman, lectured on “ Modern Streams in
Jewish Thought ”. Several of our members gave lectures on various
subjects : “ The Ancient Mysteries and the Feeling of the Divine,”
“ The Religious Feeling and its Numerous Forms,” “ The Kingdom of
Heaven,” “ The Caves of Ajanta,” “ The Occult Aspects of Art,” “ The
Contradistinctions of the Modern World,” etc. Some of the lectures
had lantern-slides. All were well attended.
The course of lessons on Theosophy, given every Wednesday,
alternately by Mile. Orban and Mr. Polak, were attentively followed,
and gave us a good number of new members.

The Bulletin Theosophique, a quarterly, continues to link the
members together.
The “ Lotus Day,” and, for the first time, the “ Adyar Day ,”
have been held with the usual ceremony and devotion.
Besides our usual general and Branch meetings, we have had once
a month, friendly social meetings which have done much to bring the
members more closely together.
Thanks to the generosity and selflessness of many of our members,
a long cherished wish has been fulfilled : a house has been bought in
one of the nicest parts of Brussels, 51 Rue du Commerce, which will be-
used next spring as Headquarters of the T. S. in Belgium. The
necessary money for the purchase, about 350,000 francs, has been
partly given, partly lent without interest or with 4%interest. During
the first three years, the T. S. will occupy only a part of the house ; the
rest will be let; the rent thus obtained will be amply sufficient to pay
the interests and even to begin a sinking fund ; after that time, we shall
see whether our own resources will allow us to keep the whole house
for the use of the Society.
In Ghent, the Lodge “ Vrede ” has bought a ground in the centre
of the town, and will also have its own house early in 1928, thanks to
the generosity of its President, Mmc. Huybrechts.
As you see, the Belgian T. S. has made laudable efforts to increase
its efficiency and to better fulfil its mission of spiritual enlightenment
in Belgium. That is why we look forward with confidence to the future.
At the last T. S. Council of the European Federation of the
T. S., held in Ommcn, it was decided that there should be a European
Convention of the T. S. every year, and that the next Convention will be
held in Belgium next summer (1928), probably immediately before
the Star Congress in Ommcn.
We consider this decision as a reward for our efforts, and a
promise of greater unfoldment in the future.
We tender to our beloved President, and to our Brethren, our best
regards and wishes at this Fifty-second Convention of the T. S.

General Secretary.
T. S. IN DUTCH EAST INDIES
To the President, Theosophical Society.
There has been an increase of 286 new members this year, a
larger number than we have over booked in any previous year.
However, we saw ourselves also compelled to struck out 206 names o£
our list of membership, owing to their being too much in arrears with
their annual dues. With the ordinary coming and going of membership
our total membership at the 1st of October, 1927, amount to 2,028,
viz,, 1,018 European, 824 Javanese and 186 Chinese.
The most important event of the year in the life of the Dutch East
India Section has been the so highly appreciated tour of Bishop C. W.
Lcadbeater in November, 1926, who on his way from Sydeny to Benares
Convention visited our Island-Lodges: Makassar Lodge in Celebes,
several Lodges in Java, and Medan Lodge in Sumatra. Besides much
Co-Masonic, Round Table and L. C. C. work, we had quite a number of
most interesting question-meetings for the T. S. Lodges ? It has been a
great privilege to welcome once again our revered Teacher here in our
Section, after twelve years passing since last time we had the honour to
meet him in our midst. Having visited our Section three times already,
Bishop Lcadbeater knows the country and its people by direct contact
and there is little wonder howTit comes that ail members in this country
belong amongst his most loyal adherents. Much do we owe him and—
we hope—much love dc we give him. A motor-tour was made all over
the length of Java from Soerabaia to Batavia, visiting several Lodges
successively. His work, assisted by Messrs. Harold Morton, Theodore
St. John and Capt. R. B. Clarke, has stimulated and inspired us tc
increased labour in several departments of our Movement.
The Annual Convention has been held this time at Malang, s
hill-place in the eastern part of Java, and it was visited by some 20(
delegates from all Lodges. There was the inauguration of the newl]
1 1 2 T H E G EN ER A L REPO R T OF T H E T . S.
erected local Lodge-building—most of the larger Lodges here now occupy
their own Lodge-building—and harmony and goodwill prevailed, Tho
Convention was presided by Messrs A. G. Vreede and A. J. H. van
Leeuwen while the General Secretary was prevented to be present. In
spite of the necessity to alter much of the original programme, because
some lecturers hadto be cancelled, the lecturers not being able to be there,
so that other ones had to take their places—the proceedings are reported
as having been quite satisfactory. Again we have enjoyed the usual
reduction of 50/£ on railway fares for all members visiting the
Convention.
Our Magazines are doing well now. The official one, Theosojie in
N ed. Indie is edited in two languages—Dutch and Malay—and is the
principal link between the Section’s Council and the General Secretary
with the Lodges and members at large. For students there is tho
Theosofisch Maandblad (Dutch), which periodical now, this year for the
first time during its existence of 26 years, is covering its own expenses.
There is also a similar periodical published in Malay, which, we hope,
next year will reach the same status, viz., leaving no more deficits ; it is
called Pewarta Theosojie. Besides there is an other monthly paper,
published in the Javanese language and edited by the Solo Lodge, T. S.,
which periodical, by name Koemandang Theosojie, is doing really good
work. It will be noticed that wo have to publish magazines in at least
three different languages, but this only solves part of the problem for
Chinese, Sundanese and Madurese—not to speak of the innumerable
lesser ones—are three other vernaculars which urgently want their
own magazines, when we only could find the editors and the means
therefor.
Our linguistic difficulties havo been increased by the affiliation of
the Singapore Lodge to our Section, the people there speaking English,
and consequently we have mutually agreed that the above-named Lodge
be affiliated directly to Adyar again as has been the case before.
The Young Theosophist Movement here was started some four years
ago and is growing slowly but steadily, there being a special Youth
Branch in most of the important Lodges in the Section. These Youth
Branches, though part of the Lodge, have completely their own manage­
ment and are autonomous, independent of the Lodge-Council. This
arrangement proves most satisfactory for this country, because the
T. S-. IN DUTCH EAST IN D IE S 113
Youth-branches are not strong enough to stand quite alone and in this
way they can profit of all facilities the Lodge can provide for.
The Publishing House “■M inerva,” continued its most useful work
of spreading our literature and is now succeeding in getting our books
sold in ordinary bookshops also. There are book-depots in the most
important Lodges where all books are sold at the same prices as charged
for in the main-office in Batavia. A list of newly issued publications is
given separately.
Theosojisch Steunfonds is still doing most useful work as an
instrument for the financial support of our different activities. Several
loans were given and indeed the whole of its working-capital amounting
to 32,000 guilders has been used all year round. This fund is intended
to give support to every enterprise that is promoting Brotherhood and
consequently is connected with the whole of the wider Theosophical
Movement and has given its services to several branches of our work for
humanity, every one of them—if funds permit—receiving a loan for a
certain fixed time only. Because no loans are granted without certainty
that the enterprise is based on sound foundations, this Fund has become
a kind of guarantee for every new financial enterprise that is started as to
the reliability of its investments. When this Fund grants a loan to one or
other of the Theosophical enterprises, it is a guarantee to other investors
—and also to peoplo who prefer to give free donations but want to know
how the money is used—that the thing has been duly organised andis safe.
Theosophical World University Association in Hutch East Indies
was started April 11th, 1926, being formed by joining together into one
single organisation of the four till then separately working educational
movements in Java. A full report has been delivered elsewhere, so be it
sufficient here to mention only that this report covers the work of the
year in 15 schools, all managed by our Association, with 15 European
and 42 Indonesian teachers and nearly 2,000 pupils. The Training
College for Teachers, till now established at Weltevreden (Batavia), is
now removed to a splendid new site in a healthy hill-place, Lembang,
near Bandoeng. We were lucky enough to be able there to buy a hotel
in quite good condition, with considerable grounds still unoccupied and
now wo hope that this may become the place where the Theosophical
World University once might have its future home also. A very
beautiful spot indeed.

114 TH E G EN ER A L REPO R T OF TH E T. S.
Theosophical Order of Service has had its Third Annual Meeting
here on the 18th of April, 1927. A full report has been sent in elsewhere
and for this occasion it will be sufficient to mention that the activities of
this Order here are growing steadily. Both International and National
Correspondence Leagues have a good number of correspondents here and
they are well organised now ; Secretary is Mrs. J. Brug-de Geldcr,
Tandjonglaan 14, Weltevreden (Java). A branch of the International
Fellowship in Arts and C rafts has been started, its Secretary being
Mr. W. S. Bitter, Poerworedjo (Java). Our Labour Exchange did
very useful work in bringing employers and employed together.
Several members of the T. 0. S. have also done good work in outside
activities as : Peace Movements, Protection of Animals, Anti-Vivisection,
Abolishment of Intoxicating Drinks and of Opium. The Muslim League
has issued a second publication, viz., “ Mysticism in Islam,” which
already has proved to be highly appreciated by several Indonesian
students and adherents of‘Islam Faith. It is published at a moderate
price, so that it might be possible that this pamphlet may reach many
followers of Muhammad’s great Religion.
The Theosophical work is thus extending considerably and ever
more workers^are wanted, while the same small band of devoted workers
has to take the heaviest burden in everyone part of it. But several new
workers are coming to the front now—though also several of the old
ones leave for Holland now—and the fruits of all our labours show
themselves in a slowly but surely improving attitude of the general
public—notably the newspapers—towards us and the Theosophical
Society. So in conveying the kind greetings and love from all members
of the Dutch East Indian Section, T. S., I can report at the same time
that “ all’s well ” in our movement here.
J. Kruisheer,
General Secretary,
To the President, Theosophical Society.
On the 1st of October, 1926, the number of members on the roll
was 387. There were 43 new admissions during the year, 2 transferred
to another Section, one member passed away, and 192 were placed in
the Suspense list. At the end of September, 1927, we have 235 active
members.
Bro. Shew Prasad of Maymyo who died in September, 1927, was
a source of great strength to the Section and his Lodge. Bro. K. G.
Vaidyanathan, a valuable member, has gone to Bombay to serve in a
wider sphere, the Fellowship school. Our task is still to interest the
Burmese Buddhists in Theosophy ; some headway has been made to
remove prejudices or misimpressions by carrying on propaganda in
Burmese. The 4 active Lodges of this province are in Rangoon, Maymyo,
Mandalay and Pyinmana ; the rest are more like Centres with an earnest
member in their midst.
Our Convention was held at Rangoon on the 5th, 6th and 7th
October, 1926. Our esteemed "Vice-President of the Society, Bro.
Jinar&jadAsa presided. We have recorded in our last year’s report the
useful work done by him and Mrs. Jinar&jadasa during their sojourn
in Burma for 5 weeks. He admitted into the T.S. 7 new members and
spoke to them of the privilege of coming into the Society. He gave us
the following fine message :
It goes without saying that Burma and Buddhism are synony­
mous. It is true that there are now in Burma, born as citizens of
Burma, Hindus, Muhammadans, Christians, Chinese and others. ^But
taking the civilisation as a whole, it has certain marked characteristics
which are Burmese.
Every one who comes to Burma has noted a wonderful charm,
due partly to the temperament of the people, and partly to the joyous
spirit of Buddhism, which has developed in the Burman to an unusual
T. S. IN BURMA
116 TH E G EN ER A L R E PO R T O F T H E T . S.
extent. While life is certainly sorrowful for all, it seems in many ways
less sorrowful to the Burman, because he has been trained to gain out
of life many charms. Whereas the Indian temperament when at leisure
is apt to go deep into philosophical thoughts of importance, the Burman
has managed in his leisure to gain a sense of happiness and peace
combined. It is this quality which radiates, or rather did radiate, once
upon a time everywhere, from the platforms of Pagodas especially. I
am quite aware how sometimes, since ease has been exaggerated, that
work begun is never properly completed because the character gets tired
of effort. On the other hand, it is a gain that the character should re­
cognise that life is not for work so much, as that work is for life.
It is quite possible for the Burman to be thoroughly up-to-date,
in touch with the piethods of the twentieth century civilisation, and yet'
so moderate the pressure of life on him as to retain that peculiar
Buddhist charm, which is inseparable from the Burma of old days. I
hope that with the combined culture of India and Burma, and adding
what elements can be found from the other religions, Burma will remain
always that place where the sunshine seems softer, and where the trees
seem to wave with an added grace.
The Rt. Rev. Bishop Leadbeater and 3 brothers of his party from
Australia visited us in December, 1926, for 5 days, on their way to
Benares. His gracious presence at Olcott Lodge was uplifting to us;
he gave lucid explanations of questions put to him at mombers, meetings.
He spoke of the World-Mother, of the objects of the Liberal Catholic
Church which were not for converting people of other faiths, and he
urged the Buddhists to carry out the precepts of the Lord Buddha.
Brother Yadunandan Prasad gave us a welcome and refresh­
ing visit in April, 1927. He gave four public lectures in
Rangoon on The World Teacher, Theosophy and Science, Some Thoughts
on Education, A Travel through Europe and an address on Krishnaji to
members and another address to students. These addresses were very
much appreciated, as also the film which he brought of the Star
Congress of 1926 at Ommen. He also gave similar public lectures at
Mandalay, Maymyo and Pyinmana.
Bro. A. Rangaswamy Iyer, President of the Madura T. S. Lodge
also visited us with his son and gave lectures on Sanatana Dharma
and the New Age, The Message of Buddhism, The World-'Teacher in
Our M idst and other lectures. The Rangoon Lodge hall has been
fairly used for public lectures both by members as well as other
speakers. Lectures were on Our D uty to Children, How Shall We Serve,
Whom Shall We Serve, Ideals in Education, Co-operative Housing,
T. S. IN BURM A 117
Bahaism, Organizations like the Star, Fellowship of Teachers, Youth
Improvement Society and The Burma Humanitarian League, the
Rangoon Literary Club have made use of the hall for their activities.
Maymyo Lodge, on account of its energetic Secretary, Bro. Rajagopal,
provided well-attended public lectures on the W orld-Teacher, Mysticism,
Re-incarnation, The Teachings of Islam , Theosophy and Buddhism,
Protestant Hinduism, etc. Dr. Mullan, Bro. Kvaw Hla, Bro. Dorabjee
have kept up Theosophy in Mandalay. Bros. Naganathan, amidst other
work, has rendered valuable help in keeping up the Section office.
Bhikku U Kondanna returned from Benares in March and
addressed other Bhikkus in a few Kyaungs on the coming of the World-
Teacher. Bhikku U Withokda takes interest in the Rangoon Lodge
studies. A very young Buddhist aged only 5, Mg. Tun Nyun, gave
in the Rangoon Lodge two sermons on Lord Buddha’s Teachings with
quotations in Pali.
The General Secretary, in conjunction with several Bhikkus in
Rangoon, has organized a series of lectures on Buddhism which are
given in Burmese by Bhikku Ledi U Sadila which are well attended
and appreciated by the Buddhists.
For the Buddhist Shrine at Adyar a sum of Rs. 1,200
has been collected from the Burmese Buddhists by the General Secre­
tary with the co-operation of Bhikku U Withokda and Brothers Wales
and Vcrhage in Rangoon ; through Brothers Kyaw Hla and Dorabjee in
Mandalay and through Dr. Brahaspathi in Promc.
The President’s Birthday, The T.S. Anniversary Day, Bishop
Leadbeater’s Birthday, Adyar Day and White Lotus Day have been
celebrated as usual by the Lodges by holding devotional meetings and
getting up small subscriptions for charity. Prayers of all Religions
are now regularly recited every Sunday at Olcott Lodge and on special
occasions at public gatherings. Olcott Lodge maintains its regular
contribution to the Public Purposes Fund.
The name of the Section Magazine has been changed from The
Message of Theosophy to Towards Burma's Glory and special attention
is paid to the Burmese portion thereof.
Taking up the excellent suggestion of Bishop Arundale Burma
Section is providing a humble contribution to the 80 years Young Fund.
The sum, expected to be realized, would be about Rs. 1,600.
118 T H E G EN ER A L R EPO R T O F T H E T . S.
We conclude in the noble words o£ her great colleague on the
special occasion of the President’s 80th birthday and 20 years of sagacious
leadership, “ if it be the Will of the Great White Brotherhood whose
chief servant and Representative she is, it is our most earnest desire and
prayer that she whom we so love and trust will continue to lead us on
our Upward Path for twenty years yet to come. Wo lay our homage
at^ her feet and we invoke upon her head the richest blessing of those
illustrious Masters whom she has so long and so faithfully served.”

T. S. IN AUSTRIA
To the President, Theosophical Society.
Statistics.—Great events cast their “ Light ” before, and thus the
past year (looking back on it with the insight gained since) seems to
have been solely filled with the endeavour worthily to prepare for your
coming to our beloved Vienna. The various activities leading up to it
were started, naturally all unconsciously of your forthcoming visit,
because we hardly dared to hope that you could spare the time for
Central Europe, you never having been here during the fifteen years of
the existence of this National Society. The effects of your presence
among us (if only for a day and a half even) will make themselves felt
in the figures of our next year’s report, I am sure, and will show a
great advance on this year’s. The number of our active Lodges is : 10
(last year 14) and of our active members 441 (461 last year) the 92
newly joined inclusive.
Activities.—But your visit was heralded, as it were, by the moment­
ous stay amongst us, during a short week in November last, by Bishop
Wedgwood, whose tournee covered practically the same ground as yours
and vitally helped us to link us up closely with Warsaw and Budapest,
ably seconded by the labours amongst us of Capt. Brice, Miss Betty
Vidier, Akos de Rathonyi and his mother, who is the General Secretary
for Hungary, and Miss Wanda Dynowska, General Secretary for
Poland. Before turning to the assistance rendered to us by Miss Bell,
I must mention another vital stimulus reaching us from abroad : the
publication in German of a series of the great masterpieces of our
literature by Ernst Pieper, Ringverlag, Düsseldorf, Germany. That
we are thus blessed from abroad is surely the Karmic fruit of us having
rendered help abroad, to wit : Andor Steinacker at Eerde, Ommen.
Blanca Schlamm at Huizen, Elly Kastinger and Kitty Verständig at
Benares, Liesl Herbatschek at Allahabad, of Franz Pfeiffer and other
1 2 0 TH E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF TH E T. S.
Viennese members gladly doing yeoman service at the Star Camp
alongside their Dutch and Germ an confrères who, with a sprinkling of
English, were largely responsible for the smooth working of that huge
organism. My own itineraries in G erm any and H ungary and those of
E rnst Breuer, now of Berlin, may also bave contributed to increase the
influx of “ Life Theosophical ” into Vienna, which stream of force lead
up to the climax of you yourself putting in an appearance on the
platform of the largest hall of our capital, before a crowded and highly
appreciative auditorium .
Doing so much independent work abroad, one need not be surprised
if our members have shown great, initiative at home as well. To have
given the im petus to creative activities has undoubtedly been the result
of Miss B ell’s labours among us. H er presence was due to your kind
m otherly forethought, you knowing the w riter to be over-worked by too
many responsibilities. The upshot of our members awakening to their
own executive responsibilities was first of all the organizing of the
Order of the Star as a separate and really independent “ V erein,”
taking advantage of the much more liberal political conditions now
prevailing in Vienna itself, the cityfathers of which managed at last to
emancipate the city from ecclesiastical supervision of its own affairs.
M r. Andor Steinacker’s leadership in this has been duly recognised in
that he is now the National O rganiser of the S tar and as such works, I
am very glad to state, with ever increasing vigour as well for the well­
being of the A ustrian Section of the Theosophical Society, which in its
turn works as heartily as the Order of the Star itself to spread the
message of K rishnaji’s “ Kingdom of Happiness ” . Quite a batch of
lecturers have been active last season, foremost among whom Hans
W alther Schiff, may be mentioned, ably seconded by Mrs. Elsa Lorsy-
Stephani, who took also the arduous translation work off my shoulders
and earned already laurels also in Ommen, Berlin, H am burg.
M r. F ritz Schleifer and Prof. Hans Hüber were active in the province,
and were specially concerned in helping a newly founded peasant Lodge,
which threatened to be swamped right away by orthodox intolerance of
“ friendly neighbours” . Golden strains of love link our city centres
with the W aidhofen community, whose marvellous activities attracted
visits from many a member of our Executive, D r. W alther Klein and
Dr. Richard W eiss among them. The fact of public opinion being thus
T. S. IN AUSTRIA 121
im perceptibly but effectively perm eated with our ideals was proved, I
venture to submit, by the widespread and friendly notices of the local
press anent your presence, and the lengthy reports since your departure.
Our public lectures will in consequence be better frequented even than
last year’s, I am sure, to further which happy event an Action Lodge
has been created, which has been honoured by the distinguished patro­
nage of no less a person than Bishop Arundale himself. As a tangible
result of your influence may be mentioned the fact that some 300
people handed us on special slips their names and addresses,
and the Action Lodge is already arranging to keep the interest
awakened not only going but to still further increase it, where
possible. That your coming coincided with the happily completed
refitting of our H eadquarters and library inclusive, has to be booked to
the credit of O bcrbaurat K orner, whose intuition timed his inspired activi­
ties wT
ith truly marvellous precision, backed as it was, by his most self-
sacrificing energy.
In conclusion, I beg to prophesy that we shall faithfully steer the
course you set for us in spite of possibly dirty w eather ahead, and ever
herald your message for peace by trying our best to link up all Teuton
peoples by bonds of m utual help and trust, and by spreading the ideals
of noble motherhood, thus assisting advanced egos who will acclaim with
glee K rislinaji’s “ Kingdom of H appiness,” and with that to help to
establish the real Brotherhood of Angels and of Men.
May you, the H erald of the thousand years of Peace, who have
been young for eighty years already, guide our beloved Society far into
the millennium with unabating vigour !
John Cordes,
General Secretary.

T.S. IN NORWAY
To the President, Theosophical Society.
This Y ear’s ,R eport, like those of the last few years, has little to
tell of great undertakings w ithin the small Norwegian Section of the
T.S. It is a R eport to show, that wo exist, and that wo are cherishing
hopes for the future.
The work of the Section has been much ham pered this year on
account of illness among the active w orkers, and propaganda, in con­
sequence thereof, has not been w hat it used to be, and w hat we wished
it to be. Much to our own regret, we have had to cut out the public
lectures in Oslo from our program m e. These lectures have always been
much appreciated by the public, and we therefore do not like to be
without them.
W hat has been lost in one field of activity, however, has been made
up for in another. Throughout the whole year many attacks have been
launched against the T.S. due to the propaganda about the W orld-
Teacher. These attacks, which have been partly of a rather vulgar and
unsym pathetic nature, have appeared in newspapers all over the
country, and have brought replies from D r. Lilly H eber on behalf of
the Star M ovement, while M r. K ai Norm ann, M r. E rnst Nilsen and
I m yself, have defended the Society, stating its objects and work, and
also giving its relation to and attitude towards the Star. The opportu­
nity, thus offered for the spreading of our ideas, has been used to a
great extent, and we have been able to reach a larger public, than any
lecture-attendance could possibly provide.
The visit of the President became a very great success. The Press,
both before her arrival and during the visit, showed very much interest
in her person and works, and the general tone of the various articles
was distinctly respectful. Both Press and public seemed to be rather
struck w ith awe and reverence for the President herself. Really, the
T. S. IN NORW AY 1 23
word Theosophy was on everybodys’ lips, and we felt quite popular as
members of the T.S.— a great and new experience, indeed.
To the members themselves, it was a never to-be-forgotten event
to see and to hear the President. M any years of longing were realised
to most, although by reason of the shortness of the visit, the members
failed to get the privilege of the more intim ate relationship with the
President.
A fter her departure the calm was broken, and from opposing
quarters including Anthroposophists and orthodox clergy alike, severe
attacks were hurled both against the President, the T.S. and Theosophy
as a teaching. In the Press as well as in public lectures, these attacks
were launched. The press-attacks appeared in the most widely circulated
papers throughout the country, and my own answers, consisting of 3
articles, therefore, were printed in the same papers.
In like m anner the Press was a very good means for giving publi­
city to the movement for the spreading of peace by the prayer of peace
sent out through the Order of Service. An article of mine, entitled
“ W ar or Peace 55 appeared first in one of the leading papers in Oslo,
and w ent afterw ards through a good many of the most prom inent local
newspapers throughout the country. Thus this bit of peace-work has
been known in practically all parts of our wide-spread country, and
many a friendly and sym pathetic respond has reached me in direct
answer to the article.
Besides the visit of the President, our Section has been favoured
this year with two other rem arkable visits. In February the R t. Rev.
J . I. W edgwood was with us for about a week, and now in these very
days, we have had M r. D. Rajagopal on a brief visit. The visit of
Bishop W edgwood was likewise a very successful visit. The Press was
friendly and polite, the public interested and for the members his visit
was a means of great inspiration and stimulus to continued efforts for
the Theosophical movement. The members have the hope soon to get
opportunity of a happy return of the Bishop’s visit.
The visit of the Organizing Secretary of the Star, M r. Rajagopal,
came very early after the visit of the President, the Press, having in
fresh memory the brilliancy of the President and their own respect and
awe for the wisdom of the aged, was not so interested in this visit as
in the earlier visits this year. The Press was however friendly and
124 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T. S.
very much impressed over the personality of M r. Rajagopal, over the
sincerity and intelligence in his manner of delivering the message
about M r. K rishnam urti. But the whole Press stated, there was
nothing new in the message. The President had told them all these
things beforehand !
Then in looking at the other parts of the w ork here, some of the
Lodges are doing good work and keep faithfully the Theosophical Fire
burning. One small Lodge has been dissolved this year. The President
of the Lodge passed away, and there was no other member at hand to
keep the Lodge alive.
The Publishing Office is in the Lands of the Section, but, because
of the continued economical depression in the country, which influences
the finances of all Idealistic movements, works under very restricted
finances, and has been able to print only some small pam phlets.
However, we are alive in the Theosophical Field and keep the
Fires— once lit— burning, and do whatever we can to spread the message
of the Brotherhood of Religions, which is, I think, the most attractive
message in this country.
A t our Convention in August, a proposal was carried to the Govern­
m ent and D epartm ent of Education about reform s in the teachings of
H istory. The proposal was brought forward by one of our most energetic
workers in the Social and political field, M rs. Ingeborg Boye. The
content of the proposal was, that the teaching of H istory in the Schools
ought to lay more stress upon the more peaceful aspect of historical
events, instead of glorifying war and bloodshed.
The proposal was after Convention supported by other move­
ments, working for peace.
The Convention agreed with my view, that the T.S. may—
at any given tim e— appear in the outer world, not only with
propaganda for Theosophy, but as in the case with this proposal to the
Governm ent, as a movement, which takes interest in the welfare of the
greater com munity as well as in the enlightenm ent of manhood, both
outside and inside the T.S.
Much of the opposition and enm ity towards the T.S. may be
weakened, when the world sees, that Theosophists not only— as the
saying goes— are thinking on their own perfection, but also consider it
the duty of the Society to keep an eye to the needs of the world.

W hen I, a year ago, drew up my last General Report, I felt induced
to say that the insecurity of time had put its stamp upon our work in
whole, and I regret very much having to state that we still have the
same difficulties in keeping up the tem per of the Theosophical work in
Denm ark. Tho diverging points of view within the circle of members,
which I last tim e term ed as a “ passing disharm ony,” are still present,
and I am constantly on the outlook for ways and means which m ight
settle the difficulties.
Nevertheless, the work is carried on, we give lectures to strongly
interested audience all over the country, and to members of different
Societies in the capital and its neighbourhood. This work causes a steady
increase of membership of our Society, while the resignation is caused
chiefly by the difficult social conditions.
The chance of resumption of the broadcasting of Theosophical
lectures is still uncertain, but the Board of Section has done its very
best to this end, through the organization of radiosenders, mentioned in
The General Report of last year. A bill has been introduced to the
Danish Parliam ent—a bill giving the right of em itting by radio to every
organization fighting for ideal aim s. The bill will, according to m y
judgm ent, soon be passed.

130 T H E G EN ER A L R EPO R T O F T H E T . S.
The editors of the periodical: Tidskrift for Teosoji, state a
constant increase of subscribers, and our Sectional Paper : Thesophia
does its work satisfactorily as a means of communication between the
Board of the Section, the Lodges, and the members.
The summer school at Nakskov has worked as previously, and has
given encouraging results.
Two new Lodges, the “ Leadbeater Lodge ” and the “ H erning
Lodge ” have been founded in the course of the year.
An exceedingly im portant impulse to our w ork was given to us
through our dear indefatigable President’s visit to Copenhagen in
August, an event which was not only an experience never to-be-forgotten
to all the members, but also a very im portant help to the Board of the
Section in its work to widen the breach in the prejudices which our
local intellectual aristocracy still nourish tow ards Theosophical Teaching.
M oreover, the presence of our President did very much tow ards
m aking the Theosophical knowledge popular and known in D enm ark.
On behalf of the Danish Section, and on my own account I send
our heartiest greetings to you, our dear President, and to all the
assistants at the H eadquarters.
Chr. Svendsen,
General Secretary.
T. S. IN IRELAND
On the occasion of forw arding my Annual R eport of the Theosophical
Society in Ireland, I wish to assure you of our loyal support and great
love and veneration for yourself.
The epoch-making events in the Theosophical world, during the
past year, have had very little outward effect in this country and the
support accorded to our Society continues to be disappointing.
The general well-being of the country has been worse than ever,
and is reflected in the fact that a large num ber of our members are too
harassed to study and work for our cause and an increasing number
failed to pay their subscriptions.
Our principal Centres continue to be Dublin and Belfast but public
lectures continue to be given in Cork and D erry, as well as at these
two places and we have also established a Centre at Coleraine.
Besides local lecturers, we have been greatly helped by visitors
who gave lectures at these places, particularly by Miss Browning,
M rs. Yates, M r. Bosman, M rs. Sharpe and Bishop Pigott and we are
very grateful for their help, as well as for the financial help which
we continue to receive from kind friends in England.
Some of our members concentrate on study groups ; others are
taking an active part in outside philanthrophic work and the task of
Theosophising life has been further promoted, during the past year, by
the establishment of Co-M asonry and the Liberal Catholic Church
in Ireland.
W e continue to publish our quarterly magazine, Theosophy in
Ireland, which whilst failing to attract general support, is doing good
w ork in relating fo our great folk-lore to the Ancient W isdom.
I very much regret that I cannot offer a better record of work done
during the past year, as some token of appreciation of the inspiration

we have all derived from your leadership ; I can only express the
hope that our next record will be better and that the fruit of our w ork
may prove how much we appreciate your teaching.
P raying that you m ay long be spared to guide and inspire us.

I have the honour of rendering, herewith, report about the work
accomplished by the M exican Section during the last Theosophical year.
M y report differs but little from the one rendered last year as far
as Lodge work, membership, propaganda, etc., is concerned. An obstacle
to any m arked progress or spread of our movement has to be looked for
in the fact that no incisive change took place during the past year in
the unfavorable political and economical conditions of the country and
which, therefore, have continued to exercise their retarding influence.
Nevertheless, I am in a position to state that, generally speaking, our
w ork has progressed norm ally and that it has, at least, maintained
itself at its level.
Perhaps the most conspicuous event of the year was the change of
our quarters to our present address at the “ Cuauhtemoc Building ” at
Calle de Ocampo No. 3, where we have found more spacious and in
every respect more suitable quarters. They comprise the offices of the
G eneral Secretary, a spacious hall suitable for lectures and Lodge
m eetings, a small library, an ante-room and another small hall, set
apart specially for the E . S. I am convinced that our new quarters
are much better suited as well for preparing our future work, because
we have now reason to be satisfied w ith the outer aspect of the domicile
of the Society w ithout, of course, claping to aspire to obtain our own
building some day.
So that during the year, a noticeable progress has been scored as
far as the outer form is concerned and I hope that before long I may be
in a position to report the same concerning inner progress ; after all,
among us, a fact which has become a settled conviction with the great
m ajority of our members, will no doubt make its beneficent influence
felt very noticeable before long.

A t present the num ber of our Lodges am ount to 29, and the total
membership of the Section to 341.
I trust w ith all my heart that the Theosophical Society will con­
tinue under your wise guidance and that the sphere of your beneficent
action will continue to spread w ider and wider in the world, while at
the same time I would tender You in the name of our members and my
own the most sincere assurance of our loyalty and love.

T.S. IN CANADA
The Dominion of Canada antedates the Theosophical Society by
eight years, and has this year celebrated its sixtieth year with national
and popular rejoicings. In the stock-taking which naturally accompanied
the celebration, the extraordinary resources of Canada, its advantages of
soil and production, its forests and fisheries, its mines and oil fields, and
its m aritim e situation, combined with a climate which has always con­
tributed to the developm ent of the hardiest races, were all seen to point
to a national future beyond anything discoverable elsewhere on earth.
W hat the Theosophical Movement may do for an incipient nation by
aiding it to bo free of the burden of priestcraft and sacerdotalism, and
the organized religion which, as a M aster has well said, is responsible
for more than two-thirds of the evils that pursue hum anity, may well be
considered, and is surely the task which the T. S. in Canada has to
shoulder. N othing but the strictest neutrality on the part of the
Society can ever secure success in this, and it has been felt necessary to
renew the protest already officially made against the imposition of a W orld
Religion with a set of dogmas presented for acceptance to the General
Secretaries. This could only be done on the authority of an unanimous
membership, and it is not easy to believe that the members would stultify
themselves by adopting a measure directly in antagonism with the
Constitution of the Society which refuses the yoke of dogma of any kind,
and provides utter freedom for all who join its ranks. Canada is a demo­
cratic country, and is not in sym pathy with either the domination of
Facism or of Bolshevism, or the tyranny of personal leadership. The
Theosophical Society appear in recent years to have abandoned its demo­
cratic tendencies. This m istake has been adverted to m ildly enough by
M r. K rishnam urti in his address, “ W ho Brings the Truth ? ”— in which
he points out that personal leaders die and their followers form sects.
T o th e P r e s i d e n t , T h e o s o p k ic a l S o c ie ty .

You will then begin to have ceremonies, to invent phrases, dogmas,
systems of beliefs, creeds, and to create philosophies. If you build great
foundations upon me, the individual, you will be caught in that house,
in that tem ple, and so you will have to have another Teacher to come
and extricate you from that tem ple, pull you out of that narrowness,
in order to liberate you ; but the hum an mind is such that you will
build another tem ple around him, and so it will go on.” "We scarcely
expected to receive such support for our Canadian views, but the truth
is the truth wherover it is spoken, and we trust this will be given the
support due to a fundam ental policy.
W e have suffered in Canada for proclaim ing this very doctrine,
and I have been accused of abusing and antagonizing M rs. Besant
because I have consistently held this position. I, or any General Secre­
tary, would have just as much right as M rs. B esant to proclaim , say,
M r. W illiam K ingsland, the author of Scientific Idealism,, Rational
Mysticism, Our Infinite Life, The Ksoteric Basis of Christianity,
and other outstanding books, as an A rhat and one to be followed as a
Leader in the Society. In fact, I would not be likely to do as much
harm , since fewer people would attend to my announcement, as far
as the neutrality of the Society is concerned, although, on the other
hand, no one has been m entioned who could have a greater influence
for good through his books. It is a mistaken loyalty that perm its anyone
to sap the foundations of the Society for the sake of prom oting the
cult of any Teacher. M rs. Besant took this view when she expelled the
whole German Section for its allegiance to the late D r. Rudolph Steiner.
And yet he had as good a right to do what he did as any one has to
exploit another teacher in a similar or even more influential way.
The true policy is to allow liberty to all, but to give preference in
the Society to none. Individual members can do as they please. The
w rong begins when the Society is com mitted to the support of any
Leader or policy. M r. K rishnam urti has pointed out the danger and
I am glad he has done so.
The effect of the propaganda which has been forced upon the Society
has been as m arked in Canada as anywhere. Even membership has fallen
from 562 in 1926, to 503 in 1927 at the close of the year on June 30.
The decrease is largely froqi the inactive list, those who failed to pay
their dnes during the year just ended. These are much affected by public
T. S. IN CANADA 137
opinion which was decidedly hostile to the idea o£ a new Christ publicly
proclaim ed. The public are not unexpectant o£ a new Saviour, but they
look for one who will come in hum ility and meekness, who will win hie
way by his wisdom and his power, bearing the signs spoken of the Christ,
as they were given to the disciples of John the Baptist— 44the blind
receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the
deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached
unto them .” The Gospel of Happiness, that we should all wear good
clothes and be happy, is only a mockery to the poor toiling masses of
.our so-called civilization whose misery is their poverty, for whom good
health is impossible by reason of their diet, whose minds are degraded
inexpressibly by the m aterialistic education to which they are subjected*
In The Key to Theosophy, chapter xii, these things are spoken ot, but
Madame Blavatsky is no longer an authority in the Theosophical Society,
and I heard lately of a member (not in Canada) being expelled on
account of persisting in holding a Secret Doctrine Class. Such things
do not attract the public to our ranks, but wc hope to outlive this era,
and survive till the tim e when real Theosophy shall be welcomed every­
where. It has never yet had a proper presentation to the musses.
There is a stirring in the V alley of D ry Bones of the Churches, however,
as the arraignm ents by such men as Dean Inge and Bishop Barnes in
England, and the preaching of such men as Rev. D r. Robert Norwood
in New Y ork indicate. The common people hear these men gladly, and
they are taking the common sense estim ate of sacramentalism and
sacerdotalism in general, which will eventually give real Theosophy its
due opportunity.
Canada has suffered also from some of the Cuckoo movements
which, unable to build nests of their own, deposit their eggs in the
Theosophic nest, and look to the Society and its members for succour
and support. One of these has threatened to split the T. S. in Canada
in two, blit the wiser members do not fear his terrifying prophecies,
which appear to be based on those of the Pyram id prophets who announce
that on May 29 next will begin an eight-year period of war and desola­
tion, ending with Armageddon 1
A kindred movement to that of the Theosophical Society is making
great headway both in England and America, and it is not w ithout
strength in Canada. The adhesion of Sir Oliver Lodge and of Sir
18
1 3 8 TH E G EN ERA L REPO RT OF TH E T. S.
A rthur Conan Doyle to Spiritualism has widened the influence o£ this
cult to a tremendous extent. The Canadian Magazine, a conservative
periodical, this year published serially Sir A rthur’s story, “ The Land
of M ist,” which is really an account of Spiritualistic phenomena as
developed by Richct, the French savant in Paris, and other mediumistic
incidents, all very striking, and with illustrations of the m aterialization
of Homo Pithecanthropus and other wierd manifestations. Happiness
is no antidote for this kind of thing ; Spiritualists are steeped in every
sort of satisfaction and content as far as mere enjoyment can carry them,
so that a Gospel q£ Happiness can offer them nothing new.
The Canadian General Executive at a meeting in August determined
to assist in the development of the Travelling Library activity started
by the Toronto Theosophical Society. In a country as sparsely settlod
as Canada with a stretch of 3,858 miles between H alifax and Vancouver,
it can be understood that it is only through books that propaganda can
be effectively sustained. As far as it has been put into operation these
travelling libraries have given much satisfaction and promise to be
popular.
The Canadian Theosophist has been our chief activity during the
year, and its im partiality and freedom of speech have made it popular
among those who value these qualities. Mr. Jam es M. Pryse has been a
frequent contributor during the year, and among other things his testi­
mony that Madame B lavatsky’s ring is now worn by M rs. Besant and not
by M rs. Tingley as has been alleged, is of general interest. Mr. Pryse,
as one of Madame Blavatsky’s most valued assistants, is a modest but
gifted occultist.
Members of the Society in Canada have been responsible for several
interesting books published during the past twelve months. Mrs. Fred
B. Housser of the Toronto Society, issued a study of the Canadian A rt
movement under the title, An Art Movement in Canada, which has
attracted the attention of critics far and near. It is a most interesting
piece of work. D r. Lionel Stevenson, of the Vancouver Lodge, now on
the staff of the U niversity of California, published through the Mac­
millans, An Appraisal of Canadian Literature, a delicate piece of
criticism, which has been highly commended and which gave due recog­
nition to the special strain of mysticism in Canadian literature. M r.
A. M. Stephens, another Vancouver member, published his second volume
T . S. IN CA NADA 139
of poems, The Land of Singing Water, which contains some exquisite
work, and is altogether of a high order. The Blavatsky Institute of
Toronto published a reprint of T. E. W illson’s Ancient and Modern
Physics, which has been out of print for a num ber of years. This is
indispensable to the student. A pam phlet which has attracted much
attention here is M r. W illiam K ingsland’s drastic analysis of the report
of Society for Psychic Research on Madame Blavatsky in 1885. This
scathing criticism should be in the hands of every Theosophist.
Among the deaths of the year were those of Michael G. Sherk, the
author of a volume of historic interest, Pen Pictures of pearly Pioneer
Life in Upper Canada. It deals w ith the Province of Ontario, as it
is now called, and of the district largely settled by Germ ans in W aterloo
County, where K itchener (form erly Berlin) is situated. M r. Sherk
was a member of the Toronto Lodge. A nother death is that of Francis
Grierson, the distinguished essayist and musician, well-known in Toronto,
who formed one of a party with Colonel O lcott and M adcme Blavatsky
at the Eddy hom estead in N orthern New Y ork on a certain occasion.
There will be no opposition in Canada to your re-election as
President next year.
Albert E . S. Smythe,
General Secretary.
T. S. IN ARGENTINA
The A rgentine Section has entered into a new epoch, which I
venture to classify as one of greater order, activity and cohesion of the
elements composing it.
If the num ber of Lodges, Groups and M embers of the previous
year be compared with that of the present year it will appear as if we
have lost ground. A more careful examination will however show that
this is not so. A num ber of fictitious Lodges and Groups have dis­
appeared— or in other words only those members have lapsed who
entered our Society in order to please their friends or through mere
curiosity or because they believed that they would find a com munity of
supermen free from all defects.
Although the characteristic of this country is indifference which
leads to no-co-operation and facility in criticizing, generally speaking
wo have observed that the num ber of w orkers has increased considerably.
The General Secretary and the Sectional Council, as a whole, have
set a good example, doing m ethodically and w ith perseverance and love
the im portant work which each and all arc responsible for.
D uring this last year the Council has held 16 ordinary m eetings
and 4 extraordinary ones— nearly all were attended by full gathering
of the councillors. In the latter meetings the Rules of the Section
have been reform ed and given a larger scope, greater cohesion and
gravity. The reform ation is now awaiting the approval of tw o-thirds of
the votes of the Presidents of Lodges before putting them into practice.
Those persons who occupy the different official posts are always
on the watch to prevent the Society being perturbed by adverse
elements which unfortunately abound and insiduously infiltrate into our
ranks with intentions to weaken them or to prey upon the members’
vitality. Several serious conflicts have arisen relating either to
T o th e P r e s i d e n t i T h e o s o p h ic a l S o c ie t y .
T . S. IN A RG EN TIN A 1 41
internal or external affairs but the General Secretary has faced them
all as he should oven though it has meant, in certain cases, personal
sacrifice.
Our official M agazine Teosofia en el Plata is published regularly
every two months and on the occasion of the 80th Anniversary of our
beloved President we edited a special number which has doubtless been
seen in A dyar and its value recognised. In all the Spanish speaking
countries our magazine is much appreciated.
As regards the number of Lodges, Groups, R egular Members and
M embers attached to these H eadquarters, all of the A rgentine Section,
the following schedule will give a clear idea of the general state as well
as the detail movement of the membership.
Statistics.— Lodges, 18 ; M embers in year 1926, 403 ; Members in
year 1927, 385 ; Gains, 34 ; Losses, 52.
In addition to these members, there are 3 members at large, i.e.,
attached directly to this H eadquarters.
Besides the number of Lodges, Groups, etc., that meet in this Capital
there is an Institution that is autonomous although dependent from
the Section, nam ely the A rgentine Thcosophical Library Association.
It is open every day and on Sundays public propaganda lectures are
given. M oreover here several other allied institutions carry on their
activities, nam ely, Liberal Catholic Church, The Star of the East,
Co-M asonry Study Groups and the E. S. T. The Library Association
is at present in a flourishing condition due largely to the activity of
several devoted members of the O rder of Service.
W e are at present collecting the votes of all the F. T. S. for the
next election of the President of the Theosophical Society. This is
necessarily a slow operation because this Section comprises the
A rgentine, Peru, Bolivia and P araguay— countries that are situated
several days’ journey apart. However w© hope to be able to send all
the votes collected by 1st of November and we have every confidence
that Dr. Besant will be re-elected.
The proposed visit of M r. Jinarajadasa has stirred up great interest
and we regret that it has been impossible to carry it out. W e will
however wait for his next trip to Europe and will then request him
to come over to South Am erica. There is not the slightest doubt that
such a visit would do a great deal of good to the cause in this continent.
142 T H E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF T H E T . S.
The am ount of fees that has been collected this year— including
the annual and entrance fees— is $1,775’00 paper dollars. As is usual
we are sending 10°/o to the International H eadquarters, nam ely $177*50
paper dollars which is equivalent to £ 15-12-4,
W e are in the most cordial relations with all the other Sections
although we regret that the larger part of the magazines outside this
country do not take the interest in us as frequently as we do about them .
On the 18th of this month the N inth Convention of this Section
was held in perfect order and com plete harm ony. A t that m eeting it
was unanim ously rdecided to send a telegram giving our greetings and
loyal support to our beloved President. This telegram was despatched
on the day following the Convention.
A fter perusing this Annual R eport there arises any indication
that you consider would be useful we should be glad to receive same
and would endeavour to comply w ith it to the best of our ability.
W ith this suggestion I will conclude and respectfully salute my
Chiefs.
Arturo Montesano Delchi,
General Secretary.
T.S. IN CHILE
It is my privileged duty to give you in the following lines a general
idea of the activities of the Theosophical Society of Chile during the
term between the 1st Septem ber, 1926, date of my last R eport, and the
31st August, 1927.
Before entering fully upon the subject, I desire to express to you,
our great President, our profound adm iration for your Theosophical
labours and for your efforts for the furtherance of the G rand Ideals of
the New E ra ; to repeat the gladness with which we endeavour to co­
operate towards their speedy accomplishment, realizing that they are in
accordance w ith the sublime Plan of Evolution ; that they are inspired
by the M asters of W isdom, of W hom you are the authorized speaker ;
the object of which is the realization of Brotherhood, which should be
the chief m otto of the Theosophical Society.
Lodges.— The following charters have been issued :
Logia Loto Blanco, in Angol.
Logia K ut H um i, in V aldivia.
The Logia P unta Arenas has been left in abeyance; consequently
the status is as follows :

The num ber of members have not increased because Lodges in
general have been stricter as regards rolls.
Of the Centres of study mentioned in last R eport, that of Angol
alone has developed into a Lodge. Two new Centres have been form ed
in Coquimbo and Puerto M ontt. Of the form er mentioned in last
R eport, those of Curanilahue and San Fernando alone continue their
ordinary activities.
Activities.— The Lodges have continued their ordinary w ork of
study and diffusion of our teachings. Several public lectures have been
delivered throughout the cou n try : press articles have been published for
the extension of our doctrines; the W hite Lotus Festival has been
becomingly celebrated and also the Social A nniversary; and in several
cities training courses have been form ed for m ental im provem ent after
the methods of our friend M r. E rnest W ood, in his work entitled
Concentration.
I have to stato that several brethren amongst us have had the
opportunity of travelling over our extensive territory and neighbouring
countries, taking advantage of these opportunities to deliver public and
private lectures, thus bringing about an increased unity and brother­
hood. A m ongst these travels I do not wish to pass over in silence
that carried out by M adame E lcira C. de Arm engolli to the city
of M endoza, A rgentine Republic, whore this lady carried out some
very useful activities for brotherhood, and which originated after­
wards the visit of the dear brother Carlos A. Stoppel, a prom inent
member of that country, and finally the tour which it was my privilege
to make to Bolivia, where the most fraternal relations were commenced,
and where determ ined efforts are being made to establish new Lodges.
T. 8. IN C H ILE 1 4 5
Latin American Theosophical Federation.— The scheme o£ our
Cuban B rethren has m erited on our part the most cordial acceptance,
and we are disposed to give it our fullest and best support ; for we
perceive that the union and approach of Latin American countries form
part of the Grand Plan of the M asters.
Sectional Organ.— Our Sectional publication La Revista tTeosoñca
Chilena has increased its circulation to 2,000 copies, its pages to 32, and
has considerably improved its appearance. Its general plan of work is
the same as pointed out in our previous K ep o rt; in addition to which we
expect that the Revista will, as time passes, become a more im portant
bond of union between Latin American countries.
Book-Selling.— W e are pleased to state that the sale of Theosophical
books has corresponded with our best expectations ; we hope to increase
its development by the form ation of departm ent especially devoted to
the extension of foreign literature and publications.
Matías Yurasseck.— I desire to publicly record hereby the gratitude
of the T. S. in Chile towards M r. M. Yuraszeck, of Puerto M ontt, who
has bequeathed by will the greater part of his estate to the Society and
its Lodges.
Visits.—Tho longing to receive the external help of some of our
leaders is still very strong amongst us. W e have not presumed to
extend an invitation to visit us to yourself, well knowing how arduous
are your m^ny duties. However, in conjunction with some other
South American Sections, we have extended one to our beloved Vice-
President, M r. 0. Jinurajadasa, who has kindly accepted and whom we
expect during the next year. W e have also invited M rs. Annie
M. Gowland and M r. Ernest W ood.
Other Activities.— I m ust point out the interest evinced by a group
of our members for the Educational Problem . Two organizations have
been formed. One is under the name of Associacion de la Nueva Educa­
ción, the aim of which is to work for the propagation in the country of
the New Education Fellowship principles, and in aid of which it is
expected that people outside of the T.S. will in future take a more
prom inent part. It publishes quarterly the magazine La Nueva Era9
of which 1,500 copies are printed, and whose acceptance is daily increas­
ing. The other bears the name of Associacion de la Universidad
Theosofica M undial, whose President, M r. Carlos Parrau, is one of our
* 19
146 TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF T H E T . S.
Society’s most efficient and active members. The object of this
organization is to work for the extension of your grand scheme of the
W orld Theosophical U niversity.
The diffusion of N aturism and its teachings also has the hearty
co-operation of our members. Brother Isam el Yaldes has opened a
N aturist R estaurant in Santiago, which has served as an im portant means
of propagating these ideas. M r. Dem etrio Salas, of La Serena, is also
doing active work in this direction, besides publications and other
activities.
The O rder'of the Star, the Women's Protective Legion and many
other movements of a social character, such as Boy Scouts, Societies for
the Protection of Animals, etc., are fields which ofFer a wide scope for
the disinterested and altruistic activities of many of our best members.
Our teachings have lately been the object of system atic attacks on
the part of different members of the Catholic Church. I hope that in the
future, as heretofore, our members will m aintain in their replies and
controversies, in these emergencies, the lofty respect due to all, and also
the forbearance and brotherhood which should be the distinctive
m arks of all true Theosophists.
In short, the year may term ed normal : I believe the progress has
been rather in quality than in num ber, as the im provem ent attained by
numerous brethren, by their spirit of patient and persevering work, is
w orthy of commendation, and inspired by our G rand Ideal of Service
and Brotherhood.
Armando Hamel,
General Secretary.

REPORT NOT RECEIVED
T. S. IN BULGARIA
The chief characteristic of our Theosophical work here during the last
year (1st October, 1926 to 1st October, 1927) is lecturing. Our General
Secretary has visited almost all the towns of our small country, giving
in each of them courses of three or four lectures on different subjects.
The activity in the capital of Sofia was going on with great regularity
and vigour. Our ideas are gaining more and more hearing in the
midst of the general intelligent people. W e are sorry that our pub­
lishing work is very lim ited, because of the low exchange.
It is with great joy that I mention the following fact. One of
our brothers presented as gift to the Lodge he belongs to one storey
of his private house. W hen it was to be opened, there were invited
to give their blessings four priests of the churches— Greek-Orthodox*
Jewish, M uhammadan and Liberal Catholic. All of them came, and
did their duty at the same time one after the other, before many
visitors. A t the end of the service, the Orthodox priest, moved by
the strange and new act, spoke how thankful he is of the good luck
to see fulfilled one of the oldest prayer of his church— the reunion
of the Faiths and Communion in the Holy Spirit. I am sorry tc
add that afterw ards he was forced to deny the fact, but the act did
its public service. About it a note was published almost in all papers,
This year we have 35 new members, and the whole active mem­
bership is 201.
We arc thankful to some 47 brethren who are so good as to help
us by giving 10% of their income, and so our Section is sure for its
good standing. M ay the G reat Ones in W hose Name they offer this
sacrifice bless them.
On behalf of the B ulgarian brethren I have the honour to send
sincere greetings to the Revered President as also to the Society all
over the W orld.

I have the honour of subm itting to you the Annual R eport of the
Icelandic Section of the T.S., this tim e covering the period from
A pril 1, 1926 to October 1, 1927.
Statistics.— According to the Rules of our Section the members
have to pay their Annual dues before the end of M arch every year. On
the 1st of A pril, 1926, we had 316 members. During the year 26
members joined, 2 died, 4 resigned and 2 dropped out.

On May 3, a New Lodge was founded at Isafjordur, a town in the
western part of Iceland. From M ay 1 to October 1, 38 members
joined and 5 dropped out, so the total membership on October 1 is 366.
Propaganda.— D uring the w inter Gr<*tar Fells, K r. Sig. K ristjans-
son and H alldor Sigurdsson gave some public lectures. I gave also
26 lectures at different places in the country. Most of them were on
the Coming of the W orld-Teacher and they were exceptionally well
attended so I had to repeat some of them.
Clubs and Study Groups.— During the w inter season the following
Clubs and Groups kept on working : The Band of Servers, the In ter­
national Corresponding League, the English Club, the League of
Inform ation, the Sewing Club, the League for the Federation of Nations
and the Federation of Young Theosophists. M ost of these Groups form
a Branch of the Theosophical O rder of Service, of which the Organising
Secretary is M rs. M artha K alm an.
Literary.— The Icelandic translation of the book At the Feet of
the Master was quite sold out, so wc had it reprinted this year. In
T . S. IN IC ELA N D 1 5 1
December last we issued the first printed number of our M agazine,
Gangleri. Till then we had only typew ritten it. W e have got about
1,000 subscribers, of whom more than tw o-thirds are not T.S. members.
The Vice-President's Visit.— The visit of M r. Jinar&jadAsa was a
great event in the history of the T.S. movement here. For years we
had hoped that one of our leaders would some day come to our country
and at last our hope was realized. The V ice-President remained with
us for 18 days. He visited most of our Lodges and gave a number of
lectures at T.S. meetings and also in public. The newspapers had
many articles about him, all w ritten in a friendly and sym pathetic tone.
The T.S. movement in Iceland will derive very much good from his
visit, and T extend our hearty thanks to you, dear D r. Besant, for giving
your sanction to his going to our country.
Conclusion.— The last year has been one of the most prosperous
years, since the foundation of our small Section : A t T S. meetings
we have had about 80 lectures delivered by our members and 35 public
lectures. Our M agazine, form erly typew ritten, is being printed now, a
now Lodge was founded and the members who joined were alm ost twice
as many as those who joined each of the form er years. And last not
least we had the visit of our V ice-President. It is perhaps w orth
m entioning that this happy year of ours is the seventh year of the
existence of our Section.
In conclusion perm it me to extend to you the assurance of our
reverence and gratitude.
Jakob Kristinsson,
General Secretary.
T.S, IN SPAIN
REPORT NOT RECEIVED
T. S. IN PORTUGAL
With my most sincere fraternal greetings and highest proof of my
homage of admiration and respect, I submit the report of the Portuguese
Theosophical Society to you, referring to the year running from the
1st of October, 1926, till the 30th of September, 1927.
The Theosophic work done at the meetings of the Lodges, meetings
in common for lectures and Theosophic courses and general propaganda
were once more disturbed and interrupted, as in former years, by a
political and social agitation that lasted for more than 2 months ending
in the serious revolutionary movement in February of this year.
Though the sharp periods of such things be generally short, it
certainly caused the rights of the meetings to be suspended and the
prolonged censure prevented the expansion of human thought and ideas.
Notwithstanding, as soon as normal peace was established, and
with the authority of the military government, we resumed our peaceful,
penetrating, fraternal movement of spreading Theosophical light which
is so necessary to illumine human minds in this country.
M e m b e r s h ip .—During the year more than 42 members were
admitted and 1 was readmitted ; 3 members died and 15 resigned ; there
being an increase of 25 in comparison with last year.

156 T H E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF T H E T . S.
L o d g e s .—Once more the attempt to develope the Theosophic
Movement in Oporto failed and the “ Fraternidade Lodge ” that had
been refounded was dissolved for want of members, but we are going to
try once again in that city.
In compensation 3 of our Lodges were founded in Lisbon during
the present year which are indicated in the adjoining map.
They are : Count S. Germain, H. Olcott and Lcadbeater, the
latter being removed to the city of Lagos, in the province of Algarve
at south of Portugal.
There are therefore 11 Lodges that form the National Section of
the T.S.
As to the number of the Centres of Theosophic study, there are
actually 4 as shown by the adjoining map, but they have not really
given the result that was expected.
It has become necessary to develop a greater propaganda in the
provinces, which the Directing Council thinks of doing next spring,
initiating visits to various cities and villages with an oral propaganda.
Spreading Theosophic knowledge throughout Portugal, it is in­
teresting to know that, though the number of the members in Society
is small, the ideas are much spread throughout the population.
This may partly be explained by the apathy of the population
though the backwardness of the general culture and the economical
crises that these people arc crossing and everyone is refraining from
making expenses and paying subscriptions.
I believe that the number of persons interested in Theosophy is
great though there are only 305 members inscribed in the Society.
Owing to the same economical crises, we cannot make a greater
propaganda with books and words.
T h e W o r k o f th e L o d g e s .—The work on ethics, cosmogony and
anthropography predominates in the Lodges, there being a great number
of hearers but very few lecturers. The latter, overtaxed with
Theosophic work, rarely frequent the Theosophic school to be able to
make the deep study which it requires. A great limiting Karma is raised
before the Theosophic heralds in Portugal. But there is a constant
individual struggle that shall overcome all difficulties.
G e n e r a l M e e t in g s .—On Friday in the room hired by the T*S.,
general meetings are held by the members of the Society, the programme
T . S. IN PO RTU G A L 157
being the following: (1) Lecture once a month; (2) Lessons on
Theosophy and a meeting of the Order of the Star.
There is a gathering of about 60 persons.
This year we are going to inaugurate a complementary course of
Theosophic study to substitute the elementary one that took place.
T h e o s o p h ic P r o p a g a n d a .—The I s i s review is published but it has a
great economical struggle to keep itself up.
This year is a new edition of 1,000 copies of propaganda
pamphlets R e in c a r n a t io n ; it wT
as not possible to publish any more.
The Theosophic publications continue to be in great demand, which
are published by the Editor Teixeira of this city, which are translated
from vulgarised Theosophic works, K a r m a , T h e o s o p h y , T h e S e v e n

T h e S o c ie ty 's H e a d O ffic e .—This problem continues to be without
any solution that will deserve a special study of the Council, because its
need greatly opposes the development of the Society. At present the
General Meetings are held in a hired room that contains from 100 to
120 persons and the Lodges meet in private houses, excepting the
Maitreya Lodge which has its own quarters.
A c t i v i t i e s ,—The National League for the Protection of Animals,
the activity of the T.S., in free development, there being about 1,500
members. Its animal post of help is developed, giving any attendance
at any hour, for it has a permanent nurse. Up to the 30th of June
last year about 700 consultations, treatments and operations were made.
A subscription is being got up, which is going on rather slowly, for
the building of a new station of the league that will be opened in
Lisbon, but there is a great need of money among the compassionate
ones. The League has several delegations in the provinces and has
founded another institution at Delagoa Bay which has developed andhas
now about 500 members.
The 44Fraternal League,” to which I referred in the report of
last year, has about 300 members and many valuable donors, so that
it has been able to give ample assistance to many poor persons
and has distributed more than 20,000 e s c u d o s in alms, about £200
sterling.
T h e R o u n d T a b le is being now organised.
158 TH E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF TH E T. S.
G r e a t T h e o s o p h ic M o v e m e n ts .—Of the three great Theosophic
movements I hope to begin the World University next year, the
organization of which I am studying.
A small but devoted group is going to organize a Liberal Catholic
Church that will reunite persons of devotional spirit, but who will have
to struggle against a very strong reaction of the Catholic clergy that
always tries to thwart the Theosophic ideas.
T h e V is it o f th e V e n e r a b le V ic e - P r e s id e n t o f th e T h e o s o p h ic a l
S o c ie t y .—The most important fact for the Portuguese Theosophical
Society, which 'the report of this year has to mention, was the visit of
the venerable Brother C. JinarAjad&sa and his wife Mrs. Dorothy
Jinarajadftsa which took place from the 22nd to the 25th of last
September.
It was the first time that the Portuguese Thcosophists had the
chance to be in contact with one of the most eminent Directors, I
can affirm without any exaggeration, that visit marked a new era in
Theosophical life in Portugal.
Though their visit was short in this country three days and a half,
and there being the holiday period that interrupted theTheosophical work
and many brothers absent from the city, it is certain that the majority
of the brothers appeared in a body, the two lectures that took place and
always found in the various visit to the activities the realization of faith
and admiration that the Theosophical ideal arouses in the Portuguese
Theosophist.
That dear chief gave two lectures, one devoted to the T.S. and Order
of the Star, in a fine room which we hired, in the presence of about 400
persons and another public lecture in the Hall of the Portuguese
Geographical Society, which is considered the hall of honour, in the
presence of about 2,000 persons that heard him with great respect
without the slightest interruption.
The interest aroused by that lecture was great, and all the press
referred to it, even the attitude of a contrary Catholic newspaper was
actually benevolent, compared with the violent aspects which it assumes
when it tries to impose its belief on any point of view that is not of its
dogma. This first visit of our dear chief C. Jinarlljadflsa and his
charming wife was then registered in Gold Letters in the annals of the
P.T.S.
T. S. IN PO RTU G A L 159
Before concluding I must say that in the Convention of this
Society held on the 1st of April last I had the honour to be re-elected
General Secretary for three years more and by unanimous votes.
I must also say that a new project of statutes was discussed and
approved of by a majority to govern this national Section of the T.S.
in future, and that this project translated into English accompanies this
report, to be examined by you and by the Convention of the T.S. and if
it be worthy of approval to put into force.
With my fraternal greetings will you deign Madam to accept my
homage of highest esteem, consideration in which all the Directing
Council join.

T.S. IN WALES
During the year we have purchased our own Headquarters building
at 10, Park Place, Cardiff, for £2,500.
It was decided to keep, the premises entirely for Theosophical and
kindred activities, and to endeavour to raise sufficient funds from these
to meet the necessary expenses for upkeep. This has involved many
changes and re-arrangements of the premises, which as a result is
becoming a more useful centre for the work of the Masters. In addition
to the Cardiff Lodge T.S. Lecture Hoorn, (seating about 100), there is a
Co-Masonic Temple, a small Oratory for the Liberal Catholic Church,
the National Library and Offices, a Star Room a Refectory, a Rest
Room for Members, a small E.S. Room, and one for Young Theo-
sophists. Miss A. Banks' and Miss L. Harry continue to occupy the
top flat as resident F.T.S.
The Welsh Theosophical Trust has been formed for holding the
property.
Another important step has been the appointment of Mr. David
Jeffrey Williams as National Organiser, Lecturer and Publicity
Secretary for Wales. His practical experience as a miner and his
devotion to the cause of Animals are amongst his qualifications for
this post.
An effort to establish “ floodwill Day ” on Mav 18th throughout
the world has been made.
Three new Lodges have been formed, at 1, Port Talbot, 2. Llanelly,
3. Pontypridd, and a Centro at Anglesey. Forty-eight members joined
during the year.
We were again very fortunate to have our President, Dr. Annie
Besant, to preside over our Sixth Annual Convention which was held at
Cardiff.

T. S. IN URUGUAY
I have pleasure in sending you the report of our activities during
the year 1926-7.
Due to the absence of the National President, Sister A. M. Gowland,
actually in South Africa, and due to the resignation of the National
Secretary few months after having been elected, I have been appointed
to replace him. This young Section needed to be consolidated and
duly organized, therefore the chief efforts during the last months aimed
at this important object.
Considerable work has been done in a short time, so that to-day
our offices are in order, the financial situation is more favourable, and
our prospects for the future are very promising.
We had to change locality moving offices and abode of several
Lodges to another house in a centric place, and with the necessary
commodities. There will be inaugurated the Public Theosophical
Library for which we have plenty of books and magazines.
The official magazine, E l M e n s a j e r o , has been suspended to re­
organize it, and to give to it financial stability.
A reform of the by-laws of the Section according to the require­
ments of the moment is being studied.
The Lodges of the Section have been working normally, developing
generally different activities.
The inclination for the Arts, principally for Music, is the dominant
characteristic, having had interesting meetings with commented music,
recitation, etc.
One Lodge devoted herself to the visit and aid of the sick in the
hospital. Another is sending a Commission to the jail of the minors to
give good counsels and to distribute books.

There have been made excursions to the country ; festivals of
Naturalists, and Sunday meetings dedicated to the children have
been attended.
It is a great pleasure for me to point out the harmony prevailing
among members of the Lodges, which is reflected in the collective
harmony of the Section. There is a spirit of solidarity, and the feeling
for co-operation is growing stronger.
I have suggested, and it has been accepted by the Council, to form
seven great divisions or Theosophical groups of action, of Education,
Social Affairs, Sciences and Arts, Philosophy and Religions, Philan­
thropy, Propaganda, Administration and Finances, respectively, with
the view that each member of the Section should join the group or
groups with which he finds himself more in harmony, each group having
possibility for forming sub-groups to facilitate or extend the sphere of
activity.
The initiative which is recent already began to be realized, having
been organized groups of Arts, Sciences, Education and Philanthropy.
We aspire that Theosophy should not be merely a field of study,
investigation, spiritual development, but also a focus of higher powers
which should crystallize in useful deeds for human improvement in our
daily life.
We are sending herewith the statistical data corresponding to the
Uruguay Section.

REPORT NOT RECEIVED
T. S. IN ROUMANIA
There are now ten Lodges divided as follows :
Four in the Capital (Bucarest), meeting from time to time in the
T. S. room in Mmc. Popp’s House, Strada Vasile Conta No. 8.
There is a dormant Lodge in Targoviste, 5 Lodges in Transylvania.
There are about 170 Fellows, of which some 50 are in Bucarest.
T h e G e n e r a l S e c r e t a r y , elected until April, 1929, is Mme. Helene
Romniciano, of l’Union Mondialo de la Femme, 17, Boul. H<*lvetique,
Geneva. She holds a position in this organisation, which is working for
World-Peace ; she delegates her powers to Mme. J. Popp-Bragadir, who
is resident in Bucarest. Mme. Romniciano is much admired and respected
in Roumania. She is expected there this month (November) for a visit.
T h e Y 'ic e - P r e s id e n ts are Mons. M. Nenitescu of 4, Strada
Dorobantilor, and Mme. H. Lazar, of Turda, Bucarest.
Our movement is naturally affected by the political, economic and
social difficulties of the country as a whole. There is a good deal of
political unrest owing to the unfavourable state of relations with
Hungary; and as most of the newly-formed Lodges are on former
Hungarian territory, where a “ state of siege ” s t i l l exists, work there
is hampered by the difficulties involved in getting permission to hold
meetings of over 5 persons. The Press is censored, strong military
garrisons are maintained in the newly-annexed towns, and the movements
of foreigners are rigidly controlled, limited periods of residence only
being allowed. I personally was told I must leave by 30th November.
Events have placed the town of Bucarest in the position of the
Capital of the New Roumania, whence the whole country is administered,
and whence officials are sent to govern the newly-acquired provinces.
The formation of a strong Centre there is an object worth some
trouble and sacrifice, as it could favourably affect the whole of the
T o th e P r e s i d e n t , T h e o s o p h ic a l S o c ie t y .
168 TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF T H E T. S.
country and produce tolerance andbrotherhood where now there is racial
antagonism and fear.
The Bucarest Headquarters has been asked by various Lodges in
Transylvania to inform the Authorities that they form part of the T.S.
in Roumania, thus leading to the permission to meet being granted
them. A useful little issue of N e w s a n d N o t e s is made from Bucarest
half yearly, as well as occasional summaries of lectures, etc., all of which
help to keep isolated members in touch. There are one or two F.T.S.
in almost every large town in Roumania who are able to obtain books
from Bucarest. r
There has been some re-arrangement of the Bucarest Lodges, so
as to provide for beginners, for students and active workers.
All members joined in a festival meeting for Dr. Besant’s birthday.
A public lecture on “ Tho Appearance of a New Spiritual Teacher ” was
given in French to F.T.S, and the public at the Maison des Francais
on 18th October by Mr. Bertram, and was well received.
T r a n s y l v a n i a .—The growth here is admirable. Starting with a
Parent Lodge, the Transylvania, the following Lodges have grown up
around it : Cluj (Kolosvar), and within the last year, Arad, Oradea
(Grosswaerdein), Temesvar (Timisoara)—all formerly Hungarian towns.
In Arad, in particular, a Theosophical lecture is sure of a very warm
welcome, especially if he can introduce a note of beauty into his
addresses. Mine. Marguerite Jombart is the President.
In Temesvar Mr. Silviu Russu is the President, and the Lodge
members arc Hungarian, Roumanian and German. The Lodge was
formed in the presence of the undersigned, on 11th September. The town
was one of the strongholds of Hunyadi Janos.
The Lodge in Oradea suffers from its proximity to the Hungarian
frontier, but has Roumanian members in good positions.
The new Lodges formed during the past year are largely due to tho
eloquence and energy of Dr. Pall Gabor, of Turda. His lectures have
attracted thoughtIul people of all kinds.
G r o u p s .—There are Groups in Ploesti, under the leadership of
Mr. P. Timmennann, and in Chisinau, led by Miss D. Belovodsky.
The great mission of the T. S. in Roumania seems to be to bridge
over the gulfs arising from varying culture and traditions separating
its present citizens. Will the older culture of the Hungarians ever
1 \ S. IN RO UM ANIA 169
blend with the Latin traditions o£ the Roumanians ? Or would it be
better for Hungary’s lost provinces to be restored to her by some sort of
peaceful agreement. So mixed up are the Hungarians, Roumanians,
Saxons, Swabians, etc., in Transylvania that, whoever held power, there
would always be large minorities, consequently some discontent. The
Roumanians are feverishly building schools for the spreading of their
language and Latin culture, whilst the Hungarians, assisted by the
Roman Catholic Church, have held, at least one huge gathering for the
purpose of pledging themselves to preserve their culture by all possible
means. Is there not a grave danger of another conflagration, as
Ur. Besant pointed out in London on 2nd October ? Perhaps Theosophy
and the Star alone can prevent this calamity.

Devotion and loyalty to you, our beloved Chief ! I have the honour
to submit to you the report of the Yugoslav Thcosophical Society cover­
ing the period qf October 1st, 1926 to October 1st, 1927, respective to
December 5th A.C. It is the day Miss C. W. Dijkgraaf andherSecretary,
Miss J. Glen-Walker have left our country. May be that I ought to
report just after having experienced their inspiration.
Miss Dijkgraaf evoked your spiritual presence so vividly that we
all lived through the glory of your Light. Few only did it a month
ago when publicly celebrating on October 2nd a . c . your 80th Birthday
Anniversary and having your picture beautifully ornated onthe platform.
She realised in Yugoslavia too, “ the deep and warm feeling that tills
our hearts for you, our wiso and loving President.”
So, we shall have in a month you unanimously elected our President
for ever. Yugoslav Section resolved it already at her Annual Conven­
tion on October 1st A.c. May you far in the future nobly represent
the Thcosophical Society in the world as you always do.
H i s t o r y .—In this year Yugoslavia got a red letter day. On
September 2nd our three delegates presented to our reverend President
a national coat as an anniversary souvenir. The whole Yugosjavia as
well as the neighbour countries appreciated the most friendly gesture
o f our great President in putting the “ coha ” on to go on the platform
at the Vienna lecture and sending to the writer an inexpressibly kind
letter from Paris, dated September 10th A.c. It is published in our
sectional Magazine T h e o s o p h y , Vol. I, No. 2, the whole of which we
dedicated to our revered President. There is also a picture in it
representing Dr. Annie Besant in Yugoslav national dress. This kind
of readiness, our beloved Mother, to help your children in Yugoslavia in
donating to them the mentioned photograph of you is again one of many,
many kindnesses we owe to you and we have to gratefully thank
you as Yugoslavia is doing it most sincerely.

T . S. IN YUGOSLAVIA 171
S t a t i s t i c s .—In Yugoslavia there are now nine Lodges and two
Centres. One Centre ceased to work on account oEthe death of its Chief,
but a new one was established to continue the work though in another
town.
From last year’s report the number of 140 members increased
though 2 arc dead, 5 left our country, 7 resigned and 18 were placed
on the suspended list. On October 1st our Section numbers 143 active
members, and to-day on December 5th, 1927, there are 156 in 30 different
towns, all desiring Dr. Annie Besant to remain permanently our
'President.
The Annual Convention was the last of our 448 meetings (in the
regular period of one year) where all gathered people again expressed
the unanimity to renew the promise given to their great President as a
gift for the next year too, i.e., the keeping of genuine harmony in the
Society as well as outside of it.
A c t i v i t i e s .—The activity of the Section has been during the last
year chiefly devoted to sectional editions. On Holy Saturday 1 'h e o s o p h y
a n d th e T h e o s o p h ic a l S o c ie ty , 7c T h o s e W h o S e e k th e T r u th s appeared
as our first printed edition. For May 25th we issued Krishnaji’s A t
th e F e e t o f th e M a s t e r . These two pamphlets were followed by our
Sectional Quarterly. Owing to the idea of our wise President it just
happened to meet the first number on the day of her election, July 6th.
Expressing to the European Federation our hearty gratitude for kindly
helping our publication item we shall endeavour to continue it.
The strengths brought by one of our members who was helped
to attend the Congress of the Theosophical Order of Service have in­
fluenced our Chief Brother to be able to link successfully with it some
of the kindred societies. They joined to make propaganda for the
Great Silence Day. The school children and the army people celebrated
it officially and the Women Movement e x p r i v a t a but publicly dedicating
a special meeting to the “ Solemn two Minutes of Silence ”.
May this spark enlighten Yugoslavia to be led by you, our very
Illustrious Brother and Most Beloved Mother, to the Vision of the
World Wide “ Holy Eucharist of Silence”.

T. S. IN CEYLON
The Theosophical Society in Ceylon, which existed as a part of
the Indian Section, became a separate National Section as on and
from 1st October, 1926.
M e m b e r s h i p .—There were 74 Founding Members on the Roll and
eight Lodges. During the year 35 new members joined ; of these 5
are unattached members. Our total membership then stands at 109
as on the 30th September, 1927.
L o d g e s .—The Section started with 8 Lodges. In August last two
new Lodges, the Saraswathi Lodge and the Besant Lodge, were formed.
As against this three Lodges are inactive. The following are the
Lodges of the Section, at present:
Service Lodge ; Lanka Lodge ; Maitreya Lodge (inactive) ; Asoka
Lodge (inactive) ; Olcott Lodge ; Hope Lodge ; Saraswathi Lodge ;
Yiriya Lodge (inactive) ; Besant Lodge ; Youth Lodge.
Although three Lodges are inactive some of their individual
members study Theosophy and endeavour to infuse the spirit of
brotherhood and friendship into their surroundings and their life.
Some of their members are doing work through other organisations,
such as the Scout Movement and the Soical Service League, and a
Buddhist Sunday School.
The Youth Lodge holds out good hope of being a Centre round
which our membership will grow best.
A c t i v i t i e s .—A Dramatic Branch has been formed by the Members
of the Youth Lodge. “The Krotona Ritual’’ and “The Post Office”
were staged by the Youth Lodge in conjunction with members of other
Lodges. Some of the other Lodges are engaged in the study of
Theosophical books.
The Saraswathi Lodge has started Educational Classes in English
and Short-hand for those who are not in a position to pay fees.

T . S. IN CEYLON 173
The Society inaugurated a series o£ Sunday-Afternoon Social
Gatherings as from February, 1927, at the Thcosophical Library, Borella.
The main item of the Social Afternoon is a short address on any subject
of human interest and welfare. The wide platform has appealed to
many and the speakers have been both members as well asnon-members.
These meetings have been a great success and it may be said that
through these gatherings there has been formed a strong Centre for the
diffusion of the ideals of Theosophy. It has also helped to correct some
misconceptions as to what the Society stands for.
The Social Committee organised six socials during the year on
various occasions of importance. They were successful in infusing a
better sense of comradeship among the members and their friends. Each
such Social has attracted alarger attendance than the previous one. They
are distinctly popular and deserve encouragement.
Quarterly Members’ Meetings were held from April, 1927, to bring
together the members of the various Lodges comprising the Section.
Many of our members take an active part in movements promoting
Brotherhood and Social Reform.
V i s i t o r s .—The lit. Rev, G. S. Arundale and Mrs. Arundale,
Mr. A. E. Ellis (one time a lecturer in the Brahmavidya Ashrama) and
Mr. F. Gordon Pearce visited Colombo in the course of the year. All
three of them gave Public Lectures, during the brief stay. Mr. Ellis’
stay was longer than that of the others and so his visit was the most
useful from the point of view of the Society. His public lectures on
Phrenology, Character Building and allied subjects attracted much
attention from the various Societies to whom his services were lent.
H e a d q u a r t e r s .—Our greatest need to-day is a Headquarters where­
in we can gather together the various activities which exist to-day at
different places. As it is, our work is carried on in different places,
and at private residences. A Headquarters of our own will lead to a
better co-ordination of our work.
The Building Fund Committee, have so far, been able to collect
Rs. 7,046‘92 nett, including Bank Interest. Of this amount lis. 1,101
was derived from a Benefit Night kindly given by Messrs. Madan
Theatres Ltd. at their Elphinstone Picture Palace. The members were
largely responsible for the sale of tickets for this benefit night and they
thus helped materially towards increasing our Building Fund. It is felt
174 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T O F T H E T . S.
that a strong steady effort must be made in the ensuing year to increase
the Fond. Rs. 5,000 of the collection have been placed in the Savings
Deposit Account at the Eastern Bank at an interest of 3£%per annum.
T h e S e c tio n a l J o u r n a l .— T h e C e y lo n T h e o s o p h ic a l N e w s has been
continued throughout the year. It ■ w
as issued monthly when we
started it in July, 1925, but now it has had to be made into a quarterly
magazine because the cost of its more frequent publication was dis­
proportionate to the funds at our disposal.
L i b r a r y a n d B o o k D e p o t .—The Library taken over by the Section
on November 1/ 1926, was begun with 96 volumes, 55 presented by the
heirs of the late Mr. P. D. Khan and 41 on loan from Mrs. Mary Lane,
F.T.S. The total number of volumes is now 348, acquired partly by
purchase and partly by gifts of books and money from members and
others. During the year 20 non-Fellows of the Theosophical Society
have become Library Members of whom 4 have joined the Society.
The Book Depot shows a turn over of over Rs. 500. It has helped
the Library by supplying books at cost and promises to become a source
of revenue to the Section in the near future.
G e n e r a l .—Our first General Secretary Mr. H. Frei resigned the
post as from 30th June, 1927, as he was leaving the Island. Wc take
this opportunity of expressing the gratitude of the Section for the mani­
fold services rendered by him during his 25 years’ connection with the
Theosophical movement in the Island, and especially for his generous
financial support in its various activities.
We have to record with great regret the passing away of a great
Theosophist, Mrs. Marie Musseus Higgins, in July, 1926. She laboured
for 35 years in the cause of women’s education in Ceylon and the
Mussens College for Buddhist Girls is a living testimony of her devotion
and zeal in the work of her Master.
In conclusion we tender o u t thanks to all those members who have
rendered services to the Society in various forms and capacities. Had
it not been for their co-operation in the humblest tasks, often uninterest­
ing and irksome and involving sacrifice of time, money and personal
comfort, it would not have been possible to carry on the work of the
Section. It is earnestly hoped that the members will in the coming
year dedicate themselves anew to help on the work of the Society, and
more particularly of their respective Lodges. The.duty of eachmember
T. S. IN CEYLON 175
to the Society cannot be put better than in the words of one of its
distinguished Founders, Madame H. P. Blavatsky :
“ No member should set too groat value on his personal progress
• . . but must be prepared rather to do as much altruistic work as
lies in his power. He should not leave the whole of the heavy burden
and responsibility of the Theosophical movement on the shoulders of the
few devoted workers. Each member ought to feel it his duty to take
what share he can in the common work and help by every means in his
power.”

M e m b e r s .—During the year under review, we gained 11 new
members, making the total 44. The continued unsettled conditions in
China, with the resulting economic depression, which has compelled
many to leave the colony, accounts for the reduction in our numbers, in
addition to which, two members passed away and two resigned. Three
members are unattached, having left the colony, though still paying
annual dues.
O jfic e r s .—At the Annual Election Meeting in June, the following
Officers were elected :
President: Bro. Malcolm Manuk. Vice-President: Bro. John
Russell. Hon. Secretary : Mrs. Mabel May. Hon. Treasurer :Bro. Burjor
M. Talati, B.A. Hon. Librarian, Book-steward and Propaganda
Secretary : Bro. Herbert E. Lanepart.
Committee : Bro. David Gubbay, Bro. Wei Tat, B.A., Bro. Wong
Man Keung, Bro. Maurice Minney, Bro. Lee Tinsik
M e e t in g s .—Altogether 127 meetings were held, comprising Public
Lectures, Members Meetings, Devotional Meetings, Star Meetings and
Self-Preparation Group Meetings. From May to September no Public
Lectures were given, but the Committee met every week and bathing
picnics were arranged, which were well attended by members and
friends. During that time, at the instigation of the Vice-President, a
syllabus was drawn up for the remaining three months of the year,
giving a list of forthcoming public lectures and much other information.
Owing to the influence of the President, we nowhold the public lectures
in a very attractive room in Messrs. Lane, Crawford’s Restaurant,
though we are still greatly indebted to our devoted Parsee friends,
180 TH E G EN ER A L REPO R T O F T H E T . 8.
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Ruttonjee for the use of the Lodge promises for
all other purposes, with electric light, etc., entirely free of charge.
L e c t u r e r s .—Of the Public Lectures, only a few were given by the
President, owing to his absence in Shanghai and Australia during the
greater part of the year. The remainder were given by the Vice-
President, the Propaganda Secretary, the President of the Chinese
Lodge, one of the Lodge members and the following visitors :
Rev. Oscar Kollerstorm, Bro. N. S. Rama Rao (who gave six
lectures), Dr. and Mrs. Handy (who gave two), Lieut. Myers and
Miss Dorothy Arnold who gave one each.
F in a n c e s .—The main sources of our income are the usual monthly
membership dues of $1 and the collection from our Sunday lectures.
The former, though not so regular as one would like it to be, is still
quite satisfactory when the prevailing depression is taken into considera­
tion, while the latter, which has only just been introduced, has proved
quite successful, though the greater part of it is taken up by the
incidental expenses of the public lectures.
Although we are not dependent on the generosity of a few members
or supporters, still we cannot call the Lodge self-supporting because our
Lodge and lecture rooms are not paid for.
Some of our Chinese members having been transferred to the newly
established Chinese Lodge, their dues are collected by that Lodge. Still,
we are greatly indebted to them for their ready response to the various
subscription lists opened, and it was mainly through them that we were
able to send £21 to Ommen on account of the Star Self-Denial Fund.
The untiring efforts of our Hon. Propaganda Secretary has also
enabled us to subscribe another £21 to the “ 80 Years Young Fund ”
and Rs. 45 to “ Adyar Day ”.
P u b li c it y a n d P r o p a g a n d a .—All our public lectures were sum­
marised by the Propaganda Secretary and published in the four principal
English newspapers, who were all liberal with their space. From 300
to 700 copies of their reprints weekly were distributed among the general
public. Copies were sent to outports and all Far-Eastern Lodges.
In addition, a large number of propaganda leaflets and pamphlets
were distributed among the Army and Navy (of which there has been
a great influx owing to the trouble) and which may bear fruit on the
return of the troops to their homes.
C H IN A 181
In answer to attacks on Bishop Leadbeater and Mrs. Besant in a
local newspaper, the Propaganda Secretary replied by a number of
letters in the “ Correspondence ” column, and effectively silenced our
opponents. The whole controversy lasted about six weeks and thus gave
the Society a large amount of publicity and the public a good deal of
information.
B o o k s a le s a n d L i b r a r y .—The Book sale department did very good
work, the total orders for hooks (mostly from T.P.H., Adyar) amounting
to £78. A stock of books for sale is kept at the Lodge, and a selection
taken to the lecture room on Sundays. The Libraryr, however, could
have been used more extensively.
A d y a r B u l l e t i n . —The total number of A d y a r B u l l e t i n required for
our Lodge next year is 27.

T o th e P r e s i d e n t , T h e o s o p h ic a l S o c ie ty .
M e m b e r s h i p .—The Chinese Lodge was established on November 9th,
1926, with fourteen members, some of whom were old members of the
Hongkong Lodge. By the end of May, 1927, when the year’s work
was closed for the summer holiday, the membership had increased to 36.
Many friends had expressed their desire to join the Society though they
had not yet formally signed their applications. About seven months
before the official formation of the Chinese Lodge, a Chinese Section
was formed, and wreckly lectures were given to an average audience
of about 30 people. During the half year a very successful attempt
had already been made to present Theosophy to our Chinese brothren
in the Chinese language. Most of the lectures were delivered by Bro.
Wei Tat, B.A., President of the Lodge, and by Bro. Manuk,
interpreted by Bro. Wei Tat. The lectures dealt in general with the
Outline of Theosophy, Reincarnation, Karma, Life After Death, Thought
Power, At the Feet of the Master, The Masters and the Path, Universal
Brotherhood, etc. Lectures on the Order of the Star in the East, and
182 T H E G EN ERA R REPO R T OF TH E T. S.
on the Coming of the World-Teacher were also given. A big and
successful social function was held during that embryonic period of our
Lodge, and the publication oE the Presidential Address of Bro. Wei
Tat in the local papers at last introduced our Lodge to the outer world.
On the 9th of November, 1926, on the occasion of the establishment
of the Chinese Lodge, a very impressive ceremony was held in which
the President of the Lodge received the Charter of the Society from
Bro, Manuk, Presidential Agent for China. In his reply to Bro.
Manuk's address, Bro. Wei Tat declared emphatically, “ This is the
beginning of a long and continuous life of active service and self-
sacrifice, service devoted to our country China in particular and to the
whole world at large. The aims before us will be the dissemination of
Light and Truth throughout the length and breadth of China, the
realization of that ideal of Brotherhood among her sons, and the
recovery and revival of her marvellous philosophy in the light of
Theosophy not only for the vitalization of the Taoist and Confucian
religions but for the fertilization of the world field of thought . . . ”
L e c tu r e s .—During the seven months of activity following the for­
mation of the Lodge, 28 lectures were given, one of which was kindly
delivered by Bro. Kama R*ao, who passed Hongkong on his way to
India. The inspiring lecture of Bro. Kama Kao instilled into the ('hiñese
Lodge a new spirit for service and new strength for spiritual «attainment.
The remaining lectures were generally undertaken by Bros. Manuk.
Wei Tat and other members of the Lodge.
O r < j(u u z a tio n t—For the administration of the Lodge, the following
officers were elected for the year by the members: P r e s id e n t : Wei
Tat. S e c r e t a r y : Wong Man Kcnng. C o m m it t e e : Bros. Lee Tinsik,
Tsoi Wai Yat, Chu Mau Chi, Peter Kwok, Chunkin Liu, and Wan
Ping Ching.
F in a n c e s .—The income of the Lodge depends on the monthly
subscriptions of the members, and outside donations. The monthly
subscription of each member is fifty cents ; but they were not
collected for the whole year, as no necessity for expenses was felt
during the year. However, Bro. Wei Tat succeeded in obtaining for
the Society outside donations amounting to $370*00 of which $50 had
been transferred to the Ommen Fund in support of the Order of
the Star.
CH IN A 183
P r e s e n t A c t i v i t i e s .—At present our Lodge has a large number of
active and enthusiastic workers. A Chinese Library has been formed,
and u u Lecture-practising Class ” is being successfully carried on. A
New-Thought Centre has also been formed by a few members for mental
and spiritual development.
F u t u r e P r o s p e c ts .—The future of the Chinese Lodge is a most
promising one. It lias been found that Chinese people of all classes
and religions, Taoists, Confucianists, Buddhists, and Christians, respond
to the Message of Theosophy very readily, and show a very urgent
demand for our Theosophical literature. To-day the number of
members is steadily increasing, and the attendance of our lectures is
also becoming large. It is hoped that when adequate propaganda
pamphlets have been prepared and distributed among the Chinese, weshall
easily increase our membership to a hundred or more. A mighty effort
will also be made to introduce the Order of the Staramong the Chinese
Brothers, and to spread the Messages of the World-Teacher in ('hina.
C o - o p e r a tio n w ith th e H o n g k o n g L o d g e .—Our Chinese Lodge has
been co-operating with the Hongkong Lodge in giving weekly English
lectures at the tea room of Messrs. Lane, Crawford & Co., Ltd. During
this winter term the President of our Chinese Lodge has already given
to large audiences a series of lectures on the religions of China, namely,
Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism.

A Lodge Hoorn was taken at 12 Nanking Road, the Library was
installed there, and classes and lectures were held. Monthly lectures
were given from October, 1926, until the middle of January, 1927, and
from then until the end of May fortnightly.
184 THE GENERAL REPORT OP THE T. S.
The financial year closed on June 30th, when the books showed a
balance in hand of $253*47.
The translation had been completed into Chinese of First Steps
in Theosophy, and a thousand copies had been printed, which it
was hoped would find a ready sale as the price was purposely kept
very low.

A LL -IN D IA FED E R A T IO N O F YOUNG T H EO SO PH ISTS
To the President^ Theosophiral Society.
The A ll-India Federation of Young Theosophists has completed the
fourth year of its existence, the period under review being one of slow
but steady progress. It also m arks the second year of its closer
relationship with the National Society while retaining its autonomy in
the m anagem ent of its own affairs. It continues to be affiliated to the
W orld Federation of Young Theosophists.
Constitution.—The Constitution and Rules evolved gradually by
the Young Theosophists themselves as a result of their previous year’s
experience and as finally passed at the Benares Young Theosophists*
Convention held in December, Iff26, were found to be simple and most
conveniently workable while giving at the same tim e the greatest
unfettered scope for free self-expression on the part of its constituent
Lodges and Centres. Organised activity has been much in evidences
especially in such provinces as M aharashtra, U .P., G ujarat and
K athiaw ar besides the M adras City and Suburban areas where Local
Federations as provided for in Rule 30 of the Constitution, have been
in process of form ation.
Headquarters.— As before, the Central H eadquarters of the
Federation continued to be located at A dyar and its close proxim ity
to the International H eadquarters of the Parent Society has undoubted­
ly helped to draw the necessary vitality for an effective spread of it
to the distant corners of our vast country. The H eadquarters Office
was being managed bv the Joint General Secretaries assisted hv a
whole-timed w orker.
Lodges.-—A t the end of our last official year we were reported to
be having 104 Lodges and 7 Centres on our rolls although onlv 52
Lodges and 4 Centres (or about 507 of them) were mentioned as
having maintained their relationship with the H eadquarters by sending
reports of their activities, etc., at regular intervals. During the year
under review 11 Lodges have been churtered and 2 Centres have
been form ed. Out of the 11 Lodges chartered, 6 were already men­
tioned as having been formed during the last year although not chartered.
24
186 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
W e have now 109 Lodges and 9 Centres on our rolls. 43 Lodges and
Centres have been in constant touch with us, sending in their reports,
etc. The com paratively small increase in the num ber of its Lodges
and Centres is not only indicative of the general lull in the
country so far as organised Theosophical activity is concerned but it also
proves the necessity for a large num ber of enthusiastic and capable
Youths forthcom ing to serve as honorary Youth Lodge Organisers in
their respective areas. However, looking at the work that those existing
Lodges and Centres have been doing during the year there is nothing
to despair ; for much useful service has been rendered by some of the
active ones to the people of the locality in several areas. For example
the Action Youth Lodge of Surat, the Bilim ora Lodge, and Ahmedabad
Y outh Lodge, to mention a few out of the many others, have done
yeomen service to the sufferers of G ujarat on account of heavy and
devastating floods. Bombay, Poona, Bhavnagar, M adanapalle and
Benares, as usual, have been very lively centres of Theosophical and
allied activities. Stray members here and there, have been doing
propaganda work. First Aid work, drawing, painting and music
classes, weekly study classes, m anuscript magazines, camp-fires,
excursions, relief work such as H ospital-visiting, Jail-visiting, etc.,
have been the most popular of the activities of our Youth Lodges
amongst others. A few Lodges in N orth India have also very closely
co-operated with movements such as the T.S. O rder of Service, O rder
of the Round Tabic, O rder of the Star, The Boy Scouts movement and
so on, and have done much useful work.
Membership.— Last year, we had 1,767 members on our rolls of
which 45 were full members of the Indian Section. The Federation
issued 269 Diplomas during the year under review making tho total
strength 2,036. W e lost one by death and one by definite resignation.
W e have also to add to that num ber 39 Fellows of the T.S. who joined
the Federation as Associate members. W e have, therefore, 2,034
R egular members of the Federation and 84 associate members. The
whereabouts of a large m ajority of the old members are not traceable
due to— as has already been observed by our predecessor— the centres
themselves being inactive and in not a few cases alm ost com pletely
dorm ant. W ith the organization of Local Federations and with much
intensive activity on the part of our Lodges and workers here and there,
ALL-INDIA FEDERATION OF YOUNG THEOSOPHISTS 187
we hope that the coining year will witness much co-ordinated activity
and the coming into active membership again of most of the old members.
Magazine.— The Young Theosophist continued to be the Official
O rgan of the Federation and it was being ably edited from Bombay
by Bro. Sunder 1\ Kabadi. Our heartiest thanks go out to him for all
the trouble that the editing and publishing of the journal have entailed
him on account of the highly unsatisfactory state of its finances. W e
hope that the Young Theosophists will see to it during the coming year
that the magazine is mode really self-supporting. It rests entirely
with the members to make it more interesting and financially stronger.
“ 80 Years Young Fund."— The greatest event in the life of the
Federation during the year under review has undoubtedly been the
work in connection with this “ F u n d ” . The response to our
President’s appeal made from on board s.s. Ranpuia on August 4th, for
a total collection of Rs. 1,000, has been indeed m arvellous. The
H eadquarters got certain small button-hole Flags and Stam ps both
bearing the bust photographs of Dr. Annie Besant made for sale in aid
of the “ F u n d ” . Lodges and members have shown real enthusiasm in
collecting m onetary contributions to the “ F u n d ” as also in selling
these Flags and Stam ps. So far about Rs. 600 have been collected and
before the end of December we hope that the expected one thousand
will be realized. W hat is of greater im portance is not the am ount
itself but the enthusiasm to dem onstrate our Love, Reverence, and
G ratitude to two of our Elder Brothers that the appeal of our beloved
President has stim ulated.
Conclusion.— A great work lies ahead of us. True, the year has
witnessed the Ideal becoming the Real to those who have had the
visions to see ; but the glory lies in the conscious surrender of our all to
Him who is the Lord and who in His infinite compassion has once again
chosen to walk as Man among men and by so perfecting our organization
as to be a most efficient channel for spreading His Gospel of Love and
H appiness. Glorious is the opportunity of the Y oung— nay not of the
body alone but of the spirit as well— to co-operate in His work. The
Call is there ; who will rally round it ?

A Historical Sketch.— It may not be out of place if I begin to give
you an account of how the Singapore Lodge, Theosophical Society, was
formed in the year 1911 and a C harter was obtained on 1st August of
that year. B ut till A pril, 1925, very little work seems to have been
done, it being left to Bro. M. Fones to keep even the naino alive.
During April, 1925, Professor K ulkarni of the Gwalior College, Central
India, paid a visit to Singapore on his return home, after a world tour.
SINGAPORE LODGE 189
As a result the Lodge was again revived, and meetings began to be held
regularly on Sunday mornings with a very small membership. In
Murch, 1926, it was considered desirable to apply to the R egistrar of
Societies to exempt the Lodge from registration so that work may be
pushed forward more vigorously and system atically. On 12th May,
1926, the advice of exemption was received. On 11th Septem ber, 1926,
M r. J. H . Ruttonjee of Hong Kong made a generous offer to the
committee to place at their disposal a spacious room in his offices. The
com m ittee accepted the offer on the understanding that it is to serve as
n Town Branch of the Lodge. Although the room was ready early in
the beginning of this year yet we could not make use of it through the
lack of funds until 3rd of M arch, 1927, when it was officially opened
by our President Bro. M. Fones. The sincere thanks of the Lodge are
due to M r. J. H . R uttonjee who not only gave the free use of the room
but also presented 133 books to the library and donated a sum of $200
for general work and furniture. Much appreciation must be accorded
to his representative M r. Phiroze M istry who has assisted much and
is ever ready to help the Lodge.
The Lodge used to be attached to no Sectional Society till towards
the end of 1925 when it was thought advisable to seek connection vrith
the Java Section in view of the nearness to their H eadquarters and
the possibility of being able to get into personal touch with some of
their members who constantly pass through Singapore on their way
to and from Java. The language, Dutch, however proved to be a
stum bling block in the way, as our members could not make any use
of their periodicals and bulletins. A t the Annual General M eeting, it
was resolved, therefore, that the Lodge sever its connection with the
Java Section on account of the linguistic difficulties and re-transfer it
to A dyar H eadquarters. The Java Section was w ritten to and the
official consent was duly received from the General Secretary of the
Dutch East Indies and confirmed by the A cting Recording Secretary at
A dyar on 13th A ugust, 1927. Once more it is attached to H eadquarters
and now for bettor progress and service !
Committee Meetings.— D uring the year the Committee consisted of
Brothers M. Fones (President), J. R. Naidu (V ice-President), On Lock
H cng (Secretary), P. M istry (Treasurer and Librarian), C. R. Menon
and J . M. Jansen.

Meetings.— Study classes wore held uninterruptedly every Sunday
mornings. The book Talks on “ At the Feet of the Master ” was chosen
for special study and practically the whole of it has been carefully read
and discussed in conjunction with Talks on the Path of Occultism in
the course of the year.
Since the opening of our Town Branch at 3 Finlayson Green we
hold regular public meetings on Thursday evenings when lectures of
following titles were delivered : “ W hat is Theosophy,” “ The Law
of Cause and Effect,” “ On Moods,” “ Theosophy,” “ On V alues,”
“ B rotherhood,” “ W hat is Theosophy,” “ Spirit Messages from Rudolf
V alentino,” “ How I Became a Theosophist,” “ W hat I Find in Theo­
sophy,” “ Sacred F ire,” “ Discrim ination,” “ Reincarnation,” “ Life
SINGAPORE LODGE 191
after D eath,” “ Talism ans,” “ U nity in D iversity,” “ Theosophy and
Theosophical Society,” and some Thursdays were entirely devoted to
Questions and Answers classes, for the members, visitors and enquirers.
These attracted quite a num ber of interested people and it is a pleasure
to watch the slow but gradual growth of the fundam ental truths of
Theosophy among them by their attitude of mind and intelligent dis­
cussions which we encourage at the close of every lecture.
The Order of the Star in the East, under a separate organisation
having Bro. K . Subram anyam and Bro. T. Pakiry as the Representative
and Secretary are doing some good work. There are ten Star members
and two meetings were held on the 11th and 28th of every month.
Special meetings were held on the occasions of the W hite Lotus
Day, Dr. Annie Besant’s B irthday, The W esak Day, The Fifty-first
A nniversary of the T. S. and an invita:ion extended to Dr. R. Tagore
on 24th *Tuly, 1927, during his visit to Singapore at the Town Branch
where he was garlanded and a letter of welcome was read to him. He
replied in suitable words and expressed his sym pathy towards the
Society and our work for Universal Brotherhood.
Propaganda.— Being a small body of students the Committee gave
proper consideration as to the advantages and dangers of wielding this
weapon. W e should, therefore, exercise tact and careful measures
regarding this particular kind of work so as to avoid an overwhelming
tide of undue public criticism and ridicule. W hen our Lodge is
sufficiently strong to withstand this we will then carry out vigorous
items of the program m e. W e are satisfied for the present to enlist the
help of the local newspapers to publish from tim e to time short
announcements of lectures and the welcome to our Free Reading Room.
Pam phlets and summary of lectures arc distributed to enquirers. W e
are greatly indebted to the Hong Kong Lodge and Bro. H. E. Lanepart
for sending us copies of these pam phlets and lectures. On the 12th
September of the current year a free Short-hand Class was started under
this work and a number of deserving students have availed themselves
of this opportunity. Social function such as teas and picnics are
organised to create an atm osphere of practical brotherhood among
members and friends.
I regard the Library as a collection of silent and most patient of
propagandists and yet the most effective part of our work. It is still
192 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
far from adequate and I hope that any of our brothers and sisters who
have spare copies of any useful books for disposal will remember us.
Outlook.— It has been decided at a Committee M eeting to get up a
Theosophical Q uarterly M agazine in the course of the next year. Its
name shall be Rays of Truth. It will contain 80 pages or so of reading
m atter devoting chiefly to Theosophical or Universal subjects. If funds
are forthcom ing and all arc well we hope to bring out the first copy
by January next when we shall like to hear from prospective subscribers
and we now invite w riters for their co-operation by voluntarily sending
us from time to time any interesting article for publication. Please
address all correspondence re this to the Editor, Rays of Truth 3 B,
Finlay son Green, Singapore.
M ost Beloved President and Members of the Council, [ beseech
you to remind lecturers who are on their way out East, whenever
possible, to make a point to call at Singapore and give a series of
lectures on some fundam ental truths of the W orld Religion, for I
believe and can assure you that their trouble will not be in vain»
provided sufficient time can be given for public arrangem ents
Singapore has awakened to the im portance of general education
and every year hundreds of children are turned away sim ply because
there is no accommodation in the local schools. The Governor in Council
recently called attention to this great need. There is no reason why a
school— like the O lcott or Besant School—cannot be run in Singapore
even with profit as some of the private schools are doing here without
any outside help. W hat an opportunity awaits those who are keen on
educational work !
Closing this Report with my best fraternal greetings.

T.S. FEDERATION IN EGYPT
To the President) Theosophical Society.
I beg to send you with my devoted and respectful greetings the
Annual R eport of the activities of the Federation of the Lodges of the
Theosophical Society in E gypt for 1926-27.
A fter the storm y difficulties of the past, the year under review has
been quite calm and our members, although in small num ber, have been
busy working assiduously in an atm osphere of harm ony and brotherhoods
It looks as if we were entering into a new period of quiet work which*
T hope will bring, in time, good results. For the moment, all our
efforts consist in gathering the members who remained faithful to us,,
and organize them so as to have a strong although small centre to which
may be attracted those who need or value our teachings.
1 must state that in spite of our small membership, Theosophical
teachings are more and more known and appreciated in certain spheres
in this country.
In Cairo we have had regular Lodge and semi-public meetings
in French.
The President of the English Lodge, Mr. H am za Carr, has
created a small study class which is assiduously followed by a few
young E gyptians— future members in the m aking of our Society.
I feel I must congratulate specially here our brothers M r. Tewfik
Bey Diab and M r. Abou K hator for the beautiful result of their devoted
labour in achieving the translation into Arabic of the book At the Feet of
the Master which has just been issued. We trust that when this book
will be known by the public, its beneficial effect will be a great asset for
our work in this country. This precious jewel of guidance to the
spiritual life will help not only the Egyptian Musalmans, but also
those of their faith who road Arabic and are scattered in Asia, A frica
and elsewhere on the face of the earth.

1 94 THE GENERAL REPORT OK THE T. 8.
I am very glad to say that in A lexandria, under the intelligent and
active impulse o£ M r. and M rs. Suarfes and of M rs. D uckworth— to
whom T extend a fervent welcome on behalf of all of us— the year has
been very good ; the branch is prospering ; serious work is now being
done in spite of last year’s storm y conditions.
In Port-Said th e . Lodge’s activity is rather slack ; but its devoted
President and its Secretary are always there to receive and accompany
all those of our Leaders who cross the Canal of Suez.
N othing special to report about our isolated members in Suez
and K hartoum .
W e had this year the great pleasure of the visit of several
foreign members. W e have been honoured by the presence of
R t. R ev. G. S. A rundale and M rs. A rundale ; their stay of a few
hours am ongst us was precious. The activity, the Theosophical energy
which characterise Bishop Arundale, will have an echo here and will
help us in our task.
M r. Max W ardall, also visited us and delivered a very interesting
lecture.
M r. A. Pena Gil of Mexico stayed with us a couple of weeks.
O ur cordial thanks to these visitors for their help. Their
presence made feel a little more to our members that fraternity is a
tangible reality.

To the President, Theosopliical Society.
The chief event during the year 1927 has been for us the form ation
and organization of our Presidential Agency, created by D r. Besant
on M arch, 1927. »Since V irya Lodge was founded on the 1st June,
1904, under the auspices of the Chilean Section, we have been steadily
growing, till now we have 9 Lodges scattered in every country of
Central Am erica anti in Colombia, with 5 Centres of study which we
hope, in a very near future will be ready to have their Charters.
An especial Provisional Council has been appointed to supervise
the w'ork of our jurisdiction, and we are very glad to give the names
of its members :

The D raft of our Regulations have been published and we have
gathered the opinions of the various Lodges. Now a Commission is
sitting to draw its final form.
The Presidential Agent sends a m onthly letter to all Lodges as a
sort of personal link with them, in which he freely discusses the general
attitude of Theosophical students towards the big problems of life. This
devise seems to meet with a sreat deal of success.

Statistics.— There has been no new member during the period under
report, whereas, we have lost 3, Bro. A. C. H. Cross has resigned and
Bros. D. C. M utreja and Sat Bachan Singh have been put on the
dorm ant list and the Lodge dues as well as H eadquarter dues against
them have been w ritten off, thus leaving the nett membership on the
roll of 20 against 23 of last year.
Library.— As Bro. Ram Labhaya, Hon. Librarian, has had no time
of late, his report has also been included in the present one.
The total of books and pam phlets of all languages on 30th

202 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. 8.
Total num ber of books, etc., issued to members and sympathiser»
during the period under review is 56 against 66 of last year, which is
very discouraging considering the number of new books we have got
during this period.
Periodicals.— W e have continued subscribing to The Theosophist
besides which, Herald of the Star which had been subscribed for the
Lodge by Bros. (_■ . J. Patel and K ahan Chand K apoor for one year, has
been subscribed by the Lodge for the current year.
W e have been receiving Iheosophy in India gratis from the Indian
Section, T.S., for m any years past.
Propaganda.— N othing special has been done in this direction
except that we had purchased 25 copies of the Information for
Enquirers some of which have already been distributed.
W e have moreover sent 10s. paid by brother 0. M. Patel to S.A .
Section for 1,000 leaflets for propaganda purposes. These have not yet
boen received.
Executive Meetingsm
-^ N $ have had three Executive Meetings
during the period to conduct Lodge M eetings.
Lodge Regular Meetings. —U sual fortnightly classes as you all
know, have been held on 1st and 3rd W ednesdays each month. The
classes, as before, had been conducted by M rs. Best, but on the
completion of the book Life After Death it being proposed
that other members should also come forw ard and take some
active part, “ Evolution and Destiny of Man ” was started. Some
of the members having volunteered, they were allotted different
chapters of the book and had to come with their portion thorough­
ly m astered and express the same in their own words in about
half an hour, after the class had been opened by our Rev. Bro.
A. P . Best by reading a few lines from At the Feet of the Master, and
after the same had been m editated upon by the members present and
afterw ards explained by Bro. Best.
The meeting is being thrown open in the end for general
discussion on the subject under study. It should, however, be
recorded that it was always our President, Bro. A. P. Best, who
would elucidate all our difficulties. Attendance at the meetings
had not been discouraging considering the number of members in
Nairobi.

General.— W hite Lotus Day wasobserved as usual. As was
announced in our last report, Bro. K ahan Chand K apoor had been to
India last year and attended the Benares Convention.
A letter was received from the. N ational Society, T. S. inS . A., for
affiliation of our Lodge and it was passed unanimously in our Executive
M eeting held on 19th July last that “ As we have repeatedly tried our
best and have not been successful in receiving any m aterial help from
the H eadquarters, and owing to our Lodge being geographically in
one part of Africa, we will be on a better footing if this Lodge is
affiliated with the National Society in South A frica and thereby it is
likely that more inspiration will be received by way of propaganda and
lectures A Circular Notice was issued to all the members and all of
them being in favour of the affiliation, T. S. in S. A. was advised
accordingly.
Strange to say, when our Bro. Kahan Chand Kapoor had been to
Benares Convention, last year, he had explained our difficulties to
Bro. J. It. A ria, "Recording Secretary, he too, had suggested the
same thing.
The present book under 'study having been almost finished, it is
our earnest desire that the same scheme be followed as to our further
studies and more members should come forward and volunteer them­
selves for active part in the fortnightly meetings.
As M r. and M rs. Best are leaving for South A frica on long leave
during July next, no doubt we will miss them much but we earnestly
hope that members will make it a point to take more interest in Lodge
Affairs even from to-day so that, while away from East Africa, they
should rest assured that our young Lodge who own so much of it»

The Annual G eneral M eeting o£ this Lodge was held at the Lodge
Booms, Dintold Street, Bridgetow n, on the 28th July, 1927.
Since the last Annual M eeting, nam ely, on the 31st May last, a
great loss has been sustained by the Lodge through the death of our
esteemed President, M r. Edw ard D rayton. A special resolution refer­
ring thereto was passed, a copy of which accompanies this report to
H eadquarters.
At the last Annual M eeting the m onthly subscription was advanced
from 50 cents to f>0 cents and this has helped, together with the fact
that the members have been paving up fairly regularly, to keep us
clear of debt.
W e lost 4 members during the year, M r. D rayton and his wife, by
death, and thoir daughter, Miss Esther D rayton by her going to reside
in England, and another member J. I. Downie, who has also left the
Island, but there have been obtained 3 new members, so that our
num ber is now 19 local members and 2 non-resident members who live
at Grenada. An application for membership by M r. Fitz P atrick was
sent on to H eadquarters by M r. D rayton previously to his death, but
this diploma has not yet been received.
During the past year owing to illness our late President was
unable to deliver more than two lectures, but our V ice-President,
M r. G. C. W illiam s, filled the gap on three occasions, and his lectures
were well attended and much appreciated. As M r. W illiam s has been
appointed President for this year wo are hopeful of keeping up the
regular m onthly lecture, and our new V ice-President, M r. P. P. Spencer,
has promised to try and help, if necessary, but he is endeavouring at
present to get the members of the O rder of the Star into some sort of
w orking order.
To the President, Theosophical Society.
206 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. S.
A Study Class and Question and Answer Circle has been operating
successfully through the year.
O ur Secretary is on a visit to Canada and M r. Spencer, the Vice-
President, has undertaken in her absence to attend to the forw arding of
this report, which it is hoped will reach H eadquarters in due tim e.

CANADIAN THEOSOPHICAL FEDERATION
To the President, Theosophical Society.
The Canadian Theosophical Federation, in spite of the loss of
two Lodges, one by dissolution and one by transfer, is able to report a
net increase1 of membership and the chartering of one new Lodge.
Fifty-one new members were added to the rolls during the year, and at
the present tim e a m ajority of the Theosophists living in the central and
western parts of Canada belong to the Federation.
A number of pscudo-Theosophical and semi-occult organizations
have become active in Canada during the past year, but have failed to
draw on our membership, showing that as a whole our members are
really in earnest in the effort to make Theosophy a living power in
their lives and few are attracted by the offerings of spectacular short­
cuts to perfection.
Among the Lodges, H arm ony Lodge of London, Ont., deserves
special mention for having attained a 100 per cent increase of membership
during the year. Its twenty-one members now place it as the second
largest Lodge of the Federation, but a new lease of life in W ayfarer’s
Lodge of W innipeg under the recently assumed leadership of M rs.
Ethel Layton bids fair to make the race a close one during the next
twelve months. H erm es Lodge of Vancouver, with over one hundred
members, is the largest Lodge in the Society west of Toronto, and is carry­
ing on a large and varied program m e of Theosophical work. Krishna
Lodge of Calgary, reports activity in m any channels, such as The Star,
L.O.O., Co-M asonry, The Humane Society, Child W elfare, W orld
Peace, Anti vivisection, etc., indicating an attitude of intense appreciation
of the needs of hum anity. The members of Sirius Lodge, inspired and
lead by Jack Logie, have successfully conducted a Summer School
dealing with Theosophy and Allied Subjects, at Summ erland for two
208 THE GENERAL REPORT OF THE T. 8.
weeks during August. This is to be a perm anent organization and is
attracting considerable attention from non-Theosophists.
The N orthw est Federation of Theosophical Lodges, which includes
British Columbia, has this year begun the foundation of a perm anent
Theosophical Camp at “ Indralaya ” on Orcas Island, W ashington.
Twenty-six acres of land has been purchased. Plans for several weeks of
com munity life and instruction in Theosophy each year, have been
approved by practically all the Lodges in tht>, Northwest. It is expected
that members who attend the Camp at Ojai, California, will be able to
bring their messages and inspiration to those who find themselves
unable to make the longer trip and thus Indralaya will serve as a
secondary distributing centre.
The Federation has been unusually fortunate this past year in
having visits from M r. L. W . Rogers, M r. Edw. G ardner and Bishop
Arundale, General Secretaries in their respective countries, who gave
inspiring and instructive series of lectures, Rukm ini Arundale, Fritz
K unz, Dora Van Gelder K unz, M rs. Charles Hampton and D r. Nina
Pickett also gave lectures in Vancouver under the auspices of the
Federation. To all of these we wish to express our sincere appreciation
and our earnest desire that their visits be repeated many times in the
future.
Tho Canadian Theosophical Book Centre, with M r. Charles P otter
as M anager, was organized during the year and it is hoped that this will
serve as a means of gradually building up a thoroughly efficient book
business, a distributing centre for Theosophical books in Canada. The
H eadquarters of the Book Centre are in Vancouver, B.C.
An effort is being made to perfect plans whereby the Federation
m ay publish a small magazine. Our efforts will be very humble and
the magazine very unpretentious, but, it seems high time that the
Theosophical world be made aware of the fact that a large and active
section of the Theosophical membership in Canada is not in sym pathy
with intolerant and unbrotherly attacks on anyone, by the Theosophists
or otherwise, and is most em phatically engaged in sym pathetic support
of the leadership of our Revered President and her program m e.
May the tim e be not far distant when Canada may once more
welcome our Beloved Leader, and may she be among us many, many years.
The Federation looks forw ard to, and eagerly anticipates the time when
CANADIAN THE0S0PH1CAL FEDERATION 209
in the person of Jiddu K rishnam urti, the G reat Teacher, may pour H is
Message directly into the Theosophical centres in Canada. May such an
event be indeed close at hand. In the meantime we pray that our ears
and our hearts be alert and sensitive to the needs of m ankind, that
through us more help may be released to alleviate its ills.

To the President, Theosophical Society.
Greece, which was mentioned at the beginning of the history of
the Theosophical Society, has resumed its activity in June, 1923, when
a Lodge Plato was formed with the help of the T. S. in France.
The young and enthusiastic founders of that Lodge had to qver-
come m any difficulties. No m eeting-place, no members, no Library
for the study and teaching of Theosophy. Six months were needed
for organisation and the getting of new members.
Some members of the form er ‘ sleeping ’ Lodges Apollo and
Herm es, joined the founders of Lodge Plato and helped with great
seal.
Books were bought. M embers began to study so as to be able to
help others. M eetings took place regularly twice a month from
February, 1924, in the H all of the Society for Archeology at Athens.
The meetings were advertised in the papers and this publicity
resulted in interesting sonic inhabitants of the island Cypres. They
made enquiries at Athens and form ed a Lodge Zenon : meetings how­
ever only took place during one year and the Lodge is a sleeping
one now.
A t the end of 1924 two new Lodges were form ed: Athena at
A thens and Pythagoras in the Pyrcus. They have remained active.
The fourth Lodge B lavatsky-O lcott was formed in the Jubilee Year,
1925.
A t the end of November, 1925, M r. A. F. Knudsen, who was
passing through Athens added to the interest of our m eetings. W eekly
m eetings now take place.
The period 1926-27 has been full of activity. The Lodges did
good w ork and we aro happy to say that the Library now contains three
hundred volumes.
THEOSOPHICAL ACTIVITIES IN GREECE 2 1 1
W c succeeded in getting a new locality, containing three rooms
and a hall, so that we now have an office, a library and lecture room
besides the hall.
A new Lodge Orpheus must be added to the list.
W e look forw ard with confidence to the near future and we hope
to see the )oirth of another Lodge.

THE ADYAR LIBRARY
T H E A D Y A R L IB R A R Y
To the President, 'Jheosophical Society.
I beg to submit the R eport of the A dyar Library for the year 1927.
W hen the year began, Prof. P. K . Telang, M .A., LL.B ., was
officiating as D irector, and I was pro. tcm . A ssistant Director. Owing
to ill-health, P rof. Telang left A dyar and took up residence at Benares.
Then he found it inconvenient to discharge his duties efficiently from
that distance, and the Executive Committee appointed me as pro. tem .
D irector. I took charge of my new position on the 1st of M arch, 1927.
Prof. Tclang’s scholarship, ability and experience contributed to main­
taining the dignity of the D irector’s position, so well safeguarded under
all the previous D irectors, although Prof. Telang could not find time to
personally supervise the affairs of the Library except through occasional
visits. I now ofEcr my services to the Library with the hope that I will
be able to follow the path m arked out by my predecessors, steadily and
loyally.
In A ugust, 1927, the U niversity of M adras offered me the chair of
Sanskrit in the U niversity. Last year I was invited by the U niversity
to deliver a course of lectures, and this year they offered me a
perm anent post in the U niversity. I accepted that offer and I joined
duty on the 22nd of A ugust. From that day I began to serve the
A dyar Library as H onorary Director. Owing to the heavy work which
m y new appointm ent demanded of me in the U niversity, I found it
better to have a scholar to assist me in the Library, so that the efficiency
of the L ibrary may not be impaired through my inability to devote a
sufficiently long tim e in the Library, as I had been doing before.
Even before I was offered the Professorship in the University of
M adras, the Executive Committee had sanctioned the appointm ent of
an Assistant in the Library. So I recommended the name of M r. T. R .
Chintam ani for the post of an assistant in the Library, in the Eastern
216 T H E G EN ER A L REPO R T OF T H E T. S.
Section. He holds the Degree of B.A. Hons, of the M adras U niversity,
in Sanskrit, and after his graduation, he was a Research Student in the
U niversity for three years. He has studied Sanskrit at home, apart
from his U niversity Course, and he knows how to recite the Vedas
according to the orthodox method. The results of his researches in the
University for the last three» years, I have satisfied myself, is a valuable
contribution to modern Sanskritic Studies. He has studied Germ an
under me, and in various ways he has boon associated with me in my
scholarly activities after I came to A dyar. The Executive Com mittee
sanctioned my recommendation, and he began to work in the Library
from the 1st of Septem ber. His w ork has been very satisfactory. Ho
is assisting me in the publication of the catalogue of the m anuscripts.
M r. B. S. liam asubbicr, the A ssistant Librarian, was doing all the
office work of the Library under Prof. Tclang. Now he continues to do
the same work under my personal supervision. He is also engaged in
arranging the books in the-various rooms. He has been uniformly hard­
working and devoted to his duty in the Library. He has finished the
arrangem ent of the books in the Reading Room Section (the W estern
Section). The books arc re-arranged and numbered, and the whole
work is very artistically executed under the guidance of Dr. J. H.
Cousins. Now M r. Ram asubbier is engaged in arranging the books in
the main room of the Eastern Section. He follows the same plan as in
the W estern Section as suggested by D r. Cousins. The work is pro­
ceeding steadily and rapidly, and all the books will soon be arranged
in a very orderly way.
The arrangem ent of the books in the Eastern Section is a difficult
problem in comparison to that in the W estern Section. Proper
accommodation for the books is a m atter which is causing some anxiety
to me. The books are distributed in four different places. This makes
it much more difficult to give proper attention to the keeping of books
in safe and good condition. If books could be kept in a more compact
way, the attenders can dust the shelves, and the books kept in proper
condition and safety, much more easily than now. This m atter is
receiving my attention, and with proper guidance from the Vice-
President, I hope to be able to make some arrangem ent soon.
W hen the last R eport was subm itted, the first part of the catalogue
of the m anuscripts in the Library was ready foj the public. The
TH E ADYÀR LIBRA RY 217
printing of the second part was im m ediately taken up, and it is nearing
com pletion. It will be ready in a couple of months. Pandits T. Y.
Y enkataram a Sastri and T. tt. Seshadri Sarm a have been unsparing in
their work to revise the press copy of the catalogue. Pandit N.
Ram anatha Sastri was not keeping good health in the beginning of the
year, and I assigned to him various pieces of miscellaneous work. Now
he is in good health again, and he is engaged with Pandit T. V.
Y enkataram a Sastri in revising the final portion of the catalogue that is
now in the press. Pandit T. R. Seshadri Sarm a is now engaged in
registering Sanskrit books and m anuscripts, and w riting out the press
copy of the work that is next to be taken up for publication. In handl­
ing the manuscripts that are on a variety of subjects, and in revising the
press copy of the catalogue, the Pandits have shown a great width of
learning and a method in execution. A little more personal attention
from me would have avoided a few small lapses that have crept into the
catalogue. But as I was subject to very frequent attacks of m alarial
fever till July, I could not go through the press copy and the proof
sheets with the same care and attention that is needed. But all such
defects will be remedied in the form of a small appendix.
The A dyar Library has published four volumes of the M inor
Upanishads, along with tho com m entary of Upanishadbrahm avogin.
There still rem ain the Samny&sopanishad to be published with the
com m entary, though D r. F. 0 . Schrader has already published the text.
I wish to take up the publication of this part of the Upanishads soon
after the catalogue will be ready. W e have in the Library still
m anuscripts of over 75 Upanishads, not yet published and little known
to the world. The publication of these Upanishads also in some definite
order may be taken up in due course.
The year’s Collection of tnanuscripts comprises of those copied
from private owners and from the M adras G overnm ent O riental
M anuscripts Library. Our thanks are due to the C urator of this
Library for the facilities he has afforded in getting the m anuscripts
copied.
It is now some years since any organised attem pt was made by the
Library to search for new m anuscripts. The Library was in recent
years buying, or getting transcripts of, manuscripts that came in our
way. I wish to suggest that it would be very useful to send out a
28
218 TH B G EN ER A L REPO R T O P T H E T . S.
search party in Sooth India for a system atic collection of m anuscripts.
The party that was sent by the Governm ent M anuscripts Library has
prepared the way. 1 think that this year a party may be sent out by
this Library.
I subjoin a report by M r. Ramasubbier. the Assistant Librarian,
which gives details regarding the addition to the Library and the use
which the public have made of the Library. [ m ust also report to the
President that all the members of the Library staff have done very
satisfactory work during the year.
Our thanks are due to the curators of the Central Library, Baroda,
Sam skrit Publication D epartm ent, Trivandrum , Governm ent Oriental
Library, M ysore and M adura Tamil Sangham who have exchanged their
publications with ours, and to a few gentlemen who have presented
books to the Library.
Prof. Rudolf Otto of the M arburg U niversity, Germ any, came
to A dyar and stayed here as a guest of the Library for four days. The
other scholars also who visited the L ibrary have spoken highly of the
collection here and of the way in which the m anuscripts are kept. The
Library has a good reputation throughout the world. To maintain this
reputation, I think that a sort of socialisation is necessary. Our
resources are lim ited and we cannot make the collection up-to-date in all
the subjects. So it will be better to concentrate our attention on books
relating to ancient civilizations.

To the President, Theosophical Society.
The sixth lecture-session of the Brahm avidya Ashra
on October 3. The work of the session is notable in including a course
of synthetic studies of the W ill by various members of the Ashram a.
The course aroBe out of a suggestion from the Chohan K . H . to
M r. A. 0 . Hume in 1882 that a comparison of the teaching of
Schopenhauer and the A rhats on the W ill would be valuable. The
syllabus not only carries out this suggestion, but groups around it the
W ill-philosophy of the world. Good fortune brought a German
student, Fraulein S. Leidtke, this session who has presented Schopen­
hauer’s philosophy direct from the original. The sojourn of D r. and
M rs. H andy (of the Bishop Museum, H onolulu) at A dyar has enriched
the work and records of the Ashrama w ith exceedingly valuable contri­
butions. D r H andy has given a course of lectures on 44 Culture : Its
Life and Form s,” which amounts to an adjustm ent of ethnology (his
special professional subject) to Theosophical fundam entals. He has also
conducted a group-study of 44Theosophy and Science ”. M rs. H andy
has given a lecture-course on 44 The Dram a of the F uture,” and classes
in dram atic expression. Miss Barrie has begun a course in 44 Evo­
lutionary Psychology ” and Professor B. Kajagopalan in 44The G rowth
of H istory ” . Courses begun in previous sessions are being amplified
by other lecturers.
D r. Bcsant visited the Ashram a early in the session and emphasised
the desirability of each N ational Section of the Theosophical Society
sending a student to the Ashrama. M eanwhile, though numbers are
small at A dyar, the work is expanding from the centre to other parts
of the world. M r. A. de la Pena Gil, after three sessions at A dyar,
has founded branches of the Ashram a at M adrid and Barcelona on his
way homo to Mexico. Sim ilar groups are form ing in Finland, A ustria
and H olland.

To the President, Theosophical Society.
I have pleasure in subm itting to you a report on the activities of
the London Centre of the Theosophical W orld University at the end of
its first scholastic year (two term s only).
The policy that has guided U9 in our w ork has been to guard against
crystallisation into any form of institution. No definite academic
organisation has been attem pted ; no name given to our Centre except
that of “ affiliated Centre ” ; no title assumed by the director in charge ;
no regular staff appointed in the teaching or lecturing departm ent.
We have felt that our work lay especially in three directions :
1. To diffuse a true idea of what, as far as can bo known at
present, the T. W. U. w ill represent in the economy of the new
civilisation.
2. To give a scientific presentation of Theosophical knowledge,
thus tending to hasten the completion of fifth race science, and prepare
scientific minds for the science of the new age.
3. To gather together intuitive students and give them special
help.
1
The chief means devised for spreading the principles and aims of
the Theosophical W orld U niversity has been the Theosophical W orld
U niversity Association. Founded as a revival of the Theosophical
Fellowship of Education by M r. Baillie-W eaver in 1923, it has taken
new life with the opening of the London Centre and has spread rapidly
not only in G reat B ritain but also in Europe and the U nited States.
E ntirely independent of the T .W .U ., so as to leave full freedom to the
latter, it fills the same role as the various Associations for the
advancem ent of science in relation to the ordinary Universities. A
body interm ediate between the public and the T. W . U. for the diffusion
TH EO SO PH IC A L WORLT) U N IV ERSITY 229
of its culture, it has already servedits purposeby helping to organise
lectures given during a tour of the Provinces in Scotland in M arch
and in Sw itzerland in April, interesting University Professors and
students, inviting teachers and educationists, diffusing literature, etc.
The Association has spread rapidly abroad, so that Sectional
organisation has been possible in eighteen countries. Tn America it
numbers nearly one thousand members ; in France fivo hundred ; in
G reat Britain over six hundred. Teachers, not all of whom are
Thcosophists, join it because of the educational ideals it stands for, and
educational authorities evince signs of interest.
W ithin the Theosophical Society lectures on the T. W . U. are
continually being asked for by Lodges, and National Lecturers are
including them in their syllabuses.
A part from the regular courses at Brom pton Road (which are dealt
with in the next Section) lectures have been given by m yself on subjects
connected with the T r W . U. on thirty-seven occasions. Almost all
these lectures were public, the rem ainder to Lodges or private circles
(E. S. for exam ple).
The tour in England and Scotland (M arch, 1927) included lectures
in Liverpool, Colwvn Bay, M anchester, Birm ingham , Glasgow, Edin­
burgh, Bradford, Leeds, two or three meetings being held in each of
these towns. The most interesting feature of the tour was the op­
portunity afforded me, at Bradford, to give evidence before the
Educational Commission of the Independent Labour P arty, as a result
of which the members of the Commission expressed their intention of
basing their report on the Theosophical doctrine of education which I
had expounded.
In Liverpool a course of six lectures was arranged, and delivered
by me in one of the U niversity »Colleges, on 44The Psychology of Man’s
Evolution This has led to an invitation from the Institute for
Philosophical Studies in the U niversity to lecture before its members
next winter.
In Glasgow and Leeds the lectures I gave on 44The U niversity of
the New A ge” were presided over by U niversity Professors (in Glasgow
the Professor of Education) and delivered in U niversity Halls.
I also gave one of the official lectures on 46 The Psychology of
the New E ducation” at the Annual Conference of the N ational Union
2 30 T H E G EN ERA L R E PO ST OF T H E T. 8.
of W omen Teachers, a number of members afterw ards expressing,
through the Secretary of the Union, their wish to remain in touch with
our work.
I I
In the two term s (Spring and Summer) during which the Theo-
sophical U niversity Rooms have been open to students the regular
courses have comprised sixty-seven lectures. Three special gatherings
for students were also organised during vacations ; a week in January,
a fortnight in M ay and a week following the T. S. Convention in June.
A t the last two we were honoured in having as lecturers M r. Jina-
r&jadflsa, who gave three lectures on A ncient Sam skrit literature,
D r. Annie Besant who gave one on “ Sub-hum an and Human in Psycho­
analysis,” and D r. G. S. A rundale who gave two on “ The Real in
Education ”. M r. E . L._G ardner also lectured on “ Human Intuition
and Angelic Co-operation A num erous audience was gathered on
these special occasions, as shown by appended statistics.
The regular courses have been variously attended, the first term
more num erously than the second, the “ Fortnight ” and Convention
“ W eek ” whose program m es had been published before the opening of
the second term , having drawn some of the students from the ordinary
lectures.
It has seemed to us that in order to prepare the scientific mind for
the science of the new age it was necessary to complete that of the old,
i.e., to close the cycle of evolutionism by the inclusion in it of spiritual
man. Present-day psychology has found the true nature of man
to be spiritual. The law of spiritual evolution can therefore be
form ulated in scientific term s, i,£., the facts of that evolution can be
found in the field of phenomena known to and verifiable by science,
the plane of physical brain consciousness. W hen the unity of evolution
is com plete for the scientist, the science of the One Life can be accepted
and taught.
W ith the help of a few colleagues wo have outlined this psychology
of man’s evolution. It will appear in text book form . In course of
time this “ team work ” will, I hope, give increasingly good results, for
it will be difficult to dispute the value of a body of accurately described
TH EO SO PH IC A L W ORLD U N IV ER SITY 2 3 1
phenomena which are corroborated on several distinct lines of investiga­
tion. The Blavatsky Lecture of 1927 gives a brief outline of this
psychology.
In a series of talks given to a group of lecturers and teachers in
November and December we examined and discussed the all-im portant
subject of method, defining with as much precision as possible the
changes in outlook and method which the science of the One Life will
bring about in the main branches of learning. These talks also may
provide m aterial for a book.
It has seemed to me that the same degree of scientific accuracy
was not available in the realm of natural science as in the sciences
of man. The research work undertaken with the help of psychic
investigation by the scientific group already formed in London
could not, in my opinion, be given out publicly in the name of the
T. W . U. Until psychics are sufficiently trained to become reliable
44instrum ents 99of research, whose faculty can be checked by the ordinary
scientist, or until the scientist is him self a trained clairvoyant able to
check his own results and to form ulate verifiable hypotheses and laws,
the publication of such investigations would inevitably produce reactions
in scientific circles and raise unnecessary obstacles in the way of the
future Thcosophical U niversity. H ere again the circle of fifth-race
science has to be closed before the science of the new age can be taught*
W e hope our scientific colleagues will do this for non-hum an as it is
being done for human evolution.
Therefore, whilst not discouraging psychic research nor excluding
theoretical speculation on natural science by scientists versed in Theo­
sophy, we have confined ourselves to the sciences of man, in which far-
reaching results can be more im m ediately obtained, and I am happy to
note the enthusiastic co-operation of a group of colleagues. In such a
short tim e com paratively little could be done ; much rem ains for the
future. W e gratefully acknowledge the encouragem ent receivod from
Theosophical leaders, especially the G eneral Secretary of the T.S. in
England ; and we would also mention here the m arked interest of the
general public. The response of outside audiences, in Universities and
among the cultured public, has been even warm er than that of Theo­
sophical circles. The science of man’s spiritual evolution evidently
meets and satisfies the tendencies of the mind science and the first
2 3 2 TH E G EN ERA L REPO R T OF TH E T . S.
exigencies of the new intuition. I believe that in a short tim e, through
the work of this U niversity, furthered by the T .W .U . A., a solid found­
ation may be laid in the consciousness of the intellectual (ffite, on which
it will bo possible to build the science of the One Life.
I l l
The most im portant part of our work perhaps is the training of
students ; for this is the higher culture, the essential task of the U niver­
sity. A Tlieosophieal U niversity should train in them the faculty of
intuition, and it is doubtful w hether this can be done, even in an ele­
m entary way, unless it is applied to life as a whole and not only to
knowledge. This is only possible, we believe, in an Ashrama or
College, where students spend the greater part of the day.
The selection and training of students specially gifted in intuitive
powers is a necessity for this work, so that as in the course of tim e the
Theosophical educational'system is evolved there should be a staff of
trained teachers who can put that system into practice in the various
grades of affiliated schools as well as in the U niversity itself.
The tim e at our disposal has of course been too short for any record
of results to be possible, nor perhaps has our work yet attracted those
who will be the real students of the Theosophical W orld U niversity.

The Indian Section o£ the Theosophical W orld-U niversity
Association was form ed in January, 1927, for the dissemination of the
U niversity idea. I made a summer vacation tour from M adras to
K ashm ir and back and gave public lectures in a number of cities.
N early three hundred., members have joined the Association, and
correspondents have been appointed in the major cultural areas.
Communication is m aintained by circulars and pam phlets pending the

To the President, Theosophical Society.
General.— The number of institutions under the Trust are 11 as
against 12 last year, due to the rem oval of the Narm ada English School
at Shuklatirtli from the list of affiliated institutions and the closing up
of the M ontessori School and C raft Shed at A dyar and the addition
of the Theosophical School at Allahabad to the list of affiliated institu­
tions under the m anagem ent of a committee approved by the Trust
with M r. Sankara Saran as its energetic Secretary. There is an
application from a well established girls school at M angalore for
recognition and affiliation which has been favourably considered by
the Executive Committee of the Trust, in accordance with the resolution
of the Trust at its Annual M eeting last year, and it has to be finally
considered and sanctioned at the meeting of this year. The reports
of the various institutions may be summarised as follows :
Constituent Institutions.— National Theosophical School and College,
Adyar. The School has grown in num ber to 279 and the girls section
now consists of 74 girls. The Principal reports that the institution is
receiving a considerable amount of notice from the public and the
number of applications for admission is increasing every year.
Theosophical Collegiate School, Benares.— Though no report has
been received, the school has further established its reputation in
N orthern India and enhanced the reputation of the Trust.
The Theosophical National Girls' School and College, Benares.—
The Institution which is now under the able Principalship of
M rs. Padm abai B. Sanjiva Rao, reports satisfactory progress.
The National Girls' School, Madras.— The number of students
in the school is 270. Miss E . B. Noble, the Principal of the School,
has been away on sick leave and Miss Palm er has been the acting
2 3 6 T H E G EN ERA L R EPO R T OF T H E T . 8.
Principal. Miss Noble takes charge from January, 1928. As the
school is situated in a rich part of M adras, some effort should be made to
collect money from the parents of the girls receiving instruction, to
meet the deficit of the institution which amounts to Rs. 5,000 per year
and which is at present met by the Trust. The estimated assets of
the institution are Rs. 37,348-1-4.
The Theosophical College, Madanapalle.— The fourth year of the
B.A. Class was opened during the year and the College departm ent
has 160 students on the rolls. The num ber of students in the
school has not changed appreciably since last year. A girls’ hostel
with about a dozen students has been started during tho year.
The institution which is well known for its village activities and .other
aspects of social service, has further extended its work by digging
trenches for drainage and w atering the streets in the neighbouring
village. The Executive Committee, on a report from the Principal, has
decided to convert the schppl into an entirely residential one, in view of
the fact that the D istrict Board is desirous of starting a H igh School
under its management.
Affiliated Institutions.— The Theosophical School, Allahabad, reports
rapid developments during the year. It now owns 13 acres of land with
a big building and a small bungalow contained therein.
The Sanathana Dharma High Schooly Bhavnagar, reports very
satisfactory progress. The total number of students is 831.
The Maruna Gounder National G irls9 School, Coimbatore.— The
Principal reports that the school cannot be carried on under the present
circumstances of income and advises the school to be handed over to
the M unicipality— the ownership of the land and buildings rem aining
with the Trust. The Executive Committee is investigating the possibi­
lity of the future of the school.
The National Sindhi School, Hyderabad, reports satisfactory
progress in every way. The number of pupils in the institution is 105
including 11 girls.
The Shri Saraswati Pathasala, Kumbakonam, reports satisfactory
progress. The finances of the school are very precarious. The Executive
Committee has decided to take over the m anagement from the Committee
appointed three years ago and hand it over to a Committee of the local
Lodge of the T. S., which has promised to carry on the management of
T H EO SO PH IO A L ED U CA TIO N A L TRUST 237
the institution. The rough estim ated value of land and buildings, etc.,
is put down as Rs. 25,500.
Finances.— The donations this year were only Rs. 5,904-1-10 as
against Rs. 10,409-1-0 of last year and Rs. 29,169-15-2 the year
before last.
D uring the year the Secretary started a scheme called the Fifty
Rupee per year Fund with the idea of getting a Thousand such subscrib­
ers from the various parts of India, bringing in an income of Rs. 50,000
a year. It would be ample for the educational work of the Trust. B ut
in view of the special appeal made by D r. (.». S. Arundale, for the
Public Purposes Fund on behalf of the President of the Trust, the
scheme was held in abeyance and not pushed forw ard. If the Trust
approves of the scheme, it may be developed during the year 1928,
with the help of the members of the T rust in the various parts of India.
It may confidently be hoped that the scheme may succeed.
Finally I have to record here the passing away of Sir T. Sadasivier,
an honored member of the Trust, in the month of November this
year.

To the President, Tkeosophical Society.
“ Krishnftshram ” and the Theosophieal School which is housed
there, arose quite unexpectedly. The ambition of Allahabad Theo-
sophists a few years ago was no more than to have a small hall of their
own on a plot of land which, though beautifully situated, is only a
few hundred yards square. But, during the Jubilee Convention
K rishnaji showed us the vision of a strong centre, with much land
and numerous activities. We determ ined to do our best to materialise it.
In February, 1926, our venerable President visited Allahabad and,
knowing of K rishnaji’s wish, purchased a bungalow, with fourteen
acres of land, which was till recently the residence of a H igh Court
Judge, and is situated on the banks of the Ganges, a few minutes’ walk
from the Allahabad University and the Prayag Railway Station. The
property was form erly known as “ River View ” ; it has been re-named
“ Krishnftshram ” and has become the chief centre for all Theosophieal
and Star activities in Allahabad.
In November, 1926, a school for little children was started in these
premises, with eight children and two teachers— M rs. L. M. Pearco and
an Indian lady. A fter one year’s work we have nearly sixty children
and six teachers, one of whom, Miss Lisl H erbatschek, has come out
to us from D r. M ontessori’s own model school in Vienna. The public and
the press have been generous to us in their appreciation of the work
done and the school has received Governm ent recognition and a grant-in-
aid. There is a clamour for a Hostel, and, funds perm itting, we
shall have one soon, for we have with us M rs. N. G. Paranjpe and
her daughter Miss Anasuya Paranjpe, who have had experience of
such work in Cawnporo and M adras.
K R I9H N A SH RA M î? 239
In A pril, 1927, over tw enty acres of land adjoining the ashram
was for sale. One of onr members acquired this plot, in the hope
that some day it m ight be needed for the further development of
this growing centre, and onr President has perm itted the land to be
named “ Y asunta V atik a” in her honour. It is probable that other
extensive plots in the neighbourhood will be added to the estate as
tim e goes on.
ii»3?W hatever success has been achieved is duo to the inspiration
received from K rishnaji and the constant encouragem ent and financial
support of D r. Besant. We only pray that we may prove w orthy
of the trust reposed in us, and that this undertaking may really become
a centre of force for the achievement of the motto of the school,
“ Live Nobly ” .

( From. 16th December, 1926 to 15th Deccmbet, 1927)
To the President, Theosophical Society.
I have the honour to submit the following brief U eport of the O lcott
Pancham a Free Schools for the year ending l5tli December, 1927.
This year it falls to my lot to report on the work of the only two
schools now left with us.
Though the garage in the H .P .B . M emorial Free School was
converted to a class room last year, yet it was a problem to make
adequate provision to accommodate all the classes. On the first of
October last we opened a now thatched shed with pucca flooring, thus
m aking room for one more class. As stated in the last year’s R eport,
much of the congestion in the O lcott Free School was relieved by the
addition of the three thatched sheds. B nt later we found that the main
building itself, being very old, is in a dangerous condition, liable to
collapse at any tim e. Hence M r. A. Schwarz suggested that we m ight
pull that down and erect a new one in its place. The cost of the new
structure is estim ated to about Rs. 2,300 and the Governm ent has
sanctioned the grant of half that am ount, provided we can meet the
other half.
D uring the past year under report, the schools continued to be
carried on efficiently as in previous years. In one of the Inspection
Books, we find the rem arks “ General condition continues to be
efficient ” and “ this is one of the best schools in this range, if not in
this district
The daily attendance of the pupils has been fairly satisfactory
though the num ber of pupils on the roll in the H .P .B . M emorial Free
School has fallen down this year due to a larger num ber, than usual, oi
the elderly children being taken away by their parents to help them in
earning their livelihood.
TH E OLCOTT FANCHAM A FKKK SCHOOLS 241
ii Personal hygiene is receiving particular attention. N ecessity
for this is being explained both by precepts and exam ples.” • The
A dyar Baby W elcome Institution is of a very welcome help to the
O lcott Free School in this respect. Bathing is made compulsory in our
schools. The health of the teachers also has been fairly good through­
out the year. One of our very able lady-teachers had to leave us in
November, because of the close proxim ity of her motherhood.
Instruction in the three IPs and other allied subjects has gone on
steadily as in previous years. W e had a two days’ Conference of our
teachers in Septem ber and revised the scheme of studies trying to suit it
to our children. The few artistic and manual subjects like different kinds
of drawing, leaf work, clay-m odelling, and sewing are receiving due
attention. The arts and crafts competition which we had in connection
with our President’s last birthday was a novel experiment in our insti­
tutions. Lt. was a pleasure to observe the keenness and enthusiasm the
children evinced then. All the children took part in this and enjoyed
themselves thoroughly. Now the children are showing greater interest
towards those subjects. Spinning and weaving classes are doing good
work under the supervision of our untiring worker, Sri Pernm tna,
“ who is free both with her purse and service ” . In this connection our
thanks are due to our good friend M r. C. N. Subrahm anya Iyer for
enabling us to carry on these classes by his m onetary help. Here
I may mention that in the Youth W eek A rts and Crafts Exhibition
held in January last, both of our schools were recipients of a silver
medal and a certificate of m erit each from the hands of the Hon.
M r. A. Ranganntham , the O lcott Free School for leaf work, spinning
and weaving, the H .P .B . Memorial Free School for the different kinds
of drawing and clay-m odelling.
Seventeen of the pupils, who have passed out of our schools are
helped to prosecute their higher education.
The daily distribution of midday food remains a necessity for the
children.
The gardens could not be properly m aintained because of the lack
of water facilities, the wells getting dried up and w ater being scarce.
In my last R eport a mention was made of a donation of about 900
yards of cloth for our Amina’s birthday. They were converted into
kurtas and the children were given two each, one on the 8th of
•31
2 4 2 TH E G EN ER A L REPO R T O F T H E T . S.
Novem ber, 1926, and the other on the 24th of January this year. Once
again we have received 400 yards of cloth. W e have yet to find the
money to meet the tailoring expenses.
17th of February, our beloved Colonel’s Day, was a day of
im portance to our schools. The teachers and the children had sports
on the occasion, when useful prizes were given. A fter the sports and
games, eatables were distributed to the children.
On the 3rd of M ay, the schools celebrated the great Shivaji
M aharaja’s terqentenary birthday. A fter the function was over, sweets
and fruits, which were kindly sent to us by the B irthday Committee,
were distributed to the children.
D uring Septem ber, a three days’ trip to the Seven Pagodas was
arranged for the teachers, to foster a spirit of unity, happiness and
service am ongst them . I wish we could arrange more such camps.
The children very sadly lack this enjoym ent of the open-air cam p-life,
which is the main essence of Scouting. So far they had only one or
two afternoon hikes. It will be of very great help in their character
building and removing a lot of their “ depressedness,” if we could find
means to take them out and give them the benefits of open-air camp
activities. I believe that the original idea w ith which Scouting was
started by the Chief Scout was to help m ainly the children of the slums.
Am ina's B irthday was a source of great happiness and joy to the
children. They were very active with their processions, bhajanas,
m eetings, variety entertainm ents, sports, arts and crafts com petitions
and camping, these activities covering over two or three days. On the
night of 1st of October, the children of the O lcott Free School
entertained about 500 villagers of the neighbouring parts with a dram a
and other variety items. On that day a new shed was opened by Miss
M. W . B arrie at the H . P . B. M em orial,Free School. One small fact
I am tem pted to mention here. In response to a letter of D r. G. S.
A rundale in the Theosophy in India, giving suggestions as to how to
celebrate our President’s Birthday, the children and teachers of our
schools could not restrain the expression of their deep love and
gratitude for the M other. They collected from am ongst themselves a
sm all am ount of money and subscribed to the P resident’s Public
Purposes Fund, the am ount though very small, but a token of their
hum ble love.
T H E OLCOTT PA N CH A M A FR E E SCHOOLS 2 4 3
Both the teachers and children had the great privilege of giving
reception to their beloved Amina and K rishnaji on their return to A dyar
on the 31st of October. One may be sure the happiness they felt that
day when they had those two persons once more in their midst after a
long interval will rem ain w ith them for many a day to come.
Every attem pt is made to make the children feel free and joyous
and the school a place of happiness for them. Every step is taken to
make the teachers render their duty in a spirit of love and service and
work for the dispersion of the “ depressedness ” and for the happiness
and cheerfulness of the children.
D uring the period under R eport, I have missed very much the
valuable help and advice of our good friend M. R . tty. C. N.
Subrahm anya Iyer who was away from A dyar in the interest
of his health since January last. I hope now that he has returned,
he will soon take his part once again in the work of our schools.
In conclusion I offer my grateful thanks to ¡Sister Peram m a, who is
actively helping me and to M r. A. Schwarz for the loving help he has
been giving me throughout.

O ur balance-sheet for the financial year ending 31st M arch, 1927,
shows a small deficit of Rs. 236-0-3, as follows :

As three of our schools were taken over by the Corporation of
M adras on January 1st, 1926, the year under review had to deal with
the rem aining two schools only, the “ O lcott Free School,” A dyar, and
the “ H .P .B . M emorial School ” in Kodam bakam , and gives an indi­
cation of our financial requirem ents in the future. According to the
particulars shewn on “ Incom e and Disbursem ent Account ” the cost of
running these two schools amounts approxim ately to Rs. 7,500 per
annum, against which we may count on a regular income of :
Rs. 2,000 from Grants-in-Aid,«
,, 1,250 ,, Interest on our Endowm ent Fund,
3,250,
leaving a balance of Rs. 3,750 to Rs. 4,000 to be covered by donations.
It is satisfactory to note that Grants-in-Aid have risen from
Rs. 1,6 49 in 1925-6 to Rs. 2,150 in 1926-7, a sign of efficient w orking
and of appreciation by the Governm ent Educational D epartm ent.

The falling off in donations is to be regretted and still more
the fact that contributions from India amount to less than one-third of
the am ount received, over tw o-thirds coming from European and
American sources.
In addition to our ordinary expenditure a sum of Its. 1,250 to
Its. 1,500 will have to be spent during the current year for reconstruct­
ing the building of the Olcott Free School at Adyar, which, after having
served for thirty years, is in a state of collapse. If funds perm it, it is
also desirable to build another schoolroom at the H. P. B. Memorial
School, the existing accommodation having become insufficient.
Our financial requirem ents for 1927-8 are roughly as follows :

Help is urgently needed and we close this R eport with an earnest
appeal for continued support of these deserving institutions.

To the President, Theosophical Society.
Once more I have the pleasure of reporting a substantial gain in
membership, the increase for the year am ounting to 107, giving us a
total of 50 K nights and 262 Squires, Companions and Pages ; and whilst
the greatest increase has been in Sydney and its suburbs, due mainly to
your own presence there, it is pleasing to note that almost every centre
shows some increase in membership ; and in addition our O rder has been
established in 5 new Centres, viz.— in Gosnells, W . A. and in
K uring-gai, Mosman, M arrickville and W illoughby, N .S.W .
In Adelaide, very real and consistent work has been done for the
T. S. Lodge, whilst assistance has been given to the Dram atic Croup,
help given with a Concert in aid of one in need, and much work done
for the “ All Nation Chum M ovement,” a kind of Junior League of
Nations, besides the holding of many happy gatherings. In the suburb
of Rcdfern, the necessity of character building on the part of members
has been stressed.
Brisbane reports a year of steady work. The Dram atic Group pro­
duced two Plays, the net proceeds of £16-5-0 being handed over to
the Children’s Playground Association ; one of the Plays being after­
wards broadcasted for the general benefit of listeners-in. The Group of
Servers continues to prepare the Lecture room for the Sunday evening
meetings, arranging the flowers, taking up collections, assisting the
O rder of the Star, etc., whilst the K nights have taken charge of the
Lotus Circle, and the Round Table, as a whole, gave great assistance at
the L. C. C. Fete, besides making a donation of £1 per month, and
individual members helped with the work of the T. S. Lodge, in various
ways, and assisted outside organisations to a great extent.
Launceston reports a very successful year, much time being given
to preparation for a Fair in aid of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, for which the sum of £20 was raised.
In M elbourne, work for the Order of the Star and the T. S.
Lodge has gone on steadily, and again, in honour of the birth­
day of our revered Protector, Dr. Annie Besant, a gift ol
TH E ROUND TA BLE IX A USTRALIA 251
¿16, together with a large number of garments, the work of
members’ own hands, was made to the Free K indergarten. During
the year three very successful Parties were held, in order to give
K nights and Companions an opportunity of introducing their outside
friends and, at the same time, of getting more intim ately acquainted
with each other. The last, being a Fancy Dress affair, at which a Short
Play w ritten by a member, was most successfully produced, was
generally acclaimed as the best gathering ever held.
In Perth, much work continues to be done for the T. S. Lodge,
and kindred movements, many of the members holding office and
generally working therein, whilst they arc now hard at work in prepa­
ration for a Play to be given shortly, in aid of the 46Active Service
Fund ”. A ¡Special meeting was held in commemoration of Dr. Bcsant’s
birthday and a gift of money made in her honour to the Children at the
Parkerville Home. Perhaps the outstanding feature of the year’s work
was the form ation of a new Centro at Gosnells, giving great promise
for the future.
In Sydney, again great progress lias been made, and the energies of
the members of the Blavatskv Lodge Table are now being turned in various
directions. A group scheme of specialised work and study has been
organised, including Dram atic, Scientific, Social Service, A rt-Expression
and K indergarten Groups, from which much is expected in the future.
During the year the sum of £ 10 was given to the F ar W est
Seaside H ealth Mission, thus enabling a number of children to be given
a fortnight’s holiday at the Sea ; whilst great attention is now' being
given to the helping of the “ Active Service Fund
New Tables have been formed at Mosman and a t M arrickville, but
no details are yet to hand.
The K uring-gai and W illoughby Tables report an increase in
Membership, and being now firmly established, give every promise of
successfnl wrork «and activity in the future.
W ith hearty greetings to you, our valued Senior K night, to our
beloved Protector, and to all our fellow-members throughout the W orld,
in the hope that our O rder may continue to grow in strength and useful­
ness and thus become of increasing service.

To the President, Theosophical Society.
The O rder this year, as in past years, has continued its usual
services to various departm ents of the Theosophical Movement. The
chief contribution is to the work of education, the principal workers
in the Theosophical College and Schools in India being members of
the O rder. As the O rder pays subsistance allowances to the workers
in education, it is obvious that, if the donations fall in amount, the
O rder is seriously handicapped. The quiet unobtrusive work done by
the Brothers of the highest grade is best known to the B rother
Server herself, who always gives her warm est praise to the work of
the Order.

Secretary.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L F E L L O W S H I P I N A R T v S A N D C R A F T S
To the President, Theosophical Society.
A very prom ising sign during the year has been the springing up
of num bers of small Groups and Centres, each with their own independ­
ent and often original activity, and a record of initiative and enthusiasm.
The num ber of enquiries for lists of plays, books, or music to help in the
work of allied activities has also increased, while many members have
done valuable work in connection with other organisations, inspiring
them to carry out program m es of idealistic type.
Books and music added to the L ibrary during the year include
both the work of artist members and m aterial for helping beginners to
acquire the technique they need for freedom in expression. The most
im portant Art as Will and Idea by the President of the fellowship,
M r. (-. Jinarfljad&sa, has been widely studied by members, increasing
their understanding of the place and im portance of their work. Several
countries and Centres have had the privilege of a visit and a lecture
from him.
[n order to avoid overlapping, it has been decided to incorporate
the Fellowship in the re-organised Theosophical O rder of Service, as
the nucleus of its art section, and to facilitate the arrangem ents, the
activities of the past year are briefly indicated in the countries represent­
ed. The activities of the fellowship can be gauged by the work done
in the various countrios.
Australia.— Several members have taken part in the M id-day con­
certs, in broadcasting, and in arranging music for Theosophical meetings.
Austria.— The V ienna A rt Lodge continues very active, including
most of the arts in its work, while F rau A uner’s musical work for the
schools, now including other musicians, is still extending its field of
influence.
Belgium.— O riginal musical and dram atic productions. A G reek
play has been translated into English, and music performed*in England
as well as in Belgium .
254 TH E GEN ER A L REPORT OF TH E T. S.
Bulgaria.— M eetings ami exhibitions in collaboration with the
leading artists of the country.
Czechoslovakia.— Illustrated on art and concerts.
England.— In London, entertainm ents were arranged at M ortim er
H all for two Christmas parties, and a program me again organised for
January lltli at Kings wav H all, including participation by the
audience in several wavs. Music before lectures and community
singing was arranged for Convention, Mr. Butler conducting, and a
m eeting w as'held at which M r. Jinarfljadflsa was to speak, but being
unfortunately prevented by illness, Professor M arcault very kindly
took his place, with the Secretary in the Chair. Much interest was
aroused. Blavatsky and St. John’s Wood Lodges have1 combined or
community singing, and the Baysw ater A rts Lodge continues its regular
lectures on art, often with dem onstrations, and organises dram atic
entertainm ents at M ortim er H all, preceded in the new session by
community singing.
In the Provinces there arc sixteen Centres, most of which have
been visited by Miss W arner, and they include three m ystery dram a
groups, four Lodges organising regular com m unity-singing, four with
special music before lectures, three exhibitions, one producing opera,
one with speech-training and two with handicrafts classes, a crafts
depot, and several members giving single lectures or courses with
illustrations, on the different arts. In M anchester two members have
founded a Club with several arts activities, including M r. W roblewski’s
Creative Thought Class.
Egypt.— Mr. H. Carr's work is of great interest, and has recently

To the President, Theosophical Society.
The w ork of the Association has not been specially pushed during
the year. M r. Abdul K arim , Forest Officer in the Presidency of
M adras, utilised his leave to make a long tour in the north visiting
various Theosophical Lodges, and addressing public meetings to explain
the broader attitude that Theosophists have towards the problem of
Islam . He was welcomed everyw here, and his work has undoubtedly
strengthened the objects of the Association. Sim ilar work has been
consistently done by Bro. H . C. K um ar. His report is appended,
giving the history of''the inception of the Association and also the
record of his work.
Genesis.— At the Convention of the Theosophical Society held at
A dyar in December, 1922, a proposal was made that the Theosophical
Society should persuade its Lodges in India to study the great faith
of Islam in the same sym pathetic way in which they had been studying
H induism , Buddhism and C hristianity, and to lay the results before
the public. A small Committee was appointed to form ulate a scheme.
The Committee subm itted its suggestions in due course, and these
were circulated to the Lodges through the Sectional Organ, Theosophy
in India. A t the Convention of 1923, the V ice-President, M r. C.
Jinarftjadasa, M .A. (Cantab.), who had evinced a keen interest in the
movement from its very inception, todk down the names of people who
offered to join it as members and promote its object, and a T.S. Muslim
“ L eague” was form ally started with N aw ab A. H ydari of H ydorabad-
Deccan, as President, and the General Secretary of the Indian Section
as ex-ojficio Secretary.
Beginnings.— During my stay at A dyar in 1923—24, as a scholar
of the Brahm avidya Ash ram u— the nucleus of the T.S. W orld U niver­
sity— I devoted myself to the study of Islam with a view to qualify as
T.S. M USLIM ASSOCIATION 257
a worker of the T.S. M uslim Association, and on my way back to
Sindh gave lectures on Islam at Chhanapatanam , Hubli and Poona,
and the first Islam ic Study Circle was started at the last named place.
On return to Sindh, similar lectures were given and study Circles
established at Karachi and H yderabad. Later, I made a tour of
R ajputana and several places in the Punjab, and gave Islam ic lectures
in Jodhpur, Ajm er, Lahore, Ludhiana and other towns. The lecture
at Lahore took place at the great Islam ia College under the chairm an­
ship of (now) Sir Abdul Qadir, and was reported verbatim in The
Muslim Outlook.
At the Convention of the T.S. held in Bombay in December, 1924,
it was resolved to change the name “ League ” to “ Association 99m
Progress.— In 1925, I made an extensive tour in the Punjab and
the western districts of the United Provinces, lecturing on various
aspects of Islam and arousing considerable interest. These lectures
were reported in both The Tribune and The Muslim Outlook of
Lahore, and brought from the A njam an-i-H im ayat-i-Islam of Lahore
an invitation for a lecture at their anniversary gathering, but as the
dates of the anniversary clashed with my other im portant work, I had
to forego the pleasure of accepting it.
Then came the Jubilee Convention of the Theosophical Society in
A dyar, and as a recognition of the place of Islam among the B rother­
hood of religions, a plot of land was set apart for a mosque in the
Theosophical estate, after the model of the famous Pearl Mosque at
A gra, and the foundation-stone was duly laid according to Islam ic
rites. This work now awaits completion at the hands of the well-wishers
of Islam.
The Convention of 1926 at Benares took another im portant step
forw ard which intim ately concerns the T.S. Muslim Association. It
was resolved at this Convention th a t:
Whereas the two great faiths of India, Hinduism and Islam, are
united in teaching the two great essentials of the Fatherhood of God
and the Brotherhood of Man, and whereas, whatever differences there
may be in modes of worship, the two religions are really supplementary
to each other, and whereas the future of India lies in a cordial and
fraternal co-operation of Hindus and Mussalmans,
This Convention of the Indian Section of the Theosophical Society
makes a special appeal to its members to take an active part in the
33
258 TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OP T H E T. 8.
restoration of harm onious and brotherly relations between the tw o
com m unities by insisting on the absolute identity of the true interest
of the two faiths and the two peoples.
In order to translate it into practice, I at once undertook a tour
o£ the U. P., visiting Ghazipnr, M irzapur, Allahabad, Oawnpur, Agra,
Gwalior, Jhansi, A ligarh, K hurja, M oradabad, etc., giving lectures to
the public aiul the student community on the broad teaching of Islam
and the life of the Prophet. The lectures at the great M uhammadan
University at A ligarh were most cordially received. M r. Abdul Karim
later undertoik a more extensive tour with the same object, covering
alm ost the whole ol' India, and putting the truths of Islam in an
absolutely new light for the edification of both H indus and Muslims.
In Septem ber, 1927, the General Secretary of the Indian Section,
T.S., as Secretary of the T.S. Muslim Association, sent round a circular
urging all T.S. Lodges to observe the birth-anniversary of the Prophet,
M ohamad, in a befitting m anner. This was done with good results
at most Lodges.
Immediate Work.— The w ork before the Association, therefore
resolves itself into three main divisions :
1. To study Islam ic religion and culture in the Spirit of a student
of Comparative Religion, and place the results before the public.
2. To carry into effect the Resolution of the 1926 Convention,
so far as possible.
3. To collect funds for the completion of the A dyar Mosque.
Membership.— Every one, Theosophist or not, having sym pathy
with the above work, and willing to promote it in one or more ways
indicated above, is earnestly requested to become a member. There are
no fees for membership, but any voluntary contribution will be gratefully
received and utilised for the purpose for which it is given.

To the President, Theosophical Society.
It is gratifying to report that there has been much improvement
in the w ork of the Association in the year under review, and that
the Jew s are taking more and more interest in the Theosophical and
Star movements with a distinct increase of Jew ish membership in the
Society.
The S tar Congress of 1927 at Ommen had an exceptionally large
attendance1 of forty Jewish members who came from various parts
of Europe : Italy, A ustria, Czecho-Slovakia, Poland, Roumania, Egypt,
Holland, Belgium , France, and England, thus giving an opportunity
to the President of the Association, who was present there, to deliver
at one of the meetings an inspiring address on the genius of the
Jew in the art of Synthesis. These meetings are likely to result in
the formation of Sections in those countries which have not already'
got them.
America. —M r. H enry C. Samuels and his loyal colleagues are
carrying on our ideals in miiny possible ways, such as, publishing a
magazine and pam phlets, holding study' classes, delivering public
lectures, and speaking before various Jew ish organizations in some of
the large cities of the U .S.A . M r. Samuels has further undertaken the
task of w riting a Jewish catechism to acquaint non-Theosophi?t Jew s
with the Theosophical thoughts embodied in their sacred scriptures.
England.— M r. S. I. Heiman, our National Representative in
England, writes that the work is favourably" progressing there, and
that the number of Active and Associate members has risen during
the year from nine to thirty. Study groups have been organised in
London and M anchester, and public lectures were delivered with great
success. In addition to the distribution of literature, a Section L ibrary
has been opened.
260 T H E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF T H E T . 8.
India•— Progress is very slow on account of its small membership.
Large num ber of Theosophist Jew s in K arachi and elsewhere have
not yet chosen to join ns and help us in our movement.
Synagogue.— The funds of the A dyar Synagogue are still very low*
m aking it impossible for us to start the building. In spite of our
constant appeals, the collections made during the year did not exceed
R s. 800 which, added to the R s, 1,800 previously announced, makes
a total of R s. 2,600.
Criticism has been all throughout showering upon us from
orthodox Jew ish quarters in the W est as well as in the East. This
had the beneficial effect of giving wide publicity to our existence, and
affording a good opportunity to some of our enthusiastic members to
explain in the press our position as being not that of a new cult in
Judaism , but rather that of an International group of students of
occultism who are striving to bring to light the jewels of wisdom
hidden in the pages of the Jew ish lore.
D uring the year a'inessage was given to Hebrew Thcosophists by
our revered President, D r. Annie Besant, and an article was contributed
to our magazine by our beloved V ice-President. Both have been, and
will ever rem ain, a source of inspiration and strength to our movement.
W e always receive w ith deep gratitude and reverence all words of
advice com ing from our Leaders to guide us along the path of service
and helpfulness, m aking our movement a w orthy channel of transm it­
ting the Divine Truth enshrined in the Theosophical teachings to the
members of our race and to the w orld at large

FOB THE YEAR 1926-27
To the President, Theosophical Society.
Membership.— The Society ha<l at the close of the year 130 members
with 764 shares and a paid up share capital o£ Rs. 3,022-9-1, the
increase during the year being 26, 167 and Rs. 671-15-7 respectively.
As the maximum num ber of shares, rtz., 800, sanctioned for the Society
having been very nearly reached, the num ber was raised to 1,000 shares
with Rs. 5,000 share capital and the same was approved by the
Assistant R egistrar of Co-operative Societies.
The total transactions of the year amounted to Rs. 10,098-14-0
against Rs. 8,560-8-3 in 1925-26 and Rs. 2,848-7-10 in 1923-24, which
is very satisfactory. Almost all the loans given are repaid r.egularly.
The num ber of R ecurring Deposits increased from 5 to 13 and
the am ount outstanding at the close of the year was Rs. 309-3-6 against
Rs. 78 of previous year. These figures show that the Society is very
much liked by the members.
D uring the year the Co-operative stores was opened by the kindness
and help of M r. C. Jinarfljad&sa, V ice-President, T .S., but owing to
our limited income, most of us, were not able to take advantage of it as
the sales were restricted only to cash purchasers. Seeing our help­
lessness in the affair, 9 of our influential members came forward to
help us and took out a loan of Rs. 700 from the Credit Society and
deposited the amount in the “ Stores ” on our behalf as a trade deposit,
so that within its security we m ight get our supplies. As this amount
is found insufficient, arrangem ents are now being made by them to raise
the deposit am ount to Rs. 1,500 for which we wish to express our
gratitude to them for their tim ely help.
262 T H E G EN ER A L R E PO R T O F T H E T. S.
In conclusion we pray to God that we may, by our service, prove
ourselves w orthy of the help and fostering care bestowed on us by the
President and V ice-President of the T.S.

JVo. <i. 718 for 1926—27
To the .President, Theosophical Society.
Birth of the Stores.— The T.S. Employees’ Co-operative Credit
Society had been working for 6 year9. W hile it satisfied the needs of
Co-operative Credit, the greater want of the employees in the m atter of
finding the necessities of life still remained to be met. W hen it assumed
proportions, the question of the “ Stores ” was taken up for serious
consideration by M r. C. Jinarftjadflsa, V ice-President of the T.S., at
the request of the T.S. Em ployees’ Co-operative Credit Society as per
Resolution passed at its G eneral-Body m eeting held on 8-8-1925.
The m atter was pushed through and the “ Stores ” was started on the
2nd July, 1926.
2. A fter some correspondence with the Co-operative D epartm ent
and personal explanation, the “ S to re s” was sanctioned and the form al
resolution, incorporating the Society, was passed at a General-Body
m eeting held on 24-11-1926 and the opening was celebrated in tho
presence of the Dy. R egistrar of Co-operative Societies, M r. C. Jina-
rftjadflsa and others.
3. The Society started with 38 members and has now 128 with a
paid-up capital of Rs. 1,670. •
4. The stock of provisions bought during the year amounted to
Rs. 21,627 and the sales to Rs, 20,830. The stock on hand on the 30th
June, 1927, was w orth Rs. 1,917.
5. The expenditure on establishm ent, contingencies, etc., amounted
to Rs. 607 a very m oderate figure, having regard to the extent of
transactions.
Financial Position.— The assets on the last day of the year amounted
to Rs. 2,939 and the liabilities to Rs. 3,848. The apparent loss was
264 TH E G EN ER A L R EPO R T OF TH E T. S.
thus Its. 909 for the year ; apparent because Rs. 814 were spent on
buildings and equipm ent the initial non-productive outlay. The real
loss reduces itself therefore to a small sum of Rs. 95 and such a result
must be considered quite satisfactory having regard to the well-known
difficulties experienced alm ost invariably in the initial working of
“ Stores ” .
The Future.— The object for which the “ Stores ” were mainly
started has not however been attained. In the first month several
employees came forw ard to purchase provisions but subsequently dropped
off one by one. The reason is not far to seek. They wanted credit and
could not by habit and tradition, avoid going for it. The result was
they sought their old suppliers, so much so, that the transactions of the
“ Stores ” wore practically lim ited to certain resident families and insti­
tutions, It was not until last month, that is— after the close of the year,
that they came back to the stores for purchases by a new course adopted
for helping them w ith tem porary credit Nine influential members came
forw ard with a deposit'of Rs. 700 so that those, whom they can trust,
can get their supplies under “ Trade Deposit ” System.
It is a m atter for satisfaction that the working first of the
“ Credit Society ” and now of the “ S to res55 am idst difficulties has
given birth to the dawning of the fundam ental ideas of co-operation in
our members, specially in the cultivation of m utual trust and under­
standing in the, till now not very united classes of our employees.
It is this spirit of m utual help that has made possible the coming
forward of nine of them to take the cause of their poorer brethren
in furtherance of the co-operative ideal.

R e s o lv e d .—That the words “ Fellowship of Faiths ” be substituted
for the “ World Religion ” in the statement entitled “ The Basic Truths
of Religion” printed on page 327 of the T. S. A n n u a l R e p o r t of 1925,
and tbc same be reprinted as follows :
T h e B a s ic T r u t h s o p R e l ig io n
Theosophy, the Divine Wisdom, is the root of all the great religions,
living and dead ; all are branches of that ever-living Tree of Life, with
its root in Heaven, the leaves of which are for tho healing of the nations
of the world. Each special religion brings out and emphasises some
special aspect of the Truth, necessary far the evolution of humanity
during the age it opens, and shapes the civilisation of that age, enriching
the religious, moral and cultural heritage of the human race.
The Fellowship of Faiths, of which all special religions are
integral parts— whether or not they recognise their places in the World
Order— declares :
1. There is one transcendeut Self-Existent Life, eternal, all-
pervading, all-sustaining, whence all worlds derive their several
lives, whereby and wherein all things which exist live and move
and have their being.
2. For our world this Life is immanent, and is manifested as
the Logos, the Word, worshipped under different Names, in
different religions, but ever recognised as the One Creator,
Preserver and Regenerator.
3. Under Him, our world is ruled and guided by aHierarchy
of His Elder Children, variously called Rishis, Sages, Saints,
among whom are the World-Teachers, who for eachage re-proclaim
2 9 0 TH E G EN ER A L REPO R T OK TH E f . S.
the ossential truths of roligion and morality iu a form suited to
the age ; this Hierarchy is aided in its work by the hosts of
Beings—again variously named, Devas, Angels, Shining Ones—
discharging functions recognised in all religions.
4. Human beings form one order of the creatures evolving
on this earth, and each human being evolves by successive life-
periods, gathering experiences and building them into character,
reaping always as he sows, until he-has learned the lessons taught
in the three worlds—the earth, the intermediate state and the
r
heavens—in which a complete life-period is passed, and has reached
human perfection, when he (‘liters the company of just men made
perfect, that rules and guides the evolving lives in all stages of
their growth.
These are the Basic Truths of the Fellowship of Faiths, of which
all religions are specialised branches ; to proclaim and teach these the
Thoosopliical Society was founded and exists.
The Fellowship.' of Faiths will thus help in preparing the way
for the Coming of the World-Teaclier, who shall give to the Basic
Truths the form suited to the age lie will open - the Age of
Brotherhood.
The Thoosopliical ¡Society admits to its fellowship all who desire
In enter it, whether or not they hold any of these basic truths, or belong
to any religion or to none, since all belong to the Universal Brother­
hood of Humanity, of which it is a nucleus.
!. Votes on the proposal of the General Secretary, T. S. in
Ungland suggesting alterations and additions to llule 44 of the Rules
and Regulations of the T. S. were not all in favour. The General
Secretary, T S. in India, voted against and Mr. Hireiulra Nath Dutta

a sub-committee consisting of the Vice-President, Mr. Hirondra Nath
Dalta, Rai Tijbal Narain Gurlu, Mr. I,'. K. Telang and the Recording
Secretary to go into details and report about it.
f>
. The Treasurer’s Report and Balance Sheet, which showed

the General Oouncil. The deficit, however, had been fortunately met
by the credit balance of last year.
The T. S. and Adyar Library Budgets for 1928, which wort
provisionally passed by the Executive Committee, T. S., were unani­
mously passed after examining various items.

•1?. Various suggestions were received regarding the distribution
of £ 25,000 Legacy of Mas. D ouglas H a m ilto n . After full discussion
(lie following resolution was passed.
That the total sum be divided as follows :
(a ) One-fifth for repairs and additions to buildings, Provident Fund
for employees of the T.S., installation of a telephone system, and
other purposes of T.S. Headquarters, Adyar.
(/>) Two-fifths he held in reserve to form “ Douglas Hamilton
Fund,” to be used at the discretion of the President, T. S., to develop
work affecting the progress of the Theosophical movement throughout
the world.
(e) Two-iifths to be allocated at the discretion of the President,
T. S., for the development of such National Societies as should need
assistance direct from Adyar Headquarters.

legacy had been heard from the Executors of Mrs. Douglas Hamilton,

them.
1. The General Secretary, T. 15. in America, sent a proposal that
instead of inviting ouch National Society to pay a subscription of 1°/,
of its total annual dues towards the World Congress Fund, the enter­
taining National Society should defray all the expenses of the World
Congress by charging a moderate registration fee to delegates attending
the World Congress.
The Treasurer, T. S., reported that he had received only Rs. 546
from some of the National Societies towards the World Congress Fund,
and pointed out that 1% on Rs. 20,000 Annual Duos would bring
296 TH E G EN ER A L REPO R T O P T H E T . S.
about only Rs. 2,000 per year for the World Congress Fund, 'which at
the end of seven years would amount to Rs. 14,000.
This sum was barely adequate to defray the cost of travel to the
Congress of the Executive officers and left nothing for expenses of
organising the Congress itself.
After some discussion the (Tenoral Council
R e s o lv e d ,—That the proposal of the General Secretary, T. S. in
America, bo circulated among the members of the General Council with
a memorandum from the Treasurer, T. S., for votes.
Carried unanimously.
