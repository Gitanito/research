Instead of seducing young, in

delight, which is too often
taken in
reading the gay and bewitching Chi
meras of the Caballists, and in per
using the enticing Fables of new invent
ed Tricks of Superstition, my ancient
friend, the Writer, strikes
at the very
Root of these Superstitions,

them, how they may be fatisffd
in
their several Curiosities, by having re
course
to Me, who by the talent of
the Second-sight (which he so

Things na
turally, which when you try to learn
your selves^ you either run the hazard
of being imposed upon in your

I hope when this Book comes to be

Mr,
xij
Epistle Dedicatory.
Mr, Aubrey
of
the Royal Society
says,
a
Gentlewoman that he knew,
confessed
in his hearing that she used
this Method, and dreamt
of
her hus
band whom
she
had never seen
:
About
two or three Tears after, as foe was
one Sunday at Church, up pops
a
young
Oxonian in the Pulpit
;
foe
cries out
■presently to her Sijier, this
is
the very
Face
of
the Man
Isaw in my Dream.
Sir William Somes'/ Lady did the
like.
Another way
is
to charm the Moon
thus, (as the old Nurses give out
j)
At
the firji Appearance
of
the Moon after
New-years-day,
(
some say any other
New Moon
is
as good) go out in the
Evening, and fund over the Sparrs
of
a
Gate or Stile, looking on the Moon
(here remark, that in York(shire they
kneel on
a
Ground-fast Stone) and
fa>
All
Epistle Dedicatory, xiij
All hail to the Moon3 all hail to thee,
I prithee good Moon reveal to me
This night who my Husband shall
be. >
You must presently after go to bed:
the aforesaid Mr. Aubrey knew two
Gentlewomen that did thus when they
were young Maids, and they had
dreams of those that married them.
But a great many of the wittiest
fart of your Sex laugh at
these
common
Superstitions
*
but then they are apt to
run into worse
: They give themselves
up to the reading of the Eco
systems of Sylphs, and Gnomes, and
Mandrake, which are very wicked
and delusive Imaginations,
I would not have you imaginey (La
dies) that I impute these Things as In
firmities and Frailties peculiar to your
s. No j Mw> and great Men too,

xiv Epistle Dedicatory:
and Scholars, and even
Statesmen
and
Princes tliemselves have been tainted
with Supervisions j and where they in
fect the minds of such great Persona
ges, they make the deeper impression,
according to the stronger and more Man
ly Ideas they have of them. Their
greater degree of Strength in the In
tellect only subjects them to greater
Weaknesses twas even the great
Paracelsus, the Wonder and Miracle
of Learning in the Age wherein he
lived, and such
were all his Followers,
scholars, statesmen, divines, and Fen
ces that are Talifmanists*
These Talismans that Paracelsus
pretends- to- ewe to the Ex cogitation and
Invention of honest art, seem
to me to
be
of a very Diabolical nature, and
to owe their Rife to being dedicated
by the author to the Heathen Gods.
Thus the Cebalists pretending to a
vast
Penetration into Arts and Sciences (the]

found out the several Methods appro

have appropriated Gold to the Sun on
the Sunday, silver to the Moon on the
Monday, iron to Mars on the Tues-

Wednesday, Tin to Jupiter on the
•Thursday, Copper or Brass to Venus
an tlx Friday, and Load to Saturn
on the Saturday. The Metfjods they
take in forming •
these
Talismans are
too long to dwell upon here.^ But the
properties which they pretend belong
to them, are, that the jirji Talisman,
or Seal of the Sun, will make a Man
beloved by all Princes and Potentates y

him to abound with all the

The fourth, they pretend, cures Fevers
and other Diseases j and if it be put
under the
bolster , it makes the JFVa-
prietor have true dreams, in which
he fees all he
desires to know. The
fifth, according to them, renders 'a

importunate cares, and banishes pa-

A Remarkable
PASSAGE
OF AN
A PPARITION. 1665.
IN
the beginning of this Year,a Disease happened
in this Town of Launcefton, and some of
my Scholars died of it. Among others who fell
under the Malignity then triumphing, was, John
Eliott the eldest Son of Edward Elliott of Tre-
berse, Esq; a Stripling of about Sixteen Years of
Age, but of more than common Parts and Inge
nuity. At his own particular Request I Preached
at the Funeral, which happened on the 20th Day of
June, i66$. In my Discourse Li mos rei'q; lociq;
poftulabat) I spake some -Words in Commenda
tion of the Young Gentleman } such as might en
dear his Memory to those that knew him, and
twithall tended to preserve his example to the Fry
'"'"" which
Of an A » P A R I T I 0 N. 2 1
which went to School with him, and were to
continue there after him. An Ancient Gentleman,
who was then in the Church, was much affected
with the Discourse, and was often heard to repeat
the fame evening, one Expression I then used out
of Virgil.
Et Tuer ipsefuit cantart dignus.—~
The reason why this grave Gentleman was so
concerned at the character, was a reflection he
made upon a Son of his own, who being about
the fame Age, and but a few Months before, not
unworthy of the like character I gave of the
Young Mr. Elliot ; was now by a strange Acci
dent quite lost as to his Parents hopes, and all ex
pectations of any farther Comfort by him.
The Funeral Rites being over, I was no sooner
come out of the Church, but I found my self most
courteously accosted by this Old Gentleman;
and with an unusual importunity, almost forced
against my Humour to see his House that Night;
nor could I have rescued my self from his kind
ness,- had not Mr. Elliot interposed and pleaded
title to me for the whole Day, which ( as he
said) he would resign to no Man. Hereupon I
got loose for that time, but was constrained to
leave a Promise behind me, to wait upon him at
his own House the Monday following. This then
seemed to satisfy, but before Monday came, I
had a new Meslageto request me that if it were
possible I would be there the Sunday. The second
attempt I resisted, by answering that it was against
my convenience,, and the Duty which mine own
iw .-v.

People
%% A Remarkable Passage
People expected from me. Yet was not the Gen
tleman at Rest, for he sent me another Letter the
Saturday by no means to fail the Monday, and
so to order my business as to spend with him two
or three Days at least. I was indeed startled at so
much eagerness, and for many duniungs for a
Visit, without any Business 5 and began to suspect
that there must needs be some design in the Bot
tom of all this excess of Courtesy. For I had no
Familiarity, scarce common Acquaintance with
the Gentleman, or his Family j nor could I imagine
whence should arise such a flush of Friendship on
the sudden.
On the Monday I went and paid my promised
Devoir, and met with Entertainment as free and
plentiful, as the Invitation was importunate.
There also, I found a Neighbouring Minister, who
pretended to call in accidentally, but by the sequel
I suppose it otherwise. After Dinner this Brother
of the Goat undertook to show me the gardens,
where as we were Walking, he gave me the first
discovery of what was mainly intended in all
this Treat and Complement.
First he began to tell the Infortunity of the Fa
mily in general, and then gave Instance in the
Youngest Son. He related what a hopeful spright
ly Lad he lately was, and how Melancholick and
Sottish he was now grown. Then did he with
much Passion lament, that his ill Humour should
so incredibly subdue his Reason $ for (faith he) the
poor Boy believes himself to be haunted with
ghosts, and is confident that he meets with an
Evil Spirit in a certain field about half a Mile
from this Place, as often as he goes that way to
School.
Ofan k p fa trOxfo k 23
School. In the midst of our Twattle, the Old
Gentleman and his Lady (as observing their
Cu^
in exactly) came up to us. Upon their Ap
proach, and pointing me to the Arbour, the
Parson renews the relation to me, and they ( the
Parents of the Youth) confirmed what he said,
and added many minute Circumstances, in a long
narrative of the whole : In fine they all Three <k>
sired my thoughts and Advice in the Affair.
I was not able to collect Thoughts enough on
the sudden, to frame a Judgment upon what they
had said. Only I answered, that the thing which
the Youth reported to them, was strange, yet not
incredible, and that I knew not then what to think
or fay of
it,
but
if
the Lad would be free to me
in talk and trust me with his Counsels,
I
had
hopes to give them
a
better Account of my Opi
nion the next day.
I
had no sooner spoken so much, but
I
perceived
my self in the Springle their Courtship had laid
for me
j
for the old Lady was not able to hide her
impatience, but her Son must be call'd immedi
ately
;
this
I
was forced to comply with, and con
sent to, so that drawing off from the Company
to an Orchard near by, she went her self, and,
brought him to me, and left him with. me.
It
was the main drift of all these Three to per
swade me, that either the Boy was lazy, and glad
of any excuse to keep from the school, or that he
was in love with some Wench, and ashamed to
confess
it
j
or that he had
a
Fetch upon his father
to get Money and new clothes,, that he might
range to London after
a
Brother he had there
;
and
therefore they be^g'd of me, to discover the Root
24 A Remarkable Passage
of the matter; and accordingly to dissuade, ad-
Vise, or reprove him ; but chiefly by all means to
undeceive him, as to the fancy of Ghosts and Spirits.
I soon entred a close conference with the
youth, and at first was very cautclous not to dis
please him, but by smooth words to ingratiate
my self and get within him, for I doubted he
would be too distrustful, or too reserved. But we
had scarce past the first Scituation and began to
speak to the Business, before I found, that there
needed no Policy to skrew my self into his Heart;
for he most openly and with all obliging Can
dour did aver, that he loved his Book, and desired
nothing more than to be bred a Scholar ; that he
had not the least respect for any of Womankind
as his Mother gave out; And that the only request
he would make to his Parents was, that they
would but believe his constant Assertions, con
cerning the Woman he was disturbed with, in the
Field, called the Higher-Broom- §lmrtils. He told
me with all naked freedom and a Flood, of Tcares,
that his Friends were unkind and unjust to him,
neither to believe nor pity him ; and that if any
Man (making a bow to me) would but goe
with him to the Place he might be convine'd that
the Thing was real, &c.
By this Time he found me apt to compassionate
his Condition, and to be attentive to his Relation
of it j and therefore he went on in this Manner.
This Woman which appears to me ( faith he)
lived a Neighbour here to my Father; and dyed
about Eight Years since; her Name Dorothy Ding-
ley, of such a Stature, such Age, and such Com
plexion. She never speaks to me, but passeth by
hastily,
Of an A pjp a"r i t i o n. 25
hastily, and always leaves the foot Path to me, and
she commonly meets me twice or three Times in
the breadth of the Field.
It was about two Months before I took any
Notice of
it,
and though the Shape of the Face
was in my Memory, yet
I
could not recall the
Name of the Person
;
but without more thought-
fulness,
I
did suppose
it
was some Woman who
lived thereabout, and had frequent occasion that
way. Nor did
I
imagine any Thing to the con
trary, before she began to meet me constantly Mor
ning and Evening, and always in the fame Field,
and sometimes twice or thrice in the breadth of
it.
The first Time
I
took notice ofher,was about aYear
since; and when
I
first began to suspect and believe
it
to be
a
Ghost,
I
had Courage enough not to be
afraid
;
but kept
it
to my Self
a
good while, and
only wondred very much at it.
I
did often speak
to
it,
but never had
a
Word in Answer. Then
I
changed my Way and went to School the under
Horse Road, and then she always met me in the
narrow Lane, between the Quarry Parke and the
Nursery, which was worse.
At length
I
began to be terrified at
it,
and prayed
continually, that God would either free me from
it,
or let me know the meaning of it. Night and
Day, sleeping and waking, the Shape was ever
running in my Mind
;
and
I
often did repeat these
Places of Scripture
(
with that he takes
a
small
Bible out of his Pocket) job. 7. 14. Thou l
est
me with 'Dreams, and temfiest me through Vtfi-
ans; and Deut. 28. 67. In the Morning thou jhaU
fay, Would God
it

E
J
thou.
26 A Remarkable Paffage
thou Jhalt say would God it were Morning, for the
fear of thine Heart, wherewith thou Jhatt fear,
and for the fight of thine Eyes which thou Jhalt
fee. I was very much pleased with the lad's In
genuity, in the Application of these pertinent
Scriptures to his Condition, and desired him to
proceed. (Thus faith he) bydegrco6 I grew very
pensive, insomuch that it was taken Notice of by
all our family ; whereupon being urged to
it,
I
told my Brother William of it; and he privately
acquainted my Father and Mother
;
and they kept
it
to themselves for some Time.
The success of this discovery was only this;
they did sometimes laugh at me
-,
sometimes chide
me, but still commanded me to keep my School,
and put such Fopperies out of my Head.
I
did ac
cordingly goe to School often, but always met
the Woman in the way.
This and much more to the fame purpose
(
yea
as much as held
a
Dialogue of near two Hours)
was our Conference in the Orchard
;
which en
ded with my proffer to him, that (without make-
ing any privy to our Intents)
I
would next Mor
ning, walk with him to the Place about Six a
Clock. He was even transported with Joy at the
mention of
it,
and replyed, but will you sure, sir?
Will you sure, Sir
?
Thank God, now
I
hope
I
shall be believed. From this conclusion we reti
red into the House.
The Gentleman, his Wife and Mr. Sam. were
impatient to know the Event, insomuch that they
came out ofthe Parlour,into the Hall to meet us
;
and
seeing the Lad look chearfully, the first Comple
ments from the Old Man was^ Come Mr. Ruddle,
you
Of an
Apparition. 27
you have talked with Sam. I hope now he will
have more wit; an idle Boy, an idle Boy. At
these Words the Lad ran up the Stairs to his Cham
ber without replying; and I soon stop'd the Curi
osity of the three Expectants, by telling them I
had promis'd Silence, and was resolved to be as
good as my Word ; but when Things were riper
they might know all ; at present, J desired them
to reft in my faithful promise, that I would doe
my utmost in their service, and for the good of
their Son. With this they were silenced, I can- .
not say, satisfied.
The next Morning before five a Clock, the Lad
was in my Chamber, and very brisk; I arose and
went with him. The Field he led me too, Iguess'd
to be twenty Acres, in an open Country, and
about three furlongs from any House. We went
into the Field, and had not gone above a third
part, before the Spectrum, in the shape of a Wo
man, with all the Circumstances he had described
her tome in the Orchard the Day before, (as much
as the suddenness of its Appearance, and evanition
would permit me to discover) met us and pasted
by. I was a little surprised at it ; and though I had
taken up a firm Resolution to speak to
it,
yet
I
had
not the power, nor indeed durst
I
look back, yet,
I
took care not to shew any fear to my Pupil and
Guide, and therefore only telling him, that
I
was
satisfied
in
the Truth of his Complaint, we walked
to the end of the Field, and returned, nor did the
Ghost meets us at that Time above once.
I
per
ceived in the young Man
a
kind of Boldness mixt
withAstonifhment; the first caused
by
my preference,
and the Proof he had given of his own Relation,
and the other
by
the sight of his persecutor.
E

In
£8 A Remarkahle Passage
In short, we went home ; I somewhat puzlcd,
he much animated. At our return, the Gentle
woman (whose inquisitiveness had missed us)watch'd
to speak with me, I gave her a convenience, and
told her that my Opinion was, that her Son's Com
plaint was not to be flighted, nor altogether discre
dited, yet that my Judgement in his cafe was not
settled. I gave her Caution moreover, that the
Thing might not take wind, least the whole
Country should ring, with what we yet had no
Assurance of.
In this juncture of Time, I had Business, which
would admit no delay ; wherefore I went for Lan-
ceston that- Evening, but promised to see them
again next Week. Yet I was prevented by an Oc
cation which pleaded a sufficient excuse. For my
Wife was that Week brought home from a Neigh
bours House very ill. However my Mind was
upon the adventure; I studdied the Cafes and
about three weeks after went again; resolving by
the help of God to see the utmost.
The next Morning being the 27 th Day of
^July 1665. I went to the haunted Field by my
self, and walked the breadth of it without any en
counter, I returned, and took the other walk,
and then the Spectrum appeared to me, much
about the same Place I saw it before when the
young Gentleman was with me : In my Thoughts it
moved swifter than the Time before, and about
ten Foot distant from me on my right hand; in
somuch that I had not time to speak as I deter
mined with my self before Hand.
The Evening of this Day, the Parents, the Son,
Md my self, being in the Chamber where I lay ;
Of an A p p a r i t i o k 29
I propounded to them, our going altogether to
the Place next Morning, and some asseveration,
that there was no danger in
it,
we all resolved
upon it. The Morning being come, least we
should alarm the Family of Servants, they went
under the pretence of seeing
a
Field of Wheat, and
I
took my Horse, and setcht
a
Compass another
way, and so met at the Stile we had appointed.
"
Thence we all four walked leisurely into the
quartiles
;
and had»past above half the Field, before
the Ghost made Appearance.
It
then came over the
Stile just before us, and moved with that swiftness,
that
by
the Time we had gone fix or seven Steps
it
pasted by.
I
immediately tum'd Head and ran after
it, with the young Man
by
my side j we saw,
it
pals over the Style at which we cntrcd,but no farther,
I
slept upon the Hedge at one Place, he at another
but could discern nothing
;
whereas
I
dare averr, that
the swiftest Horse in England could not have con
veyed himselfout ofsight,in that short space ofTimc.
Two Things
I
observed in this Days Appearance.
x. That
a
Spaniel Dog, who followed the
Company unregarded, did bark and run away, as
the Spectrum passed
by
;
whence 'tis easy to con
clude that 'twas not our Fear or Fancy which made
the Apparition.
2. That the motion of the Spectrum was not
gradatim, or by steps, and moving of the Feet
j
but
a
kind of gliding as Children upon the ice,
or
a
Boat down
a
swift River, which eventually
answers the Descriptions, the Ancients gave of
the Motion of their Lemnres, which was,
YLtt-rzt
go A Remarkahle Passage
Ka^.' idea digtov $ op a.vQp.TmSi&v.
Hcliodor.
But to proceed, this occular Evidence clearly
convine'd, but withall strangely affrighted the
Old Gentleman and his Wife ; who knew this
cDorothy T>ingly in her Life Time, were at her
Burial, and now plainly saw her Features in this
present Apparition. 1 encourag'd them as well
as I could; but after this they went no more.
However I was resolved to proceed, and use such
lawful Means as God hath discovered, and learned
Men have successfully practised, in these un-vulgar
Cases.
The next Morning being Thursday, I went
out very early by my self, and walked for about
an Hours space in Meditation and Prayer in the
Field next adjoining to the quartiles. Soon
after Five I stept over the Stile, into the disturb'd
Field j and had not gone above thirty or forty
Paces before the Ghost appeared at the farther Stile.
I spake to it with a loud Voice, in some such
Sentences as the way of these dealings directed
me, whereupon it approached but slowly , and
when I came near it moved not. I spake again
and it answered, in a Voice neither very Audible
nor Inteligible. I was not in the least terrify Jd,
and therefore persisted, until it spake again, and
gave me Satisfaction. But the Work could not
be finished at this time; wherefore the fame
Evening an Hour after Sun-set, it met me again
near the same Place, and after a few Words of
each fide it quietly vanished, and neither doth ap
pear
Ofan Apparition." 31
pear since, nor ever will more, to any Man's
disturbance. The discourse in the Morning lasted
about a quarter of an Hour.
These Things are true, and I know them to be
so with as much certainty as Eyes and Ears can
give me, and until I can be perswaded that my
Senses do deceive me about their proper object ;
and by that perswasion deprive my self of the
strongest Inducement to believe the Christian Re
ligion, I must and will assert, that these Things in
this Paper are true.
As for the manner of my proceeding, I find
no Reason to be ashamed of it,
for
I
can justify
it,
to Men of good principles, Discretion, and
recondite Learning. Though in this Cafe
I
chose
to content my self in the assurance of the Thing,
rather than be at the unprofitable trouble to per-
swade others to believe it. For
I
know full well
with what difficulty, Relations of so uncommon
a
Nature and Practice, obtain Belief. He that
tells such
a
Story, may expect to be dealt withal,
as
a
Traveller in 'Poland
by
the Robbers, viz.
first Murdered and then Search'd, first condemn'd
for
a
Lyar, or Superstitious, and then (when 'tis
too late
)
have his 'Reasons and Proofs exami
ned. This Incredulity may be attributed,
i. To the infinite abuses of the People, and
impositions upon their Faith
by
the cunning
Monks and Friars, &c. in the Days of Darkness
and Popery. For they made Apparitions as often
as they pleased, and got both Money and Credit
by quieting the terriculamenta Vulgi, which their
own Artifice had raised.

Since thejæfore,Persons distinguished for Merit
in one Kind or other, are the constant subjects
of (uch Discourses, and the most Elegant
Writers of each age have been usually the
only authors, who chuse upon such subjects
to employ their pens ; and since Persons of
the highest Rank, and dignity, and Genij of
the most refined and delicate Relifli, are fre
quently curious enough to be the Readers of
them,- and to esteem them the most valuable
Pieces in a whole collection of Learned
Works : It is a wonder to me, that when
A Man's Life has something in it peculiarly
Great and remarkable in its Kind, it should
not move fom& more skilful Writer than_my
self to give the Publick a Taste of
it,
because
it
rriust' be at least vastly Entertaining,
if
it
be not, which
is
next to impossible, im
mensely Instructiveand Profitable withal.

If ever the Life of any Man under the
Sun was Remarkable, this Mr. Duncan Camp

so,

and Mr. Camp

is
of that Extent, that 'it concerns

There
is
a'
'demand in almost every Pages
that relates any new Act of hisj for the finest
and closest Disquisitions that Learning can
make upon Human Nature, to account how
those acts could be done
by
him. For he
daily practised, and still practises those Things
naturally, which puts Art to the rack to find
out how Nature can' toperate in- him
?
and
his fleshly Body, by these operations,

possibly be atchleved by a human Genius in
the full Perfection of Nature, and had laid it
down as a Thesis by strong Arguments, that
such Things might be compasled by a Human
Genius (if in its true degree of Perfection)
as are the Hourly Operations of the Persons
Life! am writing, he would have been count
ed a wild Romantick Enthusiast, instead of
a Natural Philosopher. Some of the wisest
would be Infidels to so new and so refined a
Scheme of Thinking, and demand Experi
ment, or cry it was all against Reason, and
would not allow the least Tittle to be true
without it. Yet the Man that had found out
so great a Mystery, as to tell us, what might
be done by a Human Genius, as itis here actu
ally done, would have been a great Man with
in himself ; but wanting farther, Experimen
tal Proof, could lay no claim to the Belief of
others, or consequently to their Esteem : But
how great then is the Man, who makes it con
stantly his Practice, actually to Do, what
would not otherwise have been thought to be
of such a Nature, as might ever be acquired
by mortal Capacity, tho' in its full. Comple
ment of all possible Perfection ? He is not only
great within himself, he is great to the World ;
his Experiments force our Belief, and the
amazing Singularity of those Experiments,
provokes both our Wonder and Esteem.
If any learned Man fliould have advanced
this Proposition,That meer Human Art could
give
of Mr. Duncan CampbeiX J
give to the Deaf Man what should be equal to
his hearing, and to the Dumb Man an Equi
valent for his want of Speech, so that he
should converse as freely almost, as other
Hearing or talking Persons ; that he might,
tho' born Deaf, be by Art taught, how to
Read, Write, and understand any language,
as well as Students that have their Hearing j
would not the world, and many even of the
Learned Part of it far, that nothing could be
more extravagantly Wild, more Mad and
Frantick ? The learned Dr. Wallis, Geome-
tries of Oxford, did first of all'lay
down this Proposition, and was counted by
many to have overshot the Point of Learnings
and to have been the Author of a whimsical
Thesis. And I should not have wondered;
if,
after
a
Man's having asserted This might
be done, before
it
was-' actually doriej 'some
blind devout People, in those days, had ac
cused him of heresy, and of attributing to
Men
a
power of working miracles. The No
tion of the antipodes was by the most learn
ed men of the Age in which St. Augnftiri
lived; and
by
the Great St» Austin himself
treated rn.no milder amarinenyet
if
the AbU

.^ who are wrongly called a Savage Set of
Mortals ,D no ; they came in quest of him after
so bitter a night, not doubting to find him,
but fearing to find him in a lamentable Con
dition. They hunted and ransack'd every lit
tle Hole and Corner in the Rock, but all in
vain. In one Place, they saw a great Slaugh
ter of Fowls, enough to serve Forty Families
for a Week ; and then they guested, tho'
they had not the
ill
Fortune to meet the
Eagles, (frequently noted to hover about
,those rifles) that they might have devoured
Part of him on some Precipice of the Rock,
and dropt the Remnant into the Sea. Night
came upon them, and they were afraid of

Return -we- now- to Mr. Archibald Camp
bell still alive, and on Board the Holland
Vestel ; secure, as he thought within himself,
that from the' Delivery he lately had by the
gift of Providence, he was not intended to
be liable to any more Misfortunes and Dan
gers of Life; in 'the Compass of so small a
Voyage: But his Lot was placed other
wise in the Book of Fate^ -than he too
fondly imagined : His Time* of Happiness;
was dated some Pages lower down ; and more
Rubs and Difficulties were to be encountered
with, before his Stars intended to lead him by
the Port of Felicity. Just as he arrived with*
in sight of Amsterdam, a terrible Storm arose,
and, in danger of their Lives for many Hour%
they weather'd out the Tempest ,• and a Calm
promising fair afrelh , they made to the
coast of Zealand ; but a new Hurricane
prevented the Ship from coming there also -:
And after having lost their Masts and Rig
ging, they were driven into Lapland. There
they went ashore, in order to careen and
repair their Ship, and take in Provisions.
While the Ship was Repairing by the Dutch,
Our Islander made merry With the 'Inhabi
tants ; being the most inclined to their Super
stitious Customs. He there became acquainted
with,
fJfe. Ds3»CAxC*K*ftt iX» fcf
with a very bnmiisn] Woman, who fell in
love with him i ana alter e very 4miR Snace
of time, he married her. About the time
when the ship departed, his wife' s who' s
very rich^ vs bis; with Child o: c 5<fc ;
namely, Mr.-D*nitfiB Cœnw&ell. Fie wrote a
letter by the Master of the vessel to his Pa
rents in Scbnlawd-, concerning she various
adventures he had met with ; which was de
liver d the Jtor following , about the time
of Fifcing, to his parents ; and fevsai per-
ions had Caries thereof, and for ought I
know, some retain them to this very day.
Sure I am, that many remember the Particu
lars of this fiupiiang Aitair, who are now
living in that Island.
The Letter being very remarkable, and
singular in all its Orcuinfhinees, I foaii pre
sent it the Reader,word for word, as it was
given into my Hands, together with some
others which he wrote afterwards ; in all
which, I am assured by very credible Per
sons, and undoubted authorities, there are
not the least Alterations, but what the Ver
sion of it from the then Scvtt Manner of Ex
pression into a more modern Enghjb Drels,

same odd Variety of Accidents,
which put
it
out of ray Power, to be

so
ordered
it,
that
Ican fend
a
Letter to you, before
I
can
come my self; and
it
is
written exprefly to tell
you the Adventures
I
have met with
,
Which
nave detained me this tedious Space of Time
from my Dear Father
;
and because the (ame
Captain of
a
Ship, that brings you this, might
as easily have brought your Son to speak for
himself
,•
I
shall,
in
the next place, lay before
you the Necessity there is for my Stay
a
lit
tle longer among the strange Natives, of the
Country where
I
now inhabit, and where
I
am
in
a
manner become Naturalized, .
.<
You have, no doubt of
it,
been inlbrm'd by
my- Companions, (some of whom
I
hope got
safe back again,
if
not all) that
I
was lost,
{"where many
a
brave Man has peristi'd before
me
)
by
going over the high Precipices of the
Mountain Brajsah in
a
Basket, Aiding down
by
a
Rope.
I
must suppose
I
have given you
the Anguifli of
a
Father for
a
Son, who, you
thought, had lost his Life by such
a
Fool-har
dy Attempt
;
and
I
implore your Pardon with
ajl-the Power of Filial Contrition, Penitence
and Duty. You have always shewed me such
singular
of Mr. Dunc an Campbell if
singular Marks of Paternal affection, that I
know your Receipt of this Letter will fill
your Heart with Joy, and cause you to sign
me an Absolution and free Pardon for all
the Errors I have committed ; and think
the Sufferings I have undergone for my
Rashness and Indiscretion, a sufficient Atone
ment for my Crime of making you, by my
Undutifulness, a Partner of my Sorrows. To
free you the more from this Uneasine(s,I know
I need only tell you, that every Grief of mine is
gone, excepting one, which
is,
that
I
must still
lose the Pleasure of seeing you
a
little longer.
There was never surely
a
more bitter Night,
than that which must by me be for ever
remember'd
;
when
I
was lost in the Moun
tain of Bra/sah, where
I
must for ought
I
know
have liv'd for ever,
a
wild, single Inhabitant,
but that the Storm (which made the Night
so uneasy to me) render'd the first Approach
of Daylight beyond measure delightful. The
first Providential Glimpse of the Morning,
gave me
a
View of
a
Ship driven by the Tem
pest into
a
Creek of the Rock, that was by
Nature form'd like
a
Harbour
;
a
miraculous
Security of deliverance, as
I
thought, both
for the Ship's Crew, and my self,
I
made all
the Haste
I
could, you may be sure, to them
;
and
I
found them to be Dutchmen, that were
come for Fifth
:
But in Lieu of Fish,
I
in
structed them to load
it
with Eggs and Fowl
;
which we compasled very happily in
a
short
C
Space
18 The Lif e and Adventures
Space of Time ; and I was to be a Sharer
with the Captain in the Lading, and bargain
ed to go for Holland, to fee the Sale, and the
Nature of Traffick : But when we were at
sea, after much bad Weather, we made to
wards Zealand ; but we were driven upon the
Coast of Finland by a new Storm, and thence
into Lapland, where I now am, and from
whence I fend you this Letter.
I could not come into a Place so properly
named for my Reception. As I had been
undutiful to you , and Fortune seemed to
make me an Exile, or banished Man, by way
of Punishment for the Vices of my Youth ;
so Lapland (which is a Word originally de-
riv'd from the Finland word Lappi , that
is,
Exiles
;
and from the Swedish word Lap,
signifying Banished
;
from which Two King
doms most of our Inhabitants were banish
d
hither, for not embracing the Christian Reli
gion
;
)
was certainly the properest Country
in the World to receive me.
When first
I
enter'd this Country,
I
thought
I
was got into quite another World
:
The Men are all of them Pigmies to our tall,
brawny Highlanders
:
They are, generally
speaking, not above Three Cubits high
;
in
somuch that tho' the whole Country of Lap
land
is
immensely large, and
I
have heard
it
reckon
'd
by the inhabitants to be above
a
Hundred German Leagues
in
Length, and
Fourscore and ten-
in
Breadth
:
Yet
I
was
'::
i
the
of Mr. Duncan Campbell ip
the tallest Man there , and look'd upon as a
Giant. The District in which I live now,
is called XJma Lapmarh You must under
stand , sir, that when I landed at North
Cape, in Kimi-Lapmark, another District of
Lapland ; there was at that Time a most
beautiful Lady come to fee a Sick Relation
of her Father's, who was prefect, or Governor
of Uma Lapmark ; which is a Post of great
distinction. —This Lady, by being frequently
in the company of French Merchants, (who
Traffick now, and then in that Province of
Uma Lapmark) understood French; and ha
ving heard of a Man Six Foot and a half high,
desired to fee me ; and when I came, the
happen'd mightily to like my Person : And she
talk'd French ; which when I anfwer'd, home
made great Signs of Joy , that (he could
communicate her Sentiments to me ; and she
told me who she was, how rich, and that
not one in the company besides could un
derstand a syllable we said, and so I might
speak my mind freely to her. She told me
the Customs of the Country ; that it was
divided into cantons,' like our Shires, and
those cantons into Rckars, or certain Grounds
allotted ,to families , that are just like our
clans. As the was beyond measure beautiful,
(he was extreamly good-humour'd, (a Thing
rarely to be met with among Lapland Women)
of better stature than her Country-Women ;
very rich , and of good Birth : I thought
C 2 it
zo The Life and Adventures
it would be a prodigious Turn of Fortune
for a Man in my Circumstances, if I could
make any Progress in her Heart ; which slie
seemed a little to open to me , in such a man
ner, for the beginning, as if such a successful
Event, if managed with Prudence, might
not be despaired of. Souls that are Gene
rous, are apt to Love j and Compassion is the
best Introducer of Love into a generous Bo
som j and that was the best Stock I had to go
upon in my Courtfliip. I told her of all my
Calamities, my Dangers, and my Escapes ;
the Goodness of my Birth ; as being allied to
one of the greatest Nobles in our Island : And
still they would ask me to tell it her over again ,-
tho' every Time I told it , just at such and
such Paflages, me was forced to drop the
Tears from her Eyes. In fine, I grew more
in Love with her, out of a Sense of Gratitude
now , than by the Power of her Charms be
fore. The Matter in a few days went so
far, that she owned to me I had her Heart.
As to Marriage, I did not then know the
Custom of the Nation : I thought that if it
proved only dangerous to me, I lov'd her
for,
well, that
I
intended to marry her, tho' the
Law was to pronounce me dead for
it
;
but
I
did not know whether
it
might not be peri
lous for her too, to engage in such
a
State
with me
;
and
I
resolved
in
that Case, rather
to be singly unhappy, than to involve her in
Distress, and make her the fair Companion
of
of Mr. Duncan Campb ell \i
of my Woes. I would not tell her so, for
fear she should out of Love hide from me
those Dangers ; and therefore using a kind
Sort of Dissimulation, Iconjured her to tell me
the Laws and Customs of Marriages in that
Country to a Tittle j and that nothing should
hinder us from Happiness. She told me
exactly, as I find since. Our Marriage, said
she, will be very hard to compass j provi
ded we follow the strict Rule of the Coun
try. For our Women here are bound not
to see the Men who make their Addresses to
them, in some Time. His way of Courtship,
is to come to the Parents ; and his nearest
Friends and Relations must make her Father
Presents, and supplicate him like a King, to
grant him his Daughter. The Courtship
often lasts two or three years, and sometimes
has not its effect at last : But if it has ,
'
the
Woman is dragged by her Father and Bro
ther to Church, as unwilling to go to be mar
ried ,• which is looked upon as a greater Part
of Modesty in her, according to the greater
Disinclination she shews. My Father and
Brother, said she, will both be against it : You
have no Relations in this Country to .move
your Suit : I cannot be so hypocritical, as to
be dragged unwillingly to him I own I de
sire for my Lawful Husband ; and therefore,
as I have an Inclination to you , and I dare
own I have, I will not follow those methods
which I disapprove. I have talked with se*

about their Manner of Espousals ; and I am
told, that when Souls are naturally united
by Affection, the Couple so mutually and
reciprocally loving, (ho' they had rather
have their Parents Leave,
(if
likely to be got)
yet unwilling to
be
disappointed, only go to
the next Minister's, and marry for better for
worse. This way
I
approve
of
;
for where
two Persons naturally love each other, the rest
is
nothing but
a

her self soon into the Arms of the Man she

The prizes, can give away her Heart ( when
she is once baulked) to any Man, even tho-'
slie dislikes him. You must judge, (my dear
Father) I must be touch'd with a Woman
that was exceeding beautiful beyond any of
her Nation, and who had Thoughts as beau
tiful as her Person : I therefore was all in
Rapture, and longd for Matrimony j but
still loved her enough to propose the Questi
on I resolved to her ; viz,. If it would not be
in her Nation accounted a Clandestine Mar
riage, and prove of great Damage to her ?
To this me answer d, with all the wisdom
which could be expected from a Woman,
who had given such Eminent Tokens of her
judgment on other Points, amidst a Nati
on so barbarous in its Manners, and so cor
rupt in it£ Principles as Lapland is. I a
said slie, answerable to my Father for no
thing, by our Laws ; having no Portion of
him, but only what was presented me by
my Relations, at my Birth, according to
custom, in Lands and Rain-Deer. My Fa
ther is but Deputy-Governor ; tis a Swede
who is the Governor of Uma ; and if I
pay to him at every Mart and Fair, the
due Tribute, C which must either consist of
Fifty Rain-Deer, or One Hundred and Fifty
Rixdollars) he will have the Priest that marr

ding to our Custom, and keep us in Possessi
on of our Rights, that we may be enabled to
pay Tribute to the Crown of Sweden. In
deed, before the Abolition of the Birkarti,
which were our Native Judges, we could
not have Married thus without Danger to us*
both ; but now there is none at all.
My dear Father, You must easily imagine
that I could not help embracing with all
Tenderness so dear and so lovely a Woman.
In fine, I am Married to her ; I have lived
very happily hitherto, and am now grown
more happy, for she is big with Child ; and
like, before my Letter comes to your Hands,
to make you a Grandfather of a pretty Boy.
You will perhaps wonder, that I name the
Sex of the Child before it comes into the
World '; but we have a way in Lapland of
finding that out ; which tho' some judicious
People call superstitious, I am really persua
ded of by Experience ; and therefore I in
dulged my dear Wife's Curiosity, when she
signified to me, she had a Mind to make the
usual Tryal, whether the Child she was going
to re deliver d of, would be a Boy or a Girl ?
You must understand, {My Dear Fathers,
the People here judge of the Sex of the Child
by the Moon, unto which they compare a
big-bellyd Woman. If they fee a Star appear
just above the Moon, it is a Sign it will be a
Boy" ; but if the Star be just below the Moon,
they conjecture her to be big with a Girl.
<

- This
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. z$
This Observation and Remark of Laplan
ders has (I know) been accounted by some,
and those wise and judicious Men too, to
be ridiculously superstitious ; but I have been
led into an easy Belief of this Mystery, by a
Mistress (that is superior to Wisdom it self)
constant, and therefore probably infallible,
Experience. I therefore indulged my wife
in this her Request, and went with her to the
Ceremony : The Star appeared above the
Moon , which prognosticates a Boy , which
I wish may, and I scarce doubt will prove
true ; and when she is brought to Bed, I
will send you word of it. It is remarkable
likewise, that a Star was seen just before the
Moon, which we also count a very good
Omen. For it is a Custom likewise here in
Lapland, to consult the Moon as an Oracle,
about the Health and Vigor of the Child. ,
If a Star be seen just before the Moon, we
count it a Sign of a lusty and well-grown
Child, without blemish ; if a Star comes just
after, we reckon it a Token, that the Child
will have some defect or Deformity, or die
soon after it is born.
Having thus told you the Manners of the
Country I live in at present, as much at large
as the Space of a Letter will permit, and rela
ted to you my own happy Circumstances, and
the kindly Promises of the Heavens, that are
ushering in the Birth of my Child ; I
would not have you think that I addict my

self
J
-
x6. The Life and Adventures
self to the Superstitions of the Country, which
are very many, and groundless ; and arising
partly from the Remainder of Pagan Wor
ship, which is still cultivated among some
of the more obstinate Inhabitants. I have,
on the contrary, (since I married her) en-
deavour'd to repay my Wife's Temporal
Blessings to me, with those that are endless ;
instructed her in all the Points of Religion,
and made her perfectly a Christian : And

that
I
hope in
Us Two St. Pauls Saying will be verified
;
viz.
That the Woman shall be sanctified in her
Husband, and the Husbandpall be
sanctified
in his Wife.
.
However,
I
must take notice
in
this Place,
with all due Deference to Christianity, that tho'
I
am oblig'd to applaud the Prudence and Pi
ety of Charles the Ninth, King of Sweden,
who constituting Swedip Governors over this
Country, abrogated their practice of Super
stitions, and Art Magick, upon Pain of Death
:
Yet that King carried the Point too far, and
intermingled with these Arts the Pretensions to
the Gift of
a
Second Sight
;
which you know
how frequent
it
is
with us
in
Scotland, and
which

assure you, my Wife (tho' she durst

the penalty of those Swedifi Laws

a greater Degree , than ever I knew any of
our Countrywomen, or countrymen.
One Day this last Week she distracted me,
between the Extreams of Joy and Sorrow :
She told me I should fee you shortly ; and that
my coming Son would grow to be one of the
most remarkable Men in England and Scot
land, for his Power of Foresight : But that
I should speedily lose her, and meet with
Difficulties in my own country, in the fame
manner as my Father (meaning you, Sir)
had done before me, and on the fame Ac
count q viz. of Civil Broils , and intestine
Wars in Scotland.
These unfortunate Parts of her Relation, I
would not conceal from you ; because the
Veracity of her Notions should appear, if
they are true ; tho' you may be sure I mucli
wirfi they all may prove falte to the very
last, excepting that wherein ihe tells me, my

The Second Letter. •
IAm now the happiest man alive : The
prosperous Part of my Wife's Predicti
ons, which I mentioned to you in my. last,
is come in some measure to pass. The Child
she has brought me proves a Boy , and as
fine a one as ever I beheld ; if Fondness for
my own makes me not blind. And sure it
can't be Fondness, because other plain Cir
cumstances join'd at his Birth, to prove it a
more than ordinary remarkable one. He
was born with a Cawl upon his Head ; which
we count one of the luckiest Signs that can
be in Nature : He had likewise Three Teeth
ready cut thro' the Gums ; and we reckon
that an undeniable Testimony and Promise,
given to the world by Nature, that she in
tends such a Person for her extraordinary Fa
vourite, and that he is born for great things ;
which I daily beg of Heaven may come to
pass. *
Since I have known for some Months
what it is to be a Father, it adds a con
siderable Weight to those affections which
I had for my Wife. I thought that my

did love her then, as well as a Husband could
love a Wife, that
is,
a

a

but the Love to
a

is
a
feeling wonderful and inexpressibly different.
A

is
the Seal and the Pledge of Love

Meditating upon this, has likewise doubled
my affection to you

is
much increased now,

had been a Year in his own Country he
Married a Second Wife, a Lady whom I aad
known very well for some Years, and then

the Western Islands, I saw them not again in
three years. She being (quite contrary to the
cruel way much in Use among Step-Mothers,)
very fond of the Boy, was accustomed to

her own Son. The Child came to be about
Four Years of Age (as he has related to
me the Story since) and not able to speak
one Word, nor to hear any Noise ; the Fa

with Grief,, and complain heavily to his new
Wife, who was no less perplexed that a Boy

Hopes, assured her he would send to one of
the Chief Booksellers in London, to enquire
after the Book ; ( who would certainly pro
cure it him, if it was to be got ; ) and that
afterwards he would peruse it diligently,
make himself Master of Dr. Wallis's Method ;

them ) the advantages of Speech , as far
as Art would permit that Natural defect
to be supplied by her powerful Interposi
tion.
When the Mother came Home, the Child
(who could hear no knocking, and therefore
it must be by a strange and inexplicable In
stinct in Nature J was the first that ran to
the Door j and falling in a great Fit of Laugh-
ter,
of Mr. Duncan Ca mpbeli. }s
ter, (a Thing it was not much used to before,
having on the contrary rather a melancholy
Cast of Complexion ; ) it clung round its
Mother's knees, inceilantly embracing and
kissing them ; as if just at that Time it had
an insight into what the Mother had been
doing for it, and into, its own approaching
Relief from its misery.
When the Mother came with the Child in
her Hand to the Father , to tell him the wel
come News ; the Child burst afresh into a
great Et of Laughter, which continued for
an unusual space of time -; and the Scene of
such reciprocal affection and Joy between a
Wife and her own Husband , on so signal an
Occasion, is a Thing easier to be felt by Pa
rents of a good disposition, (imagining them
selves under the fame Circumstance, with Re
gard to a Child they loved with FondneG)
than to be expresi'd, or described by the Pen
of any Writer. But it is certain , whenever
they spoke of this Affair, (as any body, who
knows the Impatience of parents for the
Welfare of an only child, may guess they
must be often times it over, and wish
ing the Time was come jj the Boy, who used
seldom so much as to (mile at other times,
and who could never hear the greatest Noise
that could be made , would constantly look
wishfully in their faces, and laugh immode
rately ; which is a plain indication, that'
there was then a wonderful instinct in Na-

ture, as I said before ; which made him fore
taste his good Fortune, and, if I may be al
lowed the expression, The Dawnings as it
were of the Second Sight, were then preg
nant within him. X
To confirm this, the happy Hour of his
Deliverance being come, and the Doctor
having procur'd Dr. WaMcs Book, came with
great Joy, and desir'd to fee his Pupil. Scarce
were the Words out of his Mouth, when the
Child happen'd to come into the Room, and
running towards the Doctor, fell on his Knees,
killed his Hand eagerly, and laughed as be
fore ; which to me is a Demonstration, that
he had an insight into the Good which the
doctor intended him. . »
It is certain, that several Learned Men,
who have written concerning the SecondSigbty
have demonstrated by uncontestable Proofs,
and undeniable Arguments, That Children,
nay, even Horses and Cows, see the Second
Sight, as well as Men and Women advanced
in Years : But of this I shall discourse at large
in its proper Place ; having allotted a whole
future Chapter for that fame subject of Se-
cond-sightedness.
r
In about Half a Year, the doctor taught
his little Dumb Pupil, First, to know his
letters ; then to name any Thing whatsoever ;
to leave off some Savage Motions, which he
had taken of his own accord , before to fig
nify his Mind by, and to impart his
J- -- - u Thoughts
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. 37
Thoughts by his Fingers and his Pen, in a
Manner as intelligible, and almost as swift
thro' the Eyes, as that is of conveying our
Ideas to one another by our Voices, thro' the
Conduitrand Port-holes of theEars. But in
little more than Two Years, he could write
and read as well as any body. Because a
great many People cannot conceive this, and
others pretend it is not to be done in Nature ,
I will a little discourse upon Dr. Watiiss Foun
dation, and shew in a Manner obvious to the
most ignorant, how this hitherto mysterious
Help may be easily administred to the Deaf
and the Dumb ; which shall be the subject of
the ensuing chapter.
But I cannot conclude this, without telling
the handsome saying, with which this Child,
( when not quite Six Years old ) as soon as he
thought he could express himself well, paid his
first Acknowledgment to his Master j and
which promised how great his future Genius
was to be, when so witty a Child ripen 'd into
Man. The Words he wrote to him were
these ,• only alter'jd into EngUJhx from the Scots
dialect,.
Sir, It is no little Work you have accom
plished : My Thanks are too poor an Amends :
The World, Sir, shall give you Thanks ; for
as Icould not have express d my self without
your teaching me, so those that can talk,
tho they have Eyes, cannot feel the Things

Chap. III.
The Method of Teaching Deaf and Dumb
Persons to Write, Read , and understand
a Language.
IT
is, I must confess, in some Measure
amazing to me, that Men (of any mo
derate share of Learning) mould not natu
rally conceive of themselves a plain Reason
for this art, and know how to account for
the Practibility of it , the Moment they
hear the Proposition advanced ; the Reasons
for it are so obvious to the very first con
sideration we can make about it. It will
be likewise as amazing to me, that the most
ignorant should not conceive
it,
after
so
plain
a
Reason
is
given them for it, as
I
am now
going to set down.
To begin
:
How are Children at first
taught
a
language that can hear
?
Are they
not taught by Sounds
?
And what are thole
Sounds, but Tokens and Signs to the Ear,
importing and signifying such and such a
thing
?
If
then there can be signs made
to the eye, agreed
by
the Party teach
ing
os Mr. Duncan Campbell, 39
ing the Child, that they signify such and such
a Thing ; will not the Eye of the Child con
vey them to the Mind, as well as the ear ?
They are indeed different Marks to different
senses ; but both the one and the other do
equally signify the fame Things or Notions,
according to the Will of the Teacher, and
consequently, must have an equal effect with
the Person who is to be instructed : For tho'
the Manners signifying are different, the
Things signified are the fame.
For Example : If, after having invented an
Alphabet upon the Fingers, a Master always
keeps Company with a Deaf Child, and
teaches it to call for whatsoever it wants, by
such Motions of the Fingers, which ifput down
by Letters, (according to each invented Mo
tion of each Finger) would form in Writing
a Word of a Thing, which it wanted ; might
not he, by these regular Motions, teach its
Eye the fame Notions of Things, as Sounds
do to the Ears of Children that hear ? The
Manner of Teaching the Alphabet by Fin
gers, is plainly described in this Plate.
When the Deaf Child has learn'd by these
Motions a good Stock of Words ; as Chil
dren that hear, first learn by Sounds ; we
may methinks call (not improperly) the Fin
gers of such a dumb Infant its mouth, and
the Eye of such a deaf Child its Ear. When
he has learn'd thus far, he must be taughfNto
D^ Write
/
.-■
40 The Life and Adventures
write the Jlphabet,zccord'mg as it was adapt
ed to the Motions of his Fingers. As for In
stance, the Five Vowels, a, e, i, o, u, by
pointing to the Top of the Five Fingers ; and
the other Letters, b, c, d, &c. by an other
Place or Posture of a Finger, as in the Plate
is represented ; or otherwise, as mall be
agreed upon. When this is done, the Marks
B, R, E, A, D, (and so of all other Words)
corresponding with fore finger, conveys
thro' his Eyes unto his Head the fame Noti
on, viz. the Thing signified , as the Sound
we give to those same Letters, making the
Word bread do into our Heads thro' the
Ears.
This once done, he may be easily taught
to understand the Parts of Speech ; ss the
verb, the Noun, Pronoun, &c. And so by
Rules of Grammar and Syntax, to compound
ideas, and connect his Words into a Lan
guage. The Method of which, since it is
plainly set forth in Dr. Walfe's Letter to
Mr. Beverly, I shall set it down by way of
extract ; that People in the same Circum
stances with the Person we treat of, and of
the like Genius, may not have their Talents
Jost for want of the like Assistance.
When once a Deaf Person has learned so far,
as to understand the common Discourse of
others, and to express his Mind (tolerably
well) in Writing ; I fee no Room to doubt, but
that (provided Natu/e l*as endow'd him with
a pro
Of 31r.-DUNCANCAMPBELLi \\
a proper Strength of Genius, as other Men
that hear) he may become capable (upon
farther Improvement) of such farther Know
ledge as is attainable by Reading. For I
must here join with the Learned Doctor
Wallis, in affecting, as to the present Cafe
before us.) that no Reason can be assigned,
why such a Deaf Person may not attain the
understanding of a Language as pcrfeBly as
those that hear ; and with the seme Learned
author, I take upon me to lay down this
Proposition as certain, that allowing the
, Deaf Person the like Time and Exercise, as
to other Men is requisite in order to attain
the perfection of a Language, and the Ele
gance of
it,
he may understand as well, and
Write as good Language as other Men
;
and
abating only what doth depend upon Sound,
as Tones, Cadencies, and such Punctilio's,
no whit inferior to what he may attain to,
if
he had his hearing as others have.
An ExtraS from Dr. Wallis, concerning the
Method
of
Teaching the Deaf and Dumb
to Read.
ITis
most natural (as Children learn the
Names of Things) to furnish him (by
degrees) with
a
Nomendator, containing
a
Competent Number of Names of Things
common and obvious to the Eye (that you
may shew the Thing answering to such
a
Name)

Name) and these digested under convenient
Titles j and placed under them, in such con
venient order fin several Columns, or other
orderly Situation in the paper as (by their
Position) best to express to the Eye, their
Relation or Respect to one another. As
contraries or Correlatives, one against the
other ; Subordinates or Appurtenances under
their Principle, which may serve as a kind of
Local Memory.
Thus (in one Paper) under the Title Man
kind, may be placed ("not confusedly, but in
decent order) Man, Woman, Child Boy,
Girl.
In another Paper, under the Title Body,
may be written (in like convenient Order)
Head ("Hair, Skin, Ear) Face, Forehead,
Eye (Eyelid, Eyebrow) Cheek, Nose, (No
stril) Mouth (Lip, Chin) Neck, throat,
Back, Breast, Side, (Right-Side, Left-Side)
Belly, Shoulders, Arm fElbow, Wrist JHand,
(Back, Palm) Finger (Thumb,KnuckIe,Nailj
Thigh, Knee, Leg, (Shin, Calf, Ancle) Foot,
(~Heel, Sole, Toe.)
And when he hath learned the Import of
Words in each Paper, let him write them
in like Manner, in distinct Leaves, or Pages
of a Book ("prepared for that purpose) to
confirm his Memory, and to have Recourse
to it upon Occasion.
In a Third Paper, you may give him the
Inward Parts ; as Skull (Brain) Throat

And under each of these, as distinct Heads,
the Furniture or Utensils belonging there
unto ; with Divisions and Subdivisions, as
there is occasion ; which I forbear to Men

And in like manner, from Time to Time,
may be added more collections, or Clauses
of Names or Words, conveniently digested,
under distinct Heads, and suitable Distribu
tions ; to be written in distinct Leaves, o\
Pages of his Book, in such Order, as may
seem convenient.

Number of Names, though not so many as
I have mentioned : It will be seasonable to

gulars , by adding S or Es. As Hand
Hands, Face Faces, Fish Fifties, &c. with some
few irregulars, as Man Men, Woman Wo
men, Foot Feet, Tooth Teeth, Mouse, Mice,
Lowse Lice, Ox Oxen, &c.
Which, except the Irregulars, will serve for
Poslessives, to be after taught him \ which are
formed by their Primitives by like Addition of
S or Es, except some few irregulars, as My
Mine, Thy Thine, Our Ours, Your Yours,
His, Her, Hers, Their Theirs, &c.
And in all those, and . other like Cases, it
will be proper first to shew him the Parti
culars, and then the General Title.
„ Then teach him in another page, or Paper,
the Particulars, a, an, the, this, that, these,
those.
- And the Pronouns, I, me, my, mine, thou,
thee, thy, thine, we, us,our,ours,ye,you,your,
yours, he, him, his, she, her, hers,
it,
it's, they,

Then under the Titles Substantive Ad]e-_
Uive, teach him to Connect these
;
as, My
Hand, your Head, his Foot, his Feet, her
Arm, her Arms, our Hats, their Shoes, Johns
Coat, Williams Band, &c.
And
in
order to furnisti him with more
Adjectives, under the Title Colours, you
may place, Black, White, Gray, Green, Blue,
Yellow, Red, &c. And having shewed the
particulars, let him know that these are

called Colours. The like for Taste and Smell,
as Sweet, Bitter, Sour, Stink.
And for Hearing ; Sound, Noise, Word.
Then for Touch or Feeling : Hot, Warm,
Cold, Cool, Wet, Moist, Dry, Hard, Soft,
Tough, Brittle, Heavy, Light, &c.
From whence you may furnish him with
more Examples of Adjectives with Substan
tives ; as, White Bread, Brown Bread, green
Grafs, soft Cheese, hard Cheese, black Hat,
my black Hat, &c.
And then inverting the Order, substantive,
adjective, with the Verb Copulative between.
As, Silver is White, Gold is Yellow, Lead is
heavy, Wood is light, Snow is white, Ink is
black, Flesh is soft, Bone is hard, I am sick,
I am not well, &c. which will begin to give
him some Notion of Syntax.
In like Manner, when Substantive and Sub
stantive are so connected ; as Gold is a Me
tal, a Rose is a Flower ; they are Men, they are
Women, Horses are Beasts, Geese are Fowls,
Larks are Birds, &c.
Then as those before relate to quality, you
may give him some other Words relating to
quantity ; as long, short, broad, narrow,
thick, thin ; high, tall, low ; deep, (hallow,
great, big, small (little) much, little ; many,
few, full, empty ; whole, part, piece ; all,
some, none, strong, weak, quick, flow, equal*
unequal, bigger, less.

Of Motion ; as Move, Stir, Rest, Walk,
Go, Come, Run, Leap, Ride, Fall, Rife, Swim,
Sink, Drawn, Slide, Creep, Crawl, Fly, Pull,
Draw, Thrust, Throw, Bring, Fetch, Carry.
Then Words relating to Time , Place,
Number, Weight, Measure, Money, &c. are
in convenient Time, to be shewed him di
stinctly ; for which the Teacher according to
his Discretion, may take a convenient Sea
son.
As likewise the Time of the Day ; the
Days of the Week, the Days of the Month,
the Months of the Year ; and other Things
relating to the Almanack, which he will
quickly be capable to understand, if once
Methodically shewn him.
As likewise the Names, and Situation of
Places, and Countries, which are conveni
ent for him to know ; which may be order
ly written in his Book, and mewed him in
the Map of London, England, Europe, the
World, &c.
But these may be done at leisure, as like
wise the practice of Arithmetick, and other
like Pieces of Learning.
In
^ The Lif£ mid Adventures
In the mean time, after the Concord of
substantive and adjective, he is to be shew
ed by convenient examples, that of the No
minative and verb. As for instance : I go,
you see, he fits, they stand, the Fire burns,
the Sun shines, the Wind blows, the Rain
falls, the Water runs ; arid the like, with the
Titles in the top Nominative, Verb.
After this, (under the Titles Norriinative,
Verb, Accusatives give him Examples of
Verbs Transitive ; as, I see you, you see me,
the Fire burns the Wood, the Boy makes the
Fires the Cook roasts the Meat, the Butler
lays the Cloth, we eat our Dinner.
Or even with a double Accusative ; as you
teach me Writing or to Write, John teacheth
me to Dance, Thomas tells me a Tale,
&c.
After this, you may teach him the Flexi
on or Conjugation of the Verb, or what is
Equivalent thereunto ; for in our English
Tongue, each Verb hath but two Tenses, the
Present and the Preter, two Participles, the
Active and the Passive, all the rest is perform-
ed by auxiliaries, which Auxiliaries have no
more Tenses than the other Verbs.
'
'.
Those Auxiliaries are, Do, did, will, would,
shall, should, may, might, can, could, must,
ought, to, have, had, am, be, was. And if by
examples you can insinuate the Signification",
of these few Words, you have taught him the
whole Flexion of the verb.
Arid

And here it will be convenient, once fof
al), to write him out a full Paradigm of some
one Verb, (suppose to,
see) through all those
Auxiliaries.
The Verb it self hath tjut these Four Words
to be learn'd ; see, saw, seeing, seen ; savfl
that after thou, in the Second Perlbn Singu-*

in
the

Then to the Auxiliaries, do did, will would,

after have, had, am, be, was, the Passive Par

different ; and therefore it is convenient here
to give a Table of Verbs, especially the most
usual, for those Three Cases, which may at
once teach their Signification and Formati
on : As, boil boiled, rost rosted rolled, bake
baked baked, &c. teach taught taught, bring
brought brought, buy bought bought, &c.
fee saw seen, give gave given, take took ta
ken , forsake forsook forsaken , write wrote

The Verbs being thus dispatched, he is
then to learn the Prepositions ; wherein lies
the whole Regimen of the Noun. For Di
versity of Cafes we have none ; the Force of
which is to be insinuated by Convenient Ex
amples, suited to their different Significati
ons. As for Instance, Of ; a Piece of Bread,
a Pint ofWine, the Colour of'a Pot, the Colour
c/Go!d, a Ring ofGold, a Cup o/Silver j the
Mayor of London, the longest ofbVL, &c.
And in like manner, for off" on upon to
unto, till until, from at in within, out with
out, into out of, about over under, above be
low, between among, before behind after,
for, by, with, through, against, concerning :
And by this Time, he will be pretty well
enabled to understand a single Sentence.
In the last Place ; He is in like manner
to be taught Conjunctions, which serve to
connect not Words only, but Sentences : As,-
and also, likewise, either or whether, neither
nor*
cf-Mr. Duncan Campbell, si
nor, if then, why, wherefore, because, there
fore, bgt, though, yet, &c. and these illu
strated by convenient examples in each Cafe :
As, Because J am cold, therefore t go to the
fire, thaf I may be warm, for it is cold Wea
ther.
If it were fair, then it would be good
walking j bu$ however, though it rain, yet I
must go, because I promised : With other
like instances.
And by this Time, his book, if well for
ftifh'd with Plenty of Words, arid those well
digested under several Heads, and in good
order, and well recruited from Time to Time
as new Words occur, will serve him in the
&atuj$ of i Dictionary and Grammar.
And in cafe the Deaf Person be otherwise
of a good natural Capacity, and the Teach
er of a good Sagacity ; by this Method, pro
ceeding gradually Step by Step, you may,
£with Diligerice, and due Application of
Teacher and Learner,) in a Year's Time, or
fcb.ereabou.ts, perceive a greater progress than
you would expect, and a good Foundation
-laid for further instruction in Matters of Re
ligion , and other Knowledge which may be
taught by Books.
It will be -convenient all alorlg to have
Pen, Ink, and Paper ready at Hand, to write
,down in a word what you signify to him by
signs, and cause him to write, or shew hoys

way of signifying their Mind by Signs, Deaf
Persons are often very good at. And we
must endeavour to learn their language, it I
may so call it, in order to teach them ours ;
by (hewing what Words answer to their
Signs. . , . .
Twill be necessary also, as you go
along, after some convenient Progress made,
to express (in as plain Language as may
be) the Import of some of the Tables : As*
for instance,
'
The Head is the highest Part of the Body,
the Feet the lowest Part : The Face is the
Forepart of the Head : The Forehead is over
the Eyes ; the Cheeks are under the Eyes :
The Nose is between the Cheeks ; the Mouth
Is under the Nose , and above the Chin,
And such plain Discourse put into Writing,
and particularly explain'd, will teach him by
degrees to understand plain Sentences. And
like Advantages a sagacious Teacher may
take, as occasion offers it self from Time to

Speaking ; I thought it might not be amiss,
(in the Life of so particular a Dumb Person^
I am writing) to give them this small but par
ticular Fragment of Grammar and Syntax.
It is exactly adjusted to the Englifi Tongue;
because such are the Persons with whom the
Doctor had to deal, and such the Persons
whose Benefit alone I consult in thisTreatise.
One of the Chief Persons, who was taught
by Dr. Wallie, was Mr. Alexander Popham,
Brother-in-Law (if I am not mistaken) to
the present Earl of Oxford ; and he was a
very great Proficient in this way ; and, tho'
he was born deaf and dumb , understood
the language so well, as to give under his
Hand many rare Indications of a Masterly
Genius. .
The Uncle of his present Sardinian Ma
jesty, as I have been credibly informed, had
the want of the fame Organs ; and yet was a
perfect Statesman , and wrote in Five or Six
different Languages elegantly well.
Bishop Bitrnet, in his Book of Travels, tells
us a Story almost incredible ; but tells it as a
Paslage that deserves our Belief. It is con
cerning a young lady at Genoa, who was
not only Deaf and Dumb, but Blind too

seems) into the bargain
;
and this Lady, ht

Manly in his Countrymen ; and his Father, so
soon as he was out of his Hanging-Sleeves, and

Kind of Dress, which is truly Antique and
Heroick. In this early Part of his Nonage,

In the Year 1685-, the Duke of Monmoutb
and the Earl of Argyll sailed out of the Ports
of Holland without any obstruction, the
Earl of Argyll in May with three Ships for
Scotland, and Monmouth in June with the
lame Number for England.
The Earl setting out first, was also the first
at Landing. Argyll having attempted to
land in the North of Scotland, and being
disappointed by the Vigilance of the Bishop
of/ the Orcades,- Landed;, in the weft, and
Incamped at New castle in the Province
of Lorn, which had belonged to him. He
omitted nothing that might draw over to him
all the malcontents in the Kingdom, whom
he thought more Numerous than they after
wards appeared to be. He dispersed about
his Declarations, wherein, after protesting,
that he had taken up Arms only, in Defence
of Religion and the Laws, against an unjust
Usurper (To he stiled King James the Second)
he invited all good Protestants, and such Scots
as would affect their Liberty, to join him
against a Prince, he said, who was got into
the Throne, to ruin the Reformation, and to
bring in Popery and Arbitrary Power. Next
he sent Letters to those he thought his Friends,
Camong whom was Mr. Archibald Campbell,
who according to the vast deference paid
byithe Scots to their Chief, joined him, tho'
in

\n his Heart of a quite different principle
to call them to his Assistance : He De
tached two of his Sons to make Inroads in
the Neighbourhood, and compel some by
Threats, others by mighty Promises to join
him. All his Contrivances could not raise
him above three Thousand men, with whom
he Incamped in the Isle of Boot, where he
was soon in a manner besieged by the Earl
of Dunl>arto?ty with the King's Forces, and
several other Bodies commanded by the
Duke of Gordon, the Marquis of Atbol, the
Earl of Arran, and other Great Men, who
came from all Parts to quench the Fire before
it grew to a head.
Pearl of Argyll being obliged to quit
'
a Post he could not make good, went over
into a Part of the Country of his own name,
where having hastily Fortified a Castle called
■Ettingrey, he put into it the Arms and Am
munition taken out of his Ships, which lay"
at Anchor under the Cannon of a Fort he
erected near that Place. There his Rout be

forces to make an incursion, one of his Par

next Day to Attack the Rebels, but they
gave him not so much time, for they palled

as soon as ever. Argyll could lcaroe rally Ger

How often, after he has been wallowing in
the Dust, have I my self seen nice squeamish
Widows help him up in their gilded Chariots
and give him a pleasant Ride with them,
that he might tell them they (should not long
lie alone ; little Duncan Campbell had as
much business upon his Hands as the Parsons
of all the Parishes in Edinburgh : He com
monly was consulted, and named the Couples
before the Minister joined them. Thus he
grew a rare Customer to the Toylhop, from
whence he most an end received Fees and
Rewards for his Advices. If Lady Betty
such a one, was foretold that she would
certainly have Beau such a one in Marriage ;
then little Duncan was sure to have a Hobby-
Horse from the Toyfhop as a Reward for
the promised Fop. If such a Widow that
was Ugly but very Rich, was to be pushed
hard for, as she pretended Ctho' in reality
easily won) little Duncan upon ensuring her
such a Captain, or such a Lieutenant Colonel,
was lure to be presented from the same Child's
Warehouse with a very handsome Drum, and
a Silver'd Trumpret.
If a Sempstress had an Itching desire for a
Parson, she would upon the first Assurance
of him, give this little Apollo a Pastboard
Temple, or Church finely painted, and a
Ring of Bells into the Bargain, from the
fame Toy-Office. .

<% The Life and Adventures
If a Housekeeper lost afiy plate,- the thief
was certain to be catch'd ; provided she took
little Master into the Store-Room, and asked
him the question, after she had given him
his Belly-full of sweetmeats.
Neither were the Women only his Corisul-
ters : The grave merchants, who were anxi
ous for many Ventures at Sea, applied to
the Boy, for his Opinion of their Security ; and
they looked upon his Opinion to be as safe, as
the Insurance-Office for Ships. If he but told
them , (tho' the Ship was just set Sail, and
a Tempest rose just after on the Ocean,) that
it would have a successful Voyage , gain the
Port designed, and return home safe laden
with the exchange of Traffick and Mer
chandize ; they dismissed all their Fears, ba-
nifli'd all their Cares, set their Hearts at Easej
•and safe in his Opinion , enjoy 'd a Calm of
Mind amidst a Storm of Weather.
I my self knew one Count Cog, an Eminent
Gamester ; who was a Person so far from bee
ing of a credulous Disposition, that he was an
Unbeliever in several Points of Religion, and
the next door to an Infidel. Yet as much as
he was a Stranger to Faith , he was master'd
and overpower'd so far in his Incredulity*
by the strange Events , which he had seen
come frequently to pass from the predictions
of this Child , that he had commonly daily
Access to this Boy, to learn his more adverse
arid more prosperous Hours of Gaming. At
first
of Mr. dun ca. $ Campbell. 6$
first indeed he would try, when the Child
foretold him his ill Fortune, whether it would
prove true ; and relying upon the mere Hazard
and Turn of the Dye, he had always (as he
Observed) a Run of
ill
Luck on those torbidr,
den Days, as he never fail
d
of Good,
if
he
chose the fortunate Hours directed by the
Boy. One Time above all the rest, just be
fore he was departing from Edinburgh
,
and
when the Season of Gaming was almost over,
most Persons of Wealth and Distinction witlv
drawing for Pleasure to their Seats
in
the,
Country, he came to young Duncan Campbell,
to consult
;
and was extremely solicitous to
know, how happily or unluckily he should
end that Term ("as we may call it) of the
Gamesters weighty Business^ viz. Flay
;
there
being
a
long Vacation likely to eriluej when
the Gaming-Table would be empty, and the
Box and Dice lie idle, and cease to rattle.
The Boy encouraged him
so
well with his
predictions on this Occasion
,
that Count
Cog went to the Toy-shop, brought him
from thence
a
. very fine ivory Totum,
(
as
Children call it)
a
pretty set of painted and
gilded little Nine-pins and
a
Bowl, and
a
large
Bag of Marbles
:
And what do you think
the Gamester got by this little Present and
the prediction of the Boy
?
Why, without
telling the least Tittle ot Falihood, within the
space of the last week's Play, the Gains of
Count Cog really amounted to no less than
F

66 The Life and Adventures
Twenty Thousand Pounds Sterling, Nets
Money.
Having mention'd these Persons of so many
different professions, by borrow'd Names, and
perhaps in a manner seemingly ludicrous ; I
would not have my Reader from hence take
occasion of looking upon my Account as fa
bulous : If I was not to make use of borrow'd
Names, but to tell the Real Characters and
Names of the Persons, I should do Injury to
those old Friends of his, who first gave Cre
dit to our young Seer ; while I am endeavour
ing to gain him the Credit and Esteem of new
ones , in whose way it has not yet happen'd
to consult him. For many Persons are very
willing to ask such questions as the foregoing
ones ; but few or none willing to have the
Publick told they ask'd them ; tho' they suc
ceeded in their wish, and were amply satisfy 'd
in their Curiosity. I have represented them
perhaps in a ludicrous manner ; because tho'
they are mysterious actions, they are still the
Actions of a Boy ; and as the Rewards he re-
ceiv'd for his Advices did really and truly
consist of such Toys as I mention'd, so could
they not be treated of in a more serious man
ner, without the Author's incurring a Magi
sterial Air of Pedantry, and shewing a Mind,
as it were, of being mighty grave and senten
tious about Trifles. There are however some
Things of greater Weight and Importance,
done by him in a more adyane'd Stage of Life,
. . 2 which
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. 67
which will be delivered to the Publick with
that Exactitude and Gravity which becomes
them ; and in some of those Relations, the
Names of some Persons that are concern'd,
shall be printed ; because it will not at all be
injurious to them, or because I have their
leave, and they are still living, to testify what
I shall relate.
In the mean time, as the greatest Part of his
Non-age was spent in Predicting almost innu
merable things, which are all however redu
cible to the General Heads above-mention'd ;
I will not tire the Reader with any Particu
lars j but instead of doing that, before I come
to shew his Power of divination in the more
active Parts of his Life, and when, after Re
moving from Edinburgh to London, he at last
made it his publick Profession ; I shall ac
count how such Divinations may be made ;
and divert the Reader with many rare Ex
amples (taken from several faithful and un
doubted Historians ) of Persons , who have
done the like before him, some in one way,
and some in another ; tho' in this he seems to
be peculiar, and to be (if I may be allow'd
the Expression ) a Species by himself alone in
the talent of prediction ; that he has collect-
ed within his own individual Capacity, all
the Methods which others severally us'd, and
with which they were differently and singly
gifted in their several Ways of foreseeing and
foretelling,
F z This
6S The Life and Adventures
This Art of Prediction is not attainable
any otherwise, than by these Three Ways :
First, It is done by the Company of Familiar
Spirits and Gem) ; which are of Two Sorts,
(some good, and some bad) who tell the gift
ed Person the Things of which he informs
other people, xdly, It is perform'd by the
Second Sight ; which is very various, and dif
fers in most of the Poflestbrs j it being but
a very little in some, very extensive and
constant in others j beginning with some in
their Infancy, and leaving them before they
come to Years : Happening to others in a
Middle Age ; to others again in an old age,
that never had it before, and lasting only for
a Term of Years, and now and then for a
very short Period of Time ; and in some in
termitting, like Fits as it were of Vision, that
leave them for a Time, and then return to be
as strong in them as ever : And it being in a
manner Hereditary to some Families , whose
Children have
i,t
from their Infancy (with
out Intermission) to
a
great old Age, and
even to the Time of their Death
;
which they
often foretel before
it
comes to pass, to
a
Day,
nay, even to an hour, idly,
It
is
attain'd by
the diligent Study of the lawful Part of the
Art of Magick.
Before
I
give the Reader an Account, (as
I
shall do
in
Three distinct Discourses) isty
Concerning the intercourse which Familiar
Spirits, viz. the good and bad Genij, have had,
and
of Mr. Dunca n Campb ell. 69
and continue to have to a great Degree with
some select Parts of mankind, idly, Concern
ing the wonderful and almost miraculous
Power of a Second Sight, with which many
(beyond all controversy) have been extraor
dinarily, but visibly gifted. And idly, Con
cerning the Pitch of perfection, to which the
Magick Science has been carry d and promo
ted by some adepts in that mysterious Art :
I will premise a few particulars about the Ge-
nij , which attended our little Duncan Camp
bell, and about the Second Sight, which he had
when yet a Child , and when we may much
more easily believe, that the Wonders he
perform'd and wrote of, must have been rar
ther brought about by the Intervention of
such Genij, and the Mediation of such a Sight ;
than that he could have invented such Fables
concerning them, and compass'd such Predi^
ctions, as seem'd to want their Assistance, by
the mere Dint of a Child's Capacity.
One Day, I remember, when he was
about Nine Years of Age, going early to the
House where he and his Mother lived, and
it being before his Mother was stirring, I
went into little Duncan Campbell's Room, to
divert my self with him : I found him sitting
up in his Bed, with his Eyes broad open, but
as motionless as if he had been asleep, or even
(if it had not been for a lively, beautiful Co
lour, which the little, pretty,fair, Silver-hair'd
Boy always had in his cheeks ,0 as if he had
F 3
been
70 Thous and Adventures
been quite dead. He did not seem so much as
to breathe : The Eyelids of him were so fix'd
and immovable, that the Eyelashes did not so
much as once shake, which the least Motion
imaginable must agitate : Not to fay that he
was like a Person in an Ecstasy, he was at least
in (what we commonly call) a Brown Study to
the highest Degree, and for the largest Space
of Time I ever knew. I, who had been fre
quently inform'd by People, who have been
present at the Operations of Second-sighted
persons, that, at the Sight of a Vision, the
Eyelids of the Person are erected, and the
Eyes continue staring till the object vanishes ,
I, I fay, fat my self softly down on his bedside,
and with a quiet Amazement observ'd him ;
avoiding diligently any Motion, that might
give him the least Disturbance, or cause in him
any Avocation, or Distraction of Mind, from
the Business he was so intent upon. I re-
mark'd, that he held his Headsideways, with
his Mouth wide open , and in a lifl'ning Po
sture ; and that after so lively a manner, as, at
the first general Thought, made me forget his
Deafness, and plainly imagine he heard some
thing, till the Second Thought of Reflection
brought into my Mind the Misfortune that
shut up all Paslage for any Sound through
his Ears. After a stedfast Gaze, which lasted
about Seven Minutes, he smiled, and stretch'd
his Arms, as one recovering from a Fit of In
dolence, and rubbed his eyes j then turning

towards me, he made the Sign of a salute,
and hinted to me upon his Fingers his De
sire for Pen, Ink and Papery which I reach d
him from a little Desk, that stood at his Beds
Feet.
Placing thePaper upon his Knees, he wrote
me the following Lines; which, together with
my answers I preserve by me, for their Ra
rity, to this very Day ; and which I have
transcribed Word for Word, as they form a
little Series of Dialogue.
Duncan Campbell. I am sorry Ican't flay
with you ; but Ishall see my pretty route and
my Lamb by and by, in the Fields near a little
Coppice, or Grove, where Igo often to play with
them ; and I would not lose their company for
the whole World : For they and I are mighty fa
miliar together ; and the Boy tells me every thing*,
that gets me my Reputation among the Ladies
and Mobility ; and you must keep it secret.
My Question. I will be sure to keep it se
cret. But how do you know you are to meet
them there To-day ? Did the little Boy ap
point you ?
Duncan Campbell. Yes, he did ; andfig ni-
fed, that he hadfever al Things to predict to me,
concerning "People that he foreknew would come
to me the Week following, to ask me Que(lions.
My Question. But what was you ltaring at,
when I came in ?
Duncan Campbell. Why, at that little Boy,
F 4
• '
that
t-
fjx The Lif e and Adv e ntiues
that f«w along with the Lamb Ispeak of; and
'twas then he made me the Appointment.
My Ques ion. How docs he do it i Does he
write ?
;
.'
Duncan Campbell. No, he writes sometime x,
but oftner bespeaks with his fingers, and migh
ty Swift : No Man can do itso quick, or write half
so soon. He has a little Bell in his Hand, like
that which my Mother makes me a Sign tojhake,
when (be wants the Servants ; with that he tie
kles my Brainfirangely, and gives me an incredi
ble Delight of Feeling in their) fide ofmy Head;
he usually wakes me with it in theMorning,when
he comes to make me an Appointment. I fancy,
'tis what you call Hearing , which makes me
mighty desirous Icould hear in your way ; 'Tis
sweeter to the Feeling, methinks, tha.nanyThing
is to the taste : It isju/l as
if my Head was tic
kled to death, as my Nurse used to tickle my Sides ;
but 'tis a different feeling, for it makes Things
like little Strings, tremble in my Temples, and
behind my Ears. Now I remember, I will tell
you what 'tis like, that makes me believe tis
like your Hearing, and that strange thing,
which you, that can speak, call Sound or Noise :
Because, when I was at Church with my Mo
ther, who told me the Bells could be heard ring
ing a Mile off ; as Iwas kneeling on the bench,
and leaning over the top ofthe Pew, and gnaw
ing the Board ; every time the man pull d the
Rope, I thought all my Head beat, as. if it
would come to pieces ; but jet it pleased me,
''•'■•'■■'■" '.'.''. methought,
of Mr. Duncan Campbell! 73
tnethought, rather than pairid me, and I would
be always gnawing the Board, when the Man
full'd the Rope, and I told my Mother the Rea
son : The feeling of that was something like the
little Bell, but only that made my Head throb
as if it would break, and this tickles me and
makes, as it were, little strings on the back
of my ears dance and tremble like any Thing ;
is not that like your way of Hearing ? —
Ifit
be, it is a sweet thing to hear. — It is more
pleasant than to see the finest Colours in the
World. — Jt
is,
something like being tickled
in
the Nose with a Feather till one Sneezes, or
like the feeling, after one strikes the Lee, when
it
has been numb ,or asleep
;
only, with this dif
ference, that those Two Ways give
a
Rain and
the other
a
Pleasure
;
I
remember too, when
I
had a great Cold for about Two months,
I
had a feeling something like it, but that was
blunt, dull, confused and troublesome.
Is
not
this like what you call Hearing
>
My Question.
It
is

ing, my Dear,
it
is
what we call Mustek.

his Cheeks are as red as a Cherry, and so are his
Lips ; and, when he breathes, it makes the Air
more perfumed than my mother's sweet Bags
that she puts among the Linnen ; he has got a
Crown of Roses, cowslips, and other flowers
upon his Head, such as the Maids gather in
May ; his hair is like fine Silver Threads,
and shine like the Beams of the Sun ; he wears
a loose veil down to his Feet, that is as Blue
as the sky in a clear Day, and embrroider'd
with Spangles, that look like the brightest Stars
in the Night ; he carries a Silver Bell in one
Hand, and a Book and Pencil in the other ;
and he and the little Lamb will dance and
leap about me in a Ring as high as my Head;
the Lamb has got a little Stiver Collar -with
nine little Bells upon it ; and every little
piece of Woo co upon its Back, that is as white
as Milk, is tied up all round it in puffs like a
little Misses Hair, with Ribbands of all Co
lours ; and round its Head too are little Roses
and Violets fuck very thick into the Wool that
grows upon its Forehead, and behind and be
tween its Ears in the Shape of a Diadem.
They first meet me dancing thus j and after
they have dancdsome time,the Little Boy writes
down wonderful Things in his book, which I
write down in mine ; then they dance againy
till he rings his Bell, and then they are gone

all of a sudden Iknote not where ; but Ifeel
the Ticklir.fr in the hif.de lny Head, caus d hf
the Bell, less and less, till Idon't fee! it at all ;
and then Igo home, read over my Left :n m?
Book, and when I. have it by heart, Iburn the
written Leaves, according as the little Boy
bids me, or he would let me have no more.
But I hear the little Bell again ; the little boy
is angry with me ; be pull d me Twice by the
Ear, and I would not displease him for any
Thing ; so Imuft get up, and go immediately^
to the Joy and Delight of my Life.
I told him he might, if he would promise
me to tell me more another Time : He said
he would, if I would keep it secret. I told
him I would ; and so we parted : Tho' quit
before he went, he said he smelt some Venison,
and he was sure they would shortly have
some for Dinner : And nothing was be fore,
as that my Man had my Orders to bring a Side
of Venison to me the next Day to Mrs. Camp,
bell's ; for I had been Hunting, and came hi
ther from the Death of a Deer that Morning ;
and intended, as usual, to make a Stay them
for Two or Three Days.
There are, I know, many Men of severe
Principles, and who are more strict, Grave
and formal, in their Manner of Thinking,
than they are Wife ,• who will be apt to judge
of these Relations, as Things merely Fabulous
and Chimerical, and, not contented with be

bour to insinuate into others this pernicious
Notion, that it is a Sign of Infirmity and
Weakness in the Head, to yield them Credit.
But tho'I could easily argue these Sir Gravities
down ; tho' a Sentence or Two would do
their business , put them beyond the Power
of replying, and strike them dumb ; yet do
I think it not worth my while : Their greatest
and most wonted objection against these Eu-
dœmons and Caeodœmons, being, that it arises all
from the Work of Fancy, in Persons of a me-
lancholick Blood. If we consider the Nature
of this Child's Dialogue with me, will it not
be more whimsically strange and miraculous,
to fay, that a Child of Nine Years old had
only a Fancy of such Things as these, of which
it had never heard any body give an Account, .
and that it could by the mere Strength of Ima
gination predict such Things as really after
came to pass j than it is (when it does so
strangely predict Things) to believe the Child
does it, in the Manner it self owns it does ;
which is by the Intervention of a good Dœmony
or a happy Genius
.<?
Departing therefore from
these singular wife Mens Opinions, who will
believe nothing Excellent can happen to o-
thers, which
it
has not been their Lot to en
joy
a
Share of
;
I
shall take my Farewel hasti
ly
of them (without losing my own Time,
or theirs)
in
the Words of the Ingenious and
Learned Monsieur Le Clerc
:

tra&ent., aut quorum Judicij ulla ratio Dec

I shall rather Tee how far these Things have
lain open to the Eyes of, and been explain'd
by the Ancient Sages : I will relate who
among them were happy in their Genij, and
who among the Moderns ; whose Examples
may be Authorities for our Belief. I will set
down as clearly as I can, what Perception
Men have had of Genij, or Spirits, by the
Sense of Seeing ; what by the Serife of Hear
ing ; what by the sense of Feeling, Touching
or Tasting ; and, in fine, what Perception o-
thers have had of these Gentj by all the Senses ;
what by Dreams, and what by Magick ; a
thing rarely to be met with at once in any
single Man, and which seems particular to
the Child who was the subject of our last
little Historical Account. When I have
brought Examples, and the Opinions of wise
Philosophers, and the Evidence of undeniable
Witnelles ; which one would think sufficient
to evince Persons, of the Commerce Men have
with Spirits, if they were not past all Sense of
Conviction ; I mail, not so much to corrobo
rate what I fay, as to shame some Wiseacres,
who would by their frail Reason scan all
things, and pretend to solve the Mysteries
ascribed to Spirits, as facts merely natural,
and who would banish from the Thoughts
of Men all Belief of Spirits whatsoever ; I
lhall,I fly, (in order to put to shame these Wise
acres,
r
+
>*
78 The Life and Adventures
acres, if they have any Shame left) produce
the Opinions of the Fathers as Divines, ihew
the Doctrine of Spirits in general to be con
sistent with Christianity ; that they are deli
vers in the Scripture, and by Christian Tra
dition ; in which if they will not acquiesce, I
shall leave them to the Labyrinth of their
own wild Opinions, Which in the end will
so perplex their Judgments of Things, that
they will be never able to extricate themselves.
And these different Heads will be the Subject
of the Chapter ensuing ; and will (or I am
greatly mistaken ) form both an instructive,
edifying and entertaining Discourse, for a Rea
der really and truly intelligent, and that has a
good Taste and Relish for sublime Things.

IT
is said in the Ninth Book of the Mo

is,
no doubt, an admira
ble Proposition, and speaks the lofty Aims

of that sublime Mind from whence it pro
ceeded. Among all the Disquisitions in this
kind, none seem to me more excellent, than
those, which treat concerning the Genii, that
attend upon Men, and guide them in the
actions of Life. A Genius or Damon of the
good Kind is a sort of mediate Being, between
Human and Divine, which gives the Mind of
Man a pleaiant Conjunction with Angelick
and Celestial Faculties, and brings down to
Earth a faint Participation of the Joys of
Heaven. That there have been such fortu
nate Attendants upon wise Men, we have
many rare instances. They have been ascri
bed to Socrates, Aristotle, Plot'mus, Porphyri-
us, Jantblicus, Cbicus, Scatter and Cardan,
The most celebrated of all these Ancients was
Socrates ; and as for his having a Genius or
Damon, we have the Testimonies of Plato,
Xenophon and Antisthenes, his Contemporaries,
confirm'd by Laertius, Plutarch, Maximua
Tyrius, Dion Chrysostomus, Cicero, Apuleius,
FicinMy and others, many of the Moderns be
sides Tertullian-, Origen,Clemens Alexandrinus,
Austin and others ; and Socrates himself in
Plato s Theage, fays, By some Divine Lot I
have a certain Damon, which has followed
me from my Childhood as an Oracle ; and in the
fame Place intimates, that the Way he gain'd
his instruction was by hearing the Damons
"Voice. Nothing is certainly so easy as for
Men to be able to contradict Things, tho' ne
ver
r
8o The Life and Adventures
Ver so well attested with such an Air of Truth,
as to make the Truth of the History doubted
by others as well as themselves where no
demonstrative Proof can be brought to con
vince them. This has been the easy Task
of those who object against the Demon of So
crates ; but when no demonstrative Proof is
to be had on either Side, does not Wisdom
incline us to lean to the most Probable ? Let
us then consider whether the Evidences are
not more credible, and Witnesses of such a
thing are not Persons of more authority,
than these Men are, who vouchsafe to give
no reason but their own incredulity for main
taining the contrary; and whether those there
fore by the right rule of judging, ought not
much sooner than these, to gain over our,
Assent to their Assertions ?
We will however, laying aside the Histo
ries of those ancient Times, the Sense where- .
ofj by Various Readings and Interpretations
being put upon the Words, is render d obj
seiire and almost unintelligible, descend td
more modern Relations, the facts whereof
shall be placed beyond doubt, by reason of the
Evidences we will bring to attest them, and
mail consequently prove the Perception Men
have of Spirits or Gen)] by every sense.
SECTION I.
We will first begin as to the perception of
Spirits by the Sight.

had no Cause to fear him, he being his Friend,

in the Field, which -had he not followed, he
had been before now perfectly in the Power

he concluded it was impossible, but that he
should have been carried away the day be

In Luther's Colloquia Mensalia, or Table-
Talk, set forth in Latin at Frankfort* Anno
if57V (it being a different Collection from
that of Aurifaber, which is translated from
High-Dutch into English ; ) we have the fol
lowing Relation. . ;
[ It happen'd in Vmjsia, that as a certain
Boy was born , there presently came to him
a Genm, or what you please to call it, (for
I leave it to Men's Judgments;) who had so
faithful a Care of the Infant, that there was
no need cither of Mother or Servant j and
as he grew up, he had a like Care of him.
He went to School with him ; but so, that
he could never be seen, either by himself,
or any ethers, in all his Life. Afterwards
he travell'd into Italy ; he accompanied him,
and whensoever any Evil was like to hap
pen to Jiim , either on the Road or in the
Inn , he was perceiv'd to foretel it by some
Touch or Stroke : He drew off his Boots,
as a Servant. If he turn'd his Journey ano
ther way, he continued with him ; having
the fame Care of him in foretelling Evil.
At length he was made a Canon ; and as
on a Time he was sitt.ng and "feasting
with his Friends, in much Jollity, a vehe
ment
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 89
ment Stroke was struck on a sudden, on the
Table, so that they were all terrify'd : Pre
sently the Canon said to his Friends, Be not
afraid ; some great Evil hangs over my Head.
The next Day he fell into a great Fever, and
the Fit continued on him for Three whole
Days, till he died miserably. ?
, Captain Henry Bell, in his Narrative pre-
fixed to Luther's Table-Talk, printed in Eng
lish, Anno 165-2, having acquainted us how
the German Copy printed of it had been dis-
cover'd under Ground, where it had lain hid
Fifty two Years ; that Edition having been
suppress'd by an edict of the Emperor Rudol-
phus II. so that it was Death for any Person
to keep a Copy thereof : And having told u$
that Cafparus Van Spar, a German Gentleman,
with whom he was familiarly acquainted,
while he negotiated Affairs in Germany for
King James I. was the Person that discovered
it,
Anno 16*6, and transmitted
it
into Eng
land to him
,
and earnestly desired him to
translate the said book into English, says, he
accordingly set upon the Translation of
it
many times, but was always hinder'd from
proceeding
in
it,
by
some intervening Business.
About Six Weeks after he had received the
Copy, being
in
Bed with his Wife one Night,
between Twelve and One of the Clock,
(
she
being asleep, but himself awake
;
)
there ap-
pear'd to him an ancient Man standing at his
bedside, array
'd
all
in
White, having
a
long
and
$6 ?bt Lay % and A d te tfiru r e s
and broad white beard hanging down to
his Girdle ; who taking him by his right Egr^
laid thus to him : Sirrah ! Will you not take
Time to translate that book, which is sent
unto you out of Germany / I will shortly pro
vide for you both place and time to do it'»
And then he vanish'd. Hereupon being much
affrighted, he fell into an extream Sweat y so
that his wife awaking, and finding him all
over wet , she ask'd him what he ail'd i He
told her what he hand heard ; but he
never regarded Visions nor dreams, and so
the same fell out of his Mind. But a Fort
night after, being on a Sunday at his lodging
in King's-
fir
eet, Westminster, at dinner with
his wife, two Messengers were sent from
the whole Council-Boards. with
a
warrant to
carry him to the Gatehouse, there to be kept
till farther Order from the Lords of the
Council
;
upon which Warrant he was kept
there Ten whole Years close Prisoner, where
he spent five Tears of
it
in
Translating the
said Book
;
having good. Cause to be mindful
of the Old Man's saying,

■< An agedlGentleman, one Parker, as I now
remember,' having formerly belonged unto
the Duke , or of great Acquaintance with
the Duke's Father, and now retired, had a
Damon appear 'd several Times to him, in the
Shape of Sir George ViUars, the Duke's Fa
ther. This Damon walfc'd many times in
Parkers Bed-Chamber, without any Action
of Terror, Noise, Hurt or Speech ; but at
last, one Night, broke out in these Words :
Mr. Parker, I know you lov'd me formerly,,
and my Son George at this Time very well :
I would have you go from me, (you know
me very well to be his Father, old Sir George
ViUars, of Leicestershire ; ) and acquaint him'
with these and these Particulars , &c. and
that he above all refrain the Council and
Company of such and such, (whom he then
nominated') or else he will come to Destru
ction, and that suddenly. Parker, tho' a ve
ry discreet Man , partly imagin'd himself in
a Dream all this Time ; and being unwil
ling to proceed upon no better Grounds, for
bore addressing himself to the Duke ; for he
conceived, if he sliould acquaint the Duke
with the Words of his Father, and the Man
ner of his Appearance to him, (such Appa
ritions being not usual) he should be laugh' d
at, and thought, to doat, in regard he was
4g«d:\ Some few Nights pass'd without fur
ther
os Mr. DuxcakCampJej.it 93
ther Trouble to the old Man : But not ray
many Nights after, old Sir George VjLer: ap
peared again, walkd quick and furiously in
the Room, seem'd angry wkh Parker, and at
last (aid, Mr. Parkers I thought yon had been
my Friend so much,, and lovd ray Son Ge**£c
Ib well , that you would have acquainted
him with what I desired ; but. I know yon
have not done it By all the Friendihip that
ever was betwixt you and me, and the great
RespeSt you bear my Son, I desire you to de
livery what I. formerly commanded you, to
my Son. The old Man seeing himself thus
solicited, promised the D*m*» he would ; bat
first argued it thus ; That the Duke was not
easy to be spoken withal ; and that be would
account bint a. vain Man , to come with suck
a Message from the Dead :■ Nor did he con*
eeiVe the Duke would gjive any Credit to
him. To which the Damon thus ans* er d : If
he will not believe you have this Discourse
from me, tell him ofsncb a Secret, (and nam/d
itO which freJmows none

knew but jny sty and him. Mr. Barker )£-

and that the Apparition was not

a

and seriously ac

and the Manner of his Apparition.. The Duke
laugh 'd' heartily at the "Relation, which put
old Parker to

L. 1* haying given some

was.one (meaning this of Par her) which was

a

he tells us, that Parker was an Officer
in
the
King's Wardrobe in Windsor-Caftle, of
a
good
Reputation for Honesty and Discretion, and
then about the Age of Fifty Years* or more.

(the Father of the Duke) liv'd

much cherifh'd and obligct in. that Steason of

Duke, and was himself well receiv'd by him.'
He inform'd the Duke with the Reputation
and Honesty of the Man ; and Sir Ralph Free
man carryd the Man the next Morning , by
Five of the Clock, to Lambeth, according to
the Duke's Appointment, and there presented
him to the Duke ; who received him courte
ously at his Landing, and walk'd in Conference
near an Hour with him ; and Sir Ralph's and
the Duke's Servants at such a Distance, that
they heard not a word : But Sir Ralph always
fix d his Eyes on the Duke , who sometimes
spoke with great Commotion and Disorder ;
And that the Man told Sir Ralph, in their
^Return over the Water, that when he men-
t'wnd those Particulars that were to gain him
Credit, the Duke's Colour changed, and he
swore he could come to that Knowledge only
by the Devil ; for that those Particulars were
known 6niy to himself, and to one Person
more, who (he was sure.) would never speak
of them. So far the Lord Clarendon.
I will now subjoin an authentick Relation,
which Dr. Beaumont tells us at the End of
his Book of Genijy or Familiar Spirits, print
ed in the Year 1705-, he had just before re
ceived from the Mouth of Dr. Fowler , then
Bishop of Gloucester, himself. It is as fol
lows, Word for Word.
•
Sit Charles Lee, by his first Lady, had only
one Daugliter, of which she died in Child
birth j and when (he died, her Sister,. :the
• '. 'I- Lady
of ÆsKDtitfCAN CampbelI. 97
£ady Everard desir'd to have the Education
of the Child ; and she was by her very well
educated, till she was Marriageable ; and a
Match was concluded for her with Sir Wil
liam Perkins, but \v2ls then prevented in art
extraordinary rrianrler. Upon a Thursday -
Night, she thinking she saw a Light in her
Chamber after slie was in, Bed, knock'd for
her Maid, who presently came to her ; and
she ask'd why (he left a Candle burning in
her Chamber ? The Maid said, me left none ;
and there was none, but what she brought
with her at that Time. Then she said it was
the Fire : But that, the Maid told her, was
quite Out ; and said, she believ'd it was only
a Dfearh ; whereupon she said, it might be
so ; and compos'd her self again to Sleep : But
about Two of the Clock she was awaken'd a-
gain, and saw the Apparition of a little Wo
man, between her Curtain and her Pillow :
Who told her, she was her Mother ; and that
slie was Happy ; and that by Twelve of the
Clock that Day, ihe should be with, her :
Whereupon she knock'd again for her Maidj
Called for her Cloaths ; and when me was
dress'd, went into her Closet, and came not
but again till Nine ; and then brought out
with her a Letter seald to her Father, brought
it to her Aunt, the Lady Everard , told her
what had happen'd ; and desir'd, that as soorl
as Ihe was dead , it might be sent ro him i
But the Lady thought she was suddenly fallen
H V
■
Mad i
98 The Life and Adventures
Mad ; and thereupon sent presently away to
Cbelmsford, for a Physician and Surgeon, who
both came immediately ; but the Physician
could discern no Indication of what the Lady
imagined, or of any Indisposition of her Bo
dy ; notwithstanding the Lady would needs
have her let Blood, which was done accor
dingly : And when the young Woman had
patiently let. them do what they would with
her, file desir'd that the Chaplain might be
called to read Prayers ; and when Prayers
were ended, she took her Gitktar and Psalm-
book, and fat down upon a Chair without
Arms, and play'd and fung so melodiously
and admirably, that her Musick-Master, who
was then there, admir'd at it : And near the
Stroke of Twelve, me rose and sat her self
down in a great Chair with Arms j and pre
sently fetching a strong Breathing or two,
immediately expir'd ; and was so suddenly
cold, as was much wonder'd at by the Physi
cian and Surgeon. She died at Waltham, in
EJjex, Three Miles from Chelmsford ; and the
Letter was sent to Sir Charles, at his House
in Warwickshire ; but he was so afflicted with
the Death of his Daughter, that he came not
till she was buried : But when he came, he
caus'd her to be taken up, and to be buried
by her Mother at Edmonton, as she desir'd
in her Letter. This was about the Year One
Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty Two, or
Sixty Three. And this Relation the Right
z Reve
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 99
Reverend the Lord Bishop of Gloucester had
from Sir Charles Lee himself ; and Dr, Beau
foioht printed it in his Book abovemehtioned,
from the Bishop's own Mouth.
The Relations which I have given above,
are not like the trifling Accounts too often
given of these Things, and therefore causing
grave ones to be ridiculed in common with
them. They are of that Nature, that who
ever attempts to ridicule them, will, instead
of turning them into Jest, become the Object
of Ridicule himself.
The first Story, which has in it such ama
zing Circumstances, and such uncommon and
dreadful Incidents concerning the Butler in
Ireland, is (as the Reader fees) attested by no
left a personage than an Earl of Orrery ; Two
bishops, and many other Noblemen and Gen
tlemen, being present, and Eye- witnesses of
what the earl said. What greater Testimony
would the most incredulous have ? They
fry, such things are told for Interest : What
interest could an Earl, and many Noblemen
have, in promoting such an imposture ? The
incredulous fay likewise, Great and Learned
Men delight sometimes in putting Frauds up
on the World, and after laugh at their Creduli
ty. Would a Number of Noble Laymen chuse
Two Prelates to carry on such a Fraud ? And
would Two Pious Bijbops probably combine
with several^ and some Servants there present,
in spreading such a deceit ? 'Tis past belie-
H * ving,
291639K
ioo The Life and Adventures >
ving, and it demands the strictest of Moral
Faith that can be given, to the most unque
stioned History that the Pen of Man ever
wrote.
The Second Story is founded , first, upon
the Experience of one of the most ingenious
Men of that Age, Dr. Donne ; and then upon
the Proof made by his Friend, Sir Robert
Drury, who could at first scarce believe it :
And shall we doubt the Credit of Men, whose
Company ( for their Credit be it spoken) a
British Ambaslador was proud of gaining ?
The Third Story is told by Luther himself,
who began the great Work of the Reformation,
The Fourth is told by one that was a King's
Publick Minister, and told from his own Tri
al of the Matter, where he could have no in
terest in the telling it.
The Fifth is related by those great Histori
ans, the Lord Clarendon, and Sir Richard Ba
ker ; as a Truth rely'd upon by themselves,
and fit to be credited by their Readers.
The Sixth and last was related to Dr. Beau
mont, by the Lord Bishop of Gloucester, who
receiv'd the Account from Sir Charles Lee
himself, to whose Grand-Daughter the Mat
ter happen'd.
Men, who will not believe such Things as
these, so well attested to us, and given us by
such Authorities, because they did not lee
them themselves, nor any Thing of the like
Nature, ought not only to deny the Damon
of
of Mr. Duncan Campbell ioi
of Socrates j but that there was such a Man
as Socrates himself. They should not dispute
the Genij of Cæsar, Cicero, Brutus, Marc
Anthony ; but avow, that there were never
any such Men existing upon Earth, and over
throw all credible History whatsoever. Mean
while, all Men, but those who run such
Lengths in their fantastical Incredulity, will,
&om the Facts above-mention d, rest satisfied,
that there are such Things as Evil and Good
Genij ; and that Men have sometimes a Com
merce with them by all their senses, particu
larly those of Seeing and Hearing ; and will
not therefore be startled at the strange Frag
ments of Histories, which I am going to re
late of our young Duncan Campbell, and look
upon some wonderful Adventures which he
perform'd by the Intervention of his Familiar
Demon or Genius, as Falfhoods, only because
they are uncommon and surprizing ; more
especially since they were notdone inaCorner,
but by an open way of Profession of a Predi
ctor of Things, in the Face of the metropolis
of London, where he settled young ; as will
appear in the Progress of his Life. However,
some People, notwithstanding all this, may
alledge, that tho' a Man may have a Genius
appear to him, so as to convey into his Mind,
thro' his Senses, the Knowledge of Things
that are to come to pass ; yet this happens
but on very eminent and extraordinary Occa
sions. The Murder, for Example, of a Prime
H 3 Mini-
^
J
102 TkeLiiE and Adventures
Minister, and the Favourite of a monarch,
in such a manner as it was performed on the
Great Buckingham by Fehon, was a Thing
so uncommon, that it might perhaps deserve,
by the Permission of Heaven, an uncommon
Prediction. The others likewise are instances
eminent in their way, particularly that of
the Lady Everard's Niece : For that young
Lady being then Marriageable, and a Treaty,
for that End being on Foot with Sir William
Perkins ; the Divine Providence foreseeing
that such a State might call away her
thoughts, hitherto bent on him and Spiritual
Affairs, and fix them on the trifles of this
World, might perhaps permit her to be cal
led by a Holy Mother to the State of Hap
piness she before her enjoy
'd,
left her Daugh
ter
s
Mind should change, and me go into
the Ways of
a
Sinner. But
if
these super
eminent, these scarce and rare examples may
be admitted, of Man's holding
a
Conversati
on with the spiritualize! Beings of another
World
;
it
will, however, be far below the
Dignity of Human Reason, methinks, to make
such large concessions to People, vyhq pre
tend to converse that wonderful way, as. to
allow them the Credit of being able'to do
it
upon every flight Occasion, and eYejy
in
different Occurrence of Human Life.
I
cannot help acknowledging, that
a.
Man
of Wisdom may, at first thought
j
make such
an objection
j
but
Reflection willpresently
.
'
,',
'
retract
of Mr. Duncan Campbell, 103
retract it ; and the same good Sense that taught
him to make an objection so well upon the
first Thought, will teach him, upon second
Thoughts, to acquiesce in the Answer.
Infants may have, no doubt, the Benefit of
such an attending Genius, as well as people
more advanced in Years ; as may be seen in
one of the instances, which is a very famous
one, relating to the Boy born in Prussia, who
was attended by one constantly from the
Time of his Birth to his Death. Besides,
it is a Mistake in the Understanding, to ima
gine, that Death, which is the Determinati
on and End of Life, is of more Consequence
to be known, than the Manner of regulating
that life. For, in Reality, according to the
right way of considering, Death, or the De
termination of a Man's Life, derives its Im
portance from the Steps which he took in
the due Regulation of it ; and therefore e-
very the least Step , proper to be taken for
the due Regulation of Life, is of more Con
sequence to be known , than the Death of
a Person ; tho' this, at first Sight, carries
the Face of Significance, and the other no
thing better than the Look of a Trifle. Mar
riage, for Example, is a Step in Life of the
utmost importance, whether we consider that
Estate with Regard to this, or the next World.
Death is but the Finishing of one Person ; but
Marriage may be the introducing of many
into the World with Happiness : It is there-
H 4 fore
104 The Life and ^dventur es
fore a Thing of more importance to be known
beforehand, and consequently more worthy
of the Communication of a Genius to the Man
with whom he conversed. Pojfidonius tells
us, that a certain Rhodian dying, nominated
Six of his Equals, and said who should die
first, who next, and so on, and the Event
answer'd the Prediction ;why then (tho' some
People are apt to make a jest of
it)
may not
a
Man by the intervention of his good Ge
nius, tell
a
Woman, that
is
to have six Hus
bands, who she shall have first, who next,
and
so
on, and the Event answer the Predi
ction
>
If
Men of Learning may acquire such
Knowledge, as to attain to extraordinary
Things
by
their ordinary Faculties, why may
not ordinary things be taught others in this
extraordinary way
'?
For will any Body fay
that
it
is
easier for
a
Man to accommodate
himself to the knowledge of
a
Damon or Ge
nius-, than for
a
Dæmon or Genius to accom
modate himself to the knowledge of
a
Man
?
Certain
it
is
indeed that
if
this good Genius
(that endues
a
Man with
a
prophetic kind
of Science) be any Thing resembling
a
good
Angel, the primary end of his being permitted
to direct Mankind, must consist in Things re
lating more to their Welfare hereafter
j
yet
I
know not why they may not sometimes
in
spire, or openly direct them
in
human Know
ledge, and
in
Things relating to Human Life,
so
they are of
a
good Tendency
;
more espe-
'
dally
of Mr. Duncan Campbell! ioj
cially since such a good Inspiration may be
a Counter-balance to the bad Knowledge which
some have been inspired with by evil Spirits.
I would not be thought to go too far in a
Point of this Nature, and have therefore
("though perhaps I could fay much more if I
follow w'd entirely my own private Opinion,
and would venture to introduce it here, in
order to communicate it to others, and make
it a publick one) said no more on this Head
than what Divines generally teach.
But the most unexceptionable Mistress, that
teaches these Things to be in Nature, is Ex
perience. If we had very many People gifted
this Way, the extraordinary Thing would have
been become ordinary, and therefore I can't
help wondering that it should be so ordinary
a thing for wife Men themselves to wonder
too much at Things, because they are extra
ordinary, and suspect them as Frauds, because
they are uncommon.
There has scarce been any Period of Time,
in which some Person of this Prophetick Class,
has not existed, and has not been consulted
by the greatest of Men, and their predictions
found at the long run to come true; ignorant
Men always rife to their Belief of them by
Experience, and the most learned Men sub
mit their great Opinions to experience, but
your Men of middling Talents., who make up
their want of Reason with bustling Obstinacy
and noisy Contradiction, have been and still

continue to be their own Opposers, and with
out discovering the reason for what they say,
they content themselves with having the
Laugh on their Sides, and barely affirming
without proving, that it is a kind of ideal
juggle and intel/efiual Legerdemain, by which
these Modern Predictors impose Things up
on the Eye of Reason, as the corporeal Eye is
impos'd upon by sleight of Hand ; but it is a
strange Thing that Men of such quick Reason
can't give us a Sample of the Frauds. Thus I
remember, to have read (I can't tell where) a
Story of some Courtiers, who1 when a great
Artist of Legerdemain was to act before the
King, pretended to be so quick- sighted, that
nothing he did should escape their Discovery,
were left by his nimble Fingers in the Dark,
and sored at last with Blulhes to own they
had no better Eyes than other People. In
the
word,
if
People will be led
by
Suspicions and
remote Possibilities of Fraud and Contrivance
of such Men, all Historical Truth shall be
ended, when
it
consists not with
a
Man's pri
vate Humour or Prejudice to admit it. Now
therefore to prove
by
Experience and undeni
able Testimonies, that these kind of Genij
will submit to little Offices
in
order to bring
Men to greater good
;
I
will give the Reader
Three or Four curious Pallages, that will set
the -reasonable Reader at ease,and prepare him
for reading the passages of Mr. Campbell's Life
with Pleasure, and as
a
fine History of won
derful
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 107
dcrful facts, that though they seem to sur
pass belief yet ought to have his Credit.
What in Nature can be more trivial than
for a Spirit to employ himself in knocking on
a Morning at the wainscot by the Beds- head
of a Man who got Drunk over, night, ac
cording to the Way that such Things are or
dinarily explain'd i And yet I mail give you
such a Relation of this, that not even the most
devout and precise Presbyterian will offer to
call in question. For Mr. Baxter in his Histo
rical Discourse of Apparitions writes thus.
There is now in London an understanding
sober pious Man, oft one of my hearers, who
has an elder Brother, a Gentleman of consi
derable Rank, who having formerly seem 'd
Pious, of late Years does often fall into the
Sin of Drunkenness ; he often Lodges long to*
gether here in his Brother's House ; and when
soever he is Drunk and has slept himself So
ber, something knocks at his bed. s-head, as
if one knock'd on a Wainscot ; When they
remove his Bed it follows him : Besides other
loud Noises, on other Parts where he
is,
that
all the House hears
;
they have often watched
him, and kept his Hands lest he should do
it
himself
:
His Brother has often told
it
me,
and brought his Wife,
a
discreet Woman, to
attest
it
;
who avers moreover, that as she
watch'd him, she has seen his Shoes under
the Bed taken up, and nothing Visible to
touch them. They brought the man himself
■'.''.
V
to
io8 The Life and Adventures
to me, and when we ask'd him, how he dare
Sin again after such a Warning, he had no
Excuse : But being persons of quality, for
some special Reason of Worldly Interest I
must not name him.
Two Things are remarkable in this instance,
(fays Mr. Baxter ; ) jirjl, What a powerful
Thing Temptation and fleshly Concupiscence
is,
and what an harden'd Heart Sin brings
Men to
;
if one rose from the Dead to warn
such Sinners,
it
would not of
it
self persuade
them.
Secondly, (says Mr. Baxter) It poses me
to think what kind of Spirit this
is,
that has
such
a
care of this Man's Soul, which makes
me hope he will recover. Do good Spirits
dwell
so
near us, or are they sent on such
Meflages
>
Or
is
it
his Guardian Angel
?
Or
is
it
the Soul of some dead friend that suf
fers
;
and yet retaining Love to him as Dives
to his Brethren,would have him saved ?
God
yet keeps such Things from us
in
the Dark.
So far we have the Authority of the re-
nown'd and famous Mr. Baxter, who makes
this knocking of the Spirit at the Beds-head
(though what we commonly call frivolous)
an important Errand.
Another Relation of this Kind was sent to
Dr. Beaitmont
f
whom
I
my self personally
knew, and which he has inserted
in
his Ac-^
count of Genii or Familiar Spirits) in
a
Letter
by an ingenious and learned clergyman 6F
Wiltshire
;
who had given him the relation
likewise
of Mr. ISuncan Campbell 109
likewise before by Word of Mouth. It is as
follows. .
Near Eighty Years since, in the Parish of
Wilcot ("which is by the Devizes) in the Vi
car's House, there was heard for a conside
rable Time the sound of a Bell, constantly
telling every Night j the Occasion was this :
A debauch'd Person who liv'd in the Parish,
came one Night very late and demanded the
Keys of the Church, of the Vicar, that he
might ring a Peal, which the Vicar refused
to let him have, alledging the reasonable
nefs of the Time, and that he should by grant
ing his Desires give a Disturbance to Sir George
Wrovghton and his Family, whose House ad
joined to the Church-yard. Upon this Of
sal the Fellow went away in a Rage, threat
ening to be reveng'd of the Vicar, and going
some time after to the Devizes, met with one
Cantle or Cantlow, a Person noted in those
Days for a Wizard ; and he tells him how
the Vicar had serv'd him, and begs his Help
to be even with him. The Reply Cantel
made him was this : Does he not love Ring
ing ? He shall have enough of it : And from
that Time a Bell began to Toll in his House,
and continued so to do till CanteWs Death,
who confessed at Fifiierton Goal in Santrn,
fwhere he was confin'd by King James du
ring his LifeJ that he caus'd that Sound, and
that it should be heard in that place during
Life. The Thing was so notorious, that
Persons
no The Life and Adventures
Persons came from all Parts to hear it. And
King James sent a Gentleman from London,
on purpose to give him Satisfaction concern
ing the Truth of the Report. Dr. Beaumont
had likewise this Story as he tells, from the
Mouth of Sir George Wroughtoris own Son ;
with this remarkable Circumstance, That if
any in the House put their Heads out of the
Window, they could not hear the Sound ,• but
heard it immediately again, as soon as they
stood in the Room.
The Reader here fees, that good and bad
Geni'j exercise themselves upon very little
Functions ; Knocking at Beds-Heads, and
Ringing of Bells. For Proof of this, we have
the Testimonies of Two divines, of a Man
of Quality and Probity, and the fame Satis
faction that a Learned King had,' who sent to
enquire into the Matter : And after this, there
can be, I think, no room for Doubt.
But to carry the Point still nearer Home :
Inasmuch as I know some will leave no Stone
unturn'd, to make the Extraordinary actions,
which the Person whose Life I write, has
performed, appear Impostures ; and inasmuch
as for this End they may fay, that tho' many
People may have been gifted in this extraordi
nary manner, yet not so as to make a Pro
fession of
it,
and therefore from thence they
take their suspicions
;
I
shall,
in
this Place, to
remove every nicest Scruple they can have
touching this Affair, give the reader one
Instance
of Mr. Duncan Campbell hi
Instance of this kind likewise, before I pro
ceed with my History.
There liv'd, not many Years since, a very
aged Getlewoman in London, in Water-Lam
by Fleetjlreet, whose Name was Tight, who
was endowed with a Prophetick Spirit : And
the ingenious Dr. Beaumont (whom I perso
nally knew, and who had a Familiar Genius
himself) gives the World this Account of her.
She was very well known, fays he, to many
Persons of my Acquaintance, now living in
London : Among others, a gentleman, whose
Candour I can no way suspect, has told me,
that he often resorted to her, as to an Oracle ;
and that as soon as he came into her presence,
she would usually tell him, that she knew what
he was coming for, for that she had seen his
Spirit for some Time before : And without
his saying any Thing to her, she would com
monly tell him what the business was, which
he came to consult her about , and what the
Event of it would be ; which he always found
to fall out as /he said ; and many other Per
sons now living , can testify the like Experi
ence of her as to themselves.
Before I conclude this Chapter, I am wil
ling to give the Publick one farther little Hi
story of the like kind with the foregoing ones ;
with this only Difference, That if it be valued
according to the Worth the World has al
ways attributed to the very ingenious Person
whom it concerns,, it will be far the most fa
mous
ttfc The Life and Adventures
mous of them all, and therefore fittest to fi
nish this Chapter, and to crown this part of
the Work, in which we are showing that Al
sons have had a Perception of Genii or Spirits*
not visible at the fame time to others.
The famous Torquatw Tajso Prince of the
Italian Poets, and scarce inferior to the im
mortal Virgil himself, and who seems to en
joy the intermingled Gifts of the most ac
curate judgment of this Latin poet, and the
more fertile and copious Invention and Fancy
of the Greek pne, Homers strongly affected his
own experience in this kind. His Life was
written and published in French, Anno 1692,
by D. C. D. D. V. who, in his Preface tells
us, that, in what he writ, he has followed
chiefly the History given us in Italian by
John Baptifia Manso, a Neapolitan Gentle
man, who had been a very intimate Friend to
Tajso. In his Life, among other Things, he ac
quaints us, that Tajso was naturally ofthat me-
lancholick Temperament, which has always
made the greatest Men, and that this Tem
perament being aggravated by many Hard
ships he had undergone, it made him some
times beside himself, and that those melan-
cholick Vapours being dispatched, he came
again to himself, like those, that return from
Fits of the falling Sickness, his Spirit being
as free as before. That, near his latter end,
he retired from the City of Naples, td his
Friend Manso, at Bisaccia, a small Town in
the
of Mr. DuncanCa m p b ex l. i 1.3
the Kingdom of Naples, where Manfo had a
rconsiderableEstate, and passdan Autumn there
in the Diversions of the Season.
And here the French Author gives us an
account of Taffos sensible perception of a
Genius, as follows. As, after these Amuse
ments, he usually retir'd to his Chamber, to
entertain himself there with his Friend Manfo,
the latter had the Opportunity to enquire into
one of the most singular effects of Tajsos
Melancholy, (of this Heroick Melancholy, as
I may call
it)
which rais'd and brighten'd his
Spirit
j
so far
it
was from depressing, or ren-
dring
it
obscure
;
and which, among the An
cients, would have reasonably caus'd them
to have ascribed
a
Familiar Demon to him, as
to Socrates. They were often
in
a warm De
bate, concerning this Spirit, with which Taf-
Jo
pretended to have so free
a
Communicati
on. I'm too much your Friend, said Manfo
to him one Day, not to let you know what
the World thinks of you concerning this
Thing, and what
I
think of
it
my self.
Is
it
possible, that being enlighten'd as you are,
you should be fallen into
so
great
a
weakness,
as to think you have
a
Familiar Spirit
?
And
will you give your Enemies that Advantage,
to be able to prove by your own Acknowledg
ment, what they have already published to
the World
?
You know, they fay you did not
publish your Dialogue
of
the Messenger, as
a
FiBion
;
but you would have Men believe,
I
that
n4 The Life and Adventures
that the Spirit, which you make to speak
there, was a real and true Spirit : Hence Men
have drawn this injurious consequence, That
your Studies have embroil d your Imaginati
on ; so that there is made in it a confused
Mixture of the Fictions of the Poet s, the In
ventions of the Philosophers, and the Doctrine
s Religion.
I am not ignorant, answer 'd Tajso, of all
that is spread abroad in the World, on the
Account of my Dialogue : I have taken care
divers Times to disabuse my Friends, both
by Letter and Word of Mouth : I prevented
ev'n the Malignity of my Enemies, as you
know, at the Time I publisiYd my Dialogue.
Men could not be ignorant, that I composed
it for the young Prince of Mantua ; to whom
I would explain, after an agreeable manner,
the principal mysteries of the Platonick Phi
losophy. It was at Mantua it self, after my
Second Flight from Ferrara, that I form'd the
Idea of it ; and I committed it to Paper a lit
tle after my unfortunate Return. I addressed
it to this Prince ; and all Men might have
read in the Epistle Dedicatory, the Protestation
I there make, that this Dialogue being writ
t according to the doctrine of the Platonich,
which is not always conformable to reveal'd
Truths ; Men must not confound what I ex
pose there as a Philosopher, with what I be-
-
lievc as a Christian. This Distinction is by so
much the more reasonable, that at that Time;
:" nothing
Os Mr. DuNCi.NCAMPBELlr; gfjf
nothing extraordinary had-happen'd to me ;
and I {spake not of any Apparition. This can
be attested by all those with whom I lodged, or
whom Ifrequented in thisvoyage ; and there
fore there is no Reason for confounding the s
ction of my Dialogue, with what has happen'd
to me since. I am persuaded of all you say to
me, reply 'd Manso ; but truly I cannot be, of
what you believe, at present, concerning your
self. Will you imagine, that you are in Com-'
merce with a Spirit ? And Iask you, of what
Order is that spirit ? Shall we place him in
the number of the rebels, whom their Pride
precipitated into the Abyss / Or of the Intel
ligences, who continued firm in Faith, and
Submission to their Creator ? For there is no
Mean to take in the true Religion ; and we
muft not fall into the Extravagances of the
Gnomes and Sylphs of the Cahalijls.
Now the Spirit in question cannot be a
Damon. You own, that instead ofinspiring you
with any Thing contrary to Piety and Religion,
he often fortifies in you the Maxims of Chri
stianity ; lie strengthens your Faith by pro
found Reasonings, and has the fame Respect
with you for sacred Names and Things. Nei
ther can you rthat its an Angel ; for tho'
you have always led a regular Life, and far
from all Dissoluteness ; tho', for some Years
past, you have applyd. your self after a par
ticular manner to, the Duties of a true Chri
stian ; you will agree with me, that these Sorts
I a 4
ii5 The Life' sAdventures
of Favours are not common •
that a Man must
have attained to a high Degree of sanctity,
and not be far from the pureness of Cœlestial
Spirits, to merit a familiar Converse, and bear
a harmony with them. Believe me, there
is nothing in all these Discourses, which you
imagine you have with this Spirit. You know,
better than any Man, those Symptoms, which
the black Humours, wherewith you are tor
mented, causes in'yotu Your Vapours are
the Source of your Visions,* and your (elf would
not judge otherwise of another Person , ta
whom a like Thing should happen : And you
will come to this in your own Respect also,
if you will make a mature reflection, and
apply your self to blot out, by an Effort of
Reason, these Imaginations, which the Vio
lence of your evil Effects causes in you.' You
may have Reason, reply 'd Taffo, to think so
of the Things that pass in me ; but as to my
self, who have a sensible Perception of them,
I am forced to reason after another manner.
If it were true, that the Spirit did not Ihew
himself" to me, but in the violent Ailault of
my Vapours ; if he' offer'd to my Imagina
tion, but wandering and confused Species,
without connection or due Sequel ; if he us'd
to me frivolous Reasonings, which ended in
nothing ; or
if,
having begun some solid Rea
soning, he broke
it
off" on
a
sudden, and left
me
in
Darkness
;
I
should believe with you,
^at
all things that paft, are but mere Dreams
^- - - and
of Mr* Dunc a-n Ca mpbell i 17 .
and Phantoms. But it's quite otherwise. :
This Spirit is a Spirit of Truth and Reason ;
and of a Truth so distinct, of a Reason so ,
sublime, that he raises me often to Know- ,
ledges that are above all my Reasonings, tho'
they appear to me no less clear ; That he
teaches me Things, which, in my most pro
found meditations, never came into my Spi
rit, and which I never heard of any Man,
nor read in any Book. This Spirit therefore
is somewhat of real ; of whatsoever Order he
be, I hear him and see him, nevertheless for
its being impossible for me to comprehend
and define him. Manso did not yield to these
facts , which Tajso would have pasi'd for
Proofs : He press 'd him with new questions,
which were not without Answers. Since you.
will not believe me on my Word, said y"
to him, another Day, after having well dis
puted, I must convince you by your own
Eyes, that these Things are not pure Imagi
nations. And the next Day conversing toge
ther in the same Chamber, Manso perceiv'd,
that on a sudden he fix'd his Eyes towards
the Window, and that he stood , as it were,
immovable ; he called to him, and jogg'd him*
many times : But instead of answering him ;
See there the Spirit, fays Tajso at last, that
has been pleased to come and visit me, and to
entertain himself with me J Look on him, and
you will acknowledge the Truth of what Isa/.

led with the Ideas of this extraordinary En

d
himself not to speak

it
were

it

and that

Dr. Beaumont, who
is
still living, and with
whom
I
have had formerly some Acquaint
ance my self, has set down, among others,
this Relation at large concerning Tajjso
j
and
gives this Reason tor
it
:
Because, fays the
Doctor,
I
think
it
contains a sufficient answer
to what many Learned Friends have said to

my self on the like occasion.
Perhaps
it
may not be ungrateful to the
Reader,
if
I
subjoin here the short FXogium
writ on lasso,
by
the famous Thuanus
;
which
is
as follows'.
Torquatus Taslb died about the Forty fifth
■
Year
of
his Age
;
a
Man
of
a
wonderful and
,
prodigious Wit, who was seized with an inett'
table Fury in bis Tonth, when he lived at the
I
4
Court
no The Life and Adyentures
Court o/Ferrara, and nevertheless, in lucid-
Intervals, he writ many Things, both in Verse
and Prose, with so much Judgment, Elegancy,
and extreme CorreBness of Stile, that he turn'd
at length that Pity, which many Men had con
ceived for him, into an Ama&ement ; while by
that Fury, which, in others, makes [their Minds
outrageous, or dulls them, after it was over, his \
Under(landing became as it were more purified,
more ready in inventing Things, more.'.acute in
aptly disposing them aster theywere'invented,and
more copious in adorning them with cJooiceWprds
andWeight ofSentences ; and that which a Man
of the soundest Sense would scarce excogitate
at his Leffwe,with thegreatest Labour and Care
imaginable, he, aster a violent Agitation of
the Mind set beside it self, naturally perform d
with a wonderfid Facility , so that heylid not,
seem.ftruck with an Alienation of Mind, but
with a divine Fury. He that knows not these-
Things, which all Men know that have been in
Italy, and concerning which himselfsometimes
complains, the modeflly, in his Writings J let
him read his Dlv'meWorks, and he muft necessa
rily conclude, either that /speak ofanother Man

4 Narrative of Mr. Campbell' j coming to,
! London, and taking upon him the Profejfion
t of a Prediclor j together with an Account
c of many strange things that came to pass
just as he foretold.
TO,proceed on regularly with the Life
of young Duncan Campbell, I must let
the Reader know that he continued thus con
versing with his little genius, as is set forth
above in the Dialogue he had with me, and
predicting many things of the like nature,
as I have described, till the Year 1694, when
he was just fourteen Years of Age, and then
he left Scotland. «. -.^
r
.
But before I come to speak of the manner
of his departure from thence, his half native
Country, inasmuch as his Father was of that
Country, and he had his Education there,
(what education he could have, being Deaf
and Dumb) I must let the reader know that
in the Year 1692, my very good Friend Mrs.
Campbel^ his Mother-in-Law, died, and left
him
os Mr. Duncan Ca mpbeiE :iij
him there at Edinburgh, ah Orphan of
Twelve Years of Age.
'
-■'■
' He was, I may venture to fay, the most
beautiful Boy of his Age I ever knew ; and
the sensible reader, who considers a Child of
good Birth, with the Misfortunes of being
Deaf and Dumb, left fatherless and Mother
less in- the wide World, at Twelve Years Old,
without any Competency for his Mainte
nance and Support, without any Relations,
in a manner that knew him or assisted him,
all the little Fortune his Father had, having
been lost in the civil Commotions in Scotland,
as I have related above, need not hear me
describe the Compassion, I and many more,
had for him ; because such a Reader must
certainly feel in his own Bosom the fame
lively acts of Pity and Commiseration, at
the hearing of such a Mishap, as I had at the
seeing
it,
or at least as
I
have now reviv'd
afresh within me at the relating it.
However,
it
came
so
to pass, that
a
Person
of the Name of Campbell, and who was
a
di
stant Relation of the Boy, though he himself
was but in different Circumstances, was re-
solved to see him provided for one way or ano
ther, in
a
manner somewhat suitable to his
Condition, and till that Time to;take the best
care of him himself, that he was able.
Several Ladies of Quality, who had known
his Perfections, coveted to make the Boy one
"if their Domesticks* -as -a Page, or Playj-
rJ fellow
*«.tf TkehifE and ADVEtfTijRiEs
fellow to their Children jsor, though he could
not speak, he had such a vivacity in all his
actions such a Sprightliness of Behaviour,
and such a, Merriment- accompanying all his
Gestures* that he afforded more EntertainT
ment, than the prettiest and wittiest little
prattlers at those Years are wont to do. Mr.
Campbell had certainly accepted of some of
these fortunate Offers for his little cousin,
which were many of them likely to prove
very Advantageous, if it had not been put
in his Head by some friends particularly
my self, that if he had a mind to dispose of
the Boy in that manner, the best way he
could take, would be, to present him to the
late Earl ol'Argyll, who for his Name's Sake,
and for his Father's Sake, as well as the Qua
lifications and endowments of the Boy,
would more naturally (according to all Pro
bability) take a greater Pleasure and Delight
in him, and consequently provide better for
him, and with a more lasting Care, than
any other Person of Quality, that had a
sudden liking to him , which might change,
and took him as a stranger out of a bare Cu
riosity. Mr- Campbell was by these Reasons
over-rul'd in the disposal of his little Dumb
Prophetical Cousin, as he call'd him, and re-
solv d that an offer should be made of him
to the present illustrious Duke of Argyll's most
noble Father. But it so unfortunately hapr
pened, that the Earl making very much $
longer
of Mr. Duncan Ca mpbe %.p .117
longer stay at London than was expected,
Mr. Campbell, the Uncle, sent our young Dun
can Campbell, his Nephew, hanasomely ac-
couter'd, and with a handsome. Sum of Mo
ney in his Pocket, by sea, with Captain
Meek of Kircaldie to London, with Letters
of Recommendation to the Earl's Favour ;
and just a. few days before young Duncan
arrived in London, the Earl was f?t out on
hit Journey to his Seat in Scotland.
I had now left him a near Three Years,
not having seen him since about a Year after
his Mother's Death ; and then coming to Lon
don, I had by mere Accident an Appointment
to meet some Scots Gentlemen at the Buffalo's
Head Tavern
gThere happen kl
at that Time to be a great Concourse of Scots
Nobility there at an Entertainment, and one
of the Ladies and Gentlemen passing by and
seeing one of my Friends, desired him to come
in, and told him both he and his Compani
ons should be very welcome to partake of the
Diversion. The Lady told him they had got
a lovely Youth, a Scots Miracle among them,
that would give us exquisite Delight, and
write down to us all the Occurrences of our
future Lives, and tell us our Names upon our
first Appearance. The Moment I heard of
it,
Duncan Campbell came into my Head
;
but
as
it
is
a
thing not rare to be met with
in
Scotland, for second-sighted Persons to tell
such Things, and as the Earl of Argyll was
1
in
'
1 18 The Life and A d v entures
' in the North, I thought little Duncan' s
been under his' protection, and with him, and
"did not dream of meeting with him there,
and accordingly told my Friend, before I
went in, that I believed I knew a Lad in
Scotland would exceed this in Foresight, let
-
him be as dextrous in his Art as he would-
'
As soon as I enter'd the Room, I was fur-
priz'd to find my self encompass'd and fur-
rounded by a circle of the most beautiful Fe
males that ever my Eyes beheld. In the Centre
of this Angelick Tribe was seated a heavenly
Youth, with the most winning comeliness of
Aspect, that ever pleased the sight of any Be
holder of either Sex ; his Face was divinely
Fair, and ting'd only with such a sprightly
Blush, as a Painter would use to Colour the
Picture of Health with, and the Complexion
was varniih'd over by a Blooming, like that
of flourishing Fruit, which had not yet felt the
first Nippings of an unkind and an uncivil Air ;
with this beauty was join'd such a smiling
Draught of all the Features, as is the result
of pleasantry and good Humour. His Eyes
were large, full of Lustre, Majestick, well
set, and the Soul lone so in them, as told
the spectators plainly, how great was the in
ward Vivacity of his Genius : The Hair of
his Head was thick and reclin'd far below
his Shoulders ; it was of a fine Silver Colour,
and hung down in Ringlets like the curling
Tendrils of a copious Vine. He was by the
Women
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. 1x9
Women entertain'd, according to the Claim,
which so many perfections joining in a Youth
just ripening into Manhood, might lay to the
benevolent Dispositions of the tender Sex.
One was holding the baton of Water, ano
ther Wafting a Hand, a Third with a Towel
drying his Face, which another Fair had gree
dily snatched the Pleasure of warning before,
while a Fourth was disposing into order his
Silver Hairs with an Ivory Comb, in an Hand
as White, "and which a Monarch might have
been proud to have had so employ 'd in adjust
ing the Crown upon his Head ; a Fifth was
setting into order his Cravat 5 a Sixth stole a
kiss, and blusti'd at the innocent pleasure,
and mistook her own Thoughts as if(he kifs'd
the Angel and not the Man ; and they all ra
ther seemed to adore than to love him, as if
they had taken him not for a Person that en
joy'd the frequent Gift of the second sight,
but as if he had been some little Prophet pe
culiarly inspired ; and while they all thus ad-
mir'd and wonder'd, they all consulted him as
an Oracle. The Surprize of seeing a young
Man so happy amidst the general concurring
Favours of the Fair, made me be for a while
lost in a kind of delightful Amazement, and
the Consideration of what Bliss he was re
sesled, made me scarce believe my own Eyes,
when they told me it was Duncan Campbell,
who I had left an unhappy Orphan at Edin
burgh. But so it was, though he was much
K altered
i^o The Life and Adventures
altered in Stature, being now shot up pretty
fast in his Growth since I had seen him, and
having gain'd a kind of a fix'd Comportment i
such as we may daily observe in those, who
are taking leave of their Minority, and step
ping into a Stage of maturer Life.
The first remarkable Thing I knew him do
in London, being in this splendid Company,
where there were so many undoubted Wit-
rtesles of quality too, that had Ocular Proof
of his predictions, was at that tavern : I
chuse to Record it here, according to its due
order. It was in the Year 1698.
Among this Angelical Class, of Beauties,
were Dr. Wind's Lady and Daughter.
Upon Earth there was not sure a more beau
tiful Creature than the Daughter ; flie was
the Leading Light of all the sparkling Tribe s
and Otrcays Character suits her exactly ; for
flie was, "~;
Among Ten Thousand, eminently Fair.
One would imagine prosperous and lucky
Fortune was written upon her Face,and thatnc-
tiiing unhappy could be read in Ib fair a Book ;
and it was therefore the unanimous Consent
of all, that, by way of good Omen to the
rest, his predictions should begin to be open'd
luckily that Day, and that therefore he should
first of all be consulted about her.

her questions as to her future Fortune. He
gaz'd afreÆi at her : very eagerly for some
time, and, his Countenance during that time
of viewing her seem'd to be ruffled with abun

all imagined that the youth was. .a little
touched at the Heart himself with what he
saw, and that instead of 'telling hers,- he had
met in her[Bright Eyes with his own Destiny,
the Destiny of being for ever made a Slave
and a Captive, to ib many powerful and al
most irresistible Charms.
At length, after having a long Debate
within himself, which we thought proceed
ed from the Smugglings of Love and Passion,
he fetching a great Sigh, which still con
vinced us more, took the Pen and wrote to
Mrs. W-lw-dj that he begg d to be excus'd,
and that his Pen might remain as Dumb
and Silent as his Tongue, on that Affair.
By this Answer we concluded one and all,
K <z that
ijx The Life WAdventures
that our former conjectures were true, and
we" joiri'd in pressing him the more earnestly
to deliver his real and sincere opinion con
cerning the Accidents upon which the future
Fortunes of her Life were to turn and de
pend. He fhew'd many mighty Reluctances
in the doing it ; and I have often since con
sidered him in the fame Anguifli as the late
great Dr. Radcliffe, who was endeavouring by
Study to save a certain Fair One, whom he
loved with a vehemence of temper, and who
was (as his Reason told him) got far away
beyond the reach of the Art of Physick to
recover. At last he wrote in plain Terms,

were likely to happen, be able by timely

complied with very great Difficulty, and blot
ting the Paper with Tears that trickled fast
from his Eyes, he gave her the lamentable
Scroll, containing the Words that follow, viz.
I wish it had not fallen to my Lot to tell this
Lady, whom every Body, that but once looks
at her, must admire, though they must not
have leave to love, that she is not much
longer to be Possessor of that lovely Face,
which gains her such a number of Adorers.
The Small Pox will too soon turn a Ravistier,
and rifle all those Sweets and Charms that
might be able to vanquish a King, and to
subdue a Conqueror of mighty Battels.
Her reign is doom'd alas to be as short as
it is now Great and Universal ! I believe she
has internal Beauties of the Mind, not the
least inferior to those external Excellencies of
the Body, and she might perhaps by the
Power of her Mind alone, be absolute Queen
of the affections of Men, if the Small Pox
threaten'd not too surely to be her farther
Enemy ; and, not contented to destroy the
Face, was not perverfly bent to destroy the
whole Woman. But I want Words to ex

Mother,
136 The Life and Adventures
Mother, nor the Skill and Wisdom of the
great Physician her Father, were sufficient
to ward off" the approaching Harm, that was
written in the Books of Fate. Not many
Suns had finished their yearly Courses before
she was forc'd to submit to the inevitable
Stroke of Death, after the infectious and ma
licious Malady had first ravag'd her Beauty,
rioted in all her Sweets, and made an odious
deform'd Spectacle of the Charmer of Man
kind. The predicted Fate of the Daughter
work'd so hard upon the Mother's Bowels,
that it dragged her first, with a broken Heart
to the Grave.
This Lady, whose Fortune so great and so
distinguished an Afiembly had chosen to hear
as a happy Forerunner and lucky Omen of
all their own, which were to be ask'd after
wards in their Turns, proving so contrary to
their Expectations already unfortunate in the
prediction, and having been in Tears about
the Matter, difhearten'd all the rest of the
Beauties from consulting him farther that
Day. The Person, who kept the tavern,
by Name Mrs. Irvin, alledg'd that as some
People were very fortunate, and others un
fortunate upon the fame Day ; so one Lady
might be before told a Milhap one Mi
nute, and another Lady all the Prosperity in
Nature the very next Minute following ; and
therefore that what the unfortunate Lady had
heard was not to be taken as Ominous, or
as
of Mr. Duncan Campbell i.37
as what could malignantly influence the day,
neither ought it to be the least hindrance to
any who had the curiosity of being let into
the Secrets of Time before-hand. However,
whether the Ladies were convine'd or no ;
if she prevail'd over theirjgelief in that point,
she could not prevail over their Humour,
which
ever
though they might not believe the
former prediction ominous to themselves)
was naturally aw'd for fear of the like, per-
adventure, for
a
Time
*,
and
so
it
was agreed,
nemine Contradicente, as
a
witty Lady wrote
it
down, that no more Petitions mould for
that Day be presented by any of that Com
pany to his Dumb, yet oracular, Majesty.
Mrs.. Irwin, however, would have her way
;
(aid, she did not presume to siich Honour as
to call her self of that Company, and that
therefore she might consult him without
breaking through the Votes of the Assembly.
Many endeavour'd to dissuade her, but as the
was passionately fond of knowing future E-
vents
;
and had
a
mighty Itch to be very in
quisitive with the Oracle, about what might
happen, not only to herself, but her Posterity
;
it
was agreed that he should have the liberty
of satisfying her curiosity, since the presumed
her Fortune was sore to be
so
Good, and
was
so
forward and eager for the knowledge
of it. But (alas!) such
is
too often the
fantastical Impulse of Nature unluckily de

it

knowing, that when known we would be
glad to unknow again, and then our Memo
ry will not let us1 be untaught.
Mrs. Irwin was at that time in a pretty
commodious way of Business, every Thing in
Plenty round about her, and liv'd more like
a Person of Distinction, that kept such a Cel
lar of Wine, open House, and a free Table,
than like one who kept a Tavern. She
brought in her three pretty Children, that
Were then almost Babies, the youngest having
not long been out of the Nurse's Arms, or
trusted to the use pf its own Legs. These
Children she lov'd as a Mother should love
Children % they were the Delight of her Eyes
all Day, and the Dream of hef Imagination
all Night. All the Passions Of her Soul were
confin'd to them ; (he was never pleas d but
when they were so, and always angry if they
were cross'd j her whole Pride was center'd
in them, and they were cloath'd and went
attended more like the Infants of a Princess,
than of a Vintners Relict. The Fortune of
these was what slie had near at Heart, and of
which she was so eager of being immediately
apprized. Her Impatience was proportiona
ble to the Love slie had for them, and which
made her wish to foreknow all the Happiness
that was like to attend them. She fate chear-
fttlly down, presented one to him, and smi
ling, wrote the Question in general Terms,
viz. -Is this Boy to be Happy or Unhappy?

A
os Mr. Dun c A n Campmll 139
A melancholy Look once more spread it self
all over the face of the predictor, when he
read the too inquisitive Words ; and he seemed
mightily to regret being ask'd a question, to
which he was; by his talent ©f Foreseeing,
compell'd to give so unwelcome an Answer.
The Colour of the poor Woman flufh'd and
vanisti'd alternately, and very quick ; and (he
lookid not quite like the picture of despair,
but a disconsolate Woman, with little Hopes
on one hand, and great Doubts and disinal
Fears on the other. She professed, she read
great Evil in the Troubles of his face ; thank'd
him for his good nature ; told him, that they
all knew, that tho' he could foretel, he could
not alter the Acts and Decretals of Fate ; and
therefore desired him to tell her the worst 5 for
that the Misfortunes, were they never so
great, would be less dreadful to her, than re
maining in the State of Fear and Suspension.
He at last wrote down to her, that great and
unexpected, and even unavoidable Accidents,
would involve the whole Family in new Ca
lamities j that the Son she ask'd him about,
would have the bitterest task of Hardship
to go thro' withal, while he lived ; and that
to finish all more unhappily, he would be
safely and maliciously brought to an untimely
End , by some mortal Enemy or other ; but
that me should not trouble herself so much
on that Head, they would never see
it,
for
it
would happen some Years after she was de

parted from the World. This melancholy Ac:
count clos'd up the Book of Predictions for
that Day, and put a fad Stop to all the pro
jected Mirth and Curiosity. Now I must tell
the Reader, how and when the Event an-
swer'd the prediction : And in a few Words,
it was thus : Poor Mrs. Irwin^ by strange Ac
cidents decay'd in the World, and dying Poor,
her Sons were forc'd to be put out Apprenti
ces to small Trades j and the Son, whom the
abovemention'd Prediction concern 'd, was,
for stealing one Cheese from a Man in the
Hay-Market, severely prosecuted at the Old-
Baily ,• and on Wednesday, the Twenty-third
of p.ecettiber 1713, hang'd at Tyburn with se
veral other Criminals.
The Two foregoing Paslages are of so Tra
gical a Nature, that it is Time I should re
lieve the Minds of my Readers, with some
Histories of Ladies, who consulted him with
more success and Advantage ; to whom his
predictions were very entertaining, when they
so came to pass in their Favour ; the Relation
whereof will consequently be agreeable to all
Readers, who have within them a Mixture of
happy Curiosity, and good Nature.
Two Ladies, who were the most remark
able Beauties in London, and the most courted,
turn 'd at the fame Time their Thoughts to
Matrimony ; and being satiated, I may say
wearied, with the Pleasure of having conti
nually after them a great Number and Variety
of
ofMr. Duncan Campbell! 14'i'
of adorers, resolv'd each, about the fame
time, to make choice of their several Men,
to whom they thought they could give most
Happiness, and from whom they might re
ceive most. Their Names (for they are both
Persons of Distinction) shall be Phri/tal/ina,
and Urbana. Chrijlallina was a Virgin, and
Urbana a young widow. Chrijiallina engross'd
the Eyes, the Hearts,' and the Sighs of the
whole Court, and whereeverfhe appear'd, put
any Court-Lady out of her Place, that had
one before in the Heart of any Youth j and
was the celebrated Toast among the Beau
Monde. Urbana s Beauty made as terrible Ha-
vock in the City : All the Citizens Daugh
ters, that had many Admirers, and were in
fair hopes of having Husbands, when they
pleased themselves ; as soon as Urbana had lost
her old Husband, found that they every Day
lost their Lovers ; and 'twas k general Fear
among the prettiest Maids, that they should
remain Maids still, as long as Urbana remain'd
a Widow. She was the Monopolizer of City
affection ; and made many Girls, that had
large Stocks ofSuiters, Bankrupts in the Trade
of Courtship, and broke some of their Hearts,
when her Charms broke offtheir Amours. —
Well ; but the Day was near at Hand, when
both the Belles of the Court, and the City
Damsels, were to be freed from the Ravages,
which these Two Tyrants, triumphant in
Beauty, and insolent in Charms, made among
the
i^z The Life and Adventures
the Harvest of Love. Each had seen her
proper man, to whom the Enjoyment of her
Person was to be dedicated for Life : But, it
being an affair of so lasting Importance, each
had a Mind' s be let into the Knowledge
of the Consequences of such a Choice, as far
as possible, before they stepped into the irre
vocable State of Matrimony. Both of them
happened to take it into their Heads, that the
best way to be entirely satisfied in their Curi
osity, was to have Recourse to the great Me
dictor of. future occurrences, Mr. Duncan
Campbeflywhofe Fame was at that Time spread
pretty largely about the Town. Chriftallina
and Urbana were not acquainted with each
other, only, by the Report which Fame had
made of Beauty. They came to Mr. Camp
bell's on the fame Day, and both with the
lame Resolution of keeping themselves; cqa-j
Pol and under masks, that none of ac
company of Consulted who.^append to be
there, might know who they were, I
It hap^
pen'd that on that very day, just when they,
came, Mr. Campbell's Rooms Were more than
ordinarily crowded with curious Clients of
the Fair Sex ; so that he was oblig'd to desire
these two Ladies, who expressed so much
Precaution against, and Fear of having their
Persons discoverd, to be contented with only
one Room between them ; and with much
ado, they comply 'd with the Request, and
condescended to sit together Incog. Distant

Compliments of Gesture pass'd between them,
(the Dress and comportment of each making
them appear to be Persons of Figure and Breed

sies, down they fat, without so much as once;
opening their Lips, or intending so to do. The
Silence between them was very, formal and
profound, for near Half anHour ,• and nothing
was to be heard but the snapping of Fans,
which they both did very tuneably, and with
great Harmony, and play'd (as it were ) in

Just
144 The Life and AdventuA.es
Just by that Time they had had their Chat
out, and wifh'd one another the Pleasure of
a successful Prediction, it came to ChristaU'tnds
Turn to visit the Dumb Gentleman, and re
ceive from his Pen Oracular Answers, to all
the Questions she had to propose. Well ; he
accordingly satisfy 'd her in every Point she
ask'd him : But while she was about this,
one of Mr. Campbell's Family going with Ur
bana, to divert her a little ; the Widow rail'd
at the Virgin as a Fool, to imagine that she
should ever make a Conquest of the bright
est Spark about the Court ; and then let fly
some random Bolts of Malice, to wound her
Reputation for Chastity. Now it became the
Widow's Turn, to go and consult : And the
seme Person of Mr. Campbells Family, in the
mean Time entertain'd Christ allina. The
Maid was not behind-hand with the Widow :
She rail'd against the Widow ; represented her
as sometimes a Coquet, sometimes a Lady
of Pleasure, sometimes a Jilt ; and lifted up
her Hands in Wonder and Amazement, that
Urbana should imagine so Rich a Man, as
Alderman such a one should fall to her Lot.
Thus Urbana swore and protested, that Chri-
stallina could never arrive at the Honour of
being the Wife to the Courtly Secretarius, let
Mr. Campbell flatter her as he would : And
Christallhia vow'd, that Campbell must be a
downright Wizard, if he foretold, that such
a one as Urbana would get Alderman Stiff-

rump for a husband, provided a Thing so im
probable should come to pass.
However, it seems, Duncan had told them
their own names, and the Names of their
Suiters ; and told them farther, how soon
they were both to be married, and that too,
directly to their Hearts Content ; as they said
rejoicingly to themselves * and made their
mutual Gratulations.
They went away, each satisfied that she
should have her own Lover ; but ChristaUina
Jaugh'd at Mr. Campbell, for assigning the Al
derman to Urbana ; and Urbana laugh d at
him, for promising the Courtier to the Arms
of Christallina.
This is a pretty good Figure of the Tern-'
pers of Twb feigning Toasts, with regard to
one another.
First, Their Curiosity made them j from
resolving to be concealed, discover one ano
ther wilfully ; from utter strangers grow as
familiar as old Friends in a Moment ; swear*
one another to Secrecy, and exchange the
Sentiments of their Hearts together, and from
being Friends, become envious of each other's
enjoying a Similitude of Happiness, The
Compliments made on either Side, Face to
Fice, were, upon the turning of the Back,
turn'd into reflections, Detraction and Ridi
cule : Each was a Self-Lover, and admirer
of her own Beauty and Merit i and a Despi-
fer of the other's.

\^6 The Life ^-/Adventures
However , Duncan Campbell prov'd at left
to be in the right : Urbana was wrong in her
Opinion of Chrijlallinds want of Power over
Secretarhu ; and Chri/lallina was as much out
in her Opinion, that Urbana would miss in
her Aim of obtaining Stiffrttmp : For they
both prov'd in the right of what they thought,
with regard to their own dear single Persons,
and were made happy according to their Ex
pectations, just at the time foretold by Mr.
Campbell.
Chrijlallinas ill Wishes did not hinder Ur
bana from being Mistress- of Alderman Stiff-
rumps Persons and Stock ; nor did Urbana's
hinder Chriflatiina from mewing her self a
mining Bride at the Ring, in Secretarhiss gild

proud Belgian Kind, with her Half Dozen of
liveries, with Favours in their Hats, waiting
her Return at the Gate of Hide-Park.
Both lov'd, and both envy'd ; but both al-
lOw'd of Mr. Campbell's Foreknowledge.
Having told you Two very sorrowful Pas
sages, and one tolerably successful and enter
taining ; I shall now relate to you another of
my own Knowledge, that is mixed up with
the Grievous and the pleasant, and chequerd,
as it were, with the Shade and the Sunshine
of Fortune.
'Though there are Vicissitudes in every

of Prosperity ; yet those conditions, which
are the most liable to the signal alterations of
Fortune, are the Conditions of Merchants :
For profese'd Gamesters I reckon, in a man
ner, as men of no Condition of Life at all, but
what comes under the Statute of Vagabonds.
It was indeed, as the Reader would guess*
a worthy and a wealthy merchant, who was
to run thro1 these different Circumstances of
Being : He came and visited our Mr. Camp'
s, in the Year 1707 : He found him amidst
a Crowd of Consulters ?and being very ea-<
ger and solicitous to know his own Fortune*
just at that criticaljuncture ofTime, hebegg'd
of him, if possible, to adjournltisother Clients
to the Day following, and sacrifice that one
wholly to his Life ; which, as it was probably
more important than all the others together,
so he wrote down, that he' would render the
Time spent about it more advantageous to
Mr. Campbell ; and, by "way of previous En
couragement, threw him down Ten Guineas,*
as a retaining Fee.

" Requests, adjourn his other clients to the

" Mind to be made a Master,
. There is certainly a very keen Appetite in
Curiosity ; it cannot stay for Satisfaction ; it
is pressing for its necessary Repast, and is with
out all Patience. Hunger and Thirst are not
Appetites more vehement, and more hard and
difficult to be repreft'd, than that of Curiosi
ty : Nothing but the present NOW is able to
allay it. A more expressive picture of this I
never beheld, than in the Faces of some, and
the Murmurs and Complaints of others, in
that little inquisitive Company, when the
unwelcome Note was given about, signifying
an Adjournment for only Twenty four Hours.
The Colour of a young Woman there came
and went a Hundred times (if possible in the
Space of two Minutes : She blufh'd like a
red Rose this Moment ; and in the Switch of
an Eyelash, me was all over as pale as a white
one. The Suiter, whose Name her Heart

jest) that the Day following would be a more
lucky day to consult about Husbands , than
the present that she came on. The Answer
was a kind of Cordial to her Hopes, and
brought her a little better to her self.
Two others, I remember, Sisters and old
Maids, that it seems were Misers, Women
ordinarily dresi'd, and in blue Aprons, and yet
("by Relation) worth no less than Two Thou
sand Pounds each, were in a Peck of Troubles
about his going and leaving them unsatisfied.
They came upon an Enquiry after goods that
were stolen j and they complained, that by
next morning, at that Time, the Thief might
be got far enough off," and creep into so re
mote a Corner, that he would put it beyond
the Power of the Devil, and the Art of Con
juration to find him out, and bring him back
again. The Disturbance and Anxiety that
was to be seen in their Countenances, was
just like that which is to be beheld in the
Face of a losing Gamester, when hfs All, his
last great Stake lies upon the Table, and is
just sweeping off by another winning Hand,
into his own Hat.
The next was a Widow j who bounc'd, be
cause, as she pretended, he would not tell
her what was best to do with her Sons ; and
what profession it would be most happy for
them to be put to : But in Reality, all the
Cause of the Widow's fuming and fretting,
was, not that she wanted to provide for her
L 3 sons
150 The Life and Adv entures
Sons, but for her self : She wanted a Second
Husband ; and was not half so solicitous about
being put in a way of Educating those Chil-r
dren flie had already, as of knowing when
she should be in a Likelihood of getting more.
This was certainly in her Thoughts ; or else
Hi£ would never have flouncd about in her
Weed from one End of the Room to the
other, and all the while of her passion, smile
by Fits upon the Merchant, and leer upon a
young pretty Irijh Fellow that was there.
The young Irishman made use of a little Eye-
Language : She grew appeas'd ; went away in
quite a good Humour ; skuttlcd too airily down
Stairs, for a Woman in her Cloaths ; and the
Reason was certainly, that (he knew the Mat
ter before, which we took notice of presently-
after. The Irishman went precipitately after
her down Stairs, without taking his Leave.
But neither were the Two Misers for their
Gold, the Virgin for a first Husband, nor the
Widow for a Second, half so eager, as ano
ther married Woman there was for the Death
of her Spouse. She had put the question in
so expecting a manner for a lucky Answer,
and with so much keen Desire appearing plain
ly in her Looks , that no big-belly'd Woman
was ever more, eager for devouring Fruit ;
no young hasty Bridegroom, just married to
a beauty, more impatient for Night and En
joyment, than (he was to. know, what she
thought a mere happy moment, the Moment
os Mr. Duncan Campb ell 15-1
of her husband's last agonizing Gasp. As her
expectation was the greatest, so was her Dis
appointment too, and consequently her Dis
order upon his going and leaving her unre-
solv'd. She was frantick, raging and impla
cable : She was in such a Fury at the Delay of
putting off her Answer to the Day following,
that in her fury she acted as if she would have
given her self an Answer, which of the Two
should die first, by choaking her self upon the
Spot, with the Indignation that swelfd in her
Stomach, and rese into her Throat on that Oc
casion. It may look like a Romance to lay it ;
but indeed they were forc'd to cut her Lace ;
and then she threw out of the Room with
great Passion—But yet had so much of the
enraged Wife left, ( beyond the enrag'd Wo
man) as to return instantly up Stairs, and
signify very calmly, she would be certain to
be there next Day ; and beseech'd earnestly,
that they might not meet with a Second Dis
appointment.
All this Hurry and Bustle created a Stay, a
little too tedious for the Merchant ; who be
gan to be impatient himself, especially when
Word was brought up, that a fresh Company
was come in : But Mr. Campbell was deny'd
to them ; and to put a Stop to any more In
terruptions, the Merchant and the Dumb
Gentleman agreed to flip into a Coach, drive
to a Tavern in the City, and settle Matters of
Futurity over a Bottle of French Claret.
L 4 The
rx$i The Life and Adventures
The first Thing done at the Tavern, was;
Mr/ Campbell's saluting him upon a Piece of
Paper by his Name, and drinking his Health.
The next Paper held a Discourse of Condo-
lance, for a Disaster that was past long since ;
namely, a great and considerable Loss that hap
pens to his Family, in the dreadful Conga
gration of the City of London. In the Third
Little Dialogue which they had together, he
told the Merchant, that Lodes and Advan
tages were general Topicks, which a Person
unskill'd in that Art might venture to assign
to any Man of his profession ; it being next to
impossible, that Persons who traflick. should
not sometimes gain , and sometimes lose. —
But, said Mr. Duncan Campbell, I will sketch
out particularly, and specify to you some fu
ture Misfortunes, with which you will una
voidably meet : 'Tis in your Stars ; it is in
Destiny, that you should have some Trials ;
and therefore when you are forewarn'd, take
a prudent Care to be forearm 'd with Patience j
and by Longanimity, and meekly and resign
edly enduring your Lot, render it more easy,
since Impatience can't avert
it,
and will only
render
it
more burthensome and heavy. He
gave these Words to the Merchant
;
who
press
d
for his Opinion that Moment. By
your Leave, ("resuming the Pen, said the Dumb
Gentleman in writing we will have this
Bottle out first, and tap
a
fresh one, that you
may be warm'd with Courage enough to re^

<

of Mr. Duncan Campbell "*n
ceive the first speculative Onset of ill Fortune,
that I shall predict to you, with a good Grace ;
and that may perhaps enable you to meet
it,
when
it
comes to reduce
it
self into action,
with a
manful Purpose, and all-becoming Re-
solution. The Merchant agreed to the Pro
posal, and put on an Air of the careless and
in
different as well as he could
;
to signify, that he
had no need to raise up an artificial Courage
from the auxiliary Forces of the Grape. But
Nature, when hard pressed, will break thro' all
Disguises
;
and not only, notwithstanding the
Air of pleasantry he gave himself, which ap-
pear'd forc'd and constraint, but in Spite of
two or three sparkling and enlivening Bum
pers,
a
Cloud of Care would ever and anon
gather and shoot heavily cross his Brow, tho'
he labour'd all he could to dispel
it
as quick
ly
,
and to keep fair Weather in his Counte
nance. Well
j
they had crack'd the first Bot
tle, and the Second succeeded upon the Table,
and they call'd to blow
a
Pipe together. This
Pipe Mr. Campbell found had
a
very
ill
effect
:

It
is
certainly
a
pensive kind ofinstrument, and
fills

so
disposed, with disturb
ing Thoughts, black Fumes, and melancholy
Vapours, as certainly as
it
doth the Mouth
with Smoke. It plainly took away even the lit

given before
;
so
he wrote for
a
Truce of Fi
ring those Sort of noxious Guns any longer
;
and they laid down their Arms
by
Consent, and
drank
if4 The Ljp£ and Adventures
drank off" the Second Bottle. A Third im
mediately supply'd its Place ; and at the first
Glass of the opening of the Bottle, Mr. Camp
bell began to open to him his future Cafe, in the
following Words :
*
Sir, You have now some
*■
Ventures at Sea, from such and such a Place,
*
to such a Value : Don't be discomforted at the
News which you certainly will have within
three Months, (but 'twill be false at last) that
they are by three differentTempests madethe
Prey of the great Ocean, and enrich the Bot
tom ofthe Sea, the Palace ofNeptwie. A worse
Storm than all these attends you at home ; a
Wife who is,and will be more the Tempest of
the House wherein (he lives. The high and
lofty Winds of her Vanity, will blow down
the Pillars of your House and Family ; the
High-tide of her Extravagance, will roll on
like a resistless Torrent, and leave you at low
Water, and the Ebb of all your Fortunes.
This is the highest,and the most cutting Di
saster that is to befal you. Your real Ship
wreck is not foreign, but domestick ; your
Bosom-Friend is to be your greatest Foe, and
even your powerful Undoer for a Time. Mark
what I fay, and take Courage ; it shall be but
for a Time, provided you take Courage. It
will, upon that Condition, be only a stiort and
wholsome Taste of Adversity given to you,
that you may relish returning Prosperity with
Virtue, and with a greater Return ofThanks
to him that dispenses it at Pleasure to Man-
' kind.
os Mr. Dun can Campbell 15 $
c
kind. Remember, Courage and Resignation
' is what I advise you to ; use it (as becomes
e
you) in your Adversity ; and believe, that as
' I foretold that Adversity, so I can foretel, a
'
Prosperity will again be the Consequence of
4
those Virtues ; and the more you feel the one,
'
ought not to cast you down, but raise your
*
Hopes the more, that he who foretold you
*
that so exactly, could likewise foretel you the
*
other.' The Merchant was by this put into
a great Suspense of Mind ; but somewhat bee
sier, by the Second Prediction being annex'd
so kindly to the first fatal one. They crown'd
the Night with a Flask of Burgundy ; and then
parting, each went to their respective Homes.
The Reader may perchance wonder, how I,
who make no mention of my being there, (as
in Truth I was not at the Tavern I should be
able to relate this as of my own Knowledge ;
but if he pleases to have Patience to the End
of the Story, he will have entire Satisfaction
in that Point.
About Half a Year after, the Merchant came
again , told him that his prediction was too
far verify
'd,
to his very dear Cost
;
and that
he was now utterly undone, and beyond any
visible Means of
a
future Recovery
;
and doubt
ing lest the other fortunate Part of the Pre
diction was only told him by way of Encou
ragement,
(
for groundless Doubts and Fears

Mind implung'd

)
besought him very earnestly to tell

him candidly and sincerely , if there was no
real prospect of Good, and rid him at once
of the uneasiness of such a Suspension of
Thought : But pray, too, said' he, with all
the Vehemence of repeated Expostulation, sa
tisfy me, if there are any farther Hopes on
this side the Grave ?
To this, Duncan Campbell made a short, but
a very significant Reply in Writing. 'May the
*
Heavens preserve you from a threatningDan-
*
ger of Life. Take care only of your self j
*
great and mighty Care ; and if you outlive
*
Friday next, you will yet be great, and more
*
fortunate than ever you was , in all the
*
Height of your former most flourishing Space
*
of Life.' He colour'd inordinately, when Dun
can Campbell said Friday ; and conjur'd him to
tell him as particularly as he could, what he
meant by Friday
.<?
He told him, he could not
particularize any farther
;
but that great Dan
ger thrcaten'd him that Day
;
and that with
out extraordinary Precaution,
it
would prove
fatal to him, even to Death. He shook his
Head, and went away in
a
very sorrowful
Plight. Friday past, Saturday came
;
and on
that very Saturday Morning came likewise the
joyful Tidings
,
that what Ventures of his
were given over for lost at Sea
,
were all
come safe into the Harbour. He came the
Moment he receiv'd those Dispatches from his
agent, to Mr. Duncan Campbell
rs
Apartment,
embrac'd him tenderly, and saluted him with
much
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 157
much Gladness of Heart, before a great Room
full of Ladies , where I happen 'd to be pre
sent at that Time ; crying out in a loud
Voice, before he knew what he aid, that
Mr. Campbell had sav'd his Life ; that Friday
was his Birth-day, and he had intended (with
a Pistol) to shoot himself that very Day. The
Ladies thought him mad ; and he, recover'd
from his Extacy, said no more, but sat down,
till Mr. Campbell dismise'd all his Clients ; and
then we Three went to the Tavern together,
where he told me the whole little history, or
narrative, just as is above related.
The Fame which Mr. Duncan Campbell got
by the foregoing, and several other Predicti
ons of the like kind, was become very large
and extensive, and had spread it self into the
remotest Corners of this Metropolis. The
Squares rung with it ; it was whisper d from
one House to another, thro' the more magni
ficent Streets, where Persons of Quality and
Distinction reside ; it catch'd every House in
the City ; like the News of Stock from Ex-
change-Alley^ it run noisily thro' the Lanes
and little Thoroughfares where the Poor in
habit : It was the Chat of the Tea-Table, and
the Babble of the Streets ; and the whole
Town, from the Top to the Bottom, was full
of it. Whenever any Reputation rises to 2'
Degree like this, let it be for what Art or Ac
complishment, or on what Account soever it
will ,* Malice, Envy and Detraction, are sure
to
i$% 77?* Life and Adventures
to be the immediate Pursuers of it with firii
Mouth, and to hunt it down, if possible, with
full Cry. Evert the great Nostradamus, tho'
favour d by Kings and Queens, (which always
without any other Reason creates Enemies)
was not more pursued by Envy and Detra
ction, for his Predictions in Paris, and through
out France , than' our Duncan Campbell was
us London, and even throughout England.
Various, different, and many were the Ob
jections rais'd, to blot his Character, and ex
tenuate his Fame ; that, when one was con
futed, another might not be wanting to sup
ply its Place j and so maintain a Course and
Series of back-biting, according to the known
Maxim,— Throw Dirt, and ifit does notstick,
throw Dirt continually, and some willstick.
Neither is there any wonder ; for a Mart
that has got Applauders of all Sorts and Con
ditions, must expect Condemners and Detra
ctors of all Sorts and Conditions likewise. If
a Lady of high Degree, for Example, should
fey, smiling, (tho really thinking absolute-'
ly what flie says) for fear of being thought
over-credulous :—£
Well, I vow, some Things
*•
Mr. Campbell does, are surprizing, after all ;
*
they would be apt to incline one to a Belief,
*
that he is a Wonder of a Man, for one would
'imagine the Things he does impossible —Why"
then a Prude, with an assumed, supercilious'
Air, and a scornful Tehee, would, in order to4
seem more wise than she was* reply,
c
Lard,
'
Madam,
of Mn Duncan Campbell: "159
*
Madam, 'tis more a Wonder to me, that you
*
can be imposed upon so.—I vow to gad-,
*
Madam, Iwould as soon consult an Almanack?
' Maker, and pin my Faith upon what he pricks .
*
down ; or believe like my Creed, in the Cross
*
which I make upon the Hand of a Gypsie.—*
1
Lard, Madam, I assure your ladyship he knows,
*
no more than I do of you,—I aslure you' so,
' and therefore believe me.— He- has; it all by
1
Hearsay'—If the Lady that believ'dit, should
reply, 'That if he had notice of every Strange
*
by Hearsay, he must be a greater Man than
' she suspected, and must keep more Spies in
' Pay than a Prime. Minister :' TheP/We's
Answer would be with a loud Laugh, and gig^
gling out these Words : —*
Lard, Madam, I
' assure you, nothing can be more easy ; and sa
*
take it for granted.' Because she was inclin'd
to fay so, and had the Art of Wisdom on her
side, forsooth, that she appear d hard of Be
lief, ( which some call hard to be put upon-}
and the other Lady credulous, fwhich some,
tho' believing upon good Grounds, are
call'd^) and so thought foolish ; the Prudes
Answer would be thought sufficient and con
vincing.
Thus Malice and Folly, by Dint of Noise
and Impudence, and strong tho' empty As
sertions, often run down Modesty and good
Sense. Among the common people it is the
fame, but only done in a different manner.
For Example : An ordinary person, that had
2 eon
160 The Life and Adventures
consulted, might say, ( as he walk'd along J
There goes the Dumb Gentleman, who writes
down any Name of a Stranger at first Sight.
Steps up a blunt Stranger , that takes Stub
bornness for Sense, and says,— That is a con
founded Lye ; he is a Cheat and an impostor,
and you are one of his accomplices. He'll
tell me my Name, I suppose, if you tell it
him first. He is no more dumb than I am ;
he can speak and heat as well as us : I have
been with those, that fay they have heard
him. I wish I and Two or Three more had
him in our stable ,• and I warrant you, with
our Cartwhips, we would lick some Words
out of his Chops, as dumb as you call him. —
I tell you, 'tis all a Lye, and all a Bite. —If
the other desires to be convirlc'd for himself
by his own Experience —the rougher Rogue,
who perhaps has stronger Sinews than t'other^
answers, If you lye any farther, I will knock
you down : And so he is the vulgar wit and
the Mouth of the Rabble-Rout. And thus
the Detraction spreads below with very good
Success, as it does above in another kind.
As there are Two Comical Adventures in
his Life, which directly suit and correspond
with the foregoing reflections, this seems the
most proper Place to insert them in. The
first consists of a kind of Mob Way of Usage!
he met with from a Fellow, who got to be an
Officer in the Army, but by the following
Behaviour, will be found unworthy of the
Name, and the Commission; Irt
of Mr. Duncan-Gampbex-J.. i<>i
In.theYear 170 1, a Lady of good quality
came and address'd her self to him much after
the following manner. She told him she had
Choice of Lovers, but preferr'd one above
the rest j but desired to know his Name, and
if she made him her Choice, what would be
the subsequent Fate of such a Matrimony.
Mr. Duncan Campbell very readily gave her
down in Writing this plain and honest Re
ply ; that of all her Suiters she was most in-
clin'd to a Captain, a distinguished Officer,
and a great Beau, ("naming his Name) and
one that had a great many outward engaging
.Charms, sufficient to blind the Eyes of arty
Lady that was not thoroughly acquainted
with his Manner of living. He therefore as
sured her, (and thought himself bound, be
ing conjured so to do, having received his
Fee, though there was Danger in such plain
and open Predictions,) that he was a Villain
and a Rogue in his Heart, a profligate Game
ster, and that if /he took him to her Bed,
fte would only embrace her own Ruin. The
Lady's Woman, who was present, being in Fee
with the Captain, resolving to give Intelli
gence, for fear the Officer her so good Friend
should be disappointed in the Siege ; flily shuf
fled the Papers into her Pocket, and made a
present of them to the military Spark. Fir'd
with indignation at the Contents, he vow'd
revenge ; and in order to compass
it,
con
spires with his Female Spy about the Means.
•'
M In
\6z TbeLiTE and, Adventures
In sine, for fear of losing the Lady though
he quarrel d with Duncan Campbell, a Method
was to be found out how to secure her by the
very Act of Revenge. At last it was re-
sol v'd to discover tq her, that he had found
out what she had been told by Mr. Campbell,
but the Way how -he had been inform 'd
was to remain a Secret. He, did do so,
and ended his Discovery with these. Words:
J desire, Madam, that if I prove him an Im
postor, you would not believe, a Word, he
fays. — The Lady agreed to so fair a Propo
sal. Then the Captain swore that he. him
self would never eat a Piece of Bread more
till he had made Mr. ..£mw^// eat tis Wprds.j
nay he insisted upon
it, that he would bring
him to his Tongue, and make him .own by
Word of Mouth, that what he had written
before was false and calumnious.
,
To which
the Lady ansver'd again, that,
if
he perform
'd
what he said she would be convinced. This
brave Military Man, however, not relying
upon his qwn single Valour and prowess, to
bring about
so
miraculous
a
Thing as the mar
king
a
Person that was dumb to speak
;
he took
with him for this End three lusty Assistants to
combine1 with him in the Assassination. Th$
Ambuscade was settled to be at tfye Kiye Bells
Tavern in Wnh-ftreet
in
theStr^n^l.^ After
the Ambush was settled with
so
much false
Courage, the Business of decoying Mr. Campbell
into
it,
was not practicable any other way,
•
•
than
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. i6j
_
than by sending out false Colours. The La
dy s Woman, who was by her own Interest
tied fast to the Interest of the Beau, was to
play the Trick ofDalikb, and betray this deaf
and dumb Sampson (as he will appear to be a
kind of one in the Sequel of the Story) into
the Hands of these Philistines. She smooths
her Face over with a complimenting Lye
from her Mistress to Mr. Campbell ; and acted
-her Part of Deceit so well that he promis'dto
follow her to the Five Bells with all haste j
and so she skuttled back to prepare t-lie Cap
tain, and to tell him how lucky she was in
Mischief ; and how she drew him out by
Smiles into Perdition. The stiort of the Story
>is, when they got him in among them, they
Endeavour's! toaslasswatehim ;but they miss'd
of their Aim ; yet 'tis certain they left him
in a very terrible and bloody Condition ; and
the Captain .went away in as bad a Plight as
the Person was left in, whom. he aslaulted so
cowardly with Numbers, and to such Disad
vantage. I was sent for to him upon this
Disaster, and the Story was deliver d to me
thus, by one of the Drawers of the Tavern,
when I enquir'd into it. They began to ban-
jter him j..and speaking to him as if he heard,
ask'dhimif he knew his own Fortune ; they
told him it svas to be beaten to Death. This
was ao odd. Way of addressing a deaf and
dumb Man., They added they would m-ake
-him speafc before they .-ha4 done. The Boy

seeing he made no Reply, but only smiled ;
thought what pass'd between them was a Jest
with an old Acquaintance, and withdrew
about his Business. The Door being fasten
'd,
however, before they began the honourable
Attack, they vouchsafed to write down their
Intent
in
the Words above-mentioned which
they had uttered before, to make sure that
he should understand their Meaning, and what
this odd way of Correction was for. All the
while the Maid, who had brought him into
it,
was peeping through
a
Hole, and watch
ing the Event, as appears afterwards. Mr.
Campbell wrote them' the following Answer,
vi&. that he'hop'd for fair Play
;
that he un
derstood Beargarden as well as they
;
but
if
a
Gentleman was amongst them, he would
expect Gentlemanly Usage. The Rejoinder
they made to this consisted,
it
feeriis, riOt of
Words but of Action.
'
The Officer,
in
Con
junction with another Ruffian, one of the
strongest of the Three he had brought, com
menced the Aflault. As good Luck would
have
it,
he warded off their first Blows
(it

:

a
Wine-

took to his Arms, and at Two or Three quick

him than at any other. In all these Scuffles
(whether it is that being deaf and dumb, an
affront works deeper upon a ManT and fe*
renders him far more fierce or resolute) it
must be said, that though Nature has been
kind in making him very Strong, Robust,
and Active withal, yet he has bore some
Shocks, one would imagine beyond the
Strength of a Man, having sometimes got
the better of Five or Six Ruffians in Rencoun
ters of the like kind. ;

The Contents of it were these:

You are no Widow, you are no Wife, and
" yet you are no Maid : You have a Child at

Nurse at such a Place, by such a Gentleman j
'*
and you were brought to Bed in Leicesterfiire.
The Lady, convince! by this Answer, of his
strange and mystical Power, and pleas'd with
his Civility in endeavouring to conceal from
others the Secret, after so many repeated Pro
vocations, tho' me sliew'd great Disorder for
that Day, became one ot his constant At
tendee some Time after, and would not take
any Step in her Affairs without his Advice ;
which, me often has said since, she found very
much to her Advantage. She was as serious in
her dealings with him afterwards, and irn-
proved by being so, as (he was gay and turbu
lent with him before, and smarted for it. In
fine, she was a thorough Convert, and a Vo
tary of his ; and the only Jest she us'd after
wards to make concerning him, was a Civil
Witticism to his Wife ; to whom she was wontK
every now and then, smiling, to address her
self after this manner :
'
Your Husband, Ma-
' dam, is a Devil ; but he is a very hand-
' some, and a very civil one.
Not long after this came another Lady,
with a like Intent to impose upon him ; and
was resolv'd (as she own'd) to have laughed
him to scorn, if she had succeeded in her At
tempt. She had very dextrously dress'd her
self
170 The Life and Adventures
self in her Woman's Habit, and her Woman
in her own ; her Footman squired the new-
made Lady in a very gentlemanly Dress, hir'd
for that Purpose of a Disguise from Monmouth-
fireet. The strange and unknown Masquera-
ders enter'd Mr. Campbell's Room with much
Art. The Fellow was by Nature of a clean
Make, and had a good Look, and from fol
lowing a genteel Master, when he was young,
Copy a his Gait a little, and had some Appear
ance of a Mien, and a tolerable good Air
about him. But this being the first time of
his being so fine; and he a little vain in his
temper ; he over-acted his Part ; he strutted
too much ; he was as fond of his ruffles, his
Watch, his Sword, his cane, and his Snuffc;
Box, as a Boy of being newly put into Breech-'
es ,-ind view d them all too often to be thought
the Posleslbr ofany such Things long.The Veg
ctation of the Chambermaid was insufferable ;
She had the Toss of the Head, the jut of, the;
Bum, the side-long Leer of the eye, the impe
rious Look upon her Lady,; now degraded in
to her Woman, that she was intolerable, and
a Person without the Gift of tho Second-Sight,
Would have guefs'd her to have been a prag
matical Upstart, tho' 'tis very probable, that
during that time, she fancy'd herself real
ly better than her Mistress: The Mistress
acted her Part of Maid the best, for it is ea
sier for genteel Modesty to act alowPartjthari
for affected Vanity to act a high one. She

kept her Distance like a Servant ; but would,
to disguize Things the better, beiesery now
and then part, according to their way, and
give occasion to be chid. But there is an*
Air of Gentility, inborn and inbred to
some people ,• and even when they aim to be
awkward, a certain Grace will attend all their
minutest actions and gestures, and command
love, respect and veneration. ... I must there
fore own, that there was not need of a Man's
being a Conjurer, to guess who ought to be
the Lady, and who the Maid ; but to know
who absolutely was the Lady, and who was,
the Maid, did require that Skill. For how-
many such real Ladies have we, that are made
so from such Upstarts >
And how many gen
teel Waiting-Women of great Descent, that
are born with a grace about them , and are
bred to good Manners 2 Mr. Campbell's Arc
made him positive in the Case : He took the
Patches from the Face of the Maid, and plac'd
them on the Mistress's : He pull d off her Hood
and Scarf, and gave it the Lady ; and taking
from the Lady her Ridinghood, gave it the
Maid in Exchange ,- for Ladies at that Time of
Day, were not entered into that Fashion of
cloaking themselves. Then he wrote down,
that he should go out, and ought to send his
Maid in, to undress them quite, and give the
Mistress her own Cloaths, and the Maid hers
elf
and, with
a
smile, wrote down both their
names, and commended her contrivance. But

iyi TbeLivE arid AdventureS
after that, it was remark'd by the Lady, that
he paid her less respect than she expected,-
and more to her Footman, who was in a Gen
tleman's Habit ; whom he took aside, and
told a great many fine Things ; whereas he
would tell the Lady nothing farther. The
Lady, nettled at this, wrote to him, that she
had Vanity enough to believe, that (he might
be distinguifh'd from her Maid in any Dress ;
but that he had shown his want of Skill, in not
knowing who that Gentleman was. Mr. Camp
bell told her her Mistake in (harp Terms ; and
begging her Pardon, aslur'd her he knew se
veral Chambermaids as genteel and as well
born as her, and many Mistresles more auk-
ward and worse-born than her Maid : Thatr
he did not go therefore by the Rule of Guess
and Judging what ought to be; but by the
Rule of Certainty , and the Knowledge of
what actually was. She, however, unsatisfy'd
with that Answer, perplex'd him mightily to
know, who the Man was. He answers he
would be a Great Man. —The Lady laughed
scornfully, and said, she wanted to know who;
he was, not what he would be. —He an-
swer'd again-— He was her footman ; but
that she would have a worse. —She grew
warm, and desir'd to be inform'd, Why, since
he knew the fellow's condition he respected
her so little, and him so much i And accus'cf

f* far—This Footman will advance himself to
" the Degree of a Gentleman, and have a Wo-

You may avoid your Lot by prudence ; but

This coming afterwards to pals exactly as
was predicted, and his disappointing so many
that had a Mind to impose upon him, has
render d him pretty free from such wily Con
trivances since •, tho' now and then they have
happen'd, but still to the Mortification and
Disappointment of the Contrivers. But as
we have not pretended to fay, with regard
to these things, that he has his Genius always
at his elbow, or his Beck, to whisper in his
Ear the Names of Persons, and such little
constant Events as these ; so, that we may not
be deem'd to give a fabulous Account of his
Life and Adventures, we think our selves
bound to give the Reader an insight into the
particular Power and Capacity which he has,
for bringing about these particular Perform
ances, especially that of writing down Names
of Strangers at first Sight ; which, I don't
doubt, will be done to the Satisfaction of all

j. In
of Mr. Duncan Campbell' 175-
1. In the SecGniSigbt, the Vision makes
such a lively Impression on the Seers, that they
neither fee nor *&#'& of any thing else but the
Vision, as long as it continues : And then they
appear Pensve or Jovial, according to the
ObjeB which was presented to them.
z. At the sight of a Vision, the Eyelids of
the Person are erected, and the Eyes continue
staring till the objects vaniili
;',
as has often
been observed by the Author, and others pre
sent..

There
is
one in Skye, an Acquaintance
of whom observe, that when he sees
a
vision,
the inner Part of his Eyelids turns
so
far up
wards, that, after the object disappears, lie
must draw them down with.hisjingers
;
and
sometimes employs others 'to draw thcui
down
,
which he finds to be much the easier
way.
4. The Faculty of the Second-Sight docs not
lineally descend
in
a
family, as some ima
gine
,•
for he knows several Parents that are
endow'd with
it,
but not their Children
;
and
so
on the contrary
:
Neither
is
it
acauir'd
by
any previous compact. And after
a
strict En
quiry, he could never learn from any among
them, that this Faculty was communicable
any way whatsoever.
Note, That this Account
is
differing from
the Account that
is
given by Mr. Aubrey,
a
Fellow of the Royal Society
:
And
I
think
Mr. Martens Reason here, against the Descent
of
/
176 The Life and Adventures
. of this Faculty from Parents to Children, is
not generally conclusive. For tho' he may-
know Parents endow 'd with
it,
and not Chil
dren
;
and
so
vice versa
;
yet there may be
Parents who are cndow'd with
it,
being qua
lify
d
as Mr. Aubrey has said,
(
viz. both be
ing Second sighted? or even one to an extra
ordinary Degree) whose Children may have
it
by
Descent. And as to this Faculty's being
any otherways communicable, (since the Ac
counts differ)
I
must leave
it
to
a
farther Exa
mination.
*
j.
The Seer knows neither the Object,
Time nor Place ofzVision? before
it
appears
;
and the fame Object is often seen
by
different
Persons, living at
a
considerable Distance from
one another. The true Way ofJudging, as to
the Time and Circumstance of an Object,
is
by Observation
:
For several Persons ofJudg
ment, without this Faculty, are more capable
to judge of the Design of
a
Vision? than
a
No
vice that
is
a
Seer. As an Object appears in
the Day or Night,
it
will come to pads sooner
or later accordingly.
6.
If an Object be seen early
in
the Morn
ing, (which
is
not frequent)
it
will be accom-
plifli'd
in
a
few Hours afterwards
:
If
at Noon,
it
will commonly be accomplim'd that very
bay
:
If
in
the Evening, perhaps that Night
j
If
after Candles be lighted,
it
will be accom-
plifli'd that Night.

If Two or Three Women are seen at once",
standing near a Man's Left Hand ; she that is
next him will undoubtedly be his Wife first,
and so on, whether all three, or the Man,
be single or married, at the Time of the Vi
sion ; of which there are several late instances
of the Authors Acquaintance. It is an ordi
nary Thing for them to see a Man, that is to
come to the House shortly after j and tho' he
be not of the Seers Acquaintance, yet he not
only tells his Name, but gives such a lively
description of his stature, Complexion, Ha
bit, &(. that upon his Arrival, he answers the
character given of him in all respects. If
the Person so appearing be one of the Seers
Acquaintance, he can tell by his Countenance
whether he comes in good or bad Humour*
The Author has been seen thus by Seers of
both Sexes, at some Hundreds of Miles Di
stance. Some that saw him in this manner,
had never seen him personally, and it hap-
pen'd according to their visions, without any
previous Design of his to go to those Places ;
his coming there being purely accidental. And
in the Nineteenth page of his Book, he tells
us, that Mr. Daniel Morrison (a Minister) told
him, that upon his Landing in the Island Re-
71a, the Natives receiv'd him very affectio
nately, and addressed themselves to him with
this Salutation :
*
God save you, Pilgrim .' You

are heartily welcome here j for we have had

pearing, then the Second fees it as well as the
First.
ii. There is the way of foretelling Death
by a Cry, that they call Taifk, which feme
call a Wrath in the Low-land. They hear a
loud Cry without Doors, exactly resembling
the Voice of some particular Person, whose
.Death is foretold by it ; of which he gives a
late Instance, which happen d in the; Village
Rigg, in Skye-IJle. . ; , ';.;;„.■•■•.
12. Things are also foretold by Smelling
sometimes, as follows : Fish or FJefh is ifre-
quently smelt in the Fire, when at the fame
Time neither of the two are in the House,
or, in any Probability, like to be had in it
for some Weeks or Months. This Smell se
veral Persons have, who are endued with the
Second-Sight ; and it is always accomphfh'd
soon after. ■■
. ;
,
13. Children, Horses and Cows, have the
Second-Sight, as well as Men and Women ad
vanced in Years. ;
r. «,._.-.
. That Children fee
it,
is
plain, from their
crying aloud at the very Instant that
a
Corpse,
ox any other Vision appears to an ordinary
Seer
:
Of which he gives an Instance in
a
Child, when himself was present.
'
That Horses likewise see
it,
is
very plain,
from their violent and sudden Starting, when
the Rider, or Seer in Company with them,
sees
a
Vision of any kind by Night Qr Day. It
j^
obser
cfMr. Duncan Campbell. 181
observable of a horse, that he will not go
forward that way, till he be led about at some
Distance from the common Road, and then
he is in a Sweat. He gives an instance of
this in a Horse, in the Isle of Skye.
That Cows have the Second-Sight, appears
from this ; That if a Woman milking a Cow,
happens to see a Vision by the Second-Sight,
the Core runs away in a great Fright at the
lame Time, and will not be pacify 'd for some
Time after.
In Reference to this, Paracelsus, Tom. 9.
L. de Jrte prœfagd, writes thus :
'
Horses also
*
have their Auguries ; who perceive, by their
'
Sight and Smell, wandring Spirits, Witches
' and Spe&res, and the like Things ; and Dogs
*
both see and hear the fame.
Here, in the next place, the Author an
swers objections, that have lately been made
against the Reality of the Second-Sight.
First, It is objected, that these seers are
Visionary and Melancholy People, who fancy
they see Things, that do not appear to them
or any body else.
He answers ; The people of these Isies, and
particularly the seers, are very temperate,
and their" Diet is simple and moderate, in
Quantity arid quality ; so' that their Brains
are not, in all Probability, disorder'd by un
digested fumes of Meat or Drink. Both
Sexes are free from HyfterickHits, Convul
sions, and several other Distempers of that
"'■■' N 3
■"
Sort
181 The Life and Adventure*
Sort. There are^o Madmen among them,
nor any instance of Self-Murthcn It is ob-
ferv'd among them, that a Man drunk, never
has a Vision of the Second-Sight ; and he that
is a Visionary, would discover himself in other
Things as well as in that. Nor are such as have
the Second-Sight, judgd to be Visionaries, by
any of their Friends or Acquaintance-
Secondly, It is objected, that there are none
among the learned, able to oblige the world
with a satisfactory Account of these Visions ;
therefore they are not to be believed.
He answers ; If every Thing, of which the
Learned are not able to give a satisfactory Ac
count, shall be condemn d as False and Impos
sible, we shall find many other Things, gene
rally believed, which must b&reje&edissuch.
Thirdly, It is objected, that the Seers are Im
postors ; and the People, who believe them,
are credulous, and easy to be impos'd upon.
He answers ; The Seers are generally illi
terate and well-meaning People, and altoge
ther void of Design : Nor could he ever learn
that any of them made the least Gain of it ;
neither is it reputable among them to have
that faculty. Beside, the People of the Isles
are not so credulous as to believe an Impos
sibility, before the Thing foretold be accom
plish a ; but when it actually comes to pass,
afterwards it is not in their Power to deny
it,
without offering Violence to their Senses and
Reason. Beside,
if
the Seers were Deceiver sx
r :/ can

can it be reasonable to imagine, that all the
Islanders, who have not the Second-Sight,
should combine together, and offer Violence
to their Understandings and Senses, to force
themselves to believe a Lye from Age to Age I.
There are several Persons among them, whose
Birth and Education raise them above the
Suspicion of concurring with an Imposture,.
merely to gratify an illiterate and contempti
ble Sort of Persons. Nor can a reasonable
Man believe, that Children, Horses and Cows9
could be engaged in a combination, to per
suade the World of the reality of a Second-
Sight.
Every Vision that is seen, comes exactly
to pass according to the Rules of Observati
on ; tho' Novices, and heedless Persons, can
not always judge by those Rules : Concern
ing which he gives instances.
There are Visions seen by several persons,
in whose Days they are not accomplifli'd j
and this is one of the reasons, why some
Things have been seen, that are said never to
have come to pass ; and there are also several
Visions seen, which are not understood till
they are accomplifli'd.
'
The Second-Sight is not a late Discovery,
seen by one or two in a Corner, or a remote
Isle ; but it is seen by many Persons of both
Sexes, in several rifles, separated about Forty
or Fifty Leagues from one another. The In
habitants of many of these Isles never had
N 4 the
'184 The Life and Adventur es
the least Converse by Word or Writing. And
this Faculty of feeing Visions having conti
nued, as we are inform 'd by Tradition, ever
since the Plantation of these Istes, without
being disproved by the nicest Sceptick, after
the strictest Enquiry, seems to be a clear Proof
of- its Reality.
It is observable, that it was much more
common Twenty or Thirty Years ago, than
at present ; for One in Ten does not fee it
now, that (aw it then. - :
The Second-Sight is not confin'd to the We
stern Isles alone ; the Author having an Ac
count that it is in several Parts of Holland, but
particularly in Bommel, where a Woman has
it, for which she is courted ■
by some , and
dreaded by others.
;
She fees a Smoak about
one's Face, which is the Fore-runner of the
Death of a Person so seen ; and ihe actually
foretold the Deaths of several that lived there.
She was living in that Town a few Winters
ago. L : . ■ -;.-.. . ;
The Second-Sight is likewise in the Isle of
Man, as appears by this Instance : Captairi
Leathes, the Chief Commander of Belfast, in
his Voyage 1690, lost Thirteen Men by a vio*
lent Storm ; and upon his Landing in the IJle
of Man, an ancient Man, Glerk to a Panflt
there, told him immediately that he had lost
Thirteen Men there. The Captain enquir'd,
how he came'to the Knowledge of that ? He
answer'd, that it was by Thirteen Lights, which
\ "'. he
pf Mr. Duncan Gamp be l i- ji&f
Jie had seen come into the Churchyard ; as
Mr. Sacheverell tells us, in his late Descripti
on of the -Isle of Man. Note , That this is
like the Sight of the Corpse-Candles in Wales,
which is also well attested. 'r'
■ '
Here the author adds many other instances
concerning the Second- Sight, of which I shall
set down only zfeiv.
A Man in Knockow, in St. Mary's Pari/n,
(the Northernmost Part of Skye') being in
perfect Health, and sitting with his Fellow-
Servants at night, was on a sudden taken
ill, dropp'd from his Seat backward, and then
fell a vomiting ,• at which the Family was
much concern'd, he having never been subject
to the like before ;but he came to himself soon
after, and had no Sort of Pain about him.
One of the Family, who was accustomed to
seethe Second-Sight, told them, that the Man's
Illness proceeded from a very strange Causes
which was thus' : An ill-natur'd Woman
(whom he named) who lives in the next adja
cent Village of Bornskittag, came before him
in a very* angry and furious Manner ; her
countenance full of passion, and her Mouth
full of reproaches j and threaten'd him with
her Head and Hands, till he fell over, as you
have seen him. This woman had a Fancy
for the man, but was like to be disappointed
as to her marrying of him. This instance
was told the Author, by the Master of the
v -
l .:— w' Fami
1S6 The Life and Adventures
family, and others, who were present when
it happened.
Sir Norman Maeklead, and some others,
playing at tables, at a Game called in frisk
Falmermore ; wherein there are Three of a
Side, and each of them throw the Dice by
turns ; there happend to be one difficult Point
in the disposing of one of the Table-men. This
obliged the Gamester to deliberate, before he
was to change his Man ; since, upon the dis
posing of
it,
the winning or losing of the Game
depended. At length the butler, who stood
behind, advised the Player where to place
the Man, with which he comply
d,
and won
the Game. This being thought extraordi
nary, and Sir Norman hearing one whisper
him
in
the Ear, ask'd who adyis'd him so
skilfully
i
He answer'd,
it
was the Butler
;
but
this seemed more strange, for
it
was generally
thought he could not play at Tables. Upon
this, Sir Norman ask'd him, how long
it
was
since he had learn'd to play
?
And the Fellow
own'd, that he had never play'd in his Life;
but that he saw the Spirit Browne
(a
Spirit
usually seen
in
that Country) reaching his
Arm over the Players Head, and touching the
Part with his Finger, where the Table-man was
to be placed. This was told the Author by
Sir Norman, and others, who happened to be
present at the time.
Daniel Bow, alias Black, an Inhabitant of
Bomfkittag, who
is
one of the precisest Seers
in
of Mr. Duncan Campbill. ^7
in the Isles, foretold the Death of a Young
Woman in Minginis, within less than Twenty
four Hours before the Time ; and accordingly
the died suddenly in the Fields ; tho' at the
Time of the prediction, she was in perfect
Health : But the Shroud appearing close about
her Head, was the Ground of his Confidence
that her Death was at Hand.
The fame Person foretold the Death of a
Child in his Master's Arms, by seeing a Spark
of Fire fall on his Left Arm ; and this was like
wise accomplifh'd soon after the prediction.
Some of the Inhabitants of Harries failing
round the JJle of Skye, with a Design to go to
the opposite Main-Land, were strangely sur
prized with an Apparition of Two Men,
hanging down by the Ropes that secur'd the
Mast, but could not conjecture what it meant.
They pursued their Voyage ; but the Wind
turning contrary, they were forced into broad
er, in the line of Skye, where they found
Sir Donald Mackdonald keeping a Sheriffs
Court, and two Criminals receiving Sentence
of Death there^ The Ropes and Mast of
that very Boat, ,were made use of to hang
those Criminals. This was told the Author
by several, who had this instance related to
them by the Boat's- Crew.
Several Persons, living in a certain Fami
ly, told the Author, that they had frequently
seen Two Men standing at a Gentlewoman s
Left Hand, who was their Master's Daughter :
v ■'' Sou
they
}$% The Life and Adventures
they told the Men's Names, and being her
equals, it was not doubted but she would be
marry 'd to one of them ; and perhaps to the
other after the Death of the first. Some time
after a Third Man appeared, who seemed
always to stand nearest to her of the Three,
but the seers did not know him, though they
could describe him exactly ; and within some
Months after, this Man, who was seen last,
actually came to the House, and fully an-
swer'd the Description given of him, by those,
who never saw him but in a Vision ; and he
marry 'd the Woman shortly after : They live
in the TJle of Skye, and both themselves and
others confirmed the truth of this instance,
when the Author sew them.
Archibald Mac Donald, of the Parish of St.
Mary's in the JJle of Skye, being reputed fa
mous in his Skill of foretelling Things to come
by the Second-Sight, happening to be in the
Village Ktwckow one night, and before Sup
per, told the Family, that he had just then
seen the strangest Thing he ever saw in his
Life : viz. A man with an ugly long Cap,
always making his Head ; but that the strangest
of all was a little kind of an Harp, which he
had with Four Strings only, and that it had
Two Harts-horns fix d in the Front of it : All
that heard this odd Vision fell a laughing at
Archibald, telling him, that he was dreaming,
or had not his Wits about him, since he pr<&.'
tended to fee a Thing which had no being,
and
of Mr. Duncan-Campbell 1S9
and was not so much as heard of in any part
of the World. All this could not alter Archi
bald's Opinion, who told them, that they must
excuse him if he laugh'd at them, after this
Accomplishment of the Vision. Archibald re
turned to his own House, and within Three
or Four days after, a Man with cap, Harp,
&c. came to the House, and the Harp, Strings,
Horns, and Cap, answer'd the Description of
them at first View, and he (hook, his Head
when he play'd ; for he had two Bells fix'd
to his Cap. This Harper was a poor man,
who made himself a Buffopfl.;(fpr his Bread,
and was never seen before in ifopfe Parts, and
at the Time of the Prediction he was in the
rifle of Barray, which is'about twenty leagues
distant from that Part of Skye. This Rela
tion is vouch'd by Mr. Daniel Maneq and all
his family, and such as were then present,
and they live in the. village-, where this hap7
pened. • ,v- ■■

One Daniel Nicholson, Minister of St. Ma-}
rys in Skyey the- parish in , which ever Archi
bald Mac Donald lived, told the author ; that,
one Sunday, after Sermon, at {he Chapel
Vge, he took an occasion to enquire of Archi
bald, if he still retain'd that unhappy faculty
of seeing the Second-Sight, and wisli'd, him to
get rid of
it,
if
possible
;
for, said*he,
it
is
no
true character of

highly displeased, and answered that, he hoped
he was no more unhappy than his-Neighbours,

had, said he, as serious Thoughts as my

Ground, close to the Pulpit j arid I asliife you*

"Note, That
it
is
counted by many an Argui
mertt of somewhat Evil attending this Facul
ty of the Second-Sights, because there areTrii
stances given of some Persons who have beeri
freed of

ctices. But
I
shall hereafter jhow, that thii
Opinion cannot be entirely true.
Sir Norman Mac-Lead, who has his RelP
dence
in
the Isle of Bernera, which lies be
tween the Isles of N. Vist and Harries, went
to the IJle of Skye about Business, without ap
pointing any Time for his Return
:
His Ser^
vants, in his Absence, being all together id
the large Hall at Night
;
one of them, who
had the Second-Sight, told the rest they must
remove, for there would be Abundance of o-
ther Company in the Hall that Night. One os'
2
his
of Mr. Duncan Campbell" 191
his Fellow-Servants answer'd, that there was
very little Likelihopd of that, because of the
Darkness of the Night, and the Danger of
coming thro' the Rocks, that lie round the
Ifie : But within an Hour after, one of Sir
Normans Men came to the House, bidding
them provide Lights, &c. for his Mailer had
newly landed.
Sir Norman being told of this, called for
the Seer, and examin'd him about it. He an
swer'd, that he had seen the Spirit Browne,
in human Shape, come several Times, and
make a Show of carrying an old Woman (that
fat by the Fire) to the Door ; and at last
seem'd to carry her out by Neck and Heels ;
which made him laugh heartily, and gave Oc
casion to the rest to conclude him Mad, to
laugh so much without any Reason. This
Instance was told the Author, by Sir Normart
himself.
Four Men from the Isle of Skye and Harries
went toBarbadves, and stay 'dthere some Years;
Who, tho' they had wont to see the Second*
Sight in their native Country, never saw it in
Barbadoes ; but upon their Return to England^
the first Night after their Landing, they saw
the Second-Sight ; as the Author was told bj*
several of their Acquaintance. .

that Country, printed in London, Anno xjo%,
in Folio, has given us several Instances of this
kind, as also of many other Diabolical Opera
tions. Mr. Baxter's Book concerning the Cer
tainty of the World of Spirits, has the like
Proofs in it. Mr. Aubrey, Fellow of the Roy
al Society, has written largely concerning Se
cond-sighted Persons ; so has Dr. Beaumont, in
his Book of Gentj and Familiar Spirits , who
has collected almost all the other Accounts
together ; and many others , whose very
Names it would be tedious to recite. How
ever, as there are a few more Passages very
curious in themselves, I will venture so far
upon the Reader's Patience, as not only to
recite the Names of the Authors, but the Ac
counts themselves, in as succinct and brief a
manner as it is possible for any one to do.
Mr. Th. May, in his History, Lib. 8. writes,
That an old Man (like an Hermtt,) Second-
sighted, took his Leave of K. James I. when
he came into England .* He took little Notice
of Prince Henry ; but addressing himself to
the Duke of Tor k, [since K. Charles I] fell a
weeping, to think what Misfortunes he should
undergo ; and that He should be one of the
most Miserable and most Unhappy Princes
that ever was.
A Scots Nobleman sent for one of these
Second-sighted Men out of the Highlands, to
give his Judgment of the then Great George
ViUarsy Duke of Buckingham. As soon as ever
% he

he saw him ; Pifi, said he, He will come to
Nothing : Isee a Dagger in his Breast. And
he was stabbed in the Breast by Captain Tel-
ton, as has been at large recounted in some
of the foregoing Pages.
Sir James Melvil hath several the like pas
sages in his history.
A certain old Man in South-Wales , told a
great Man there of the Fortune of his Family ;
and that there should not be a Third Male
Generation. It has fallen out accordingly.
Sir William Dugdale, with his own Mouth,
inform 'd several Gentlemen, that Major-Ge
neral Middleton (since Lord) went into the
Highlands of Scotland, to endeavour to make
a Party for King Charles I. An old Gentle
man ("that was Second sighted) came and told
him, that his Endeavour was good, but he
would be unsuccessful : And moreover, That
they would put the King to Death j and that
several other Attempts would be made, but all
in vain. But that his Son would come in, but
not reign in a long Time ; but would at lafi
be restored. This Lord Middleton had a great
Friendship with the Laird Bocconi ; and they
made an agreement, that the first of them
that died, would appear to the other in Ex
tremity. The Lord Middleton was taken
Prisoner at Worcester Fight, and was prisoner
in the Tower of London, under Three Locks*
Lying in his Bed, pensive,. Bocconi appear d to
him : My Lord Middleton ask'd him, if he

196 The Live1 and Advent ujies
were dead or alive ? He said, dead ; and that
he was a Ghost : And told him , that within
Three Days he mould escape ; and he did so,
in his Wife's Cloaths. When he had done his
Mestage, he gave a Frisk, and said,
Givanni, Givanni, 'tis very firange,
In the World to fee so sudden a change :
And then gather'd up, and vanilh'd. This Ac
count Sir William Dugdale had from the Bi
shop of Edinburgh» ; and this Account he hath
writ in a Book of Miscellanies, which is now
deposited (with other 'Books 'of his) in the
■Museum at'Oxsord.
Thus the Reader fees, what great Autho
rities may be produced to prove, that wonder
ful and true predictions have been deliver d
by many Persons gifted with the Second-Sight :
The most learned Men in almost all Nations,
who are not' in all Likelihood deceiv d them
selves ;■ the most celebrated; and authentick
Historians, and some Divines, in England,
"who, tis not to be thought, have combined
together, and made it their Business to obtrude
upon us Fallhoods ; Persons' of all Ranks,
from the highest to the lowest, in Scotland,
who (it would be even Madness to think )
would join in confederacy to impose Tricks
upon us, and to persuade us to the greatest
of Impostures, as solemn truths' delivered
from their own Mouths : All these, I fey,
have unanimously, and (as it were) with one
voice affected, repeated, and consirm'd to us,
1 .. that
**•

of Mr. Duncan Campbell, 197"
that there have~been -at all Times, and in
many different Nations, and that still there
are persons, who, postefs'd with the Gift of a
Second-Sights predict Things that wonderfully
come to pass, and seem to merit very little
less than the Name of Prophets, for their mi
raculous Discoveries. Now if any Man should
come, and without giving the least manner
of Reason for it,
(
for there
is
no Reason to be
given against such Asiertions
;
)
declare his
disbelief of all these authentick, tho strange,
Accounts
;
can he with Reason imagine, that
his Incredulity /hall pass for
a
Token of Wis
dom
?
Shall his Objlinacy confute the Learned?
Shall his Want of Faith be thought juHly to
give the lye to
so
many Persons of the highejl

In fine, shall his Infidelity, by
a

therefore for granted, that no

will

198 The Life and Adventures
any Man of common Sense to have the Front
of declaring his disbelief of them in such a
manner, as to urge it for an argument, and a
Reason, why others should disbelieve them
too : Taking this, I fay, as I think I very
well may, for granted ,- I think there remains
nothing farther for me to offer, before I con
clude this Chapter, except a few Remarks, as
to the Similitude there is between those Acti
ons, which I have related above to have been
penorm d by Mr. Campbell, and these Acti
ons which so many Learned, Ingenious, and
Noble Authors as I have just now quoted, have
asserted to have been perrbrm'd by Persons,
whom they knew to be gifted with the Se
cond Sight.
As to what is said, ("several Pages above )
concerning Duncan Campbells when a Boy at
Edinburgh, that he even told his little Com
panions, who would have Success at their
little M itches, when they play'd ar Marbles ;
and that he inform'd a great Gamester there,
( La hose Name I have disguized under that of
Count Cog) what Times he should chuse to
play, if he would win ; as ludicrous as it may-
have appear 'd to be , and as much as it may
have seemed to my Readers to carry with it
nothing better than the Face of Invention,
and the Air of Fiction : Yet if they will be at
the Pains of comparing that Paflage of Dun
can Campbell's, with the Account given in
•
this Chapter from the Mouth of Sir Norman
Mac-
of Mr. DukcanGampbell 201
First then, if we have a mind to make a
tolerable guess, which way Mr. Campbell came
acquainted that the Death of the beautiful
young Lady, Mrs. Willard' was so near at
Hand, and that, tho' she was so universally
admired, she would Die unmarried ; the Ac
counts given of other Second'fight ed Persons
in the like Cafes, will put us in the most pro
bable way of guessing right. This is ex
plains by the Seventh Observation in this
Chapter, where it is said from Mr. Marten,
that when a Shroud is perceiv'd about one,
it's a sure Prognostick of Death
';•
the Time
is
judg'd according to the Height of
it,
about
the Person
;
for
if
it
be not seen above the
middle, Death
is
not to be expected for the
space of
a
Year or longer, but as
it comes
nearer to the Head
it
is
expected sooner
;
if
so, the very Head,
it
is
concluded to be at
Hand within
a
few Days,
if
not Hours. Of
this we have an Example of which Mr. Mar
ten was an Eye- witness, concerning the Death
of his own Acquaintance
;
but he did not in
the least regard
it,
till the Death of the Per
son, about the Time foretold, confirm'd to
him the certainty of the prediction.
Secondly, As to the ignominious Death that
Irwin came to* and which He predicted to his
Mother,
so
long before, when (he was
in
flourishing Circumstances, and when there
was no appearance, that any of her Children
should be.Jbrought to
a
beggarly Condition,
'
'
bl and
aox The Life and Adventures
and learn among base Gangs of Company to
thieve, and be carried to the Gallows.: The
Story told in this Chapter of some of in
Jjabitants of Harries, ailing round the Isle of
She, and seeing the Apparition of two Men
hanging by the Ropes on the Mast of their
Vessel, and when they came to the opposite
mainland, finding two Criminals just sen
tence! to Death, by Sir Donald Mac Donald,
and seeing their own very Mast and Ropes
made choice of for their Execution, clears up
the manner how Mr. Campbell might predict
this of Irwin likewise by the force of the
Second-Sight.
Thirdly, As to Mr. Campbell's telling Chri
stallina the Belle, and chief Toast ofthe Court,
and Urbana the reigning Beauty of the City,
that they would shortly be married, and who
were to be their husbands ; it is a Thing he
has done almost every Day in his Life to one
Woman or other, that comes to consult him
about the Man she is to be married to ; the
manner, he probably takes in doing this, may
be likewise explain'd by the foregoing Story
in this Chapter, about the Savants, who said
they saw three Men standing by the left
hand of their Master's Daughter ; and that
he that was nearest would marry her first,
whom they plainly and exactly described, tho
they had never seen him but in their Vision,
as appeared afterwards. For within some
frlonths after, the very Man described, did
come
of Mr. Dun can Campbell %o%
come to the House, and did marry her. Vide-
the Eighth Observation of the Second-Sight.
Fourthly, As to the predictions deliver d
by Mr. Campbell to the Merchant, which are
set down at length in the foregoing chapter,
I know no better way at guessing the manner
bow the Second-Sight operated in him at that
Time, than by comparing them to these Two
Instances, which I briefly repeat, because
they are set down at length before in this
chapter. And first it may be ask'd, how did
the Second- Sight'operate in Mr. Campbell, when
it gave him to know, that the Merchants
Ships, which repeated Intelligences had in
appearance confirm'd to be lost, were at that
time safe, and would return securely home
into the Harbour designed >. The best way of
accounting for
it,
that
I
know,
is
by the Story
that Sir Norman Maclead
is
above affirm'd
to have told with his own Mouth concerning
a
Servant of his, who rightly foretold his re

the Danger of coming through the Rocks that

particular Genius or familiar Spirit, which we
spoke of before. What I have already in
stanced in, is (I think) sufficient with regard
to the wonderful Things which Mr. Camp
bell has perform'd, either by the Intervention,
of a Genius, or the Power of a Second-Sight.
But as he has frequently done a great many
amazing Performances, which seem to be of
such a Nature, that they can't be well and
clearly explain'd to have been done either by
the Intervention of his familiar Spirit and
Genius, or by the Power of the Second-Jighted
Faculty, we must have recourse to the Third
Means, by which only such Predictions and
Practices can becompass'd, before we expound-
these new Mysteries, which appear like incre
dible Riddles, and Ænigmds at the first ; and
this Third Means which we must have re
course to for expounding these strange Acts
of his, is a due Consideration of the Force
and Power of Natural Magick, which toge
ther with a Narrative of the A&s, which he
seems magically to bring about, will be the
Subject of the following Chapter.

In order to this j must return back to the
Year 1 70.x * about . which time some unac

zard, as if that way-ward and inconstant
Goddess was refolv'd to punish him, when
she catch'd him on the blind Side, for having
faith a quick insight and penetrating faculty
in other Peoples Matters, and scrutinizing
too narrowly into her Mysteries, and be fore
times preventing those fatal Intentions of hers,
into which she would fain lead many Mor
tals hood- wink'd, and before they knew where
they were. In this Light, these mighty and
famous seers seem to be born for the Benefit
and Felicity of others, but at the fame time
to be born to Unhappinefs themselves. And cer
tainly, in as much as we consider them as useful
and beneficial often, but always satisfactory to
Persons who are curious in their Enquiries
about their Fortunes ; it will be natural to
those of us, who have the least Share of Ge
nerosity in our Minds, to yield our Pity and
Compassion to them, when they are remar
kably unfortunate themselves ; especially when
that Calamity seems more particularly to light
upon them for their Ability, and endeavour
to consult the good Fortune of other Folks.
About the above-mentionedYear i yoxJ)un~
can Campbell grew a little tired of his Profession.
Such a multitude of Followers troubled him,
several of whom were wild Youths and came
to banter him, and many more too inquisitive
Females, to teaze him with endless Imper
tinences, and who, the more he told them,
had still the more to ask , and whose Curio*
iky was never to be satisfied : And besides this,
ho
of Mr. Duncan Ca mfbellI 107
he was so much envy'd, and had
Ger
many-
malicious Artifices daily practised against him,
that he refolv'd to leave off his Profession*
He had
(I
know) followed
it
pretty closely
from the time
I
first saw him
in
London,which
was
I
think in the beginning ofthe year
1
698,
till the Year 1702, with very good success
;
and in those few Years he had got together:
a
pretty round Sum of Money. Our young
Seer was now at Man's Estate,and had learn'd
the Notion that he was to be his own Gover
nor, so far as to be his own Counsellor too
some what Road of Life he was to take
5
artd
this Consideration (no doubt) work'd with
a
deeper Impression on his Mind, than
it
usu
ally does on others that are in the fame blos
soming Pride of Manhood, because
it might
appear more natural for him to believe, that
he had
a
sufficient Ability to be his own pro*
per Adviser, who had given
so
many others,
and some more aged than himself, Counsel,
with very good Success. Now every expe-
rienc'd Person knows, that when Manhood

against all the contingent Shocks

may meet with from the Weather or other

it
was his Misfortune to be made
averse to Business, which he lov'd before, by
having too much of

and to be

Nay, indeed this was another Mischief arising
to him from his having so much business,
that he had got Money enough to leave it off,"
when the Perplexities of 'it^'had made him
willing to do st and to live very comfortably
and handsomely, like . a'Gentleman without
it for a time.' ;' and we know the youngest
men are not wont to look the farthest before
them in matters that concern their own Wel-
fare. Now inasmuch as he had thus taken
a Disgust to Business and Application,and was
surfeited (as I may say^ with the Perplexities
of
it,
it
must be as natural for him, we know*
to search for Repose in the contrary Extream^
viz,. Recreation and Idleness, as
it
is
for a
Man to seek Rest after toil, to sleep after
a
Day's Labour, or to sit down after
a
long and
tiresome Walk. But there are two very
di
stinct Sorts of Idleness, and two very different
Kinds of Recreation
;
there
is
a
shameful Idle-1
ness which
is
no better than downright-
Sloth
;
and there
is
a
splendid kind of Indo
lence, where
a
Man having taken an Aversion
:
CO
of Mr. DuncakCimpbe ll. xoj*
to the Wearisometiets of a business which pro
perly belongs to him, neglects not however
to employ his Thoughts, when they are va
cant from what they ought more chiefly to
be about, in other Matters not entirely un
profitable in Life, the Exercise of which he
finds he can follow with more abundant Ease
and Satisfaction. There are some Sorts of
Recreations too, that are mean, fordid, and
base ,• others, that are very innocent, tho'
very diverting, and that will give me the
very next most valuable Qualifications' of a
Gentleman, after those which are obtained
by a more serious Application of the Mind.
The Idea which I have already given my
Readers of our Duncan Campbell, will easily
make them judge, before I tell them, which
way (in these two ways) his Genius would
naturally lead him ; and that, when he grew
an idle Man, he would rather indulge him
self with applying his Mind to the mining
Trifles of Life, than be wholly slothful and
unactive ; and that when he diverted him
self, he would not do it after a sordid, base
manner, as having a better Taste, and a Relish
for good Company ; but that his Recreations
would still be the Recreations of a Gentle
man. And just, accordingly, as my Readers
would naturally judge beforehand in his cafe,
so it really happen 'd : The Moment he look
off Business, and dismiss d the Thoughts of
it, his Genius led him to a very gallant
P
'
Way
X -v.
•
xto The Life and Adventures
Way of Life ; in his Lodgings, in his Enter
tainments, in paying and receiving visits, in
Coffee- Houses, in Taverns, in Fencing-Schools,
in Balls and other Publick Assemblies ; in all
ways, in fine, both at home and abroad, Dun
can Campbell was a well- comported and Civil
Fine Gentleman : He was a Man of Pleasure j
and nothing of the Man of Business appear'd
about him. But a Gentleman's Life, without
a Gentleman's Estate, (however shining and
pleasant it may be for a Time) will certainly
end in Sorrow, if not in Infamy. And com
paring Life (as Moralists do) to a Day,
one may safely pronounce this Truth to
all the splendid Idlers I have mention d ;
That if they have sunshiny Weather till Noon,
yet the Afternoon of their Life will be very
stormy, rainy and uncomfortable, and per
haps just at the End of theirjourney, (to carry
on the Metaphor throughout) close in the l
est kind of Night. Of this, as I was a Man of
Years, and more experienc'd in the World
than he, I took upon me to forewarn Mr.
Campbell, as soon as I perceiv'd the first dange
rous Fit of this elegant Idleness had seiz'd
him. But when will young Men, by so much
the more headstrong, as they have less of the
Beard, be guided, and brought to learn 2 And
when shall we see that happy Age, in which
the grey Heads of old Men shall be clapp'd
upon the Shoulders of Youth ? I told him,
that in this one Thing he ought to consult me,
and
of Æf>\DnNCAN Campbell. 211
and acknowledge me to be a true Prophet,
if I told him the End of the seeming merry
Steps in Life he was now taking, would in
fallibly bring him to a Labyrinth of Difficul
ties ; out of which if he extricated himself at
all, he would at least find it a laborious Piece
of Work. His Taste had been already vitia
ted, with the Sweets which lay at the Top of
the bitter Draught of Fortune ; and my honest
rugged Counsel came too late to prevail, when
his Fancy had decoy'd and debauch'd his
Judgment, and. carry 'd it over into another
Interest. I remember I writ down to him
the Moral Story, where vicious Pleasure and
Virtue are pictured by the Philosopher to ap
pear before Hercules , to court him into two
several Paths. I told him more particularly,
since he had not an Estate to go thro' with
the Gentlemanly Life, ("as he called it ) that
if he followed the alluring Pleasures, which
endeavour'd to tempt Hercules, he would in
volve himself at last in a whole Heap of Mise
ries, out of which it would be more than an
Herculean Labour for him to disentangle
himself again. If he had been a Man that
could have ever heard with either, I would
have told the Reader in a very familiar Idi
om, that he turn'd the deaf Ear to me ; for
he did not mind one Syllable nor Tittle of the
Prescriptions I set down for him, no more
than if he had never read them ; but, varying
the Phrase a little, I may fay at least, when
. . P 2 he
xii The Life and Adventures
he should have look'd upon my Counsel with
all the Eyes he had, he turn'd the blind Side
upon
it.
I
was resolv'd to make use of the Re
venge natural to
a
Man of Years, and there
fore apply
d
that reproachful Proverb to him,
which we Ancients delight much
in
making
use of to Youths, that follow their own false
and hot Imaginations
,
and will not heed
the cooler dictates of Age, Experience, and
Wisdom. Accordingly
I
wrote down to him
these Words, and left him in
a
seeming Pas
sion.
'
I
am very well afford, young Alan,
4
you think me, that am old, to be
a
Fool
;
but
'
/,
that am old, absolutely know you (who are
*
a
young fellow) to bea downright Fool
;
and
'
so
I
leave you to follow your own ways, till
4
fad and woful Experience teaches you to
1
know
it
your own self, and makes you come
'
to me, to own
it
of your own accord.' As
I
was going away, after this tart Admonition and
severe Reprimand,
I
had
a
Mind to observe
his Countenance, and
I
saw him smile
,•
which
I
rightly construed to be done
in
Contempt of
the Advice of Age, and in the Gaiety and Ful
ness of conceit
,
which Youth entertains of
its owtt'fond Opinions, and hair-brain'd ram
Refolves. He was got into the Company of
a
very pretty set of 'Gentlemen, whose For
tunes were far superior to his
;
but he follow'd
the fame genteel Exercises, as Fencing, <&c.
arid made one at all their Publick Entertain
ments
:
And -so; being at an equal Expence
with
of Mr. Duncan Campbell, xij
with those who could well afford to spend
what they did out of their Estates, he went
on very please ntly for a Time ; still if
and never getting ; without ever <
that it must, by inevitable Corrfeq;
to his Lot at last, to be entirely reduced to a
State of Indigence and Want. And what com
monly heightens the Misfortunes of fochMen,
(and so of all Gentlemen's younger Brothers,
who live upon the ready Money that is given
them for their Portions n
is,
that the Profile
rity they live
in
for
a
Time, gains them Credit
enough just to bring them in Debt, and ren
der them more miserable than those very
Wretches, who never had either any Money
or Credit at all. They run themselves into
Debt out of Shame
,
and to put off the evil
Day of appearing ruin'd Men as long cs they
can

and then when their Tempers are four

Lives
;
and then in
a
quarrel, they, or some
other Gentleman, may be,

run through
;
or else, being hunted by bailiffs, they exer
cise their Swords upon those Pursuers. Thus,
where Gentlemen will not consider their Cir
cumstances, their very Prosperity
is
a
Cause

;
their very
Pride (which was a decent Pride « first) m

savage Rage ; and all the fine, esteem'd-flou-
rishing and happy Gentleman, ends, and is
lost, in the contemn'd, poor and miserable
Desperado ; whose Portion at last is Confine
ment and a Gaol, and sometimes even worse,
and what I shall not so much as name here.
Into many of these Calamities Mr. Campbell
had brought himself before it was long, by
his Heedlesness, and running (according to the
wild dictates of Youth) counter to all found
and wholsome Advice. He had, it seems,
run himself into Debt ; and one Day, as he
was at a Coffee-House, the Sign of the Three
Crowns in Great Queenftreet , in rufh'd Four
Bailiffs upon him, who being directed by the
Creditors Wife, had watch'd him into that
House, and told him they had a Warrant a-
gainst him ; and upon his not answering, they
being unacquainted with his being deaf and
dumb, ofTcr'd to seize his sword. He start
led at their offering of Violence ; and taking
them for Rieffians, (which he had often met
with) repcll d the Aslaulters ; and drawing his
Sword, as one Man (more bold than the rest)
closed in with him, he fliorten'd his blade,
and, in the Fall , pinn'd the Fellow thro' the
Shoulder, and himself thro' the Leg, to the
Floor. After that he stood at Bay with all
the Four Officers, when the most mischievous
Aflailant of them all (the Creditors Wife)
ventur'd to step into the Fray, and very bar
barously took hold of that nameless Part; of
the
of Mr. Duncan Campbell, xij
the Man, f for which, as she was a married
Woman, Nature, methinks, should have taught
her to have a greater Tenderness ,0 and almost
(queez'd and crufh'd those Vitals to Death.
But at last he got free from them all, and was
going away as fast as he could, not knowing
what Consequences might ensue : But the
Woman, who aim'd her self at Committing
Murder, in the most savage and inhuman
manner, ran out after him, crying out Mur
der, Murder, as loud as (he could, and alarm
ed the whole Street. The Bailiff following
the Woman, and being bloody from Head to
Foot, by means of the Wound he receiv'd,
gave Credit to the Outcry. The late Earl Ri
vers s Footmen happening to be at the Door,
ran immediately to stop the luppos'd Mur
derer ; and they indeed did take him at last,
but perceiv'd their mistake, and discover d,
that instead of being Assistants in taking a
Man, whom they thought to be a Murderer,
endeavouring to make his Escape from the
Hands of Justice, they had only been trick'd
in by that false Cry, to be Adjutants to a Bar.
lifFin retaking a Gentleman, who by so gallant
a Defence, had rescued himself from the Dan
gers of a Prison ; and when they had disco
ver d this their mistake, they were mighty
sorry for what they had done. The most active
and busy among the Earl's Footmen, was a
Dutchman ; and the Earl happening to be
in a Room next the Street, and hearing the
P 4 Out
ti6 The Life and Adven¥ujI es
Outcry of Murder, steppdtotheWinddw.; and
seeing his own Servants in the Midst of the
Bustle, examin'd the Dutchman how the
Matter was : And being told it ; he chid the
Man, for being concern'd in stopping a Gen
tleman, that was getting free from such trou
blesome companions. But the Dutchman ex
cused himself like a Dutchman^ by making a
merry Blunder for a Reply.

said he to his Lord ; if I had thought they
' were Bailiffs , I would have fought for the
*
poor dumb Gentleman.; but then why had
(
not he told me they were bailiffs, my Lord ?
In short, Duncan Campbell w as carry d off
as their Prisoner j but the bailiff that was
wounded, was led back to the Coffee-Houfe,
where he pretended the Wound was mortal ;
and that he despair d of living an Hour. The
Proverb, however, was on the Fellows Side ;
and he recover d sooner than other People ex
pected he could. As soon as all Danger was
over, an Action for Damages' and Smart-Mo-
ney as their Term is) was brought against
Mr. Campbell ; the Damages were exaggera
ted, and the Demand was so extra vagant,that
Duncan Campbel was
neither able, just at that
time, nor willing, had he been able, to pay
fo much, as he thought, in his own Wrong,
and having no BailT and being afham'd to
make his case known to his better fort of
Friends, who were, both able and willing to
help him at a dead lift, he was hurry'd away
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 117
to Gaol by the BaylifFs, who sliew'd such a
malignant and insolent Pleasure, as commonly
attends powerful Revenge, when they put
him into the Marflialsea. There he lay in
Confinement six Weeks, till at last Four or
five of his chief Friends came by mere
chance to hear of it ; immediately they con
sulted about his Deliverance,and unanimously
resolved to contribute for his enlargement,
and they accordingly went cross the Water
together, and procured it out of Hand.
1 Two of his benefactors were Officers, and
were just then going over to Flanders. Dun
can Campbell, to whom they communicated
their Design, was resolved to try his Fortune
in a Military Way, out of a, roving kind of
Humour raised in him, partly by his having
taken a fort of Aversion to his own Profession
in Town, and partly, by his finding that he
could not live, without following a Profession
as he had done, any longer. He over a bot
tie frankly imparted his Mind to them at
large ; he signify d to them that he hoped,
since they had lately done him so great a Fa
vour, in freeing him from one Captivity, they
would not think him too urgent, if he press'd
for one Favour farther, upon Natures so ge
nerous as theirs, by whom he took as great
dis
pleasure in being obliged, as he could re
ceive
in
being capable of obliging others. He
wrote to them that the Favour he meant was
%o redeem him from another captivity, al-
.
-
most
ai8 The Life and Adventures
most as irksome to him, as that, out of which
they had lately ransom'd him. This Captivity,
continued he,
is,
being either sored to follow
my old Profession, which
I
have taken an en
tire Disgust to, for
a
Maintenance, or being
sored to live
in
a
narrower Way than suits
with my Genius, and the better Taste
I
have
of higher Life. Such
a
State, Gentlemen, you
know is more unpalatable than Half-Pay
;
it
is. like either being sored to go upon the for
lorn Hope, or else like
a
Man's being an entire
ly
casliier'd and broken Officer, that had no
younger Brother's Fortune, and no other Sup
port but his Commission. Thus though you
have set my Body at Liberty, my Soul
is
still
under an Imprisonment, and will be till
I
leave England, and can find means of visiting
Flanders, which
I
can do no otherwise than
hy the Advantage of having you for my Con
voy..
I
have
a
mighty longing to Experience
some part of
a
Military Life, and
I
fancy,
if
you will grant me your Interest, and intro
duce me to the valiant young Lord Lome.,
and be Spokes-men for
a
dumb Man,
I
shall
meet with
a
favourable Reception
;
and as
for you (Gentlemen) after having named that
great Patron and Pattern of Courage and
Conduct in the .Field,
I
cant doubt but the
very Name
I
bear^
if
you had not known me,
would have made you taken me for
a
Person
of
a
Military Genius, and that
I
should do
nothing but what would become
a
British
Sol
(^"JMr. DuncakCaii pbfll 219
Soldier and a Gentleman ; nothing in fine
that should make you repent the Recom
mendation.
These generous and gallant Friends of his,
it seems, comply'd with his Request, and pro-
mis'd they would make Application for him
to the Lord Ixrne ; and Duncan Campbell had
nothing to do but to get his Bag and Baggage
ready and provide himself with a Pass. His
Baggage was not very long getting together,
and he had it in tolerable good Order ; and
as for his Pass, a Brother of the Lord
Forbes was so kind, as to procure him one
upon the first Application Duncan made to
him.
Accordingly in a few Days afterwards they
went on Board, and having a speedy and an
easy Paslage, arrived soon ax Rotterdam. Dun
can met with some of his English Acquain
tance in that Town, and his Miud being pret
ty much bent upon rambling, and seeing all
the Curiosities, Customs, and Humours, he
could, in all the Foreign Places he was to pafe
thorough ; he- went out of a Frolick with
some Gentlemen, next Day, in a Boat to an
adjacent Village, to make merry over a home
ly Dutch Entertainment, the intended Repast
being to consist of what the Boors there count
a great Delicacy, brown Bread and white
Beer. He walk d out of fight from his Com
pany, and they lost one another ; and strolling
about by himself at an unseasonable Hour, as
they

no The Life and ADVErftuRES
they call it there after the Bell has toll'd,
Duncan Campbell, who neither knew their
Laws, nor if he had, was capable of being
guided by the notice which their Laws ordain,
was taken into Custody in the Village for that
Night, and carry'd away! the next Day to
tPilliatnflsd't; where he was taken for a Spy,
and put into a close Imprisonment for Three
or Four Days. > ■. . A S . •
But some Scots Gentlemen, who had been
in Company with Mr. Campbell at Mr. Cloy-
fierman's a Painter in Covent-Garden, made
their Application to the Magistrate, and got
him released : He knew his Friends the Of
ficers that carried him over were gone for
ward to the Camp, and that there was no
Hope of finding them at Rotterdam, if he
ftould go thither, and so he refolv'd since he
had had so many Days Paniihment in Wtl-
liam/ladt, to have Three or Four Days Plea
sure there too by way of Amends, before he
would ret otit on his journey after his Friends.
But on the Third N ght he got very much in
Drink ; and as he went Very boisterously and
disorderly along, a Centinel challeng'd him ;•
and the want of the Sense of Hearing had like
to have occasion'd the Loss of his Life. The
Centind fir d at him and narrowly mifs'd him';
He Was taken Prisoner, not without some Re
sistance, which was so far Innocent, as that
he knew not any Reason why he mould be
seized ;but very troublesome-and unwarranta

ble in so orderly a Town ; so the Governor s
Secretary, after the Matter was examined in
to, judging it better for the unhappy Gentle
man's future Safety, advis'd him to return
home to his own Country, and accordingly
bespoke him a Place in a Dutch ship called
Towsrow Catherine, for his PafTageto England.
Duncan Campbell had taken up his Hu
mour of rambling first, of his own accord,
and the Troubles which he had run himself
into by
it,
we may reasonably suppose, had
pretty well cured him of that extravagant
Itch
;
and there
is
little - doubt to be made,'
but that he rejoyc'd very heartily, when he
was got on Board the Ship to return to Eng
land
;
and that, in his new Resolutions, he
had reconciled himself to the prosecution of
his former Profession, and intended to set up
for
a
PrediBor again as soon as he could arrive
at London. But now Fortune had not
a
Mind
to let him go off
so
,•
he had had his own
Fancy for rambling, and now she was refolv'd
to have hers, and to give him his bellyful of
Caprice. Accordingly when the Dutch Ship
called Towsrow Catherine, was-making the best
of her Road for London, and each Person in
the Vessel was making merry, fill'd with the
hopes of
a
quick and prosperous Paflage
j
a

in
sight, crouding

them with all Haste and Diligence. The Pri

in comparison ; and the People on Board had
scarce time to think, and to deplore that they
should be made a Prey of before they actu
ally were so, and had Reason enough given
them for their Sorrow. All the Paslengers, to
a single Man, were stripped, and had French
Seamens Jackets in exchange for their
Cloaths. Duncan Campbell had now a Taste
given him of the Fate of War, as well as of
the Humour of travelling, and wiflVd himself
again, I warrant him, among his greatest
Croud of Confulters, as tiresome as he thought
Business to be, instead of being in the Middle
of a Crew of Sea-Savages. The Town, where
the Dumb Prisoner was at last consind, was
Denain. There happened to be some Englijh
Fryars there, who were told by the others
who he was, and to them he apply d himself
in Writing, and receiv'd from them a great
deal of civil Treatment. But a certain Man
of the Order of Recolle&s, happening to see
him there who had known him in England,
and what profession he followed, caused him
to be called in question as a Man that made
use of ill means to tell Fortunes. When he
was questioned by a whole Society of these
religious Men, he made them such pertinent
and satisfactory Answers in Writing, that he
convinced them he had done nothing for
which he deservd their Reprimand ; and they
unanimously acquitted him. The Heads of
his
of Mr. Dusrc ax Ca mfseliZ as*
his Defence, as I have been informed, were
there..
FieA He alkdg'd that the Sectmd-Sigbt was
in-born and in-bred in some men ; and that
every Country had had Examples of it more
or less ; bat that the Country of Scotland, m
which he was educated from an infant, a-
bounded the most of any with those sort of
People : And from thence he said he thought
he might very naturally draw this Conclu
sion, that a Faculty that was inborn and in
bred to Men, and grown almost a National
Faculty among a People who were remark
ably Honest, Upright, and well-meaning Peo
ple, could not, without some Impiety, be im
puted to the Postestbrs of it as a Sin. And
when one of the Fathers rejoin d, that it was
remark'd by several Writers of the Second
Sight, that it must be therefore Sinful, be
cause it remaind no longer among the People
when the doctrines of Christianity were stil
ly propagated, and the Light of the Gospel
increased among them ; and that afterwards
it affected none but Persons of vicious Lives
and an ill Character : To this objection Mr.
Campbell reply d, that he knew most (even
ingenious) Writers had made that Remark
concerning the Second-Sight, but begged leave
to be excused, if he ventured to declare, that
it was no better than a vulgar and common
Error ; and the Reasons were these which he
alledg d in his own Behalf, and to confirm his
Assertion,
%t^ The Life and Adventures
Assertion, he told them Men of undoubted
Probity, Virtue and Learning, both of their
own Religion, (via. the Roman Catholick)
and also of the Reformed Religion, and in seve
ral Nations had been affected, and continued
all their Lives to be affected, with this second-
fighting Power, and that there could be there
fore no room to fix upon it the odious Cha
racter of being a sinful and vicious (not to fay
that some cali'd it still worse, a diabolical J
Talent. He (aid he would content himself
with making but- two instances, because he
believ'd those Two would be enough to give
Content to them, his Judges too, in that
Case. In his first instance he told them that
they might find somewhat relating to this in
Wcolaus Hemingius, who in his Tract de Su-
perstitionibus Magicis, printed at Copenhagen,
Anno 1575, informs the World ;
" That Petrus
" Paladins, Bishop of Seelandt, and Profeslbr
u of Divinity at Copenhagen, could, from a
B
part of his Body affected, foretel from what
" part of the Heavens Tempests would come,
" and was seldom deceiv'd". One of the
Fathers immediately ask'd him , if he un
derstood Latin

—To this Duncan Campbell re-
ply'd no. Oh

Said the Fryar then,
I
don't re

English that you mention: — But rejoin

what I fay to be a Trutb.---For the second
instance, he told them, That in Spain there
are those they caMSaludadores^ that-haVe this
kind' of Gift. There1 was (continued Heisi
writing) one of your own religion, Vene
rable Fathers, and of a Religious Order, nayj
a Fryar too, that had this Gift : He was a
noted Dominican, said he ; and tho' I forget
his name, you may,- by writing a Letter to!
England, learnJhis name. V He was a deVout!
ed, belonging to Queen Catharine
Dowager's Chapel ; and had the Second-Sigbp
to a great-degree, and was famous and eminent
for kt They then ask'd him, what was the
full power he had to do by the Second-Sight ?
He answer
'3,'
that as they had intimated that
they had perased some of the skilful Wri
ters-concerning the Second-Sight, he did not
doubt but they had found (as well as he could
tell them'
J
that as to the Extent of Peopled

Combats, Manslaughters, &c. of all which,
there are many instances to be given. They
commonly foresee fad Events, a little while
before they happen. For Instance ; If a Man's
fatal End be Hanging, they'll fee a Gibbet, or
Rope about his Neck ; if Beheading, they'll
see a Man without a Head ; if drowning,
they'll see Water up to his Throat ; if Stab
bing, they'll see a Dagger in his Breast ; if un
expected Death in his Bed, they'll seeaWind-

only Marriages, but <*f good Children j what
kind of Life Men hall lead, and in what Con

Preferments, Peaces. Plenty, and good Fa
ther. It is likewise usual with persons that have
lost .any Thing, to go to some of these Men,
by whom they are directed how, with what
Person's, and some what place they shall find
their Goods. It is alfa to be noted, that these
Gifts bear a latitude, so that some have it in
a far more: eminent Degree than others. And

need not take as a truth from me, but as it
concerned me so nearly': I remember the Pas

in his demonology (2fc©£IH. and Chap, a.)
mentions also a Spirit caH'd Browne , that
was wont formerly to haunt divers Hordes,
without doing any Evil, but doing (as it
were) neceffery Turns up and down the
House. He appear d like a rough Man : Nay,
some belicv'd, that their House was all the
Sonfier, as they call d it j that is, the more
lucky or fortunate, that Inch Spirits resorted
there. With these Replies the Fryars began
to own they were very well (kisfy'd, and ac
quiesced in the Account fae had given of him*
self, as Ivery good, true, and honest Account.
But they told him, they had still a further Ac
cusation against rum ; and that was, that he
praclis'd Megick Arts ; and that he used, as
they had been inform'd, unlawful Incanta
tions. To this- he made Answer, That there
were two kinds of Magiclt ; of which, he
kneWj.they that were Men of Learning could
not be ignorant. The Art Magick, which is
wicked and impious, continued he, is that
which is prosds'd, and has been professed at
all Times in the World, by Witches, Magic
dans, Diviners, Inchanters, and such like no
torious Profligates ; who, by having an unna
tural Commerce with the Devil, do many
strange, prodigious, and preternatural Acts,
above and beyond all human wisdom : And
all the Arguments I ever did, or ever will de
duce (continued he) from that black Art, is a
Q, 2. good
128 , The Life Aid. A d v e tffr u r e s
good and a shining Argument.- It is this, O
Fathers : I draw a Reason from these prodi
gious practices of. Wizards, Magicians, In-
canters, &c. and from all the Heathen Ido
latry and Superstition, to prove, that there
is a Betty : For, from.these Acts of theirs, be
ing preternatural and above human wisdom,
we may consequently infer, that they proceed
from a supernaturabiand immaterial Cause,
luch as Damons are. Arid this is all the Know
ledge I ever did, or ever will draw from that
black, hellish Arti But (Fathers,) there is
another Kind of Art Magick, call'd Natural
Magick, which is directly opposite to theirs ;
and the object of which Art is to do spiritual
good to Mankind) as the object of theirs is
to torment them, and induce them to evil.
They afflict people with Torments ; and my
Art relieves them ■"
from the torments they
cause! . The^pubiick Profession of these Ma
gical Arts has (as you know, Fathers, tis a
common Distinction between Black and White
Magick,") been tolerated in some of the most
famous Universities of Christendom ; tho' af
terwards, for a very good Reason in Poli
ticks, making it a publick. Study to such a
degree, was very wisely retrenched by a Pro
hibition. If this therefore be a Fault in your
own' Opinions, hear my Accusers ; but if not^
you will not only excuse, but commend 'me.
The Fry ars. were, extreamly well pleased
with his Defence : But one of them had a
i -' c J Mind
of Mr. DuncanCampbbu. xz?
Mind to frighten him a 'little if he could, and
ask'd him, what he would say, if he could pro
duce some Witches lately feiz'd, that would
swear he had been frequently at their unlaw
ful Aslemblies, where they were making their
waxen images, and other odd mischievous
Inventions in Black Mdglck, to torment Folks?
What if I can produce such Evidence against
you, wrote the Father to ihim by way of
strengthening the Question ; will you not own
that we have convicted youthen ? And when
he had wrote the Note ,. he gave it Duncan
Campbell, with a Look that seemed to express
his Warmth and Earnestness in the Expostula
tion. Duncan Campbell took the Paper, and
read it ; and far from being startled, returned
this Answer, with a Smile continuing in his*
Face while he wrote it. " No, said he, Fathdrsy
" by your Leave, they will only prove me a
lf
good magician by that Oath, and themselves
f more plainly JVttche s. They will prove their
" Love to torment good folks, and only shew
" their Hatred to me an innocent man ; but
" wife enough to torment em, by hindring'em
" from tormenting others." The Fathers were
well pleas'd with the shrewdness of the An
swer : But Duncan Campbell had a Mind to
exert his Genius a little farther with the good
Fryar, who thought likewise he had put him
a very shrewd* Question : So taking up ano

a great Surprize, called for Pen, Ink and Pa

that this pretty: and gpofiUiatur;d; Widow,

miserataon of him by her looks, began to take
the Pen, and express it in verytefider Terms.
Neither did she think that . Expression in
Words a sufficient testimony of the Com
passion she bore to, him ; the Generosity of
her Mind led her to express it in a more sub
stantial Manner still, and that was to shew
it plainly by a very generous action. She
laid a. Purse of Twenty Guineas upon the
Table, and at the fame Time smiling, point
ed to the Gold,, as signifying her Desire that
he would accept.it ; and running to the Door,
dropped a Curt'sy, and.skuttled away : And by

he had been tasting nothing but the bitter
Draughts of Fortune before, must stir up an Af
fection, in a mind that had any sense of Grati
tude. Aftd thily just such; was the effect that
thisLady'sCivility had upon Mr. Duncan Camp
bell : He conceived from that Moment a very
great affection for her, and resolved to try
whether he could gain her ; which he had no
siriall Grounds to hope, from the Esteem which
they appear'd to bear towards him already. I
remember,' Mr. Dryden makes a very beauti
ful Observation, of the near Alliance there is
between the Two Passions of Pity and Love
in a Woman's Breast, in one of his Plays: His
Words are these :
For Pity siillforeruns approaching Love,

Wb.Bmyere, k most ingenious Member of the
French Academy, has made another remark,
which comes home to our present purpose. He
says, That many Women love their money bet
ter than their tr'iends,butyetvaktetheir Lovers
more than their Money. According to the two
reflections ofthese fine writers upon the Tem
pers of the Fair, Mr. Campbell had hopes e
noughs to ground his Courtship upon ; and it
appeared ib in the End by his proving Suc
cessful' ; ;
She from being a very liberal and
friendly client, became at last a most- Affe
ctionate Wife. He then began to be a House
keeper, and, accordingly took a little neat one, ;

and very commodious for his Profession, in
Monmouth-Court. Here I must take Leave to
make this observation ; That if Mr. Camp
bell inherited the talents of his Second sight
ed Mother, he seemed likewise to be an heir
to his Father, Mr. Archibald Campbell, both
in his strange and accidental sufferings by
Sea, and likewise in his being reliev'd from
them, after as accidental and strange a man
ner, by an unexpected Marriage, just like
his Father's. And here we return again, to
take a new Survey of him, in the course of
his publick Practice, as a predictor. The Ac
counts I shall give of his actions here, will be
Very various in their nature from any I have
yet presented to the Reader : They are more
mysterious in themselves ; and yet I fliall en
deavour to make the Manner of his operating
in this kind, as plain, as I think I have the
foregoing ones j and then I flatter my self,
they must afford a fresh Entertainment for"
every Reader, that has any curiosity, and
a good Taste for Things of so extraordinary
a Kind. For what I have all along pro
pounded to my self from the Beginning, and
in the Progress to the End of this History*
is, to interweave entertaining and surprizing
Narratives of what Mr, Campbell has done,
with curious arid instructive Enquiries into
the nature of those actions, for which he has
rendered himself so singularly famous. It was
not therefore suitable to my Purpose, to clog
R the
i4- ~tb* Life and A-d v e n t u r t s
the Reader with numerous Adventures, al
most all of the fame Kind ; but out of a vast
Number of them, to single some few of those
that were most remarkable, and that were
Mysteries, but Mysteries of very different forts.
I leave that Method of swelling distorted and
commented Trifles into Volumes, to the
Writers of Fable and Romance : If I was to
tell his Adventures with Regard , for Exam
ple, to Women that came to consult him j
I might, perhaps, have not only written the
Stories of Eleven Thousand Virgins that died
Maids, but have had Relations to give of as
many marry 'd Women and Widows ,♦ and the
Work would have been endless. All that I
mall do therefore, is to pick out one Particu
lar, each of a different Kind, that there may
be Variety in the Entertainment. Upon Ap
plication to this Dumb Man, one is told in
the Middle of her Health , that she shall die
at such a Time ; another, that she shall sicken,
and upon the Moment of her Recovery, have
a Suiter, and a Husband : A Third, who is a
celebrated Beauty, with a Multitude of Ad
mirers round about her ; that she shall never
become a Wife : A Fourth, that is marry 'd ;
when flie shall get rid of an uneasy Husband :
A Fifth, that hath lost her Goods ; who stole
them ; where and when they shall be resto
red : A Sixth, that is a Merchant ; when he
shall be undone ; and how and when he
shall recover his Losses, and be as great on
the
of Mr. Duncan Cam pbellI 243
the Exchange as ever : A Seventh, that is a>
Gamester ; which will be his winning, and
which .his losing Hour : An Eighth, how he
shall be involv a in a Law-Suit ; and whether
the Suit will have an adverse or a prosperous
Issue : A Ninth, that is a Woman, with
Choice of Lovers ; and who she shall be most
happy with for Life : And so on to many
others ; where every Prediction is perfectly
new and surprizing, and differs from the o-
ther in almost every Circumstance. When
a Man has so extensive a Genius as this at
foretelling the future Occurrences of Life*
"one Narrative of a Sort is enough in Con
science to present the Reader with ; and se
veral of each kind wpuld not (methinks) be
entertaining, but tiresome : For he that can
do one Thing in these Kinds by the Power
of Prediction , can do Ten Thousand : And
those who are obstinate iA extenuating his
Talents, and calling his Capacity in Question*
and that will not be convinc'd by one In
stance of his Judgment, would not own the
Conviction, if Ten Thousand Instances were
given them. The best Paslages I can recom
mend to their Perusal, are those, where Per
sons, who came purposely to banter him,
under the Colour of Consulting him, and
cover'd over their
fly
Intentions with bor
rows Disguizes, and came in Masquerades*
found all the Jest turn'd upon themselves in
the End, which they meant to our famous
R
% Pre-
Z44 The Life and Adventures
predictor ; and had the Discouragement of'
seeing their most conceal'd and deepest-laid
Plots discover'd , and all their most witty
Fetches and wily Contrivances defeated ; till
they were compell'd universally to acknow
ledge, that endeavouring to impose upon
the Judgment of our Seer, by any hidden
Artifice and Cunning whatsoever, was effe
ctually imposing upon their own. His unu
sual talent in this kind was so openly known,
and so generally cbnfefsd, that his Know
ledge was celebrated in some of the most
witty Weekly papers that ever appear'd in
Publick. Isaac Bickerjlaff, who diverted all
the BeauMonde for a long Space of Time with
his Lucubrations, takes Occasion in several of
his Papers, to applaud the Speculations of
this Dumb Gentleman, in an admirable vein
of pleasantry and Humour, peculiar to the
Writer, and to the subject he writ upon.
And when that bright Author, who join'd
the uttermost Facetiousnels with the most
solid Improvements of Morality and Learn
ing in his Works, laid aside the Title of a*
Tattler, and asiumed the Name of a Specta
tor, and Censor of Men's actions, he still
( every now and then) thought our Duncan
Campbell a subject worthy enough to em
ploy his farther Considerations upon. I must
take notice of one Letter sent concerning him
to the spectator, in the Year 171 z. (N '.

which was at a Time when a Lady wanted

But now let us come to those Passages of
his Life the most surprizing of all, during
the time that he enjoy'dthis Reputation, and
when he prov'd that he deserved the Fame
he enjoy 'd. Let us take a Survey of him
while he is wonderfully curing Persons laT
bouring under the Misfortune of Witchcraft;
:<of which the following Story will be an
eminent instance, and likewise clear up how
he came by his Reputation in Essex, as men
tioned in the above-mentioned Letter to the
Spectator.
In the Year 1709, Susanna Johnson,
Daughter to one Captain Johnson, who liv d
at a Place adjacent to Rumsord in Essex,
going one Morning to that Town to buy
Butter at the Market, was met there by an
old miserable looking Woman, just as she
had taken some of her Change of the Mar
ket-woman in Copper, and this old Woman,
rather demanded than begg'd the Gentle
woman to give her a Penny. Mrs. Johnson
reputing her to be one of those hateful People
that are calsd sturdy Beggars, refused it her,
as thinking it to be no Act of Charity, and,
that it would be rather gratifying and indulg
ing her Impudence, than supplying or sa
tisfying her Indigence. Upon the Refusal,
the old Hag with a Face more wrinkled Hill,
if poflible, by Anger than it was by Age,
took upon her to storm at young Mrs. John-
R 4

son

J48 The Life and Adventures
for very loudly, and to threaten andme^
nace her : But when she found her common
Threats and Menaces were of no avail, she
swore (he would be revenged of the young
Creature in so signal a manner, that (he
should repent the Denial of that Penny from
her Heart before she got home, and that it
should cost her many Pounds to get rid of
the Consequences of that Denial and her
Anger. The poor innocent Girl despised
these last Words likewise, and getting up on
Horseback return'd Homewards ; but just
as she got about half way her Horse stopp'd,
and no means that she could use would make
him advance one single Step ; but she staid
a while to see if that would humour him
to go on. At last the Beast began to grow
unruly, and snorted and trembled as if he had
seen or smelt something that frighted him,
and so fell a kicking desperately till he threw
the Girl from the Saddle, not being able to
cling to it any longer, tho' a pretty good
Horsewoman of her Years ,• so much were
the Horses Motions and Plungings more than
ordinarily violent.
As Providence would have it she got not
much harm by the Fall, receiving only a
little Bruise in the right Shoulder ; but she
was dreadfully frighted. This Fear added
Wings to her Feet, and brought her home
If Mr. Duncan Campbell 249
as speedily of her self as she usually came on
Horseback. She immediately, without any
other Sign of illness than the pallid Colour
with which Fear had disorder 'd the Com
plexion of her Face, alarm'd all the family
at home with the Story, took her Bed up
on
it,
complain'd of inward Rackings of the
Belly, and was never at ease unless the lay
doubled up together her Head to her knees,
and her Heels to her Rump, just like
a
Fi
gure of
8.
She could not be
a
single Mo
ment out of that Posture without shrieking
out with the violence of anxious Torments
and racking pains.
In this Condition of Misery, amidst this
Agony of Suffering, and in this double Po?
sture was the poor wretched young Gentle,
woman brought to Town
:
Physicians were
consulted about her but in vain
;
she was
carry
d
to different hospitals for Assistance,
but their Endeavours likewise prov'd ineffe
ctual. At last she was conducted to the Col-
'
lege of Physicians
;
and even the collective
wisdom of the greatest Sages and Adepts in
the Science of Physick was pos'd to give her
any Prescription that would do her Service,
and relieve her from the inexplicable Ma
lady me labour'd under. The poor incurable
Creature was one constant subject of he?
complaining Mother's Discourse
in
every com
pany (he came into.
Jt
happen'd at last, and ve-
>
a^o The Life and Adventures
ry providentially truly, that the Mother was
thus condoling the Misfortune of her Child
among five or fix Ladies, and telling them,
among other Things, that by the most skil
ful Persons stie was looked upon to be be
witch d, and that 'twas not within the power
of Physick to compass her Recovery : They
all having been acquainted with our Mr.
Duncan Campbell, unanimously advised her to
carry her Daughter to his House, and consult
with him about her. The Mother was over
joy'd at these Tidings, and purposed to let no
Time slip where her Child's Health was so
deeply concerned. She got the Ladies to go
with her and her Child, to be Eye-witnesses
of so extraordinary a Piece of Practice, and
so eminent a Tryal of Skill.
As soon as this dismal object was brought
into his Room, Mr. Duncan Campbell lifted
up her Head and look d earnestly in her Face,
and in less than a Minutes time signify d to
the Company, that she was not only be
witch d, but in as dreadful a Condition al
most as the Man that had a Legion of Fiends
within him.
At the reading of these Words the unhap
py Creature rais'd up her Head, turn'd her
Eyes upwards, and a Smile Ca Thing she
bad been a Stranger to for many Months)
overspread her whole Face, and such a kind
of Mr. Duncan Campbell/ 2.5T
of Colour asv is the fluming of Joy and
Gladness, and with an innocent Tone of
Voice she said, stie now had a firm belief she
should shortly be deliver d. The Mother and
the rest of the Company were all in Tears,
but Mr. Campbell wrote to them that they
should be of good Heart, be easy and quiet
for a few Moments, and they should be con
vinced that it was Witchcraft, but happily
convinced by seeing her so suddenly welt
again. This brought the Company into
pretty good Temper ; and a little after Mr.
Campbell desired stie might be led up stairs
into his Chamber and left there alone with
him for a little while ; this occasioned some
small Female Speculation, and as much Mirth
as their late Sorrow, alleviated with the hopes
of her Cure, would permit.
This you may be sure was but a snatch of
Mirth, just as the nature of the thing would
allow of ; and all forts of Waggery being
laid instantly aside, and remov'd almost as
soon as conceived, the poor young Thing was
carryed in that double Posture up Stairs. She
had not been much above half an Hour there,
when by the help only of Mr. Campbell's
Arm The was led down Stairs, and descended
into that Room full of Company as a Miracle
appearing in a Machine from above ; she was
led backward and forward in the Room,
while all gazed at her for a while with joy

ful Astonishment, for no Arrow was ever
more- strait than flie. Mr. Campbell then pre
vailed with her to drink a Glass of Wine, and
immediately after she evacuated Wind, which
they had not done for some Months before, and
found her self still more amended and easy ;
And then the Mother making Mr. Campbell
some small Acknowledgment at that time,
with the promise of more, and her Daugh
ter giving Thanks, and all the Company com
mending his Skill, took their Leave and de
parted with great Demonstrations ofJoy. I
shall here, to. cut the Story, short signify, that
she came frequently afterwards to make her
Testimonials of Gratitude to him, and con
tinues to enjoy her Health to this very Day
at Greentykh, where (he now lives, and will
at any time, if called upon, make Oath of
the Truth of this little history, as flie told
me her self with her own Mouth.
The next Thing therefore it behoves me
to do in this Chapter,
is,
to give some satis
factory Account of Magick, by which such
seeming mysterious Cures and Operations
are brought about.
This task
I
would perform
in
the most
perspicuous and most convincing manner
I
can
;
for Magick
I
know
is
held to be
a
very
hard and difficult Study by those Learned,
and universally unlawful and diabolical by
those unlearned, who believe there
is
such
a
Science
j -
.-
ofMr. Duncan Campbell? ij}
a Science attainable by Human Genius. On
the other Hand, by some Learned men, who
believe there is no con science, it is repre
sented as an inconsistent System of Supersti
tions and Chimeras ; and again laugh'd at as
such by the Unlearned, who are of an incre
dulous Temper : What I would therefore
undertake to do in this Place, is to shew the
Learned Men, who believe there is such an
Art, that the Attainment to a tolerable Know
ledge of the manner how magical practices
may be brought about, is no such difficult
Matter as they have represented it to them
selves ,• and by doing this, I shall make the
System of it jo plain, that while the Learn
ed approve of
it,
the Unlearned too, who
are not of an unbelieving Kind, may under
stand clearly what
I
fay
;
and the Learned
Men who have rejected this Science as Chi"
tnerical, may be clearly convinced
it
is
real
j
and then there
is
nothing left but obstinate
unbelieving Ignorance, which
I
shall not here
pretend by Arguments to lead into Sense,
but leave
it
to the work of Time, In fine,
I
will endeavour to induce Men of Sense to
say, that, what has been accounted mysteri
ous,
is
delivered in
a
plain, easy, and con
vincing manner, and to own that they ap
prove
;
while Men of the lower Class of Un
derstanding, shall confess and acknowledge
that they themselves understand
it,
and that
what
554 The Life and Adventures
<
what has hitherto been, represented as if
duous and difficult to a great Genius, is adap
ted and render'd not only clear, but familiar
to Persons of middling Talents. In this Work
therefore I shall follow the strictest Order I
can (which of all Things render a Discourse
upon any subject the most clear ; ) and that
it may be plain to the commonest Capacity,
I will first set down what Order I intend to
follow.
First, I will speak of Magick in general.
Secondly, Of Magick under its several Di
visions and Subdivisions.
Thirdly, concerning the object of the art,
as it is Good or Bad.
Fourthly, Of the Persons exercising that
Art in either Capacity of Good or Bad, and
by what means they become capacitated to
exercise it.
In the Fifth Place I shall come to the se
veral objections against the Art of Magick,
and the Refutation of those objections.
The first objection shall be against the Ex
istence of good and bad Spirits. The Refu
tation of which will consist in my proving
the Existences of Spirits both Good and Bad,
by Reason, and by Experience.
The second objection that will be brought,
is to contain an Allegation that there are no
such Persons as Witches now, and an Ar
gument to support that allegation, drawn
from the Incapacity and Impossibility of any
Things
V .<
os Mr. Duncan Campbell^, zfj
Thing's making (while it self is incarnate) a
contract with a Spirit. This objection will
be answer
'd,
by proving the Reality of Witches
from almost Universal Experience
;
and by
explaining rationally the Manner how the
Devils hold Commerce with Witches
:
Which
Explication
is
back'd, and authoriz'd,
by
the
Opinion of the most Eminent Divines, and
the most Learned Physicians.
From hence, Sixthly and Lastly
,
We
Shall conclude on the Side of the good Ma
gick, that as there are Witches on the one
hand, that may afflict and torment Persons
with Demons
;
so, on the other hand, there
are lawful and good Magicians, that may cast
out Damons from people that are poflefs'd
with them.
And, First, As to Magick in general
:
Ma
gick consists in the Spirit by Faith
;
for Faith
is
that Magnet of the Magicians
,
by
which they draw Spirits to them, and
by
which
Spirits they do great Things, that appear like
Miracles.
Secondly
,
Magick
is
divided into Three
Sorts
;
viz. Divine, Natural, zn&Diabolical.
And Natural Magick
is
again subdivided in
to Two Kinds, Simple and Compound
:
And
Natural Compound Magick
is
again likewise
divided into Two Kinds
;
viz. Natural Di
vine Magick, and Natural Diabolical Ma
gick.
Now
\$6 . The Life and Adventures
Now to give the Reader a clear, and a di
stinct Notion of each several Species of Mu
stek here raention'd, I set down the following
definitions. —Divine Magick is a Celestial Sci
ence, in which all Operations that are won
derfully brought about, are performed by
the Spirit of God.— Natural Magick is a
Science, in which all the mysterious acts
that are wrought, are compalsd by Natural
Spirits.- But as this Natural Magick may
be exercised about Things, either in a manner
indifferent in themselves, or mere morally
good, and then it is mere Natural Magick ;
or else about Things Theologically good, and
transeendently bad ; and then it is not mere
ly Natural Magicky but Mix'd and Com
pound. If Natural Magick be exercised a-
bout the most Holy Operations , it is then
mix'd with the Divine, and may then be cal
led Cnot improperly.) Natural Divine Magick.
But if Natural Magick troubles it self about
•compassing the wickedest Practices, then is
it promiscuous with the Demoniacal, and may
not improperly be called Natural Diabolical
'Magick.
Thirdly, The Object of this Art is doing
Wonders out of the ordinary appearing Course
of Nature, which tend either to great Good
or Bad, by the Help and Mediation of Spirits
good and bad.
Pourthlji
of Mr. Duncan' sPit" 257
'Fourthly, As to the Persons exercising that
Art in either way, whether good or bad, and
by what Means they become capacitated to
act it ; the Notion of this may be easily de
duced from the Notions of the Art it self,
as considered above in its each different Spe
cies : For as all Magick consists in a Spirit,
every Magician acts by a Spirit.
Divine Magicians, that are of God, are spo
ken of in Holy Writ ; and therefore I shall
not mention the Passages here, but pass them
over (as I ought in a book like this) with a
profound and reverential Silence , as well as
the other passages, which speak of natural
and Dœmoniacal Magicians ; and in all I shall
speak of them in this Place, I shall only
speak of them with Regard to Human Rea
son and Experience, and conclude this Head
with saying, That Natural Magicians work
play things by the Natural Spirits of the Ele
ments ; but that Witches and Dœmoniacal Ma
gicians , as Jannes and Jambres in Ægypt
were, work their Magical Performances by
the Spirit of Demons : And 'tis by the Means
of these different Spirits, that these diffe
rent Magicians perform their different Ope
rations.
These Things thus distinctly settled and ex
plains, 'tis now we must come and ground
the Dispute, between those who believe there
are no such Things as Magicians of any Kind,
S
'
and
158 The LieE and Adtentur.es
and those who assert there are of all the Kinds
above specify 'd.
Those who contend there are, have Re
course to Experience, and relate many well-
witnessd Narratives, to prove, that there have
been in all Times, and that there are Hill
Magicians of all these Kinds : But those, who
contend that there are no such Persons, will
give no Ear to what the others call plain Expe
rience : They call the Stories 0et whatever
Witnesses appear to justify them) either fabu
lous Legends, invented by the Authors, or
else Tricks of intellectual Legerdeniain, im
posed by the Actors, upon the Relators of
those Actions. Since therefore, they fay,
tho' the Believers in Magick brag of Expe
rience never so much , it may be but a fal
lible Experience ; they reasonably desire to
know, whether these Gentlemen that stand
for Magick, can answer the Objections which
they propose, to prove, that the Practice of
Magick, according to the System laid down,
is inconsistent with Reason, before they will
yield their Assent ? Let the Stories be never so
numerous, appear never so credible, these un
believing Gentlemen desire to be try'd by Rea
son, and aver till that Reason is given, they
will not be convinc'd by the Number of Sto
ries,- because, tho' numerous, they are Stories
still ; neither will they believe them, because
tliey appear credible : Because seeming so, is
not
of Mr. DuncanCampbell Z59
not being so ; and Appearances, tho' never
so fair, when they contradict Reason, are not
to be swallowed down with an implicit Faith
as
Ger
many Realities. And thus far, no doubt*
the Gentlemen, who are on the unbelieving
Side, are very much in the right on't. The
learned gentlemen, on the other hand, who
are persuaded of this mighty mysterious Pow
er being lodged in the hands of magicians,
answer, That they will take upon them to re
fute the most subtle objections, brought by
the learned Unbelievers, and to reconcile the
'Practicability of Magical Mysteries by the Ca
pacity of Men, who study that Art, to right
Rules and Laws of Reasoning
;
and to shew,
that some Stories (tho' never
so
prodigi
ous
J
which are told of Magicians, demand"
the Belief of Wise Men on Two Accounts
:
Because^ as Experience backs Reason on the
one hand, Reason backs Experience on the
other
;
and
so
the issue of the whole Argu
ment ("whether there are magicians or not)
is
thrown upon both Experience and Reason.
These arguments on each Side,
I
shall draw
up fairly Pro and Con
;
for

into a kind of a Judge : I will sum up the
evidence on both sides ; and I shall, where-
ever I see Occasion, intimate which Side of
the Argument bears the most Weight with
me. But when I have enforc'd my Opinion
as far as I think needful, my Readers (like a
Jury) are still at Liberty to bring in their Ver
dict, just as they themselves shall fee fit. And
this naturally leads me , where I promised to
come to in the Fifth Part of this Discourse, to
the several objections against the Power of
Art Magick, and the Refutation of those Ob
jections.
The First Ohje&ion being againjl the Exi
stence of Spirits, and the Refutations
thereof.
TH
E First Objection, which they who
reject Magick make use of, is, deny
ing that there are any such Things as Spirits ;
about which, since those who defend the
Art, fay it entirely exerciseth it self, the Ob
jectors contend, That if they can make out
that there are no such Beings as Spirits, all
pretensions to the Art must be entirely ground
less, and for the future exploded.
To make this Part out, that there are no
Spirits ; the first Man they produce on their
Side, is undoubtedly one of very great Cre
dit and Authority, inasmuch as he has justly
born for many centuries the Title of the
Prince
of Mr. DuncanCampbell z6t
Prince of Philosophers. They fay, that Aristo
tle, in his Book deMundo, reasons thus against
the Existence of Spirits ; via.' .'That since God
f can do all Things of himself, he doth not
1
stand in need of Ministering Angels and Da-
' mons : A Multitude of Servants shewing
f the Weakness of a Prince.
The Gentlemen who defend the science,
make this reply : They allow the Credit and
Authority of Aristotle, as much as the Ob
jectors ,• but as the objectors themselves de
ny all the Authorities for the Spirits, and de
sire that Reason may be the only Ground
they go upon, so the refuters, on their Parts,
desire, that Ariftotle's—ipse dixit may not be
absolutely pafs'd upon them for Argument ;
but that his Words may be brought to the
fame Touchstone of Reason, and prov'd if
they are Standard. If this Argument, fay
they, will hold good, Aristotle should not
suppose Intelligences moving the Celestial
Spheres ; for God sufficeth to move all with
out Ministring Spirits ; nor would there be
need of a Sun in the World, for God can
enlighten all Things by himself ; and so all
Second Causes were to be taken away : There
fore there are Angels and Ministring Spirits
in the World, for the Majesty of God, not
for his Want of them j and for Order, not
for his Omnipotency. And here, if the Ob
jectors return, and fay, Who told you that
there are Spirits 3 Is not yours a precarious
S 3 Hjrpo-
z6z The Life and Apventub.es
Hypothesis i Mayn't we have Leave to recri
minate in this Place >
Pray, who told Aristo
tle, that there were Intelligences that mov'd
the Celestial Spheres ? Is not this Hypothesis
as precarious , as any Man may pretend that
of Spirits to be ? And we believe there are
few Philosophers at present, who agree with
Aristotle in that Opinion : And we dare pro
nounce this to be ours, that Aristotle took his
Intelligences from the Hebrews, who went
according to the fame whimsical (tho' pretty)
'Notion, which first gave Rife to the fiction
of the Nine Muses. But more than all this, it
is a very great Doubt among learned Men, whe
ther this Book, De Mundo, be Aristotle 's or no.
The next Thing the Objectors bring a
gainst the Existence of Spirits,
is,
That
it
is
Nonsense for Men to say; that there are
such Beings, of whichTit
is
impossible for
a
Man to have any Notion
;
and they insist up
on
it,
that
it
is
impossible for any man to form
an Idea of
a
Spiritual Substance. As to this
Part, the Defendants rejoin, That they think
our late most judicious Mr. Locke, in his ela
borate and finifh'd Essay on Human Under
standing, has fairly made out, that men have as-
clear
a
Notion of a Spiritual Substance, as they
have of any corporeal Substance, Matter, or
Body
;
and that there
is
as much Reason for
admitting the existence of the one, as of the
other
;
for that
if
they admit the lattery
it
is
but Humour
in
them to deny the former. It
is
pfMr. Duncan Campbell 265
is in his second Book, Chap.zy. where he rea
sons thus :
" If a Man will examine himself,
concerning his Notion of pure substance in
general, he will find he has no other idea of
it, but only a supposition of he knows not
what Support, of such qualities which are ca
pable of producing simple Ideas in us; which
Qualities are, commonly, called accidents.
Thus
if;
we talk or think of any particular
Sort of Corporeal Substance, as Horse, Stone,
&c. tho' the Idea we have of either of them
be but the Complication or collection of
those several simple Ideas, or sensible Quali
ties, which we use to find united in the Thing
call'd Horse or Stone
;
yet because we can
not conceive how they should subsist alone
not in one another, we suppose them to ex
ist in, and be supported by some common Sub
ject
;
which Support we denote by the Name
of Substance
;
tho'
it
be certain, we have no
clear or distinct Idea of that Thing we sup
pose
a
Support. The lame happens concern
ing the Operations of our Mind, viz. Think
ing, Reasoning, and Fearing, &c. which we
concluded not to subsist of themselves, and
not apprehending how they can' belong to
Body
;
we are apt to think these the Acti
ons of some substance, which we call Spirit:
Whereby it's evident, that having no other
Notion of Matter, but something, wherein
those many sensible qualities, which affect our
senses, do subsist, by supposing
a
Substance,
S
4
where
i^4 The Life and Adv e ntur.es
wherein Thinking, knowing, doubting, and a
Power of Moving, &c. do subsist ; we have as
clear a notion of the Nature or Substance of
Spirit, as we have of Body ; the one being
supposed to be, without knowing what is
the Substratum to those simple ideas which
we have from without, and the other supposed
( with a like Ignorance of what it is ) to be
the substratum of these Operations which we
experiment in our selves within. Tis plain,
then, that the Idea of Corporeal Substance
in Matter, is as remote from our Concepti
ons and Apprehensions, as that of Spiritual
Substance ; and therefore, from our not having
any Notion of the Substance of Spirit, we can
no more conclude its Non-Existence, than we
can for the fame Reason deny the Existence
of Body ; it being as rational to affirm there
is no Body, because we cannot know its Es
sence, as it is called, or have the Idea of the
Substance of Matter, as to fay, there is no
Spirit, because we know not its Essence, or
have no Idea of a Spiritual Substance." Mr.
Locke also, comparing our Idea of Spirit with
our Idea of Body, thinks there may seem ra-
ther less Obscurity in the former than the
latter. Our Idea of Body, he takes to be
an extended solid substance, capable of com
municating Motion by Impulse I and our Idea
of Soul is a Substance that thinks, and has a
Power of exciting Motion in Body, by Will
or Thought. Now, some perhaps will fay,
they
of Mr. Duncan Campbell z£j
they comprehend a thinking Thing which
perhaps is true ; but, he lays, if they con
sider it well, they can no more comprehend
an extended Thing ; and if they lay, they
know not what it is thinks in them, they
mean they know not what the substance is
of that thinking Thing ; no more, lays he,
do they know what the substance is of that
solid Thing ; and if they fay, they know
not how they think, he lays, neither do
they know how they are extended, how the
solid Parts are united, or where to make Ex
tension, &c.
The learned Monsieur U CUrt, who gene
rally knows how far human Reason can bear,
argues consonantly to what is before deliver d
by Mr. Locke in his Coronis, added to the
Fourth Volume of his Philosophical Works,
in the third Edition ofthem, where he writes
as followeth.
When we contemplate the corporeal Na
ture, we can fee nothing in it but Exten
sion, Divisibility, Solidity, Mobility, and va
rious Determinations of Quantity or figure, >
which being so, it were a ralh Thing, and
contrary to the Laws of right Reasoning, to
affirm other Things of Bodies ; and conse
quently from mere Body, nothing can be
deduced by us, which is not joined in a nc-
ceslary Connexion with the laid Propcrtic* :
Therefore those, who have tlionglit the Pro
perties
x66 The Life and Adventure s
perries of perceiving by sense, of under
standing, Willing, Imagining, remembering,
and others the like, which have no Affinity
with corporeal Things,to have risen from the
Body, have greatly transgressed in the Me
thod of right Reasoning and Philosophising,
which hath been done by Epicurus, and
those, who have thought as he' did, having
affirmed our Minds to be composed of cor
poreal Atoms : But whence shall we fay they
have had their rifle ? Truly, they do not
owe their Rife to Matter which is wholly
destitute. of Sense and Thought, nor are they
spontaneously sprung up from nothing, it
being an ontological Maxim . of most evident
Truth, that nothing springs from nothing.
Having thus given the reader the primary
objections made against the Existence of
Spirits, and the refutations thereof, I must
now frankly own on which side my opinion*
leans, and for my Part, it seems manifest to
me that 'there are two beings, we conceive
very plainly and distinctly, viz. Body and
Spirits and that it would be as absurd and
ridiculous to deny the existence of the one;
as of the other : And really, if the refuters
have got the better in their way of Rea
soning, they have still a much greater Ad
vantage over the objectors, "when they come
to back these Reasons with fresh arguments*
drawn from Experience, Of this, there ha
■
ving
of Mr. Duncan Campbell^ x6j
ving been many undoubted Narratives given
in the foregoing Pages, concerning the Ap
paritions of Spirits, I shall refer the Reader
back again to them, and only subjoin here
one or two instances, which may, if re
quired, be proved upon Oath, of Spirits
seen by two Persons of our Duncan Campbell's
own Acquaintance. In the year; 17 ii, one
Mrs. Stephens, and her daughter, were to
gether with Mr. Campbells at the House of
Mr. Ramell's, a very great and noted Weaver
at Haggerftone, where the rainy Weather de
tained them till late at night. Just after the
Clock struck twelve, they aJlof. them went
to the Door to fee if the Rain had ceased,
being extreamly desirous to get home. A£
soon as ever they had opened, the Door and
were all got together, there appeared before
them a Thing all in White, the Face seemed
of a dismal pallid Hue, but the Eyes thereof
fiery and flaming like Beacons, and of a
saweer Size. It made its Approaches to
them, till it came up within the Space
of about three Yards of them, there it fixt
and stood like a Figure agaze for some Mi
nutes ; and they all stood likewise stiff like
the Figure, frozen with Fear, Motionless, and
Speechless : When all of a sudden it vanifh'd
from their Eyes ; and that Apparition to the
Sight was succeeded by a Noise, or the Ap
pearance of a Noise like that which is occa-
• - sioned
•
268 The Life and Adventures
sioned by the Fighting of twenty MastiffDogs.
Not long after, Mrs. Anne Stephens, who
lived in Spittlefields, a Woman well known
by her great Dealings with Mercers upon
Ludgate-Hill, fitting in her House alone, and
. musing upon Business, happened by Accident
to look behind her, and (aw a dead Corps, to
her thinking, lie extended upon the Floor,
just as a dead Corps should be, excepting
that the Foot of one Leg was fix'd on the
Ground as it is in a Bed, when one lies with
one Knee up ; she looked at it a long while,
and by degrees at last stole her Eyes from so
unpleasing and unexpected an Object. How
ever, a strange kind of a curiosity overcome
her Fears, and (he ventured a second Time to
turn her Head that Way, and saw it as before,
fix'd for a considerable time longer, but
durst not stir from her Seat ; she again with
drew her Eyes from the horrible and melan
choly spectacle, and resumed the Courage,
after a little Reflection, of viewing it again,
and resolving to ascertain her self if the Vi
sion was real, by getting up from her Seat
and going to
it,
but upon this third Retro
spection lhe found
it
vanish
d.
This Relation
she writ down to Mr. Duncan Campbell, and
has told before Mrs. Ramell, her own Sister,
and many other very creditable Persons. Now
as to these Arguments from Experience,
I
shall also deliver my opinion.
I
dispute not
but that Learned Men, who have obstinate
Prepos-
of Mr. Duncan Campbell" 169
Prepossessions, may produce- plausible Argu
ments, why all Things should be thought to
be done by imposture which Teem strange to
them, and interfere with their Belief; and
truly thus far their Humour may be indulged,
that if only one Person relates a very strange
and surprizing Story, a Man may be more
apt to think it is possible for that Person to liey
than that so firange a relation should be
true ; but if a considerable Number of Per
sons of several Countries, several religions,
several Professions, several ages, and those
Persons look'd upon to be of as great Saga
city as any the Country afford, agree in Re
lations of the fame Kind, tho' very strange,
and are ready to vouch the Truth of
them upon Oath after having well con
sidered Circumstances ; I think it a Vio
lation of the Law of Nature to reject all
these Relations as fabulous, merely upon a
self-presuming Conceit; unless a man can fair
ly shew the Things to be impossible, or can
demonstrate wherein those Persons were im
posed on ; for, from hence I form (the fol
lowing conclusive Argument. What is pos
sible according to Reason grows probable ac
cording, to Belief, where the possibility is
attested to have reduced it self into action
by Persons of known Credit and integrity.
Now, not only the possibility of the Ex
istence of Spirits, but the actual Existence
thereof is proved above by Logical Demon
stration i
.•
470 The Life and Adventures
stration ; therefore are we to believe both by
the Course of Logical Reason, and Moral
Faith, that those Existences have appeared to
Men of Credit, who have attested the Re
ality thereof upon Oath. f
The Second ObjeSion against the Existence
os Witches.
THESE
Objectors go on to fay, that
provided they should allow there is
an Existence of Spirits, yet that would be
still no Argument how Magick should subsist*
because they deny that it is possible for a
Man in his Body to have a Commerce, much
less make a contract with Spirits. But here
again the Resuters alledge they have both
experience and Reason on their Sides. As
a joint Argument of Reason and Experience,
they tell you, that the numerous Witches
which have in all Countries been arraigned
and condemned upon this Occasion, are evi
dent Testimonies of this Commerce and
Contract being held and made with Spirits*
They pretend to fay, that these objectors
call not (theirJ the Refusers Judgment so
much in question, who contend that there
is a Magick Art, as they call in question the
judgment of all the wisest Legislative Powers
in Christendom, who have universally agreed
in enacting penal Laws against such capital
offenders.
But
•
of Mr. Duncan Campbell zyi
But here the Objectors return and fay, that
it being impossible for us to mew the manner
how iucli-a Contract should be made, we can
never, but without Reason, believe a Thing
to be, of which we can form no perfect
Idea. The Refusers, on the other Hand, re
ply with the learned Father le Brune ; it is
manifest, that we can fee but two Sorts of
beings^ Spirits and Bodies, and that since we
can reason but according to our own Ideas,
we ought to ascribe to Spirits what cannot be
produced by Bodies. Indeed, the Author of
the . Nouvel/es de la Republique des Lettres,
for the Month of August, Anno i6%6, has
given us a rough Draught for writing a good
Tract of Witchcraft, which he looks upon
as a desideratum, Where among other Things
he writes thus j Since this Age is the true
time of Systems, one should be contriv'd
concerning the Commerce that may be be
twixt Dæmons and Men.
On this Paslage, Father le Brune writes
thus, " Doubtless here the Author complies
with the Language of a great many Persons*
who, for want of Attention and Light, would
have us put all Religion into Systems. What
ever Regard I ought to have for many of
those Persons, I must not be afraid to fly,
that there is no System to be made of those
truths, which we ought to learn distinctly .
by Faith, because we must advance nothing
here,
s
»7» The Life and Adventures
here, but what we receive from the Oracle."
We must make a System to explain the Ef
fects of the Loadstone, the Ebbing and Flow
ing of the Sea, the Motion of the Planets ;
for that the Cause of these effects is not evi
dently signified to us, and many may be con
ceived by us ; and to determine us, we have
need of a great Number of Observations,
which, by an exact Induction, may lead us to
a Cause that may satisfy all the Pbaenomena.
It is not the fame in the Truths of Religion,
we come not at them by groping, it were
to be wisiYd Men spoke not of them, but
after a decisive and infallible Authority. It is
thus we should speak of the Power of De
mons, and of the Commerce they have with
Men ; it is of Faith that they have Power, and
that they attack Men, and try to seduce them
divers Ways. It is true indeed, they are
sometimes permitted to have it over the Just,
tho' they have knot ordinarily, but over those
that want Faith, or Fear, not to partake of
their Works ; and that to the last particular
ly, the disordered Intelligences try to make
exactly succeed what they wish ; inspiring
them to have Recourse to certain practices by
which those seducing Spirits enter into Com
merce with Men. Thus far Father le Brune.
But still these objectors demand to know, by
what Means this Commerce may be held be
tween Dæmons and Men, and urge us to de
scribe the Manner ; or pretend that they have
still
of Mr. Duncan' sPBfeiLi ty%'
still Reason to refuse coming into the belief
of a Thing, which we would impose upon
them, tho' wholly ignorant of it our selves.
To that, the Refuters answer thus : That both
Christian Divines and Physicians agree,' (as
to the Manner how, which they are so curi
ous in enquiring after J) that Dam&ns stir up
Rapture* and Pastes in Men, binding or
loosing the exterior'Senses 5 and that either by
stopping the PoreS'O'f the Brain, so that the
spirits cannot pass forth, -
fas it is done natu-
rally asleep J or by recalling the sensitive
Spirits,/ /from the outward Senses to the in
ward organs, which he rliere retains : So the
Devil renders Sextatical and
magicians; who, while they lie fast asleep
in;
one Plade, think they have been in divers Pla
ces, and done many Things. This, the learned
Objectors lay, proceeds from no Damon, but
from the Disease call'd an Epilepsy. But, on
the other hand, the-rnore learned Refuters
insist updnk, that 'these tsare not £pi~
leptick seizures
:
This, fay they, appears from
Bodin, in his Theatre
of
Universal Nature
;
where he fays,
" That those that are wrapt
" by the Devil, fees neither .Stripes norCut-
*
tings, /nor no Westing of their limbs, nor
K
burning- Tortures, hor the Application of

x74 The Life and Adventures
" of the Wounds receiv'd, and tell of Things
" done at Six Hundred Miles distance, and af-
" firm themselves to have seen them done."
The ingenious Dr. Ader makes an admirable
Physical Distinction between this Kind of Ex-
tajy , and a syncope, or Stupor, caused by
Narcotick Medicines. Sennertus, in his In-
jlitutio Mediai, writes of the Demoniacal So
por of Witches, who think they are carry d
thro' the Air, dance, feast, and have Copula
tion with the Devil, and do other Things in
their Sleep ; and afterwards believe the lame
things waking. Now, he fays,
" Whether
" they are really so carry 'd in the Air, &c. or
*'
being in a profound Sleep, or only dream
" they are so carry d, and persist in that Opi-
**
nion after they are awake ; these facts or
" Drearqs, cannot be natural : For it cannot
" be, that there should be so great an Agree-
" ment in Dreams , of Persons differing in
" Place, Temperament, Age, Sex, and Stu-
" dies, that in one Night, and at the fame
" Hour, they should, in Concert, dream of
" one and the fame such Meeting ; and should
" agree as to the Place, number, and Qua-
" lity of the Persons, and the like Circura-
" stances : But such Dreams are suggested
" from a preternatural cause, viz. from the
" Devil to his Confederate, by the Divine
" Permission of an Almighty Power , where
" Punishments are to be permitted to be jn-
" flicted upon reprobate Sinners.
Whence
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. 175"
Whence also, to those Witches sincerely
converted, and refusing to be any more pre
lent at those diabolical Meetings, those Dreams
no longer happen ; which is a Proof that they
proceeded, not before, from a natural Cause.
Here begins the great Point of the Dispute,
as to that Branch of Magick , which we call
Natural Magick. The Objectors may tell us,
that they will freely own, that there may
be an Existence of Spirits j that there may
be an Existence of Witches ; that by a divine
Power, Men may be influenc'd so far, as to
have a Communication with good Spirits, and
that from thence they may become spiritual,
divine Magicians. They will likewise, perhaps,
as freely grant, that by the Intervention of a
Damon, Things preternatural may be brought
about by Persons who have studied the D<e-
moniacal Magick ; but then, what they prin
cipally insist upon ,
is,
that
it
must be con
tradictory to all Human Reason to imagine,
that there can be such
a
Thing as Natural
Magicians
:
And thus far they may form their
argument. They (ay, that the Persons who
contend for the Magick Art, own, that all
that
is
brought about
by
Magick,
is
by the
Assistance and Help of
a
Spirit
;
and that
consequently, what
is
effected by
it,
must be
preternatural. Now, fay they,
it
is
a
Thing
inconsistent by
a
Natural Power, to bring
about
a
preternatural Effect
;
therefore, there
T
t
t
can
276 The Life and A d v e tq tr.tiR. E&
can be no such Thing as Natural Magick,
which has within it self the Efficacy of de
stroying those acts done by magicians, in the
Diabolical. :. ,.•;.;..
To this, the Refuters take Leave to reply,
That the foundation upon which the Argu
ment is built, is wrong grounded::. They have
admitted, that in Diabolical Art'J&agkk, there
may be a Commence held between Men and
Spirits, by which several after effects
may be brought about : And the Reason they
assign for it there,
is,
Because there
is
a
pre
ternatural Agertt concern
'd
therein^ the Devil
:
But then, fay they,
in
Natural Magick, you
can pretend to no such agent, and there
fore to no such preternatural effect. This
argument contains within itTwo Ealhcies
:
first, As to the Commerce" held between
a
Man and
a
Damon, there
is
nothing pre
ternatural
in
getting the Acquaintance
:
The
Will of the man
is
entirely natural ; either
naturally good, -or" naturally corrupted. The
black spirit that ConVerseth with him,
it
is
acknowledge
is
not
so
;
but
it
is
from the
Will of the man, not from the Power vested
in
thcDevil, thatthe'Acquaintance first grows,
therefore die Acquaintance
it-
(elf is natural,
tho' it arises from the last Corruption and De
pravations of NattJre
,•
but being made with
•
ar preternatural Existence, tho' the Cause of
the Acquaintance be corruptedly natural, yet
the intermediate Cause -or Means after that
Acquain-
4
os Mr. Duncan Campbell? zyf
Acquaintance is not so, and thereforejthe Ef
fect of that intermediate Cause may be woii-
derful, and seem to be out of the ordinary
Course of Nature. Now, since it is gene
rally allow'd, that there are Natural Spirits
of the Elements, as well as Divine and In
fernal ; what we haVe to prove , is only
this ; That Man, by Natural Magick, may
have a Commerce with Natural Spirits of their
Elements, as Witches may have with the
Spirits, ox Dæmons. Now, 'as we said before,
the Commerce it self depends upon the Will
of the Person, and is therefore natural, and
consequently may as well subsist between the
one as the other ; for the Devil cannot force
a. Man to hold a Commerce with him whe
ther he will or no. The: Second Fallacy
is,
calling the Effect preternatural
,
no other
wise than as
it
connotates the Agent that
brought
it
about, which
is
a
spiritual Agent!:
For the Effect
is
(in
it
self confider'd) natural,
and brought about by Second Causes that are
natural
;
by
the Devil's Penetration,' who
fe
subtle enough to make use of them for such,
and such Ends. Now Men* by Natural Spi
rits, which are of
a
Faculty thoroughly' sub
tle, may as well with Natural Second Causes
compass the Remedy of an Evil Spirit, as the
Devil
is
able to infect Men with it. From
these Speculations,
a
farther plain Consequence
may be dedue'd, How
a
Man may, by the pure
Force of Natural Magick, cure
a
Person that
T
5
is
xyS The Life and Adventur es
is infested with Evils by a Damon : For how
is
it,
that
a
Damon infests any body with his
evil Motions
?
It
is
true, he
is
a
preternatural A-
gent
;
but the evil effect he does,
is
brought
about
by
Natural Causes. For how does
a
D<«-
mon stir up Raptures or Extafics
in
Men
?
Why,
he docs
it
(as we are told above
)
by
bind
ing or loosing the Exterior Senses, by stop
ping the Pores of the Brain,
so
that the Spi
rits cannot pals forth
:
And this the Art of
Ph) sick can compass by its Drugs
j
and Sleep
causes the fame Thing very naturally of
it
self:
Therefore as the Evil
it
self
is
natural, the Re
medy, that
is
natural, will certainly over
come it. But then, fay you, why can't those
Persons be cur
d
by Physicians
?
I
answer
;
Not because their Remedies are not in them
selves sufficient to cure the Evils themselves
;
but because, generally, Physicians don't ad
minister their Drugs as Christians, but as Phy
sicians
;
and when they prescribe them to the
Sick, they generally prescribe to them only,
purely considers as Patients, not as Christians
;
and therein they come to fail
:
Because the
Agent, the Devil,
is
a
subtle Spirit, that brings
the Evil, and alters its Situation before the
Remedy (which would master
it
otherwise
can take any effect
:
Which Agent, the Devil,
is

the horrible and impious Faith
of the Anti-Physician, viz* the black Magi

if
the physician would act the Chri
stian, at the fame Time,

Faith
of Mr. Duncan Ca mpb el l. z79
Faith that Things ordain'd in the Course of
Nature, for the Good of Man, would have
its effects in Spite of a Devil, if taken with
a good Faith by the Patient : That all good
things, ordain'd to be for the natural Re
covery of Men, if they took it with Thank
fulness to the Sender, would have due effect :
Why then the Natural Spirits of the Elements
would resist the farther Agency of the De
moniacal Spirit ; and then nothing but the
Natural Evil (caused at first by the Damon)
remaining in the Person, without the farther
Superintendency of the Demon , might de
monstratively be taken away by the mere na
tural Remedy or Medicine. And thus good
and pious Physicians, making use of such pro
per Remedies as their Skill teaches them, and
having an honest Faith, that the Goods of
Nature, (intended for the Use and Benefit of
Man) if receiv'd by the Patient with the same .
Good Faith, is above the Power of the Devil to
frustrate, may not improperly be called Natu
ral Magicians. These Arguments of mine, I
shall now take Leave to back by experience.
Besides what we have urged from Rea
son, concerning the power of natural Ma-
gick, we shall only subjoin, that divines
themselves hold that Natural-Magick , and
also Natural-Divinations and Prophecies , are
proved by quotations from that Venerable
Writ which is their Guide ; and bring Proofs
from the lame also, that by Natural Magick ,
i : T 4 Dæmon t
a8o The Life and Act e ktur.es
Damons are also cast forth, but not all kinds
of Damons , and so many Works of Effica
cy are wrought by Natural Magick : They
tell you, such was the Pjtbonissa, that raised
the Apparition to Sod, which appear d in
a Body of Wind and Air. Thus, if a Per
son, by Natural Magick, should cast out Da-
rnons ; it does not follow, that this was also
from Divine Magick : And if Damons are
cast out by Natural Magick, by one that is
in the Fear of God, it does not follow, that
he is a true Magician of God ; but if it exor-
bitates to Damoniacaly then it is condemn'd.
And when Natural Magick keeps within its
Bounds, the Divines tell us, it is not con
demn'd in the Venerable Book which is the
Christians sure Guide. But in as much as the
Lawfulness even of Natural Magick has been
call d in Question by others, I shall, in an Ap-
pendix jpih'd to this Treatise , examine that
Matter, both according to the Reasons of our
English Laws, and according to the best stated
Rules of Casuistry that I am Master of ;
still submitting my judgment to the superior
judgment of those who are profefs'd Divines
and Lawyers : And if my opinions prove
erroneous, I am willing to retract them. And
therefore, in this Place, there remains nothing
farther for me to do, but only, as Ihave
shewn, on the one hand, how natural Ma
gick, and its powerful Operations, are prov d
by Reason ; to shew, on the other hand, how
• :-^ '• ■*
is

far Reason in these Cases, is likewise back'd
and supported by well-evidenc d Practice,and
notorious Experience. And to do this, after
having mentioned one memorable Instance,
which I refer the Reader to in the Body of
the Book, concerning the Performances of
Mr. Greatrix, to which the Lord Orrery was
a Witness in Ireland ; I shall, to avoid Pro^
lixity, bring the other Testimonials of Pra-*
ctice, from the Success which our Duncan
Campbell himself has had in this Way on
other Occasions. • •

In the Year 1 7 1
3 , lived in Fenchurch-Jlreet,
oneMr.Coates, a Tobacco Merchant,whohad
been for many Years sorely tormented in his
Body, and had had Recourse for a Cure to all
the most eminent Physicians of the Age, even
up to the great Dr. Ratcliff himself ; but all
this mighty Application for Relief was still in
vain : Each Doctor own'd him a Wonder
and a Mystery to Physick, and left him as
much a Wonder as they found him. Nei
ther could the Professors of Surgery guess at
his Ailment, or resolve the Riddle of his Di
stemper ; and after having spent, from
first to last, above a Thousand Pounds in
search of proper Remedies, they found the
Search ineffectual : The Learned all agreed,
that it could proceed from nothing else but
Witchcraft ; they had now indeed guessd
the Source of his Illness, but it was an Ill
ness of such a Kind, that, when they had
ti.hi r , „■ . /, h ■. .■■ ; ■> ,. 'found
i8i 77* Life and Adventures
found it out, they thought themselves not
the proper Persons to prescribe to him any
Remedies. That Task was reserv'd, it seems,
for our Duncan Campbell, who, upon some
Body's Information or other, was sent
for to the bewitched Patient Mr. Coates,
who found him the Wonder that the others
had left him, but did Wonders in undertaking
and compassing his Cure. I remember, one
of the Ingredients made use of, was boiling
his own Water, but I can't tell how twas
used ; and, upon turning over the Books of
some great Physicians since, I have found,
that they themselves have formerly deliver'd
thar, as one part of the Prescriptions for the
Cure of Patients in like Cases. But as there
are other Things, which Mr. Campbell per
forms, that seem to require a Mixture of the
Second-sight, and of this Natural Magick be
fore they can be brought about, I will enter
tain the Reader with one or two Paslages of
that sort likewise, and so conclude the Histo
ry of this so singular a Man's Life and Ad
ventures.
In the Year 1710, a Geritlewoman lost:
about Six Pounds Worth of Flanders-Lace,
and inasmuch as it was a Present made
to her Husband, me was concerned as much
as if it had been of twenty Times the Va
lue ; and a Lady of her Acquaintance com
ing to visit her, to whom ihe unfolded a-
mong other Things in Discourse this little
Disaster : The Lady smiling, reply'd, with this
i . Question,
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 18$
Question, Did you never hear, Madam, of Mr.
Duncan Campbell \ It is but making your Ap
plication to him, Things that are lost are im
mediately found ; the Power of his Know
ledge exceeds even the Power of Laws ; they
but restrain, and frighten, and punifli Robbers,
but he makes Thieves expiate their Guilt, by
the more virtuous Way of turning Restorers
of the Goods they have stol'n. Madam| re
joined the losing Gentlewoman, you smile
when you tell me this ; but really as much
a Trifle as it
is,
since 'twas
a
Present to my
Husband,
I
can't help being sensibly concern
ed at
it
;
a
Moment's Disappointment to him
in
the least thing in Nature, creates
in
me
a
greater uneasiness, than the greatest Dis
appointment to my single self could do, in
Things of Moment and Importance. What
makes me (mile, laid the Lady when
Ispeak
of
it,
or think of
it,
is
the Oddness and Pe
culiarity of this Man
s
Talent
in
helping one
to such Things
;
but, without the least Jest,
I
aslure you, that
I
know, by Experience, these
Things come within the Compass of his Know
ledge
;
and
I
must seriously tell you, for your
farther Satisfaction, that he has help'd me,
and several of my Friends, to the finding a-
gain Things lost, which were of great Value.
And
is
this, without laughing, true, said the
losing Fair, very gravely and demurely, like
a
Person half believing, and desirous to be fully
confirmed
in
such
a
Belief
?

-Truth of the Matter, alledging that, for a
single half Guinea, he would inform her of
her Things, and describe the Person that con
vey'd them away. No sooner was this Gentle-
"Woman convinc d, but she was eager for the
Tryal, solicited her Friend to conduct her to
Mr. Campbell ; and upon the first Word of
Consent, she was hooded and scarfed imme
diately, and they coached it away in a Trice
to Mr. Campbell's House, whom they luckily
found within.
The Ladies had not been long seated, be
fore he wrote down the Name ofthis new Cli
ent ofhis, exactly as it was, viz. Mrs. Saxon.
Then she was in good Hopes, and with much
Confidence propounded to him the question
about the Lace. He paused but a very little
while upon the Matter before he describ'd
the Person that took
it,
and satisfy
ld
her, that
in two or three Days she would be Mistress
of her Lace again, and find
it
in some Book,
or Corner of her Room. She presented him
a
Half-Guinea, and was very contentedly go
ing away
;
but Mr. Campbell very kindly
stopped her, and signify
'd
to her,that
if
she had
no more to offer to him, he had something
of more Importance to reveal to her
:
She
sate full of expectation while he wrote this
new Matter
;
and the Paper he deliver'd to
her contain'd the following Account. As
for the Loss of
a
little Bit of Lace,

Hundreds of Pounds, which your Aunt (nam
ing her Name) left you, but you are bub
bled out of that large Sum.1 For while you
was artfully required down Stairs about some?
pretended Business or other, one Mr. H-ttrni
convey d your Aunt's Will out of. the Desk,'
and several other Things of Value. And wri-?
ting down the Names of all the Persons con-
cern'd, which put Mrs. Saxon in a great
Consternation ; he concluded this Paper,
with bidding her go home with a contented
Mind, she should find her face in a few Days,:
and as she found that predictions prove true,
she should afterwards come and consult about
the rest.
When- she came home (it seems) big at
first with the Thoughts of what (he had been
told, he rifled and ranfack'd every Comer,
but no Lace was to be met with ; all the.
next Day she hunted in the like manner,,
but frightened the whole" Time, as if the I
thought the Devil was the only Person could
bring

but all to no purpose; the third
Day her Curiosity abated, the gave over the

Hopes of

and took the prediction as
a
vain
delusion, and that, what she gave for
it,
was
only more money thrown away after what
:
had been left before. That very Day, as
it

in
such Cases, when the

by Acci

and
then amplifying the Discourse about what he
had told her besides, as to more considera

a
little farther about them, and
begg'd her Husband to accompany her. He
would fain have laugh'd her out of that Opi

but the End was she per

- Well
!
to Mr. Campbell's they accordingly
came, and after Mr. Saxon, in Deference to
his Wife's Desire, had paid our Predictor
a
handsome Compliment of Gold
;
Mr. Dun-
cm Campbell saluted him
in
as grateful
a
manner, with the assurance, that there was
in Kent
a
little Country-House with some
Lands appertaining to
it,
that was his,
in
right
of his Wife
:
That he had the House, as
it
were, before his Eyes, that tho' he had ne

it,
nor been near the
place where
it
stood, he had seen
it
figura
tively as
if
in exact Painting and Sculpture,
that particularly
it
had four green Trees be

;
from whence he was positive,
that
if
Mr. Saxon went with him

of
it,
he should find
it
out, and know.it as
well, the Moment he came near
it,

if
he

all his Life.

liever, yet must naturally wish to find
it
true,

;
and yet partly doubting the
event and partly pleased with the visionary
Promise of
a
Fortune he never expected,
laughed very heartily at the Odd ness of the
Adventure, and said, he wouldrconsider, whe
ther
it
would not savour, too much of Quix
otism, to be at the Expence of
a
journey on
such Frolicks, and on such
a

by way of Frolick, His Wife one morning
laying, that she did remember some.Talk of
a
House, and such Things as Mr. Campbell had
deserib'dj put him forward upon the Adven
ture
;
and upon Mr. Saxon's proposing
it
to
his brother Bernard, Mr. Barnard sovourd
the Proposal as
a
Joke, and agreed upon the
Country Ramble. They came on horseback
to Mr.Campbell's, with
a
third Horse,pn which
the Dumb Predictor was mounted, and so on
they jogg'd into Kent towards Sevenoak, be
ing the Place which he describ'd.The first Day
they setout was on
a
Saturday Morning \x\Jimey
and
i88 TjfoLiFE and Adventures
and about Five that Afternoon they arrived
at the Black-Bull at Sevenoak in Kent. It
being a delicate Evening, they took an agree
able Walk up a fine Hill gracefully adorn'd
with Woods, to Knolle, an ancient Seat of
the Earl of Dorset s, meeting, by the way,
with an old Servant of the Earl's, one Perkin,
he offered Mr. Barnard, who
(it
seems) was
his old Acquaintance, to give them all
a
Sight
of that fine ancient Seat.
After they had pleased themselves with
viewing the antique Nobility'of that infra
structure, this ferkin went back with them
to their Inn, the Butt at Sevenoak. They
that could talk were very merry in Chat; and
the Dumb Gentleman^
who saw them laugh,
and wear all the signs of alacrity in their
Countenances, was resotv'd not to be behind
with their Tongues, and
by
Dint of Pen, Ink,
and Paper, that he made Signs should be
brought in, was resolv'd (if one might be said
to crack without Noise) to crack his jest as
well as the best of them
;
for
it
may be tru
ly
said of him, that he seldom comes into
any even diverting company, where he,
is
not the most diverting Man there,and the Head
(tho' we cant call him 'the Mouth) of the
chearful Society. After having eyd this Per
kins
a
little, and being grown t his Art*
as we may suppose, as familiar with the Man's
Humour, as
if
he had known him as many
Years as Mr. Barnard

And pray, reply
'd
Mr. Bar

?
Must he be so,
because his name
is
Perkin?
I
do •
assure
you, in' this you shew your self but little
of
a
conjurer
:
If you can tell no more of
Houses than you do of Men
,
we may give
over our Search after the House you spoke
of
:
(Here the reader must understand, they
discoursed on their Fingers, and wrote by

Turns.) Mr. Campbell reply
'd
seriously, Lay

is
no Argument in other Things,
I
own
;
but in this
I
know
it
is
;
because
I
am sure, after we have laid the Wager, he
will fairly confess
it
among Friends, since
it?
will go no farther
:
And
I,
said Mr. Campbells
will lay what Wager you will apiece with you
all round. Hereupon, Mr. Barnard,- who had
known him
a
great many Years, was the first
that laid
;
and many more, to the Number
of Five or Six, follow'd his example. The
Decision of the Matter was deferr'd till next
Day, at the Return of the old man to the
Inn
;
they being about to break up that Night,
and go to Bed. .

3.90 The Life and Adventures*
The next Day, being Sunday, the land-:
lord carry d his Guests to fee the Country j
and after a handsome Walk, they came thro*
the Churchyard. They were poring upon
the Tombs ; no Delight can be . greater to
Mr. Campbell than that : And really,by the fre
quent Walks he usually takes in Westminster-
Abbey, and the Churchyards adjacent to this
Metropolis , one would imagine he takes De
light to italk along by himself on that dumb
silent Ground, where the characters of the
Persons are only to be known, as his own
Meaning is, by Writings and Inscriptions on
the Marble. When they had sufficiently
survey d the Churchyard , it grew near Din
ner-time, and they went homewards ; but
before they had got many Yards out of the
Churchyard, Mr. Campbell makes a full Stop,
pointing up to a House ; and stopping his
Friends a little, he pulls out of his Pocket a
Pencil and Paper, and writes down the fol
lowing Words : That, That is the House my
Vision presented to me ; Icouldswear it to be
the same : I know it to be the same : Iam
certain os it. The Gentlemen with him re-
mark'd it ; would not take any farther No-'*
tice at that Time, intending to enquire into
it with Secrecy ; and so went on to the Inn
to Dinner.
As merry as they had been the Night be
fore after Supper, they were still more inno
cently chearful this Day after Dinner, till the
Time
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. 291
Time of Service began. When the duty of
the Day was performed and over, they re
turns to divert and unbend their Minds,
with pleasant but harmless Conversation. I
suppose no body, but a Set of very great
Formahfts, will be offended with Scandal or
Scruples, that, to Travellers just ready to de
part the Town , Mr. Perkin came on that
good Day, and decided the Wagers, by own
ing to all the Company (Secrecy being first
enjoined) that he was a Roman Catbolick ;
tho' no body of the Family knew it in so
many Years as he had liv'd there, which "was
before Mr. Campbell was born. This, and
other innocent Speeches, afforded as much
Chearfulneft as the Lords-Day would al
low of. ..:.
On the next Day, being Monday', they sent
for one Mr. Toland Toler, an Attorney of the
Place, to find out to whom that House be-
long'd ; but by all the Enquiry that could pos
sibly be made, Cwith convenient Secrecy J no
body could find it out for a long Time ; but
at last it came to light, and appeard to be just
ly to a Tittle as Mr. Campbell had predicted.
Being now latisfy'd, the next Day our three
Travellers return'd for London ; and the two
Vocal Men were very jocular upon their Ad
venture, and by their outward Gesticulations,
gave the prophetical Mute his Share of Di
version. Mr. Barnard as they pafe'd into a
Farm-House Yard, remark'd, that all the Hogs

19* fbe Life and ADVEritUR. E9
sell ^grunting and squeaking more and more,
as Mr. Campbell came nearer ; (who, poor
man? could know nothing of" the Jest, nor
the Cause of
it,
till they alighted, and- told
it
him by Signs and Writing
;
)
and said to Mr.
Saxon, laughing, Now we have found out our
House, we ihall have only Mr. Campbell home
again by himself; \Ve have no farther need
of the Devil, that ac'company'd him to the
Country, up to town with us-; there are o-
ther Devils enow to be met with there, he

'd
into the

so-
difficult to answer, that
if

Notion
/- •-
194 Tbe Life and Adyentur.es
Notion that she was a Relation's Daughter,
and recommended to his Care in her Infan
cy. Now the Man that had the Second-
Sight was to be try'd : It was now to be
put to the Proof, if he could tell Names, or
no. Amandus was so much an Unbeliever,
as to be willing to hazard the Discovery*
Amabella and Delphina were Strangers to
her real Name ; and ask'd Duncan Camp
bell ; not doubting, but he would set down
that which she ordinarily went by. Ama
bella had indeed been told by Amandus, that
Adeodata was the natural Daughter of a near
Friend of his ; but who this near Friend
was, remain'd a Secret : That was the Point
which lay upon our Duncan Campbell to disco
ver. When the Question was proposed to
him, what her Name was j he looked at her
very stedfastly, and shook his head ; and after
some Time, he wrote down, that it would
be a very difficult Name for him to fix up
on. And truly so it proved : He toil d for
every Letter till he sweated ; and the La
dies laugh'd incontinently, imagining that
he was in an Agony of Shame and Confu
sion, at finding himself pos'd. He desired
Amandus to withdraw a little, for that he
could not so well take a full and proper Sur
vey of Ladies Faces, when a gentleman was
by. This Disturbance and Perplexity of his,
afforded them still more subject of Mirth ;
and that Excuse was taken as a Pretence, and
a Put
of Mr. Duncan Camp'b ell zpj
a Put-off^ to cover his shame the better, and
hide from one at least, that he was but a
downright Bungler, in what he pretended
to be so wonderful an Artist. However,
after two Hours hard Sweat and Labour, and ,
viewing the Face in different Shades and
Lights, (for I must observe to the Reader,
that there is a vast deal of Difference ; some
he can tell in a minute or two, with Ease ;
some not in less than four or five hours, and
that with great Trouble ;) he undeceived
them with Regard to his Capacity. He wrote
down, that Adeodatds real Name was Aman
da, as being the natural Daughter of Aman-
dus. Delphina and Arabella were surpriz'd
at the Discovery ; and Amandus , when he
was call'd in, owning it a Truth, his Wife
Amabella applauded the curious Way of her
coming by such a discovery, when Adeodata
was just marriageable ; took a Liking to her,
as if her own Daughter ; and every Thing
ended with Profit, Mirth and Chearfulness. I
could add a Thousand more Adventures of
Mr. Campbell's Life, but that would prove te
dious ; and as the Town has made a great De
mand for the Book, it was thought more pro
per to conclude it here. The most diverting
of all are to be found, best to the Life, in
Original Letters that pass'd between Mr. Camp
bell and his Correspondents ; some select ones

THE
■A P P E N D I X.
T is not that Mr. Duncan Camp-
bell stands in need of my Argu
ments, to prove that he is in no
respect liable to the Acts of Par
liament made against Fortune,
tellers, &c. that I undertake the writing of
this Appendix, the true reason thereof, be
ing the more completely to finish this Un
dertaking : For having, in the Body of the
Book it self fully proved a Second-Sight,
and that the same frequently happens to
Persons, some of them eminently remark
able for Piety and Learning, and have from
thence accounted for the Manner of Mr.
Campbell's performing those Things he pro
fesies, to the great Surprize, and no less Sa
tisfaction of all the curious who are plea-
fed to consult him ; and at the same time
proved the Lawfulness of such his Perfor
mances
198 The Life and Adventures
mances from the Opinions of some of the
most learned in holy Science ; I thought
it not improper to add the following short
appendix, (being a Summary of several
Actsof Parliament made a^inUFortune-telkrSy
'-
Convert, Gipfie*
(\*
e. Egyptians') Sorcerers
Pretenders to Prophesy, &c. with some
proper Remarks, suited to our present Pur
pose) as well to satisfy them who are fan
tastically Wife, and obstinately shut their
Eyes against the most refulgent Reason, and
are wilfully deaf to the most convincing
and persuasive Arguments, and thereupon
cry out, that Mr. Campbell
is
either an Im
postor and
a
Cheat, or at least
a
Person
who acts by the Assistance of unlawful
Powers
;
as also to put to silence the no
less waspish Curs, who are always snarling
at such, whom Providence has distinguish
'd
by more excellent Talents than their Neigh
bours. True Merit
is
always the Mark,
against which Traducers level their keenest
Darts
;
and Wit and Invention oftentimes
join Hands with Ignorance and Malice to
foil those who excel. Art has no greater
Enemy than Ignorance
;
and were there no
such Thing as Vice, Virtue would not shine
with half its Lustre. Did Mr. Campbell
perform those wonderful things he
is
so
deservedly famous for, as these Cavillers
fay,
by
holding Intelligence with Infernal
Powers, or
by
any unjustifiable Means,
I
am
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 199
am of Opinion, he would find very few, in
this Atheistical Age, who would open their
Mouths against him, since none love to act
counter to the interest of that Master they
industriously serve. And did he, on the other
Hand, put the Cheat upon the World, as they
maliciously assert, I fancy he would then be
more generally admired, especially in a Coun
try where the Game is so universally, art
fully, and no less profitably play'd, and that
with Applause, since those Pretenders to
Wisdom merrily divide the whole Species of
Mankind into the two Classes of Knaves and
Fools, fixing the Appellation of Folly only
upon those whom they think not Wise, that
is,
wicked enough to have
a
Share with
them in the profitable Guilt.
Our laws are as well intended by their
wise makers to skreen the Innocent, as to
punish the Guilty
;
and where their Penal
ties are remarkably severe, the Guilt they
punish
is
of
a
proportionable Size. Art,
which
is
a
Man's Property when acquire!,
claims
a
Protection from those very Laws
which false Pretenders thereto are to be try'd
and punished by, or else all Science would
soon have an end
;
for no Man would dare
make use of any Talent Providence had
lent him, and his own industrious Applica
tion had improved, should he be immedi
ately try'd and condemn
'd
(by those Statues,
which
(}oo The Life and Adventures
which are made to suppress Villains,) by eve
ry conceited and half learned Pedant.
'Tis true indeed, those excellent Statutes,
which are made against 4 sort of People,
who pretend to Fortune-telling, and the like,
are such as are well warranted, as being
built upon the best foundation, viz. Relir
gion and Policy j ami. were Ms. Campbell
guilty of any such Practice4 as those are
made to punish, I openly declare, that. I
"should be so far from endeavouring to de
fend his cause, that I would be one of the
(first that ihoujd aggravate his Crime, there-
by. to enforce the speedier Execution of
-those Laws upon him which are made against
jsuch Offenders^ But when he is so far from
adding, that he doth not even pretend to any
iuch Practice, or for countenancing the fame
in others, as is manifest from the many De
jections he has made of that fort of Villany*
-which the Book furnishes us with, I think
my self sufficiently justified for thus pleading
in his Defence.
I cannot but take notice, in reading the
statutes made . against such offenders, our
wise Legislature hath not in any part of
them seem'd so much as to imply, that
there are in reality any such wicked Persons
as they arc made against, to wit, Conjurers,
&c. but that -they are only Pretenders, to
those infernal arts as may reasonably slap
inferr'd
of Mr. Duncan Cam pbell y$i
inferr'd from the Nature of the Penalties
they inflict ; for our first Laws of that sort
only inflicted a penalty, which affected the
Goods and Liberty of the guilty, and not
their Lives, tho' indeed they were afterwards
forced to heighten the Punishment with a
halter ; not that they were- better convinc'd,
as I humbly conceive, but because the Crimi
nals were most commonly Persons who had
no goods to forfeit; and to whom their Li
berty was no otherwise valuable, but as it gave
them the opportunity of doing Mischief. In
deed our Law-Books do furnish us with ma
ny Instances of Persons, who have been tryd
and executed for Witchcraft and Sorcery, but
then the wiser part of Mankind have taken the
Liberty to condemn the Magistrate, at that
time of day, of too much Inconsideratibn,
and the Juries of an equal (hare of Credulity :
And those who have suffered for such Crimes
have been commonly Persons of the lowest
rank, whose Poverty might occasion a Dill
like of them in their FelloW-Creatures, and
their too artless Defence, subject them to
their mistaken Justice ; so that upon the
whole, I take the Liberty to conclude* and,
I hope, not without good grounds, that
those Laws were made to deter Men from
an idle Pretence to mysterious and unjusti
fiable Arts, which, if too closely pursued,
commonly lead them into the darkest Villa-
ny, not only that of deceiving others, but
, ■- i as
joi The Life and Adventures
as far as in them be, making themselves
Slaves to the Devil ? And not to prevent
and hinder Men from useful Enquiries, and
from the practice of such Arts, which tho'
they are in themselves mysterious, yet are,
and may be lawful.
I would not however be thought, in con
tradiction to my former Arguments, to as
sert, that there never were, or that there
now are no Persons, such as Wizards, Sor
cerers, &c. for by so doing, I should be as
liable to be censored for my Incredulity, as
those who defame Mr. Campbell on that Ac
count, are for their want of Reason and com
mon honesty. Holy and Prophane Writ, I
confess, furnishes us with many instances of
such Persons ; but we must not from thence
hastily infer, that all those Men are such who
are spightfully branded with the odious Guilt ;
for were it in the Devil's Power to make
every wicked Man a Wizard , and Woman a
Witch, he soon would have Agents enough
to shake this lower World to Atoms ; but
the Almighty, who restrains him, likewise
restrains those.
Having premised thus much, I shall now
proceed to consider some of the Acts of Par
liament themselves ; the Persons against whom
they were made, and the Necessity of making
the fame. And some of the first Acts we
meet with, were those which were made
against a sort of People called Gypsies,
Persons,
os Mr. Duncan Campbell 3-03
Persons, who, if in reality such, might, if
any, be suspected of practising what we call
the Black Art, the same having been for
many Ages encouraged in their Country ;
nay, so much has it been by them favour'd,
that it was introduced into their superstiti
ous Religion
(if
I
may without an Absur
dity call it
so) and made an essential Part
thereof
:
And,
I
believe, Mahomet anism has
not much mended the Matter, since
it
has
imperiously reigned there, or
in
any respect
reform'd that Idolatrous Nation. Now the
Mischief these Persons might do (being
so
much
in
the Devil's Power) among the un
wary, was thought too considerable not to
be provided against
j
and therefore our wise
Legislature, the more effectually to prevent
the same, by striking at the very Founda
tion, made an Act in the n X VIII.
That
if
any, calling themselves Gypsies,
do come into this Realm, they shall forfeit
all their Goods
;
and being demanded, shall
depart the Realm within fifteen Days, upon
pain of Imprisonment
;
and the Importers of
them by another Act, were made liable to
a
heavy Penalty. This Act was continu'd by
the
1
Ph. and Ma. Conjuration, Witchcraft,
Jnchantment, and sorcery, to get Money, or
consume any Person in his Body, Members,
or Goods, or to provoke any Person to un
lawful Love, was by the 33 X VIII. 14. and
the
5
Eliz. 16. and the
I
Jac.

ii. made
Felony

504 The Life and Adventures
felony ; and by the fame 33 H. VIII. 14. it
was made Felony to declare to another any
false Prophecies upon Arms, &c. but this
Act was repealed by the 1 Ed. VI. iz. but
by another Act of the 3 and 4 of Ed. VI.
1 j. it was again enacted, that all such Per
sons who should pretend to prophecies, &c.
should, upon conviction for the first Offence
forfeit Ten Pounds, and one Year's Impri
sonment ; and for the second Offence, all his
Goods and Imprisonment for Life. And by
the 7. Ed. VI. 11. the same was made to
continue but till the then next Session of
Parliament. And by the 5% Eliz. 15-. the
fame Act was again renewed against fanta
stical Prophefiers, &c. but both those Acts
were repealed by the 1
Jac. I. 1 z.
Thus far we find, that for Reasons of State,
and for the Punishment of particular Persons,
those Acts w ere made and repealed, as oc
casion required, and not kept on foot, or in
deed were they ever made use
of,
as
I
can
remember in my reading, against any Per
sons whose Studies led them into
a
useful
Enquiry into the Nature of Things, or a
lawful Search into the Workings of Na
ture
it
self, by which means many things
are foretold long before they come to pals,'
as Eclypses, and the like,' which Astrologers
successfully do, st art has been
in
all A-'
ges held in
so
great Esteem, that the first Mo.
narchs of the East made-
it
their peculiar-
Study,
of Mr. Duncan Campbell." %0$
Study, by which means they deservedly ac
quired to themselves the Name of Magi or
Wife Men ; but, on the contrary, were pro
vided against Persons profligate and loose,
who, under a Pretence and Mask of Science,
commit vile and roguish Cheats ; and this
will the more plainly appear, if we consider
the Letter and express Meaning of the follow
ing acts, wherein the Persons Iam speaking of
are described by such characters which suf
ficiently prove the Assertion : For in the 39
of Eliz. 4. it was enacted, That all Persons
calling themselves scholars going about beg-
ging,Sea-faring Men pretending Loslesof their
Ships and Goods at Sea, and going about the
Country begging, or using any subtile Craft,
feigning themselves to have Knowledge in Phi-
Jiognomy, Palmistry, or any other the like
crafty Science, or pretending that they can tell
Destinies, Fortunes, or such like fantastical
Imaginations, shall be taken and deem'd
Rogues, Vagabonds, sturdy Beggars, and shall
be stripped naked from the Middle upwards,
and whipp'd till his,or herBody be bloody.And
by the 1
Jam. r. 12. for the better restraining
of the said Offences, and for the farther pu
nishing the same, it was farther enacted, That
any Person or Persons using witchcraft, Sor*
eery, &c. and all their Aiders, Abettors, and
Counsellors, being convicted and attainted
of the fame Offences, shall suffer Pain of
Deatli as Felons, without the Benefit of Cler-
X gy;
306 The Life and Adventur es
gy : Or to tell and declare in what Place any
Treasure of Gold and Silver should or might
be found in the Earth, or other secret Places :
Or where Goods or Things lost or stolen
should be found : Or to provoke any Person
to unlawful Love, such Offender to suffer
Imprisonment for one whole Year without
Bail or Mainprize, and once in every quarter
of the said Year mall in some Market-Town,
or upon the Market-Day, or at any such Time
as any Fair shall be kept there, stand openly
in the Pillory for the $space of six hours, and
there shall openly confess his or their Offence;
and for the second Offence shall suffer Death
as Felons without the Benefit of Clergy.
That these Laws were made against a Set
of Villains, whose natural Antipathy to Ho
nesty and Labour, furnished them with Pre
tensions to an uncommon Skill, thereby the
more easily to gull and cheat the superstiti^
in credulous, and by that means discover
from them some such Secrets that might far
ther them in perpetrating the more consum
mate Villany, is plain from the very Words
and Expressions of the very A&s themselves,
and the Description of the Persons they are
made against ; and not, as I before observed,
to prevent and hinder Men from the lawful
Enquiry after useful, delightful, and profitable
knowledge.
Mr. Campbell, who has been long a settled
and reputable Inhabitant in many eminent
*
Parts
ofMr. Duncan Campbell 307
Parts of the City of London, cannot, I am
sure, be lobk'd upon as one of those these
Acts of Parliament were made against, un
less we first strip the acts themselves of their
own natural, express and plain Meaning, and
cloath them with that which is more obscure,
unnatural, forced, and constrained ; a practice,
which, if allowed, would make them wound
the Innocent and clear the Guilty, and ren
der them not our Defence but our greatest
Evil ; they would, by that means, become
a perfect JLnigma, (or Riddle) and be so far
from being admired for their Plainnese, that
they would be even exploded like the Oracles
of the heathens for their double Meaning.
If Mr. Campbell has the Second-Sight, as is
unquestionable from the allowed Maxim, that
what has been may be again, and by that
means can take a View of Contingencies, and
future Events ; so long as he confines these
Notices of approaching Occurrences to a good
purpose, and makes use of them only inno
cently and charitably to warn Persons from do
ing such Things, that according to his Con
ceptions would lead them into Misfortune,
or else in ,
putting them upon such Arts that
may be of Use and Benefit to themselves and
posterity, always having a strict Regard to
Morality and religion to which he truly ad
heres : Certainly, I think, he ought so much
the more to be admired for the fame, by how
much the more this his excellent knowledge
: X % is
^o8
The Life and Adventures
is surpassing that of other Men, and not be
therefore unjustly upbraided with the injuri
ous character of a Cheat, or an ill Man :
However, this Iwill presume to affirm, and I
doubt not but to have my Opinion confirm'd
by the Learned Sages of the Law, that this
innocent practice, and I venture to add, ho
nest one too, doth by no means entitle him
to the Penalties of the before-mentioned
Laws made against Fortune-tellers, and such
sort of profligate Wretches ; which it as great
an absurdity to decry, as it would be to call
him, who is a settled, and reputable Inhabi
tant, a Stroler or wandering Beggar.
Again, It is true that Mr. Campbell has re
lieved many that have been supposed to have
been bewitched, as is related and well attested
in this Account of his Life ; but will any one
from thence argue that he himself is a real
Conjurer or Wizard, because he breaks the
Chains by which those unhappy wretches were
bound l No surely, for if that were the Case,
we might then as well indict the Physician
who drives away a malignant Distemper, and
roots out its latentCause by his mysterious Skill
in Plants and Drugs ; or conclude, that the
Judge who condemns a Criminal is for the
lame Reason guilty of the self-same Crime for
which the Offender is so by him condemned.
Persons who delight in such unnatural Con
clusions, must certainly be in love with the
greatest absurdities, and must entirely aban
don
os Mr. Duncan Campbell 509
don their natural Reason, before they can be
brought to conclude, that the Prince of Dark
ness would assist Men in destroying his own
Power.
The best answer I can afford these Men is
Silence ; for if they will not argue upon the
Principles of Reason, or be guided by her
dictates, I think them no more fit to be con
tended with, in a rational and decent man
ner, than Bedlamites, and such who are bereft
of all Understanding. A Rod is the best Ar
gument for the Back of a Fool, and Contempt
the best Usage that ought to be shewn to every
head-strong and ignorant Opponent.
In a Word, Iknow of no Branch of Mr.
Campbell's Practice that bears the least Resem
blance to those Crimes mentioned in the fore
going acts. That he can and doth tell Peoples
Names at first Sight, tho' Perfect Strangers to
him, is confessed by all who have made the
curious Enquiry at his Hands ; but what part
of the Law, Iwould fain know,is that against ?
Knowledge, and a clear Sight into things not
common, is not only an allowable, but a com
mendable Qualification ; and whether this
Knowledge in him be inherent, accidental, or
the result of a long study, the Case is still the:
fame ; since we are assured he doth it by no-
unlawful Intelligence,or makes use of the fame
to any
ill
purpose, and therefore
is
undoubted
ly
as lawful as to draw natural Conclusions
from right Premises.. Hard

$io The Life and Adventures,
Man to be ignorant, but much harder would
his Lot be, it he were to be punished for being
Wife, and, like Mr. Campbell, excelling others
in this kind of Knowledge.
Much more might be said in Defence of
Mr. Campbell and the Art he profesleth, but as
the Arguments which are brought against
him by his Enemies on the one Hand, are
trivial and ill-grounded ; I therefore think
they deserve no farther Refutation ; so on the
other, his Innocency is too clear to require it.
After having thus taken a Survey of Mr.
Campbell's practices, with regard to their Le
gality according to the Statutes and the Laws
of the Nation wherein he lives, we will con
sider next, whether according to • the stated
Rules of Casuistry, among the great divines
eminent for their Authority, it may be lawful
for Mr. Campbell to predict, or for good
Christian Persons to visit his House, and con
sult him about his predictions. I have upon
this Head examined all the learnedest Casuists
I could meet with in ancient times, for I
cannot meet (in my reading with any Mo
derns that treat thoroughly upon this cafe,
or I should rather have chosen them, because
perhaps the Second-Sight was lese known in
those antient Days thank has been since, and
so might escape their Notice. :' ■'
My Design is first to give the reader a
dilinct Summary of all that has been said of
this Matter, and to do it as succinctly and
t briefly
of Mr. Duncan Campbell. 311-
briefly as possible, and then to argue my
self from what they agree upon as to this
Man's particular Case.
That every one may have recourse to the
Authors themselves, if they have a curiosity,
and find that I don't go about to impose up
on their Judgments, I will here tell the Rea
der where he may find the whole Contents
of the following little Abstract of Divinity
and Casuistry ; because it would be a tedious
piece of Work to set down the Words of each
of them distinctly, and quote them every
one round at the end of their several dif
ferent sentences, which tend to the lame.
Meaning; but I will strictly keep to the Sense.
of them all ; and I here give the Reader their.

These
^
fiz The Life and Adventures
"These Divines have generally written ur>
on the impious Arts of Magick, which they
call by the Name of Divination ; and this Di
vination Cas they term
it)
they divide into
Kinds, the One, in which the Devil
is
ex
press invoked to teach hidden and occult
Things
;
the other, in which he
is
tacitly
called upon to do the some. An express In
vocation
is
by Word or Deed, by which
a
real
compact isactually made with the Devil, and
that
is
a
Sin that affects the Death of the Soul,
according tathe Laws of Theology, and ought
to effect the Death of the Body, according to
Civil and Political Laws. The tacit Invoca
tion of Dæmons
is
then only, when
a
Man
busies himscff so far with such persons, that
it
is
meet, and just, that the Devil should be per
mitted, to. have to do with him, though
it
was
opposite to the Intention of the Man.
■
But then this express Invocation again
is
subdivided .into several Species, according to
the divers manners
by
which the Devil in
structs these men.
•
,
j
•
.
•
The first
is
Enebanttrtent, which
I
need not
describe, and of which
I
will speak: ho more,
because
it
is
what every Body know^to be de-
teslable,and no Body ought to kno^^tbje art,
thereof:, .v

any Instructions are expected from the Devil .
by
way of Dream, which
is
a
capi$aLCrime.y
:':,<:
I
The
os Mr. Duncan Campbell! jij
The third is called necromancy, which
is,
when by the use of Blood and writing, or
speaking certain Verses, the Dead seem to rise
again, and speak and teach future Things. For
tho the Devil can't recal
a
Soul departed, yet
he can (as some have thought) take the shape
of the dead corpse, himself actuate
it
by
his
Subtilty, as
if
it
was informed with
a
Soul. And
some affirm, that by the Divine Permission,
the Devil can do this, and spake
so
in
the Case
of, Samuel and Saul. But Divines of
a
more
solid Genius attribute that Power only to the
Deity, and fly, with Reason, that
it
is
beyond
the Devil's Capacity. Butit
is
certain this was
a
Divination done in dead Animals
by
the Use
oftheir Blood, and therefore the Word
is
de
rived from the Greek vixefivi which signifies
Dead, and Martha, which signifies Divination.,
The fourth Species
is
called Divination by
the Pythian*,, which was taken from Apollo,
the first Diviner, as Thomas Aquinas soys in
his Secundd secundœ qit. 95. Artie.
3.
The fifth
is
called Geomancy, which
is
when
the Devil teaches any Thing
by
certain Signs
appearing in the Earthly Bodies, as
in
Wood,
Iron, or polished Stones, Beryls, or Glass.
The sixth
is
named Hydromancy, as when
a
Damon teaches any Thing by Appearances
in, the Water.
-The seventh
is
stiled Æromancy
;
which
is
whenhe informs People of such Things by
Figures
in
the Air.
Y
The
314 The Life and Adventures
The Eighth is entituled Pyromancy j that
is,
when
it
instructs People
by
Forms appear
ing
in
the Fire.
The Ninth
is
termed Arnspicy
j
which
is,
when by Signs appearing
in
the Bowels of
sa
crificed Animals the Dæmon predicts at Altars.
•
Thus far, as to express Divination, or Invo
cation of the Devil, which
is
detestable, and
the very consulting of Persons, that use such
unlawful Means,
is
according to the Judg
ment of all Casuists, the high Road to eter
nal Damnation.. ' *
Now as to tacit Divination or Invocation
of the Devil, that
is
divided into two subal
tern kinds. The first Kind
is,
when for the
fake of knowing hidden Things, they make
use of
a
vain and superstitious Disposition
existing in Things to judge from
;
which'
Disposition
is
not of
a
sufficient Virtue to lead
them to any real Judgment. The second
Kind of tacit Divination
is,
when that
Knowledge
is
sought by the Disposition of
those Things, which Men effect on purpose
and of their own accord,
in
order to come
by and acquire that Knowledge.
Both these Kinds of tack Divination are
again subdivided into several Species, as are
particularly mentioned by St. Tho. Aquin. Se-
cimda Secundx. Quæst. 95. Artie.

dt T>oU. Christ, cap. 19. & sequent.
The first of these Kinds of tacit Divination,
contains under it the following several species.
The first Species is called Genethliacaly
which is, when from the Movement or Situa
tion of the Stars,' Men's Nativities are calcula
ted and enquired into
so
far, as that from such
a
Search they pretend to deduce the Know
ledge of human effects, and the contingent
Events that are to attend them. This Thomas
Aquinas, and Sixtus Quintus condemns
;
but
I
shall with Humility and Submission to great
er Judgments enquire hereafter into their Rea
sons, and give my Opinion why
I
think this
no evil Art
5
but
I
submit my Opinion,
if,
after
it
is
given,
it
is
thought erroneous.
The second
is
Augury, when any Thing
is
predicted from the chattering of Birds, or the;
voice of Animals, and this may be either law
ful, or unlawful. If
it
comes from natural in
stinct (for brutes having only
a
sensitive soul,
have their organs subject to the Disposition of
the greater Bodies in which they are contain
ed, and principally of all to the Celestial Bo
dies) his augury
is
not amiss, for
if
when
Crows are remark'd to Kaw (as the Vulgar
Phrase
is)
more than ordiniary^
it
is
judging
according to the instinct of their Nafure,if we
expect Rain
j
and we may reasonably depend
upon
it,
we shall be right
if
we foretell Rain to!
be at Hand. But sometimes the Devils actuate
those
$i6 The Life and Adventures
those Brute Animals to excite vain Ideas in
Men, contrary to what the instinct of their
Nature compels them to. This is superstiti
ous and unlawful, and forbid in holy Writ.
, The Third is Aruspicjr, when from the Flight
of Birds, or any other Motion of any Animals
whatsoever, Persons pretend to have an in
sight and a penetrative Knowledge into oc-:
cult and hidden Matters.
: The fourth consists in omens, when for
Example a Man from any Words which others
may have spoken on Purpose or by Accident,
pretends to gather a way of looking into and
knowing any Thing of Futurity.
. The fifth is Chiromancy
',■
which consists
in
making
a
pretence to the Knowledge of
fu
ture Things by the Figures and the Lines of
the Hands
:
And
if
it
be
b.y
consulting the
Shoulder-bones of any Beast,
it
goes by the
Name of Spatulamancy.
-r As the first Kind of Divination, by
a
tacit
invocation of the Devil,
is
divided into the
five Species above-mentioned
;
so also
is
the
second kind of tacit Divination or invocation *
of the Devil, divided into two Species by
3t. Thomas Aquin. Secunda fecund^ qu&~
sticne nonagefimd quinta articulo tertio, and
too tedious to insert here.
Now all these Ways are by these Divines
accounted wicked, and
I
set them down that
people may avoid them. For how many Gyp
sies and Pretenders loChyromancy have w'ejn..
London
of Mr. Duncan Campbell^ 817
London and in the Country >
How many that
are for Hydromancy, that pretend in Water
to sliew Men mighty Mysteries ? And how
many in Geomancy, with their Beryls and
their Glades, that, if they are not under the
Instigation of the Devil, propogate the Scan
dal at least by being Cheats, and who ought
to be punished to the utmost Severity, as
our English Laws enact ? Mr. Campbell, who
hates, contemns, and abhors these ways, ought,
methinks, to be encouraged by their being
restrain'd ; and People of curious Tempers,
who always receive from him moral and good
Instructions, which make them happy in the
Conduct of Life, should be animated in a
publick Manner to consult him, in order to
divert the curious Itch of their Humours from
consulting such wicked Impostors, or Dia
bolical practices, as too frequently abound
in this Nation, by reason of the inquisitive
Vulgar, who are more numerous in our Cli
mate, than any I ever read of. *•
But now to argue the Cafe of conscience
with regard to his particular practice by way
of the Second-Sight, whether, in foro con-
scientist, it is lawful for him to follow
it,
or
others to consult him
i
The Divines above-
mentioned having never had any notice of
that Faculty in all Likelihood, or
if
they had,
never mentioning
it,
makes
it
a
Point more
difficult for me to discuss
;
but
I
think they
have stated some Cafes,
by
the making of
which
318 The Life and Adtentuk.es
which my Premises, I can deduce from all
the learned Men I have above quoted, a
Conclusion in favour of our Mr. Duncan
Campbell's and of those who consult him ; but
my Opinion shall be always corrected by those
who are wiser than my self, and to whom I
owe entire Submission. I take leave to fix
these Premises from them first, and to form
my Argument from them afterwards in the
following manner.
Firsts It is allowed by all these divines,
that a Knowledge which one may have of
future Things within the order of Nature,
is,
and may be lawful.
Secondly
',
They imply, that where justice
is
not violated,
it
is
lawful both to predict,
and to consult.
Thirdly, Many of them, but particularly
Aureolus puts this question
:
Is
it
lawful to
go to one that deals in the Black Art, to per
suade them to cure any innocent Body, that
another Necromancer or Dealer
in
the Black
Art may have maliciously afflicted, and tor
mented with Pains
?
And some of these Ca
suists, particularly Aureolus, fay,
it
is
lawful
on such an Occasion to go to such
a
Con
jurer, because the End
is
not Conjuration, but
freeing
a
Person from it.
But
I
take leave to distent from these great
Men, and think they are
in
a
double Mistake;
first
.
of Mr. Duncan Campbell 319
first in stating the question, and then in ma
king such an Answer, provided the Question
had been stated right.
The Question is founded upon this Suppo
sition (which is past by as granted) viz.
ftiat one Necromancer could release a Person
bewitched by another, which is absolutely
false j for it is against the Nature of the De
vil to be made an instrument to undo his own
Works of Impiety : But admitting, and not
granting this to be possible, and the Question
to be rightly stated, why still these Casuists
are out in their Answer ? It is lawful, reply
they, because the End of going to the Con
jurers is not Conjuration, but freeing a good'
Person from it : But the End is not the Point
here to be confided, it is the Medium which
is bad that is to be confident. It is by Con
juration, (according to their hypothesis) the
other Conjuration is to be dissolved ,• and
does not the common Rule, that a Man must
not do Evil that Good may come of
it,
for
bid this practice
?
And to speak my Opinion
plainly
in
that Case, the Friend that should
consult
a
Conjurer for that End, would be
only
so
kind to put his own Soul in danger
of being guilty of Hell-torments, to relieve
his afflicted Friend from some bodily Pains,
which
it
would be
a
Virtue
in
him to suffer
with Patience and Resignation.
Others, almost all Divines,indeed agree, that
it
is
and may be lawful to go to
a
conjurer
that
310 The Life and Adventures *
that torments another, and give him money-
not to afflict the Patient any longer ; because
that is only seeing him to desist from acting
after his conjuring manner.
These Premises thus settled, if \Oe-allpw
the Second- Sight to be in-born and in-brea,
and natural and common to some Families,
which is proved in the Book ; and if all that
Mr. Campbell has predicted in that Second-
sighted Way terminates with moral Advice,
and the profit of the Consulter, and without
the Violation of justice to others, as the
Book (hews all throughout ; if he can relieve
from Witchcraft, as it seems Oath is to be
had he can, which no one that deals in the
Black Art can do, why then I need not draw
the Conclusion, every Reader will do it na
turally ; they will avow all the strictest Laws
of Casuistry and Morality to be in favour of
Mr. Campbell and his Consumers.
