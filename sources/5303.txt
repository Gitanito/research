Rachel Raker about twenty yt'<U·s olJ.
•experienced
at th•• age of fourteen !"Om~ t'l'lif;ions cnnecrn. and in
conscquenc:e thereof joined th~ Pt·cshytcrian Church
in the county Onondaga New York. llccoming m~­
ea•..y ahont two years afterwards sht• underwent a re-
li;:ous ...ubmersion and became a member of the Jhp-
ti~t church. To that society slle has ever since bee 11
united.
She ic;; poc;;scssed of a constitution naturally good
ancl it has never been materially impaired hy disease.
Since her connection v:·ith the lattct· society, she ha!'
been in tt dr,vout frame of mine!, hut nenr inclined to
superstition on th<> one part, nnr to enthusiasm on the
other. Her deportment is s<•dat~>, l't''>Ct'\·ed. and dif-
fident. Ueiug little prone to talk, she seldom com-
mences a cotwersation, and even when spoken to is
not fond of indulging in disconro;e. She ha.:; heen in
the habit of ft·ccJuentin!; religious mertings. but in nn
other manner than the rt>gular nwmbeJ•s of the .::ocicty
to whi<"h "he belongs. Her montl character is fair
ancl exemplary.
N e\'crthcJc.,s, her facultirs ha,·c been called into
action after an uncommon manner. Once a clay for
a.bont tht·c>e years, ot· from the time of her second hap-
tism she has suflt.•r·ecl a paroxism which usuall~' <'On-

ity of her expressions has hc.-n Jl()ticcd as nm·xcq>-
tionable. She may he a.ceostctl durin:; the perfot·m-
a!lce. She hears the word~ a!ldrcss1•d lo !Jer, 2ncl
listens lo catch them. But though her n.tteni.ion is thus
rousetl she is not excited to c:rdinarr ,,·:;.kcfulnrss.
T he C']IH'rics put to her always provok~ replies. 'fbe
answers arc pious, discreet, and indicative of reli-
giow; meditation. I doubt whether tht' wakin;; pt•r-
sons pecscnt could ha\'e reo;pondctl to the questions I
put. more theologically right than this uncO)l!;~ieus
girl.
H er words arc pourea r~.rlh i:l a '!bent un;l rnpid
stren.m. ~he rarely appears at 1t l.oss for an ex;H·es-
sion. but proceeds y;ith as much l'I:'<Hliilcss as tiu:
greater part of those who pray nnd prcnth. At tir.1r-s
she is remarkably animated, and gins point to lte1·
sentences by the most ~xpreossive emphasis. But
w hen the current of her t!Jougltt is intcrl'uptetl by a.
<)Ucry, the catenation of hc1· discoms<' is also broken;
the original or }
H'Cceding suhjcct is abandoned and n.
new train of ideas suggested by the interrogation is
!!Uhstitutcd. T his she pursues as long as she has any
thing to offer, and then relapses into J1cr ordinary to-
pics of exhortation. If now a ditl"er<'nt question be
p ut it immediately gives a new dil'ection to her
thoughts, and in her reply she dw<'lls upon it until
she bas nothing further to observe; after which she
ngaiu returns to her customary tenor of discourse.
In this way I have received from her, answers in
terms devotionally appropriate to half a dozen suc-
~cssive questions on serious subjects.
Her pu.lse during; the exer~:ise was full, equable,
and flowins, without lrl'mor, fluftrr, or intermission.
]loth, ns to force and frCfJUCJJcy it has a good healthy
beat. The temperature of her haud, ttrm, face, and
foreh~ad, was so much like that (if a, person aslcrp
(hat I couhl (listinguish no preternatural heat or cold
in them. There was ueither drym·ss not• moisture
upon the skin. Howcnr toward the end of the pa-
roxism there was au evident <limiuutiou ofthe arterial
pulsatiou at the wrist. On some occasions the ft'l'-
<JUCncy is increased eight stt·okcs in a miuute. Her
features, which hatl in uo instance indicated the suutl:
Jest <listortion, Wot'C the look of languor and exhaus-
tion. 'l'he eyes have been obserred to be iumcd up-
wards, and their muscles in a tremulous spasm. She is
insensible to an the stimuli which it has been thought
l'rudent to apply, fur the purpose oftousiug her.
~H the end of the exercise, she llad a few s.Jnall
~pasms. of the arms and throat. '.fhe latter resem-
bled an h;ystcriral inflation of the pharaynx. Hhe
was agitated "ith an emotion bl:'tween sigbine; ant!
;;roaning : .\nd after a turn of restlessness a.ncl moan-
ing that lasted ft•om two to fifteen minutes, but with-
out waking, consciousness, or eYen opening her eyes,
she passed from her state ofpzt'rtm·bation to that of
'lwtm·al and t1·anquil sleep. This continues usually
until morning, us is common to persons in gooll health,
when she a\Yakcs invigorated and teft·eshed as if
nothing uncommon had h:rppened, and pt·ofesses her-
self ignorant of every part of the transaction, with
which she becomes acquainted only by information
from others. After certain of her prolonged discour-
!es, her hands have been violently clenched, and
all the muscles of the trunk antl limlJs stiffened
by spasm for a short time. Durin~ the intermission
she is as well as other persons, and works diligently
with her needle. She considers it as n. heavy aiRic-
tion that she should be the vehicle of devotional eft'u-
sions which ;ive her neither pleasure nor edification,
and which expose her to the animadversion of all who
:lire admitted to behold her.
One ~f the curious particulars in ltcr case is, the
pcrsuaston she possc'ises that she is wi<le awake.
On one occa~ioti ( ohserve<l, dur·ing her sermon, that
~he ought toiJe silent. an<l not talk so long and so lou1l
m her slt>ep. She heard me and denied that she was
asleep. Jil'r eyelid.;; were, as usual, accuratclJ closl'd.
and there was no sign of winking. She declared
het·sclf awake, an<l in conurma.tion of her opinion,
dcsct·ihe<l in vivid ~tnd glowing stntins thi.• spP.ctacle
then lwi;ht in her view; consisting of' the angels,
saints, and souls of just men made perfect, minister-
in~ before the throne of the Almighty. clothed in
rohes white as snow, and without spot or blemish,
and looking like fine linen wrought by skilful hands,
aml with curious aml cunning workmanship. Ano-
ther memorahle particular is, that while she is in this
llaroxysm, sbe a.cls un<ler the persuasion that it is
the <luty of those who are renewed by all merciful
sntce to dit·cct poor wanclercrs to the strait wa~·,
while at the same time her waking belief is, that it
is not apo.,tolical foL' a womaft to be a public teacher
of holy things.·
To remoYe this train of symptoms, her physicians
)l~d attempted to abate the excitement of her scnsori-
tun by blood-letting. This, though practi'!ed to a de-
gree considet·ably debilitatin~, did not prevent the.
paroxysm, nor b1·e~k the hahit of recm·rence. Ue-
QOUrse was also hac\ to opiates, with the intention of
(t()mposin:; her to sleep, but their anodyne qualities
were of no avail. The tit was not broken, and the
<lisease<l associations went on a!'! before. I havl' not
learned that any other important remedies were tried.
She was brought to :New-Y01·k in October. t8H
!()procure medical counsel, to try the effect of travel-
ing, and to experience the influence of a maritime at-
lllospherc. Doctor I>ouglac:;s was requested to take
~harge of her health ; and by that gentleman I was
<lesired to visit her. It was concluded, through ten·
ctcmess, to forbear all recommcmlation ~f :~rtive prQ.
:B
scription.~, until heF case could he salisfacloril~· olr~
sen·ed. "Then thereafter, a plnu oftreatment should h_c
fot•nwll, it might: at any future clay be commuw-
calcll. Afterwards llt-. Uirth. lk l\lolt, and lk
.Bruce was invited to a consultation on her case, and
they nlso consented to postpone for the present, all
interference by remetlics.
The journey did not suspencl the accustomed ~-i,iHt­
tions. The ta,·erns whct·c she stopped \rct·e "Hnr~..-.
es of her involuntary prayers and exhortations. Xm·
uitl the air of the ocean produce any salutary eil'rct.
In the cily she obtained no rrspite : every eYCning
ltet· fit was renewed. Now and then there seemed to
be an increas.e of its violence. Ji"'or if there was any
memorable alteration, it continued longer and ~·aq.
followed hy severe"!! spasms nncl greater debility.
T his might possibly be c:utscd hy the multitudes who
ct·otuled into her chamber to learn for themselYcs.
Curiosity was so strong, that, on the day of her de-
parture, many person~; followe(l her out of town to
the place of restinz; until the morn. that they might,
witness the spectacle, not of a waking preacher aml
a drowsy audience, but of a pt·cacher abstracted from
oulw:ml tltings, bohling forth to a wondering ancl
:itaring company.
Afh~r this recital of her case. there will be no
need of consitlering with somo persons that it is an
example of supernatuml agency; nor of supposin~
with others that it is an instance of rcfine(l imposture.
It is capable of solution upon medical principles: aml
of bciug referred by their aid to its proper place in
the animal economy. ·
ll difl'ers f1·om sleep by the performance of hearing~
of attention, of spcal~in; and of acting in a manuer
1hn.t evinces a remarkable degree of method and con-
~istcncr. There is no fevct·ish condition of her sys.
trm to countenance the supposition ofits being deliri-
um. Still less is it the moping of Jnelancholy or the:
raving of mania.
l'n f.l6mo of Hs forms, it manifests its Beal·ne&s t~t
H
hy~tcdu aud catalrpsy. It resembles renrie • though
this is so molletate in the present case, that the train
of thought may be changed by intcnogatories, with-
out rousit~g h_er. It is allied to somnambulism; though
tshe remams m a decumbent posture with her eye-lids
constantly slmt. It would not be incorrect to liken
it to the common, though <·urious, phenomena of
<lrc.amin~. !:;trictly its name is Somniloquism; at
least as far as speaking goes. The actual condition
of her faculties has such an affiinity to reYerie, som-
nambulism anll dreaming, as to induce a conviction
that it is a. kimlred malady, or an affection of the
bo<lilr and mental powers nearly associated with
them, or with one or more of the other diseases men-
1ionc.d in this paragraph.
It is reported that the 11abitation of the patient's
father WftS freqttently opened l.o b·avelling preachers,
ft·om the days of her childhoo<l to the commencement
of her present malady. \Vith a constitution readily
susceptible of religious impl'ession<;, and a correct
::mel retentive memory, she appears to have treasured
up a. la1·ge proportion of the wor1ls and phrases utter-
ed in h<'t' presence by her spidtual tcacher.s. She
can read; but not with ease, or freedom. It may
therofore be presmned that her ideas were deri,·ed
in a gt·eat measure from the public exhibitions ; aoil
~ that they have bec11 continued and rcuewe<l by con-
stant applications, While these impressions were
deepest, the age of pubctty arrived, a period when
the female frame acquires additional sensibilities,
and undcr~oes a peculiar re,·olution. For a while
she doubted whether she hall auy participation in ths
g1·eat work of redemption. DUI·ing this period her
}>arents remarked that her <'.xcrcises were gloomy
and desponding. At length she receive<l consolation;
and her nightly performances immediately became
sprightly aud cheerful. The love of her Maker was
now quickenell into a lively emotion ; ~n~ he~ desire
to be near him was followed by au adnusswu mto the
society of his ade1·ers. The attcnd:mce on worship~
"ltich with most chil(lrC'n i" an afl'air of ol.edi<>nCll or
imitation "·as now uccomr. in her a. n1~•ltcr of llcsin:
and duty.
Her tloeile and susceptible mind has undoubtedly
ht'l'll mouldcd and c.onfm·mcd hy tl1c power of hahil.
H!11l has acquired modes of thi11king .an(l of acting
\\ hich recur at periodical limes: and like some olht•t·
dist•ases. without either H1lition 01· consciousness. If
1he pal'oxysm he compan•d lo lll(lSC of the hysteric~ ot·
a.:; some lJalhologists m~ty ~uppose, of 1\1e epileptic
)dud; like them it efl'ace"' all knowledge of het·~elf,
and recollection of occurrrnces fluring the fit. lu
this s!ate. she posses~es :uli...tinct recoll<>ction ~fall
her rt'ligious information. ~he goes fut'lhrr. She
cxct·cises the faculty of inveution, h~· combiuing hc1·
ideas in new ways, by pronouncing discourses iufi-
ltilt'l,v diversified aQli<lst the sametH~ss oftopics, and
of ullel'in~ !iOmc p{1rases and mctaphill'l> that are pe-
l:ttliar to berself. And yql she fol'gets that she e\Cl'
l'!xertcd this recollP<:tion"
, or marle any use of her in-
Yenlin tJOWC!'S. 'I'he CUt1(Elion of her sensorium is
such, that devotional trains of thinking are presr~nt<d
to hu, and she gives utterance to them in v;ords. In
the main, they are very similar to those she has been
<tceustomed to hear. From these they differ about
as much as glowing and connectLd dreams vary from
waking thoughts. Th<'se images never wouJd offer
themselves during her wakeful state, on account of
the occupation of her mind and body in other pursuits.
l3ut '~hen the will ceases to preside, the latent im-
pressions gain a temporary uscend:.mcy, run their
round and disappear,
Perhaps, the most extraordinary trait in her case,
is the readiness and aptness with which she answers
tho questions by \Ybich the byc-standers interrupt the
current of her thoughts. On the principal part of •
these .h~wcver, there ~ay be o~served a profound
submtsstOn of every thtng to the dtsposal and govcrn-
:me~1t of the Most Hi.gh ; with.out entering into mor.~l.
rohttcal, OJ' economical dctalls. Such general l"C·:
{3
l'lies of lnunility and ren1·encc at·r tll(• easiest of all
to ~ivc, am\ are of no particular ot· indi,·idua.l appli-
cation ,,·hen :ma.lyzed. The:v are in their matter and
composition rcm.arkably similar, in this respect, to
the exercises when they proceed without interruption.
rl'hey have :t strong; tinctut'C of the S~l.lllC quality.
To comprehend tbe present case, let a few facts
be stated, not fl'Om the books of metaphysics or mc-
<licine, lmt from real life.
A yonn; woman is now lh'ing, who has been
known to feel a most imperative <'all to go forth and
J>reach to her neighbours and acquaintance. It has
ltappcnrd, tha.t on these occasious, the missionary
has sulfcre(l strong and regular hysteria. After a
few days, the paroxsysm usually abates, she gets well
and loses the inclination and ability to be a minister
of the wortl. She has experienced about a tlozen of
11uch fits of religious hysterics.
A layman who is accustomccl to attend regularly
the WOI'iihip of a christian society, has acquired the
habit of ri!->ing from bed and of pra~ ing and preaching
<lut·ing hi<> sleep. This man is a steady, moderate,
and respectable attendant; but bas 1;ever experienced
the call of conversion. His exercises are consonant
to those he has been accustomed to hear. He is
wholly unconscious of ever! thing relating to them;
or in other words, he has no recollection of any such
consciousness. They have this peculiarity, that when
l1e has cncle(l his sermon, he gives notice to his ~up­
vosed audicncet that the next meeting. for the special
ptll'pose he assigns, will be held ctt a particular l10ur
of a day which he mentions. He is neYer troubled
with a fit until the proposed time an·ins. He neYer
fails to obserre his own adjournments, and always
with the utmost punctuality. The periods of his par-
oxysm are regulated by his own prescription at a
preceding meeting. Always before the dismissal, lte
announces the time of the futut·c meeting. He has
been uncler this diseased habit for several years, and
is in other respects weJl. His pl~tce of performance
r~ t)te 1'1ppcr window of his hOtlSC,
H•
.lman not nlta.:hcd to any rrligious society, baa set~ ­
ou"' meclitations ofhis uwn. \Vhen volition was lost an(l
consduusnrss suspcndl'd by sleep, he performed the
cxrrci,-es of rwayer to Hod and exhortation to men
with zeal and fen-ou1·. The paroxsysm was renewed
ni:;htly • the time a little after be fell asleep; the at-
titucle, that of kneelin; in his bed. He knows noth-
ing of these transa.ctions but by information from those
who have attended him. Being rather um-estraine(l
in his religious opinions~ he owns himself atl\icted
and ashamed on being told that he ha.s become a
l'reachet in his sleep.
Durin:; ~ calamitous war, a farmer buried some
]licccs of gold in his fielcl. He forgot the spot, and
sou0ht hil'i hidden treasure, until he despaired of
success. The loss dwelt upon his minclnightand day,
an<l gave him perpetual uneasiness. At length, about
fifteen years after the concealment of the money, he
rose at nip;ht from hi~; bed in a fit of somnambulism,
and ,,·cut fol'Lh to the field. In a short time he return-
ed with the guineas in his haucl. Being obsened lo
be in a skrp-wn.lking condition, he was waked by
bis wife ancll>rou~ht to his senses. His surpl"ise wai
extreme on di!oiCO\'t•t·ing his situation. And he im.ne-
(1ia.tely related to her ancl the family the dream by
"·hich he was iustruclcd'" here. to find the p.recions
melitl, which he procluced in proofof tlle correctl!ess
or his rccollt~ction during that dream.
Abo~·: Yery much exercised by somnambulism. fell
askrp one day in the r~ligions meeting he was at1cn-
din~.. During that slerp. his c;omnambuli!'m inmd-
ed him. lt continued through tbe rising of t'he meet-
inJ;~ and durin~ his walk to his lodgings, He then
a.te his c.linuct·, went to school (it was a week day)
and performed several task~ in ca.lculation. Aftct· he
done these :uul nu-iouR other things, he sU£l<lculy ap-
}>lit>cl his ba.tHl lo his for<.'head, ruhb('d his eyes nnd
waked up. H l' in'it:mtly eufJuircd if the mecOn~ was
<lismissc11. anc\ s:lid he was ash::uul'<l of 1Hwiug; fallen
asloep. He hud a belief that he was yet in the meet-
to
in:;; aml luul lost n.1lrccol1cclion of even('' ft·om ~h~~
moment of falling asleep until the instant of tomiug;
to himself in the i'iChool. He hn.cl no recollection
whatever of taking food. walking aml ialkiug, o1· ot'
making calculations iu .Arithmetic.
I know a man who is addicted to talking in l:is
Rlccp. His conversation gcnet·ally turns upon the
hu~iness be follows. He rattles on and discourses
without the smallest reserve. The fit commonly
takes ltitn in bed. \Vhenever hi.;; wife iinds the so-
liloqny troublesome, she speaks loud to him, sbak<'R
him ancl wakes him. Then he ceases to speak, ancl
once more goes quietly to sleep. If, ou the contr~u·y,
the ladv wisltes to hear him furtl1er. she asks hint
c1ucstio~s in a. gent!<' tone, and he <li,:;closes to her
evt•ry thing he knows. He has not the faintest re-
oollcction afterwat·ds of any thing Ire has said.
It would be easy for one to write more of tl1ese liv-
ing occunences by way ofelucidation. Abunu:mcc or
them are extant, ofl'ering themselns to him ,.,·bo 'vill
gather and record them. '\bile they conYince us
that we haYe much to learn on the intricate subject of
the mind, they assure us too that we l1ave made im-
r,ortant adyances into this department of knowledge.
fhe examples adduced are sufficient to illustrate the
two conditions of the sensorium, firlit, wlu.
•n the ima-
ges excited are those of the memory chietly: and se-
eondly, when in ad(lition thel'eto, there is a degree
ef hallucination.
Miss D's case, combines the strong ideas of
memory, with probably stronger hallucinations, es-
pecially of the organ of sight. This sense, more
than any other, is active in dreaming. Hence it has
happened that extatic emotions, mental abstractions,
trances, and configuration of the sentient extremi-
ties, of the optictll nerves from internal causes, similar
tothat configuration usuallyinducedby external agents
have been denominated VISIONS. They arc so called
because the eyes are peculiarly conccrnetl. Visions
n':t·e Miu.ally ;u~~ompan1ed with a belief oftheir own. re-
tfi
aiity, on the p:trt ofthe person who expcricnccs them.
But the ln·e-::.tanclcrs arc freq11cntly unconvinced; ot
are perfectly satisfied that the objects alledged to be
seen are not realities. And this makes the di~fercncc
between hallucination or an hone::.t mistake grounded
on hallucination; and imposture, or a contrivance
tleccitfully represented a!- true.
The case or i\1r. Nicolai of Berlin, is a remark-
able instance of hallucination in the organs of sight
bcg;etting phantasms which he knew to be illusions
and which he could distinguish from realities by his
own judgment whenever they appeared in vision be-
fore him.
The particular condition of the memory deserves to
be noticed. In some instances, all that is thus seen is
remembered; in others, the memory fails to record
the ideas which for a season occupied the seusorinm.
In the present case, as in many that arc analagous to
it, there is a most remarkable display of memory, but
a total oblivion afterwards, that there had even been
such employment of the memory The whole per-
formance is like a transaction forgotten, or an image
totally eflaccd. ·
I am perfectly clear what course ofremedies ought
to be prescribed. But on the practical part of this
subject, novc:lties present themselves with a di~cour­
aging, a forbidding attitude. I have heard a senti-
ment from worthy people that it would be a pity to
cure, ''"hat th~y term, such !I divine disease. They
are persuaded that forbearance ought to be shown to
an infirmity, marked with what they fondly call, ce-
lestial symptoms They caution me uot to disturb
the \\·orkings of a di~temper, caused and hallowed as
it were, by a kind and propitious influence. T hey
urge impressivc:ly, the propriety ofpermitting the con-
tinuance of a malad), so physically ~nd morally edify-
ing \Vhen, say thc:y, the simple are instructed, and
the wise arc puzzled, by her discourses, medicine
ought to withold its he-lping hand. And why they
cry, cannot the chiefs of the faculty, make a solemn
i7
pause when asked to cure a patient, who~ Yoice in
so .peculiat· a manner enforces the precepts of the
scrtpturc, hcdews the cheeks of heauty with tea1·s, and
warns sinners to a speedy repentance?

may be able, to give glory to thy mme. \Vilt thou
appear in behalf of thy disciples who are chosen to
preach thy word, may they be men that lie low in
the valley of humiliation, servants of the Lord, who
shall preach Christ Jesus and him crucified. R..tise
faithful labourers and send them into tlw harvest, for
the harvest truly is great and labourersar~ few. Bless
thy disciples who go into the dark caverns of the
oorth to preach the gospel to the heathen ; where dark·
mss is, may light break forth, where gross darkness
is, may the sun of rigtheousness arise with healing
under his wings. How long will it be, before the
kingdoms of this world shall hecome the kingdoms
f>f our God and of his Christ, whose kingdom is, an
everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve
and obey him. How long shall I cry unto thee, and
pray that a reformation may ta~e place on the earth?
Help 0 God ! for the goodly man ceaseth ; for the
faithful fall from among the children of men. Help !
or we perish, for I am sensible and persuaded that
Y:.~in is the help of man. Put it into the hearts of our
cnc::mics to return unto their own land in peace, put
it into the hearts of this American nation to desire
peace ; I pray thee if it can be consistent with thy
will that thy judgment n:tay be removed, May .t~~

Now be with our rulers, make them to be men of pie-

Qursliolt. Arc you thirsty? will you drink water?
Ausrt'er. Y cs, hut not for the water that man drinketh,
'lJHl thirstclh for agnin, hut for the water of life. I long to
1lraw wnler out of liH~ \~ell of salvation.
(~: Are you hungry? will you eat something.
A. Y e:;, but I do not hunger for the bread n·l1ich perislt-
~th, but for that whirh endureth unto everlasting life, which
the son of man giveth.
Q. \Yilat is to become of the poor of this city, durin'
Ihe indeRlency of the ensuing winter?
F;fw sighed, and said :
A. 'l'bat is a question too difficult for me to answer. I
Jwve not the eye of God, to discern the wants of the poot· in
thi;:; great city ; nor, the understanding of the Almighty to
1lcrioe means for their relief, nor tl1e power of God to apply
it. But, one thing I know, iliat God will provide for his
oll'n. lie has said, bread shall be ghcn them, and water
shalf be made sure : and, in regard to others, l1is general
providence will supply them, for he is good and kind even
to the e,-il and unthankful, he makelh his sun to rise upon the
rvil and the good, he sendeth rain upon the just and the un-
jusl. He openclh his hand and satisfieth the desire of eve-
J'Y lh·in:?: tLing.
Q. What ought to he the conduct ofchri'itians during the
present war ?
A. They ought lo pray, acknowleclging their O\vn sin!,
nnd the sins of those among whom they dwell, whirh are the
ranse of the judj!;mcut:~ we suffer. Sin abounds in Olll' land,
and Gml has said, &hall not my soul be a' enged on such :t
nation as this! They ou~ht to pra~-, •pare thy people, and
~i'e not thy ho·l'ilagc to reproach; and, that in wrath, he
would remembct· mercy, and remo,·e present judgments, by
resIorin,. to us the hlrs<.;ing of peace. But I would warn yon
all, lhat"'thcre i.; anolher war, and a captain, who is nev~r
defeated, e\·en Jesus Christ, who make:~ war upon sm
from generation to ~cncration. He is always victorious.
AJ'Ilti> t.wemie'l shall ~e defeated and scattered. For lo 1
thine enemiec;, 0 Lord, thine enemies shall perish, 0
ye son:; and daughters of men, I entreat you to en)it;t under
the banners of the captain of ~:ahatiou, that you may be sa,ctl.
Q. You have been to Dr·. .i\Ia;,ou's church tltis evening,
and heard him preach, he is come to see you ? ·
A. I clid not obsen·e any of the ambassadors of Christ in
the assembly, but I know t!Je preacher has been with my
God, and that my God has been with him, for l beard the
tnrtb. The grand theme of a minister should ever be Christ
and him 1:rucified. l.\linistcr·s should be examples to the
flock and in eYet·y good word and work, ru1d keep low in the
valley of humiliation. They :should warn unbelieHrs, who
are blind to the things of God, for it is written, eye hath not
tieen, nor ear heard, neither ha' e entered into the lreatl of
man, the things which God bath prepared for them that Joye
him.
Q. By what means can the heart of an obdurate, rebel-
lious sinner be changed, so as to ) ield a cheerful obedience
to the will of God ?
.11.. Nothing, my friend, short of the almighty power of
God, can change the heart of a sinnet· : for, such is the dc-
t•eitfnlness and desperate wickedtJess ofthe J1eart of ml\n by
uaturc, that he would fore,er remain an enemy to God in his
mimi, by wickedness, unles~ 0 od ;;hould make his "ord like
a fire ami a hammer, to melt and l.reak his rocky heart ill
pieces. To take away the heart of "tone, is the wo;k of God,
and the new hea:t is tl1e gift of hi.., '!O\ ereign grace. Thus
sailh the Lord, a new heart also 11 ill I gi\·e you, and a new
spirit will I put within) ou ; and l ''ill take away the stony
heart out of your flesh. 0 my fellow-sinner~, unless you ex-
perience this diYine chan6e, you are undone, and mu!>t pe::ri:.h
forever: verily, verily, 1 :;ay unto you, except a 1mm Le
born again, he crumot sec the kingd •01 of God : Are you
;tsloni~hed at this uedaralion ? Uo JOil ask, how can tllCSC
things be? l\lat·Tel not that 1 :,ay unto you, ye must l,;c
born ac;ain.
Q. Wh.v cloes the Lord Yit<il his people with afirction
A. The Lord afflicts his people for the ~ame 1ea-.on that
an affectionate parent chastise, a belo' eu child. P::ll'nh;
con·ect their children because they h,,, e transgressed ~u.d
Lecn disobedient, and to ,relent tlisobcdicuce m future : l'O
the Lord cha;;tiseth his people with lite 10d of all.iction f'ot·
their sins ami offences, that they mny be brought to n·pe·nt-
um:c, anc.l lh·c in future more to his g,lory. 0 J e childn•t• uf
God, the trial:; and aillrtion>~ you cxiH!nt'nce m this wodJ,
29
aH' sent Ly your Lea\'enly fJthcr, in Jo,·e to JOUr souls, that JOU
may not be co1itlernned with the wm·ld, (llld that you may
IJc made partakers of IJis holiness ; fo1· the scripture
s.tilh, whom the Lord Iovcth he chastiseth and scourgclh
cYcry son whom he renewcth. If ye endure chastening,
God dcaleth with you as with a son ; for what son is he,
whom the Father chasteneth not? but, if yc be without chas-
tisement, whereof all arc pat·takers, then'are rc bastards and
r1ot sons.
Q. "
What is your greatest grief?
A. 1\Iy greatest gdef is, that the hand of the Lord is ly-
ing heavy upon me, and that he has made me to differ from
my brethren and sisters in a strange and unaccountable man-
JJCI'; also, that I am not ~mfficiently resigned to the will of
my hcaHnly father in this my affliction, and I also grie\ e,
because I do not lh e as near to God as I should.
Q. What dress do you like best ?
:t. And do you ask me, my friend, this question? I must
tell you that I do not give myself to such vain things as on-
ly please the carnal heart. I am not anxious about the gar-
mcuts which conr my poor body ; tl1cse garments soon
:;row old and wear o!'t· But I desire toLe clothed with my
redeemer's ri~hteousnt!ss. This is the dre:;:; which will be
acceptable to~God. I would ad,·ise you all to seck the gar-
ments which never ~o to decay: e,·en fo be clothed "ith
the robe of Christ's righteousness; or you will not be able to
abide the awful justice of the Altnighty at the clay ofjudgment.
Q. 'Vhat would m:tka you rich ?
A. Nothing, nothin~, but the grace of my Saviour. Si!-
nJ' and gold I seek not. I would giYe, al!iO, the world and
its posse!'isions, if I had them, for the g1 ace and Jo, e of my
God. The riches aml wealth of this world are Yery pleas-
ing to the carnal eye, but I perceiYe they at·e allunsatisf} in;;
yPa, like the chaff which the wind dri\elh away. 0 ye
rhiltlren of men, seek not the riches which please the carnal
eye, but I, C\·en I, exhort you to seek dumulc ricJJes and
ri!':ltteousness, to lay up for yoursclrcs treasure, in heaven ;
to be rich in t:1ith and good wot·ks ; to sccl~ the riches of the
grac•~ of OoJ.
(~. \Yhy do you exhort yom· fcllon-·~inuers in this manner:
A. ])o yon ask me why I call on Zion to arise and sl:akt:
herself from the dust, and put on her beautiful garments ~
h••rause it is the will of my God lhal I ~hould. If it were
uot, my carnal heart would neYer permit me to undertah.c it.
Jt i" al~rortling to tl1at pror!:e~y, and it !>bll come to pa:.s in
the last day<', saith God, I' will pour out of my spirit upon all
flesh, and yom· !>ons and your dau~;htcrs shall prophet>.}, auJ
your young men shall see vi<~ions, and your old men shall
dream dream;;, and on my servant~, and on my haudmai-
dens I will pour out iD those days, of my spirit ami they
shall prophesy.
Q. Have you re·ason to believe that you have an interest
in this Jesus of whom you haYe just been speaking?
A. I must acknowledge I have many doubt<; ancl fl'ar~ .
'Vhen I vie1v the unholy exercises of my sinful heart, whrn
J see my short comings in duty, my want of sufficient lc.1 r:
to God, neglect, ofrcli.2;ious duties, ar:d murmurings again't
the dealings of Pro,idence towards me, I am sometimes let!
to doubt whether I have any interest iu the redemption of
Christ. But, at other times, when I remember, that, if I lmd
never recei,·eu tli,•ine grace, I should uot lo>c God at all, J
should not grieve that I love him so little, I should no!
mourn for my iniquities and short-com~n;,-; in duty. I am con-

"as nof'a reluctance called in to resist our inti,·itity; it wa!!
female delicacy, busy in secreting a defo1·mity.
She informed us that she had been in this way about two
years, and was not sensible of any bodily disorder which
should occasion it. She is of the baptist sect, and forma-
ny years bas been a zealous and fervent dnolee, and when
~;Jeeping, la:r mind, taking the pious tendency of her wak-
ing !tours, appears to be wholly occupied with suhject.s of
reli:;ion.
On thill head she appears to be intuitively prepared to
meet qu<!stions the most dark and abstruse. She answers
with promptnc~s, with multifarious remark, right onward,
witlwut repetition, to a total exhaustion of her subject, and
not unfrequently of herself. These facts, the people with
whom she lived, and who l1ad been acquainted with her
from her infancy, united in confirming, The object of our
visit being attained, and our curiosity more strongly excit-
ed, we retired to a neighbour's for :m hour, and returned to
full gratification. She had been in bed some time, and in
a few moments we heard her commence, the doors were
thrown open and we all entered. It was a stormy inclement
night, antl 30 or 40 auditors only attended, it was not un-
common, we were informed, for three or four hundred to be
present.
She opened with a prayer ofhalf an hour, and deliveretl
herself with great distinctness, in a clear, harmonious, un-
hesitating ami animated tone of Yoice, with much devotional
zeal and attractiug fen our; when through, she sighed and
groaned as in bodily anguish for ten or twelve minutes, he.r
chest hove, she grated her teeth and eatched her breath, a$
one does with a palpitation of the heart.
At a proper interval, so!IIe one who belonged to the house,
calling her mildly by her name, observed that elder some-
body, his name I forget, had come some distance to see her.
On this, she laboured a moment as for breath, when she com-
menced, and went through with, a most elegant exhortation,
addressed to him personally, on the subject of his duties;
urging him to diligence, assitluity and perseverance in his
calling, painting in colours of delirious ecstacy, the pleasures
of the life to come, for the life well spent; and denouncing;
in awful solemnity, with the shuddering terrors of eternal
damnation, the sentinel who slumbered or winked upon the
watch-tower, intel'larding her discourse with many pertinent
iCriptural aUvsi1ms, and in a copiousness •f lan~ua~e, v.·hiclt
i'iHlccd very much astonishe1l ws. Xhc elder in the meaJi
time,
"---pale, amazed,
All gaze, all wonder --,"
Eyin.g, in tremulous meeknes~, the oracular corpse which
lay befor·e him, in t.leep, dead sleep, interwove the senti·
ments which drop! frorn it, with the awful mysteries of a
p1·eternatural, "Saul! Saul! why persecutes! thou me!"
and wept in silent obsequiousness. Jn fact, tbe deep atten-
tion of the auditor~;, the sigh'i of the women, the pattern of
the hall, the ho,ding of the tempest, united with the speak-
in~?; <'Orp;;;c, as it appeared uttering its awful war·nings to mor·
tality, offered one of tho~e moments of retirement to the
soul, when we shudder and sbh·er in sublimity, like a cul-
prit at Rome, with his heel.; to the precipice; indeed, I
was ten times within an ace of <'oiling up my logic and unit~
ing: in the sympathies of the crowd.
Having finished he: address to the elder, she relapsed
a.~ain into the same convulsiong which she had in her first
interval, but ·visibly in greater pain: it was the contortion
of au incubus; it was the lnst conscious grasp of life to it~
fixture; she was as colourless as dead.
This unexpected anti frightful debility of the young bdy
excitell our curiosity, and gaYe rise to a con~ersation with
'ihc lady of the house upon the tinhject. She told us that
three nights before, the company had !'O multiplied ques-
tions upon her that she was drinn fo a state of the mo,l
alarming exhaustion, and whenevcr thi.s happened it requir-
ed six, eight, and sometirne!:i fen days of kind attention,
caulion and forbearance to recruit her. \\'e were very ~Or·
ry for this infol'lnation, as we wc1·e obliged to give over ask-
in~ her many questions with wbirh we had come prepared.
The company on this information immediately broke up
and we retired.
l\ow, friend \Yilliam, what uo you think of all this? get
;•lou~ as soon as possible \\ ith all your doubts; take it as a
fart that it is no imposture; no delusion; and then le£ me
J:ear from you. [X. r. Co)umbian]
