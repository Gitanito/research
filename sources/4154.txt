 This is as close to an old-fashioned spiritualist journal as can be found at such a late date outside the institutional spiritualist journals: articles on photographing spirits, Abraham Lincoln as a spiritualist, and psychic detectives, courses on developing spirit communications, and even an advertisement for "Eckel's Standard Trumpet" ($2.00-$3.00) through which the spirits could communicate.  The general transformation of spiritualism, however, also allowed the journal increasingly to carry a number of articles on the "higher attainments," the amalgam of New Thought-occultism with spiritualism: articles on, "Mind, the Master-Builder," suggestion, healing, Brahmavidya, auras, "the sixth sense," astrology, "Atlantis: History or Legend?" together with regular "Theosophical Talks."  Regular contributions by Cabir Premel el Adaros, Yacki Raizizun, J.F.C. Grumbine, and Henry Frank, as well as a column on astrology and psychic phenomena occurring at Danielson's institute in Chicago.  She was a medium and began her career in St. Louis, later moving to Chicago, where she combined the journal with her Psychic Power Research Association which gave weekly classes on developing psychical powers and communicating with the dead.
