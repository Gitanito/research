            		Experience Description:   

I was walking down Whitstable high street at night, when a mugger attacked me. I resisted his attacks, but he still pushed me into the road.  A car hit me. Doctors said I was dead on the scene, but one still attempted to revive me. He succeeded. Whilst I was dead, I saw the future. The world was covered in flames, and then Jesus spoke to me, he said 'Spread the word, and this will not happen, my son.'
