  		              		Experience Description   

    Years ago, I had a seizure in the middle of the night.  I woke up, exhaled an absolute horrific scream and I felt myself exit my body.  It was like a "pop" accompanied by a very loud "whooshing" noise.  I flew up at an incredible speed and could see my body lying still on the mattress.  I also heard what I described later as the sound of wild animals, like a horse or something.  Anyway, when I "arrived" I was in a very dark place.  I could see all around me but I had no form and there was nothing to see because all was black.  I was there for a bit and then felt myself rushing back into my body with a "thunk" while I was in the ambulance being transported to the hospital.  Then I went back to the "void" again, same thing as before.  Then I woke up about 3 days later in a hospital bed with no memory of anything in between.  I also felt physically exhausted.  And that's it, nothing too dramatic just adding one more data point.
