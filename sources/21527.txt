I HOPE YOU'LL SOON BE WELL
Phenomma; I'm sorry you're sick;
I'm sorry you're not on the air;
That, of course, is of second import,
Your 11oice going everywhere;
You have a mission in serving, you know,
In a great and far reaching field-
A part of you that no moner could bur,
You give, in this service rou yield.
Life in a mass stretches out th.ere until
The horizon makes it grow dim;
You're standing before a microphone
With their wish, or question, or whim
1That comes to you from out this throng
While you take the knowledge you own
And pass it out on the Ether Waves
To some poor soul, fighting, alone-
This multitude, reaching everywhere,
All made up of 11.nits, like me,
You separate, as you deal with each,
Giving them individualitr-
y our voice, as it reaohes the thousands
Shows patience I cannot conceive
While rou answer the same old question
In an effort some mind to relieve.
Now you are sick-I miss you so much
And I'm hoping you soon will be well:
I have onlr one war to help rou in this
And that, perhaps I should not tell-
But I learned a secret-not so long ago-
When I had to stand all alone,
I learned that God gave no promise, in words,
That I could not claim for mr own-
So I'm asking Him, when I think of you,
That He'll touch the thing that went wrong
And send you back-in the service you give
Without pain, once again well and strong-
] think you will know that I am sincere
And believe in the work that you do
Br the first impression that comes to rou
As you're glancing, these few lines through.

THE AUTHOR.
MOTHER SHIPTON'S PROPHECY
Mother Shipton's Prophecy is known the world over. She must
have been a seer. It is perhaps the most famous prophecy in history.
Moreover, all the events predicted have come true, with the excep·
tion of the last one. The world has not yet come to an end.
Mother Shipton's Prophecy is said to have been published
originally in the fifteenth century.
Here is what she said:
Carriages without horses shall go,
And accidents fill the world with woe.
Around the world thoughts shall fly
In the twinkling of an eye.
Waters shall yet more wonders do ;
Now strange, but shall be true.
The world upside down shall be,
And gold be found at root of tree.
Through hills men ~hall ride,
And no horse or ass be at his side.
Under water men shall walk,
Shall ride, shall sleep, shall talk.
In the air men shall be seen,
In white, in black, in green.
Iron in the water shall float,
As easy as a wooden boat.
Gold shall he found, and found
In a land that's not no·,v known.
Fire and water shall wonders do,
England shall at last admit a Jew.
The world to an end shall come
In eighteen hundred and eight-one.

ASTROLOGY
At night when twilight was faJ,ling,
Our eyes were lifted towards the sky,
And as we viewed the different planets
We wondered what they were and why.
Now Science has come to our rescue,
We have astrologers by the score,
They tell us where these planets are
And what they are really for.
They say we are ruled by the planets,
Each person having their own;
They tell us what the stars foretell,
Otherwise, we might never have known.
I know of one great astrologer-
Phenomena is his ·name,
I personally believe that his picture
Should be placed in the "Hall of Fame."
So girls, if you're hunting a husband, ·
And don't know where he can be-
!ust write in and ask Phenomena,
He'll describe him to a T.
Just tune in to WJAY,
He's at the Cleveland station,
And I'm sure you'll hear your answer
As he is heard al,l over the nation.

"'
THE SCIENCE OF ASTROLOGY
~HE influence of the heavenly bodies over the human race
~ was well known to the Ancients. ASTROLOGY is fre-
quently mentioned in the Bible. During the Dark and
Middle Ages, mankind became material and gross and also de-
veloped the vicious habit of refusing to believe whatever might
be hard to understand. During that period, much that was true and
much that would help us was either lost or put aside. According
to an article in the New York Tribune, Roger Bacon, a scientist
of the thirteenth century had a wide knowledge of the most mod-
ern sciences, such as microscopes, engines and airplanes, but put
his knowledge in a secret cipher to safeguard his life, since he had
already been imprisoned for knowing too much!
The Standard Dictionary quotes Si; Walter Scott as writing: The
belief in Astrology was almost universal in the middle of the
seventeenth century." Now, Science is busy recovering the hid-
den facts and coming into its own. It is probable that more people
now actually believe, or at least refuse to disbelieve, in the science
of Astrology than at any previous period in the history of the
world. The more intelligent a person, the less likely he is to as-
sert that he KNOWS that the sun and moon, for instance, have no
influence on human fate, even while he is compelled to admit that
they do actually control the tides of the sea and profoundly in-
fluence the sprouting of seed, the growth of vegetation and the
quality of the harvest.
Light comes from the sun, moon and stars. Scientists have
proved beyond question that certain hidden qualities of light, such
as the ultra-violet and the infra-red rays, profoundly affect the
moods, temper, mentality and physical health of all humans. This
is precisely just one single phase of what the ancient astrologers,
unskilled though they were in such modern scientific instruments
as the telescope and spectroscope, maintained and were even
burned at the stake for!
They held that the sun, moon and stars, including the planets,
influenced the physical and mental life of man. Such is the ad-
vance of science that at this day not one single honest scientist, even·
though he is an' atheist, can squarely deny that such are facts. Let
us prove it. Light comes primarily from the sun. Sunlight in-
fluences profoundly all life, vegetable and animal, on land and
in the depths of the sea. Who can admit these facts-and all must
-and yet maintain that the heavenly bodies have no influence on
fate! Yet even within the memory limits of the youngest child
who can legally enter alone a Movie House in New York City to-
day, people have been arrested while claiming that such things
were true!
35
I 36 SECRETS OF INDIA
Science advances steadily, stumbling at times, but honestly and
surely climbing high and higher. Much has been learned re·
cently about sunlight itself, but not all there is to know. Man
has not yet even succeeded in perfectly reproducing sunlight,
though many scientists have tried. When these efforts are com·
pletely and entirely successful we may look forward to seeing the
fundamental principles of the Science of Astrology taught as a
common subject in our public schools.
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A CAPRICORN PERSON,
BORN BETWEEN DEC. 22 AND ]AN. 19
CAPRICORN is the last sign of the Earthly Triplicity. It gov·
erns the knees of the Grand Man. This is the sign of the "Goat."
It is not to be taken in its slangy sense. The language of Astrology
was fixed thousands of years ago. The dominant characteristic of
those born under Capricorn is the extremes of their moods. You
will be happy and cheerful one day, even though bothered and
annoyed, and on another you are gloomy and wish to be left
alone, even though there is plenty of reason to be bright and cheer·
ful at the moment. You have a serious streak, even in your hu-
mor, and the highest respect for those whose brains are highly de-
veloped. You greatly dislike interference and are quite willing
to let other people do as they choose as long as they do not spoil
your plans. You are much inclined to plan things out and really
do more planning ahead than you probably realize. Capricorn
people are organizers but often have the defect of trying to do too
many things at once. You are much more contented when working
for yourself than others.
Clear thinking, sadness, brilliancy are all common traits among
those born under your sign. The following are all Capricorn
people: Rudyard Kipling, who could make a story out of a horse-
shoe nail; General "Mad Anthony" Wayne, who simply couldn't
stop fighting; Alexander Hamilton, one of the geniuses who created
a government; arrogant, princely John Hancock, the first signer of
the Declaration of Independence when signing at all meant at the
risk of being hanged; Benjamin Franklin, the homespun diplomat
who beat the cleverest of the world at their own game; Daniel Web-
ster who made the Halls of Congress ring with an eloquence that
has not since been equalled; Robert E. Lee, who though he fought
on the wrong side, fought so well and so honorably that his enemies
respected him most; Edgar Allan Poe, who wrote the "Raven" and
lived a life of melancholy and privation.
Your governing planet is Saturn. Your birth stones are the
moonstone and the white onyx. Your astral colors are brown,
silver-gray and black. Your flower is the white rose.
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE 37
FoR THosE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If you were born between Dec. 22 and 27, both inclusive, you are
a "Cusper" and should read the explanation at the top of this page.
Varying in degree, the foregoing is to be modified as follows:
You are less given to unreasoning moods of despondency; more
democratic; more observant and critical of others, and more fond
of children. You are less likely to fall in love on impulse but when
you do, you are more likely to be constant in your affections. Your
tastes are more exacting. You want the best of everything.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
As a person born under the Earthly Triplicity, you will do well
to choose as an intimate companion, a close friend or in marriage,
one of the following: A Taurus person (one born between Apr. 21
and May 21); a Libra person (Sept. 24 to Oct. 23), or a Virgo per-
son (Aug. 24 to Sept. 23.) That is a wider field to select from than
most people have. You should bear in mind, however, that you
can find more than your fair share of happiness with those born
under other signs, provided you frankly recognize the fact that
you must make allowances for differences in individuality and dis-
position. Even with those recommended, you must not expect
harmony without some sacrifice but with the others just meet
each other half way without demanding perfection when you can-
not give it in return.
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A PISCES PERSON'
BORN BETWEEN FEB. 20 AND MAR. 21
PISCES is the sign of the FISH-the last sign of the Watery
Triplicity. It governs the feet of the Grand Man or Microcosm. It
is unfortunate that a silly bit of common slang should make it
sound unplea-
sant to speak of one as a "Fish" person. As a matter
of fact, as you will see clearly very shortly, the characteristics of a
Pisces person are quite the opposite from modern slang. Astrology
is many thousands of years old and slang changes from month to
month. The dominant quality of Pisces people is a great, strong,
beautiful tenderness and loyalty. This is frequently carefully
hidden from view and gives just the opposite impression. Pisces
people are sensitive and if their lot in youth has been such that
their feelings have been hurt overmuch, they have learned in self
defense to hide their true natures under a gruff or even harsh ex-
terior.
A Pisces person who tries to "work" other people has a soul bent
by accident, like the cripple with a twisted knee. It is not natural.
Among prominent Pisces people are Voltaire, the Frenchman who
fought shams so valiantly; Joe Jefferson, the actor, whose life was
all sweetness; Buffalo Bill, George Washington and Phil Sheridan,
I
I
38 SECRETS OF INDIA
who fought more for others than for themselves. Chopin, Carl
Schurz and Mrs. Browning were Pisces people.
You are naturally magnetic and one of your peculiar gifts, if
you would only take it seriously and develop it, is that of produc-
ing results by laying on of hands. As is the case so often, with
those who are naturally generous and honest, if early circumstances
of life have dwarfed or twisted your natural bent, you are prone
to go to the other extreme and be actually worse than those who
are horn with less nobility in their nature. Such a thing is a
tragedy hut fortunately it is much easier for Pisces people to re-
form than for many others, on account of the strong natural ten-
dency towards the beautiful and the fine. Do not become hard
and hitter towards others, because of a selfish few. Your governing
planets are Jupiter and Neptune. Your astral colors are white,
pink, emerald-green and black. birth stones: chrysolite, pink-
shell, moonstone. Flower: violet.
FoR THOSE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If horn between Feb. 20 and 26, both inclusive, the foregoing is
to be modified in accordance with the explanation of the "Cusp"
at the top of this page, as follow : Varying in degree, as ex-
plained, you are more business-like in your kindnesses; have little
selfish streaks in your generosity that you cannot explain even to
yourself; more likely to make quick promises and forget them; but
without any intention of doing harm; less hurt by disappointment
and more inclined to be flirtatious. Better taste in dress and
colors.
CoMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETc.
Since your sign is the last of the Water Triplicity, you will do
well to choose as an intimate companion, a close friend or in mar-
riage, a Virgo person (born between Aug. 24 and Sept. 23). Next
best, a Capricorn person (bern between Dec. 22 and Jan. 20).
Gemini persons (May 22 to June 21) are practically as good among
the specially desirable for you. You should understand with exact
clearness that among those born under other signs you can find
those who will give you great happiness-much more than your
share-PROVIDED each of you realizes clearly and distinctly
that the other has personal faults and peculiarities, and that no one
high a right to demand perfection without giving same.
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR AN AQUARIUS PERSON,
BORN BETWEEN JAN. 20 AND FEB. 19
AQUARIUS is the "Water Bearer," the last sign of the Air
Triplicity and governs the legs of the Grand Man. Birth under
this sign gives you extremes in character that are not found under
other signs. It gives a combination of strength and weakness.
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE 39
You are naturally endowed with great possibilities and under the
right outward circumstances you could quicKly reach the supreme
heights. That is your strong point-the rare ability to BE and DO.
With it is the weakness that without encouragement and apprecia-
tion, you get discouraged and let things slide as you would not
dream of doing when filled with enthusiasm. Alone on a desert
island, like Robinson Crusoe, you would be listless, careless and
indifferent but when working in the surroundings you are best
fitted for, with the right associates, you are capable of inspiring the
love and admiration that is usually reserved for actual genius.
Under favorable conditions, you are apt to ask sincerely for ad-
vice and then fail to follow it or to ask questions and forget the
answers. Let the conditions change to the ideal and even strangers
want your opinion. The world history teems with instance of
Aquarius people reaching the heights and the depths. Among
them are: Stonewall Jackson, worshipped by his men; "Bobby"
Burns, the unfortunate Scotch genius; McKinley, the murdered
president; Swedenborg, the man who looked into the unknown;
Aaron Burr, near-president ·and vile traitor through discourage-
ment; Abraham Lincoln, worshipped and despised, carried to the
heights and finally foully assassinated.
In your own heart you know you CAN do big things, even though
your lips deny it. You are a natural born healer and your in-
fluence over the insane would seem almost magical to those who
have not this trait. If this has not yet appeared in your life, bring
it out! Your governing planets are Saturn and Uranus. Your
astral colors are blue, pink and Nile green. Youth birth stones
are sapphire, opal and turquoise. Your flower is the orchid.
FoR THOSE BoRN UNDER THE CusP
If born between Jan. 21st and 27th, both inclusive, you are a
"Cusper" and should read the explanation at the top of this page.
Varying in degree as explained, you differ from other Aquarius
people as follows: You are more skilful in business management'; a
more successful money maker and more uncertain and spasmodic
in your willingness to help others. You are less nervous hut more
skeptical and suspicious. Though all Aquarius people are original
you are even more so. You are slower in placing your affections.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
Since you are of Airy Triplicity, you would do well to choose
as an intimate companion, or as a close friend, or even in marriage,
an Aries person (one born between Mar. 21 and April 21). Next
best would be a Saggitarius person (born between Nov. 23 and
Dec. 21) . These are the people you will find easier to maintain
close relations with on an easy pleasant basis, OTHER THINGS
BEING EQUAL. You should bear in mind that no matter how
important the birth date is-and it IS important-you can find
40 SECRETS OF INDIA
much more than your fair share of happiness with those born under
the signs not mentioned, PROVIDED you make yourself meet the
other half way and carry your own share of the little "Give-and-
takes" of life. You should not forget that you, an Aquarius per-
son, are not perfect.
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR AN ARIES PERSON'
BORN BETWEEN MARCH 21 AND APRIL 20
ARIES is the head sign of the Fire Triplicity. It is the sign of
the RAM, also called the sign of sacrifice because in ancient days
the ram was the animal usually offered up in sacrifice. That does not
mean that those born, like you, in this sign are the sacrifices-not
at all. On the contrary you are more likely to sacrifice others.
Try to avoid that. Aries persons are usually the executives of the
world. They make others work for them. J. Pierpont Morgan,
Chas. Schwab, Thomas Jefferson, Washington Irving and John
Burroughs were all Aries people. Earnestness and determination
are strong features of the nature you were born with. If you have
let them die down, bring them up again. You can do it for it is
natural to you. ·
Among your faults is a slight tendency towards obstinacy. This
is particularly unfortunate because you seldom realize until after
you have thoroughly cooled off that it is really a bit of stubborness.
You think it something else at the time. You mistake it for eager-.
ness and firmness and determination, which is quite natural in an
Aries person. You can control this trait but it will take a real
effort. Since you are naturally lovable and since none are perfect,
you will find those who care for you much more willing to forgive
it in you than they would in others.
The genius of this sign is the capacity to reach results quickly.
When doing your finest work, you should not be disturbed. It is
almost impossible to hide anything important from an Aries per-
son for any real length of time. This, rightly handled, should put
you in places of honor and importance, but be careful that it does
not over-tempt you to say sharp caustic things that hurt people
you really care for and who deserve well of you. Your governing
planets are Mars and Neptune. Your astral colors are white, pink
and purple. Your birth stones are diamond, amethyst and amber.
Your flower is the tulip.
FoR THOSE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If born between March 21st and 27th, both inclusive, the fore-
going is to be modified as follows: Varying in degree, getting less
as your birth date approaches the 27th, you are more cautious,
more sympathetic, a bit less energetic, require more rest and are
less likely to be led away hy your passions. More inclined to
.
.
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE 41
keep out of trouble by watching the experiences of others. More
of the deep hidden emotions of the better sort. More talkative and
less logical, but, to make up for it, with keener intuition. To be
born under this cusp is a cause for congratulation.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
Since you are of the Fiery Triplicity, you will do well to choose
as an intimate companion, a close friend, or in marriage, a Sag-
gitarius person (born between Nov. 22 and Dec. 21). Next best
would be another person of your own sign-an Aries person. Also,
a Libra person (Sept. 23 to Oct. 23) would be suitable. If you are
a "Cusper," a Virgo or Capricorn person would likely make close
relations easy and pleasant. Understand, PLEASE, that you can
easily find in persons born under the other signs, all and more
than you are fairly entitled to in the way of happiness, but in such
cases prepare yourself for more of the "give-and-take" in little
things and realize the importance of the other party being able
to meet you at least half way.
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A TAURUS PERSON,
BoRN BETWEEN APRIL 20 AND MAY 20
TAURUS is the "Bull," the head sign of the Earthly Triplicity
and governs the throat and neck of the Grand Man. You are at
your best when you act for yourself and by yourself. If you would
advance speedily, make your plans ahead, for you are too apt to
decide on impulse and in particular to accept suggestions and go
ahead without thinking things out carefully. Your choice of
occupation is extremely important for you. Take that which you
are sure will keep you interested. History can name no brighter
stars of humanity than those Taurus people who chose their life
work wisely and then put all their energy into it. Among the
Taurus people of history are: Shakspeare, the greatest of writers;
Oliver Cromwell, who changed the history of England; the Duke
of Wellington, the hero of Waterloo; Peary, who discovered the
North Pole; Melba, the famous beloved songstress.
You have great power of concentration but are inclined to pay
too much attention to appearances. Your occasional streaks of
generosity are almost appaling. It would be much better to strike a
steadier, more even gait. You will be more successful in controlling
other people by quiet easy methods instead of trying to force things
too quickly. No matter how frail the body, Taurus people have
an inner persistence and determination that can accomplish great
things, if those things happen to be wanted badly enough. The
reason many Taurus persons have the reputation for not being
persistent and steady is because they don't really care enough
for things to go and get them. It's lack of desire.
42 SECRETS OF INDIA
Because you can be extremely affectionate towards those of
whom you are really fond, you find it easy at times to forgive the
most unreasonable things, but on the other hand, you can be the
kind of enemy that no sensible person would care to have around.
It is easier for you to advise others to "love their enemies" than
to do it yourself. Your governing planet is Venus. Your birth
stones are moss-agate and emerald. Your astral colors are lemon-
yellow and bright red, while your flower is the musk-rose.
FoR THOSE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If born between April 21 and 26, both inclusive, you are a
"Cusper" and should read the explanation at the top of this page.
Varying in degree as explained, you differ from other Taurus
people as follows: You tend more toward the mental and less
toward the physical. You are more inclined to think that every
one should believe as you believe and like what you like. You
are more impatient of stupidity in others. You think every one
should see through things as quickly and clearly as you do, which
you can't expect.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
Since you are of the Earthy Triplicity, you should consider with
special care the selection of your friends. You will do well to
choose as a close friend, an intimate companion or a mate in mar-
riage, a Capricorn person( one born between Dec. 22 and Jan 20).
It will be equally desirable to choose a Libra person (Sept. 24 to
Oct. 23). These people on account of their ruling planets should
find it easy to get along with you but please understand clearly
that you can find more than your share of happiness with those
born under other signs, provided you control your disposition
and each meets the other half way. There are two sides to every
form of companionship and it will add to your future happiness
if you bear in mind that Taurus people are not so easy to get on
with.
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A GEMINI PERSON'
BORN BETWEEN MAy 21 AND JUNE 21
The sign of GEMINI is that of the "Twins" and governs the
shoulders, arms and hands of the Grand Man. It is the head sign
of the Airy Triplicity. Its dominant characteristic is duality of
disposition. In other words, you are pulled in two opposite direc-
tions at the same time. You want to travel in foreign lands and
do not even want to go down town. While you work you feel like
playing .and when playing your conscience tells you to work. Tears
and smiles are mingled. Just when you are filled with enthusiasm
over something it's just the time you are also thinking of its defects.
'
·-!!
•
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE
In the summer you want it colder and in the winter you wish it
were warmer.
This sounds as though you were flighty and inconstant. Not at
all. It means that constantly two forces are working within you.
From this unusual situation sublime results are frequent. This
can be made clearer by mentioning some of the well known names
among those born under your sign. Walt Whitman, the eccentric
genius·poet; Brigham Young, the Mormon leader; Pope Pius X;
Jay Gould; Patrick Henry, who said, "Give me liberty or give me
death"; Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote "Uncle Tom's Cabin",
and John Wesley, who founded the Methodist Church. If you
think of this list a moment it will reveal chapters of the pecularities
of Gemini people. There is the dreamer who does things and the
"doer" who dreams. You find the extremes of religion. An added
instance of that is Dowie who called himself Elijah II.
One day you will take reckless chances that make your friends
tremble if they know. Next day, or even the same, none can per-
suade you to take a slight chance for the sake of a big gain. Back
of all this "twin" duality is a definite purpose. Down deep in
yotu heart you know that you wish to reach a certain end and no
matter how many roads there be that lead to it, you care little as
long as you finally arrive. Your astral colors are white, red and
blue. Your governing planet is Mercury. Your flower is the
sweetpea and your birthstones are beryl and sapphire.
FoR THOSE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If you were born between May 22 and 27, both inclusive, you
are a "Cusper" and should first read the explanation at the top
of this page. Varying in degree, as explained, you are more
determined, much more single minded, less emotional, less nervous,
and more apt to be misunderstood by your intimates. You are
more easily provoked to anger but get over it quicker. You are
less energetic but a better manager. You are more patient.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
Since you are of the Airy Triplicity, you will do well to choose
as a close friend, an intimate companion or in marriage, a person
born under Aquarius (between Jan. 21 and Feb. 19) or else a
Virgo person (Aug. 24 to Sept. 23). Do not imagine from this
that you cannot be happy with those born under other signs or
that you can do as you please with Aquarius or Virgo people with-
out consequences. With those born under other signs, make up
your mind to be specially careful to meet each other half way. If
you will do this, you should be able to find your full share of hap-
piness with those of other signs but still there is the advantage of
the added security with those born as recommended. Birth dates
are extremely important hut important as they are, they are not
everything! ·

CANCER is the sign of the "Crab," the head sign of the Water
Triplicity and governs the breast of the Grand Man. Modern
slang makes the language of Astrology, a science many thousands
of years old, seem peculiar. That is also true of all religions.
CANCER, as we call it, is not disease. It is a term of astronomy
like the "Tropic of Cancer." The Crab is also symbolical with
nothing funny about it. The dominent characteristic of those born
under the sign of Cancer is VERSATILITY, combined with a
certain amount of uncertainty. Fewer Cancerians, probably, be-
lieve in Astrology than other people, yet on account of the uncer-
tain elements in their nature, they need it even more than the
steady going plodders. This is because the plodder, feeling the
same way day after day, cannot help learning himself a little. The
brilliant Cancer person seldom understands himself.
One striking peculiarity of Cancerians is the tremendous enthu-
siasm with which they take hold of a new project and the way they
can carry through the apparently impossible, if properly backed
up and understood by their intimate associates. At times they
come close to setting rivers on fire. John D. Rockefeller is a Can-
cerian. Under less favorable conditions, the Cancerian will often
let go, just at the time he should play the bull dog and hold on
tight for a little longer. You need the proper backing! Farragut,
who said "Damn the torpedoes! Go ahead!" was a Cancerian
worshipped and backed up by his men. The best among Cancer
people are pure gold. Hawthorne, the exquisite novelist; Rous-
seau, the French patriot who, in his "Confessions" humiliated him-
self by opening his inner heart to the view of the world, all for the
. good of humanity; John Calvin, the reformer and father of a
branch of the Baptist Church; John Wanamaker, the great mer·
chant; Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science-all these
were born under your sign. What better proof of versatility of
Cancerians can there be than putting side by side two such genuine
leaders as Mrs. Eddy and John D.? Like them or not, as you
please, but they were LEADERS! That holds of all Cancerians
unless they were stunted or blanketed in youth so their true natures
do not show. Born in a back alley, the rest of the bunch know they
exist. Born with a gold spoon, the Cancerian is known best for
what he IS, rather than what he has. Your planet is the change-
able moon. Birth stones, emerald and black onyx. Astral colors,
green and russet brown. Your flower is the azelea.
FoR THosE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If born between June 22 and June 28, inclusive, you are a
"Cusper." Read the explanation at the top of this page. Varying
in degree, as explained, you are more self-willed; more inclined
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE 45
to flirt a little; more effectionate; more brilliant and much more
magnetic.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
As a Cancerian, you need to choose your intimates with unusual
care. Very much depends on your effort to make allowances for
the differences between yourself and others. As a close friend,
intimate companion or in marriage, you will do well to chOOl!e a
Pisces person (one born between Feb. 19 and Mar. 20). It can
be said more truly of a Cancerian than of those born under the
other signs, that your willingness to make allowance is more im-
portant than the sign he or she is born under. Other things being
equal, choose a Pisces person by all means, but because you ate
what you are, much more_:_very much more--depends on your
attitude than on the characteristics of your companion or mate.

ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A LEO PERSON,
BoRN BETWEEN JuLY 23 AND AuG. 23
LEO is the sign of the "Lion," the middle sign of the Fiery
Triplicity and governs the heart of the Grand Man. The dominant
characteristic of those born under this sign is a fighting loyalty to
those they really love. If you have not yet felt willing to run any
risk, take any chance, fight any fight, rather than see some particu-
lar person be punished unjustly, then you probably have not yet
experienced the kind of love you are really capable of feeling. You
are kind.hearted, sympathetic and carry concealed within your
deeper nature a personal magnetism the nature of which you prob-
ably do not fully realize or understand. You are apt to give way
at times to a generous impulse that carries you so far that after-
wards you wonder how in the world you could have done what
you did.
Among other marked traits of Leo people is a strong intuition.
Intuition is a word that is often misunderstood. Many think it is
just good guessing. Not so. It is an inner power to grasp things
so quickly that even the person himself often thinks it is just a
guess. That proves it is not a guess because in that particular case
he guesses wrong. The best way to make a hit with you is to stop
arguing when you once say "Yes, I understand." It often helps to
understand a sign by going over a list of those born under it that
the whole world knows about. The following are Leo people:
Commodore Perry, who sent word "We have met the enemy and
they are ours." Napoleon, almost Emperor of the world. Russell
Sage, the man who made millions by saving and letting his money
work for him. The late Cardinal Gibbons, a man who was re-
spected and admired even by those who were strongly opposed to
46 SECRETS OF INDIA
his church. Leo people often develop that streak of worn out
energy known as laziness, BUT, lazy or not, all Leo people DO
things.
Another of your characteristics can be put in few words. You
would rather plan things than carry them out, and at times are
impatient of details. Your planet is the Sun. Birth stones: ruby
and diamond. Astral colors: red and green. Your flower, the
rose;
FoR THosE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If you were born between July 24 and 30, both inclusive, you
are a "Cusper" and should read the explanations at the top of this
page. Varying in degree as explained, the foregoing is to be
modified as follows: You are much more daring; more ener-
getic; more intense; more orderly; more generous toward those
whom you do not like. You probably have a better memory than
the non-cuspers. At times you are extremely frank while on other
occasions you retire into the smallest, tighest shell you can possibly
find.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
Since you are of the Fiery Triplicity, you will do well to choose
as a close friend, an intimate companion or in marriage, either a
Saggitarius person (one born between Nov. 23 and Dec. 21) or
an Aries person (Mar. 21 to April 20). You should understand
clearly that, while the chances favor those born as mentioned, it
does not follow that they are the only people with whom you can
be happy. If you make up your mind to meet the other at least
half way with a generous give-and-take spirit, you can find much
more than your fair share of happiness with those born under other
astrological signs. W~th your power of intuition, you should
not expect everyone else to see things ·as quickly as you do, and
should remember that those who think more slowly are apt to be
right in the end. Selah!
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A VIRGO PERSON,
BoRN BETWEEN AuG. 23 AND SEPT. 23
VIRGO is the middle sign of the Earthy Triplicity and governs
the bowels, solar-plexus and spleen of the Great Man. It is the
sign of the "Virgin." One of your dominant characteristics is not
just your ability to let people know what you think of them, but
rather the fact that you cannot help letting them know. You are
afaithful, loyal friend and a painstaking sort of an enemy and
quite willing to do a good job of disliking people who treat you
unfairly. You are inclined to be domestic in your tastes but the
home must be "just so" or you feel that somewhere else is more
homelike. You deserve much more scoldings than 'you actually
•
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE 47
receive. Too many of them you dodge by making people feel so
kindly toward you that they haven't the heart to be disagreeable
with you. You have a strong tendency to take up a chance idea
and in your mind to build it up to fantistic heights that you would
not let others know for the world.
One of the strong traits of Virgo persons is their ability to con·
vince others. Leadership comes to them naturally and easily.
It is somewhat surprising to find one born under your sign who
has a profound influence over the lives of others but accepts it in
such a matter of fact way that they honestly deny any tendency
toward leadership. Some, on the other hand, positively cannot
hide it, even though they try. Among Virgo leaders are LaFayette,
the Frenchman who fought for the United States in the Revolution;
Tolstoi, the Russian philosopher who left the nobility to lead the
masses ; James Hill, the railroad pioneer of the Northwest; Ex-
president Taft; Porfirio Diaz, the Dictator of Mexico; Queen Wil-
helmina of the Netherlands, who, though born a queen, insisted
on being a real queen and leading her people; James Gordon Ben·
nett, founder of the New York Herald.
The hands of Virgo persons are frequently charged with great
curative powers. This trait should be carefully cultivated as it is
not only helpful to the possessor but to all who come in close con·
tact. The governing planet of Virgo persons is Mercury. The
birth stones are pink jasper and emerald. The astral colors are
gold and black, speckled with blue dots, and the flower is the
gardenia.
FoR THOSE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If you were born between Aug. 24 and 29, both inclusive, you
are a "Cusper" and should read the explanation at the top of this
page. Varying in degree, as explained, you are more logical;
more energetic; more fond of creature comforts; more magnetic;
more tactful and more patient with opposition to what you regard
as important principles of life.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
Since you are of the Earth Triplicity, you will do well to choose
as a close friend, an intimate companion or in marriage, one born
under your own sign. This is one of the rare cases when like
befits like. Next best are Libra persons (those born between Sept.
24 and Oct. 23) or those born under Saggitarius (Nov. 23 to
Dec. 21). You are fortunate in having a nature so adaptable. You
should understand that while those born under the signs mentioned
are recommended, it does not mean that you cannot be happy with
those of other signs. If you unite with others, you should make
up your mind to meet the other at least half way in making allow·
ances for differences in temperament and disposition. It takes two
always to make any relationship pleasant. One cannot do it all.

ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A LIBRA PERSON,
BoRN BETWEEN SEPT. 23 AND OcT. 23
LIBRA is the sign of the "Scales" and is the middle sign of the
Airy Triplicity. It governs the loins and reins of the Grand Man.
It has been said that all the bad luck in the world ought to be
visited on Libra people because it hurts them less than it does
others. Dominant characteristics of those born under this sign is
the quickness with which they "bob up serenely" after misfortune.
A marked instance of this is the divine Sarah Bernhardt, the great-
est actress of a century, who held her audiences spellbound though
over seventy and with a leg amputated. Libra people often turn
misfortune into a positive advantage. Cervantes, one of the great-
est writers of all history, wrote "Don Quixote" in jail. But there
is no reason to suppose that their ability to stand bad luck gives
Libra people more than their share. Another striking feature of
Libra natives is a secret longing for new sensations, carefully con-
cealed, as a rule, except in reckless moments.
Libra people are magnanimous and are often embarrassed to
find that all people are not the same. They have a sense of justice
that, unless perverted, is keen and beautiful. This also carries with
it disadvantages. Just as a delicate watch will not stand the
rough handling a cheap alarm clock will stand, so it is with the
finer senses of those born under Libra. Once yield to the tempta-
tion to be dishonest and the delicate sense of honor is badly dam-
aged. That accounts in part for the large number of reckless
gamblers born under Libra who, in spite of their calling, can be
depended on absolutely to keep their word in money matters.
Another trait is the red-blooded love for a real fight in a good
cause. Admiral Lord Nelson, the hero of Trafalgar; honest rugged
old Oom Paul Kruger, the fighting Boer and scrappy old Zachary
Taylor, president of the United States, are instances. Without
the fight but with the love of justice was William Penn, the quiet
Quaker who founded Pennsylvania and was loved by the Indians.
Your governing planet is Venus. Your birth stones are the dia-
mond and the opal. Your astral colors are a jet black, a brilliant
crimson and a light blue. Your flower is the goldenrod.
FoR THOSE BORN UNDER THE Cusp
If you were born between Sept. 24 and 29, both inclusive, you
are a "Cusper" and should read first the explanation at the top
of this page. Varying in degree, as explained, the foregoing is to
be modified as follows: You have a greater power of concentration
and are inclined to be steadier. You have a stronger love for the
good things of life but have your appetites under better control.
As you are more tactful, you are less apt to offend strangers but
more likely to hurt the feelings of your intimates.
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE 49
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
A Libra person should choose as a close friend, intimate com·
panion or as a mate in marriage, either a Saggitarius person (one
born between Nov. 23 and Dec. 21) or one born under Aquarius
(Jan. 21 to Feb. 19). Next best is one born under Aries (Mar. 21
to Apr. 20). It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the above,
though a scientific indication of the best characteristics for you to
seek, it does NOT mean that you cannot he happy with those horn
under other signs. It does mean that with the others, you should
be more careful to make due allowances for the fact that your
dispositions are not perfectly attuned, one to the other, and that a
human give-and-take in the little things of life is of real importance.
Do that and you pave the way toward genuine happiness. Selah!
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A SCORPIO PERSON,
BoRN BETWEEN OcT. 23 AND Nov. 22
SCORPIO is the middle sign of the Water Triplicity-the sign
of the "Sco11pion." It governs the groins, etc., of the Grand Man.
One of the marked traits of Scorpio persons in the peculiar ability
they have with their hands, combined with their frequent lack of
appreciation of this gift. It is not unusual to hear a Scorpio person
say to one having difficulty "Let me do that," and then disclaim
any special skill or dexterity. It is unfortunately very easy for
those born under this sign to blunt their naturally kindly and
generous natures and develop cruel streaks to such an extent that
others believe them to be naturally cruel. When this happens,
the Scorpio person despises himself in secret for this trait. There·
fore, as a reaction, the highest regard for the welfare of others is
easily developed. It seems to depend almost entirely on how the
Scorpio person gets started. An excellent illustration is found in
two Scorpio natives, "Ben" Butler and Roosevelt. Butler was
accused of great severity as a general in the Civil War, while Roose·
velt, even more of a fighter, was kindly and considerate to the
highest degree.
Another peculiar trait of Scorpio people is that they are almost
never indifferent to water. The more rugged love the ocean and
dream of ocean travel while the idea terrifies, though fascinates,
the frail. There are but few Scorpio people who, when they have
read something they particularly like, do not have a real longing
to he numbered among the famous writers. Many Scorpio people
are, as, for instance: Macauley, the great one of the greatest ro·
manticists; Voltaire, the French genius, and the historian; Bryan,
the poet; Ella Wheeler Wilcox; Robert Louis Stevenson, great
Paderewski.
Scorpio people, as a rule, want results and want them quick.
They are inclined to hurry too fast and not look the road over
50 SECRETS OF INDIA
carefully enough, hut because they want results and are energetic,
they usually get them. The governing planet of Scorpio natives is
Mars. Birth stones: topaz, aquamarine. Astral colors: black,
golden brown. Flower: carnation.
FoR THOSE BORN UNDER THE Cusp
If you were born between Oct. 24 and 29, both inclusive, you
are a "Cusper" and should read the explanation at the top of this
page. Varying in degree, as explained, the foregoing should be
modified as follows: You have more of the "Don't care!" in you.
You are more original. You are more inclined to go to extreme
-both o.f them. Less inclined to scold and find fault. Much more
cautious. More susceptible to flattery. More willing to take risks.
An almost uncanny ability to get out of scrapes.
CoMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETc.
As a Scorpio person, you will do well to choose as a close
friend, an intimate companion or as a partner in marriage, a
Virgo person (one born between Aug. 24 and Sept. 23). You
must not, with your disposition, expect real happiness without
making a real effort to avoid misunderstandings and jealousies.
You should also understand, please, that you can find more than
your fair share of happiness with those born under other signs
provided you are willing to forgive and ask forgiveness; make a
real effort to allow for differences in temperament; make little
concessions and sacrifices willingly; and not fail to put affection
into words and actions. An invaluable hint to the husband or wife
of a Scorpio person is not to become an old fogy and forget the
"sweetheart" days. Selah!
ASTROLOGICAL READING FOR A SAGGITARIUS PERSON,
BoRN BETWEEN Nov. 22 AND DEc. 21
SAGGITARIUS, the sign of the "Archer," is the last sign of the
Fiery Triplicity. It governs the thighs of the Grand Man. Sag-
gitarians are such quick thinkers and get the answer to a question
so easily that they are peculiarly liable to be misunderstood. This
is because they see as others do not see and as a result are some-
times accused of bluffing even when they are sincere, and of guess·
ing when they really do know. Without meaning to give offense,
Saggitarians sometimes hurt their intimates by their unintentional
bluntness just because they say what they think without stopping
to figure out how it may sound to others with different view points.
Whether it hurts or not, what you say has its effect on others and
it is usually about what you want it to be in the long run.
A dominant characteristic of Saggitarians is a wholesome sense
of humor and the ability to get what they really go after in all
YOUR CHARACTER AND HOROSCOPE 51
seriousness. Some times they do not really GO, but if they do,
they arrive. That, combined with a natural kindliness and interest
in other people helps the Saggitarius native to make money, make
friends, gain fame. Among those born under your sign who GOT
what they went after, are: Andrew Carnegie, who dipped up money
by the bucketfuls until he tired of it and then enjoyed himself
giving it away. Mark Twain, who wanted to be a pilot on the
Mississippi and was one, and then just for fun decided to be a
humorist and became the greatest of them all; Joel Chandler
Harris, whose "Uncle Remus" stories still make little children
shivery with excitement. Milton, the poet, who wrote "Paradise
Lost." Dean Swift, who wrote "Gulliver's Travels." Whittier,
the Quaker poet; William Lloyd Garrison, who wrote to abolish
slavery when to do so invited trouble. He got both the trouble and
the freedom of the slaves.
Generosity, fairness, love of excitement and willingness to take
a change are all qualities common to Saggitarians. Their govern-
ing planet is Jupiter; astral colors, gold, red, green; birth stone!!;
carbuncle, diamond, turquoise; flower, the clover.
FoR THOSE BoRN UNDER THE Cusp
If you were born between Nov. 23 and 28, both inclusive, you
are a "Cusper" and should read first the explanation at the top
of this page. Varying in degree, as explained, the foregoing is to
be modified as follows: You have more energy and determination.
(Carnegie was a "Cusper.") More strict as a "boss" or disciplin-
arian; more like!y to be pessimistic; bolder; more fond of a
kindly word of praise; more brilliant and less constant in your
relations with others; more inclined to fret over trifles.
COMPANIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
As you are of the Fiery Triplicity, its negative pole, you will do
well to choose as a close friend, an intimate companion or in mar-
riage, one of the following: an Aquarius person (one born between
Jan. 21 and Feb. 19); . another under your own sign; an Aries
person (Mar. 21 to Apr. 20). You should bear carefully in mind
that, though the birth date of the other party is important-and it
IS important- you can readily find more than your fair share of
happiness with those born under other signs, provided you make
a sincere effort to do your share in avoiding causes for dissention
and jealousy; that you meet the other at least half way in making
things pleasant and without being too particular about not going
even more than half way. Give and take and you both win. Selah!
PALMISTRY MADE EASY
GIVING THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE
LANGUAGE OF THE HAND
To READ THE PALMS
The student when reading the palms or hands should have both
hands of the subject before him. The left hand reveals his char-
acter and disposition; the right hand shows his fate, vocation,
talent, etc. The left hand is what he is; the right hand is what he
makes himself. After making a short study you will be able to
decide which hand to go by. That is to say, the lines on the left
hand are strengthened by those on the right; if there are .Fate,
Heart and Marriage lines on the left hand and not in the right hand,
the subject does not possess the strong qualities they denote.
The easiest and best way to read the hands is, first to note the
Type of Hand, whether Square, Conic or other shape, tells what
this type of hand denotes. Then go to the Thumbs and Fingers,
thence to the Lines and Mounts, thus following out the arrange·
ment of this book.
PALMISTRy MADE EASY
CHAPTER l.
There are seven different types of hands, as follows:
The Square or Energetic Hand.
The Spatulate or Inventive Hand.
The Conic or Artistic Hand.
The Philosophic or Nature Hand.
The Psychic or Pleasure-loving Hand.
The Mixed or the Unmastered Hand.
The Elementary or Brutal Hand; this type of hand I have
omitted, as it is rarely found. This style of hand has a coarse and
clumsy palm and fingers, with poor development, and denotes an
animal and brutal nature such as a savage possesses.
There are seven mounts, four under the fingers, two under the
thumb and one on the side of the Palm, as follows:
Under the first finger, Mt. Jupiter.
Under the second finger, Mt. Saturn.
Under the third finger, Mt. Sun.
Under the fourth or little finger, Mt. Mercury.
Under the thumb, Mt. Venus and Mt. Mars.
On the side of the Palm, Mt. Luna.
There are six main lines on the Hand, which are as follows:
The Life Line, which surrounds the Thumb.
The Head Line, which lies in the center of the Hand.
The Heart Line, which lies high up on the Palm.
52
:i' I
PALMISTRY MADE EASY 53
The Fate Line, which commences at the wrist or above and runs
up toward the fingers.
The Marriage Line, which lies on the outside of Palm.
The Vocation Line, which runs parallel with the Fate Line.
SQUARE HAND
CHAPTER II.
The Square Hand has a square palm, with either short or long
fingers, the tips of the fingers square, the nails short and square,
the skin usually firm and hard. This type of hand denotes a per·
son full of energy of purpose, conforming to theory, methodical,
and orderly, punctual and precise nature, a slave to habit, fond
of home and domestic life, sincere and strong in friendship, up-
right and strong in principle. The one great fault of its owners is
that they do not believe until they see for themselves.
Short fingers show a person apt to be narrow-minded and obsti-
nate, yet one who will accumulate wealth after a hard struggle.
Fingers long and well developed show the person has excep-
tional ability, power and reason and, with well developed lines,
one who is bound to attain success.
Spatulate fingers show a love for practical things, an originator,
an inventor. ·
Conic fingers show an artistic and musical nature.
Psychic fingers denote one who lacks energy; he starts well and
means well, but gives up too soon.
SPATULATE HAND
CHAPTER III.
The Spatulate Hand is wide at the wrist and narrow at the base,
or broad at the base of the fingers and narrow at the wrist. A skin
hard and firm shows a restless and excitable nature, yet one full
of energy and one who will act promptly; quick in practical
things.
Fingers long with developed joints show the person has inventive
ability, possessing independence of action which makes him or her
go far and deep into things. They have peculiarities of their own
and are fond of mathematics and engineering.
THE CONIC HAND
CHAPTER IV.
The Conic Hand has small tapering fingers, the palm tapering
to the base of the fingers, the skin soft" and tender. This hand
denotes a sensitive and impulsive nature, one who will interfere
with other people's affairs and is fond of criticising, a lover of
luxury and idolence. Such a person is influenced by others and sur-
roundings, says what he or she thinks, is generous and sympathetic.
54 SECRETS OF INDIA
Such persons rise from the lowest state of despair to the highest
state of rapture, they are kind-hearted and preach to others what
they do not practice themselves.
When the fingers are long it shows a more artistic nature, and
one who would make a good critic. The owner of such fingers
seeks everything that is artistic and beautiful.
THE PHILOSOPHICAL HAND
CHAPTER V.
The Philosophical Hand has a long and narrow palm, with long,
thin fingers, developed points and thin almond-shaped nails. The
pm;sessor of such a hand loves to study human nature, which in-
fluences his methods, meditates before acting, is quiet, sedate and
very particular, haughty and egotistical, rarely forgets insult or
injury; yet is very patient and has a fondness for everything
artistic and beautiful.
Such characters like the mysterious. Money is not their ambi-
tion in life; what they seek is fame. They desire to be different
from others in their pursuits and actions.
This character of a hand is generally found among clergymen
and those of the religious order, as it reveals a nature that loves
to study and better mankind.
THE PSYCHIC HAND
CHAPTER VI.
The Psychic Hand is the most beautiful type of all hands. It
has a long and narrow palm with long delicate tapering fingers,
the skin white and tender with almond-shaped nails. The posses·
sors have a beautiful disposition, generally brought up under
parential guidance, yet they are weak, have a calm disposition and
frequently care little for the opposite'sex. They lack courage and
strength, cannot hold their own with people, are very emotional
and are influenced by people and their appearances.
Men with such hands are fond of gambling and earthly·pleasures,
generally unsuccessful in business world. Many tramps and the
falling aristocracy of human kind have this sort of hand.
MIXED HAND
CHAPTER VII.
The Mixed Hand has more of an oval-shaped palm, with mixed
fingers, as the Conic, Spatulate and Square, etc., the skin rough
and flexible. This character of hand denotes people who can do
a little of everything, jacks of all trades and masters of none. They
are very good talkers, as they can converse superficially on any
subject; they take life in an easy way, rarely ever raising or lower·
ing their position, are fond of travel and excitement, generally
popular wherever they may be thrown. This hand is possessed
by many actors.
I
pALMISTRY MADE EASY
THUMBS
CHAPTER VIII.
55
The Thumb is the most important feature of the hand and should
be carefully studied and consulted before forming your opinion
of a person's characteristics. It should be examined in connection
with the other lines in the hand, as it strengthens or weakens many
a good or bad factor shown elsewhere in the hand. The Thumb
is made up in three parts; the first or nail phalange and second
and third phalanges. -
If the first phalange is longer than the second or third, it shows
the subject possesses great will power and determination; if nearly
twice the length of the second phalange, a stubborn disposition;
and if the thumb is short, a very narrow mind with little intellect.
If the second phalange is as long as the first, it shows the subject
has logic and reason, and if longer than the first has not enough
will to carry out plans, but depends entirely upon others.
When the third phalange is nearly as long as the second, it
denotes a passionate nature and a person who is apt to give up to
the sensual side of life, especially if Mt. Venus is well developed.
When the Thumb is long and firm, not easily bent back, it
shows a cautious and reserved nature, which sticks to one thing
and makes the best of everything; is very energetic and knows the
value of money.
If supple and easily bent back, it shows an extravagant and
unreserved disposition; the possessors can adapt themselves to
anything or any circumstances.
When the thumb has a wrist-shaped appearance, it denotes re-
finement and tact. A clumsy and coarse appearance shows a coarse
and vulgar nature.
THE FINGERS
CHAPTER IX.
When the subject has smooth joints with tapering fingers, it
shows a very sensitive nature and yet one which is generally in-
different to others.
Developed joints denote people of common sense and methodi-
cal in their work, fond of analyzing and going deep into things,
observant and thoughtful.
Long fingers denote love of detail; thick fingers, cruelty and
selfishness; firm and stiff fingers, a cowardly nature; crooked
fingers, a deceitful and unprincipled nature.
When the first finger is longer than the third, it shows one who
desires to rule and domineer over others; when nearly as long as
the second fingers, the same quality, but a person who will be
ashamed of his poor relations and associates if he raises to a
prominent position.
56 SECRETS OF INDIA
When the third finger is longer than the first, it shows a person
who is fond of gambling and speculation, and when it is as long
or nearly as long as the second finger a morbid nature and one
who takes life as a lottery.
When the fourth or little finger is long, reaching above the first
phalange of the third finger, it shows one who can converse with
ease; and when reaching far above this phalange line, indicates
great power of expression.
When the first phalange is longer than the second or third
phalange on the finger, the person is untruthful and misrepresents
at times.
When this finger is short it shows the possessors cannot express
themselves with ease, and when poorly developed, that what they
say is not worth listening to.
THE MOUNTS
CHAPTER X.
A Mount is a raised part or pad on the palm of the hand, there
being seven important ones, four under fingers, two under thumbs
and one on the side of the palm.
Under the first finger is Mt. Jupiter which, if well developed
and placed, shows ambition, self.respect, a love of display and a
~ery vain person.
· A Star found on this mount shows great success will be attained;
a Cross on the mount a happy marriage.
Under the second finger is Mt. Saturn; well developed it shows
one who is prudent and fond of solitude, with a fondness for agri·
culture and its pursuits. If the mount is badly placed, it signifies
one who is always finding fault with others and everything.
When a Star is found on this mount it means success in science.
A Cross on it means a leaning toward science and a superstitious
nature.
Under the third finger is Mt. Sun. If well developed it shows
people who are fond of art and music; if badly placed, a tendency
to over-estimate their ability.
A Star on the mount means success and prominence through art;
a Cross on it, lack of display and loss of self interest.
Under the fourth or little finger is Mt. Mercury. If well de-
veloped the subject has a keen sense of business and a fondness
for speculating. If the subject has a long little finger and a good
clear head line, he has an aptitude for law and its vocation; with
spatulate fingers a fondness for chemistry. If the mount lies
toward the third finger the individual is fond of wit, excitement
and 'travel. If the mount leans toward the side of the palm it
shows a deceitful and unprincipled nature.
A Star on this mount means success through speculatfons; a
Cross on the mount, an unsettled disposition in business affairs.

On the side of the palm is Mt. Luna. If well developed, a gentle
and imaginative nature is indicated.
Under the thumb is Mt. Venus. If well developed, shows ~
affectionate disposition, and over-developed, a very passionate one.
Above the Mount of Venus, Mt. Mars, when developed, denotes
a brave and courageous person.
In judging the developments of the mounts, a well-developed
mount is one that is higher than the others. When they are all the
same development it means that the subject possesses a small
amount of each of these characteristics.
THE LINE OF LIFE
CHAPTER XI.
If the Line of Life is long and clearly cut without breaks, it
denotes a strong healthy person; if it sweeps far into the palm of
the hand and terminates at the wrist, a long and healthful life.
When the line is not clear the individual is weak and unhealthy,
and when broken fortells illness. A decided break in the same
place in both hands generally means death.
When the line commences at the base of Mt. Jupiter it shows
ambition from early life; if without break and clear, good health
in youth.
When it commences at Head Line, the head governs the life.
When the line is a little distance from the Head Line, independence
in thought and ideas is shown; when far distant, a foolhardy and
simple person.
When the line sends an offshoot to Mount Luna the subject will
die away from his birthplace. An offshoot to Mt. Jupiter predicts
a rise in social affairs; to Mt. Saturn a gain in wealth through
inheritance; to Mt. Sun ambition gratified by traveling; to Mt.
Mercury success in business; and these good fortunes being
attained by the individual's own energy and perseverance.
All small lines cutting the life line mean interference of others
with their plans at the time they appear.
THE LINE OF HEAD
CHAPTER XII.
The Line of Head commences at three different points, from the
bottom of Mt. Jupiter at the Life Line; at Mt. Mars under Jupiter.
The Line of Head offers to the mental condition and temperament
of the subject. Commencing at Mt. Jupiter and separate from Life
Line, it denotes a self-reliant, yet hasty person, in reasoning and
deciding; when the space is very wide, a foolhardy individual.
When the line rises from the Life Line, it shows a cautious and
careful disposition, tidy in appearance and full of energy.
When it commences at the Mount of Mars, it denotes a fretful
and worrying disposition, a nervous and sensitive temperament.
58 SECRETS OF INDIA
When the line is straight and running clear across the hand, the
person is very bright and intellectual; what he or she says is prac·
tical; when it ends in a fork, the subject has literary talent; the
longer the fork the greater the talent. If the line has a gradual
slope, the owner has a great deal of imagination, and is generally
an incessant talker.
When the line runs parallel with the Life Line, it shows idealism
~ith little ambition for honor or glory, and fondness for bohemian-
ism.
All ·lines rising from the Head Line show that the subject by his
own ability will accomplish or pursue the ambitions denoted by
the mounts to which they rise, as follows:
To Mt. Jupiter, fame and honor.
To Mt. Saturn, science.
To Mt. Sun, art or music.
To Mt. Mercury, the business world.
THE L INE OF HEART
CHAPTER XIII.
When the Line of Heart commences at the top of Mt. Jupiter, it
shows sincere and reliable affections, generally persons whose aims
are high and noble.
When the line starts between the first and second fingers, they
are jealous, carry their affections to extremes and are apt to be
fickle.
The line rising from Mt. Saturn shows a selfish disposition and
one inclined to be cold to others.
All small lines cutting the heart line mean flirtation; break on
the line, disappointments in love at the time they may appear.
The line broken under Mt. Jupiter shows disappointment in
business caused by the affections; under Mt. Saturn, accident
caused by the affections; under Mt. Sun, pride and conceit caused
by the affections; under Mt. Mercury, quarrels with the opposite
sex (wife or husband), in many cases divorce.
When the line runs clear across the hand and sends a branch
to Mt. Jupiter, it means a happy and tranquil nature.
When there are no small lines cutting or dropping from the
Heart Line, the owner cares little for the opposite sex.
When the line is now down on the palm of the hand and lying
near the Line of Head, the heart controls the head.
When the Heart, Head and Life lines all join, it shows people
who stop at nothing until they gain their end. Many prisoners
have their characteristic in their hands.
No line of Heart in Hand shows little affection.

THE LINE OFFATE
CHAPTER XIV.
59
The Line of Fate relates to our worldly affairs, fate, fortune,
prosperity and failures in life.
When the line rises from the bottom of Mt. Luna the subject has
been spoiled by parents, and when the line runs up to the fingers of
Mt. Saturn, the subject will have good and great luck in everything
undertaken.
When the line rises up from the wrist and runs clear up to base
of finger toward Mt. Jupiter, great success will be accomplished by
the individual unaided; and if it runs into the line of Heart, wealth
gained through marriage.
When a line runs up from Mt. Luna and cuts through Fate Line,
others have interfered .with opportunities.
When the Fate Line is stopped by the line of Heart, the indi-
vidual has cut himself off from better opportunities through his
affections.
When the line is stopped or broken by the Line of Head, the sub-
ject has made a great blunder through stupidity, and has neglected
an opportunity of gratifying his ambition. However, if the Fate
Line is stopped by these lines (Head and Heart Lines) and then
continues on again it means that he has injured his fortune for the
time being.
When the line sends an offshoot to any of the Mounts, such as
to Mt. Mercury, the subject will become famous in the talent
denoted by the rest of the hand. An offshoot to Mt. Saturn spells
success in science, to Mt. Sun, in art, to Mt. Mercury, in business.
If the line commences in the middle of Life Line, opportunities
will come later in life for the individual.
If it commences at Heart Line, an inheritance through marriage.
THE LINE OF MARRIAGE
CHAPTER XV.
The Line of Marriage lies on the sides of the hand between the
Heart Line and the line that surrounds the little finger.
Closer to the Heart Line it means an early marriage; farther
away, a marriage later in life. When the Line is perfectly bare,
the subject is not likely to marry, and if the line has small lines
cutting through it and also forking, it is a sure sign of marriage.
These small cutting lines are the number of children the couple
will have.
A wealthy marriage is shown by a line rising up from Fate Line.
When the line runs far into the palm of the hand and sends an
off-shoot to Mt. Sun, the subject will marry one of prominence and
of an artistic nature.
When the line is short and ends in a fork, the lower branch
longer than the upper one, an unhappy marriage is shown, and
60 SECRETS OF INDIA
when the line drops so far as to cut the Line of Heart, divorce.
When a line rises up from Mt. Luna, the person will marry one
of a humbler position.
All small lines that are lying between the Heart Line and the
line of the little finger mean flirtations at the time they appear.
The Line of Marriage should be clearly cut on both the right and
left hand, and the right hand should be used in deciding all these
facts.
THE LINE OF vOCATION
CHAPTER XVI.
The Line of Vocation runs parallel with the Fate Line and
denotes the subject will be successful according to what mounts
it sweeps to. To Mt. Mercury, prosperity in business; to Mt.
Saturn, success in agriculture; to Mt. Sun fame in art, painting
and music. ·
When the line commences nearly as low as the Fate Line, the
subject has inherited money early in life.
When the line commences in center ot palm the person will
make money through speculation.
Many hands do not possess this line, and in such cases the qual-
ities this line denotes are determined by the mounts and other
lines in the hand.
THE SQUARES
CHAPTER XVII.
A square is made up of four lines that form a square, and what-
ever found indicates preservations at the time it appears. If on the
Life Line the subject was protected from illness or accident, pro-
vided the Life Line is broken in the Square.
A Square on the Head Line means preservation from mishaps or
diseases of the head.
A Square on the Heart Line means oncoming trouble in love and
affections.
A Square on the Fate Line, salvation from ruin or failure in
money matters.
A Square on Mt. Jupiter, avoidance of social scandal.
A Square on Mt. Saturn, escape from sudden death.
A Square on Mt. Sun, release from travel.
A Square on Mt. Mercury, escape from disgrace in business.
THE CROSSES
CHAPTER XVIII.
A Cross when found on Mt. Jupiter, means a happy marriage.
A Cross on Mt. Saturn means the one who enters your life will
be of a scientific nature.
A Cross on Mt. Sun, means a great deal of traveling.
....
pALMISTRY MADE EASY 61
A Cross on Mt. Mercury, means dishonesty in business.
A Cross on Mt. Venus, a disposition changed through marriage.
There are so many small lines on the hands which look like
crosses that it is very hard to determine whether they are or not.
Generally only the vivid crossing of two lines is to be considered.
MISCELLANEOUS
There are a few other outline markings on the hand, which are
explained by other authorities on the subj.ect of Palmistry; such
as Grills, Islands, Sports, Triangles, Circles and so forth. They are
hard to locate except by the use of a magnifying glass, which
makes a confusing task for the student, and they are of minor
value. I have therefore omitted these from this work, as the idea
is to present the subject in the simplest and easiest way.
SUPERSTITIONS
SUPERSTITIONS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES
ITALY
The "evil eye" signifies that the possessor has the power by a
glance of his eye of inflicting death and that, sooner or later, the
evil eye works misfortune for the possessor himself.
}APAN
The turtle is an omen of good luck in Japan.
FRANCE
The apaches of Paris are extraordinarily superstitious. One of
their pet beliefs is that to touch a hunchback's deformity will
assuredly bring them luck; and there is one gang of apaches which
carried the severed head of a rat. The loss of this gruesome relic
caused great consternation.
INDIA
The thugs and tramps of the Far East have queer rites, one being
to pour goat's milk on the ground to propitiate the god Devi. The
Indian also considers it unlucky to sneeze during the commissio:a
of a crime.
ENGLAND
English criminals will often give up a burglary if the house is
next or opposite a church-although to break into a shop or house
near a police station is considered a lucky enterprise. One crook
even lived near a police station while the country scoured for him.
WESTERN EUROPE
In France and some parts of Spain and Portugal, there exists a
tradition known as "the ghost of leap year." Believers in this say
that a marvelous monster annually appears to disarrange human
affairs for the remainder of the year.
CURIOUS SUPERSTITIONS
When Napoleon was conducting his campaign in Italy, a mirror
in his headquarters fell to the floor and was broken into fragments.
For centuries the story has persisted that to break a mirror means
that one's best friend will die.
To stumble and fall is supposed to bring ill fortune.
When a ship is launched a bottle of champagne is broken across
its bow-a survival of one of the most ancient customs in history.
The tradition that when a person's ears burn some one is talking
about him can be traced back as far as the days of Pliny, who
makes mention of that popular belief.
A person sneezes and there is almost always some one present
to utter a quick "God bless you!" Here is a superstition that has

a basis in disaster, for in the year 750 an epidemic of fatal sneezing
seized the Old World.
There is a superstition that Friday is an unlucky day, and that
13 is an unlucky number.
If one drops a knife or fork, it is a sign that guests are coming.
Picking up a pin is a sign of good luck; the horseshoe is also a
good luck sign.
To open an umbrella indoors is unlucky.
If your ears burn, it is a sign you are being talked about.
Lucky colors, lucky numbers, lucky stones, all have their de-
fenders. Certain jewels are supposed to govern certain months
and bring good fortune to their wearers.
SNEEZING AND !Ts L ucK
Sneeze on Monday, sneeze for danger; Sneeze on Tuesday, kiss
a stranger; Sneeze on Wednesday, sneeze for a letter; Sneeze on
Thursday, something better; Sneeze on Friday, sneeze for sorrow;
Sneeze on Saturday, your sweetheart tomorrow. Sneeze on Sunday,
your safety seek, the devil will have you all of the week.
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU SNEEZE?
One is a wish, two for a kiss, three is a disappointment, four is a
letter, five something better, six is a journey you'll go.
STAGE SUPERSTITIONS
Whistling in the dressing room is a sign of bad luck. This is one
of the most widespread superstitions among stage folk. An un-
failing forerunner of grief, and has resulted in every manifestation
of misfortune from closing the show to relaxed vocal chords. It
has caused train wrecks, divorce, and other troubles for the
whistlers.
Actors also cherish an assortment of signs peculiar to the.fr
profession. Here are some of them:
When a cat, any color, strays on the stage during a performance,
it is a sign of bad luck.
If a black cat walks clear across the stage, from one side to the
other, it is an augury that promises success, long life, and much
renown for the play and all connected with it.
Dogs are always bad luck.
Dogs howling outside a theater during the course of a perform-
ance are believed to presage the closing of the show.
The last line of a play is never spoken until the first public
performance, lest catastrophe swoop down upon the production.
A smooth-running dress rehearsal is universally considered a
harbinger of evil for the production.
Actors generally think it lucky to leave some garment, some
part of their costumes or jewelry unworn at the dress rehearsal.
This leaves them with something new and unrehearsed to give
the audience.
..
NUMBER VIBRATIONS
I\Ey TO VIBRATIONS OF NUMBERS
Vibrations of numbers are important. They teach that life is
controlled in some way by the influence of numbers that make up
your name and date of birth. This comes down to us from the
ancients.
It is assumed that every letter of the alphabet has a number.
Each number has a special meaning. And to analyze your name
you must first reduce the name to numbers, according to the
table which follows. Then add the numbers of all the vowels.
This shows what your inner characteristics are. Now add all the
numbers of all the consonants. This suggests the outside influences
attracted to you for success or failure. The sum of vowels and con-
sonants together points to the real, full meaning of your life.
Thus if the total of your vowels is 69, this is treated as two
numbers-6 and 9. These two numbers are added, 6 plus 9 equals
15. As this is still two figures, it is added again-1 plus 5 equals
6, which, you see, is the number to he considered.
Here is a list of the letters of the alphabet together with the
number.s and meanings for which the letters stand:
A, J and S are ruled by I-courageous, self-reliant, strong and
independent.
B, K and T are ruled by 2-quiet, gentle, social, reasonable.
C, L and U are ruled by 3-animated, able, courageous, well-
meaning.
D, M and V are ruled by 4--negative, depressed, monotonous,
hard-working.
E, N and Ware ruled by 5-uneasy, restless, vigorous, interested.
F, 0 and X are ruld by 6--eommanding, upright, vigorous,
honorable.
G, P and Y are ruled by 7-visionary, easily depressed, artistic.
H, Qand Z are ruled by 8-strong, resolute, up-going, successful.
I and R are ruled by 9- soft-voiced, artistic, impressionable,
lovable.
There are exceptions to all rules. In this case numbers 11 and
22 are exceptions. They are not reduced to single figures but
allowed to stand when they occur in a name, as they are related to
positive brilliancy. Twenty-two is a vibration of occult possibil-
ities. Eleven is a number that dominates nearly everything.
THIS STUDY MEANS MUCH TO MANY PERSONS
Many believe that vibrations of numbers show that the world
is really "built" on the power of numbers. The teachings of
Pythagorus point to that deduction. His wonderful spiritual un-
foldment taught him the harmony of all things. He perceived the
harmony and also the inharmony that exist in sound, color, taste
and feeling, and in sight. All inharmonies in the sense of vibra-
tion, result badly in our worldly affairs.
l
NUMBER VIBRATIONS . 65
Numbers as a science, set forth a key to many happenings in
our lives that are peculiar, to say the least.
VIBRATIONS OF "FIRST" NAMES
The study of the vibration of "first" names is fascinating. Some
names agree, others clash very disagreeably. To prove this, take
the figures one to nine and divide them into three groups, as
follows:
First group, 1 5 7; Second group, 2 4 8; Third group, 3 6 9.
' Each name has its own number. Here's an illustration: Four
young men are in love with the one girl. The girl's name, we .shall
say, is LORA, and the young men are called John, James, William
and Edward. Now, these names are read in this way: .
The names Lora and both James and John are in opposite groups,
making for disharmony and a clashing of temperaments. The
names Lora, William and Edward are in the same group, making
them all have many tastes in common, yet William, with his
number seven, in the same group, stands no chance with Edward,
who is not only in the same group but vibrates to the same number
"one," making for understanding and appreciation, two great
factors in love.
EXAMPLE OF HOW TO FIND YOUR NAME NUMBER
It is best to write the alphabet out in full, as follows:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4
ABCDEFGHIJKLM
5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
NOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Now take the name "Lora"-3691 and add the figures together.
LORA
3 6 9 1 added=l9-l plus 9=10-drop the cipher and you
have 1.
JOHN
1 6 8 5 added=20-drop the cipher and you have 2.
WILLIAM
5 9 3 3 91 4 added=34--3 plus 4 and you have 7.
JAMES
1 14, 5 1 added=l2- l plus 2 and you have 3.
EDWARD
5 4 5 1 9 4 added=28-2 plus 8=10-drop the cipher and you
have 1.
Now, according to this scheme of numbers and the vibrations
of names, if Lora marries John they will quarrel continually, and
if she marries James they will have many ups and downs. But if
she marries William, she will be contented and fairly happy.
However, if she marries Edward she will be ideally happy. It
will be a real love match that will last all their lives. They belong
to one another.
SIGNS AND WARNINGS
If a number of birds circle over your head, it is a sign that good
fortune is about to befall you or your family.

But those who study their own interest best, study themselves first,
last and all the time. Know yourself.
SEX ADVICE
ARE You PHYSICALLY FIT To MARRY?
"The answer to this question will assume supreme importance
at some time in your life. There may be periods when the replies
thereto will torture your soul almost beyond endurance. For there
comes a time in the life of every man when he wants to marry,
that is, prov~ded he is a real, well-sexed man. And when that time
comes, when the right girl has been found, if a man feels that he
is defective, or that there is some taint within his organism that
will mar the sanctity of the marital tie, then indeed does he face
difficulties that assume tragic importance.
"In determining whether or not one is fit to marry, the first
query will of course be concerned with one's physical condition.
Are you a healthy, well-developed man? Are there any serious
vital defects? Even after these questions have hen favorably an-
swered, there still are others. Is it possible that there is any vener-
eal infection lingering within your organism? If you have been
tainted with any venereal disease, at least be absolutely sure that
all traces of the complaint have disappeared, by means of blood
tests.
"If you are weak sexually, then the problem before you per-
tains to the development of the vigor and vitality which will over-
come a condition of this sort. It is true that in some cases, one is
advised to marry, with a view of remedying the weaknesses of this
sort.
"In many instances the remedy is worse than the disease. This
is especially true which the ordinary excesses associated with mar-
riage are permitted and practiced. If marital relationship were
assumed with a woman thoroughly informed as to the conditions,
then possibly a man's sexual strength might increase as a result
of marriage. This would be practically impossible, however, if
the woman should happen to be of a passionate sort. Were she
entirely normal or but little influenced by sexual conditions, a
man might, in some instances, safely hope for a gradual improve-
ment, although there is considerable risk in contracting marriage
under such conditions.
"The sex instinct begins to assert itself at an early age. In
many individuals it becomes noticeable far earlier Uran it should,
because of the prudery that is found almost everywhere. The curi-
osity aroused in childish minds by the strong, virile man must,
therefore, realize the necessity for marriage. He must marry some-
body, and should carefully choose his mate early in life. Early
marriage is advantageous largely because it saves a man from all
the diseases and excesses associated with prostitution, as well as
from other evils.

SEX ADVICE 69
"'To the pure in heart, all things are pure.' But to the prude
the most sacred facts of life are vulgar and impure. Prudery is
simply the expression of an unclean state of mind suppressed ar·
tifically and in its very nature depends upon pruriency and a per·
verted mental attitude toward the most holy of all functions. The
more conspicuous the pose of prudery, as a rule, the greater is the
impurity of mind thereby indicated.
"It is absolutely necessary to live a clean life and a normal life
in order to maintain the healt.4 of the sexual glands and the superb
mental and physical powers that go with them. This is more im·
portant in youth than at any other period, though the rules ap·
plies throughout one's entire adult life. One cannot violate the
laws of life in this respect and escape the punishment. It is neces·
sary to reach maturity with these powers unimpaired, and there-
after to continue to avoid abuses in order to attain and retain the
mental alertness and energy, the c.ourage, and self.confidence, the
ambition, and also the physical stamina that characterizes true
manhood."
THE GREAT MORAL QUESTION
The present standard of morality in marriage is the growth of
ages; in fact, few people think that there is any moral question
involved with reference to the sex relation between husband and
wife, but that, a marriage ceremony having been performed, they
are entitled to enjoy the gratification of their desire to the fullest
extent. No logical reason exists f01;· this view and none can be
given.
Do you see that disrupted home, where love and peace reigned
before and hell is reigning now? Do you see that business man
who is steadily and unexplainably losing his grip on the details of
his affairs, is losing his appetite and his sleep and will soon have
to be sent to a sanitarium for "repairs?" How often we see a re·
.fined woman who has every material comfort imaginable and is
nevertheless wasting away, becoming pale, irritable, melancholic,
and will soon be-if nothing is done to help her-a confirmed
hyprochondriac? And do you see that wan looking bookkeeper
who, formerly an expert, is now unable to keep a position for any
length of time, because he is mixing his figures so? Do'you see
that bright young boy who is losing both brightness and flesh to
such an extent that the parents are afraid he is running into con·
sumption? And how about that sweet young girl who was obliged
to give up college for reasons that nobody could explain? And
those hundreds of divorced couples? All this unspeakable misery
and suffering due to disorders of the sexual system! And the pity
of it is, that all of it, or the greater part of it, could have been
avoided if not for two things--if the patients had not been afraid,
ashamed to ask for advice, and if the physicians were not so densely
ignorant of the subject of sexual disorders.
70 SECRETS OF INDIA
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX
"The more deeply I delve into the study of sexual psychology,
the more patients I see, the more marital misery I am called upon
to alleviate, the more conjugal entanglements I am asked to dis-
entangle, the more convinced I become of the tremendous im-
portance of the sexual instinct in every sphere of life, the more im-
bued I become with the idea of the necessity of studying this prob-
lem thoroughly from every point of view.
"I have no hesitation in stating that at least half of the world's
misery is in some way, directly or indirectly, connected with the
sexual sphere. The people themselves may not be aware of it,
but if they studied the matter deeply, they would find that the
underlying trouble is of a sexual nature.
"And matters will not improve until we are permitted to dis-
cuss the entire domain of human sexuality freely, openly, without
beating about the bush, and without the spectre of a censorship
before our eyes.
"The time is sure to come when you will be delivered from the
slavery of your passions. But it does not help any at present to wait
for this heroic age of the future-we should do our part to. hasten
the coming. Join today the future generation of honorable men.
Try to preserve your strength and manly vigor, instead of wasting
it. Your reward will be joy and you will be able to labor, to reap
the rich fruits of a prosperous career," so says a noted authority
on venereal diseases.
CHILDREN
Every boy and girl should have such a thorough knowledge of
the Mystery of Sex, and what sex-relations mean, as to realize that a
mis-step or indiscretion at this period of youth may cost them,
that which is more precious than life in years to come.
It is during this impressionable period that parents should ex-
ercise the utmost precaution and watchfulness, for at this time
youth has an almost uncontrollable desire to know the forbidden.
It is of vital importance that the writer call parents' attention
to the ignorance of children as one of the factors in the corruption
that darkens the world, but truth is truth and facts are facts, al-
though there are stubborn things to deal with in many of the prob-
lems of life.
Fathers and mothers should talk freely on this subject with
their sons and daughters, so that their little ones may have a
complete understanding of these vital facts, and thereby avoid the
attendant dangers, which invariably result from sex·ignorance. Un-
taught children find out for themselves, many of the secrets of
life, and begin to put them in practice, having no understanding
of the vast injury done their bodies, or the great wrong for which
they are responsible as the years pass away.

SEX ADVICE 7i
Boys and girls play innocently together, unconscious of the
dominating force that is slumbering. within. As puberty ap-
proaches, the boy assumes a more masterful attitude, his voice
becomes heavier and gradually assumes a lower tone, his desire
becomes stronger; his actions more gallant and his thoughts more
sensual than formerly. The girl becomes more timid and shy than
she has hi.therto been; her form rapidly develops into womanly
outlines. The changes in both sexes are not only physical, but
mental and the girl or boy is truly on the threshold of real lif~,
with all its passions, desires, hopes, loves and ambitions. Her.e-
after, their paths diverge, a natural barrier rises between them,
and each nature gradually assumes the characteristics peculiar to
its sex.
The child at this time is controlled almost entirely by impulse,
not having learned self-control in any degree. How important
therefore, it is, that his environments should be uplifting and that
his habits should be carefully directed away from the sensual
vices and the influences of evil companions that constantly be-
set him. Too often schoolmates are the only instructors which
many children have, their parents leaving this important duty
unperformed and allowing their minds to become inculated with
evil teachings before implanting the good; thus shirking the most
important responsibility of parentage. The physical disturbances
at this time are so closely allied to the mental, and exert such a
profound influence upon the brain, that insanity is not an infre-
quent outcome of indiscretions at this time.
While the natural tendencies toward sexual excitement are great
during this period, it must not be overlooked that it may in so
small measure be due to some local irritant, such as a too tight
or too loose foreskin or an adherent clitoris. There are various
other causes that might contribute toward this condition, such as
hemmorrhoids, worms in the rectum, etc. The circumcision of
boys will often effect a cure in these cases, and a careful examina-
tion should be made in all cases so as to remove the cause if it is a
mechanical one; likewise to break up the adhesions of the clitoris
will often afford the greatest relief to girls. It is, therefore, of
the utmost importance that the child be given a thorough educa-
tion in self-control and instructed in regard to the irreparable
dangers arising from a violation of the important laws of Nature.
The great evil of self-abuse, which is practiced alone in secret,
is put to shame by the intimacy of boys and girls, who in nooks
and corners are doing all possible to carry into their lives the
privileges of the married, and boasting of their proficiency, until
whole schools, towns, and communities are corrupted with a
plague. Yea, it is a deeper and blacker plague than any disease,
as its roots are deeper, piercing the soul; its bands are stronger,
reaching beyond the help of man; its stench and miasma are more
offensive, as they reach an offended God, and bear before them
72 SECRETS OF INDIA
the sighs, tears, and heartaches of the weak. Loving parents dream
on about the "innocent days of childhood," until they are rudely
awakened by the moral destruction of their loved ones..
But we hear the plaintive cry on every side, from parents,
friends, teachers, and preachers, "What can we do?" You can throw
false modesty aside and give the instructions needed for their de-
fense. Let them know the influence and effect each wrong act,
and the shame, censure, and punishment thereof. Let there be
no compromis,e therewith in the hearts and minds of those having
the care of children. Shall we permit them to throw themselves
in ignorance over so great a precipice and we fold our hands in
indifference, or in our greater wisdom and strength say, "We can
do nothing," but mourn and weep over the sad situation while
the sorrowing parents let them pass on in ignorance. Deeper and
deeper must become this lothesome pollutions of the land, unless
parents arise to their responsibilities as parents and bring up their
children in the way that they should go, by requiring obedience
from the earliest years of life until they leave the parental home
to battle with life as men and women. How sad it is to know that
in the years to come we parents have hastened our children to·
ward evil by our silence regarding it!
Dr. Marden in "Crime of Silence," says:
"I have often heard mothers say that they did not want their
daughters to know that any such thing as immorality existed,
that they wanted to bring them up pure and innocent. It is true
there is something indescribably beautiful in the innocence, the
sprightliness, the ingeniousness, the playful spontaneity of per-
fectly pure, untainted girlhood. But, my good mother friend, have
you ever thought that while you are trying to shield your daugh-
ter from knowledge of herself and the evil of the world, she may
be getting information from the most vicious sources, distorted,
exaggerated pictures that may lead to her ruin? Isn't it better
that this knowledge, which she must sooner or later have, should
come from you, who can give her the truth, rather than from
illegitimate sources which garble and distort facts in a way that
will inflame and debauch her imagination? Why not tell her
the plain scientific truth about herself and about her future, what
part she is to play in the perpetuation of the race? It is not
scientific facts which demoralize the mind; it is distorted, obscene
suggestions that arouse curiosity and inflame passions. The facts
will not hurt your daughter, but will protect her against a thou·
sand evils."
Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, late superintendent of the public.schools
of Chicago, says that their experiment in sex-instruction in the
schools of Chicago has increased the girls' sense of their own dig-
nity and the marvelous meaning of their nature. The knowledge
they are acquiring in taking the place of the silly ignorance, which
so long .has been regarded as innocence, and the girls hold their
•
SEX ADVICE 73
heads higher and seem to think more of themselves. They have
greater respect for their own bodies.
While imparting sex-instruction to your children, parents should
keep in mind the object of enlarging the child's horizon, uplifting
their ideas of nature, law, and religion, and at the same time instill
into their young minds, the wonder, the miracle, the sacredness,
and the marvelous works of the Creator, especially of the powers
within themselves. ·
As the young boy or girl matures under the proper environment
the attributes of the higher self become manifest and the pure
young life is lifted to higher planes of thought and action. The
training of youths should be gradual, so that they can thoroughly
understand the wonderful changes as they come, and that he or
she may develop into the real man or woman fully prepared to
share in the work of creation.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I've wondered what you are,
So I solved the plan to know, for Phenomena told me so.
Each living soul like stars above, all have their work to do--
In knowing all about their plan will help life's journey too.

FORTUNE TELLING BY CARDS
Take from the pack the four Aces, Kings, Queens, Knaves, Tens,
Nines, Eights, Sevens.
Shuffle the cards well and then cut into three packs; take up
the first pack and turn up the cards in threes. When the three
cards are all of the same suit, lay them out in a row on table; when
of three different suits, put them aside; i£ there are two of one suit
and one of another, take the highest of the two and lay it along-
side those already out. When the first pack is used deal with the
second and then the third in the same manner. When you have
come to the end of the three packs, gather the cards that have been
discarded, shuffle them and cut the pack into three, and turn up
by threes again in same manner as before. This must be done
three times. Tue third and last time the person shuffiing the cards
must take out and add to the "fortune" row a card which is sup-
posed to represent the person whose fortune is being told. If it
be a dark lady or gentleman whose fortune is being told, use the
Queen or King respectively of Spades or Clubs, and if required
to represent a fair lady or gentleman the Queen or King of Hearts
or Diamonds respectively; also set aside the Ace of Hearts, which
represents the house, and the Nine of Hearts, which is the Wish
ca~d, unless these cards already appear in the "fortune" row. The
cards that have now come out are placed aside the fortune of the
shufHer of the cards is told in the following manner: Count from
the card representing the person whose fortune is to be told and
read every seventh card backward and forward, then count from
the "house" (Ace of Hearts) in the same way, then from the "Wish"
(Nine of Hearts).
After counting, take the first and last cards away from those
laid out and read. Suppose the first is the Ace of Clubs, and the
last the Ten of Clubs, that would read "a letter with unexpected
news." Now take the first and last card again, say Nine of Dia-
monds and Ten of Hearts, that would read "money from a big
house" or "a present." Keep taking up first and last cards until
all are gathered up, now shufHe and cut as before and deal them
out one at a time in four lots-the first "what you do expect," the
second for the house, the third for yourself, and the fourth true
fortune. This last must only contain two cards, i.e., the first and
last dealt.

TEA CUP READING
X
N THE use of Tea Leaves as the means of divination. The
clearer the sight the more interesting and accurate will
be the interpretation.
Practice is most necessary, especially for those who have less
natural clairvoyance than others.
As in other forms of divination, so with the reading of the Tea
Cup, a great deal depends upon the Seer.
Those who are naturally clairvoyant will read many events
and scenes in the cup which would be passed over by others not
so gifted.
Even without this clear sight, however, the Tea Leaves may be
read by anyone who has learned the principles and symbolic
meanings given in this book.
With a certain amount of Intuition and Imagination, the Tea
Cups may be most successfully used to reveal the future.
PRACTICE AND METHOD
A wide, shallow cup is the best kind to use for tea-leaf divination
-white if possible. A narrow cup adds to the seer's difficulties,
as the tea-leaves cannot be plainly seen. Small cups, too, are
objectionable for the same reason, and a fluted cup is even worse.
A plain, even surface is required, with no pattern of any kind, as
this has a tendency to confase the symbols. Indian tea and the
cheaper mixtures, which contain so much dust and twigs are of
no use for reading a fortune, as they cannot form into pictures
and symbols that can easily be distinguished.
Those who desire to have their tea-leaves interpreted should
leave about a teaspoonful of tea at the bottom of the cup. It should
then be taken in the left hand, and turned three times from left
with a quick swing. Then very gently, slowly, and with care,
turn it upside down over the saucer, leaving it there for a minute,
so that all the moisture may drain away.
The cup to be read is held by the seer and turned about as
necessary, so that the symbols may be read without disturbing
them. This is important, but no disturbance will take place if
the moisture has been properly drained away. The handle of the
cup represents the consultant, also the home, or, if the consultant
be away from home the present abode.
It is necessary to have a starting point in the cup for the pur-
pose of indicating events approaching near to, or far distant from,
the person consulting. The leaves near the rim denote such
things as may be expected to occur quickly; those directly beneath
the handle indicate present and immediate happenings; those on
the sides of the cup suggest more distant events; whilst those at
the bottom deal wih the far disant fuure.
77
78 SECRETS OF INDIA
This method of fixing the time, coupled with intuition, renders
it possible to give a consultant some idea as to when an event may
be expected; but if there be no intuitive sense of time, it will be
found wiser not to be too positive.
The turning of the cup and the draining of the moisture having
been carried out as directed, the tea-leaves will he found distributed
at the sides and bottom of the cup.
For those who wish to use the saucer as a further means of
divination, the following suggestions will be useful.
First of all, then, to determine the position of the consultant.
Take the centre of the saucer for this purpose. The circle round
it represents the home, or if the consultant is away from home, the
present abode, and also events near at hand. The more distant
circle indicates those things which are not to be expected for
!!Orne time. The outer circle and rim suggest events as yet in the
misty future.
The moisture and leaves drained from the cup, having remained
in the saucer, should be turned by the consultant three times with
the same swirling motion as for the cup, and the moisture care-
fully poured away. The saucer should be held inverted for a few
seconds, otherwise when it is placed upright, the remaining moist-
ure will disturb the tea-leaves. The symbols are read in exactly
the same way as in the cup, the only difference being the positions
representing the consultant, the home, and the indications of time.
These have already been explained.
It is an excellent plan to make a rough copy of the leaves as
they present themselves to you in each cup, making notes of the
various meanings.
The seer has to find in the forms of the tea-leaves a resemblance,
sometimes it may be but a faint one, to natural objects, e.g., trees,
houses, flowers, bridges, and so forth. Figures of human beings
and animals will frequently be seen, as will squares, triangles,
circles, fillld also the line of fate.
It will constantly be found that the stems, isolated leaves, or
small grol!lps of leaves, form a letter of the alphabet, sometimes a
number. These letters and numbers have meanings which must
be looked for in connection with other noticeable signs. If an
initial "M" appears, and near to it a small square or oblong leaf,
both being near the rim of the cup, it would indicate a letter com·
ing speedily from someone whose name begins with an "M."
A single bird flying always indicates speedy news.
In a cup with various ominous signs, such as a serpent, an owl,
or many crosses, the news coming is not likely to be pleasant. In a
eup without bad signs, it can safely be said that the news is good.
~s a general rule large letters indicate places, whilst smaller
ones give the names of persons. Thl:lS a large letter "E" would
stand .for Edinburgh and a smaller "E" for Edwards, for instance.
_
,
....
TEA CuP READING 79
Sometimes numbers mean the date for an event to be expected,
a"5" for instance, very near the brim of the cup, or the handle
(the consultant), means in five days; or five weeks if it comes on
the side, possibly as far off as five months, if the figure be at the
bottom of the cup.
As dots around a symbol always indicates money in some form
or another, according to the character of the symbol.
Clusters of shapeless leaves represent clouds marring the effect
of an otherwise fortunate cup.
Journeys are shown by lines or dots formed by the dust and
smaller leaves of the tea. The length and direction of the journey
may be known by the.extent of the line and, roughly speaking, the
point of the compass to which it leads, the handle in this case
representing south. If the line of dots ascends sharply to the
brim of the cup, a journey to a hilly country will be taken.
Large flat leaves some distance apart along the line stand for
important stations to be passed through.
It will be seen, on referring to the Dictionary, that an Eagle
and a Vulture signifies a death of a Monarch.
Among those which threaten misfortune, or sorrow, are the fol-
lowing: Crosses, snakes, spades, pistols, guns, toads and cats.
Joy and success are indicated by such Symbols as a Crescent
Moon, Clover Leaves, Flowers, Trees, Anchors, Fruits, Circles
and Stars.
The most practiced Clairvoyant may occasionally make mis-
takes in the reading of the symbols, but no genuine seer should
ever deliberately give a wrong interpretation of them to please
the consultant.
The business of the Divineris is to give what she believes to be
a correct and unprejudiced translation of the symbols before her.
It is important that those who are learning the art of divination
by Tea Leaves should realize the necessity for consistently attribut-
ing the same meanings to the symbols.
Do not be tempted to change their interpretation for what may
seem a more probable, or pleasant prediction for the client. It is
a final mistake.
To those of an inquiring or doubting turn of mind, there may
arise a very natural question as to why one shaped Tea Leaf should
mean "a hat" and another "a table."
It is useless to point out that these objects are perfectly repre-
sented by the leaves.
That is of no practical satisfaction. The simple fact that each
language has its alphabet, its spelling, and its words, which must
be learned before there can be any reasonable understanding of
it, seems the best and the obvious reply.
80 SECRETS OF INDIA
THE "NELROS" CUP
TWO EXAMPLE READINGS OF ITS SIGNS
"If thou wouldst learn thy future with thy tea,
This magic cup will show it thee."
~OME readers may find an additional interest in divination
~ by tea-leaves, if they use a cup marked with the planetary
symbols, patented as the "Nelros Cup of Fortune." A
short explanation of the symbols, and the method of
using this cup, will be helpful for those who are not familiar with
its signs. I am not suggesting the use of the "Nelros" saucer, for
the reason that its signs are somewh~t obscure, and students who
have no experience in the science of astrology would find it con-
fusing, if used in addition to the cup, in which all needful signs
are illustrated.
As in the case of the ordinary tea-cup, the handle remains as
the representative of the consultant. The turning of it and draining
of the moisture should be carried out in the usual way.
Immediately under the handle, and above the space given to
the Sun, are seen a Diamond and a Horseshoe. Next on the left
are a Snake twisted round a stick, and a Spade, these being placed
over the space given to Saturn.
Following them are a Bell and a Club, seen over the sign of
Venus. Next, an Eye and Envelope, above the space given to
Jupiter.
Then comes a Cross, with the sign of Pisces, the Fishes, these
being over the sign of Mercury.
Next are a Winecup and a Spider above the space of Mars.
Followed by a Cat's Head and a Heart, above the Moon.
Each one of these signs round the brim has a symbolic mean-
ing, though their meaning must also be judged by the position
they occupy in the cup.
Now, taking the signs round the brim of the cup, and connecting
them with the planetary symbols beneath.
Beginning at the handle is a Diamond, this being a token of
wealth, which, with the sign of the Sun below, indicates much
prosperity, favours, and general well-being, the Horseshoe over
the Sun also betokening good luck and successful projects.
In the next space, reading to the left, is the Snake twisted round
a stick, over the sign of Saturn. This is emblematical of a risk
or poverty coming through deceit, and with a Spade over Saturn,
whose characteristic is privation, there is a further indication of
toil, loss, undoing.
The next sign is a happier one; the Bell over the sign of Venus,
with the Club beyond, indicates joyful news, events meaning much
happiness, love and peace, the characteristic of Venus being peace
or placidity.
TEA CuP READING 81
Next is the sign of Jupiter, whose characteristic is expansion;
above it are placed an Eye and an Envelope, the Eye showing the
power of penetration, seeing things in a right perspective, and
light thrown on difficult questions, the letter showing that news
from all parts of the world is made possible by its e;icpansion.
Next come the Latin Cross and the watery sign Pisces, the
Fishes. These being in connection with Mercury, whose charac·
teristic is activity, show much alertness and desire for knowledge;
the Cross meaning obstacles and hindrances in the chosen path,
whilst the sign of Pisces denotes interesting news from distant
lands, with much desire for travel and exploration.
In the next space the Winecup and Spider, in connection with
the sign of Mars, the characteristic of Mars being energy, show the
strength, courage, and perseverance needed to carry out a suc·
cessful career; the Spider being a symbol of concenration, patience,
and achievement, whilst the Winecup tells of joy and realised
ambition.
Following these signs are the Cat's Head and the Heart, with
the Crescent Moon below. The characteristic of the Moon is
change, mobility; it is also a symbol of good fortune in the tea·
leaves. In combination with the Heart it indicates a romantic love
affair. The Cat's Head shows interference by those who are mean
and spiteful.
Having learned from this brief explanation the symbols of the
"Nelros Cup," the reading of the tea-leaves in relation to those
symbols will he easy. For instance, suppose the wife of a sailor
to he the consultant. Her husband is on his ship in the North
Sea, and she is eagerly awaiting news of him. In the cup she has
"turned," the symbol of a letter comes in the watery sign ) ·(
with a largy ivy leaf beneath it. Further patience will be neces-
sary, the ivy leaf tells us, as the wished-for letter is still far away.
The distance from the handle (the consultant) shows this, also
the letter symbol being in the watery sign indicates the fact that
it will come from across the sea. The waiting for the news causes
a feeling of disappointment and sadness; these will vanish later
on, and the waiting be compensated by the happy news that will
come in the longed-for letter. This is seen by the tea-leaves which
appear on other symbols of the cup.
The form of a man is seen between the signs of the Bell and
Club; near this form is the letter "A," the first letter of the con·
sliltant's name. Round this initial letter is a well-formed circle;
a trident lies at a little distance from it.
Here is evidence of the joyful news coming from her husband,
the tea-leaves in the spaces of the Bell and Club making a pre·
diction of the satisfactory news a safe one. The circle round the
letter "A" and the symbol of the trident near, enable the seer to
prophesy a good promotion, much success and happiness.
This example reading of the "Nelros" cup is a fortunate one.
82 SECRETS OF INDIA
We will now consider one of a less satisfactory character.
The consultant is a widow; opposite the handle of the cup she
has "turned" is the Envelope over Jupiter, upon the Envelope
tea-leaves forming an Owl are seen, beneath is a small arrow point·
ing towards the handle. These signs foretell bad news probably
coming from a far country; the sign of Jupiter and the distance
from the handle (the consultant) would show this. The symbol
of the Owl indicates the anxiety caused by the arrival of the letter
and its news. The arrow pointing towards the handle would
show that the matter is personal, and will much affect the con·
sultant.
Upon the sign of Saturn, with an arm stretched towards the
Spade above it, is the figure of a man. The characteristic of Saturn
being privation, and the Spade being a symbol of toil, it is evi-
dent that the figure of the man represents someone related to the
consultant for whom the present prospects are very bad. It may
well be this man from whom is coming the news in the letter
which will cause her so much anxiety.
Fortunately, on the Anchor at the bottom of the cup is a well-
formed key. Being in this position, it shows that someone at a
distance, having the welfare of the consultant much in their mind,
will be the means in the future of helping her out of the difficulties.
The Key being on the Anchor indicates the security she may feel
in the friends, who will be instrumental in giving her happiness
and peace of mind.
These two example divinations will illustrate the manner in
which the tea-leaves are read in relation to the signs upon the
cup. To some it may appear an easier means than that of the
ordinary tea-cup.
In any case it is very useful to have an alternative method of
foretelling the future. Variety is always acceptable, and for this
reason I recommend the "Nelros Cup of Fortune" to my readers.

MIRACLE DIETING SYSTEM 85
NOTE: To obtain satisfactory results you must follow the
directions as set down above absolutely, use no sugar in tea or
coffee and positively no sweet dessert of any kind. No bread must
be eaten except whole wheat in toasted form. If you become
hungry between meals you may eat an orange or half of a grape·
fruit.
This system in 18 days will rid the digestive tract and stomach
of poisons and ulcerations; will tone the blood and above all
remove excess fat.
In many cases this system has eliminated as much as twenty
pounds of overweight in 18 days.
If used for weight reduction, after the 18th day you may return
to the first day's diet and start over again, hut in so doing you can
if tired of toast, eat plain whole wheat bread with very little
butter, and substitute other vegetables where cooked in water only,
use no milk at any time either in cooking or as a drink. '
In frying eggs where prescribed, use a very little butter.
If impossible to broil steak where prescribed, fry in dry iron
skillet, use no butter or lard and fry well done.
BEAUTY SECRETS
PREFACE
X
F I were asked to prepare a list of the factors that make
a woman beautiful I would put correct weight at the
top. A woman whose weight is right for her age and
height is usually healthy and well-proportioned. It is the over-
weights and underweights whose figures fall short of the ideal
and whose complexions are sallow or blemished.
Next on my list of beauty points I would place correct posture.
Hollow backs, round shoulders, turtle necks, flat chests and prom-
inent abdomens are incompatible with health and beauty. It is
impossible to look chic unless one has learned the secret of poise
and the correct carriage of the body. Besides being ungraceful,
a poor posture has a bad effect on the functioning of the internal
organs and the nervous system.
The habitual expression of the face, especially of the eyes and
mouth, is a third beauty factor. Plain, even ugly features may be
illuminated by a kind, interested look. Eyes that are sparkling
with health and animation are naturally greater beauty assets
than dull, strained, stupid eyes.
The condition of milady's complexion is an important element
in her beauty. If she has good health, if she eats wisely and ex-
ercises regularly, she will not have any serious skin blemishes. A
dull, sallow skin usually indicates a sluggish circulation, lack of
fresh air and irregular elimination of waste products from the
body. The rightful facial cleansing methods for each individual
are of course essential also. Almost all of milady's beauty prob-
lems hark back to her general state of health. This is as true of
her hair as of her complexion. Glossy, abundant hair of a pretty
shade grows from healthy scalps.
The wrinkles that run from the wings of the nose to the corners
of the mouth are sometimes very stubborn to remove if of long
standing. Almost every face, either full or thin, has a tendency to
form these lines, but when the cheeks, throat and neck are kept
elastic, supple and flexible, these wrinkles do not become fixed.
It is when the skin and the underlying tissues are flabby or
shrunken through lack of exercise and massage that expression
lines etch their paths deeply' into any part of the face.
Parenthesis wrinkles should be massaged regularly with an
upward rotary movement, using the first two fingers. The choice
of the lubricating medium depends on the type of skin. For a
skin that is not excessively dry use plain cold cream. Dry, scaly
skin requires an oil specially prepared for the purpose.
86
BEAUTY SECRETS 87
Night is the best time to give the treatment. On retiring cleanse
the face and neck with cleansing cream. Wipe off the cream with
a soft cloth. Apply the tissue cream, oil, or massage cream, and
massage lightly with an upw;:ird rotary motion. Pat the cream in
well, leave on the face while you take the facial and neck exer-
cises that I will give later. Remove excess cream.
MORNING
On awakening in the morning, throw off the bedclothes and take
five or six deep, slow breaths as you lie there. Fill the lower lungs
first, then the middle part and lastly the chest. Breathe fully and
rhythmically. Stretch your limbs well.
Next jump out of bed and take brisk exercises for five or ten
minutes, using modern calisthenics.
After these brief exercise periods take a cold or tepid sponge
or shower. If you do not get a good warm reaction, however,
you may substitute a brisk rub-down with a coarse, dry towel to
stimulate your skin.
EVENING
At bedtime repeat your morning exercises. Take a warm hath
followed by a tepid rinse. Cleanse your face and neck with cold
cream and wipe off the grime. If your skin is oily, wash with pure
soap and water after the creaming. Rinse and apply an astringent.
Treat any complexion blemishes you may have such as blackheads,
pimples, enlarged pores, or wrinkles.
Massage your scalp well for several minutes. Brw.sh your eye-
brows and lashes with white vaseline if they need strengthening
or darkening. Use a small eyebrow brush for the purpose and
follow the natural arch of your brows from nose to temples. If
your eyes are weak, bathe them in boric-acid solution.
Massage your hands with a good food cream if they need soften-
ing or filling out. After the tissue food has been applied thickly,
wear old, loose gloves overnight to keep the cream on.
After getting into bed take a few deep, slow breaths. Relax
mentally and physically, dismiss firmly any unhappy or troubled
thoughts and fall into a restful slumber. Sleep with windows
open and a good circulation of fresh air through the room.
Besides the daily beauty. program I have just outlined, your
beauty needs to be fostered by special weekly or semi-weekly
treatments. A thorough facial massage, a manicure and special
care of the feet should be included. Twice a month a shampoo
is usually required.
All the external treatments in the world will not undo the ill
effects of unhygienic living. Choose a wise diet, eat temperately,
drink plenty of water between meals, exercise daily out-of-doors,
sleep enough, but not too much and keep a tranqnil mind, if you
wish to gain or keep good health and good looks.
88 SECRETS OF INDIA
TIGHTENING SAGGING SKINS
When the subcutaneous fat on the face or neck wastes away the
skin is left in flabby folds. The cause of the wasting may be
rapid loss of weight due to illness or the too enthusiastic follow-
ing of a reducing program. Middle age also brings a natural
diminution in the amount of fatty padding that once produced
the round contours of youth.
In the case of underweights the simplest way to tighten the skin
is to build up the tissues beneath. Flabby skins, however, are
often on faces of women who do not need to gain weight. Their
problem is to smooth out the skin with astringents and tone up
the facial muscles so that they will have greater elasticity.
A simple facial pack or compress that will be found refreshing
and beneficial to such types of skin is composed of a mask of
clean absorbent co.tton, saturated with a mild astringent lotion
and laid over the face. Before applying the pack, however, the
skin should be cleansed with cold cream. Wipe off the cream.
Plain witch-hazel may be used, but here is a good recipe that may
suit some skins better: Five grains powdered tragacanth, six
minims tincture benzoin, six minims alcohol, two drams glycerin,
six ounces of rose water. Have the ingredients well blended and
squeeze out the cotton paid in the resulting liquid. Lie down with
eyes closed and cover your face with the wet cotton, leaving only
lips and nostrils exposed. Relax all over for ten or fifteen min-
utes and then remove cotton. This treatment may be taken twice
a week or whenever you wish to freshen and smooth out your skin
after an especially busy or tiring day.
The same astringent lotion may be used after the nightly cleans-
ing of the face at bedtime and then it should be patted on gently
and allowed to dry.
There is no use under the sun in wasting time on purely local
treatments unless they are supplemented by a bright mental atti·
tude that keeps the mouth from drooping, and by good general
health, insured by a periodic physical examination by a physician.
After these two requirements are met then is the time for creams,
astringents and correct massage.
ASTRINGENTS
It is common knowledge that heat expands and cold contracts.
Steaming or washing one's face in hot water causes the pores to
open to give up their oily secretions mixed with grime. Contrac-
tions of the tiny openings in the skin may be brought about by the
application of cold water, and by use of astringents, such as witch-
hazel, benzoin, toilet waters, skin lotions, peroxide, lemon juice
and commercially advertised astringents.
A mild astringent lotion may be made as follows: Four ounces
of rose water, one dram boric acid, one dram tincture of benzoin,
two ounces witch-hazel. Add the benzoin drop by drop to the
BEAUTY SECRETS 89
rose water, dissolve the boric acid in witch-hazel, add the two so-
lutions together. Shake before using. Apply with absorbent
cotton.
A pimply skin may be massaged with a balsam cream or other
suitable lotion three or more times a week. Here is a good mas-
sage lotion to use: One and one-half ounces of glycerin, eight
ounces of elder-flower water, one teaspoonful borax. Apply with
a piece of clean absorbent cotton and allow it to dry on the skin.
Another fine lotion for a pimply skin may be made of one-half
pint rose water and thirty grains sulphate of zinc.
An astringent lotion may be used after the cleansing treatment
and also before the face powder is applied in the morning. Here
is a simple recipe: Two ounces elder-flower water, two ounces
rose water, one dram glycerin, one dram spirits of camphor, one
dram precipitated sulphur.
Often a touch of iodine or mercuro-chrome will dry up a new
pimple and thus save further trouble. Exposure to the sun for
10 or 15 minutes to produce a mild case of sunburn is also helpful
for skins inclined to break out with pimples. After this treat-
ment apply the following lotion: Two drams sulphate zinc, one
and one-half ounces rose water, one-half dram sublimated sul-
phur. Shake the mixture well before using and allow it to dry
on the skin.
A stronger lotion that has proved very successful as a remedy
for pimples and blackheads may be made as follows: Mix four
ounces of rose water with one-half ounce sulphate of zinc and mix
six ounces of rose water with one-half ounce sulphuretted potash.
Blend the two mixtures thoroughly and shake before using.
A weekly facial pack of boric acid and cold cream is often help-
ful to complexions marred by pimples. To make the pack, mix
two tablespoonfuls boric acid with enough boiling water to make
a thin paste. Now blend in about one tablespoonful of cold cream.
Steam the face lightly with hot towels and then spred the pack
on evenly. Leave it on for an hour or more.
When pimples are chronic the advice of a physician or a skin
specialist should be sought. Needless to say, pimples should never
he scratched open with the finger nails as this invites infection.
BLACKHEADS IN SENSITIVE SKINS
When blackheads appear in coarse, oily skins a steaming pro-
cess is usually recommended, but if they are found in tender, sen-
sitive skins that are not excessively rich in natural oil, a milder
treatment is quite as effective and not so irritating to the com-
plexion. Dry or blotchy skins that flush easily should also have
the gentler treatment for loosening the blackheads.
The close of the day is usually the best time for taking treat-
ments of this kind. First cleanse the skin with cold cream and
wipe off the grime with a pad of soft absorbent cotton. Press out
90 SECRETS OF INDIA
the larger blackheads that will come out easily. Dash some cold
water on your face, dry thoroughly and apply the following salve
to the affected areas: One dram ichthyol ointment, one-half dram
zinc oxide, one dram starch, one and one-half drams petrolatum.
Leave this on overnight.
Next morning wipe off the salve with a clean absorbent cotton
pad; then wash your face with warm. water and pure Castile soap.
Rinse in cold water and dry well. Squeeze out a fresh cotton pad
in cold water. Put a little cold cream on it, then sprinkle with a
few drops of astringent lotion. Wipe your face with this pad
before applying your face powder. Give this whole treatment
three times a week.
On the alternate days the face may receive the usual nightly
cleansing. Some women prefer cold cream alone for this pur-
pose. When the soap-and-water cleansing is used for tender
skins, the water should be softened with oatmeal and only the
purest and mildest soap should be used. The handiest way to use
oatmeal is to tie a tablespoonful of it in a small cotton bag and
let it soak in one's wash basin. Whatever cleansing method is
used it should be followed by a rinse in cold water or the appli-
cation of an astringent lotion to refine the skin.
BLEACHING A NATURALLY DARK SKIN
A beauty problem that is troubling some of my readers of both
sexes is a dark complexion. A clear olive skin with a warm glow
beneath it is attractive, but a dark, muddy one is not.
Of course, it is impossible for a dark-skinned brunette to change
into a fair-complexioned type, and even if it were, the colE)r of
eyes, hair, and lips would have to be changed also to harmonize
with the new skin tints. The quantity of pigment in the skin is
what determines its natural hue, but there are also various avoid-
able causes that make the skin darker than it should be.
Exposure to sun and wind is the commonest cause of darkening.
Some degree of tanning can scarcely be avoided in sunny, hot
weather, but the effects may be mitigated by appropriate precau-
tions before and after going out of doors. Although bleaching
treatments cannot lighten one's natural color they can keep the
skin from becoming any darker. A weekly bleaching pack of
cornmeal and buttermilk is very helpful for any type of dark or
medium skin.
There are internal conditions that cause the gradual darkening
· of the skin or the appearance of brown spots or patches especially
upon forehead and cheeks. In such cases a physician is one's best
beauty specialist.
Usually persons with naturally dark complexions become dark-
er as they pass into middle life. The change may be attributed to
a variety of causes, chiefly to neglect of regular bleaching treat·
BEAUTY SECRETS 91
ments. Here an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of tardy
cure.
There is still another thing that makes a dark skin darker to all
intents and purposes. This is the effect of our environment, es·
pecially the color of our clothes. Just as it is possible to make
oneself look stouter or slimmer by a thoughtful selection of clothes,
so it is quite practicable to make one's complexion look a shade
or two lighter or darker by wearing certain colors. It is well
worth while to study the subject. In general, all dark dresses
should be relieved at the neck and cuffs with some becoming light
color, like deep cream, sand, apricot or dull pink. Burgundy, dark
blue, dark green, soft dark green, red, purple, mahogany, may be
worn with a light bertha or yoke that will keep a dark color away
from the face. Small touches of bright red are permissible on a
dress a shade darker than the skin. Clothes that are lighter than
the skin will of course make the complexion seem darker by con·
trast, but a little light tone is needed to reflect on the face.
How To CARE FOR A DRY COMPLEXION
Skins of this type should be cleansed sparingly, if at all, with
soap, as most soaps tend to make the skin dryer. Pure Castile or
olive-oil soaps are best. 'Highly scented, cheap soaps should be
avoided. Medicated soaps are good in some cases.
For a dry, sensitive skin, I would suggest washing with soap
only in the evening. Never go outdoors right after washing the
face if you skin is sensitive to the cold. Protect it with cold cream
and powder before going out.
After washing and drying the face, a skin food should be ap·
plied.
An excellent lotion for the purpose may be made of the oils of
olives and sweet almonds. To six tablespoonfuls of olive oil add
one tablespoonful of the almond oil and one teaspoonful of tine·
ture of benzoin. Mix well. The last named ingredient is put in
to counteract the tendency of the olive oil to darken the skin.
Apply the lotion to face and neck before retiring for the night
and next morning wash off what remains with warm water. Here
is another good lotion for the same purpose: Mix one-half cup of
pure almond meal with one cup of milk. Let it stand a few min-
utes then strain through clean cheesecloth. Add one tablespoon
of glycerin and three drops of tincture of benzoin. Apply to the
face after washing, let the lotion dry, then wash off with clear
water.
MOLES, wARTS AND BIRTHMARKS
There is no necessity for resigning oneself to disfigurement by
moles, warts or birthmarks in this scientific age. Such blemishes
can be removed without leaving a scar in most ·cases if the work
is done skilfully. These treatments, however, should not be in-
92 SECRETS OF INDIA
trusted to inexperienced hands. They are outside the field of the
~verage beauty expert and should be undertaken only by a skin
specialist or physician.
TATTOO MARKS
Quite often the individual desires the marks removed, but this
is a difficult matter. In extensive cases an operation is necessary.
This consists of the removal of the superficial layers of the skin,
followed by skin grafting. Another method employed for the
removal of these disfiguring tattoo marks is freezing with carbon-
dioxide snow which resulti in the destruction of the tissues affected
and the formation of scar tissue. On small pigmented areas the
galvantic needle is sometimes used and found successful.
FRECKLE BLEACHES
Skins that freckle easily are usually found upon pure blondes
and Titian blondes. When this type of skin is properly taken care
of it is capable of becoming very beautiful on account of its
natural delicacy. The dark pigment in the brunette's complexion
protects it somewhat from the effects of the sun's heat. A good
lotion for clearing the skin of freckles may be made as follows:
Sulphocarbolate of zinc, one-half dram; glycerin, one and one-
half ounces; rose water, four ounces; Cologne water, three drams.
Shake well together, moisten a small piece of clean linen, or absor·
bent cotton, and apply several times a day. ,
Here are two mild bleaches for freckles: (1) One ounce glycerin,
two ounces rose water, one-half dram powdered sal ammoniac, one-
half ounce lemon juice, one-half pint distilled water or rose water;
or (2) one ounce glycerin, one ounce rose water, two drops tinc-
ture of benzoin.
Some may need a more drastic remedy like the following: Four
ounces lactic acid, two ounces elder-flower water, three ounces
glycerin, a tiny pinch of borax. This may be diluted with more
elder-flower water or rose water if it proves too strong.
The following cucumber lotion is good for bleaching tan and
freckles: Peel and cut three large cucumbers. Stew them with a
little water. Strain the juice and add to it three tablespoonfuls of
toilet alcohol. Let the mixture stand for four of five hours, or
overnight. Add ten drops tincture of benzoin, one tablespoonful
each of olive oil, milk of almonds, and rose water.
STUBBORN FRECKLES
Freckles are a cutaneous affection, appearing on the face, arms,
and hands in the hot period of summer and give a stained appear-
ance to the countenance. Some persons have freckles the whole
year around. These are usually stubborn and never quite dis-
appear, but they may be made lighter by applying a weekly
bleaching pack and a mild lotion two or three times a day dur-
ing hot weather. ·
BEAUTY SECRETS 93
The preparation for the bleaching pack is like that of any
facial massage. First apply cold cream to the face with a firm
but gentle upward stroke. Leave it on a few moments before
wiping it off with a soft cloth. Wring out a Turkish towel in
hot water and hold it against the skin. If the arms are being
treated, wrap them in the hot towel from shoulders to fingers.
Have another towel to apply before the first one cools. Steam
the skin in this way four or six times. Next spread on the pack.
Various bleaching packs may he used. Here is one with a corn-
meal base that is easy to make. The ingredients are: One table-
spoonful of the meal, two tablespoonfuls stearate of zinc, one
tablespoonful lemon juice, one-half teaspoonful borax and enough
buttermilk to make a smooth paste.
Leave the pack on for an hour, keeping it moist with butter-
milk. Wash it all off carefully with tepid water, blot the skin
dry, then rub in a li.ttle soothing lotion or cucumber cream. If it
is not bedtime finish the treatment by dusting some pure talcum
powder over the skin.
A quick, harmless bleach for the skin is as follows: Three
tablespoonfuls peroxide, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, six
drops of benzoin, three tablespoonfuls of almond meal or fine
oatmeal. Cover the meal with witch-hazel.
Let the meal stand for a few minutes, covered with the witcb-
hazel, then strain ·and add the other liquids. To give this treat-
ment, prepare as for other facial massage, cover the hair with a
towel, place your bleach handy, massage with cream first, remove,
apply hot towels, massage with your skin.food cream and wipe
it off. Now cover your eyebrows with pads of absorbent cotton,
as you do not want to bleach the eyebrows or lashes, and cover
the face with a thin towel or absorbent cotton that has been dipped
in your bleach. Allow it to remain on face for ten to fifteen min-
utes until the skin is brought to a deep pink but not long enough
to be uncomfortable. Remove and apply another hot towel. Re-
move, dry, and massage with a little cream, very lightly. Re-
move, apply cold towel and a skin tonic. ·Dry and powder. This
may be taken once a week or used alternately with the regular
beauty clay every other week.
MAKE-UP
THE CORRECT POWDER BASE
The oily type of skin with enlarged pores is usually the most
difficult to keep well powdered. . The make-up tends to mix with
the natural oil to form unsightly lumps or else the powder refuses
to remain on it at all. The thing to do in this case is not to buy
a new brand of cosmetics, but to correct the excessive oiliness by
the use of astringent applications. After the pores have thus been
reduced to normal size, vanishing cream will make a successful
powder base.
94 SECRETS OF INDIA
For tender, dry skins that chap and flake off easily, an oily base
is most satisfactory. Cold cream may be massaged in and then
the excess wiped off before the powder is dusted on. The light film
of cream on the face will hold the powder and protect the com·
plexion. Cold cream for this purpose may be bought ready-pre·
pared or it may be made at home of the following ingredients:
Two ounces of rose water, two ounces oil of sweet almonds or
olive oil, one-half ounce spermaceti, one-half ounce white wax,
one-half dram tincture of benzoin. Melt the waxes and oil in a
double boiler, stir in the rose water and benzoin and beat the
mixture well. Pour into jars to cool.
A liquid powder base that is suitable for the average skin is
made of one and one-half drams of subnitrate of bismuth, thirty
grains of powdered starch, two drams glycerin and one and one·
half ounces rose water. Mix the first two ingredients together, then
gradually stir in the glycerin and las.tly the rose water. The lotion
may be thinned with more rose water if desired. Moisten a clean
piece of absorbent cotton in this liquid and wipe the skin with it
before applying powder.
The regular use of powder has a drying effect on sensitive skins
that may be counteracted by using cleansing cream to remove the
make-up. The cream will not make the complexion too oily nor
encourage the growth of facial hair, as some of my readers fear,
if an astringent lotion is used after the cream is wiped off.
POWDERIN G A DRy SKIN
When your complexion is in proper condition face powder will
stay on smoothly, but if the skin is dry and flaky, the powder will
reveal all its little cracks, lines, and roughness. If you examine
your skin very closely after powdering you will notice that the
skin in some places, as on the nose, seems to be in flakes which
catch and hold the powder under their edges. As you know, your
skin is constantly being renewed from beneath as it throws off
the outer layers of cells; when these dead flakes of skin remain
partially attached they make the complexion look rough, chapped,
or finely wrinkled. For a skin like this, cold cream cleansing will
soften and dislodge these outworn bits of skin better than other
cleansing methods. After applying the cream, leave it on a few
minutes, then wipe it off with a clean cotton pad moistened in an
astringent lotion. In the morning cleanse your face in the same
way, applying a creamy foundation as a powder base, then use
a lighter grade of powder than you have been using. After your
skin has become smoother you may cleanse it with soap and water
part of the time and with cold cream on alternate nights.
How To UsE MAKE-UP
Girls under twenty years of age should need practically no
make-up. For evening it is a good plan to use a trifle, since ar·
J
·~,
•
BEAUTY SECRETS 95
tificial lighting takes away one's natural color. But whatever is
used should be put on so skilfully that few will guess that it is
not one's own hue.
It must be remembered that there is a great gulf fixed between
the theatrical make-up and the kind suitable for business or social
occasions. Many girls apparently do not realize this. The pur-
pose of the former is the entirely legitimate one of emphasizing
the faces of actors or actresses so that they may be seen clearly
at a distance. Heavy powders and grease paint are required for
use on the stage, as this make-up has the advantage of staying on
all the evening and even if it cracks the audience is not close
enough to notice.
But grease paint as a foundation for a make-up is entirely out
of place off the stage. Unless one's face is as immobile as a doll's
the paint will crack. The correct make-up for street, home or office
should begin with a generous application of pure cold cream.
Next, with a clean soft cloth rub off most of the cream leaving
just enough to hold the face powder.
The addition of rouge to the cheeks .complicates the problem
of artistic make-up. Even when the right shades of powder and
rouge have been selected they sometimes make an unpleasant
shade of pink when mixed on the cheeks. This trouble may be
corrected by changing the method of making up. Some women
apply the rogue first, powder lightly over it and add another
touch of color. Others prefer to powder first, rouge, and then
dust on another fine film of powder, blending the color at the
edges. Whatever method you follow, be sure to dust off any
superfluous powder in order to prevent it from showing on the
eyelashes, eyebrows and corners of nose and mouth.
Remember that a heavy application of color will make the face
look sunken at that point. Rouge applied too low on the cheeks
give an old, haggard look to the face while if it is put on too high
it suggests the hectic flush of the tuberculous patient. A happy
medium should be sought.
A very delicate shade of brown may be rubbed on the upper
eyelids to make the eyes appear brighter. An eyebrow pencil or
stick of theatrical grease paint may be used for this purpose.
Next apply a suitable shade of face powder, pressing it on, not
rubbing it. With a fluff of clean cotton or a soft baby brush dust
off the excess powder. Brown mascara may be used to darken
very blonde lashes and eyebrows after all powder has been care·
fully brushed out of them. The lipstick may be used next. Apply
from the inside, work the color out, gradually blending the color
to the edge and soften naturally where the white skin begins. A
delicate accent with the lipstick will bring out the Cupid's-bow
but a crudely formed Cupid's-bow looks artificial, especially when
the dry, pale, partly concealed shape of the lips shows up to dis·
advantage when speaking or laughing. Cold cream should be
96 SECRETS OF INDIA
applied before using the lipstick to remove the powder or dry-
ness. Do not moisten the lips with the saliva or bite them to
make them look red, as this tends to dry and discolor and make
the skin rough.
At bedtime all powder and rouge should he removed with
cleansing cream. It is particularly important to take off the
mascara as it is likely to get into the eyes and inflame them; rub
white vaseline into the lashes to take up the coloring matter, then
wipe it off thoroughly. The face may then be washed with luke-
warm water if desired.
If the beauty of the lips depends entirely upon their natural
shape, a large portion of women would have to be contented
with unattractive lips. But this is not the case. There are two
other ways in which the mouth may be truly beautiful .
Just as it takes a good complexion as well as good features to
make an attractive face, so it is necessary that the skin of the lips
he kept soft and smooth in order to have a pretty mouth. Parched,
dry, peeling skin would make the most beautifully formed lips
look ugly, and no one can blame justly her forebears for such a
condition, which is merely the result of a lack of care. Even if the
lips are not delicately shaped they may be beautiful in the velvety
texture of the skin.
Pale faded lips usually indicate a poor circulation. Merely to
use a lipstick is a shortsighted way to cover up their defects tem·
porarily. The wise woman will realize that the physical con-
dition betrayed by her colorless lips is a serious menace to her
youth and beauty and she will begin to correct it at once by right
diet and exercise. In the meantime she may use a salve or lip-
stick to protect and color her lips.
Every gid and woman owes it to herself to keep her lips smooth
and full as .long as possible. Puckered, dry lips are one of the
signs of growing old, and there are few in our day and generation
who do not wish to hold off as long as they can the evil day
when they must admit they are no longer young. The only way
to keep the lips young is to use a soothing salve or lotion upon
them every day and to avoid the bad habit of biting or licking
them. Plain cold cream may be used or the following recipe may
be made up: One ounce spermaceti, two ounces olive oil, one-
half ounce white wax, four drops oil of rose geranium, two drops
cochineal. The last named ingredient may he omitted if a white
salve is desired. Melt the waxes and oil together in a double
boiler, remove from the fire and beat in the perfume and color-
ing matter when the mixture has cooled somewhat.
Another good recipe is as follows: One ounce glycerin, two
ounces oil of sweet almonds, five drops oil of eucalyptus, one
dram white wax. Melt the wax, heat in the almond oil, add the
glycerin, stir together. Add the oil of eucalyptus last, when mix-
ture is almost cold.

salve or a lotion on your lips before going out of doors to
keep them from cracking.
CARE OF THE TEETH
If your teeth are even and beautiful, cultivate a smile that
shows them, but if they are irregular and imperfect, practice a
smile that partly conceals them.
For whitening and beautifying yow teeth use a pinch of plain
table salt on your tooth brush with warm water, rinse and brush
with cold water. This is also excellent for keeping the breath
,sweet and pure on account of the strongly-antiseptic properties of
salt. If the teeth are very yellow and discolored one teaspoonful
of peroxide in a glass of water used to brush the teeth will bleach
them. Rinse with cold water. With clean white teeth and a
sweet voice, a smile possesses irrestible charm.
It is a scientific fact that many pains and aches throughout the
body can be traced to unhealthy teeth. It is, therefore, essential
to perfect health to keep the teeth in sound condition through
regular attention. Make it a habit to consult a reliable dentist
twice a year. The teeth should be thoroughly cleansed after every
meal. They should, also, be brushed the first thing in the morning.
It is a good practice to gargle, clean the teeth, then drink a glass
of hot or cold water before breakfast.
CORRECT ADULT PROPORTIONS
Although according to classic standards a woman should be
eight heads tall, in modern times seven and a half heads is con-
sidered a good proportion. This means that if a woman's head is
nine inches high, her height ought to be nine times seven and a
half, or sixty-seven and one-halfinches, or five feet seven and one-
half inches.
A woman whose head is eight and three-quarters inches high
should be 65 % inches tall, or five feet five-eights inches. This
height should be divided in the following way: Top of head to
bottom of chin, eight and three-quarters inches; from chin to
waistline, thirteen and three-eights inches; from the latter point
to the top of hip bones and about level with the navel, four and
three-eights inches; thence to the widest part of the hips, eight
and three-quarters inches; to the bottom of the knee-cap, thirteen
and one-eighth inches; from there to the heels, seventeen and one-
half inches. The elbows should come to the top of the hip bones
and the fingers should reach about halfway down the thighs.
PERFECT MEASUREMENTS
There are various types of figures just as there are different t}rpes
of coloring and different temperaments. There is the flat boyish
figure that is normal to girls in their early teens. Then there is
the slender, girlish figure that reaches its perfection in the late
98 SECRETS OF INDIA
teens _
or early twenties. In this type the bust and hips measure
the same. The height may be from five feet three inches to five
feet six inches, and the weight from 120 to 130 pounds. Other
physical specifications are: Neck, twelve and one-half or thirteen
inches; bust and hips, thirty-four; waist, twenty-six; thigh, nine-
teen to twenty; wrist, six to seven; ankle, seven and one-half to
eight; calf, thirteen and one-half.
The figure of the mature young woman is naturally more de-
veloped than either of the two immature types just described. She
has more right to claim the title of "perfect" than they have be-
cause her development is complete. Her bust measure ranges
from thirty-four to thirty-eight inches and her hips are two or
more inches larger than her bust measurements.
While it would be foolish to say all women of a given height
and age should have certain specifications, it may interest my
readers to know what are regarded as the correct measurements
of several ideally formed young women. Here they are: -Height,
five feet, five inches; waist, twenty-five and one-half inches; hips,
thirty-five and three quarters inches; thigh, twenty-one and one-
quarter inches; weight, if about twenty-four or twenty-five years
old, 130 pounds; bust, thirty-three inches; wrist, six and one-
quarter inches; forearm, nine and three-quarters inches; neck,
thirteen ind1.es.
American Venus-Height, five feet, six inches; neck, thirteen
and one-half inches; bust, thirty-four inches; waist, twenty-six
and one-half inches; hips, thirty-seven and one-half inches; thigh,
twenty inches; calf, thirteen and one-half inches; ankle, eight
inches; weight, 128 pounds.
Miss America, 1924--Neck, Twelve and one-half inches; bust,
thirty-four inches; waist, twenty-six inches; hips, thirty-four inches;
wrist, six inches; thigh, twenty inches; calf, thirteen and one-half
inches; ankle, seven and one-half inches.
Miss America, 1925-Neck, thirteen and one-half inches; bust,
thirty-four inches; waist, twenty-six and one-half; hips, thirty-
seven and one-half inches; wrist, six inches; thigh, nineteen inches;
calf, thirteen and one-half inches; ankle, eight inches.
Miss America, 1926-Neck, twelve inches; bust, thirty-three
inches; waist, twenty-four and one-half inches; hips, thirty-three
and one-half inches; wrist, six inches; thigh nineteen and one-
half inches; calf, twelve and one-half inches; ankle, seven inches;
five feet, four and one-half inches; weight, 118 pounds; age eigh-
teen years.
When compared with the classic standard of feminine beauty, the
Venus de Milo, it is seen that the present ideals call for smaller
measurements of hips and waist. Venus' measurements are as
follows : Neck, fourteen and four-fifth inches; bust, thirty-four
inches; waist, thirty-one and one-fifth inches; hips, forty and four-
fifth inches; thigh, nineteen and one-half inches; calf, thirteen
BEAUTY SECRETS 99
and one-half inches; ankle, eight and one-half inches. Of course,
the Venus de Milo has a figure of a mature woman, whereas the
Miss Americas are young girls.
The Perfect Thirty-six measurements are as follows: Height,
five feet, five inches; neck, thirteen and one-half inches; waist,
twenty-six or twenty-eight inches; hips, forty inchefll; shoulders,
thirty-six and one-half inches; upper arm, twelve inches; forearm,
nine inches; chest, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight inches;
length of foot, nine inches; thigh, twenty-three inches; knee, four-
teen inches; calf, thirteen inches; ankle, seven and one-half inches.
The Perf,ect Thirty-six is fifteen and one-half inches from base
of neck behind to waist; forty-two inches from waist to floor. In-
side sleeve measure, nineteen and one-half inches; 75 per cent
of women are below the "thirty-six" standard; the rest are mostly
above it.
The mystic "Song of India" comes floating through the air
It's time for our Phenomena, so, I hunt an easy chair,
And listen to his answers on questions, great and small,
And know he does his very best to try to please us all.
You certainly are wonderful, I think you're doing fine,
But when you're answering questions, won't you please answer mine?
I've written and I've written and I sit and wonder why
In answering your que3tions mine always is pas3ed by.
I know you're very busy, and your broadcast time is short,
So I'll just wait patiently and try to be a sport,
And kaow that if it's fates decree that I get my reply
I'll surely be rewarded in the sweet bye-and-bye.

SHORT CUTS TO PHYSICAL FITNESS
"No time for exercise," is an excuse that many business girls
give for their neglect of physical culture. Their lives are so full
that they grudge the few minutes a day that are necessary for
keeping the body fit by exercise.
Excuses, however, have no weight with Mother Nature. S}ie
has decreed penalties of sedentary living, which are sluggish cir·
culation, poor complexion, digestive and nervous troubles of one
kind and another, round shoulders and thick hips and abdomens.
Business people who do not make a point of exercising regularly
every day are laying themselves open to any or all of these
troubles.
Yet the problem of finding time for exercises, especially in the
morning, is often a difficult one. Some ardent physical culturists
have found a convenient solution in exercises that are done while
one is dressing. This idea was first published about twenty years
ago, I believe, but it has recurred from time to time in periodical
literature. These dressing exercises are usually designed for
men, but there seems to me no reason why milady should not adapt
and improve upon them for her own use.
"Here are a few suggestions that will show you how to exercise
different parts of your body while you are putting on your clothes
and dressing your coiffure.
Exercise I.-When putting on your stockings, sit on the edge
of the bed. Bend one knee up on your chest; rock backwards
until your weight rests on the small of your back on the bed, your
shoulders and neck being raised so that your hands may begin
putting your stocking on your foot. As the stocking is drawn on,
straighten leg and stretch it up with pointed toe. Repeat with
other leg.
Exercise 2.-Before putting on your other garments, stand
ereci'., heels together. Stretch one leg forward and describe a wide
circle on the floor with pointed toe. When the toe reaches the back,
bend the knee sharply, bringing it up toward the chest. toe pointed
down. Thrust that leg into your step-ins or other undergarment
and repeat the exercise with other leg.
Exercise 3.-In donning dresses or any other clothes that go
over the head, you have a fine opportunity for a good stretching
exercise. Place hands in sleeve of the dress, then stretch arms
upwards, rise on your toes and inhale deeply.
Exercise 4.-Brushing and combing the hair gives an oppor-
tunity for some splendid arm, neck and trunk bending move-
ments.
Keeping the knees straight, bend over from the waist so that
your hair falls down over your face. Brush vigorously first with
one hand iffid then with the other.
.·~
BEAUTY SECRETS 103
Exercise 5.-When buttoning or lacing shoes, stand with knees
straight and bend over from the waist. This is a fine exercise for
reducing the abdomen.
HoRIZONTAL EXERCISE
Every one admits nowadays that daily exercise is good for one's
health, but not all of us have put that knowledge into prav-
tice, because the usual conception of setting-up exercises is that
they are very strenuous and take a good deal of time. There ar.e
all sorts of useful exercises, however, which may be done without
tiring oneself. I am going to describe some of these that should
especially appeal to the sedentary worker and the housewife or
business girl who is on her feet most of the day. They may be done
lying down on one side. It is a good plan to place a thin mattress
or cot pad on the floor to lie upon, although a hard bed may be
used.
Exercise 1.-Lie on the right side with right elbow close under
the side. Stretch the left or upper leg forward, pointing toe well
and bringing the hip forward. At the same time stretch the left
arm backward, twisting the upper part of the body to that side.
Repeat stretchings slowly three times, then turn over on your left
side and repeat again. This exercise is good for reducing the
waist and making the line from the armpit to the hip firm.
Exercise 2.-Lie on the right side with left hand on hip. Raise
left leg up as high as you can, then slowly lower it. Now bend tire
knee and kick the leg obliquely upward. Repeat five times on each
side. The exercise is designed to reduce flabby hips and thighs.
Exercise 3.-ln the same starting position clasp hands over
head. Now swing the upper leg forward and backward
pendulum-fashion, until slightly tired. Make the swings as wide
as you can, especially toward the back. The exercise is for mak-
ing the lower abdomen firm and reducing hips and back.
Exercise 4.-Stretch the upper arm above the head and• then
swing it in wide circles from the shoulder, keeping elbow straight.
Repeat ten to twenty times on each side. This fills out hollows in
the neck, strengthens the back and makes the bust firmer.
Exercise 5.-Still lying on one side put hands on hips. Slowly
rotate your head about five times. Stop if you feel dizzy. This is a
splendid exercise for keeping the neck and throat muscles firm
and youthful. Turn over on the other side and repeat.
EXERCISE FOR THE BusT
The exercises I am giving below are designed to make the nust
firm by bringing into play muscles that are not often used. It is
a great mistake to try to achieve this firmness by binding with
tight brassieres, which only make the muscles weak and baggy.
When they have reached this condition it is hard, and sometimes
104 SECRETS OF INDIA
impossible, to make them normal again.
Exercise 1.-Stand erect, with hands clasped at waistline on
left side of body. The exercise consists of pushing strongly to the
right against the resistance of the right hand. When the clasped
hands reach the r~ht side of the body, reverse the movement by
pushing with the right hand to the left against strong resistance
from tlie left hand. Repeat until tired.
Exercise 2.-Stand erect, with arms held out at each side at
shoulder level. Tense the muscles. Slowly cross the arms in front,
still at shoulder level and extended stiffiy, with elbows straight. Re·
turn to starting position. Repeat.
Exercise 3.-Fold arms over chest, raise elbows to shoulder
level, clench fists. Now pull the arms apart and out straight
slowly, keeping muscles tense all the time. Reverse motion and
:repeat.
Exercise 4.-Stand erect, upper arms at shoulder level, elbows
be~t, hands touching shoulders. Keeping the hands in position,
raise both elbows above head; lower elbows to chest, then swing
them back as far as possible. A good exercise for bust and shoul·
ders.
Exercise 5.-Here is another exercise for making the bust firmer
and removing flabbiness under the arms: Place right hand on hip
and incline the trunk slightly to that side. Extend left arm and
swing it forward across the chest and right shoulder. Swing it out
to the left side and then back of the body, bending elbow and
reaching as far over to the right as possible. Repeat the exercise
with each arm ten times.
For reducing the bust the exercise should be followed by alter-
nating hot and cold spongings for five minutes, then bathe in cold
salt water. Dry well.
For developing the bust, pat on some cocoa butter or olive oil
after the exercises and stroke gently upward with the palms of the
hands six times; do not use any pressure on the bust. Swimming
is one of the best exercises for the development of a shapely bust.
Deep-breathing exercises should be taken daily to increase the vi-
tality and improve the carriage of the flat-chested woman.
Good, clean living, proper dieting and plenty of outdoor ex-
ercise plays an important part in every woman's life.
Nature provides that every woman enjoy a beautiful figure, that
3he may attract the opposite sex, that she may be respected and
loved, if a woman does not take advantage of Nature's help, she
then has only herself to blame, if she does not possess the quali-
fications necessary to making her life one of happiness, health and
success.
PERSONAL MAGNETISM
~HROUGHOUT the history of humanity there have been
\.) men and women who apparently were endowed with
uncanny, mysterious and miraculous powers. We will
all admit that some men are endowed with more power than
others. Whence comes this power? Is it a gift of the gods which
is bestowed upon a chosen few and passes up the majority, or is it
a Universal Principle dormant in all, which only the few con·
sciously or unconsciously develop?
We very often honor, respect, worship, love and look up to cer-
tain people, not because of their physical powers, but because of
their mental and spiritual attributes.
When listening to the ideas or reading the opinions of influential
men, although their ideas and opinions may not instantly awaken
in us an understanding of all the physical requirements of life,
nevertheless they satisfy and apparently nourish an inner longing
of the Human Soul, and it is this satisfactory feeling of the inner
which makes us look up to those who are apparently endowed
with greater mental and often spiritual unfoldment.
The power called Personal Magnetism is a combination of the
physical and mental force. Both these forces may be developed
by an individual and a combination of both will give one a
Dynamic Personality.
Orators, singers, captains of industry and leaders of men in the
various professions are outstanding figures of this combination
of these two forces.
The present Dictator of Italy is a splendid example of the com·
bination of these two forces. In Gandhi of India, the leader of
non-resistance, we have the purely mental type of magnetism, not
having a combination of both the physical and mental forces. He
lacks the advantages of the type of mind like Mussolini. Gandhi
ideas could not be carried out in Italy.
The reason for this is that the people of the Orient are of a more
retiring and spiritual type than the people of the Occident. The
Occidental mind is more progressive and more energetic, there·
fore it requires a man with a combination of the two forces to
rule and lead.
We sometimes find great writers and intellectual ·geniuses lack-
ing in Personal Magnetism. While having the ability to express
facts, the ability to impress is not there. In modern phraseology,
they lack color and the ability to lead and influence others.
To have a combination of both the physical and mental forces
does not mean that an individual must have a robust physique,
for we very often find lanky, insignificant looking creatures who
are the possessors of both of these qualities.
Physical Magnetism or nerve energy is a natural force of nature.
Physical exercises, breathing and certain foods supply the body
105
106 SECRETS OF INDIA
with this natural energy. Athletes and those who indulge in all
sorts of outdoor exercises generally have an abundance of this
physical magnetism and nerve energy.
The surrounding atmosphere contains an abundance of this
natural force, which is conveyed to the body by breathing, thereby
energizing all the cells of the physical body. (In Oriental phrase·
ology this force is called Prana). It is in no sense related to the
fleshy body, but an independent force giving energy to the entire
nervous system, thereby stimulating all the nerves of the body.
BREATHING AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES
Physical exercises, accompanied by correct breathing in a mild
and moderate manner will give the student the necessary physical
magnetism. Great care should be taken not to overdo deep breath-
ing.
EXERCISE 1
Relax and sit very quietly in an upright position with the spine
straight and head erect. With mouth closed, exhale slowly and
then inhale through the nostrils. Then hold the breath for about
four seconds (the held breath should be done deeply but without
any strain whatever). Now exhale very slowly and as thoroughly
as possible without any jerks; wait a few seconds before inhaling
again. Do this exercise for about five minutes. The above exer-
cise will eliminate all impurities from the system, and will also
encourage rhythm and give vitality i:o the body.
EXERCISE 2
Sit in the same position as indicated in the above exercise. Now,
with the mouth closed, inhale slowly and while inhaling mentally
picture the breath as a fine silvery thread drawn slowly through
the nostrils and filling the lungs. Exhale very slowly and while
exhaling concentrate the mind upon the breath, still imagining
it as the silvery thread. The exhaling should be done very slowly.
Repeat this exercise until it can be done without effort.
EXERCISE 3
Stretch the arms forward, then raise them upward, and while
raising them upward inhale slowly and deeply. Now clench both
fists tightly. Hold the breath for four seconds.
EXERCISE 4
Stretch the arms before you horizontally. Clench both fists
tightly and turn them both away from each other, bringing the
knuckles downward while still holding the tenseness for a few
seconds. Now open the fingers slowly. Repeat this exercise a
few seconds.
•
PERSONAL MAGNETISM 107
EXERCISE 5
Stretch the hands and fingers by moving the hands backwards
from the wrist, clinching the hands tight and very slowly un-
clinching.
EXERCISE 6
Stand with both feet firmly on the floor. Stretch the neck slowly
back as far as possible without jerking, then bring the chin forward
until the chin touches the chest.
EXERCISE 7
Stand with both feet firmly on the floor, both hands at the side,
fists closed. Slowly rise on the balls of the feet and stretch the
body. Now take a deep breath through the nostrils, tense and
stretch the entire body. Imagine you are going to touch the
ceiling.
EXERCISE 8
Stand firmly on the floor, raise the right foot before you and
tense the calf-then relax. Now tense the thigh for a few seconds
and slowly relax. Alternate this exercise by doing the same thing
with the left foot.
EXERCISE 9
Stand firmly on the floor, sway the tru,nk in a rotating move-
ment, first to the left and then to the right.
These exercises or any of a similar nature will give energy to
the body.
Fooo
Certain foods will also supply the body with nerve energy.
Foods exposed to the rays of the sun, such as figs, grapes, oranges,
cabbage, spinach and nuts of all kinds have a tendency to tune up .
the system.
While the application of the above given principles may not
give one a personality which can be felt when in the presence of
others, one may become a fairly healthy person.
To have full control over the emotions and to utilize all the
forces of the personality will give an individual the powers which
make a Dynamic Personality and enable him to stand out and
impress his fellow men.
The emotions are powerful forces working in and through
the organism of man. The individual who allows himself to be
easily excited and to give vent to his feelings, or to show traces
of jealousy is weak. One of the greatest fallacies in the average
person is to fly into a rage over the least excitement.
Many believe that by creating a scene, babbling like a parrot,
and in general making a show of themselves is an indication of
strength. In reality it is only an indication of weakness, a waste
108 SECRETS OF INDIA
of strength and scattering of their energies. Noise is not strength
-the silent forces are the real forces. Electricity, one of the most
powerful forces of nature, is SILENT. The man who is desirous
of utilizing his natural energies will not allow any adverse emo·
tion to affect his equilibrium.
TRANSMUTATION OF EMOTIONS
The emotions may be either harmful or helpful to one's develop·
ment. A simple method of transmutation is this: When you feel
that you are about to lose your temper or be swayed by any emo·
tional force which you know will he a detriment to you, immedi-
ately affirm: "I AM DYNAMIC POWER," or "I AM A LIVING
BREATHING MAGNET." If any of the above affirmations are
made with feeling, the emotional force which may have had a
tendency to pull you down and scatter your energies will auto·
matically be transferred into mental power. Success depends upon
your conscious realization of the affirmation made. It must be
actually lived for a few seconds and become a part of your inner
Self.
ENERGY AND DETERMINATION
A comprehension of the principles which give energy to the
body is very important. But if this energy is wasted, not concen-
trated upon, it will go to waste. There are many men with an
overflow of energy who do not accomplish much. The reason for
this is there is no concentrated thought behind their actions. They
are fooling with this and that and wasting valuable time. They
are forever having new ideas and a certain amount of energy is
wasted on each idea, but they never accomplish much.
If you have a plan in mind which you KNOW will be advan·
tageous to some undertaking in ·your life, marshall together all
the forces of your personality. Guide and direct them into a
chosen channel and with undying determination utilize those forces
to reach your goal. Says Buxton, "The longer I live the more
certain I am that the great difference between men, the feeble and
the powerful, the great and the insignificent, is energy and an invin·
cible determination, a purpose once fixed and then Death or Vic·
tory. That quality will do anything that can be done in this world
and no talents, no circumstances, no opportunities will make a
two-legged creature a man without it." The trouble with some
men is that they under-estimate themselves. They do not realize
the power at their command. If the amount of energy that is daily
wasted were harnessed and directed in the right channel, much
could be accomplished.
THE MENTAL PHASES
The mental makeup of a person acts as a driving force, giving
atmosphere or color to the personality. The surrounding atmos·
phere of a very magnetic person is composed of waves of mag-
PERSONAL MAGNETISM 109
netic energy. This energy is also a part of the aura. It is this
wave of energy enveloping and radiating from a person which,
when coming enrapport with the minds of others, sets up a cor-
responding vibration and produces in the minds of those he comes
enrapport with, the same mental condition as his own. If those
he comes enrapport with are of a lower type of development or
lacking in the power of resistance, the more his personality will
be felt and naturally the greater will be his influence over them.
It can then be readily seen that in developing the higher phases
of personal magnetism, the development of the mind is an im-
portant factor. Working out the problems of daily life, if done
in a constructive and forceful manner, will give splendid results.
It is well to believe in something and a belief in GOD is good.
If not in GOD, then believe in yourself. But you must have a solid
foundation upon which to stand.
He who does not believe in anything will meet with little suc-
cess in life, no matter what his undertaking may be. "I will drink
yonder ocean," says the persevering soul; "yonder mountain will
move at my command." Have that kind of energy. Manifest that
kind of stick-to-it-iveness.
In your early training, it is well to capitalize upon your ability,
to capitalize on what you are. As a boy this idea became very
clear to the writer. When I was a young boy I had a great desire
to travel. I wanted to study the lives and habits of my fellow
men, but I did not have sufficient money with which to travel.
One day while attending a street bazaar I won a beautiful rug
in a lottery. After keeping the rug for a few days, I exchanged it
for a pair of goats. Then I sold goat's milk to the neighbors and
with the money derived from selling the milk I bought more goats.
In a short time I had a goat farm and from the proceeds of my
farm I was enabled to start on my first journey. I have since en-
circled the globe three times.
Capitalize upon what you are and then improve upon your
mental life, with never failing energy and determination. Man is
not what he THINKS HE IS. Man is only WHAT HE THINKS.
The sum total of your life is not based upon what you imagine
yourself to be, but upon the train of thoughts YOU harbor daily.
This is the real you and the mere fact that you try to expand
your mental life is an added factor in your development of power.
If a man's mental life is built upon a solid foundation, he may
say to himself: "Here I am, a child of nature; I know not whence
I came or whither I am going, but I am here upon the ashes of
my dead self (your past mental life). I will build my life over
again. My environment is a reflection of myself and I am a re-
flection of my environment."
When you stop to analyze your own life you will readily see
that man is the creator of his own surroundings. By harboring a
train of constructive thoughts and new ideas in contrast to the
llO SECRETS OF INDIA
surroundings which are detrimental to him, he is able to create
new conditions. To overcome inharmonious conditions, firmness
and positiveness are very essential.
Man should be judged not by his clothes
Nor by the God he serves,
Nor by his race, or tint of skin,
Nor by his loves or sins,
But by the nature of the thoughts he thinks.
STUDY OF HUMAN NATURE
'fhe saying that the greatest study of mankind is man still holds
good. The great leaders and outstanding figures in history who
have attained the power to rule the masses are the men who have
consciously or unconsciously made a keen study of human nature.
We find that in their study of mankind they were not afraid to
mingle with the vulgar and ignorant as well as the refined and
intellectual. The likes and dislikes; the moods and inclinations;
the desires and weaknesses---in fact, every phase of human nature
has been"
thoroughly studied.
Forming ideas from the known traits of human nature makes
it easy to call upon the emotions of the masses. We know that
the majority of people are swayed more by feeling than by think-
ing. If you try to reason with an unruly mob this fact becomes
very evident. A few followers would respond to an appeal to
reason, while an appeal to the emotions, the feelings and the preju-
dices would bring about a great following. When the emotions
control reason and logical thinking, the greater will be the fol-
lowing of the leader by the masses.
NON-ATTACHMENT
Non-attachment gives one the power to detach himself from
everything which might have power over him. Non-attachment does
not mean to be cold and indifferent to others, but it means that noth-
ing must affect you. You must be indifferent to the happenings in
your daily life. No matter what they may be, you must be non-
attached. Being non-attached gives you power over yourself.
The little trifles as well as the big problems of life must have
no effect upon the individual who is to be a leader of men. He
must build up within himself the power which will enable him
to resist any conditions adverse to him.
Nothing can have power over you until you admit it. Like the
lotus flower, which grows in the water but does not absorb it, so
must you acquire an inner mental control so that nothing can
effect your equilibrium.
PERSONAL MAGNETISM 111
VISION
Your vision must come from yourself and should be built ac-
cording to the mental concepts of your ideal. This does not mean
day dreaming ideas which are beyond your ability to put into
execution, but rather an inner realization which must be a part
of yourself.
He who visualizes something which is beyond his ability to
bring into manifestation will suffer defeat. Only in proportion
to his application of physical and mental means will his vision
materialize.
As an illustration, a man is desirous of improving his business.
He must mentally grow and also use physical efforts. In pro·
portion to his mental growth, so will be build step by step and
improve accordingly.
THE WILL
The will may be developed by intensive action and strengthened
by faith. Potentially in everyone I believe there is a certain
amount of will power and that in nearly all cases it is not the will
but the mind that requires training.
He who has the mind properly developed and trained can make
the will act as a dynamic force to spur him on to greater achieve-
ments. Many of us instinctively feel and know the power of the
will, but unless we are stirred by pain or danger, real or imaginary,
we lack the enthusiasm and energy to express it.
Our troubles then seem to be due to mental lassitude and we do
not put sufficient force back of the things we desire. We do not
care to pay the price for our accomplishments. We want to be
leaders and masters of others but never think of giving ourselves
a course in mental discipline.
EXERCISE FoR DEVELOPING THE WILL
At least once daily perform some disagreeable task. Go to
some place where you know you are not welcome. Do it cheer-
fully and as pleasantly as though you were doing something that
you really liked to do. It is easy to do something you like, but
doing something you do not care to do will be of great advantage
to your growth and development.
Fight the good fight for all that is right;
Within your SELF lies your strength and might;
Abolish all fear that may handicap you
And you will succeed in whatever you do.
Fight the good fight and stick to your goal;
Trust in the strength of your immortal soul.
Trust in your SELF and let go of "I can't;"
WILL and YOU CAN DO whatever yori want.
112 SECRETS OF INDIA
Although it is the birthright of every human being to acquire
knowledge of himself and to utilize the forces of his personality
to enable him to get the necessary things of life, it is also true
that this power should never be used to take advantage of others.
The power of a highly developed intellectuality without growth
of spiriutality would enable one to take advantage of persons of
a less highly developed mentality, and unless a man has had early
moral training he may not be able to resist the many temptations
which confront him. Some of the greatest criminals of our time
have been men of pronounced intellectual qualifications.
In searching for and acquiring power, it is best to utilize that
power for unselfish purposes, and for helping others.
He who uses his power for any other purpose in life treads
upon very dangerous ground, and the power so acquired will he
of little value to him.

EAT TO BE HEALTHY
DIET
rJlAN'S fleshy robes consists of sixteen elements as follows:
~SODIUM, POTASSIUM, CHLORINE, SULPHUR, MAN-
GANESE, IODINE, IRON, OXYGEN, NITROGEN,
CARBON, SILICON, FLUORINE, CALCIUM, HYDROGEN,
MAGNESIUM, and PHOSPHORUS.
If there is a lack of one or more of the above elements in the
body, low vitality will be the consequence. The system then be-
comes a fertile soil for the breeding of disease germs.
The cause of most disease is due to wrong diet or acid forming
foods. A few acid forming foods are as follows: Sugar, white
bread, all fried foods, all kinds of meats, potatoes, pies, pastry of
all kinds, pancakes, coffee, tea, bananas, candy and macaroni, etc.
Our bodies are composed of acids and alkalines. Before the
nerves, tissues and organs can function properly, these acids and
alkalines must be present in right proportions. If there is an
excess or insufficiency of either acids or alkalines, the normal
functions of the body will be affected.
An excess of acid forming foods have a tendency to stagnate
functions of tissues, thereby causing rheumatism, diabetes, Brights
disease, heart trouble, gas on the stomach, lumbago, etc.
It can then be readily understood that most disease is caused
by too much acid forming foods. The diet of the average indi-
vidual consists of coffee, tea, white bread, pies, puddings, meats,
potatoes and cakes--all of which are acid-forming foods.
By alkalizing the system most of our ailments can be overcome.
Alkaline foods are prunes, oranges, grapefruit, almonds, walnuts,
figs, celery, water-cress, spanish onions, black currents, black-
berries, grapes, strawberries, all kinds of vegetables and nuts.
When there are epidemics of diseases, it is important that we
fall back upon a heavy alkaline or basic diet foods containing
the metallic salts. These salts are of the utmost importance, as
germ life cannot exist where the metallic salts are in abundance.
Phosphorus and Sulphur are necessary for the proper function-
ing of brain and nerves. Oil is needed for brain, nerves, joints,
nervous hysteria and kindred ailments. Raw egg yolks, nuts, and
especially almonds and walnuts are also needed.
Potassium compounds are essential for the muscular system,
especially Potassium Carbonate, which is found largely in prunes,
black olives, bitter vegetables, green sour salads, olives, beech-
nuts, wheat, bran bread, barley, cherries, gooseberries, etc. These
foods stimulate all bodily functions, build bones and brain meta-
bolism. A large plate of raw salad should be eaten daily with a
dressing of lemon juice and olive or mazola oil. The problem
113
114 SECRETS OF INDIA
is to avoid acids as much as possible and keep the system from
becoming over acid.
Oxygen is of the utmost value to the system-no oxygen no life.
It is a well-known fact that elements have affinities and in order to
get the full value of oxygen, breathing alone is not sufficient. Po·
tassium and iron will attract oxygen to the blood and glandular
system. Silicon found in oats, barley, lentils, figs, spinach, red
cabbage, rye foods and the outer shell of grains, attracts oxygen
to the nerves and tissues. To avoid cancer and ulcers, avoid eat-
ing an excess of acid forming foods.
DIET AS A HEALING AGENT
BAD TEETH-Eat a liberal amount of cucumber.
CATARRH-Practice deep breathing and plenty of leaf lettuce
should be eaten daily.
SORE THROAT-Gargle with lukewarm water to which half
a lemon has been added.
COUGH-In half a glass of hot water, place one teaspoonful of
honey and drink slowly.
SLUGGISH LIVER-A cup of hot tea two hours before or after
meals.
ABCESS-Apply a warm flaxseed or hop poultice.
CONSTIPATION-For a period of ten days do not eat any
food at breakfast time. Instead, take the juice of as many oranges
as desired. Do not eat any food until the noon lunch. A pound
of grapes eaten daily is beneficial; also a teaspoonful of hot olive
oil taken daily or a teaspoonful of peyllaseed will give relief.
ECZEMA-Make a salve of one ounce each of sulphur, pitch and
vaseline and apply.
STIFF JOINTS-Sesame oil used externally for massaging.
ASTHMA-Four grains of asafetida and four grains of cam-
phor mixed with honey ought to form a paste, roll in bread
crumbs, and take one daily as a pill.
SESAME SEED-Boiled and taken as a tea increases and helps
to produce milk in nursing mothers.
TO NEUTRALIZE ACIDITY temporarily-Mustard seeds
crushed and taken with the juice of an orange.
CONGESTED LUNGS AND COLD-Four drops of cinnamon
oil taken in hot water.
WORMS IN CHILDREN-Juice from the leaf of pineapple
plant, half a teaspoonful daily.
SOUR STOMACH-Sour Kraut juice taken daily counteracts
a sour stomach.
GALLSTONES- Fasting and the juice of one lemon taken every
hour until relieved.

CAUSES OF GAS ON THE STOMACH
Should gas pains develop on your left side, it is because the
system is loaded with too much protein. If the pains are on the
right side there is too much starches. If the gas pains come on
the right side, to effect a cure you must eliminate starches from
your diet until relieved. If on the left side, then leave out pro-
teins and all fibrous food until relieved. However, if you eat a
well-balanced diet each day, and include at least one raw salad,
there is not much danger of having an excess of either starches or
proteins in your system. FOR RAISING THE METABOLISM
OF THE BODY-A hot bath followed by a cold sponge, or cold
sponging the different parts of the body raises the Metabolism.
PERNICIOUS ANEMIA-Apricots eaten daily increases the ac-
tivity of the spleen and have a much better curative value than
liver, which has been used successfully for curing pernicious an-
emia.
DIABETES-Boil watermelon seeds and drink a cup of the tea
two hours before or after meals.
. GOITRE-Grate or grind raw beets, squeeze out the juice and
take a teaspoonful daily.
PILES-Kerosene injected two or three times a day.
NERVOUSNESS-Take the juice of two large heads of lettuce
each day.
TO RESTORE GRAY HAIR-Mix four ounces of sesame, four
ounces of bay rum, one-half ounce of bergamont, one-half ounce
oil of orange flower, three ounces of oil of almond, shake well
and rub into the scalp.
HEARTBURN-A pinch of salt will stop it instantly.
CLEANING KIDNEYS-Coriander seeds or tops, drinking
as a tea.
SPIRITUAL SELF HEALING
Lie on your back on a couch or bed, relax all over, there must
not be tenseness of the muscles whatever. Center the attention
on the tips of the nostrils and while inbreathing and outbreathing
concentrate the mind on the breath as it enters and leaves the
nostrils. This will have a tendency to slow down the breath
until it becomes a mere whiff when inbreathing. You have now
1 attained a state of mental and physical calmness, as this stage
is reached endeavor to realize that you are expressing "DIVINE
PERFECTION."
Make the following affirmation and while doing so name the
affiicted organ, "I am now expressing a perfect organ of the Di-
vine, which is all perfect." Also this affirmation can be made:
"My organ (here you will name the affiicted organ) is a perfect
replica of the Divine."
116 SECRETS OF INDIA
If this is properly done, your objective consciousness is merged
into the consciousness of your higher Spiritual Self, which is per·
feet.
This exercise is based upon the knowledge that man is in es·
sense a replica of The Divine. "In mine Own Image have I
created Thee."-Bible. "By Me all this universe is pervaded. In
My unmanifested aspect, all things have root in Me, not I in
them. As the mighty air moving everywhere is rooted in ether,
so all being rests rooted in Me."
"As the Omnipresent ether is not affected by reason of its
subtlety, so seated everywhere in the body the Atma {Self) is not
affected. As one sun lights the world, so .the Lord of the Field
(KSHETRAJNANA) Illuminates the whole Field."
.J
CRYSTAL GAZING
Q'IRST the St~dent should purchase a Crystal, there are many
J_J, different sizes and grades of Crystals on the Market which
may be purchased from fifty cents up to a hundred dollars.
The author recommends for the average person a Crystal which
should be of clear glass, and about four inches in diameter.
The Crystal can either be held during the tests or placed on
a stand or pedestal.
Before starting the test or at the beginning of the sitting, the
first thing to be done by the Crystal Gazer, is to rub the palms of the
hands briskly for: about three minutes, pick up the Crystal with
the left hand and make several passes with the right hand over
and above the Crystal. This first movement will have a tendency
to magnetize it and bring results more quickly.
Gaze calmly into the Crystal, but do not strain the eyes. Do
not try to avoid winking your eyes-There is a difference between
"Gazing" and "Staring," remember. Some good authorities ad-
vise making funnels of the hands, and using them as you would a
pair of opera glasses.
FIRST SIGNS OF VISION
When you find the Crystal begins to look dull or cloudy, with
small pin-points of light glittering therein, like tiny stars, you
may know that you are commencing to obtain that for which you
seek-viz., crystalline vision. Therefore, persevere with confi·
dence. This condition may or may not, continue for several sit·
tings, the Crystal seeming at times to alternately appear and dis-
appear, as in a mist. By and by this hazy appearance, in its
turn, will give place quite suddenly to a blindness of the senses
to all else but a blue or bluish ocean of space, against which, as
if it were a background, the vision will be clearly apparent.
Of course, what you apparently see in the Crystal is really
transpiring in the open light. The development of telepathy or
mind reading is amazing. It manifests itself in everyday life and
reaches its climax in the attainment of the masters of wisdom on
the high places of the Earth. The wonderful manner in which this
intelligence is communicated or rather the speed with which news
of an important character travels is wonderful.
The favor which Crystal Gazing meets with at the hands of be-
ginners is due to the fact that it is the easiest method known by
which the Astral Vision may be awakened. With the majority
of people, the power may be awakened only by the aid of some
physical object which may act as a starting-point for the Astral
Tube, or as one writer has expressed it, "a convenient focus for the
Will-power." A number of objects may be so employed, but the
Crystal or Glass Ball is the best for the purpose because of certain
117
118 SECRETS OF INDIA
atomic and molecular arrangements which tend to promote the
manifestation of the psychic power and faculties. ·
Crystal Gazing, as a method for inducing Psychomatic vision,
has been quite common among all peoples, in all times. Not only
the Crystal but many other objects are similarly used.
In many cases, a number of trials are required before you will
be able to get good results. In others, at least some results are
obtained at the first trial. It is a good plan to try to bring into
vision something that you have already seen with the physical eyes
-some familiar object-try to have the scenes of your early
childhood appear in the Crystal or any other familiar scene.
An English authority recommends that beginners failing to get
direct results, then try to "visualize" something that they have al-
ready seen-something familiar, such as a chair, a ring, a face,
etc., and then turning to the Crystal endeavor to reproduce it there.
It is claimed that this practice will often gradually lead to actual
"seeing" in the Crystal.
The first signs of the actual "seeing" in the Crystal, comes in the
form of a "cloudiness," or "milky-mist" in the Crystal, which
slowly resolves itself into a form, or scene, which appears gradu-
ally like the precipitation of a photograph upon a sensitive plate
in the developing room. In some cases, the "misty" cloud deepens
into a black one, from which the pictures appear.
Before becoming discouraged, remember that most frequently
nothing will be seen on the first occasion, and possibly not for
several sittings; though some sitters, if strongly gifted with psychic
powers in a state of unconsciousness, and sometimes conscious de-
gree of unfoldment, may be fortunate enough to obtain good re-
sults at the first trial. If, therefore, nothing is perceived during
the first few attempts, do not despair or become impatient, or
imagine that you will never see anything. There is a royal road
to Crystal vision, but it is open only to those who will practice
Calmness, Patience and Perseverance.
The Crystal should not be used soon after taking a meal, and
care should be taken in matters of diet to partake only of digestible
foods, and outdoor exercise, with contentment of mind, or love of
simplicity in living, are great aids to success. Mental anxiety, or
ill-health, are not conducive to the desired end. The better your
health, the clearer your vision, although many people in indifferent
health do see, yet they have not the greater powers. You should
live as far as possible in the fresh air, take a reasonable amount
of exercise and try to hold the thought of health and purity ever
before you.
A Crystal should not be handled by anyone other than the own-
er, from the fact, that when handled by others, it becomes de-mag-
netized, as a Crystal when constantly used by one person becomes
highly magnetic, and has a tendency to hold the magnetism of
this person until again used. ..
CRYSTAL GAZING 119
SPIRIT SIGHT
The phase of Spirit Sight is easily produced and should he seen
at the end of a week of practice, if the conditions are fulfllled and
you have had absolute confidence in yourself. You must not
forget the necessity of mental purity, a person impregnated witll
love for humanity and free from jealousy and hatred or evil of an.y
kind is necessary, if you want the best results.
I have had repeated evidence from many Crystal Gazers in the
possession of this power. Sometimes the knowledge obtained was
given out through the person's body and at other times it was
expressed directly by the Crystal Gazer either in his own voice, or
by symbols.
Unless the Crystal vision is very clear you will find many
things half formed in the glass and they will come to your mind
quite as vivid as a picture since it is not the virtue of the glass,
but your own sight which you can read, or see in the astral light ol
those who consult you.
The astral light is a very important consideration since as soon
as you are able to perceive this about a person you can read.the
meanings in the pJay of its color as it surrounds every man, woman
and child. The astral light thrown off by people is composed of
tiny atoms of so minute a character that it is entirely imperceptible
to the naked eye, but is clearly visible to those who have success-
fully succeeded in so controlling themselves that they can obtain
the state of spirituality at will. This is what I refer to as clair-
v.
oyant sight. The light is of the nature of a cloud which enti're~y
surrounds the person sitting and it is through reading this either
knowingly or unconsciously that the Crystal Gazer is able to
deduce the events in the lives of those around him.
The meaning of astral light and the colors which surround all
human beings as well as animals is a subject that has long en·
gaded the attention of intelligent investigators. The attempt to
see the colors which envelope every person is one that a great
many people find hard to grasp. There is but one royal road
to it, however, that will give results. It is the road to faith and
belief.
ASTRAL COLORS
OR HOW TO READ THE CRYSTAL
The different colors shown in the astral light are ten in number
and they have a fixed meaning. They are seldom seen pure as in
the prism. The meanings are of great use to you ·no matter
whether the colors appear in the Crystal or in the high phases of
spirit sight.
Orange means material success and is very good. Green, joy,
pleasure and light heartedness. Yellow, a surprise, if cloudy, un-
pleasant news. Blue, intellectual capacity and a good brain. Violet,
120 SECRETS OF INDIA
spiritual, spirit sight possessed. White, is a good omen. Black
means trouble and danger, and is a bad omen. Crimson, love,
sympathy and goodwill. Red, is passionate, sensual and violent.
Purple means riches.
When the light or colors appear in the Crystal you can give them
the same meaning as when they appear around the head of the
individual, but remember that often faces, figures, symbols, etc.,
come into the Crystal surrounded by waves of clouds, then the
colors will indicate the condition of the person whose face ap·
pears in it and you must give your reading accordingly.
Pale violet signifies love, passion and great endurance. Green
shows a person will gain victory and success and a very cheerful
character, full of love and good purpose and ever ready to see
the bright side of everything. A dark sickly green signifies a de-
ceitful nature, a double-tongued person who you should place no
confidence in, shun them whatever you do, if you don't you will
regret it. Brown signifies greed, disappointment and dishonor.
These colors will appear clearly to you if your sight is de-
v:eloped, or will be observed in your Crystal. You will seldom see
them alone, they will nearly always appear with symbols, let-
ters or some indication or form and will give you the clear key
to their meaning. These different colors indicate the mental and
spiritual condition as well as the traits of character of the people
who consult you or who you are diagnosing for disease. You can
tell at once what condition your client is in as your sight grows
and you learn to interpret colors.
The gross and unorganized people will be surrounded by
darker shades of red, black, brown, blue, green, and mean, treach-
erous people will have clouds of brown around them. Those who
are deceitful and jealous will have clouds of a dirty yellow, or a
sickly green, while the hypocrite will be surrounded with a brown
bronze blue color. The bad tempered person will have much scar-
let. The passionate person clouds of red. It is thus the deceitful
and evil minded people will be made known to you alone.
Now in this way you can strike out the keynote of the persons
you are dealing with and find out the reasons for their actions,
their troubles and often the symbol vision which relates to their
future. White is a token of innocence, faith and purity. This is
seldom seen in ordinary people, but comes to those of especial
training who have learned the great lessons of life. Red, of a pale
shade signifies passion, love, creative power and a character full
of warmth and inventive genius, great vitality and true worth.
Scarlet signifies awful passion and a low degenerate nature.
Blood red means war, hatred and punishment. Scarlet and ·black
combined indicate a devilish outburst of passion, possibly murder,
very poor control over the will and reasoning powers. When black
rs prominent it shows afHiction, earthly thought and a mercenary
nature. Gray means mourning, trouble, sorrow and disappoint-
:.
•
CRYSTAL GAZING 121
ment. Pale blue shows an intellectual nature, one who is in an
advanced state of development and understands himself. The
deeper shades of blue indicate religion, but if there is a mixture
of brown and gray with it, it means selfishness and pious deceit,
causing a great deal of sorrow and bigotry in the nature of those
who show this color. Yellow appears to envious persons with
jealous dispositions, very unsatisfactory in their dealings, in-
constant, deceitful and liars. A bright pure golden yellow indi-
cates the highest order of intellect, intuition and spiritualism. An
orange yellow indicates a somewhat lower order of the above, but
a great deal of success in commercial matters. A deep violet blue
indicates high spiritual thought but is seldom seen. A clear bright
blue indicates a condition of religious excitement and where there
is much of it, it may cause a person to be unbearable to those whom
he comes in contact with. He neither waits time nor opportunity
to thrust his religious opinions on others. Where considerable
pale blue color is in evidence you get the man who is cold, but
scientific, free from passion, refined and apt to frequent places of
art, culture and refined music. Always avoid dark yellow, these
people are envious, unscrupulous and deceitful, bad for any busi-
ness dealing an4 bad associates. The man or woman who carries
the ;violet blue color about them has intense aspirations to live an
upright life. They never mix with anything degrading or mean.
They are trustworthy and truthful and good people to associate
with and do business with.
The influence of the varying shades of red thrown off by cer~
tain people are widely different. From the pure affection and
tender love of the rose color is the condition which creates happi-
ness wherever it falls, it is the opposite of the scarlet color and its
effect may be easily told. The person with much scarlet will bring
an element of discontent and dissention wherever he goes. His lot
will fall among thieves and envious people and he will frequent
places where mean conditions exist such as music halls, saloons, etc.
According to his station in life so will these places be of high or
low aspect, but all will bear the taint of vice and low characters
and the person must be judged accordingly. Blood red color
always attends soldiers, murderers, butchers, and all those whose
thought turn red with anger. It means a swift and terrible death
to them.
People with much gray, especially blue gray about them, bring
depressing influences to.bear upon all about them especially their
relatives, friends, neighbors and in all their affairs. They are
always cowardly, afraid, morbid and continually worrying oTer
something. They are always in grief or sorrow. It indicates
mourning and bereavement. You have for instance a client whose
color gives you a shade of red, blue or violet, with perhaps some
muddy yellow or green combined in it. Here you have a person
of great passion, but with a certai.n degree of intellect and desire
122 SECRETS OF INDIA
for spiritual things, but an underlying nature of deceit, selfishness
and jealousy which will keep him from any great advancement
in life, a weak character. Wam your client of thls if you think it
wise. Now there comes into your vision another face; surrounding
it you see clouds of red and black, flashes of brown and yellow,
you will see at once that it is necessary to warn your client of this
person who can be no friend and only a bad influence.
The influence of the black color is lowering and brings de-
pressing influences upon all about them. The influence upon the
person who creates it is very bad, it brings his life into chaos. It
keeps him on a low level, creates low impressions and conditions
which are difficult to overcome. Such people are always in trouble
and seem to attract evil and disaster.
You will always find that the pure colors rise highest in your
Crystal. The heavy colors always sink. You will now see from
this how to read the colors, but you should always balance one
against the other.

rT1IND Reading is divided by the authorities into two general
~ classes, viz., "Contact" Mind Reading and "Telepathic"
Mind Reading.
The first of these classes, "Contact" Mind Reading, is demon·
strated by physical contact between the Transmitter (or active
agent) and the Receiver (or passive agent) in order to afford an
easy channel for the passage of the vibrations, thought-waves,
nerve-currents, or magnetism of the Transmitter (according to the
several theories favored by scientists) . The second class, "Tele-
pathic" Mind Reading, is demonstrated by the transferral of the
"waves," "vibrations," "currents," or "magnetism" of the Trans·
mitter to the Receiver over the ether through space (often for thou-
sands of miles) without the more convenient "wires" of the nerves
of the two agents.
You will readily see that two classes of phenomena closely re·
semble the two classes of telegraphic phenomena, i.e., the
"wire" system and the "wireless" system. There is a striking
analogy between electric phenomena and mental force phenomena
all the way through the subject, and this subject of Mind Reading
is simply one of the many forms of the resemblance.
We shall begin by giving you instructions in the first form-
Contact Mind Reading, as it is the simplest and most easy of ac·
complishment and demonstration. And besides, the best Tele-
pathists have been trained by means of the practice of Contact
Mind Reading at the start. One leads to the other, just as the ordi-
nary wire telegraph naturally led to the "wireless" system, which
is even now but in its infancy.
At this point we wish to point out to you a most grievous error,
and unjust judgment, that certain so-called scientists and investi·
gators have fallen into regarding this matter of Contact Mind
Reading. In order to give you a clearer idea of the nature of this
error, we must call your attention to the fact that Contact Mind
Reading has been given much publicity through the advertise·
ments and performances of several celebrated public performers,
and their lesser-light imitators.
These performers, like many others, have sought to give an at·
tractive public entertainment rather than a scientific demonstra-
tion, and some of them have found it much easier to "fake" some
of the demonstrations rather than to perform them according to
scientific principles. And the careful investigators soon discovered
that in certain cases there was no Mind Reading at all, but only a
clever imitation which was styled "Muscle Reading." In other
words, instead of the performer receiving his mental impressions
from the mind of the Transmitter, over the nervous system of other
persons, he would push up against him, and by a clever system of
pushing, pulling, leading, and leaning would detect the muscular
123
124 SECRETS OF INDIA
movements of the Transmitter, and by careful practice would learn
to interpret these movements so as to get an indication of the loca·
tion of the hidden objects and practically be led or pushed toward
the spot. But even in these cases, the performer would of necessity
have to employ more or less genuine Contact Mind Reading to
finish the feats. The only advantage the performer gained by re-
sorting to these unfair methods was that it was less fatiguing to his
mind and enabled him to "fake" through the performance with
less mental wear and tear.
The investigators, easily discovering the above mentioned "fak-
ing" performances, came to the conclusion that the whole thing
was a "fake" and could be explained by the "muscle reading"
theory entirely. And so the news was spread broadcast, and you
will find a number of books written explaining Contact Mind Read-
ing on this hypothesis. Of course some of the public may prefer
to accept this erroneous theory, but we wish to say here positively
that if any person will honestly investigate for himself, and will
learn to make the demonstrations personally, he or she will soon
djscover that "muscle reading" has nothing to do with the genuine
phenomena. The ptoof of the thing is in the doing of it,'and you
may learn the truth for yourself if you will but try the feats and
demonstrations, herein given, just as we teach them. The result
of such practice will cause you to feel with us the indignation
arising from the attempts to belittle a noble scientific principle,
and practice, by an explanation arising from the witnessing of
"fake" imitations of the real thing.
The truth is that the muscles have nothing to do with the pas-
sage of the mental currents or waves from the Transmitter to the
Receiver any more than they have to do with the transmission of
nervous sensations from body to brain, or the motor impulses
from brain to body. When you wish to close your hand you send
a nervous current from your brain to the muscles controlling your
hand. The current travels along the nervous system, and is by it
distributed over the muscles causing them to contract. A current
from a galvanic battery will cause the muscles to act in the same
way. But the muscle is the machinery affected and set into motion,
and the nerves are the delicate telegraphic wires leading to the
parts.
And so it is with the transmission of the mental waves and cur·
rents. The brain of the Transmitter, aroused by his active Will,
sends a powerful current or wave through his nervous system.
When it reaches the extremity of his fingers it leaps over the tiny
space separating his nerves from the nerves of the Receiver, and
enters the nervous system of the latter, and influences his actions.
The Receiver being in a passive condition, and his brain sending
practically no impulses over his nerves, he is in a receptive condi-
tion to the imparted nervous current, which acts upon him some-
thing like an impulse from his own brain, only weaker. That is
•
MIND READING 125
the whole secret of Contact Mind Reading. It is "Nerve Reading"
if you like, but certainly not Muscle Reading.
The tips of the fingers of a person of fine sensibilities, and deli-
cate touch, are known by anatomists to be filled with masses of
nerve-matter similar to that forming parts of the brain. In fact they
are tiny finger-brains, and they will send out, convey, and receive
delicate impulses from one mind to another. Those of you who have
experienced the peculiar touch of some persons of this kind, can
bear witness to the fact that a subtle "magnetism" or current passed
from them to you. This is a fact well known to investigators of
psychic phenomena, and such people laugh at the crude "muscle
reading" theories, for they have disproved them repeatedly in
actual careful experiments. And you may do the same, if you will
practice the demonstrations given in this book. The fact that the
developed Contact Mind Reader usually walks ahead of his Trans-
mitter, instead of being led by him; and that he usually allows the
latter's arm to hang limp, instead of muscularly contracted, is an-
other proof of the absurdity of the theory above mentioned. Be-
sides this, wires may be used between the two persons, or even a
third person may be placed between them. But, as we have sai(J,
after all the best and only real test is to try the experiments yourself
and learn that "muscle reading" has nothing to do with the real
phenomena.
The experimenter will soon find that when he gets into the work
and is engaged in a search for a hidden object, by means of Mind
Reading, he will forget all about the Transmitter. He will almost
forget where he is, and will feel himself floating and gliding over
the floor and scarcely touching it with his toes. He will find him-
self drawn or impelled irresistibly toward the hidden object, as if
by some outside energy or fine force. He will feel the hidden ob-
ject drawing him like a magnet, and attracting him to the spot. He
will forget his audience, and everything else, in his desire to reach
the Centre of Attraction. These experiences cannot well be ex-
plained in print, but the investigator will soon learn to know them
for himself, and he will be amazed and filled with wonder at the
strange psychical phenomena in which he is taking a principal part.
And, then, and then only will he be able to intelligently reject the
absurd and unjust theories of "muscle reading," and to see the
crudeness of the attempted explanation. He will see that the fool-
ish theory is as far out of the way as the ignorant person's idea
that the telegraph messages are sent by the wires being "pulled"
or "jerked," instead of being but channels for the passage of the
electric fluid, or magnetic waves.
Many of our readers have witnessed the public performances of
the several well-known Contact Mind Readers who have visited
the leading cities of this country and other lands. Of course, the
average public performer soon discovers that the average patron
of his performance attends principally to be amused, and ent'er-
126 SECRETS OF INDIA
tained, rather than to be instructed. And he is apt to gradually add
sensational features to the performance, for the purpose of thrill-
ing and mystifying the audience, knowing that by so doing he will
better pl~ase his patrons that if he were to give them a strictly sci-
entific demonstration of the science of Contact Mind Reading as
produced in the psychological laboratories of the great investiga-
tors of the subject. Some of these public performers have even
gone so far as to add "fake" features to their performance, employ·
ing confederates, and in other ways introducing unscientific meth-
ods in order to intensify the interest and satisfaction of their audi-
ences.
But notwithstanding this fact, the average public Mind Reader,
in spite of his sensational additions, generally gives his audience
enough of "the real thing" to render his performance of sufficient
scientific interest to make it worthy of attendance by the earnest
student of the subject. And we believe that the time is approaching
when a strictly scientific performance will prove of sufficient in-
terest to the public to render it worth while for a new class of en-
tertainers and lecturers to arise and take the field, instructing the
public regarding their great subject and illustrating their theories
by striking experiments along scientific lines. And we think that
this little book will do its part in the direction of educating the
public mind to appreciate such an entertainment, as well as serv-
ing to educate future entertainers for their life work.
However, here we shall treat the subject as if a parlor demonstra-
tion was all that is desired, and our instructions and directions shall
he chiefly toward that end, although we wish to say that any man or
woman who will carefully study these instructions and directions,
and who will carefully practice the feats and exercises, will be
able to gradually develop sufficient ability and skill to give a suc-
cessful public performance, and perhaps reap a goodly share of
fame and financial reward. The principles of the parlor demon-
stration, and the public performance are the same. These same
instructions and directions have been studied and applied by some
of the best performers now before the public, illustrating the won·
ders of Contact Mind Reading. So that if any of the students of
this work have ambitions in the direction of public performance,
·they will find herein the methods calculated to develop them into a
successful public entertainer and demonstrator.
Anyone may develop himself, or herself, into a good Contact
Mind Reader by practice, and perseverance. As in everything else
in life, some will succeed better than others; and some will find
the work easier than do others, but all may develop quite a re-
spectable degree of proficiency in a short time. A little careful, con-
scientious practice and experiment will accomplish wonders.
Mind Reading feats depend upon the degree of Will and Con·
centration on the part of the Transmitter, and upon the degree of
Receptivity and Passivity upon the part of the Receiver. We are
..

MIND READING 127
taking it for granted that the student will wish to act as a Re-
ceiver (or Performer of the feat of Mind Reading) rather than
as the Transmitter (or person called upon to have his mind read).
And so we shall address him as such, with this understanding. But
we shall also give herein full directions for the transmitter, as well,
in order to give the student the methods necessary to act in either
capacity, and to also enable him to instruct the Transmitter in
his work. The Receiver should understand the duties of the Trans-
mitter, in order that the best possible results be obtained, and the
proper harmony and rapport conditions may be established.
DEVELOPMENT EXERCISES
The student should practice privately with the assistance of a
few friends, before he ventures before a parlor audience, for by so
doing he overcomes the first lack of confidence in himself, and the
awkwardness natural to the beginner along any new line of work.
By careful and repeated practice he gains confidence in himself
by reason of his growing success in his experiments, and besides
wears off the "rough edges" of his actions, etc., so that when he
finally appears before an audience he will feel perfectly self-pos·
sessed and at ease, and thus be able to devote his entire attention
to his work, without annoying self-consciousness and awkwardness.
Begin the Development Exercises by selecting one or more
friends who are in sympathy with you, and who are interested in
the subject. Do not have any unsympathetic or uncongenial per·
sons around when you are practicing, for such people tend to dis·
tract your attention from your work, and really exert a detrimental
effect upon the preliminary work. Select one of your friends as
the Transmitter and take the part of the Receiver yourself.
In beginning a public demonstration, it will be well for you to
give a short preliminary talk to the audience, somewhat along the
following lines:
OPENING TALK
"Ladies and Gentlemen, with your assistance I shall endeavor
to give you a demonstration of practical Mind Reading, beginning
with some simple feats, and then proceeding gradually to more
complicated demonstrations. In these demonstrations, I must
have your co-operation, for the success of the experiments depends
as much upon you as upon myself. In the first place, I must ask
that you refrain from conversation, laughter, etc., while I am
demonstrating, for these things distract the mind of the Transmitter
and prevent him from concentrating his Mind and Will upon mine;
and also prevent me from maintaining that Passive Mental State
which is essential to the success of the experiments. I trust that
you will help me in this way. I also ask that during the experi-
ments, you will all concentrate your Mind and Will upon me, and
help me in the work. In order to obtain the best results all Mind
128 SECRETS OF INDIA
Readers prefer that their audiences concentrate their Wills upon
the work, with the purpose of mentally willing that the demon·
stratar be successful. In fact the success of the experiments de-
pend very materially upon the Willing exerted by the audience. If
you Will in my favor, I shall be thankful; if you Will that I shall
fail, I shall feel the effect. Therefore, kindly give me your aid. I
ask you to blindfold me and take such other means to prevent un-
fair methods and practices, as your judgment may dictate. I am
now ready to proceed with the tests."
CHOOSING THE TRANSMITTER
Then have the audience select a committee to blindfold you and
remain outside of the room with you, while the remainder of the
audience select the object that you are to find, etc. When you re-
turn to the room, select someone to act as Transmitter. If pos-
sible get someone with whom you have previously practiced, and
establish rapport conditions. This will aid you very materially, of
course. If this is not possible, select someone of the audience that
is in harmony with you, and who will have a strong enough will to
give you the vibrations. Sometimes women are very good at this
work, as they get very much in earnest when interested, and there-
fore Will intently. If your first Transmitter is not satisfactory, test
another, and so on until you get a good one. You may change
Transmitters during the evening, if you prefer; in fact this is a
good plan, if you are an adept, for it shows the audience that there
is no collusion.
INSTRUCTING THE TRANSMITTER
You should instruct the Transmitter, along the lines indicated
in a previous chapter, i.e., that he must hold the thought of direction,
fix his eyes on the chosen spot and then concentrate his will upon it,
and that your success will depend materially upon his ability to
concentrate his Mind and Will upon the task. You should explain
to him that you receive your impulses through his thought-waves
or vibrations, and that the stronger these are, the better you will
succeed. Make this plain to him. When the Transmitter fails to
concentrate his Will, you will know it at once, and should call his
attention to it, saying "Concentrate, concentrate now-harder-use
your Will," or words to that effect. You should impress upon the
Transmitter that it is the strength of his Will that produces the men·
tal vibrations that give you the impressions.
BEGINNING THE TEST
Then, take the hand of the Transmitter, in the manner already
described in previous lesson, placing it to your forehead, or else
holding it up high in front of you. Then begin a wavering motion,
or direction, preferably describing a circle, slowly. In this mean-
ingless wavering motion remain perfectly passive awaiting impres·
j
.
I
,,
.. MIND READING 129
sions. Soon you will begin to feel a mental resistance to certain
directions, and a mental willingness that you move in another di-
rection. Then move along the line of the least mental resistance.
In some cases you will receive a strong mental urge, pull, or push,
in the direction of the selected spot. Here is where your practice
comes in, for in your practice experiments you have acquired the
art of recognizing these impressions as they come to you, in their
different forms, and so are prepared to yield to them and move
accordingly. It is impossible to describe in writing just how these
impressions come, and feel like, for actual experience is neces·
sary before you will know just what is meant. But once you have
accustomed yourself to receive and recognize the impressions, the
rest is all a matter of practice and development.
And now for the demonstrations themselves. You should begin
with the simplest feats, and then work up gradually to the more
complicated and difficult ones. This plan will build up your own
powers, and will develop the Transmitter's. We herewith give a
number of interesting feats and demonstrations, explaining the
details of each. 0£ course, the general directions .we have given
regarding the receiving of impressions, etc., will apply to all of
these feats, for the principle underlying them all is the same, pre-
cisely.
FINDING A LocATION
DEMONSTRATION I. Begin by having the audience select a
part in the room, which may be easily reached by r.ou. Then pro-
ceed as directed, until you feel that you have reached the right place
or location.
FINDING A PERSON
DEMONSTRATION II. Have the audience select a p~rson, one
of their number. Find the general location of the person. Then
standing still, reach out your right hand, and begin "feeling about."
You will find that as your hand moves away from the right person
you will feel a drawing back impression, whereas when you reach
toward the person you will receive an urging forward impression.
A little practice will soon enable you to distinguish these mental
impressions. Then place your hand on the person who seems to
be the centre of the impressions. If this is the wrong person, you
will receive a mental impression of "Wrong"; in which case you
must start up the moving your hand to and fro, and around, until you
feel the urge impression, when you should place your hand on the
person immediately in front of you. When you reach the right per-
son, you will receive an unmistakable impression and mental mes-
. sage of "All Right," followed by a lessening of the Will tension,
d you will know that you h:ive succ:eded. You s~ould practice
;;•in private before attemptmg public demonstration.
/ 130 SECRETS OF INDIA
FINDING A SMALL OBJECT
DEMONSTRATION III. Have the audience select some small
object in plain sight in the room. Then find it in the manner de·
scribed of above in the case of the selected person. The rule is
identically the same. But there are some other details to be ob·
served, in the matte~ of "up or down," for the object may be higher
than your shoulder or lower, in which case you will have to either
reach up or down. In this reaching up or down, follow the same
general rule as given. When you reach the right location, you will
feel an impression of "not yet finished" from the mind of the
Transmitter. Then reach up slowly. If this is right you will re-
ceive a corresponding impression, and may go on to centre the
object. But if it is not right, you will receive a mental urge down-
ward, which you should follow. The rule always is to follow the
line of the least mental resistance. You will always receive the
resistance when you are not succeeding, and will always receive the
lack of resistance when you are succeeding. Learn to focus these
impressions until they centre positively and constantly on the
same spot-then you have succeeded, for there will be your object
right under your hand.
FINDING A BooK
DEMONSTRATION IV. Have the audience select a book on
the shelves of a book case, and then find it in the manner just re-
lated. The two feats are precisely the same, although the latter
will appear more startling to the observer.
T HE FLORAL TRIBUTE
DEMONSTRATION V. This test is known as "The Floral
Tribute." It is performed by having a bouquet of flowers on the
table. Then select somP. young man in the audience, and let him
pick out some young woman in the audience whom he wishes to
have the flowers. You must retire from the room, of course, while
he selects the young lady and mentions her name and position to
the audience. Then returning to the room, pick up the bouquet,
and taking the hand of your Transmitter, find the young lady and
present her with the flowers. Of course this feat is merely a fancy
rendition of the simple feat of finding the person thought of, and
is performed in the same way. (Study the directions for Demon-
stration II, and apply in the present case, with appropriate vari-
ations.)
THE REUNITED COUPLE
DEMONSTRATION VI. This test is known as "The Reunited
Couple." It is performed by having the audience select two per-
sons, a young man and a young woman, and stand them up ;
front of the room, like a couple about to be married. Then tl.

- uld have a third person, a man, selected and stood before them
the p~rson who will tie the knot. The three persons should then
ake their seats, and when you enter the room and take the hand
f your Transmitter, you must first find "the Parson"· then "the
rro_o~;" and ~he~ "the. Bride," an~ arrange them in their proper
os1tions. This is a highly effective test, and invariably brings
•arty applause, and the hunt affords much merriment to the audi-
~ce. But, as you will see readily, it is but a variation of Demon-
tration II.
THE HIDDEN JEWELRY
.~EMONSTRATION VII. Have the audience select some small
~cle, like a scarf-pin, ring, etc., and hide it on the person of some
ne in the audience. Then you are to find it. This demonstration
imbines the features of Demonstration II, and Demonstration III,
at is you have first to find the person, as described in Demonstra-
on II, and then the object which is practically a variation of
emonstration III, Study the details of Demonstration III, and
·'lctice the present demonstration in private before trying it in
blic.
THE DISCOVERED COURSE
DEMONSTRATION VIII. Have a member of the audience
'llk around the room, following a prescribed course selected by
..: audience. Have your Transmitter memorize the course ac-
rately, and then you must walk over the same course when you
r..urn to the room. This is effective, but is merely a variation of
~ "Finding the Corner" demonstration.
REPLACING THE PIN
1
DEMONSTRATION IX. This is called "Replacing the Pin,"
id is very effective when properly performed. Have a member of
~ audience take a pin and insert it in the wall in a spot plainly
ible to the audience, not too high up, however- about on the
1 of your shoulder is best. Then have him withdraw the pin
:_ hide it somewhere in the room. Then when you return to the
m, and take the Transmitter's hand, you should first find the
(in the manner heretofore described) and then find the place
re it had been stuck; then circling your hand around in nar-
1g circles until you feel the proper impression push the pin
in the spot in which it formerly was driven. This final effort

'lctice may be easily performed.

must be remembered lD this feat, and that is that the T

hold the hat so that it can he seen by the audience, requesting the
owner to rise in his seat so as to indicate his whereabouts-your
back being turned to the audience while this is being done in order
to avoid suspicion of your "peeping," etc.
THE LADY AND THE RING
DEMONSTRATION XIV. This feat is performed by having a
lady in the audience loan the Transmitter her ring. When you re·
turn to the room, you find the lady and replace the ring upon the
finger from which she took it. The Transmitter must remember
the lady, and the particular finger, of course-the rest is simply a
combination of the "finding the person" and "finding the spot"
feats. It is very effective, is neatly performed.
GENERAL ADVICE
I. We have given you a great variety of Demonstrations or
Feats, but you must not attempt to produce all of them at an eve-
ning's entertainment. It will take some time to perform a few of
them effectively, and impressively, and you should avoid any at·
tempt to hurry through the feats. Nor should you spoil your
good impression by cheapening the demonstrations in the direc-
tion of performing too many at one sitting.
II. Neither should you tire or fatigue yourself by too many
feats. When your mind or body are tired, you do yourself an
injury to perform these demonstrations, and besides, you cannot
obtain the best results while fatigued. You should rest a little
while after each feat, before attempting another one.
III. When the entertainment, or exercises are over, you should
take a few strong deep breaths, swing your arm around a little to
promote the circulation, and relieve the nervous tension. You
may feel a little "dazed" at first after performing a few feats, hut
will soon learn to throw off the passive condition, and engage in
the laughing conversation that will follow the entertainment. Do
not take yourself too seriously and remember that laughter and a
little boyish or girlish spirits is a wonderful tonic.
IV. Do not become impatient if you do not progress as rapidly
as you would desire. You are practically developing a sixth sense,
and are like a baby learning to walk-it takes time, but practice
will surely bring you success. Take things calmly. The feats that
will be possible for you to perform, even from the start will be
wonderful enough, without any necessity for your complaining
about your slowness in learning to perform the more complicated
ones.
ABOUT TRANSMITTERS
I. If your Transmitter does not do his work properly, and you
feel that he is not Concentrating properly, or using his Will effec·
tively, do not hesitate to change him. You need not offend him,
134 SECRETS OF INDIA
for you may simply say the rapport conditions are not fully de·
veloped between you, and that these things sometimes happen, etc.
Your new Transmitter will feel anxious to do better than his prede·
cessor, and will be most likely to Concentrate and Will to the best
of his ability.
II. The Transmitter should be in earnest, and no levity or trif·
ling should be permitted. If you have the selection, pick out some
earnest person, and avoid the trifling, feather-brained class.
III. If your Transmitter does not seem to be Concentrating
properly, yo_
u should speak to him firmly, but kindly, about it.
Say to him: "Please concentrate your Mind, and Will earnestly-
fix your mind on the right Spot-make a determined Mental Effort
that I move in the right direction-it is your Mind and Will that
gives me the impression, remember-it all depends upon you," etc.
This will often have the effect of bracing him up to renewed men·
tal activity, and you will notice the improvement at once.
A WORD OF WARNING
Beginning your entertainment, caution the audience about plac·
ing the hidden objects in places that you cannot conveniently
touch-such as high up on the wall; under the strings of a piano,
etc. Tell them that you can find the article anywhere, but it must
be placed so that you can get at it with only ordinary care and
work. Some "Smart Alicks" may try to play pranks on you in
this way, but discourage same vigorously at the start, informing
the audience tqat this is a scientific test and not a circus. And, re·
member this, tell them that the article must never be hidden about
the Transmitter, for the reason that he is seldom able to think as
intensely about his own location as about some place away from
him. These are the only restrictions that you need make. Caution
the Transmitter to guide you away from obstacles over which you
might stumble, or which you might overturn. Tell him that you
place yourself in his hands for protection, and then endeavor to
think no more about the matter, for such thought tends to distract
your passivity.
The above feats or demonstrations are all performed along the
same general lines as indicated a little further back, and all are
capable of being accomplished by anyone of ordinary intelligence,
with a little study, care and practice. Practice makes perfect, in
Mind Reading as in everything else, remember, so keep at it until
you have worn off the rough edges, and have polished up the de-
tails of the work. You may vary, improve, add to, the above
feats, and may also insert many new ones for yourself as you pro·
ceed with your work. Use your inventive faculties.
THE WIRE CONTACT
A sensational and effective method of performing some of the
simpler feats is performed by some public performers, and consists
r
I
)
MIND READING 135
in having a piece of thick wire, about one foot in length grasped b_y
the Receiver's left hand, and by the Transmitter's right hand, in-
stead of the ordinary contact. A little practice will surprise you
in the facility in which the impressions are transferred over the
wire from the Transmitter to the Receiver. The methods of oper-
ation in this case are identical with those employed in the ordinaIT
methods. A wooden "ruler" may be substituted for the wire. Some
performers succeed even with a long walking-cane.
THIRD PERSON INTERPOSED
Another variation is that in which a third person is interposed
between the Transmitter and Receiver. Practice along these lines
will enable the skilled Mind Reader to receive the impressions as
usual, notwithstanding the interposition of the third person. DD
not attempt to try these variations until you have thoroughly mas·
tered the ordinary methods.
(The student is here advised to turn to the conclusion of Lesson
VI, of this book, and acquaint himself with the "Simpler Method"
there described. It may help him in this phase of his work.)
We shall now pass on to the consideration of some of the more
complicated or difficult feats of Contact Mind Reading.
DIFFICULT DEMONSTRATIONS
We shall now direct your attention to a class of demonstrations
of a rather more complicated order than those related in the last
chapter. But even these difficult feats may be rendered compara-
tively easy of accomplishment by careful practice, and development
of receptivity.
PRELIMINARIES
In these experiments or demonstrations the Transmitter stands
by your left side, you grasping the fingers of his right hand in your
left hand, and holding as in the case of the former experiment~
i.e., either with his hand pressed against your head, or else held
out and up, as before described. You receive the impressions in
the same way. The following demonstrations may be performed
after a little private practice, so as to be shown at a public pel'-
formance almost as easily as the simpler feats heretofore described.
DISCOVERING THE CARD
DEMONSTRATION I. Spread a number of cards on the table.
Then retiring from the room, have the audience select one card of
the number, which the Transmitter must be sure to remember dis-
tinctly-that is the Transmitter should remember just where the
card is, the position being the important feature, rather than the
name of the card. Then taking the Transmitter's hand as above
described, you should move your right hand to-and-fro over the
table, moving it backward and forward, and in circles. You will
136 SECRETS OF INDIA
soon find that this feat closely resembles the one of the last chap-
ter in which you find small objects; the pin hole, etc. You will
soon find that the impressions tend to centre over a certain spot on
the table. Begin to lessen your circles and hand movements until
you gradually centre over this spot. Then slowly lower your fingers
until you touch the card resting on the said spot, when you will be
Su.re that you are right, when you must pick up the card and exhibit
it to the audience. The same indications mentioned in the feats of
the last chapter will be felt by you. You will feel the "No, no!"
impression when you are wrong, and the "That's right" impression
when you are moving in the right direction, until at last you will
distinctly feel the relaxation of the mental urge, which you will
have learned to translate into "Right you are!" when you finally
touch the right card. This feat is really no more difficult than the
one in which the small object is.found, and we have included it in
the list of "Difficult Demonstrations" simply because it is prac-
'1cally a "connecting link" between the two classes of demonstra-
tion, as you will see as we proceed.
THE CHECKER MovE
DEMONSTRATION II. This is akin to the last experiment.
Have a checker board arranged by some of the audience who
understands the game. Then let some one decide on the next
move. Be sure that the Transmitter thoroughly understands the
pi'ece to be moved, as well as the place to where it is
to be moved. Then, proceeding as above indicated, first find
the piece to be moved, and then move it to the proper place. This
feat consists of two parts, you will notice. The finding of the piece
is like the finding of the card. Then with the piece grasped be-
tween your thumb and forefinger, make a small circular and back-
ward and forward movement, until you feel the mental impression
of "There!" when you will place your piece directly on the spot.
This may ·seem difficult, and appears so to the audience, but you
will find by a little private practice that it is really as easily per-
formed as some of the simpler tests.
THE G AME OF CARDS
DEMONSTRATION III. Similar to the above is the feat known
as the "Game of Cards." Two players sit opposite each other at a
table, having dealt themselves two hands of euchre. Have the
Transmitter lead you behind first player, and standing there have
the player silently point out the card he wishes to lead, to the
Transmitter. The Transmitter then should concentrate his mind
on the card, and you will find it in the usual manner, and having
found it will play it on the table. Then leading you around to the
other player, the Transmitter repeats the process, and you find and
play the card. Then back to the first play, and repeat. Then al-
terna_
te between the players, in the same manner, until you have
.,
MIND READING 137
played out the game. This may be improved upon by the Trans-
mitter thinking of which player has won the trick, when you will
push the cards over to the winner, having discovered the direction
in the usual manner. This feat is very effective indeed when prop-
erly performed.
THE MAPPED-OUT TRIP
DEMONSTRATION IV. Have a map laid open on the table,
and have the audience decide upon a trip between two points,
either by rail or by water. Then returning to the room, stand as
above described, and with your forefinger find the place from which
the trip starts. Then move slowly along the selected course in the
same manner in which the checker-game was played, passing along
the chosen route until the end is reached. These feats are all really
variations of the one principle.
THE pACK OF CARDS
DEMONSTRATION V. This is a very effective feat, and re-
quires some little skill and practice, but there is no reason why
any careful, patient, and persistent student should not be able to
master it. It consists in the audience selecting any given card from
the pack, and then replacing it with the others, being sure that the
Transmitter is familiar with the card chosen, and knows enough
about cards to recognize it when he sees it again. Then the pack of
cards should be placed on the table, face up. Returning to the
room, you take the Transmitter's hand as usual, and with your
right hand pick off the cards from the pack, slowly and one by one.
As you pick up each card, slowly weigh it in your hand, so to speak,
and then place it aside if you receive no "stop" orders from the
mind of the Transmitter. Having previously practiced this feat
in private you will have learned that peculiar "heavier" sensa-
tion that comes to you when you lift the right card from the pack, so
that when you finally reach it you will know. We cannot describe
just what this sensation will feel like-you must learn it by actually
experiencing it in private practice. We advise you to diligently
practice this feat in private for it is wonderfully effective. You
will find that after a bit of practice you will be able to get the
"heavy" feeling when you lift up and "weigh" the right card. You
should perform this feat slowly, and carefully, shaking your head,
"No" just before you discard a card. If by the lack of concentra-
tion of the Transmitter, you fail to feel the "heavy" feeling when
you pick up the right card, the shake of the head will be apt to
arouse him to exert his Will more actively, and you will receive
the "hold on" impulse immediately. Do not be in too much of a
hurry to discard, but make several feints at it before finally letting
go. This feat may be improved by having the audience select a
"poker-hand,'' such as a "flush,'' a "straight,'' "three-of-a-kind;" a
"full-house," etc., etc., and having you find the hand one card at a
138 SECRETS OF INDIA
time. This latter is a fine effect, and always brings down the house.
But be sure that your Transmitter really knows and remembers
the cards, else the feat will fail, of course. He must remember each
card, and recognize it when it appears face up on the pack before
you, as you proceed with the discarding. Never attempt this feat
in public without previous careful, private practice, for it requires
the most delicate perception and skill. If you find that you cannot
master it to your satisfaction, after sufficient practice, you may try
it by the "Simpler Method" given at the conclusion of this Lesson.
THE CHOSEN WORD IN THE BooK
DEMONSTRATION VI. Like the last feat, this is a complex
and difficult one, but one that always arouses enthusiasm in an
audience when well performed. It will repay you for the private
practice that you will have to employ upon it, before you produce
it in public. The feat consists of the audience selecting a book from
a pile, or a book-shelf, or book-case, etc.-then a given page is
chosen-then a line of printed matter on that page--and then a
word in that line. It is well to have the Transmitter ~raw a pencil
circle around the chosen word, so that he may be sure to remember
it later. The book is then replaced on the shelf. Then returning
to the room, you first find the book, by the methods already given
in previous feats; then laying it flat on the table you should begin
to slowly and deliberately pick each leaf up separately. This
part of the feat is almost identical with the last one, in which you
picked up the cards from the pack. When you get the proper im-
pression, you should announce that you have found the leaf. If
satisfied that you are right, ascertain upon which side of the leaf
the chosen page is. This can be done by pressing the leaf to the
right or left, in succession, until you get the right impression as
to which way to press it down. Then having thus found the page,
pass your finger slowly down and back over the page several times,
until you get the impression of a centre. This centre will be the
chosen line. Then by passing the finger slowly along the line,
you will discover the Word when you reach it. This
is a "ticklish" feat, but it may be mastered by practice-in fact
some people have found it almost as simple as some of the easier
feats, while others require careful practice with it. Do not be dis-
couraged i£ you do not succeed at first trial, even in public, but try
again, and after a bit you will seem to "get the knack" all at once,
and thereafter will have hut little trouble in making the demon-
stration. l£ you find that you do not meet with the desired degree
of success in this feat, try it by the "Simpler Method" given at the
last of this part of the book. But do not give it up without the
proper practice. l£ you have carefully performed the previous
feats, you should have so developed yourself by this time that
you should have no special difficulty in this feat.
MIND READING 139
BLACKBOARD DEMONSTRATIONS
The following feats may he performed either upon a large black-
board hanging from the wall, or upon a large sheet of card-hoard,
or stiff paper, spread upon the table. If the blackboard is used,
you should stand before it, the Transmitter standing in the usual
position. If the table is used, you should stand before it, the Trans-
mitter in his usual place.
DRAWING THE CHOSEN FIGURE
DEMONSTRATION VII. Have the audience select a number,
and think intently of it. ·Impress upon the Transmitter that he is
to think of the Shape of the figure instead of merely remembering
its nave. For instance if the figure "8" is thought of, the Trans-
mitter should think of the Shape of the figure, and not the word
"eight." Then begin to circle your hand around over the black-
board just as you did when finding the place of the "beginning of
the trip" of the demonstration mentioned a few minutes ago. Then
bring your pencil or chalk to a starting point, which you will soon
perceive. Then hold your fingers pressing lightly forward, and
impart to your hand a trembling vibratory motion as if in hesi-
tation regarding the next movement, saying at the same time to
your Transmitter: "Will Hard now-Will the Direction to me,"
and you will soon begin to get an impression of "Right," or "Left,"
or "Down," as the case may he, which you should follow slowly.
Be slow about it, for if the impression is not right you will soon he
checked up. Fence around a little until you begin to get the im-
pression clearly. You will find that the principal trouble is at
the start, for once you are started on the right track, your Trans-
mitter's Will will he freely employed, and he will pour the im-
pression into you. Let him feel that it is his Will that is really
doing the work, and he will exert it freely. Once started, these
drawing feats are easily performed, the trouble being with the
start. You should practice this feat frequently in private before
attempting it in a public demonstration. It is very effective.
THE LADY'S AGE
DEMONSTRATION VIII. This is a variation of the above feat.
A lady in the audience is asked to whisper her age in the ear of the
Transmitter, and you are to draw it on the hoard or paper. The
feat is performed precisely in the manner described above, the
Transmitter being cautioned to think of hut one figure at a time
during the drawing.
THE BANK NOTE TEST
DEMONSTRATION IX. Akin to the last two feats, is the read-
ing of the number of a hank-note held in the hand of the Trans-
mitter. It is performed in precisely the same manner as the pre-
ceding feat. Be sure to have the Transmitter understand that he
is to think of hut one figure at a time, until it is drawn, and then
the next, aFld so on.
140 SECRETS OF INDIA
THE WATCH NUMBER TEST
DEMONSTRATION X. The feat of reading and drawing the
number of a person's watch is a variation of the last mentioned
demonstration, and is performed in precisely the same way.
THE GEOMETRICAL FIGURE TEST
DEMONSTRATION XI. Have the audience select some simple
geometrical figure, such as a square, triangle, circle, right angle,
etc., and proceed to draw it in the same way as the figures in the
demonstrations just described. Have the Transmitter hold the
figure in his mind and mentally draw it as you proceed. A little
private practice will enable you to draw these figures easily, and
in fact, they are really simpler than numbers, although more start-
lingly effective at times.
DRAWING PICTURES
DEMONSTRATION XII. The same principle described in the
above mentioned test may be extended to apply to the drawing
of simple pictures, such as the outline figure of a pig, etc. The
copy is placed on the table or blackboard, so that the Transmitter
may easily refer to it, and then you proceed as in the feats above
mentioned. Practice this until you "get it down fine."
THE HmoEN NAME
DEMONSTRATION XIII. The same principle may be ex-
tended to the writing down of the name of a person, town, etc.,
previously chosen by the audience. Drawn in large letters, so
that the eye of the Transmitter may easily follow you at each
step.
THE UNDERLYING RULE
In all of the "Drawing Demonstrations," you should remem-
ber the primary principle, i.e., Follow the line of the least Mental
Resistance, and the Will of the Transmitter will invariably lead
you to the right direction.
THE "SIMPLER METHOD"
A simpler method of performing the feats and demonstrations
which we have styled "The More Difficult Feats," is that of
having the Transmitter stand by your right side, turning toward
you and placing his right hand over yours, the tips of his fingers
resting on your fingers between your large knuckles and first joints,
(instead of standing on your left side with his fingers grasped in
your left hand, as heretofore mentioned). This method is not
nearly so good so far as appearances go, for some critical mem-
bers of the audience might object that he was in confederacy with
you and really helping you to draw- but it is highly effective so
far as simplifying the feat is concerned. His finger-tips with their
MIND READING 141
nervous matter aroused into activity seem to fairly charge your
fingers with "nervous energy," or "magnetism," and your band
acts almost automatically. The motion of the Receiver's hand and
fingers, under this method becomes almost like the motion of a
"Planchette," and often writes and draws the numbers, figuref?,
letters, etc., so easily and smoothly, that they seem to be fairly
"running away" from the mind of the performer. You should at
least familiarize yourself with this method, so as to be able to
use it in emergencies, or in the case of a poor Transmitter, or else
in the case of the more delicate and complex tests. If you neglect
this method, you will have failed to acquaint yourself with one
of the most startling features of Contact Mind Reading, which so
far touches the higher phenomena that it is closely akin to what
is known as "Automatic Writing." In fact, if you are dispose~,
and are naturally receptive and sensitive to impressions, you may
even write a letter through the Will of a good Transmitter, by this
method. By all means make yourself acquainted with its possi-
bilities, and phenomena.
We now pass on to a consideration of the more Sensational Feats.
SENSATIONAL FEATS
In addition to the feats given in this work, which, together with
their countless variations, form the stock in trade of the majority
of the professional Mind Readers, there are a number of other
feats essayed by the public performers which we have seen fit to
group under the general title "Sensational Feats." These feats are
described here in order that the student may understand the na-
ture of them, and the manner of their performance. But we con-
sider such feats suitable only for the sensational advertisements of
the professional performers, and always dependent upon more or
less spectacular accessories, and attended by even dangerous fea-
tures in the case of the driving feat. And therefore we do not offer
them for reproduction by the private student, or the parlor demon"
strator. The principal Sensational Feats performed by the pw-
fessionals, are as follows:
THE DRIVING FEAT
This is performed by the performer, blindfolded as usual, driv-
ing a team along the public streets to some selected point, which
point is usually a hotel previously selected by a public committee.
Upon reaching the hotel the performer goes to the hotel registe.r,
turns the pages and finds a name previously selected. The per-
former receives his impressions from members of the committee
who are seated beside him on the carriage seat, with their arms on
his shoulders, or having hold of his hands, or even connected with
him by wire. The feat is really a spectacular reproduction of the
familiar feats described in previous chapters, and the principles
142 SECRETS OF IrmIA
governing it are precisely the same. The Transmitters impress the
direetion upon him, and he follows the line of the Least Mental
Resistance.
THE COM BINATION LocK FEAT
This feat is employed either separately, or in connection with
the Driving Feat. It consists in the performer opening the com-
bination safe of a hotel or some business establishment. In this
case the Transmitter must know the combination perfectly, and
his mental impressions acting upon the performer give him the
cue to turn "right" or "left" or "repeat," as the case may be. Of
course one must have cultivated a great degree of sensitiveness to
mental impressions before he will be able to receive and respond
to the direction impressions in this case. And yet almost any per·
son by following the directions given in this work, and carefully
and repeatedly practicing the various feats and demonstrations
given herein, may be able to reproduce this feat of the professional
performer, who is in constant daily practice, and who is able to
Elevote his entire time to the work, as his "bread and butter" is
concerned therein. Once the sensitiveness is gained, the details
of the work are nothing more than those employed in any of the
"finding" or "drawing" feats herein described and explained.
THE O FFICE D ETECTIVE FEAT
In this feat the public committee picks out an object on the
desk, or about the office of some one of its members, the office be-
ing located some distance from the place of meeting. The per-
former then rushes along the public streets, dragging the Trans-
mitter with him, until the office is reached, then up stairs, and into
the room selected, and up to the desk, or other place, and lo! the
object is found. Divesting this feat of all its sensational features,
the student will see that it is merely a variation of the ordinary
"finding" feat performed in the parlor. It creates a great sensa·
tion, but there is nothing more wonderful about it than about the
simplest "finding" feat.
THE PosToFFicE FEAT
Another feat favored by some of the professional performers is
that 6f having a letter placed in a post-office lock-box, the key of
which is given the performer at a point some distance from the
post office. Rushing through the public streets, dragging the
Transmitter with him, the performer finds the post-office in the
usual way, and then locates the lock-box, into which he inserts the
key and extracts the letter, thus triumphantly completing the feat.
This feat, as every student will see, is merely a variation of the
simpler feats manifested in a sensational manner for the purpose of
public advertisement.
•
-~
MIND READING 143
THE FIRE-ALARM FEAT
This feat is another "free advertisement" demonstration, in
which the performer, with the permission of the city officials, dis·
covers the location of a certain fire-alarm box, and turns on the
alarm with the key which had been previously loaned him. Some
public officials allow this test to be performed, using it as a test
alarm for the department as well, and the sight and sound of the
clanging fire-engines, the smoke, and confusion following upon
the sensational Mind Reading demonstration is calculated to cause
great excitement and interest in the town, which usually results
in packed houses at the night entertainment. But the test is
really nothing hut a variation of the simple "finding the spot" dem-
onstration, with sensational accompaniments. Many other tests
of unusual interest can be worked out by the average person who
attempts these feats.
MENTAL TRAINING
MIND TRAINING
)ftITH the proper mental training there is no limit to man's
\JJ possibilities. During the time devoted to mental growth
you should be careful not to harbor any negative or pessi-
mistic thoughts. It is necessary then to analyze the thoughts com-
ing into the mind and exterminate those of a negative or pessimistic
nature.
In order to accomplish this, as soon as you realize that you are
harboring thoughts which are detrimental to your well-being,
BREATHE THROUGH THE NOSTRILS AND WHILE HOLD-
ING THE BREATH MAKE THE POSITIVE MENTAL AFFIR-
MATION "GET OUT," and instantly the thought will leave the
mind. Again and again, like an unwelcome stranger these detri-
mental thoughts will return to you, but by continual use of the
above method of extermination, you will in time succeed in attain-
ing a thorough mental house cleaning.
SUBJECTIVE CoNCENTRATION
In order to control or direct the mind into constructive channels
(without which, success in any phase of life cannot be attained) sit
erect in a straight back chair, CLOSE YOUR EYES and relax as
much as possible. Do not have any tenseness whatever on the
body.
Imagine there is in front of you a tiny black speck about the
size of a pin point. Imagine this tiny speck growing, slowly very
slowly, until it is a huge black ball about three feet in diameter,
and by your will and imagination, hold it there for one minute, and
then, slowly very slowly, allow the huge ball to recede back to a
tiny speck__J_its original size and position.
The benefits derived from this exercise is when you carefully
notice that the size, color and distance of the tiny speck and huge
ball are always the same. This exe~ise develops SUBJECTIVE
CONCENTRATION. Do this exercise each morning for three
minutes.
KEY TO VISUALIZATION
In order to visualize something you are desirous of bringing into
manifestation, relax and be very quiet. Close your eyes and first
think of the thing you want to visualize. YOU MUST FIRST
BECOME THAT THING IN THOUGHT. You must actually
live the idea while thinking of it. Now take a mental note that
you do not see it in your imagination.
The mind has a tendency to portray everything you think of as an
illustration. Think of a chair or table and instantly a chair or
table is portrayed in the mind, but if you think of electricity or
144
MENTAL TRAINING 145
life, nothing can be seen. (Stop reading and try it).
After thinking of the idea in pure thought first, then you will
see it and, slowly very slowly, by an effort of your will, project
it through space. While projecting your idea through space, take
a few deep breaths through the nostrils (not too deep) and you
will find that by combining the rythmic breath with the conscious
thought, you are able to hold on to the idea longer. It is not neces-
sary to force or hold the breath for more than six seconds.
If the thing you have visualized comes into manifestation it is
not because you have created it in the mental atmosphere, but be-
cause certain brain cells have been developed and the mind, which
is a magnet, draws and attracts to you things, people and condi-
tions which enable you to bring into manifestation the idea you
held in the mind.
How TO FIND y OURSELF
Devote at least three consecutive nights to this exercise. Upon
awaking at anytime during the night or in the morning, analyze
the first thought that enters the mind. This will show you who
you are. If the line of thoughts entering the mind at this time
are not in harmony with your ideals of life, you must change them
by the following method:
Just as you are on the point of dropping off to sleep, PICTURE
CLEARLY IN THE MIND what you .want to be and realize it.
Upon awaking in the morning or at a~ytime during the night, you
must have in mind the same line of thoughts you had upon going
to sleep-THE THOUGHTS OF YOUR IDEALS.
This exercise must be carried through without any break in
consciousness. The idea must come into the mind no matter when
you wake, either during the night or in the morning, you must have
the same thought.
To accomplish this sit quietly for at least five minutes and make
your resolutions. Picture them clearly in the mind. Visualize and
REALIZE them. This exercise must be done daily.
SELF SUGGESTION
Sit quietly in a semi·dark room, place a piece of white paper
or a white handkerchief upon your knees, adjust it so there will
be no strain whatever upon the eyes. Soon a state of mental
calmness will be attained. When this state is reached, REALIZE
deeply within yourself what you want to be. The idea will then
be imbedded in the sub·conscious mind. This is the best method
for reaching the sub-conscious mind.
How To REACH THE MINDS OF OTHERS
Sit quiet, relax, and with feeling make this affirmation: I AM
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. (You are the center of your
own universe and the most important person in your own life).
Realize that you are a Dynamic battery endowed with unlimited
146 SECRETS OF INDIA
mental powers, and then calmly harness that energy by conscious
realization. Your entire individuality must be centered in that
idea. You must be a living impersonation of the idea.
Now make a mental picture of the person you are desirous of
reaching no matter how great the distance may he. Hold the
picture of that person clearly in your mind. Now imagine you are
holding a white string in your hand, extending from you to the
person you are trying to reach. See that this string is attached
to the person. Every time the picture seems to fade from your
mind pull the string easy, and as you do this the picture will he
brought back to your mind instantly. Then picture in your mind
the message you wish to send to the person. See the message in
clear, white letters leaving you very slowly. Word for word see
the message suspended in space, between you and the person you
are sending it to, see it steadily going to them, and just before it
reaches them, pull the string. If this is done properly it enables
you to reach the minds of others at once. This exercise should he
used only for constructive purposes and never for selfish motives
or to take advantage of others.
Just as it is possible for you to reach the mind of others, so it
is possible for others to reach you. If at any time you feel that
you are being influenced by anyone realize that the CHRIST in
you is your protector. If you feel that you are being influenced
during sleep, you should upon going to bed, and just at the point
of dropping off to sleep, make this affirmation: I AM NOW EN-
VELOPED IN THE DIVINE ESSENSE OF MY CREATOR
WHERE ALL IS PEACE. This must he realized deeply.
SELF ESTEEM
You are judged by people according to the value you place upon
yourself. In order to develop self esteem use this method. When
walking, make these affirmations with every step you take: "I AM
MASTER," "I AM POWER," "SELF MASTERY,'' as the physical
step is taken and the affirmation made. The physical reacts upon
the mental, houying you up with every step that is taken. Practice
this exercise for a few days and it will soon become automatic, giv-
ing you self confidence and Mastery of the body.
How TO GET AN ANSWER TO y OUR PROBLEMS
No matter what problems you have in life you can get an answer
which will lead you in the right way. When you have a problem
you are desirous of getting an answer to, mentally chant this word
"AUM... Repeat the word over and over again with intense
feeling and reverence.
AUM is God's name and by chanting it you are calling upon and
tapping the higher Divine part of yourself. After chanting the
word mentally he quiet and endeavor to register the impressions
you receive. These impressions may come as a hunch, with feeling
!
•
•
-.·
"I
MENTAL TRAINING 147
or as an intuition. Knowing, following the impressions receiTed.
It is best to start with the smaller problems at first, and endeavor
to solve them correctly. This will then give you the necessary
faith in yourself and your ability to solve the larger problems of
life.
KEY TO lNSPIRATION
Sit quiet, relax, close your eyes. Place your hand in a com·
fortable position on a nearby table or arm of a chair. Imagine
you are holding a tiny green bud in your hand. This bud slowly
opens and develops into a beautiful flower (you can imagine it as
any kind of flower or color you care to have it.) Now it is in full
bloom, a beautiful flower. Make this imaginary flower more beau-
tiful and daily improve upon its beauty in every way.
Do this exercise daily for ten minutes always making an effort
to improve upon the beauty of the flower. What you are really
doing is developing the finer brain cells, and this in turn enables
you to make use of all your latent powers and to put the best into
the work you are doing.
KEY TO MAGNETISM
When you are attracted to a person, it is not their physical body,
but their magnetism which attracts you. Another's magnetism may
have an uplifting, stimulating, repulsive or depressing effect
upon you.
To find out the source of an attraction, be it physical or other-
wise, quietly relax and endeavor to picture the person before you,
and then analyze them from a purely physical angle, not their
personality, but all their physical characteristics. Your mind
must be calm, quiet and receptive. With your eyes closed, men·
tally hold the image of the person before you in your imagination.
Do not imagine anything concerning them. Simply hold their ·
image in the mind without any disturbing influence. (This is very
important.) If this is practiced carefully, all their physical traits
will then flow into your mind and awaken similar reactions in your
own body. If you feel no physical reaction in your body then
the attraction is not physical.
To find out if the attraction is mental, use the same exercise
given above, but in this case, turn the mind entirely away from the
person's body and physical characteristics and endeavor to an·
alyze them in a mental sense. If the attraction is mental then your
own mind will respond with a feeling of upliftment and stimu-
lation.
To find out if the attraction is spiritual, you will turn your mind
away from the physical and mental traits of the person and an·
alyze them in a spiritual sense. If the attraction is spiritual the
reaction will be a feeling of bliss throughout your entire person·
ality.

If you at any time feel or receive an idea coming from someone
(be it physical or otherwise) whose influence you do not desire,
simply deny it mentally. This mental denial must he made very
emphatically.
How To DEVELOP PERCEPTION
Everyone you come in daily contact with, makes an impression
of some kind upon you as you come enrapport with them. Also
at times when you think of people who are absent, you receive im-
pressions concerning them.
In order to find out the source of these impressions, or the mes·
sage which the impressions convey to you, it is necessary for you
to concentrate the mind upon the feeling aroused in your own body.
By concentrating upon that feeling a right perception of the feeling
can be attained.
This will also give you the key by which you can analyze the
mental makeup of others, and also enables you to know the thoughts
and feelings which others may harbor towards you.
How To DEVELOP MAGNETISM
Sit very quiet, draw a slow deep breath through both nostrils
while counting six. Hold the breath while mentally affirming with
deep feeling, "I AM DYNAMIC." Exhale slowly, and repeat the
exercise. While holding the breath, and with intense feeling, make
this affirmation: "I AM NOW TRANSMUTING THIS BREATH
INTO A LIVING FORCE OF MAGNETISM AND DIRECTING
IT TO EVERYY CELL OF MY BODY." Repeat this exercise a
few times, and endeavor to realize it. Hold the breath again, and
with deep feeling, make the following affirmation: "I AM POW-
ER." Feel that you are powerful or feel as though energy is ra·
diating from you. Repeat several times daily and endeavor to
carry that feeling of power and force with you in solving the prob·
lems of daily life.
TRANSMUTING MENTAL ENERGY
When you are about to gossip, to lose your temper, become ex-
cited or find yourself harboring any thoughts or emotions that
you know from experience is detrimental to your well-being, affirm
with intense feeling, "I AM DYNAMIC."
Resolve to be master of your mind and daily use exercises in
concentration. Be positive in what you believe is right according
to the dictates of your own conscience. Also be positive to all
evil suggestions, either coming from yourself or others.
Have a mind of your own. Determine to do a thing and do not
desist for even the fraction of a second. Feel and say "I AM MAS·
TERING MY MIND NOW," "INSIST UPON SELF MASTERY
AT ONCE." Again and again repeat this affirmation, "SELF
MASTERY AT ONCE."
..
MENTAL TRAINING 149
The repetition of the above affirmation will start powerful vi-
brations in your body, will eliminate mental weakness and com·
plexes in your consciousness, and will establish a powerful, con·
structive force of thought activity which will enable you to go
fearlessly through life, burning all your mental fetters, large and
small.
Realize SELF MASTERY at once! Think it! Breathe it! Feel
it in every cell of your body! "SELF MASTERY AT ONCE"!
"AT ONCE"! "AT ONCE SELF MASTERY"! Calmly and quiet·
ly realize it. Then fearlessly go out into the world and act it.
The power which you are endeavoring to develop is nearer to
you than the flesh of your bones, but it must be consciously evoked,
acted upon and lived.
KEY TO REJUVENATION
There is a force in nature which is called Prana energy. This
force is permeating all space. It is drawn into the body through
the spleen, which is on the left side of the body. The breath acts
as a vehicle for the Prana.
As you inbreathe normally through the nostrils, this force is
drawn through the spleen. When you exhale normally, with the
abdomen drawn in, this Prana force goes to certain centers of the
body.
This force makes the circulation of the nerves, just the same as
the blood makes the circulation of the body. By an effort of the
will, this Prana can be harnessed and used to stimulate and elec·
trify the body, eliminating all feelings of tiredness, thereby keep·
ing the body preserved for an indefinite period. In just one min-
ute you can recharge and stimulate the body.
Exercise 1.-Stand firmly on the floor with both hands at the
side. Now clinch both hands tightly, take a deep breath throul!:h
the nostrils, holding the breath about six seconds. While still
holding the breath, tense the entire body, stretching erect. Now let
go of all tenseness, including the hands, and relax all over for
one minute. Repeat this exercise three times.
Exercise 2.-Again stand firmly on the floor, bring both hands
up to the chest, close the hands tight across the chest and tense
them as much as possible. Now slowly stretch out both hands
horizontally, putting all the pressure on the muscles as they are
being stretched out, at the same time taking a deep breath through
both nostrils and holding the breath for six seconds.
Exercise 3-Standing on the floor with the right hand extended
a few inches from the body, tightly clinch the hand and slowly
twist it around in a half circle backward and forward, while keep·
ing all tenseness on the hand. Take a slow deep breath through
the nostrils holding same for six seconds, then' slowly let go all
tenseness, and the energy will be felt in the arms. Stop for a few
seconds and realize and absorb this energy by the conscious re·
150 SECRETS OF INDIA
laxation of the members used. Do the same with the left hand.
Repeat daily for five or ten minutes.
Exercise ~Standing on the floor, hands resting on the back of
a chair raise the right foot about two feet from the floor. Now
tense the muscles, and while holding the tenseness, take a deep
breath, holding the breath for about six seconds. Relax the mus-
cles and exhale slowly. Do this exercise three times with the right
foot, then relax and rest for a few minutes. Do the same with the
left foot. Repeat daily for five or ten minutes.
How To STRENGTHEN THE EYES
Exercise 1-This exercise may he done either sitting or standing.
Close both eyes tight, keeping the tenseness for a few seconds. With
the eyes still closed, slowly relax the tenseness. As you relax, take
a deep breath, willing that the intaken breath is going to the optic
nerves. If this exercise is done properly the energy will he felt
in the eyes. It is not the breath that goes to the eyes, it is the energy,
and by the tensing and relaxing exercises, the muscles and nerves
are stimulated by this energy.
Exercise 2-Another good eye exercise is to light a candle and
place it on a table about six or eight feet from you. Look directly
into the flame of the candle for about ten to fifteen minutes each
day.
By combining the above two exercises great benefits can be de-
rived, whether there is defective vision or not, and unless you have
some physical defect you can in time discard your glasses entirely.
How To TAKE A FACIAL
This exercise must be practiced every morning for ONE MIN-
UTE ONLY. Kneel down on the floor being careful to place both
knees closely together. Now bend forward until the forehead
touches the floor and remain in this position for ONE MINUTE
ONLY, then look into your mirror. This exercise stimulates the
blood vessels in the face, gives light to the eyes and life and vigor
to the skin. This exercise should be done once each day, and for
ONE MINUTE ONLY.
How To REoucE
After using the tensing exercises, go on an exclusive raw vege-
table diet as much as possible, FRUIT JUICES of all kinds, es-
pecially oranges, grapes, grapefruit, pineapple and lemon. The
juice of one lemon added to the juice of two oranges taken twice
daily, or the juice of one lemon and the juice of one grapefruit.
The solid food should consist of whole wheat bread, lettuce with
olive oil and lemon juice (no vinegar). Spinach, carrots, parsley,
milk cheese and nuts of all kinds. Also a warm bath, with one
pound of epsom salts in the water, should be taken daily.

How TO TAKE ON WEIGHT
Every morning before or at breakfast time take twelve almonds,
the juice of one orange and one teaspoonful of strained honey.
Stir well and masticate slowly. If no other food is taken then you
can increase the amount by taking twenty-four almonds, the juice
of two oranges and two spoonsful of honey. This breakfast will
stimulate the cells of the entire body and aid assimilation and also
increase the appetite. Your remaining meals may be taken natur·
ally.
CONSCIOUS EVOLUTION
There are four forces which go to build up the personality of
man. They may be rightfully called the powers of the soul. To
be able to consciously control and direct these forces, gives one the
key to conscious growth and deveropment. These forces are as
follows: Breathing, Thinking, Feeling and Willing.
BREATHING
The breath is one of the connecting links between the soul and
the physical world. Man needs air the same as the fish needs
water. By observing _a simple method of breath regulation, man
can consciously raise his consciousness above breath, and have a
fuller realization of his latent spiritual powers and his Immortal
Self.
Exercise-This can be done anywhere at anytime. Concentrate on
the breath when inbreathing and outbreathing. When inbreathing,
imagine the breath as a silvery thread entering the nostrils. When
outbreathing concentrate and see the breath as a fine silvery thread
leaving the nostrils. There must be no tenseness of any kind, just
keep the mind on the breath. With just a little practice this he·
comes automatic and natural.
This exercise has a tendency to slow down the action of the
diaphram, lungs and heart. As the pressure is taken from the in·
ternal organs they are strengthened and rejuvenated, thereby giv·
ing more life and energy to them. If this exercise is practiced
upon retiring at night, and without concentrating on anything
after it is once started, it will induce sleep. If this exercise is
practiced diligently a state of conscious passivity is attained. As
you are now released (in a measure from sense desires), a realiza·
tion of the latent forces of the sub-conscious mind is attained, you
can now direct to the development of the mental and spiritual side
of your nature.
THINKING
"Be ye therefore transformed daily by the reneWing of your
mind."-Bible.
The above quotation carries a tremendous truth which must be
consciously applied daily. You must plant new, constructive ideas
152 SECRETS OF INDIA
in your mind each day, water them with faith, nourish them with
love, and consciously live in the expectation of the fulfillment of
your life's ideal.
Thought is the power which binds man to the earth or raises him
to celestial realms. If you wish to raise above your conditions and
environment, an inner transformation must be made. Your ob-
jective life is simply a reflection of your inner thoughts. The
thoughts which you harbor in secret within yourself.
A simple daily method for transformation is to realize that you
are a soul occupynig a body. You are a soul living in eternity and
eternity" is here and now. Try to realize that this planet is a vast
stage and that you are an actor playing your part in the great drama
of life.
Daily think, live and play your part as the successful actor plays
his part. Utilize your constructive imagination to improve upon
your part and fearlessly play the part, combining it with mental
and spiritual activity and a conscious realization of growth and
improvement.
When disappointment and failure comes your way (as it surely ·
will) do not be depressed. Realize that failures and disappoint·
ments are only transitory and that the passing events must not up-
set your inner equilibrium.
Your own life's experience has taught you that throughout all
nature there is a rise and fall, a.gain or a loss. This law is known
as the law of polarity or the principles of opposites. This law is
expressed at the very dawn of consciousness in the human soul
when instinct is born.
It is also manifested throughout all nature. There is summer
and winter, positive and negative, black and white, hard and soft,
action and reaction, repression and expression, night and day.
Throughout all nature this law is in operation.
In all growth there is an apparent lost gain and the advance-
ment is greater than the decline. There were periods in your life
where you can see that you made progress. At other times you
apparently lost, but you will notice that you always gained more
than you lost.
For this reason you should always keep on the constructive and
positive side at all times, for if you allow yourself to be depressed
when the pendulum swings back and remains in the negative state
you will only reap the negative side of nature.
As this statement clearly elucidates: "To him that hath shall be
given and to him that hath not shall be taken away even that which
he hath"-Bible. Meaning that the more you are mentally equipped
to fight life's battles, the more you will derive. The less you are
equipped the less you will get.

MEMORY
In the development, memory is one of the most essential and
important factors. Memory is cultivated by interest, attention and
repetition.
One of the greatest errors made by most people is living in the
memories of incidents which were detrimental to them in the past.
Everyone has made mistakes, and if you allow yourself to live in
the mistakes of the past, you stagnate your own growth. Endeavor
then to absorb and live only in the memories of the things which
were helpful and constructive. Live in the Eternal.
How To DEVELOP INTUITION
Intuition is that faculty of Spiritual Perception, which enables
one to know truth as it is. This faculty is the birthright of all,
but it is undeveloped in most individuals. It can, however, be cul-
tivated by all.
When intuition is developed, it enables one to know things as
they are. To develop the intuition one of the first and most im-
portant things is to live a truthful life as much as you possibly
can. Second, continued activity by keeping the mind on a certain
idea. Thirdly, by consciously registering impression from others
and certain conditions of life. Fourth, by attaining a state of
mental calmness no matter what may happen.
MENTAL CALMNESS
Mental calmness can be attained by following this simple ex-
ercise. Relax, close your eyes and with intense feeling make this
affimation from five to ten minutes, "POISE." Mentally affirm
"POISE" three times very loud, then slowly affirm it a little less
loud each time until it becomes a mere whisper and bury the idea
deeply in your consciousness.
EMOTIONS
The emotions are powerful forces working in and through your
organism. When properly cultivated, the emotions enables you
to sense the conditions of others. When you come in contact with
others who are unhappy, jolly or in misery, endeavor to register
their conditions by feeling for them, but do not allow yourself
to take on their conditions. You must taste, so to speak, but not
assimilate.
If you would allow yourself to take on all the conditions of those
whom you meet each day you would only be carrying unnecessary
added burdens. By sympathizing with others you will then ex-
perience all the feelings the flesh is heir to, and this is of the
utmost importance to you, for as you go out into the world, it gives
you an insight into the workings of human nature.
154 SECRETS OF INDIA
Should you at any time happen to be in atmosphere which is
embarrassing or has a tendency to make you feel self-conscious,
turn the mind away from the surrounding environment and think
of anything but the place where you are.
Emotional control and self-expression can be developed by the
simple method of learning to speak slowly. A splendid exercise
is to read daily some constructive article from a book or maga·
zine. Read aloud as though you were reading to someone and
while reading to put all your feeling into what you are reading.
Do this for about ten minutes or so. This will give you self-ex-
pression.
WILL
Will power can be developed in any line of endeavor, by in-
tense action and faith. Faith is an important requisite in develop-
ing the will. Believe and trust yourself. Mentally learn to stand
upon your own feet. You will make mistakes and fall many times.
But catlike you will land on your feet. Learn to do the small
things first and devote your entire attention to doing them thor-
oughly. The larger things of life will be taken. care of if you de-
vote your attention to doing the small things well.
Execute your will power first upon yourself. Determine to
rise at a certain hour each morning and do it. Visit with people
you feel do not want you. Force yourself to do cheerfully at least
one disagreeable task each day. Several times daily suggest to
yourself: "My Will Is Strong," "I AM DEVELOPING A STRONG
WILL," "I WILL DEVELOP A STRONG WILL."
To merely repeat the above affirmation parrot like is of no
value. They must be spoken with emphasis and intense feeling.
Think deeply of the affirmations made. Have faith in yourself and
consciously know that you are developing a strong will power.
You will feel yourself growing stronger and the tasks which
heretofore seemed difficult and beyond your power to overcome,
will easily be mastered. Bad ·habits will be overcome and things
in general will work much smoother for you, due to your ability
to WILL WHAT YOU WILL TO BE.
