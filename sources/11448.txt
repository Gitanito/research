I was at my mom' house, I stayed there the night before from a New Year party; everyone was getting ready to go home. I was sitting on the couch and I slowly felt like my body was slowing down. I went to call for my mom but I had no energy to do so. There were seven people there. I remember a tear rolled down my cheek and I went out.

About one to two minutes later, I opened my eyes. I was standing behind the couch, and then I realized I was not in my body. I saw my mom run to the back of the couch. She was trying to wake me up and slapping my cheeks but my body had no response. It was as if I was in between the couch and my mom. I could see and hear everything and everyone but all I remember feeling is peace and calmness. I had no fear. I could see my boyfriend at the time across the room standing next to our friend.  My brother's girlfriend was sitting in a rocking chair.  Everyone was staring at my body. They were all just frantic. They called 911. Emergency medical technicians came in and I watched them take blood pressure and prick fingers while trying to talk to me. Then they said, 'We have to take her to the hospital now.' They would not let my mom ride with me because they were afraid they would have to resuscitate me. They moved my body.

I remember waking up in the hospital but everything was a baby blue color. I asked the nurse or doctor why, they told me that a lot of people see things in a baby blue color before they die or after they have an experience like that.
