  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 20 years old and got into a fight where I was  shot.  The bullet ruptured my  atria and  pericardium.  I was still alive when 20 minutes later I arrived at the hospital. I tried to get on the stretcher on my own, but I didn't have any strength left.

  I had never been in a hospital before, much less in an operating room.  After the operation, I told the doctor everything about how he was proceeding and the instruments he requested.  I had a cardiac arrest at the time of the surgery, and another arrest after surgery.  This was where I told him how he proceeded to cut my sternum and do heart massaging by hand.  I also told him that an electrical outlet wasn't working, and they changed to a different one to use something like a polisher with a cog wheel.  I was watching everything calmly.  I never saw a light or a tunnel.
