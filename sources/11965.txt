  		              		Experience Description   

    After A chemotherapy session at home, I went into a coma. I was rushed to a hospital by my parents. I  was  in the intensive care unit  (ICU) for eight days. 

  I woke up in my bed at home.  I identified things in my bedroom to confirm where I was.   I passed through the window behind my bed  and travelled down the street. It was night and I saw lights on in the homes. We did not have sidewalks, but I walked in the grass near the road as I passed five or six of my neighbor's homes.  I travelled back to my home and got in bed again. Then, I saw bright light that was really white. I was looking at it and  was pulled toward it.

    I began to shake. As the shaking reached  my head, I woke up in the arms of the  ICU nurse.    She held me close and was calling out my name  repeatedly.  She released me as I woke up. I asked why I was there.  She said I had been in the coma for 8 days, during which time I had stopped breathing. The blood pressure alarm went off while she was at her desk. She told me that  she called for help. They had to shock me twice and I didn't respond. She said she grabbed me and was yelling at me to live.  She said I moaned and took a deep breath and then melted in her arms. After which, my breathing was better. My blood pressure went back to normal levels. My bladder and bowels had released in the bed, so  she thought I was dead.  She was glad I came back.  I felt better the next morning. 

  I told my therapist a month later. I survived AML and I survived the Coma. I survived the NDE also.

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness.        Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function).   I was diagnosed with AML Leukemia. I was getting chemoregulary at the hospital.  I had also just had surgery on my left hand, to remove a tumor. It was after that surgery, I went into a coma for 8 days.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

The experience included:      Out of body experience  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I saw cars passing me as I walked barefooted in the grass across the neighbors' yards.  I remember my feet getting wet by walking in the grass.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it.  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.  It was a clearance of body and mind. In real life, I do not have that clearness in my body. I was not able to talk to anyone about the experience until I met with my therapist a month later to talk about chemo, cancer, being young, and in school.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         From waking up in my home bed and all during the travel outside and back and returning.  I was awake in the bed with the bright light.  It was during the shaking that in that life, I felt weak and was pulled back to the arms of a registered nurse. There I woke up groggy and learned what had really happened in the ICU. I was alert the next day around 5am and my parents arrived at 6am to visit.
