THE object ol this workis to elucidate the Scienee
of As&rG}Qgy~ byiL ade~ioa froa the Mat aed mostes-
teemed Anthon. with NIUI'k1 aDd improvements
suggested by loDg ~ To penon• acqoainted
with the Scieace, it u.t be obviou that some Work
of<llhis natare is imperiously called for, tt) rescne the
Astral Art from the di&graee likely to be thrown upon
it, by a recent Publication of amost aivgnlar nature:*
no nonsensical hieroglyphics are given, as it must be
plain to every oDe that they ean anawer no purpose
but this, that by being of an obscure nature, they may
afterwards be explained in any way which may best
agree with succeeding events.

. A few articles are given explanatory ofAstronomi-
tal principles as applied to this Science, by which
any person, however· ignorant of Astronomy, will be
able to comprehend· all of it that·is necessary towards
a proficiency in Astrology.
The most plain and simple inlltructions are given to
erect a figure of the Heavens to any required periC?d,
'followed by easy rules to enable a perso.n, in a short
time, to judge for himself as to the general truth of
the Science.
The best rules are selected from the works of
Ptolemy, Placidus, Partridge,* &c. for the judgment
apd calculation- of nativities ; illustrated by examples
from the·genitures of persons,. many of them now
living, who have beendistinguished by a succession of
fortunate or tJnfortunate ewnts,' remarkable accidents,
severe illnesses, or violent daths.
Some curious remarks, made from practiee, on the
nature and eft"ects of the newly-discovered ..ph1net
Herschel; .ip short, every part of the Science, from its
most a~struse pt,inciples are examined and explained.
* The latter is «~nera!Iy allowed to have been the most acute and·
aeientitic Author tbat ev..r wrote in the English language on thi"
1ubject. ·
AD.DRESS.
LONG eatablished custom bas . reu<lered a prefator1
Addrese eo essential to the first appearance of a Work, that tha
allaence of it might be supposed to imply a want of proper ·re- .
apect, and from the peculiar _circu~~~~ttances Jlnder.which,we .IMciu
our·Work. it becomeR a matter not of choice, but nec,.sitJ. Ap,_
pearing as we.do the professed tuhocatea of a Science generally
thought tiditioWt, . we must t>f course give .some reaaona for our
~uicuon of its truth. On examininJ the great Ola8a of.persona •
wbo disbelien i1i'Astrologr, it ia a remarkable cireums~ee tllat
it ia fouud to consist of tho&e who from indolence or want of·op-
pon~tJ. are tetally unacquainted with i&s pcinciplea. On tbe
other hand, those who have taken the tJ'l)nble ~o inves,igate tbe
Science, are unanimous in declaring t~eir firm ,belief that tbe
Heavenlr Bodies are the principal rulers ~f hu111an atrairs.
It is needless to say !n mch ·a east! which is the beat evi-
dence. From the ignorance of our adveraaries of the principle~
of the Srienee which they atrec~ to contemn, w~ are _
preeluded
fqJn reasoning with them on.any i11fereoces drawn fro111 its rult>s.
We must therefore confine o~ehea to tho~e 1ubjects oil which
allmen t'onfess, that the Planets are likely :to have some degree
of iaJluenee One of the most prominent of 1hese is the Tide~,
and we im-«ipe that the mqat bi!Joted of our opponents will not
duy tlaat the luminaries have an efFect upon the water. The as-
arion Ulat tbe Planet& have an eiFect .upon the air is likely to
meet with more opposition ; but if the luminaries can excite loci•
a aaotioa in.so ~en&e a 8uid aa that of water, ~t is nre)J net un-
rUHaable to auppc)se tlaat it must han an eminent el'et4--lllon
fO lip& ~. one as air.

IT is not our intention to. give an elaborate or volnmino011
.TreatU.e on Astronomy, nor i_s it our dea_ign to teach those who
have made any proficiency in it. No I but our design is to teach
those-who have no previous knowJedge of the subject, the ru-
diments of the .science, so far as is necea~ary .towards layo,
the fouujlati,on ofthe eublime science of Astrology; and li,ke_
wise
to •atiafy the curioauy. of those whose geniua prompts _
them to
the contemplation of this heavenly science,· but are not capable
.uf underatanliing abstruse or learned aetllora; who fot .the IQoat
.part, instead of explaining their conceptions .
to thote ignoi:&at of
the subject, .have.by their rhetorical figures auil higli.Bo.

•cf'lldill( node, that is Ta!II'UI 16 deg., or in the oppoaite or -~
.tcending node, viz. 16 deg. .of Scorpio. Now the Earth is in
the 16th degrees of Taurus on the 7th of May, and in the 16th
tl..grees of Scorpio on the 8th.of November; cons~quently those
·are the Oltlj times these appearances can happen to Mercury, for

Earth, or of any other plauet, which is nearest to the Sun, and
the Earth is in its Perihelion in 9 deg. of Cancer, then the ap~
parent place of t!w Sun will be 9 dPg. of Capricorn; which witl

.observe, that the description given in t.I.e following article' must
be considered as strictly applieable to them only,· when not Nnti-

liable to be materially altered. . .' ) '

REMARKS ON THE NATIVITY OF LORD BYRON.
There is a name .that will sunive
Roralty's monumental stone,
And, long as hiatorr can give
Deaerv'd renown, must dt'athlets live;
BvaoN, it fs thine own.
'fbe time of birth of this trul7 noble aud most illustrious poet,
was given me by l'rlr. I. Y., the celebrated arti!t, and amateur in
Occult Science; who obtained it some rears since, from an au-
thentic source; so that there can be no doubt of its correctneaa.
And certainly, its perfect agreement, with the principal known
eventa of his life, exhibits a moat remarkable proof of the &rulb.
of Altrology.

'The e11.traordinary mental qualifications which the natin poa-
nseed, are most amply demonstrated, by the positions and con6-
gurations, of the Moon and MerCUJ'1. The latter planet, is the
principal ruler of the intellectual faculties, and being free from
the afBietion of the solar rays, in the moveable and tropical 1ig11,
Capricorn; oriental, and approaching a sextile of the ascendant,
by which means he may be said to be in a gloriov• po•itiolf, con-
tributes, according tv the quadripartite of Ptolemy, to render the
mind " clever, sensible, capable of great learning, inventive, ex·
pert, logical, studious of nature, speculative, of good genius, emu-
lous, benevolent, skilful in argument, accurate in conjecture, and
adapted to science and mysteJ'1." • The page also adds, "tract-
able;" but Mercury being in opposition to the Moon and Mars,
instead of tractability, gives an hatred of contronl; haspires the
native with the molt lofty ideas, aad aspiring sentiments; gives
him originality, and eccentricity, with a tirmnese of mind almost
inclining to obstinacy; and which made this illustrious nati•e
eucb an enemy to the track of custom, for which he was 10 re-
markable, and which contributed to form that lofty genius (which
alike, rode in the whirlwind, or sparkled in the sun-beam.)
The disposition and rational faculties, are no lese plainly de-
uribed by the position of the Moon, in conjunction with Mars;
likewise, in a tropical and cardinal sign; wherein she is powerful.
While Mars is nearly in exact mundane trine to the ascendant.
These positions laid the foundation from the moment of his ex-
illence, of that peculiarit,y of disposition ; that teen and cutting
nin of1atire; that caustic and pointed wit; that quick, enterpri•·
ing and daring mind; that extraordinaJ'1 development of energie~,

to hear them talk of the Ascendant to its own Trine, and this by

more strange, that be should from hence predict danger of

JieayeDJy bodiea, with reapeet to their Magnitudes, Diatan~ea,
.llotiona,.&c. thence arising. That this science ia yery ancient·
ia not to be doubted, since it was known to the Chaldeant two
thousand year' before Babylon was taken by Alexander the
Grea&. The elearne11 of their hemisphere lint prompted them to
JDake obae"ation1, and continual practice improved them. From
tile Chaldeana the aclence tranlled into Egypt; Pythagoru, a
Greek philoaopher, who flourished about 600yean before Christ,
weat thither to be inauucted therein, where•'he soon gained a
bowledse of the &rue ayatem of the uninrse, which, on his re-
&ara, he &aught in Greece and l&aly, and from whose IllUDe it
1amed the appellation of the .P!!tugoreafl S!}lte.. In thia
a,.tem the Son ia supposed to be at reat in the centre of the pla.-
M&u'J ayatem, and the Earth to be carried round him annually;

eieat ayatem of any, 10 it ia embraced by the moat akilfal Astro;

after the death of PJthagoru, the ecience feU into pat neglect,
and almost all the Babyloniu obaena&ions were lost, and gave
way to the preniling false opinion of Ptolemy, which suppose•
the Earth to be at reet, and in the centre, and the heavens to

and minute of a sign; this is called a partile configuration; but
their et'ect doe1 not wholly cease till they are ten degrees diatant
fro111 each other, and this i1 termed a platiclt configuration ; the
11111e holds good of enry other uped as well as the conjunction,
ud extends to latitude as well u longitude. It is laid down as
a general rule that applications are more powerful than separa-
tions. This no doubt it the cue in borary questions, where, if
the aignilicator. are aepvaling from any upect, it ia a symbol that
all probability of the event's occurring is pusing away; but ia
aalivities, where real inftuence is to be taken into consideration,
it 1eems more reuonable to anppoae that when.the upect hu
actually been formed, and the planets still continue in platick fa-
miliarity, that they will be more strongly impressed with each
others inllucnce, than when they are only proceediug to such a
~lguratiou ; we lind the beat of the Sun more powerful about
two or three o'clock in the afternoon, when be bu puaed the
meridian, tbau at twelve, the time be is actually on it. Coojunc-
tioaa are evil with the malefic planets, and good with the benigo.
SEMISEXTILE.
The Semiaextile,or twelfth part of a eirclt>, is a distance of thirty
degrees in the zodiac,or one-third ofa semi-are io the world, and.
i1 nppo~ed to be slightly beneficial.
SEMIQUADRATE.
The Semiquadrate, or Semiquartile, the eighth part of a cirele,
ie a distance l>f forty-live degrees in the ecliptic, or one-half a
1emi-are in the world. This upect, though not allowed by Pla-
eidu, there is enry reuon to suppose is nry evil, and bu beea
thought br some go~ judges to equal, if not exceed, the •quare
in JDalnolence.

in the zodiac, ortwo-\birds of_
a seJJli·arc in the world, and is sup•
}ioaed to be inferior only to the Trine in its benign inftuence.
QUINTILE.
The Quintile, or fifth part ofa eircle, comprehends sennty-two
clegreea in the ecliptic, and a sextile and one-fifth in the world•
.Placidua admits this as one ofthe good aspects, but there is little
reason to suppose it has much efficacy.
SQUARE.
The Square, which is the fourth part of a circle, na very pOW·
erful evil aspect, and comprise& ninety degrees in the zodiac, and
asemi-arc in mundo.
TRINE.
The Trine, or tl.ird part of a circle, ia the best aspect of the
whole, and i¥ a distance of one hundred and twenty degrees in
the zodiac, or a semi-arc, and one·third in the world.
SESQUIQUADRATE.
The Sesquiquadrate, is the opposite point of the Semiqnartile,
and like that, is a discordant aspect; experience shows the ef·
feels of both to be very powerful, and their inftuence may be par-
ticularly obsened on the weather, for change~ more frequently
take place at the time of the Moon's Sesquiquadrates and.Semi·
quartilee witll. the Sun, than even her Squares and Oppositions.
It contaius one hundred and thirty·five degrees in the zodiac, ud
ia a semi-arc and a half in the world.
BIQUINTILE.
The Biquintile,or double quintile, is four-~fths of the whole di-
urnal or nocturnal-arc, or o1oe huudred and forty-four degrees of
tile ecliptic; it, like the quintile, is suppost'd to be goo«l, aDd as
~ucb, is admitted by Placidua, but experie11ce doe• notseem alto-
iether to confirm this opinio11.
QUADRASEXTILE.

delfeet ia the ecliptic; io the warld it is be-sixths of the whole
are; it ia not geaer&lly eooeidere4 aa ao aspect, but those who
maiataia that opioieo, hold it to be beoeical.
OPPOSITION.
The Oppositioo is wheo two planets are ooe huodred and
eighty degrees distaot io the zodiac, or the whole diuroal, or
oocturoal arc, io the world. Thi' is the wont aspect of the
whole, and it eigailies the most perfect dieagreement. We must
be eautioue, howenr, of adheriog too eloeely to the old opiniooa
of theae aepeete; it hu alwaya lleen euetomary to consider the
trine as aore powerful than tlae eextile, and the oppoaition thao
the ttq11&l'e; but when we reSect oo the iiBDlllll8e, aod to us, almost
iocoDceivable distance, which must be betweeo two such planeu
aa Batura aod Jupiter, or Saturo andHerschel, it seems more rea•
eonable to reverse tbi• maxim. The oext aspect which we coma
to, is the Aotiscion, zodiacal parraltel or parallel of deelioatioo;
that is, any two poiots of the ecliptic, equidis&aot from the &rst
pointe of Aries and Libra {wllich han no declirtation) are io•zo·
diacal parallel. A star in &ve degrees of Leo, haw the eame de-
dination as another in twenty-live degrees of Taurus, ancf these
would be in zodiacal parallel to two others to twenty-live de-
grees ·of Scorpio, and live degrees of Aquarius. This conftgura-
tion hu precisely the eame eft'ect as a conjunction, and.may ar.
ways be considered as such; it is to be observed, that anantisci-
ODS must be takeo with latitudes, and they can only be fouod by
referring to the tables of declination.

to ~mit them of equal power. In our practice we hue found
oune1Ye1 warranted in placing the greatest dependance on pa- .
rllllela from the tenth and fourth houses, because they are then of
equal power; hut those from the lint and sennth honsel have Ulli-
formly failed; the reaaon appears to be that from one star being

equal power of 11·hichPlacidus speaks, and consequently can pro-

ASTROLOGY THEOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED.
IN rega.tding the eeience of Aatrology Theologicul:r1 we wiab
to draw the attention of our readen to a few objections that it has
been customar:r to make to it, with a view of 1hewing how ill·
founded they have ever been, and how directly oppoaed it is to
my thing like Atlaeinn, or independence on a Supreme !king.
The hostility of the church to this science, is founded on the
same ignorance of ill principles, that is generul:r obsenable, to
which ma:r be added a fear of its consequences, that blinds its
profeaaon and renden them incapable of forming a cool judg-
ment, at the eame time they become conspicuously inconaequent
and ridiculous in argument The clericu opponent• ofAltrology
lrat picture a lpectre in theirown imll(inatiODI, dre11 it in U) the
horron of the grave-clothe•, place a lanthern in one hand and a
pitch fork in the other, and then call upon those who are alike
timid and ignorant with themaelvea to beware of the devill-
Whereas, on inspectir.og with the eye of reuon the caUie of all
this &,!arm, it tame oat to be a pole, a turnip, and a table cloth.
To punue thia friglalfvl metaphor nil farther, let Ul eaqaire
'll'hat wu the probable, original cause, and what i1 the pre1en
actual cau1e, why the clergy anathematiae A1trolop.
In the middle age• it happened that thoae who punned the
1tud1 of thi1 acience, were chie8y ph1siciana, u they etyled them-
•eiYel. TheJ, by the way, were as ignorant as the countr:r drug-
gist• of the preeent timea generall:r are, and, u it wu then ne-
re~sar;r for them to be acquainted with sidereal aubject• before
tbeJ were eligible to the practice of their profesaion, it fell out
that their stadie1 that wa:r, bei11g forced, were merely super&eial.

that specie• of Astrology which, being least abatruse, gave them
the least trouble. Thia waa that which, with aome slight alter&·
t.ion, i1 meant in the present dar by Popular Astrology. It i1 a
heterogeneou jumble of the two grea& branchea of th.e 1cience, .
Genethliacal*, or that wherein the planets must be regarlled ·as ·.
causes of eventa, and Horaryt, or tha& wherein the plaaet• can
only be looked upon aa symbol• of ennts. The doctrine of es-
•ential dignities which we ahall by and bye shew can haTe no
·deet in natiYitiea, properly belongs to the latter branch; but be-
cauee it wae the fashion to adhere to it in both, it wu adhered
to, u ~.he custom of decr,ing Attrology 1Lltogether i1 now. And
aa no one called the fubion in questio11; but all the world fol-
lowed the miataken pa&h of tboae who had gone before, theae sa-
pient Doetor1 frequentlr found tbem11lns a& fault. Still ibeJ
pel'ienred, and sometime1, (aa witneA a011e part of Lilly'•
woru,) fell upon the truth. Tkia, though it aeld9111 oeclltftd at
all, wae on aome oecuions unf'aYOurable to the chvch. The
clergy, in their anger at the predictions of the downfal of the etl•
tablisbment, made war on Astrology in the persons of its ignorall\
professors, brought forward their frequent failure• u proofs -
of
their wiekedDeA, cried th- down, not YCfJ coasU.tentl,r, as
deaten mwitchcraft and with the devil, and procved lawa
through the bigotry of. a puritanieallegitlature, which tileneed
their Ylctima by immuring them in a dungeoa.
Por proof of these uaertiou, we refer to the liYetl ofLillJ, and
the leading Aetrologen of Ilia dar; when the state religion wu a
ball tossed from one party to another. And thua it was that,

at all timet are, the aeience of .A.Itrology came into 4iarepute;
ita profeuon no longer dared to apeak out in their predictiom,
and aa it wu euy to cloak igJlOI'IIIIce under the UDJDeaning hie•
rqciJPbiee &bat were then adopted, the Joienee fell altogether1ato

the degrading -pretenaiona that followed may etill be aeen in a
eenaia almanaek that hae become pronrbial for making predic·
tioae by hieroglyphiea, which may be made to tit _
to any interpre•
tatiOD, and by foretelling atmospherical changes, " more or leu,"
and " the day before and day after," &c. &c.
Ha'fing thua traeed aome of the circumatancea attending the
original enmity of tbe clergy to the praetiee ofutral prediction,
we will endeaYonr to show what waa the substance of their ob•
jcctioue; and iu ao doing it would be some excuse for them if the
interests of morality or revelatio11 were obyionely elfected by the
praetiee of Aetrology, or if they, the clef!y, could be auppoeed to

togr Is concluded to be inimical to the church ; whel'eai, tht!
truth is, 110t only does the stucb of it lead to the admiration of
the God of nature, but the praetice ofit necesaarily leads to the
admiration of that God. It i1 true that the Astrologer llelieyes
that good and evil are produced by the planets, but not aa li.rat-
cauaes, not as rational beings, not aa intelligent mu1es of mal·
ter,.uor rood and evil genii, who1e delight it is to play with the
. teelings of us poor mortals-Do I but as mean• only, whereby.the
great fint-canse, ,the all giW"iou• Deity, carrie.s hie adorable will
into efFect.
It has been justly said in objectioa to Astrology, that e'Jert
thing that occurs on earth occurs by the will of providence; this
i1 perfectly true; but the inference-that therefore the planets can
han nothing to do with it, is as perfectly false; the planets are
the means which are adopted to carry the will of providence into
never-failing efFect; and this is as easy of belief as that where
providence wills that we should have rain, the agency of a cloud
and the Sun's rays, are made use of to eft'ect that which it ~Is.
The common plaee objections arising from the friends of reli-
gion, are such as these :-Is it not wicked to attempt to look into
faturitJ t Ia it not impioua and presumptuoas to usurp the privl•
lege oftbe Almighty? Are not the secrets of fate hidfrom mor-
&al eyes, because to bow them, would make men atill more wick-
ed than they are, seeing that they would put olf the work of re-
pentance until their latter end approaehed1 There are other
objection• that we have heard, such as, " The idea of coming
misfortune• would make men miserable, &c.;" but aa the.e do
not properly belong to this bead, we shall confine4uraelves to a
rep!J to the above questions.

1fblcb it i• done. If Aman pry into the secret rellllt of anr
matter, with Aview to benefit himself b7 injuring his neighbour,
there ~an be no doubt the act is ainful, because the motive which
gue birth to it is so ; and, on the other band, if the motive it
good, tllen the act will be praiseworthy; but the mere act
· itself, if unaccompanied by AnJ motive, is certainly, when ab-
ab'ac&edly eonaidered, perfectly iadif'erent, and therefore assu-
red!J not wieked. It CAll on)J be aaid to be wicked nuder the
no&ion that it is forbidden br the Scriptures; but this ~ not the
eaaeu regards Aatrologr. The Scripture• certainly forbid the
baring recourse to witche• and such as deal in charms, &c. but
we do not think this applies to the act of lookil'lg into futuritJ; it
rather means to aToid the belief, 10 derogatory to the power and
goodne11 of the Almightr, of such abominations as that of the
de•il having an in8uence onr the life and health of human
being~, through the agency of these ereaturea: a belief atill
coJIIIDOD among eastern nationt, aud. we blush to write, not
whoUr eradicated in our own, u aome late trials han evinced.
Bat thia baa nothing at all to do with Astrologr; which, if we
were called oa to define It, we should eay is, a 1cience vAicA
tiiiCM1 to foretell et>mll 63 tAe poriliom of tl&~ /&eaeenl3 6odic1.
Now, there is nothing incoll8ittent with morality in thie; and
certainJr the Script11ree do DQt forbid it, either direedr or b7 ana-
log. The meau, we UJ, are .n9t immoral; that the end it not,
we shall hereafter make eTident. It is not the meana then that
can be abewn to be wicked, i.e. tbe7 are not spoken againat in
Scripture, and ther are notprr '' immoral, inasmuch as a stud7 of
the beann)J bodies, their aatare, and their motions, tends to &he
glorr of ~heir Creator, rather than otherwise; and thu1 ban we

I wou~n erect a 'f'ilure of the Heenns for Saturday, Aqua
the 28th, 18lMo, at Dhours, SO minutes, A.M. that is, half-past
nine o'clock in the morning. To do this I refer to the lint co-

opjlosite the 28th day of the month, in the second column, which
has 0'slongitude printed at the top, I lind IS, 4., 43, with the
aiJn Virgo prefixed at the side of the &rat row of 6gures~ Thi•
i11dicatea that the Sun. at 12 o'clock that dq, is in IS degrees, 4

less than thirty, may be rejected .without any ~aterial error;
and wher. more than thirty, may have as many'minutes added to
the~!' as wiiJ make them up sixty, or a degree. We therefore
turn to the Table of Houses, and in 'the page •ntitled &I ia
V-irgo, 1'e look for the column that has the sign Virgo at the top,
which is the third; we seek for 6 degtees, and in the column of

down exactly as tbey are foun!l in :the Ephemeris and Table of

SO minutes before 12 o'clock, we ·m.st add this time, reckolling
from Noon the preceding day, to· tile above 10 hours. 27 min.,.
and upon these two sums being lidded together, making above

Sm,
OasnvrNo ~ curious remark in the Correspondence of the
last Number of the " Straggler," and being distrustful of my
own knowledge, I treapau on your kindneas for the reJIIDval of
my doubts. In answer'to a Correspondent, the " Straggler" re-
plies, "the Ascendant is the true layleg in that geniture; the
Sun having passed thc,middle of the lith House, by the space \
of three muudane degreeR, which incapacitates that Planei. from
the office of prorogatJ>r." Now for my own part; I always eon-
sidered this was the very thing which entitled the Sun to that
.. .
otllee. Waiting your answer,
I remain your obedient Senant,
P. MELANCTHON.

TO CORRESPONDENTS.
We beg leave to.inform our Readers that we are promieed
the Nativity of the late John Thurtell, which we have no doubt
will be highly inh•resting to them.
"P. tMelandhon" is perfectly right, and the "Straggler..
completely wrong. We would advise the latter to consult the
new tranalation of' Plaeidus, and be will there lind a few thinga
of which he ia at prCJJent totally ignorant.
The Quei'J of" Ptolemy, Jun." will be attended to in a future
Number. ·
"A Constant Subscriber'/ and " Q. L." -are rrceind, but tOIP'
late for this Number; they may depend upon our earlieat atten-
tion.

justify me·in passing my opinion, I should say that mundane con- ·
figurationS have at least equal if not greater power than zodiacili; ·
and as to the semiquartile or allpect of 450, and the iesquiquad-:
rate of tslio, a very able artist, Mr. John Harris, who left England.
for America in 1799, and has left but few in this·country to eqttal'
him,- assured me repeatedly, that in thirty years lie.fOund tllem ·
nearly as powerful as the.quartiie, particularly·the sesquiquadrate, ·

However,·l shall not insist upon their efficacy to this extent; but'

TO CORRESPONDENTS.
We feel extremely obliged to our correspondent "Nebilis" for
the life of PARTIUDG&, which we will insen when we give the
Ponrait.
We beg to inform Ajax, that the error in tbe Astronomical
Tables of which he complains in the~ Number, viz., that they
cannot be taken out without detriment to tbe work, arose from
inattention to our corrections : th~, with the numerous errors in
the last number, hne caused us to make a different arrange-
ment in the printing department 1 therefore our readers may
rely on such mistakes not happening in future. Ajax·is informed
that Mr.£. does not write for our work;. therefore w~.can say no-
thing of Iris abilities: as to his remarks on Wilson's .Dictionary,
we cannot agree with him in opinion.
H T. is received, and will appear in our next.
We beg to inform T. J. that a meeting of the Lon_t~Ma A.8trol~J4
gical Society will take place on Wednesday the ~th day ofOctober
next; particulars ofwhich he or any m~ber o( the ~oeiety may
team by application at our publishers, by addressing a note.

PARTRIDGE'S OPUS :REFORMA'I1JM.
[ Continued from page 99. ]
EXTRACI' V.
~uT the main dl.rection that Mr.' John lays all the su.s of the
maner upon, is tlte uoeadant w\be. aqua111 ofMan in the IOdiac:.
wbicb is (w ., the tna&b) ao clirecUoll at all; fOr y.ou may as
well direct the-ascendant to th4 antifcion of any planet, as to an
aspect in the zodiac, they beiug both impciiSible to be clone br
any one, John excepted. But auppoe it ..-e allowable, and
that there was such a direction in nature, as he tbere tells U8 there
is, yet that direc:tioo could not kill 1 for if he pleasetll -but to read
Ptolemy, lib. iii, cap. 15, Quadripartite, he ther~t tells us, That
ifthe raysoCJupiter or Veoua fall wi&bin elpt or urel•e dqr-
after a malefic direction, that direction cannot kill. Now in tb8
~. here is but one malefic direction to the --.at, and that
is the square ofMars,.which iuuc:c:eeded by the asc.adant to the
se:atile of the Sun, the body ofJupiter, eatile of the Moon, and
aextile of Mercury, and tbey all neul1- Ia MpeCt to J uplter, ancl
for that ~ partakers of his nature In a great measure ; t\Jei.r.
fore, how this body ofdirections should (contrary to aU good and
authentic rules) kilt, seems to me a mystery 1 and what is more.
that be sh~ die ofsw:h a dileue as an inte,mitting mec. or
poison ; lof it is not Mara, but the Sun aDd Jupiter, that d(l speci·
6cate the ._,.; and bow they two should kUl, but elf~Y
afte~, that manner, I hope mJ friead John will explain in bis
twenty yean promised body of tautal6cY, when he thinks con••·
nient to print it' and also in that book to give us full dire~~tion for

lr'e ha\h not mentioned it• nor do.we uo~rstand it,which is wone.
Bat teeinr Astroloo is allowtlll aod <1wn.ed" by ~<~me of - ~~tost
learned, to be a bundle of experieace lmproftd into rul" by con•
tinned obsern.tiona of those aec:idents and efiieets ~t did always
attend difFerent directions and positiont, hence it the!\ (llilows,
tbu.likecauaes mut alway& have like ~ ~else ru\~ qf ex-
ception laid down to know when they shall and when they .tlall
oot, cive those common efl'ectl t~t they aU tell us of: for if the
Ascendaflt, Sun or ~oon to tile body, Sq~re or Oppositioa of
Saturo or Man, aball kill in two or tlaree Qliea, and miu in ten or
twehe, it Jeans Astroloo an iclle, foolish, and reproacbfuhtudr,
bWig uqeertsin an4 vain, aQd therefore not lio be $t~ied or d•
feoded by any but men of a reputation equal to itlelf: for if the
Asceodant to the square oflyfa~ in this pretended nativity oftbe
Lord Protector, should kill when tho body of Jupiter, Smile of
the Sun and Moon, &c. are so near, then I do affirm that nothing
caahinder i1 ~any time, ~tit al.,.ays must c~inly kill; which
if true, tben pray ollse"e what folJo'tfs, taken out of that learned

112 . THE SPIRIT OF PARTRIDGE; OR, .
t ::In the Nativities of Ann, Queen of Hungary, page 28, Lewis
XIII, King of France, page St., and Charles GustaTus, King of
Sweden, · p. 55, he lets these three outlive the Ascendant to the
body of Mars, which U"ndoubtedly must be more·violent than the
square1 and in two of the three it eame up young.
In the ease of Frederick, King of Denmark, page ST_
, it did not
kill, though it fell near the Lion's heart.
S. ·In the Nativity of the Earl of Essex, page 45, we have a most
admirable instance 1 for there, the Ascendant to the squares of the
Sun; the Moon, and Mars, altogether, bad not power norstrength
enough to kill, and yet no assiStance from Jupiter and Venus to
help or save : w~en you see in the last of Cromwell, that the singl.e
square of Mars did ·the businesP, though the body of Jupiter, ·&c.
were very near to the place. This is Brick-court Astrology with a
witness! Ri.fu111 tet~eam.
4. In the case of Casimir, King of Poland, page 46, it _
did like-
wise fail, though Mars was there .among the Pleiades, and for that
reason more violent.
5. In the Nativity of Charles Tortenson, the great Swedish Ge-
neral, page 48, where Mars is in conjunction with the Sun, Lord
of tile Eighth, yet this worthy gentleman lets him outli•e the As-
cendant to the Square of Saturn, bodies ofMa':' ·and the Sun, anti
sends him to the other world on the Ascendant to the Opposition
of Saturn. In this Nati•ity, honest John bath shown as much of
his ignorance (as to the rules of Astrology) as in any one·ca!•e
throughout the whole book besides ; for here he gives the Ateend.
ant the power of bileg, and yet both the Sun and the Moon are in
aphet.ical places, the one in the first and the other in the seventh.
&. In the Nati<rity ofthe Duchess ofSfortia, page M, thesquare
of Mars did not kill, but the Ascendant to the Opposition of the

:\loon, and the Sun to the Square of Venus did, and yet neither.of
1!wn givers of life_
; neither «lid the Ascendant to the Square of
Mars kill in th~ Nativity of Don John of Austria, page 65.
7. In the Nativity of George Duke of Albemarle, page 70,
neither the Square of Saturn or Mars. to the Ascendant could !till
him, and yet Mars lord of the eighth ho~.
8. In the case of Pope Paul V, the Ascendant to the Square of
Mars did not kill, and yet the Opposition ofMen:ury out olthe
eir;hth hou,;e fell near the same place.
9. In the case of Pope Gregory XV, page 81, the Horoscope to
the Square of Mars did not kill, and yet that angle is giver of.life;
but \be Square of Mercury did it to the purpose a littlewhile after.
I suppose Mars was popishly inclined at that time, and therefore
weuld not burt his ghostly father;. but Mercury appeared to be a
do•mright heretick, and had no respect either to his age or infal-
libility.
10. In the Nativity of Cardinal Peter Bembus, page 85, the
.arne aspect did not kill, and yet Mar,~ lord of the eighth. I really
judge that be was a papist i~ those times; what think you, John,
was.he or no? You are the better judge of the two, because you are
of that persuasion.
11. In tb«; case of Mr. Thos. Gataker, page 102, the Square of
Mars and Opposition of the Su!l out of the eighth would not do,
but the Opposition of Saturn did it iherward~.
12. In the Nativity of Judge Reeves, page 121, the Square of
Man~, Opposition ofthe Moon, and body of Saturn, could not kill;
but after that something else did it.
13. In tbe·caseofDr. Richard Saford, page l33,he outlived the
A5eendant to the Square of Mars and the Sun, both which aspects
fell near the Lion's heart.

t•. In the geniture of Mr. Ste;bell Rogers, page ls&, &he As- .
ceodant wu direc:ted to &he Sqnarc ofMan, ed yet that could.not
kill him, although the Square of the Moon gan her uslstece.

Alcenclant to the .Square of Man, and diven yeus after wthe
Square of Satum aad the Moon, and lived ma11y years after-

16. In the case of Dr. Geotf&ry le Neve, p~e 118, he llktnrite'
outllnd the Ascendant to the SquareofMars, tllld to ~e·Square of
Saturn after that also.
' 11. In the Nativity of Mr. John Booker, page 187, you d
tJme find that he outlived the Ascendant to the Square of Mal'l,
Square of the Sun, Square of the Moon, and Square of Mercul}',
aodliftd maoy years afterwards.
18. In the geniture of Mr. William Leyboum, page 187, you
wlll also find that he outlived the Ascendanuo the Square of ¥•111
and Mercury, and yet these fell neudle cusp of tbe fourth ho.ee,
ao4 ia CIUIICIII' likewiscl ; as It did in that 6&ure honest Jobn pve

TO THE EDITOR OF THE "SPIRIT OF PARTRIDGE."
Sn,
I R&SPECTFULLY beg leave to offer ybu my thanks for
undertaking to publish, by extracts, the Works of Partri~ge•
.litid you have begun with his " Opu>." You, of COiu•c, are
aware that Partridge, in the above work, very often refers to many
of the nativities .in Gadbury's Collection, supposing that hi•
readers were in possession of that work. But in .our time, a; but
very few students can be supposed to have Gadbury'• work•,
allow me most humbly but· earnestly to suggest the propriety of ·
your giving eony Figure from Gadbury, with the judgment of
Partridge under it.
Also allow me, by means of your work, to ask the proficient<
in astrolugy a few questions ·on the nativity of a young i.ndy
NoW uvJNG, who was,born January 25th, 180i, 7 h. S9 m. P.M.
latitude 530 north. The time of birth may be relied upon.
Qve•tion 1. When will the native marry '
2. Describe the husband.
~. Will ber husband be possessed of property, or not '·
4-. Name the giver of life, and state the time when death may ·
be expected.
I am, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,

[Continued from page 107.J
Jupiter in the ttDeltJe 8igm.
Jurnaa in Aries represent.~ a middle-statured person, ratber
le&G, ofa ruddy c:Qmpleli.ion,.the visa&e onl, the hair Jla)!:en, the
eye quick and piercing, a high note, the face subject to pimpk~,
ofa noble and generC>Oa.dU.position, moa~ obliplg and cour~.ous.
Jupiter in Taurtlji forms a middle-statured penon, but well set,.
compact, though not handsome 1 the .c:omple~ion dark, the hair
brown and curl~g, but of a reuonably .,good d~position, of sound
judgment and.amiabl~ manners, generous and compassionate.
Jupiter ln,Gem~ represents a well t:Om',osed body, above the
middle stature, sanguine complexion, the ~ir brown, the eye full
and engaging, the manner graceful and obliging, afFable and c:our-
teou•, a gre&J. admirer of the sex, and a lover o( science; bu\
when ncar any of the violent fixed st~~rs in Gemini, the person
will be raab and unstable. .

Jupiter in Cancer gives a middle stature, the complexion pallid,
sickly, and unhealthful, the face oval0 the hair dark brown, very
conceited and loquac:ious.
Jupiter iD Leo forms a strong and well proportioned body, tall,
the hair light brown or yellow, the c:om.plexion sangui!le, and tbe
eye full and commanding 1 the penoq is rather comely, noble,
courageous, and magnanimous, a master o( all martial exel'\.'iseol,

.J~piter ba Virgo repreeeRts a per10n of reasonallly fuU stature,
hair blac:k 01' dark brown, the complexion ruddy but not clear,
rather bancl&ome, choleric, ambitioul, boutful, ae4 stadlou., but
co.etous aM rub, and subject to 1- tllroqb estreme preci-
pitance.
I upiter in Libn gives a complete symmetry in Conn and stature,
rJU!er tall.&lld slender. the countenance in'l'iting, the eye run, the
bair light brown, the complexion clear but subject to pimples,
mild disposition. and enpcln! manners.
Jup~ in Scorpio rep,_tt a penon of middle ·stature, com-
pact body, dark hair, flelhy faee anti obecure complexion, lofty,
anotant, and ambitious, resolute aod contour, close, eecret, pro-
fbund, lind robtle, and to be treated with great caution.
Jup\teT in Sag(ttarius gives a tall, upricht stature, the hair of a
thesnut colour, the ~ompledon ruddy, the face oval, a.nd &be eye

ment, conspicuous for justice and falmUs In \h~r d~mgr, and
highly entided to respect; groat lovers~ hones, aud ·wen accom-
pl~ed in equestrian exercises;
Jupiter in ·capricorn forms penons of a mean ltatare, pale,
sickly compleXion and lean fifce, small bead, dark balr, ver,
weakly and infirm, prone to peerishness and despondency, nat
acti~ely dis~, yet ingenious· but unfortunate, helple~t~, .,U
atoel'&tly in necessitous circumstances.

rather corpulent, the complexion dear, the hair dark brown, of •
cbearful and obliging dispoaitioo, injurious &o none, jotC and
merciful, iodustdolll yet food of rec~~lt1Jt chWIJ ooltdiose

Jupiter ia Pisces forms mi<ldle·statured persons, but of fleshy
body, obl;cure complexion, lightisb browa hair, atudious aud pos-
~~iJJg enellent ta,lcnu•, and graced with very creditable acquire-
ments, fortunate upon the water, delighting in good fellowship

MARS.
Mar~ is one of the unfortun~te or malefic plaJ!C~ aod is ca\ll!d
the less infortune, in contradistinction to S<lturn, who is termed
the greater l but hi~ influence, although evil, is very differen_t in
its nat~re from that of Saturn The natives of Saturn are sloth-
_ful, inactive, and oppressed by poverty; while thoae of. Mars are.
active, furious, and contentious: they are continually engaged in
mifeand violence, and, if Mars should be evilly_configurated to
,l\lercury, very dwbonest. Such persons are remlll'kable for great
~.cuteness of perception, although perhaps posses,ing more rash-
ness than solid judgtpcnt. If in good aspect to the 111minaries and
Mercury, Mars gives great courage, much dexterity in manual
operations, great power of calculation, and a brilliant wit;· if in
evil aspect, dissim~lation, treachery,obstinacy,and revenge. The
native is audacious, rude, and ungovernable, unrestrained by any
princij!le of morality or_ religion, delighting in w.ar, rapine, and
bloodshed. When the hyleg is directed to Mars, be produces
*.We must again remincl our readers that the abilities and dis-
·JJOsition of every nati« are.deducible from the M09n and Mer-
:cury: in.borary question1it is otherwile; the person'• disposition
is there judged of from the lord of the ascendant : these des~:rip­
tions are, therefore, solely applicable to horary questions.

In horary questions 1\Iars is a masculine nocturn 1l planet,
choleric and fiery: he governs Aries by day, and Scorpio by n!ght,
and is the sole ruler of the watery triplicity,
He is exalted in Capricorn, and has his fall in Canoer, and hi<
detriment in Libra and Tauru>.
· He describes one of a middle sta_
ture, strong·well-set body, rath.-r
mu~cular than corpulent, the face round, the eyes hazel, sharp
ilnd piercing, dark reddish compleltion, the hair sometimes red,
>andy0 ot· tbxen, not unfrequently a scar in the face; the counte·
nl\nce full of confidence an•t boldness, and the disposition active
and inu·el'id.
If Mar,; is well dignified he makes men courageous, hazarding
their lives for any cause, or for uone, regarding death as preferable
to a life of slavery or submission, generous and magnanimou~, ·
o:onq uering almost every opponent, and rushing into broils and
cnnt.-st as a most laudable amusement.
If ill dignified, the person so de.crib,ed is crucl and maliciou~
"llgerly seeking every opportunity of wickedness or mi.~ehief, with-
out pity or humanity, fear of God or regard for man.

TO THE EDITOR.
Su,
1 oassaV& the Straggler, in his 16th Number, has
endeavoured to clear himself of the palpable blunder committed
by him in the 14th. In answer to some Correspondent, who
dOe& not seem to take all the Straggler's auertions for gospel, the
latter says " he will find the Sun three mundane degrees beyond
the middle of the 11th house; i.e. nearer the cusp of the 12th,
by which he is certainly incapacitated froin beillg hyleg." This,
in my ftumble opinion, is a sort of an tutrologicol bull ; for he
mightjustaa well have endeavoured to persuade us that the Sun
had paued the meridian before twelve o'clock, as to persuade us
that the Sun had passed the middle olthe 11th before he. came to
that part.
As the above may be the means of preventing some young
students from being led astray, your insertion will oblige,
Yours, respectfully,

•ITIIOLOCE&'S POCJI:B'l' COMPAIIIO!f.
OBSERVATIONS ON THE MOON'S APPLICATION AND
SEPARATION FROM THE DIFFERENT PLANETS.
[ Continued from page 101.)
IF the Moon separate from Jupiter, and apply to Mars in a
tK'::tur~al geniture and be increasing, it denotes magistrates, men in
great power, but holding their power in creat care and danp, and
not witboutsickness.
The Moon separating from Jupiter and applying to the Sun,
destroys all the patrimony offather and mother, the natite to lite
fJOm his parents, exiles, fugitites, slaves, captives, especially if the
Moon be in the house of Saturn or Man.
If the Moon increasing or at full" separate from Jupiter anti
apply to Venus, it signifies noble, potent, powerful persons, but
to live from their own house, soon to want their parents, but
nevertheless it signifies happinesa in the latter part of their age;
honest, grateful, CJ)urteous persons, and much happiness & to pin
by their wives.
If the Moon separate from Jupiier and .apply to Saturn, and be
increasing or at full, it aignifies the native to be adopted by a stran-
get; tutors and teachers of children, to be employed in moist
watery places, sailors, pilgrims & but if the Moon be decreasing, it
• This of course is inteaded to apply only to the aspects, but
by no ~ns 10 the ~n;unc:tioa, as Venos can never be more th!'n
'8 degrelll f'ro18 the_SuD.
,,,,- ,b,Google
128 THE •SPIRI'f OP PARTRIDGE; 0111
signifies servitude, misfortune, captivity, continual sickness, and
mi~ery, and, ifit be a nocturnal geuiture, a violent death.
If the Moon separate from Jupiter and apply to Mercury, she
signifies judges, collectors of money, interpreters of the law, reli-
gious persons,and in all things happy.
If the Moon separate from M.m and apply to tbe Sun, it signi-
fies very great evilR, misfortunes, shortness of life, imbecility, and
violent death, and to die in a strange country.
The Moon separating from Mars and applying to Venu~ at full
ur incceasing, denotes adulterous, libidinous, lecherous persons,
lo1ing and coveting libidinous and venereous acts, and thereby
often involving themselv~ in danger; it signifies je.J'ellers,
painter:~, and perfumers, commonly dealers in metals, and some-
tim~.., according to the nature of the sicn, vintners, inn-keepers,
victualler.~: ifthe Moon be decreasing in light, it Jigni6es fortunate,
happy peroons, solicitous about womeri, and getting wealth by
them ; gaining by their wiv.es estaie and credit, but sometime.
~uffering disgrace by venereous ·acts, always addicted to promts-
,;uou> lusts. ·
The fulll\foon separating from Mars and applying to Mercury
in a nocturnal geniture, signifies great persons mgreat public
authority, but wicked anti malicious, always coveting to do wick-

If the Moon separate from Mars and apply to Jupiter, it signifies
powerful, rich, fortunate persons·:· hut ifahe·he 4eC:reaiing in.Illfht,
it affticts the native with.sei:ret hidden vices, and frequent ihik- .
ness.
The Moon in a diurnal &eniiure separating fiom the SUn and
applying to Venus, signifie& barrenness, hinders ·marriage and
children, denotes preposterous loves, filthy unclean lusts, and per-
sons addicted to servile studies, and occupied in: servile actions,
subsisting and mamtaining themselves by their own endeavours,
and in process of time living happily : but in a·nati'l'ity by night,
it signifies the native to have many wives, to be grateful, accept•
able, well-beloved, living'in creait, and getting a gMat estat'e.
The Moon separating from·the Sun and applying to'Mercury in
a diurnal geniture, signifies the native to be full ofdanger in all his
rue and actions, of evil manners,"sacrilegious, denying the divinity:
In a nocturnal geniture, it signifies public notarieS, scriveners,
iOTentors of OCCUlt and secret wnting, Or unlawful (etters, findeN
out of secret things, whereby &ame pin an estate, if not hindered
by Saturn or Mars.
The Moon separating from the Sun in a·diurnal geniture and:
applying to Saturn, destroys an estate, and divides one from his
parents, and brings him to want and misery, but in process of
time gives an estate and happiness: but by night it signifies want,
aod destruction of the estate, much sickness, and afftiction. ·
The Moon separating from the Sun and applying to Jupiter by
day, signifies .a great estate, good fortune, al)d happiness beyond
measure : but in a nocturnal geniture, the natives get their estate
by their own industry, are subject to early travels, apt to be de-
ceived in their youth, but in age they live in good credit, and gain
a good estate,

ASTROLOGICAL ANECDOTE OF JOHN PICUS,
PRINCE OF MlRANDULA.
131
Jos• P1cus. Prince ~ Mirandula, commonly called
Picus Mirandula, it is well kno'lfn, wrote twelve boob apinst
astrology, so severe and well argued, that he obtained the name
of Flagellum Astrologorum : the story runs, that Lucius 'Bellan-
tius and others got the nati'fity of Picus, and foretold that he
would die in his thirty-third year, which provoking him, induced
him to undertake a most severe satire against astrologr ; but,
dying at the time pRdicted,.he admitted that by his own death
be had disproved all he had written. Tills should be sufficient
to satilify all doubts in unprejudiced minds. To prove the truth
of the above, we rerer our readers to Partridge's AImanacle for'
1700•, where the nativity is fully explained.

trine of Mercury, Sun to the trine of Jupiter converse, and the
Moon to the sextile of Jupiter converse; yet, as Jupiter is aftlict-
ed by the zodiacal square of Herschel, who,is in the lOth, nearly
in mundane parallel with Saturn, we must say that the native's
affairs will require attention: but to give a correct and minute
account of these 111atters would take up more space and time than
we are able to give to printe individuals, however willing. tb
oblige.
Our Kingsland Road communication is received, and will be at.
tended to in a future Number.
As we have given a Table of Houses in this Number, we are,
of course, obliged to omit the Astronomical Tables, which will
re-commence with 1781 in the next. The Figure which we gave
as an example was erected from a table which had the minutes as
well as the degrees on the cusps of the cadent and succedent
houses : these are omitted in the presen.t Tables, as tbis degree of
accuracy is only necessary for the angles. We thought it proper
to mention this, as the omission micht confuse the young student.
We have sent a Note to A. B., Wes~inster, which, no doubt,
he bas received.
It is our intention to give a beautiful PoRTRAIT of PARTRIDGa,
from an original by Robert White. · We shall shortly give a large
Diagram (copper·plate engraving), which will represent the whole
of the aspects in miniature, the 'time of the Sun's entering the
signs, and the etsential dignities of the planets.

TO THE EDO'OR. ··,
' '\
SIR,
I AM induced t~ give publicity to this Nativity, .-
a ciemonstrable proof·of the verity of iastral influence. It is the
nativity ofa female child, whose parents resided in the same lloute .
. '
with ine ' and knowing that I made astrology my ·chief am_. ··
ment (for I can a•ure you that it is'not for the·sake Of any pecu-
niary advantage tha.t induces me to apply a rev;spare boun to its -· "
stu.dy', but mer,llly for my own am·us~ment), the mother would
let me have no pea~:e .linti! I bad cast tbe.,child's nativity, in onler
to llltow wh.etber her daughter would live to years of mat~\y, or
whether she would be fortunate or unfortliilate through' life:
accordingly I erected the preceding diagram, The time I &lelie•e
to be correct, as it was 'fery carefully noted and, gi•en to me soon
after birth. The .Sqn, without dC?u!Jt, .iS hyleg, and to him we
must look for the tbne of death, which will surely happen when
h~( arrives to the quartile of Man, which be does in about six -,.
yean from the time of birtll, followed by a train of evil directiOJll
1fbtch it will be impostible for tlu! native to survive. And it iS ~
astonishing fact, that I bacl, not seen :llllY one belonging 110 die
family for a length of tilDe, wb~ I .aCcutentally met t~"-'m~tber
a short time since, ,.-ho, with heart-felt grief, a~uaiq&ed me that
her daughter w~ no more ; but that she died at~commence-
ment of the p~erit year, anll thus verified t~: truth of my vre-
diction. What is here stated is a fact, and..llllf be depended .upon
as truth, which I am ~ways determined to abide by, and s~l
not attempt tojustifJ or defend astrology any farther than 1 find ,
it .~.~~~~ l<l.f~.and.truth, accor4iuc to~~ i".

IF the Moon separa·te from Venus and apply to Jupiter, it lig.·

The Moon &eparating from Venus and applying to Man~ in·a

imprisonment, or a sudden death, by reason of the .Ion of some'
one : butif in a noct~rnal ge~iture the Mpan so apply to Man, it.

If the Moon be transferred from Venus to the Sun, it separates ~
the native from his parents by some bitter falling out, whereby he
i< c:.ruelly burdened with want, full of troubles, but unchaste and
miserable, atBicted with love, but, after youth is past, in proceu of
time he inc:reaseth his estate, and easily attains his d~ires.

Mercury and apply to Saturn, it denotes deafne~~, stamm-rs, 0~

watermen, or men employed about the water J but if .;,alevoleot
stars atBict them, it denotes imprisonment and lllf~mane to the
native.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE NATURE OF THE

(Continued from pa.ge 149.] ·
OF·THE SUN.
'THa Sun is'the·centte of our system, although supposed by
Ptolemy and olhers to revolve round 'the Earth. ·This opinion of
Ptolemy, although astronomieany incorrect, does not in the slight-
est degree alfecii his system of astrology ; for the stars act upon the
Earth according to their ·apparent or ec-oeenti'ic~ position, withoiu'
any regard to their true or heliocentric places. The Sun is of a·
llot·an•l·dry nature, theugh inferior in· this 'respeet tO' Man: he
has lit·tle specific influence of his ·own, though when ill Mjaafe or
opp~ition to the'Moon; the native is rash, ha•ty, and -yiofent, and.
~eems ofa decidedly martial nature. The Suft possesses the pecu-,
liar poWer of destroying the natilte ofany plaQ_et with which he
may happen to be in· conjtinction, and imbibing its qualities him-

gn-atet' afftlttion than the latter.· It seems uiy· ri.tlculoiM to sup-
pose that 'this efFect is limited to precllely SO liO': there can· be ito
doubt·that every planet gradilally toiles its power as it apProaches
the Sun~ and slowly regains it as it &ep;irates from him. When·

the Sun is allicted by the malefics he assumes their nature, and,

THE ASTROLOGICAL E~CUSE.

See, fair one, humbled, sorrowful, and sad,
Perplexed, distre ,.. d, and very .mudJ ashamed
Of past misconduct, which I own was bad,
Icome I!) vow that wbt 1 said disclaim'd:
Believe me, I have been extremely ml!.d,
My worse than leaden dulness so misnamed
An elegant, refined, and beauteOus da!!)e :
0 pon my life, the Planets were to blame.

Eemt of wit, good seme and humour,all
That I can, after so much mischief,po, •
It to.explain how enry nasty ball
Had intermix'd its rays, until the crew
Were all to friendship most inimical;
And then I'll leave the judgment, fair, .to you.
Indeed, I was a dunce at such a time
To •isit :-but that I always am is-rhy{lle,
Ill.
!fhat sly old Sattma (mischief making rlog !)
Affiicted Sol and Mercury by square ;
Oppos'd the Moon, too; thus a double clot
He plac'd upon my wits, and yout I dare
To say, will call to mind a clumsy log
Tied to a jaded horse or wom-out mare;

And sm~e (I hope you'll pity tOQ) that thus,
What hitherto bad bobbled, went still wollie !

But this is·little ; Venus squared by Mar6
And J"piler! t.he latter ever causes fooling,
And the former disagreement, quarrels, wars
wtth ladies, e'en in heaven. At my schooliqa:
I was often much surpris'd, and blest my st.:m
To think great Jove, who i:; so fon<l of rulinr;,
My ma:;ter like, permitted them to quarrel;
:But then I did not understand the moral.
V.
'Tis on such days as yesterday, are hatched
ill nature, bickering, and ra~,~, and strife ;
Then quarrel fir~t a couple newly match'd,
The vulgar husband then first beats hig wife,
A11d first then feels. the sweets of being scra.
tch'd;
Then the rash murderer first whets his knif.,!
Gauntwickedne~s strides on throughout the land,
.AJ¥i treasons, thefts, and burglaries are plann'd.
VI.
Then, fair one, deign to pity and forgive;
Since mortals err from lack of calolljon, say .
Will you not smile and bid your suppliant live?
More cautious grown, he'll shun each evil ra_

TRANSITS.
A Tauan is the passing o( any planet over the body or aspect
ofany promittor or significator in a nativity. That transits have a
very great effect in nativities is well known to all who have paid
.uy attention to the subject; but that they have also at times un-
accountably failed, ia equally certain. This failure of tr:msits in
some cases, and their remarkable truth in others, I~ us to invest-
igate the cause of the inconsistenc1. All transits seemed to bave
their pro11er effect when made on or near the birth day, thus justi .
fyinf, in a great ~egree~ the opinion which the antients bad ot th""
revolutional figure, or the time of' the Sun's return to the same
place which he occup.ied in the radix : the re:l!'on now appear~d
plain 1 all astrological calculatiolls are made from the geocentric
positions of the P.lanets. We will take an example July 25, \824- :
ifwe place the Sun.in L~o, and the Eanh in Aquarius,_ Mars wilt
appear to ao obt.erver on the E;arth to be in t2" 21!' of.Libra, but
to a person placed on the Sun he will seem to be in SO 5S1 of Sa-
gittarius ; the first is called his g4!()1:4lltric, the last his heliocentric
position. On Sept: 9, 18!Z4o, according 19 common. calcl!lation,
Venus being the~ in 220 t2' of Libra, w.ould be said to tranoit the
place ofMars;_ th.\5 however we mainlain'is not the cue, tbe.Earth
ha'fiog moved f~m ller origina,t. position in Aquarius tQ Pisces ;
coosequendy -th41 bearinc.. <tf the ey_~ is totally altered,, the. geo·

,,,,. ,b,Google
- centric ~ition is not the same, and Venus, though ap..,-rently in
the same llegree of the zodiac, is not in reality near that point';
consequently the transit can hue no effect.
When Jupiter or Venus shall transit &be mid-heaven, ascendant,
or the places ef the luminaries, tbe8e days will be attended with
·suc:cQIIll, pro:rWed tbey are .at in etil aspect.to Satuin, Men, or

THE NATIVITY OF OLIVER CRO'MWELL, LORD·
PROTECTOR OF ENGLAND,
Fairly tnidfait1jidly handledacc(}Tdiftg to tlae true Principle#
of Astrology.
Taa time ofthis great man's Hrth, according aa he gave it hilil-
~lf>wuon St. Mark'• day, in the year U99,- mane, at.
Hulitlnsdon, whOM latitude is ill decreet and a few minutes J and
this Is the stimate·time gi•en.·
Now the maio point is, bow we must understand this short leD•
teoi:e, ,._ ••alt8J and it can, in my judgment,· ha•e" no oth-er
·meanillc·than •ery.early in· the morning, that iS, in th11 very top
of the morning, or suddenly after twelve, for so the words seem to
im;Grt; and indeed 1 can give it no other interpretation but this ;
for the word 1111mM must be taken ad•erbially, and derived from
tM- adjectin atullm"-', which, in that sense it is here spoken, sig-
nifi8 th.e •ery highest, extrearll, utmost, top, &c. of the morning,
though I confess the word morning takes in all the whole time
from twelve, or midnight, tilltweive at noon; but ifbe had been
born after sun-rising, I am very api to belie•e he would have used
another way of expressing,it, 85 ante ·meridinn, &c.; but if before
sun-rising, as indeed they all agr~e he was, then I can take it in
no other s~nse but thi~ that I have already gi•en,-the top o! the
morning;' and the time pitched upon is at about five minutci aftec
Qlle of the.olock; and to thaf time the planets' places, both iD
longitude and latitude, are calculated by the Caroline tables, as
followeth:

to which,!'riding thirty degrees, gives the oblique ucension of \he

TO THE EDITOR OF "THE SPIRIT OF PARTRIOOE."
~~-~ .. Iw .going over tJle calculations o_f the Planets'
1•laces :at the time of birth of the present King, as published in
" The Straggling AstroloKer," I found a tri8ing error of rou a
11£08&&1 A liD THill.& MINUT&I in the place ofthe planetHench~l,
•hich he says was In so 60' ofthesign <y', on the liLh oi Au11~st,
1~6ll 1 whereas, the true geocentric longitude oi that planet
was l!lO !>S' of the above sign. The mean loncitude, it will
be found~ was just fl(' 1~ 46' 5il', from which, if we deduct ·
the equation arising from the mean anomaly, together with thole
conections that are to be allowed for the disturbing forces of the·
other planets, we have.the longitude In the orbit, which, being re-
duced to the ecliptic, gives the true helio•:entric loncit~!de in
I00 52' 24.611 of the sign Arie&.
1 sball only obsene, Sir, that this error should be noticed by .
tbose persons (if, perchance, there be any such) w:ho place any
c0116dence in the Straggler's knowledge of practical ~tronomy,

To the Challenge given by Mr. James Watson to
Astrologers, in the Fifteenth Number of
" The Republican."
WE have observed in the fifteenth number Or lhe Re-
Jmblican, a letter to Mt·. R. Carlisle, signed, .TamesWatson,
in ¥.·hich #he latter Gentleman expr€sses a wish "that
•ome Astrologer would explain in plain language, divested
oftechnical terms. honestly explain by what means the
planet Mercury, for instance, operates upon the nervous
fluid of an infant through life to perform a noleJU voleru,
certain actions." He adds, "until some one can explain
this, sc,> as to be understood by persons of common sei!St',
Astrologers and their disciples muet excuse me, when l~~ay
tk'at I consider the soothsaying of Aatrology like the pro4 .
phecy of priests, to.be all a delusion, which tends to keep
the ignorant and credulous enslaved to knaves and impo~;­
tors;" he afso hopes "Mr. R. Carlile will SllY sometb1Df
towarda curing any of his friends of their hallucinations,
that may cbanee to believe in Astrology." This la~r
gentleman, with mo¥e modesty than his cot·reapondent, baa
omitted to say any tiJing ofa science which he does not un·
derstand, and hBII not confirmed the sentence ofMr. Jamea
Watson, which pronounces the art to be all a juggle, lUid
its prQ(essors impostors.
We will now proceed, as well as we can, to reply to his
- qaeatioo, and explain the principles or a acie~ce to a .mau,

who, by his own confession, is ignorant of its rudiments.
He first wishes to know why the planet Mercury operates
upon the nervous fluid of an infant at ita birth, t.o perform,
wolt111 "ole111, certain actions. It has·always been supposed
that Mercury and the other planets act upon us by attra~­
tiOD, though what way they communicate tbeir power to
Ill, still remains to be discovered by some future phylo·
sopher; that they do act UJlOn us is evident to every one
who bas studied Astrology, but the proving this fact to
those who have nol, Is attended with considerable diffi·
culty, and we might almost be justified in with-hotding an
explauation to those, who, either incapable oflearning it, or
too indolent to take the trouble, declare the art to be false,
or its students either knaves or fools.
Mr. Watson may ask wby the Moon attracts the w;..ter?
why the planets revolve round their common c·entre? why
ligbt is produced by the 'action of the ~uil? why the uni·
vene itself was created ? and· should phy1osophers fail in
giving a satisfactory answer to these unreasenable ques-
tions, he may consider, as be says, every science which he
is unable to comprehend, to be founded in error and knave·
ry; but his asssertions will have litlle weight with the
reasonable partofmankind. It is sufficient for Astr!>logers,
that they c~n prove whenever the Moon and Mercury are
a11licterl by the planets, Saturn and Mars, and not in aspect
witb·each other, unassisted by the benefics, the native will

OBSERVATIONS ON THE NATURE OF TH&
PLANETS.
(Continued from page 181.)
OF MERCURY.
MER.CUB.Y is the nearest pla1_1et to theSun yetdiscovered.
and though the least in magnitude ofthe old planets, is one
ofthe most important. ··
The abilities and disposition of every one depend upoll
~he condition ofMercdry ai1d the luminarie~. .
Whenever Mercury is in conjunction \vith Saturn, the
native is slow, dull, fearful, timorous, patient, pei7Jeveriug,
laborious, grave, and capable of great application to any
a~Jitary pursuit: if i~ }>ad aspect, he is nervous, ~tupid,
aordid, and very worthlellS: if in goOd aspect, the natl.ve
is aubtlc, prudent, anti careful of his own interest ; if Mer-
cury be in conjunction or good aspect with Jupiter, the
native is -generous, liberal, huiJlane, possessed of a good
capacity : if in bad aspect,it is sa!d he will be inclined to
view things through a false IJledium: when in conjunction
or bad aspect with Ma1.11, the ~ative is violent, t'uriou01,
blqod-thirsty, pa.siouate, and revengful ; poseellSed of
acuteness and discriiJlmation: without the assistanCe of
. .
gQOd aspects, a tbiet'and a 'dWiodler.

Tbe·cenjunction of the Sun destroys the mental abilities
of the native, he is shallow, saperficial, dt!vold ohound

busine$8, he will never make any progress in the higher
branches of science. As Mes·cury can never be more 2S0

·Sun, he seems to ca~ great and bound!e,;:e ambition ; ahd
if the iotber parfi ofthe tlgtire concur, he lriay rise to con-

ofpoetry, music and dancing: ifMars assist the configura-

In our opinion, a good aepect of Saturn to thil configu-
ration, will be of service, by rendering the native more
steady, and more persevering in any vur~uit: ifln conjl)nc-
tion or bad aspect. the native still Pc>sscsses great abilities;

EXTRAL'T IX.
Ofthe Nati11u Dueases, <5-c--Seeiog all people are sub-
ject to some distemper of bcdy or other, it will not be
an1i88 to say something on this point also. And before l
begin it, I will ask J. G. what disease, or diseases the
Protector had that were fixed, chronick and durable,
because he hath placed Satu1·n (in the nativity he hath
naade him) on the cusp of the seventh, a little to\Yards the
sixth house, in oppo1ition to Mar1on the cusp ofascendent,
the only two points iu the whole scheme to give broken
bones, dislocated joints, aud chrouick diseases; and yt.t I
do not remember that it was ever said he was subject to
either of them, (perhaps now and then a wound, tire ~t··
ahk mark ofa 1oldier) but a brave, lusty, jolly geutlemen,
as I myselfcan testify, having seen him some score timea.
And to this purpose, I will giv·e yon Ptolemy's own words
in the case, as you will find it, lib. 3, cap. 17, Do Luinnibu1
and morbi1 Corp_
orum. And he begins with these words
following, when he comes to inquire into the hurts and
diseaaes of the body. UnifJersaliS tJer.o TC!JIIla hac .est,

Rati& accidmt. Thus you seein the nativity that J. G. made
fot the Proteetor, ·this very rule of Ptolomy take11 place
positively; for th~re we find&turn upon the cusp of the
seventh, in direct opposition 1o Marl on the cusp ofthe
ascendant. And you sec ..11lso both tlu~ angles of the
horizon in that figure are afflicted, which, by Ptolomy'•
•·ule (which l suppose tlwy da1·e not .deny), ought to give
hurts and diseases to his body: but on the contrar,y, he
was a brave, bold, healthy, fortunate man; anti none more
free from wounds, hurts, or diseases of the body than him·
self: so that this is another strong argument to prove that
figure false, aud that the.figure maker did not krow any
thing ofthe matter he pretended to give the world an ac-
count of. And yet to add more, neither J. G. nor any
tnan e.lsc can show me a true nativity where the two in-
fortunes were in opposition from the tenth and fourth, or
tl~t aud seventh, and that native prove a fortunate man -·
or woman throughout their whole life, as did this gentle· ·
man. And so 1 come to consider the figure of his nativity,
(which I call the true one,) and to see what disease-or
injuriu to his body are predictable, according to the
doctrine and p1·indples ofthe forementioned author.
Both 'the angles of the talt and ·tDelt, are free fro~1 the
malcfick beams of Saturn and Ma1·1, &c.; and the sixth
bouse, which is his· l(!('UI anticeden1 is posseued 'by the
benign Jnpiter, and there is no ill ray cast to the cusp of
the first.and seventh bouses, _
but the square of Venu.1 (rom
the cusp of the fourth; and, besides, the Moon who is
lady of the seventh, is iD Seztile to Jt~pittl' in the aixtli

'
houllt', and the Sun in Se:rtUe to him also: whichpositioll
are oo ways likely to give any chronick disease r hurti,
and accidents of detriment to his body; neither indeed
had he any that was remarkable and vibible; and for those
that are not so, I think they are inconsiderable, especially,
if we consider all nu:n are subject to some little defects in
nature, which may be impediments, but not iliseases in
Ptolemy's Sense and Meaning; for in the chapter before ·
mentioned, he does thus dis~ingnish between hurtlt and ·
diseases. Differunt enim hiJ. e iltterse. Lrelio umP.l e011rumpit
memllrum aliquod, nee at/fitt postea Crucisattll l11tensionem:
morbtu vero, aut assidt.e, aut per lntcroella correptus
e:rcruciat.
But to consider what he might be subject to, let us con-
sider Mars ·and Saturn in opposition, and both in square to
Jt&piter ; th~se might give him· something of the gravel.in ·
the kidnies, with a heat in, or about those part~; he might
also be suuject to the head-acl1e, or some little disorder
there, coming from the .tomach and spleen ; for we find
both the Malefics in square to Jupiter in Cancer: anA
besides this, he might also he liable to some obstrnctions
oC his 1""9'• eithe1· by cnlds, ~c. but none of these con-
tinual, but accidental, and only happening upon .bad
directions, tran11its, retums, &c.

·T. H. is informed that we have no room, for bisfigure of

is, that from the position ofthe Moon, who isplacedin the

just past the trine ofVenus iu the fifth, clearly points out

ample that is well known 'to the World.
Observationa on Geo~ II1.'1 Nativity.
Mr. Cooper meutions• at the time his Majesty came to
the Crown; (which happmed Ociober ~IJ, i760, when tlee
ftiztive wat about tweftty-two yea1'1 and five moathl ofagr,
KMrly,) the Ascendant was directed -to the Sextile o( the
Suo, and on ·tl1e Sun to the Quintile of Mars, be '"1.•
crowned and married. This seems a strange sort af direc-
tions to do all tills business. We a1·e certain no A1trologer
that k110101 the real principl11 tJftAe 1cimce, will agree with
M1·. C. In the fint place, we ahall ohaerve that the A•ceu~­
ant ought not to be dired:ed to the Sun fQr advancement
and honor; nor should the Sun be directed in a male ge·
nitm·e for marriage, particularly as the Sun is in Zorliac3l
parallt'l 'With Saturn. Now, if you will know what did
all this good, for this Royal Native, we must say it \vas net
the directilllls Mr. Cooper mentions, but it was from the
dfect ofthe Ascendant being directed to the Biquintile ·or
the Moon in Mundo, (for if you obltlrtJe, the Moon ;, i"

herself, is neither fortunate no1· unfortunate, but tlte whol,

mlstable~ and pro,·iding only for the present tim~, ~arelea~
offuturity, timorous, prodigal, and easily affrighted, but
loving peace, oiesiring to live fne from the world, &c. It
iss:ud, that if the native be brought up to mechauical em-
ployment, he will be frequently hampering .with a variety
or different trades, .but pursuing none of them long toge-
ther.
If the Moon be unfortunate at the birth, the native will
then be slothful, indolent, and of no forecast; improvi•
dent, given to a drunken, disorderly, and beggarly life;
tlating labour, or any kind of bnsiness or employment.
\\~'hen oriental,she inclines more to corpulence; but when
accidental, rather Jean, awkward, and ill formed.

' this article, des~ribe the history of ttJe Occult Philosophy.
Agrippa composed this work in his younger days, and
•hewed it to the Abbot Trethemius, whose pupil_ he Iiad
bEt:n. Trethemius was charged with it as appears by the
letter which he wrote to him oil the 8th of April, 1810.
~ut he advised him to communicate only to those in whom
he could confide; however, several manuscript copies of
it were dispersed over Europe. It is not nece~ry to ob-
. acrve, that most of them were f>tulty, which never faihl to
happen in the like cases; and they were preparing to print
it from one oftfaese bad copies, which made the author re-
solve to publish it himself, with the additions.and altera-
tions'with which he had embellishedit, and it obtained
the approbation of the Doctors of Divinity, ami some other.
persons whom the Emperor's Cquncil appointed to exa-
JUine it.
After the death of Agri'ppa, a fourth book was added t0
it by another hand.
Jo. \Vicrus, de Magis, cap. 5, p11ge 108, says, "To these
'b.ooks may very justly be added, a w'ork lately publi»hcd .

and ascaibed to my late houored host and pt'eceptor
Henry Corn. Agrippa, who has been dead JDore than forty
yean, whence I conclude that it has been 11njustly ucribt:d
to his name, under the title of The Fourth Book of the
Occult Philosophy, which pretends likewise to be a key to
the three former books."
Agrippa likewi~e wrote a Commentary 071 th• Art~
Ra!f71tund"' Leittim, and a Di11ertati071 on the 01-iginal of
Bifl; wherein he teaches the.fall of our parents proceeded
from unchaste love. He held some uncommon opinions,
and never any Protestant spoke more forcibly agaiuHt the
impurlence of Legendaries than he did. He promised a
work against the Dominicans, which woul<t have pleased
many persons both within and without the Church of
Rome. See Agrippa Opea·a, T. page i, 1057, where he
aays, "In ·the Treatise I am composing of the vices and
erroneous opinions ofthe Dominicao1, in which I shall
expose to the whole World their vicious practicer., such ia

pretended miracles, kings and princes taken off willa
poison, cities and states betrayed, the people. sedul'cd,
heresies avowed, and the rest of the deeds ofthese heroes
and their enormous crimes.
Agrippe's three books of Ocault- Philosophy with the
fourth were translated into English, and printed in Lou-
don in the year 1651, but they arc now become scarce

'l'n death of the Earl of Pembroke was foretold by
Lady Davy, to happen on his birth day, in the year 1680;
as you may find in Rushworth's Collections, page 4-8, oi
Ule Second Part. When evening c:amer he cheerfully took

said, of an aploplectic fit, ~what y generally termed a
sudden death. He was seventy years of age. See the story
more at large in ltusbwortb. Doctor How mentions'
another anecdote, of a gentleman of the King's Arms i11
the Strand, who, having lost some effects, went to an
Astrologer to know where and bow he might rec<>ver them.
Tlte Astrologer gave him directions; seatch was lll8de,
and the goods reco•ered ; butat the same time told him, he

twent)l-fifth or twenty-sixth ,year of his age; for in rucns

years of age late: but in women, I count fifteen early, and
twenty-five late. And as to the description of his wife, I
aball take a method quite. opposite and contrary to the
common way in practice; and therefore I do say positively,
th4 the S11n and Jupiter are significotors of this gentle-
Dlnn'll wife, with a little mixture of Mercury, but that
concerns her intellect more than her ho<ly. These posi-
tions desc1·ibes her to be a woman well desrended, of a
middle stature, fleshy bodied, and when in years fat, b'er
hair b,rown, o1· father brigbtisb, a woman ofa high spirit. a
generous temper, a healthy constitution, ambitious, long-
Jived, aud one of much ingenuity and sense. ·
But if honest J. G.'s Figure were true, she should be one
of the worst humoured women in the world for p11~ioa
alltl pri~e ;, for they.<Jescribe the wife always by the seventh
house, and the planets therein placed, and there we sball
find Saturn in oppo»ition' to Mars, and square to Jupiter;

Ascendant in opposition to Mars, should give the native a

The directions here given by Mr. Cooper are much out

Square of Mercury is about 77Q 5', which, according tu
:Naibod's measure oftime, giTes 7S years and two mouth,;,
and by the Placidian measure 77 years. The arc of dirc.:-
tion of the Ascendant to the square ~Saturn is 79" ; by
N,ai~od's mcas~1·e. gives eighty years and two months

indeed upon some or All .ol these principles, men.do gene-
rally love and support, or differ and destroy oue auotbcr,
and therefore hi1judgment is founded upon reason.
In the radical ftgure :we ·find the Sun, Moon, and As-
cendant well befriended by the rays of the other Stare, but
tbe'Part or Fortune is iri parallel both to sat•lTA and.Mart, .

much above 17 degrees distant fa·om the S"n (ascending)

1'ti1itiun with Saturn; the Moon is it• ret~cption with Me~·­
r'"'!l• and all the •·eKt of the Planets in their own dignities,
exc!>pt the S11n. Hence it is reasonable to judge, that thia
l'ativl' should have both many friends, and many enemies;
and as the Part or Fortune is afflicted most of the four, HO I
judge the hatred of his enemies wa& real, and the cause or
it was, becauM or his profit and advantage he rc(:eived
with bis.power and hoooua·. BesideM, Venus is in Square
to the Ascendant, which might raise him some enemies
that did envy bim for the pleasure and case ofhis life, and

nonsensical, being quite void otreiuion, particularly where

.On tM Revolutwnal Figure ofhis late Majesty
GBO. lll.
[Conti~ued from page 242.]
Panrovsr.v to considering the . Revol11tional Figur4
before us, it may not be improper to oft'e"r a few remarks on
tbe,e Figures io general. A Revolutiooal Figure is erected
tGO 'J'UE Sl'lRIT or l'.lllUlDt1! i Ott, ..
for the time the Sun arriYell at the ~me point in' t11!
eliptic, which he occupied. at .birth. Many Astrolog1·n
bave been so airaple as to suppose that the "sign of the
11ixth house of the Uadix ascending in the fievolutiou, aud
the_ lord of tbe sixth pol!lited in the fourth, po..U:ndtr a
dangerous year to the life of the native;". whence the
~auger arises they have not told us, and perhaps they
would be exceedingly puzzled to assign any satisfactory
I'Cttson for such a conclusion; they have also made mauy
other equally acute .remarks, foumkd on the Esseuti<~l
Dignities of the Pla.!Jets.
Gadbu1·y remarkN, Ihat the lord of the Ascendant iu the
Radix in conjunction with the lord, if the eighth of t.he.
Hevolution iu the eighth, i~ very dangerous to the life of
the native. We should like to know if the Sun were lord
of the Ascendaat, aml hyleg in conjuuction witl1 Jupiter
l1>rd ofthe eighth, whether it portended illness; we should
have no objection ourselves to have sucb a Revolution.
'l'he fact is, no attention whatever need be paid to the
degree ascending, and we should not have given it.at the
prctent instance, had it not been to exemplify the method
of erecting a Revolutioual Fiiure, at th.e reque11t of a cor•
respondent. .
The tn1e reall&n ~at Dlflrty Astrelogen paid such attt'n·
tiou to the time ofthe Sun's retur• to his radical place, i»
this, they found whatever transits were made at that time
were vea·y powerful, and conl!Cqucntly produced remark•
ahle •Ueraticm& in the native"s.atfairs. TtJe cause of thi•
is expiaioerl in our article upon Transits (page 164) in con-
~ueuce or the Sun coming to his original pol!itior, the

~un adfances in the eliptic the geocentric poeition4 alter-;
and although a planet may appear to pass over the place
efanother, yet as the Earth has·passed from her origiual
place, the transit produces no eftect.
Thia ia one caUBe why ao mwiy Alltrologtrs h2we failed
in their predictions; aud tbe genel'ality ~(mankind hau
not omitted to visit the aina of tl•e prof'e11ora, upon the art
itself, without reflecting upon the liabinty of' students to
error in a science, which has been so liitle examineol.
Weshallnowproceed to examine hisMajesty'sRevolutionu
:figure; it may be necessary to observe, that Hench~! w~•
in •bout 6~ of Capricorn, thi11 was omitted in the Radical
'Figure. aa it ~ould have been unfair to blame Mr. Cooper
f~r not taking into consideration tbat with which h~ ,u.
llltltequainted. In this Figtire, we tlnd the Moon in ~p­
position to Mars, who is on the Radical place orJupitt·r:
Hel'llchel is in Square fo Saturn in the Revoluiiott, he ia
also in opposition to Saturn in the Radix, and the lazter
transits the Square of hie own place, and U.1~ p.IBces of
Mercury and Venus; and it i~ -worthy of 11otice, that
~aturu was near the place orthe fatal direction,' viz :-the
Ascendant to the Square of' Saturn. These combined
with the powerful operating directi'on, taking into con-
aideration the many tryi.ng directionshe had alreal)y passetf,

W& QY~glYea our readen a Nativity that is worth ob·

for judgment ah,ortly after the birth, thenative beingtbea
rather ill,_ ~d after eome consideration we gave a _

«1haeil with the famiiy on the Christmas-day following, we
were !asked (tl&1 cAild tAe" being allt~e end well), did we
feel certain wr judgment was correct,that the child woulcl
oot live? to which we made the following reply, that fbe
~atin, for tbe before-nan1ed reasons, would certainly not
\•e to a year old, which waa Wile, for it died on_
the Sd oC
July, i b. 50 m. A.M. l82~ being then only ten montha
aoa some few daye. This Nativity, aa well aa some others
we shall pubfish, certainly proves that Placidua waa eor-
reet in his opinion ceocerning the Mundane aspects, let

thQfle few that have used them.at times (when _
the Dra~
gon's Head or Tail did not suit their purpose) have made
JUuch conf~aiori without throwing any light on the~­
science.
The way we recommend is, f.o consider what aspect the
plauets have to them, and then you may direct them the
liame as the planets. We have always found, from proc•
tk"C, that whenever Saturn, 1\Iars, or Herschel, is in the
latter degrees of Scorpio or Talirus, that the Star Cor•-
Jeouis (which is in the latter degrees of Leo); is extremely
evil, and when directed to the ?.lidheaven generally briugs
to the native some serious trouble, and if tile nativity
be unfortunate, a total downf;~ll; . \fin a female geRiture.
the native seldom esc~pes being ruined by some bate
character. ' If the nativity be 'fortu•~atc and this ~tar be_
in N!xtile to the Sun, Mars, or Jupiter, it being dir~ctecf
to the Mid·lteaven, .generally gjves great preferment, ae-
cordipg to the riattve's station in life; or if this St,ar be :O&a
the Mid:he~~oven at birth' in Sextile or Trine 'to·the''Sun.
Ma1·s~ or :Jupiter, it ·gives 'great' prefe•·ment, particularly if
the native be in the army or navy, or.in auy public office.
'fhe same rule110Jds'good with \he other fixed Stars ofthe
first magnitude ncar the ecliptic, which ought always be
c..arefully attended to, for they greatly aaaist iu,givinr judg-
ment in nativitiea. Therefore, to explain this p:ut of t.he
iCienee, we shall ill a future numw.r give a Table of ·

Tbe 011e or this table· ia to find" (by an Eplaettwru) ttit'
bue place of the.Moon at any particular time of tbe day.
But you must know, that all astronomers begin the day at
noon, and couut 24- hours- to the day;. so that beginning.
one day at noon, the same ends the next day at noou;
therefore 1 in· the afternoon is the first hour of the day,
and 10 hoUI'Ii ·after noon is the next day l in the morning•.
Now in the following- Epherru:ri1, the Moon's: place in the
third column in every month is exactly calculated.to the
meridian of London ; and, to know her daily motion, you
must subtract the place of the 1\loon one day, from her
place the following day, by adding 30 degrees (if need .
require it); for so many degrees bath every sign, and 6o
111inutes are in every dt:gree; so you have the daily motion
of the Moon.: then look 'for tJ1e same in ~be head, or the
nearest'number you can find, ami nuder it ia the motion of
the Moon, ag1·eeing to that time.
ExAMPLE.-To find the place of the Moon on the t8tb.
day of January at 8 at night: her pia~ at noon is n
19 dcg. 42 min. and the next day in 27 dcg. 8 min. of the·
.ame sign; therefore ber diurnal motion is 14 deg. 26 min.
then I find the neart!st number to this, viz. 14 deg. 26 min.
iu the head of the table, and· agaiust 8 hours are 4 deg.
42 min. 'which being added ton 19 deg, 4Z min. herplace
at noon, tb~ sum will be n 17 deg. 8 min• .her place- at S
o'clock that night.
We have gi;en these tables ofthe Moon's motion, with
a view to at~sist those persons who study horary astro-
logy, for it often happens tha:t they hav.e not time t&
work a sum; therefore, .these easy tables will be found
uceptable, and, as they are not paged, consequently may
be ~ken out,to uae with tbe Ephemel'il,without detriment:.

Highness the Duke of Clarence, who it may be remem-
bered died March 4, 1821, at the age of three mouths. The

·ause or so early a dis.~olution appenrs to be the numerous
e\·il aspects to the Moon, which being placed in the ninth
house, is indisputably hileg. The l\toou is but three murl·
daur. degrees from tlie-aquare ot the Sun, who is nearly
t·onjoined with Mars, and in mundane sesquiquadrate to
S:~turn. To add to the evil, Saturn is in exact mund<~ne
:wd zodiacal semiqua11ile to the Moon, who has not the
least assistance from the beueficH. This oc~urrence is
within the memory ofevery one; the time was taken from
the public paper!', it therefore cannot be said it was
altered to agree "~ith any particular direction. The pl:i-
m:tar·y positions are too remarkable to escape the notice
of auy one versed in this science; while 'we can bring iu-
tlf..'lnces or this k_

OBSERVATIONS
On the Aspectl ofthe Planetf.
'rnz dc~cription of the upects of the planets with each
other as generally given, requires some explanation. ht
horury questions, every planet, being lord ofsome ltouae, is
a s1guitlcator ofsome person or thing; but in genethliacal
astrolog:)', the luminaries and angles• only can be cousi-
dered as signitlcatora. It is of the last importance that
we observe the posilion or the planets in Mundo, which it
not carefully attended to will often cause erroD in judg-
ment. For example, if the Sun in a nativity be pla~ed in
three degrees of Cancer, on the cusp ofrhe ascenda11t and
Saturn, in three degrees of Ariea on the cusp of the
eleventh, here the powerofthe.square ofSaturn is greatly
iucreased by his approximation to the zenith ; had he
been placed in Libra, on the cusp of the fifth, his square,
thougb still evil, would not have produced 10 much misery
and misfortune to the native. Again, if we place Mercury
on the cusp of the eleventh, in 28 degrees of Leo, and th•
:Moon in the third, in the same number of degrees ofSagit4
tarius, they will be in zodiacal trine, a position highly fa..
vourable to the intel)ectual powers; but had the situation
been revereed, the native, though equally fortunate as it
respects business, would neither poaae11 that depth of re-

Jupiter .be signifieator, the di~position is1not 110 good, the
querent seldom meets with much succel>tl in the world, he
is very niggardly, and generally aequires property by some

noon the pre<;eeding day, and then by the help of the
above table, it will be seen how many de~rees; minutes,
·or seconds they move in an hour. For example, suppose
a planet moves I· degree in t4·hours, how far does it move ·
in 1 hour? At the top of the first column is·the figure 1;.
and in the same line of Hie second column, is 2 minutes-
and SO seconds; whicb abews, that ifa plimet be 24 houu
iu moving t· degree, it then moves ~ minutes and SO·
seconds in an boUT, Or suppose a· planet only move~ 2'
minutes in 24 hours, look into the first column ofthe table
for the figure ~. opposite, In the se110nd column, 1tands 5
seconds, which shews, that if a planet moves 2 minutes in
24 hou~ it then only moves s.secoud~ in an hour. Again,
if a planet's diurnal motion "be II minutes, what is its
hourly motion ? Look into the· irst column for 11, and
opposite is 27. SO; which indicates. that if a planet moves
11 minutes in 24 hours, it ruovl'!l i7 seconds· and SO thit·ds
in an hour. The same rules are to be obsPrved in the
motions of all the planets; but let it be carefully remem-
bered, that if tlie diurnal motion of any planet· be in
degrees, then you must enter the first" column ofthc table
onder the denomhtation·of degrees, and the second column
with minutes and seconds; but if the diurnal motion of the·
P.lanet bt: only in minutes, thell you must begin to reckon,
•
sof .tn ll'lllft or nata-rnoz; oa,
in the 6rat cohtmn only with minutes, and in the second
column with secouW. aad thirds. This is indicated by the
initial letter• pla~o:ed over each column, wliich si,::nify
degrees or minutes in the first column; and in the second,
degrees and minutes,. minutes and seconds, seconds nnd
lbirds. Then suppose a planet moves 1· degree and 11
minutes it~ 24 bours, how far does it move in an hour?
Refer to the table and say,
1 Degree in 24 hours is. 2 min. SO sec. 0 thirds per hour.
11 miuutea tn ~4 hours is o min. 27 sec. SO thirds.
Answer 2 57 SO
And thus any quantity of a planet's diurnal motion, .may
lk! reduced to time in the same Dl\lnner.

there may eometlmes be three or fou~ planeb concerned in
tl1e matter, sometimes but one, but rarely less than two
serve to give the disease and death. To this purpose, in
the nativity of Charles ll it was the Moon that gave the
disease, but it was Mars that killed him, nhl•ough there
were divers directions; I am sure six or seven it\ force and
ppcration 'when lac died, and helped to complete tbe work
of mortality. Likewise in this case ofthe protectat" Ci-om-
'vcll, it was not Mercury or Venus, lord or lady of the
dghth house, that gave him either an ague, fner, or poison,
no nor Saturn, lord of the Ascendant in the eighth, in op_
poaition 'o Mars; J:>ut it was the directions of Sabam, aud
the Moon herself, that gave his disease, but that of Mars
killed him, And that I do assert to be the true cause Gf
bit death; and shall have a proportional effect in all other
nativities, where the Moon is Hileg, and in that part of
Heaven; that Is, it sball give death, but perhaps it may
not be by the same disea5~ but it shall be of the same
nature, violent and quick, as indeed are moat of those
directions where Mara and the Moon are concemed, lmt
especially where they sway and govern. And that you
may IJe the more satisfied, do_but examine the nature of
the promlttors in directions, and compare them with the
nature and circumstances or his disease by which he ex-
pired. Both which being throughly considered, in the
next place consult the texl of Ptolomy in his fourth bo11k,
chap. 10, De genere Mortit, and you will (I believe) be
soon satisfied about the truth of that matter. And so I will
conclude my ~iscourse on the nativity of this great general,..

Anno 164-e.-He had a eofumisaion for 'a regiment of
Jwr5e, which regiment he tuised iu his own couutry <r
freeholders, and freeholder's sons, who did really go out iu
p(liut of cou3cieuce to serve ~hdr country in that time <.f
tlauger: he had uow the EB ad Cor .1{, aud n very good
J!e,·olutiou to aiiSist him.
Amw 1648.-He was very active in the north, wh11re he
opposed the Earl of Newcastle, :~.nd lo that purpose joined
with the Lord Willoughby, :tnd di<l the parliament and-
whole nation g1llant service. In this summer he also took
~lamford from the .king's force~; and this w;ts the tl1st

he himself coucludcd the day in prayer; which made
those good men say, that. they had a king in covenant with
God. I think this enough 10\thout mentioning anythin~
of the ~cotcb Covenant, to inform honest J; G. that he
!night have forbore that reflection on Cromwell ; for you
~ce it ia an easy matter to give him a Rowland for his
.fi>oiH~r•
..4nnn t6•4.-He differed with the Earl of Mancbl'ster•
one of the parliament generals, about the conduct of ·a
battle, I _
think that of Marston-Moor, about which they
ac:cuaed eaclt other; but Cromwell came off ylctor, and
still ~tood fair with th,e parliament, making hia O\Yn call(;

he had the Sun in conjunction with Jupiter, the Moon in

directions for such troubles and vexations as he then under·

more of bad than good in it; for the Sun, Moon and Sa-

for then was he (!mployed to 1·educe the \Velsh rrbclp,
whil:h he did clfectulllly ; after that he went against Duke
Hamilton .and the SCQts, then in h\ucashire, where he
beat and took the duke prisoner; and toward the eud of

therefore, on the whole we should recommend the querent

J>toloftly's words; and if you please but to look into the
eleventh dtaptcr of that Quadripartite, and the third b~ok,
you will there fiud tl.ese words :-Cum a11ten' .qua1rimu~ i11

Cadi. In this chapter he is labouring to vrove, ·and ·also
to lAy dow~ by rule the. place ofthe prorogator; and aftfr
he bath.spent some time to show the prorogatory pla~e
in general, be comes in the words bt:forcmentloncd to the
particulai'JI, and which of them- do precede in power and
-order; and therefore, aays he, when we inquire who is
n10st powerful in tbese places, .the first in order l• the
~id-heaven; next aner that the ascendant, then th~
eleventh ~ouse, then the aeveutb0 and Jut of all the nin~h.
And the reason 'YhY he i~ so particular in this case, is
because ·the Sun and Moon may be sometimes both in
.prorogatory places, and both contend for priority; there·
fore in ~uch a case these rules are to be considered :uid
COmJl:lrCd with those ofthe 18th chapter of thesame book j
by which it may be decided which or the two have the
.real power ofHileg, or giver of life. Hence ce11ainly our
author by takiugsuch paius and care to lay down pa11icular
rules how to elect the giver of lifl', did iuteud·a greater use
.to be made of it, thau npy of our late pretenders. I per-
ceive. are aware of,-wbid1 seems morC.Jllain from the fir!t

la: begins that chapter with tllese words :-lrave.atu Proro·
gato1·e, d"o modi'"mendi su11t, &c.
Now, if thiR doctrine be true, and that the professor~ of;
this sl'ieuce will be pleased to allow the great Ptolomy "
bharc in thdr good opinions ;"then this lying oracle of
uurs is quite out of doors, and besides tbc mark in his OWII
tril,lt', wht>n he tl'lls the world, that the Sun cRunot be
giver of life, if he were in au aphellcal pla1·e;. as in the
J>agtl befo~ q1,10tf'd. For wheu hi' allow11 the :ll<ccmlant
in Cr~well'a nativity, the power ot'Hileg, and the Sun at
the same time within 12 degrees of the cusp, and locally
in it, seems to me a substantial piece of nonaence, quite
t•ontradictory to tbe most approved authors in beiug, who
allow all of them, that the ascendant Is the aet"ond place in
power to entertain the prorogator; and that the S11ri there
is ,also certainly Hileg, if the Moon ill not abovethe earth.
So that should I insi~ on llQ other·reason but this, it would
be sufficient to prove the figure and time of his nativity
false; and this because 1ie makes that imaginary dit·ection
of .the ascendant to the square or Mar~, the only one to
paove the truth olthc wi10!e calculation. For if,ve slwuld
allow such a direction in that figure, as the Sun to 1he
fiiJIIare of Mars, (which iudeed there is none before he
~houlll be ninety-one yean of age) )'et it. is wholely mis-
'lpplicd, and a power' given to it quite distinct from the
ordt!r of nature, and the authority ofauihors; the ascend-
ant not having power to kill when the Sun is in the
b~r~cope, or Sfl)' other place, givet .of li(e. 1have beeu

tue plainer and fuller in this point, beC'Iluse it is the priu-

But again, in this nativity that he hath published and
asserted for truth, there is another notorious error, nnd
that ie, he leta the Sun pass by the squa·re of Mars, the ,
•quare of Saturn, and butly of Japilel', lotd of the eighth
house lu the fburth. that fatal place a• they CRIJ 'it; nnd
kill• him with the a~eendant to one lingle dltectit'ltl only.
Now, if we should allow that the ascendant bad power;
and did 'kill by direction to the aqliare of Mare; why

wllich the learned editon of the late " Straggling .Aitr.-

tint ofSeptember last, which they refused to in_
sert, under
crtfvl in.ti"uatio111, that it " is too replete with .party-
spirit to be iuserted." Now as many scientific cbaractea-s
are anxious to see that Jetter laid before the public, con-
, \:eiving ~it must contain IOMething of an extraordinary
nature, I have herewith communicated a copy of it for
insertion in your useful and valuable work, that the reader
may observe, that notwithstanding the DIUt fond ofAstro.
logical LiteratiSre, which those learned editors-poueea, yet,
they dare not give publicity to my plain observatious, which
are founded on TILUTB; and chiefty relate to the rectifi-
cation of an illustrious geniture ; but I am willing to make
some allowance for such BABTY and censorious ceodu.et,

aa indifferent one; you may if you please, cnll it bad, for
tbe Moon·was on the Sun's radical place, Saturn and

'J'bua I laave endeavoured to show you how I understand
the metbod and manner ofjudging death by primary and
converse directions, revolutions, secondary direclions, pro-
iremons, traoaits, arid.ingresses;·which, if rightly under-
stood aD!f practised, would give the ,tudents in this seience
more satisfaction than all those whims published by OU\"
modem authors, and stolen from them by our Popish
oracle. And I hope by this time, I have given the pro·
fCIIIOn and students in this art full satisfaction, in provin'
that the nativity which Gadbury printed, was notoriously
false, aiJil grounded upon principles next 'to none; and
tbat:tbe reaso11s and rules given to assert its truth, are no
ways becoming a man ofskill orJngenuity, tllpecially one
that pretends to be the master and head of the whole
tribe, and endued with the advantage_oftwenty-five years
experience, and more; when· he wrote and published
Cromwell's nativity last in the year 1685. And so I come .
.in the next place to give you my general judgment on the
whole figure, after the manner 'that the rest of our pro-
fellion do ou the twelve houses; and perhaps too, I may
follow the same order in my judgment, but not in their
rules and principles ofjudgment.-[VroE page JSe.)
