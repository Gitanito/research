    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Kneph, The.
 Official Journal of the Antient & Primitive Rite of Masonry.
 Peace, Tolerance, Truth
 1881â€“1900  Monthly through 1883; quarterly through 1887; then annual
 London, England.  Publisher: Published under the Authority of the Sovereign Sanctuary for Great Britain and Ireland.  Editor: Bro. Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, IX(degree), LL.D., 32(degree)(first six issues), then James Hill, John Yarker, et alia.  Succeeded by: Zuzimoth
 1/1/January 1, 1881-July 28, 1900.  The last numbered issue was that for August 1895, and only one issue seems to have been issued thereafter.

 This was the organ of John Yarker's Antient & Primitive Rite of Masonry, which has intimate connections with the origins of the Theosophical Society and with later occult organizations, such as Theodor Reuss' O.T.O.  Despite its notoriety for contributions by Mackenzie and Yarker, the journal by and large consisted of lodge news and of Yarker's interminable efforts to establish his Masonic genealogy.  Listed in F. Leigh Gardner, A Catalogue Raisonne of Works on the Occult Sciences, Vol. 1, Rosicrucian Books (London: Privately Printed, 1903).  Copy in Chancellor Robert L. Livingston Masonic Library, New York.
