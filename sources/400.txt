AN
ACCOUNT of the ECLIPSES
AND OTH!R
CELESTIAL APPEARANCES,
In the Year 1799,
Calculated from New TABLES of tbe Motions of t~e
Planets, founded on t&e latefl Obft"'vations, accord-
ing to the LVer.vtonian Syjlun of Gravitation,
By HENRY AND R E W S, Afrronomer,
At R()yjfrm, in the County of Hertford.*
ASTRONOMY, for its Excellency, jufrly challengeth
the higheil Place of all human Sciencis ; it lifteth
the Heart of Man above the Heavens by invifible Lines
and immortal Beams; meeteth with the Reflettion of
Light incomprchenfible, and procureth Delight and Sati~­
faftion unfpeakable.
Sacred Urania! wi h whofe Be:mty fir'd,
.!VIy Soul is ravifh'd, and my Brain infpir'd;
0, teach me how thy v,on,!'rO\IS vVorks to trace,
Jn ev'ry Part of Univcrfal Space;
t..}ive me the Way< of wand'ring Star to know,
The Height of Heav'n above and Dtt>th of Earth below.
n l T H 1 N the Limits of this Year there will be o.ly
two Eclipfes of the SUN; and, as they fa 1 about fix
IV ont s' Diftance from each other, we muit expett no
!•:erpfes of the MooN, for tl:le foHowing Reafon, jn the
V\'ords of the great KEPLER, Norvilrotia duo anlralibus

oi the SuN are feldom vifible in thefc Northern Part~ of
t 1e harth, although the Sun were abo\'e the Hod:Lon nnJ
fl:0ne ever fo bri_o-ht; fer the S.itua~ion of us EurfJ/falll
npc1. the (;lobe, requircth the 1V1ooN to have confidera-

fioned thereby, in order to bring lrer between the SuN
and us. The firfi of thefe Eclipfes is on Sunday the 5th
Day of May, at 46 Minutes before our One o'Clock in
the Morning; therefore, was the Moon's Latitude ever fo
favourable, it mufi in confequence be invifible to us : .But
in the great South Se:t, or Pacific Oc an, it will be a very
great Eclipfe, not total but annular; for along the Track
of Central Appearance, the Spetl:ators will be entert:tined
with 4 beautiful Ring of Light quite round the Moon's
dark Body; and in 8 Degrees of North L1.titude, and 77
Degrees 37 Minlltes Eaft Longitude !rom Lonilolt; this
beautiful and grand Appearance (though, in fome degree,
awful to behold) will fall upon them precifely at their J 2
o'Clock at Noon. This Eclipfe will partially (more o
lefs) be vifible at the Sand·wicb Ijland1, at Otaberte, an
the re11 of the Society IJ!u, at the Friend{y t!fa?tdJ, the
Nertu H e6ridu1 N ..w Caltdonia, and as far as Ne:ru Ztalsnd
in the ~outh Sea. It will alfo extend itfelf to the \V~!l­
ward, as far a" the extenfive EaHern Coaft of New Hol-
land, and the fmall Hlands there; bout; alfo to Nnv Gui-
nea, the LtJdrone ljlmtdJ, and as fJ.r North from thence as
the I/land of J"ap::w.
The fecond o( thefe Eclipfes is on Monday the z8th
Day of O!lober, at 36 Minutes pail: our Five o'Clock in
the Ev Pit g, invifible to us; at vhich Time the S'U N is
vertjcal in the great South Sea or Pacific Ocean\ near to
the \Vcficrn Coa!l: of Peru 'n South Am:rica, in 5 Degrees
I 5 Min•I'es South L:ttitude, and 82 Dcgr§es 45 Minutes

maia.z, to the l!hnd of Cuha, and all the reil of the IY.')l

•799·
Concerning the famous TRANSIT of the PLANET MeR-
CURY over t!Je SuN's Dijk, which happens on Tuefdar.
the 7th Day of May, I 799, and vijible (if Clouds in-
terpoje not) from tbe Be.ginning to. the End, botb to u;
and all Europe.
T HE Tranftts of the Planets VEN"Us and· MERCURY
over the SUN"s Di!k are curious Appearances in
Allronomy, which do not often hapr-en, efpecially of Ve-
nus, not more than once or twice in a Century. The firft
of this Kind that was ever feen fince the Beginning of the
World, was a Tranfit of Venus in the Year 1639• and
was preditl:cd by Mr. JEREMIAH HoRROX, an Engliffl-
rnan, and obferved only by him and his Friend, Mr.
cRAB TRE-E' both refiding near Liverpool. The Planet
MERcuRY, entirely divefted of its Radiancy, will this
Year traverfe the SuN's Face for ne r Se\'en Hours and a
Half, in Form of a round black Spot, and will be feen,
if the Sky be clear at the Time, to all Places of the
Earth where the SuN is up. ME~tCURY will be vifil>Ie
to fharp Eyes without a Telefcope, only defended by the
Interpofi.tion of a dark Glafs, or a Piece of clear Win-
dow Glafs fmoked over the Flame of a Candle, but will
appear much larger, and more to Advantage, with the •
Help of a Teiefcope: But the Precaution of interpofing
a dark Glafs l:ietween the Eye and the Telefcopc is necef-
fary to be taken, without which the Sight may be de-
ftroyed, or greatly impaired; but, thus !hielded, it will
be perfeClly fecure from Danger, or any Incon\'eniencc.
The Beginning of this Tranfit will be feen as far Eaft as
the Hland of Japan, Eajlern Tartary, China, the Phi/ipint
Hlands, the IHar.ds of Bormo, Sutzda, and Ja~a, and allo
the Weftern Coaft of Ntcw Holland; but the SuN will fet
with them foon after. In Ne<7.t:foundland, Necw Britain,
near the Mouth of Hudson's StraitJ, and on the EaftcJn
Coafts of the Bt·c:z,i/s in South America, the Tranfit will
juft begin as the SuN rifes. In the J~and of ·Madagascar,
th.e V!d:crn Parts of Persia, the Defarts of Arabia, and
on the South EaH: Coaft of the Red Sea, the Tran:Lit begins
at 12 o'Clock at Noon; but the SuN will rife at the '
Middle of the T_.ranfit at Capi Hortt in. South America- In
the.:
the Ina.nd of Cry/on in the Indian Sea, and on the Coro~
mandcl and Malabar Coa!ls, and to the Ea!fcrn Parts of
Weftern 'Tartary, the SuN will fet with them foon after

in A.fr#ca, the Tranlit ends a<J the SuN fets. This Tranfit
will be feen, from the Middle to the End, to all North'

whole of this Tran:fit will be vi:fible :~t the Azores, the Ca-
nary, a.nd Cape Verd Hlands, and alfo at the Hland of St.
Helma, as well as with us and all the reil: of E;Jro;,e.-
MERcuRY being. a fickle Planet, and thefe Appearances
very rare, . I would not be too peremptory in my Affer-
tions; but I hope the Appearances in thefe Kingdoms will-'
not greatly deviate fr.om the following Type and Calcu.
lations, made from ·new and· improved Tables. The De-
lineltioil or Type- is adapted to the City oF LoN o o ·
and fhows the Track of MERCURY from the•Beginning_
to the End, which will appear, according to my Calcula-
tions, to be performed in a Curve Line, Convex towards the
Sun's Centre; it alfo will be fufficient to inform the curious.
Obferver, in what Part of the SuN's Peripl}ery he may

In a wet Seafon, fuppofe in Hay·'Time and llar'Vrjl, the

when the Conftitution of the Air is much indined to

more Rain, as it never ft~nlls then very high. And if, at

THE . I:NTROD UCTION.
CouRTEous READER,
I N feveral >Of my form~r Alrr..a.n:1cks, I have taken N ·)·
tice, that the SPIRIT of GOD is now performing
great Wonders in all Nations, in order to bring abo:.1t
feme great \,7
ork of Reformation amongft Ma 1kind ;
wherein I have made it appear, by a numerous Train of
Dedutlions, that fevera.l Scripture Prophecies are at this
Tune fulfilling in the \Vor}d, tending to the Overthrow
and DeftruEtion of Popery, Snpcrfiiticn, and arbitrary
Power. ·what a Fund of Rcfletlion upon the Fate of
Nation- does the Fall of RoME at tnis Time gin: Rife
to! RoME, which filled the World with her Arms, and
had fo long enflaved Mankind, is funk · at hft into the
Arms of a Conqueror; her rapal- Power, which coula·
have brought Kir.gs from the furtheft Ends of the Earth·
to kneel before it, which could make a Monarch a foli-
tary Being among his Subjects, and ftrip h~m by a few
Words of all Happinefs and Authority; which could h:we
called Millions of Swords from their Sc"J.bbJ.rds, to re..
vcnge a Look that threatened it with Infult, has been an-
nihilated without a Struggle, and not a Sigh of Regret is
breathed by any one at its Fate! M1y we not, therefore,
be juftified in confidering the prefent Power of France ai
the appointed Inftrument of Puniihment to the corrupt
Part of the Chrifi-ian World, and of Difcipline and Trial
to thofe who hold the Faith· which was once delivered
u .to the Saints.

THE HIEROGLYPHIC.
Of the Bruma! Ingrejs, or Winter ~Jarter.
THIS OEarter begins Duember 21, 1798, at 4z Mi~
!lute:> paft 12 o'Clock at Noon, when 10 Degrees of Yj
culminate, and 2 5 Degrees of 'Y' afcend the Eafiern Fini-
tor. Mars is in 4 Deg. of CV', the Afc~ndant of England;
he has juofi rifen abo\·e the Earth; 1f. in 17 Degrees; ~

J/{ars is haftcning to a Zod1acal o AfpeB: of Tt, from
Cardinal and Tropical Signs,; Afars in his ow11 Dignities,.
and Satum in the Dignities of the Moon. From a Vie\v
ol the Planetary Configurations at t!tis Ingrefs, fame Po-
fit"ons are for Peace and Concord, while others are for
War and BloodThed ; and thus are the Nations of the
Earth divided. The Pofition of the two grand Superiors,
Jupiter and Saturn, will, I doubt, help but little to the
Peac.c and. Trans_uillity of IRELAND, as they are, from

articular Circumil:ances, very weak in the Figure; there
feems to be frill great Impediments to Peace, and rather
fix tha.n r~move our Complaints. In France, Hollaxd, Ger-
tflany, Italy, and Spain, there will be great Divifions, Dif-
contents, and Murmurings, great Lofs of Trade, and Af-
fliction to the common People; the Flames of which will
fpread far and wide, even into the United States of Ame-
rica; but that People will aB: with great Caution and
Prudence. We now proceed to fay, it is more than pro-
bable the French Nation will not be always fo rampant a~
of late Years they ha·>'e been, there being aufpicious and
alfo difaftrous Years and Times, as well in the Govern-
ment of Empires, Monarchies or Kingdoms, as in the
Reigns or Annual Rulings of Princes or Republican Go-
vernments, of which'France has lately had the moll: re-
markable Experience in the Life, Reign, and Death of
their late unfortunate K1 Nc, whofe proper Sins ceuld not
or did not exceed the Number of other: Mens; but he pe-
rilhed (as we may fay) by the peculiar Fate of France,
God fo permitting, as it was the Fate of our unfortunate
CHARLES I. King of England. Thefe are .?"encral Warn-
ings to all Pofl:erity, to fuew what the Revolution of
Time, their Sins, and the Sins of Nadons will bring
about, fo ALMIGHTY GoD having decreed it:-ALL
THINGS HAVE A TI:VIE TO BE BORN, TO INCRE~\ S !:,
TO DIE, AND TO BE EXTll\GUISH:Eb! More than this
cannot be faid, or may we fafely deliver. Several State-s
and Kingdoms in Europe, we are forry to fay, are yet la-
mentably to fnffer by Decay of Trade, intefl:ine Divifioac;,
Loffes at Sea, Tumults, and the Sword ! But yet, let all
thofe People whom it may concern, ohferve this ihort af-
trological and cabalifiical Judgment, That if any foreig11
Power fhall attempt an lnvafion, or to bring in a foreign
Army amongft us, to dei'hoy or bring us into Slavery, we
prediCl: they !hall afiuredly fail in their Purpofe, and !hall
never attain their Dcfigns, bllt perifl1 in the very . tterupt.

THE Sun now begins to difplay his genial Influence on
the Earth, and this ~arter commences on the zoth of
1\larch~ at 17 Minutes paft 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon;
and the Planets are configurated and difplayed as in tBI
abo\·e Scheme. Here is Appearances of Treaties offered,
1v1ei1engers fent to and fro~ great Difcourfes of Peace, in
.or near thefe Times, but I doubt nothing lefs is thought
Df but to g.ain Advantages, or other Purpofes. The Po-
fition of A1arJ and Jupit£r i>1 the Afcendant of Irelmzd, on
the Cufp of the Medium Ca::li, is a fanguine and very ma•
lignant Afpea, for it implies great Calamities to Man·
kind, as Commotions~ Wars, Seditious, Subverftons
Vingdoms and Smtes, Alteration of Laws, Cuil:oms,
Rights, &c. The gt eat Iieroe~ of the Age have now

Opportuni.ty to fuew tlteir Valour; many eminent and ex·
traordinary Events and Alterations wi11 fhortly come to

fome of the Places where the grand Scene of Alfairs may
)Je expected, are Holla~ttf, Fra11a, Germany, !tal;·, Spain,
Portugal, to \Vhich, I fear, I muft add Great-Britain and
Ireland; and, indeed, moft of the European Powers fecm to
b:! concerned i. one Shape or other in the fuperlative Ac-
tions of thefe Times. Some Matters of great Importance
are now ham. ering upon the Anvil of State, and the evil
Spirit of France is Hill ?.t work, in contriving ancl carry-
ing on fame Deligns againft our Liberties, Land, and Na-
tion, which, we hope, Go o will pre1•ent;. but there is a
ihange Spirit of Ditcord amongft lVIankind, whence ~'ars,
Devafiations, and all other Calamitie.> ufually attending
.the fame, will be the fad Fate of too many Count:-ies.
Great and tremendous will be the TranfaB:ions of this
Year; but we have this SatisfaCtion and Confolation, they
are all uader the ruling and controlling Power of God ;
therefore, Keep cloji: to the Word if Gon's PATIE.t\CE, a11a

EtfeCts of this ConjunClion to be mail: eminent, and to
promote grerlt and notable Aaions. This Conjunction
principally refpcB:.s Europe, and iliows moft eminent Ac-
tions to be carried on with great Refolution and Ce-
lerity. The French Republic, and alfo Greot-Britain,
appear very formidable to fame of their Neighbours;
and fome confiderable Changes appear in the Affairs of
