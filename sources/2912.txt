EXPLANATIONS OF THE FOLLOWING TABLE.
The two last columns show at the intersection of what lines every organ is to be mea­
sured. That marked O. D. is Occipital Distance, and F. D. Distance from the Falx.
The first column of printed figures shows the standard form and size of Mediocrity of
Bales of about thirty-three years of age, and the sixth the same of females of about
thirty. In the third blank column is to be written the measurements of the person to
be described. Every measurement is then to be compared with the proper standard
for the person's sex, age and size; and the results written in the two first blank columns.
All equal with the standard, are to be marked across both columns “ Eqn.” for equani­
mity., How many grades above the standard any one is, are to be written in the first
space, and how much below in the second. In the space under “ remarks,” are to be
written the size of the head, and the grade of the standard with which the measure­
ments are compared. Those marked with an interrogation point, instead of figures, are
not measured with satisfactory precision.
The size of General Mediocrity is that which, with proper health and habits, is best
suited to succeed equally well in any station or occupation in civilized communities.
But for certain pursuits, certain other forms and sizes are most advantageous. For ex­
tensive, intricate and deliberate business, a large and well nourished and disciplined
head is requisite. But where moderate abilities can do, where success mainly depends
on quickness ^and despatch, a small and vigorous brain will accomplish most. But
every form and size above idiocy, is exquisitely suited to excel and pass life happily in
some honourable occupation.
One grade below General Mediocrity may be regarded Moderate Mediocrity.
Two grades below the General Mediocrity of males, is the standard of those of about
twenty years of age; and of females of those of about seventeen. These are also the
standards of the most advantageous forms and sizes for persons of about thirty years of
age, who conduct a business of moderate extent and intricacy, with the greatest des­
patch and accuracy. Very intricate and extensive affairs soon weary or confuse them,
and they seek less arduous employment.
Three grades below the General Mediocrity is the standard of those more active and
despatchful than those of two grades below; but possess less mental capacity.
Four grades below the General Mediocrity is the average and standard of those who
can conduct only the most simple and systematic business; and this, however, with the
greatest despatch.
One grade above the General Mediocrity may be termed the Grand Mediocrity.
Two grades above the General Mediocrity is the average and standard of those who
superintend or conduct very extensive and abstruse business of public or private na­
ture. If their business, for a long time, does not sufficiently occupy their minds, they
are in great danger of becoming indolent and inefficient, till disciplined to business anew.
Three grades above the General Mediocrity is the standard of those of greater capa^
cities than those of two grades above, and must do a more extensive and difficult busi­
ness ; or they will become more inefficient by indulging indolent habits.
Four grades above the General Mediocrity is the average and standard of those who
conduct the most extensive and intricate public and private affairs in civilized commu­
nities. But if the talents of those of this size are not supported by health and business
habits, they soon become unwieldy.
In deciding with which standard one's measurements should be compared, take that
which will make the greatest number of organs Equanimity; and nearly an equal num­
ber above and below.
TEMPERAMENTS.
The Lymphatic is the disposition of our constitutions to recruit or reorganize after
emaciation or labour. If it is done very rapidly our parts do not form very durably.
But if very slowly, they are more enduring, but are very long recruiting, when we have
over exerted ourselves.
The Nervous is the disposition of our constitutions to supply itself with the nervous
stimulus, by which our nerves and muscles are bperated. When very abundant, we
are in danger of being active beyond our endurability. When scanty, we become slug­
gish under ordinary incitements.
The Sanguine results from the good health and vigour of the stomach and lungs, sup­
ported by proper diet and exercise.
The Bilious is the disposition of our constitutions to organize its parts in a firm and
durable manner.
But the Temperaments depend very much on our health and habits, and vary with
them. The more intensely we exercise any part, the more endurable it recruits, and
the more active and more abundantly our nervous stimulus becomes.
Every grade of difference in the Temperaments from Mediocrity is to be regarded as
making a corresponding increase or decrease of as many grades in the size of the head.
But this obtains as to the quantity and despatch of business, rather than as to the intri­
cacy of it.

RUDIMENTS OF PHRENOLOGY.
P hrenology teaches the powers and operations of the mind, and the me­
dium through which it manifests itself.
THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
O f the science are that the mind manifests itself through the brain; o f which
different parts manifest different faculties, and that the better these parts are, the
m ere efficiently they manifest their several faculties.
T h e Conditions o f the brain, or qualities, which eflect and indicate the suc­
cess o f mental operations are Health, Habit and Size. As in ,muscular
actions, the operator is invigorated by health, rendered accurate and speedy by
habit or practise, and strong by great size of limbs— so the brain, for it is a ner­
vous substance, whose labor is to communicate between the mind and external
subjects, is improved by a proper combination of these conditions or qualities.
T o illustrate:— Languor, or disease of the brain produces mental inactivity or
derangement. Habit improves ones facility and precision of performing. A s
to the best size for the brain, it should bear a certain proportion to the size and
vigor o f the body, and the extent and intricacy of one’s business. If too large
for the body, the nutritive and stimulating organs cannot maintain it in vigorous
and protracted exercise. If too large for one’s business, one becomes restless
from net being fully occupied, and his mind wanders to other objects. If below
i the usual size, the incitives to action are not strong, the small intellectual organs
soon tire and become confused, and the reservoir of animal stimulus for mental
and bodily labor weak and inefficient. Y et the best health and size of brain is of
no immediate practical avail, till somewhat disciplined by habit. Since the nerves
of the brain, like other parts of the nervous system , tire and operate weaker,
and with less correctness, after long continued vigorous application, and when
exhausted, are som etim es better refreshed than at others: men are sometimes
imore observing, intelligent, and moral, or vicious, than at others. Preserve
{then the brain in the best health and indefatigable energy !
T h e brain is formed by the expansion or branching out, in the head, of the
spinal nerve. T he branching out point is immediately between the external
openings of the ears— whence the fibres extend in every direction, and termi­
nate at such distances as to form a globular mass. It is enveloped by the skull,
[which, being of equal, or easily ascertainable thickness, indicates the form and
lize o f the brain. Its health is ascertained as that o f other parts of the system —
but its habits, or education, can be learned only from inquiry, or experiments on
the mental powers.

GENERAL APPLICATIONS.
T he cerebral fibres which terminate at the forehead, are the organs o f the
intellectual pbwers— those at the side, the incitives to provide for and defend i
self—those at the back, the incitives to friendly intercourse and social attach* i
ments— and those at the top, the moral incitives. N ow the larger and /more i
active any organ is, the stronger it incites its possessor tojprocure its^ratifica-
tion s; and the deeper emotions of pleasure or pain it affords. T he size and
energy of the organs in different persons, being as different as the forms of their
heads; they manifest as various powers and characters, as their mental organs are
different. If, on inspection, the mass forward is found larger than that back o f I
the ears, the possessor should manifest an intellectual turn o f mind : but those irf4
whom the region back of the ears predominates, can manifest but little or no j
taste or talent for literary or scientific pursuits, yet are the most companionable j
and affectionate o f persons. In measurements of the head, to ascertain the pe- \
culiar mental powers of strangers, regard no bumps or hollows, but only the re* j
lative and absolute size of every organ, conceiving it to be a pyramid, whose apex j
is midway between the ears, and whose base is on the skull. 1
EXPLANATIONS\ The proportionate size and energy of the organs are
indicated by numerals— 10 indicating that which is of most frequent occurrence, \
and usual ration to the other developments— 2 0 , altogether eccentric and con- j
trolling one’s whole energies— 6, small or weak— 15, large or characteristic— I , I
idiotic— and the intermediate numbers the intermediate degrees. T he dotted
lines in the cut indicate ihe lowest extent of the brain in the middle of the head.
The plane of 80 degrees occipital distance, divides a well balanced head into i
equal portions. \
j
TEM PERAM ENTS. The Lymphatic appears where organization or nu- j
trition is very active. In such, the flesh and organs are formed soft, white and
delicate; and vigorous efforts of body or mind soon tire and render languid^
The Nervous is characterized by more and quicker nervous and mental I
stimulus and action, than the system can long endure in continuous exercise. j
The Sanguine appeal’s when the stomach and lungs perform their functions <
with complete success ; so as to produce rich nutricious and stimulating blood.
It is indicated by a certain ruddiness of countenance, and a strong pulse. ^
The Bilious is the disposition of the constitution to organize or recruit in the !
most durable manner; so as best to endure hard and long labor, or intense and 1
, protracted mental application, with little fatigue or emaciation. With it the <
features are rough and dark, and the body and mind of the possessor most inde­
fatigable; being the contrary of Lymphatic. Some degree, however, of each
temperament, must every individual possess.
THE ANTESENSORIUM\ or Amativeness, is the cerebellum or little
brain in which the nerves of the five senses all terminate. To it they communi­
cate their im pressions; and from it to the anterior brain the impressions are
transmitted by nervous fibres, which pass from every part of the one to every
part of the other. It delights in the appropriate use of the Five Senses, and
incites to their frequent u se ; but is pained when they are abused. Seeing,
hearing,smelling and tasting,being so much affected by circumstances, its energy
is mainly manifested by the voluntary exercise of the sense of fcelingand m otion

J etto n s with it large and vigorous are distinguished for much violent muscular
btgreise of labor or amusements, and the society of V enus; but it creates no at-
ich p ieh ts to the Objects of i t ; more than for the landscape, the lyre, the rose, or
i e table, by which one gratifies the eye, or ear, or nose, or appetite.
PERCEPT1VES, OR INTELLECTUAL ORGANS.
t
T h e Perceptive* delight and incite us to observe the qualities and relations of
h je c ts , for each o f which there should be a distinct organ. But the organs, or
tn so riu m s o f Smell and Temperature have not yet been established by a suffi-
t e n t number and variety of observations; though several observations and ex-
e r im e n ts have suggested to many that they may be the portion of brain for­
ward o f Alim entiveness, below Acquisitiveness, marked in the cut by an inter-
> gation point. W hen one or more organs are very predominant, they sponta-
e o u s ly monopolize one's attention; distinguishing him in one branch of
m ow ledge, w hile h e neglects others as less entertaining.
1 . Configuration communicates with the mind as to forms, figures or shapes;
rhich it learns, identifies, compares and directs in drawing or constructing. Its
etivity is manifested in writing, drawing, statuary, selecting, forming ana com­
ining materials in the arts, &c.
9 . E xtension notices the size o f objects, and the size of* the space or dis-
ance between them. By it w e determine an inch, or yard, or m ile, and ob-
erv e differences and equality of size and distance. W hen active in an artist, it
supersedes the necessity of frequent instrumental measurements, as it takes them
>y the eye.
3* Color observes and recognizes colors, and remembers the various
hades. Taste and talent as to colors depend on i t Great energy in it is ne-
essary to painters, dyers, florists and dress makers, who should regard the har-
nony o f colors.
4 . Alimentiveness takes cognizance of tastes, and when unvitiated, enjoys
tnd craves such substances, and at such tim es only as the welfare of the stomach
permits. W hen strong, it produces an exquisite taste, and discriminating pal*
ite ; and Epicureanism as to food and drinks. A ctive in all successful cooks,
confectionary, beer and cordial makers. W hen small, one little values good
eating, Ac.
M otion, owW eight, observes of bodies their motions, velocities, momen­
ta, tendencies to motion and weights, and the power requisite to render their
positions staple; or to prevent, control, stop or guide accurately their m ove­
ments. It is strong and active in distinguished dancers, rope ballancers and
tumblers, circus riders, carriage drivers, those employed on high buildings or
masts, pilots, travellers, engineers, great throwers, gunners, &e., and presides
>ver all voluntary motions, to render them precise and graceful*
6 . Direction, or Locality, regards the direction of objects from each other,
md the direction of the lines or surfaces of their sides or angles. It distinguishes
liferent angles, and identifies sim ilar; spontaneously keeps one's direction
while travelling, whether the pathless wilderness, trackless deep, or the mean-
lering ramifications of the streets of cities, and observes the relative locations o f
places. W ith M otion, and it largo, one longs to rovo abro ad'9itizedbyvjO O gIC

7. Arrangement, or Order, collects our knowledge of the order in which
objects are arranged ; as the order in which guests are arranged at table, sol­
diers in their ranks, goods or tools in a shop, and articles o f furniture in a house,
&c. It recognizes similar arrangements, and delights to find things in their
proper places ; but pained at derangement.
8. Number incites to observe the number of objects, or phenomena, and
enables to reckon readily. Energetic in accountants, receivers and disbursers of
m oney, &c. With it very efficient, one counts objects in promiscuous clusters
of 2, 3, 4 or 5, as readily as ordinary persons do by two and two.
9. Sound, or Tune, transmits to the mind our sensations on the sense of
hearing. It observes, recognizes and discriminates sounds, and delights m ostia
sounds most harmonious and melodious. W hen cultivated as to harmony and
m elody, it gives taste and talent for music, and remembers and identifies voice!
and the sound of instruments.
1 0 . Individuality acquires a sort of general idea of objects, so that i f per­
ceived agaiiij it recognizes or identifies them. W hen strong, it enables one ever
after to recognize almost every person, animal or thing that he has once per­
ceived. This organ identifies the very same individual things; w hile the other
organs identify only the same qualities or relations, whether in the same objects
or n ot; as Color recognizes blue, whenever perceived 5 and Configuration a
sphere, of whatever materiaf composed.
1 1 . Language is employed in learning words and other signs, by thfer per­
ception or recollection of which, certain ideas are revived ih the memory : A s
the word W ashington recalls our remembrances of him. It enables to leam
language, commit names and paragraphs, take the ideas from the language of
others, and communicate one’s own. But the ideas to be recalled by it must
first have been acquired by the other perccptives, otherwise language is ttttih-
telligable. Its strength and activity gives facility in the use of language.
1 2 . Causality, distinguishes such objects as are the causes, agents, or primdj
movers of occurrences. B y discovering the causes of events, one learns whati
and how they are to be em ployed to produce the same, when desired. It d irects
in the use of means, and explanations o f events, and desires and enables to learn j
the reasons of things, and to attribute phenomena to their proper agents.
1 3 Effectuality, or Comparison, observes at different stages of the pro­
gress of events, the precise effect, or the exact state of affairs and circumstances.
It recognizes like effects, however differently produced. New phenomena are
explained to it, when discovered to be like effects already familiar, though the
rationale of neither be known. H ence it reasons by sim ilies, comparisons and
analogies. But itcompares only as to effects, w hile the other organs Compare as
to what they severally observe.
14. E ventuality notes the order in which events or actions succeed each
other ; not only of external phenomena, but also of mental operations. . It en a­
bles to narrate circumstances, and undertake the items of business in theirproper
succession. This organ notes the order or succession o f events, but arrange­
ment of things. Itsscntim ent is "T here should be a tim e for every thing
and its em ploym ent is to discover when the time for eaeh occurs.

.
I f f . T im e is occupied in noting the progress o f time, and the intervals be­
tw een or since events occurred. B y it one judges of the lapse of tim e, is incited
to be punctual, and can recognize or mark equal portions of tim e, as in music,
or regulating the clicking of clocks and watches.
INCITIVE ORGANS.
T h e Incitives severally delight one to pursue a certain em ploym ent; and
w hen the Pereeptives discover the state of surrounding things, the mind makes
that organ incite one to its favorite employment, for which circumstances indi­
cate the best prospect for the greatest amount of gratification, with the least ex­
posure to pain. W hile one’s attention is occupied by the action of the organs
m ost directly called into activity, the incitements of the other organs are scarce­
ly felt, unless their sentiments are encroached upon, when they m erely tend to
restrain or direct one’s actions within proper bounds. Since the strength of the
Incitives are so various in different individuals, different organs affording the
greatest amount of happiness when fully gratified, different persons are incited
to undertake different things in the same circumstances, and to choose unlike
occupations, in which their own strongest organs can have frequent exercise.
INCITIVES TO MENTAL ACTIVITY.
I f f . Imagination, M arvellousness, or W onder, is constituted to incite the
intellectual faculties to combine and arrange their operations so as to pursue a
subject through, and to refrain from irrelevant ideas. W hen inactive, or w eak,
the pereeptives pursue their observations and reflections without system , and on
all subjects indiscriminately. It delights in systematic observations, recollec-
sions and meditations, and impresses one with a sense of the reality of the scene
contemplated, in proportion to the evidence. W hen the pereeptives act in di­
rect observation, the most action stirring faith or confidence is produced, but as
the evidence becomes less direct or positive, faith or belief becomes weaker. I f
very large and active, with moderate Pereeptives, it frequently incites deep
emotions o f confidence, faith, or belief, though there be but little, or even indi­
rect evidence ; being almost as strongly incited by im agining, as by the direct
perception o f circumstances. H ence credulousness and superstition, with taste
for the supernatural. W eak and ignorant Pereeptives, being imposed on, pro­
duce false beliefs, or absurd opinions and notions, and incline one to the hypo­
thetical mode of reasoning.
17. H ope delights one to perceive circumstances such that one may attain
desirable objects, and incites the Pereeptives to keep favorable opportunities in
view . If they appear easily and certainly attainable, it produces the pleasura­
ble emotion of H ope, with a resolution to strive for them when a convenient
season occurs. If the Pereeptives be inefficient, hopes may be ill founded. If
this organ be weak, and difficulties in the w ay, one becomes irresolute or des­
ponding, if Cautiousness be active, for want of H ope’s incitem ent to meditate
favorable circumstances. If large, it ceases on favorable indications very eagerly
producing visionary hopes, or too sanguine expectations. N o one undertakes
any enterprise, until the pleasurable incitem ent of Hope be felt in contemplat­
ing it
18- Novelty, or M irthfuloess, or W it, incites and delights one to make

and strange occurrences; to view objects in new lights and connexions, to trae
new modes of expression, originality of thought, action and mechanism, variety
in the manners and customs, and to avoid sameness and repititions. Ideas v ery
different from any thing before know n, yet in perfect and evident harmonpr
with familiar principles, are W it— the novelty of the thought gratifying th is
organ, and the plausibility Imagination. In even serious or melancholy circum -
tances and scenes, it strikes on new and mirthful ideas, and thus enables one to
be humorous, when he chooses to indulge its activity.
10. Im itation is delighted when one perceives different things and action
exhibiting marked resemblances or analogies to other known subjects ; and in
manufacturing, to make the same kind of articles exact likenesses of each other;
and in society, to render one’s manners, customs, dress, pronunciation and style
like those associated with. It is offended at oddities, or non-conformity to e s ­
tablished usages and fashions. But oddities, with a sort of necessity, or pror
priety apparent in them, address N ovelty, which absorbs attention. W hen
active, it incites to observe so closely as to imitate precisely, or mimic. B u t if
the imitation witnessed be so perfect as to excite the feeling of identity of the
real or original object, Imitation is no longer gratified.
2 0 . Perfectabijuxtt, or Ideality, is delighted by discovering a high state
o f perfection, utility and good order every where, and incites to neatness and
refinement in person, apartments and deportment. It incites to and delights in
good order o f things and m orals; but is offended at and restrains from slovenli­
ness, obscenity, vulgarity and immorality. It allows not Imagination to con*
template, nor N ovelty to indulge the fancy on obscene or vulgar thoughts, pro­
duces a taste for the neat, pretty and beautiful, and a talent for elegance and
grace. It selects the chaste for, and excludes the vulgar from poetry, and expres-
ses the ideas in happy metaphors, sonorous terms, rhym e and metre. Its sen ­
sations are the test of propriety and decorum.
2 A. Seblimitv delights in oar beholding or contemplating the vast or
powerful, and incites to plan magnanimous schemes, to undertake arduous and
noble enterprises, and to dwell in spacious apartments, from which is an exten­
sive prospect It enlarges one’s aspirations, sphere of action and influence, and
makes one settle on high and healthy sites, where are clear ah' and pure water, and
to live in rooms of such size, that the air w ill not soon become contaminated by
perspiration. W hen engaged on its favorite themes, its pleasurable emotions
are frequently so intense, and so much absorb the nervous energy of the consti­
tution, that the heart intermits its projection of the vital fluid, and the thrilling
chills creep in rapid succession through the veins. A m ong its objects are deep
caverns,high falls, lofty mountains, tremendous storms, grand martial, political,
or charitable movements, the incalculable number and distance of the starry hosts,
and the power, wisdom , goodness and glory of Him who made and governs all,
IN0IT1YES TO PROVIDE FOR AND DEFEND SELF.
22. CAtmotrsNESs is gratified at perceiving every thing in harmony with
our personal safety, the welfare of those that he holds dear, and the success of
favored enterprises, and incites the Perceptives to keep a vigilant watch of en­
dangering things or circumstances, lest one suffer from them. Its deep emotion
on the sudden appearance of great danger, restrains voluntary motion, checks
vital action, and urges circumspection. The strength of the emotion of fear, is

-
in proportion to the greatness and probability of the danger, and the energy o f
the organ. W hen predominant, it affords a strong feeling of fear, even at little
dangers, and thus produces doubt, cowardice, and despondency. W hile Hope
acts as to actions, prospects, plans and future success, this organ as to more im­
m ediate danger and tangible things. Carefulness and circumspection result from
ns activity.
2 3 . Destructiveness incites the intellectual faculties to discriminate those
objects of danger, opposition, hindrance, or inconvenience, whether animate or
inanim ate, which should be met, overcome, or destroyed, and impels its posses­
sor to attack or oppose them on every occasion, and with an energy of feeling
proportionate to the difficulty, and the value of the objects. Its sentiment is to
rem ove or overcome obstacles effectually, but cares not whether by suasive or
gen tle means, or by harsh and forcible, though it prefers the mode safest and
easiest to one’s self. W ith enlightened understanding, and correct moral senti­
m ents, its action is termed proper resentment, or virtuous indignation, or busi­
ness-like energy ; but when directed by weak or depraved judgment, it becomes
opposition, hatred, envy, malice, anger, retaliation, or revenge. W hen strong
and active, it beams throngh the countenance impetuosity, destruction, defiance
and self defence. If connected with enlightened judgem ent and sentiments, it
opposes by the gentlest means, and without wanton injury; yet prevails, if pos­
sib le, and triumphs completely, if the object be worth the pains. It delights in
the rem oval or destruction of the obstacles to one’s happiness, and renders one
resolu te and eager to contend against the troubles which beset life. Sometimes
it is aroused to remove a human opposer, and if it is so large and active as to
absorb the wkole cerebral stimulus, hearing little or none to the incitives to
m ercy and justice, it hurries its possessor on to commit manslaughter. B at if
p ity , regard for divine and human laws, love of character, and fear o f the ven­
geance of others are voluntarily brought into exercise, they w ill almost always
m ak e him invent som e milder manner of attaining his object.
*
2 4 . Secretiveness directs attention to those obstacles which we deem it
n o t safe or expedient to attack or oppose, and incites to be inventive to escape,
avoid , or conceal from those tilings which do not arouse Destructiveness to com­
bat. Its expedients are to keep at a distance, keep one’s own counsel, hide, dis-
gu ise, conceal, feign, prevaricate, deceive, &c., with doing all which it is grati­
fied. But if the other organs be more offended at such conduct, than itself
pleased, it either yields to the danger, gives up the pursuit of its object, or on
second thought, finds out some mode more moral toerade the danger. It affords
tact or cunning as to secresy, both in keeping one’s plans and sentiments con*
cealed, and in discovering the designs, or secreted objects of others.
25. Combativeness renders one vigilant to discover the earliest good op­
portunity to commence each of those things which other organs incite to accom­
plish as soon as circumstances permit, and when they arrive, it incites one to
begin and prosecute the enterprise with appropriate vigor and despatch. By it
o n e determines instantly, and is aroused to action at the precise moment, to put
each part of one’s designs in operation, and to prosecute all parts of business
w ith energy and despatch. From its emotions, the soldier feels when it is ex­
pedient to make his attacks, the moralist to enforce his precepts, the philanthro­
pist his charity, the lover to avow his sentiments, the farmer to sow or reap,
and finally, every one who feels a something impelling him to immediate efforts, f *

or despatch of business, or amusements. If very active, one is inclined to com­
bat for insignificant considerations, but if inactive, he is dilatory and not expert
in timing well his actions.
26. A cquisitiveness delights in providing means <tf subsistence and grati­
fication, and incites the body and mind to exert them selves in the most vigorous
and intelligent manner to procure them. The pursuit of wealth, trading and
economy delight i t ; nor can it be satiated with riches, for, like the appetite, its
cravings need be gratified daily by new , and the ordinary amount o f acquire­
ments. Its sentiment is to accumulate property, leaving the honesty o f the
manner to be regulated by the Moral Incitives. Its longings for accumula­
tions drive one out to business, if it be strong; but if it be weak, one w ill mani­
fest but little tact> talent, or energy in pecuniary affairs.
27. Constructiveness is delighted with mechanical inventions and opera­
tions, and incites the intellectual faculties to conceive the moot available or ex­
pedient plans of constructing, improving, repairing, i>r applying any instrument
or machine. W hen one judges a plan of performing physical labor to be the
most expedient, this organ is exercised by a pleasurable emotin, which im pres­
ses the plan on one's memory, and confidence in its expediency, when he wants
only for Combatireness to stimulate when to begin. When large and active, it
stimulates and controls the Perceptives so effectually, that they manifest more
intelligence and judgment in the mechanical operations and inventions, than on
other subjects. On this principle, one may be a sage on some subjects, but a
dunce on all others ; as a good mechanic may be a miserable financier or politi­
cian, et vice versa. A ll mechanical operations and successful applications of
labor gratify it, however small or sim ple, but it is displeased at awkward appli­
cations of labor, or ill contrived buildings, machinery, or instruments, and is
uneasy to im prove them.
INCITIVES TO SOCIABLENESS.
T hese organs are all constituted to operate in a manner precisely analogous,
but are directed towards different objects. Attachments to their several objects
form in proportion to their attractive qualities, the length of time and frequency
of perceiving them, the pains taken for their benefit, and the vigor of the organs
but is pained at the injury, displeasure, or long absence of its objects of
affection.
28. Inhabitiveness becomes attached to places and inanimate objects, and
delights to perceive them frequently; but is painfully exercised when far and
long from familiar objects. It produces attachment to home and country, de­
lights to meditate on them, and to visit the scene of one's nativity or former
residence; but renders one uneasy or home-sick on going abroad, till other ob­
jects and organs absorb the whole attention and cerebral stimulus, so that
this organ be prevented from sensation.
• .
29. Adhesiveness contracts friendship and attachment to adults of one’s
ow n sex, delights to perceive them frequently, and in happy condition; it in­
cites to befriend, assist, console and render them happy,Rnd even to incommode
one’s self in benefitting them, in proportion to the strength of the attachment
It produces tact and disposition to be sociable, and to cultivate the friendship of
others. Its emotions are felt on m eeting a long absent acquaintance.

3 0 . genitiveness is the organ of attachment to youth, children
a n d pets, delights at w itnessing their presence and sports, and incites to assist,
h u m o r , gratify and improve them in proportion to the attachment It produces
t a c t and delight to see and occasionally associate with children, to amuse, teach,
g o v e r n and obtain the friendship and esteem of them.
3 1 . Philetebagenitiveness is the medium of attachment to adults o f the
o th e r sex— is delighted with their presence, and incites to cultivate their so­
c i e t y and friendship. It affords the sensibility by which one sex judges of and
a d m ires the charms of the other, and talent and disposition to be affable, socia­
b le , gentle, courteous, agreeable and winning in one's manners or etiquette to­
w a r d s individuals of the other sex. The qualities attractive to this organ are
b e a u ty of form, size and com plexion, grace of movements, sweetness o f voice,
e x c elle n c e of understanding, education, refinement, health, respectability o f
fa m ily and occupation, personal attention to one’s self, and due respect towards
a ll, discreetness, enterprise, consistency, mirthfulness on proper occasions,
k in d n ess, ardour of affection, &c. T he more of these, and the greater degree of
th em one exhibits, and through the more senses perceived, the quicker and stron­
g e r attachment forms.
T h e nervous fluid, or animal stimulus is supposed to be galvanism, generated
in th e stomach and lungs, and discharged abroad by muscular and cerebral &e~
lio n , after it has performed its office, em itting ligtit, as when the galvanic or
electric fluid is passed in a dark room, from one conductor to another, marking
th e transmission by an intense light. So the action of the fluid of sensation in
th e brain appears through the countenance, but especially through the eyes,
w h ic h sotnetimes glare in a perfectly dark room. Again the discharges, during
in ten se action, of different organs, are distinguished and indicated by the ex­
pressions of countenance. If now the electric fire o f the happy action of this
organ beams from the eyes of one, and falls into the senses of the eyes of an ad­
m irer, it kindles a flame of admiration, and glow of social feeling, which warms
th e heart, and attracts around it the strong cords of noble love, which may soon
becom e conjugal affection. Since vision is indistinct at great distances, conver­
sation far off not audible, and the sense of feeling can embrace only near objects,
friends are most happy in each other’s immediate presence, where their charms
m ak e the most vivid and deep impressions. W ith that peiyon, at whose pres­
en ce these feelings are most intense and reciprocal, an alliance is sought, in
w h ich they may enjoy each ethers society continually and exclusively, and
m arriage is proposed.
INCITIYES TO CORRECT MORALS.
32. Benevolence delights in the welfare of every sentient being, incites
to relieve their sufferings, and increase their happiness. To this organ the sight
o f the sufferings of others is excruciating pain, and impels its posses­
sor to pity and exert one’s self to render sufferers comfortable, to remove or
destroy the causes of their sorrow, and the obstacles to their enjoyment. It ren­
ders one kindly disposed towards all, and enables one to distinguish and bestow
true and accceptable benefits, and promote the pleasure of every creature. It is
opposed to cruelty, severity, harshness of intercourse, and intolerance of free
discussion, and liberty of opinion.
33. Subobdination, or Veneration, incites the Perceptives to observe such
beings, laws or institutions, as to which w e ought to exercise obedience, defer
Digitized by Google
14
ease, submission, or respect, and delights to perceive proper subordination, a n d
due respect to all, and veneration, submission and resignation to the divine w ill.
It is offended at irreverence towards God, disobedience to parents, civil m a g is ­
trates, religious institutions and ministers, insubordination on military affairs,
disrespect to teachers, the aged, talented and virtuous, and disregard o f th e
rights of any creature. It is also offended at any servile subserviency, a n d
m akes one distinguish whomywhat and how much one ought, under his circu m ­
stances, to respect, regard or contemn various objects.
34. Authoritiveness, or Self Esteem , stimulates the Perceptives to d e ­
termine in what circumstances, to what extent, and over what persons, anim als,
and inanimate ob/ects one may exercise authority or power ; and delights in d is ­
covering men, animals and things subject to one’s control or influence. It in ­
cites and delights one to command, preside, direct or advise, and enables to act
w ith dignity, and to conduct one’s self constantly so as to secure the greatest in-
fluence. It is offended at being compelled to serve or obey another, and restrains
one from sports or occupations, by which personal influence may be lessen ed .
W hen Subordination incites to yield or obey another, the Perceptives and m in d
are occupied by it, and do not awaken this organ to a sense of another’s p ow er,
and then one submits with dignity. W hen active under weak intellectual p o w ­
ers, it frequently tends to pride, insubordination, presumption, and dom ineering,
and exercises itself in selfish and m onopolizing transactions. It is gratified by
every successful exertion of one’s mental or bodily powers.
35. A pprobativeness affords pleasure at seeing others approve or adm ire
our personal appearance, dress, behavior, occupation, skill, education, manners,
accomplishments, &c. It incites to conduct and deal with people in such a man­
ner as to please, and win esteem ; produces a turn of mind to be affable, courte­
ous and agreeable to all. In seeking praise and commendation, it incites to do
thousands of friendly, benevolent or fashionable acts in public, such as are popu­
lar— defends character by arousing Destructiveness, and is irritated at being
neglected, slighted or ridiculed. It gives tact to eulogise or flatter.
36. Firmness makes one careful to distinguish those circumstances in w hich
one should exercise perseverance, or continue in action those mental or bodily
organs which are then acting, and suppress the operation of others. It produ­
ces perseverance in undertakings and enterprises, tenacity to sentiments, op in ­
ions and principles, which makes one argue still though confuted; firmness and
steadiness of nerve and purpose; but is displeased at change of pursuit and pu r
pose, or slackening or agitation of mind and nerves, on sudden excitem ent-
B ut if the mind judges a change of conduct or principles necessary, this organ
takes no offence.
37. Conscientiousness, while the other organs incite, direct, and deligh
us in all the employments for which our constitutions adapt us, presides over
them all, lest two or more organs incite us to different actions at the same time,
making us bound to double business, and doing neither. This organ breaks off
the hesitation, by throwing its influence on the side which the mind judges
most worthy, giving it a preponderence sufficient to move us to action, and to
withdraw the attention from other pursuits. Hence it disposes us always to act
in accordance with our bestJudgment, and to be conscientious about every ac­
tion. It is disgusted at, and restrains from vice and immorality. Yet its ad­
monitions and restraints may sonctimes be overcome by organs strongly and

su d d e n ly excited with a weak or depraved understanding. I f one frequently
a c ts contrary to the dictates of this sentiment, it soon becomes torpid and dor­
m a n t, so as to prevent painful sensations.
LOCATIONS OF ORGANS.
S in ce the situation and extent of but few organs can be definitely pointed out
b y evident and constant parts of the skull, it is deemed expedient to give a geo*
m etrical statement of the positions. A s the situation of a place on the earth is
k n o w n from its longitude and lattitude, so is any organ, from its distance in de­
g r e e s from the plane o f the Tentorium, and from the Falx. The falx passes
b ack and forwards, over the top of the brain, attached to the skull, and projecting
d o w n into the brain about three-fourths of an inch, thus marking it off into
r ig h t and left hemispheres. T he Tentoruim is a membrane attached in the same
m anner, and cutting the falx at right angle*, and extending in so as to divide the
b rain down to the Medula Oblongata, or branching out point; thus partitioning
o ff th e Antesorium from the brain proper. These planes cut or cross each other
at th e Occipit, or small sharp prominence at the back of the head. Distance from
th e Oeeipit reckoned along the falx, around a centre midway between the ex*
tern al opening of the ears, is Occipital D istance; and from the falx to the right
or le ft towards the ears is Falxal Distance. The Suture across Inhabitiveness is
u su ally 35 degrees O. D ., and across Subordination 90 degrees 0 . D. B ut
w h e r e they are more or less distant, the organs around must be considered as
proportionably increased or diminished in 0 . D. T he right and left parts o f
e v e r y organ occupy eorresponding parts of each hemisphere.
I n the table, the first, seeond, fourth and fifth columns give the lim its o f the
rgan s, and the third and sixth, the point at which the Cephalometer is to be
adjusted to measure the length of the fibres, the seventh the usual length, and
Ih e last is to insert the measurements o f particular person.
