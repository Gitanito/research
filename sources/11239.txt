  		              		Experience Description   

  I had just finished kickboxing and then showered. I went outside to have some refreshments and my toes and fingers began to curl and cramp. I knew I was low of potassium/ magnesium but thought that after I ate, it would be okay.   About an hour later, I changed into my pajamas, and was sitting on the couch. 

  One minute I was talking to my husband and then next minute, I was in another dimension. I was surrounded by incredibly bright light that was  loving and welcoming. Inside the light was my deceased dad, who looked younger than he did before he transitioned. He had a big smile on his face. I couldn't get close to him but I was so happy to see him that I couldn't stop smiling. I knew that the light was aware and conscious because I could feel it. When I looked down, my body was light beams. I was wearing a gown of light. Although I had all my worldly senses, I had no physical body. My dad had a physical body though. I assume that it so  I could recognize him. I was told telepathically that I had to go back and complete my mission. 

  The next thing I knew, I was in the emergency room with lights shining in my face and people staring down at me. It definitely wasn't the warm, welcoming light I had just come from.   I was upset that I was back in my physical body because I was so happy and felt loved on the other side. I will never forget that experience. 

It took me a while to acclimatize back into this dimension.  My body felt heavy and dense.  On the other side I was free, light, and so very loved.

I was angry to be back.

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I had always heard of the 'light' but didn't understand it until I experienced it. The light was alive, conscious and loving. I believed it to be a higher being or God.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     We definitely live on and thrive in another dimension other than earth. This I am now certain of.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I encountered my deceased dad who died 50 years ago.

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I knew that physical death is nothing at all. We continue to live on in other dimensional frequencies.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I am not religious but I know that I am a spiritual being, and whatever I do in my life time will be reflected back to me in a life review. I want to be proud of my mission when its completed.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am more understanding with family members instead of getting angry at their inability to understand that life exist after physical death.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There are no words in our language that can fully describe the way I felt when I was on the other side. Loving, warm, safe, just aren't accurate enough. We don't have the vernacular yet, and not sure we ever will.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember it like it happened yesterday and it was 3 years ago. I don't remember much about events leading up to it except that I was outside with my husband and then came in and got my pajamas on.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I have become more empathic, and can sense when things are going to happen before they occur.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Seeing my deceased dad again and knowing that he will be there as well as other loved ones gives me such joy. We will be reunited again.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It was approximately a year before I said anything to anyone other than my neurologist.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I had heard of them and talked to some mediums who had the experience. None were like mine however.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real.     I didn't want to say anything to anyone because I knew they would think I was making it up.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I had my experienced confirmed by several well documented evidential mediums like Susanne Wilson.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         N/A
