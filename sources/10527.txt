  		              		Experience Description   

  My NDE occurred on June 11, 1991. I took an overdose of medication after being bullied at school.  Of course, I kept this quiet from my family.

  The part that really stood out for me was going down the golden stairs to my sacred place in the forest, and being greeted by what appeared to be transparent, white, oblong-faced aliens or maybe angels. They were helping me down the stairs while holding my hand and treating me as a princess.  They led me to my deceased maternal grandfather. 

  The number of details I was able to witness from the viewpoint of an observer was surreal. I thoroughly remember my deceased maternal grandfather, myself, and my two daughters Tea’ra and Candice, who wouldn’t be born until May 4, 1995 and June 11, 2001.  We were watching from the sky, all of the activities going on in the emergency room to try to save my body.  It was as if we pulled back the roof of the building so we could view everything simultaneously. I also vividly remember my daughters trying to convince me to return to my body so they could be born in the near future. My youngest daughter was especially  pleading with me because she had a very important purpose to fulfill. My grandfather also pleaded with me and reassured me that he would always be with me and he would send me back with special spiritual gifts that would truly help many people. After much pleading from maternal grandfather and my two daughters, I reluctantly decided to go back into my body for good.  

   I was going in and out of my body due to being in a coma for 2 days.   I woke up to a blond-haired  nurse who was pinching me to wake up. Needless to say, I didn’t like this so I woke up. I was very confused, because I was expecting my maternal grandfather to be there in the room with me since I had just seen him. But my mom had to keep reminding me that he was dead. He died at the age of 61 during surgery on September 7, 1987 from a aneurysm that burst in his stomach.
  
  					Since my NDE, I have become spiritually gifted. My family is still amazed at how I am able to read people with accuracy and also how I am able to feel the energy of somebody when they are thinking about me directly, no matter the distance or location.                                               

Dr. Jeff:   Your experience will be informative and inspirational vast number of people. Your experience involved, at the age of 15, meeting children that would be born in the future. I would appreciate it if you could answer some questions I have. Did your children that were later born have any recollection of meeting you before they were born?  When you met your children to be born future during your NDE, or they both female? I understand that you later had two daughters. Did you have any other children in addition to these two? Any additional details that you would care to share regarding this remarkable aspect of your NDE would be greatly appreciated!                      

  Natalie:              Thank you for your compliments and your questions. Unfortunately, my daughters don’t remember being with me before they were born (and yes they are my only children). The only correlation that can link them to my NDE is the birthdate of my youngest daughter which was exactly 10 years after my NDE (my NDE was June 11, 1991 and she was born on June 11, 2001)  I obtained a copy of my hospital discharge summary from 1991  and this date was confirmed.
