   by Jody, NDERF         </p>                  This introductory material discusses SoulMates from the perspective of current literature on the subject.  Different types of romantic relationships have different interactions between couples depending on the lessons that both partners need to learn.  The interactions consist of karmic, dharmic, and twin flames.   There are common NDE truths about relationships when comparing NDE  accounts.  We have included several quotes from contributors regarding love, relationships, and spiritual growth.  These quotes are used to form a preliminary definition of Soulmates, which is   			'a loving relationship manifesting spiritual growth.'&nbsp;      Click here for  Article (English),   			    Cliquez ici   pour l  '  or   article (F  ran√ßaise).   </p>

    Love     &amp; Respect     by Jody 8/4/02

    A Review of the Study: Respect in Close     Relationships:&nbsp; Prototype Definition, Self-Report Assessment, and Initial     Correlates, J. Frei and P. Shaver, Personal Relationships, 9 (2002),     121-139.&nbsp; Here is a quick,     &nbsp;review of   an insightful     study on respect and how it figures in relationships.&nbsp;     Interestingly, marriage counselors hear about the two main issues in a     marriage as being love and respect, but respect and aspects of respect have     never been scientifically studied or defined until now.&nbsp;   Click here for  Article                 FUNNY FACT&nbsp;    &nbsp; In the 1500's most people got married     in June because they took their yearly bath in May and still smelled pretty     good by June. However, they were starting to smell, so brides carried a     bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor.    </b>

    Here's a Great Relationships     Story!

    A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some     items in front of him.&nbsp; When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large     empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the top,     rocks about 2&quot; diameter.&nbsp; He then asked the students if the jar was full?&nbsp;     They agreed that it was.

    So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured     them in to the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled     into the open areas between the rocks. The students laughed.&nbsp; He asked     his students again if the jar was full? They agreed that yes, it was.

    The professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it     into the jar.&nbsp; Of course, the sand filled up everything else.&nbsp; He     then asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was. He     proceeded to pour a cup of wine into the jar and shook it as the wine slipped     between all the sand.
    
    &quot;Now,&quot; said the professor, &quot;I want you to recognize that this is your life.&nbsp;     The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health,     your children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost, you     would be nearly destroyed.

    The pebbles are the other things in life that matter, but     on a smaller scale. The pebbles represent things like your job, your house,     your car.

    The sand is everything else, the small stuff.&nbsp; If you     put the sand or the pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for the     rocks. The same goes for your life.&nbsp; If you spend all your energy and     time on the small stuff, material things, you will never have room for the     things that are truly most important.&nbsp; Pay attention to the things that     are critical in your life.&nbsp;    Play with your children. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be     time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the     disposal.&quot;

    Take care of the rocks first - the things that really     matter.&nbsp; Set your priorities.
    The rest is just pebbles and sand. And remember, there is always room for     wine.

  &nbsp;  Soulmate Experiences and Comments: &nbsp;  
         	73.&nbsp;   	            Cait SMR  2/11/18&nbsp; When I was 16 he tried again. HE HAD KEPT ALL OUR LETTERS! We had a mutual friend that he used to try to reconnect us but a terrible misunderstanding caused her not to deliver the message as she was afraid I would hurt him. He knew something didn't feel right so he asked her to point out my locker so he could return the old letters and a new one. Unfortunately, what still remains a mystery today is I never got them.&nbsp;  
   Soulmates connecting against the odds.&nbsp;

             	72.&nbsp;   	            Michael SMR  7/3/17&nbsp; Now, I never considered Tom as my soul mate until somewhat recently.  I have had many issues throughout our marriage.  Depression, alcoholism, and much worse.  He has stood by me through it all.  One day, as I was feeling particularly insecure, I implored him to tell me one reason why he loved me.  He said, "I don't need a reason.  I love you because you are you.  Unconditionally."  He has said we are soul mates.  This is a strange thing for him to say as he is a very practical and scientific person.&nbsp;  
   Soulmates and timing issues.&nbsp;

   Soulmates through thick and thin.&nbsp;

70.&nbsp;           Judy &amp; Mike 7/21/11&nbsp;   I first met Judy at a church dance in 1960 she had asked me to dance while I was   holding her in my arms during this slow dance I had a very strange feeling as if   I had known this person before. After the dance I asked if I could walk her home   as we talked along the way&nbsp;every thing about her seemed to be so familiar, it   was wonderful to hear her voice and see her smile, after we reached her home I   asked her out and told her how I felt that I had know her all my life she smiled   and replied that she somehow felt the same. (Judy was fifteen and I was sixteen)   after our first date I was in a very happy stat of mind and told her before   leaving that I thought one day we would be marred she replied with a big grin   well we'll see. One year after high school graduation we were married, we have   been together ever since to old souls who found each outer at a tender age.&nbsp;  
   Soulmates who recognize each other very young.

69.&nbsp;             QDO SMR 6/11/11&nbsp;The   Native American man led the way through my two-room space, as if he knew the   layout, and motioned for us to sit on the floor in a circle and he took out a   peace pipe. I was waiting for them to explain who they were and why'd they'd   come. He lit the pipe and they all smoked from it. I refused when it came my   turn and the man kept pushing me to smoke. The young man laughed and that pissed   me off. I remember giving him a wicked look. I smoked and the Native American   man said, &quot;Remember him.&quot; And I woke up so confused because I thought I was   awake!
  A NDEr who had many precognitive dreams of her   soulmate prior to meeting him.

68.&nbsp;             Michelle SMR 5/6/11&nbsp;     I   then found myself somewhere else, and that's when the main &quot;thing&quot; happened.   &quot;He&quot; ran to me, he didn't have a face that I could see but he had a lean   athletic form. &quot;He&quot; ran into me and we became one and then I felt something I   have never felt before...strong vibrations...I didn't want for it to stop. I   loved him and I didn't want for him to leave. My entire body vibrated and I can   not ever explain the feeling to anyone. I do not know how to explain. He then   went away. I felt myself go back into my body. Then I left again. I started to   chase a form &amp; I &quot;heard&quot; or understood a voice that told me not to follow him. I   remember some time during this I felt very scared. I was going back into my body   &amp; that is when I saw my face. I saw my face like I was another person looking at   me and I went back into my body. I then felt the strong vibrations again. I can   not explain how they felt...there are no words...I know I felt peace. &nbsp; 
  Felt separated from body.&nbsp; Frequent   vibrations.&nbsp; Felt she met herself in a different form.&nbsp;

67.    	  		  		  		Julie M SMR                		5/5/11 </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>  	</font>    </font>    		  		I met my husband 7 years ago in college. He's from Oregon, I'm from   		Maine. My husband was free to attend any college of his choice, the   		small school he chose was sort of on a whim. I chose the college for   		financial reasons. I didn't fall in love with my husband at first, in   		fact he sort of irritated me. We would hang out as friends, but I didn't   		want a serious relationship. My husband and I grew closer as we went   		through the school year. As summer loomed closer we knew we would be   		saying goodbye. Neither of us wanted to attend the same college the next   		year. My husband went back to Oregon, I stayed in Maine. We talked   		everyday, both of us felt profoundly alone and lost without the other.   		After a month apart, I bought a plane ticket to Oregon. My husband and I   		have been together ever since. We have had many exciting experiences   		together, hiking some of the Appalachian trail, working on an organic   		farm in Idaho, living in Washington DC, touring Italy etc. We are   		expecting our first child in June. We truly inspire each other and are   		stronger in this life because we have each other. We face the everyday   		stresses and major tragedies of life together, it makes all the   		difference. We are a team.         		66.&nbsp;                    		  		Olivia &amp; Rich SMR                		3/14/11&nbsp;    		            	                                		Hi I met Rich when I first came to Ohio. We were so in love we adored   		each other. But some how we lost contact for 15 years and I got married.   		My husband and I was together for 10 years then he passed away. For 5   		years I didn't date because I was afraid of being hurt again.&nbsp; But 2010   		my son and I went to Wal-Mart and I saw Rich my soul mate. We hug as if   		we didn't want to let go. He then gave me his phone number and said call   		me I will always love you. I was afraid but I called 3 days later we   		talked 20 minutes. We didn't talk any more for about 2 weeks and this   		was in December. But at 1:45am New Years day I got a call to meet him   		for breakfast and we have been talking and seeing each other every   		sense. He keep telling me how much he loves me and I already know I love   		him he said to me Baby you are my Soul mate.
  		Back together after 30 years.
  		
  		65.&nbsp;                    		  		  		Mike &amp; Noelle SMR                		  		  		  		  		  		11/29/10   		              	                            The greatest blessing and miracle of it all...While I was still in the hospital a month after the accident, I desperately needed to leave the hospital to travel to a relative who was in a life-threatening crisis but I was told I could not go unless accompanied by a doctor or nurse so I prayed for to God for a nurse to become available and assist me in my travel....Well guess what? I found one or should I say God sent me one and..... and we fell in love instantly, were married a couple years later and now my "nurse" Noelle is my wife and we have a blessed beautiful little boy named Alexander.

  		  		  		  		  		   		  		  		  		  		  		64.&nbsp;                    		  		Chris SMR                		  		  		  		  		  		11/26/10    		            	                        I was talking to my husband of 1 year   		about how odd our meeting was. I was 48 years old when I met him and I   		had been divorced for 3 years. As soon as I laid eyes on him, I KNEW he   		was my soulmate. He didn't utter a word, he hadn't even looked at me,   		but a bolt shot through my body &amp; I knew I had met the only man I've   		ever really loved. I went into the ladies' room &amp; said several prayers   		asking God to help me figure out how to meet this man! What is this??? I   		never understood such thing could be possible, and then I read about   		this on your webpage! I am astonished. For a long time now, I've   		wondered why I was struck SO hard, especially at my age!&nbsp; My   		husband didn't recognize me as his soulmate, although he was attracted   		to me &amp; we had a long conversation. It took him a bit longer to   		recognize me, I guess, but within a couple of dates, he knew as well.

  		  		  		  		   		  		  		  		  		  		63.&nbsp;                    		  		Crystal G SMR                		  		  		  		  		  		11/20/10    		            	                    I had moved to Oklahoma to go to college in January of 2003. My father   		had always lived there and I had these grand ideas of how close we would   		be if I lived closer to him. Unfortunately, I ended up feeling rejected   		and being the loneliest I had ever been in my entire life. I was waiting   		tables while going to school and when a new girl started we became   		friends very quickly. On St. Patrick's day, even though I was already in   		my PJ's with no make up on, she convinced me to go to a party with her.   		I don't know why I went, I was never a social butterfly. When we got to   		the parking lot of the apartment where the party was being held the   		first thing I saw was a guy standing under the street lamp and messing   		with his cell phone. I directed my friends attention to him, he was   		unlike anyone that I had ever seen. Like something was pulling me to   		him. My friend knew him and introduced us right away. We spent the   		entire night talking to each other. We found out that he grew up an hour   		and a half north of where I had, his parents had the same first names as   		my mother's parents (weird) and he had been dragged to the party as   		well. That night when it was time to go we exchanged information and   		promised to see each other the next day. His best friend at the time   		still loves to tease him about their ride home that night. He told him   		over and over that he knew he was going to marry me. And he did, not   		quite 8 months later. Our families thought we were moving too fast, that   		we were too young, and had no idea what we were doing, but we just had   		our 7 year wedding anniversary and couldn't be more in love. I didn't   		believe in love at first sight until I met him...my soulmate.

  		  		  		   		  		  		  		  		  		62.&nbsp;                    		  		Casey SMR                		  		  		  		  		  		10/22/10    		            	                    		Six months later,&nbsp;after two years of   		interviewing and job hunting, I was finally offered a job and jumped on   		the opportunity to&nbsp;get away from a bad work environment. That's where I   		met him. From the first time we met, I knew there was something very   		special about him. I enjoyed our conversations so much. We ate lunch   		together almost everyday.&nbsp;At first it wasn't physical attraction or   		romantic. We were just instantly&nbsp;best friends,&nbsp;kindred spirits.

  		  		   		  		  		  		  		  		61.&nbsp;                    		  		  		Angel &amp; Glenn SMR                  		    	    		09/25/10              	            On   		April 21,2010&nbsp; Glenn and I reconnected again through Face book and When I   		received that Friend request from him I couldn't believe it was really   		him, I cried so hard when I seen his picture, especially when he told   		him how could he forget me after all I was the one who visited him most   		after his surgery back then. I told him that night how much I had loved   		him all these years and he felt the same for me and we both decided we   		wanted to be&nbsp; together and we've been inseparable every since. chatting   		on cam/voice or on the phone or through messengers. On August 5th 2010   		he moved from Georgia to Tennessee and came and got me and We've been   		together and so very happy every since, and it's living proof that A   		first love does last forever...

  		   		  		  		  		  		  		60.&nbsp;                    		  		Kristin &amp; Matt SMR                  		    	    		07/17/10              	            		I moved to Florida when I was 22 to   		help my parents through a divorce.&nbsp; I was having difficulty finding a   		job and applied just about everywhere I went.&nbsp; I finally took a job   		waitressing at a Bennigan's even though I had been offered the job there   		two weeks prior. I rejected it then because the manager said they were   		not very busy and he couldn't offer me a lot of hours.&nbsp; However, it was   		the only thing available after endless searching and something kept   		telling me to go back.&nbsp; It was as if I were being &quot;called there&quot; and   		perhaps that is why I could not find another job. . . .

  		   		  		  		  		  		  59.&nbsp;                    		  		Amanda G SMR                		    	      		06/27/10              	        I've known my soulmate almost my entire life. A young man that used to   		sit behind me in Elementary School (3rd Grade to be exact) would look at   		me and say &quot;you're gonna be my wife one day&quot; of course he had no clue   		what a wife was...In short, we lost contact for over 30+ years. He   		looked for me, found me, and we're getting married this year. I am   		completely in love with him and am happy that he never gave up on his   		childhood love.&nbsp;

   		  		  		  		  		  58.&nbsp;                    		  		Gayle SMR                  		    	    		01/26/10              	    Two   		years later my son and I, along with my childhood friend, unexpectedly   		found ourselves at a mutual friend's house.&nbsp; The three of us were   		instantly attracted to one another.&nbsp; My little boy, who was very   		standoffish with the men I had dated after divorcing, immediately   		climbed into his lap and called him daddy.&nbsp; A year and a half later we   		were married; two weeks after the wedding, my husband adopted my son.&nbsp;

  		  		  		57.&nbsp;   	    		Jenna SMR   	&nbsp;01/09/10              		I met Chris in 2004 right before my NDE. I knew&nbsp; I liked him, but could   		not see past myself. We stayed friends and I floundered through some bad   		relationships. Well, 2 years ago I got a divorce which to me was it!!! I   		dated but I never found someone I liked. I always found something wrong   		with them. I was talking to Chris and we decided to get together. (We   		had decided to do it before several times but for one reason another it   		did not work out). As I drove to his house I told myself that this would   		probably be like all the past dates and not to get my hopes up. Well, as   		I pulled up to his house and saw him I had the most amazing feeling   		inside. I knew that I never wanted to be without him again. He was home.   		I cannot describe the feeling at all. It is so sweet and gentle. We had   		talked before this and we just thought that it was amazing that we had   		lived in the same places at the same time on a few occasions. We went to   		the same High School, we lived In Dallas, Texas at the same time and   		even in Florida at the same&nbsp; time. &nbsp;We are best friends. I feel a   		completion that I have never felt before and I know my search is over.   		It's amazing.

          56.&nbsp;                      Crystal &amp; Tommy SMR                        	04/24/09           While I am young (just 20) I have   been lucky enough to have met my true soulmate almost 2 years ago now who I have   the most incredible, amazing magical connection I ever dreamed possible with   someone. I am a very deep soul, and so is he, and we had both dreamed about   exactly what our soulmate would be like 7 years ago, and we were the person the   other was dreaming about all those years ago. It is truly incredible! I have   been with him for a year and a half now.

        55.&nbsp;     	    	  Donald S SMR   	&nbsp;03/08/09              I met my soulmate when I was a handsome young   lad of fifteen, selling mistletoe at a shopping center. That's what we called   them before the term Shopping Mall was coined. She walked past me and I knew   in&nbsp;that instant that she was different from any girl I had ever met. It was love   at first sight. I sold her a baggie of mistletoe for her phone number. I knew   that she was a girl who I would love and hoped that she would love me in   return.&nbsp;

      54.&nbsp;   	    	Rita B SMR   	&nbsp;03/08/09          I love your   website and enjoy reading it.&nbsp; I would like to share my story of how I met my   husband, whom I know is a soul mate.&nbsp; It was June of 2000 I first meet my   husband in a dream.&nbsp; The dream was very intimate.&nbsp; I saw just his eye's and we   shared a kiss.&nbsp; That is all the dream was....a kiss.&nbsp; I woke up in love with the   man in this dream.&nbsp; I thought about him every day until the day I meet him about   3 month later.&nbsp; It was a day I had off from work,&nbsp; However, I was asked to go   in.&nbsp;&nbsp; After work my friend asked me to go out for a drink.&nbsp; I wanted to go one   place she wanted to go to another.&nbsp; She won so we went to the place she wanted   to go.&nbsp; I was there for about 30 minutes and in walks the man from my dream.&nbsp; I   was stunned.&nbsp; My heart raced and I told my friend that the man from the dream I   had told her about 3 months earlier just walked in the door.&nbsp; &nbsp; I finally went   and introduced myself to him.&nbsp; We married in February 2001.&nbsp; It's now been   married to him for 8 wonderful years.&nbsp; He is truly my soul mate.

  53.&nbsp;   	    	  	Peggy &amp; Jeff S SMR    	  	  	English   	expanded version    	12 /22/2008    &nbsp;Three years after I began the process   to look for this man, a woman came into my life, and we got into this   conversation that had been a yearly discussion for me. I told her my story, and   I told her who I was looking for. And she said she knew this man and would   introduce me to him. . . When we met, it was gradual and instant...gradually   knowing this person again and instantly recognizing that this was the person I   was looking for.
  Wonderful story with an NDEr and a   soulmate - just in time for Christmas.

Brynda SMR.&nbsp;    		6 /19/08             		                                 	  		      	                I went to shut off the   computer and suddenly his chat popped up, he said &quot;Hi Beautiful&quot; . I was so   excited. We chatted for a couple of hours and when I had to go to bed I said   &quot;Teach me a beautiful word in Hopi&quot;. There was a pause, then came back the word   &quot;Ladimina&quot;. I asked him what it meant and he said &quot;Bright Star&quot;!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;   Again, bout fell off my chair. Our liaison continued for a week or so, then   morphed to phone conversations. Everything was as if we had known each other   forever. 2 weeks later I went to meet him in Flagstaff, AZ. We had planned to   just meet but it was so amazing I followed him to his house on 3rd mesa and   spent the night. 1 week later he said I love you. I am a complete commitment   phoebe but I blurted it out too!&nbsp; **It was at that point that it had been 7   months since I had heard that and that he was the 4th guy I dated since the   divorce!&nbsp;

  		  		   		  		50.   		   		  		  		  		Lisa R SMR.&nbsp;    		1 /31/08     		         		                                     	  		      	                		I had no idea   		the things that where happening where pieces of a puzzle falling   		together that would change my life forever. I spun around and hit his   		leg with mine. I began with the I'm sorry looking up to see what was   		hidden under that hat. Holding my breath, I saw his eyes fixed on me,   		finally unhidden. The structure of his face was strong, sexy and his   		smile captivated me. He was and is so charming. It was if we where the   		only two  people</a> there.   		As he looked at me his eyes took a soft warm shape. He was reading right   		into my heart. He reached his hand out over mine completely covering it.   		Gently he lifted my hand to his lips and softly laid a kiss there. Lost   		in this moment I was hanging on every word he said &quot; Its a pleasure my   		lady.&quot; Chills ran over me. It took me a second to comprehend I was   		holding my breath. We saw each other over the next few months and found   		that we where so very much alike. The   		time< that I spent with him   		never seemed to be enough. I will never forget the first   		  		time he said he loved me.

   		  		48.   		   		  		  		  		Marie O SMR.&nbsp;    		8 /17/07     		         		                                     	  		      	        		  		I knew the   marriage was doomed and I was coming to terms the idea that I would be leaving.   About this time I was at my sister's house in another town. She had a pool in   her back yard with patio lanterns across the deck. Lots of people have those.   This day there was a knock at her door and she said, &quot;Oh, that's Ashley, our   neighborhood computer programmer. He's good looking.&quot; As she went down the   stairs to answer the door I peeked over into the stairwell to get a look at this   guy. Hmmm, not bad. I didn't think anymore about it. &nbsp;

Samantha SMR.&nbsp;    		8 /17/07         		                                     		     	  		    When I first met him, I could see a   		white light surrounding him and was overjoyed to see him. This was   		ridiculous in the earthly plane because I did not know he was a teacher,   		or would be my teacher, and he seemed too humble to be a college   		teacher, but he was. I believe another teacher that he was good friends   		with, had recognized the soul mate syndrome, because he introduced us   		and told me that it would be good for this teacher to have me as a   		student because he was losing faith in what he was doing because of the   		changing personalities of the younger classmates coming in. So, I went   		in to this soul mate relationship on earth believing I was helping   		guiding and supporting this teacher, who turned my life around and gave   		me courage to continue on when my life was unraveling. 
  		Two soul mates that are part   		of her soul cluster group rather than romantic soul mates.

We ended up giving him a   		ride home. Lo &amp; Behold, 5 years later, it turned out that was Peter, the   		man I met at the theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now been married 20 years.&nbsp; Every day   		is amazing, despite ups &amp; downs financially. We've traveled to Scotland,   		Iceland, Germany, Austria &amp; are utterly blessed to have found each   		other.&nbsp; There are so many &quot;coincidences&quot; of times we could've met but   		didn't just yet.&nbsp; 
  		 This story   		is a must read!&nbsp; What an amazing set of universal coincidences!

45.&nbsp;  		Rick B SMR.&nbsp;    		6 /16/07                                           		I just had to share this with someone   		that believes and understands! I met My soulmate 10 years ago, bye   		chance on the internet. I wasn't really looking for anything and she   		wasn't either accept for someone to talk to and listen and maybe help   		with some advice seeing how we were both in bad marriages. We did become   		involved and no matter how we tried to fight it we just couldn't. We   		both began divorce proceedings and when I separated from my wife we had   		an agreement that I would have custody of my two year old son. To make a   		long story short my wife used my son against me as leverage to stay with   		her so I was forced to send my soulmate away. I was devastated but I had   		to do what was best for my son. Ten years passed and I never heard a   		word from her until last November when I got a message on MySpace. All   		it said was I just wanted to say hello and let you know I am ok. I was   		floored because I felt in my heart that she hated me. I wrote her back   		and I was amazed to find out that she was almost at the end of her   		divorce proceedings just as I was. We are together now and will marry in   		July of 2008. The chances of finding your soulmate are so slim but to   		lose them and then get them back to me is truly a miracle.

  		  		   		  		43.&nbsp;Michele         		T  		SMR .   		3/11/07&nbsp;                     	                		In 1989, when I was 23 years old,&nbsp;I was going to a college in RI for   		Culinary Arts. I was lifting a bus bucket and my disc was ruptured in my   		back. I was in pain for an year. I finally went for surgery to have the   		disc&nbsp;surgery, I had to drop out of my classes which I only had two weeks   		left to graduate due to a Professor would not let me take the final   		early. When I did return after 3 months of rest, I also return to work.   		One of my classes, Western Civilization started at 6:30 in the morning.   		I was working till 11:00 at night so I changed the time of the class. My   		future husband also&nbsp; changed his time and was in my class. After a month   		and a half of looking at me across the room, he finally sat next to me.   		We are not in the restaurant business anymore and I think the only   		reason we went to the school was to meet. We have been together for 17   		years and married for 10.

  		   		  		42.&nbsp;Geri         		SMR .   		3/6/07&nbsp;                     	        We came back together the next day,   		realizing that there was something very deep between us, but that we   		realized that it was more spiritual than anything else.&nbsp; We were not   		lusting after each other, it was more like a very deep love.&nbsp; I felt   		like he was my brother (hence, twin soul?).&nbsp; People that we talked   		to would ask &quot;so have you known each other for a long time?&quot; and we   		would say &quot;no, actually we just met yesterday.&quot;&nbsp; When we parted   		that afternoon after the conference was over, I felt a great pain, a   		great wrenching pain in my heart.&nbsp; We hugged goodbye.&nbsp; I felt like I had   		waited my whole life to see him again, only to have to say goodbye after   		two days.&nbsp; I cried on the way home. I felt like I was saying goodbye to   		part of myself.&nbsp;

   		  		41.&nbsp;Anna         		SMR .   		3/4/07                     	      		We erupted in odd   		conversation about our highest passion immediately... the other   		employees just looked at us and walked away, not sure what to think. The   		job didn't matter, who was there didn't matter, what day of the week   		didn't matter, what I was wearing didn't matter. I felt totally seen by   		him.&nbsp;I felt naked in the sense that he saw me, and I relished in it. He   		was looking at me the same way. He was chuckling, laughing...like he   		knew! That made me so nervous. I felt like I was high. I was not acting   		as I normally do. I was almost having an out of body experience because   		I was observing myself, truly amazed in my behavior. I wanted to take   		his hand and walk out of there and start our life, our passion, and   		start doing what&nbsp;our purpose is on this planet. What we are here for. we   		finally found each other.

40.&nbsp;Bua         		SMR .   		2/13/07&nbsp;                       		He said that we belonged together.   		When he disclosed this information, I felt overwhelmed and found it   		difficult to believe. I had a NDE myself around the age of 10, so I   		believed his experience. However, not ready to hear such a story. More   		than anything, I fought it. As friends, he always reassured me that he   		will always be there for me. He said, &quot;One day, you will come home.&quot; I   		thought he was crazy and really puzzled at his confidence. Though we   		didn't stay in touch the whole time due to my serious relationships,   		once a year, he would call or we would go out to eat. He would tell me   		that he loved me and that he is waiting for me to come home, yet knowing   		I am not ready. This went on for 9 years and the whole time, I was   		afraid. Recently, I ended a 2 year relationship. The instance I was   		thinking about him, his best-friend called me. I answered the phone,   		instead to hear his voice on the other end. I felt overwhelmed, feeling   		as if he just read my mind. He came over and we went out to eat the very   		same night. I told him that I wasn't looking for any relationship at the   		moment. 
  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		
  		39.&nbsp;   		James' SMR   		E092606   		11/11/06             This is sad to explain since I have yet to find her since the experience.   		If anyone has had success reconnecting with a lost soulmate, that would   		be a pleasant and uplifting thing to hear about.&nbsp; I was sitting in   		a bank parking lot. I and this woman turn and looked at each other at   		the exact time. We both smiled and locked eyes. She and I were   		completely paralyzed and motionless. I felt my spirit leave my body and   		meet hers about midway. I saw our spirits spinning together and at that   		time I could literally experience her. I knew what she was feeling,   		thinking. It was the greatest moment of joy I have ever experienced in   		my life.&nbsp; We both were very shocked and shaken up to say the least.   		For some reason I cannot remember what she looks like in my memory other   		than that I have always been attracted to woman like her - brown hair,   		petite, shoulder length hair, etc. Unfortunately, we were to shocked or   		shy to introduce our selves. Does anyone think we may reconnect someday?&nbsp;   		My heart cries out to find her everyday.&nbsp; Maybe she will stumble on   		this. Thanks&nbsp; James in Flowood, Mississippi
  		
  		38.&nbsp;Rich   		&amp; Martina's         		SMR .   		7/29/06&nbsp;                     		I feel not only that we are soulmates but ultimately one soul. I love her more than any one man could love another woman, she is my everything, she consumes me and completes me. I am grateful for every moment spent with her and I look forward to our life together with assurance that we will be together forever and an understanding of what it truly means to be a soulmate in love.
  		
  		37.&nbsp;Mary   		&amp; Richard's         		SMR .&nbsp;               		When we finally met face to face the   		love was even deeper as though we had known each other all our lives and   		beyond.&nbsp; We spent every day in each other's arms, talking, loving, and   		sharing dreams for our future.&nbsp; He had to leave for four days to attend   		his son's wedding in CA and when he returned, he was sick, we thought   		with the flu.&nbsp; By January, he became much worse and very large lumps   		appeared on his body.&nbsp; January the 20th he was diagnosed with cancer,   		our lives were shattered.&nbsp; I cared for him around the clock, never   		leaving his side and March the 25th he passed on.&nbsp; What is so strange   		are the dreams we both had before he passed away.&nbsp; Mine have continued   		since his passing.&nbsp; Many strange things have occurred in the physical as   		though they are messages from him.
  		
  		36.&nbsp;Jenny's         		SMR . &nbsp;   We   		talked about it, years later, and he had felt the same way the first   		time we met. He had felt an intense attraction to me that was completely   		unexplainable.&nbsp; When we are in the same room we are unable to stay away   		from each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember times when he was physically ill at   		the thought of us being separated, breaking up, for many days until I   		went to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same for me.&nbsp; I think about calling him, pick up the   		phone and realize that it is ringing and he is on the other end.&nbsp;&nbsp; There   		was a time where he went into a period of intense sadness and   		depression; and no one could reach him, one night he disappeared.&nbsp; I   		remember being on the highway, and just thinking that he needed me... so   		I turned around (over a median) and drove north on the interstate, got   		off an exit, and went to the train station.&nbsp; I jumped out of my car, ran   		onto the platform and sure enough there he was- and he did need me.&nbsp; He   		said later that he had been thinking about me the whole time...
  		
  		35.&nbsp;     		  		  		Devyn's Soulmate Experience &nbsp; 2 /14/06&nbsp;                        		  		  		  		  		Ever since I was a young child I knew that   		somewhere my soul mate existed and we would have the opportunity to meet   		one day. I had the feeling that he was many miles away and for some   		reason I always sent protective energy to him to keep him safe, even   		though I didn't have a clue who or where he was. Many years later,   		through a series of odd events, we met at traffic school of all places.   		From the first moment I saw him I sensed that we had a connection unlike   		any other I had ever felt before, different than life-long friends or   		even blood relatives. I found out later, he had felt the same strange   		connection. We had great conversation for the entire day and when class   		was over, I didn't want to leave his side. It was like finding the match   		to my memory card, the missing piece to my puzzle. We shared so many   		beliefs and traits, and at the same time, he was more of how I wished I   		could be and vise versa. He gave me his number so I wouldn't feel   		pressured to give mine and said that if I called it was because I truly   		wanted to talk. I wanted to call him that very night but I held off for   		fear that I may seem like some crazy stalker person. It was hard waiting   		so long but I called him the very next night and we've been inseparable   		ever since. We are about to celebrate our six year anniversary and the   		bond we share couldn't be more amazing; it only seems to become more   		&quot;in-tune&quot; with time.

I swear I saw   		electricity in the air around her. She was lit up like a Christmas tree.   		The flow of energy from and to each other was incredible.&nbsp; It scared the   		hell out of me and later I found it scared her as well.&nbsp; I avoided her   		like the plague.&nbsp; I had to sit at the same table and would sit several   		seats away.&nbsp; She thought, I thought she was weird. Then we had the   		&quot;finale&quot; for the weekend.&nbsp;   		  		  		  		  		
  		
  		33.&nbsp;     		  		  		Barry L's Soulmate Experience &nbsp; 12 /20/05&nbsp;                      		  		As life would have   		it, she has nudged me; pushed me; guided me; aided me; given me no   		choice but to go straight through the pain in metaphors representing   		past traumas. I have done the same for her; she just has had so much   		less than me to process. We have always, in the past, nurtured each   		other spiritually; having the same religious beliefs and precepts has   		allowed us to journey together the sacred path.    		  		  		  		  		
  		
  		32.&nbsp;     		  		  		Iris' Soulmate Experience &nbsp; 11 /27/05                  		There was a dart board in the corner   		and one night there were five or six men playing darts for drinks. I   		walked over to watch them and saw this nice looking young man standing   		before the board getting ready to throw the darts. All of a sudden as I   		looked at him, there was a great voice inside me that said&quot; Oh, there   		you are!&nbsp; I've been looking everywhere for you.&quot;&nbsp; I was really   		shocked and didn't really know what had happened, but I looked at him   		again and told myself that he was most likely a sugarcane farmer with a   		fat wife and half a dozen children.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  		
  		31.&nbsp;     		  		  		Kammy's Soulmate Experience &nbsp; 11 /19/05&nbsp;            		We instantly struck up a conversation   		that lasted about 3 or 4 hours (time seemed to stop), and it was during   		this conversation that something happened. Something in his eyes   		literally &quot;flashed&quot; at me for a split second, and it was a split second   		of pure recognition. I saw timelessness in his eyes, I saw him as an old   		man, just for a nanosecond, and I knew he was &quot;the one.&quot; It's like his   		eyes had a life of their own for that instant.&nbsp; It's hard to   		explain beyond immediately recognizing what his eyes revealed to me.   		Like he had been wearing a mask, and for that&nbsp; moment, took it off,   		to reveal his identity. We instantly became a couple. There was no   		awkward beginning, it was seamless. I am constantly amazed by the love   		we share. I have always had a hard time sharing deep feelings with   		romantic partners, and I haven't told him about the flashing of his eyes   		yet, and the recognition I felt. I now realize that I have to tell him   		this immediately. I have been planning to tell him, I just haven't done   		it yet. He has told me he knows I am &quot;the one.&quot; It's really amazing!

  		29.&nbsp;       		  		Katie's Soulmate Experience &nbsp; 9 /3/05            		  		Katie's NDE       I first encountered my soul mate/twin flame 7 years ago. I dreamt of this   		man from the age of three or four and as soon as I met him I knew who it   		was. I loved him the second we make contact, and I would do anything for   		him. Even at that point I loved him more than I loved anyone, my family,   		my closest friends. Everything about him was exactly the same as how he   		had always appeared to me. Not appeared in a physical sense, I never   		visually saw him in dreams, it was more of an understanding of his soul,   		his essence....but he was just as I was expecting him&nbsp;to be. Even at   		such a young age, I knew I was going to meet this man. I knew he would   		be very spiritual, warm ,gentle and kind hearted. I also knew that he   		would be much older than myself. I even&nbsp;knew the outcome. That he would   		become gravely ill and that I would take care of him up until his death,   		which was exactly what I ended up doing.&nbsp;We had a shared NDE ( no.622 on   		the NDE page ), we shared dreams, said the same things at the same time,   		go to call at the same time,&nbsp;had numerous signs and coincidences even   		though for the most part we were 300 miles apart. We liked the same   		things, had the same opinions, same character traits. When he got ill,   		although not as severe as his, I experienced many of his symptoms even   		often when not knowing he was having them. For example, when an acute   		attack of pancreatitis came upon him,&nbsp; I got aching pains in this   		region. When he felt sick, I came over nauseous. When he was upset, I'd   		intuitively know , sometimes even spontaneously cry myself and phone him   		out the blue, sometimes at 2 or 3am...and I was always right in doing   		so.&nbsp; Even after death for a good 12 months we still had an   		incredible spiritual connection. I had strong, lucid dreams of him and   		ADC's in many forms. I woke up the exact moment he died ( as soon as I'd   		woken I knew what had happened) , I had lights flickering, TV's   		switching themselves on and off, pictures moving....too many things to   		mention. It's stopped now because I'm having great difficulty in moving   		on and I think in a sense his continued contact after a point was making   		it impossible for me to let go which I know I must do, but I know even   		still that he's always around me.        	28.&nbsp;   	  	Twin Flames.&nbsp;by   	Cougar    		 5 /29/05&nbsp;    In The Second Moment After Forever, I discovered the fire seeped into every   crack and design. It could not be stopped by my will as was once naturally   expected since we were emerging away from the source of our Power! I   simultaneously saw ourselves being spit up into many candles of light, male   and female. We were becoming Individual Souls. We had tried to stop this fire we   had felt was an accident. It was no accident, but we had no memory to remember   that. We were only trying to protect ourselves and this beautiful shop. We had   been One and now we must split; and yet still desire to keep some semblance of   being One.

  	27.&nbsp;   	  	Jessica's SMR.&nbsp; 5 /29/05&nbsp; I will be traveling to Germany next week   	to visit my friend. I have always felt like he was my soul mate, but I also   	felt I was cheating my husband by saying that about someone else. I thought   	it was terrific to read the other stories on your site. I know my soul mate   	and I will probably never marry or have children together, but the   	connection we have is so much more than most people could ever understand.   	He completes me. 
  	
  	26.&nbsp; Penny's Soulmate Experience    2/24/05&nbsp;15 years ago I was invited to a social (dance) at the local football club.&nbsp; I was sitting with my sister and brother-in-law and just happened to look across the room when I both saw and felt (at the same time) a man dancing with a woman.&nbsp; He looked up and when our gaze met we smiled at each other as if we were old friends.&nbsp; I had never experienced that feeling in my life before, although having now had children and knowing what it is to truly love another person I now understand it as experiencing a great love and warmth towards someone whom I had never met. &nbsp;We have been together ever since.&nbsp; I   	don't know whether it was what people call 'love at first sight'; all I know is we belong to each other ' we always have and we    always will.
Love at first sight! 

25.&nbsp; A.A.'s Experience    2/18/05&nbsp; I noticed it was all darker than usual. At the same time, I heard him say &quot;it's so dark, I'm not here, what's happening? Is it because of the dark?&quot;. I felt extremely surprised because I thought I was dreaming, but I understood that I was awaken and he was feeling the same. He said &quot;the air we're breathing, is getting heavy, and we're getting &quot;light&quot; (low weight)&quot;. I was thinking exactly what he was saying, and later he said that everything I said too, during that experience, was exactly what he was thinking. We were connected, we were the same, it was this what we concluded later. 
 Soulmate experience that is a cross between and OBE and melting    into each other. 

24.&nbsp;Pam's Soulmate Experience&nbsp;      2/14/05.&nbsp; For me, meeting a soul mate is a feeling of being totally comfortable with who you are in their presence.&nbsp; We have an extraordinary level of communication but we can also just   	&quot;be&quot; together without even having to talk.&nbsp; It is not a physical experience although passion is definitely present. But lust shifts the focus to a physical thing.&nbsp; When you are with your soul mate it is more to do with the   	essence.&nbsp; It is as though everything gets reduced to an essence, a single potent concentrated drop.&nbsp; And you recognise that essence in each other. &nbsp; 

23.&nbsp;Brian's Soulmate Experience&nbsp;      1/16/05.&nbsp;  I am 55, happily married to a wonderful woman, and we have a great life and three terrific children. Through a relationship at work, I have met a woman, 18 years my junior, who has become a great friend. It has developed into such a strong bond, one that I've never had with another person. There hasn't been, nor will be an affair, as we have both agreed my wife and family are too important, as a matter of fact, my relationship with my wife has never been better, and I am open and honest about my new friend.&nbsp; But we agree on almost everything, both lost loved ones to cancer years ago and have both received many &quot;signs&quot; and coincidences, which we share. Our mutual attraction is far beyond anything we have every experienced, our emotions seem to be totally in sync, we    think alike, and have developed a deep love. For years I have had a dream, with someone calling my name very sweetly, but never recognized the person. I now realize it's her voice. But I had the dream before we met. We also have had coincidences related to us and our lives that are far beyond chance. Further, my wife seems to have a bond with her as well, and has said things about her and our relationship that are uncanny in their accuracy, without me having told her.&nbsp; My wife also seems to totally accept what we have, which is not typical, especially with a younger attractive woman. I want to emphasize again that my relationship with my wife is unbelievably good after 30 years of marriage. I have been attracted to other woman in my life, but figure it's normal, and just go on with my life. I have never had an affair.&nbsp;   What do you make of this? Why would it happen in my life now? What next? How does this relate to what you know about soulmates?  	         What is interesting is that I think that you, your wife and you are all from the same   	'soul cluster group.'&nbsp; Our work verifies Michael Newton's book, 'Journey of Souls.'&nbsp; You all connect on a soul level. &nbsp;I think there are probably many more trios like yours out there, but that our traditional nuclear families and other religious upbringings, and other cultural reinforcements make it difficult for such deep bonding to occur. &nbsp;I also give kudos to your wife for not being jealous.&nbsp; She is a much more evolved being than most where the soul recognitions supersede earthly bonds.&nbsp; If you   	don't mind, I'd like to anonymously post your account to the soulmate stories. &nbsp;

What next?&nbsp; Draw on the support from your soul group to help others. &nbsp;Whatever it is, a true soul calling would mean that it takes all three of your energies to fulfill all of your life purposes.&nbsp; If this relationship is as you say, then your group would have a large soul calling.

23.&nbsp;Daniel C's Soulmate Experience&nbsp;     4/30/05.&nbsp;  And if you were to consider the universe as a blanket, It seemed as if   I made a small cut in the fabric of time and space and poked my head through. to be greeted by another soul. and   I remember feeling my soul physically come out of me and her soul did the same and we meet in the middle and entangled for what seemed like an eternity.
 Shared Soulmate experience. 

22.&nbsp;Carolien   S's   Soulmate Experience&nbsp;     3/15/04.&nbsp;         From Holland.&nbsp;   The week after, he had to leave by train to Germany in the weekend but he was   coming down with a cold, which is not handy when you need to audition for a   major part... So I offered to give him a small reiki treatment. I stood behind   the couch with my hands on his head and he almost fell asleep. When I was done   he turned around and sat on his knees on the couch, facing me. He described how   it had felt and before I knew it he bent over and kissed me. I didn't want to   hold back any longer and I just kissed him back. He took my face in his hands   and carried on while I felt warm flutters and sparks shooting through my body.
  
  21.&nbsp;Mariette's   Soulmate Experience</a></font>&nbsp;   2/2/04.                 I     saw a man standing next to a door, he looked at me with brown, enormously     loving eyes that were absolutely radiant. He looked and smiled, laughed and     shook his head, like &quot;you're not supposed to be here&quot;. I felt some kind   of kinship with this man and felt completely loved by him. . . .      The man who was   standing there I believe is a man I met in 2002. He's the same     age, same color of the eyes, same height. I feel he is my soul mate.&nbsp;

     17.&nbsp;     Yvonne's SMR.&nbsp; 11/7/03&nbsp; I just met my soulmate, finally, at age 64. He is 66. We felt the universe suddenly open up to us as if someone pulled a string and the curtain went up. It is a spiritual awakening for both of us.
  
  16.&nbsp;          Brian &amp; Miranda's SMR.&nbsp;   9/22/03&nbsp;  But if   I could feel her, than she was real. It was like she knew this and was giving me   some kind of confirmation. So I   started towards her, she started towards me and when I finally touched her it   was the most marvelous thing I have ever experienced. I put my arms around her   waist and pulled her close, she wrapped her arms around my neck and laid her   head on my chest. I could feel the weight of her body leaning against mine, the   light pressure of her arms around my neck even her hair in my face tickling my   nose while I was breathing. Life has never been this real.&nbsp; And all I could   think was YES YES YES!!!!! This was real and I will see her again. I have never   felt happiness to this degree.&nbsp; NEVER!
   Love transcends   death!&nbsp; Of interest is her description of what it was like to die and what   happens afterwards.&nbsp; She also promised to be with her beloved when it is   his time to leave earth.&nbsp;  </p>

15.&nbsp;          Kathy O's SMR.&nbsp;   9/21/03&nbsp; I was   being pulled toward this being that was the color of royal purple. I heard a   name of this being (Kevin) and I heard the olive green being say to me   telepathically 'This is the one you will be with next'. I thought to myself '   you want me to be with my ex-brother-in-law ' that was the only 'Kevin' that I   knew at that time. As this being drew closer it realized that this was a   different person. When we embraced it was so wonderful. It felt like 10 billion   fireworks of love energy exploding all around and in me. Pure ecstasy. It was   Love unbounded. That is the best way that I can describe it. Nothing that we can   experience on earth even comes close to this feeling. I did not want to let go   of this being. (When I get back 'home' I can't wait to embrace everyone).
   These experiences   have many different aspects to them.&nbsp; She started as a child of age 6, and   the experiences continued.&nbsp; The most amazing parts of these stories are the   descriptions of the other side, the soulmate story, and the soul contract of   trying to help her first husband find God. 
      
  14.          Marie's SMR.&nbsp;   9/15/03&nbsp;  When I was 17, I   started having these dreams about this wonderful person.&nbsp; They were odd dreams   though.&nbsp; I would essentially find myself in a dark room (that's the best I can   describe but it was more just like darkness) and he would be in there.&nbsp; We would   have wonderful conversations and I loved him from that moment.&nbsp; The odd thing   was I knew everything about him from these dreams including how many brothers   and sisters he had and that he was two years younger than me, but I could not   make out his face.&nbsp;
  SMR is a dream come true!
  
  13.          Contessina's SMR.&nbsp;   7/4/03    When I met him, I was completely   spellbound. I said, mentally to him, with a great cry from my inner being,   'Once, a long time ago, we were the same person. Then something terrible   happened and we were torn apart and we have been trying to get back together   ever since!'&nbsp; He said aloud to me, 'I can see your whole life, but you're   not ready for it, yet.'
  She describes being one part   of a two-part soul.

12.&nbsp; NDE-Like        James B's SMR               English expanded version ,           4 /6/03&nbsp;    The thought came to my mind   telling me that we are all inter-connected, we are all as one, part of the one   great big plan. We are all linked in spiritually! WOW! I thought. Then he told   me that I had to go back because there was people who needed me. He told me to   wait for little Pebbels, that he had given her to me before we walked this   Earth. That we were placed on this earth on the same day. He told me that she   was my soul-mate and would be along soon. He also told me to wait a few day and   I would receive a letter in the post from the people that had made me hurt so   much. 
   This is a NDE-like   event where he was told about meeting his soulmate.&nbsp; He did meet her just   as he was told.&nbsp; He also came back with some unique paranormal gifts.     </font>

11.          Steven B's Experience.&nbsp;   10/3/02  I absolutely   knew I had left the physical world and had left my physical form, as though   there was a wall (not a physical wall) between my current state and my former   physical state. I knew that I was not a great distance from my former state, but   was separated from it.&nbsp; The 1st thing that came to me after a while (I have not   sense of how long) was an overwhelming sadness, because it occurred to me that   my leaving my physical form (my death) would bring great sadness to my family   and those that i loved, this knowledge that my leaving would bring great sadness   to their lives made me very sad.&nbsp; 
   This is a unique   blend of a dream and an OBE.&nbsp; There is also a woman on the other side that   could be his soulmate, higher self, or a member of his soul-cluster group. 
  
  10.&nbsp;  Melanie's   SMR: &nbsp;I have an experience to share: First off, I have learned to   relate and respect cluster groups; I have a memory from before I was born, and   remember being a part of a &quot;circle of souls&quot; so interconnected and intertwined   that we did not seem to think much of our own consciousness--then my   consciousness developed awareness and I remember two beings giving me a   &quot;preview&quot; of my life before I was to be sent to earth--they showed me something   like a mirror or a curtain, offering pictures of the earth and showed me my   parents and then told me there were certain lessons I needed to learn, though I   certainly don't remember what...as I've spoken to psychics, they have often   commented seeing these two presences next to me...Now I am having a soul mate   experience with someone who is afraid of commitment.&nbsp; It's very painful   because he doesn't realize it yet, though I do--hopefully he'll come   around...anyway, the interesting thing about this is that I remember him, its as   though he's &quot;come back&quot;--its the most profound experience!&nbsp;  6/20/02
    
  9.&nbsp;    John &amp; Mary Alice's SMR.&nbsp;           English expanded version ,              French expanded   version&nbsp;  &quot; We   have been together for over 24 years now, more in love than ever, with eternity   still to come.&nbsp; Two more items of interest.&nbsp; About a week before that cold   March night, I had a dream that woke me up from a deep sleep.&nbsp; A dream like no   other dream that I ever had before, or ever since.&nbsp; It was short, with no   dialogue.&nbsp; I was sitting at an outdoor caf'; it was late, maybe nighttime, with   a heavy fog in the air.&nbsp; The silhouettes of two people were walking towards me.&nbsp;   I looked down to read the paper and felt the presence of one of the persons   sitting down at my table.&nbsp; I looked up and it was Mary Alice.&nbsp; It was if   this dream was a harbinger, a sign of thinks to come.&quot;&nbsp;     It is always inspiring to read   accounts with so much love and a hint of soulmate remembrance.   
  
  8 .&nbsp; Sherry  H's SMR/ADC.&nbsp;   &quot;He looked up and saw me, his expression was pure amazement. The most  interesting thing about this experience was that I could feel his emotions as  though they were my own. He came towards me and I to him.. he picked me up and  swung me around saying... 'I love you, I love you, I love you.'&quot;&nbsp;  Series  of ADC dream visitations with several family members.&nbsp; Illustrates the  spectrum of connections between family members in this life and the next.&nbsp;  This account is also part of the After-Death Communications Website at  www.adcrf.org. 2/22/02.   
   
  7.&nbsp;  Q's SMR.&nbsp;  &quot; &nbsp;I&nbsp;   have always remembered being in &quot;Heaven&quot; before the descent  into the physical form.&nbsp;  There was  someone there with me. (Spirit.)&nbsp;  There  was an immense amount of love and energy flowing though us.&nbsp;   We were being separated to come into the world in two different forms. &quot;&nbsp;  Twin Flames SMR with  pre-birth remembrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  2 .&nbsp;  Robin's SMR.&nbsp;   &quot; Soulmates,  perhaps, come from our more intimate &quot;core&quot; group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several  years ago I met another woman.&nbsp;  There,  too, was an almost instant recognition that this person was important to me and  I to her.&nbsp;  She is also married.&nbsp;   Our relationship is really the opposite from my &quot;marriage.&quot;&nbsp;   I would describe us more in terms of the Twin Flame you mentioned.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Two  Romantic Soulmates At The Same Time.
  
               1.&nbsp;  Rich  B's SMR.&nbsp;  &quot;Your  article touched on some understanding I derived from my NDE.&nbsp;   The &nbsp;concept of soulmates or helpmates was something I came back  with although I &nbsp;thought it was an original idea unique to me.&quot;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  NDEr  Returns With Soulmate Truths.
