  		              		Experience Description   

  I was 2 years old and sitting on my father's shoulders yelling, 'NO.  I didn't want to  go into the deep water.   I remember him falling and hitting the water.

  I was inside of a golden bubble looking at a child in the water. He was floating face down. At the time, I didn't know who it was. To me, it was   just a lifeless body floating in the water. 
  
  This peaceful scene dissolved as I felt hands grabbing my body and pulling me out of the water. 

  Then I was over my father's  shoulder as he  was bouncing me up and down.
  
  Back on the beach, my father put me on a blanket. He and my two sisters helped to keep me calm.  Then  they resumed playing on the beach, leaving me by myself.
