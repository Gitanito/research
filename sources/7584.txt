  		              		Experience Description   

    My Mum had a massive stroke. I signed her end-of-life consent. The stroke left her brain-damaged beyond repair and body spastic with her head tilted back. She had a strong physiological will to live and continued in a state of unconsciousness for two days. A few hours before she died, I was sitting  a few feet from her. I told her that it was O.K. to go and  that I loved her very much. I was filled with the most incredible flood of love and complete reassurance. The feeling went from my toes and continued upwards.  I've never felt such a thing ever before or after. 

  An hour before her death, it was as if  two comets shot into the room at lightening speed from the top corner of the private room and straight into her chest. It signalled the presence of my two Aunts. They had come to tell her to stop fighting and to let go. Mum told them that she wasn't going unless a part of her stayed within me. The same two comets or speed-of-light flashes shot back out of her chest, one after the other and through the same corner of the room. A peace filled the room. Mum died shortly thereafter, but I knew my life was different from then on. I have an unfaltering faith in life after death now. 
  
  A few years earlier, Mum and I had watched Forest Gump. The white feather at the end made us cry. Mum said to me, 'I will send you feathers when I'm gone.' After her death she did send me  white feathers.   I can think of Mum, then a real feather appears. I've had three conversations with her since she passed 7 years ago. I have asked her each time, what is it like on the other side. She tells me that she cannot explain it because it is nothing that I could possibly understand. She likens it to joining an infinite number of other souls to being like an engine gaining momentum and power to fuel and improve the Universe.

  That's it basically. I witnessed the passing of my Mother.  I'm the one who experienced the experience near her death.
