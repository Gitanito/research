Each time I passed through a realm, I could see geometrical forms that looked like sacred geometry. I would absorb each one and it was as if I was receiving all the knowledge of the universe. I was having a trillion thoughts a second. I was aware of all things. I felt like I was back in a familiar place once again. At that moment I was pulled through the final veil, everything was perfectly still. I was in a place that felt like the center of the universe. I could see galaxies slowly spinning as they revolved around me and I was aware that I was not alone. 
  Possible NDE associated with surgery and medications following surgery.

I was in a beautiful violet, magenta-colored light. A few Beings surrounded me and I felt so very much loved. They were very loving souls. Then I saw my whole life; every microsecond, every thought, and every feeling. The Beings escorted me through my complete life. It was like a life review. I could ask everything and got answers that were healing to my soul. There was no sense of time and space.

They used my thoughts but it was different than thoughts. They reminded me that I had chosen to be incarnate on Earth and that I had to go back. I already knew that by being by their side, everything was coming back to me. They gave me so much love. I was at home and I badly wanted to stay. I didn’t want to leave, but I had to go back. That’s how it had to be. I remember laughing a lot with them. They understood me. They knew the difficulty of an incarnation, as well as I knew it before I incarnated on Earth.

I see that the light is still bright, like it is the only presence around and it is everywhere. I moved from one corner of the wall, went around and then settled in one spot. I was seeing all that is happening, but not through my eyes. A lean man with wires and tubes all over his body was looking at me. I was thinking, 'Why this man is staring at me?' and sensed that he was in the ICU for renal failure.

My father had died 7 years earlier from cancer when my daughter was 7 years old. She went on to say that Grampy Bob told her that she needed to wake up, so she did.

I felt that feeling of love, peace, trust - an indescribable feeling. And then I looked at my friend. Because he too looked at me like that, I asked him, 'Do you feel that too?' And he nodded. I continued, 'Do you feel the same as I do? This unimaginable love, this peace, this peace?'  He replied, 'I feel the same as you. INCREDIBLE!' I got the answer.  We two felt this divine love.

    4735.    Steve H STE     12/16/2019.      STE 8931.            I noticed there was something going on in the crystal blue sky. There was a vortex, or two-dimensional swirl that was rotating in a clockwise direction that opened up to reveal a 3-dimensional space in another realm. There was an intense Light that was blinding at first. As my eyes adjusted, I could start to understand what was going on. The Light was so intense and distracting that I stopped struggling because I was so afraid and didn't know what was happening. As this space opened up, it was like an inverted cone or funnel with the large end closest to me. I did not go to the space. Rather, this space came towards me and consumed my surroundings. The cone was made up with a multitude of angels. There were thousands, or maybe millions of them. I could only see their upper torso area and heads, but I did not focus on them as there was something even more important going on. The angels were singing this unbelievable music, in a tone or octave that isn’t possible with human voices.  
  STE dream.   

    4734.    David C NDE     12/16/2019.      NDE 8929.       From the United Kingdom.     I remember being on a country lane with a meadow to the left and trestle to the right. There was a gentle breeze.  I had a feelings that are still with me today. I was in total comfort and full of joy and happiness. I had such massive feelings of love. I felt no pain. It was incredible and I can’t put words together to explain how wonderful it was.

      4733.    Brandon R Probable NDE     12/16/2019.      Probable NDE 8928.            And just as soon as I started to fly towards this light, I was at the source of this light. It was a great, giant white ball. It was huge but small at the same time. It felt amazing. The light  was pouring out love in all directions. And the love it did pour out was love that had no bounds. There was no judgment for what I did to get there. There was just endless pure, bright love. I quickly realized that the light was love itself; the manifestation of love. And the love it was, was perfect love that loves without conditions, without judgement, and without bounds. It was the perfect kind of love we all look for. Love itself.

    4732.    Dawn T NDE-Like     12/16/2019.      NDE-Like 8927.            I was met by a man that I knew to be Jesus. But I also sensed he might be a different person to different people. That he was whomever someone needed him to be. In my case, he was Jesus, though no name was ever given, I just intuitively knew his identity. He was of average height and weight, dark hair that was somewhat short, definitely not long. A short dark beard and green eyes. He wore a light colored, roughly woven shirt and dark pants, very average. Except his smile, his smile was definitely not average! He smiled a lot and it was broad and big, always reaching his green eyes!

It was warm and peaceful; and I felt safe. I vividly remember looking up onto a knoll and seeing a row of four extremely bright white buildings. The buildings had strange symbols on the side facing me. The symbols looked like nothing I've ever seen before and unfortunately cannot recall them exactly so I cannot draw them. However, the symbols were made up of lines similar to Asian writing.

      4724.    John J Probable NDE     11/20/2019.      Probable NDE 8917.            I saw the most incredible crystal tree. All of it was crystal including the tree trunk, branches, and what looked like leaves that were flat with beveled edges. There was no wind as we know wind here, but there was movement. It moved the crystal leaves, just enough to touch. When the movement touched the leaves, it sounded so beautiful. The leaves changed color as if the light separated into unique colors like a prism and I could hear sound all at the same time. The sound was so pure like the sound of a high-pitched triangle that was very pleasant to the ear. It makes me think of wind chimes.

I truly believe that was God restarting her life.

All the memories in life are blown out. Every detail is very clear, and it is reflected in the form of visual senses. Yes, it is vision and can be seen. I saw that I was young and had to ask for five cents from my mother to buy popsicles. By my mother’s expression, I was told to cross the road carefully. As I watched myself tasting the popsicles, it is like a re-experience. I have experienced the life that I gave up again in the first-and-second-person perspective before I took the sleeping pills. It turned out to be, that everything is worth remembering. It is like a revolving lantern.

It was about 40 feet in diameter and there was 6 spirits standing in the pond of clouds and looking down. Every once in a while, one spirit would bend over and pick up another spirit. It would cradle and embrace it in it's arms then look up and fly very fast into the clouds above. Then another spirit from above would fly down into the pond and takes the other spirit's place. This went on for some time. I then asked the angel what they were doing over there.

I saw a lagoon that was surrounded by beautiful plants. Everything was soft to the touch. There were 4 or 5 entities who were present, but I could not see them. They assured me that everything would be all right and that I could leave anytime I wanted. They told me that this place was for me and it contained all the Unconditional Love I had for others and that they had for me.

    4717.    Peter S Probable NDE     11/1/2019.      Probable NDE 8912.       From Canada     I vividly remember seeing a lady who was wearing a dark robe. I'm trying to figure out how to best describe this. The robe had no colour. It was dark, yes. But it was not black. Imagine a blackhole or void wrapped around you like a blanket. That what it looked like. She had light brown hair, the same colour as caramel or peanut butter. I don't remember her face, because I am not sure that she had one.  
  Probable NDE at age 10 due to drowning.   

    4716.    Dr. Dennis M NDE     11/1/2019.      NDE 8911.            The room or area I was in, seemed to be real and enclosed. As I walked to a huge wall of something that resembled windows, I was greeted by a very tall person, perhaps close to seven feet tall, that was dressed in a long off-white robe with long medium blonde hair and Very White Skin… Almost Glowing! I felt so Alive and Very Happy, and smiling at the moment of just being there for some unknown reason.

Inside the light was my deceased dad, who looked younger than he did before he transitioned. He had a big smile on his face. I couldn't get close to him but I was so happy to see him that I couldn't stop smiling. I knew that the light was aware and conscious because I could feel it.

I thoroughly remember my deceased maternal grandfather, myself, and my two daughters Tea’ra and Candice, who wouldn’t be born until May 4, 1995 and June 11, 2001. We were watching from the sky, all of the activities going on in the emergency room to try to save my body. It was as if we pulled back the roof of the building so we could view everything simultaneously. I also vividly remember my daughters trying to convince me to return to my body so they could be born in the near future.

At this moment, I found myself lying on a white bed with hospital railings. In this place, I felt an indescribably calm peace, almost like an absence of feelings. I looked more carefully and saw in the distance many people dressed in white, grouped together in an all white place. They looked like they were in a meeting. But nobody saw me and there was no one near me. I knew that I wasn’t supposed to be there.

I felt I was floating up in air without seeing anything. It seemed like I was engulfed and flying in a black hole. I was unemotional, immobile, and mute. Not knowing how long I had been flying, then there were pictures appeared in front of me from my adulthood to childhood and it sped up fast until I saw some unfamiliar pictures. Finally, I reached to the universe where there are galaxies and unknown stars. Suddenly, I felt a heavy pull downward back to the black hole prior. I felt myself like a meteor in a full speed moving towards the ground.

    4708.    Arnulfo G NDE     10/19/2019.      NDE 8900.       Reader discretion advised.     I was being attacked by spirits that wanted to penetrate my soul. Then I saw what looked like oceans and oceans of souls in an evil dominion. There were hundreds of millions of lost loved ones. I felt their horror, pain, and torture. The wailing and hurt they were projecting at me were extremely intense. They were unrelenting, and all I could do was scream! But then the spirit of God shielded me from these acts of violence.

There was no end to the darkness except for the light that was shining down from above and on to my body. There were paramedics all around my body except for my head.

I saw a tunnel and the blue sky covered with clouds with rose-colored hues. It was as if the clouds were the walls of the tunnel, but all very ethereal. Everything was pastel-colored but like it was shining and iridescent. I was seeing the tunnel from the front, but I found I was floating. I was above, and the rest was below. That was how it felt, even though I didn't see anything but the tunnel. The emotional sensation was that of love, so much love and peace. Something very great, hard to describe. No words can encompass the meaning of love and peace.

It was like an endless wall that I could not go through or over. I was in the nothing and yet I was in everything. I was free of my body, alone, not in a room, and yet there was a feeling of a wall.

    4703.    Wanda H Probable NDE     9/23/2019.      Probable NDE 8892.            I proceeded to have a telepathic conversation with a presence I couldn’t see but knew to be 'God' or maybe another guide. I understood that I had died but had the choice to go back. I immediately decided to accept my death. I was then made to feel the pain that my family would feel over my death. It was a crushing feeling, and to this day, I still cry every time I relive that experience. I then contemplated choosing to live, but I didn’t understand how I was supposed to return when my body was so broken.  
  Probable NDE associated with adrenal crisis.

At first I wanted to shut my eyes but I had none. Then the brilliant white light, that felt like I was being hugged, of love started fading out revealing the most beautiful scenery I have ever witnessed. I started seeing flowers, vibrant flowers. Some had colors I have never seen before, going off into the distance along the rolling hills. I was moving towards them, gliding along the ground. Then my vision started to clear more and I was by a river looking at a gazebo.

I felt this comforting presence that stayed with me as I continued to watch the paramedics resuscitate me. Then I heard the words “It’s not your time yet. You have more to do.” With those words, I was back in my body, struggling to breathe, and experiencing tremendous pain.

  4699.    Ashley M NDE     9/17/2019.      NDE 8887.       Exceptional Experience.     Then I was brought to a room full of other people and their spirit guides. Each of us were standing around something like a circular table. It had a dome in the center of the table. I looked into the dome and started my life review. I could witness and experience my life from many different perspectives. I felt what others felt from my actions from their point of view. It was hard to go through, but I knew it was to learn and grow from my time on earth. I remember hearing others cry, laugh, and other things because of what they did on Earth. My spirit guide told me it was okay, and that we are all loved; that this was not a judgment. I was told that we all learn best by experiencing it ourselves. God does not judge us.

'You are dying, but don’t be scared.' I started to see a very beautiful white light and I was drawn to this light because that light emanated joy. Then I saw some flashes from my life. I clearly saw images of nice memories and also some bad memories. I wasn’t just seeing images or remembering memories, I was actually living the events as if those moments as were really happenign again. That voice explained to me me about the bad or negative moments and I understood. I remember I felt very relieved by that voice's words; the voice said, 'You’ve done this. But I understand you, so don’t feel guilty.'

Almost immediately I felt a vertical movement without knowing if it went up (or down) and all the stones transformed into light. I found myself in the middle of a light of an inconceivable intensity. Compared with this light, the sun when looking it in the face looks like a weak electrical light bulb. This light was of a total transparency, to the point that normal light seemed dense and compact in comparison. Because of my feeling I knew without the smallest doubt that this light was God (while I was an atheist...) in the same way as you don't doubt the existence of the sun when you receive its beams. I couldn't reason intellectually anymore, I only sensed things. This light was loving me with unconditional love and it wasn't judging me. It made me totally transparent for myself, I saw the truth about myself without being able to lie to myself. I saw my life scrolling with an inconceivable speed, like thumbing through a book in a few seconds.

Then I went into a brightly lit area, where I was allowed to see the fall which I had experienced. I saw several video-like snippets of past events in my life. Next, I was in a circular dome of colors. It was like being in a a soap bubble, with people sitting around the outside of the bubble. Although I could not see the people clearly enough to recognize any faces, I did have a feeling of great love coming from them.

I felt that my recently deceased was very close to me. I was feeling quite torn that I needed to stay for Mum and Dad, but yet, I was looking forward to seeing my brother. I felt like it was a shame that I could not keep going toward the light because it was so peaceful, but I felt I should try to stay too.  I also thought that I could see all the medical people from an outside view, not from where my body was. While they seemed frantic, I felt very calm and peaceful

    4692.    Mary Beth B Possible NDE     9/1/2019.      Possible NDE 23387.            The next thing I knew, I was out  of my body and flying in circles around the room. I saw myself, the Doctor, and the nurses. Then I flew through the ceiling and up into the sky. I went up, up, and up, until I was in SPACE. There were stars are all around me as I was just floating. The freight train sound  turned into the most amazing electronic dance music song.  I was dancing in the stars.

The huge and fierce fire burned off all the shops. It seemed like the whole world was under flames while I was watching it. Very horrible! If the purgatory were made of fire, then I believed this is hell. 
  Hellish NDE from a man who wanted to remain anonymous.

I panicked and said, 'Dad I love you but I love my daughter more.' A huge smile spread across his face

This Being was very tall and awesomely powerful. It had a different vibration that somehow held me and kept me in one place. This Being was a light body and although there were no discernible physical features as we have here, I knew it was feminine. Feminine is a term in this life that I don't really use, because it's not part of how I think. But this Being was, without a doubt, feminine and profoundly powerful. I was in the light looking at and awe struck by her presence, power, and awesome love.

Melodic music emerged from afar to nearby me, which it was the most delightful music that I ever heard – easy, lovely, and mellow. I listened to it carefully and would like to sing along with it. Nevertheless, the whole piece had not finished yet, instantly the chair below me went missing. I began to fall down, and I screamed out loud, “I don’t want to go back! I don’t want to go back! I don’t want to go back.” But it was completely futile. The descending speed was the same as when I was ascended where I went through multi-layer clouds, where every cubicle was thousands of miles in size. I saw every layer of cloud was mixed with white and colorful soft shape building panels, as I passed by them.  
  NDE  due to allergy complications.   

    4687.    Damon H NDE     8/22/2019.      NDE 8867.       From Australia     The 'tone' was smooth, certain, all knowing. It was in command and I had complete and total trust and faith in it. I felt strangely calm in the blackness and KNEW I would be out as told.  I believe I know the entity but don't know how or who. I can't say with any certainty that is was a guide, angel or Christ consciousness.

The tunnel was grey in color, and ridges and ripples, and I was being drawn to a beautiful white light. I was very aware that my children were asleep next to me in bed, and that this light, and doorway to what seemed to be of Heaven (golden movement in white brilliant light) drew me closer to it with curiosity.

    4685.    Clayton D Probable NDE     8/22/2019.      Probable NDE 8865.            Everything was a uniform white. It's a white rotating platform in a white empty plain of existence. I see a creature in the distance though not far away and I have no feelings of fear or joy and I have no curiosity about it either. It also is white and largely resembles the shape of an elephant and I somehow just knew that this creature was ancient and far more superior to me. I now become aware that I am getting closer to this creature with each rotation. We are looking at each other and we communicate without speaking.  
  Probable NDE due to unconsciousness from illicit substance use.

Then we went through a bright, glaring tunnel that was so brilliant, that I am still very impressed by even today. The tunnel was made of multi-colors and was spiral.

When I reached the light, I saw a beautiful meadow with many exotic plants and animals.

I could feel it against my back. I remember thinking about whether I should turn around and face the energy. But I had young children who needed a father, so I considered that as well. In my mind, I had a choice to stay here and enter the energy knowing there could be no return if i did. Or I could return and raise my kids. The very instant I decided I wanted to go to raise my kids, I was back in my body.

A tunnel opened and at the end of was a light such as I had never seen. There were people and deceased family members. I moved swiftly to the light and was very lucky.

But when I was close to the hospital bed, I saw and felt a very warm and strong presence there. I didn't see it clearly, but there were ethereal plant-like shapes surrounding the bed and forming like a cave-like shape or a tunnel. When the nurses put me on the bed, I felt how that presence and the plants-energy surrounded me.  I started to dissolve into the bed, which wasn't the bed anymore but was part of that presence and the mass of plant-like energy.

I had no knowledge of my death, or even any thoughts about existence at all. It was like being asleep, only there was an absolute consciousness such that I was aware of myself. I was aware of everything around me in all of the darkness. But I felt like a part of it; like my entire being was only a single atom and I was connected to all the atoms of around me. I felt nothing but serenity. I was part of all that surrounded me, and I was content with that.

    4679.    Sarah S NDE     7/30/2019.      NDE 8854.    I looked up to see whose feet I was staring at. I was in awe. I saw my baby boy who died 14 years ago when he was 48 days old. He had the small feet and was maybe 6 years old, had blonde hair in a bowl -ut, bright and shining blue eyes, and had the biggest smile on his face. Holding his hand, was my grandpa, who passed 3 days after my 9th birthday. My grandpa was 66 when he passed, but he looked like he was maybe 30 years old in this experience.

Then I saw a white light that was beautiful and intense as it surrounded me. I couldn't say if this had the shape of a tunnel, but I can say that the light had this absolute sensation of calm and well-being.

I saw a tunnel with brightness, brighter than the sun pulling me towards it, the bright light was at the end of the tunnel and I could see my body on the floor. It was like I floated above it.

Instinctively, I entered into the light and understood that my life on earth was ending and that I was facing my own death. I felt good, similar to the feeling of sliding into a warm bath. I was happy being there. I was aware that suffering stopped and that I never again would be suffering; this sensation is indescribable. I started to go deeper into the light, I 'talked' strongly through thought, and was telling him, 'If this is my time, I accept it'.

I looked down a saw a little boy, who was one or two years old. He could see me. It was a strange feeling; it was like I knew the child, perhaps he was my child?
