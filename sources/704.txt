it were the fepule her of the foul^ as ifit feemed to be foolifh

hrini Eugenius, Theodidaftus, and^TLCchw^together',
yea and to reconcile Sarapis unto Eug nius, in faying that
after he hath changed his nature^ he became to have this
denomination. And therefore this name Sarapis is com--
vnon to all^ as they k^ow very well^ who are profejfed in the
ftcred religion of Eui^enms, For we ought not to give
eare and credit to the hooks and writings of th^ fhrygians^

'^
the fame with all reverence^ for the ufe

had of them. But they who come after taking this grofely

their ah

ly^^S^ ,Chriftofher Heydon faith, that the Earth is not
changed, but relented and mixed with other Ele-
ments which doe diflblveitj and that it returns
back into it feif.
Now every otic oftlie Elemmts hath two fpecial
qualities, the formcrwhcreofitretains,as proper toi
itfelf, in the other, as a means, it agrees with that
Vrhich comes next after it, for fire is hot and dry,
the earth dry and cold, the water cold and moift,
the aire hot and moift, and fo after this manner-
the Elements accord into two contrary qualities,
are contrary one to the other, as Fire to Water, and
Earth to Aire,moreover theElements are upon ano-
ther account oppofite one to the other; Forfomc
are heavy as Earth and water, aiid others are light
as Aire and Fire.
Wherefore the KofieCntcians called the former paf-
fives, but the latter aftives, AndyetDoftor Cnlpc^
"per my predeceflbur diftinguifhcth them after ano-

qualities, viz. tothefirebrightneffe, thinnefleand
motion, but to the Earthjdarkneffe, thicknefle and
quietnefle, and according to thefc qualities, the
Elements borrow their qualities from thefe, fothat
the Aire receives two qualities of the Earth, dark-
neffc and thicknefTc, and one of fire,t//25. Motion;
but fire is twice more thin then Aire, thrice more
moveable, and foure times more bright; and the
Aire is twice more bright, thrice more thin, 8c foure
times more moveable then water? wherefore water

Fire is to the Aire, fothe Aire is to the Water, and
Water to the Earth 5 and again, as the Earth is to

THere arc then as we have faid, foure Elements,
without the perfeft knowledg whereof, we can
cffeft nothing in this Science , now each of them is
threefold, that fo the number of foure may make
up the number of twelve Ideas incorporated into

(which fignifieth the Cxleftial powers, are ten prin-
cipal names ofGod, as you read in the ninth Chap-
ter) there may be a progrelTe to the fupream unity
upon which all vertue and operation depends , of
the firft order are the pure Elements, which are nei-

reduced to their fimplicityj doth above all things

which originally and of themfelves are not Ele-

makes that, being tofled with winds warme : It
is in the Aire, and makes it (as we fomtimeg
fee) to burnc, and all Animals and livuig things
whatfoever, as alfo all vegitables arc prcferved
by Heat, and every thing that lives , lives -by
reafon of the inclofed heat, the properties of
the fire that is above, are heat, making all things
fi'uitfull and light, giving life to all things; the
properties of the infernal fires are a partching
hear, confuming all things; and darknefs making
all things barren, Fire drives away all ill things, in
as much as it hath an Analogy with, and is the ve-
hiculum of that fuperiour light; as alfo ofhim who
faith, I am the light ofthe World, which is true fire,
the Father oflights, from whom every good thing,
that is given comes : fending forth the light of his
Fire, and communicating it felf to the Sun, and the
reft ofthe Superiour bodies, and by thefe, as by Me-
diating Inftf iiments, conveying that light into our

and the great Jehovah himfelfcin the old Law
commanded that all his Sacrifices fhould be offered
jvith Fire, and that Fire (hould alwayes be burning
upon the Altar: And that they muft not fpeak of
God without a light ; good Angels are augmented
by the Sun, and alfo by the light of our common
Fire, and evil Spirits, are driven away ; therefore
lights and fires, fhould be kindled by the Corps of
the Dead, and here follow the four Figures of the

Now the Bafis and Foundation of all the ElementFg
is the Earth, for that is the ob;eft, fubjefV, and re-
ceptacle of all Celeftical rayes and influences, in it
are contained the feeds and feminal venues of all
things : and therefore it is faid to be Animal, Vigi-
tableandiV^ineral, it being made fruitful bytheo-

and that thofe produftioas that are made in, and

Water ; The fame Scripture teftifies, where it faith,
that the Plants and the Herbs did not grow, becaufc
God had not caufed it to Rain upon the Earth;

Fruits, they caft a figure, and ifany ofthe figures
of the water and Ideals were incorporated in any of
the four Angels, they took the Bows of an Oak, and
put them into the water : Then the Ruler of that
Region, and his Z^^/r'; troubled the waters, and a
vapour afcending from thence into the Aire, was
blown into Clouds, with which being joyned toge-
ther, the whole Heaven was over fpread, which
being a little after diffblved into rain, watered all
the Country moft wholfomely. Moreover Kuffus

fpiric parting through all things, giving life and

the refoun Jing fpirit of the Worlds inftrument, it
immediately receives into it felfe, the influences of

ofthe pxteen Figures and their tttanifold
Divijions^
THcfe
Figures are divided many wayes as firft
into fou re Quadrants or Quarters 5 anfwering
to the foure quarters of the year.
The Vernal or Spring Quarter, is Sanguine, hot
and moift, and conteynes the firft foure figures , vis^
Vuer^ Arni^iOy AlbuSy and Cauda Vtacmis,
The Eftynal or Summer Quarter, is hot, dry,and
collerick, and conteins other foure figures, vizSofu^
lus, ¥ortuna Major^ ConjunBioy Caput Draconis.
The Autumnal or Harveft quarter^ is cold^ moift
aiid Phlepmatick, conteins thefe figurcs,which have
as well as the reft their vertucs from the Rulers and
Idea'^Sy the four figures avG Puela^ Kuheufy Acqutfi--
tiOj YoYtuna Minor.
The Hyemnall Brumal, or Winter quarter
is,
cold
moift and flegmatick; of the nature of the tenth|!
eleventh and twelfth houfcs and their Rulers and
Idea's and their Figures, viz. Career^ Triftitia'^ Letitia
and Via,
They are again divided in divifion of the Eic-
mcnts, for fome figures receive fuch vertue, as in
nature they are fiery, hoc and dry, and they arc

three of thefe make the tiery Triplicicy, over which
Sorath rulech by day, and Hifntael by night.
Others arc cold and earthly, viz, Amijfw^ Con-
junGiOy Career y Caput Vraconh^ and thefe conftitutc
the Earthly Triplicityj over whom KedemelmX^s by
day, and Hafmodai by night.
Others arc Aicry, hot and moift^ viz Alhus^ Puela^
trijiitia^ Fortuna Minor -^ over whom Zazel Rules by
day , and 'Xaphthartharatb by night.
Others are watery, cold and moift, viz. Populusy
Letitia^Via^ Kubeus^ andarecalled the watery Tri-
plicity, over whom Barzabd ruleth both day and
night.
Some figures are MafcuUne. and therefore hot as,

Populus^ Caput V acorns; fome are Feminine, Nodur-
nal, therefore cold, Amijjto, Via^ Conjundio^ Kuheus,

The ufe whereof, is this, that if you have a
Mafculine figure in a Mafcuhne houfe, governed by
a Mafculine Ruler,it imports hini or her more man-
ly, andfo if a Mafculine figure be in a Feminine
boufe, the man or v/oman is I elTe couragious, &c.

The life of this Table is great, bccaufc it teaches
the Fortitudes and Debilities of the Rulers and

cond is their figures ; the third and fourth is of

governed by <^ and '^, and there 5"ortft^ is exal-
ted, and fignifies fomething of the Nature of £/ir-

appear not before there be any Armies in the field
to fend up fuch vapours; and whether Harnefs and
Weapons fend up vapours too, as Swords, Pikes and
Shields : and how they come to light fo happily in-
to the hands of thofe Aerial men of War, efpecially
the vapours of Metals (if they have any) being|
heavier in alllikelyhood then the reek of Animals
and men : and laftly how they come todifchargeac
one another and to fight, there being neither life
nor foul in them ; and whether Sounds alfo have
their ExuvU that are referved till thefe folcmnkiesj
for ^t Jiborougbm SnffoiJ^i 6 i^2, were heard in the

are men intoxicated, that willfully wink againft the
light ofNature, and are eftranged from the true
knowlcdg and acknowledgment of a God!
But there is another Evafion, which the fame fe-
dulous Infinuator of Atheifm, would make ufe of, in
cafe this ftiould not hold, which feemsmore fobcr,
but no lefs falf: and that is this; That thefe fightings
and skirmifliings in the Aire, are onely the reflexi-
on of fome real battel on the earth; But this irt
Nature is plainly impoffiblc: For of neceflity thefc
Armies thus fighting, being at fuch a diftance frosa
the Speftators, that the fame of the Battel never ar-
rives to their ears, their eyes can never behold it by
any refleftion from the Clouds, For bcfides that,re-
fle6:ion makes the images more dimn then direft
fight, fuch a diftance from the Army to the Clouds,
and then from the Clouds to our Eye, will leflen the
Species fo exceedingly, that they will not at all be
vifible.
Or ifwe could imag!ne,that there might be fome-
timcs fuch an advantage in the figure ofthefe clouds,
as might in fome fort remedy this Itffening of the
fp<cies, yet theirOirfaccs are fo exceeding rudely
polinicd, and refleftion which,as I faid, is ever dim
enough ofit fel f, is here fo extraordinarily imper-
feft, that they can never be able, according to the
courfe of nature, to return the fpccies ofTerreftri*
al Objefts back again to our fight, it being fo evi-
dent that they arc unfit for what is offarr Icfle diffi-
culty. For we never finde them able to refleft the

hence, that there are fome Hiftorians that affirm,
that they made fome of thefe Tutelar gods, under
certain Confteliations: butthepoyfon of Idolatry
having infected the beft ofSciences, was the caufe,
that, the.e Images being afterwards taken for god?,
the true and legitimate manner of making them was
fmothered, and quite loft. They were wont alfo
to fet up fome ofthefe ielefntans upon the Prow of
their Ships,tQprcferve them from Shipwrack : and
all this to be done Naturally too ; feeing that a
Telefman may be made, under the Sign of VifceSy that
inay,forfome certain time, render thcWaterscalmj

You may fee further, concerning this particular,

up oftheCcJelefnianSj or Images, in their VeflTels, a-
gainft Shipwracks, is fo Ancient, that they fay, that
among thofe that came with lEneas from Trojf, there
was on€ that had the Figure of two Lyons : that the
Gadarenes\\di6. one, with the Image of aHorfe: and
that the Ship oi Alexandria y which ^t.P/^w/ failed in,
had the Images ofCaftor and ToUuXy or, according to
the Arabiansy the Gemini graved on it : and that
which carried Hippocrates^ when he took his journey
to Ahdera, for the curing oi'DemocrititSy bare the Fi-
gure of the 5un. Now all thefe 7elefmans were not
made fo much for the avoiding of .Shipwrack only,
as for the turning away offome other Difaftrous ac-
cidents, or the procuring of fome good fortune, or
other. And from this praftife of the Ancients have
the Chriflians taken Example, though in aChri-
ftianway, of having Images in their Veflcls, and
Piduring in them, the -Saints whofe names they
bear.

But lince thac 1 am iinawars fallen upon this
choice Peice of Antiquity, I flffall here further adde
that thefe ^eleftndHs were not fet up in Cities oncly,
and Ships, but alfo in the plauijop^a fields loo;and
it may be , that that Stone fo much famed among
the Turks , which they c^U Bradan, and is fct up
at fAecha, being foure foot long, and two foot broad
as 5«/^*« reports, was only, a Te'/fpw/2«. For other-
wife we muft even content our felves with Turkifh
Fables, and believe, that it would never have been
fo highly prized by them, but for that it iferved in-
ftead of a bed to Ahraham^ when he had knowledg of
his Maid Hagar: For bciides that,this is ridiculouSj
the Turks will never acknowledg themfelvcs to be
Baftards, and defcended frQio a .^ervant^m^id j but
irom Sarah : and this is the reafon, that they arc fo
much delighted in being ealled Sarafitis^^ Others fay
jthat the reafon why the Turks have this ^tonein fo
'much Veneration,is, becaufe that Abraham tyed his
pameltoit, when he went up to the top of the
^Mountain to facrifice his fon y as Euthymm Zigabc"
nm affirmes; or, as feme others of the more Trifling
fort of the Arabian Writers will have it, becaufe ic
was crefted hi memory of a certain Holy Woman,
who was taken up into Heaven, and afterwards ho-
noured upon earth as a goddef?, for having very
charitably ctitertained the Angels -4rftt z\\<MdarQt,
That which moved thefe latter to forge thefe Fa-
bles, was the Figure of Kfww^jwhich is ingraved up-
bnthisftone, with a Crc^pwt: and this is that which
makes me believe, that it was a TV/t'/'m/z^ of this Pla-
ner, which, as Mr Selden (ayes, was anciently taken
through all Afia^ for the Moon. And for this caufe
it
is,
that this people hath Yriday in the fame Vene-

thefe Images, that had been nudeJopg before, and
feeing them to have fuch :^dniirable, cri^nge Ver-
tues in them ; being unable toapprehefvd ctic rca-
fon of thefe things, they prefently betook them-

Kofie Crucians ufually propofe to thcmfelves what
EfFeft they would have thefe Images produce , whe-
ther to chafe away fome hurtful reafts 5 or, to al-
lay the violence of Winds, to prevent Lightnings,
andHailes to cure certain Difeafes, and the like.
This being firft propofed, they then fcarch after the
mean?, that may be proper for the attaining of the
End propofed : as, for example, for the Cure of the
Dropfie, it is to be confidered, that the Difeafe con-
iifts in Moifture : they are therefore not to take any
matter indifferently, for to ingrave, and forme,
under fuch and fuch Conftellations , but it muft be
fomething, that is of a fubftance naturally hot and
dry. Secondly, they muft take, for the r*»fcendent,
fome (ign that is like wife hot and dry j as Aries, for
inftance. In the Third place, they muft make
choyce offome Star, to which this Malady is fub-
^eft; fuch as 5^t«r»^ is faid to be: but there being
iieedalfoof fome S'tar that is very moift, (to the
tnd chat Sympathy, which is fo powerful in all
things, may aflift alfo in this particular j ) they may
taketheMoo»in her Wane. For, as the curing of
the biting ofa Viper, they mixe fome of its fiefti,
With the Antidote ; in like manner, for the expel-
ling of thefe waceriQi humors, we muft makeufeof
that St;^i, which hath the greateft affinity with the

being thus diligently obfervedj the Beames
of the ^'tars, finding
a

by theRefembianceand Harmony that they there
find, as that being once taken in, they do after-
wards Operate on that, which they find to oe fembl-
able. In all the other operations, they proceede
after the fame manner
:
as-, ^r Example, to chafe

thought by any a hard thing to conceive, how theft
living Creatures (hould have any fenfe of this in- ,
flucncc; let them but con (idcr, that there are fome
Perfons that bear foftrangea hatred to Cats, oro-
ther likeBeaftsJ as that if there be any within the

not. It is reported alfo, that there is a certain herb^^
that Cats will fcent, at a very great diftance : info-
much, that ifone lay it upon the top of a Houfe, or
in a Chamber, you (hall have them come from very
far, to tumble, and roulethemfelves on it. Many
things are delivered by the Naturalifts,which are in
appearance, much more Incredible then thefe.
And now it is no hard matter to conceive, how
thePower of Te/e/?«/?«5 comes at this day to be fo^^
undervalued; for thofe that have written of this
fubjeft, have mixed fo many, both confufed> arid
dangerous things together in their writings; that.
people making no diftinftion at all betwixt the good
and the bad, do equally abhor all, whitfoever bears
but the very name of Figure, or Telefnian. But we
(hall, in th^ profecution of this difcourfe, fever the
good Corn from the Darnel; and (hall Qiew, that,
in the making of thefe Figures, all words are indif-
ferent 5 and that they ferve but toamufe thelim-
pler fort of people. As, vjhtn AlhinM VilknoveHfn
faies, that for to cure the Tertian, and Quartan
Ague, the pain ofthe Nerves, Ventricle, and Privy
part, you rnuft grave the Image of a Scorpion upon
a piece of Gold, or Silver, when the Sun is in his

Or any thing elfe.
We confefs that the living Scorpion is not at all

be applied to the Wound, it curech
it,

fo doth the Crocodile, the Rat,

if
in

feeing that thofe, that are
moft skilled in the wonderfull Works of God^ do
certainly alTure us, that where ever any Difeafe
is

is
the Remedy to be had. And
who would ever have thought, that the Gravel,

Beautiful works in us,an tfFe^ quite contrary. Be-
fides. Beautiful Obje^s do lo move us, as that we
love them ; which foule,and Ill-favoured do not at

Power to Operate. Veirio anfwers nothing to this,
but only to the Confequence ; denying that Magi-

Children may eafily perceive, that his Antecedent
is utterly falfc. For, thofe Figures, which he calls
Magical^ and we Telefmamcai, are truly, and really.
Beautiful, or Deformed, according as the things
are, which they reprefent, which are, for the moft
part,the Heavens, and the Stars; the Beauty where-
of ravifhet hour Senfes. Befides, thefe Figures do
ordinarily rcprefent fome Conftellation or other 5
as the Virgin^ the 7wmSy and the reft. Now if a
living Virgin, and living Twins, are Beautiful, or
Deformed ; why then (hould not their Figures, or

Iron to fwini upon the Water , T>elrio anfwers, that
this Figure IS only accidental: fjr, faith he, let this
lirge, thin piece of Iron be reduced into fome o-
ther Figure, either Circular, Square, or ^wt angled,
it will do the fame : that is to fajr, it will ftill fwim
upon tre water : therefore the figure operates not,
but by accident; But here Belin deceives himfelfe :
forC^zjft^w'ipurpofe is not to oppofe one flat figure,
or, as the Mathematicians fpeak, hxTlam^ againft
another flat figure, either Square^ or Circular; but
a plaine, flat Figure, againft a folid one. For a flat
Figure, whether it be Square, Circular, Oftogonal,
orof what fadiion foe ver it be, will do that, which
the fa rue figure, ifitbefolid, will not do: which is
moft true ; feeing that a piece of Iron that is fquare,
and thick wirhall, iinkes prcfently to the bottom of
the water ; which the fame piece ofIron would not
do, were it fquare, and very tl\in ; it is thereforea
moft undeniable Maxime, that Figure hath fome po-
wer to Operate.
Other Obieftions which are made againft the po-
wer of thcfc Image?, are fet down, and refuted by
Galeottus^VeVonru^apromifccz^.tht moft weighty of
which, arethefe following.
In thtfe Images which are ingraved on Gold, for
file Cure of the ''tonr, and the pain in the Rein:-',
the Gold of Its own Nature cannot work this Cure i
much Icfs then can the Image; which being without
life^ cannot by any means alter the Gold, and
change it into another Nature. Bciides,in the Image
there is found neither aftion, norpallion: againjthe
Gold of it felfe, whether it be figured, or not, is ftill

the fame manner : and ifit fliould work rather upon
Gold which is figured, then upon that which is
plain 5 this Aftion would feem to proceed, rather
from the Eledion of the Heavens, then froiii any
other caufc. In a word, the Vertue which is attri-
buted to this Figure, can neither be Natural, nor
Artificial : Not Natural, becaufe it proceeds from
within; muchlefs is it Artificial j becaufe it is not
communicated unto it by the Artificer: it niuft
therefore neceflarily proceed from fome other
Caufe.

He brings in the fame inftance of Looking-glafles ;
^mong which thofc that are hollow, receive the
beams of the Sun, info full a meafure, as that they
burne 5 and others receive them fcarcely at all. So
the diverfity of Hilb, and Valiies, is thecaufeofa

^id an inftance in pieces of Ice, which the Sun can-
not fo eafily meic and diffolve, if they be plain, and
fmooch i but very eaiily, if they be uneven, and
rough. Which hath given occalion to fome to fay,

which is mo I true. As for Gold, although the

ding it renders it more Apt, and proper for fuch an
aftion : asvvatcr^ cold, and hot, though it be ftill
thtizmt Species^ yet the one will boyl our meat,
when the other will not. Which ma^cs Galeottus
to conclude, inthefc termes : Kequiritur ergo^ inu^

It hath alfo been obje6led,againft Francifcm Kueuf,
who undertook the defence of this Kind of Sculp-
ture, after Galeottus^ that if it be indued with fuch
wonderful Vertues,Man's workmanfhip (hould then
have more power, then God*s: feeing that the
Graved figure of a Lion fhould be able to cure the
Tainof thcReins 5 which a living L;on could not
do. To this he anfwers,and that very pertinently,
that, that which Man does, is as well the work of
God, as that which God himfelf does-, feeing that
weaiebut his inftruments; and that all our Aftions,
according (o the Apoftle, are in him, and depend
on him. Bcfide?, we fomcimes fee, that that which

tervertue, then that which God hath (imply crea-

Naturaiifts have yet found out.
Tho e,who have diligently examined the choiceft

that there is nothing that is moreabfurd,in Appea-

had allotted a Caftor, and a Tollux^ Dominion there;
this might have been interpreted an Error of Love;
which fuffers us not to be content, in wifhing fmall
Honours to thofe we Lov c. This con fid era t ion
might alfo have fatisfied thoC:, who complained,
that theCeleftial figures were nothing elfe, but the
reprefeatations of the fevcral fcapes of Jufiter^ and
that the whole face of the Heavens was filled, with
the notes of his inceftuous pranks : fo that if any
one (hould undertake to excufe thefeAmorous figns,
he would be the lefTe blame worthy j in that he did
it, only in defence of the moft fwcct, and powerful
of all our palTions. The excufe of thofe, who im-
pofed upon thefe incorruptible bodies,the figures of
bruit bcafts, that arc moft fubje^ to corruption,and
even ofthings inanimate alfo, was moft juft, feeing
that, info doing, they had no other defign, but
what was Religious. Thus we fee Fifties theie,Cen«
cers,and eares ofCorn in a V^irgins hand: And,
thofe who are skilled in the fecrets of the Ancienc
Theology , know well enough , that it was not
without fome Myfticall reafon, that they placed
one Crown in the fouth part of Heaven, confifting
of thirteen bright Starrs , and another in the nor-
thern part, containing eight Starrs in it. But to
place Dragons there, and berpencB, and Hydra
'«5
reafon can never endure. And yec, fee the ftrang-
neffe of the things! For though the Ancients had
thus filled the Heavens with bruit Beafts; and that
according to this their Do£trine, one would have
imagined this Casleftial Paradife to have been, an
habitacioa of Monfters, and
a
dreadfull Wildcrnefe,

rather then the Seat of the Bleflfedj and a place a-

withftanding, neither had the Church even repro-
ved it, nor any of the antient Fathers difavowed

dalous 5 and by confequence more tolerable. For
what danger can there be in affirming; that the di-
verfe figures oft he ftarrs reprefent and make up,
the different characters of the Hebrew Alphabet.?
And that as thefe Letters have fome fignification
when they are fingle5as wel as when they are joy ned

or joyned with other Starri5, do note unto us fome

that all thefe Starrs have not their Order beftowed

ferently Afpeftsare not utterly ufelcfle, and with-

it would be no lefle then Blafphemy in any man to
affirm the contrary; ortofay, that they are only
placed there, onely for ornament and to beautifie
theheavens, and to give light ; ind for no other
caufe at all. But what madnefle is it to confine

Prophecies , that are written in Books, are not the
Caiife ofthofe Events, which they foretell (hall hap-
pen ; but onely, the Signe ; in like manner, faith he,
may the Heavens very juftly be called a 8ook,wherc-
in God hath written,ail that isjhath been,and here-
after fnall be. And, for confirmation of this , he
citeth a pafTage cut of a Book , the Title whereof is,
Narratio Jofeph^ a Book in his time highly cfteemed
by all men : Wherein the Patriarch Jacob ^ givuig
his blcfling to all his Children, tells them , That he

As for our modern Writer?, it would even amaze
a man toconfider, that among fuch infinite num-

Now that which makes me believe, that this learned
man had fome grounds of this his Confident aflii-
rance of having fuch knowledg in the Temple of
VVifdome, is, that befide the experience which pof-
iibly he might have had ; he had often alfo travailed
in the Eaftsrn parts *, where he had no doubt feen
the Books of the ^r^^'i^^i, which are all full of this
kind ofSecret learning. And John Leo, in his Hifto-
ry of 4/ric^, affirmeth, that, in Marocca^ there is
nothing more common: and the firft Book which

is
a
Book written by Elhoniy

cribeall the Coiiftellations in

as the Arabians Hermitcs do alwaies carry about
them, and have them ready for their life, in apply-
ing them to the Rules oftheir Zairagla^ or Divina-

nefleth in divers places of his Printed BookSjasthat
uwasnot without reafon that he fo eaxneftly com-

well be doubted, which of the two, this Cdefiiall
writing is expieffed in 5 and which of thefe Langiia-^

thmk fit to decide, before I go any further.

for example, in the Scars that make up the Conftel

by
reafon that they are

do difturb the Fancy, and hinder

defircs. The fame alfo may
be ^id ofT^wn^
;
for there are Eleven Stars to be
feen there, which arc eflentially of this Conftellati-
pn
5
and yet are not brought in^ in the Pidure of it.
So likewife in the Conftellation o( Gemini there
*
*
are Stars belonging to it^ which are diftingui-
^* (bed from thofe Nineteen, that reprefent the
*
V
igure of this Sign:
as Cancer alfo hath four

bright Stars, which lie loofe from thqfe nine,
^^which make up the Image of this living Crea-
^* cure. But as for the Hebrew letters, there
is
*
nothing to hinder us, from finding them
* diftin^fcly delcribed
:
and
if
any one do chance
*
"^
to find either Arahick^y or Samaritane Letters
there
;
this isftill but to return? back to the Origi-
gial. from whence they were takcu.
Firft then we are to take nocice, that the Stars
which make upthefe Letters^ are not difpofed into
the order they appear in, at ^11 adventures, nor in
any confufed way, as they feem to us to be
:
but are
placed thus, with foine Uefign, and in

der; Cod having made all things in full Perfeftion.

this difference in the placing of the pieces is To
great, as that he will certainly conclude, that the
whole bufinefs is clearly without any deligne at all ;
notwithftanding that they are all ranked in verycx-
^Ot order ; and that there is not the leaft piece there,
but is of ufe, and doth its proper office. After the
fame manner is it with the Sears, which we fee in
the Heavens ; for, though in fome places you fee
many togctherjandin others buta fewjand that the
order they ftand in, looks confufedly^and in a man-
ner rediculous ; yet neverthelefs is it moftadnijr*
able, initfelf, and proceeds from fome moil won"
derful defigne ; which thofc men perfectly under-
hand, who by this holy Life, arc elevated above all
that is here below. Thus it is ftoried of St. Anthony^ •
that he perfectly undcrftood thifi Heavenly Writings
which we taught before.
Secondly, that although the Stars which areiq

therefore alwayes compofe the fame letters, at leaft,
the greateft part of them j but they have their
changes, according to the diverfc Afpefts of the

the Kabbhis^ that this Writing ferves not, but for the
ftiewing of thing to come. And by this writing we
told Major KfV^/, Captaiu fi//, ani y\^]ov Maliracl^

here delivered ; namely that all thefe new Stars
have been the Fore runner of the greateft Muta-
tions that have happened : and that in default
of thefe. Comets have appeared; which, though
- they arc eafily diftinguifhed from true Stars, and
have their place of being in tl>€ Aire only ; yet h ave
they ferved to reprefent, by their diverfe Afpe^^s,
(according to the Doftrine of the Kahhines^) Other
Letters, and to forefliew the Difafters that have
happened : it being very ncceflary ffay they^ to
have afpecial regard tothefenewlightsj which are
as a new Letter, which being added to a word, al-
ters the (ti\^t of it. As, for Example, in this word
AKE, ifone add an L, it will be no longer AKE,
but LAKE. Or if in the middeft of this word
A K E> one infert an R, it will alter the word, and
make it ARKE. So that we fee, one only Letter,
as an L, or an R, utterly changeth the whole Senfe.

lytoiindcrftand this CeleftiallTritingy we muftex-
a^ly obfervc the vertical Stars ; for, thofe which are
over a Kingdome, faith Abindan^do ordinarily (hew,
what ever is like to befall it. And in this fenfe, it
will not be any hard matter to apprehend the mea-
ning oi Cardan^ when he faies, (peaking of the Star
in theTaiioft/y/^A/^jor, that it hath forefliewed
the changes of all the Great Empires : underftan-
ding this to be the fenfe of this Truth, delivered by
Cardan ; that, according to the Doftrine here laid
down, this Star, though not Alone, and by it fclf,
yetjoyned with others, hath fhewedthefe changes;
tnaking up, by their Conjunction, fuch Entire
words, as did forc-fticw the fall, or rife of thcfe Em-
pires, either clearly, and plainly ; or elfe perhaps,
more fecretly, and Myftically, as we (hall (hew here-
after. Now, as in all forts of Writing, there is one
certain Letter, both in Nounes and Verbs^ which i^
more frequent then any other, and hath the Pre-
minence throughout all thefeveral CoHJugatiom^ and
Vecknfions *, in the like manner in this Celejlialwri*
ting^ it hath been obferved, that in all the Mutati-
ons of Empires, this Star, in the Taile of the afore-
faid Conftcllation, hath been more eminently noted
then any other : Either becaufe it is more frequent,
in the difcourfeof Monarchies, then any ottier : Or
elfe, that it is as the Capital letter, in the moft figni-
ficacive words j as we fee there is in all proper
Names, of almoflall the languages in the World :
as for example, in the nameof Ho'^<?>i,the firft letter
ig greater, then any of the reft that follow. And
thus may we anfwer this queftion, which fome may
happily make; namely. Why, in this Ccleftial wri-
ting, there are both little, and great Stars alfo ? If
it be furth:r demiinded j Why, in this kind ofwri^-

UHg^ there are, in one and the fame word, great^
and fmal Letters, or Stars, mingled together? It
may be anfwered, that the Reafon
is,
to make us
take more notice ofthofe letters in the word, which
are the moft fignificative; which
is
a
courfc, that
the Anagrammatifts arc very well acquainted with-
all. As, for example,
if
in the word Soveraignty^
I
would have VEKlIT^ to be efpecially ob-
ferved,
1
will write the word Soveraignty^ in this
manner, foVERalgnTY
:
where the letters of the
Word FfillTr, arc greater, then any of the reft.
Or
if
the word Keprefentativey
I
would havCj Frefenty
to be chiefly taken notice of,
I
would then write the
whole word thus, rePRESENTativc. Wc are not
then to wonder,
if
in the Heavens we often fee two,
or three great Stars to go to the Compofition of
a
word, wherein there are fmal Stars alfo: and this
is
thatjwhich wc are to have moft particular regard
unto, fas we have already (hewed, when they are
Vertical to anyplace. And
by
this means may we
be able to give
a
Reafon of that, which hath been
hitherto Unknown
:
as, when the Aftrologers affirm,
that when Caput Algol^ or Medufa's Head,
was Vertical to Greece
5
the ftars did fore- with
*
*
ftiew tl\e Calamities, which afterwards
*
happened unto it, by theTyranny of the
*
*
Mahometans
;
without giving us any Rea-
*
*
fon why
:
no more then they do of their In tbeFigure
Confidence^ in aCTq ring us, that the fame
Conftellation, which will in
a
ftiort time beVer*
tical to France alfo, fore-fhews
a
ftranqe Dcfolation,
that
is
to fall upon that Country. Now all thefe
difafters, though, accordnig as they are foretold, fo
do they certainly come to pafs
5

NoWjWhy the good fortunes ofiplacC fhould be read^^
from the Weft, towards theEaft, rather then from
the Eaft^towards the South: and why thiill fortune
rs likewife to be read, from the Norths toward the

thor. However, I (hall adventure to give this conjc-
fture at it: namely^that feeing that Nature^bcing at
liberty, and not hindredby anything, alwaicsten-
deth to the beft: and that, as Ariflotle faith, !c would
alwayes bring forth Males, as being more perfeft
creatures then females are,tf it were not hindred by
fome repugnant Caufe: it is moft propcr^that good
things, andall perfcdions, (hould be read, from
the Weft towards the Eaftjfeeing that this is the free
and natural motion of the Stars; the other from
the Eaft to the Weft^ being a contrary and forced
motion. As for
ill
fortune, and Difaftcrs
,
they
might according to this principle, have been read
fiora the eaft toward the weft, had not the Oracle
which cannot lye, uttered this wonderful truth
:
A
Septentrione pandetur malum^ J^r.i. 14. All evill
commetb from the North. But, why from the Notth
rather than from any othef part ofthe world? The
reafon of this
is
not fo eaiily given
:
vet
I
conceive
it
would ftand with found Phylofopny, to anfwer;
thar by reafon of the darknefTe and gloomineffe of
chf Aire ofthofe parts;caufed
by
the great diftancc
oftheSuni and alfo
by
reafonof the evil fpirits,
which are the Authors of fo much evil, and which
inhabitc darkc places
;
a
man may very reafonably
iay chat all misfortunes come from the North
;
as
bring

is
full of thefe evill fpirits, or

as
is
tertified in The Harmony

And from hence,
it
will bean calie matter to ap-
prehend ihe reafon, why the Ancients figured iti

thctrue HieroglyphicksofTyrany, Violence, and
all manner of OpprefTion. And certainly , who
ever (hall but run over the Annals, will finde, that
all the great defolationsthat have ever happened 5
have come from the Northern Parts. The Ajfyri^
ttns^ or Chaldeans^ fet on by Nabuchadonofor^ and SaL
ntanafar , have fufficiently manifefted the Truth of
this, in burning to the ground a Cityjand a Temple,
that was both the raoft -Sumptuous, and the moft
holy in the worlds and in the utter ruine ofa Peo-
ple, whom God himfelf had taken into his own fpe-
cial proteftion, and whofe father he particularly
called himfelf. And hath notKow/^, like afecond
Jerufalent^ in like manner often felt the fury, of this
/\ccurfed Generation of the North ; when by the

Ruine, Now if we reckon from the year of our
Lord 630. which was the year faccording to our

from this prefenc year 1659. this Kingdonie is to
laft but five years longer.
The other Eaftern Kingdoms, whofe Declining is
pointed out by the Stars, according to Gafferd^ is
that of China : but this Author delivers hinifelf in
fuch an obfcurc manner, in difeourfing of this
of Angels Writing-^ as that, till I underftand
it better, i fhall forbear to fet it down. Hepro-
duceth alfo diverfc others, which doe define the

Temple is affeded.
Now that I may freely deliver my own Ju igmene
concerning this(rriti»g of Angels,! mufttake liberty
to propofe fome few Objections, v\ hich,l have found
may be brought a^iainft ic.
The firft is, that iffo be, by this Writing^ all the
Great Mutations in the World may be known j it is
polFible then, that the End of the World may in like
manner be fouudout by it , as bemg the greateft>

and moft Important ofall the reft
:
to that men may
by
a
natural meanSjattainjto the knowledge of this
great Secret: whrch
is
contrary to the Holy Scrip-
tures.
Thefecond is'j that Aftrologers have been able
to foretell many of theie Mutations, which have af-
terwards come to pafie accordingly
j
and yet have
never had any knowledge of this ftrange kinde of
JVriting
:
It
istheiefore Ufeleflejand Imaginary,
The third
is,
that the polition ofthe Stars
is
not
fo eflential to the Letter^which
it
is
brought to make
lip, but that the fame Star may as well make, for
Example,
a
Kefchy as
a
Daletb', and fo of all the reih
and confequently, fevcrall men forming feveral
Characters of the fame Stars, may draw from them
contrary fenfes, the one to the other.
Buttoallthcfe objeftions
I
anfwer briefly thus.
To the firft
I
fay, that
it
is
not neceflary, that this
Writing of Angels (hould forelliew the end of the
World; becaufe that God may have referved this
fecret to himfelf
:
Or eUe, that
it
would really fore-
tell this hereafter^ when thofe other fignes, fee down
by the Evangelifts, (hall (hew
it
alfo:
it
being all one
to fay
,
that the ^tars (hall forfliew
it
by fome cer-
tain Writing, astofay, that the Sun and the Moon
fhall foretell
it
by their being darkned.
Tothcfecondl anfwcrs that the foure grand
caufes, which (according to the opinion of the A-
ftrologers) produce the greateft Mutations, the (irft
whereof is, the changing of the Jpogaum and Pm-
g£um chhePhntts: thefecond,thechanging^ofthe
Excentricity ofthe Sun, of Vems^ oiMercurj^ of Sa-

fupenour Planets : I foy^ chat all thefe foure can-
fes may for the moft part, be comprized within this
Writing of Angels: that is to fay^ that it hath h^pued
very oftenjthat at what time this Writing of Angels
did point out fome great change^ there was at the
fame timealfo aConJunftion of the Superiour Pla-
nets, Saturn and Jupter^ or elfe, fome one of the
three other forenamed caufes. So that they,'
nocunderftanding any thing of this Writing of
Angels imputed thofe changes which ihey
obferved to come to pafs, to thofe four Reafors
only. But that it may clearly appear unto us, that
thefe have not been the true caufes of all thefe
changes, we need but have recourfe to the Chro-
mlogies^zndi Particular Annals of eacli feveral Kmg-
dome, and compare them with the AftroJogical Ob-
fervations •, and we (hall finde, that the greaceft
part of all the grand Mutations have happened,
without any Coniunfl:ion of the greater Planets, or
any of the other Caufes before fpecihed. So that
we muft neceffarily flye to fome other more Certain
means, by which we may be able to foreknow, by,
the Afpefts, and motions of the Stars, all thefe E-
vents. Now this means can be Jio other, as it feem-
eth, to this writing oi Angels and Genii,
To the third Objection, which feemeth to have
the moft weight in
it,
it
may be anfwere
J,
that
it
is
true indeed, that
a
Man may make
a
'Rtfch of the
fame ftar, that another man perhaps vvill make
a
Dalethof: butinthis, as in many othsr things, we
are to follow the Tradition of the Ancients, and to
reft fatisfied with what they have delivered unto us.
Otherwife, there will not be any certainty at
al
I,
in
any one of the reft of the Sciences; efpeclally in
Aitrology
:
which requireth, that thofe f}ars which
L
4
compofe
10^ T£je Temple ^/Wifdome. Book I.
compofej for example, the Conftellation of y^r/>^,
or the Kamm.^ fhoiild be defcribed rather in the
figure ofthis Beafl, then in that ofan Oxe^ or a Horfe^
and fo in all the reft. So that who ever fliould re-
prefent the figure of a BuU^ among the ftars that
belong to the Kamme ; and the figure of a Kamme^
among thofe of the Bull; he would deftroy the ve-
i*y Principles of Aftrology : notv/ithftanding that
iheftars oilaurm would as well bear the figure of a
^amme^ as ofa B'uU, In like niannerj he that fhoul4
iiiake a Kfp^of fuch a ftar, as he fhould have made
a Valeth of^ notwithflanding that theftarwould
bear it, yet would he overthrow the Principles of
this writing of Angels and Genii,

cals theSunthefountani ofCeleftial light, and ma-

Globe of the Sun doth ftnd forth its raycs on all
(ides, as it were a fpirit through all things, diftribu-
tlng life, fenfe and piotion to the very Univerfe.
Hence the ancient Naturalifts called the Sun the
very heart of heaven ; and the Caldeans put it as the
middle of Planets.The Egyptians alfo placed it in the
middle of the world, z^/;^. betwixt the two fives of
tlie world, f, i. above the Sun they place five Planets,

tal; but I call their times, dayes and hours diftri*
buted to their Dominions; Concerning all thefe^
it is abundantly taught in the books of Allrologersj
'but in this pi ace two things eipccially are to be con^
fideredandobfci'vedby lis. One, that we obferve
the motions and afcenuons and windings of Stars,
even as they are in truth in the eight fphere,through
the negleft of which, it happeneth that many ere
infabricating theCeleftial Imagcs,and are defrauded

obferve, is about the times ofchoofing the planetary
hpurs ; for almoft all Aftrologers divide all that
Cpaceof time fr^om the Sun-rifing to fctcing into
twelve equal parts, and call them the twelve hours
of the day j then the time which foiloweth from
.thefettingto therifing, in like manner being divi-
ded into twelve equal ^arts, they call the twelve
hours of the night,a'nd then diftribute each ofthofc

every one by order, even to the end of twenty four
hours-, and in this distribution the Magicians agree
with them j but in the partition of the hours fome
dodiffenr, faying, that thefpace of the riling and
fetting is not to be divided into equal part^i and
that thofe hours are not therefore called unequal,
becaufe the diurnal arc unequal to the nofturnal,
but becaufe both the diurnal and nodkurnal are
even unequal amongll thcnifelves 5 therefore the
partition of unequal or Planetary hours hath a dif-
ferent reafon of their meafure obferved by Magici-
ans, which is ofthis fort 5 for as inartificial hours>
which are alwayes equal to themfelves, the afcenfi-
ons of fifteen degrees in theequinoftial, conftitut-
cth an artificial hour : fo alfo in planetary hours^the
afcenlions of nfteen degrees in the Ecliptkke con-
ftituteth an unequal or planetary hour, whofe mea-
fure we ought to enquire and find out by the tables
ofthe oblique afceiijions of every region.

Doftor, thusconfirmeth in his book de fato^ when
he faith, that even garments, buildings and other
artificial works whacfoever, do receive a certain
qualification from the ftars *, fo the Magicians afiirmj
that not only by the mixture and application of na-
tural things, but alfoin Images, Seals, Ring«,Glaf-
ies, and fonic other Inftrument?, being opportune**
\y framed under a certain conftellation, fome tele-
ftial Illuftration may be taken, and fome wonderful
thing may be received ; for the beams of the Ceie-
ftial bodies being animated, living, fenfual, and
bringing along with them admirable gift?, and a
a moft violent power, do, even in am6ment,andat
(he firft touch, imprint wonderful powers in the
Images, though their matter be lefs capable. Yet
they bellow more powerful vertucs on the Images,
if they be framed not ofany, but of a certam mat-
ter, namely whofe natural, and alfo fpecifical ver-
tue is agreeable with the work, and th^ figure of the
image is like to the Ceieftial ; for fuch an Image,'
both in regard of the matter naturally congruous
to the operation and Ceieftial iiifluence, and alfo
for its figure being like to the heavenly one, is beft
prepared to receive the operations and powers of
theCelcftiah bodies and figures, and inftantly re-
celveth the Heavenly gift into it lelf^ then it con-
ftantly worketh on another things and other things
do yeild obedience to tt. Hence faith Ptolemy in ceH-^
iilcquio^that inferior things doobey theCeleftial,and
not only them, but alfo even their Iniagcs ; Even as
earthly Scorpions obey not only the Ceieftial Scor-
pion, but alfo hi5 Image, if itfhall be opportunely

This Tradition of the Arabian includes another

their Metropolitan Cities under a certain Configura*
tion ofthe Heavens^ihe raoft propitious that could be
crcftcd for the time being.

as Glycas thinketh. And moreover before the tak-
ing of the City by Mahovnet the fecond, a great
Conjunftion was obfcrved under the Horofcope, But
in affigning the Afcendent of this City, the Greek^s
and Arabians agree not, nor the Arabians them- c

This Superftition hath b^en as commonly

and more lately pra6tifed in the JVeji. *
At the inftauration of Konte by Faul the

Vincentius Canfpanatius obferved the time by h'lsAjirt'

the Cardinal laid the ^v^ftone.
The cnrious may fee feveral Nativities of Cities,
Forts, andCaftles, with the Judgements given in
CaHrichs^JundtH^ GarcanSy&c.
The b igure ot the Old Lodging at Affrro« Col ledge
is yet to c feen in one of the Wardens Windowes.
I fet it not here down, becaufe it is already done by
another, in his Book called Sir, Cbr.Heydtyn's defence
for Aftrology.
Thefe Catholical Nativities were fo much belee-
V^dinbythe Ancient Kings^ faith H^/j*, that they
enquired into the Genitures of all the principal Nati
under th^ir dominions, where if the Planets were
found to look with a nialitious eye upon the Nati*
vityof the Kingdome, Interfieicuhant eum pierumj
quod ejus ilegnumerat contrar'B.egHum ipforum.
It may be feen alfo what Zonaras hath reported
of 7'iherim and Vomitian , Tom, 2. AnnaL p, 174.
& igS.
Now becaufe that in the W^tftiz/iriw o(Cities «j ItI
^yivUioif as in the Genitures oimtxiy ^faith ftolemyy
the Aftrology is the fame.
Therefore after conlideration had of the life and
being of the City from tht Horefcofe^ the next care
taken was of the kk^^^ twj tf^wf, or fart of Fortune^
the fecond Afcendent^Co called in the Figures of men,
or the Horofcofm Athhrum.

The F^rt 0/ For r««^ found our, was myfterioufly

The EfHperour offered up ApdiflAvroif ^v(rUv, In^

Briefly thus: The founders of old, at the buil-

<!aufed their Aftrologers to find owtz luchie foffion of
the HeavenSy under which the firft ftone might be
laid. The Part ofFortune found out in thisfirji Fi*

judged oftfte lively hood and duration. The fe-
cond of the outward Glory z\\A fortune of the City
under the influence of this latter configuration,,
ihey erected ^ Statue of Brafi into which this fort««tf

WE have fpoken in the foregoing Chapters
of the divers kindes of Uivina-ions ; But
this is to be noted^ that all thefe require the iife and
rules of Aftrology, as a key moft neceflhry for the
knowledge of all fccrets : and that all kindes of
Divinations whatfoevcr have their root and foun-
dation in Ailrologie, fo as that without ic they are
of little or no ufe 5 yet Aftrologicai Divination, in
as much astheCeleftials arecaufes andiignes ofalt

thofe things which are occult or future j of which
we (hall in this place fpeak no further ^ lince of this
Science huge Volumnes have been wrote by the An-
cients, and are every where extant. Therefore whe-
ther the Pbyiiognomifts look upon the body , or
countenance , or forehead , or hand or the Sooth-
fayer fearchcth by dreams or Aufpicia, that the
judgm^ent may be right, the tigure of heaven is alfo
to be enquired into. From the judgements where-
of, together v/ith conjeftures of fimilitudes and
fignes, are produced true opinions of the fignifica'
tors. Alfo if any prodigie feall appear, the Figure
of heaven is to be ereded ', alfofuch things are to
be enquired after, which have gone before in the
revolutions of years from great Conjunftion?,and
Eclipfes : then alfo the Nativities^ beginnings, in-

The fecond means which I havepropofed to my
felftoufe, for theproving ofthe Power of-thefe Fi-

that there is betwixt the Scorpion and its Imag-_,

Thofe then, that are well skilled in the Secrets of

that fiiit fet up Images in theirTemplea, refetnbling
the fhapes of Angels that have appeared upon Earth>
had nootherdelignin fodoing/ave oncly the more
^afiely to invite down thofe Blefied Spines , by the
force of the Refcmblance. And I know not whether
or no, by the very fame Vertue of Pvefemblance,
which i? found betwixt God and Men, QFaciantus
hontinem ad imaginem , & fimiiitudmem mjiritm :
) ic
hath not nghcly been affirmed by fome Divines,
that the Son of God would neverthcfs have become
man , (yet wuhout fufFering dcathj though Adam
had never fallen. But fpeaking ofthings, as they
are now at prefent, we know^, that J7^/*^ Ckrili is
found in the midft of thofe, that fpeak, wich Faith,
of his Njme: becaufethat when we fpeak wich Af-
fedion of any One^ we reprefent him to ourfelves
in our Imagitiation. When therefore, fpeaking of
Jefiis ChrijlyVie fane; him as he is s he isinftantly
prefent with us, appearing to our Hearts at thac
very inftant, that we there frame his Image by our
Imaguiation. So true it
is,
that the refemblance
hach the Power to work Wonders
,
even upon him
that hath Dependancc upon no other, and
is
not

as thefe are 10 be entertained with all Piety and

Story o\ the Princcffe^ that conceived and brought
forth a Black-Moore, though her fclf and her Hus-

ifthe Mother in the A^t, cither ftrongly fancy Rob-

Theef, Murtherer, or an Amorous perfon : iffhe
fancy Travelling, he will be a Traveller, if Dan-
cing, or playing on the Lute, he will be very Apt for
thefc things ; and fo ofthe reft. And we fee by daily
experience, the effefts of the ftrong Defires and
Longings of Mothcrs,during the time oftheir being
Vrith Child, upon their Children ; on whom the

Refemblanceofthe fame thing that they have deli-

Houfe of
The wonderful efffts, which have

^
*
wrought by 7eUfmatkd Figures^ have (o
% perplexed the minds of chofe men, who
^ ^ occount ever/ thing to be MagickjWhich
^ thenifelvesare not able to comprehend;
as that, without making any Diftinftion
at all, betwixt power which is Natural and lawful 9
and that which o ir Faith permits us not to med-
dle with; they have boldly publi(hed, that) what
Vertuc foever proceeds from Figures, is utterly
Diabolical. But when they perceived, that know-
ing /Vlen would hardly ^11 down fo ; and that it con^
cerned them to produce fome Reafons, to prove
that thcfe Figures can have no Natural Power at
all *, they have at length brought thefc following
ones ; though they are built on very weak founda-
tions, as we (hall make it appear.
The firft
is,
thar Reafon
it
felftels us, that thefe
Operations cannot be Totally natural, but rather
fuperftitious and dangerous
;
feeing that, to reduce
them to
a
full, and entire effect, thtre are fome cer*
tain words to be ufed
*,
which have no power at all,
efpecially over things which have no Senfe
,
and
that therefore, the making of them ought to be for-
bidden and rejected, as the Church hath ordai-
ned. Tp
Book I. Tie Temple ^/Wifdome, ^ 35 ^
To anfvvcr fully, and in order, both to this ob-
Jedion, and to the reft that fciloWj I fay; that, in
ihefirft placci, vvc are to take notice 3 that, in the
matter ofthefe figures, we have already condem-
ned all Words, and all other Superftitions : (o that,
toavoid a tedious Repetition, theReadcr muft call
to mind, what hath already been faid to this.
As for the Church, it never yet rejcded the True
and lawful Power of figures, fuch as we havedefcri*
bed it ; as may appear out of the writings of thofe
two learned Men, Iho, Aquinas^ and Cardinal Cajs^
tan. And ifthe Fathers have fometimes condem-
i»cd it ; it was not till they faw that it was fo mixed
with fuperliition (that 1 fay not, Abominations)
that they conceived they (hould never otherwife be
able to divert men from the Praftice of it, but by
condemning it utterly : as Mofes likcwife did, iii
forbidding abfolutcly the Graffing on a Tree of a
different kind, only to keep them from that ^n^
which was ufually committed at that A£^ion; And
that it may appear that the bare figures have noc
been ufcd alwaies,without any Application of words
and Ceremonies 5 Uichas were not only Vain, but
Ridiculous aUo ;vwe may take notice, that inJEgyp
when they would caufc Haile toccafe, which might
have been effefted by the Vertue of a bare lelefyne
only 5 it was thought NecefTary, that four nac^ed
Women (liould lye along upon the ground on their
backs : and lifcing up their feet on high, they were
to pronounce fomc cert:^in words, and fo the Haile
would ccafe. ^atuor Midterei (faid they, asK.M^?-

Cboiner^ was graven the Image of Venus lying along.
Befides^fome fgnoranc perfons having lighted upon
loHie ofthe Charafters, which the Ancients had in*
vented, that fo they might conceal their Philofophi-
cal Secrets, from the unworthy Rabble ; ( fuch as are
thofe wherewith the Chymifts books are full : ) not
knowing the Original of them, and believing that
they had fome fecretVertue in them, they graved
them on Telefmes. Such perhaps was the Egyptians
SerapiSj which had on its breaft the fo much Cele-
brated Letter ^ftf^. This infcribing of Cifres, and
Charai^ers, brought alfo along with it this belicfe;
that feeing there wereLctters written upon lele^mesy
they might certainly then be read alfo : and hence
did this fuperftition take Rife, of fpeaking words in
the making ofthcfe figures , and afterwards, of let-
ting alone the figure, and ufing the bare words or*-
ly : as it is reported of Irallianm^ who ufed thefe
words for the Cureof the Chollick ; (fivyi^(pivyi,u
Xo\h. And Homer writes, that the bleeding ofVUjJes
hiS wound wjs ftopped, by u(ing ccrtaine words:
aslikewifethat o^ Orcondates vvaSjin Heliodortis ',whOj
with Straho^ affirmes, that the Indians and Ethiopi-
ans, ufe no other way of curing their Difeafes. fr<?-
ijfr^rt nfTures us, that he hath fcen thefe Ceremonies
praftifed in his time : and even in Our daycf, they
arc ufed but too often, efpecially by Superftitious
Women. But at laft there were fome that made
moreefteeme of Cliarafters, then of plain Words,
confidering with themfelves what the power of fi-
gures was. T\\n^liny reports, that M. Servilius made
ufe of thefe two Letters, M,and >^, to keep himfelf
from being blear-eyed : and Eudoxia the£mpref>',
being
Book I. the Temple ^/Wifdome. 255
being in Travel with a Child, defired, fas CeeUren
reports)co have certain Letters applyed to her Belly,
for to bring forth the dead Child : but it was all in
vain 5 for ic coft her, her life. To conclude, thcfc
things havihg been invented only for the concealing
of foiiie '^ecrets, as we have faid^ (after Koger BacoHy
who faith, ^£ Thilofophi ad invenerant in oprihus ar»
tis^ & Natur£ utfecreta occultarent ab indigmSj) they
were afterwards turned into Superftition, by thofe
who mixed them with the Images, and made ufe of
them beyond the powerof Nature j and that too
with io Damnable Ceremonies, as that the very
thought of them is Irkfome. Read the Hurmony of
the fi orldj Lib 2.
Now that the Pra^licc ofmaking thefe figures was
never forbidden, but only to keep us off from thofe
Abominations^ that were ufually hepcby committed
fthe invention being nevcrthelefs natural, as we
have fliewed ; and the things themfelves having
been very Innocently ufed by good Men, without
rheafliftance of any other Power, favethat of Na-
ture) we may perceive by a like example, in the
command that was given, of not Grafting on a tree
of a different kind. For it was given for no other
Pvcafonfthac 1 may here pafs by thofe, which are
brought by interpreters, both ofGreek and Latine,
which are many times very wide of the Text) but
only to turne aivay the Jews from thofe filthinefles
and abominations, which they ufually committed
at thiskindofEngraffing. The Latine words will
in fome fort hide the uncleannefs of the difcourfe of
thefe Villanies : you (hall have them therefore out
ofthe above named Kabbi Mofes^ a man of very great

j
as we have already (hewed Now the reafon why
they have been alfo rcjeded by fome of the more

of the Inquifttion-y as the Italians and Spaniards have
done
:
or elfe, for want of having taken the pains
to examine them

But we have already anfwered, in theprecedent
Chapter's that we do not at all defend the follies of

reje£tedpart of the fooleries, delivered bv Ff//^«o-

tisfied, we do alfo here condemn thofe, which are
brought by AHtoniusMizaldus: as namely, where he
affirmes, according to Ptolomy^ that for to drive away
Serpents, you muft prepare a fqiiare Plate ofCop-
iper, and graving two Serpents on it 5 when the fc-
cond face of Aries is Afcendent, you muft fay thefe

alfo for the driving of Wolves away, either out of a
Wood or from a Sheep-coat, you muft grave upon a
Plate of Copper or Tin, the Image of a Wolfe, with
his feet tied^ and two Maftivcs feeming to bark at
him, when the fecond face of Sagittarim is Afcen-

J havefetdown fomany of thcfe words, that Men
may take notice ofthem to avoid them, and to give
warning of them to thofe that arc inquirers after
fuch things 5 who might happily have lighted on
them in the Authors own writings, which are full
of Superftitions. For, befides that the mannerof
making them is Ridiculous, it is aifo as far different
from the true way that is to be obfervedin making
them, as Heli is from Heaveu. So that I cannot
much wonder at the III Luck of a Friend of mine ;
whofaie?, that of above a hundred of thefeTe/^/1
mam that he had made, according to thefe vaine
Rules here delivered, he never faw any one of them
anfwer hisExpeftation. But I defiring him to make
one, according to the Dircftions I gave him -, he
prefently faw the effeft follow. And M. Robert
(Tnrnr a learned Phyfi ian makes them right, and^
the learned Eugenm Polymoy who is yet living,

that he hath cured a moft Iiuollerable pain in the

places he makes ufe of words both vain and fupsr-
ftitious, and alfo of moft falfe principles ; which is
thcRcaConjwhynoman could ever, byufingthcm,
attain to the end he propofcd. Now I have former-
ly faid, that we condemne all Figures and Word?,
that are mixed with Supcrftition, in thefe Tf/</??w-
tical Figures only; for, as for thofe Ceremonies
and words, which arc pioufly ufed ; as for ex-
ample, To caufe a ftorme of Haile to ceafes i
man may ufe them without any fufpicion at all, ac-
cording to the Judgement of fdme Divines. The
manner is thus defcribed by Wierus. Having firft
made thefign of theCrofs, againft the Lightning,
Haile, Thunder or Tempeft, you miift take three
Halle-ftones, of thofe that firft fell, and call them
into the fire, in the name of the Holy Trin'ty ; and
havi ng repeated the Lords Prayer two or three cimeg
over, you muft read the Gofpel ofSt.John: which
being cnded^ you muft make thefign oftheCrofs,
overagainft theCloude, and the Thunder, on every

toward the four quarters ofthe World : and after
that the Exorcijl fhall have faid three times, Verbum
caro fadum efl^ adding to it, as often thefe words ;
Ter Evangelica diUa fagiat tempefljf efta ; ifthe Tem-

matter til I fome other time ; only obferving at pre*

The third Objei^ion is grounded upon the Impo-

Thus it is argued by GuUelmm

manner, all the very fame Arguments, in a Book
that he hath written again a certain Phyfitian of
Mcntpelier^ who graved upon a piece of Goid^ the
Image of a Lyon, for the Cure of the Stone.
To this I anfwer, that the Image of it feif, is
dead, and without any motion : but that by the
Vertueof the Stars, under which it was made, it
hathaaquired new qualities, which it had not be-
fore : or elfe, that the matter being before indued
with fome qualities that were proper forfuchan ef-
fect, it is difpofed for fuch an effcft by a Semblable

it neceflTary) that the.vertue of Metals and of Stones
(hould be excited by the Celcftial Rayes, for the
rendering them apt to effed that which wedeiiie.
Now that thefe Rayes are fo powerful, as that they
are able to penetrate Stones, and into the bowels
of the Earth, we have already proved 5 and lliall
hcreconfirme it, by the teftimony of BoHaventure :
Vicunt Philofophiy quod corpus c ^lefie^yitediante fuo lumine
influit ufque ad profundum terrjt^ iibi mineralia corpora
generdrihaheit, Et^ quantum ad hoc verum dicunt.W'htn
Tcftimonies are grounded upon experience, they
cannot podlbly then be denied : and we know that
the Sun penetrates very far into the Earth, and
there gives life to plants, and li vine; Creatures too i
which, when we fee taken up, aftonifh us very much ;
as appearcs out ofGeorgius Agricola^ and the learned
Ucetuiy who is ftill ProfeflTor at Fddua. As for Sub-
terraneous fiQies, we find them but too often en-
i . vcned by the Stars, to our great difadvantage : as

that Thiiip having Cent men down into an old Gold-
mine, to fee if the Covetoufnefs of Man had yet left
there any thing undifcovered; they perceived Ri-
vers running along thofe deep CavernF, and many
other Prodigious fights : by which we may be cer-
tainly afTured^ that the Heavens do operate through
every part of the Univerfe. Defcendijfe illos^ faies

worksindifierently upon all things j which Confi-
tieration hath niovtd many that ftandupforthe
powerof Figures, tobelieve that all forts of Stones,
(Vlecais ^^ ^^-^^^ "''^^^'^^ iiuiiffcrently, if it be gra-

vcd, and wrought according to the Rules before de-
vercd, would work the fame effefts. F'or, as Fire
heateth all things that are fet before it ^ in like man-
ner do the Stars Operate, fay they, upon all things
indifferently. But I hold the firft Opinion to be
«h,e Truer^ and more certain : not, that this later is
falfe; but, becaufe the effeft here is flower. For,
the Fire will indeed heat all things, that are placed
nearit; but if the matter be indifpofed, the heat
will not workfofpeedily : as we fee in e;reen Wood,
and in a Pibblc-ftone, which requirech a longer
time to grow hot in, then a Brick doch : and fo in
all other things. It is required then, to the end
that the Stars may opperate th-e more eafiiy, and in
lefs time, that the matter be before hand indued
with fome quality, chat is proper to the effect which
we have propofed to our felves ; and havealfo fome
Sympathy with thofeCelcftial (igns, which we in-
tend to make ufe of. Read the Holy Guide.
You may fee this Sympathy, and the wonderful
Correfpondencc that there
is,
betwixt Stones, Mi-
nerals, Herbs^ Plants, Flowers,Tails,SmeIs,Colour5,
Beafts, Fifhes, Birds, and all things elfe, and the
ftars, in Georgius Venetus his Book, Ve Harmonia Mtm-
^^, and in the learned Comment of M Mo»'^'^/^, a
Phyfitian, upon Scbola. Salermtayia
j
the reading
whereof, in all forts of booAS what ever,
is
truly
very Admirable.
The fourth Objection, which
is
brought bv the
above-named Authors, is, that if this Artofpre-
paring Images be certaine^and their vertue fo great
as
is
faid
;
the Egyptians
j
Arabians and Ferftans^ who
were the hrft invcnters of them, would then have
made themfelves Lords of the whole Earth, inUib-
dmiig all their Ene Hies
:
which thing they have
R
4
not
264. ^Iheltwpicof Wxidome. BooKi
not done 5 but coiicranwife have themfelves all been
Conquered.
To this I anfwer, that no Image, or lehfmatical
-figure c^n poflibly be Capable of operating (b great
an effeft : they may indeed pofiibly excite, in fome
fmal meafitrc, the courage ofCombatants^and nwk^
them Ids fearful ofthe Terrours of War h but thefe
qualities alone will never be fufficient, for the ob-
taining of a Viftory. If any here urge againft me
the flory of Nectonaho^ who is faid to have drowned
all his Enemies Ships, by making certain little Vef-
fcls of Wax, and then drowning them : lanfwer^
fuppofe thcU. things were fo ;
yet it could not be
from hence concluded, that thefe effects were
wrought by the vertue of the Stars j but rather by
fome evil Angels, to whom God may have given
fome fuch power. Gulielmus Panfienfu utterly denies
thefe ftorics to be true; as indeed they are raeerly
Fabulous ; neither do I believe thefe is any one of
them chat hath any truth in it. If it be returned
iipon us, that there is nothing in them, but a man
nray believe, fmce polTibly they might be true : I
anfvver, that many things might have been, which
heveryet have been : as, forinflance, there might
have been more iSans, and more Worlds then
one.
The fifth Objeftlon is,that it is necefiary that Na-
tural Agents fnould.,. fome way or other, touch the
thing they are to Operate upon: but a Figure,
vvhich cureththe itone, Chollick, or anyother dif-
^afe^touchcch not at all the Part ijfFefted, theVertue
of it therefore cannot be'Nattnal.
The anfwer to this Ob'ec^ion is fo eafie, that,
without troubling our felves to* reckon up, with
"S^oxisi^ the icYcral Wi^rss of loucking^ we Deed no
*
more
B o o K i. < Ae Temple of Wifdome. 26%
more but give an iiiftance in a Hot BricJ^. For as a
Bricke receives heat from the Fire5Wichout touching
either Cole, or r lame ; in like manner doth an l-
mage receive the influence of the Stars, without
touching an Part of the Heavens.
^
In a word, all
the touching which is here found, is only a Virtual
touching 3 as we fee in the Sun, which, doth never-
thelefs warm it by its Vertue. And as a Bricke,hea-
tedeitherby theSun, orbyFire, doth afterwards
operate upon any other body, cummunicatingits
Vertue to it, if it be applied unto it : in the fame
manner doth a Figure or Image operate upon ano-
ther body, communicating the influences, which it
hath received from the Stars unto it, if it be in like
manner applyed, either by a Corporeal, or by a
\wrtual touching only. 1 fhall not here produce
the Miraculous operation of the IVeapon falve^vfhich
cures a wound, at a hundred Leagues diftance» ifit
be but apphed to the Weapon that made it j and
that you drefs it, as you would do the Wounded
Perfon ; as it is proved by Sr. Kenelme Vighy. If I
ihould have madeufe of this Example, I (hould ne-
ver have been quiet from having it thrown in my
Teeth, that the Operation o( this Magnetical Vh-
g«f«r isSupcrftitious and Diabolical. This is the
whole burden of the Ignorant Rabble, who impute,
whatever they find to carry wonder with it, to the
operation ofevil fpirits : and yet I have been afliirei
by Dr.Turner a Phyfitian, that this very operation
was Natural 5 and that himfelf had made ufe of it,
with good fuccefs, and on a very ^ood man. Now
ifour Nativity Merchants deny, that the operation
of a leUfmatical Image, which is buried under
ground, can be Natural j becaufe that it is kept in
bytheEarth, which coversit : hemayas well con-
-
'
elude.
266 The Temple ^/ Wifdome. Book I.
elude, that the operation ofa Needle touched with
a Load-ftone is alro Diabolical •> feeing that although
it be a hundred fathoms deep within the Earth, yet
will it al wayes turn it felf towards the Pole, This
Comparifon is fc much the more preffing, becaufe
that the moft of the learned believe, that this Vcr-
lue of the Load-ftone is communicated unto ic, by
that part of the Heavens, which the Needle points
to. So true it
is,
that there
is
nothing more po-
werful, then the influences of the ftars, when they
have once made an imprcflion upon things here be-
low.
The fixth Objeftion ftrikcs at the power,which we
have attributed to refemblance: for, there
is
not
any where ffay our Scar Men)
a
nearer Tye and
Correfpondence, then in the Love of
a
Mother and
her Child
;
and yet
if
a
Mother drown her felfe,the
Child will notprefently do fo too; and fo he con-
cludes
:
^anto minus igitur in tarn diverfisy utfunt
Imago & Imaginatum^ nulla ligaturaj inter eaerity qu£
cogaty ut quod fxtituf ImagOy ^atiatur & Imagina"
turn.
I
know very well, that this Author makes ufe ctf
Argument againft NeUanabo
:
but feeing that he
brings
it
alfo againft Telefmatical Images
;
[
anfwer,
that thefe Images (as we have already faid) have no
powerat all over our Wills. Now, to drown ones
ifelfe, or, not to drown ones fclf,
is
an A^ion which
depends wholly upon the Will. But
if
a
Child re-
femble the Mother, as well in the Lineaments of
the Face, asin the A6:ions of the Soul
;
there
is
no
doubt, but that this refemblance may have very
much power^ both as well on the paiijons of the
mindc, as on thofe of the Body, which proceed

from within : as ic is often obfcrved. And even in
our daycs, Wc have heard of two young Children,
which were Brothers, at VenOton^ an EpJlcopal City
inltaly^ who by reafon of their being fo perfefilj
like one another, if one of them werefick, theo-
^her was fo too : as, for example, if one began to
have a Pain in the Head, the other would prefently
. feel it : If one of them were a {leep,or fad , the other
could tiot hold up his head, or be merry : and fo of
the reft, as I have been aifured by Collonel Kove/
a very honeft man, and a Gentleman of the fame
City.
The fevcnth Objc6i:ion, brought by the Athiefts^
is, that ifat any time thefe lelefmatical ftones have
been known to cure the bitings of ^Serpents, and the
flinging of iJcorpions; this cifeft proceeded not at
all from the ftars, but from fomc feci-et Properties
in the ftone, whereon the Figure of a .Scorpion, or
Serpent, was graved.
ThisObjeftionis anfwered in two words. I fay
then, that we have already proved, that the ftars
have power to communicate this vertue to the ftone;
and alfo, that it is not at all Natural to
it,
and pro-
ceeding from its own proper vertue
:
becaufe that,
before
it
was figured and prepared under certain
Conftellations,
it
had no fuch Vertue at all. And
indeed, to what end iliould
a
man take fo much
pains in graving and preparing
it
under diverfe Af-
pcftsof the ftars,
if
it
had as much Vertue before?
To what purpofe alfo ftiould the Inhabitants of the
Country oiHamftz. in Tirrkje^ trouble themfelves
to take the Impreflion of
a
.Scorpion tbat
is
figured
upon
a
ftone in
a
certain Tower, in
a
piece of Pot-
ters Clay,
if
fo be the Clay
it
felfhad the fame Ver-
tue before
>
We fay therefore, that
it
had not any
Vertue
368 TAe Temple
t?/
Wifdome. Book
I
Vcrtue before, proper for fuch an opinion; and
that this Vertiie was communicated unco
it,
by
the
ftone in the Tower; and to the ftonc,
by
the
ftars.
I fhall noDhere examine the Arguments of the
Star Monger, which are to be feen under the Title
of the s6. Page, which is, ^uod ommn ifta qu£ fiunt
fer Imaginesymalignijlime fiant
:
becaufe that in this
Chapter he treats only of Speakjng ImageSy or Sta-
tues
;
fuch as was that fpeaking Image of
a
man,
which isfalfly faid to have been mdidthy Albertui
Magnus: But the Images we fpeak of, are quite ano-
ther thing
5
as
is
alfo their power. So that there
is
nothing wanting now, to the full Vindication of
them from falfhood, and all other Caluminies, by
AthielU.
The laft Obie^^ion
is
indeed the moft difficult of
all the reft
;
feeins; that the Vcrtue, which we find
Imprinted in
a
lelefman^ feemes to furpafs the po-
wer of Nature. Neverthelefs we are able to make
it
appear, that there
is
nothing Extraordinary in it,
by niftancing in the Load-ftone; which having
communicated it's Vertue to apiece of Iron, this
picceof Iron communicates
it
afterwards to ano-
ther, in drawing
it
to
it
felf, and retaining it. In
like manner may
a
7elefmatical figure communicate
it's vertue to another figure, which (hall have recei-
ved impreflion from
it
5
which (hall afterwards have
the power to work the fame effefts; only the diffe-
rence
is,
we can give
a
Reafon of this later, though
not of the former. For, the lelefman
is,
as
a
Brick^
made very hot, which
is
able to heat another Brick,
though not with fo much force, as the Fire does:
and the fame
is
tobf faid of the Print of
a
leUf^m
in Clay, which cait never befopowerful in opera-
B o o K I. The Temple ^/ Wifdome. 269
tion, as thcTelefman it fclfe ; which is heated^ of
penetrated, by the Beams of the Stars.
We conclude then, that we may Naturally^ and
without the aid offpirits, prove, by thefecrets of
Nature, not only the power of the Images, but of
many other operations alfo, which arc more won-
derful. As, for example, to fend Newcs to our
friends, inlefsthenan hours fpace, above an hun-
dred Leagues off: 2iSlrhheinm Abbas^ zndBanhoU^
my Cordelier^ and after him Kobert Fludy have under-
taken to do. To do fuch Miraculous things, by the
help of Looking-glafles, as we would think to be ut-
terly impolfible ; fuch as were thofe ftrange opera-
tions, which Kohert Bacon undertook to do in the
number Nine ; by which he promifed the Pope,
that ifhe would furnifh him with fuch a Summe of
Money^as the charge of making them would require
he (hould be able to annoy the lurk^s more by thefe
GlafTer, then by an Army of a hundred thoufand
Men. Briefly, if Arijktle had not informed us,that
the Image in the Aire which infeparably followed a
certain man, fo that he could never be rid of it,
was
Natural
:
would
it
not prefently have been conclu-
ded, that
it
wasfome famili^fpirit,orfome Vernon,
that took upon
it
the Figure of this Man? And yet
neverthelefs, this was only the effed of the Man's
ownweaknefs offight
;
which being unable to pe-
netrate the Medium of the Aire, it's beameswerc
reverberated, in like manner as in
a
Looking-glafs
;
fo that, when ever his Eyes were open, he ftiil faw
his own Image in the Aire. Which makes me to be
of their opinion, who indcavour to vindicate the
Ancients, from the Imputation of Magick, and to
think that the Works which they did, and which
arc commonly accounted Diabolical, proceeded
meerly
^'O T^Ae Temple ^/Wifdome. Book I.
meerly from fome Natural principle : and I am fc-
rioufly ofthis inind^that there can be nothing more
Rediculous, then to have rccourfcto Spirits. For,
bcfides that Campanellay KioUmSy SymphorianuSy Cant'
fegiusy and many others affure us, that, whatfoever
they may have done, yet they have never obferved
any thing that was fupernatural, at leaft in thofe
works, which are faid to proceed fromfpirits: We
our felvcs may do, without their Aid, whatfoever
they can do 5 feeing that they have no advantage
over us, but operate only by applying aftive things
to paflivej like as we do. We conclude therefore
with the learned Lord Bacon. Non igitur oportetnoi
uti Magicis tllufionihusy cum potefias Fhiiofophu doc fat
vperari quodfufficit.

Eholdhow the Stars, Angels, and Genii com-
municate their vertues in Dreams. And this
hath been defer ibed unto you by this Tabic
here before, by adifcourfe, the fignification of the
judge, and of the Wicneffcs even and uneven, to the
end you raay the eafilicr give a certain judgment of the
Figures as they flial! fall, having fometimcs like figni-
fication and imp( rrancc for iandry demands,andfomc-
time unlike, IS to kno^v if that a pcrfon (hall be of long
life or (hort, if) e (hall have the goods and rucccfiion
of his father, >f it be good to buy Lands and Lord(hips,
ifit be good to take a wife, and whether (he ftall be
good or bad, and whether a woman with child (hall
have a (on or a daughter, or if a ffck perfon (hall amend
of that difeafc, or that he which is in prifon shall quick-
ly come forth , or if it be good to take a Voyage in
hand, whether a thing loft shall be found again. And
fo ofall other queftionsand demands which may bena
med, according to the example here before (et out )
whereby you may by your own felf without any fur-
ther declaration know the hqures which be good for
one demand, and thofe which hold no more on the one
fids then on the other. Moreover, 1 have here placed
the ngure Popuh^ for a Judge, contrary to the opinion
of all the Dodors in this Science, the which (ay ali
witjione accord, that when she is found in this place,
that then the figure formed is not to be made, or que
ftion propounded, is not to be judged by him, but that
qucftion mufl- be judged by the four angles and other
rules which we will hereafter shew, by the which they
may

NoW yoa mud note that the Angels and Genii come
down with their infiuential power by the beams of the
Planets to the earth^as you find by the figures ofAftro^
inancie and Geomancie> to the bodies of men in theic
Dreams. Many of the ancient learned Hebrews ^
Greeks, and Lacines , have handled the .fubjed of
Dreama, and in thefe lad ages divers hare written of
them, but with fo little affurance and probability, tbac
amongd a thoufand fignifications , there are hardly
two true , having no more experience for what they
advance then Conjedures and Imaginations^ whereof
they have made large Volumes, which have rendred
them that dudied them more anxious and perplexed
then they were before for their dreams. But they are
deceived though learned^ not knowing that a thou-
fandi nay ten thoufand dreams which pofltfs the fpiric
of man every night are nothing but a reminifcerice of
their former adions ; the which thing is common td
him with the beafts, and that the occupation whicb
the pcrfon thought moft concerned his life and lively-
hood, is that which reprefents ic fclf every night* Wit-

All 4i(ireeRgafnt Vxprcfiions oftfie Poets give us
plainly tb fee that whtch Antiquity thought divine in
dreasv^,' was indeed nothing but folly , and that in this
ca(e thet^ is no difference between a man and a beaft t
feeing alfo Snlbmon the wifeft that ever was of men,
hath faidv That the end of the Ions of men and the
end of beafts is the fatiie thing as to t'b'em ; as tht bne
dies, fo dcth the other, and they have all the fame fpi-
rit, and a man narnfatiyis nomore then a beaf^, fof all
is vanity ; all goes to the fame place, all is duft, and
all (hall return into dufl- •
who is it thiit knows that
thefpiritof thet tbildrcn of men afcends upon high,
andtbefp'fritof the be^ft defcends under the earth ?
for who (fan bring it back to fee what was become of I
it ? Wherefore { have found nothing better then that
a man ili'otild re;oyce in the works of of his hands. If
therefore this be doubtful, who will attribute divini-
ty to fo many fottirhvifions dreamed by grofs people, d
feeing ill that is under heaven iS nothing but folly ,
"
and humane wifdome, both which are but one thing ?

that a dream is natural to a roan, and by the means of
dreams the more fubtle have perfwaded thofc that
were icfs, to many things; and fit^ding <ome things fall
out according to their dcfire, have given their Dreams
the nam« of Prophecies, to the end they might be the
better received, laying, that things to come were con-
tained in thefe riddles ? lo honeft and fimpl^arcwc,
that foralittje peace", we without any troubles take
dreams for things corporally fecn ; nay, tha? which
hath but the appearance of an hiftoricai truth , for a
thing decreed certain and true ; and are (I know not
what force it is to the SoveraignJ much mot^mifera-

that

months before their effcAs arc fecn. But bccaufe I have
ftudicd dreams more then the ordinary Sciences, Aave
added to this my Temple this Chapter of Oncirocracie,
that is to fay, the judgement of dreams, from thcfe
two greek words, ov^c^-.- ^
i.e. fomm^tm & ^ xe'i'^,
\udic^^ i.e. to judgc ofdrcams. But because 1 have given
it place here, I have made follow this fecond nomina-
tion ofthe Aparition of dreams, which is fully re-
prefentcd without difguife, thatevery one whatever
fee be may rcceive-the comfort ofhis dreams, being cer-
tain forerunners of the affairs of the day following,
'lis not only the fimple man that is concerned herein,
but the Monarch, King, Princejand any one whatever
ftall hence receive latisfadion, and may prevent much
evil and misfortunes that might dayly happen to him,
and alfo anticipate much good. But all muft be known
Ihroagh the fccrets o^ the Hebrew MafTorets which
reprc(enj them to u% and according to them the t8.
nights aiid days of the moon, not with any conformity
to what they are in our Geomancy, but according
to the Mcditarivesof the faid Maflbrets which arc re-
ferred to the nighrs of the Moon, and to each of the
dreams, and to thofe other three fo not to omit the 72.
^ome there are, theformuJariryofwhofe pofition is as
is to be fecn hereafter, and is to be cbferved by the
curious; for thcfe nights and days here rcprefentcd are
not to be negledcd, but known : for before that I de-
clared and (hewed them in this place, they were known
only of Cod. Befidcs this, there is nothing true in mat-
ter ofdreams: for all that Artemidorus, Cardan M-
fh't^s, d^e- have written thereof are nothing but mif-
ttkes and brutalities not differing from the dreams of
ibcmo{l5avage creatures, wherein as they ha^e de»-

Behold then how our days ate according to thee Aic^

The fpiricual is either infinite, as God 5
or finite, as

Bat the [leader is to obferve that the referring of
God toceleftial tilings is not here meant to the leaft
prejudice of godliiiefs ; as ir he were luppofedto be
included in fome certai'i part of the heaven, but after
a fimiiiar minner of fpea?iing ; for (ince it may not
be expeded that th$(e precepts (whatever they arej
canpofllbly be included m certain and infallible me-
thodical rules, bfcau(e of thecontingence and varietie
of the matter, the Courteous Reader is entreated to
bring with him an officious inclination and zeal to
the advancement of thcfeftudies.
To dream then, that one prays and calls on God, is
good; but it is ill, not only to fee him, but even to

The aieendent is the fignification of life and its con-
dition in every one , whereto alfo certain dreams are
aiilgned*
Of Soc ttes it is thus written , That Socrates the
night preceding the day he faw Plato^ did forefee that
a Swan being frefentcd to him, refled in his lap , and
thence flying pitchc upon that gate of Athens^ which
was called Academica ^ where it fo ftretched out its
neck that it reached and pierced the heaven: the next
day while Socrates related his dream to his Scholers ,
PUtQ\ father prefents his fon to Socrates to be inHru-
fted ; whereupon Socrates cries out^ behold this is the
6vvanthatfliall foaruptothcccleftiai fecrets, aiddif-
cover hidden things.
•
3a this dream the »Swan is the image of Phiiofophy
by 3 proportioned analogic: for it is white, clean, li-
ving m the depth 0^ waters, long lived, near the cxpi-

ration oflife fwceciy ftnging : (o a i bilofopher living
in integricie, and bonelly, is without fpot, white, and
clean, inquiring into the tiuthot things, fearchinginto
the various depths offciencesand opinions, to dtfcern
between truth and falfhood, and according to the for-
mer, chufcs and direds his iife, providing what is
neceflary, negleding what is fuperi^uous ; the long-
lived experience of things , brings hira to a habit of
vertue and learning , and in the approaches of his
death, bereaves to polterity fcntencesand adions fpe-
cuiativc and pradick, as the Swan-like farewel. And
this is the reafon why a Swan forefignifies a Phiiofo-
pher and long life.
There is (uch another ftory of the cluftcr of Bees
pitching en the lips of ^/4/o(being a little one fleeping
in the cradle) gathering of honey, aod awhile after
difperilng thcmfelves up into the air. This dream is
equally good as the other : for as the Bees gather to-
gether the matter of fweetncfs for nouriOiment , the
matter of fweet fmelling , for the recreation of the
fenfe : fo Philofophers difpofe all the time of their
Jives, that they may in their age recreate cbcmielvcs
with a true knowledge Q#tbings, and as with fragrant
incenfc inftrud others in moft fweet precepts , which
they do two manner of ways, either by way o^ precept,
or by cxprefs examples of vertue, out ihining others,
there being in Beesaperfed Ideaofpaedagcgical fun-

the pradical reprefentations of vertues ; and the fweet-

We have hitherto treated of the manner of divin-
ing according tothefubjed matter; now folloA^sthc
manner of prefaging out ofdreams. But fince dreaoas
arc either divine, or humane, we arc to conlider
what truth, and out of what dreams this truth
is
to be had, and how far divination
by
dreams may
belawJulornct.
Divine dreams as they arc without controverfie
the moft certain,
fo
do they require
a
certain faith
:
But
here we muft be, very cautious, and confider what
dreams arc properly divine, and what are not fo
;
for fometimcs Satan changes himfclf into an Angel
of Lights
Divine -^dreams are tryed
by
examining them by
the Pvule of the known Word: for
if
they agree with
what hath been delivered before,
if
they bear no-
thing new and difcrcpant from thofe things which
are the immutable Law of God and theGoipel, they
are of God; but
if
they be
a
falfe glofs and fliew of
Religion and Piety, require fomewhat contrary to the
declared word of God, lettbembe condemned they
arc not of God.

And fince the Devil, as in ali his other works, hat^
endeavoured to imitate him in the bulanefs ofdreams,
by which occafion he crept into the minds of foolifli
and improvident people: wc may not henceforth ex-
ped fuch entbufiafms from heaven, and God hath
tycdus to the exprefs Letter of his dodrine> where-
in he requires us to fee him and know him, as alfo
what his plea lure
is,
and what he will have us to do,
and what not. Let us not therefore faften on, but ab-
hor the doatings of fanatick perfons, though they
pretend never lo much to derive them from heaven,'
Next to divine dreams are the Angelical, which
if
they agree with the Divine, and be fuch as
I
have
defcribed them, they may be believed. But the Dia-
bolical dreams are to be detefted,
by
which the
Heathens of old, and of late the Manichaeans, Pe-
lagians, ^onks, and fanatick perfons, being deceived
and carried away, were the authors and defenders
of what horrible things followed thereupon. For
it
is
a
point of the greateft impiety and Atheifm for
to have any thing to do with the dcltroycr and ene-
my of God and man, or to give any credit to his
lyes. And
it
being granted that fometimcs the Devils
may know cafual events, (which opinion the C^nimbr.
Philofophers charge <tAuguj}:ine^ DawafceKh's^ and
Tho, (iy4qutyias with) yet the fignification of thmgs
to come fwhich the Devil nevrr inlpires into men
dreaming)
it
cannot be called
;
becaufe
if
he be the
fworn enemy of truth, and the architefl: and artifi-
cer of all lies, there cannot any thing proceed from
him that
is
folid and true; but whatever he doth, we
muft look on
it
no otherwife then
a
painted fallhood,
to deceive thofe who (hall credit it.
Humane dreams which have no other but natural

caules
214 The lemyleofWtjdonie. booka-
caufes, and happen to men ordinarily as they fleep ,
are either phyfical, or common. The phyfical dreams
arethofe which by the agitation of the humours, and
the difpofition of the temperament, do by certain
figns, nay Sometimes even material and efficient caufes,
difcover unto the Phyfitian the more certain confti-
tution of the patient. Thefc may be obferved with-
out any riot or fafpicion of impiety or atheifra, to
the end that more fortunate medicines may be provi-
ded for the ficlc. See the Holy gmde.
So a certain VVrcftler dreamed that he was plunged
in a Ciftern of blood, and that he ftiould fcarce deli-
ver hirafelf thence : Accordingly to this dream, the
Phyficians knowing it proceeded from an exuberance
of blood, having taken away what abounded, diver-
ted the danger he was in. (jalen mentions another,
who dream-ngthat one of his legs became dead as
a ftone, a while after became paralytick in that leg.
The common dreams are thofc that proceed from
compound caufes ; and they are true, orfalfeor c-
quivocal : All which though they might happily be
the images of certain events; yet to reduce from them
any pofitivc and ablolute interpretation or con/cdurc
is forbidden in holy Writ. VVherefore we may not
give credit toafiraple prxvificn any further then it
proceeds from natural caufes.
Nor isitfufficient, in caff theevent fignified, an-
fwers this dream, or that if there be not the fame
fuccefs In a hundred or thoufand others, to charge the
Art with vanity, or the Jntrcpretcrs thereof with
ignorance, fmcc there are many things, which though
they are rightly interpreted, yet many times happen
not accordingly. Hence it was fo many Kings and
Princes have mifcrably pcriflied by this kind of dreams,
as
Book 2 . The Temple ofWifdome, 215
as Pomfey^ who about the latter end ofthe war be-
tween him and Cdtfar^ dreamed that be fate in the
Theatre, and was applauded by the people, which
applaule £bould give him the viftory : but the event
of that applaufe denoted not the vidory, but the iiir-
ring up againft hira oi Lament hIhs^ Domitim^ Lihienni^
and others. Stt out Idea of the La'^s.^c.
So D.4rius before the laft battle with Alexander^
dreamed he ^aw a burning army marching through
^/^, came even to B^bylofj.vjhtx^ he faw AUxAnder^
clad in a Perfiin robe, entring the Temple andprefent-
ly viniOiing* By which dream Danru was perfwBded
that by the flames deftruftion was meant to the Ma-
cedonian Army; and that Alexander being clad in
Perfian habit, fignified he (hould be brought under
the power of them; But the event made it appear;
that by the flames was portended the fwifc and vido-
rious progrefs of /4/f^4»^i?r, and that of fire devour-
ing all things; by the habit, the Perfian Empire was
forefignified to Alexander.
So Camhyfes drczming that his Crown touched the
heaven , and that he fate in his brother Smirdnh
Royal ieat, wastohim thefignification of death.
So JhUhs Q^fcirs dreaming he was above the
Cloud, had its efFed in hisdeath.
So Xerxes upon the bringing of his army into
Greece dreamed that he was crowned with an Olive,
whofe branches fliadowed all the earth, that p refently
vanifhing with the dream.
There are many dreams which are rather the
conjedures of events, then the true fignifications, (tJch
as was that of Alexanders dream to Cyrus; for he
dreaming that he (aw Satyrs dancing asked the Con-
/cftor, whence he foretold him the viftory;the con-
I? p a jefturc
2 1 6 The Temple ofwifdome. Book 2.
jefture was taken from the word Satyr, feeing fro©
eA^vpr^ may come thefe wotdsjTi4aefi Tjyhs.
Many dreams are ambiguous, double fenfed, in cer-
tain, and doubtful, and may be referred to either pare
^oftbe contradidton ; wliofe events are fo tickiifh,
tbat the very Interpreters of dreams in fuch cafes are
fomctimcs aflcep, whereof we have thefe examples. \
One that was to run in the Olympick games, dream-
ed he was carryed in a chariot with fourhorfes; He
tells the Conjedor his dream, who anfwered. Thou |j
fliak overcome ; for thatis (hewn by theceleriry and
ftrcngth of the horfes; the party relating the fame
dream to ayinti^hon was aniwercd, Ihou muft be
o crcome; fceft thou not there are four that run
before thee ?
Another told a Con jedor that he had dreamed he
Wis turned into an Eagle ; he anfwered thou (hale
overcome, for their is nothing {mkox or more vio-
lent then that bird : But fays Anii^hon to him, doeft
thou not fee tliy fclf overcome, for that Bird pur-
luing and chacing others, is ever the laft it felf.
Ofa many dreams, there are but a it^^ have their
true events, fthongh it muft be granted they fome-
times though fcldomchave) efpecially in melancholy
perfonswho as they are naturally thoughtful, fo do
they the oftneft dream, and fuffer moft reprefentati-
ons of things. Whence as he that fhoots all day may
at laft hir the mark, fo they in their dreams may fome
time or ciher apprehend true things, acd that the of-
tner btCiUie they dream often. AriJKlth.de devw. &c,

amples in our Book called Regio Lticis,
A certain man told aConjcdor that he had dreamed
he faw an egg hanging by a ftring of his bed ; the
Confedor aniwers, that there was a treafurehid under
his bed ; he fcarches and findes a parcel of gold , cora-
paded with Silver. He fent the Interpreter what filver

Germany^ there was found in the Earth, a certain lit-
tle 5tatue of a kind of unrcBned Mecall, naturally
made; which repreiented in a round Figure, a man
having a little Child at his back : and whoever hath a-
hy where feen the pidure of St. ChnHopher , may
eafily conceive the /hape of this. It is not long fince
there was found in the Hiprc/«;^« Foreft, a (lone that
naturally reprefcnted the figure of an old man with
a long beard, and crowned with a Triple Crown, as
the Pope of Rome is. Obferve likewife that many of
thefe liones, or (jamahes , are called all by the fame
name, becaufe they have always the fame fig«re. So
that which reprefents the Eyes of a man, is called
LeHcophthalmos : that which bears the figure of a
Heart , ErtcardU : that which hath the (hape of a
Tongue reprefented on
it,
Glofopetra
:
that which
is
figured like the Genitals, Enorchta
:
and
if
it
repre-
lent as well the fecret parts of
a
man, as of
a
woman,
it
is
then called I>/>V*&c.
To the figures that are found in Plants, and Flow-
ers, you may likewife adde thole which reprefent
feme kind of Letters, or words
;
as the Hyacinth
,
on
which the Poet fayes,
is
written the Complaint ofthe

have found nothing more worthy
our admiration, then what
I
have been lately inform-

by

:
namely, that
it
is
not long
fince
,
that
in
divers parts oi Poitou
it
rained
a
certain
kind oflittle creatures, about an inch
in
bignefs
;
fome
whereof were
in
the (h ape of Biihops, with
a
Rochet
and hood, clofed up in
a
fhell, or skin, fo admirably
that one would have thought
it
to have been of bur-
nifhed gold
:
othcis were in
a
(hapc like Friers
,
with
a
Frock and CowUfome were of
a
certain horrid (hape,
and others like
I
know not what.
It
is
a
great won-
der,
if
this Relation come among the Frenchmen,
if
we have not very fpeedilyfome llrange Interpretation

you mufl take heed, that
you mix not all forts ofCharadcrsand figures indiffe-

with thefe i'alifmans. For though many of

he ctufcd the Sign oiCapricor» to be figured , for no
other reafon, but only in meoiory that he was born
under that Sign. Orelfethefe Figures areonclyfome
Myftical Emblems under which the Ancients couched
fome certain Philofophical Secret. Such was Neflers
(ilvcr goblet in Hci»<rr whereon .the Pleiades were in-
graven.
Whoever therefore knows not the myftical meaning
of this Goblet, would, without doubt, feeing the PleU-
des engraven on
it,
be apt to conceive, that
it
was made
under fome certain Conftcllation as Tallfmans are,
whereas there
is
nothing clfe

a
philofophical
fenfc thus darkly delivered by Homer,
The Poet Anacreon who confulted with Bacchus as
often as with his Mufe, makes himfelf merry with this
Goblet oiNeft-sr, and entreats Vulcan to make him one
without fuch
a
deal ofphilofophy, enough to make one

neither Charles his VVain^

a
Vine, with its
fwelling Grapes, and C^^fid, Bacchus^ and BMhilluSy

to whom government is committed, andhowdifficil ic
istoexerciie the lame rightly, what wifdome is re-
quired in Princes, left they not only make fiiip-
Wrack of their own private , but of the Fublique
eflatc; hoTv far they ought in vcrtue to excel others;
for as feeing h peculiar to the eye, hearing to the
ear; fo is the publique good to a King, which
without wifdome he can no more govern, then a
blind eye iee, or deaf ear hear: wherefore let none
alpire to the facrcd feat of a King, but fuch who
iUidy by wiidome and vertuero exceed thofe they
over-Hjle. The Holy guide ihcwsthiset large in the
third Book , and how to attain vvifdomc and vercue*
See the Idea of Tyranny,
Secondly, Let them confider, that the .Scepter is
not given unto Kings tyranncufly to abufe the au-
thority committed to fhem, but to be (Irid Obfer-
vers and Miniflers of the laws, they impofeupono-
thers, becaufe the reciprock duty, ( otherwilc then
in the dignity of commanding and that Kings are
onely comptableto GodJ is mutual.
O King, laid ^^^p^rw, fincc there is none upon
earth able to compel thee, impofe a neccffity of
keeping the laws upon thy felf. aXiigaftus Caf^r

Adulterers,
Ocia Jmferia Ua, 2 4 1
Adulterers (overcome with fiaiiiy and the violence
of his palfions) did beat a young man, who hadbeea
more familiar with his daughter ^«/iVi
then did be-
come him ; but hearing him cry out O Cdi^ar I ap-
peal to the law which thou ball made, did fo con-
dole the exadation of punifliment, not due before
the lawful trial and legall cenfure^io that he did for-
bear eating or drinking for a time. A notable ex-
ample in a great Prince to whom the breach of the
law he had made was fo dilplcafant that he fludied
rather to purilh bis own error, then the offence of
fo high quality committed igainft his Koy a! Dignity.
This prince did well know that the law is the 5ove-
raign Queen of divine and humane government and
that it is not enough to make or underhand the laws,
but to keep them. As you may read at large in our
Idea,
of the Lmv &c.
Thirdly, Let ambitious (j/^/^AT^W^r and tyrannous
Dienifus (whofe ruling appetite and cruelty one world
or humane blood cannot fatiate) confider that Kings
are the Images of God ; and as God is not only
goodnefs it felf, but diftributes his goodnefs to all
men; ^o a prince (being Gods Vicegerent) ought
to be profitable to his lubjeds, not to prefer his
private good before their publiquc ill, but to draw
his pidure by the pattern of his maker, and fo go
before his Subjefts, not only in abandoning of Vice,
but in following of Vercne ; knowing as hcexcelU
others in place, (ofar ought he to furpaffe all other
in external and internal vertues; and finally that A
fympathy betwixt his greatnefs and goodnefs is re-
quired of him : Let a prince wifely weigh that, the
helm of the Common-wealth is committed to his
charge, the well or
ill
government whereof will one

day either be re'»^ardcd with a more glorious Diadem i
or punniihed (for tbclliipivrak of his 5u.bjeds expo-
led in his default upon the works of perdition )vvith
eternal raifery. There is nothing that either is more
contagious or that fooner difperfeth ic felf through ,

Fourthly, The boyling def»re of Empire willgrow

gers to which he is fubjed, to what burthen he is tied,

Thefc and the like be true kindly fun(5lions, and the

of a Prince doth not confiil in tempora'v or momen-
tary pleafures, grounded upon the Onking fjundation
of deceitful vice, but upon the never perifhing de-
tightSy buildcd upon the unmoveibie Rock ofvertue ,
unto which no man can afcend , but by the fteps of
divine Wifdome , which Solomon (m vvhofe choice
it was to ask what he pleafed) did well know to be the
life of Government , he did not a^k Riches, nor !arge
Dominions, norvidory over his tnemies, nor vain-
glory, nor pleafures ; butwifdomc, neither worldly
Wifdome, but fuch whereby in upright nefs and un-
deritanding he might judge his people. P/;///?/? of .^.t-
cedon wis defirous that his Son AlfXinder fhould not
give his mxtiAt tocorrupcable riches, neither to the
extending of his Dorainions,but to the ftudy oiThUo-

ent in them. The benefits thereof are many, the effeds
admirable , and the reward ineftimable , Read our
HoljGtnde. lih,t, chap, 2.
Fird^ vcnuous education begetteth a habit of vertue
and hatred of vice, for there is nothing more certain ,
then that thereby a man becometh more then a man,
and participates in the Divine nature; on the other
fide, if he be left to his natural ignorance, he degene-
rates to ail wickcdnefs , and fympathies rather with
the moft Savage and rude beads, then withareafon-

Lttcftrgtis the SpArtan Lawgiver made manifeft the

the abundance of all things , t^at Learning may fecm

is
nohappincls
in
thefc things that
ma^
Oda Imferialia 247
may be taken avviy. ^cad the Harmony of the
Worlds lib, t.
Thirdly, Learning ftirrs up and excitates the rainde
and love of a Prince to the reading ofBooks , wherein
he may learn all things necdfull for him fell' or Sub/eds ;
Theie dumb Mafters will praife him it he be worthy,
or without fear, which the Prophet tells him thou art
the man , they will finally (without blulhing) adrao-
nifti him of thoic things his Courtiours either will not
or dare not, the want of learning is the caafe that
Princes rejed the counfel of their frien^sand contemn
the power of their enemies ; ignorance caufed Camhtfes
crueHj to murther the (on of Fraxa/pes his fervant ,
for his faithful counfel ; TjrAnous Dienyfttts, to check
Plato for his loving advife. Read alfo our lde<t ef Ty*
ranftJ,
Thcfe and the like phaUrifm examples oi Tyranny;
prove that the knowledge of learning is neceffary for
good Princes that thereby they become fo much better
thatthey willingly embrace vrtue, and comes to the
knowledge of themfelves. See the Idea of ly-
rannj.
Fourthly, although by defcent,nobiIity ofblood, and
indulgence of Fortune^ Princes are eminent, yet to
add a more (hining brightnefs to their external
fplcndor, learning i$ neccffjry , T/z.a ^i^u^tsTaV/
maii'A± E^JIJ^ Learning is an honour to all men iaith
Afenander^ many famous Princes both at home and a-
broad have b<en more reverenced for their Learning,
then honoured for their greatnefs. See our Idea of
Government,
Fifthly, Learning only brings with it laftfng and
prince-worthy plealures, the reft are but deceitful
momentary, Biiliff. to infnare them. They arc richly
Kr z named
248 Ocia Imferialia
nimcd (by Archttas) the moft dcftroying plagues
infliAed upon men, AriffotU was wont to admonifc
his 5cholers, not to look upon pleafures , at their
coming, but in their going; fo in the one, faiii he, they
(hew fair jn the other chey leave forrow and repentance*
On the contrary, the delights that arc begotten of
learning and vertue^tre true joyes, perroamcnt plea-
fures, the ornaments of youth, the Crown of age ;
They adorn prosperity uphold adverficy at home,
the beft Stewards abroad the beft Interpreters in
peace, and of idlenefs ; in war the Marflials of
Gamp?, in company the Minifters of difcourfe, a-
lone private and true Councellors.
Noble AjfrtcAKus ufed oft to fa;^ that he ivas never
lefs folitary then when folitary.
A prince of ^ri[?f«j being demanded what he did
profit by Philofophy anfwered, that at all tiroes
he could without offence conferre with hfmfelf, and
in every difcourfe draw in conclufion confonant to
reafon, befides laid he, the knowledge ofPhilofophy
makes me love wife learned honcftmen, deteft flat-
tering Parafites, and fools.
Sixthly, Learning adorns a Prince with curtefic, cle-
mency, and meckneffe, the firrt begettcth infeperabJc
love the fecond humane admiration, and the third di-
vine applaufe ; the love of 5ub)(^s, is the v^all of
Ktngdomes, mercy eftablifiieth the throne of a King,
and mecknefs deifies him.
Seventhly, Incno{l dcfpcratedifeafes (by learning)
a Ppnce findes matter of comfort, and prcfent help.
Th 9 was the medicine «hat Marcus Tullius did,
miniOcr to his friend; O l^Alhns faid he, if I could
prefcribe medicine for our cquall griefi, I wouldt
fuch as I can I will, Let the fludy of good letters
which
Ocia Wfcrialia. 349
which for our delight we have formerly embraced
be now the comfort of our rniferies, and laft health;
as they did advance our better fortunes, fo they
\vill mittigare our prcfent forrows , cure our wounds
and fo expell Melancholy paffions, that the forrows
of humane miferie?, (hall have no further entry^ then
to the gates of our weikeU fences^
5ince therefore humane milcries arc no leffe
incident to Princes then poor men ; a Prince ought
by learning to arm himfelf, agaiiift the violent batteries
ofadverfe fortune, if Crtf//^j had perticipate, either in
learning or ad vife which Selon in his flourifhing cftate,
he had found more comfort thereby upon his Tragical
Theatre, then in the millions of his golden trcafures^
Dio'^yftus (nothing inferiour to Cr^7«j in tyranny or
prefumption , but fuperiors) by learning in his exilq
being asked what he had learned by f/.ire, anfwered
that by Philofophy, he had learned to undergo e-
qually the cftate of a Prince, and Beggar.
Eightly, a learned Prince doth willingly incline to
wifdora and vertue, he followeth the one and (hun-
eth the other, not for fear, but for love of them-
felves. The Cubicularies of the Perfian Kings were
enjoined every morning to put their Mafter in mind
©f his Kingly office by thefe words, jirife O King
and go abottt thy fublique affairs : A learned Prince
needeth no fuch advertifement, before he goeth to
bed, he premeditates the next dayes work, in his
bed he confults upon that, and at his rifing he exe-
cutes his fetled defigns, he is neither overcome, with
forrow, fear, hope, joy, and other vulgar violent
perturbations; but willingly follows thofe wholfome
laws he doth enad for others* Anftot/e being de-
manded what he had profited by Philofophysanfwcr-
K r 3 ed
2 50 Ocia Imperialia.
cd that he had learned to do thofc things willingly
that others did for fear of the law*
Oderunt feccare honi virtut'is amore
Odernnt peccare malt formtdine p^na.
Ninthly, Giving of anfwers , ufinq perfwafions,
rcfolving ofqueftions, difcourfing of laws confer-
irg of honors, defence of things propofed or done,
are infepcrably annexed to the office of a King, un-
to all which a Prince muft be by learning ioablcd,
left he expofe himfelf to the cenfure of ignorance,
or become the fubjeft of fmothered laughter, and
future contempt. The words of Princes are ( like
the Oracles of Jpollo) no fooncr fpoken but taken
hold of by all men, therefore great care is to be
talci^n, that his words , his orations , his anfwers
and demandf, beconfonant to the dignity of a Princp,
TiUte did pronounce that State happy, where i wile
and learned King did raign, for faid he , learning
is the only and cheif happinefle, and ignorance, the
grcatefl ill; upon the firft depends all humane felicity,
and^ upon the lafl aflured mikry.Arnflippus made
choice rather to be a beggar then be unlearned, be-
caufe by the one he wanted but exteinil and tem-
porary riches, but by the other, he was dcftitutc of
humanity, knowledge and endleffe wealth, ^ee my
Holy Cfi/dfH Ettgliffjlh. I. chap* I.
Wherefore (to conclude this point) learning keeps
Stites from returning to the former Chaos of con-
fufion, it is the fame that enlightens the mind of a
Prince, and being removed, government by diforder,
turn? into tyranny, and is obfcurcd, with the dark
Clouds of ignorance. Sec my Idfaoflj/nKny,

di[ifim of a Tyrant, whofe office is to givciaws, but

Aunt Anthsny^ that he (hould m,ore wifely rule the
reigns of his government ; did tell her, that his will
was a law : 1 his licentious appetite is the poifoa
that once drunk, makes Kings abufe their authority^
degenerates in all libidinous liberty, oppreffingthe
mighty, and negieding the poor: On the contrary
9 good Prince hath (with Ulijfes) his ears ftopt from
fuch inchanting fongs, that are pleafant to his flat-
tering fycophants, but poifonable to the publique
Weal. Anttgonius did feverely check one ofhis Cour-
tiours , who did maintain that all things were jull
and lawful for a King, not fo (by Jupiter) faid he
onely to Tyrannous and barberous Kings, but to me
nothing is lawful or juft, but that which is honeO.
Princely authority is not given by God to be the
fupplement of vice , neither the pidure of Tyranny,
but to be the pattern and defence of vertue and
jul^icc, the name of a Prince hath his original, as
well by commanding his own impetuous affeftions,
as in over ruling and going before his fubjeds.

By what means a King may ohtain the favour

A Prince hath three gates to receive the favour
of his people j and (hut out the envy of all men
and the hatred of male- contented Subjeds. As you
may read in the Holy Guide.
i^irfl, Becaufe Pride is hateful to all men.

It is recorded to the infamy of %jhohoam that
he did leave the counfel of the Eiders , asking the
advice of young men, and impoHng heavy burthens

Thirdly , if a Prince (lie^r himfelf affable , cxo-
rable, not vindidivcand fevere, in the rigorous exe-
cution of Laws, for every light offence, he fhall
much oblige the favour , and obedience of his peo-
ple, as impurity begetceth contempt of Law, lo fre-

people accordiog to wifdotnc and Jullice in his own
rme, and that by GodhnciTe, and learning, his po« ,

Secondly, The mind of a generous Prince, is not
^
capable of bafc and fordid adions, but is delii^hted in
high and rare defignes ; as the flames of fire whofc
rature is to afrcnd, cannot bs dcpreffed ; fo the whole
msnd of a Prince, the more noble the more inclined
ti- Princely and hcroick aftion, ever contemning thofe
things which the bafc vulgar holds moft dear.
Thirdly, A true noble Prince, is ravifhed with a fa-
therly love of his f'.ibjeds, affefting the love and
not the fear of his people , his care is to be approved
cFthe good : fuch he prefers, fuch are his familiars,
fncli his counfellours, fuch are always about him ;
flattering fycophants he cannot indure , he is never
Tyiant-likc cruel nor given to anger, nochin,^ offends
him nore then the fpoil ofunjuft officers, or corrupt
Judges.

Fourthly^ The mind ofa good Prince fuffers not good
men balely to proftrate hemfelves or fervilely demand
jufticeof him, bat will«ngly intlineth himfelf to them,
f»iving accede and hearing. A'lllirpHS bem^ reproved

On the contrary, ( Bccaule too much famih'ariry be-
getceth contempt) a Wife Prince doth not ra(hly
admit men of lufped faith, or corrupt life, to his
•prefencc.
Fifthly, True nobility ipringsth from true vertue,
and the mind of a true good Irince, is prone and gi-
ven to v.;rcuc, honcft adions, and to the works of
liaht ; as charity, peace, meeknefs, goodncfs, and
temperance; defpifeth the works of darkncffe; is luft
driinkennefs gluitony, cruelty, adultery, and all fuch
vices to which vulgar and bafe mirds are addided.
Sixthly, The mind of an illuftrious Prince wearied
with the incedant cares of governffient, is rcfreftied
and deiiphted in pleafant and fliort, not m unlawful
and prophanetexerfife, gaming, or tedious difcourfe.

Seventhly, Mediocrity betwixt extreams is a Princely
vertue (for whatloever approacheth neareft to the
mean is beft) the mind ofa generous Prince is whoiiy
inclined to fliun vices, to follow vertue; he is ?neek
and merciful, but fo as by his lenity he nouiifli noc
the vices ,of his people; Icvere, not inclined to tyranny,
be lo reprefieth injuries, that he terrifies others from
oflFering them, Chthn of Lacedemon advifeth Princes
lo to moderate their aflions, that they be neither fear-
ful to their inferiors, nor contemned of their equalls,
the one favours of Tyranny, theother of Puiilaninjity.
A good Prince is neither covetous nur prodigal, buc
truly liberal.

of a Prince that are prod igaliyprcfu fed upon dice,card8,
unlawful gaming, whoring, of conferred upon Para-
lues flTtterers, and unworthy perfon?, is the fuel of
vice, and not the reward of vertue.
Item^ The mind of a generous Prince is not trou-
bled with the unfectled refolutions of puiilianimity, cr
raflinefs, but itisat all times armed with t.ue forti-
tude, ready at all occafions ^if the good of his ^ub-
)eds fo require, to expof: his life) to moft eminent

being baniOicd into Afia fitting in the Theatre, re-
ceiving letters that he was reftorcd to his kingdome,
did neither alter his gravity,or reveal fuch glad news to
thole friends that did i\t neareift unto him; by which
Kingly gefturc he did declare to be a true Prince, nei-
ther deprefled with adverfe fortunes, nor exalted with
new preferment to h.s former dignity.

A good Prince truly lovcth fuch who are of upright
heart, conftant and true according to Solomon PUce^

The true friendibip of Damon and Pythias was fo
pleafant to Dionyfiuf ("although a tyrant) that he not
onely pardoned the offence of the one, but in admira-
tion of their faith, intreated to be admitted into their
fricodfliip.
The generous mind oft Prince is born to peace, lo-
vcth concord, and detetts tyrannous war?, and ifne-
ccffity urge him he taketh Arois unwillingly rather
for the defence of bimfelf and his fubje^s then for en-
larging of his Kingdomes by tyranny and ftrong hand:
nodefeds of tyranny raigns intheraind of a true no-
ble Prince, neither doth he ever repudiate his true
friends, but is defirous to be beloved of all men,, and
fearful to no good man.
A poor man exhibitin<:; his petition fearfully to Ati-
giiftm Cdtfar, was by him thus checked , or rather

Laftly the heroical mind ofa Prince is fo great, that
it can hardly be removed to anger or violent pafHons;
this Princely patience was fo eminent in Augnftus Qa-
far, that he could abide the biting jefls of his meaneft
iubjefts.

which is the helm of Government, the hap-

co Kings and Princes, and hath (by all good Kings ^

whereof Is a moft Divine- like and Princely work.
In the exercife of this Kingly Office, a King mud

Liberality not only unites fub'jedstothe love of a
Prince in faiihfulnefs and obedience; but ofc-times
fliekers many other enormities and dcfeds m Prin-
ces.
In liberality a Prince ought to examine his eflate
and dignity, Icflhe either gives more then he may,
orUffcthenhe lliould ; for feeing vertue confifleth
in mediocricv, there is fault in the exercife of either

cmptie the Spring- The caufcs of liberality may b€
comprehended under charity, or merit ; a Prince oughC
to extend his liberality chiefly tow ards the good and
vtrtuous, and if fomecimes to the vicious and wicked,
it is in hope of chcir amendment, or incommifcracion
of their wants, and not to add matter to their infolcnt
life. The confideration cf time confiftcth in the fit o-
portunity thereof , not keeping Suitors in fufpence,

The place ofgiving is rather to be private then pub-
like, for true liberality cannot abide pharifiical (hews
and oftentation : the pattern of liberality (who never
did refiife any that in true hith did ask) did command
not to fufFjr the left hand to know what the right hand
did, iniiouating thereby that goodnels, munificence,
and charity, doth nor participate with hypotriiie, hope
of gain, and glo ious lliews.
Laftly, The beneficence of a King or Prince mufl
beof his own goods, not unjuflly taken from one and
conferred upon another , whereby the hate of the
wronged fhall exceed the love of thofe upon whom
benefits are conferred. In the end, Demofths-nes fully

This due preparation againft the day of death, and
vidorious overcoming of death (being the Crown of
humane adions, ofa good life here, and a true badge
of afTured happinefs hereafcer ) ought to be common
to all men, and peculiar to a Prince, tor two thief rea-

Death
is
not to be feared when

is
no noveIty:that he
("with all men

are
by
death diffolvcd: What numbers of Monarchs
are before him, and chat Hiall follow him.* that death
is

heaven, where uncorrupted treafure and true glory
attends him: the earneft defire whereof builded upon
a
good lifej and upright confcience, moved good Sa*

and ask whofe Oxe, or whofc Affe he had unjuftly

THe
Querent Is that Perfon (be it man or woman)
that propounds the doubt or queftion to the
Artift : And thefirft Houfe, and any Figure in it,
fignifies the Querent : the Ruler and Idea Signifies his
Stature, Complexion, Condition and Qoality, mixed
all together.
The Quefited is the perfon (or thing) enquired
after ; and the feventh Houfe generally, and the
Fij^ure in k^ the Idea, and Ruler of
it,

cators

catoi s thereof. The Afcendent, Figure, Idea and Rai-
ier, do iignific in that place the Corporature of the
Body.
And let every Artift well underftand the (ignifica-
tions of the Rulers and Idea's, for they gain fig-
nitication to the Houfes and Figures, as you findein the
fecond Book.
And being well vcrfed in thcfe, obferve the Na-
ture of yonr Qiieftion propounded , and give the firfl:
Houfe, and I he Figure, Ruler and Idea therein, to
the Querent, then confider unto what Houfe the
perfon or thing enquired after belongs, and give his
Ruler, Idea and Figure to lignitie the thing encjuired
after.
As for Example : Suppofe a Perfon fhould enquire
concerning Riches ; the firft Houfe fignifies his Per-
fon 5 and from the fecond Houfe , and the pofition
of the Figure, you (hall know the condition of his e-
ftate.
If one enquire concerning Brethren , &c. Then
you muft take the third Houfe and his Figure, Ru-
ler and Idea , becaufe they have fignification there-
of.
But if a queftion be rr.ade of or concerning a Fa-
ther, or Land, or Houfes, 6'c. the fourth Houfe hath
fignification thereof : If of Children, &c, the fifth:
If of Servants or fr:all Cattel, &c, the fixth : U of
a Husband , a Wife, Sweet-heart , or of Partfierfliip,
Theft, Law, or Controverfies , the feventh: If cJi a
Portion of the Wife , or Eftate of a Husband , op
Death, &c, the eighth : If of the Husband, orWfte,
Kindred, or ofa Church-man, or Lawyer, or DrSams;
the ninth : If of a King, Prince, Duke, Piotef^or^
Earl, Lord, or Magiftrate, or of the Mother , the tttith i
Ifof Friends, or any thing one Ihall hope for^ &c. cle-

pounding of any qiieftion , tray the ingenious Artift
giveafoberanda certain Refolve: And this (hall ht
fufficient to difcover the fignilicators, both ofthe Qne-
rentj and the Perfon or thing Qnefited.
CHAP. in.
When a figure is Radical^ and
fit
ia he Judg-
ed.
THe Artift before he adventiireth to judge aQieftj-
on, ought firft to confider, whether
it
be pro-
per and
fit
to be judged
;
For many times, Perfons pro-
pound impertinent Queftions, with an intent to dif-
grace and delude Art
,
and
in
fo doing, they create no«»
thing but (hame to themfeives.
Then the Artift (hall fometimes meet with per-
fons that know not how to propound their delires
aright.
It
is
an Argument when fuch queries arc
made, that (althougli they may be a^^ked with
a
good intent, yet) they are not ripe for Judgement
;
and the Artift ought to defer his counfel until another
time.
Now for the difcovery of the knavery ofthe one, and
the unfitnefs or unpreparednefe of the other
:
obfcrve
thcfe Rules following.
If the Ruler and Idea, which governs the Figure
in
the firft Houfe, e^c. (hall dcfcribe the Perfon of the
Querent e?caft*y
;
you may conclude the Figure
Radical, and the qucftion propounded fit to be judged
:
}NhttiKHhew^ Cauda Vrasenis^ orJmjfJO', youmuft
have
Book 1 ii. ihe 'I emple o] ^ifdem.
have a care what you fay , for the Querent hath been
tampering with others about the bufinefs propounded,
or elfe the queflion is forged j and therefore not fit to
be anfwcred .
'
If Fopu'M or any Figure go out of the firft to a D or
<? of the Figure of the feventh, the Qjerent is a Knave,^
and fo let him go.
When Tri/litia or Career be in the Afcendent, or firft
Houfe,in
ill
company and Afpe^^
5
either the matter pro-
pounded
is
falfe
,
or paft all hope.
if
the Figures be equal, and the Witnefles and Judge
promife as much to the one as the other, you muft
defer your judgement until another time.

l^Hatfoever
is
propounded, carrieth
in
the face
•
of
it
,
both
a
Negative and an Affirmative; that
IS to fayjit may be either concluded, or not
:
For all
things under the Sun are contingent; and
it
is
as
honourable for an Artift to give
a
Judgement in the
Negative
,
if
the Figure deny the wifhed dciire, as
in
the Affirmative, when the Figure promifeth it, al-
though not fo pleafant as the proponent. But the
poffibiiity or impolfibiiity of bringing to pafs the Mat-
ter propounded, you may know
by
thefc Ri^Jes fol-
lowing.
Buiinefles are brought to pafs divers ways, viz* when
the firft Figure in the firft Houfe fignifying the perfon
propounding, and the perfon or thing propounded, arc
in
good places of the Figure
,
or when the firft Figure
goes into Houfe ofthe thing demanded or quelited, and
Bbb
5
again
The Temple of mfdow. Book III,
again beholds the firft Figure or Houfe by a :^ or Z^,
from places they delight in : The thing fought after will
be brought to pafs.
If the Significator ofthe thing promifed , be well dig-
nified, and doth behold the lirft Houfe; fhe Mat-
ter will be brought to perie£^ion before it be ex-
pefted.
If the firft Figure 5
admit it vfereAihm^ did in a-
mounting grow from the firft Houfe to the fecond ; that
is to fay, that he be in the fecond, or be like unto the
iirft, where Albm is : It fignifies by vertue and power of
the Ruler and Idea that is attributed to it, much gain
by Arts and Sciences, fortunates the Querent or Native
in Merchandize, in all kinds of writings, and by his in-
genuity he (hall attain great honour from men of au-
thority.
When the Significators ofthe Querent and Qjielited,
&c, are now beholding, it is an
ill
iign of ever bringing
the thing enquired after toperfeftion.
When the Significators (hall behold each other

enquire ofaMiftris, or fwcet-hcart, or wife, &c, and
in the Members thofe Figures fignifie , (he (hall have
Markes, Moles, or Scars.
The Hebrew, Caldean, Greek, Arabian, Latine and
Egyptian Doftors of this Art , teach you, as we did in
the firft Book, to frame the Witnefles and the judge.
The firft Witnefs they put for the Querent : And if it
were good, and agreed with thefc on the right fide 5 and
ifthe Judge were even and good, and agreed with the
(ccond , third , fourth , ninth, tenth ; they faid the
fignification of the demand (liould coT.e to a good
end : But the left Witne(s was contrary *, and if the
Judge confented to it , and the Figure on that fide ;
the queftion or thing fought after (hould come to an
ill
end.
Butbecaufe we could never finde truth
in
the Wit-
nefles, we never regarded their Judge, becaufc we finde
no reafon for what they faid: and fo let them pafs.
We will give judgement upon the twelve Houfes
,
as
we have experienced to be true.

When the Significators, &c, fhall be evilly Afpe^lcd

TTHc good and evil that attends each pcrfon,

from the fortunate or infortunate projeftion of the
Figure. 'Read the Harmony

unto the Querent,

If

by

Figures behold
it,
yet
it
pre-
(ages good unto the Querent
in

in
as much as an accidental evil cannot rebate or withftand

which is ruled by God, whofe Effigies it is : And fo the
Idea's are overcome, and made natural to us in the
Figures, which are like the body, which is natural ; but
yet receives heat and motion from a divine principle,
as the other received their influence we fpeak of in the
firft Book.
If Career or Triftitla be in the Eaft^ Angle, the Qjie-
rent will be melancholy and penfive , and fubjed to
perplexities from aged men, &e. U Puer ov Rubeuj^
he will be cholerick , and lie liable to oppreffion by*
Knaves and Theevcs 5 and fometimes by the Villany -
and Treachery of Kindred , he may fuffer. If Cauda
T>raco7ns^ he is never free from {candals and difgraccs:
when the aflifting Figures are in good Houfes , the
good will be more permanent. Have great regard to
the places where the Figures are, and how they go
ont of one Houfe into another 5 for from thence is
known by what means the Querent (hall be fortunate or
unhappy.
You muft ob(erve, that as the Malignant Company
or Afpeft of Parts or Houfes evil , prevent the good
that is fignified : So the friendly and benevolent
Houfes and Afpeft of Figures, mitigates much of the
mifchief portended : by confidering of which, accor*

And let no man wonder, that by the numbers and
names many things are found out : For the moft high
God created all things by number^ name, weight and
meafure : from whetice the truth of this Art hath its
Original, which were not inftituted cafually, but by «
certain Rule : Hence St. John in the KivelationCt^th,
C cc 2 L«f
2 O The Temple of mfdome. Book 111 .
t,tt him vrhich hath undtrftanding compute the number of
the name nf the Beafl^vphich is the numher ofa Man, Thefe
which were infpircd into every one at his Birth, by the
very Heavens, with the con jimftion of the Stars, and
brought by a power into the body, as ye may read at
large in The Harmony of the World. God himfeli^
though he be onely one in Effence^yet hath divers names
which expound not his divers Effences or Deities, but,
certain properties flowing from him ; by which Names
he doth pour down, as it were by certain Conduits on
us, and all his Creatures many benefits and divers gifts
by Idea's. Ten of thefe Names we fpake of in the firft
Book, which give vertue to fcven and twelve, which are
feated in (eventy two Places, twelve Vefiments in-
clofc them in their places in every Species ; and in thefe
we finde (eventy two Namesjboth of Angels and ofGod:
And if you proceed further out of all places of Scri-
pture according to the fourth Rule, you will finde fo
many names ofIdea's Divine and Natural, as the number
ofthofc Names is.
From thefe therefore, befides thofe which we have
reckoned up before, is the Name of the divine Eflence,
Eheia^T{"^\^^ which is tranflated «'v ; from hence they
call God To oV,cthers'o«v 5 that is,the being. Ha^ j^^H,
is another Name, fignifying the Abyfs of the God-head :
Which the Greeks tranflate T*^iy, the fame. Efch^ TC;^^^
is another Name, foundeth Fier ; and the Name of God
2V4, t^ J, mitigates perturbations and troubles ; there is
alfothe Name Jah^ n^ and the Name Elto??^ I^^y 5and
the Name Macom^ Op''Q ; the Na me Cafhu^ '^QD 5 the
Name Jimon^ 30"* ; the Name Emeth^ 7)D^^ which is
interpreted Truth, and E/ the Seal ofGod: and there
are two other Names Zur^ •^ty, and Aben, pel ; both
of them fignifie a folid work, and one of them exprefs
the Father with the Son, And many more Names you
may

may fiiide in Rules extrafted out of the Holy Scripture,
where many words retrafted by certain oftheir Letters
make up one Name, or one Name difperfed by each of

they take the four Angles j the firft Figure of them fig-
nifieth the firft Letter or Vowel, the tenth the fccond

Th« Earth is divided into four quarters, Eaft,Weft,

twelfth Houfe being next unto it turns Eaft and by
South, the eleventh next unto that is South-eaft, and
the Mid-heaven is South, e^c. According to the quar-

Of 4- ship at Sea ^ her fifetj or prejudice,
TTHis Queftion by the Heb rew, Caldcan, Greek, Ara*
bian, Latine and Egyptian Doftprsj is attributed to
the ninth Houfe : But the Learned men of our Nation,
as Johfi Vigbjf Efq. and Captain Blackrnany know the
judgement belongeth to the firft Houfe ; as they have
proved by experience.
The parts ofthe Ship are thus divided, and attributed
to the houfes.
The firil Houfe fignifies the Breaft ^ the fecond Houfe
under the Breaft towards the Water ; the third Houfe
the Rudder or Stern j the fourth Houfe, the Floor ofthe
Ship or Bottom-, the fifth Houfe, the Top above Wa-
ter; the fixth Houfe, the Belly of the Ship ; the fe-
venth, that part above the Breaft in the Water; the
eighth , where Mariners abide , the Cook-room and
Powder-room i the ninth, the Mariners , the hold
where the Merchants goods are ftowed ; the tenth, the
Ends ofthe Ship ; the eleventh, the Governour or Cap-
tain ; the twelfth, the Oars. . 'jbiift
After obfervation made of thisdivifion, you are td
confiderwhat Figures are fortunate, and what unfortu-
nate at the time of your Qj.eftion propounded 5 for
theperfons or parts of the Ship thereby iignitied, are
cither well or in danger, according to their fortunacy
or unhappinefs.
The Figure in the firft Houfe, zndPopuJus^ iffhebe
in the Figure, are generally fignificators of the Ship and
the burden fhc bears : If the firft Figure or Fopnlus o?

Via pafs into other Houfes, that fignifieth the perfons
that fail in her ; otherwife the
fii
ft
and ninth fignifie the
Ship and Mariners
:
And
if
in
a
queftion propounded
you finde all thefe fortiinate, you may judge the Ship
fails well,
it
is
well vidualled. If Caput Vraconij be for-
tunate, the men are
in
a
good condition
,
and they will
make
a
profperous voyage.
But
if
on the contrary, you finde them all afflifted,
you may judge the Ship
is
caft away, and all chat
is
in
her
loft. VtKnhem be
in
the firft Houfe, and Cauda Vraco^
nis
in
the eighth with Puella
;
and the Figures of the
twelfth, fixth or fourth move to evil Afped of Cauda
Vraconij or Kubeusy who is proper Lord of the eighth
:
All the/e are dangerous prefages, that the Ship
is
caft a-
way or loft.
If any ftiall enquire of the fuccefs
a
Ship (hall have
in
her voyage upon her fetting forth, you muft then bc^
hold the Angles ofthe Figure
5
and
if
you finde all them
or the major part fortunate, and the unfortunate Fi-
gures cadenr, or
in
an abjccl condition
5
you may judge
the Ship and her Lading to have
a
fair VVinde unto the
intended Haven.
But
if
the infortunes be
in
Angles or fuccedenC
Houfes, ftie will meet with Men of War, Pyrats, or
fuffer (hip wrack, or fome prejudice
in
her voyage
;
and
the misfortune will fall upon that part ofthe (hip or
perfon or thing
in
the fame (ignified
by
the Figure
and Houfe which
ill
Rulers and ill Idea's govern.
If
the
ill
fortunes threatning danger (hall be Zazel^ the Veflel
will be fplit or funk, and the men
in
danger of drowning.
But
if
the infortune Barzabel
,
and he
in
his Figure and
Idea
in
the eighth Houfe, frowning with
ill
Afpeft upon
the fignificator
,
he portends the fame mifchief that
Zazei did.
But
if
fortunate Figures fmile upon either of thea-
forefaid

o
forefaid places, and the Angles with good company,
^fpecially the Eall removes into a good Hoiifej and if
Vefultts and Via be free from misfortune, it denotes, al^
though the Ship (hoiila be caft away, yet by aflidance
of the long-Boat and Skiff, and other fortunate helpes,
the major part of the men and goods will be pre-
ferved.
But if Barzahel do afflict the Figures in Angles and
Ihe difpofitor of Fopulus^ the Sayiors or Mariners will
lower their Top-fails, Main-fail, and Fore-fail, Half-Mafl
high, often tacking about (hip, and ftandjng off to Sea
for fear of their enemies. Et fi hoc Malum babuerit a*
hud damnum infigura accident inter cos interfeciionesjper^

But if to adde to this evil , there happen any other
evil in the Figures, there will be quiirrelling , contro*
verfies, wounds and thefts among the fhips company ;
they (hall cozen and cheat one another; and thiswili
diicfly happen to be located m thofe Figures, wiiich
difpofe of the parts in the upper diviiion of the

But if Zazd do afflift after the fame manner, as be-
fore we faid o(Barzabel^ there will be many thefts com-
mitted in the (hip , and molt of the forementioned mifr
chiefs, but no blood fhcd.

If

;
the Querent will enjoy the Eftate of his Fa-

if they ftay

,
and move no fur-

If one Ruler govern the firft and fourth Figure^ and
another Ruler being his Friend, govern the (econdand
fifth Figures, and they be all of an Elementjthe Querent
will fuddcnly receive focr.e of his Fathers Eftate. An
ill

HAving
proje<^ed your Figure, and rightly confi-

to judgeT.ent after this manner, viz. If the fecond Fi-
gure be
in
an Angle, the thing milling
is
within the
Houfe of the Qiiercnt
:
but
if
the fecond Figure be
in
the firft
,
the thing miffing
is
in
that part of
the Houfe, which the Querent himfelf moft fre-
quents.
If the fecond go into the eleventh Houfe,
it
declares
the thing hid or miflaid to be
in
the Hall, Parlour, Ban-
quetting-Houfe or Diniug-Rome,
if
a
Geritleman ask the
queftion.
Ifthe Tradefttian ask
it,
it
is

Houfe.
If the fecond go into the tenth
,
the thing
is

that part of the Houfe, where the Qiierents Wife
or Maid-Servants ufe moft to be

if
in

Tojudge of the nature or qualky of the placcyybu
tnuft obferve the nature and quality of the Figure and
Idea, which if they be Aiery, the thing wanting is in
the upper part ofthe Houfe : If fiery, it is neer a Chim*
ny, or where Iron or Flint-ftones lie : IfEarthy, it is
neer feme Pavement or Floor, or fome low place: Jf
Watryjit is neer fome Sink or VVafli-Houfe, or in (bme
mooriih moift place, &c. You mmi alfo obferve the
Quarters the Idea^ and Figures govern, for that di-
refts you to the right Angle or part ofthe Houfe where

Houfes.
Amongft the powerful MeflengersofGod^fevenruIe

And God commanded them to fet his Idea upon all
things in Heaven above, and in the Earth beneath,and
iri
theWarter under the Earth; and they obeyed, and
it

Intelligences or Rulers, Idea's to every Species>_»nd to
every thing, both
in
Heaven and

Earth
3
and every
Species hath it's Idea, Natural and Divine. Now the
Natural Idea's and Figures receive the influences of the
Divine, and of the Meffengers
:
And thefe Mcffengfrs
have twelve particular Ideals which they delight in, and

and is either Mafculine or Feminine according to, the

Let any man in England now living, tell me by what

Cholerick perfons to Acute. But becaufe Sir Chri*
ftgfher Heydon in his Book of Aftrology, hath given you
the Reafons of thefe things , we refer you to them
for inftruftion. For the Nature of the difeafe in this
Art is taken from the Ruler and Idea that poflefles the
Figure in the firft hloufe and fixth Houfe : And the
length or (hortnefs of the difeafe, is known by the Fi-
gures moveable, common or dxed.

What is the caufe of the diflemper ?
THe
caufe of the diftemper is known from the pofi-
tion ofthe fignificators of ficknefs aforefaid, in ei-
ther of the four Triplicities ; for therein they (hew
the predominant humour that is peccant. •
Jarchas*
If in your Figure, they or the moft of them are mo»
ved into Houfes governed by fiery Idea's , they de-
clare the diftemper to have its Original fromCholer;
whence Fevours and all fuch difeafes proceed, C(7r-
ndlus Agrippa*s lel'ifmes.
But if the Significators be altered into Airy places,
blood is then predominant in the body , and the difeafe
is thence caufed ; as Gouts^LeprofieSje^c. If in Earthly^
they declare the caufe of the difeafe to have its original
from Melancholy ; and thofe difeafes are ufually long
and tedious, as Gonfumptions, Agues, &c. Zepbar
Kimcim,
If the Significators be governed by Watery Idea's
and Figures inWatery Houfes,it denotes the infirmity to
proceed from cold and moift caufes, as Flegmj and the
difeafes principally are Coughs, Ptifique, and all
noxious difeafes of the ftomack. Agrippa's Jelifntes.
When the pro)eft ions of the Significators cannot
throughly inform you of the Nature of the diftemper:
Confider the nature of the Rulers as well as the Idea's,
Figures and Houfes ; for they much affift in the difcovery

ShaU the Querent marry more then o?ice ?
I Fthe fignihcators of Marriage be double- bodied, they
declare the Qiierent (be it either man or woman) to
marry more then once.
Jf the iignificators be in :;Jf or /[^ with good Fi-
gures, it portends marriage to the Querent n:ore then
once, chiefly from the fifth, feventh or eighth
HouCcs.
But ifyou finde the fignificators of marriage in fixed
places, and fixed, and in Afpeft with not above one Fi-
gure ; you may tell the Qiierent ( let it be either he or
(he) that itprefages marriage nd more then once.

perfon is inclinable to melancholy, yet prudent and
gravely wife. If with Hifmael, you may fay the perfon

'T'He firft Figure, his Id?a and Ruler in company •)(■ or

be imperious .''after marriage, and by his or herobftina-
cy will occaiion much discontent and trouble : But
if they, or either of them be in the feventh Houfe,
the perfon whom the Querent marries will be the occa-
iion of the trouble and difcontenr. Any of the
Figures of benevolent Rulers poirelUng the feventh
Houfe, the perfon, and a friendly reception of the
feventh and firft^ notes a good agreement after mar"

IF the firftbe a good Figure ftrong and potent, free

it
is
an argument of great fecurity to the

IV.
Shall the Cafile or place befteged
be
tak^n or not
?
TTHe Afcendent or firft Houfe, and the Ruler, Idea and
Figure accidentally projefted
in
it, are for the be-
fiegers
:
The fourth Houfe for the City, Town, Caftle
or Tower
•,
and the Ruler, Idea and Figure that
is
in
it,
for the head-Officer
:
The fifth Houfe, and the Gover-
nors ofthe Figure5d^c, for the Ammunition,Souldiery,
and the alfiftance they either have or may ex-
peft.
If
the firft beftrong, and

tenth

tenth in the fecond ; it is then an argument the walls
(hall be fcaled and the place taken.
If the fourth remove into a place not beholding
it,
or be afflifted of the infortunes
;
it
is
an argument
the Caftle will be taten, and the Governours thereof
fiibjeft to danger.
If
ill
Figures be
in
the fourth Houfe, the place be*
fieged will be taken
by
treachery and bafenefs
,
and
that inaftiorttime.
t
If
a
Figure
in
the fourth be
in
the fecond, firft or
tenth, the Governour no doubt hath received
a
good
fum of money for the delivery of the place, and
in
(horc
time will furrender it.
But
if
none of thefeAfpei^s happen
,
but on the con-
trary the fourth Hoiife and his Lord fliall be fortunate,
and free from all manner of impediments
,
and that
the fourth be in no manner of amity with the firlt
;
the City. ^er. then befieged (hall not be taken
by
the Army begirting it.

a

but to finde whether
a

you.
If the firft be not removed, or
if

Thofe Figures are enemies that are Dor cP to the
firft, and the Rulers and Idea's fignifie the quality of
*hem : the Houfes they are in, help your judge rent
much in this point.
The Figure in the feventh Houfe teaches you
to know what manner of perfoa he is or ihe
is.
To know whether the Cuerent or his publick ene-
mies (hall overcome ; obft^ve thofe R.uJe5 of the Plain-
tiffand Defendant in Lavv-fuics j Alutatis tjiiutandis wc

Let us teach you by thefc Examples how to
judge a qucilion of this Naiurc , as we be-
fore taught all manner ot" queltions ^
and
refolved fome lor your diredion.

the feventh Houfe, atidthe Ruler and Idea that governs
the Figure that is accidentally projefted, particularly
are fignificators thereof, unlefs the thing ftiayedbea
Beaftjd^c.
If the firft and feventh be in company or good a-
fpCtfls, it declares the Fugitive^ &c, to be coming home
again.
But if the aforefaid fignificators behold each other by
D or cP, or fnall move into thofe places, where they
have no afpeftatall; it denote-; the Fugitive to be un-
willing to return again, and an unlikelyhood ofthe Que-
rents having him again. If the feventh Wheel about
the third or ninth Houies , you 'i^ay judge the Fugitive
is gone a journey, and will not fnddenly be found again.
IfaHorfe, Ox or Cow^e^c. beftrayed, obfei-ve what
is in the twelfth Houfe; and obferve the fame Rule as
before, onely with the change of the Figure ofyour
Houfe.
The feventh Figure by projecting falling into the
twelfth Houfe of the Figure or queftion, denotes the
Fugitive to be under the bonds ofReftraint, perhapi in
prifon: B^rz^i^e/projeftedfo, argues the fame.
If the fccond Figure ftiall be found in another Houfe,
theBeaftjC^c. or thing ftrayed is taken into cuftody,
and driven and fold.
If the fixth or twelfth m.ove into the ninth or
tenth; it argues the Beaft ftrayed to be either
in the pound, or under the command of fome Of-
ficer.
The feventh, twelfth or fixth, fortunated by the good
Figures of Hifmael and Kedemel , and theii* Idea's Fi-
gures fortunate in the iecond, fifth or eleventh Houfes,
or Fortu7ia Major in A unto them there, they are very
likely to be found again.

Idea's and Figures be Airy, they are VVeftward, and in

Figures in Cs ot -^ to the firft Figure

Who is the Thief? and of his age andfex.
THe Figure in thefeventh hath naturally fignificatlon
ofTheft and Thieves.
Now they ufually obferve the nature ofthe fecond,
and what Figure afflifts Tiiitrqf a contrary Ruler and
Idea , and that fignilies the Thief.
ifthe Figure be mafculine afflifting the fubftance, it
denotes the Thief to be a man: If the Figure be Femi-
nine, and move into a Feminine quarter, you may judge
the Thief is a woman.
ZazH fignificator ofthe Thief, (hews the Thiefto be
old, except in the firft, twelfth or eleventh Houfesj
Hifmael y BarzabeI 3ind ^Sor^?^, about thirty, or fome-
what more; Kederneimd Taphthartharath^ youthful;
Hafmoday according to her age in the Figure Oriental,
young ; Occidental, more aged. And thus much may
inftrud you how to finde the age and fex.
V.
Are there more Thieves then one ?
MAny
Figures afflifting thefignificatorsof fubftancc
( it matters not whether they be peregrine oj:
not) (liew many Thieves, or more then one.
If the figniticatorof the Thief be in
-X-

double-bodied- Figures, there are more Thieves thea
one.
The Angles fixed, and the fignificator ofthe Thief
fixed
,
in
no afpeft with any good Figure, fave with

ttzohtth^Temfus pariendi^^ tempns monendi: Ihere is a
time to he horn^and a time to die. Daily experience teach-
cth us J that whatfoever hath a birth, prefently paffeth a-
way &: hafteth towards death. And every thing that hath
a beginning, doth neceflarily and unavoidably roul to-
wards its end : And this agrees with the Doftrine ofthe
holy Apoftle Saint ?aul^ Heb.p.ij, Ihdflatutum
eft
Hominibus ut femel morientur
:
It
is
appointed mito all
men once to die
:
And they that live the longeft, die at
laft. And thofe whofe lives are envied, do no more but
die
a
little before the reft.
Some live longer then ocheg
by
reafon of propitious
and fortunate Idea's and Rulers fortified
by
God at the
time of tlieir birth
;
which makes them
by
nature more
ftrenuous and ftable, and of longer duration then thofe
who incorporate unfortunate ones.
Now although death be the portion ofevery man and
thing that hath life
;
yet fome pcrfons arc fo peevifh,
rafh and fearful, that they dare not be acquainted with
the time; but are willing. to pafs on
in
a
contented fla-
vifti fear
,
as
if
their -Neicient or Non-vifibility could
protefi: them
;
when alas, poor wretches
!
death fteals
upon them at unawares.
Shall not he be accounted
a
filly Souldier, that will
refufe to know the time he
is
to encounter his Enemie
>
It
is
rather
a
brand of cowardife, then
a
badge of bold-
nefs or magnanimity, for
a
m.an to wink when he fights.
Our life
is
jfihort and full ofvanity.
To know the time ofour death, (or any other materi-
al
accident)
is
a
blefling given
by
God, and (hall man be

IN
the refolve ofthis queftion, you are to confider the
firft Houfe, and what Figure is accidentally thei e;
and let the Ruler and Idea that governs itfignifiethe
Querent: the eighth Houfe and the Ruler, Idea and
Figure that governs
it,
to fignifie the death ofthe Que-/
rent.
\i
the firft be free from the
cf
of
ill
Figures, the Que-
tent may live an indifferent long life.
If
the aforeiaid
fignificators, or either of them^lhall fliallbe
in
compa-
ny or good afped of the Fortunes, and
a
fortunate Fi-
gure
in
the firft
,
all thefe prefage the Qnerent accor-
ding to nature may liv?» to
a
coniiderable age.
*
Finding all the iignificators free, as
in
the forementi-
oned Aphqrifms
5
you may conclude the Querent will
live fo many years, as the Figures, Idea's and Rulers
fignifie.
But
if
y

ther
by

you may then conclude the parties life
to be of no very long continuance. And according to
your foregoing Rules, meafure Time, n^oveable Figures

And Co may you difcover the length (according to na*
tiiral caufes) ofthe Querents life.
II.
JVhat manner of death maj the ^erent die ?
THe Ruler and Idea that is incorporated into the Fi-
gure of the eighth, (hall (hew the manner of death
the Querent fhall be fubjeft unto, together with the
Figure beholding him or them.
If the aforefaid lignificators fhall be Hifinael or Kede*
mcl^ and they ftrong, they portenda gentle death unto
the Querent.
Zazd being fignificator , prenotes death by fome vi-
olent Tertian, or fome Ague, Dropfie or Confumption :
Barzabely by Fevers or Wounds : Sprath^by Pleurifies,
or by fome obfti uftion of the Vitals : Taphtkartharath^
by the PtiGque^Frenzie, Madnefs Lethargic, e^c. Hafi
trtoday^y drowning,or by difeafes proceeding from cold
moifturcs.
III.
Shdl the
^erent obtain his Wives Fortion ?
EVery
Qiierent is fignified by the Afcendent or firft
Houfe, and the fccond Houfe doth fignifie his
fubftance ; the Ciuefited is fignified by the feventh
Houfe s and the eighth Houfe hath fignification of the
Qiiefiteds fubftance in this qneflion.
A good Figure in the eighth, in :*(^or£ktochcfirft,
and no ways afiiided by the cF of any unfortunate Fi-
gure , declares the Querent fhall have a good eflate
with his wife, and (ball have it without trouble. Hi/-
mael or Kedemel, any of their Figures, or the Dragonff
head projefted ia the eighth Houfe, and nowaysaffii-
8 o 7 he Ten.ple o] mfdome. Book III.
£ted, argues the Querent fhall have his wives portion
without any manner cftrouble.
The Part of Fortune is the number of all the points
divided by twelve 5 and what remains, tells you in what
Houfe it falls ; and if eight remains , you muft place
© in the eighth Houfe; and there if good Figures
behold it by :^ or A Afpefts, the Querent fhall have
the dowry ofhis Wife ; and it is very confiderable alfo.
Ifthefecond and eighth Figures being in cP move to
any good Afpeft , this argues the Querent to obtain
his wives dowry without difficulty.
Butiftherebe Dor cP between the fignifica tor?, the
Qiiercnt will not obtain the portion of his wife without
difficulty.
If Zazel or Barzahels Figures be in the eighth Houfe
in
ill
afpeft of the firft'or fecond, there will be much
difconjtenf about the wives portion
5

portends the fame.

the(e Rules will ferve fufficicncly : For the

Barzahel or the Dragons Tail afiiift tl e ninth Houfe,
they declare danger by Thieves or Pyrats; foretimes
it portends cozening and deceit in the ohip, one among

you may judge the Querent will have an inaufpicious

he had let it alone.
If thefirft go into the tenth, that being the fecond'
from the ninth 3 you may tell the Querent that he (hall

created the world round : feeing be is eternal, he hath
creited the world iiicorriiptible.aad everlafting : feeing
he is inimenfe, he hath created the world the greateftof
all things : feeing he is the chiefeft Life ^
he hath adorn-
ed the world with vital feed , begetting all things out of
himfelf : and feeing he is Omnipotent, by his will alone,
not by any neceflicy of Nat»ire , he hach created the
world, not out of any foregoing matter, but out of no-
thing : and feeing he is the chief goodnefs , embracing
hU word , which is the firft Idea of all things , with his
choiceft will, and Lflcntial love , he hath fabricated this
Eternal world after the example ofthe Internal, viz, I-
deal world : yet fending forth nothing of the EflTenceof
the Idea, but created of nothing that which he had
from Eternity by the Idea. Ciod alfo created man after
his Image : For as the world is the Image of Godj fo
man is the Image ofthe world. Hence feme think that
it is (poken, that man is not created limply the Image of
God, but after the Image, or the Image of the Image
of God ; therefore he is called Viicrocofm ; that is,the
leiTer World. The World is a rational Creature, Ini^
mortal; Man in like manner Is rational, but m^ortal;
that is 5 diflolvable and fubjeft to paffions ; and there-
fore may be benefited by this Book, and the Science
herein taught : For (as Sir Chriftopber Hey don faith) fee-
ing the world it felf is immortal, it is impollible that any
part of it can perifh. Therefore to die is a vain name,
and even ^<svactiur}m nowhere, fo alfo death: there-
'
fore we fay a man dieth when his foul and body are fepi-t
ratedjnot that any thing of them perilheth, or is turneci
into nothing. Notwithftandingthe true Image ofGod,
is his Word; The Wiidom, Life, Light and Trutli
cxiiHng by himfelf, ot which Image mans foul is the
Image , in regard of whicti we are faid to be made after
the image ofGod, not after the Image ojf the Worldj,
or

or ofthe Creatures : for as God cannot be touched, nor
jerceived by the ears, nor (tcx\ with the eyes 5 fo the
foul of man can neither be feen, heard nor touched f
And as God himfclt is infinite^and cannot be compelled
by any, foalfothe Mindeof man is freehand cannot be
enforced or bounded.
Further, as God comprehendeth this whole world^
and whatfoever is in it^in his Mindc alone i fo mans Minde
comprehendeth it even in thought, and that which is
peculiar to liim alone with God: a^God movech and[
governeth all this world by his beck alond , fo rrans
minde ruleth and governeth his body. Therefore it was
neccflary that the minde of man thus fcaled by the
Word of God, fhould put on alfo tire corporeal rran,
after the moil complcat example of the world: There-
fore man is called the other world, and the other Image
ofGod, becaufehehath in himfelf all that iscontainecf
in the greater world ; fo that there rcmaineth nothing
which is not found even truly and really in ma:n himfelf ;
ind all thefe things do perform the famJe duties in him,
as in the great world : There are in him the four Ele-
ments, with the nioft true properties of their nature 2
And in him an Etherial Body, the Chariot of the Souijiri
proportion correfponding to the Heaven : There are
in him the vegetive life ot PlantSjtheSenfes ofAnfnialsjof
Celeftial Spirits, the Angelical Reafon^ and the Divine
llnderftanding, and the true Conjunflion, and Divine
^^•pofleiTion of all thefe things flowing- together into one,
'Hence in facred Letters man is called every Creature ^
and not onely ir.an, being made anoti.er world, doth
comprehend all the parts thereof in himfelfj but alfo
doth receive and contain even God himfelf. Kenet

fame facred Scripture tcftlfieth in many places : There-
fore man is the ttioft exprefs linage ofGod, feeing man
containeth in himfelf all things which are in God 5 but

5
which
is
not granted to
Angels, the World) or any Creature, but to man onely,
viz* to have power to be made the Son of God, arid
to be united to him
;
but man being united to God, all
things which are
in
Man, are united
;
efpecially his
Mindc, then his Spirits and Animal Powers, and vegeta^
tive faculty
:
And the Elements are to the matter,
drawing with
it
felf even the body, whofe form
it hath
been, leading
it
forth into
a
better condition, and an
Heavenly Nature, even until
it

is
the peculiar

IS
proper, and common to no other creature.

Therefore in like manner they place three things in Man,
\yhicb f hey call the Supreme, Lovvdl: and Middle. And
as we fay the Rulers, Idea's and l-igures, fo the Supreme
is that Divine' thing which they call the Mind , or fupe-
riour Portion , or illuminated Intelleft. Mofes in Ge-
nef's call th it the breath of Jifc^ viz* breath from Gojj,
or his Spirit infpired into us. The Loweft is the Ctnfy'
^ive Soul, which they alfo call an mi^ge : St. Paul the
Apoftle nameth it, the Animal Man : The Middle is the
reafbnable Spirit, knitting and tying together both ck-
treams, viz. The Animal Soul with the Minde favosi^
ring of the Nature of both extrear.s, yet it diftereth
from that Supreme, which is called the Illuminated In-
telleft , the Minde, Light and Supreme Portion : It
dificreth alfo from the Animal ^oul, from the which
the Apoftle teacheth us, that we ought to fcparate it by
the power ofthe Word of God 5 faying, Jbe Word of
God is fovperful and lively^ more penetrating ihcn a trfio^
edged Svpord^Mefchig even to the dividing of the Soul and
Sprit : For as that Supreme never fmneth, never conr
fenteth to evil, and always relifteth errour, andexhor*
teth to the beft thing's: fo that Inferiour Portionand
Animal Soul is always overwhelmed In evil, in fin and
concupifcence, and draweth to the worft things j of the
which St. Paul faith , / fee another Law in my members^

and every thingthat canbe fpoken

a

it
carrieth its felf equally towards all,

neither more nor lefs

and its felf being fenfible, doth

THe Honour^ Office or Dignity, Profeflion or Ma-
gifteryof each Qiierent, is known from the tenth
Hoiife : And thefe interrogations arc commonly proi-
pounded, viz. i. Shall the Qiier en t obtain the Office
or Dignity defired ? 2. Shall he remain in the Employ-
ment he pofleiTes? 3. What Magiftcry orProfeffiort
will be beft tor any one to fbilow >

The twelfth, which is Cowj^wfr/V, fignifieth that the

becaufe the tenth is a good Figure, it fignifieth mirth
about noon : And becaufe the feventh alfo is a good
Figure in C^ to the eleventh, he (hall fup with the fame

the fifth Line are thofe that govern the Figures : In the
fixth place are the Co-fignificators : And becaufe TueUa
is in the firft, and her Idea and Ruler be friends to the
fiatufal fignificators, it fignifieth that the Week (hall
have a very good beginning. The fecond, which is
fortuna Minor ^ fignifieth that there will be but fmall
profit. The third, which is C^uda Vraconis^ fheweth
that one of the Kinsfolks of the Querent is difcon-
tented. The fourth, which is Career^ which goeth in-
to the eighth and eleventh,fignifieth difcontent or death
ofFriends. The fifth is Via^ and fignifieth that Letters
will be brought (hortly with good news. The fixth,
which is Conyin^tio^ and a Figure of Figures, (heweth
good and loyal fervants. The fcventh is Jmijfjo^ and a
Figure of Figures, but very ill, becaufe ofthe Cofigni- •
ficator, and natural Idea, and accidental Figure, which
jdo h6t agree in Element 5 and therefore fignifieth anger
with women. The eighth, which is Career^ (heweth of
|the death of a Friend, or elfe of fomething of Spirits,
The ninth, which is Caput Vraeonis^ fignifieth a hope to
Tccrivc^
Mony, and yet not receive it. The tenth,
|i^hich is Caput Vraconis^ doth fignifie to dine with a
great Lord this week. The eleventh, which is Career ^
ngnifieth as before. The twelfth fignifieth a good
time to buy Horfes and other great Beafts, asd that
Enemies (hall become friends. But you muft underftand
by this Figure, that the firft fignifieth the fixth hour
after Sun-rifingjand foofall the others unto the twelfth:

THe
firft Figure is a Figure of joy, called Jcquifitio^

and becaufe (he is accompanied with Fopulus^ which is
the Figure of the Element of the Water, it fignifieth
that the ways (hall be very foul. L£titia, which is the
third, fignifieth peace and concord amongft Friends
and Kinsfolks. The fourth is Fucr , and fignifieth
a mediocrity in all affairs and bufinefs. The fifth is
Fortma Majory and fignifieth to take pleafure in fine
Cloathesj trimmed with God-lace and fuch Ribbon ;

tnd to eat and drink^and feaft, and to have acquaintance
ofwomen. The fixth, which is Career^ and goeth into
the eighth and twelfth Houfes, fignifieth the death of
fome ofhisfervants, or to be held prifoner, or elfe fome
ofhisHorfcs to die : And becaufe the feventh, which is
Topulusy is in the fecond, and is accompanied with Car-
eer; it fignifieth that he (hall Marry a Lady fair bodied,
beautiful in fome obfciire place. The eighth^ which is
Career, fignifieth he Ihalldo his bufinefs with great Wit
andPolicie : And becaufe the ninth is in the firft, it fig-
nifieth that he (hall have Money this Month; and that
the Wages and enterprizes which he fhall make, fliall
turn to his great honour and profit : And becaufe it
goeth into the tenth, it fignifieth thereby to have the
favour of the King. The eleventh, which is ^mifftOy
fignifieth that he is not beloved of thofe whom he
taketh to be his friends.
'
The twelfth, which is Careery
fignifieth as we told y6ti before. Moreover, you muft
note in this Figure, that in this Figure the three firft fig-
nifie the firft week; the next three, the fecond week;
the feventh, eighth, ninth, the third week 5 the three
laft, the fourth week. You may place the Idea's and

dertake no caufe that fhall go againft us 5 let the Plaintiif

Alius is in the firft Houfe, and his Ruler and Idea
are of the Nature of Gemini and Mercury in Virgo : and
chis is his Charafter drawn
froin the Figures.
Now although we know God and Spirits can fpeak
any Language, yet this before, they fay he is moft de-
lighted ill. But many doubt whether Angels or Cemi.
fince they bepureSpirits^ufeany vocal fpeech or tongue
aniongft themfelves. But St. Paul is our Authority,
when he faith in fome place, // Iffea\vpiththeumgue
of men andJrurels: Now this is the Idiome beforehand
by this and the Figures do we finde out tlie Angel
Guardian of every man, Celeftial and TerreftriaU And
feeing all Tongues have and do undergo various muta-
tions and corruptions h this and the Hehrnv do always
continue inviolaced. Moreover, an evident lign of this
opinion
is,
that though each Genius and Intelligence do
ufe the fpeech of thofe Nations with wiioni they do in-
habit
5
yet to them that do not underhand itjthey never
fpeak
in
any Idome, but
in
this. But now how Angels
fpeak
is
hid from us, as they thenifelves are; and what
man doth with
a
fenfible voyce, they do
by
imprefling
the conception of the fpeech
in
thofe to whom they
fpeak, after abetter manner then
if
they (hould exprefs
it
by
an audible voyce
:
f
o the Flatonilfs fay, That 5/?-
craies perceived his Genius
by

;
but not of
this body, but

ted in this: ^ft^r which manner Averms believes thi

Angels were wont to be heard and feen by the Pro-
phets. That Inihument, vvhatfoever the virtue be, by
Which one Spirit makes known to another Spirit
what things are in his minde, is called by the Apoftle
St. Faul 5 Ihe "longtts of Angels : Yet oftentimes alio
they fend forth an audible voyce , as they that cryed
at the Afcenfion of^our Lord, Te men

Galilee, w^
fland ye here gazing into the Heave?i
j?
And
in
the Old
Law, they fpake to divers of the Fathers with
a

ble voyce
:
but this never, but when they alTumed bo-
dies, as you may read
in

and
in

ftions.

War durft come near us ; fo in a Months time we came
to Anchor , and being one day in privy council with
the Gentlemen, Captain and Merchants, and other Of-
ficers of the Ship , the Captain defired to know whe-
ther the King of England were well or not : fo I fa-
voured him with this Figure, and gave my judgement
thus : The King is very well,he will come into England^
and in Septemher his Army will be worfted at Worccfter^
and he will be forced tofhift for his life; which thing
grieves me. Now all our Friends in England are very
well, and we (hall make a good Voyage with the lofs af
one man , we (hall have ftormy weather homeward.
Next morning as foon as the Sun had faluted the Sea,
we Ipofed our Fore- top-fail, weighed, and made all full
fail until we came down the Kxsti: Euphrates to lower
Babylon 5
and from thence came home, and found eve-

in the firft Part , obfervc the Afcendenr or firft
houfe 3 and his Figure ; and the Ruler and Idea are for
the Qiierent , and the eleventh for the friend of tke
Querent. Now if both thefe Figures be of one Ele-

and governed by fuch Rulers and Idea's that na**
turally love one another, and they be in :¥• or^ Afpeft,
the friend will prove juft and faithful 5 elpecialiy if they
move into good places ofthe Figure.
If the firft move into the eleventh 5
it fliews affeftioti

On the contrary ^
if you finde the firft moving into
an
ill
houfe,
in
Dor

you may judge the Querents friend
is
not faithful to
him.

\X7Hen
a
perfon hath hopes of
a
thing
,
and
is
unwil-
ling to declare what
it
is
,
yet would be refolved
what the effeft thereof may be
,
and accordingly pro-
pounds the queftion aforefaid
5
you arc to give the firft
and his Figure, Ruler and Idea, to fignifie him
;
and the
eleventh, and the Ruler and fdeathat
is
attributed to
that Figure, to fignifie the matter or thing hoped for.
If
the firft and eleventh be good Figures

and natu-

rally agree in amity , and regard each other from good
houfes by
■)(-
or A, you may conclude that the thing the
Querent hopeth for (hall be accompliflied
,
efpecially
if
the Figures ie fixed.
If the Figures be moveable, he ftiall cither have no-
tking ofwhat he hopes for^ or elfe fo little, that he had
even as good have been without
it
:
IfBi-corporeal
Figures, he (hall then have onely
a
part of what he ho-
jeth to obtain.
If the fignificators be
in
D or cP, you may then
judge the matter hoped for will hardly be brought to
toerfeftion
5
or
if
it
be, the Qi,ierent will have
fq
many
incumbrances and perplexities with it, that he will be
willing tp fliake
it

for the evils fake that at-
tends it. ;'*';
But
if
in
the propounding the queftion, the Querent
tclleth you the particular thing he hopeth

then take your fignification thereof from its proper

vary your aforefaid Aphorifiis

THis
Queftion being propofed indifferentlv, obferve
how the Figures move, and fee what A{])eft may
be between the firft and twelfth, and from whatHoufe
it happens, and fo judge of the Querents private Ene^
mies.
If the Afpeft be D or ^^ and out ofmalignant Houfes -
of the Figure, you may conclude the Querent hath
private Enemies : And if Zazel^ Hifmael or Barzabel
be Rulers of the Figure in the twelfth, the Enemies are
the more to be feared. But if Sorathy Kedcmely Tapb"
thartharatb ov Hafmoday Rule the Figure, they are not
fo dangerous : the more powerful they arejthe more de-
triment will the Querent fuftain by rhemj the lefs
powerful, the lefs evil and mifchief will they be able to
do.
Generally in our praftice we have foundjif any Figure
beiides the twelfth be in D or cF to the firft obfcure
places of the Figure, the Querent hath private Eue-
O^ies , i. e, by Motion.

And thus by the Figures and Idea's and Rulers, you
may defcribe any perfon.
Now ifthe twelfth afftlft the Afcendent or firft Houfe,
and move into the fourth, or the natural Ruler andl-
dea ofthe fourth into the twelfth, and by D or cf af.
fliftjd^c, the Father of the Querent is his Enemie. If
the fifth, his Children (if he have any) or fome Meflen-
ger or Ale-houfe-keeper, Inne- keeper ,Vintner,or keeper

Ofa Frifoner or Captive^ whm may be he freed ?
A Moveable Figure in the firft, denotes freedom
from imprifoiiment in a fhort time 5 ifit move in-
to the third or ninth, it argues a releafe from imprifon-
ment in a (hort time.
If the firft (hall be a better Figure then the twelfth,
and be in
:if
or A to the Figures of Hifmacl or Kedemely
you may then judge the Prifdner or Ca{)tive cannot
remain long
in
the Prifon where he
is
,
but will be re«
leafed.
The Afcendent or Figure inthe fourth, fixth, eighth
or twelfth Houfe, affli^ledby the Dor cPofthe infor-
tunes, Zazel or Barzabel^ the perfon
in
prifon v^W
not be difcharged
in
a
long time
;
and
if
the
ill
Fi-
gure be
in
the eighthj and afflift the firft> he will die
in
prifon.
A
fixed Figure
in
the firft^portends along and tedious
imprifonment:
A
common,the affli£kion will not be long;
if moveable, 'twill be very (hort
:
If the firft Figure be
Cadent from his Houfe or exaltation,
it
prefages long
imprifonment
:
If
the Idea be incorporated into an ill
Figure of the hour,
in
which the Prifoner was taken^
and that Figure be unfortunate
in
an
ill
Houfe, and go-
verned
by
either of the infortunate Rulers
;
it
declares
a
tedious imprifonment, and very long captivity
:
But
if
it
(hall be
a
Fortune, the imprifonment cannot be
long, ...
Theonely way for the difcovery of the time in which
aPrifoneror Captive (hall bereleafed,
is
by
obferving
thcFigUres of numbers, the Figures of hours, days,
weeks
,
months or years
;
the moveable Ideas, the
comnaon and fixed, as we have taught before
in
feveral
places

places j you may meafiire the time as you finde the Fi-
gures according to the inftruftlon, how long the party
(hall continue in priTon 3
and when he (hall be re-
leafed.
When you have learned this Art, thank God, and
ufeit, as, no doubt you will, to do good to other good
men: If any revile as, they are fafe enough, becaufe
the(e things are hid and unknown to the World ; and
fome delight to rail at all they do not underftand:
Therefore v^e took in hand this hard dangerous labour,
which all other of our Anceftors haverefufed, becaufe
they might be afhamed of their wrongful flandring of
Sir Cbrifiopher Heydon and others : And the wife and
well difpofed fee and take profit by the Truth offo great
a blefling.
Now if we have flipt in words or truth of matter,
let them, think how common it is among men, and
weigh the good and bad together ; or elfe Zoroafter
himftlf, when he flips now and then, could never efcape
it : (and yet he was in an eafie matter, Man may
fain for ever ) And had Eugenius Philalethes^ and Jacoh
Bebmen , we think before him. : but you fee the Spiri-
tual , Celeftial and Elemental quality of the Matter.
Although my Pattern you do not fee, becaufe it is not
to my knowledge in the world to be feen : But what
care we >

To obtain this gift, they made an Image in Cofper ;

Afmodel that inftantly refts upon it.
And therefore they made the Figures always hollow,
and perfumed them mthfrveet Odours : for thele Spirits

every power and virtue is from above, from God^ from

who can neither err nor
do evil. It is neceflary that all evil Mannors, and what-
foever is found difagreeing in thefe earthy bodies , do
proceed not from the malice of the influence^ but from
the evil difpofition ofthe receiver.
The Stars and Planets do feed on Ether ^

living Creatures, of a good nature and quality : when
therefore the perverfity of the fubjeft receiveth the
Influences of the perverfe, or its debility cannot en-
dure the efficacy of the fuperiourj then by the Influ-

full of difcords , doth refult diflbnant , deformed
and evil; yet the Ccleftial powers alwayes remain
good, which while they exift in thcmfelves, and from
the giver of light, have their Influence by the holy In-
telligences : and the Heavens even till they (hall come
to the Sphere of the Moon^ their Influence is good, as
it were inthefirft degree; but when it is received in a

Such men as thefe I fpeak to, and fome of thefe hold o-
pinion with me, that where the Sun is either too near
the people, or right over them, or too far off, as under
the two Toles of the Worlds there mens bodies are big
and ftrong, and their Qualkies rude and fierce : where-
as within the two temperate Girdles of the Ejr/^, they
heap a mean, and hit the midft (as they fay) both in bo^

Omc/j^are made more painful then their kinde,fwiftand
healthful for it:and enough fuch like Examples might be
brought if time would fuffer. To come to our bodies
left us by our ParentSj if we fee manners ingrafted and
inbred in ftock, aindred aid Children, and Nephews,
ftill down, to take one after another (a long time) by
kinde and Nature, as that curfed father beating down
jkindredjfet down in Ariftotk and other pilfering Stocks;
which though tliey have no need^muft needs ileal: to let
pafs Lechcrj^ and other evil qualities; and r^/o^r, and
other good qualities, which we fee daily defcend oti
kindred : whence are thf^Ccl not from the Parents
mndes and ofF-pring, which cannot be left nor ingraffed,
but mull return ftraight and whole, and all at once,
when they flit out of this life to that Heavenly place
from whence they came ; neither are all their Witj;
alike fraoi'd by ufe and cuftom, but brought up fome-
times contrary.
Therefore to cut the giddy, reeling, drunken opini-
on, and the whimfies of T/?oJw^/ Street^ and that igno-
rant bold impudent Nativity-monger, Leech^ as ftringa
too much difcording thofe manners fprungout from the
Parents feeds, which is a part oftheir bodies, purchased

wife they follow the nature of Meats, and their diftem-

beget and bring forth for the moft part Mad and Fran*
ticklehildren.
To clofe up all this third part, with this one little
proof: If we fi;ide our felves to do many things againft
our will, as when a fearful thing is offered, our hearts
pant and fail with fear : when as fair lufl and his parts
willarife, whether we will or no, and all incontinency
fp rings from that root, then fure the body muft lay
this force upon us.
But how is this >
you may ask (faith the Genius) and
which way doth the body fo violently over-rule and
carry away the Will and Mimie after her ? when any
(hape appears in the thought o(man , the doing Miiide
takes it ftraight (we muft wear thefe words with ufe,
and make them fofter) and laying it with good and bad>
and matching, and comparing all things by degrees,
determines ; and then her Will and Reafon , which
Plato placeth in the Head, follows deiires ; but at the
fame time fteps in another doubt , Will and Appetite,
lent from that unreafonable and perceiving SohI^ which
is common between us and Beafts; and fitting one part
in the heart, defiringoutwardgoodsof the body : and
look which ofthefe is ftrong, that
is,
which hath the
ftronger Houfe, either

that prevails and moves the Angels unto

I Have a defign to walk on into The Temple of Wif-
dome^ and to difcover what I finde there oi the
Soul^ of (jod^ and his Creation. I have no guide or con-
duftor ; onely I may fay thus much, that I follow no
mans Path to weary my felf with fruitlefs labour j but
that I might the more freely pafs and write the eafie
Emanations of Mine own Minde, and not run through
Wilderneflcs by diredions , or be drawn off from
what ftiould naturally fall from my felf, by prepof-
fefling my thoughts by the fancies and inventions of o-
thers.
Behold in this Temple ofWifdome^ there is fuch mat-
ter which is of a different fort , and has its peculiar fer-
viceablenefs : I followed no mans example , yet quote
Authors 5 what I write is from the Temple ofVVifdome^
and the eternal Chara&ersofthe mindoi man , and the
known ^b^nomena of Nature^ &c.

In this Temple , by the Earth you are to underftand
the potentiality and capability of the exiJienceQi the firft
Creatiotj j this poffibility being exhibited to o\xr minds,
as the refult ofthe Omnif ounce of God, without whom
nothing would be, as is indeed the utmoft fhadow, and
dsrkcft projeftion thereof. And that you further may
underftand how the power of God is exalted above the
courfe of Natural Canfes , God taking of the dnjl of his
dry ground , wrought it with his hands into fuch a tem-
per, with the Aetherial firji moi^ure , that it was matter
fit to make the Body of a man : Which when he firft had
framed, was as yet but like a piece of dough, till God
coming near unto
it,
JVith bis mouth
he
breathed into tht
No\hils thereof the breath ofLife^ which Life was lately
the Souls of Lapfed Angels, and with his word com-
manded the Genius to attend him. This
is
to be obfer-
ved,
7
hat men breath through their Nojirilsy though their
mouths bejhut.
When Go^ had formed every Beaflof theFie/J,and
every Fon>l of the j4ir
,
the man named them as the
Angels Soul guided him
;
and

the fame Genius was

Eternal VVifdom^ and of the Giper-efTential goodnefsj
by a fwift forecaft of counfel and dr£'ourfe of Reafon
truly DiN iie , fuch as at once ftrikes through all things,^
and difcerns what is bell: to be done , having hovered a
while over all the capacities of this fluid pollibllity ,
forthwith fetled upon what was the moft perfe(!l and ex-
aft. Wherefore the entire Deity , by an inward wordj
which is nothing but VVifdome and Verme^ as I told you
in my book of ihe Harmony of the VVorld^ when 1 fpak^
of the power of God edged with A&ual will , and with
more cafe done then we can prefent any notion or Idea,
to our own minds , exhibited really to their own view
the whole creation of fpiritual fubftances , fuch as ^;z-
gels are in their inward Natures , the joicls of men , and
other Animals, and thQ fe mm al forms of all things : Co
that all thefe, as many as ever were to be of them , did
really and aftually exift , without any dependency or
corporeal matter : of this I have fpoken larg:fly in Jhe
Harmony of the world,
God approved and plea fed himfelf in thefe things :
but yet though in defigne there was a fettlement of the
fluid darkne(s ^
or obfcure poiTibility of the outward
Creation; yet it remained as yetbutadark polfibility.
And a notorious diftinftion indeed there was betwixt
this a&ual ffiritiial Creation , and the dim pofllbility of
the material body , and outward world.
Infomuch that this matter was aftuated and agitated
by fome miverfal Angel , yet part of the world of life:
whence it became very fubtle and Etherial^ fo that thiS
was rightly by God called Light and Varkpefi-, and A

T^bert are many vporlds
^
as I fhall demonflrate by the
known Phdnomena of Nature : 1 fliall alfo declare unto
you how God orders a real material Earth , when once
it is made^ to make it pleafant and delightful for
both man and beaft : for the Stars and Planets belong to
number 3 and as a primary Planet in refpeft of its refle-
ftion of Light is rightly called a Planet , fo in refpeft of
its habitablenefs it is rightly termed an Earth, Thefe
Earths therefore God orders in fuch fort ^ that they nei-
ther want r^ater to lie upon them , nor hi covered over
with neater J though they be environed round about with
the fluid Air.
That vaft and iT.menfe Etherial Matter , which is call-
ed the Fluid Heaven or Etherial moifture , with infinite
numbers offundry forts ofLights, which Gods Wifdome
and Power^by union of
fit
and aftive Principles drawn of
the World of Life, made of this Etherial Matter, whofe
ufefulnefs
is
plain
in
Nature
,
that they are for Progno-
flick fignes and feafons, and days and years.
God made the Pla?iets partly Land, and partly Sea,
Rivers and Springs, whofe convenience
is
obvious for e-
very man to conceive.
And God placed all thefe forts of Lights
in
the thin
. and liquid Heaven or Etherial Kegign^ that they might
refleft their rays one upon another, and (hine upon the
Inhabitants of the trpelve Earths,
And that their bounty and refplendency might b«
confplcuous to the beholders of them, whether
by
day
or
by
nightjwhich

Image ; he confifting ofan Intelleftual Soul, and a Ter-
reftrial Bodyaftuated thereby : Wherefore mankind
became Male and Female, as other Terreftriai Animals
are.
Now Tlants and Animals were the Generations
effects and produftions of Earth 5 the feminai forms
znd fouls of Animals infinuating themfelves into the
prepared matter thereof: And 5^72/, Planets or Earths^
were the Generations or Productions of the Heavens^
as you may fee in this Temple : There is a God that
Reigns and Rules the World, and Created all the Inh a-
bitants of the Earth 5 that he is moft Potent, Wife and
Provident ; that he is a Rewarder, Revenger : That
hisj Son fuffered upon the Crofs for us, and that he fuf-
fered not in the fiefh for them as he did for us : How htf
fuffered for the Kevolted Angels in their Region, you
may finde in the Temple 5 That he is to be adored in
three Perfons, and in one Power, and that a God.
And there went up a moift vapour from the Earths^
which being matur'dand concofted by the Angel of the
Worldy which is very aftive in the Heavens or Air, be-i
came a pretious Balmy Liquor, znd iit Vehicle of life ^
which defcending down in fome fore like dewy fhowres
upon the Earth, moiftned their habitations 3 fo that the
warmth of the Suns gently playing and cooHng accor-
ding to Nature, upon the furfaces thereof, prepared
matter varioufly for fundry (brts of Inhabitants , not
onely in the Etherial Kegion, birtinthe feveral Earths:

diftinft Souls ^ according to thepi inciples of his compo-

a felf-moving. Nu Tiber; fome a quint Ejfence : others
have defined it to be nothing but a Harmony conflated
by the moft even compofure of the four Elements in
man. And for this, one might thus argue : The Body is
before the Soul-^ and till the Body be made perfedjas I
told you before, the Soul appears not 5 as ifthe perfefti*

Now let us proceed to the Nature of the Min^e and
Soul ot ManJ out of the treafure whereof all myfteries
are extra^ed^ I fpeak ofthe reafonable Soul^ which is
Divine 5 the other of the uiireafonable Soul, whicli is
common to Beafts , in The Harmony of the IVorU^ I
have noted (where 1 fpeak offorms) thofe two Emanati-
ons of the Souls^ which in the firft Creation of then
both, offer themlelves unto our view 5 that is, that
one hath its original from the breath of God ; the other
'
from the Motrices of the Elements : for oftlie Trimi-
iive Emanation of the Katioral Soul^ as it was in
the Divine Temple 3 it was formed, as I told you be-
fore.
But the Generation of the unreasonable Soul or of.
Beads, wa3 accompliflied by thefe words, Trudmat a^'.;
^ua^Vruducat Terra : And this Irrational 5p«/, as it 5^
in manjis the Inftrument onely to the reafonable Soul^and
hath the fame Original in us^ that it hath in Beafts ;
namely, from the (lime of the Earthy as it is in one
place ; for it is not faid, God framed the hdy of Man
ofthe flime ofthe Earthy but God formed man ^
that is,the
whole man, that Spraculum excepted : wherefore I
fiile that part of the general knowledge , concerning.
Mans Soul , the infiiredfuhfia7ice^ 1 will tell you what
it is in the Holy Guide , the other is th« fenfible or pro-
dua Sonl
There are many and great precellencies of the Soul
of man, above the Soul of Beafts^ evident to thofe who
Philofophize even according tofenfe: And wherefoe-.
ver the concurrent character of llich great excellencies
are found, there fhould ever upon goodreafon be made -
a fpecifiquc difference; wherefore 1 do not altogether
fo well allow the Philofophers Promifcuous andconfufe
4*fcourfcs touching the fiinftions ofthe Sg\il^ as if the
^oul of ^an was differenced gradually , rather thcfl
fpeci-
Book III, The Temple of iVjfdome . 2 o i
fpecifiqiiely from the Soul of Beafts , no other-
wife then the S^?i among the Stars, or Gold among Mt-
tals.
There remains, fays fome body to me, a queftion
to be anfwered, whether all Souls are equal at their firft
i?jfufio77. I anfwer. Nothing comes imT4.ediately from
Gocly but is pure, perfeft and uncorrupt : And if it be
of that Soul purely^ which at the fame inftantisbodi
revived and infufed ; then no queftion but they arc
alike : but becaufe the fenfitive part in man bears a
great fway, it many times falls out, that by the deficien-
cy ofthe Origmal parts^ the Souls is eclipfcd and im-
prifoned fo, as it caiinot appear in the vigour it would
(heiv, if the bodies cbmpofition werefo perfeft, make
it fo fine, pure and open. Now a perfed: Soul in ati
imperfeft body is like a bright Taper in a dar}{ Lan-
ihornc^ the fault is not in the light, but in the cafe 5
which curtains it with fodull an outfide, as it will not
let the fnine be tranfparent. 1 have had men come to
me againft my defires, for I affect not acquaintance ;

in The Temple of Wifdome you will finds your

though not too fubtle, which I contend for, viz> that
the Soul hath aftual knowledge in her felf in that fcnfe
which I have in the book of The Harmony of the World
at large explained ; yet furely this at leaft will be confeft
to be true , that the nature of the Soul is fttch^ that

muft therefore be concluded not fortuitous or arhhram
riousy but natural to the Soul^ to adume the Idea ofa be]
ing abfohitely perfeft above propofed *, it being in fuel
ibrt Cct forth, that a man cannot rid bis minde ofit, bulj£
he itiuft ;ieeds acknowledge it to be indeed the Tde!
of fuch a belig \ it will follow that it is no a bitrari.m;
nor fortuitous conceipt^ but neceflary ; aid therefon
natural to ihg Soul at leaft , if not ever aftuail)
there.
Wherefore it ismanifeft that we confulting with our
ownnaturallight, concerning the notion of being abfo-
lutely perfeft, that this Temple oflVifdome tells us, that)
it is z ffiritual juhjiance^ eternal ^ infinitcin EJfence and
goodnefs^ Omnipnte72t^ Omnifcieftt^^ind of it (elf neceflarily
txiftent 5 for this anfwer is ftrh, that if we underftood

therefore it h true according to the light of Nature i
but it is minifeft that that which is fclf-fubliftent, itifi
nitely Goody Omnifcimt 2L^d Omjupotent^ is the Root and
Original of all things 5 a:id Omnipotency fignifies a Poxver
that can effeft any thing that implies no contradiftion
to be effefted, and Crea:io:i implies no contradiftion
Therefore this perfect Being can create all things. But
if it found the mitter or other fubftances exifting afore-
hand of themfelvc? , this Omnipotency and Povver of
Creation will be in vain, which the free and unpreju-
diced faculties of the minde of man do not admit of:
Therefore the natural notion ofa Being abfolutely per-
fcft5iTiplies that th* fame Being is Lord and Maker ofall
things. To prove there is a God^xs not my intent* I have
done it already in our Htrmmy of the World 5 or to de-

have two appendtyices^ which as they have been by Plato

fented us with fmoak, then zny Lucid flames of truth:
one of thefe is the knowledge of natural Divination^
the other of fascination : But

power in our felves of wagging or holding 11:111 mcft oj

g!ad!y know what doth imxit thefe Spirits^ anddireft

that particular piece of the Brain they call the Conarian
or Pine-kernel ? whatever it be , that which does im-
mit their, and direft them, muft have Ani iiadverfion
and the fare that hath Animadverlion, hath Memory

I may now demand which of the particles in thefe^

the firft Book.
Belides, how come thefe many Animadverficns u

is a fufficient argument that there is but oncj or if there

can be no fuch joynt endeavour towards one defign ;
whence it is that the brain cannot immit ordireft thefe

My Genius bids me conclude that the imprefs of

and therefore that thofc operati-

Sir Kerjle7uus 'Drue , Knight and Baronet now living,
our Friend, and Averroes in his Arabick Commentaries
upon Arijhtles Morals tranflated into Latine , gives a
ReputsLtion to theft Divine Ge?;fi; for fuperiour Powers
do harmonioufly delight to communicate good , and
give certain Precautions and Advertifements ofthings.
This Geomancy is an Art , whereby the JudgemcnC
n:ay be rcndred by Deftiny to every Queftion of every
thing whatfoever : but the Art thereof confifteth efpe-
cially in cej tain points, whereof certain Figures are de-^
dufted according to the Reafon or Rule of Equality or
Inequality, likenefs or unlikenefs : which Figures are al-
fo reduced to , and harmonioufly agree with theCoele-
dial Figures, alTuming their Natures and Properties ac-
cording to the courfe of the Planets. Notwithftand*-
ing this 5
we are to confider, that this kinde of Art can
declare or (hew forth verity , when it is Radical in fome
fublime Vertue. And this is twofold ; theone whereof
confifts in Religion , aod Obfervations of times ; and
therefore they projeft upon the Earth ; wherefore it is
appropriated to the Earth , even as Genii to the Ethe-
rial and Aiereal Region ; Aftromancy to the Hea-
vens.
We judge the hand of the Projeftor or Worker to be
moft powerfully moved and direfted by the Genii , and
therefore the Artift (hould ufe certain holy Incantations,-
Prayers , with other Rites, &c. provoking andalluring
Angels of this nature hereuntOt

Another Power there Is, that dothdireft and rule
this Art , which is in the very harmonious Soul it felf of
the Pro jeftor, when it is carried to this work with fome
great Egre[s of his own Soul. For this Art hath a Na-
tural Obcdieace to the foul it felf, and of neceility hath
t&QAcy y and is moved to that which the Soul it felf de«
fires.
And this way is by far more true and pure ; neither
matters it whether in the Field, High-way, Woods, or
where or how thefe points are pro)efted ; therefore this
Art hath the fame Radix with the Art of
Aftrolo^ical
Qiieftions j which alfo can no other ways be verified,

That thofe InteUe^ud or Cognojcttive operation f

.
prove the Incorporietj of the Soul of ntan^do not
fo certainly prove the Incorporiety of any prin^
ciple in Beajis^ as we have taught in our Har-
mony ofthe World, 4«^ Holy Guide; For
by thefe ExampUf^ you fee how Snperiours and
Infertours Communicates.
YOn cannot fay that either tht Anmal fpiriu ot
the EraiHy are the ^v^]prmc\]p\eso£ Spontaneous
fnotion in us ; but though the Evoeliacon or Conarion
may be the Organ oiCundry perceptions from Cor-
poreal objcfts, and the palace wherein the Soul is
chieRy featedy yet faies the Genius^ it is not that with-
out an immaterial inhabitant; this Arbitrarious
motion, which we are confcious to our fel ves of, can
at all be performed in us or by us : for if we attend
to the condition ofour own Natures^ we cannot but
acknowledge that that which moves our body thus
arbitrarioufly, does not only perceive fenfible ohjeds^
but alfo rentemhers and hath a power offree Imagtnati'
^mndiofKeafon,
That perception of external obje£ts feems in-
competible to the Conarion^ for it being of like iV<r-
i//r^ with the reft of the Brain^\t is not only divifible,
but in a fort divided one particle from another, elfc
it could not be fofoft as it is, though it be fomthing
harder thf n the reft of the Brain ; Now I fay the
72b T/jg Temple ^/"Wifdome. Book III,
Images ofchcfenfible objeds, they fpreading to fomc
fpace in the furface ofthe Ccnarion againft which they
hit, one part of the Conarion has the perception fup-
pol'e ofthe head of a man5the other of a kg^ the third
of an ^rme^ the fourth of his Breaft : and therefore
though we (hould admit, that every particle offuch
a fpace of the Conarion may perceive fuch a part of
a man, yet there is nothing to perceive to ihe whole
manjunlefsyou'i fay, they communicate their per-
ceptions one to another 5 but then ail will be confu-
fed; but this communication feems alfo impoflible,
fur if perception be by imprelTion from the external
objefts, no particle of the Conarion (hall perceive
any part of theobjeft, but what it receivesan im-
prefs from 3 but ifyou will yet fay that every part of
theobjeft, imprefled uipon every of the Evoeliacon
or Conarion^ wherein the Image is, it will be utterly
impoilible indeed, but that the whole Image will be
a confufed Lumpe, no diftinft fpecies ofany thing;
for if perception be by imprelfion, then ifevery part
imprefs upon every particle, the Conarion muft of
necellity receive every part in every part, and we
fhall difcernethe true forme of nothing.
Now (ov the faculty oi remembring of thing$^ that
it cannot be in the Conarion^^e prove thus : for thac
memory which is the (landing feal or imprellion ofex-
ternal objedVs, is not there plaine : for if it were, ic
would fpoile the reprefentation of things prefent,
orra her after objects would be fure todefaceall
former imprefHons whatfoever. But if you'l fajr
that memory is in the Brain^ but Kentinifcency in the
