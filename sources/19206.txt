i got it
oh my gosh oh
it&#39;s very easy to do once you practice
it for a while
the key thing is to first take about
half an hour to meditate
go into quiet mind then sense where they
are
and then invite them well people say
you&#39;re calling them i said i know it&#39;s
not like that
you&#39;re actually making contact and
consciousness and thought
before they arrive in their craft or
transdimensionally around you and when
the et&#39;s
approach us most profoundly is when
everyone in the team
is in a coherent state of consciousness
and are clearly doing this with the
intent
it enhances the part of making contact
because we&#39;re together with one there&#39;s
like a
fine love there between all of us
