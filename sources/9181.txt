  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a back surgery in May of 2012.

  Just shortly after surgery began, my lungs collapsed and I went into full cardiac arrest.  My doctor started what he called 'The death clock', which apparently is engaged when someone dies on the table to  know how long the person is dead.
  
  After a crash cart jump start, I was gone for 1 minute and 57 seconds.

  After they completed the surgery, it took me almost 7 full hours to wake up.  When I did wake up, there was a nurse right above me and I asked her this question,  'Am I dead?'  She assured me that I was alive and then left to get the doctor.  While she was gone, I KNEW something was different or wrong with the world. It was confirmed when a doctor told me the entire story.
  
  After that, I had a few people come into my room who I didn't know. They  asked me what I saw or if I heard anything.  I told them exactly what happened.
  
  I remember it was  very dark, very quiet, and very cool. It was SO VERY PEACEFUL.  
  
  I didn't see a light. I didn't see my grandparents. Nor did I see all my long-gone pets. It was just dark, cool and quiet.  I really hate bright sunlight, loud noises and heat, so dark, quiet and cool is heaven for me.
  
  After I got out of the hospital, I was suddenly not worried about dying anymore because I've been there. It's just exactly what I would like to spend eternity doing, being in a dark, cool and quiet place.
  
  Since then, I have shared my NDE with a good number of people who ask me about it.  I don't advertise it.
  
  The religious people I've told my story to are interested, but feel I 'Wasn't gone long enough' to have the white light experience, or they would say it just wasn't my time.  The non-religious people I spoke to believe that is EXACTLY what will happen to all of us. That we will all go to a dark, cool, and quiet place.  I did have one religious person tell me that I was in hell.  However, if I was in hell, there'd have been bright, burning sun, loud noises everywhere and it'd be about 1,200 degrees farenheit.  
  
  I was very confused when I woke up, but I'm not now.  I am very peaceful and quiet. I'll be very ready for this moment, and I've told my loved ones that I'm going to my heaven.  
  
Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 May 12th, 2012  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.    Surgery-related       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Uncertain Just before I woke up,  I believe that I could hear people talking softly.  Honestly, I'm not sure this is related to the 1 minute and 57 seconds. I was unconscious for many hours afterwards and it could have been staff around me talking.  Since that happened, I believe firmly now that people in comas can hear you talking to them.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness.   I  felt like I was supposed to be there and that I was fully aware I was dead.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         This is a hard question to answer for me actually because the entire thing was just heavenly!  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     It just seemed like I didn't care about time anymore, I just wanted to feel that good forever.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I felt like I was to my right of the body on the table with all the lights off. It was quiet and the air conditioning on and set at about 57 degrees F.  
  
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I could hear quiet.  I know that sounds odd, but I remember thinking that this quiet is the best noise I've ever heard.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an unearthly light?         No     

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I felt tThis overwhelming sense of peace and belonging.  I was  as content as I could be and happy to find that this was going to be the way it will be.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     Being a non-religious person, I actually felt like I could say 'Ya, I've seen the afterlife, and there's no white light, no dead pets and no pearly gates.  I felt like my entire life of being a non-believer was correct and still is.  I had the answer to the cosmic question and it was a very nice feeling!  
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Agnostic   I just don't believe we're here because of a god.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Agnostic   The NDE didn't change my religious situation.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience       

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I'm am now fully convinced there is no God of any kind.  Because if there was, wouldn't I have gone to hell?  Since I didn't go to hell and my experience was  the most peaceful I've ever felt; either God likes me even if I don't believe in him, OR it's all a story from a book.  I remember thinking that in my quiet, dark and cool spot.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I was right about the fact there is no God.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife does not exist          As I was watching myself resting quietly; I was, at that moment, 107% convinced that I was right about life after death.  I remember feeling that everything is all right and I'm sure not going to 'Hell'.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Uncertain.     My back didn't hurt any more.  It was so nice.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life.     I'm comfortable that I have seen a 2-minute preview of coming attractions, and it has caused me  simply not worry about death any more.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember it just like I went through it 20 minutes ago, while I have forgotten things in my life in a matter of days.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Just knowing where I'm going is very nice.  In fact, I feel comfortable about it.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    The first person I told my experience to was about 2 hours after I woke up.  She was a nurse, and not convinced I was gone long enough to see God.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   Well I knew what an NDE was, but never talked to anyone who had experienced an NDE.  So, I'd say I just knew what it meant, and nothing more than that.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It feels like it was SO REAL.  Like I was watching a movie about me, starring me, and doing things that actually happened.  It was like a found footage film that was REAL.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     After almost 8 years; I'm just as convinced today as I was when I woke up that this is a real as it gets.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes.  There were a few times after I woke up that I did say 'I'd like to go back'.  I am happy to be alive, but you have to understand that these 2 minutes were like HEAVEN to me. 
  
  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think it was fine actually.  There were a few questions I didn't follow fully early on, but otherwise it was easy to answer.
