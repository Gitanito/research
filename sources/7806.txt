  		              		Experience Description   

    I was struck by two vehicles at high speed and became unconscious almost immediately. I stopped breathing enroute to the hospital and shortly after arriving was pronounced dead. During this time, I felt just an empty blackness; there was no pain or memories or anything. It was just a continuous black void. 
  
  The next thing I remember was feeling hands touch me. I continued to slip in and out of consciousness as I was beginning to come around. I soon realised that I was lying on a table in a morgue, which was absolutely terrifying to me. Due to the extent of my injuries, I was unable to move,  call out,  scream, or cry. The two morgue workers removed my clothing and I continued to  slip in and out of consciousness. 
  
  My head was propped up by a headrest. I felt almost separate from my body, like I was watching a movie. As the morgue workers undressed me, they measured me and wrote down my details such as hair and eye color.  They photographed me. I found this incredibly distressing due to the fact I was completely naked and these two strangers were just standing over me; my breasts and vagina on show to them. 
  
  The morgue workers soon left and placed the clipboard where they had been writing details onto my torso. I could continuously hear them talking and working in another part of the morgue, but I was unable to cry out for help. I began to realize that this was what death was like and I was  really upset. I had woken up to start a normal day and it had turned into such a traumatic experience. 
  
  I continued to lie on the table for what felt like years. I tried to move and scream but I just couldn't find strength to move or make a sound. I felt like I was frozen, and it was very cold on that table. The most my body managed to do was  urinate myself, which was so embarassing. One of the morgue workers noticed, but didn't do anything. 
  
  Eight hours after I arrived at the morgue, the workers came over to me and realized my muscles hadn't started to stiffen and the blood hadn't started to pool at the base of my body. They checked me over and realized I was alive. It was a shock to my system because I had convinced myself that I was dead, that I was just aware of everything yet unable to interact with it.
