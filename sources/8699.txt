  Assessment of the Reality of their NDE:    Near-death experiencer responses to the NDERF survey question about their assessment of the reality of their personal NDE

  Comments About the Reality of Their Personal NDE:    Comments by the near-death experiencers about the reality of their NDEs (if provided by near-death experiencer)

  Comments:     Introductory comments to near-death experience (NDE)


    This page contains 826 near-death experiences (NDEs) and their response to the NDERF survey question “What do you believe about the reality of your experience at the current time.”  The four survey response options were:

  Experience was definitely real
  Experience was probably real
  Experience was probably not real
  Experience was definitely not real

    There were 834 NDErs that completed the survey. Eight NDErs were excluded because they did not give permission for their NDEs to be posted on NDERF, thus would not have a URL to their experience on NDERF.  

    Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences (NDEs) if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a larger collection of NDEs that include statements from NDErs about the reality of their personal NDEs. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDErs discussing the reality of their personal NDEs.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs should not be included for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!

    Even a brief review of the NDEs below should demonstrate that NDErs generally are convinced that their NDEs are definitely real.  This survey question was near the end of the long NDERF survey, so some comments by NDErs may reference information previously shared in the survey.  The comments from the NDErs are presented exactly as shared on the NDERF survey with no correction of spelling or grammatical errors.

First the near drowning as a lad, then the accident on the cliff's edge. Then in 1982, about seven years later, my wife, her son, and I hopped out of a house that would be completely swept away a few minutes after we left. We left because my wife had a very clear message imprinted on her brain, to ‘LEAVE NOW!’ This was another affirmation of a link to another dimension of some sort. These experiences, as well as others, form a mosaic in my life, that makes all it very very interesting. Not a bad role to be playing, though I have always been puzzled as to why I have had so many unusual occurrences.

Also there were things that I saw her do that only I would have known if I saw it. My eyes were closed when she rolled me over.  			NDE due to snowmobile accident.  		  		  			6125  			Sandy D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sandy_d_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			no change. it happened  			NDE due to drug overdose.  		  		  			6126  			Lieselotte S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lieselotte_s_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			  			NDE during coma after surgery  		  		  			6130  			Ellie P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ellie_p_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			Same as above (Q56)  			NDE with some atypical features.  		  		  			6131  			Kaleen NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kaleen_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			Being Oder and reading other NDE I KNOW what I experienced was real  			NDE due to passing out after donating blood.  		  		  			6136  			Camryn L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1camryn_l_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			I just know it happened just the way you know you had lunch or you just went skiing, it was absolutely what happened.

We often view the world by our five senses, and consciousness is often reflective to stimuli from our five senses in how we view the world around us; so this &quot;other world&quot; we experience, is at least real to us who experience it. When this first happenned to me, my biggest fear was how others may view me when I told them. That fear clung to me for quite some time. Now, I no longer have that fear, as I have had the chance to meet others who also had NDE type experiences. I know I am not alone.. and now that it is being studied and documented by an organization such as yours, I believe is a real good thing.

Maybe they are correct. However, it really doesn't matter to me whether they are or not. I had such a great experience that if it is death and all an illusion...it does not matter. My experience was real to me and I feel I have purpose in living. What else matters?  			Exceptional NDE due to toxic shock syndrome.

However, as mentioned above, at the time of having the experience I had no context into which to put it. That context came around a year later (1975) when I went into a bookshop to browse around for a book to buy. As it so happened there was a special little display set up for a book that was proclaimed as a new international best-seller. The book was Raymond Moody's 'Life After Life'. &quot;Oh,&quot; I thought, &quot;wonder what that is about.&quot;  			  		  		  			  			  			  			  			  			  		  		  			  			  			  			  			I picked up a copy and started to dip into it. I couldn't begin to explain the range of emotions I was feeling as I read this bit, then that bit, then this bit. It quickly became very, very clear that what I was reading was accounts of an experience by people who had been through the same kind of experience that I had been through. It had to be that because they couldn't be saying what they were saying if they hadn't had that experience. I was standing there with my jaw dropped in a state of sheer human joy and nearly crying in the shop because of it. I thought I was the only one! But here were accounts by others. The book did not provide proof of the reality of my experience for me, I didn't need that I never had any doubts of the reality of the experience. What the book did was vindicate my already existing knowing that the experience was real û others had had the same experience too û and it instantly put it into a context that I could see was absolutely right.  			  		  		  			  			  			  			  			  			  		  		  			  			  			  			  			I bought the book and spent the rest of that day and night reading it in a state of overwhelming gratitude and joy, often with tears rolling down my face, for what it contained. It also greatly helped me in slotting parts of my experience into a structure that allowed clearer understand of the experience.  			  		  		  			6589  			Keith M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1keith_m_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			  			NDE due to bleeding after coronary artery bypass surgery.  		  		  			6596  			Wendy B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1wendy_b_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			I can still feel the light.

A Nurse came over to me and asked how I was feeling, I looked at her and then looked at the room, and with a big sigh, I said to the nurse and myself. 'Oh Shit, I’m back!!!' The nurse laughed and said, 'Yes, you are back! How do you feel?' I think I just moaned and asked for some water. After a few hours of myself coming conscience again, an Army Major came in my room with some of my personal gear. He proceeded to ask me where he should have my personal items delivered. He had my Attaché Case, sunglasses, and watch. I looked at my Attaché Case, and I asked, 'How did you find it in the bushes?'…The Major was shocked! 'How did you know it was in the bushes?' I told the Major to have a seat and proceeded to tell him a story that he will never forget. Then I told him that I saw the whole Ambush from above and I know everything that happened. I told him that they caught one of the South Vietnamese Deserters that shot at us, and he had my watch that he took off my body. I told him that all of my six friends were killed and when the MP’s came over to the Ambush site, they killed two of the Deserters. In addition, I told him that a red headed MP and a tall skinny Army Medic came over to my body and declared that I was Killed In Action (KIA), then you came over to confirm that I was indeed KIA, and then the Medic threw a blanket over my body before they put me in the meat wagon that was going to the Morgue. And, that he was the Officer that came on the scene and he was wearing a combat helmet and flak jacket. He drove a Jeep with an M-60 machine gun that was Mounted in the back seat. I told him that he was also the one that found my motorcycle in the ditch and ordered the MP’s to bring it to the pickup that they had there, and put the bike in the pickup!  			NDE due to ambush in the Vietnam War.  		  		  			  			  			  			  			You should have seen the Major’s face!!! His jaw dropped and he was white with shock! 'How did you know all of that?' 'Because your body was over a hundred feet away from the truck and in a small ditch, lower than the road, and then we put a blanket over your body.' 'How did you know all this?!'  			  		  		  			  			  			  			  			I just told him the truth and that I saw everything from above looking at a large TV screen. He just shook his head, as he was walking out of the room, he looked back at me about four times, and before he exited the room, he said, 'Well, I guess then there is life after death!' I said to him that, 'You have No Idea Major!!!' And then he said, 'You know, you were under that blanket for a good twenty minutes at least.' As the Major left the room, the Doctor came in at the same time and the Major asked the Doctor if anyone else has come in to see me. The Doctor said 'No, no one except you so far; he just woke up a few hours ago!' Then the Major scratched his head, looked at me again and gave me a thumbs up and left the room.  			  		  		  			8914  			Scott W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1scott_w_nde_8914.html  			Experience was definitely real  			Same as in #56  			Remarkable NDE which appears to have occurred during a surgery at a time his brain was completely drained of blood and filled with cryogenic fluid. “My brain was frozen for 100 minutes.”  		  		  			8915  			Timothy P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1timothy_p_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			I look at life different now.

Keeping in mind that it happened before I was taught about death and yet I had a concept of death, but it symbolised a transition rather than end. The fact that I wasn't clinically dead does not invalidate my experience, it only suggests that consciousness can detach from the body prior or post physical death.

Very atypical content.  		  		  			9155  			Val C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1val_c_nde.html  			Experience was definitely real  			There was a point in my life where I started to wonder if it was in fact caused by chemicals in a dying brain based upon something I had read about how they can cause you to have an NDE experience if they stimulate a particular part of the brain. Then I thought, but why would we have a 'God' area of the brain if there wasn't a reason for it? Also, the experience was just so damn real and profound. It's hard to just dismiss that. It completely changed my life. I do think, after studying these more, that when we die our expectations create some of what we experience. So some people may experience hell and others a particular religious figure or whatever. I don't think that means that the whole experience is based on our expectations, just that it makes sense that we are creative beings and also there may be a calming function to seeing Jesus or a meadow of flowers that matches your idea of heaven or whatever. I think this is why I saw geometric shapes in the void after thinking I should be seeing SOMETHING!
