well I went to the Air Force on December
the 10th 1941 is three days after Pearl
Harbor I had quite a bit of flying time
before I went in so I went through cadet
school and he graduated in November of
42 and shortly thereafter I was overseas
ended up in England in the 8th Air Force
as a pilot on b-17s I survived 29
missions in combat and came back on home
and when I was released back to civilian
status I was fortunate enough to get a
job with United Airlines and I stayed
with them for 35 years until I reached
the mandatory retirement date of age 60
I started flying when I was 16 and
started writing in my log book and close
it out just the other day at after 59
years of flying ended up with 30,000
plus hours of flight time the one and
only sighting that I had was in March of
1977 and I was flying a dc-10 this is
what it looks like on a flight from San
Francisco to non-stop to Boston it was
United flight 94 the sighting that I had
was in March of 1977 and I was flying a
flight from San Francisco to Boston in
dc-10 and we were about halfway between
Buffalo and Albany at 37,000 feet cloud
cover underneath dark night when all of
a sudden the airplane started it was on
autopilot
airplane started it about a 15-degree
bank turned to the left and of course I
looked out the window to automatically
that&#39;s what you do when the airplane
starts to turn and I saw this brilliant
light off it&#39;s hard to tell exactly how
far out it is
but it was very very bright and the
first officer saw it the second officer
got out of his seat took a look and
that&#39;s when the air traffic control in
Boston wanted to know what was happening
so we told him we when we figured it out
why we would give them a call and about
that time the first officer hit the
autopilot release button and went back
to manual control and as I was looking
out the window why the is this thing
that we had business thing that we saw
disappeared back towards the left of the
airplane and to our rear had a very
rapid rate the whole event took place
puppy puppy less than three minutes or
so so there traffic control said okay
994 you&#39;re now cleared direct Albany on
into Boston Jay ninety four and so forth
the airplane flying using the first
officers autopilot which is connected to
the captain&#39;s compass which is out in
the left wing tip of the airplane and
apparently for some reason or other the
magnetic force was interrupted to cause
the aircraft to veer off course because
it&#39;s it&#39;s hooked up to the compass
all three compasses were giving
different readings which is very unusual
so what we gathered was it wasn&#39;t
enormous magnetic force in whatever that
ball was that we saw there that that
white light
after we turned the autopilot off and
the first officer straightened out the
airplane and we were advised to proceed
direct to Albany we could see Albany up
ahead of us about seventy-five miles or
so in the bright lights from the city
and the magnetic interference that had
been working it made the compasses all
different readings on it all returned to
normal after we had you know leveled off
and started back again and then the the
object had disappeared away from us so
everything returned to a normal state
was very it was round very very bright
light it&#39;s hard to describe the
intensity of it because it was I&#39;ve said
before that in the intensity of a
flashbulb the old-fashioned flash balls
but it didn&#39;t light up the inside of the
airplane it was just a white white
bright light wrong there was no danger
involved that we could see it it took
off and went back and disappeared out of
sight it it didn&#39;t try to make any
attack on us or anything like that well
one thing that the copilot said and this
has to go into your records he looked
out the window across the cockpit at it
and he says I can hardly wait till I get
home and tell my sons about this he says
my mother had a sighting when she was a
young lady over in Europe but no one
would believe her about them
about the sighting
and that was his comment on it after LSE
was bought October I guess my boss and I
were standing in a duck blind up by
Colusa and it was a beautiful day and
the Ducks weren&#39;t flying and were just
there and I thought well I&#39;ll tell him
about this so I did I told him about the
incident and this one he said that he
was sorry that I said had mentioned that
because at that time they weren&#39;t
accepting the fact that there were the
possibility of anything like that to be
seen and that the pilots that had seen
things had talked about it some of them
were let go some released and they&#39;re
flying and treated his nut cases and
things like that so that was the last I
said of it for many many years the
companies don&#39;t give you the message but
what they did to the first ones that did
have sightings takes the case along
don&#39;t don&#39;t talk about it they have told
me of their incidents and their
sightings and then when it happened and
one especially was a sighting back on
the East Coast and he saw this thing for
a long time something about eighteen
minutes that was in view and when he
reported it to his boss was a different
airline not United
they investigated it and the government
said well that&#39;s swamp gas at 18,000
feet doing 250 knots swamp gas no one
wanted to really admit that there might
possibly be something there people don&#39;t
want to admit the possibility that there
are other entities out there that might
come down to be seen here they don&#39;t
want to admit it at all the military
seems to be the one that doesn&#39;t want to
admit anything and of course our
government well I talked to the first
officer about this some years back and
he made it very plain to me that he
didn&#39;t want to take any part in in any
thing such as this the taping or even
relating to it and I did mention
previously that the second officer who
was now flying as a captain had my son
on board as his first officer he&#39;s just
about the same position
and he said
many years ago I was flying with your
dad and we had a sighting right about
here did your dad ever talk to you about
it so finally after all of these years
he admitted admitted to someone that he
did have this item but the the copilot
that he just divorced himself from the
incident completely
