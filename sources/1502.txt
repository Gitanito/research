DUNCAN GASCOYNE
and the
SPIRITUALISTS’ NATIONAL UNION
The SNU President, Duncan Gascoyne1
—who is due to retire
from his presidency later this year—arranged for Psypioneer’s
editor to spend six days doing research at the Arthur Findlay
College during its annual closure for essential repairs and
redecoration, etc.
This was a wonderful opportunity for Psypioneer in its
continuing search for original materials. I was given full use of
its magnificent library which holds many leading spiritualistic
journals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These
include: The Spiritualist, (1869—1882) The Medium and
Daybreak, (1870—1895) LIGHT, (1881—ongoing) The Two
Worlds, (1887—ongoing).
The value of these old Spiritualist journals is second to none.
They hold intimate information on spiritualistic history at the time it unfolded, its workers and
societies, in great and often minute detail. This was indeed a rare opportunity given to
Psypioneer, as there are now only a handful of these journals available world-wide, especially in
long continuous runs. Due to the sheer mass of material made available to me in the journals
alone, it was unfortunate that I was only able to skim the surface of the vital information they
hold on the foundations of spiritualistic history and the noble pioneers.
Psypioneer would like to extend its sincere thanks to President Gascoyne and the Spiritualists’
National Union for the opportunity afforded it during the valuable visit.
Below we will start with James Burns, and his short history of The Spiritual Institution2
and of
the weekly journal which he produced, for 25 years, The Medium and Daybreak.

SPIRITUAL ORIGIN OF THE SPIRITUAL
INSTITUTION
It was while I was in the service of Mr. W. Tweedie, Temperance bookseller, in the
Strand, that I first became acquainted with “Progressive Literature.” It was my duty to attend
to the importation of the phrenological works of Messrs. Fowler and Wells. The work of Dr.
Bovee Dods on “Electrical Psychology” fell into my hands. I devoured it while walking on
the street, going on a business errand. It explained to my mind many things I had been
thinking of for years. I had never been a materialist, an infidel, or an irreligious doubter; and
yet I could not accept what is called Christianity. I at the same time felt there were great
truths expressed in the Bible which time would elucidate, and which professing Christians
were wholly ignorant of. In looking back on the work from that time, I realize that it has
been carried on in greater harmony with New Testament teachings than that of the Christian
Churches has been carried on.
I then began to read the works of A. J. Davis, and his superb weekly, The Herald of
Progress. My mind became illumined with a Light that is simply indescribable. It was
literally a divine enthusiasm. It did not come from the literature I read, though that reading
4
give stimulus and form to that which had been latent or growing in my mind since boyhood. I
was convinced that the Harmonial Philosophy or Spiritualism was destined to enlighten and
redeem all mankind. There was, as I understood it, a universal pouring out of light and
knowledge on every conceivable subject necessary for man’s spiritual health and progress.
There was no longer any need for intermediate persons to stand between the Human Soul and
the Divine Light. It had come to me freely and it was equally free to all. The simple duty of
mankind was to help one another on the way of life eternal. There was no creed or sectic
declaration needed, but that all should follow the Light that came from within, which would
guide them into all that was required. Men, as brothers, should be equally interested in one
another's spiritual welfare, which would lead to a unity of interests in every other respect.
These conclusions were arrived at quite independent of spirit-phenomena. In previous
years I had seen a table move round a room with hands placed on it. I attached but little
importance to the fact. After the illumination of which I speak I saw the possibility of all the
kinds of spirit-manifestation. My experience in after years simply confirmed the inspiration
of truth which I have already described. I have seen as much spirit-phenomena as almost any
Spiritualist in this country, and appreciate them very highly.
THE CIRCULATION OF LITERATURE
I longed to carry out the teachings of the Light. The only path open to me was the
circulation of literature. Orders for books came in, and I imported supplies from America.
Mr. Tweedie allowed me to advertise a list of books on the cover of the Spiritual
Magazine. This was perhaps in 1861, but I have not the Magazine at hand to refer to. Mrs.
Makdougal Gregory called in response. But Mr. Tweedie’s friends got to know of this
department, and I was peremptorily ordered to discontinue it. I had conceived the idea of a
Progressive Library, which I freely offered to the firm, but they wisely dismissed the
suggestion.
The Progressive Library
Being thus free to act for myself, I started the Progressive Library at my cottage in
Camberwell. I had barely a living wage; and can remember the hardship which printing 100
cards of the Library involved. Readers accumulated, and our sale of books increased. In May,
1862, the late Charles Blackburn, Esq.,3
then of Manchester, was my first customer. The work
under my auspices has thus been in existence thirty-four years, but at Mr. Tweedie's it had been
at work for some time previous.
3
Charles Blackburn financially contributed greatly to early British Spiritualism, mainly in the 1870s, for example to
Florence Cook, The Dalston Association, The Spiritualist Newspaper and numerous other mediums and causes. It is
interesting to note that he was active as early as 1862, helping the Cause!
5
THREE YEARS’ TRAVEL
A severe illness followed the great excitement and worry of leaving Mr. Tweedie. The
place got too hot for me. I am passing through a similar furnace now. I went with Mr. Fowler
as his agent, and for three years I travelled in many parts of the three kingdoms. I had
travelled with Mr. Gough for about a year in 1859-60, and knew the country well. While with
Mr. Fowler I met with Spiritualists everywhere, and sold progressive books privately. The
first society I ever heard of was formed through my instrumentality at Liverpool. Mr. James
Wason took the lead, and there were twenty-five members. I soon became the central figure
in spiritual work. I knew more Spiritualists than anyone, and thus I was able to bring those
together in Liverpool who were unknown to one another.
LEGS, BODY, HEAD, AND HANDS OF SPIRITUALISM
While I was [away] from home almost constantly, Mrs. Burns conducted the book and
library business in an energetic manner. I could send home money weekly, so that stock
increased. She and her sister also developed wonderful powers of mediumship of almost
every phase. The work therefore stood firmly on two legs as it were; the leg of interior
illumination and the leg of external manifestation. These firm supports were conjoined to a
body of independent practical work, with the Light as the head. It all grew without any plan
of our own. It was the work of the Spirit; we were willing instruments.
A LECTURER ALL AT ONCE
I left Mr. Fowler, and went out lecturing on my own account. Though I had been for many
years in connection with the Temperance Movement, yet I had never been a speaker. I
developed into that phase all at once. My first week of lecturing consisted of a lecture every
night, spoken extemporaneously, only a few notes being made on a slip of paper. In my
lectures I dealt with many subjects, Spiritualism included, and I exhibited the literature freely
amongst many other books for sale. My lectures paid well, I have made as much as £20 in a
week. I made many valuable friends, and many were benefitted by the knowledge dispersed.
15, SOUTHAMPTON ROW
The Progressive Library at Camberwell became such an important centre, that I was urged to
find a suitable place in London. It took a year to find 15, Southampton Row. I was aided and
supported by many influential gentlemen; when the house was found, I had not a penny to enter
with. The idea came to me to ask for deposits, to be repaid in goods or cash, in the future. I laid it
before friends, and they responded freely. To pay premium, cleaning through out, furnishing,
&c., over £500 were expended. I had then a monthly magazine called Human Nature. The
Spiritual Magazine only dealt with the phenomena. The Light taught me that the whole of
man’s nature should be dealt with in relation to his spiritual being. This idea found many friends,
persons of superior mind and heart. They came to my assistance as true friends. One in particular
spent money in the work that it would have been impossible to do without. No one can imagine
the expense involved in opening a house in London, and at the same time carrying on an
unpopular propaganda.
6
THE “MEDIUM”
Then I was urged to start a weekly paper. Mr. John Murray Spear had advocated that course
from the time of the first convention at Darlington in 1865. The report of it was my first literary
work in connection with Spiritualism. It contained my first speech on the subject, and the
programme of the People’s University. I have a quantity of this sixpenny report on hand now;
friends may have copies on remitting two penny stamps for each copy. It was the forerunner of
Progressive Spiritualism in this country. It is of historical importance.
I had a great aversion to becoming responsible for a weekly paper. My soul felt the galling
chains of burden and toil entering into it in advance.Miss E. Dickson left £5 on the counter, and
the die was cast. I had bought out THE DAYBREAK from Mr. John P. Hopps, which I
continued as a monthly. On April 8, 1870, it appeared as a weekly, under the title of MEDIUM
AND DAYBREAK. Now I had both hands full: an Institution to maintain, and a weekly paper
to develop. In many respects I was inexperienced in such work, and it was all a pioneer’s path
through the trackless wilds.
THE SPIRITUAL INSTITUTION
In one respect the Spiritual Institution was derived from an effort which Mr. and Mrs. Spear
had made in London, to meet with Spiritualists, encourage them, and advise them. Spiritualists
were comparatively few in those days, but they were of the right sort. They contributed to the
Cause freely. There are few gentlemen now in Spiritualism compared with twenty-five years
ago; and those that are left of them are gentlemen still; and I must not forget the ladies, so far to
the front in all that is now being done for this Cause and this Centre.
ENEMIES AMONGST FRIENDS
No sooner had the work begun to take form and give promise of success, than a host of
enemies arose up against it. Some had views which they feared the work of the Institution would
forestall or frustrate. Others out of sheer greed plotted and planned rival schemes, which
ultimately failed, lost much money, and soured the spirits of the investors in such ephemeral
concerns. Space will not permit this line of facts being worked out, otherwise it could be shown
that the difficulties of the Institution could largely be traced to the opposition of Spiritualists. The
Institution has worked for all from the first, so that those who opposed it were virtually working
against Spiritualism; and though they had their own interests as a basis, it never brought them
success.
The efforts of the Institution were so successful and fully appreciated, that a Convention was
held at Darlington in 1872, at which kind and supporting resolutions were passed. Mr. Meredith,
a mesmerist, and Mr. J. Chapman, Liverpool, raised an objection that the “Institution” would
belong to me, and not to them, and that it was a mistake thus to aggrandise an individual. This
was the first preaching of the Gospel of Selfishness in our Cause. Their idea was a shop, goods,
something to possess; while the idea of the true spiritual workers was spiritual work done, with
adequate accessories, no thought of profit, property or possession being entertained. This selfish
notion led to a convention next year at Liverpool, got up by anti-Spiritualists who carried on the
7
farce of a mock Spiritualist Society, and used to disturb the spiritual meetings in Islington,
Liverpool, in a shameful manner. This gave rise to a baseless society in London, which divided
the Movement, and did all it could to frustrate every thing but its own existence.
SUNDAY SERVICES
The Institution originated and carried on Sunday services for ten years. They began in 1870 at
Cavendish Rooms, with Mr. Peebles. Than came Mrs. Hardinge in Cleveland Rooms, and Mrs.
Tappan in St. George’s Hall and elsewhere. In those days these were great events, but they
would not amount to much now. At the end of a series Mrs. Tappan and other workers fell away,
and I was left with a debt of £30, which I made up by phrenological weekly meetings. Through
this burden, the educational branch had its origin and first form of expression.
PUBLICATION OF STANDARD WORKS
While these things were going on, the publication of standard works was being very
successfully effected. The plan was to allow so many copies for a guinea. The Dialectical
Society Committee’s report had been published at 15s. In a very slightly abridged form it was
issued at 5s., but to depositors at 2s. 6d. There was great enthusiasm in the circulation of
literature. Spiritualists deposited money, and had books at cost price. I was simply an agent to
produce the books, claiming a mere percentage to pay expenses involved. In this way some
20,000 works were sent abroad in a few years. It would have cost thousands of pounds to have
effected such a distribution of knowledge in any other way.
THE ATTACK ON SLADE AND MONCK
In the midst of all this work, Slade came to England, and his mediumship still further added to
the excitement. Then came the crash! His prosecution, and that of Monck, though both of them
were doubtlessly guiltless, completely blasted, as with an Arctic frost, the work of the Spiritual
Institution. It had only been started a few years, and the deposits made to furnish it had to be
repaid. Then the MEDIUM had to be started, and in 1873, the Cause was divided into a
merciless and unprincipled opposition. There were liabilities, and burdens, and struggles from
the very first. No reliance can be placed on the majority of mankind. They give no substantial
guarantee in such a matter as Spiritualism. You cannot depend on the ensuing year’s subscription
in most cases. Yet before evil counsel prevailed, the Spiritual Institution had a subscription of
£500 a year, as may be seen in back volumes of the MEDIUM. But with the prosecution of the
mediums, all fell away. The Subscriptions almost ceased, the depositors ceased to take books,
and their deposits had to be returned in cash.
PUBLIC PHYSICAL SEANCES
Soon after the Institution was opened, public physical seances were started under the direction
of Mrs. Berry. She managed them well, and had great developing power. When she could attend
no longer, impertinent visitors had it too much their own way. I was too busy to go upstairs and
take part. People would come down from seances, calling us all sorts of swindlers and impostors,
though I knew that the manifestations had been quite genuine. Enlightened sitters testified to that
8
fact. This caused me to think seriously over such matters. There I was, responsible for goings on
over which, in my absence, I had no control. I, therefore, discontinued these public seances, and
warned the Movement of the danger of them. This was a loss to me financially, as I had one-
fourth of the takings for the rent of the room. I was also looked upon as an enemy of the Cause,
because I warned mediums of the danger in which they stood. Subsequent events proved that I
was right in my polity; and mediums have admitted that I was their true friend, as I am still.
THE LIABILITIES
These forms of work, carried on under the most trying difficulties, came to a sudden smash,
as has been said, by the persecution of the mediums. It was terrible time to pull through, but it
was the best thing that could happen for the ultimate welfare of the Cause. The business
department came to a standstill, subscriptions almost vanished, deposits had to be repaid in cash,
works in the printer’s hands were without buyers, and last of all a country printer, who had
drawn on me freely, became bankrupt. I met all but the last bill of £65. This cost hundreds. The
extreme force of the law was resorted to, and the expense was fearful. O! what we had to endure.
My credit was destroyed.
This was the beginning of the “liabilities” that have borne so heavily since. They have never
been cleared off, and have been increased since then because of the utter inadequacy of support.
PRINTING THE “MEDIUM”
Things got so bad that the printer would produce the MEDIUM no longer. About thirteen
years ago we began to print it ourselves. We had never handled. Type, did not know the case, but
with the assistance of Mr. Parker, a friendly printer, we got out the MEDIUM weekly, and soon
were able to undertake the printing of books.The work progressed, but the discount on the
“liabilities” was crushing, and wasted a good income. We worked night and day. I have often
kept at labour from Wednesday morning till Thursday night; 36 hours is a long day! My family
worked with me. Mrs. Burns being very mediumistic, set type under the influence of a printer in
spirit-life. We had so little type that we were often driven to the last letter. She would
clairvoyantly see one that had got into the wrong box. Many a Sunday I had to set type, which
prevented my going in for Sunday work, so that the happy Sunday services that formerly
prevailed had to be given up.
APOSTOLIC WORK
In the early years of the Institution, I went on many lecturing tours. At that time there were
only individual Spiritualists, and much more unselfish enthusiasm and liberality of thought than
now. The Cause was opened up in many places, and I generally came home poorer than when I
went away. All work abroad for profit had to be given up when the Institution and the MEDIUM
were started. I had to devote myself entirely to the spiritual work, though I derived my living
from my trade as a bookseller. There were hosts of inquirers and several people would be
engaged with them daily. This was about the only free and open place of meeting, and much time
was occupied with that department.
9
INSTITUTION PRINCIPLES
I never have felt satisfied with the way in which the spiritual work has been carried on. In
many respects it is a worse form of ancient sectarianism and clericalism. The Light has
constantly urged me in this matter to my own disadvantage. I may say before God, that I have
never had any personal or pecuniary interest in Spiritualism. That great motto: “The Discovery
of Truth, the Diffusion of Truth, and the Application of Truth to the Welfare of Humanity,” came
from the Light as a crystalisation of Institution principles. These ideas wholly absorbed my
attention, as I was the mere instrument of that Power which inspired the words.
THE BASIS OF SPIRITUAL SCIENCE
Many speeches I have made on the progress of Spiritualism. As stated in connection with my
Human Nature magazine, which went on some twelve years, till it ceased while I was ill, I
regarded the knowledge of Man as the basis of Spiritual Science, and its application as the
essence of Religion. Constant study enabled me to receive from the Light that truthful view of
man’s nature which I was impressed to term Cranial Psychology. To this has from time to time
been added a comprehensive scheme of Spiritual Polity or work, which was presented in its most
complete form in the recent Anniversary Address.
WHAT I HAVE GAINED
This is a very imperfect sketch of thirty-three years’ work, from which I have gained nothing.
I have earned my living all along, and have put my labour and hundreds of pounds into it. All
that I have to show is an exhausted body, and a debt of about £1,000. I have been called all sorts
of things by Spiritualists, and all sorts of motives have been imputed to me, but from the
statements made above, and which no one can refute, it clearly appears that I have never made
Spiritualism a machine to serve myself, that my firm adherence to what the Light gave me as true
has made me enemies, and that to-day I occupy no official position, and hold control over none. I
have simply tried my best to be a teacher, in accord with what the Light bestowed on me from
time to time, regardless of consequences.
I have to express deep regret that my family have been forced to share in these unpleasant
“consequences.” My sons have worked with me without adequate wage for nearly twenty years.
Their prospects in life have been frustrated. The lease of this place expires in a few weeks. I have
got to turn out, and take my spiritual work with me. It is a necessity. But to get out I must find
means to do these dilapidation repairs, and pay off the liabilities, in which my son stands liable
with me. He has no right to be saddled with the consequence of spiritual work. Had it not been
for these burdens, he would now have had a good business, and been free from that overwork
and cruel care which has already blasted his young life.
10
WHAT SHALL THE FUTURE BE?
It only remains for me to ask: What shall the future be? This work must be maintained at all
hazards. That has ever been my inspiration in the darkest of days. Surely for very shame, the
readers of this narrative cannot stand by and see further injustice and suffering devolve on those
who have had the misfortune to be my offspring.
The Record of the Spiritual institution is unspotted and unimpeachable. Its path as directed by
the Light has been pure and progressive. All the demerits noticeable, may be attributed to me,
who am flesh and blood, and prone to the infirmities of frail humanity. But in my spiritual work,
these weaknesses did not enter, for it was the work of the Light, I was only the instrument.
My time is now not long for earth, but I feel that the Light has not done with me yet. It,
has urged me to the writing of this history, and indeed of all the explanations and appeals
that have ever been made in these columns. With the tears raining on the paper I have been
made to plead in such a way as I would not for all that the world contains. But it was for the
work of the Light for humanity that I made appeal, and being only the servant, I was inclined
to obey. Strange it is that a man would do for an idea what he would not do for himself! But
the ideas come from above—from the impersonal sphere.
This is an earnest appeal. I ask you all to rally round this work. Put your hands in your
pockets, and find the means of lifting the burden. It is worthy of you to do so. You need not
be ashamed of the work or of the worker. Perhaps the Spiritual Institution is the one thing in
the Cause that does not stand in need of an apology. Identify yourselves with it in thousands,
and you may well feel proud of being its patrons. It presents the only sound basis of
permanent and progressive work.
Whatever is to be done must be done at once. There is no time to lose. Let me have your
manifestations of support in showers by next week’s issue. J. BURNS.
Spiritual Institution, 15, Southampton Row, London, W.C
_____________
A few points on the article:
The above brief history written by Burns in the year of his death, gives an insight into his
thinking and motivation; the sketch offers much information about his Spiritual Institution and
Journal that are today virtually unknown. In a later issue we will publish a more detailed
biography of James Burns (1835—1894).
The Burns family established an important landmark in British Spiritualism, under considerable
difficulties. Not only was each Society / Institution established by its own merits, but difficulties
11
arose for example in standardisation of mediums’ / speakers’ fees, the force of the law against
mediumship, protection of mediums etc.
Burns refers to the Liverpool Convention. This started on Tuesday August 5th
1873, and
extended over three days, its purpose primarily was the organisation of Spiritualists. James J.
Morse and the editor of The Spiritualist William Harrison,4
with others called for a ‘National
Organisation’ of Spiritualists. But what resulted was a National Association of Spiritualists
initially under the presidency of Mr. Thomas Everitt; the Association was named: The British
National Association of Spiritualists (BNAS), Under Burns’ sub-title—Enemies Amongst
Friends, he was referring to BNAS:—“This gave rise to a baseless society in London, which
divided the Movement, and did all it could to frustrate every thing but its own existence.”
Burns separated himself as an outsider from many of the numerous societies and associations,
but at the cost of some old friends like “M. A. Oxon”—Stainton Moses. Burns recalls this
friendship at a joint memorial address held at his Institution on September 11th
1892 shortly after
Moses’ death: — 5
… “M. A. Oxon,” as I ever delighted to call him. It was under that name, nearly
twenty years ago, that we first became friends. It was under my editorship that he
became popular as a writer on Spiritualism. I kept his real name most honourably
concealed; for he held a scholastic appointment, and his public association with
Spiritualism would have been inconvenient. Another tried to hurt him in this way. In a
manly way “M.A.” avowed his views. In correspondence I asked him whether I
should speak of him in future as “M. A. Oxon,” or W. Stainton Moses. His
characteristic reply was: “M. A. Oxon, at your service.” I love to think of these early
days; and I obey his request now in using the name we all so well loved to recognise
him by.
He was a wonderful medium. The first communication respecting him that I
published, was giving an account of how the spirits had arranged the articles from his
toilet table in diagram form on the coverlet of his bed. He had the perfumes, and
many other most interesting manifestations. Then he became a writing medium, his
controls giving “Spirit Teachings” with a somewhat Christian complexion.
Of recent years we had no communications with one another. Our views and
methods as Spiritualists became diametrically opposed. He was the dissenter, and no
doubt the course he took was more congenial to his purposes. He came boldly out as a
clergyman of the Church of England, and endeavoured to place himself at the head of
the Movement. It was a painful task for me to put myself in direct conflict with my
friend of former years, but I had no alternative than to obey. Though I was bound to
do all I could to oppose his policy, yet no shadow of personal malice darkened my
mind more than at this sacred moment. I have always held that Spiritualism means

much more than a mere catalogue of mediumistic stories—even the most elaborate
and abundantly attested. We may make a fad of these things, and miss the true aim of
the movement altogether, which so many of us regard as a New Dispensation of
religious thought and moral sociology for the onward progress of mankind. As
such we find that it comes in conflict with the dogmas and traditions of that form
of ecclesiasticism of which our departed brother avowed himself an ordained
priest. How then could any consistent Spiritualist accept the ordained priest of an
opposing sect as a leader in Spiritualism? The act would be suicidal, and the last
few years of “M. A.’s” labours show it. There can be no advance on the lines he
followed, no altitude gained, no permanency established. The building is not
firmly fixed on the rock of Truth, but on the fleeting sands of Phenomena.
BNAS would evolve into The London Spiritualist Alliance (LSA), later The College of Psychic
Studies (CPS), as it is today. Their early BNAS members would also help substantially in the
foundation of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). 6
It is interesting to note under Burns’ sub-title—Three Years’ Travel, he states:—“The first
society I ever heard of was formed through my instrumentality at Liverpool. Mr. James
Wason took the lead, and there were twenty-five members.” Was James Burns one of the
fifteen gentlemen who on 26th of April, 1866, at the Co-operative Stores, Camden Street,
Liverpool formed this society? Below is taken from The Spiritualist, May 1st

The founding of the Liverpool Psychological Society:
SPIRITUALISM IN LIVERPOOL
A REVIEW of the progress of Spiritualism in Liverpool during the past few years may be
of interest, so I may state that on the 26th of April, 1866, fifteen gentlemen held a meeting at
the Co-operative Stores, Camden-street, to take into consideration the desirability of forming
a society having for its object the study of psychology, particularly the investigation of the
facts and teachings embodied in the term “Spiritualism.” A committee was formed, Mr.
James Wason being elected president; Mr. Andrew Leighton, vice-president; Mr. Richard
Bewley, secretary; and Mr. George Wilson, treasurer. The meetings were held every alternate
week, for a considerable time, in the above-named place, when Mr. Wason took the
Gymnasium in Lord-street, at his own expense, and placed it at the service of the society,
which afterwards met there for some time. The first report was published in April, 1867. A
fresh committee had been appointed during the preceding year (1866); manifestations of a

13
very satisfactory character had taken place; and Mr. Fegan-Egerton had been developed as a
very good trance medium. A library was formed, and several presents of books were made to
the society, Mr. Benjamin Coleman, Mr. J. Wason and Mr. Wilson being amongst the donors.
In April, 1867, Mr. S. Guppy was introduced to the society by Mr. Mason; he gave an
account of some of his experiences, and instructed members how to act to get manifestations.
In the same month, Mr. D. D. Home, the celebrated medium, visited Liverpool, when the
members of the society inaugurated a soiree in honour of his visit to Liverpool. Mr. Home
very satisfactorily answered many questions put to him at the soiree upon the subject of
Spiritualism.
The members, some little time afterwards, were separated, and, in consequence, the usual
meetings were discontinued, and for three years there was no properly organised body of
Spiritualists in Liverpool.
However, in December, 1870, an attempt was again made by some of the former
members to reconstitute the society, or organise a new one, and several persons attended a
meeting at Mr. Wall’s Temperance Hotel, 1, Islington Flags. It was there agreed to organise a
new society upon the basis of the old one, and at a subsequent meeting, held on Wednesday,
4th January, 1871, in the same place, the following office-bearers were, with a committee of
management, elected to act during the ensuing year, viz.:—Mr. George Glover, president;
Mr. William Wall, vice-president; Mr. George Wilson, treasurer; and Mr. Ambrose Fegan-
Egerton, secretary. The members met weekly, and with their well-developed medium, Mr.
Fegan-Egerton,7
they often received good and exalted spiritual communications through him;
these spirits were of different nationalities, some English, some French, some Spanish, and
some Scotch; they all spoke in their native tongue or dialect. The members gradually
increased in number and extended the influence of the society; week by week new recruits
were added, but no very great effort was made to bring in the public at large.
In the autumn of 1871, the Rev. John Jones, a Congregational minister, preached and
published a sermon against Spiritualism, which was the means of arresting much public
attention. Mr. Fegan-Egerton (under the signature of “Vindex”) wrote and published a reply
to this sermon; he successfully refuted the rev. gentleman's arguments, and beat him with his
own weapons.The society followed this up by distributing a large quantity of tracts; these
were the means of stimulating inquiry, and, in consequence, many circles were formed in the
town.
In the same year, on the 9th of May, Mrs. Hardinge, under the society’s auspices, lectured
in Hope Hall to a very large and intelligent audience, and this was the means of raising the
standard of Spiritualism in the estimation of the outside public. She subsequently delivered
several other lectures in the same hall. Mr. James Burns delivered three lectures, also under
the auspices of the society, in the Wellington Hall, Camden-street, which were very
convincing to those who were investigating the subject.
7
Ambrose Fegan-Egerton, was classed as one of the best developing physical mediums in Liverpool.
14
Mr. J. J. Morse, trance-medium, has been engaged principally for the Sunday services.
These services prove to be the means of drawing together a greater number of people, and of
giving the public a greater opportunity for investigating Spiritualism, than any other means
which had previously been employed by the society. The services partake more of a religious
than a secular character.
The physical phase of Spiritualism has also been cultivated; strange and convincing
phenomena have been witnessed through the mediumship of Mr. Fegan-Egerton, and been
the means of convincing many. Every week brings higher and more satisfactory results.
During the last few months the society has increased rapidly in numbers; indeed to such
an extent as was never before experienced. Circles are held every week, and new circles are
being constantly formed in various parts of Liverpool. Several new mediums have been
developed; amongst others, Mr. Joseph Shepherd, and his grand-daughter, Miss Shepherd.
Mrs. Lamont is developing into a good healing medium.
The members of the society generally work harmoniously together; the governing body is
at present composed of very intelligent men, good and useful work being the result.
JOHN CHAPMAN, Honorary Secretary.

To conclude this selection of material on Burns:
Burns refers to traveling with the Phrenologist Mr. Fowler at the time of the first convention at
Darlington in 1865. He states: “The report of it was my first literary work in connection with
Spiritualism. It contained my first speech on the subject, and the programme of the People’s
University. I have a quantity of this sixpenny report on hand now; friends may have copies on
remitting two penny stamps for each copy. It was the forerunner of Progressive Spiritualism in
this country. It is of historical importance.”
Below is a letter printed in ‘The Medium and Daybreak’ Friday August 3rd
1883:
MY FIRST CONTRIBUTION TO SPIRITUAL
LITERATURE
BY J. BURNS
It is just eighteen years, this week, since I read my first writing on Spiritualism, at a
convention held at Darlington. I had then been a spiritual worker for several years, and the
Progressive Library had been in operation for over two years, and had become the recognised
centre of spiritual work in this country. I was, at the time, travelling with Mr. L. N. Fowler, the
Phrenologist, and to that science and other Anthropological subjects, including the works of A. J.
Davis, I had given as much attention as a busy life would permit.
With Mr. Hodge, of Darlington, and others, I was a promoter of this convention. It was the
first general assemblage of British Spiritualists, and the origin of a free platform in connection
with the Movement. My chief burden in the matter was the loss of time and expense of attending;
the production of this paper, and the compilation and editing of the Report, which, and that of the
succeeding year, I printed, and for which I was never paid. These Convention Reports were the
beginning of all my toil and troubles in connection with the Cause, and the forerunners of the
MEDIUM, and all the work which has gathered around it. An Association of Progressive
Spiritualists was formed, of which I was never a member. It ended in anarchy, leaving me to
struggle on with the work, heavily saddled with the “liabilities” of printing. I have thus had
considerable experience of “organisation,” Spiritualists, and spiritual work—a trinity not
altogether in unity.
I had no time to prepare my paper; my duties as Mr. Fowler’s secretary occupied me
completely. One day the theme and its arrangement flashed into my mind, but only a few
sentences were jotted down in a memorandum book when I went to Darlington to attend the
Convention. On two mornings I got up, and, accompanied by a sympathetic lady, walked to the
cemetery, where, sitting on a tombstone, I extended my little essay. It was a circle of two. I shall
ever entertain a sacred regard for that gentle soul, who stood by me all through that convention;
for then, as at other times, I found myself in a minority.
Being a young man, and of no position in the world, my contribution naturally found a place
near the end of the proceedings. I was glad of this, as it gave me more time to complete my
16
paper, but I could make no progress, as I was continually engaged taking notes of proceedings.
When I stood up to decipher my scrawl, I had only got some two-thirds through the subject.
When I came to the end of the writing, I kept on talking, and finished somehow. Afterwards I
tried to recall the thoughts, but I have never been satisfied with the effort.
There was no time to polish up, not even in preparing for press; for I did it all as I travelled
from place to place, absorbed with other duties. Yet that first convention was not literary foppery
or servility of expression, but outspoken truthfulness and honesty of purpose. We feared to
offend no one, and only cared to please that Eye of the Supreme-Conscience. At least, I answer
for myself.
In placing this first effort before the readers of the MEDIUM, I find little to alter. Some of the
expressions are tentative and speculative; but I still feel inclined to stand by them. I may say that
it is in these principles that I have worked for over twenty years always in a minority; with the
“liabilities” continually dropping on to me; and without pay or applause. Principles that curtain
so much backbone are not to be despised. And brain and muscle too: for out of these same
principles have swung the enlightening thought and active agency of the spiritual work in this
and other lands, where the influence of this centre has reached. Not because they are my
principles, but because they contain essentially those truths which are universal, and on the lines
of which the great Spiritual Work is being carried on. “Every good and perfect gift cometh down
from above.”
I reproduce this essay, because not a few people have wasted their poor brains overhauling
my conduct in the work of Spiritualism, industriously searching for incongruities. Now this does
not at all hurt me, for it matters not, as far as I am concerned; what people think or say of me.
But it is the “poor brains” that I am concerned about. Pity they cannot be applied to a better
purpose. The Movement wants brains—brains properly applied. I refer to this first statement of
my views to enable all to judge of the consistency that has marked the course of these eighteen
years. There are views on the use of mediums, the motive of spiritual workers, the basis of
action, as well as philosophical and theological considerations, which I would seriously refer to
the kind attention of the reader. Since that time I have engaged in many experiments in spiritual
polity, and phenomenal investigation, the result of the whole of which to-day points with
emphasis to those thoughts that illuminated the mind in the grey dawn of that spiritual morning.
I had seen but little phenomena then. Spirit communion of a beneficent kind was enjoyed by
my family, but for several years I was never at home, but a night or two at a time, and,
consequently, saw none of it; but what I heard was all that could be desired, as it has been all
along. My Spiritualism was, and has been, the light within; which explains all facts, determines
all phenomena, resolves all difficulties, and is a guide to that which is most appropriate and best.
The basis on which I erected my school of thought, comprehended an educational area vastly
greater than that which is occupied by the notions of a certain class of “Spiritualists” of a type
too frequently most noisy and self-assertive in the Movement.

OUR NEW PRESIDENT
Wilson family tradition goes back to 1870
Mr. Percy Wilson, his son Laurence and Mr. McIndoe, on the occasion of a séance with Mrs. Bailey of Belper in
1941. The flowers seen in the vases were apported into the room.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE LOST LEADER:—an introductory note by LP.
Many able people have served the SNU—Ernest Oaten would be an outstanding example. But
Percy Wilson has some claim to be the ablest, certainly post-war. The sketch above appeared on
his election to the SNU presidency. It was a propitious moment, with mediumship about to be
legalised in 1951. A new dynamic was needed. But Percy and his colleagues differed on what
that might be. As Jean Bassett reported (100 Years of Spiritualism, p.60.) 8
“In 1953 Percy Wilson resigned, not only from Presidency but from Council. He stated
that he could not accept the responsibility for the decisions the Council had taken since
the last AGM. At the time he had made it clear that he did not see the role of the Council
as spiritual advisers to the members for the purpose subscribed. The council should be
legal or administrative in character.”
Percy was not of course lost to the Union—he was soon back on Council. He was also a major
contributor to the Vigurs report of 1964, which was an attempt to equip the Union for the modern
world. By then, Charles Quastel, who had championed the spiritual advisory role for the Union,
was president.

18
The historian will naturally wonder whether the achievements of Percy in Spiritualism were
commensurate with his abilities. Was he perhaps, despite his civil service background, not good
with committees? Why did he not write any books; hat his literary legacy is just many valuable
articles and letters, often tantalizing in what they do not fully discuss, such as Helen Duncan?
Why despite his long acquaintance with psychical researchers, did he not work much even with
the more liberal ones?
And then there was the Unitarian9
connection. This was by no means uncommon in the early
days of the SNU—Psypioneer will print more evidence about such links soon—and it may partly
explain why Percy did not want the SNU council to interest itself in spiritual matters. It is a moot
point whether Percy would even be allowed to join the SNU today, because of this connection
with another religious body.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FROM the earliest days of the British Spiritualist Movement the family of our new President,
Mr. Percy Wilson, has been associated with its work.
Sometime in the eighteen-sixties Mr. Wilson's grandfather, Mr. A. D. Wilson, became a
Spiritualist, and in 1871 he was elected secretary of the Halifax Spiritualist Society.
He had been a Unitarian minister and gave up his appointment to serve the ‘cause,’ thus
sacrificing his income and condemning himself and family to poverty for many years.
But he became the friend of Emma Britten, Cora Tappan, J. J. Morse and others, and that
made up for his material losses.
A Founder of Sowerby Bridge
He was one of the founders of the Sowerby Bridge Church and trained its choir. It was there
that he introduced Alfred Kitson to Lyceum work (the latter told the story later in an address at
Sowerby Bridge in 1886, which was published in the Medium and Daybreak).
Percy Wilson's father, T. W. Wilson, was thus born a Spiritualist in 1871. In his youth he
accompanied his father on many of his Spiritualist adventures, but since then has not played an
active part in the Movement.
Hanson G. Hey
His grandfather's mantle in the Movement fell on his stepson, Hanson G. Hey, who was
brought up as a member of the Sowerby Bridge Lyceum. In his younger days Hanson Hey
divided his interests between Spiritualism and Socialism, learning the art of public speaking by
street-corner oratory. He was a great friend of Keir Hardie and a founder of the I.L.P.
9

19
By 1900, however, he had decided to devote his life to Spiritualism and gave up the prospect
of a sure seat in Parliament to do so. He also rejected an offer of a guaranteed salary for life of
£500 a year from the Imperial Tobacco Company, who wanted to take him over when he was
Hon. Sec. of the Tobacconists’ Retailers Federation, but he wanted to be free to devote all his
time to the Movement.
When the Union was founded he became Vice-President, but within three months took over
the job of General Secretary which he retained until he died in 1921. His tobacconist's shop at
68, Crown Street, Halifax, was the first registered office of the Union and became a sort of
Mecca for both Socialists and Spiritualists. It was there that, as a boy, Percy Wilson met the
leaders of the Movement—both before and after the founding of the Union.
Early Days
Our President was born in 1893, and when six weeks old was named at the Sowerby Bridge
Church by J. J. Morse and Tien Sien Tie. In his younger days, he played no part in Spiritualism
apart from the meetings at 68, Crown Street, and later at 30, Glen Terrace, to which Hanson Hey
retired just before the First World War. He became a member of the Unitarian Church to which
his grandfather had been attached, but as a young man, anxious to find the real truth of religion
he set out to explore the whole field of religion by visiting the various denominations.
Eventually he decided to return to the Halifax Unitarian Church at the age of seventeen. He is
still a member of a Unitarian Church in London where he was married some thirty odd years ago.
Oxford P.R.S.
In 1910, Mr. Wilson obtained a scholarship to the Queen's College, Oxford, in Mathematics,
and continued there until after the outbreak of war in 1914, obtaining two ‘Firsts’ in Schools.
Whilst at Oxford he joined with a number of others, including Dr. F. C. S. Schiller, Professor
McDougall and the present Regius Professor of Greek, Eric Dodds, in re-founding the Oxford
University Psychical Research Society. Incidentally, that society went out of existence again
during the 1914-18 war, but was resuscitated by his two younger sons in 1943, and is now
flourishing.
The L.D.C.
His first active contact with Spiritualism as an organised Movement took place in 1903, when
Hanson Hey took him to London on the occasion of his visit to persuade the London Union to
become the District Council of the S.N.U. He still remembers the meeting in John Adams’s
tailor’s workshop in Cheapside when he sat cross-legged on the cutting-out bench whilst his
revered seniors discussed weighty matters. It was there that he met John Adams, Geo. Taylor
Gwinn and Richard Boddington for the first time.
20
1912 International Congress
From that time until the First World War he met many of our old workers, including Ernest
Oaten, Frank Hepworth, George Young, Ernest Button, Mrs. Stair, Mrs. Batie and Aaron
Wilkinson. He took an active part at the International Congress at Liverpool in 1912, where he
translated some of the papers from the French.
The 1914-18 war took him into the Navy and out of close contact with the Movement.
Then in 1917, he became a member of the S.N.U. and the S.P.R., and until about 1924-5, did
various odd jobs for the Union, including the revision of Hanson Hey’s pamphlet, “The Seven
Principles” for re-publication in 1923.
Radio Days
After 1923, however, his family and official preoccupations began to weigh heavily. He had
become an administrative officer of the Board of Education; and one of the old loves of college
and naval days—radio—took up a great deal of his time and soon developed into a hectic period
of research into the principles of sound reproduction. For some sixteen years thereafter he
became Technical Adviser to Compton Mackenzie’s and Christopher Stone’s paper The Gram-
ophone; and apart from a challenge he made in that paper to Mackenzie to debate Spiritualism
with him after a rather slighting reference he had made, his activities on behalf of the Movement
were suspended.
Bereavement
In 1937, Mr. Wilson’s second son died in rather tragic circumstances, and it was indirectly
arising out of that that his Spiritualist contacts were renewed through the encouragement of
Ernest Oaten, who introduced him to Harold Vigurs who by that time had come to occupy a
prominent place in the Spiritualist firmament in London.
L.D.C. President
Thereafter his life became just one continuous assumption of more and more Spiritualist
duties, first as Secretary of the Publicity and Propaganda Committee of the London District
Council, then in 1941, as its President, then later in 1941 as National Councillor of the Union and
Chairman of the Exponents and Education Committee of which his wife had already become
Secretary in 1939.
Ministry of Transport
In 1937, he was transferred from the Board of Education to the Ministry of Transport to take
charge of a new branch of the Ministry which had just become responsible for the Trunk roads of
the country. Thereafter Highways Administration became his province in place of educational
administration, and it was as the representative of the Ministry of Transport on various Cabinet
Sub-Committees that helped him to build up the technique of Town and Country Planning
21
administration. In 1945, he became Principal Assistant Secretary of the Ministry and it seemed as
though the course of his future career in the public Service had become well settled. He knew the
permanent heads of nearly every Government department and was a personal friend of many of
them; and was on friendly, even familiar, terms with many of the leading Parliamentarians of all
three political parties. For these reasons it looked as though his work for the Spiritualist
Movement would have to be severely curtailed.
Spirit Messages
How wrong was that conclusion soon became manifest. During the war-time years his friends
on the other side developed an interesting technique of conveying messages to him. As many as
six or seven mediums might be involved in each message, according to the measure of its
importance. Each would give part and, often enough, would not understand what it meant. It
would be spontaneous on their part and Mr. Wilson made a practice of never pressing them.
Sometimes he had a little difficulty in linking up the various parts, but not very often: there was
usually some striking code word which linked up with the part last given, but he did not know in
advance what it would be. Many of our well known pioneers on the other side were members of
the band and gave evidence of their interest, but as a rule the communicator was either Emma
Hardinge Britten, J. J. Morse, Hanson Hey or Frank Blake.
Spirit Guidance
It was not long before he came to realise, from the way in which a message was wrapt up, that
it was one of this band who was giving advice. Mr. Wilson asserts that he has taken no important
step, whether in connection with the Movement or with his personal career during the past five
or six years, without having definite, positive advice from this band, given to him in such a wav
as to overwhelm all his innate scepticism. This applies to his acceptance of a Directorship of
Psychic News in 1945, to his resignation from the London District Council in 1949, and to his
refusal of nomination for the Presidency of the Union in the years between 1944 and 1950.
Illness
Indeed Mr. Wilson is equally certain that this also applies to the manner of his being put upon
the sick list from 1947 to 1949, and to his retirement from the public service in March 1949 “on
grounds of ill-health.” He says he was never unduly perturbed about his health in these years, nor
was his wife, even when his friends shook their heads, or when the Harley Street specialist
waved two finger’s in the air and said, “Either a complete rest or a complete wreck.” They knew
that a plan was being worked out ‘over there’, and that any false steps they made would be nulli-
fied some way or other.
During this period of illness his official career had been sacrificed, many friendships broken,
and with the passing of his wife, domestic tranquility was shattered beyond all belief. Yet the
work to which he had been dedicated at Sowerby Bridge, nearly sixty years ago, and to which he
rededicated himself not so many years ago, still goes on. He is content that it should be so,
knowing full well that until the time comes when he shall be allowed to resume his personal
22
hobbies and idiosyncrasies, the work to be done for the Spiritualist Movement will continue to
be guided and directed, and false moves frustrated by our leaders “over there.”
Reconstruction
What of the future? Only the next part of their plan has so far been revealed to him. But again
and again Mrs. Britten has said to him: “What was suited to our day is not suited to yours; we
must destroy much of what we built, and you must rebuild anew, even from the foundations.
They are sound enough. The outward appearance of Spiritualism will be transformed, but the
basis is secure for always and upon it will depend the sanity of the world.”
Since the above message was set up in type, the editor has been informed that precisely the
same message has been repeated verbatim and confirmed to Mr. Wilson on a chance visit to
Nottingham last Tuesday, when a medium friend was spontaneously controlled by Mrs. Britten
and demonstrated in a most dramatic fashion the personal style and characteristics so often
recorded of this communicator. The medium had never been controlled by Mrs. Britten before,
and knew nothing of the communicator so evidentially confirmed by her.
______________________
CONAN DOYLE PAPERS FOUND
Papers and correspondence relating to the famous communications from Arthur Conan Doyle
through Grace Cooke (GEC) have been found at The University of Texas—Harry Ransom
Center. They fill some gaps in the correspondence reported in Arthur Conan Doyle’s Book of the
Beyond (BOB), 1994, edited by Colum Hayward—originally Thy Kingdom Come, 1933, by
Hayward’s grandfather, Ivan Cooke (IC), and rewritten and published as The Return of Arthur
Conan Doyle by IC in 1956.
There are 2 handwritten accounts of what appears to be the first séance at the Doyle home (BOB
p.21). One is by LCD and reports what White Eagle said. The other is a general account of the
séance which may be written by daughter Mary. As LCD died in 1940, anything she wrote would
remain in copyright in the European Union until 2010.
Ivan Cooke, husband of the medium, typed most but not all his letters—he had come to feel,
perhaps, that Lady Conan Doyle (LCD) was difficult, and it might be prudent to write formally.
He may also have typed some items for GEC.
There is a typed account signed by Brighteyes (GEC) of her remarkable vision at the
Remembrance meeting at the Albert Hall in November 1930, in which she saw various pioneers
with ACD including Crookes, Stead and Mrs Britten. (BOB p.84)
The top copy of the “very disloyal” letter of 23 July 1933 is also present. (BOB p.28)
23
There is another typed 6 page letter from IC in defence of GEC from Wembley Park on 3 June
1931. It is the Cooke reply to LCD’s criticism of 1 June.
GEC passed on several early messages from “Arthur” to LCD. But by 1935, she reverted to
signing a typed letter “Grace Cooke”- LCD was evidently upset about something. IC also wrote
several letters in response to LCD’s anxiety about the book Thy Kingdom Come.
In her own handwritten letters to LCD, GEC used a faint ink on coloured writing paper which
has faded, though this might be better when printed out, rather than just viewed.
Psypioneer has obtained a CD of the above material. Garth Willey has also secured a photocopy
of the Ransom Center’s ACD card indices from the University, which will facilitate a search for
other names in the case. He has found listed eight letters from Mr Bhotiva of the Polaires.
White Eagle Lodge historian Colum Hayward is working with Psypioneer in assessing the new
material.

DID YOU TRY OUR QUIZ?
Here are the answers to our quiz in the December 2009 issue of Psypioneer.
1. What was Percy Wilson told at lunch by Maurice Barbanell in 1941?
We reprinted in our January 2009 issue Percy Wilson’s recollection of this as
published in LIGHT. He was told that there had been a communication the night
before from a Barham survivor at a Duncan séance. We don’t know the date of
the séance or of the lunch. Dr Malcolm Gaskill comments “The first letter was
sent from the Admiralty to the next of kin on 6 December 1941—i.e. eleven days
after the sinking—asking that the news be kept secret ‘for the time being’ pending
an announcement. The second letter, releasing news of the sinking, was sent on 27
January 1942, the same day that the press were informed.”
We know from the published Liddell diary entry of 26 December that MI5 was
aware of the Barham séance by then, but was the Duncan séance before or after
the initial Admiralty letter of 6 December?
24
2. Who started the newspaper “Harbinger of Light”?
W.H. Terry. There is a good account of his work in Al Gabay’s study Messages
from Beyond: Spiritualism and Spiritualists in Melbourne’s Golden Age, 1870–
1890, (University of Melbourne Press, 2001).
3. What journal did Allan Kardec found?
La Revue Spirite in 1858. To be distinguished from La Revue Spiritualiste also
founded in 1858, by Z.J. Pierart.
4. Why was William Crookes obliged to repudiate a claim by Florence Marryat?
In the Annales des Sciences Psychiques for March, 1906, pp. 140-1 (English
edition, April, 1906, pp. 213-14) was published an alleged account by Sir William
Crookes of a very remarkable case of “dematerialization” witnessed by him with
the medium Florence Cook, when the materialised form of “Katie King” stood
with outstretched arms against the wall of the séance room, and in the light of
three gas burners, turned on to their full extent, melted away before the eyes of
the sitters, like a wax doll melting before a hot fire, till they were left staring at
the vacant spot where she had stood. Crookes denied this account “As far as I am
concerned there is not a word of truth in it. Nothing of the sort ever happened in
my presence, in my house or elsewhere.”
5. Who may have first mentioned Ectoplasm on the wireless?
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in “Psychic Developments”: a “wireless” lecture
delivered by him through the broadcasting station [i.e. BBC] on May 20th
, 1924
6. Who was Mr. Splitfoot?
Mr. Splitfoot was a popular New England nickname for the Devil. According to
Robert Dale Owen in his 1860 account of the Fox sisters in Footfalls on the
Boundary of Another World:
“Kate, the youngest girl, happened to remark that as often as her father shook the
window-sash the noises seemed to reply. Being a lively child, and in a measure
accustomed to what was going on, she turned to where the noise was, snapped her
fingers, and called out, ‘Here, old Splitfoot, do as I do !’ The knocking instantly
responded.”
7. How did Minnie Parsons go down in history?
She was arrested for fortune telling in Chicago in 1917, but was acquitted after
she produced a certificate from the Chicago Spiritualists League.
25
8. Who was the guide of the Conan Doyle home circle?
Pheneas.
9. How did Mr. Henry Diedrich Jencken take an irrevocable step?
On Saturday, December 14th
, 1872, Miss Kate .Fox was married to Mr. Henry
Diedrich Jencken, barrister-at-law, at the old parish church, Saint Marylebone,
London.
10. Why is a certain Curator’s blog of such importance?
This is the blog of Marc Demarest at www.ehbritten.org . It carries many important
discoveries about Mrs. Britten, and her husband William.
11. Who was the chief survival researcher of early American Spiritualism?
Robert Hare, who devised apparatus for his tests of mediums.
12 Who is the chief suspect for the greatly misleading Chicago account of the psychic
discovery of Jack the Ripper?
The estranged son of Robert James Lees, Norman Albert Lees.
