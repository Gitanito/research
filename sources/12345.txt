    Dear Dr. Long,     

    I saw your interview on TV a couple months ago and what you were saying made me decided to read your book.   

  I have not had a NDE but when our oldest daughter was born, we almost lost her. The medical staff tried everything and her health just keep getting worse. She was bleeding internally, she coded times and she had a stroke. She was a 7 lb 7 oz baby and nobody knew what was happening. They told us we should baptize her because they didn't think she would make it.   

  During the baptism, I was praying and pleading for the Lord to let us keep her.  Then a bright light came from behind me come, filled me with peace, and I knew that everything was going to be ok. Right when we were done, my daughter started coding again. I truly believe that was God restarting her life.  

  She was in the NICU for only 3 weeks. The doctors said they have never seen a baby get so sick so fast and better so fast. Her stroke affected the back of her brain. They told us she would probably never walk or talk. Yet, she started walking when she was 6 months old and she talks just like all of us.   

  When she was 2 months old she got sick again. The hospital again didn't know why she was so sick. The doctors contacted a specialist in the heart field who deals with rare disorders.  With his help, she was diagnosed with Congenital TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). There are only 150 to 200 cases worldwide. At 2 months old, she was the youngest patients to be diagnosed with the disorder.  Now she is 11 years old and doing amazing. She just got her 2nd degree black belt.   

  The reason I'm telling you all this is that day we had her, I truly believe I met the Lord. My husband doesn't like when I tell the story because he thinks I was just dealing with the trauma. When I heard you talking that day on TV it sounded alot like what I experienced that day. I know it's not a NDE but I felt alot of the same things. I remember I just wanted to stay in the light.   

  I just wanted thank you for writing the book and doing the study.      

    May the Lord bless you and your family always,     

    Shari
