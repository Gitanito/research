  		              		Experience Description   

    I was taking a bath, fell asleep and rolled over. Nothing felt different, sort of like I had knew that this would happen.

   I remember seeing more dark than light. I vividly remember seeing a lady who was wearing a dark robe. I'm trying to figure out how to best describe this. The robe had no colour. It was dark, yes.  But it was not black. Imagine a blackhole or void wrapped around you like a blanket. That what it looked like.  She had light brown hair, the same colour as caramel or peanut butter. I don't remember her face, because I am not sure that she had one.
  
   My parents found me. I could hear them saying my name from behind the other side of the door. Time was still, for myself anyways. That was all of the experience. The next thing I know is that I was on the ground, freezing cold. My parents were  in shock.
