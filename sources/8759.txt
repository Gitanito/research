  		              		Experience Description   

    I had an operation many years ago.  While I was being anesthetized and was supposed to breathe through a mask, I felt that I left my body. I  rushed at a terrible speed up through a lot of white ceilings.  I ducked my head because I thought I was going to bump into these ceilings.  It tickled my stomach as it was so intense.
  
  Suddenly, I was still.  I could see the planet earth far below with a blue corona.  I could look straight down into the operating room.  One person was standing on the right and two were on the left.  I wasn't interested in that.  I was much more surprised and amazed that I was  in outer space.  I thought:  It was supposed to be cold there with no oxygen.  I didn't notice anything else.  
  
  I looked at my arm and was really amazed. It was made of light with a little corona around it.  My whole body consisted of white light.  Everything consisted of a white light.  It was a body and then still it wasn't a body.  It isn't easy to explain.  I was thinking how beautiful it was.  I wasn't afraid, but was very, very amazed.  I looked out into space. It was dark, and I saw a white light getting close.  It was going so fast that I don't know if I was going toward the light or the light was coming toward me.  It was going really fast. 
  
  My experience ended here when I came into the light.  Later I thought it might be a dream that felt very alive. But many years later, I went flying for the first time.  We went through a lot of cloud layers, and my experience with 'white ceilings' came to mind.  On TV, I saw the planet earth from the outside and I saw this blue corona.  At that time I didn't think that's how it was.  It's been a very long time since then.  I got interested and started reading whatever I could find out about it.  To my surprise, there's a boy who talks about the same thing.  He came out into outer space.  I think about my experience quite a bit because it was wondrous and alive.  So many years have passed since then, of course, but it still is alive for me.  I think about how there must be a God.
