After just moving to the city, my partner and I went to meet some friends on their boat that was parked in the quay. After having a bit to drink, it was quite late.  My partner and I started arguing over something silly. He walked off the boat, so I followed him.  Everyone else stayed in the boat, carrying on with the party. As I stepped off the boat onto the wooden walkway, I started to run since I had lost sight of my partner.

What happened next was the strangest feeling I’ve ever felt. One minute I was running; the next minute everything just went really dark.  I didn't feel cold or even wet. I just felt like I was floating but sinking at the same time. Everything was pitch black, when all of a sudden I saw myself above me and a bit to the left. I was just staring. I looked so peaceful but I still had no idea what was happening or where I was. The next thing I knew I was laying on the wooden decking with everybody around me - soaking wet and freezing cold. My friends on the boat said that they had heard something and went to see what it was.  They found me floating on top of the water, my lips were blue, and I was unconscious. They had to bring me back round. After five minutes, I was absolutely fine like nothing had ever happened. Watching myself drown has always stayed with me and always will.
