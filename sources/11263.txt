  		              		Experience Description   

  I was having unexplained chest pain and tried to wait it out to see if it would go away.  The pain became so intense, that I had to go to the emergency room. The medical staff thought I was having a heart attack, so they gave me nitroglycerin and  then took an x-ray for definitive diagnosis. The Thoracic surgeon  informed me that I actually had a spontaneous pneumothorax. I was given no pain medication. He inserted a chest tube, punching through the rib cartilage. I was later told that my heart rate dropped to 3, and that is when I had an out-of-body experience.

   I saw the brightest light that is possible and was floating above my body that was on the operating table I could see everyone in the room. I remember praying to God not to take me and that I wasn't ready to die.  I remember begging God not to let me die. I do not remember how transitioned from floating above my body  or how the bright light sensation ended. 

I just remember the surgeon telling me later that he thought he had lost me and my heart rate dropped quickly.
