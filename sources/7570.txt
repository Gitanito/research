I tried to catch myself along the walls but someone (who looked like a nurse) pushed me away from them.  I suddenly felt a bright and very intense light around me, along with warmth and a feeling of love (like butterflies in my stomach, only a thousand times more intensive than like ‘being in love’). I felt peace, warmth and love like never before. I then woke up and there was a nurse sitting at my bedside, watching over me. I was paralyzed until the next day. I couldn't speak, but knew and heard everything - that part was a bit scary. It was all over the next day and I thought it had been a dream.  I never spoke about it until I read a similar experience 20 years later.

I still remember that and it helped me a lot when my husband died some weeks ago. I knew he was in a better place.
