A NEW SPIRITUAL AND OCCULT IN­
TERPRETATION OF THE TEACHINGS
OF JESUS AS FOUND IN THE GOS­
PELS, AND OTHER SOURCES.
Doreal
This interpretation of the FOUR
GOSPELS, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
is the answer to the crying need of the
Age for a comprehensive explanation of
the Teachings of Jesus. It gives the
TRUE teachings as they were originally
taught, and it explains away the many
versions due to interpolation, numerous
translations, and later attempts at re­
vision to fit special doctrines.
THE FOUR GOSPELS explains the "Mys­
teries" behind the sayings of Jesus,
The time is at hand for the "hidden
things" about the life of Jesus and his
Teachings to be made clear. The Secret
Teachings of Jesus need no longer remain
obscure. Dr. Doreal has so simply, and
clearly explained the Four Gospels that
anyone can perfectly understand the won­
derful message of Truth the Master Jesus
came to give.

When we embark upon the path of oc­
cult development and truth we find that
truth truly becomes a jewel of many facets
and that there are so many faoets the en­
tirety can hardly be learned in a life­
time .
There are a great many people who
want the deep things and yet when they
find them say it is too deep for them.
I suppose the teachers must do like the
Gautama Buddha did in his teaching, give
not too much and not too little. But it
is very hard sometimes to judge what is
too much and what too little, because a
lesson might be simple to one and deep
to another; so the teacher is confronted
with a difficult task, that is, to judge
just what people are ready for. It is
almost impossible to write a lesson and
make it suit all individuals. The occult
student always wants to know what he is
going to get when he takes a class, sel­
dom desiring to leave it to the teacher
to give him what he is ready for. If I
said I was going to give a class of four
lessons suitable to the development of
the 3tudent3- there would be little In­
terest shown, yet this is the way the
highest work is always given. If I Just
said that the lessons were fitted to the
- 3 -
consciousness of those who were present,
few would attend. The best lesson I have
ever given in my life have been given in
this manner because I was without any
restriction of subject matter. Each thing
was built upon the preceding topic, yet
I did not know until the moment I start­
ed to talk what I was going to give those
students. This is the manner in which
both the visible and invisible masters
teach.
When a student is called, or-meets
the masters, the master has not announced
to him previously what he is going to be
told. He comes to gain the knowledge of
the thing for which - he has opened him­
self. The invisible and visible masters
work, from a plane or planes of con­
sciousness wherein they can comprehend
the needs of the individual. They know
what each one can receive. I have at­
tended in one capacity or another thou­
sands of convocations, classes and meet­
ings, both in the material world and out
of the material world, wherein from ten
t6 ten thousand were gathered together
for the dispensation of truth, so that
truth could*be made manifest to them in
the degree that they could conceive and
comprehend; yet I have never seen any two
individuals in a class, regardless of
the smallness or largeness of the number
present,t
--whoever comprehended the truth
that was given to them, in the same fa*m
or image. You will always find that dif­
ferent ones have different things strike
upon them with the greatest fcrce because
that particular thing fitted with the
needs of their nature at that moment,
I have given talks, impersonal talks
where I talked in that manner and after­
wards I have had certain ones come to me
and say, HI know that you gave that talk
just for me," Why?- Because some one
thing in it was in accordance with some­
thing they knew they had not been doing
rightly, or correctly.
It is*an impossibility in the outer
world, excepting to the few, to give the
things that are -actually good and need­
ful for the student. Why? Because the
student wants the thing that he does.
The Ministers of’ our orthodox
churches are in exactly the same trouble.
I have known many of'them-and I would
discuss with them certain metaphysical
and occult things, and I would find that
they were in'accordance with those prin­
ciples, but' when I ask them why they
don't.teach them, they say, "the-people
won’t let me, 'because they have hot ac­
cepted it as truth, and I have to teach
according t6 their concept."
' • • ' f- • ; r <
3 v • v, . • J
. I have often wondered how many peo­
ple are truly on the path of truth,
whether they are searching out truth for
truths sake, ‘or whether they are merely
satisfying an abnormal'bump of curiosity.
They also have' a yearning -for the mys­
terious because they like to be pointed
out as one who is different.i-Many enter
into metaphysical work so that they can
be pointed out as such. ^You would be
- 5 -
surprised at .the percent of people who
do that. They are not true seekers on
the path. ! . .
There are others who like to enter
into a thing so that they can be dominant
in it; people of strong wills who find
it easy to dominate- the people they come
into contact with,
. : ‘ r , -
On the subjective side we find peo­
ple in occult or metaphysical work who
object to paying a certain, or definite
fixed fee, and ninety-nine percent of
those people are people with means 4 The
reason that they so believe, or say that
they believe, is that if they can keep
from paying a fixed fee they will very
probably give much more than if they gave
a fixed fee, but by so doing they make
the teacher dependant upon their charity,
and therefore exalt their ego.so that
they make themselves greater than the
teacher in their own subconscious, esti­
mation. People who have that, idea, that
concept, never make contact with either
the visible or invisible masters for the
reason that many times , that is one of
the tests that they have to pass. The
law of the Cosmos is one of compensation,
or exchange.- The great masters and
adepts are not dependant upon any person,
persons or thing, for their, manifesta­
tions or their teachings, but those same
great masters never place themselves
either In inferior or superior positions.
Neither will they allow themselves to be
brought into contact with or disseminate
the truth that they, have through the
- 6 r
channels that have such fixations or
ideas.

Many- people are searching for truth
and do not know what truth is when they
find it* Many people say, "truth is so
great that I cannot comprehend it; It is
just beyond my mind." The answer to that
is: enlarge your mind. Your mind does
not have to be incapable of comprehend­
ing all the forces and attributes o
f
. the
Divine Mind,
I never have had anyone complain
that I gave too little, but only that I
gave so much that they could not grasp
It all, but every word that I say to the
student, regardless of whether they con­
sciously accept it or not, because it is
truth, make a perfect, deep and lasting
impression upon their consciousness and
upon their subconscious mind, and later,
when the thing comes up again, or when
some problem in life comes up that that
law applies to, they find they have the
knowledge to meet it. But they have it
because they had been building up a sub­
conscious understanding which made it
possible for them to recognize the
things I have said, even though they
thought it had gone over their head.
■ . . . .. • ■ ♦
The idea of visible and invisible
masters is one which has been prevalent
in the world for centuries. The study of
metaphysics Is almost as old as civili­
zation, It began back in the dark ages
when man in this present cycle was Just
emerging from savagery, but always,
7
throughout, all ages, even when man was
in the depth of darkness there were cer­
tain great adepts of wisdom and power
who changed not from age to age, who had
been, and are, ( one with the Universal
Spirit, - or Divine Light, .
. We speak of
these ;
in two manners: one as invisible
ones-and one as visible,' Now the distinc­
tion is this:., the .great invisible masters
are those aspects cf .consciousness, those
egos, _who were- not..bound :by the inrush
of that force which we call negation,
when it came into manifestation in the
material planer: in the first cycle, when
man was a spiritual .being, manifest' in. a
body other than that of the animal body,
like unto those l:that,.we_-Tiow- call .invis-:

i When .that force which-we' call nega­
tion came in, f in the first' cycle, there
were certain: egos or souls that were not
in manifestation, in the material:, body.
Those egos, '.or souls were not affected
by that force of negation, and therefore
were not thrown from their primal "condi­
tion: of balance. They, still .had access
to all the. .planes of .
imanifestation of
the Divine Spirit, with perfect con­
sciousness Land understanding* ' They are
the ones whom we calli,
,
the- Children of
Light,""the Sons of-the Morning,or the
Invisible Ones, .They did not Incarnate
In the animal body of^man, -except In
periods, or ages,: very far apart. They
came into manifestation, brought into
such materialization by their own will
and power, for the purpose of. bringing
a new light to a new age.
They dwell on a plane apart from
the material world. In occult philosophy
this plane is called the ninth dimension.
The ninth dimension is actually the true
materiality of the Divine Essencea It
was in the form of a ninth dimensional
body that the first incarnation of 3oul
dwelt in the material body. They are the
inhabitants of the seven sacred, primal
planets which encircle the Great Central
Spiritual Sun. Those seven planets are
the true planets which are spoken of in
ancient astrology. They are the true
spiritual planets which the seven an­
cient earthly planets symbolize.d.
The Great Invisible Masters, in a
sense, act as guides and directors of
those Great Ones that we call the Great
White Lodge of earth, and other material
planets throughout the Cosmo3. They are
the guides of the entire White Lodge of
the Cosmos, as those whom we call Masters
are the guides of man’s efforts to .at­
tain light and freedom from the bondage
of darkness.
The great adepts, or masters, such
as Khoot Hoomi, Morya, Hilarion and oth­
ers are those we term visible masters,
though they are not as a rule visible to
our material world at large, but only to
those who have raised the^r consciousness
to the plane where- they can perceive
them; though it is.also true that from
- 9 -
time tb time they make' journeys through
the world, contacting and teaching those
that have made- themselves ready. It
might he only once in ten years that they
contact each student. That student then
has to work with what is given him, un­
til finally he can open himself to meet
them otherwise, for the great adepts of.
the White Lodge are always visible to
those who are able to recognize them and
know them.' They journey through the
world from time to time in this manner,
and from time to time bring a new tinder-
standing of light, of life and truth.
When the mission is fulfilled, which is
directed by the Great Council of the
White Lodge, the master withdraws from
earthly contacts, going back, not to the
invisible, but to the various places of
the White Lodge, He has a mission to
perform according to the direction that
is given.
In regard to our visible masters,
in the material plane, we have the idea
and concept of the visible masters as
being in most cases those that we call
men. The invisible masters are neither
men nor women in the accepted sense of
the term. Like Melchesideck, ’they are
without father or mother, without begin­
ning or end,’ neither masculine nor fem­
inine. In the first and perfect mani­
festation of soul, in that first form of
manifestation of soul, In that first
form of manifestation of the ninth di­
mensional body, the ego, or conscious­
ness, or ray of light from the Divine
Sun which manifested, was neither posi-
- 1 0 -
tive op negative, but both contained in
the one. That is, the ray 0/ soul-light
which came into manifestation in the
primal man was both positive and nega­
tive, therefore the soul which manifest­
ed in that form was both positive and
negative. It is for that reason that we
are told in the book cf Geneses that "God
created man in his own image, male and
female created he them," and, "through-
.out all the world was not found a help­
mate for Adam." Why? Because Adam was
self-contained; "and God oaused a deep
sleep to fall on Adam and took a rib •
from Adam and made Eve," and in that we
have the story of the inrush of negation
which was the deep sleep, and when man
entered the animal body the soul that
was equally balanced was manifest then
in division. This was the same soul di­
vided to form two parts: one positive
and one negative and therefore, mas­
culine and feminine.
. . * *.' c « >
» .
In oocult philosophy we are told
that the -force of attraction between man
and woman is nothing more or less than
the opposite polarities seeking to again
unite but that the perfect union of soul
is distorted by passing through the
screen of flesh and therefore the earth­
ly manifestation of sex 13 brought in as
a distortion. On this occult concept is
based all the teachings, throughout all
forms of occultism, philosophy and re­
ligion of twin souls - a truth which is
in a sense distorted because each mascu­
line and each negative soul-unit may have
attraction for each .other, because in
the source from which- they came, they
are all one,0 ° •

" The invisible masters never passed
through' this process- - of '
1 separation,
'therefore/- ’
they are neither masculine
nor feminine,: and1 ‘
not the two in one,
-but neither for they are -that source or
-light frDEi which the tw6 polarities come,
The'duad is one in the monad;" They are
such because they have ;
not entered three-­
dimensional material bodies,'
h r • n n ■ " •
{ n f ■ : . t
The visible masters -are those who
in the-beginning came into this division
of duality and- they may.-be^ e ither mascu­
line or -
feminine They travelled the
long road 0iof life, -throwing off sheath
after sheath of the'physical body, and
•perhaps have incarnated ten thousand or
a million times, . Ci -; :
•»r* v •
It is because -each portion of con­
sciousness is essentially positive or
negative, that, for’the most part they
-Incarnate in the body, or sex of which
they are a division, •excepting under the
following conditions: when a soul during
a lifetime has been disturbed by thoughts
or jealousy, that the opposite polarity
had an easier time, usually that 30ul
incarnates in the opposite sex for one
incarnation,- Not by chance have they in­
carnated in the other polarity of body,
but because of their -longing and desire,
or their will, or perhaps because of a
cause set up, they have to experience
the things in the opposite type of body.
That is the - reason that if you go back
- 1 2 -
in time you will find that you almost
always incarnate in the same 3ex.
.The reason I am bringing all this
in ia to show you the separation and
distinction between the great.adepts and
the manner in which they manifest. As
they pass along the long road of life,
gradually, they begin to conquer all the
manifestations of their own nature, be­
cause each soul, each aspect of soul,
masculine and feminine, have within
their nature the full and perfect crea­
tive power, and because the negative
pole of the positive soul, or positive
pole of the negative soul is not severed
at it3 souroe, but only in the world.
When the ray of soul-light, divided into
negative and positive, reaches its per­
fect state of balance, it does not con­
join with its opposite, but draws from
the s ource which is not divided, the
opposite principle, to bring about the
condition of balance in itself. Regard­
less of whether it was a woman or man
before, it occupies any body which it
desires, for it has taken on the condi­
tion of balance, and becomes neither
positive or negative, but both. For this
reasbn v
/
e do not refer to a master as
either man or woman but just as a master
- one in whom the two polarities have not
re-united, but one in whom the dual po­
larity has manifested. When this'occurs,
where the manifestation has reached this
stage, the incarnation as a divided soul
ceases and there i3 only the one incar­
nation, In other words, re-uniting, or
becoming one is reached by becoming, not
- 1 3 -
by joining, therefore^ we say a master
is neither woman or man, though if they
appear in masculine body we say man; if
they appear in the body of a woman, we
say woman but the soul is a dual or bal­
anced soul. •‘
i
- The reason in the past that great
adepts appeared more often as men than as
women was merely because man occupied a
more* commanding appearance in society
than a woman could, therefore, they man­
ifested in the masculine vehicle because
it was the one that they could carry out
their work more easily through,!

‘ of
SPIRITUAL 'MANIFESTATION
The nine zones shown in Chart One
are the seven zones or stages in which
man manifests, and the two higher zones
of the visible and invisible masters,
There are nine primary colors but only
the Great Adepts can perceive and utilize
the eighth and ninth. One of the first
signs of coming mastership is the per­
ception of previously unknown light and
color,

THE SEVEN SPIRITUAL PLANETS
AND THEIR RELATION TO COLOR ZONES, ;
An Adept works in the color zone
related t6 his Spiritual-Planet, There
are nine possible zones, but eight and
nine are zones of the masters, (See
Chart #1,) These zones represent seven
stages of mankind on earth today. There
are'men manifesting on earth in all of
the seven zones of development. Each of
the spiritual planets are, as it were, a
director of one zone of man's evolution.
If we say that three is the Spiritual
planet from which Morya and Khoot Hoomi
came we mean that their spiritual bodies
are manifest on that spiritual pldnet.
(See chart #2.) They are twin rays be­
cause being in harmony In the spiritual
plane, • they both manifest in the third
zone. One from a particular Spiritual
planet Would work in a related color zone
of evolution, or development. Each adept
who works among mankind has a zone given
to him to work in,
* There are 144 brothers of the White
Lodge working on this planet, though the
same zones hold true on other planets
also. To work in a zone, the ones from
a particular Spiritual planet may be
centered on one planet for a time. They
may then all be withdrawn from that zone
and set to work on another for a time.
They are shifted from place to place so
that during the course of ages they work
in all the zones, with various races of
people and different degrees of develop­
ment, Sometimes they have worked in the
eighth or ninth zone, and when they have
done that, and then change to work in a
lower zone it is Very hard to bring the

the legend of the Wandering Jew who has
lived since the time ,of Je3us but there
have been, from almost the most ancient
of historical times, legends and stories
of people who have walked the world for
ages - yet the greatest of all those
stories is not known to manj of a woman
over five million years old, a woman who
was born in the first cycle of earth, in
the first cycle of man.
■ , ./ r
« -»
In the latter part of it, in the
beginning of tie second cycle, this earth
was invaded by beings from 'the dark
planet X, whom we call the Xians.. One of
the properties of the tenth planet was
that all the negation-, of the negative
force which came into this Cosmos at the
fall of man was centered in the dark
planet. It has the power of absorbing,
instead of refracting light; it also has
the power of absorbing negative. When
negative manifested abnormally on that
;
planet, there came into being as a re­
sult of what we might literally call an
unholy union of negation and order, so
much disorder that it was dominant in
the nature of the inhabitants. In their
first coming to earth they controlled,
and ruled mankind. They overwhelmed and
conquered man in the latter part of the
•first age or cycle. They ruled mankind
from their condition of negation or dis­
order before they were imprisoned by the
Children of Light, who came to earth for
that purpose. They were imprisoned in
the center of the earth, but before that
time they had ruled mankind for thousands
of years. They caused themselves to be
20-
worshipped as Gods.

1 They" had as their intermediary a
woman, or . girl, who acted as *a high
priestess/ one who had because of cer­
tain things’
, in her own nature, become
somewhat harmonized with their negative
nature and she, as she remained close to
them, became more infused with their
negations"‘instead of manifesting the
positive.. Then she became immune to the
force that was -brought into ‘
manifesta­
tion - death, so ■that negation'could be
sheathed off, .Death'is a law of harmony
and'not of negation, and when the Xians
were imprisoned In the central earth, she
was left upon the earth for certain rea­
sons which I am not at liberty to dis­
close because' it has something in it of
the manner in which the invisible ones
hope,to manifest a condition of order in
the Xians, She-is the origin of- the
legend-of Lilith, who *in ancient symbol­
ism was called the first wife of Adam,
She has walked the earth since then, in
the form- of a beautiful woman, l
,and she
still walks the earth and wherever she
walks turmoil and negation manifest, be­
cause she feeds - on negation/ now, even-
aa she fed on it when she was an inter­
mediary between the Xians and mankind.
I want to talk to you about the four
aspects of soul as taught in the Kabbaia.
According to most of the ancient wisdom
teachings, the soul of man manifests in
four planes or aspects, 'In the Egyptian
religion we ‘are told of four aspects of
soul. First there was the :animal soul
- 21-
of the body which remained as a guardian
of the body in the tomb. Then there was
the messenger between the tomb, and
Amenti, and the soul which passed before
Osiris in the Halls of Amenti, but be­
yond this they still had a further as­
pect of soul, a soul which justified in
Osiris and weighed by Maat, the goddess
of truth, and found not wanting, was al­
lowed to pass through the heart of Os'iris
into that greater plane from whi ch the
soul comes. When the soul had passed
the double gates, and been perfectly
justified in Osiris, then that soul had
completed the circle of the wheel of
life, and was no longer bound to the
wheel of life. +.

‘ " • 7 • * r ,* ^ . |* ;
The Kabbala says that there is the
material or emotional soul : called Ne~
phesch* Then they say that there is
Ruach, the Creative soul, or soul of the
plane of formation. Then they say that
there Is the Neshemah, the soul of the
mental plane and above and beyond all
these is the Chiah, the Spiritual soul
from which the three lesser aspects of
soul emanate. They say that the soul of
man assumed, as it were, the form of a
triangle. That is, that the three les­
ser degrees or aspects of soul form a
triangle radiating from a center, and
that each of the qualities of 3oul re­
mains always in it3 own plane connected
only by a thin cord of light, the silver
cord of Ecclesiastes. The Silver Cord
is considered to be a thin thread of
force, light, energy, or consciousness
which connects the various aspects of
- 2 2 -
soul and by which they are separated in­
to their various planes cf manifestation,
We are told that the material soul
is the lowest aspect, and in a sense is
the controller of the emotional nature of
man. The true occultist recognizes that
the soul as manifest in the material body
is the emotional soul, the lowest aspect
or Nephesch. Some occultists, knowing
that m a n ’s inherent material nature is
emotional, because it is ruled by Neph-
esch, play upon that quality of soul,
never advancing it but forcing it deeper
into its manifestation. By thus b r i n g ­
ing the emotional nature, which is al ­
ready in manifestation, into control and
enhancing it they gain control of the
lower manifestation, the emotions. All
emotional religions play upon the Neph-
esch, because it is the first thing that
they can reach, the easiest thing, the
lowest aspect, the Nephesch, Instead of
bringing man closer to his higher as­
pects of soul, they more firmly fix him
away from his higher aspects of con­
sciousness ,
Chart #3, - on page twenty-five
shows the Neshemah, the Ruach, and Neph-
esch, the material. The Chiah is the
highest, or Spiritual soul. The Chiah
is not shown here because it is of the
highest* or invisible realm and we are
told that the three lowermost qualities
of soul co-ordinate and balance in m a ­
terial man, that man in the material has
the power to call into being the powers
of his mental soul, and the power of his
23-
creative soul, though because he is so
deeply.” immersed in his Nephesch', he is
bound and limited in his emotional na­
ture.
In the Old Testament it says, "my
Neshemah rejoiced." Here we find that
the old poet really said the mental as­
pect of my soul- rejoiced. They trans­
lated it as, "my soul rejoiced," instead
of showing what aspect of the soul re­
joiced, •and therefore, giving an under­
standing of the plane of rejoicing.
We are told, that these three as­
pects of 3oul are potentially capable of
manifesting in the material world; that
man has to pass through these three as­
pects of soul before■ he can reach the
Chiah, We are told that these four as­
pects of soul'are also symbolical of one
aspect of the Tetragrammaton, the Yod-He
-Vau-He. We.are told that the three as­
pects of Soul, coming down into manifes­
tation into tlie material soul, manifests
each its own nature,
• C- •-
First, Nephesch which is of the
emotional body, of the emotional world,
manifests one of the two angels which
are present in the life of every man
from birth to death: Mikael and Samael -
his good and evil angels, Samael was
the evil angel, the negative, the emo­
tional side of man, Man in the emotional
quality of his soul is swayed by that
emotion until he is not in control of
the things he does, and therefore Samael
is the manifestation of the emotional or

manifests in his Nephesch only, he can
never find his Neshemah. If one calls
on his good .angel* that is, exalts the
power of 1 Ruach, then : the connection
which is broken becomes solid and the
good angel manifests, to affect, to con­
trol* and to.repulse Samael.

emotional nature, then that aspect be­

Remember that Mikael and Samael are
only symbols j
, therefore, when the old
Kabbalist spoke uof the aspects of soul
in relationship to man he was really
giving man a ^ k e y •by which to live* He
was showing man how he'could exalt one
of his two manifest natures. If he called
his higher .nature, Ruach, into being
then he could call on Neshemah; he could
call unto the great will of the Divine
to bring into power the Chiah, but he
could not do it on the left hand path.
Therefore, one.of the things that the
student must do is this: push to one
side the things that appeal to his emo­
tional nature, and.call upon his powers
of reason and discrimination. Apply the
powers of analysis to it and when he
does so he begins to exercise the powers
of Mikael, and Ruach, and a great light
begins to dawn on him and he is shown
the path which Is the right hand path,
instead of the left hand path which
leads to destruction, <

are four planes of m a n ’s being
which should be considered in Spiritual
Healing; the physical, mental, psychic
and spiritual planes. It is for this
reason that when the healer has learned
how to operate on the four planes, he is
able to reach the cause and permanently
heal his patients.
A symptom may appear in the physical
which has its cause in any one or more
of these four planest The treating of
symptoms alone will not remove the cause,
(
i

n the cause is not eliminated, even
though the symptoms has disappeared, the
patient has not been really healed for
the same symptom or another may later
appear if the cause is allowed to r e m a i n .
POUR PLANE3 OF HEALING is a Textbook
for healers, It describes the Laws of
Healing; giving the methods for employing
them and cites a large number of ex­
amples which explains how they are to
be used, - gives the method for diagnos­
ing both the symptom and their causes -
and treatment for each.
This book may be used for self
treatment as well, A beginning student
may immediately practice It3 principles
and heal the sick. All students wishing
to heal either themselves, or others
should read thi3 book, *
