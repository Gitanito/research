Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian
Science Church, published the first edition of her
well known book, Science and Health, in 1875- |s
• a later edition she devotes an entire chapter—Chris­
tian Science versus Spiritualism —to attacking Spir­
itualism. She does not condemn other forms of
belief. Just why did she single out Spiritualism
for attack? There must have been some mental
complex which caused this.
M a ry B ak er w as born a t B ow , N . H . in 1821.
She w as thrice m arried. H er first husband w as
G eorge W ashington G lo ver, w hom she m arried in
1843. H e died six m onths a fter th e w edding, and
her on ly child, G eorge W ash in gton G lover, Jr., w as
born three m onths later. In 1853 she m arried D an ­
iel P atterson, a d en tist. H e deserted her in 1866,
and in 1873 she d ivorced him . In 1877 she m arried
A sa G ilb ert E d d y . H e died in 1882, and she sur­
vived un til 1910.
In her R etrospection & Introspection, M rs. E d d y
w rote, “ F or som e tw elve m onths, w hen I w as abou t
eigh t years old, I rep eated ly heard a voice, calling
m e d istin ctly b y nam e, th ree tim es, in an ascending
scale , . . T h is continued until I grew discouraged
. and m y m oth er w as perplexed and anxious.”
4
A s a child, M rs. E dd y w as subject to violent
seizures of epileptiform nature, in w hich she would
fall to the ground, sometimes kicking and screaming,
sometimes limp, sometimes cataleptic.
A fter G lover died her hysterical attack s became
worse, and she passed long periods in a state of
apparent collapse. D uring this period she w ent into
trances, in w hich she had w h at purported to be
visions of distant scenes and events. She was in­
terested in spiritualism, and heard “ rappings” at
night like the F ox sisters a t H ydesville, N . Y ., in
1848. W hen she married Patterson, her health was
such th at he had to carry his bride down stairs
and back again on her w edding day.
W ilbur, a very friendly biographer w ho defends
M rs. E dd y against the charge of spiritualism and
mediumship, adm its th at "she associated w ith Spir­
itualists for years, more or less; . . . A t tim es she
was even present at seances.” In describing one of
her seizures, while she w as living w ith Patterson,
W ilbur writes, " ‘I had the honor to take care of
M rs. E ddy once,’ said a very old wom an of G ro­
ton. ‘She was all alone in her hom e and I heard
her bell ringing. I w ent in and found her lying
rigid w ith foam on her lips. I brought her around
w ith cold w ater.’ ”
5
In the autum n of 1862, M rs. E ddy visited Phineas
Quim by at Portland, M e., and took his treatment
for her disorder. Quim by had been a professional
mesmerist, and he used spiritualist clairvoyance
for diagnosis. H e cam e to the conclusion that cures
were caused b y the patient’s faith and confidence
in the doctor. He worked out a doctrine of mind-
cure which was put in writings, which were later
published under the title of “ The Quim by M anu­
scripts," edited b y H oratio W . Dresser. T hey refer
to his theory as “ T h e Science of Christ” and
“ Christian Science.” M rs. E ddy returned home,
seem ingly entirely cured. B ut she was later plagued
b y her disorder, and wrote Quim by for absent treat­
ment.
W hile in Portland, she m et M rs. Sarah Crosby,
one of Q uim by’s other patients, who was a spir­
itualist. In M ay, 1864 she visited Mrs. Crosby at
Albion, M e. M rs. C rosby made an affidavit of the
incidents of this visit, and it is outlined in “ Life
of M ary Baker G . E ddy and the History of Chris­
tian Science” b y Georgine Milmine, published ser­
ially in M cC lure’s M agazine in 1906-8, and in book
form in 1909 b y D oubleday, Page & Co. (Dakin,
in his “ M rs. E d d y,” says, “ This book is composed
o f the articles published originally by Miss Milmine
6
in M cC lure’s M agazine, w ith revisions and addi­
tions . . . T h e copyright was even tually purchased
b y a friend of Christian Science, and the plates
from which the book was printed were destroyed,
according to information which appears to be auth­
entic and accurate. A s a result, this m ost valuable
source-book has become exceedingly rare.” ) From
Mrs. C rosby’s affidavit it appears th at she and Mrs.
E ddy indulged in spirit com m unications from Mrs.
E d d y’s deceased brother, A lbert. M rs. E dd y told
M rs. Crosby that A lbert w as the latter’s guardian
spirit, and M rs. E ddy w as “ his only earth ly me­
dium .” Mrs. E ddy w ent into trances and delivered
messages from Albert. A fter going home, she sent
Mrs. Crosby a com m unication from A lbert.
Patterson and his wife m oved to L ynn, M ass.,
in 1864, where he practiced dentistry. H e deserted
her there in 1866, whereupon she resumed the name
of Glover, and went to board at the house of Mrs.
George D. C lark on Sum m er S t., and returned
there in later years. M rs. C lark w as a spiritualist.
Seances were held at her house and M rs. E ddy
sometimes attended. Powell, in his biography, pub­
lishes a seating list of the fourteen at M rs. C lark ’s
table and comments, " I f there were not, in that
friendly circle, any fisher folk, as am ong the tw elve
7
who surrounded Jesus, em phatically there were nine­
teenth century equivalents— workers in the Lynn
shoe factories, salesmen in shoe stores, a painter,
and a team ster.”
A t Mrs. E ddy’s left sat Hiram Crafts. He was
a shoe factory worker and a spiritualist. He lis­
tened to her Quim byism and became her first pupil
to go into practice. In the spring of 1867, M r. and
M rs. C rafts, w ith Mrs. Eddy, went to Taunton
where he opened a healing office.
A fter this, Mrs. E ddy went, as a complete strang­
er, to the home of Mrs. M ary Esther Carter, a
spiritualist, in Am esbury, but failed to become a
guest. She then visited w ith elderly Mrs. N athan­
iel W ebster of Am esbury. She was a drawing and
healing medium and had a seance room. "These
two wom en,” writes W ilbur, “ were placidly content
together. If ‘M other’ W ebster was inclined to dis­
cuss spiritualistic ‘Phenomena’ this was no new ex­
perience for M ary Baker.” M rs. Eddy spent
months there, and was asked to leave. From there
she w ent directly to visit w ith Sarah Bagley, of
Am esbury, another spiritualist.
In the July 4, 1868 issue of the Banner of Light,
the official organ of the New England spiritualists,
Mrs. Eddy inserted an advertisement, intermingled

Mrs. Eddy inserted the second of the above advertisements in the
July 4, 1868 issue of the Banner of Light, the official journal of the
New England spiritualists.
Because her second husband, Dr. Patterson, whom she later di­
vorced, had deserted her, she was then using the name of her deceased
hist husband, Glover. She was then living in the home of the Websters
in Amesbury, and the number of the Webster post office bos was 6x.
Mrs. Eddy had been familiar with this spiritualist journal for
years, and later she even mentioned the B anner of Light by name at
page 75 in the first edition of her Science and H ealth.

w ith those of clairvoyants, offering “ instruction
th at will enable them (pupils) to commence heal­
ing . . . N o paym ent is required unless this skill
is obtained. Address M rs. M ary B. Glover, Ames-
bury, M ass., B ox 61.”
For about tw o years, from 1868 to 1870, Mrs.
E dd y lived as a guest w ith M rs. Sally W entworth,
another spiritualist.
In 1870 she returned to Lynn with a youthful
pupil nam ed Richard Kennedy, and took offices.
K ennedy did the healing and she organized classes.
H er fees at first were $100. for tw enty lessons;
b u t she raised this to $300. for seven lessons.
A fter her break-up w ith Kennedy, she continued
to frequent circles. M ilm ine writes that M rs. Rich­
ard H azeltine of L ynn swore in an affidavit as
follows:— “ I distinctly remember meeting Mrs.
M ary G lover a t these spiritualistic meetings in
w hich she frequently took part as a medium. It
w as in 1871 and 1872 as nearly as I can remember
the date, th at M rs. G lover acted as the chief
spiritualistic medium in a circle which met at the
home of a M rs. C lark in Summer St., Lynn. M y
husband, Richard H azeltine, and I went to the
circles a t M rs. C lark’s and saw M rs Glover pass
into the trance state, and heard her communicate
1 0
by word of mouth messages received from the spirit
world, or what she said and we believed were mes­
sages from the spirit world. . . . ”
In 1875 she bought a house in Lynn, where she
completed the first edition of Science & Health. In
Boston she founded the "Church of Christ, Scien­
tist,” in 1879, and the Massachusetts Metaphysical
College in 1881. The latter was a financial success
inasmuch as it received 4000 students in seven
years.
Dr. Carl A. Wickland wrote in one of his books
in 1934, “The fact that Mrs. Eddy was a medium
has been abundantly proven and there are still per­
sons living who affirm that they not only witnessed,
but also assisted in, Mrs. Eddy’s psychic work as
a medium. Among our correspondents is a man
who attended Mrs. Eddy’s mediumistic work for
the period of some three years. Many others have
informed us that they had personally known Mrs.
Eddy as a medium. We ourselves have seen a clip-
ing from a Boston paper wherein Mrs. Eddy ad­
vertised herself as a medium, giving readings at
fifty cents a sitting.”
Such is the record of some of Mrs. Eddy’s spir­
itualistic and mediumistic adventures over a per­
iod of years. Nevertheless, in 1878 when she pub­
11
lished th e second edition of her Science and H ealth,
she w ro te a t page 166: “ . . . we were never a Spir­
itualist; and never were, and never could be, and
never admitted that we were a medium . . . and I am
not a m edium .”
O ne does n ot d en y unless one has been accused.
It seem s p re tty ob viou s th a t, when her first edition
appeared in 1875, her m an y N ew E ngland spir­
itu a list cronies lifted their eyebrow s and said, “ Why,
that’s M rs. E ddy who sat with us as our medium
m any a tim el” T h a t sort o f ta lk would never do.
I t m igh t w reck her new m ovem ent. In her second
ed ition she m ade th e above em phatic and unequiv­
ocal d e n ia l; and in later editions devoted an entire
ch ap ter to a tta ck in g spiritualism . A s the Queen,
in H am let, rem arked, “ The lady doth protest too
much, m ethinks."

D u rin g the years 1918, 1919, and 1922, after her
death, M rs. E d d y transm itted four psychic com ­
m unications through the trance medium, Anna
W ickland . T h ese com m unications were recorded
stenograph ically and are reported in Dr. W ickland's
book, published in 1924. T h e following are some
passages from them .
12
"I went into spiritualism first, and found th at it
was much better than orthodoxy, so I followed it
for some years, but I felt that I could not get very
far w ith it.”
“ I had a vision, and I saw how they treated pa­
tients in the other world . . . T h ey were teaching
the spirits th at there is no such thing as m atter.
T h ey said, ‘Forget it, it is only im agination. Y ou
are not sick, you ju st im agine it. T h at belongs to
m atter. T h at is only your m ortal m ind' . . . I
thought that this vision m eant th at I was to
teach that on earth, and I set to work. N ow I
see m y m istake, because there is m atter, and so
long as you live on the m aterial plane you will
have to recognize m atter. W hen you reach the
spirit side of life your mind has to be taught to
overcome m atter, not cling to it, because spirits in
darkness are clinging to m atter as m uch as we cling
to m atter when w e have our physical bodies . . . I
was so misunderstood, because I could not m yself
explain w hy m atter was n ot.”
“ I knew about the wonderful truth of life beyond.
I knew it well in life, but . . . I w anted a religion
of m y own. Spiritualism belonged to past days.
I wanted som ething new, som ething higher, some­
thing better than spirit return." “ I w as a trance
13
medium and I gave readings, but I must confess
I felt th at it w as too common . . . I found that spir­
itualism would not reach the people I wanted to
reach, so I took Q uim by’s doctrine, and also, as I
told you previously, the vision I had of mortal
mind in the spirit world, and I combined the two.”
“ W hen I passed to the spirit side of life, it was
in one w a y surprising to me, because I had concen­
trated th at I should live forever . . . I took it
literally . . . N ow I can see how ridiculous the
thing w as . . . In m y visions I had been to the
spirit world m any tim es and had always returned
to earth. T h is tim e I felt th at I could go back
again, but m y body was not there. It had been
interred. Still I did not realize the change because
I had closed the door for spirit return. I did not
w ant to teach it. I knew it, because I was a me­
dium in m y early days. I gave readings in Boston
for some tim e, and I gave lectures as well, but after
a while I denied it all— the truth was not in me.
W hen I w oke up in m y spirit body I still did not
realize th at it was not m y material body. It was
hard for me to understand that I had gone through
the change called death, because I had concentrated
th at I should never die. T h a t realization took much
tim e. T hen I had much to do, and many difii-
14
culties to overcome. First of all came m y brother
Albert . . . and told me th at I had not taught the
whole truth. There was a time when I was a m e­
dium and he talked through me, but after a while
I refused to allow this. N ow he cafne again and
said, ‘Come, I will show you that w hat you taught
is not true, and that you did not tell the tru th .’
A fter a while m y first husband cam e. He under­
stood me better than the rest. He showed me the
w ay. One b y one m any friends cam e. T hen cam e
Quim by. He said, ‘Y ou took m y theory. W h y did
you not give me a little credit for the help I gave
you?’ Then I saw how selfish I had been. I was
accused. I was helped, but I had not given credit
for it . . . Quim by helped me . . . and taugh t me
. . . A fter he had gone I took his theory as m y
own. In the spirit world I had to go through a
great deal to overcome selfishness, i had to serve
and learn the lessons of life like a little child.”
“ M y people read and read, and the m ajority
come over here w ithout any understanding. I
closed the door for m y people and it is hard.” “ So
long as m y people are in the m ortal body th ey are
all right, but once the body is lost things go round
and round.” “ M y people are especially fixed be­
cause everything w ith them outside of them selves
\
15
is m ortal mind and their own mind is Infinite.”
“ For them there is no spirit world, it is all In­
finite. I tau gh t them to close the door to the spirit
world, and I taugh t them to read only my books.
I w anted a religion of m y own.”
“ D uring the last of m y days I was not myself
v e ry m uch. A ll through m y life I was back and
forth on the invisible plane. You know I was a
psychic and I could have been a- very good one,
and have done more good to the world through my
psychic power than I did . . . If I had used my
psychic power I could have helped thousands."
“ I w ant to be helped. M y people come to me
and w ant help, and I need help myself. They cling
to me and hold me dow n." “ Here are my followers
com ing to me one b y one. E very day there are
some com ing over to the spirit side of life, and I
am tryin g to tell them of the beautiful spirit world.
B u t th ey say, ‘N o, you are not Mrs. Eddy because
she did not teach th at when she was on earth. You
are only a false person,’ and then they go away.
Y o u see w hat I have to deal with, and I cannot
progress until I can help all these to open their
eyes.”
“ W h at is m y spiritual body now? It is in a very
crippled condition because m y mind was so closed
16
and I denied the tru th .” "W e should not deny
G od’s wonderful m anifestation of m atter. It is real,
not im agination. Y o u could not live w ithout mat­
ter. Y ou could not have m anifestations without
m atter. I denied the wonderful m anifestation of
m atter and called it only im agination and error . .
I denied God b y denying m atter . . . I have m y
eyes open now. I wish I could com e back to teach
the wonders we can do to help hum anity and the
spirits th at are in the darkness. I am there myself.
I have to serve for w hat I have done . . . I wanted
to keep the people under m y control, and I did.
I am now suffering for w h at I d id . . . L et us a ll. . .
w ork together to spread the tru th of the life here­
after, and also to help the earthbound spirits. Do
not cast them aw ay and say th ey are devils. T hey
are only ignorant spirits— like m yself. I wanted to
be som ething in the w orld.”
