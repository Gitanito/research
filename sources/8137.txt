  		              		Experience Description   

    I was knocked off a sailboat and drowned. Later, I learned  that I was brought back on the boat, was clinically dead for at least several minutes, and then revived.
  
  I remember my experience while clinically dead as longer than a few minutes.  I immediately went through a long tunnel with a light at the other side. I felt like I was walking through the tunnel without feeling my feet on the ground, walking quickly, and there were others walking with me. They mostly walked single file,  but at least two other people walked together side by side. 
  
  When I emerged on the other side of the light, it reminded me of a warm summer day that was very sunny; after a day where the colors of the sky,  earth,  trees, and flowers were very vivid. They were radiating with the moisture that came off the ground, only more vividly than I ever remembered before.  It was an open field with flowers as bright as poppies where  everything was painted because all was  so vivid.  There were other people running through the field with me. We exchanged glances as we ran forward.  Almost all of these people  were elderly but were walking like they were much younger. Some people looked quite sickly, but revived.  There was one very young African American girl with braids in her hair who looked very sickly. She was the only younger person, other than myself, who looked lost.  An older lady took the girl's hand and led her forward.  I felt I heard music and felt that as I moved forward that I'd be moving forward toward more people.  Some other older guy had a dog run toward him.  That was the only animal I saw.  It seemed like they knew each other.
  
  Then the light suddenly faded as the colors faded wjem  I felt like I was moving backward through the tunnel.
  
  Thinking about it later, I realized this was more than a dream because I remembered very specifically the features of the faces of the people I saw, especially that elderly lady with the little girl. These were faces that I had never seen before and have never seen again.
