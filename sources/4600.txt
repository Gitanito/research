  The numerous places of publication listed reflect only the locations of contributors; the journal was published in Paris.  This was a  Catholic devotional journal devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The devotion to the Sacred  Heart is usually said to have begun with the visions of Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647-1690) at Paray-le-Monial in France, but antedates that appearance, as the journal noted, by at least 600 years.  The journal is included here because Rene Guenon published 19 important articles on the concordance of Christian and universal symbolism in it from August-September 1925 to May 1927, and the journal contained numerous contributions along the same lines by Guenon's friend Louis Charbonneau-Lassy, who had introduced Guenon to Anizan.  The journal ceased in 1929 over disputes on theology, devotion and occultism, with Charbonneau-Lassy continuing what he considered the intellectual side of the endeavor as Le Rayonnement intellectuel while the devotional aspect was continued in Revue Universelle du Sacre-Coeur.
