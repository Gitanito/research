I opened my eyes and just in front of me and above, I saw little lights moving from left to right like they were following each other. I remember being curious about them, but watching them made me even sleepier than ever. I closed my eyes again, but then looked up higher because I heard a voice. I saw the underneath part of a chin, a babushka (scarf) tied there. It was white with big black dots on it. I thought 'Mom' was holding me, is all I can tell you. I closed my eyes again then tried to watch those moving lights again. My entire body felt spent, weak, drained. I could not fight it anymore and closed my eyes. 

I felt a very quick 'whoosh!' and suddenly I was floating at the top of the car ceiling in the backseat behind my Dad's head!! I saw his silhouette shape, his back to me. I saw the very bright dashboard lights. I saw over in the passenger seat, 'Mom' with that scarf on her head. It was night. I realized I was floating and I looked down at my 'floating' self, but there was NO BODY there. I could 'FEEL' everything around me: FEEL IT!! From my Dad was tremendous fear that he was fighting, so he could drive. From 'Mom' I felt some fear but her focus was on Dad and not wanting HIM to be upset. 

Then I saw THROUGH the seats of the car. It was an early 50s model car, the seats split, yes, but no room to see between them. Split, so people could push them forward to let kids in the back seat. But I saw right through them; saw a bundle on my 'Mom's' lap. It was me, but I did not know it at the time. My head was toward the driver, my feet pointing at the passenger door. I heard my 'Mom' say something in a very anxious fearful voice. I saw her looking down at the bundle in her lap. Dad turned the wheel to the right and I saw him lean over to the bundle.

That's when I felt another 'whoosh' sensation. Everything went black in that instant, and in the same instant I felt HEAVY, weak, tired, drained again. I opened my eyes and saw my Dad's upside down face staring into mine. Then I remember nothing more of this. I carried this, for lack of a better word, VIDEO, in me and eventually dismissed it, not knowing what it was. 

In the late 1970s, as a young adult, I was visiting my oldest sister (9 years older than I) at her house one day. As usual, we talked of all kinds of things. She asked me if she ever told me about how I 'almost' died when I was a baby. Surprised, I said ‘NO! Tell me!’ Here is what she told me: 

Mom had gotten the FLU and was in bed recovering from it. She had given it to me and I was very, very ill. My Dad came home from work and went in to check on me. I was listless, big dark circles under my eyes, eyes sunken, feverish, not eating, not crying. He immediately told her (my sister) to get me dressed. He needed her to hold me while he drove me to the hospital. THAT is when I interrupted her and told her WHAT she was wearing, the babushka on her head, and the design. She dismissed what I said and continued to tell me that while she was holding me on the way to the hospital, I was barely breathing. I closed my eyes and she felt me get heavier. She suddenly felt I had died and said to Dad, ‘Dad!! I think she's GONE!!’ Dad pulled the car over and leaned over to check me, he was so scared. That's when I opened my eyes and Dad let out a huge sigh of relief. He got me to the hospital and the doctors told him that it was nothing short of a miracle that I was still alive. 

This was only the FIRST TIME I had a NDE!!! There is so much I need to tell SOME ONE who will believe me. My entire life I have had profound experiences, but who do I tell?? There are truly only two reasons why I could remember anything at that age.  1.) I was supposed to remember it, meaning I believe God had a definite purpose for it. It would play an extremely important part in how I would grow up to be. He already knew I would have to get through my childhood, which was not going to be easy. So much was going to happen and I would need to be strong.  He was going to show me things, which I may not understand at first or even for quite a while!  Only later in life would it make sense to me.  2.) I believe I did stop breathing and I left my body, which was forever imprinted on me.

Such an occurrence is major! How could a person not store such things, when you actually know what it's like when you die and the eternal part of you, your soul, is freed? To be weightless and peaceful and so aware of every detail around you! It seems so unreal, but it happened.  The frustrating part is that I wanted to tell people, I wanted them to know it as I know it.  Because if they do know what death is, they would not be afraid to go when their time comes. Or when a loved one dies and the heartache is too much, they can gain great peace within, knowing that the truest part of them did not die, but lives on, just not in this realm.

                  		Experience Description 8294:   

  This is from my journal - 

  In the 1950s, a baby girl was born to a man and wife who already had 4 children. The husband was a hard-core, 'old world' kind of man who loved his children. The wife loved sex with her husband, but not the consequences of becoming pregnant. The wife, being resentful of being burdened, yet again, with a baby. She brought the baby home and immediately gave complete responsibility for the baby girl's care over to her nine year old sister. The child was charged  with an adult responsibility. Soon after giving birth, the mother came down with the flu. As she recovered, the baby girl  had also contracted this flu. She lay in her crib, burning up with fever. Her eyes were sunken in and she was severely dehydrated and near death. 

  No one bothered to check on the baby until her  father came home from work. In a  panic, he told the oldest 9 year old daughter to get the baby dressed. She held her baby sister while the father drove as fast as he could to the emergency room. What happened on the way, that dark night, is what the baby experienced. She was 6 weeks old. 

  Darkness. She opened her eyes. She thought she was on the lap of  her mother. She lay with her feet pointing towards the passenger door. When she opened her eyes, a little row of lights were moving from left to right and danced across her eyes just above her line of sight. The baby thought, 'what IS THAT?' More lights came. Again, the lights were moving  left to right. The lights fascinated the baby, but watching them made her so sleepy. She closed her eyes, unable to keep them open. She opened her eyes again and turned her face upward. Her  mother's chin was directly above her. She saw that her mother  was wearing a head scarf that was  tied in a knot underneath her chin. It was a white or light-colored scarf with big dark polka dots on it. The baby felt so weak, so tired and drained. She could not look for long and soon closed her eyes again. 

  This time, something happened. The baby girl opened her eyes and found she was floating up, near the ceiling. She was in the darkness of the backseat directly behind her father's head as he drove the car. The baby saw the bright dashboard lights. They were  so bright that they almost blinded her. She instinctively looked down at herself but did not see the rest of her body. It was as if she were somehow invisible. She saw a person, who she was sure was her mother, sitting in the front passenger seat. She also saw right through the seat that her mother was holding something on her lap. Then the baby started 'feeling' all the emotions that people in the car were feeling. Her father was very afraid and panicking inside. He was filled with urgency,  very upset, and overwhelmed. While the emotions coming from her sister, who she thought was her mom, were far more subdued. The mom felt no urgency, no fear, and not much of anything  except worrying about the father. 

  Then the baby heard the mom say something that affected the father. He jerked his head over and turned the big steering wheel to the right. Then he leaned over to examine the bundle on the mom's lap by reaching his arm up to it. That's when the baby felt a big WHOOSH. Then she felt an absolute heaviness, with heat pulsating throughout her body. Then there was  darkness.   She opened her eyes and saw her father's face directly above hers, upside down. His eyes were wide open. 

  After that, the baby stopped remembering any of the event. Years later, as a young adult, the older sister began to tell of what happened that night many years before. The now-grown baby girl's eyes flew wide open  and she gave her older sister the details. The older sister did not want to believe her and dismissed it. She asked her what happened at the hospital. It turns out that the emergency doctors ALL told her and the father that it was a miracle the baby was still alive. She had gotten to the emergency room just in time.   That baby girl? She was me. 

Two years later, I had another NDE.  Only THAT time, I saw my guardian Angel who communicated with me.
