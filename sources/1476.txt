A new note at PN
_________
Susan Farrow, whose appointment as editor of Psychic News was announced in the
issue of February 9 2008, has a distinguished career in music1
.
She is already known to readers of the Zerdin Fellowship Buzz Sheet for her keen
interest in physical mediumship.
Immediately after the SNU acquired PN in 1995, Julie Stretton became editor, to be
succeeded by Lyn Guest de Swarte. It was on Lyn’s watch that the Psychic Pioneer
project began. She warmly supported it, putting the web site on the free list for PN,
and participating in joint competitions when Psypioneer pamphlets were issued (the
question in the Stainton Moses one was the name of his personal guide - no, it was not
Imperator!)
Under the next PN editor, when the Psypioneer project morphed into a monthly free
electronic newsletter, Psypioneer was never mentioned in Psychic News except in the
correspondence columns. None our stories were ever followed up and we were never
interviewed, although ours was a venture originally seeded by Spiritual Truth
Foundation. However it was true that we were and still are the world’s smallest
Spiritualist newspaper, and much of our news was a century old. We were comforted
by other indications of seed on fertile ground - a student citing an article from us in an
1

26
essay, a don recommending us to a postgrad student, sympathetic interest from
authors, parapsychologists, librarians and from those just glad to see the old workers
remembered, often in their own words. We were also able to tell prospective
subscribers that the news we carried could not be read elsewhere!
But this is not an ideal situation. There is much scope for working more closely
together, and we are hopeful that this will now come to pass.

__________________________________
Is Mrs Duncan the victim of a logical fallacy?
- a tutorial note.
Our texts are taken from Psychic News, February 9, 2008, beginning to read on page
1.
“The Fraudulent Mediums Act was a hard-won piece of legislation. In 1944,
materialisation medium Helen Duncan was convicted under the Witchcraft Act of
1735, for no greater crime than that of demonstrating the continuity of life.
Spiritualists (and others) were outraged. Pressure from many quarters was brought to
bear upon the government of the day. Result- the Fraudulent Mediums Act, 1951.”
And again we read on page 2 in the same issue of
“…the Fraudulent Mediums Act – a piece of legislation which resulted from the high
profile and traumatic trial of Helen Duncan.”
Is it possible that we have here an example of the ancient logical fallacy “Post hoc
ergo propter hoc”, that is to say, the false conclusion that because one event follows
another, it is caused by it?
There is also the tendency for famous names to become associated with big events.
We have previously noted in our June 2006 issue how the name of Winston Churchill
is today associated on the Internet with this 1951 legal change (which actually took
place under a government of a different political party). Spiritualists, chiefly over-
enthusiastic supporters of Mrs Duncan, (the Duncanistas as we may call them) are
responsible for this confusion.
Similarly, the name of Mrs Duncan, now the most famous medium of the last century,
has become associated with the 1951 legal change. No evidence needs to be produced
in making this claim - it suffices that one event followed the other, therefore it caused
it.
27
The full story of the change in the law in 1951 and the long campaign leading up to it
has never been told - it would make a good subject for a Ph.D, as many surviving
papers must now be in the Public Record Office. The campaign lasted many decades.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s last public act was to lead a delegation to the Home
Secretary pressing for a change in the law in 1930. It was a campaign by and for
Spiritualists and mediums, most of them ordinary people, seeking religious freedom.
The Spiritualist National Union played a long and honourable part in it. Although, as
we noted in our June 2006 issue, money from the SNU Freedom Fund was used in the
defence of Mrs Duncan, her case was really a diversion, and possibly a hindrance to
the main campaign. (Indeed, it led to the reactivation of the Witchcraft Act against
mediums from 1945-50.)
Did Mrs Duncan play any part in the campaign for a legal change? Granted, if you
will, she was not a public speaker, did she sit on the platform of any meetings, sign
any petitions, join any lobbies or donate any money?
Was her name mentioned in the parliamentary debates leading up to the legal change
in 1951? Did her case influence in any way the wording of the draft bill which
eventually became law?
Did writers at the time, or then SNU leaders say “This change results from the
Duncan case”? or “We owe this Act to the Duncan Case”?
If pressure was brought upon the government of the day after the Duncan case in 1944
(and it was) why did the triumphant and radical Labour government of 1945-50 resist
the legalisation of mediumship? Why was it not until the precarious Labour
government of 1950-51 that the private members bill, with Labour government
support, was permitted to pass through Parliament? Was it Herbert Morrison, the
Labour politician who was antagonistic to Spiritualism, who long blocked the change?
We do not foreclose discussion on any of these questions. On the contrary, we are part
of the contemporary community of historians into Spiritualism who are regularly
finding and publishing new evidence. Although we offer a hypothesis “Mrs Duncan
had nothing to do with the 1951 legal change, which was the result of a long
campaign by all Spiritualist bodies” we expect our readers to try to falsify this with
new evidence. In this way, scholarship proceeds.
Finally, a general observation. It is sometimes suggested that too great an interest in
Glastonbury leads to the balance of the mind being disturbed. It is known that
spending time in Jerusalem can lead some pilgrims to a breakdown. In the same way,
involvement with the Duncan case can lead writers to abandon their normal caution.
How else to explain that in the last 18 months not one but four complaints have been
upheld against BBC History web site and BBC News for false statements about the
Duncan case. If so eminent an institution as the BBC can be led into fantasy, it
behoves the rest of us to be cautious.

ALFRED VOUT PETERS
1867 - 1934
Alfred Vout Peters was credited for outstanding trance mediumship, clairvoyance and
psychometry, and he was the first spiritualist medium in 1903 to demonstrate ‘Public
Clairvoyance’ in Holland. He traveled extensively, promoting Spiritualism in most
European countries until his death on Saturday, March 31st
1934 at Longton,
Staffordshire, aged 67.
His first séance and the emergence of his trance mediumship took place on Sunday
17th
March 1895; his public mediumship was to begin three years later in 1898 with
his guide/control Moonstone.
However we shall see below that his beginnings in the psychic field began much
earlier.
Whilst giving a lecture at the ‘British College of Psychic Science’ on Wednesday
15th
March 1922 under the chairmanship of Mrs. Hewat McKenzie, Peters, on
speaking on his beginnings, spoke of:- ……. extraordinary powers of hearing, seeing
and “sensing” as a child, which were quite normal to him, but which he speedily
found were foreign to others. These powers seemed to leave him for a time, but later
returned in the form of clairvoyance which manifested first during attendance at a
Friends' meeting, and was often repeated. Only later did he touch what was called
Spiritualism, and connected his own experiences with it.
Later in the same lecture2
he made this interesting remark: -
Many questions followed, one extremely interesting one being in what country Mr.
Peters thought that he obtained the best results. The answer was Scotland, where it
was comparatively easy both for himself and other clairvoyants to get first and second
names in public meetings. The reason for this Mr. Peters could not give, although
various theories have been suggested. Denmark and Russia also gave excellent
conditions.
At some point before 1923, Vout Peters became a member of the Theosophical
Society.
In 1898, while in London, Peters was controlled by another medium who was in Paris;
this occurrence happening on five separate occasions! He also witnessed evidence of
this with the physical medium Cecil Husk, whereby a friend of Peters materialised at
a Husk séance but was still very much alive. These experiences may well have
directed Peters towards Theosophy!
He was also strongly featured with the medium Mrs. Leonard in Sir Oliver J.
Lodge’s famous book Raymond or Life and Death first published 2nd
November
2
LIGHT March 25, 1922 page 187
29
1916. It is here on September 27th
1915, that Peters first sat anonymously 3
with
Lady Lodge and it was on this first sitting the famous ‘Group Photograph’4
came to
light.
Later in 1927 Peters participated in another historic event ‘Joanna Southcott’s Box’5
as managed by Harry Price. Peters was one of the psychometrists (others included
Mrs Cannock, Mrs. Eileen Garrett and Mrs Cantlon) who tried to discern its
contents before the contents were known. On the morning of May 5th
1927 at the
National Laboratory of Psychical Research, the box was X-rayed and the results
were published in the London Times May 6th
1927.
The sealed box was opened by the ‘National Laboratory of Psychical Research’6
on
Monday July 11th
1927, at 8.00pm. This story is very well covered in the ‘Journal of
the American Society for Psychical Research’ (JASPR) Volume XXI 1927. I shall
only print what is said in relation to Peters’ psychometric results published in the
JASPR page 704:-
Mr. Vout Peters did much better (referring to the previous psychometrist
Florence Kingstone: Psypioneer). His impressions of “bound books” (Right); “3
different kinds of writings” (annotations and notes in various books); “long piece of
poetry” (Ovid); “curious drawings” (in Riders Merlin); “torn paper” (there was a
crumpled up fly leaf torn from one of the books); “legible writings” (Right); “the
box lining” (in the lid: right); “the name Jehovah” (in the Discourses); “1812 is
mentioned” (on the coins); “writing blue or red” (Merlin is printed throughout in
black and red ); and MS. 8vo. Size” (several of the books are octavo size).
Suprisingly, there is little readily available historic information pertaining to Alfred
Vout Peters. The Psychic News article 2nd
July 1932 by Maurice Barbanell, printed
below, was to be my principal reference to Alfred Vout Peters. However I have now
used this as a template and have further researched some of the points featured by
Barbanell.
Much of this will be continued into the March issue.

The anonymous sitting did not take place at the Lodge residence, but at Mrs. Kennedy’s house who
kept a written record of the s Séance for Lodge.

MEDIUM WHO WAS CONTROLLED BY A
LIVING BEING
__________________________________
HAS THE GIFT OF TONGUES
Alfred Vout Peters is our most widely travelled medium. He is also one of the old
school. He is sixty-three years old and has been in the Spiritualist movement for
thirty-seven years.
When he was quite a child, he was conscious of the presence of two other
children, and he used to remark to his mother, “I suppose they are God's
angels who come and play with me after you leave me?’’
His mother, obviously a very sensible woman, allowed him to think they were
angels, and thus there was in his mind no sense of fear. The word "ghost” had no
terrors for him, for it was never mentioned to him.
Peters' troubles started when other people heard of his “curious ideas,” and he was
nicknamed “Fossil.” He began to dream dreams that came true, but he kept this to
himself, as he knew he would be laughed at. Then he had visions and heard voices
other than his own. Later he was drawn towards the Society of Friends (Quakers), but
he found that the visions increased in intensity.
He went to his sister-in-law's house on a Sunday early in 1895 for a table-sitting.
He took his place at the table and waited to hear the raps and knocks he had been led
to expect.
Suddenly he felt as if he was being drawn up towards the ceiling, and he
had to bend his head down to look at the people below. He was then thrown
violently back from his chair, and while he was sprawling on the floor he
heard voices coming through his mouth that were not his own.
At that time he knew nothing of Spiritualism, but he continued to sit at home until
his people became frightened. Then he went to a woman to “learn” about
mediumship. He soon discovered that he was doing all the work while she was taking
all the money, so he decided to take up mediumship under his own name.
It was in 1898 that he actually launched out on his own, and since then he has
given seances in all parts of Europe. His guide is Moonstone, a Hindoo, who has
materialised at the sittings of Florrie Cook (Mrs. Corner), Husk, and Williams.
SPREADING THE GOSPEL
Moonstone has told Peters practically nothing about himself. He discourages
personal questions. Peters has a picture of him, but he regards this as sacred, and will
not let it out of his sight. The thought that it should be reproduced in the Psychic
News and that thousands of people should look at it is positively distasteful to him – it
is almost sacrilege.
31
Peters started a propaganda tour lasting ten years in 1903, and he visited every
country in Europe with the exception of Spain, Portugal, and the Balkan States. He
has also been to Iceland and Africa.
He was the first medium to give public clairvoyance in Holland, Belgium, Germany
and several other countries, and while he was in Denmark he twice addressed
audiences of over two thousand people. He concluded this tour just prior to the War,
and after the Armistice had been declared he again travelled to Europe, spreading the
teaching of Spiritualism and giving demonstrations of clairvoyance. He has visited
Holland every year since, and is making another journey to that country this week-
end.
Peters has written extensively for newspapers in England and in other countries,
and was for some time the English correspondent of “Het Toekomsty Leven”
(meaning "The Future Life ") of Denmark. He was also the English representative at
several Spiritualist congresses on the Continent.
LODGE AND THE MEDIUM
He figures largely in Sir Oliver Lodge's book, “Raymond, which is mostly written
round the seances of Mrs. Osborne Leonard and Peters, and his work has been quoted
in various other books.
Peters has the strange experience of being controlled by a living person.
In 1899 he conducted a circle at his house in Brompton. There were three lady
sitters, and one of them was herself a well-known medium. She went to Paris, but
before going she promised the other sitters that she would try to control Peters. In
Paris she went into trance, and Peters went into trance at Brompton. The spirit of this
woman medium controlled Peters and gave evidential messages. Peters was controlled
by her on five separate occasions.
Another similar experience, some time later, was rather embarrassing to a young
woman sitter. While Peters was at Leicester, the daughter of another medium joined
the circle, and Moonstone, who was in control, promised that, as no spirit had come
through for her, he would make a test.
She then heard the voice of her fiancé, who was alive and then on the West
Coast of Africa, calling her by a pet name. He also told her that he had had
her name tattooed on his left arm.
Princess Karadja, of Sweden was a frequent sitter of Peters early in the present
century. She has since published a volume of Spiritualistic phenomena in which she
gives accounts of her sittings with Peters and Husk.
She got into touch with Peters through an advertisement in a psychic newspaper
that had been left behind in a restaurant. She went, a stranger, to Peters’ house for a
sitting, and during the seance a message was given her in Swedish. The evidential
details given her included the fact the husband's coffin had caught fire while it was
lying in state in the castle of Bovigny. Peters went to Sweden in 1901, and she had
several sittings with him.
32
When he first went to Russia, in 1906, he gave what was probably the first public
clairvoyance in that country. The special permission of the police had first to be
obtained – with the aid of a little bribery – and after that he gave clairvoyance to a
number of groups.
SAVING HER FORTUNE
At one meeting the Spirit told a woman, through Peters, that she should put her
papers in order, for her husband would not be much longer on the earth, and if he died
suddenly she would be a poor woman. She replied that she had not lived with her
husband for many years, and, anyway, their estates were separate.
The warning was repeated, however and the woman did have her papers examined.
A fortnight later the woman's husband died, and it was found that the woman's estate
was involved with that of her husband. Had she not had her papers put in order she
would have been a poor woman, as was predicted.
On another occasion Peters had finished his usual clairvoyance when he felt
impelled to tell a man to be careful of the following January 14, about two months off.
The man asked the reason, and Peters replied that he could see that date
written over his head, in black. Peters later learned that the man committed
suicide on 14th January at Monte Carlo, after he had lost heavily at gambling.
Peters opened a campaign with Miss Stead in 1925. They, by the way, are the only
two surviving members of Julia’s Bureau, which was instituted by W. T. Stead and is
now known as the Stead Bureau. The campaign was started in a remarkable way.
Miss Stead received a message from her father, telling her to go out into the
highways and the byways and spread the teaching. She was to take Peters with her, and
they were to concentrate on those places where there was not a Spiritualist society in
existence. Miss Stead was at that time in London, and Peters was in Edinburgh.
Twice while he was in Edinburgh and once while he was in Glasgow Peters had
similar messages from Stead. When they compared notes later, they found that the
messages had come through almost on the same day. Peters knew Stead very well, and
sat with him a great deal.
REVIVING AN OLD TRADE
Peters was once the means of reviving the manufacture of old gold tissue. He went
to Canterbury and saw two women who were searching for the secret.
The information that Moonstone was able to give them enabled them to
present to Queen Alexandra the first piece of gold tissue that had been made
since the eighteenth century.
Through psychometry, Peters was able to trace an important paper, on which
depended the result of a law suit.
A Dr. Hansen once came over from Copenhagen with some letters from a man
named George Larsen to be psychometrised. Neither Peters nor Dr. Hansen knew what
33
the letters contained, but when the doctor returned to Copenhagen he ascertained that
all that Peters had said was correct.
__________________________________
Due to space, this current issue only allows me to pick up on Princess Karadja, of
Sweden. There is little in historic works that gives an early detailed progression of
Modern Spiritualism in this county, so the two following articles gives us some
insight to the work and affect of Alfred Vout Peters’ work.
It will be remembered also that Sweden was the birthplace of Emanuel Swedenborg
(1688 – 1772).
Below is taken from Light October 27th 1900 - page 513
WORKS BY THE PRINCESS KARADJA
The literature of Spiritualism has just been enriched by translation into German
of three little books by the princess Mary Karadja, a well-known Swedish writer
who is a convert to Spiritualism.
In her introduction to ‘Spiritistic Phenomena and Spiritualistic Communications,’
the Princess tells us that the first spiritualistic séance at which she was ever present,
took place in Stockholm, on April 2nd, 1899, with a clairvoyant medium. Up to that
time she had never taken any interest in occult subjects; but she was so impressed
by what then occurred that she determined, when on a visit to London the same
spring, to devote her whole time to this interesting study. She goes on to say that she
had no acquaintance among Spiritualists in London and it was only though seeing an
advertisement in ‘LIGHT’ that she resolved tend a séance with the well-known
clairvoyant and psychometrist, Alfred Peters. The description of this first séance,
which was a turning point in her life, is extremely interesting. She tells us that she
went to him as a perfect stranger and found herself one of ten persons, all of whom
were utterly unknown to her, as she was to them, and says that, as she speaks
English like a native, Mr. Peters was not even acquainted with her nationality. What
occurred at this séance is – I think – worth giving in her own words. Premising that
no one spoke to her and that she took her place without uttering a word, she writes:-
After the medium had psychometrised several persons with good results he
turned to me and said: “I see a spirit close to you” (there followed a description
which I recognised the minutest details as that of my deceased husband). “I hear
him call, Mary! Mary! His name is John; he wishes to say something to you.”
Thereupon followed a long communication of a private nature, concerning facts
about which no one except my late husband could possibly have knowledge. Among
other things, he reminded me of a fire which broke out at Castle Bovigny while his
body was in the coffin. He was conscious of seeing his coffin burning and myself
falling fainting beside it. This remarkable and terrible event was, of course,
unknown to anyone present, nor was I thinking of it at the time. After a short pause
the medium continued: “I see a female figure near you,” which he described
34
minutely. I said I had never known such a person. Mr. Peters said: “She gives her
name as Bremer.” I said he must be mistaken for I had never known anyone of that
name. After a long pause and with great effort, he added, “Fred-rika Bre-mer.7
"
To my astonishment, the voice of the medium changed and he said slowly in
Swedish, “Hjälp den svenska kvinnan” (help the Swedish lady).
Princess Karadja seems to have attended many of Mr. Peters' séances, and she
partly attributes the unusual success she met with to the fact that she discovered that
she herself possessed strong medial powers. With another medium she likewise on
several occasions saw the materialised face of her husband, who was also able to
speak to her, and she gives the names and addresses of persons who were present,
among whom was Dr. George Wyld. She seems to have highly enjoyed her visit to
London and writes:
I had the great happiness during my stay in London of making the acquaintance
of many eminent men of science, among whom were Sir William Crookes, Mr.
Myers, Mr. Sinnett, Mr. Douglas Murray and Dr. George Wyld, from whom I
obtained much information.
The Princess's stay in London was terminated rather abruptly by a command
from her husband – on the seventh occasion of his appearing to her (June 18th,
1899) – that she should immediately leave London and proceed to the Chapel of
Schloss Bovigny. She accordingly set out on her travels on the following day,
without any idea of why she was required to do so. What occurred on her arrival at
Schloss Bovigny a few days after, I will tell later on.
The remainder of this little book, as well as another called ‘The Gospel of Hope,’
is principally devoted to the facts and philosophy of Spiritualism. Princess Karadja,
though very earnest and even enthusiastic in her endeavours to proclaim what she
justly calls ‘the evangel of hope,' writes with great moderation and without
exaggeration; her diction is clear, and her style marked by great good sense; and
Sweden may be congratulated on possessing among her daughters a lady of such
rare gifts and talents, who is not afraid of devoting them to an unpopular cause. She
says but little of her own medial gifts, but it appears that she is not only
impressionably endowed and possessed of the power of automatic writing, but she
has likewise that of automatic drawing, a rare gift and one requiring great physical
power. Two of her ‘spirit’ drawings appear as frontispieces to ‘Spiritistic
Phenomena’ and ‘The Gospel of Hope.’ The first represents the soul body
immediately after the decease of the physical, with the eyes closed, still
unconscious, and the cord connecting it with the mortal body not yet dissevered.
The second is a symbolical drawing, executed in the presence of two Swedish ladies
– whose names are given – on January 16th, 1900; an explanation of this was given
in writing later on and appears opposite it. Both drawings are beautifully executed.
The third of these little books, ‘Into the Light,’ is an inspirational poem,
translated into German by Alfred Wocher von Trauchburg from the Swedish
original, and the remarkable manner of its production may be best given in the
authoress's own words from the preface. I will just say that I feel scarcely competent
7
This was a well-known Swedish authoress and philanthropist, who flourished in the early part of the
century and whose works, translated into English, I was very fond of in my youth, but which are rarely
met with now. M.T.
35
to judge of its merits as a poem, being, as it is, a translation from one foreign
language into another; but it appears to me to be full of beauties, while the interest is
so sustained I could not lay it down till I had read the last line. Princess Karadja
writes:-
When I was in London last spring I received a series of spiritistic
communications from my deceased husband… In the last one he requested me to
leave London immediately in order to receive a communication from the spirit
world in the chapel of Schloss Bovigny. I obeyed, and on St. John's Eve I was told to
provide myself there with paper and writing materials. My hand then automatically
drew a sun and wrote the words “Mot Ljuset” (Into the Light); and then was written
“In memoria œterna erit justus.” I have never studied Latin and am ignorant if
this is a quotation.
What followed was not written automatically but through inspiration. When I
took the pen in my hand I had no idea of what was going to be written, in spite of
which I wrote hundreds of verses without once pausing for a word. It seemed to me
at the time as though the temperature perceptibly became lower and I was freezing
in spite of the oppressive heat of summer. My soul was wrapt and all my senses
sharpened to an extraordinary degree. I seemed to perceive the whispers of spirits
so clearly, it was as though I was being dictated to.
The poem itself is addressed to the medium in the first person by the supposed
spirit of one who says his name has long been forgotten on earth. In his earth life he
was a materialist, and wholly given up to selfish and sensual pleasures; when he had
exhausted all that earth could give him and was tired of life, he thought to ensure
eternal rest, or annihilation, by putting an end to it, which he did by committing
suicide by shooting himself. The horror be experienced when, after a short period of
unconsciousness, he awoke to find that, although his body lay dead before him
weltering in the blood he himself had shed, he himself was as much alive as ever,
but in total darkness and despair, is very graphically depicted, as are the events
which follow, through which he was finally led ‘into the Light.’ The poem contains
many instructive passages, and throughout the gospel of Hope is proclaimed, in that
it sets forth that there is hope for the greatest sinner who ever lived when he can
once be brought to send forth a cry of penitence and a prayer, however feeble and
despairing, to that Heavenly Father whom in life he had ignored and denied.
The German editions of these three little books are entitled respectively
‘Spiritistische Phænomene,’ ‘Das Evangelium der Hoffnung,’ and ‘Zum Licht.’
They are very daintily got up, are printed in large clear type on very fine paper, and
published by Max Spohr at Leipzig, at the price of one mark and a half each.

SPIRITUALISM IN NORWAY AND SWEDEN
_________________
As many of my friends have asked me to write about my experiences in
Scandinavia, permit me to say that Spiritualism in Sweden and Norway is of long
standing, and some of the best English and American mediums have visited both
countries. I met many people who knew Mr. Eglinton, Dr. Slade, Mrs. Fay, and last,
but not least, Madame d'Esperance, who is loved and honoured for her self-
sacrificing work on the Continent. But, although the climate and conditions
generally are good, yet in the whole of Norway and Sweden, so far as I am aware,
there is not a clairvoyant who can give a test. I think I am correct in saying that I
was the first clairvoyant who visited Sweden to work for Spiritualism.
Some of the readers of ‘LIGHT,’ I find, are under the impression that my
reception in Stockholm was not a good one, because, in her kindly letter in
`LIGHT,' of March 15th, the Princess Karadja pointed out some of the difficulties 9
I had to contend with; but I am pleased to say that every one I met in Sweden and
Norway was most kind and sympathetic, and both Spiritualists and non-Spiritualists
put themselves out of the way to make me happy and comfortable, and the only
rudeness I received was from an Englishman. The representatives of the Press of
Stockholm interviewed me and were very much kinder to me than those of London
papers; but I regret that I cannot say the same regarding their treatment of the
Princess Karadja, whose recent nervous breakdown was due to her great efforts to
correct and counteract the misstatements and misrepresentations of the newspapers
all over Sweden. There is, however, another side to the picture. The people are tired
of the State Church; at the same time materialism does not satisfy them; and
Princess Karadja's book, ‘Towards the Light,’ which has been translated into well-
nigh every other language but English, has made many a heart hungry for the truths
of Spiritualism. The Spiritualists meet at each other's houses and hold seances at
which they get a little automatic writing, and read and translate ‘LIGHT’ (which, by
the way, is light to the struggling ones there), and in Norway there are many
Spiritualists who are the converts of a gentleman who was brought to Spiritualism in
South America. There is a spiritualist paper edited by Mr. Torstenton, of Skien, and
the faithful few struggle on, endeavouring to help their countrymen to realise that

A significant part of Mary Karadja letter: - Your English readers cannot form any conception of
the intense hatred which the progress of our Cause has provoked in certain classes of this country.
Some people (who had obtained admission under false pretences) came to the seances with the
deliberate purpose of preventing success, and afterwards published in the papers distorted reports of
the phenomena we obtained.
One man of science, for instance, conceived the neat little trick of giving the medium, to
psychometrise, a piece of paper enclosed in four envelopes, which he had got from different people,
and which consequently was impregnated with uncongenial fluids. In another case a piece of waste
paper was handed to the medium, enclosed in a mourning envelope fastened with a black seal, by a
sad-faced gentleman, who afterwards begged Mr. Peters to psychometrise a locket, containing ‘hair
of a dear relative.’ Later on the public were informed that the hair had been taken from the tail of a
dog. (taken from Mr. Peters in Sweden by Princess Karadja Light 1902)
37
there is no death. The good work of Mr. Matthews Fidler is not forgotten; and how
truly his memory is loved both in Sweden and Norway eternity alone can reveal! I
feel sure that the readers of ‘LIGHT’ will extend their deep sympathy to the
Princess Karadja in the sufferings which have resulted from her noble endeavours to
spread the knowledge of truth in her country, against the opposition of clergy,
doctors, college professors, and an unchivalrous public Press, and wish her a speedy
restoration to health and strength.
As an illustration of the eagerness of the people to know the truth, I may mention
that I met a lady in Christiania who had travelled two hundred miles to attend the
séance during the rigour of a Norwegian winter – and those only who have
experienced it can understand what that means. At Stockholm, too, there was an old
peasant woman who came twenty-five miles over an ice-bound sea to Princess
Karadja, to get proof of her son's death (and entrance into life), for he had left home
in a, boat and was never heard of again. Spiritualism has brought light to many, and
‘the tears have thereby been wiped from many eyes.’ May God bless the workers
and brave upholders of truth in the lovely lands of Sweden and Norway, is the wish
of
ALFRED VOUT PETERS.

Further Notes on Historical Ideas of Human
Radiations:
I. On Electricity and Other Forces
Carlos S. Alvarado
The topic of human radiations—also called animal magnetism, fluids, and nervous,
psychic or vital force—has a vast literature, as I have discussed in a recently
published paper (Alvarado, 2006). In that article I reviewed several ideas and
observations from mesmeric, spiritualistic, and psychical research writings. The
current notes, divided into four parts, are intended to be an addendum to the previous
paper and are based to a great extent on material that had to be excluded due to space
limitations. It is my hope that, together with the initial paper, these notes will guide
38
interested readers to sources of information about past concepts of force and their
relation to psychic phenomena.
Electrical Speculations and Other Forces
Darnton (1968) has reminded us that ideas of animal magnetism were developed by
Mesmer and others in France in the context of a great interest in all kind of physical
forces. For example, at the time the wonders of electricity were as mysterious to the
intellectual and scientist as was animal magnetism. Electricity was considered by
many to be a vital force, something related or identical to the process of life itself
(Brazier, 1984; Clarke & Jacyna, 1987; for a later period see Morus, 1998). In fact,
the concepts of electricity and animal magnetism were not completely independent of
each other (Sutton, 1981). Certainly some mesmerists drew their ideas from the
studies of electricity of their times. In one mesmerist’s view: “Mesmerism is probably
only a modification of inorganic electricity” (Esdaile, 1852, p. 230). Esdaile further
wrote: “If the electric fish can secrete electricity, and project it in the direction desired
by the will, why should not man possess a modification of the same power?” (p. 233).
Another writer stated:
Some consider Electricity to be the principle of life . . . . We hear of Galvanism and
Magnetic-electricity, or Electro-magnetism, and its efficacy through machines, upon
the human body, in relieving paralysis and rheumatism, and different neuralgic
disorders. Why might not Mesmerism, or Animal-magnetism . . . be Electricity under
a different character? . . . . In our present imperfect knowledge of Mesmerism . . . it
may be premature to adopt a theory: still I cannot help expressing an opinion that
electricity, under some modification or other, is the immediate agent to which the
Mesmeric action must be referred (Sandby, 1848, p. 71).
In this context, animal magnetism was only one among many unexplained forces of
nature. Mesmer himself felt that animal magnetism could increase our understanding
of such things as fire, light, gravity, and electricity, as seen in his Mémoire sur la
découverte du magnétisme (1779, p. 80). Some years later Deleuze (1813, p. 81)
wondered about the possibility that animal magnetism was a variant of such forces as
light, magnetism, electricity, and heat. While this context did not ensure universal
acceptance of the idea of animal magnetism in all quarters, it may have prepared the
ground for receptive hearing.
Another example of attempts to associate animal magnetism to other forces of nature
was John Ashburner’s (1867) discussion of animal magnetism in his book, Notes and
Studies in the Philosophy of Animal Magnetism and Spiritualism. In his view, we
should consider the “evolutions of forces to be traced from the lowest grades of
mineral crystal force by successive gradations up to that magnetic vital force
culminating finally in the magnet, or grand crystal, Man; who remains subject even in
the operations of his mind, to an inexorable magnetic law, acting through his
phrenological organs, either from the force of his own soul, or from the force of the
will of another” (p. vii). Such continuity of forces was assumed by many in the
mesmeric literature.
39
Spiritualists also speculated that the phenomena produced by mediums were new and
little-understood forces of nature, such as magnetism and electricity. This seemed to
have been the perspective taken by Thomas Brevior (1864). After discussing such
phenomena as evaporation, combustion, heat, electricity, and magnetism, Brevior
stated: “If spirit is to us a mystery, matter of which we talk so gliby is no less so; for
who can tell what matter is . . . . What is the substance which underlies these
properties? Who can tell me that? If we know spirit by its manifestations, we know
matter only by its properties of the real—the inmost nature of both we are equally
ignorant” (pp. 279-280). Similar arguments and comparisons appeared in other
nineteenth century publications (e.g., Barkas, 1862, pp. 75-82), and it was not
uncommon for spiritualists to write about the forces of nature, principles such as
electricity, light, and magnetism (e.g., Dille, 1852). Many writers on spiritualism
discussed the range of physical forces and its relation to spirit. One such example was
the following:
It is well known that, in its higher gradations, matter is so sublimated as to escape the
observation of the senses. If we admit that, in this refined state, it may be organized,
we have furnished our answer to the great question of the soul’s independent
existence. It is equally certain that the sphere of organic being comprehends millions
of creatures, too minute to be perceived by the eye. Why may not other millions exist,
invisible, not on account of their minuteness, but the refinement of their composition?
. . . . But if disorganized matter may be so refined as to escape the sphere of sensuous
observation, can a single reason be given for the hypothesis which denies the
existence of invisible beings, possessing an organic structure of more refined
elements, and adapted to sustain the relations, and perform the functions of a more
exalted and spiritual life? To think of limiting the organic law to the contracted vision
of mortals, indicates less of the immortal than appropriately belongs to man. If I am
not in error concerning the general law which I have presumed to graduate the
organization of matter by the specific degrees of its refinement, the argument would
seem to be conclusive in proof of the existence of invisible spiritual beings (Brittan,
1852, p. 59-60).
Eugene Crowell asserted in his book The Identity of Primitive Christianity and
Modern Spiritualism (1874): “Whatever may be the force employed, it soon becomes
evident to all investigators of the spiritual phenomena, that electricity is not the cause
of them, as some unscientific persons assert” (Vol. 1, p. 493). Nonetheless, there were
many speculations about the role of electricity in spiritualistic phenomena. This
included a statement from a spirit communicators saying: “It is by that power all
tangible bodies are moved—all the so-called miracles are performed” (Bradley, 1870,
p. 186). Furthermore such an influential writer as Andrew Jackson Davis believed that
electricity was the “universal medium of spiritual vision” (Davis, 1853, p. 264).
In his book Experimental Investigations of the Spirit Manifestations, chemist Robert
Hare (1855) saw raps as related to some sort of electricity. As discussed in
mediumistic communications presented by Hare: “The raps are produced by voluntary
discharges of the vitalized spiritual electricity, above mentioned, from the spirit,
coming in contact with the animal electricity emanating from the medium” (p. 94).
Certainly many writers speculated on electricity, or its variants, to explain such
phenomena as the movement of objects (e.g., Dods, 1854; Hitchman, 1875), an idea
40
disputed by others (e.g., Rogers, 1853). One writer presented an elaborate and
imaginative account of the process:
The vertebrae are, as it were, the successive plates of a galvanic battery, of which the
skull is the appex, while the spine, culminating in the brain, constitutes, like the acid
in the artificial battery, a continuous and cumulative creator and channel of the
electromagnetic force. Of this force the nerves of sensation and of voluntary motion
are the conductors. . . . The living battery, as ordinarily charged, may suffice to keep
but one hemisphere of the brain in action, while an excessive charge may keep both
hemispheres in simultaneous action.
This theory may account for the rappings, phosphoric lights, table tippings, and other
physical phenomena, reported in connection with the pretended spiritual intercourse.
(Modern Necromancy, 1855, p. 521)
There were reports of electrical-like sensations that supported this belief. When Judge
John Worth Edmonds was developing as a medium he experienced “like a stream of
electricity” touching him in different parts of the body (Edmonds & Dexter, 1853, p.
19). Another example appeared in Capron and Barron’s Explanation and History of
the Mysterious Communion with Spirits (1850). They stated in relation to rapping
mediums: “Persons sometimes feel a sensation of electricity passing over their limbs
when they stand in the vicinity of those who get the sounds most freely, although the
particular persons who seem to be the medium feel no sensation at all. In one or two
instances we have seen a perceptible shock as if caused by a galvanic battery
especially when the persons were under the influence of Magnetism” (p. 29).
Similarly, Sophia De Morgan (1863) referred to sensations of “tingling like that
produced by the wires of a galvanic battery, and, during the raps, slight shocks like
electricity passing through the arm of the medium” (p. 95).
The idea was also related late into the nineteenth-century to telepathy. One example
was Mark Twain’s (1891) belief that “the something which conveys on thoughts
through the air from brain to brain is a finer and subtler form of electricity” (p. 101).
Other cases helping to keep alive the belief in the electrical agency of physical
phenomena were reports of poltergeist occurrences. The controversial “electrical girl”
Angélique Cottin (Owen, 1864) was one of the better known and most widely cited
cases (e.g., Rogers, 1853, pp. 52-59). She presented phenomena such as the apparent
“repulsion” of chairs and other objects when in contact with her body. Another case
was published in the Atlantic Monthly by H. A. Willis (1868, p. 133), who reported
observations made to determine whether electricity accounted for both raps and
movements of tables. The raps usually followed the presumed agent around but when
she got into a bed that had the posts on glass with the purpose of preventing electrical
discharges, the raps did not take place. Lack of raps in bed continued for six weeks
and when they were heard once it was found that one of the posts was not on the
glass. Other observations did not seem to support an electrical explanation.
In his book, Essai sur les phénomènes électriques des etres vivants comprensant
l’explication scientifique des phénomènes dits spirites, Louis-Sophrone Fugairon
(1894) claimed that “mediumistic phenomena are nothing but electrical phenomena”
(p. 181). Under abnormal conditions this electricity could be projected from the body
and could be enhanced by emission from the sitters in a mediumistic circle. The
41
phantoms seen in these circles, according to Fugairon, were electrical vapors coming
from the medium. These could be “an expansion of the vaporous body similar to the
pseudopods or prolongations of the gelatinous body of amoebas” (p. 153). The
electrical vapor could be formed also of organic substances from the medium’s body.
This vaporous body, called an aereosome, formed materializations.
Whiting (1871) recommended the use of a “magneto-electric” machine of his to
improve table phenomena caused by the animal electricity used by the spirits. Along
these lines, De Rochas (1897, p. 16) noticed that Palladino’s phenomena seemed to be
intensified by electricity from a Wimshurst machine. Years later Azam (1926)
believed that the vital force was a current of electrons (p. 356) and that this current
from mediums and sitters produced materializations (p. 410).
There is no question that electricity, and other forces and related technology, became
part of the modern nineteenth-century world. Electricity was so integrated into culture
that an author referred to an “age of electricity, just as former ones have been called,
respectively, the ages of stone, bronze, and iron” (Brackett, 1889, p. 643). Such a
principle, perceived by many as having limitless potential, was surely destined to be
applied to all sorts of mysterious and little understood phenomena, such as the ones
discussed in this paper.

So farewell then, the Christian Parapsychologist?
A good name is better than precious ointment" - Ecclesiastes 7.1
_______________________
It’s official – the Churches’ Fellowship for Psychical and Spiritual Studies is planning
to close down its flagship quarterly journal “The Christian Parapsychologist” after the
retirement of Canon Michael Perry (see Psypioneer January 2008.10
) The news came
in a circular sent to all members dated February 2008. Recommendations from a
working party (names not disclosed) whom they consulted had been approved by the
CFPSS Council.
“It was also recommended that the‘ Christian Parapsychologist’ in its present form
should cease publication with Michael’s final edition in September 2008 to be re-
launched with the new title ‘ Psychical and Spiritual Studies’ in the Spring of 2009. It
is proposed that this new journal be published only twice a year, but be larger in
size….”
It was not clear why the closure had been sought, but the new title, which omits the
word “Christian”, might be felt to be more inclusive and of a wider appeal in a multi-
cultural society. However this could be a “Consignia moment” (a reference to the
decision of the old-established Post Office brand in the UK to change its name in
2002 to the meaningless “Consignia,” later reversed at great expense). There is also
the possibility of confusion with other journals, such as those of the Unitarian Society
for Psychical Studies or of the former Academy of Religion and Psychical Research11
.
The fate of Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship, which became so inclusive it faded like the
Cheshire Cat, also comes to mind.
But in my memory we are again in the parlour of CFPSS vice-chairman John Pearce-
Higgins (JDPH) in Putney, London, in Spring 1975. It is late but the Psychic
Phenomena Committee, chaired by Rev Allan Barham, is discussing a proposal to
issue a newsletter. The name, conceived later by David Ellis who printed the early
issues, was “The Christian Parapsychologist.” (Ellis also drew the original chi-rho-psi
symbol for the CP) The new publication caused consternation. This was no
duplicated gestetner effort, but a fully fledged printed journal in miniature. Soon the
command came from CFPSS headquarters to cease publication, as there was already
an official organ, the “Quarterly Review” edited by Maurice Frost the general
secretary.
But Ellis, Michael Lewis and myself, while agreeing to remove the CFPSS symbol,
registered it as a business name. Margaret Brice-Smith, then merely in her eighties,
was joined by her colleague from the CFPSS Mysticism Committee, Jean Sydney, and
they took over sub records and distribution of the new publication. (Real mystics can
10

44
be highly practical!) Margaret also financed expansion. She recruited Robin Gold to
be our treasurer. Edwin Butler, a veteran Christian Spiritualist, became Minutes
Secretary of the Editorial Group.
Another Spiritualist, Maurice Barbanell, editor of Psychic News, was not pleased.
Christian Parapsychology, he declared, was a contradiction in terms. And certainly in
those days the fellowship was regarded with suspicion not just by Spiritualists (for
stealing their thunder, as was supposed) but also by many church people, and by
psychical researchers, for alleged unsound beliefs and uncritical attitudes.
Archdeacon Michael Perry epitomised the change which ensued. After accepting an
invitation to review a book for CP, he later became book review editor and then editor
himself. The first bishops, then an archbishop, appeared in its pages. No wonder
CFPSS president Garth Moore was moved to declare that CP was the most effective
single instrument so far in the mission of the fellowship. The CFPSS symbol was
proudly restored on CP next to CP’s own Greek symbol.
Some of those who created the early CP went on to further work. David Ellis became
printer to this day of the SPR. Robin Gold served as CFPSS treasurer, Margaret Brice-
Smith became a CFPSS vice-president. Edwin Butler in his nineties was an early
financier of Psypioneer publications. The CP editor of 1975 became the
“Theosophical History” editor of 1985; this publication again caused consternation, as
content was not controlled by any theosophical organisation; still the case12
.
Personally I believe that CP has something in common with Psychic News. We have
published accounts of how PN was inspired from elsewhere. Similarly I suspect that
CP also was an idea dropped into the subconscious by what JDPH used to call the
celestial civil service. I think also it was foreshadowed by a gentleman of military
bearing (giving the name Reg) who was perceived by a medium just before a sitting in
Chiswick in 1974, and who spoke of a coming small thing which would become large.
But then Col. Lester himself, first fellowship chairman, had been alerted (by Mollie
Duncan) well in advance, to the coming of the fellowship.
CFPSS members have until 29 February 2008 to comment on these and other
proposals. The Fellowship is to be commended for setting them out in detail to
members well in advance.

W.J. COLVILLE
1859 – 1917
W.J. Colville was an inspirational speaker and authored numerous books; in 1890 he
became a member of the Theosophical Society.
The following has been taken from his short autobiography that was published in his
‘Universal Spiritualism’ R.F. Fenno & Company: New York (copyright 1906)
including several quotes.
Colville starts his autobiography I quote: -
IF I am to relate faithfully, even in barest outline, my experiences with “unseen
helpers,” I must go back to my very early childhood, when my “mediumship”
originally declared itself. I was practically an orphan from birth. My mother passed
to spirit life in my infancy and my father was called by important business to travel in
lands remote from England, where I was left in charge of a guardian.
He continues; Inspirational experiences: -
How I first came to see my mother clairvoyantly I do not know, but I distinctly
remember becoming vividly conscious at frequent intervals of the gentle, loving
presence of a beautiful young woman, who invariably appeared to my vision
gracefully attired in light garments of singular beauty. The head of this charming lady
was adorned with golden ringlets; her eyes were intensely blue; she was tall and of
rather slender build, and manifested many attributes of almost ideal womanhood. I
cannot recall to mind any occasion when this lady spoke to me as one ordinary
human being on earth converses with another, but I distinctly recollect that when I
saw her most plainly and felt her presence most distinctly, I was intensely conscious
of information flowing into me. I can only liken my experience to some memorable
statements of Swedenborg concerning influx of knowledge into the interiors of human
understanding.
Significant dates May 24th
1874 - March 4th
1877: -
I gradually drifted into a more prosaic state of life, from which I was suddenly
aroused by the presence of the world-renowned Cora L. V. Richmond (then Mrs.
Tappan) in England during the seventies of the last century. When I was nearly
fourteen years of age, and a member of a church choir, Mrs. Tappan greatly excited
the population of Brighton, where I was then residing, by her marvelous discourses
and poems, and singularly erudite replies to all kinds of questions, which she claimed
were not due to her own erudition, of which she made no boast and to which she laid
no claim, but to the action through her instrumentality of a band of guides who were
ready to speak through her whenever their services were in demand.
May 24th, 1874, was, indeed, an eventful day in my history, for though my public
career as a lecturer and globe-trotter did not begin till nearly three years later, it was
on the evening of that beautiful Whit-Sunday that I experienced the first thrill of
consciousness that it was my principal lifework to travel nearly all over the earth,
guided by unseen but not unknown inspirers, who would carry me safely over all
46
tempestuous oceans and protect me from all dangers by land if I would but be faithful
to the mission entrusted to me by wise and kindly helpers.
When I first took the platform I felt very much as I had often felt in more private
places when voluntarily obeying the silently expressed dictation of the talented
psychologist who could transmit to and through me any information he desired to
convey when I was in a susceptible condition; but though he declared that I was
perfectly his “subject,” and I was quite willing to be such, I could not be induced by
any professional mesmerist, or practicing physician, who was engaged in the conduct
of hypnotic experiments, to receive or transmit anything, simply because I did not
choose to make myself passive or susceptible.
I remember well sitting on the platform in old Doughty Hall (a Masonic edifice no
longer in existence) on Sunday evening, March 4th, 1877, and gazing out upon a
large concourse of people gathered to hear the “kitten orator,” as I had been called
because of my youth, discourse on a subject to be selected by their own vote. A hymn
was sung to open a semi-religious service, and then I rose and offered a prayer, the
words of which formed themselves in my mouth without forethought or conscious
volition of my own. After a second hymn the presiding officer – the long celebrated
James Burns, editor of the Medium and Daybreak – announced in my hearing that
the youthful occupant of the platform was prepared to discourse under inspiration on
any theme the audience might think proper to select. I heard this without the slightest
internal trepidation. I had become tense, callous, self-assured, but completely
confident that an intelligence beyond my normal own would certainly render me
entirely equal to the occasion.
A subject was quickly decided upon by show of hands, and I rose to lecture. I
spoke unfalteringly for fully an hour, and resumed my seat unexcited and unfatigued.
A third hymn was sung, and then Mr. Burns called upon the audience to mention
topics for an impromptu poem. Three or four subjects were given, and no sooner was
a decision reached by the chairman as to which topic had received the greatest show
of hands, than I rose for the third and last time that evening, and heard myself reel off
a number of verses as easily and fluently as though I had them well committed to
memory, though I am certain they were nowhere in print, and I was listening to them
for the first time.
From this point Colville, for the next nineteen months (March 1877 – 1878) became a
celebrated speaker in England, he left England for Boston America near the close
of October, 1878,
On reaching America he found that his arrival had been heralded in the columns
of the Banner of Light, the oldest spiritualistic paper in the world at that time. He
was met by his friend the spiritualist pioneer Robert Cooper, of Eastbourne,
England who will incidentally be featured in a later next newsletter.
Cooper informed Colville on his arrival that Dr. Peebles had just completed a
lecture engagement in Parker Memorial Hall, and that he had announced Colville to
be his successor. Colville now 18 years old was entirely unknown to the directors of
the Parker Hall lectureship. In Boston his work quickly grew and he was called to
New York, Philadelphia, and other mighty cities, not excepting Chicago, where he
47
filled Mrs. Cora L. V. Richmond's platform for an extended period, while she was
filling an engagement in Boston.
He writes: - Nearly five busy years had sped their course when, in 1883, I found
myself again in England, taking up afresh the work which I never laid down, but only
temporarily suspended when I was led to cross the ocean and become a prominent
worker in America.
1884 he returned to the United States, and in 1885 again briefly revisited England.
During those years he accomplished a large amount of literary work in addition to
extensive traveling and constant lecturing, also visiting California in 1886 for the first
time….., and spent five delightful months on the sunny Pacific slope, in which
charming country I addressed daily audiences often numbering many hundred
persons, and saw wonderful results from the practice of mental healing, of which I
had by that time become, and of which I still am, an uncompromising, though I trust
not a fanatical, advocate and exponent.
Colville continues: - For ten years I saw nothing of England, and it was through the
joint instrumentality of Lady Caithness, Duchesse de Pomar, in Paris, and the special
excursion of the World's Women's Christian Temperance Union from New York, in
June, 1895, that I revisited Europe after ten years' unbroken residence in America.
Those ten years had been very busy and highly eventful ones; my singular experiences
during their highly checkered course would fill many a bulky volume. I had scoured
America from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, and had met with warm receptions and
enthusiastic audiences everywhere, though let no one imagine that a prominent public
life means constant resting on a bed of roses; roses abound but thorns are often their
intimate neighbors. I had produced a number of books, edited several periodicals,
and contributed many hundreds of articles to magazines, besides having written
thousands of letters to newspapers, in addition to musical work, before I again set
foot in England after my departure in 1885.
In 1886 Colville received pressing invitations to visit Australia, but he did not go until
around 1900 to which he records: - ……during the nearly two years which I spent
south of the Equator, I still pursued my way unflaggingly and untiringly in all
varieties of climate and in a great variety of surroundings. I owe a deep debt of
gratitude to friends, seen and unseen, for the many tokens of their care and kindness
which have brightened all my journeyings and rendered possible of accomplishment
the widely extended mission which took me to the Southern Hemisphere. Adelaide,
Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Newcastle, and many smaller places in great Australia,
I shall ever feel united with as centres of work which I know has already borne good
fruit in numerous ways. Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch in picturesque New
Zealand will always remain equally sacred in my memory. During all my Antipodean
wanderings I found my psychic faculties fully as clear and as much in evidence as in
other lands where the Southern Cross is an unseen constellation. I am now assured
that my traveling days are not yet over, and that I still have oceans to cross, and
continents to traverse, before I can honorably retire from active service, if such
retirement shall ever be my portion.

LIGHT, July 13, 1901 - page 334.
MR. W. J. COLVILLE
Though it is a long time since I have sent anything to your columns, I have during
my long sojourn at the Antipodes been frequently delighted and edified by the pages
of your most instructive journal, which I am happy to say is being very extensively
read in the public reading rooms of all the chief Australian cities; no paper, indeed,
is more eagerly sought after and diligently perused in the School of Arts of Library
in Sydney, which is always frequented by an immense crowd of readers. I was very
much pleased to see your kind allusion a few months ago to my anticipated return to
London. In the course of a business letter to Mr. Lingford I incidentally mentioned
my fervent hope that I should soon see London again, not expecting that it would
gain such wide publicity as your columns have given it. In consequence of your
advertising my expected return to England I have received up to date nearly forty
letters from old and new friends inquiring as to the expected date of my arrival and
the arrangements to be made for my public appearances and semi-private lectures. I
now ask you to inform your numerous readers that my engagement in Sydney –
where I am having immense audiences twice and often three times every Sunday,
and nearly every evening in the week, either in the city or the suburbs – terminates
with the end of July. Early in August I expect to embark on the Canadian Pacific
steamer for Vancouver, en route for England I shall no doubt be detained a few
months in America, where I have numerous opportunities for lecturing and
important business with publishers, but at the very latest I hope to be installed in
London early in December next. Before my arrival I shall advertise in your columns
full particulars concerning my lecture-courses in London, and hope that our mutual
friend, Mrs. Bell-Lewis, whose name I am glad often appears in your columns, will
again act as advance agent, fully empowered to make engagements for me previous
to my arrival.
I am sure you will be glad to learn that very great and serious interest is now
being taken all over Australia and New Zealand in all those numerous and important
questions which are so ably discussed in your paper from week to week, and you
cannot be other than highly pleased to know that your recent editorials have been
quoted far and wide, and have given solid help and comfort to many perplexed and
doubting people. Mr. Terry, of the `Harbinger of Light,' in Melbourne, efficiently
aided by his extremely competent secretary, Miss Hinge, and a large staff of able
assistants, is doing a most successful business and carrying on highly successful and
influential meetings. During my recent visit to Melbourne I had immense audiences
on several occasions, despite the fact that rain often came down in deluges for
several days in succession. In the beautiful city of Adelaide, where I have filled
five successful engagements during the past fifteen months, I find unbounded
interest in all phases of spiritual and generally progressive thought, and I anticipate
equally favourable symptoms when I visit Brisbane, where I expect to lecture
49
immediately I leave Sydney on my way to Vancouver. New Zealand (particularly
Wellington) is a very fruitful field for work. Mrs. Ada Foye 13
has been there more
recently than my visit, and has reported even greater enthusiasm than I witnessed
during my singularly successful course of lectures there last January.
The visit of the Duke and Duchess of York to Melbourne, Sydney, and all the
other chief cities of the Southern Hemisphere is passing off brilliantly. All the cities
are splendidly decorated, business has greatly improved, crowds of visitors from the
Northern Hemisphere have seen Australia for the first time, and their Royal
Highnesses, who are beloved as well as greatly respected wherever they go, have
certainly been instrumental in substantially aiding the progress of the Australian
Commonwealth. At the time of writing the weather in Sydney is perfect; this is the
Australian November, and is indeed a very different month from its English
equivalent. Gentle showers fall occasionally, but the weather is nearly always fine
and bright and the temperature pleasantly temperate.
When I know the exact date of my departure for England I will again
communicate with you; meanwhile I think I can safely promise that I can fulfil any
engagements which may be made for me in England not earlier than Sunday,
December 15th. With all best wishes for old and new friends, wherever they may
sojourn, believe me, sincerely your co-worker, W.J. COLVILLE
4, Norwich-chambers,
Hunter-street, Sydney.
