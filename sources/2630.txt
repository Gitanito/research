A NEW SPIRITUAL AND OCCULT IN­
TERPRETATION OF THE TEACHINGS
OF JESUS AS FOUND IN THE GOS­
PELS AND OTHER SOURCES,
By
Doreal
Thi3 Interpretation of the FOUR
GOSPELS, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,
is the answer to the crying need of the
Age for a comprehensive exolanation of
the Teachings of Jesus. It gives the
TRUE Teachings as they were originally
taught and it explains away the many
ERRORS which have crept into the modern
versions due to interpolation, numerous
translations and later attempts at re­
vision to fit special doctrines.
The FOUR GOSPELS explains the "Mys­
teries" behind the sayings of Jesus.
The time is at hand for the "hidden
things" about the life of Jesus and his
Teachings to be made clear. The Secret
Teachings of Jesus need no longer remain
obscure. Dr. Doreal has so simply and
clearly explained the Four Gospels that
anyone can perfectly understand the won­
derful message of Truth the Master Jesus
came to give.

The Science of H e a l t h , the healing
of o n e ’s self and of others is so plainly
explained in this b o o k that anybody can
learn how to use the S p i r i t u a l bower for
healing. The b o o k is w r i t t e n in two
parts; the first part gives the law of
Magnetic Healing and how it is applied to
the mental, nervous and physical anatomy
of man. In the second part specific
cases are given with their corresponding
treatments,
With the principles given in this
book the reader will be able to acquire
the Spiritual power to heal himself and
others. He is shown how the Magnetic
Healing Vibration is sent to the affected
parts and how to correct the cause. When
the cause is treated and removed the
symptoms will disappear. When treating
with this method which Dr. Doreal out­
lines, the healer is taught to heal by
removing the cause of the sickness, — so
that the same symptoms or others will
not later appear.
Spiritual Power is a book which
every healer should have. This method
of Magnetic Healing is so simple that
any student can learn to use it. From
the information contained in this book
he can immediately heal himself and others
without any previous training _ $1.00.

By
Dcroal
A common mistake among most Spirit­
ual Healers is that they use one method
for the treatment of all ills. This
limits them and is usually the reason
for their failure in healing many cases
which come to them for treatment.
There are four planes of man's being
which should be considered in Spiritual
Healing; the physical, mental, psychic
and spiritual planes. A symptom may ap­
pear in the physical which has its cause
in any one or more of these four planes.
The treating of symptoms alone will not
remove the cause. '■'hen the cause is not
eliminated, even though the symptom has
disappeared, the patient has not been
really healed for the same symptoms or
another may later appear if the cause is
allowed to remain.
It is for this reason that when the
heal’
,r has learned how to operate on the
four planes, he is dole to reach the
cause and permanently heal his patients.
One method cannot be successfully used
for all ailments or conditions. With the
knowledge of Four Planes of Healing the
healer may expect to wisely treat the
patient for any condition which may be
brought to him.

Four planes of Healing is a Text­
book for Healers, It describes the Laws
of Healing,; giving the methods for em­
ploying them and cites a largo number of
examples which explain how they are to
be used. Dr. Doreal gives the methods
for diagnosing both the symptoms and
their causes and fully explains the
treatment for each.
This large book Is not written for
the healer alone but may be used for self
treatment as well. The beginning student
in the study of Spiritual Healing may
read FOUR PLANES OF HEALING and begin im­
mediately to practice its principles and
heal the sick. All students who wish to
learn how to heal either themselves or
others should read this book. (Former­

MASTERS, Visible and Invisible con­
tains inestimable information about the
Masters which every student of Truth
should know. So many varied Ideas have
been given about the Masters that the
- I P -
average student has little or no real
understanding of them. This work elimi­
nates the hypothetical concepts wMch so
many have been lead into believing and
explains the natural life and manifesta­
tions of the Masters.
This writing gives valuable infor­
mation about the Masters of the Great
White Lodge, trie Children of Light, and
the Angels or Logoi of the Seven Spirit­
ual Planets which circle the central
Spiritual Sun. Dr.Doreal shows the nine
zones of Color and Light and hov; the Mas­
ters, such as hhoot Hoomi, Iviorya, Hilar-
ion and others manifest in these zones,
teaching and helping those bound in dark­
ness. He explains why the Visible Masters
may appear in either sex and why they have
appeared more often as men than as women,
and why the Invisible Masters are said
to be neither male nor female.
And in addition to the above price­
less information, Dr. Doreal gives the
four aspects of the foul as it is taught
in the Kabbaia and other teachings of
the Ancients. These four aspects of the
foul, and how Michael and famuel, the
good and evil angels or forces in man,
may be balanced to form the fpiritual
Image of Divine Power are explained with
diagrams and charts.
You will find it instructive to re­
fer to this book from time to time while
studying your lessons on Truth or when
reading other books relative to the Mas­
ters and fpiritual Attainment - price $1,00.

We wish to call the attention of
our students and friends to the very in­
formative book by Dr. Doreal, on the
Vitamins and Elements.
The knowledge of fooda and their
value can be of inestimable value to the
Seeker of Light, for often the Student's
development is impaired through improper
feeding. Unless the proper food values
are given in their proper combinations,
the vitality and harmony of the body may
be deficient to meet the demands of the
consciousness for the attainment of bal­
anced, spiritual unfoldment.
This is just the book for. which the
Dietitian has been looking for in his
search for a compendium of food values.
It gives the twenty-two chemical sub­
stances in man and the foods which con­
tain them.
The corresponding physical condi­
tions which appear when the body has a
deficiency or an excess of the twelve
master chemicals, are given with a list
of foods which should be eaten in each
instance.
VITAMINS AND ELEMENTS contain a com­
plete classification of foods and their
combinations. Every person who is inter­
ested in food and how to get well through
eating should have this book, - price 50/.

Some 38,000 years ago Thoth, an At-
lantean Priest-King, t-ha coloniser of
Ancient Egypt (Land of Kher.) , builder of
the Great pyramid of Gizeh, (erroneously
attributed to Cheops) auto-biogrnphi-
cally wrote the legend-fsmous Emerald
Tablets of the mighty "Magic-Science”
and Visdotn o
f
' Atlantis.
These Tablets are posited in one of
the yet unopened chambers of the Great
Pyramid. They are form'd of an Emerald
Green Substance, created through alchem­
ical transmutation. They are imperish­
able for the atomic and cellular struc­
ture is fixed and inoxiditable, and in
this respect violate the material law of
ionization. The Tablets are fastened
together with hoops of golden colored
alloy suspended from a rod of the same
material.
Tsoth was a native son of Ancient
Atlantis. He was born in the city of
Keor, on the Island of Undal. He was
instructed in the Elder Mysteries by his
father Thotme, who was the Keeper of the
Great Temple and a Mouthpiece to Horlet,
Master of Unal and Ruler of Atlantis.
Thoth was chosen from the sons of men
and was taught the bath to Amenti and
- 1 5 -
received the Key to Perpetual Life. Lat­
er, after the sinking of Atlantis, he
and his followers immigrated to Ancient
Egypt.
Upon arriving in Egypt, they found
the land inhabited by a barbarous race
whom they collected together and later
raised to a high degree of civilization,
For some 16,000 years Thoth ruled this
Ancient race, from approximately 50,000
B.C. to 36,000 B.C. Thoth was immortal;
that is, had conquered death, passing
only when he willed, and even then, not
through death. His vast wisdom made him
ruler over the various Atlantean Col­
onies, including the ones in South and
Central America,
When the time came for Thoth to
leave Egypt, he erected the Great Pyra­
mid over the entrance to the Great Halls
of Amenti, placed in it his records and
certain mechanical devices. He then ap­
pointed from among the highest of his
people guards to protect his mighty sec­
rets. In later times the descendants of
these guards became the Pyramid Priests,
while Thoth was deified as the God of
Wisdom, the Recorder, by those in the
a^e of darkness which followed his pas­
sing. In legend, the Halls of Amenti
became the Under-world, the Halls of the
Gods where the soul passed after death,
for judgment. During later ages the ego
of Thoth passed into the bodies of men
in the manner described in the Tablets.
As such he incarnated three times, and
in his last he was known as Hermes, the
- 1 6 -
Thrice-born.
Some thirteen hundred years R.C.,
'Sypt, the Ancient Khern, was in turmoil
^nd there wore many emigrations of priests
to other parts of the world. In one of
these emigrations the Emerald Tablets
were taken by some Pyramid Priests to
South America, nd in the tenth century
the Mayan Priests placed them beneath
the altar of one of the great temples of
the Pun God.
After the conquest of the Havas by
the Spaniards the cities were abandoned
and the tr.asuron of the temples forgot­
ten. Dr.Dorcal who has a connection
with the Great White Lodge, v/hich also
works through the Pyramid Priesthood,
was instructed to recover and return to
the Great Pyramid the Ancient Tablets.
Before returning them he was given per­
mission to translate and retain a copy
of the Wisdom engraved on the Tablets.
This was done in 1925 and only now
has permission been given for this book
to be published.
It is expected that many will scoff,
yet the true student will read between
the lines and gain wisdoms, If the light
is in you, the light which is engraved
in these Tablets will respond, and that
which is strange and beyond the belief
of the modern scientist will he revealed.
The Emerald Tablets are so written
that the words respond to attuned thought
- 1 7 -
I
waves, releasing the associated mental
vibration in the mind of the reader. And
thus the magnanimous wisdom of the author
is revealed.
The Emerald Tablets should be read,
not once, but a hundred times for only
thus can their true meaning be discover­
ed, A casual reading will give glimpses
of beauty, but more intensive study will
open, to the Truth Seeker, avenues to
the most intrinsic wisdom; wisdom of u n ­
utterable majesty and beauty.
The Brotherhood publications has
produced a most attractive binding of
Dr. Doreal’s translation - printed on an
Emerald-jade green paper with a hand
colored cover design of the original
Tablets. The demand for this book on the
Atlantean Mysteries has been so great
that already it is in its second issue
of publication, - price $2.00.

idly given, the reader feels that he is*
seated at Seaton’s side and is instruct­
ed with him.
The Brotherhood of Illuminated Units
of Consciousness, or the Great White
Lodge, is the subject of the First dis­
course, Shamballa, the Secret City of
the Masters, its location and descrip­
tion,- and how the student may go there,
were some of the things discussed in the
Second Discourse.
The Discourses which follow are
more than Discourses, because some of
them are given while Seaton’s Conscious­
ness is free of the body. The main sub­
jects discussed and places visited are
as follows: THE SECRET CITIES, or "Seven
Cities of St.John (or Cibola)", THE COS­
MIC WHITE LODGE, THE SECRET FLAME, THE
INNER EARTH (The Inner Temple and the
Blue Race),TIME AND SPACE, LAW OF LIFE,
THE EMOTIONS, THE CHELA,
INSTRUCTIONS OF A MASTER TO HIS
CHELA is.an unforgettable book, It lifts
the reader into such heights of con­
sciousness that often the Spiritually
evolved student can contact the Great
Masters through the attunement which may
be derived from its reading. The student
wishing to enter into the Teachings of
the Inner Mysteries MUST read this book
for it shows the Path others have taken
- the Path all Occult Students must take.
You may obtain a copy of this wonderful
book for only $1,00.

The Mystery of the Universe is con­
tained in the ‘unwritten Kabbala; the
Keys to the understanding of the forma­
tion of the earth, the beginning of man
and of his evolution to the consumation
are veiled in its symbolism. In the old
Kabbalistic Mystery Schools these keys
were taught to the select few. Because
they were never -written, the Occult "is-
dom of the Kabbala, the Sender Yetzirah,
the Book of Concealed Wisdom, and the
rest of the Ancient Teachings have been
lost to the world at large. The find­
ings of modern fcience has not as yet
even scratched the surface of the Great
Knowledge which the Ancient Races knew-
about the Laws of Creation and of the
manner in which the Supreme Hidden One
manifested in the material.
The Mysteries which Doreal has riven
in this book are much too great and all-
encompassing to iterate in this review.
May it suffice by saying that COSMOGONY
AND COSMOLOGY is more than a history of
Universal events for he has shown the
coming forth of the Laws of Creation while
they wore in the World of Formation even
before the Cosmic Condensation became
-S3-
manifest. Doreal 'explains in this book
how Order and Disorder wore born in the
Vyid “:
:
d ’
? T„ tux Most Ancient Ex­
istent One, trie Supernal Egg (I.Yod),
etc., was brought forth. With the use
of graphs and diagrams, he brings the
forming of the Cosmic Egg, the manifes­
tation of the Sephirothic Lights and the
Creation of the Worlds, Man and Life,
sufficiently simple for all to under­
stand.
But possibly the most appealing
phase of this Work is his illuminating
explanation of Life and of the manner in
which it is manifesting on earth. The
Ancients divided the evolution of the
Universe, which is one Cycle of Cosmic
time, into Seven Earth Cycles, with each
containing seven smaller divisions of
time. The number of years of each epoch
is given and something of the history of
man during these periods are explained.
The Atlantean or Fifth Earth Cycle is
the one which is most elaborately dis­
cussed. A map of Atlantis is shown,
giving the names of the islands.
The reader of this bookwill be able
to learn how it was that man fell into
negation and the reason for his struggle
in the material to regain the full use
of his soul. He will also gain an under­
standing of how the ancient Prophets
were able to foretell the coming of
events in the future, - price $1.00.

THE SEPHER YETZIRAH is a large, at­
tractively bound book unveiling the Kab-
balistic Teachings of the Ancients. It
is a book on the "beginnings" of the
First Cause of Divine Creation and is
usually considered by the Occultists
as an introduction to the main Kabbala.
He who understands the Kabbala has
the Key to the Source of all religions
for it is the "Ancient Wisdom" from which
all Truth Teachings sprang. The SEPHER
YETZIRAH explains how the Infinite Es­
sence of Hoa came Into being and mani­
fested through the ten Sephirotic Lights
of the Divine Troe of Life.
The Holy Elders of the Ancient Wis­
dom Teachers employed the Hebrev/Alphabet
of twenty-two letters, numbers of ten and
the Sepharim to symbolize the Infinite
Foundation of All Things; the Sephiroth
and the Three Holy Mothers of Creation.
No words can express the magnifi­
cence of this Work, nor can one even ad­
equately approach telling another of the
Wisdom which it contains. Dr. Doreal
gives the Text of the Sepher Yetzirah,
verse by verse, and following each verse
he gives explanatory notes of each.
No student of Occultism, Metaphysics,
etc., can afford to be without this beau­
tifully explained versions of the Kabbala
which is illustrated with numerous charts
and diagrams which aids greatly in the
understanding of the text - price $2.00.

Fromundeniable documentary evidence
Dr. Doreal has compiled the facts con­
cerning Ft. Germain. Ft. Germain has
recently been reputedas an Ascended Mas­
ter. A great amount of interest in the
authenticity of Ft.Germain’s Occult Pow­
ers has recently developed. So much has
been said and written about him during
the last decade that thousands have ac­
cepted him as their Spiritual Master and
Teacher'without taking the time or trouble
to verify his authenticity. Because the
records of his life were not readily ac­
cessible to check, little has been actu­
ally known of his true life.
The.records concerning Ft. Germain
(taken from "Mtchel Papers” in the
British Museum and other documents in
the.French Foreign Office and elsewhere)
are.quoted by'Dr. Doreal. These records
written by men who personally knew him,
with letters, which he himself wrote,
etc., establish facts concerning hislife,
habits and Fpiritual qualities which aro
undeniable.
The truth about St. Germain is au­
thentically given in this book. Those
who have been led to believe that he is
a Master or Adept and who wish to learn
the facts about his Fpiritual and Occult
Powers cannot afford to miss reading this
exposition of the "true life" of Ft.
Germain - price 255^.

( U N V E I L E D )
(With Charts)
Doreal
Many of the great secrets of the
'Ancients are hidden in the symbols we
find engraved upon the ruins of their
temples, upon their tombs, and in the
caves of yet more ancient date. Even the
secrets of the Ancient Wisdom Teachers
which have been written, such as the
Kabbala, the Dzyan and others, still re­
main hidden from the uninitiate because
symbolism was employed in their writing.
Many of these symbols are meaningless to
the average student because he has not
learned how to read them. They mean
little more than the printed page would
mean to an illiterate person, end yet,
within the symbols which have come down
to us, are keys and certain esoteric,
meanings of supreme importance to the
Truth Student which may be easily read
after a little training.
Dr. Doreal feeling the need for n
clear exposition of the Occult Symbols
which the 'student often meets in his
study of Truth, has prepared a very in­
formative book on fymbology. He gives
the Occult Symbols in charts snd diagrams
and explains them in a simple and under­
standable manner. You will find practi­
cally every symbol you have ever seen,
and many others which are seldom found
- 27-
by the student,- in this book.
One of the .createat failings of the
average student Is that he neglects the
study of symbology, Fince the Infinite
cannot be drawn down into the finite
realm for the student to understand,
symbols must be employed to act as a
ladder upon w M c h the student may climb
into the realization of the Divine Mys­
teries. Many conscientious students
fail to attain the Spiritual understand­
ing they seek because they fail to rec­
ognize the importance of symbolism in
their study of Truth.
The first intellectual sign that a
student is advancing in his Spiritual
development becomes apparent when he
gains the ability to read Occult Sym­
bols. If Occultism seems difficult for
you to understand, you should apply more
study to Spiritual Symbology. We rec-
comrrend this large compendium of symbols
with their explanation and are confident
you will often refer to them in your study
of Truth - price 50
