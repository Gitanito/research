this is now now let&#39;s talk about what
this is really about
it&#39;s it&#39;s really about the renewal of
democracy because everyone says oh we&#39;re
in a free country in a democracy
but how free and how Democratic can it
be
if the most important Technologies the
most important discoveries are kept from
the media and the public and our policy
makers
remember Jimmy Carter demanded to know
about this and the outgoing CI director
and we have this from people who are
involved at the time told the incoming
president we&#39;re not going to tell you
anything
so there are these have that&#39;s happened
Bill Clinton explicitly made inquiries
and was denied information so you know
I&#39;m not speculating when I say that you
know when you do that this is why in a
court of law you can prove that these
projects are being run illegally and
unconstitutional so that&#39;s you know
that&#39;s a matter of fact and that&#39;s
happened to Presidents since Eisenhower
I remember Eisenhower lost control of
these projects in the in the late 50s
um and that&#39;s when these entire uh
operations just sort of got big enough
and powerful enough
to sort of go off on their own and would
disclose what they wanted to to the to
the president
um so uh I think that&#39;s why it takes
someone who&#39;s willing to issue
you know subpoenas and investigate and
get to the bottom of it which is
happening now the question is how far
are they going to be able to go before
they get sat down all this boils down to
one word courage you know if you have
the courage to do it fine if you don&#39;t
then you&#39;re irrelevant you know and
that&#39;s why when when after I briefed
Clinton CI director his friend came down
to my house
