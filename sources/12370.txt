  		              		Experience Description   

    During a car journey coming back to Nazca, which is  south of Lima, I crashed almost head on with a bus carrying passengers.  I was going along the opposite side of the road and I was overcome with sleep. 

  At the point of the crash, a white light took over my entire field of vision. Then I lost all sense of time and woke up standing in a giant  garden.  I  thought it was like a cemetery because there were buildings, outside steps, and embankments, made of marble. The light was very warm, like a sunset. The vegetation was short  and of a reddish-brown color, without any  green. I was puzzling over the scene when an an enormous presence appeared to my right. It was like a giant tower, or a 'giant bishop' from a chess board.  But the curious thing was that it was impossible for me to focus on it clearly. There were no defined borders, but it was quite solid.  I perceived it as an out-of- focus image like  a silent swirl.
  
  This presence spoke to me without words and invited me to stay a while in this place. I responded angrily because I didn't want to stay there with him. This presence then punched me and I began to fall to some truly horrible places. I passed through at least three horrible places that were horrendous and strange. I was still angry, so yelled so the presence could hear me, 'I am not frightened! Is that all you have got?' I passed through a battle where the bodies were shredded like a pulp of bones and blood. The second place was like a desert of ice, with a violet Sun overhead. The final place was like a volcano erupting. In spite of this, I was aware of my weight and gravity. I still wasn't frightened and I didn't feel pain. Then came the darkness as I felt myself falling even more, like in one fall without end. Just at that moment, I felt a shiver. Then I saw in the background  a light that was growing in size. I asked myself, 'Is this death?' And I surrendered to my fate.

  The next thing I felt was as if my face was put in a mask, my hands in gloves, and my eyes were closed. I felt physical pain. On my face and in my eyes was something thick and cold. As I cleaned myself, this  ended up being a combination of broken windows of a car, and my own blood. I was in the car and in my seat. The people around me had gotten off the bus that I had hit and were screaming, 'He is alive!!'
