hello everyone as dr. Steven Greer I am
here with Maddy Roberts and we&#39;re gonna
have a conversation for about an hour
about what people call in pop culture
area 51 and what Maddie did to organize
a lot of interest in this subject and so
I&#39;d like to thank you for joining us
tonight
Maddy thank you yeah thank you for
having me man it&#39;s gonna be really
interesting to see all these answers
that have questions that have bad
answered yeah yeah how did you get him
interested in the project I mean how
long have you been following it what
trick like kind of triggered me to make
that event was watching the Joe Rogan
podcast where he had bob lazar and
jeremy Korbel on there no after watching
that I decided to just do some more
research online and then I decided to
make a joke on Facebook and it just
completely caught on fire mm-hmm Oh
about storming area 51 yeah
ah got it yeah I&#39;ve actually been there
and but years ago and there used to be a
CNN host called Larry King yeah Larry
King Live so he had me out there at
Nellis Air Force Base so called area 51
on a set just outside the base and so it
was a lot and it was filmed with the
backdrop was the Nellis range and area
51 and it was a pretty cool show and it
was actually the most watched special he
had ever done and this was a long time
ago this was 1994 oh yeah I guess before
you were born maybe I don&#39;t know I&#39;m
just teasing but it was great and and
you wanted this stories I like telling
about that is in the green room after
the show but you know which is where you
go before after a show I was very King
and during the show I he had asked me he
said well what is the president know
about this and at that time it was Bill
Clinton and I said what I really
can&#39;t comment on that shouldn&#39;t comment
on that you should ask the president cuz
he just have the president on his show a
lot yeah would you be able to comment on
that now though and yeah I will because
what had happened is that he said he
said well what does that mean and there
were no words this is where were being
filmed and there was a nuclear physicist
on the show with me on the stage and he
says what do you mean I said well it
means you should ask the President and
not me
and then so we in the after the show
Larry said what the hell were you
talking about yeah why did you
I stood cause I put the briefing
together for Bill Clinton and had
briefed in within the past 12 months of
when that show was aired I had briefed
his first CIA director personally
privately and his the CIA directors name
was our james Woolsey and at that time I
was doing them very much quietly because
I&#39;m an emergency doctor I was doing this
in my spare time because I had contacts
and it put together a briefing document
which we called the best available
evidence that dealt with all the
evidence related to UFOs
extraterrestrial intelligence covert
programs I mean it was a very serious
you know 500 and some page document that
you we&#39;d put together but I was still in
the process so I said I I told Larry he
said she said you should have said that
on the show I said I can it would have
burned all my bridges but now I can talk
about it because that was a long time
ago yeah it&#39;s been a minute so actually
the briefing for the CIA director was on
December 13th 1993 so as you know
Clinton took office in January of 93 yes
and so and so it goes but we actually
had did that show right there at so
called area 51 out of the desert near
the little alien there again it was
hilarious but he we had a good time and
your subsequent
you know I already knew what was at that
facility but since then I&#39;ve got a great
deal more information so I know you
probably have a lot of questions because
you know you organized that whole
movement which acuto&#39;s to you for
getting so many people interested I
think it&#39;s awesome frankly we need more
folks like you here that get the word
out accidentally made it popular to talk
about aliens which is really cool yeah
that&#39;s something a lot of people might
say yeah yeah that&#39;s great though having
been out there are you familiar with
Georgia
oh yeah I mean I knew those guys back
when that happened and also there&#39;s a
fellow you know Bob Lazar
and that never I remember the reporters
and Bob Lazar was only there for a very
short time yeah and he was had a limited
access so the people I have in my team
are some folks who&#39;ve worked that system
for you know been in the facility for a
decade or more excetera and so on so at
this point the disclosure project which
I found it in the 90s now has about 980
mine owner military whistleblowers and
people like Lazar who&#39;ve been in those
projects not just that at that facility
but at all of them and not just
domestically but in Great Britain and
Australia and other countries so would
you say total other dozens and their
important ones one thing about this
facility that you&#39;re referring to area
51 which by the way is the number on a
grid over over the big huge Nellis and
the Nevada Test range is what it&#39;s
called properly and Nellis Air Force
Base so you have no US Air Force Base
you have the Nevada Test range where a
lot of nuclear tests went on and there&#39;s
a part of that huge area of the desert
and the grid it&#39;s a whole bunch of
different grids and the grid where a lot
of the sensitive material are known are
in that area 51
but that&#39;s mom&#39;s right yeah well the one
that the really sensitive facilities are
s 4 s 9 s 12 pollute Mesa groom Lake and
those facilities the ones that are
related to extraterrestrial devices that
are studied all of those are underground
so would you say oh no hundreds to
thousands of feet very deep underground
they&#39;re not 2030 feet there that&#39;s a big
project and they&#39;re connected to tunnels
from there that connect to Edwards Air
Force Base out in the high desert of
California and connect out to other
facilities all underground so those
systems travel at enormous speeds I know
people who&#39;ve gone underground at
Edwards and a few minutes later surface
at the Nevada range
Wow yes very anchors these are very fast
underground transport systems and there
are these are honeycombed all through
various places in the United States and
a number of these classified properly
turned unacknowledged special access
project facilities are connected to each
other
and even in this area where I live
there&#39;s a place in a mountain north of
me here that&#39;s where the continuity of
government is run where if there&#39;s for
example a nuclear bomb goes off in DC
and wipes out the entire government the
24 hours a day there&#39;s an underground
facility where there are people who are
placeholders for the president vice
president all the cabinet members
operating underground that way we stop
the government in case of a big city
happens yeah so and that&#39;s been in
existence since at least the 50s or 60s
so that&#39;s yeah well it&#39;s for that and
other things I mean who knows and you
know what a lot of people don&#39;t
understand about that the the Nellis
facility is that&#39;s an old facility the
really cool
state-of-the-art stuff is near Dugway in
Utah out in the desert
the Dugway proving grounds and there&#39;s a
massive underground facility it&#39;s newer
probably even older of course than the
facility at in Nevada so-called area 51
is the wright-patterson Air Force Base
in Ohio where a lot of the material from
Roswell was taken and that that that
facility is quite old it was the old
airforce foreign technology division
facilities yes that was one of the
original facilities but the Nevada range
was a very old one as well as this Los
Alamos and there&#39;s a facility out in
Arizona near tombstone where Army
Intelligence headquarters is at Fort
Huachuca and there&#39;s a large underground
complex there there are nine separate
well I have a man who work in that
facility some years ago and there were
nine extraterrestrial vehicles
underground and an area where they had
autopsy at various et bodies that were
in storage in permanent storage and that
he had worked in that facility but
that&#39;s out in the eastern Arizona desert
near Fort Huachuca a lot people realize
that&#39;s that&#39;s the headquarters for Army
Intelligence is there okay why do you
think I know you brush up on this in the
new movie but why do you think that the
government has kind of kept us all
secret you think you believe it&#39;s to
push an agenda for it yeah well this is
you know for folks listening close
encounter so the fifth kind came out
about a month ago a little over and it&#39;s
you know it&#39;s number one on all the
platforms right now it&#39;s a it&#39;s a movie
that the first part of which deals with
the secret agenda of why the government
has maintained secrecy but what they&#39;re
planning to do and that has to do with
the reason I never used the word alien
by the way is that most people don&#39;t
know whether you&#39;re talking about an et
are some
from Guatemala or Rodwell or something
from another dimension
so most people in this UFO space when
they use the word alien they don&#39;t
understand that they&#39;re usually talking
about a non extraterrestrial
interdimensional being that they&#39;ve had
an experience with so it&#39;s it&#39;s complex
and and and the problem with the term
like alien it&#39;s sort of a catch-all and
it doesn&#39;t really mean anything
now most people use it thinking ET but
in reality it&#39;s become something that&#39;s
used to describe all kinds of phenomenon
like that that showed a stranger things
yeah basically based on stuff that
happened at Montauk which is a facility
out on eastern part of Long Island and
you know so that&#39;s that&#39;s why I&#39;m very
specific when I&#39;m talking about
extraterrestrial biological entities or
EB es or evens there are those that have
been stored also at so-called area 51
now there&#39;s two conjures a big
horseshoe-shaped
of underground facility that is
connected to the et research project
studying the this the craft their
propulsion systems all that and then
there are some above-ground facilities
that are the so called a rvs alien
reproduction vehicles which are the
man-made UFOs which is usually what
people please zipping around I&#39;m
questioning whether the pentagon footage
that was officially confirmed this a
couple weeks ago released and all over
the news of those jet fighters chasing
those UFOs off to California coast
yeah knows that that actually may be one
of ours were chasing but the people who
are in the conventional military Air
Force Navy even conventional CIA in
Pentagon intelligence would not be read
into or briefed
on the fact that we have things that
move like that those are highly
classified and so those are also a
number of them are based at so called
area 51 so you have both man-made and I
have this wonderful document is very
interesting
I&#39;ll just show it all that people can
see it it&#39;s actually in my book
unacknowledged but it&#39;s signed by look
at the name and look at the letterhead
it&#39;s then rich Wow
the Lockheed skunk works and this is
dated July 21st 1986 and he states in
this document that there are two types
of view of what people call UFOs
extraterrestrial and ours so you know
that was you know what 34 years ago
almost so we have had man-made things
that look like UFOs functional since
around the mid-1950s
how would you say a conventional craft
works they&#39;re using very high voltage
systems VH being it&#39;s called that causes
an electromagnetic field that alters the
the matter of say a spacecraft and
everyone on it in a way that it loses
mass so you have to get into spin theory
and a lot of advanced concepts and
physics which is this is not the place
for that yeah but but basically what it
does is a very high voltage system at a
certain resonance certain cycles per
second can cause something that&#39;s a
solid object like this this phone to
become lighter than air and it actually
causes what&#39;s called mass cancellation
so these are called that the pop culture
we call it antigravity it&#39;s not actually
anti-gravity its electromagnet or a bit
eccentric magnetic field applied in a
certain area around a crab
than within it causes the craft and
everyone on board to become without mass
now if it becomes a zero mass it
disappears in front of you d
materializes okay so if it&#39;s partially
affected it can move at enormous speed
so that&#39;s why you can see these objects
moving at two 300,000 miles per hour and
make a right-hand turn without killing
everyone on board because it&#39;s
controlling for one gravitational field
no matter how it&#39;s moving because when
the internal if you&#39;re on the craft it
actually feels like a normal
gravitational field but the object is
moving through the atmosphere or if it
goes into space an enormous velocity and
can move right up straight down left and
right no inertia with no pulling like
you would in a jet plane or a car or
something because it makes its own
gravity so it&#39;d just be like me sitting
in this chair and moving over there
exactly so it&#39;s good they can correct
for that out to come a long time to get
it that developed for man-made ones now
interstellar vehicles of course do this
routinely and they&#39;re going beyond the
speed of light through other dimensions
and the difficulty that people have with
this subject is that they will see a
phenomenon and they don&#39;t if they&#39;re not
don&#39;t have enough information to know
whether they&#39;re seeing an ET object or a
man-made UFO ya know yeah you have to
know what to look for I&#39;ll give your
audience like a little little tip if
there are any structural parts where
there&#39;s a seam a rivet bolt apart it&#39;s
man-made okay interstellar ones are
utterly and completely seamless you
can&#39;t even see how you could get in or
out of one they are without and so and
there&#39;s a whole physics behind these how
these objects are manufactured that
would be your nice straight Harrods
toward a curl if
so getting into this but I don&#39;t have
enough hair to curl anymore but yeah
yeah you have clear dude so I think
that&#39;s that&#39;s a really interesting thing
that to sort of contemplate the whole
movie the whole premise of Close
Encounters of the fifth kind which I
hope you guys will look at have you seen
it yet
yeah just this morning
oh great I really like how it kind of
focuses on the spirituality of
everything and how they&#39;re almost extra
dimensional beings in a way mm-hmm well
we all are yes that&#39;s the other thing
people think that&#39;s so alien humans are
interdimensional beings here&#39;s the proof
you can sit in your room there and
quietly Center your consciousness and
travel in consciousness to another place
you can have a lucid dream where you
fall asleep at night and you can see a
distant place or a distant point in time
in the future so that&#39;s what a lucid
precognitive dream is and you want to
know why that little area of the area 51
is called dreamland i would actually
very curious about that yeah it&#39;s not
known by a lot of people so when they
were testing these systems and they had
human pilots human beings in these test
systems when they hit a certain resonant
field where the object could quote D
materialize and teleport move the
experience of it is as if you were in a
hyper lucid dream for the or the
physical it&#39;s like you physically now
imagine your whole physical body and
with your body of light as it were your
spiritual body shifting into that sort
of lucid dream world that you see in a
really clear flying dream like that yeah
that was sort of the subjective
experience and I know some men who were
early
test pilots of these objects and it&#39;s
quite interesting because it is very
much it&#39;s very dreamy even though it&#39;s a
physics now there&#39;s a science and
physics behind it that you have to
understand it isn&#39;t hocus-pocus and and
so and of course we understand that very
well now people work with this a long
time but it helps it to understand you
know if you understand the spiritual
consciousness and meditation and the
body of light and the ability to remote
view distant places you you&#39;re gonna
start going a long way to understanding
how the interstellar actual ET
civilizations are travelling
communicating etc because we always
think that everything is separate in
reality you and I are sitting in our
physical bodies on a 3d planet but we
also have our conscious being within
ourselves our body of light and our
consciousness and all of that is
integrated into a singularity of the
field of unbounded conscious existence
and you are the entire cosmos if you go
out tonight look at the Stars
everything you&#39;re looking at is actually
the field of consciousness resonating as
a star or a photon or a tree or your
body it&#39;s all consciousness 100% but
it&#39;s resonating at a frequency that
materializes whatever it is whatever how
would you say that you kind of came to
understanding that well I came to
understand that cuz I experienced it
when I was 17 I got very sick and I died
and when I died I had an experience of
these other dimensions very very clearly
and it was beautiful and when I came
back I decided you know what I need to
learn to meditate and figure out what&#39;s
going on here so I my 18th birthday I
learned meditation and began to have
this experience with a lot and then a
few months later you know that I what I
recount briefly in this movie Close
Encounters of the fifth kind I were
going to mountain up in North Carolina
and
was so right before sunset saw this ET
craft that I had seen when I was 8 or 9
same thing it looked like the same and
it was there and it literally didn&#39;t
move off it was materialized and then
dematerialized like to dawn I went oh
that&#39;s cool they&#39;re back I was 18 I
don&#39;t think so I sit down I&#39;m meditating
it sense that on the top of this 5,000
some foot mountain up in the Blue Ridge
Mountains in North Carolina and I go
into that deep meditative state of
Samadhi this heard of the unbounded
consciousness field state and it was a
long meditation I didn&#39;t came out of it
it was pitch dark and the whole Milky
Way galaxy was above my head and I
looked up and it was a like it was a
voice that emerged from space that said
Behold what a beautiful universe God has
made and at that I went straight back in
that plate when I died and when I had
died I had become you know sort of head
this a cosmic consciousness experience
of the entire cosmos as me this awake be
me and my little what was I is that
would you consider well I mean is it&#39;s
any other terms are loaded but it&#39;s the
unbounded aspect of the cosmic mind the
cosmic being though and everyone can
experience that you don&#39;t have to drop
dead to do it I happen to but I think
it&#39;s because I was raised in a way that
we didn&#39;t understand any of this I mean
I was not raised in a family that
discussed these things so what happened
was that then you know I turned and
there was a Ikki craft right below the
crest of the hill and there was an ET
beam that touched me on my right
shoulder
and I D materialize and ended up on the
craft and developed a Close Encounters
of the fifth kind protocols and you know
I was 18 I didn&#39;t know what I was ever
going to do with them of course here we
are but it led me onto this path and it
was really interesting but it was all
centered in understanding the science of
consciousness which you know about 2/3
of the movie Close Encounters of the
fifth time
is dealing with higher states of
consciousness meditation and how the
conscious field can affect matter and
random number generators and
communication systems because the big
secret the intelligence community
doesn&#39;t want anyone to know is that we
don&#39;t need to storm area 51 physically
we can just go there in our
consciousness that&#39;s interesting so is
that is that what you could say that you
that would be your method of storming
area 51 well that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done and
we go every we can go anywhere we want
to go now you know let&#39;s talk about the
facility in 3d for a moment what I heard
this concept storm area 51 I said law at
mercy people were stepping into here
because this is this is gonna be bad
news and I gave you a little bit of
context back in 2009 when Barack Obama
became president I was asked to put
together a brief team document for him
and I&#39;m gonna show you a document that&#39;s
the very first top-secret document that
was on that stack of documents for the
president but who were the guy who is
sort of a bagman for the CIA who was a
kind of a wild guy I mean he was like a
contractor and someone at the agency
wanted me to sort of include this guy in
some of the information for the
president for this briefing and he said
look we need to put in there that the
president obama should storm area 51 and
seize those facilities that he&#39;s being
denied access to because if you saw the
movie unacknowledged it&#39;s all in the
place you you know that the president is
usually not given access to this level
of information yeah which is why the
default desertin has been us putting
information together for these
presidents that since Clinton
but this guy literally wanted me to
recommend that the president at that
time Obama go tactical meaning using
tactical nuclear weapons to take over
area 51 and get it back under legal
constitutional control well out of that
it would have never worked that night
because he didn&#39;t know what I&#39;m about to
tell you since you organized storm area
51 and everyone listening listen very
very carefully first of all the things
that you need to worry about nothing
important is above the surface of the
earth it&#39;s all underground or it&#39;s in
space
number two the underground facility to
get in there there are nuclear bomb
proof blast doors but if anyone were
could be able to breach the area they
have underneath the facility deep
underneath a tactical nuclear weapons
and bigger ones and on top of the
facility on top of the underground
facility very powerful conventional
explosives that are like the
bunker-busting bombs and if anyone let
me finish
if anyone were to penetrate that
facility they would detonate that but
bunker busters on top and the nukes
underneath pancake the whole thing would
collapse and I know this for a personal
fact I know the people who actually
worked on designed the security around
the Sandia National Labs facility
Monsanto the this area in Nevada where
pollute Mesa grimly s3 s4 s12 s9 grim
Lake and so those facilities you&#39;re not
going to get into and and the President
of the United States isn&#39;t going to get
in there so you you cannot now what you
can do there
single person who&#39;s a conscious
intelligent living form of life on earth
which would be humans and dolphins
perhaps and others can enter into a
state of consciousness make contact with
these ETS and Vector them invite them to
come into an area so you know if you
wanted to you could surround the desert
around area 51 make direct contact with
the ETS and there&#39;d be nothing they
could do about it because if you
understand that these civilizations can
appear in various forms they don&#39;t have
to be materialized like a 747 jet liner
they can be around you and in a form
that almost looks like a hologram or an
energy field and they can blip in and
out of this dimension in a fraction of a
second so if you look at the film Close
Encounters of the fifth kind and by the
way people are really into this if you
go to iTunes or Vimeo and you buy the
film you there there are some special
features bonus features one of them is a
collage and it&#39;s like 25 28 minutes of
just one photo and video after another
of these Close Encounters of the fifth
kind that we&#39;ve had happen around the
world where these objects had come in
and they&#39;re amazing because you&#39;ll see
some where the object will be right here
it D materializes it appears here and
you can see them sort of bleed in and
out of space-time so what we&#39;re planning
to do with Close Encounters of the fifth
kind is organize at least 1% of the
world&#39;s population so be around 75 to 80
million people yeah we learn how to make
contact and then just overwhelm the
intelligence community in the military
and that is how we&#39;re gonna storm area
51 and also every other facility we
don&#39;t have to physically go in there we
just bypass them we just say hey we
already know what they have so yeah ours
about what&#39;s in each facility and how
they&#39;re operating and they&#39;re all we
were the police I have over 980
top-secret military corporate
intelligence people who&#39;ve been in these
facilities and programs over the years
and you about once a week a new person
surfaces who contacts me okay so imagine
985 bob was ours
but people who weren&#39;t just there for a
couple weeks but worked for a year years
or a decade or who in those facilities
there&#39;s a lot of people it&#39;s a huge
number or able yeah now not all of them
want to come public the way Bob did and
good for him for doing so however a lot
of them have I think we have about my
youtube channel I think there were like
a few dozen five or six dozen of these
people who&#39;ve been involved over the
years in various ways the ones that are
most intimately involved and most
recently or terrified to come forward
but they certainly have given us enough
information to know what&#39;s where and I
know from doing Close Encounters of the
fifth kind with people all over the
world that every single human being can
go into a quiet state of mind
learn to Remote View or see with their
consciousness where these ET crafts are
and make contact with them and if you do
it in a way that isn&#39;t centered in
superstition and stupid fear-based stuff
and that&#39;s why the whole you asked me
the first part of the movie the reason
we put that in there at the beginning
where we&#39;re exposing this fake alien
threat mr. show that they&#39;re not a
threat well they&#39;re not a threat
I mean look anyone with an IQ over what
50 should figure out that if these were
hostile and we started detonated atomic
weapons in the 40s well all we had were
vacuum tubes and rockets and jets and
stuff they would have completely shut
this debilitation down about 1945 yeah
we haven&#39;t now the flip side of it is
that there there are many many different
et civilizations and there are a number
of them that are involved with what I
call security enforcement which means a
planet like ours that&#39;s primitive
violent warring destroying its biosphere
weapons of mass destruction we&#39;re going
into space with weapon on satellites
that are killer satellites they don&#39;t
want us banging around out and space too
far and so those those are trying to
keep things under control until we
become peaceful and you know this idea
of a level one civilization where we&#39;re
peaceful we&#39;re not killing each other
we&#39;re not destroying the biosphere we
have free energy zero-point energy and
we&#39;re not open to space like the science
fiction movies with lasers blazing so
human the human endeavor has to
transform from a world of division and
war into one of universal peace okay
that&#39;s the price of admission to going
out in space is that you&#39;re civilized
which we are not would you say that the
ETS are trying to help us down along
that universal path they are but they&#39;re
doing it in a way that is nuanced
obviously if they were to just Larry
King asked I think every talk show host
asked me well their land on the White
House lawn on a Sun boring question but
I go yeah whose Whitehouse ours the one
in Columbia South America that the
Kremlin we don&#39;t have a functional
civilization on this planet yet and
number two if they try to they&#39;d be
blown out of the sky bang yeah all right
so and not with conventional weapons
with electromagnetic weapons that go
faster than the speed of light the one
of the problems and this is a big
problem
is that there are these unacknowledged
special access projects use apps that
are so covert that it&#39;s very rare for a
president or a CI director to be told
about all of them what I&#39;ve tried to do
is put a mosaic together a puzzle
together from hundreds of sources of
people who&#39;ve been in them that are very
credible and come up with an assessment
which is you know what we were doing and
to the extent we can do that to the
public that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing these
documentaries but ultimately we need to
help with the public we need people like
you organizing lots of folks who are you
know I tell anyone between the ages of
maturity and senility which is hopefully
most of us need to come together and
demand that this subject be disclosed
but we have to take the lead and make
contact with these civilizations because
if we if we the people of planet Earth
that are peaceful who are enlightened
who understand the power of the science
of consciousness if we don&#39;t organize to
do this
who is it isn&#39;t gonna be the president
it&#39;s not gonna be the UN
secretary-general I&#39;ve briefed all these
sort of people and they don&#39;t you know
they don&#39;t want to touch this with a
ten-foot pole because it&#39;s Bill
Clinton&#39;s best friend said to me after I
put this briefing together for him he
said we&#39;re convinced the president will
be assassinated like Jack Kennedy if he
pushes on this and so of course I asked
well well then what the hell do you want
me to do I&#39;m an emergency doctor I&#39;m an
ER doctor
easy yeah but we think you can do it and
what he really meant me I looked him
right in the eye that&#39;s really what
you&#39;re saying to me is I&#39;m expendable
and it doesn&#39;t matter if they kill me
because I&#39;m a nobody I&#39;m not a
significant figure at all and if I get
rubbed out it doesn&#39;t matter but you
can&#39;t afford to lose another president
and he looked me right in the eye he
says yes you&#39;re expendable so I always
tell people I&#39;m the throwaway guy it
doesn&#39;t really matter if I am terminated
or not
and I actually view myself that way be
honest with you it&#39;s just you know you
just have to accept that that&#39;s the
possibility and not be afraid of it
which I&#39;m not luckily because I had this
near-death experience and then these
experiences and a higher consciousness
cosmic awareness these buffoons want
right in me
what is that clacking seven I&#39;m not I&#39;m
way strange I wonder if it&#39;s some form
of electronic irritation I&#39;m not
touching anything I promise
it&#39;s some kind of weirdness going on
here it&#39;s like it sounds like someone&#39;s
the control room tapping that we&#39;re
hearing anyway yeah they don&#39;t I know
they don&#39;t want me to talk about a lot
of stuff I you know is that we&#39;re
getting it linked into the pond here so
but so that&#39;s what we need to do you
know at some point I&#39;ve always thought
it&#39;d be awesome to organize a huge
outdoor music conference with a lot of
the big like Katy Perry who follows this
dolphin and God snacked and you know
Steven Tyler of Aerosmith and all these
people who are really following what
we&#39;re doing and organized some big event
where we&#39;d have you know a few hundred
thousand people outside and do a master
on tracks if I contact and disclosure
event and then livestream it to another
you know 50 million people I mean that&#39;s
really what we need to do but you know I
don&#39;t have the ability to organize
something like that I&#39;m afraid but yeah
yeah well I have a home in Washington
that that good luck there - yeah I get a
permit on the down the downtown on the
National Mall and organize something
that&#39;d be cool now I mean cool that
because if somebody could organize it if
they&#39;ll build it out come if you build
it out come but I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t
know how to make an event like that
happen maybe maybe in Christos anyway my
point is is that in lieu we could do
this okay let&#39;s do it man I&#39;ll do it
will you do it well be there I&#39;ll bring
a lot of stuff to that and it&#39;ll be so
be bitchin awesome good I&#39;m excited okay
there&#39;s somebody I might my plates
pretty full with what I&#39;m doing it you
can imagine but but this is what
everyone needs to hear the message is
every single person listening to this
and everyone on your channel needs to
understand you don&#39;t need permission
from the President or for me or anyone
to go out and learn how to contact these
civilizations this is part of the of the
sort of the mind control nonsense
everyone thinks that we need some
authority figure like the president to
do
this or the government who needs the
government to do this I mean they&#39;re so
broken and dysfunctional it&#39;s it&#39;s a
completely useless to think that they&#39;re
gonna fix this they can&#39;t do anything
right let me look at what they&#39;ve done
with this crisis they&#39;ve totally bungled
it 100% so 100% bungled at the state
federal level everywhere
so we need as a people as they are a
here&#39;s the reality we have proven that
we&#39;re not alone the universe we&#39;re being
visited the government is completely
dysfunctional but here&#39;s something nice
I&#39;m I live right down the road from
Thomas Jefferson&#39;s home Monticello he
wrote the Declaration of Independence of
course and if we the people we the
people need to organize teams to go out
make contact
you don&#39;t need thousands of people you
can do it with three four or five people
learn how to make contact and we also
have a really cool training program
that&#39;s on an app that we just released
called the cg5 contact app and it&#39;s on
the iTunes and Google stores but it is a
whole program for learning how to remote
view meditate make contact with these
civilizations and form a team infect and
you&#39;ll guide them into where you&#39;re
located and we&#39;re getting reports from
people all over the world who are doing
this where they&#39;re having ET craft and
ET beans appearing with them so if we
can do that let&#39;s just bypass the
government and just fly right over in a
spiritual sense over area 51 and say the
way we&#39;re really gonna storm that
facility isn&#39;t with tactical nuclear
weapons but in the power of
consciousness and people coming together
the power of the this deeper aspect of
ourselves where the the mind whereby
you&#39;re awake and I&#39;m awake as the
physicists are in Schrodinger said the
total number of minds in the universe is
one
it&#39;s a singularity there&#39;s one conscious
mind and it&#39;s basically it&#39;s like if
you&#39;re in a big Cathedral or a great big
building and
there&#39;s light streaming in from all
these different windows or different
shapes and colors where each of us are
like a window with that light shining in
and once we go into a state where we
connect to the source of say that not
just light we can see any place be
anywhere achieve anything and that&#39;s
where you know the power of the
meditative state is is so incredible and
that&#39;s what you know the science of
consciousness you know I don&#39;t know if
you know who dr. Russell Targ is who is
the CIT he was the CIA remote viewer for
23 years org and I he&#39;s a laser
physicist but he was part of a team
doing conscious remote viewing of
distant places using consciousness for
the CIA and I&#39;ve had him on my show and
I said look what and what he had found
is that every single human being can do
this you don&#39;t have to be Ingo Swann or
me or him or anyone else everyone thinks
he we&#39;ve been taught that we&#39;re all just
our own little selves yeah individuals
not connected to some larger field of
consciousness but in reality the science
of consciousness which is what&#39;s in this
documentary Close Encounters of the
fifth kind shows that in fact the
consciousness field is everywhere and
isn&#39;t limited to your skull or your body
and once you Center into that quiet
state of consciousness you can Remote
View on another star system another
galaxy and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re
sitting out together under the stars
doing this meditative process remote
viewing that where these ETS are and
then inviting them to come and that&#39;s
what a close encounter of the fifth kind
is you know it&#39;s when humans initiate
and invite the contact the biggest
problem with people doing is that
they&#39;re scared because the
disinformation if you look at the first
part of this movie you&#39;re referring to
yeah the whole hoaxing of an alien
threat that is the key way they have
controlled the masses because thing
about it if people really believe that
out under the stars and say invite them
in if they do that&#39;s why interesting we
had that air force officers say hey you
know we used to organize these
abductions
we know yeah yeah yeah go look at that
testimony so I have dozens of people who
are on my team who we used who have been
on counterintelligence abduction squads
meaning that they were setting up
scenarios to scare people about aliens
and they were hoaxing cattle mutilations
abductions they were using man-made UFOs
with these weird robotic creatures to
abduct people and convinced them they
were alien abducted but it&#39;s all being
run by the intelligence community and if
it&#39;s a stagecraft they call this like
when you state is like Hollywood staging
an event but it&#39;s intelligence community
zooming and deceiving the public and of
course you know Verner von Braun who
invented the rocket for you Dolph Hitler
on his deathbed you know he&#39;d become
part of the central part of our
aerospace research community in the
United States after World War two you
know he told a member of my team Carol
rosin they&#39;re going to hoax an alien
threat and there isn&#39;t one but they&#39;re
doing all kinds of things to convince
people there is one and that&#39;s what the
whole you know space force is about and
you know all this stuff 99% of the
material on the internet and in movies
and documentaries about UFOs is all
stuff that has been planted out in our
popular culture to scare people and it
emits them that we need to go to war
eventually in space so who&#39;d benefit
from that
nobody well yes the would the elitist
uber elitist cabal running
unacknowledged special access projects
and their sociopathic bedfellows who are
these nasty military-industrial complex
war mongers they&#39;re gonna benefit they
always benefit it&#39;s like when we invaded
Iraq after 9/11 even though it had
nothing to do with 9/11 you know big
operations were making you know a
trillion dollars in taxpayer spending
for a war we didn&#39;t need to have well
imagine that but on a interplanetary
level where they could unite the whole
world around a military fascist regime
fighting some interplanetary threat that
they are staging like Ronald Reagan
touched on in his speech yeah but that&#39;s
that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been doing that
they&#39;ve been setting up the conditions
for that for 70 years and I would say
the vast majority of people who study
this subject had been drinking that
kool-aid and you know that totally
totally brainwashed so that&#39;s why the
first part of the movie deals with this
and I&#39;ll give you a great example the
Air Force intelligence officer that that
was the in charge of at Kirkland Air
Force Base who&#39;s in the movie tells this
account when if you look this up it&#39;s
called the cash Landrum case from 1981 I
believe or 86 it was in the 1980s
outside Houston and there was a object a
UFO that malfunctioned and was being
escorted by helicopters as it descended
but it R it was spewing radioactive
waste on all these innocent people who
became very very sick it turns out that
this man whose testimony we have was the
principal investigator for Air Force
intelligence for this event and he
we have his testimony on camera on tape
where he admits that from so-called area
51 there was an ET craft that they were
trying to test fly and so they couldn&#39;t
get the power of the the energy system
on it to work
so they in a portable nuclear power
plant on this thing that&#39;s a great idea
stupid is [ __ ] right oh they were
putting this on there and there were
four human pilots on it now it&#39;s an ET
craft with a man-made nuclear power plan
on it so they could the propulsion
working and it was flying and then it
had a malfunction on the nuclear part of
it and it started leaking all this
radioactive waste on these innocent
civilians and the Air Force was very
happy for the public to think that that
was a quote UFO but which kind of UFO
well in this case it was both an ET one
man by humans with a manly power plant
that malfunction so it was sort of a
hybrid and it was a disaster but they
were happy for the UFO research
community and the media to report that
this was a UFO that did this and of
course all the xenophobic paranoid Kooks
in the UFO world said the aliens are
attacking us with nuclear waste actually
it was that came out of Nellis Air Force
Base in area 51 and it was a hundred
percent a man-made error but they were
trying to figure out how to fly this et
object on it landed at an Air Force Base
in Texas being escorted by helicopters
and if you look up this case it&#39;s called
the cash Landrum case very well
documented but nobody knew until this
Air Force officer came forward and
admitted that it was us flying it and it
malfunctioned so that&#39;s the kind of
stuff that goes on all the time and you
have more a lot of patience to get to
the bottom of what the truth is and it
takes a lot of work and you need a lot
of corroborating sources from different
places to figure out who&#39;s providing you
false information versus real
information versus they don&#39;t even
really know what they&#39;re talking about
so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult and
that&#39;s been the biggest challenge we&#39;ve
had over the last 30 years of the
disclosure project and doing what we&#39;re
doing but the thing that you can always
count on is that if you go out with some
buddies and friends and learn how to
make contact and do it and one shows up
and you see it with your own eyes or an
et at you know like in the movie there&#39;s
a really cool et that materializes in
our circle in Arizona and yeah here is a
guy who had lost his hearing as a child
completely healed him of the hearing
loss that is so cool we&#39;ve had a lot of
things like that happen so I tell people
you know why wait for the president or
some authority figure that frankly most
of them couldn&#39;t find their ass in a
well lighted room with both hands they
honestly don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know
which way is up on this stuff I tell
people go and find out for yourself
don&#39;t take my word for it don&#39;t take
their word for it do it you know and to
do that though you got to know what
you&#39;re doing a little bit you&#39;ve got to
understand that there&#39;s the science of
consciousness and you need to understand
that you know this thing which you know
we call it smartphone which is a really
a very dumb phone is using radio
frequencies going at the speed of light
yeah why is that a problem because if
you&#39;re from Andromeda galaxy there&#39;s an
ET in the movie called bees ooh that was
a Joshua Tree National Park he was from
Andromeda and I was there I was right
there when the photo was taken and
that&#39;s two and a half million
light-years from here so if you&#39;re
communicating with what we call a
smartphone at the speed of light it
would take two and a half million years
to get a signal from Earth to Andromeda
and say how are you and then another 1/2
million years for the signal to come
back so it&#39;s five million years they
hello how are you fine how are you that
exchange would take five million years
earth you that&#39;s why we know that these
the interstellar
civilizations are using technology way
beyond the speed of light but that are
also interfacing with custom thought so
in other words it&#39;s like Neil on-month
working on a company as neuro-link yeah
I don&#39;t know if someone&#39;s typing I&#39;m
hearing them type we&#39;re this yeah it&#39;s
really strange so when they&#39;re when
we&#39;re communicating you&#39;re communicating
with electronic systems but there is
system for contacting conscious thought
it&#39;s really cool so do you think to your
computer it turns on ilan yeah it&#39;s
really cool but that&#39;s actually why
we&#39;re able to do project and fall to
make contacts it&#39;s their primary
communication is consciousness it&#39;s
really amazing that&#39;s that&#39;s
mind-blowing to think about yeah so I
don&#39;t you have some more questions and
I&#39;ve just been sort of like wrapping on
I think we pretty much covered all the
bases I wanted to hit all my answers
about area 51 how we possibly storm it
just a whole bunch of different things
that we&#39;re in like we&#39;re gonna storm it
by coming together as a people in
consciousness and higher consciousness
making contact and hey if we can do a
world cultural music event that would be
a weekend event that&#39;d be so cool I
wanted to do it for years I&#39;ve just
never had the ability to organize it and
pull it off but either probably people
who can who are I&#39;ve got the guys yeah
I&#39;m just a country doctor from Virginia
I don&#39;t I can&#39;t pull off something like
that but there are probably organizers
who can it be an amazing event and I I
they should be the contact and
disclosure music festival is what I
would conceive of it as where we would
have to millions and millions of people
wired in through the internet and
hundreds of thousands of people at a
place with the most amazing music lineup
in the world you know bringing people
together with these kind
ceps hold off I mean over the course of
11 days we gathered 12,500 people in
Vegas so we&#39;ll see if we can go all the
zero to that and then let&#39;s do it yeah
I&#39;m down 112 thousand I&#39;m just kidding
but yeah be a fun could be a really fun
thing to do and so anyway I want to
thank you for your you know what you&#39;re
doing raising consciousness with people
we need a lot of people who are in the
you know 15 year old to 40 year old
demographic to really get educated on
this and figure out I had a contact with
an et I haven&#39;t shared this publicly I
was sort of know if I should I was at my
place in DC and it was in the wee hours
of the morning and an actual et appeared
in the bedroom and specifically said
because you know I&#39;m getting up there in
years I was a young doctor in my 30s
when I started this project now next
month I&#39;ll be 65 and I have four kids
and a 10th grandchild on the way and all
that and you know I&#39;m not long for them
who knows how long I&#39;ll live but but the
each he turned to me and said you need
to have aborted you have to reach young
people and specifically gave me that 15
to like 30-some year old range and they
have to know about that and it was like
this very cool thing so that&#39;s why I
thought it was so cool to someone of
your age you know sort of this picked up
the mantle and ran with this thing so it
just it all works out beautifully yeah
it&#39;s time to do that
well thank you for you know coming on I
enjoyed it hopefully we can meet at some
point when they when the the police
state lets us out of our homes let&#39;s do
it
alright well thank you yeah and so just
just put a shout out to your group about
what we&#39;re doing and I mean we just need
to all come together as a people and and
creat you know the end of the film is so
beautiful because it&#39;s recounting when
Colonel Corso met the et there in white
Sam and and it was a brash young
military guy and
the eat he was asking for their help and
he said what&#39;s unit for me and the et
goes a new world if you can take that
was 1956 I was one year old and I tell
people you know what 60 years later or
whatever we need to take it we need to
move on and move on to enlighten
civilization that our destiny is to
become interstellar that&#39;s it that&#39;s a
hell of a goal and I think we could
reach it we&#39;re gonna do it absolutely
alright thank you guys and thanks all
the people who have been helping in the
background there and we&#39;ll hopefully
meet soon absolutely thank you all right
bye
