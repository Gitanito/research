THE OPENING OF THE THIRD EYE
This painting of the head of Minerva shows,
in part, the activities of the pineal gland and
the pituitary body at the time of the phenom­
enon commonly termed "the opening of the
Third Eye." The Kundalini fire is seen rising
upward through the spinal canal into the
pons of the medulla oblongata. The golden
light radiating from the base of the brain,
at the back, gradually increases in size and
intensity until it forms the nimbus, or halo, of
the saint. The pituitary body is here shown
surrounded by an elliptic rose aura. The
pineal gland-the Third Eye of the Mysteries
-is here depicted as blue in color and sur­
rounded by a radiating blue aura. In real­
ity, however, this aura includes within itself
all the colors of the spectrum, but blue de­
cidedly predominates. The tiny vibrating fin­
ger on the pineal gland points directly toward
the pituitary body. This finger, vibrating
at a very high rate of speed, is the actual
cause of true spiritual illumination.
AN ESSAY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL
PRINCIPLES OF OPERATIVE
OCCULTISM
BY MANLY P. HALL
To Accompany Three Oil Paintings by Mihran
K. Serailian.
. .
The question is asked, "What must I do to
unfold the divine powers latent within my­
self?" While it is not possible to give a direct
answer to this question, we may cast some
light on the subject by refining the fundamen­
tal principles upon which the Mystery Schools
of all ages were established as institutions of
philosophic, ethical, and religious culture.
The Schools of the Mysteries are composed
of illumined men and women who have been
accepted into the company of the Immortals.
To reach this eX:alted position requires an al­
most inconceivable amount of preparatory la­
bor; for if man would associate with these ad­
vanced types of humanity, he must raise him­
self to their level.
Realizing that nothing is more dangerous
than the indiscriminate circulation of occult
secrets, the Mysteries established their schools
[ 5.]
for the purpose of concealing rather than re­
vealing knowledge. They were the original
and sole custodians of all the divine arts and
sciences, the secret keys to which they revealed
only to those whom they considered qualified
to receive them. Inasmuch as man's power
increases with his knowledge, the secrets of
Nature's finer forces cannot be revealed to
him until he has passed through these Mys­
teries, which test him as to his motive and de­
mand certain standards of moral and philo­
sophic excellence.
Before the candidate is in a position to begin
his studies in occult philosophy (which, if suc­
cessfully completed, will result in discipleship
and final admission into the Mysteries) he
must first lay the ground-work by familiariz­
ing himself with certain systems of ethics and
gain at least reasonable proficiency in several
material arts and sciences.
1. The candidate must realize the value of
education. While the ignorant person may
be capable of spiritual growth, the fact remains
that man's ethical progress is seriously retarded
through ignorance of the material arts and
sciences. Not realizing the great value of dis­
cipline, many students of the occult sciences
ridicule modern educational systems, which ex­
cel because they discipline the mind. Learn­
ing how to study is a prerequisite to effective
[6]
studying. Before it is possible to think, it is
necessary to train the mind in reason, con­
tinuity, and logic-the essentials of thought.
In the last analysis, all the so-called material
arts and sciences are reflections of the Secret
Wisdom. A man with an understanding of
mathematics cannot help but know more of
the Divine Plan than one without. Pythag­
oras demanded proficiency in music, mathemat­
ics, and astronomy of all candidates seeking
admission into his school.
Before a candidate can honestly seek ad­
mission to the Temple of Wisdom, he must
prepare his offerings and bring them to the
Temple. The only possible offering which he
can make is himself, and this offering is ac­
ceptable only when it is usable for the dissem­
ination of wisdom. The more nearly perfect
that vehicle is, the greater its usefulness. If
able to speak a dozen languages, he has a de­
cided asset. If skilled in chemistry, gifted in
oratory, clear in thought, he has valuable tal­
ents which can be quickly turned to the service
of mankind. If the candidate, regardless of
his sincerity, presents himself at the door of
the Temple ignorant and untrained, it is first
necessary to equip him for his work. This
preparatory training requires years. A person
willing to consecrate himself unselfishly to the
service of God-the first requisite for entrance
[ 7]
into the Temple-should certainly be willing
first to educate himself by learning what the
material world has to teach. He must never
seek for the Masters of Wisdom until he has
something of real value to offer them, for use­
fulness is to a great measure limited by intelli­
gence.
2. The candidate must understand the im­
portance of continuity. The curse of the mod­
ern world is its inability to finish the enter­
prises which it begins. As a child starts several
things
but
completes none of them, so the
child-mind vacillates from one activity to
another. Failure to achieve is the result of
scattering the power of the mind over too
great an area of endeavor. Man can cultivate
no quality more essential to his spiritual well­
being than that of finishing what he begins.
Success can never be achieved in the material
world without at least a reasonable develop­
ment of the power of continuity. In matters
pertaining to occultism, the same is true. A
person who studies several lines of philosophy
may call himself broadminded, but if he carry
none of these lines to a successful culmination
he is, in reality, "scatter-brained." Again and
again such a person turns off ·and tries a new
road, when just a few more steps upon the
old one would have brought him within sight
of achievement.
[8]
3. The candidate must recognize his debt
to society. If in his zeal to unfold his spirit­
ual nature he neglects those daily labors which
have been assigned to him in the material
world, he can never hope to attain true spirit­
uality. Each individual born into the physical
world has obligations which if not assumed
by him must be carried by others. Among the
Hindus, for example, the debt which the Brah­
min owes to the race that produces him is
very keenly felt. This debt is not paid until
a son is born to him and he has lavished upon
it the parental regard and care which he pre­
viously received from his parents.
Woe to those who neglect their fellow crea­
tures to serve their God! In this world it is
necessary first to earn the right to leisure time
which is essential for personal improvement.
The chief reason why people are always con­
fronted by problems is that they are ever seek­
ing to evade problems. So many say, "Life
is just one difficulty after another," when, in
reality, it is the same difficulty presenting it­
self again and again, because it is not mastered.
The candidate is urged to face and settle each
problem of his life. In this way perplexities
are eliminated and more leisure is available
for ethical progress. The prosaic duties of
daily life are the elements out of which charac­
ter is built, and those unable to cope with them
[ 9]
are as useless in things spiritual as they are in
things material.
Occult development is an exceedingly slow
process. The results of the time and energy
expended are often imperceptible. This brings
discouragement; the candidate gives up the
struggle, considering the task before him a
hopeless one. Discouragement is one of the
temptations placed in the way of the candidate
by the Mysteries, for in spiritual matters he
who can be discouraged is not worthy of en­
couragement. It is by means of discourage­
ment that mediocre minds are eliminated. Rec­
ognizing the difficulty of preserving men­
tal continuity, the Mysteries demand it of their
candidates, for only those who year after year
struggle on to the single goal, wandering in
darkness but with one-pointedness and perfect
faith, are considered worthy to enter the Tem­
ple-the House of the Immortals.
4. The candidate must realize the import­
ance of motive. An analysis of motives gen­
erally demonstrates them to be basically selfish,
regardless of how unselfish they may appear.
Only those who assume the study of occultism
with the highest and most unselfish motives
can hope to succeed in this the supreme sci­
ence. In the present age nearly every one has
ulterior motives, most of which center around
the aggrandizement of the individual not-self,
[10]
mistaken for· the Self. We desire power that
we may be recognized as powerful; we desire
wisdom that we may be recognized as wise;
we gravitate about important people in the
hope that we may shine a little with their re­
flected glory; we seek to be virtuous that one
man may say to another, "There goes a godly
person!" To the average person it is incon­
ceivable that greatness should not promenade.
And yet an analysis of the men and women
who have become great-either in spiritual or
material affairs-reveals, in the majority of
cases, humble, retiring individuals whose great­
ness is never offensive. Those who study oc­
cultism, hoping thereby to improve their ma­
terial condition, fail utterly. Before power
can be safely entrusted to man, he must be­
come supremely indifferent to it. Perfect un­
selfishness is perfect consecration to the service
of the One Universal Self.
Before anyone begins a study of the mystic
sciences with the hope that he will add to the
dignity of his position or to the weight of his
coffers, he should consider for a moment the
social, financial, and worldly position of those
who during the ages past have been recog­
nized as exponents of occultism and philoso­
phy. Count Cagliostro, languishing for years
in prison; Marshal Ney, an exile living under
an assumed name; Abbe Villars, murdered for
[11]
writing his Romance of the Gnomes-these are
but a few examples demonstrating the rewards
which the world holds out to those who try
to educate it. In order to serve more effective­
ly, a few initiates (such as Comte de St. Ger­
main and Francis Bacon) were placed in posi­
tions of world power. But with this increased
dignity came increased responsibility. The
crown . of spiritual adeptship is a far heavier
one than the crown of material rulership. The
use of occultism for the gratification of person­
al ends constitutes black magic.
It is for these reasons that the applicant is
asked, "What motive urges you to take up
these arts and sciences? Is it your supreme
and all-ensouling desire to be of unselfish ser­
vice to humanity?" To these questions some
reply, "Gladly will I die for truth." To them
the answer is, "That is not enough.. Will you
live for truth?" A few brief moments and the
act of martyrdom is consummated; a few sec­
onds of pain and the soul of man is beyond the
reach of the.executioner. This is a tremendous
sacrifice-a glorious death. But the daily liv­
ing, surrounded by problems and worries, year
after year of disappointments-this is the su­
preme test of unselfishness. Until the soul can
find perfect joy in giving, perfect companion­
ship in aloneness, perfect sufficiency in die
power of truth, perfect abundance in the grati-
[12]
tude of the few and the scorn of the many­
until such a state is reached the disciple is·not
readv to leave the broad road on which the
world walks and take the thorn-lined path
which leads to conscious immortality.
Years are spent by the Masters testing the
hearts of candidates. Those who begin spirit­
ual unfoldment find difficulties of all kirids
rising before them. The even tenor of human
existence is shattered, temptations of all kinds
confront the seeker, and it is only when he
rises triumphant above them all that he· is us­
able in the great plan of human progress. In
a man of little mind selfishness is a small sin;
should that man develop a great mirid and
control the destinies of thousands, the small
sin (if left unmastered) becomes a great men­
ace. The impotent selfishness of ignorance
becomes the potent tyranny of power.
Occasionally we find persons who, if not in
some way restrained by Nature, would become
archdoers of evil. But Nature, Delilah-like, has
shorn them of their locks. One such case will
suffice to demonstrate the principle: A sar­
donic iconoclast, with a tongue like a two­
edged sword, who ruthlessly-even gleefully
-destroyed hope, love, and faith in the hearts
of others, was struck with paralysis which,
affecting his tongue, made speech a slow and
[13]
painful process. His heart is still filled with
malice; in fact he is more malignant than be­
fore, but his power to injure others has been
taken from him. All men are born with many
faculties and members paralyzed. Some are
filled with malignancy, held in curb only by
their inability to vent their spleen. All hu­
man beings have latent faculties and powers,
but all are not privileged to develop them at
this time. Before it would be safe to loosen
the tongue of the malignant creature who calls
himself a man, it would first be necessary to
transmute the bitterness in his heart.
In a similar manner, before it would be ad­
visable to liberate man from the natural paral­
ysis of ignorance, there should be assurance
that the newly awakened faculties shall be a
blessing to humanity and not a curse. Before
the Masters give man the power to loosen his
tongue, his heart must be purified so that the
power which is given him shall not frustrate
the plan of true spiritual unfoldment. This
is the real reason for the periods of probation­
ship. During these periods the mind and
heart are cleansed of those things which, if
given power of expression, would work evil.
When the supreme forces of Nature are placed
in the hands of the newly raised initiate, his
heart, his mind, and his soul must accept these
gifts with divine humility without thought of
[14]
self, and use them for the greatest good to the
greatest number.
5. The candidate must shun ill kinds of
psychism and phenomena/ism. The funda­
mental purpose of occultism is' not to equip a
disciple with the power to see auras, elemen­
tals, or thought-forms. Nor is it concerned
with the processes of bringing those who have
passed on into communication with bereaved
relatives on the material plane. Occultism is,
first, an ethical philosophy; second, an opera­
tive science. As the candidate obeys the laws
imposed upon him by the Mysteries and as he
is faithful in his discharge of the new duties
which he is assuming, he gradually and se­
quentially unfolds the various parts of him­
self. His faculties become so sensitized that
he is able to see at each step of his growth
that which is essential for him to see and sense
that which is essential for him to sense. Clair­
voyance is an effect and not a cause; it is the
result of certain adjustments of the life and a
gradual regeneration of the bodily parts and
members. True occult growth is so slow that
it is almost imperceptible, the faculties unfold­
ing from within outward like the petals of a
flower. To hasten these natural processes be­
yond a certain point is to endanger the sanity
and health of the candidate.
So-called clairvoyance may take many
[15]
forms. A student may reach a comparatively
high degree of Chelaship and still be unaware
of any extension of sense perception such as is
commonly associated- with spiritual growth,
while a person possessing many - psychic pow­
ers may be totally unfitted even to enter upon
the path of Chelaship. One of the surest signs
of true occult unfoldment is a peculiar exten­
sion of sense perception or of the mental sense
of awareness, which might be called "clair-cog­
nizance." The average person would describe
this condition as a form of mental clarity or
acuteness. Instead of presenting itself through
the organs of vision or hearing, occult cogni­
tion sometimes comes in a purely intellectual
form, the mind becoming actually aware of
occult truths and philosophic verities without
any involvement of the lesser senses.
An example of this is the student who de­
sires to learn the color vibration of a certain in­
visible organ or part of the body. The mind
instantly replies that it is red, without actually
giving any color impression-the information
coming more as words imprinted upon the
mind than in any other form-yet the mind
itself registers no awareness of words spoken
either physically or spiritually. Apparently the
mind of itself announces the color to be red.
In things pertaining to occult philosophy,
this faculty seems to be the particular reward
f16]
(
I
..
of the teacher. If the lay instructor is actually
in contact with the higher worlds he will learn
far more while he is teaching than will those
to whom he is explaining the subjects under
discussion, the "clair-cognizance" revealing
spontaneously that which the faculties of the
mind under normal conditions could not rea­
son out in months. This is the only so-called
psychic faculty the coming of which should
not be viewed with a certain amount of ap­
prehension. The premature development of
clairvoyance and psychism is a serious impedi­
ment to the spiritual growth of the student,
who is all too likely to wander astray in the
byways of the astral plane and end in the blind
alley of transcendentalism.
6. 'The candidate must realize that with
the increase of knowledge there is a propor­
tionate increase of responsibility. With the ac­
quirement of knowledge, the student must ac­
quire the sense of discrimination, so that he
may use most intelligently the information he
has received. Nearly all who take up the study
of occultism eventually become teachers of its
abstruse sciences. It is proper that they should
do this, for as they themselves were instructed
they hut pay their natural debt by becoming
instructors of others. The lay teacher should
realize, however, that he becomes accountable
for the use which others make of the knowl-
[17]
edge he entrusts to them. He cannot shift this
burden on to the Mystery Schools; he must
bear it himself. For this reason he must be
as wise as the gods if he would save himself
from the karmic reactions of the forces which
he has enabled others to set in operation.
In occultism the initiate speaks only for
himself. Unless actually upon an official errand
for the School to which he belongs, he never
makes the esoteric Orders in any way respons­
ible for his individual utterances and actions.
Unless specifically ordered to do so, the emis­
saries of the Mysteries speak only for them­
selves-never for the higher initiates. Those
illumined minds who represent the Schools of
the Mysteries in the world need no heralding,
nor do they require credentials from the in­
visible Brotherhood to which they belong.
Never do they announce themselves, for their
power lies not in their affiliations but in them­
selves. Why should an initiate tell the world
that he is a superman? Unless he demon­
strates it by his actions, the world will not ac­
cept him as such; and if the exceptional quali­
ties of his intellect prove it, the claim is un­
necessary.
All over the world there are hundreds of
individuals and institutions claiming to rep­
resent the secret Schools of the Ancient Wis­
dom. Few of these organizations, and still
[18]
t'
..
fewer of the individuals, can· successfully de­
fend their claims in the face of a critical analy­
sis of their principles and policies. Those dis­
ciples truly consecrated to the service of the
invisible Schools have made it their policy to
refrain from even mentioning the august bod­
ies which they so inadequately represent, until
that time when the invisible Order no longer
could be discredited by their actions. The true
disciple would rather die than compromise his
Master or the School into which he hopes
sometime to be initiated. He can protect the
institution only by assuming personal respons­
ibility for all that he says and does. Then his
faults disgrace no one but himself. Only when
he has reached the point of complete spiritual
illumination does he reveal the source of his
knowledge, and then only to a limited few.
One of the laws of occultism is that in order
to receive, one must give. Those desirous of
greater insight into things spiritual must earn
the right to that broader understanding by the
intelligent use of that knowledge already pos­
sessed. The student-teacher must realize that
he is personally responsible for whatever effects
his theories and doctrines may have upon the
minds and bodies of others. By instruction we
actually change the course of others' lives; we
direct them into new channels of mental and
physical activity; we change the tenor of their
[19]
Ii'
1!1
!uti
i
�.I
I
existence. If directly or indirectly these change
are not beneficial to them, we who gave them
the knowledge become responsible before the
gods for the results of our indiscretion.
In a similar manner, those who teach us are
responsible for our actions and the use we
make of the wisdom they have shared with
us. Hence, when the disciple fails, it is the
Master who suffers most. Most of all, we are
responsible if we place in the hands of those
unfitted to receive it that knowledge of Na­
ture's forces which enables one person to injure
another. If we are not mentally developed to
that point where we can determine beforehand,
with a reasonable amount of certainty, the in­
tegrity of the person to whom we intend to
reveal occult secrets, we are not far enough
advanced to possess such secrets ourselves.
In justice to himself, therefore, no one
should be in a hurry to go forth serving hu­
manity, lest in his impetuosity he destroy not
only others but himself with them. The
groundwork should be laid first, but when such
a one feels that he is equipped to disseminate
a message, he should do it reverently, with
deep consideration and no little trepidation,
saying to himself: "I am responsible from now
on for the use and interpretation placed by
others upon the words that come out of my
mouth. Therefore, I will choose them with
[20]
'
..,
care, consider them in the light of my truest
and highest intelligence, and send forth with
each a prayer that it shall serve only the cause
of good. I will not claim to be anything or
anyone, but let my works speak for me, for 'I
am only as great as my works. If it be the will
of the Masters that I should in time reach an
exalted position as their messenger, I will then
(if they so desire it) be their chosen and au­
thorized mouthpiece. But until the day of
that supreme achievement if a man should ask
me who I am, I shall answer that I am a
voice crying in the wilderness. If he should
ask who sent me, I shall answer that my soul
sent me. If he should ask by what authority
I teach men, I shall answer that I am my own
authority. If he should ask what message I
bring, I shall answer that I bring no message,
but only interpret according to my light that
message which is eternally here. And if he
should ask, 'What reward have we if we fol­
low you?' I shall answer that the accomplish­
ment of labor is the reward of labor."
7. The candidate must maintain a con­
structive mental attitude. All thinking people
are dissatisfied with existing conditions. They
also realize that the universe is ruled by the
Law of Cause and Effect, and that in order to
improve affairs it is first necessary to establish
those remedial and corrective causes the nat-
[21]
ural results of which will be universal peace
and enlightenment. It is imperative that we
accept things as we find them in this world;
and instead of complaining or criticizing if
they are not in accordance with our desires,
let us set about with diligence and intelligence
to create newer and better conditions. If his
mind be soured or his· nature be established
in the habit of complaining, the prospective
candidate bars himself from the service of the
Masters.
·
Since life is so serious an affair, it has well
been said that the sense of humor is a saving
grace. We become useless to our fellow crea­
tures if we permit ourselves to be oppressed by
the weight of the world's woe. It is a mistake
to believe that seriousness can take the place
of integrity. There is no substitute for the hap­
py smile or the normal, healthy attitude toward
the problems of life. The candidate need not
cultivate thoughtless optimism but rather that
attitude of mind which sees the hand of God
in everything and realizes that all things are
working together for the ultimate good of
each. The iconoclast is a useful and important
member of society, but he never attains the
highest state of usefulness because his mind is
on a tangent.
Man is much like an apple: some mellow
with age, while others rot; some people are
[22]
deepened and sweetened by experience, while
others are hopelessly soured. Those who be­
come soured have failed utterly. They are
mentally diseased and incapable of construc­
tive thinking. Sourness is often the result of
self-pity, one of the most subtle and terrible
forms of egotism. It is egotism that makes
people actually believe that they are so impor­
tant that Nature singles them out to heap in­
firmities upon them. No one who pities him­
self has any inherent sense of justice. With­
out a perfect faith in a natural justice, man
cannot attain the heights of either philosophy
or religion. Make it one of the fundamental
rules of your life that you will never be sorry
for yourself. If you become the slave of self­
pity, you will soon become a legitimate object
of pity on the part of intelligent people.
These seven cardinal requirements therefore
constitute the ethical foundation of occultism.
Without consecration of the life to the attain»
ment of proficiency in these qualities of char­
acter, it is useless to go on-if such a thing
were possible. The foundation must come
first. Most of he failures in mysticism and
philosophy result from neglect of the ethical
basis. The superstructure of esotericism must
be raised upon the solid rock of virtue and in­
tegrity, for without this foundation it inevit­
ably falls.
[23]
Man cannot perpare himself for philosophic
pursuits in a few weeks or even a few years.
He must build slowly and solidly, realizing
that one step properly taken is worth many
taken haphazard and without direction. When
the general self-improvement is fairly well ad­
vanced, it is then time for the student to pre­
pare himself along certain special lines of en­
deavor which will peculiarly fit him for occult
attainment. This is not the first step but the
second, and is not to be taken until the initial
groundwork has been thoroughly established.
With each advancing step the candidate
finds the standards of life more exacting and
111 difficult of attainment, with deviation from
11
these ideals productive of ever�increasing sor­
row and suffering. The requirements of the
law for the initiate are much more strict than
for the average individual, for the initiate can
possess his transcendent powers only by sacri­
ficing everything else. The would-be disciple
of the Ancient Wisdom, after having schooled
himself in the seven principles described above,
must now turn his attention to the choice of
that particular line of endeavor and that par­
ticular School of the Mysteries in which he
feels he will be most useful. The qualities
previously developed by the first ethical train­
ing are now tested, for only by their aid can
[24]
the selection be intelligently made. While the
path of accomplishment differs in each School,
all the Mystery Schools teach the same funda­
mental doctrines and ultimately attain the same
results.
Let us suppose that you have chosen one of
the Eastern Schools. Before you can actually
begin your studies, you must familiarize your­
self with the particular ethical code which it
disseminates. The School will educate you in
certain concepts and attitudes which, when
incorporated into your life, have a marked
effect upon the invisible nature. Only when
these effects reach a certain point is it safe for
you to begin any special system of so-called
spiritual development. Although the seven­
fold cardinal requirements are applicable to
persons in any walk of life (whether religious­
ly or atheistically inclined), the more advanced
requirements are concerned directly with the
individual need of the student. This more
advanced code is open to the consideration of
all who have conducted themselves worthily
according to the primary requirements. But
woe to those who, ignorant, selfish, and other­
wise unql,lalified, dabble in any form of occult
science without first overcoming the more im­
portant faults of the lower nature I The proof
of man's sincerity is his willingness to sacrifice,
and the occult student must sacrifice his own
[25]
lower nature if he would enter the Temple of
Wisdom.
Again and again, the student of occult phil­
osophy deplores the fact that he cannot dis­
criminate between the true and the false. He
reveals his dilemma by saying: "Oh, if I only
knew which of the paths of discipleship I
ought to take! If I were only sure that this
teacher is really qualified to instruct in these
subjects! If I could only be certain that this
book is the one I should study! But I am
afraid to trust my decision on these matters.
Won't you please decide for me?"
Such questions demonstrate beyond all
doubt that the mind of the student has not ma­
tured to the point where it is capable of discrim­
ination. Not knowing right from wrong and
incapable of dividing the real from the un­
real, too many students are seeking advanced
spiritual instruction when their ethical educa­
tion is hopelessly inadequate. If you do not
know what you want to do. you are not ready
to do anything. You must first develop suf­
ficient ethical perception to be cognizant of
what you want to accomplish. The lack of
such discrimination is much too common
among occultists and is often the unsuspected
cause of their inability to attain spiritual un­
foldment. Many students feel that this ethical
training, by itself, is a waste of time and that
[26]
�.,.
it is far more desirable to become immediately
engrossed in arcane traditions. The lack of
this mental and moral culture effectually dis­
qualifies the candidate for the steps which fol­
low; the inevitable result is sorrow, suffering,
incompetence, and disappointment.
Assuming that you have carefully consid­
ered the seven cardinal requirements already
described, it is now in order to analyze the
more specific factors with which the candidate
must familiarize himself.
1. The first-and most important-is the
selection of the person or institution whose
instruction will constitute your course of oc­
cult procedure. Consider with us for a mo­
ment the attitude of the Eastern mystics on
this vital subject.
The assistance of a properly qualified teach­
er is essential to the progress of the student.
Just as a plant grows in the light of the sun,
warmed and vitalized by its Pranic emanations,
so the disciple unfolds, flower-like, nurtured
and assisted by the spiritual radiance of his
Master. The aura of a highly evolved adept is
also of great assistance to a young student who
as yet is unable completely to create certain at­
mospheres for himself. Gradually the perfect
and continued communion between Master
and disciple brings them very close together in
spiritual understanding. A beautiful friend-
[27]
ship is born between the two, which gradually
merges into a perfect and impersonal love.
The Guru (teacher) comes to know the inner�
most thoughts of his disciples. He tests the
student by bringing him into the presence of
temptation and encouraging him to be strong.
He perceives where the student is weak. He
discovers the faults in the nature which inhibit
attainment, and by wise counsel aids his "spir­
itual son" to avoid pitfalls and blind alleys.
While the Guru may have many exoteric
students, he seldom takes more than twelve at
one time into the esoteric phase of his instruc­
tion. He realizes that no one can properly
direct the studies of too large a number at one
time and give each of them the individual help
which is so necessary. He realizes that he is
the parent of a spiritual infant who is being
nurtured in the nature of his disciple, and that
this spiritual child needs almost constant at­
tention during the early stages of its growth.
By carefully observing these requisites, the
Master protects the life and health of his dis­
ciples and leads them step by step to the state
of accomplishment which they could not reach
unaided.
To study for a few weeks or even months
with an unknown teacher (even though he
may be suspected of having great intelligence)
and then to attempt to work out by yourself
[28]

future exercises and systems of development
is the height of madness, for the daily unfold­
ment resulting from occult exercises requires
intelligent supervision by a teacher who is pre�
pared for any and all emergencies. Hence the
disciple who undertakes the actual operative
processes of spiritual regeneration generally
lives (for a time, at least) with his teacher, so
that every hour of the day or night the Master
is within call. In India, the Chelas remain
with their teachers for an entire lifetime to
make certain that each step in their attainment
is properly completed and the subsequent work
correctly outlined.
Who is qualified to instruct in the operativ�
mysteries of either Eastern or Western occult­
ism? The answer is, Only an initiate or the
disciple of an initiate. An initiate is one whose
attainment to a position of spiritual under­
standing has been in harmony with the laws
of attainment. Therefore he must be and is
in consistency with the laws which have pro­
duced him. Not only this, but he must be of
that Ray of the Mysteries which is devoted to
teaching. Many great initiates are not in the
teaching Ray; therefore never take disciples.
Others, again, are so highly advanced that none
but initiates are eligible to their instruction,
as in the case of the Master J. The laws of
attainment demand purity of life and purpose;
[29]
simplicity of demeanor and appearance; hu­
mility of mind and heart; selflessness, kindli­
ness, wisdom, and absolute freedom from the
taint of worldliness and commercialism. And
on either side of this narrow path which the
disciple must walk are the pitfalls of Dugpa
magic.
We should also bear in mind that there are
few, if any, Westerners who are qualified to
teach the esoteric principles of Eastern occult­
. ism. Many are attempting to do so, but their
bungling efforts demonstrate their incompe­
tence. The East deals in subtleties, and occult­
ism is a subtle science, everything depending
upon inflections which are totally beyond the
average Western intellect. While Western
scholars may learn to understand the general
outline of Eastern occultism, even a lifetime in
India or Tibet will not qualify them as teach­
ers of Eastern esotericism, unless during their
sojourn in the Orient they have actually been
initiated into the Eastern Mysteries. Even
then there are certain key secrets which the
Brahmins, for instance, will not reveal to any
person of a race or caste clifferent from their
own. For this reason most of the concepts
promulgated by Westerners are hopelessly er­
roneous or, at best, incomplete. None but
the East apparently can understand the East,
for it is a world totally different in attitudes
[30]
\,

,L
and concepts from the one with which we are
familiar.
Then, again the Hindus themselves (while
far more religious and philosophical as a race
than the Western peoples) are not all qualified
to teach these abstruse occult sciences. As the
average Christian minister is comparatively
ignorant concerning mystical Christianity, so
a great number of Orientals have little knowl­
edge of the finer points of their faith. While
it is true that the percentage of Orientals who
understand their religion is much higher than
the percentage of Christians who understand
Christianity, the mere fact that a person comes
from the Orient is no assurance that he is qual­
ified to instruct concerning the secret teachings
of his faith. It requires a highly advanced
Oriental to adjust his doctrine to the Western
world, for if presented without certain adjust­
ments it is almost useless. In choosing an in­
structor in any line of occult science, then,
great care and discrimination must be used and
an acid test applied. The point where lack of
true understanding is most evident is in the
commercial attitude, and if the student will
eliminate from his list pseudo-occultists with
axes to grind, he will escape the majority of
the pitfalls.
2. The second point is the consideration of
the time element. Time is the primary pre-
[31]
requisite of occult growth. The disciple may
expect it to require at least twenty years to
attain success in even the first degrees. In the
early part of a disciple's training he will prob­
ably find it necessary to receive his instruc­
tion from someone in the physical world, but
as he goes higher and acquires the ability to
separate his consciousness from his lower ve­
hicles, he may receive his instruction from
teachers and initiates working through the sub­
tle essences of the invisible worlds.
No layman, either in the East or in the
West, is qualified to begin the practice of so­
called occult exercises without special prepara­
tion covering a period of years. Even in the
East, where the mind is concerned with oc­
cultism and philosophy from infancy, special
preparation is required before even the sim­
plest of the exercises are begun. Even though
a student has delved into occultism for years
and has attended countless lectures, he is not
justified in thinking that he is ready for deep
esoteric work. Unless during those years he
followed a certain prescribed and systematic
course of training, he must begin to do so, and
until he has achieved success therein he is not
ready for deeper or more complicated forms
of culture. Notwithstanding the fact that he
considers himself a highly developed person,
he must begin at the bottom and pass through
[32]
l
'
\"'
.\
his years of probationary work just the same
as the disciple who apparently is far less in­
formed. The true occultist realizes that it is
not always how long we are at a thing, but
how intelligently we pursue our labors that
counts ; and many who have spent an entire
lifetime have achieved comparatively little.
It is for the Guru (and not the chela) to
decide when the period of probationship is
completed, for the teacher is capable of inves­
tigating man's invisible spiritual nature, upon
which the record of accomplishment is im­
printed. The period of time for the first pro­
bationship is usually from two to five years.
Pythagoras of Crotona demanded five years
of self-purification before he would even dis­
cuss the matter of spiritual unfoldment with
a candidate applying for membership in his
university.
During these years of preparation the disci­
ple adjusts his entire life to· the work to which
he looks forward. He becomes permeated with
certain spiritual and intellectual attitudes, and
thus comes en rapport with the holy science.
It means that every atom and molecule of his
quaternary constitution must be purified and
made over. The organism must be unfolded,
and every part of the structure must thrill and
vibrate in a peculiar manner. What does this
mean ? It means that the attainment of spirit-
[33]
ual power is impossible unless the life, mind,
and body are dedicated entirely to that labor.
It also means that so much depends upon the
teacher into whose hands the student places
himself that it is, in reality, a matter of life
and death.
3. The third point for the candidate to
realize is the necessity of remaining silent con­
cerning any esoteric secrets which may be re­
vealed to him. He may discuss the theoretical
part of occultism with any whom he feels
deserving of such information, but the opera­
tive secrets he must reveal to no one. They
are given to him as Master to disciple, and are
for him alone. The curse of the gods is upon
the head of the man who reveals the hiding
place of his Lord for thirty pieces of silver.
The Christ in you is the secret and powerful
spiritual nature-the miracle-worker, the di­
vine, invisible man. The one who reveals the
nature and power of this secret Lord betrays
his divine Master (the spiritual nature) and
turns its power over to the hands of the mob
(his own lower animal nature) . At the hands
of the mob, the Christ (the secret power) is
crowned with a wreath of thorns and taunted
as a king. He is given the kingdom of death
to rule and is scourged by the soldiers. In the
hands of the mob nature in man, the secret
and divine power, which has thus been be-
[34]
j

�
trayed, is crowned with sorrow; the divine sci­
ence is prostituted that ignorant mortals may
by the aid of spiritual powers secure material
prosperity, marital happiness, or improve lag­
ging business conditions.
Approach with the utmost care, therefore,
the subject of occult exercises. Remember that
the esoteric secrets of occultism are designed
for the use of only that illumined few who,
having first consecrated their lives to the un­
foldment of the spiritual powers latent within
them, have reached a point after many years
where they are qualified to assume the respon­
sibility of liberating their spiritual natures from
the bondage of matter. For the layman-ethi­
cally unprepared and wholly ignorant concern­
ing the operation of occult currents and forces
-to dabble with any form of occult exercises
is almost certain to result disastrously.
4. The candidate must realize the great
danger of becoming involved in black magic.
The line of demarcation between black and
white magic is so fine that even those highly
advanced must exercise eternal watchfulness
in order to avoid involvements in Dugpa sor­
cery. To a great degree, the difference be­
tween black and white magic lies in the mo­
tive. An impersonal and unselfish attitude is
the surest protection against black magic, but
many other things (especially self-control) are
[35]
,,.
necessary to insure that the candidate shall
escape the dangers of sorcery. Both the white
magician and the black magician use identical
forces. The former, however, grows through
his constructive use of the divine sciences/;
whereas the latter slowly but inevitably de-
stroys himself by their perversion.
The attainment of transcendental powers
must be either through the regeneration and
scientific reconstruction of the body-the grad­
ual liberation of the consciousness enmeshed
within the form-or else through sorcery, black
magic, and necromancy. Woe to him who
believes even for a moment that he can tamper
with black magic and survive ! Both the East
and West are filled with Dugpas-black ma­
gicians, who by the perversion of occult forces
have become temporarily manipulators of cos­
mic energy. Gradually, but inevitably, these
Dugpas are drawn into the maelstrom of their
own evil and perish. The great danger which
confronts haphazard students is that they may
develop spiritual forces within their bodies to
a degree where they can be used by the Dugpas
for one purpose or another before they have
developed the strength and enlightenment to
use these forces to any good end. Thus many
really good people become unconscious doers
of evil because they are not sufficiently intelli­
gent to understand the right application of the
[36]
forces they have awakened within themselves.
5. The candidate must realize that the ap­
plication of commercial terms to occult values
is a direct prostitution of this most sacred of
all sciences. While a teacher of philosophy
(like a professor of botany or mathematics)
may be, and should be, remunerated for his
efforts (which remuneration may be accepted
to a moderate degree without prostituting his
science), the operative secrets of occultism must
never be involved in any form of commercial­
ism. They have no commercial value. To at­
tempt the buying or selling of them is one of
the most heinous of sins. By operative secrets
we mean that knowledge which will assist the
individual to personally unfold by secret, but
scientific, processes the latent forces or facul­
ties of his own nature. These must not, shall
not, and cannot be bought or sold.
When a man is decorated by a government
for a deed of valor, he does not have to buy
the medal that is pinned on his breast. The
same rule applies with respect to the secret
doctrine, which is revealed to man as the re­
ward for spiritual, moral, and intellectual val­
or. When the disciple is ready, it is an incon­
ceivable and unpardonable sin to deny him
that which is his by right of merit. To sell the
secrets of the invisible world to one unworthy
to know them and incapable of earning them,
[37]
is sacrilege ; to try to sell them to one who has
already earned that wisdom by virtue of the
superior qualities of his own nature is also a
sacrilege.
To place the great secrets of occultism in
writing is dangerous, and brings a heavy kar­
mic debt down upon the head of the one so
foolish as to do it; and to sell a document con­
taining such secrets compounds his karmic ob­
ligations. When revealed to the public, all
material dealing with operative occultism must
be veiled. And when it seems desirable to re­
veal the theory behind these processes, certain
keys must always be omitted, so that a careless
reader may not be able to hurt himself by ex­
perimenting with the information thus gained.
These facts are well known to those entrusted
with esoteric information, and any who break
these rules demonstrate their total unfitness to
instruct students in the mysteries of the occult
sciences.
6. The candidate must beware of unbal­
ance. Equilibrium can be safeguarded by con­
tinual emphasis of the ideal of symmetry. The
student should always bear in mind that one
virtue is not sufficient to make a saint, no
matter how excellent that one virtue may be.
Man must grow symmetrically-his heart, his
mind, and his body must coordinate and com­
plement each other. He must achieve the con-
[38]
�
dition of mental, spiritual, and physical equi­
librium. If the mind is over developed, the
scientist results ; if the heart dominates, the re­
ligious fanatic and emotionalist is produced;
if the physical nature controls, the materialist
is the inevitable product. It is only when all
three of these parts unite in the glorification
of the divine nature that the composite unit­
the spiritual philosopher-becomes a reality.
The most common occult exercises taught to
the general public today are various forms of
concentration and breathing. Many of these
exercises are hopelessly incorrect. Both con­
centration and breathing (when properly un­
derstood) have their place, for both profound-
1y influence the entire constitution of man.
But neither of these alone nor both together
will produce any permanent or satisfactory re­
sults, unless at the same time the nature pos­
sesses certain other virtuous qualities and has
adjusted itself to the general plan of spiritual
unfoldment. You may use a perfectly correct
form of Yoga breathing, but if your body is
impure you will never attain any but harmful
results. You may sacrifice all to your gods
and be a vegetarian for an entire lifetime, and
yet practically nullify the good resulting from
these practices by failure to control an obsti­
nate temper which you have tolerated in spite
of efforts you have made to overcome other
[39]
faults. Tb.e possible value of any concentrative
exercise which you may attempt will be de­
stroyed by an uneradicated streak of selfish­
ness; an unconquered egotism will continually
prevent the consummation of a lifetime of en­
deavor. If you dislike but one person, you can
never attain upon the path of white magic.
Any occult development which may be made
without conquering these qualities within the
nature lays the student open to the perils of
Dugpa sorcery and black magic.
It is because of the necessity of controlling
and transmuting all of the lower qualities of
the nature that the years of probationship are
so essential. During this period of battle with
self, the sincere student gets hold of the threads
of his life and begins to make the adjustments
necessary before the actual spiritual work can
begin. It is not by destroying the lower na­
ture that man becomes virtuous; it is by the
transmutation and regeneration of every base
quality and attitude that he achieves divinity.
This gradual process of self-conquest ultimate­
ly brings the disciple to the state of complete
self-control. From that point attainment is
not so difficult, for having controlled self, he
is the master of the universe.
All occultists know that true spirituality is
not to be gained through either extremes or ex­
cesses. Those who try to become ascetics by

This painting of the SEVEN SPINAL CHAKRAS is based upon a number of native drawings
brought from India by Mr. Hall in 1924. In the Orient, diagrams of the Chakras are comparatively
common, but several symbols not generally included have been added, which make the painting
more complete. The most important additions consist (1) of the interlaced triangles behind the
figure, the body of the Yogi himself forming the uptight triangle; (2) the beam of golden light
rising from the BRAHMARANDRA, or GATE OF BRAHMA, in the crown of the head; and (3)
the SHAHASRARA, or THOUSAND-PETALED LOTUS, in the upper part of the brain, which is
generally pictured as an inverted lotus-like cap but is here shown as a great flower-like sunburst,
with a white center and concentric rings of petals.
retiring from the world and rejecting the prob­
lems of life, those who fast, those who neglect
the problem of daily existence-such cannot
achieve, for in the last analysis, only that which
is natural and in harmony with common sense
can produce permanent benefit. It is the fail­
ure to observe these requisites that has caused
so much misunderstanding with respect to oc­
cultism today. People desire to unfold clair­
voyant powers and enter a Nirvana of happi­
ness, peace, and selfish enjoyment. They be­
lieve that occultism will vicariously solve their
problems. All this is wrong, for no one can
attain occultism who has not first given up
the desire for earthly happiness and proved
his courage and ability to master the problems
which beset him in this mortal sphere.
7. The candidate must next consider the
esoteric interpretation of the so-called material
arts and sciences. Astronomy, mathematics,
music, rhetoric, geometry, grammar, and logic
are often called the seven liberal arts and sci­
ences. There are, in reality, forty-nine great
arts and sciences. An extract from occult anat­
omy will show how esoteric science differs
from material-or exoteric-science. Turn to
the painting of the seven spinal chakras. In
the picture the general form of the chakras
has been carefully preserved, special emphasis
being placed upon the correct number of pet-
[42]
als. In the secret teachings, to each of these
petals is assigned a letter of the Sanskrit alpha­
bet. The human figure has been made semi­
transparent, as it might appear to one actually
gazing upon a Yogi in meditation. The Yogi
is apparently suspended in the air, for the
power of sight which would enable one to see
the chakras would take no cognizance of the
physical earth upon which he is sitting. The
plate is, of course, diagrammatic and must not
be considered too literally.
Study carefully the flower-like centers upon
the spinal column of the Yogi. Through the
center of the seven flowers passes the tube
Sushumna, which corresponds to the sixth ven­
tricle of science, a tiny tube passing through
the center of the spinal cord. On the left side
of Sushumna is another ·tube called Ida, and
on the right side a third called Pingala. These
are the poles of the central tube-the sharp
and flat of Sushumna itself. These two tubes
are profoundly influenced by the nostrils on
their respective sides. The Ida and Pingala
cross at the base of the skull and both rise out
of the four-petaled lotus at the base of the
spine. The Ida, Sushumna, and Pingala to­
gether are the chief of the Nadis, and of these
three the Sushumna is the most important. In
the ordinary individual the tube of the Sush­
umna is closed, but by Yoga it is opened so
[43]
that there is direct connection between the
sacral plexus at the base of the spine and the
pineal gland in the head.
According to Hindu allegory, Kundalini­
the goddess of the serpent fire-descends into
man through the umbilical cord at the navel,
but when the umbilical cord is cut, this serpen­
tine power coils itself in the sacral plexus,
where it rests upon the triangular bone at the
end of the sacrum. This triangular bone is
shown as an inverted triangle in the Mulad­
hara, the four-petaled lotus-blossom at the base
of the spine. Here Kundalini remains coiled
until through occult exercises she is caused to
rise through Sushumna into the brain, where
she awakens the actiyity of the third eye-the
pineal gland. This third eye is the link con­
necting man with the spiritual world or, to be
more correct, with the higher spiritual nature
of himself. The anthropos, or overman, which
never descends into incarnation, was called by
the Greeks the Cyclops-the giant who had
but one eye, which eye was the pineal gland,
by means of which the higher ego was capable
of seeing downward into the human nature
and the human ego was capable of seeing up­
ward into Buddhi, or the overman. Kundalini
is more or less excited into rising as the result
of the ascending essences in Ida and Pingala.
Here we have the caduceus of Hermes. The
[44]
two serpents coiled around the staff are Ida
and Pingala, the central staff is Sushumna, the
bulb at the upper end of the rod is Sahasrara,
and the wings are Ajna-the twe>-petaled lotus
above the bridge of the nose. There is some
dispute among Eastern occultists as to whether
the pineal gland is actually the thousand-pet­
aled lotus. Some affirm that it is, others. that
it is not but that a higher center in the brain
is actually the Sahasrara.
Let us now consider the centers from the
lower upward. That division or step of Yoga
called Pranayama is devoted to awakening
Kundalini from her coils and causing her to
rise upward through the chakras. As she con­
tacts these in turn they result in an extension
of consciousness. Each of the five lower cen­
ters distributes one of the five forms of Prana,
or the broken-up energy of the sun. Each of
the seven chakras also has a corresponding
tattva, or breath-a motion or condition of
spiritual air. Beginning at the botom of the;
spine and working upward, the centers are as
follows:
First, Muladhara. This has four petals and
an inverted triangle in the center. The tattvic
power of smell is associated with this chakra.
It is probably correlated with the Church of
Ephesus mentioned in the Book of Revelation,
[45]
and corresponds to the sacral ganglion of mod­
ern science.
Second, Svadhisthana. This is the second
from the bottom and contains six petals, with
a crescent in the center. Its tattvic correspond­
ent governs the sense of taste. It probably cor­
responds to the Church of Pergamos and is the
prostatic plexus of modern science.
Third, Manipura. This is the third chakra
from the bottom, containing the red triangle.
It has ten petals and is associated with the
epigastric plexus and the navel. Of the seven
churches it is probably Smyrna and is associ­
ated with the tattva of sight.
Fourth, Anahata. This is the fourth from
the bottom and its .symbol is two interlaced
triangles. This chakra has twelve petals and
is associated with what is commonly called
today the cardiac plexus. It is probably the
Church of Thyatira and its tattvic power is
the sense of touch.
Fifth, Vishuddha. This is the fifth chakra
trom the bottom and consists of a white circle
surrounded by sixteen petals. It is known to
modern science as the pharyngeal plexus. Its
tattvic correspondent gives the sense of hearing
and it is probably related to the Church of
Sardis.
Sixth, Ajna. This is the cavernous plexus of
the brain and is the sixth from the bottom.
[46]
The lotus consists of two petals caused by the
fanning out of spiritual rays, one to either side.
It is probably related to the Church of Phila­
delphia and its tattvic power is to give the
quality of thought.
Seventh, Sahasrara. This is the thousand­
petaled lotus, the highest of the sacred seven.
Its tattvic power is purely spiritual. It is prob­
ably related to the Church of Laodicea and
corresponds either with the pineal gland or an
unknown center directly above it. When Kun­
dalini reaches this point, divine consciousness
is attained.
The passage of Kundalini upward towards
Sahasrara is marked by a gentle warmth. As
it rises the lower part of the body becomes
cold, until only the head i:emains warm. The
condition is also accompanied by other phe­
nomena. Woe to the unhappy mortal who
raises Kundalini prematurely to the brain!
The sting of the fiery serpent is most deadly,
as those well know who have seen the results
of her premature raising. She will burn her
way to the brain and destroy the reasoning
qualities of the mind.
Such, in brief, is the story of the Chakras
and that science called Yoga-the art of devel­
oping and controlling them. The story of these
centers is clearly set forth in the Book of Reve­
lation, where the seven seals, the seven trum-
[47]
pets, the seven vials, and the seven voices all re­
fer to the spinal centers and the various myster­
ies concerning them. The warning can not be
too strongly emphasized that, while the study
of the theory of Yoga will acquaint you with
many of the mysteries of Nature and of your
own constitution, the practice of it should be
limited to such as have united themselves with
those schools of Eastern philosophy, of which
it is the esoteric work·-- It is well that all
should know the theory, but woe to the foolish
mortal who attempts the practice without prop­
er instruction and guidance!
The system of training through which dis­
ciples must pass in order to prepare themselves
for the highest honors of occultism is rigorous.
Take, for example, the eight steps which the
Yogi is expected to climb to union with his
Divine Self. While these processes differ in
each of the Schools, they are equally severe
and exacting in all; for it is only after the neo­
phyte has shown his ability to master and di­
rectionalize every force in his organism that he
is given the secret keys by means of which he
can control the destiny of creation. The eight
steps of the Yogi School are : Yama, Niyama,
Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhy­
ana, and Samadhi. What does each stage im­
ply? What qualitjes must the disciple unfold
in order to reacli the final stage of
.
perfect
[48]
spiritual union with the Supreme Self? These
are questions which we shall try to answer.
The first step is Yama. Under the heading
of Yama, an exceedingly strict control of the
mental nature begins, for the disciple is plac­
ing his foot upon the first step which leads to
Self. Here he must cease destructive activities
forever. He must no longer kill either the
body, the hope, or the faith of any living crea­
ture. He must become absolutely truthful. His
words must be carefully thought out before
they are spoken. In spite of his truthfulness,
he must never hurt. Unquestionable honesty
must be cultivated. He must not even desire
after a thing which is not his own; and he
must also give up the sense of possession over
that which is his own, realizing that it is only
loaned to him that he may use it for the glori­
fication of God. He must cease receiving gifts
of any kind. The only thing which he is per­
mitted to receive is sufficient food for his ex­
istence and sufficient clothing to cover his body.
(This last is not literally practical in the West­
ern world). He must gradually cultivate a
beauty within his own soul so that he radiates
peace, tranquility, harmony, and strong yet
merciful sympathy. He must live to do good,
serving all things and loving all things. He
must have no enmity, but ml;lst love his enemies
as he loves his friends, and both of these he
[49]
must love impersonally. Only when he has ac­
complished this has he actually achieved the
first step in his long path toward the liberation
of Self. It is only when we have achieved this
perfect peace within ourselves that we are
ready to go on; yet how many American stud­
ents are trying to concentrate and develop
spiritual powers who have not even begun the
conquest of their lower natures or the purifica­
tion of their bodies! This is one of the chief
contributory causes behind the tragedies of
modern occultism.
The second step is Niyama. This stage is
even more difficult than the first, for it de­
mands perfect self-control. It also requires the
perfect conservation- of energy. Wasteful ex­
penditures of life energies must cease. Nothing
shall be wasted; the tongue shall be held in
restraint to speak only when speech is neces­
sary; the energies of all parts of the body shall
be conserved and used only to accomplish that
which is essential. Then must come cleanli­
ness of mind, soul, and body, for unless all
parts are clean in their structure and expres­
sion, spirituality cannot be attained. There
must come the development of the sense of
peace-the realization that all things are as
they should be; that all activity is united to the
attainment of good; that the Supreme One is
actually controlling His world. In this stage
[50]
the disciple reads the books of wisdom, famil­
iarizes himself with the secret Scriptures, and
ponders and meditates upon the symbols and
allegories. To consummate this stage, he sur­
renders himself and all that he is to God, liv­
ing only to serve God, existing only to fulfill
the dictates of God, offering his hands and
his feet, his heart and his mind to God, and
claiming nothing for himself. He must with­
hold nothing. Regardless of his own likes and
dislikes, he must offer himself to the Supreme
One without reservation or hesitation. What­
ever God wills to be done, he will do it; at
all times of the day or night he is at the com­
mand of the Father. When he has achieved
this perfect condition of willingness to be that
which God would will him to be, the disciple
is then ready to begin the study of body pos­
tures-an art which serves many purposes.
The third step is Asana. The purpose of this
step is to gain control over the muscles and
members of the physical body. It is one of
the secret sciences, and consists of a series of
body postures, the assuming of which causes
various muscles and nerves to come into play
which otherwise are not used. Its consumma­
tion is the ability of the mind to control the
function of every organ and part of the hu­
man body, so that when the mind so wills, the
heart will stop beating and the individual still
[51]
I
live. This complete bodily control has a con­
siderable influence upon the length of life, and
according to the Hindus, will considerably
lengthen the span of human existence. A care­
ful consideration of these stages will reveal
the fact that they are all devoted to the prob­
lem of mastering the not-self and bringing the
tangible nature under the control of the in­
tangible spiritual man. When this stage has
been successfully passed, the candidate comes
to the next step, which is the control of the
solar force within the body.
The fourth step is called Pranayama. This
involves to a certain degree the science of
breathing. Prana is the life power from the
sun. The flow of this force can be controlled
by the mind and, to a certain degree, by the
breath. There is a certain individuality in
breathing. This individuality can be affected
by timing the breath and is somewhat gov­
erned by the nostril used in inhaling and ex­
haling. Pranayama is closely related to the
science of the chakras, for by means of its ex­
ercises the goddess Kundalini is caused to rise
through the spinal canal. It also has to do
with the purifying of the nerves, for the Pranic
energy flows through the nerve canals. This1
is a hazardous procedure, however, for the
average Occidental, and he is warned to leave
it entirely alone unless he has already advanced
[52]
through many stages of spiritual growth. It
is far better and wiser not to discuss the exact
method by means of which this breath force
is directed.
The fifth step is Pratyahara. At this point
the disciple begins one of the most difficult
of all occult processes-the control of the mind.
Few people realize how wild and erring their
minds are. The mind wanders ever from one
thing to another. Control seems almost im­
possible, for the very element with which it
must be controlled is the element which is
wandering. Pratyahara may be termed the
process of separating the mind from the illu­
sions of the senses and turning it more and
more upon the contemplation of Reality. The
mind must be controlled: it must think only
when it is told to think and as it is told to
think; it must be directionalized by the will of
the individual. When man is master of his
thoughts and feelings, when he is in perfect
possession of his mind, he has accomplished
the fifth step. Today the average person can­
not think clearly because interest sways his
judgment. He thinks in favor of the things
he loves and against the things he hates; he
blames some people and exonerates others,
when both are guilty of similar offences. This
is because the mind is a servant of the senses
and is incapable of free and unprejudiced
[53]
thought. To the correction of this the mind
and the senses are gradually separated, so that
the desires, lusts, greeds, and passions are no
longer capable of turning the mind from the
contemplation of things as they are. When
this has been accomplished, the disciple is then
ready for the next step.
The sixth step is Dharana. The mind, hav­
ing been
controlled,
is now directionalized.
It is turned to this point or to that and held
there unwaveringly. In order to be most use­
ful to man, the mind must be capable of point­
ing. It must reach such a condition that, like
a single beam of light, it can be turned in any
direction and held there for any desired length
of time. When placed in a certain position,
the mind remains there until the will of the
operator moves it. When the stage of Dharana
is achieved, the center of intelligence seeming-
1y can be moved so that it is centered in al­
most any part of the body. The sense of feel­
ing can be restricted to any given area. By
this means the mind also can be forced to turn
inward and see the internal parts of the body.
It profoundly influences whatever point to
which it is directed, because it is so finely
pointed that its shaft is almost solid enough
to affect the physical organs. When all
thought can be enclosed and limited to certain
[54]
areas at will, it is called the accomplishment
of Dharana.
The sevent.h step is Dhyana. This is a con­
tinuation of the previous step and is the nat­
ural outcome of it. When the mind has be­
come capable of pointing itself to any part of
the human structure and of being held there
continuously, a condition of contemplation re­
sults. In this way, an understanding of the
invisible causal nature of the object contemplat­
ed is achieved; or as one Eastern mystic says,
"The mind begins to flow towards the point
established." Gradually everything else ceases
to exist except the point, and the mind, ab­
sorbing its lower illusionary nature, draws near
to a perfect knowledge and consciousness of it­
self.
The eighth and final step is Samadhi. It is
attained when the mind is capable of ascend­
ing higher by its pointing or focalizing than
the sense of I. The individual lives, he is con­
scious, and he thinks; but he is above the sense
of I. He is temporarily universalized, and
when he returns to his normal state of con­
sciousness he brings back with him an over­
whelming sense of the relationship of things
which he never before possessed. Samadhi is
brought on by a tremendous exertion of will
power, in which the mind turns its focal ray
to contemplate something greater even than

A SYNTHETIC EMBLEMATIC CROSS
The theme of this painting is a symbolic cross
designed by Mr. Hall in the early summer
of 1923. The cross represents a composite
of the emblems and figures of the various
Mystery Schools gathered to form one har­
monious pattern, thus signifying the unifica­
tion of all religious and philosophic doctrines
into one perfect and beautiful unit-a con­
dition which must first come to pass before
the ideals of Universal Brotherhood can be
realized. The original design has not been
altered in any way, but in the oil painting
two additions have been made. The first
addition is the radiating spectrum behind the
cross and the second is the chain of twelve
globes, the latter signifying the zodiacal con­
stellations in their appropriate colors. Soon
after the design was completed, the cross was
reproduced in diamonds, platinum, gold and
enamel, and presented to Mr. Hall by his
Los Angeles congregation.
A SYNTHETIC EMBLEMATIC CROSS
The cross is the most universal of all relig­
ious symbols. Examples of crosses are to be
found in the sculpture of nearly all ancient
peoples. A cross was hung about the necks
of the initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries of
Greece. It was painted upon the foreheads of
candidates passing through the pyramid Mys­
teries of Central America, and is a symbol for
God among the North American Indians. It
is a curious fact that the cross, or X, has been
so often associated with the power of the deci­
mal system, being the Roman numerical sym­
bol for 10. A similarly shaped hieroglyph is
used by both the Japanese and Chinese for
the number 10. Crosses have been discovered
in the temples of the Brahmins. One of the
most remarkable is an emblem of cruciform
pattern found in the Brahmin temples. carved
out of rock on the Island of Elephanta in the
harbor of Bombay. When the Spaniards ar­
rived in Central America, they discovered the
Maya Indians worshipping crosses. At least
one of these Maya crosses found its way into
a Christian cathedral and now stands un­
changed above the high altar.
The Egyptian cross of life-the crux ansata
[58]
-was often referred to as the key to the Mys­
teries. Many of the gods and goddesses of the
Egyptian pantheon are shown carrying the
crux ansata in their hands, and it was not un­
common to bury these emblems with the dead.
Several Egyptian carvings show blessings in
the form of crosses issuing from the mouths of
the gods, and when the Pharaoh pardoned his
enemies the words of pardon are similarly
shown. In its wanderings, the crux ansata
reached the Easter Islands, far off the coast of
South America. There is now an Easter Is­
land figure in the British Museum, brought
there many years ago by a sailing ship, which
shows the Egyptian cross of life clearly and
unmistakably carved upon the reverse side of
the statue.
There is also a radiating·spectrum, the colors
of which symbolize the rates of vibration
through which manifest the seven creative
Spirits. The spectrum is also a suitable em­
blem for the auric bodies radiating from the
purified and regenerated soul. From each of
the twelve globes pours a stream of force.
These represent the celestial zodiac-twelve
divine, eternal lights, each symbolized by a
suitable color. The signs begin with the upper
left globe (which is red) and is denominated
Aries; they continue from left to right
throughout the zodiac. The second globe is
[59]
red orange and is called Taurus; the third­
orange-is Gemini; and so on around the en­
tire circle.
The cross, then, is a synthetic emblem, com­
bining the emblems of the Mystery Schools as
these symbols are united in the nature of man.
All of the symbols of the Mystery Schools exist
within man and are related to certain centers
of his consciousness. Thus, this cross is a mac­
rocosmic and microcosmic figure, setting forth
the mystery of human regeneration as that
mystery is concealed within the seven lesser
and five greater Schools of Divine Wisdom.
The custom of crucifying candidates at the
time of initiation into the Mysteries is very
old. The Greeks and Persians included sym­
bolic crucifixions in the initiatory rituals of
their Mysteries. Candidates were sometimes
laid upon cross-shaped altars, at other times
they were actually bound to crosses of wood
or stone. The Scandinavian Drottars used
crosses in their rituals, and the fylfot cross
(more commonly known as the swastika) is
a symbol sacred to the Chinese, the Hindus,
the Scandinavians, and the American Indians.
It is also called the hammer of Thor. It is a
spinning cross and is used by the Orientals to
symbolize the spinning vortices of force in the
spinal chakras. The Druids worshipped their
God, Hu, under the form of an oak tree, whose
[60]
top was cut off some feet above the ground
and fastened crosswise to the top of the verti­
cal trunk. The Persians also revered the cross
and used it to symbolize Ahura-Mazda, their
god of light and truth.
Since the cross was an object of universal
adoration, it is difficult to find a more fitting
basis for a synthetic symbol. It is incorrect to
look upon the cross as an exclusive Christian
symbol or limited in any way to Christianity.
Even the most bigoted investigator must ac­
cept the universality of the cross-the supreme
symbol of life, regeneration, forgiveness, and
resurrection among all peoples of the pagan
and Christian worlds.
Many early writers did not associate Christ
with the cross. The story. of His crucifixion
was apparently originated sometime after His
death. Christians revere this emblem as a con­
stant reminder of the supreme sacrifice of their
leader, while the pagans view it as emblematic
of the processes in Nature by means of which
growth and unfoldment are continuedthrough
the periods of cosmic manifestation. Among
the Buddhists and Brahmins, the cross is an
emblem of life, light, and truth, and not con­
nected with the Passion of Jesus Christ. It is
revered as typical of the supreme and eternal
sacrifice of the spiritual forces of Nature, per­
verted and destroyed by the sins of the flesh,
[61]
which must be regenerated and transmuted
before the candidate is eligible for acceptance
into the fraternity of the immortals.
In our design the cross is white, the color
of purity. The four arms of the cross are com­
monly associated with the four elements, from
which the lower bodies of all living things are
formed. Man has a mental body, an astral
body, a vital body, and a physical body. In
the midst of these dwells his spiritual nature,
crucified in the form of a flower upon sub­
stantial substances. The cross with its four
symbolic beasts-the famous Cherubim of
Ezekiel and Revelation-is symbolic of the
mind, the heart, the vitality, and the physical
nature. Physical substance itself is divided into
four major divisions or elements, commonly
called earth, water, fire, and air, and known to
science as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and
oxygen. These four are the basis of all ma­
terial form and are appropriately symbolized
by the cross. The cross is the symbol of the
tangible, visible constitution of the human
being. By stretching out his arms, man causes
his body to assume the shape of a cross. Thus,
the white cross signifies the purified body of
the candidate cleansed and prepared to enter
the temple of the Mysteries. The Egyptian
priests wore only linen robes when entering
the temples of their gods. While they often
[62]
protected their bodies from the excesses of
temperature by enveloping themselves in furs,
it was considered necessary to leave the skins
of animals outside the temple; for nothing
pertaining to the animal is worthy to enter
the house of God. By the animal is understood,
of course, man's animal nature-the irrational
part of himself-for nothing but the rational
part is capable of knowing or worshipping the
gods.
The cross may be black to symbolize im­
purity, or white to symbolize purity. It may
be silver to symbolize fecundity, or gold as
emblematic of spiritual virility. In every case
it typifies the condition of man's nature. When
of base metal, it represents the unregenerate
man; when of wood, the. sufferer; when of
stone, the intellectually and spiritually im­
potent. In short, the cross is the symbol of the
expression of the objective, visible constitution
of man; and the substances of which it is com­
posed signify the spiritual status of the objec­
tive nature.
Behind our symbolic cross is a zodiac sur­
rounding a series of forty-nine emanating lines
(not shown in the plate). The lines represent
the forty-nine fires or spiritual centers whi�
are objectified in both the Macrocosm and tlle
Microcosm. The zodiac represents the twelve
Holy Animals. Pythagoras taught a peculiar
[63]
doctrine of transmigration, claiming that the
souls of men took upon themselves the bodies
of animals. What he really meant was that
the souls of mankind, coming into creation
through the zodiacal band, took upon them­
selves .the forms of the constellations; for all
forms of cosmic life come into manifestation
through one of the constellations and are there­
fore said to assume the forms of beasts.
Crucified upon the cross is the seven-rayed
Logos'--,-the one spiritual Creator, manifested
through His seven Logoi or Planetary Lords,
each of which is represented by a point of the
'Star. The colors upon the points are somewhat
arbitrary, but there is a reason why they are
in the peculiar order shown. Although Mer­
cury is usually symbolized as yellow, here it
is violet, because the latter color is composed
of blue (the spiritual nature) and red (the
animal nature); the mind (Mercury) is the
point of blending between them.
The triangles at the extremities
of the cross
signify the elements, and the diamonds the
-spiritual essences manifesting through the ele­
ments. The twelve knobs on the arms of the
cross are the twelve Schools of the Mysteries
and the twelve disciples who ate the last sup­
per with their Lord. The knobs are also the
twelve Initiates constituting the Great White
Lodge-the twelve Immortal Mortals who con-
[64]
II

)
trol the destiny of the world. In the midst
of the cross is a fifth diamond (a fifth ele­
ment) the sacred element of the ancients. The
center of the cross symbolizes the heart-the
seat of the divine spiritual nature in man. Out­
side the diamond is a rose enclosed within the
cup of a ten-petaled lotus, thus combining the
Rosicrucian and Buddhist Mysteries. The dia­
mond in the midst of the cross is the Philoso­
pher's Stone-the human soul, produced
through a transmutation and regeneration of
the four elements which, tinctured with the
spiritual soul power, are transmuted from base
metals into gold.
