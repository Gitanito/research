     (posted on Zhi Hu forum on 4-9-2015)  

  When I was a child, I went to a snack shop to buy some goodies across the street and was hit by a car. 

I was floating in the air as I looked down on my body.  I saw people gradually gathering around me. Then I shifted my gaze and looked at my bedroom on the second-floor to the right. I saw my grandmother running down the stairs in panic. I was watching each of her steps clearly while she was running down the stairs.  Afterwards, the memories were all broken in pieces.  But the time when I was floating above myself was very vivid.  I could recalled it at any time, as if I was playing a movie. 

Later, I was hit by a car twice in the same location.  Luckily, I only had bruises on my body. After the accidents, I read a lot of materials related to the nead-death experience.  Some of the common themes included entering into the tunnel of light, watching a life review, meeting God or Buddha, and seeing deceased loved ones. However, I emphasize that at first, I did not see the Light.  I was a child in grade school.  From the material I read, I would see what I believed in.  Lastly, I didn't know any relatives who passed away because I was a young child. Maybe there is heaven and maybe I have been there, but I really don't have any memory of heaven.  

  Two months ago, I was meditating to a point that I was so relaxed to let go.  I saw myself come to a huge palace. My body was light, without any weight, as I floated in the air. The ground was golden yellow.  When I looked up at the palace, it was towering into the clouds like the Greek white pillars.  Then I saw a large library, which was also towering into the sky. The whole experience was short, only a few seconds. I just thought it might have been my own fantasy, but then I read an autobiography of a famous American medium who used her abilities to help patients go back to their past lives and alleviate their pain. There is a chapter about the experience of going to heaven.  The description is exactly the same as what I saw. The book says the place is called the 'Temple of Wisdom,' but there is no description of the library. Later, I read the library in heaven mentioned in another post on the internet. I just want to write down my personal experience and share them with the people on this forum. I currently do not have any religious beliefs.
