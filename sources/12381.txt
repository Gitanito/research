  		              		Experience Description   

      I was nine years old at the time. My cousin was 12 years old.  My cousin told me to lie down so that I could be hypnotized. I was told to breathe in and out slowly. Then my nose and mouth would be covered at the same time. The first attempt failed. 

On the second attempt, I had an experience. I saw a train going through a tunnel. The train was like a locomotive from the 1900s. The people inside the train was densely packed all the way to the top. These people were wearing the traditional Korean white clothes. There were so many people who were trying to get on the train from the train platform. The train release steam since it was about to leave. The train would be moving through a tunnel. A bright light could be seen at the end of the black tunnel. While I was standing on the platform and watching the people, two adults pushed me aside so that they could get on the train before me. I pushed back telling them, "No!" Then the train left and I woke up. 

When I opened my eyes my cousin and brother were relieved. My cousin told me that my body and face suddenly turned red and I lost consciousness. After I woke up I told them about my experience.
