  		              		Experience Description   

    I was born without a grownup tooth under a baby tooth. So, when I was almost 20 I had a procedure where I got my wisdom teeth taken out as well as a bone graph to build up my gum for a dental implant. My Oral Surgeon and I had a pleasant rapport with each other. I was a little nervous about the procedure so he suggested laughing gas. The last thing I remember was him saying  'Crank that $h#t up!' After a few seconds of inhaling the gas, I felt ANGRY and SCARED. I wanted to rip the mask off of my face but I couldn't move or talk. I remember tears streaming down my face. And then came the loud sound like a freight train. 
  
  The next thing I knew, I was out  of my body and flying in circles around the room. I saw myself, the Doctor, and the nurses. Then I flew through the ceiling and up into the sky. I went up, up, and up, until I was in SPACE. There were stars are all around me as I was just floating. The freight train sound  turned into the most amazing electronic dance music song.  I was dancing in the stars. I am thinking 'Oh,  my gosh, I am dead! They killed me.' BUT I  felt so euphoric!  So faintly in the electronic song, I could hear, 'Mary Beth?' The it got LOUDER, 'Mary Beth? MARY BETH? You feeling okay? Okay? OKAY? OKAY?' I kept hearing the word 'okay' over and over and over. 
  
  Then I could feel myself being shaken. I quickly  came to. I was confused. There were about five nurses hovering over me. I heard, 'You scared us!'

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     It felt like I was out for a LONG time. But I probably was out about 30 minutes in reality.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I heard a loud sound like a freight train, and I heard techno music. Then tI heard he nurses' voices trying to wake me up. They were fading in and out of my music. I just remember everything sounded SO LOUD.
