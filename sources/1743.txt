 In 1895 the name of the journal was changed to the Free Thought Magazine.  This is a free-thought journal with a great deal of material on spiritualism (reflecting the earlier common front of the two movements), Theosophy, and the like.  A.L. Rawson was a frequent contributor (including a piece on his introducing the English scientist John Tyndall to hashish); John C. Bundy merited an obituary; and W.E. Coleman, Lyman C. Howe,  J.M. Peebles, et al. regularly appeared.  Green (1828-1903) was involved in every liberal reformatory movement of his time and like his fellow liberals had trouble following the movement into the open advocacy of “free love” and was unceasing in criticizing Moses Harmon and his ilk.

 Free Thought Magazine, The.
 Other titles: The Freethinkers’ Magazine
 1895-1903
 Chicago, IL.  Editor: Horace L. Green.
 Succeeds: The Freethinkers’ Magazine (Buffalo, NY, and Chicago, IL)  Succeeded by: The Peoples’ Voice; Liberal Review (consolidation of this journal and The Torch of Reason)
 1/1, 1895-1903.  $1.50 a year.  See the note under Freethinkers' Magazine, which changed its name to The Free Thought Magazine in 1895.

 Green killed himself in November 1903 and the journal was combined with The Torch of Reason, published by T.B. Wakeman and Pearl Geer, to form The Liberal Review.  In 1895, Green announced that he would start a semi-monthly publication, The Peoples’ Voice, devoted to "letters from the people—the real people of the country."  (Religio-Philosophical Journal, February 23, 1895)  The venture was to be funded by requiring that each letter be accompanied by a dime.  If Green carried through the scheme, no issue has survived.  On Free Thought Magazine, see Macdonald, Fifty Years of Freethought 2:238.  Editorial contributors: B.F. Underwood; Thaddeus B. Wakeman; C.B. Waite; George J. Holyoake; Helen H. Gardener; and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  In 1901 the journal carried a series of articles by J.M. Peebles that reviewed his experience of spiritualism over almost 50 years.
