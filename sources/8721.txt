  		    4670.    Annie Mc NDE     6/29/2019.      NDE 8830.            I felt warmth from the sunlight all over, even thought the scene was dark. I felt happy and calm. The dark scene changed like a 360 degree theater with images of all types of things, flashing all at once on all sides in a sort of semicircular, skylike screen in front of me. I cannot recall the specific images. At one point, I remember a peaceful scene of dinosaurs. Next, I saw a jungle that looked like a prehistoric landscape. Then I saw millions of stars all over the sky. 
  NDE due to choking.  Experience occurred about six weeks prior to submission.   

    4669.    Sandi A NDE     6/16/2019.      NDE 8822.            I tried to hold onto memories, but nothing was working as everything was fading. Then, something was with me. It terrified me. I saw darkness that felt so dark and evil. I was trying to scream but I couldn't. Everything I tried to hold onto faded while something was pushing me and telling me to move go with them. I felt such a horrible presence that it terrifies me even now as I think about it.
  NDE due to cardiac arrest from illicit drug use two days ago.   
  
    4668.    Pamela H NDE     6/13/2019.      NDE 8821.            Then, I saw the brightest light. It is hard to describe because I've never seen it here on earth. The light did not hurt my eyes. I was overwhelmed as I felt in my soul what I had missed. I wanted to know peace and joy. My life had been chaos and I was living in such pain; emotionally, spiritually, and physically. I knew the only place I could get that peace and joy was with God, but I was still trying to discover exactly how to go after it.  
  NDE at age 16 due to car accident.   

    4667.    Leni D NDE-like     6/12/2019.      NDE-like 8819.            There was no judgement regardless of what my choice would be. I really wanted to go further into this tunnel but if I went into it any further I knew that I would not be able to stay on Earth. I have never felt peace like this. This peace was so strong that it almost felt physical. All of a sudden I could see a golden being. Like a golden man with a long golden beard. He seemed to be standing at a podium with all of my deceased loved ones behind him.  
  STE at time of pain from a migraine headache.   

    4666.    SM Aunt Probable NDE     6/8/2019.      Probable NDE 8803.       Non-western Experience from Iran. Original in Persian, translated to English by Mona.       'I was separated from my body and went down a tunnel. I was moving from the sky and towards the light at the end of the tunnel. I felt good. There was a basket of bread on top of my head. When I arrived, there was a door with two guards that would not allow me inside. They said, 'This is not your time. Go and come back later.' I remember that I wore a dress. I also saw the future.'  
  Second-person probable NDE.   

    4665.    Marcelle G Probable NDE     6/4/2019.      Probable NDE 8816.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     Facing me, there were three Beings sitting side by side at a big table. They were benevolent Beings, but I felt that they were firm. They seemed to be studying books and documents. One of them looked at me and addressed me. I didn't really hear it talking, but nevertheless the message was clear and the information was direct, 'You have nothing to do here. We signed a contract and you must go back.'" 
  Probable NDE due to suicide attempt.

I was moving at full velocity, like free falling into an endlessly spiraling tunnel. In that fall, all my life's memories began to appear in photos.

  NDE and probable NDE due to two separate fainting episodes.   

    4663.    Adriana G NDE     5/24/2019.      NDE 8804.       Exceptional experience from Mexico. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Chuck.     I understood that she was giving me a choice. I was still me, Adriana. I was not my body, but I was my essence, and I began to ask myself what there was to return to? Why leave that place where I was so happy, so full, and with such great joy and love in my heart, when I heard my daughter’s voice, telling me, “Mom, I need you for my wedding.”  
  NDE due to complications of lupus.   

    4662.    Michael C Probable NDE   5/22/19       Probable NDE 8806.       From the UK     I was looking down at our room from the corner of the ceiling. I was not full size, but was a speck while looking down on the room, a bit like through fish-eye lens today. I was aware that I had a choice of stay where I was or go back. I hesitated because it was very peaceful in the corner of the room.  
  Probable NDE at age 6-7.   

    4661.    Rachel F NDE     5/22/2019.      NDE 8805.       Exceptional experience.  From the UK.     I felt completely accepted. Totally whole and loved. Loved beyond comprehension.

    4660.    Andrea D Probable NDE     5/22/2019.      Probable NDE 8802.       From Italy.  Original in Italian. Translated to English by David.     I missed the last step, lost my grip on the hand rail, and instantly ended up under water. This was not good because I didn't know how to swim. I realized that I couldn't breathe anything but water and that I was in terrible danger. I don't remember how much time passed. I do recall that I was close to my body but in an overhead position. I clearly saw my aunt's long hair spread out in a radial pattern across her back. I saw my body as it was bobbing up and down under the water.  
  Probable NDE as a child from near drowning.   

    4659.    Françoise E NDE     5/19/2019.      NDE 8799.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.   I was looking at this light then I saw several shadows approaching, they happened to be deceased members of my family. I saw myself leaving towards them when suddenly my daddy, who unfortunately isn't of this world anymore, took my arm and told me that this place is not my place, that I still have to experience something on earth.    
  NDE due to complications of car accident.   

    4658.    Arlene A Probable NDE     5/17/2019.      Probable NDE 8801.       From South Africa     Once the haze had cleared the light was extremely bright and white but not hurtful to my eyes and definitely not the sun kind of light where it is or would be warm or scalding in this case. It felt like I had enhanced sight and was very astute to my surroundings. There was no climate pertaining to weather. Once clear It was instant that the light mentioned surrounded what I now fondly call my 'morph'.  
  Probable NDE due to life-threatening infection.   

    4657.    Claudine NDE     5/14/2019.      NDE 8798.            Below me was the planet earth, far far away and surrounded by darkness. It looked about the size of a melon if you were seeing it on the floor as an above average person in height. When I saw it I had the thought: 'Oh yes, in that place there are things call 'Identity' and 'Addresses''. What these words represented was completely alien to me when I thought them, but I knew that they were things that had to be if one was a being on that planet.  
  NDE vs drug experience with interesting observation of earth.   

    4656.    Katrina NDE     5/10/2019.      NDE 8796.       From New Zealand     The light came to me in a zigzag, erratic pattern and at great speed. It was at that moment that I realized the light was a Being. The Being of light was pure white and about 8 to 9 feet tall. I had a peaceful, loving feeling being in this Being's beautiful presence. I believe that Being was an angel.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt with pain killers.  Part of experience hellish   

    4655.    John Y FDE     5/8/2019.      FDE 8794.            I was instantly 'teleported' to a desert. The ground was sandy but solid, and I could smell the desert air. I've done military service in Kuwait, Qatar and Afghanistan so I know what it smells like. It was hot, but I felt a cool breeze. In front of me was a rocky outcrop or cliff face that extended from the ground to about 20 feet high. On the top, there was a desert tree with no foliage and it looked dry as you would expect.

    4653.    Greg S Probable NDE     5/1/2019.      NDE 8788.            I remembered walking up a beautiful stairway made of translucent pink marble. I was wearing those child pajamas with the plastic foot pads and elastic around the ankles, which I can still 'feel.' I was walking up a beautiful, curved stairway with a compassionate and caring female who reminded me of the 'Good Fairy' to my child's mind. She wore a light blue, shimmering and diaphanous gown with a belt around the waist. She didn't have wings, was not earthly, and was very kind. I remember feeling secure around her although no words were spoken.

I was part of this light and everything was light. I felt a deep peace that I had never experienced on earth. I had no weight. I felt alive and free. I had a life review that moved at the speed of a ray of light. I saw images telling me about my loved ones and that I had died. I saw my family was desolate, but I didn't want to return.  
  NDE due to car accident. 

    4651.    Antonio P Probable NDE     4/29/2019.      Probable NDE 8775.       From Italy.  Original in Italian.     I distinguished his face because he had long curly, grizzled hair. I assumed his form because in front of his chest was a very high pile of extremely big sheets of paper he started to look through calmly. I'd say there were at least 20,000 sheets there. He asked me for my name and surname in that order. My name was not in his lists, but in another guy's list. While he was looking up my name and not finding it, he became impatient and then as he continued to look, he because frantic. He kept flipping through the pile of sheets at an extremely high rate. Then he closed the book.

    4650.    Greg N NDE-Like     4/24/2019.      NDE-like 8783.       Exceptional experience.     I recall stopping at the top of the tunnel and floating towards an open opening or portal. A strange feeling came over me that told me that I had arrived. Behind me was the top of the tunnel. In front of me was a demarcation point consisting of a bright blue sky with swirling white clouds around it. In the very center, I saw a massive ball of light of indescribable brightness. I knew immediately this was God.
  Remarkable STE that is very NDE-like.   

    4649.    Will S Probable NDE     4/22/2019.      Probable NDE 8779.            I took my time to take it all in. I seemed to have feet, though I never thought to looked down at myself to verify that I had feet. It all felt peaceful and natural. The closer I got to the light, the more I understood what was going on. I knew that I had left my physical body and was passing on. I also knew I had been here before and that I was 'home'.  
  Probable NDE due to apparent alcohol poisoning at age 15.   

    4648.    Jade NDE    NDE 16099.            I saw myself become another person - a man. Then the "man" would be in MY body and then I slowly became 'me' again. 'I' became a grown man walking along, looking down at red desert sand. I had all the lifetime of memories of an older man, around the age of 60. He had a good life, wife, and grown children.

I felt very excited, humbled and in euphoria.

I did wonder if I should stay, but decided to go back.

He was smiling very brightly, looking at me with tender and loving eyes, like somebody who truly loves me. I think the smile was open, in the sense that he was showing his teeth, so, it was a huge smile.

I saw my grandmother, Agnes, and my wife’s grandmother, Millicent. They looked like the best version of themselves. I realized that I could go if I wanted to do so.

I had the feeling that everything outside of where I was did not have any  meaning, i.e., everything was meaningless and pointless - and an illusion. I had absolutely nothing to worry about. I floated above the pool. I could see the tops of the umbrellas that were in the middle of the tables. I saw my sisters. Then I saw my older brother walk to the edge of the pool.

Each Being looked the same. They were big black silhouettes with white eyes and white mouths. Almost all of these Beings had soft, closed eyes and smiles on their faces. I felt happy and warm when I looked at them. I walked through this tunnel for a very long time that felt like forever. The entire time, there were Beings to my right and I had to look at their facial expressions to know how I did.

He had already told me who He was. He told me not to frighten her, so I asked her to check my urinary catheter because I was wet and lying in it. He said she would be very upset. In actuality, I was lying in blood from my shoulders to my calves that squished when I moved. It was cold, but there was no pain anymore.

They looked so happy to see me and looked so peaceful.

Starlights orbited around in this space in a logical pattern from the larger white-light source. I was there and made of conscious light.

It was much more powerful than simply being ' brightness.' I was attracted by this light, yet it is impossible to say if I was going towards it or if it was coming towards me. The closer it came, the more I felt the immense love eminating from it. The love was so indescribable, that I never knew it before and never experienced it again.

I am aware of the gratitude I feel for being here. I continue to be pulled toward something like a magnet. Aware that I am moving toward somewhere I long to return to, there is a strong awareness that I am being accompanied to the destination by multiple unseen beings. Where this knowing came from, I am not aware, it was just a definite knowing.

It was almost instantly in comparison to the journey to heaven with the angel. He placed me back in my body and was leaving when I realized he had not fixed my neck. I said, 'Wait! What about my neck?' God then came back and put his hand on the back of my neck. My neck began to crackle, pop, and make noises as things were going back in place. The warmth of his hand on my neck was a healing type of warmth. God began to leave and I noticed that my neck still was not right. I said, 'Wait, there is one more thing out of place.'
