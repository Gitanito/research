Chapter I
THE FARMHOUSE— MY AUNT AND UNCLE
MY earliest recollections began in a farmhouse in Ireland.
Many memories rush in, from the time when I was prob
ably three years old. It is difficult, therefore, to give them
sequence. Images of the house and garden melt into each other. I
can not tell where one leaves off and the other begins. There was
a long, rambling, stone house, and each succeeding generation
had added another wing to it, I was told. Roses and honey
suckle covered its walls, and peeped through its windows.
Beyond the garden was the farm yard, its sheds crowded with
cattle, and its barns full of hay and fodder. The lane leading
to our farm, I remember, was abloom with hawthorn and
crabapple; this was the boundary, beyond which I was forbid
den to go alone. From the lane, a gate opened into a paddock,
through which the horses and the cows came and went with
an army of farm hands.
My uncle bred dogs; terriers and collies. Their kennels
were at the bottom of the garden, and I was allowed to go
there when I liked. To terriers I never became attached;
they were just dogs. The collies were different; there was
one, my greatest friend, a shaggy, golden haired dog, named
Ida. Her chest was white and silken and her eyes twinkled
with kindness and understanding. She and her family were my
only friends, and I loved them more than anything else in the
world.

I must have ridden a horse before I can remember. I do
not recall beginning to ride, but that is not strange as children
learn at such an early age in Ireland. At four, when I went
to school, I was quite at home on a horse, as I lived in County
Meath, which was then the second most important hunting
county- in - Ireland.; 3 At that time, the Court of England and
the -nQbilipy/of jhp -cpntinent, always came to Ireland for the
. hunting. ^n.d- -shooting -seasons. Their meets for the fox hunt-
m^."were-^ld|aboujt/a\half-mile from our house, so that they
rode over our farm almost daily. Sometimes I held the pad
dock gates open for their horses to pass through, and often I
was lifted to the saddle by these passing huntsmen. I loved
these horses and the bright red hunting coats of the riders,
but rebelled against being petted by strangers. Their crude
caresses always frightened me; I resisted their approaches in
the only way I knew, fighting furiously with teeth and nails
to free myself from their rough hands. The shock of these
early experiences made me from that time on, fearful and sus
picious of everybody. After that I shrank more than ever;
from human contact, and was only truly happy when I was
alone. In retrospect there is no doubt now in my mind, that
these very early experiences affected my attitude to all human
relationships and set up a definite barrier that continues to
this day, between myself and other people.
My aunt always appeared to me as a lovely and statuesque
creature, even when she was cross. To me she always seemed
cold and distant. I remember running up to her, as a small
child, when she was gay with my uncle and others and trying
to get her to turn my way and share her laughter with me;
but her firm hands would take hold of my shoulders and
turn me quietly aside. She never pushed me from her roughly,
but simply removed my fingers from her hands and turned
away. I think of her still as a tall and unbending woman,
gowned in a crisp black taffeta dress, whose rustling always
warned me of her approach. Her glasses, which she wore on a
black silk cord, seemed also a part of her presence, and froze
me, when her cold hands did not. She had tawny hair, dressed

high in a twisted knot. When she scolded me, and that hap
pened every day, I did not mind so much if I could take refuge
in gazing at her coils of red hair which I always longed to
touch.
I loved my uncle with a deep devotion. I was happy when
I could walk for hours behind him as he strolled; that was
my earliest memory of him. He was never cross with me;
though he did not always answer when I plied him with ques
tions, he often replied to my remarks with an assurance that
I was probably right. I loved and admired my uncle. He
was kind of eye and ever cheerful; dignified in bearing, he had
white hair and grey eyes and a grey beard; and the rifle that
he carried on his shoulder was as much a part of his personality
as the cough that shook him mornings and evenings. Photo
graphs of him, taken in middle age, definitely connected him
with my remote conception of God. I first learned to see
the outside world through his eyes, and because he taught me
that nothing in life existed to hurt me, I knew no fear of the
woods or the animals or the dark. I looked forward to those
nights when he allowed me to accompany him to the woods
in search of poachers, and I thrilled with excitement when he
taught me to hold his rifle. I would have died rather than
let him know that its heaviness was too much for me. His
word was law to me and it never entered my head to disobey
him.
My room was located at the top of a winding staircase.
It was more than home to me, and it knew all my secrets.
The rest of the building was only "the house." The wall of
my room sloped on one side; it seemed to lean over, to look
at the roses growing against it, which reached upwards to the
thatch where the swallows had their nests. Underneath my
windows the garden borders grew blue and yellow until they
reached the kitchen garden and the apple trees. The house
was two storied, thatched and rambling. It seemed to want to
hide itself in the roses which grew around it. To my room,
I told everything I felt, talking aloud. There were pictures
on the walls; those depicting spring I loved the best.

My chest of drawers told me stories, as I touched its
wood caressingly. A little old lady would visit this chest; she
was tired and frail and never spoke. I could not converse with
her, as I had been taught that I must never address my elders
until they spoke to me. I never found out anything else about
the little old lady. When I spoke to my aunt about her, she
dismissed me with the suggestion that I was the victim of a
too lively imagination. An oval mirror stood on the chest;
into this glass I never looked without first breathing on it; I
liked to see the inverted bits of the room reflected on the
mirror's misty surface. This made me feel that I was, for the
moment, living in a new and different house. I do not recall
the other objects of the room, except the two small and incon
spicuous photographs that stood side by side upon the chest.
Once I heard someone say of them "poor Anthony and Anna;"
thereafter, the two names remained etched in my memory, and
to everything that stood side by side, in pairs,—trees in the
woods, plants in the garden, little hills and even dogs and
rabbits, I gave the names of "Anthony" and "Anna." When,
at ten years of age, it was explained to me that Anthony and
Anna had been the names of my dead parents, I was glad for
them, that I had called so many things I loved by their names;
I felt that I had, in some way, given them life through the
things I loved. It may seem strange that my early life con
tains no association with parents, nor any memory of feeling
their loss. They were never mentioned to me, and I do not
remember ever asking, why I did not possess parents as other
children. Only some years later, before my confirmation, I
was given their few belongings and told the story of their
tragic end.
Within my own room I could extend the nebulous, cob
webby part of me, that had no space for its full expansion
elsewhere. Breathing beyond my fingers and above my head,
I hugged myself with happiness. This protection gained in
my room must have been the beginning of my ability to
draw within and live alone with myself. The time came when

I could use this process to shut out the voice of my aunt. I
remember finding that I could watch her lips move but hear
no sound of the words she spoke. This then must have been
the beginnings of that separation of personality which later
led to the state known as trance.
From my earliest memory I have been able, by lying
quite still with my head in the crook of my arm, to reach out
and touch the flowers and the sky. I have also, in this way,
sensed the breath of a distant bush, the flesh of a far-off flower,
or the sap of some remote tree. The falling rain could make
my body feel as the grass did under its weight, and I knew
the sense of the damp, just as the leaves knew it. The air
around sustained and fed me as though I had received food
and drink. However deeply, as a child, I might feel the need
of tears, if my head were cupped in the crook of my arm, I
quickly found the peace to banish my hurt in the pulse of the
living world without. I can, to this day, by lying thus within
myself, know "oneness" with all Light and Life.

Chapter II
THE CHILDREN"
CC* I VIE Children" came. There were two little girls and a
boy. I first saw them framed in the doorway; they were
strange to me, as were all children; I looked at them intently
and longed to play with them but I was not allowed to mix
with other children. I must, I suppose, have turned away and
promptly forgotten all about them. I believe that I first met
"The Children," some time before I went to school, at about
four years old. Out-of-doors next day, I saw them again.
They stood, as children will, intent on looking; I joined them
and after that they came to see me daily. Sometimes they
stayed all day, sometimes but a little while, but no day passed
of which they were not a part. When I looked for "The
Children," I had to seek them out-of-doors; sometimes they
would come within, but I grew to know that they were
unhappy inside the house. Until I was thirteen, they remained
in touch with me, coming and going. I regarded them as "My
Children." From the moment they came, toys lost their mean
ing for me. Like the growing things around me, which I
loved, I loved "The Children." Other people came and went,
I saw them; they interested me for a moment, and when they
left I was glad; not so with "The Children;" anything that
interrupted my life with them made me restless; they became
as much a part of it as the sunshine, the flowers, the rain and
the wind. The living things around me that I loved began

to change; the animals grew up, the flowers died, the garden
altered; but "The Children" never changed. I dreaded, lest I
should lose them, when school began, but they assured me that
school had no terrors for them, and they promised to remain
with me. So the days went on, "The Children" and I talked
and laughed and played together and were very happy.
When I told my aunt and uncle of "The Children," they
were obviously annoyed with me and again accused me of
lying. They ridiculed the whole idea of the existence of these
playmates and they asked me where they came from, what
were their names, and where I had met them. My aunt did
not believe me when I told her that I had met them out-of-
doors. I begged her to come and see them for herself, but
she replied, "Now do be quiet about those children of yours.
You are making it all up; there are no such children, and God
will surely punish you for telling such lies." Daily I appealed
to her, "Please, Aunt, come today and see them now." I
tried to tell her more about them, how there were two girls
and one boy and that one girl was older than I. She asked
me how I knew all this. "Do you speak to them or touch
them?" I stood abashed at her doubts. "If ever you try,
you will discover that they are not real at all. You are only
imagining these children."
"The Children" laughed when I told them how my aunt
doubted their existence. "We are wiser than she," they seemed
to say. I never doubted the reality of "My Children," or the
fact that we spoke in ways that no grown-up understood. I
touched them and found that they were soft and warm, even
as I. There was one way in which they differed from other
people. I saw the form of ordinary humans surrounded by a
nimbus of light, but the form of "The Children" consisted
entirely of this light. My aunt was so annoyed with my tales
about them that I ceased trying to explain to her that "The
Children" were still mine. I continued to tell my uncle and
he smiled and said "Maybe so."
Gradually I began to suspect that everything that my
aunt told me was not true. As I came to know "The Chil

dren" better, they taught me not to believe much of what
any grownup said or did; they gave me the courage to disobey
and face the consequences of saying "No." They taught me to
watch people, and especially to study my aunt. I began to see
her face change in moods of anger or doubt or fear; I noticed
that she had none of the placidity of "The Children." They
taught me also how to listen to my aunt's voice and to note
all its changes and its moods; watching her as we did together,
I grew less fearful of her, and by the time I went to school,
I knew no grown-up ever quite spoke the truth. Even my
uncle, whom I loved, and who always listened to me, I began
to trust no longer, with my stories of "The Children;" and
when he asked me sometimes jokingly about them, I would
hasten away, rather than answer. "The Children" had become
my responsibility, and had to be protected at all costs, from
the doubts of others. They shared all my days, and often my
nights, with me. When they appeared again, after I had gone
to bed and asked me to join them, I never hesitated to do so
and never worried about the consequences of our adventures;
I always went with them, even though going brought punish
ment in its wake; no threat of further thrashings could prevent
our escapades together.
In order to be with "The Children," I grew secretive and
wary in my actions by day and was always ready to go to
bed at twilight. Such good behaviour often brought my aunt
hurrying to my room suspicious lest I should have some hidden
plan; she watched me constantly, wondering, I suppose, why
bed should seem so desirable to me whilst it was yet day.
Often when she came I pretended to be asleep. Later, when
"The Children" arrived, I slipped through the window and
joined them in the garden, either under the moon, or in the
starlight, or in the deep darkness of an un-illumined night.
Often my aunt and uncle caught me in the garden, hours
after they thought I was fast asleep in bed. Punishment was
meted out, and I was taken promptly to my room. My aunt
would ask me, "But why must you do this? It is certainly
easier to ask permission to remain up and play in the garden,

than to go to bed whilst it is yet light, and then get up
again without your proper clothing. You must surely want
to die." At first, I would tell her through my tears that
"The Children" had come for me, and I had to go. This only
angered her and brought me further punishment. I learned
that silence, which she called sullenness, was my only defense
against her. Thus an insurmountable barrier grew up between
us, which I no longer tried to remove.
When "The Children" came, I never saw them approach,
and I never saw them go away. I might look up and find
them there, or, quite suddenly, they would be gone. I wanted
to follow them in the early days when they left me, but
they shuddered and said "No." After that, I never asked to
go with them any more. If I had known where they went,
I would have told my aunt, and then she could have seen
them. "The Children" annoyed me when they refused to
climb trees with me, or row across the river or paddle in the
brook. Evidently they did not like the water much, though
they never said so. They disapproved of my tree-climbing;
they liked to look at the trees and live with them, but told
me that trees were meant to be left intact, and not disturbed
by the tree-climbing of any of us. All else in my life they
shared; they loved everything that grew and flowered, and
they opened up my sense of beauty. They shared my enthu
siasm for the garden and the fields; every stone had a story,
every hill in the neighborhood an adventure for us. Trees
and shrubs became our friends. They showed me where the
first violets bloomed, where the primrose grew thickest, and
the cowslip flowered in greatest profusion. They knew where
the finest blackberries grew and took me mushrooming before
the dawn. They found out where the wrens and robins built
their nests, and led me forth to look at the bats, hidden from
the light of day in the roof of the barn. When the puppies
came, they were the first to know and when the lambs were
born, they hurried me outdoors to visit them.
In later years when I spoke of "The Children" to those
who knew something of my childhood, I was often asked,

"Did these playmates of your childhood resemble any actual
children you had known?" and to this I have often replied,
"No." Before I went to school, when "My Children" first
came to me, I knew no other children; I saw the village
youngsters at a distance, but was never allowed to play with
them, and there were no others in our neighborhood. Other
people, trying to understand the quality of these childhood
companions, would ask me, "Did those children seem com
pletely real to you, or were they perhaps fairies?" To me,
"My Children" were in no way-iairy-like in appearance, judg
ing of what I learned later about fairies; for at the time,
when "The Children" first appeared, I was only four, and I
had never heard any stories about fairies, from either my aunt
or uncle, before I went to school. It was not until years
later, that the old people of the countryside regaled me with
tales of brownies and fairies.
I have also been asked to tell how "The Children" com
municated with me when we met. "Did they use words?"
is often asked. I can only answer by saying that I conversed
with the children as I did with everything that was alive; for
it seemed that I knew what the flowers and the trees were
saying without the use of words. So it seemed to me that "The
Children" and I also communicated our meanings to each other
without the use of words. Even today, words have not the
value to me that others place on them. I can, in a flash, by
sensing, communicate to another all my thoughts and wishes,
as well as perceive those of others, without uttering a single
word. The inadequacy of words, to express emotions, thoughts
and feelings has, from time to time, created a barrier between
me and others, and even made it seem impossible for me to
explain myself and my method of functioning to most other
people.
As a child I deeply resented the fact that no grown-up
believed anything I said. When I expressed dislike of people
from their touch or smell, I was always reprimanded by my
aunt. When I said someone hurt me who had in reality only
stroked by hair or touched my face, I told the truth; but the

horror produced on my aunt's face by such statements made
me realize that she considered that I had committed a misde
meanour; I was bewildered by this treatment. I was con
stantly tearful and wondered why no one believed me when I
described exactly what I saw and felt. I could not under
stand why no one seemed to like me. My only peace carqe
from being alone; no wonder my room became my haven of
safety, and "My Children" and the growing things, my only
companions.
It must have been this, early misunderstanding of my
perceptions that threw me into a state, where observation
became my only means of self-expression. I soon discovered
that there could be no exchange for me in understanding with
other people, since no one ever admitted that I was right and
I could not see things except in my own way. It was not
until many years later that I found out that what went on
around me became visible to me by a type of sensing that
people then termed supernatural but which even today is
regarded as supernormal. It can, therefore, be seen why I
was not more in harmony with the world in which I grew up.
No one could bridge this gap, since no one else near me ever
knew my world; and I was quite as unable to live in theirs.
Small wonder, therefore, that my aunt saw in me only a sullen
child with a wild imagination whose only outlet seemed to be
lying, disobedience and cruelty. It was not until I was
twenty-three that I met and talked with Edward Carpenter,
who first helped me so that I became aware of the meaning
and functioning of my supernormal nature.

Chapter III
GOING TO SCHOOL AND THE "SURROUNDS"
OF LIVING ORGANISMS
I WAS scarcely four when adults would remark hopefully to
me, "You'll soon be able to go to school." From this tone,
in which they spoke, it seemed as though it must be a dark
place, surrounded by high walls, where my liberty would be
suppressed, and some form of punishment would surely be
meted out to me. School sounded like a distinctly unpleasant
place. Only when my uncle spoke of it did the prospect
seem interesting and exciting, something to which I could
look forward.
When I finally went to school at four, I was much
relieved to find that its sunny rooms were full of pictures and
maps and books. The teacher was kindly, but such numbers
of children gathered in one place, overwhelmed me. I had,
up to that time, only known my family and the people on the
farm. Going to school brought me a bewildering sea of faces,
and a long three mile journey each day between home and
school. At first, I was driven there with a neighbor's child;
I enjoyed the drive but disliked the child. She talked inces
santly about her clothes, her hair ribbons and her lace pina
fore. One day, in anger, I pulled off both her ribbon and
pinafore; that was my first act of disgrace. I was punished
by my teacher and my aunt, and then had this atrocious child

held up to me as a model of all the virtues that I did not
possess. I could not bear to ride with her any more and suc
ceeded in getting my aunt's permission to walk alone to
school so as to avoid the sight of this child on the road. I
chose a roundabout and much longer way; for the seven
years I remained at school, so deep was my dislike of her that
I would never again use the shorter road.
School made me neither happy nor unhappy. I always
knew that the children and teachers lied to each other as
well as to me. It gave me a secret pleasure to sense this, and
to know that they were not aware that I could see what went
on within them. The younger children relied on me for every
thing. I had to take them to the wash rooms, do their les
sons for them, and cheat for them with the older girls and the
teachers. The little ones bored me with their endless demands,
but I never had the heart to say "No" to any of them. They
knew so well how to play on my weakness, and in conse
quence, I could never get a chance to finish my own lessons.
I preferred to take my punishment silently from the teacher,
for neglecting my work, rather than explain how I had really
been spending my time.
I had not been long at the school when I realized that
the other girls and I were very far apart. They saw and
understood nothing as I did. They only knew what had been
taught or told them and never thought out anything for
themselves. They depended entirely upon the final authority
of grown-ups; their pretense of accepting whatever opinions
the teacher expressed, and their inability to have their own
point of view sickened me.
The contrast between the way my schoolmates and I
dealt with life, confused me; I saw people, not merely as
physical bodies, since for me, each person was set within a
nebulous egg-shaped covering of his own. This surround as
I call it, for want of a better name, might consist of trans
parent changing colours, or sometimes become dense and dull
in character. The state of these coverings changed according
to the variation in people's moods. Because, since childhood,

I had always been used to seeing such surrounds encircling
every living plant, animal and person, I paid little attention
to the actual body contained within each of these envelop
ments. I tried to talk to the girls at school about these mist
like surrounds which I saw, but they did not know what I
meant. All my life it had been difficult for me to believe
that others did not see as I did, these formations enveloping
each living organism.
As a child, I knew that the character of people depended
on their surrounds. By the quality of the light and colour
they gave forth, I could judge their personality. Some people
moved in grey shadows and some in glowing lights. For me,
the important thing about anyone I met, was to see and feel
the quality of these surrounds. By their colour and their
tone, I knew whether people were sick or well. This was
equally true for me, of plants and of animals; I knew, accord
ing to the condition of their envelopes, when the vitality of
trees and flowers was high or low. While the girls at school
were not aware of such matters, I was sure that the animals
understood them. I noticed how animals behaved towards
each other, and with people and I could tell that they sensed
these surrounds. As a mouse reacts to the presence of a hawk
before it sees its form, so did I know that all animals reacted
to their enemies and friends, by means of these enveloping
forms. It was difficult for me to understand what other
people meant by personality; for to me personality was a
blending of the light nimbus, which surrounds each form,
with its physical body. It was the colour and movement of
these surrounds of living things, and not the physical body,
which gave me complete understanding of their being.
I was often called a liar by my schoolmates and teachers
for telling them what I really saw when it was something not
evident to them. I was deeply hurt and baffled by these
accusations because I knew that I was telling them the truth.
As the months went by, I became convinced that it was
useless to speak of what I saw. I was forced to live in my
own world, alone, and I came to accept this as inevitable. I

learned to become apparently receptive to the ideas of those
at home and at school; thus I gained a reputation for being
an amenable and silent child. Actually I gave up none of my
own views, for I was positive that things were truly as I saw
them, but I had now learned that it was useless to try to dis
cuss "my world" any longer with other people. The old gypsy
I came to know when I was ten, was the only person in my
life who ever understood what I sensed and saw. That remains
true even to this day. Since other people dwelt in a world so
separate from mine, I had to learn to deal in my own solitary
way, with what I alone, saw and I became at times quite
unhappy and fearful over this. The impacts which I saw tak
ing place in the surrounds of people as they met and reacted
to each other's thoughts and emotions, constantly disturbed
me. I saw how people's conflicts rocked them without their
understanding why and gradually I became aware that people
were thus the unconscious victims of each other's moods.
This made me withdraw as much as possible from the pain of
human impacts and seek more and more to be alone. After
the turmoil of each school day this need grew stronger. I
would return to the quietness of my own room and the gar
den and "My Unseen Children." Bitter experience had grad
ually taught me not to speak of "My Children" to any adults;
they did not believe in their existence, and only laughed at me
for making up such stories.

Chapter IV
I DISCOVER THE DANCE OF THE LIGHT GLOBULES
I HAVE often been asked how I saw forms in light and
movement. I first became aware of movement in light and
colour before I was five years old. I grew conscious of it
by lying still on my bed and looking into the shadows. I
began then, to see globules of light bursting at intervals
within the beams of sunlight. When I knew them better, I
discovered them moving in any kind of light; they swirled
around each other, enlarging and bursting as bubbles do,
when they give way one to the other; and just as bubbles
reflect colour, so also did the bursting globules have colour
within them. These light balls presented themselves in so
many shapes and sizes that my head ached from trying to
see them all moving simultaneously in many directions. They
were always egg-shaped and not quite round. Their move
ments were like the steps of a dance, weaving a well regulated
pattern as they swirled.
My room became a haven to which I fled to shake off
the sense of being too close to other children. I felt, as a
child, hurt and oppressed by any close contact with others;
so much so that I struggled violently to free myself if anyone
caressed me. Lying in my room and merely breathing, I
became aware of the movement in and around the room.
Instead of empty space, I found that the air was full of sing
ing sounds, and my globules danced like midget stars weaving

in and out and around each other in ordered ways. From
that time on no space that was empty existed for me; I
seemed to feel the weight and movement1 of a condensed
area without sensing either its weight or heaviness. Soon I
began to move within myself. It is difficult to explain my
meaning. If I try to describe how I entered into this state
I can only say that I felt myself drawn into it. I seemed to
be split up as though divided into little pieces and each piece
was located in a different place.
When I say that I know a tree or a flower or even a
rock, this same thing that I have been trying to describe
happens to me, and I then experience a flowing part of me
which goes out towards the plant and yet remains myself.
As the years developed, this mechanism became for me, more
conscious and usable. I found that at will, I was able to
project myself or some aspect of myself into the personalities
of people and things. This I could even do with persons
that were unknown to me, living perhaps, in some distant
house or country. This ability to project a fluid part of
myself, consciously and without fear, began when I was very
young as a game with myself and much later this developed
into what has now become recognized as an aspect of my
supernormal sensing.
In the early days at school I tried to tell some of my
companions that there was no such thing as a space that was
empty. I spoke of how the bright globules of light danced
and filled all space. But they, as was the case with my aunt,
did not understand. Their scornful smiles silenced me and
made me realize that to them, all space seemed empty. But
even as a child of five I knew it packed with infinite variety
of form and movement. It was to be many years before the
experiments of modern chemists and physicists helped to
interpret for the world what my supernormal sensing had
already begun to register for me.

Chapter V
WHY NAMES HAVE MEANT LITTLE TO ME
I HAVE never really wanted to hear names when a new
person approached me. As an animal must know by sense
the appearance and smell of objects, I too sense and know a.
person; never by the physical appearance but by the taste,
smell and touch of their surrounds expanding beyond their
physical selves. Even today do I clearly sense the shapes that
encompass every person, plant and living form. As a child, I
resented the touch or feeling of these surrounds in people,
though not in animals or plants. I have asked myself in late
years what was the quality in the human surrounds which I
disliked. In retrospect, I am sure that I judged people in my
childish way by reacting to them by some process of taste
or smell.
I began then to study and watch these surrounds which
enveloped all those I met, and saw how they fought and
interchanged; as people's moods shifted, their surrounds would
struggle with each other and when the tone of a conversa
tion changed, these nebulous forms would expand, contract
and change their colour and shape according to the tone and
quality of the words spoken. After a while I never listened
to what people said when they addressed me or paid attention
to what they told each other. I saw their conversations
shaped in space in flowing colours which were sometimes
bright and shining, but more often showed in deep and sullen

shades. Within these colours I perceived breaks in the mass
of the surrounds and in the breaks, silver lines appeared, fine
as the threads of cobwebs; these delicate lines would move
back and forth as though breathing gently to themselves.
As a child these shapes and surrounds were for me, more
important than the creature they enveloped and they became
a source of constant interest. I talked of them and their
movement constantly. I watched them in and out of season.
When I spoke to my aunt and uncle of these nebulous sur
rounds and told them how their impact hurt me or gave me
pleasure, they looked at me in shocked amazement, became
cross and said, "You will be punished the next time you say
these things."
I never understood at that time that shapes and surrounds
were not visible to everyone else. It was only many years
later, after my marriage, that I really found out that others
did not see such forms. Before I went to school, at four, I
had already learned to rely on my own perception of things
and ask few questions since no one would answer them; but
I never quite understood why I must not ask questions about
the things I wanted to know. This did not make me unhappy;
I simply learned to hug my world of shapes and colours,
shadows, sounds and movements to myself. I loved more
than ever the moments of my silent day when I might live
with them alone.

Chapter VI
TESTING GOD
I HAD no fear of anything as a child; but of God I had at
times great fear. When my aunt first spoke of Him as
being ready to punish me, I thought of someone who would
some day suddenly descend on me and I should be no more.
Since He never showed Himself, I grew less fearful and even
began to wonder how I could force Him to appear. I did
such things as my childish imagination could invent to anger
Him and believed that then surely He would come. No
breaking of china, no stealing of sweets or other childish
pranks of mine ever brought Him forth. In a rage one day
at what seemed to me unjust punishment, I wondered what
terrible thing I could do to make God finally appear. Taking
the Bible I tore one or two of its pages and hurled it against
the farther wall of the room, calling on Him to come forth
and punish me. I waited for what seemed like hours, in
terror, not daring to look up or move. When He did not
appear I had at first a sense of relief, but afterwards my fear
of this Avenging One began to diminish and my belief in all
that was told me by my aunt and others was considerably
shaken. I was however, to test His Presence once again
before I finally shook myself free of my childish fear.
At about eight or nine I became aware of problems in
religion beyond those ideas I had been taught at home. There,
the ever-present God was spoken of, One whose only mission

seemed to be to punish me. At the Low Church Sunday
School this image was again made vivid in its dreary teach
ing of the Catechism and Bible lessons. Near Dublin, where
I lived, I went to the National School where the preponder
ance of children were Roman Catholic; in Ireland no other
religion is taught in the government schools, and so quite
spontaneously I absorbed its prayer and ritual. The music,
the ceremonies and even the sing-song way in which the
Catholic children intoned their prayers, fascinated me. I, as
a Protestant, was expected to leave the room during the
recitation of the Catechism or while the children prayed as
the Angelus was rung. This I did not always do for it gave
me peace, to think of a God who could be approached by way
of the Chapel, the Virgin and the Holy Saints, and the kindly
old parish priests. It brought me rest and comfort to find
myself in the warmth of the Chapel, with its lighted altar
and its incense. The intoning of the service gave me a feel
ing of devotion and quiet which I experienced neither at home
nor in my own church. My happiness, however, was inter
rupted by my classmates, all Catholics, pointing out to me
that I, the only Protestant in the class, was committing mortal
sin by attending Chapel. Mortal sin was a term that to them
brought eternal damnation, but for me it had no meaning.
So I continued, whenever possible, to creep into the Chapel.
This religious peace was rudely shattered by my aunt,
when I asked her permission to see my classmates confirmed.
The kindly priest had already told me that I could watch the
ceremony from the gallery where I would be unobserved by
the others. This I joyfully told my aunt, believing she would
let me go. She seemed shocked that I should on any occasion
desire to visit the Chapel and emphatically refused her con
sent. In doing so she expressed the hope that as a good
Protestant I had never in the past entered the Chapel. I am
afraid that I hurt her deeply when I confessed that the
friendly Chapel was more to my liking than her forbidding

church. She forbade me ever to enter it again or have any
thing to do with the Catholic religion; but as the school stood
in the Chapel yard I continued to visit it secretly.
The effect of imbibing the two religions at one time
became a little overwhelming. At home the fearsome and
forbidding God of the Protestant Church and my aunt's inter
pretation of His Avenging Wrath awaiting me; at school,
within easy reach, was the consoling presence of the Virgin
and the Child. These two religious attitudes were, in my
mind, worlds apart; they had not the least relation to each
other at that time or since.

Chapter VII
THE "VISION" OF MY AUNT LEON
AND THE DEATH OF THE DUCKS
BETWEEN
the conflicts of home and school, religious and
otherwise, these mixed emotions and resentments of mine
grew greater, making me at times, more tearful and unhappy.
Until that time, however, I could somehow deal with life as it
came, and although the school children and others wearied
me, I had learned to keep my own counsel and managed to
become better liked by my school companions. The situation
at home did not change. I was never, in my own mind, a
part of the household; I belonged more to the world that
grew and took its living outside the house; if this house and
all in it had folded up and gone away one day I might have
been astonished, but like a cat which dwells with its own
surroundings more than with its owner, I always felt that
the house and its occupants were only incidental to my own
existence. My real life was lived alone or close to the animals
and the growing things around the farm. The fact that no
one took notice of what I said or did ceased soon to cause
me much bewilderment; but something happened to me at
this time which frightened me and shook the foundations of
my world for the time being.
I was sitting lazily on the porch at home, turning over
the leaves of my school-book when, looking up suddenly, I

saw my favourite Aunt Leon approach me. I had only seen
her a few times in my life because she lived with her family
some twenty miles away. I knew that the aunt I lived with
cared for her sister, Leon, very much and had been worried
of late about her health. Often I had heard mentioned in the
household that Aunt Leon had not been as well as usual. I
had not been to visit her for several months, so I was naturally
pleased when I saw that she had come to see us like this. I
noticed, as I got up to greet her how very tired she looked
and fearing that she was really ill, I reached out to take her
hand and help her to walk indoors. I shall always be sure
that she said to me, "I must go away now and take baby
with me." I waited to hear no more and fled within the
house to fetch my other aunt to help Leon. She looked most
astonished as I pulled her out of her chair and told her to
come quickly to see Aunt Leon. She hurried outside with me.
When we reached the door I saw that my Aunt Leon was
gone. I went into the garden and down the lane in search
of her but she was nowhere to be found.
When I returned my aunt questioned me closely as to
how her sister had looked and how she had been dressed.
Every detail of her weary expression and of her clothes was
stamped clearly on my brain and I described them minutely.
The baby that I had seen interested me most of all. Carefully
I had observed the little bundle, clasped to Aunt Leon's heart;
I had wanted to look at it more closely, but I had not dared
ask my aunt, since she seemed so tired. My story told, I
was full of questions as to what could have been happening
to Aunt Leon. My aunt did not seem to believe anything
that I described and told me that I had been cruel to play such
a practical joke on her. In vain I assured her that I had
really told her exactly what I had seen. She doubted my
sincerity and questioned me closely as to what I had previously
heard in the household about my Aunt Leon's new baby. I
told her I had heard nothing but she chided me for eaves
dropping about things that I was not supposed to hear. I
had overheard nothing about my aunt's new baby but she

did not believe me and told me that I was wicked to have
concocted such a story and that she must severely punish
me for having done so. I took my whipping silently as I
always did; but this time her fury against me was not easily
appeased.
That night I cried myself to sleep and in the morning I
awakened with an aching head. My body felt heavy as a
stone. I recalled the scene of the evening before when my
Aunt Leon had visited with her baby. It stood out so clearly
that I knew I could never have made up such a story. My
tears fell afresh and my heart ached as never before. At that
moment a cold hate of the aunt with whom I lived was born
in me and remained until she died. I spent the day wondering
how I could hurt her most deeply, so as to revenge myself
for all that she had made me suffer. Fear of her left me
forever, as I knew that I had become indifferent to her opinion
of me. The opportunity I sought in which to hurt her
presented itself on that very afternoon.
I was too ill in the morning to be sent to school, so I
was allowed to remain in bed until the middle of the day. In
the afternoon I went into the garden to lie quietly in the
shade. There I played by the stream and went idly to see
if there were ducks floating on the lake beyond. I saw the
baby ducklings which I sought, talking to themselves on the
water; I watched them dipping here and there and gaily
swimming in small circles. I knew in a flash that they were
the means of my revenge. My aunt loved her ducks and
would be deeply hurt if they came to any harm. Bending
over the water at the edge of the shore I caught each baby
bird as it passed close by me, and in quick succession I
held each one under the water until I had drowned the entire
brood. Then I laid the dead ducks in the grass beside me and
was immediately overcome with a terrible dread of my aunt's
wrath. I began to think, as I wondered, how she would
punish me, that now surely God must come and His punish
ment would be greater than any my aunt might visit upon me.
I remained rooted to the spot, frozen with fear, waiting for

God's wrath to fall. I felt that my life would surely be
wiped out after this last grave wrongdoing. The very inten
sity of my fear produced a strange state of suspended quiet,
in which I waited.
In this condition I looked at the ducks lying limp on the
grass beside me and almost hoped they might still be alive.
But at this moment something really startling did begin to
happen. The ducks were quiet but there was a movement
going on all around them. I saw, curling up from each little
body a grey smoke-like substance, rising in spiral form. This
fluid stuff began to move and curl as it rose and gradually I
saw it take on new shape as it moved away from the bodies
of these little dead ducks. Fear had now given way to
amazement in the face of this spectacle. I was joyful because
I knew in that moment that the ducks were "coming alive"
again. I had forgotten about their dead bodies lying limp
below and waited, with tense expectancy, to see them take
on new shape and run away.
I do not know how long I stayed, gripped in fearful
fascination. I only know that the punishment which must
surely follow my wrongdoing, would never prevent me from
trying to find out how the ducks had "escaped" me in that
strange way. I began to wonder whether all other creatures
also had this same fashion of escaping from life, as did these
ducks. The only way to find out for certain was to begin
to kill something else and watch what followed. All thoughts
of revenge on my aunt had now faded from my mind. The
only important thing for me now was to discover whether
or not death brought forth new life; and if this were true,
what kind of life did death produce?
For two weeks crows and little rabbits became the vic
tims of my search for knowledge. Then, of a sudden, came a
terrible revulsion against myself for all this killing that I
had done. The startling truth now came to me in a flash.
I had seen enough to know by then, that I had killed nothing
at all, but only had changed its form. As a result of know
ing this, I asked my uncle not to take me with him hunting

any more. I became sick from that time on, at thought of
the creatures that died. Anger shook me when I thought of
those who killed any living thing. A mouse caught in a trap
made me suffer, and a cold rage now turned me against the
dogs whenever they hunted little animals. The sight of the
cat stalking a bird became unbearable. The farm hands were
now my enemies when they were brutal to the animals. Every
night I shed tears for all the living things which were daily
killed, and I wept bitterly for those ducklings which I had
drowned.
After I had drowned the little ducks my uncle had come
upon the scene. He looked down at the dead ducks, then at
me. I found his presence a relief. There was no anger in
his voice or face, he just said, "You had better come with
me and see your aunt." When we found my aunt, my uncle
said to her, "You had better go to the pond and see what has
happened to your ducks." She looked at my uncle and then
at me, coldly, and went towards the pond as he suggested.
My uncle and I stood still awaiting her return and I did not
even think of the moment that would follow. When she
returned, he slipped away and left me with her alone.
Strangely enough, for the first time in my life she did not
punish me with a thrashing. She told me that I was such a
wicked child that I must be sent away from home. I was no
longer fit to live in her house. She spoke then at length of
God and His hurt and His wrath at my wrongdoing. I was
relieved to hear that I should be sent away even though I did
not know where; and I did not believe a word of it when she
said that God would punish me.
"Go," said my aunt, "go to your room and don't let me
see you again tonight; and ask God to forgive you." I was
sent to bed without supper. I did not care about the food
or anything she had said. I could only feel relief that I
would be leaving her very soon.
An hour later my aunt appeared in my room and woke
me from a sound sleep. She sat down beside me on the bed
in a kinder mood than of an hour before. Abruptly she

told me that she had just had news of my Aunt Leon's death
while giving birth to her baby and that the little one had
died also. Before I could say anything, my aunt said to me,
"Don't ever speak again of the things that you see for they
might come true." Then she left the room as abruptly as
she entered it. When she went away I was thoroughly fright
ened. In every corner of the room I seemed to see my Aunt
Leon and her baby, just as I had seen them in the vision of
the previous day. I shook with fear through the night but
recovered next morning to adjust to this new fact which I had
learnt—that a baby was born from the mother. I had never
been told how a baby was born until that moment, when my
aunt spoke to me of Aunt Leon's death, and its cause. The
excitement of this new discovery about babies banished my
sadness at Aunt Leon's death and considerably lessened the
shock that my prevision of her dying had caused me.

Chapter VIII
I SEARCH FOR THE MEANING OF DEATH
AND LIVE IN MY OWN LITTLE WORLD
HE vision of my Aunt Leon and the manner of her dying
-■- were all things which needed some explanation. My
repeated questions to those around me brought no helpful
answer. I was wise enough not to ask questions at school;
I knew that these things, however they might appear to me,
were not within the range of my schoolmates' understanding.
I went to the old people around the farm and questioned
them as to what they knew about the process of dying; they
could tell me little. I told them of my own experience in
seeing things that "came alive" again, after their death, but
they shook their heads and said nothing, as though the whole
matter was too much for them. One old woman assured me
that I had been bewitched by the fairies who lived in the
valleys and the glens and had so been made to see things which
fairy-people, but no human beings ever saw. I believed all that
I heard about the fairies, and made up my mind to see and
find them for myself. I had been told where they lived in
the valley near the lonely thorn trees or where the spring
water jutted from the earth. I sought for them in every wood
and glen, morning and evening. I was so obsessed with the
need of finding them that although I went to school, it was

an effort for me to remain awake there or take any interest
in my lessons.
I never found the fairies. Although "My Children" came
and seemed sympathetic to my search, they never quite knew
what I was looking for and so could not help me to find
them. What finally made me give up seeking for the little
people was my next new and exciting discovery about life.
Whilst I had been waiting so still and quiet for the fairies to
appear, I began to distinguish new sounds and new areas of
light around me and throughout the woods. I became aware
that everything had its own song and sound. With my back
to a tree or stone, I could hear the tones come from them
and vibrate through my own self. With my head on the
grass I could hear the sounds from within the earth like a
gentle murmur passing through the roots of the grass. I
began to be able to distinguish the song of the grass from
that of the insects beneath the sod. Around each tree, even
to its tiniest leaf, I noticed a surround that seemed to breathe
and move gently. I realized that this nebulous veil I saw
about all growing things was of the same order as those that
I had seen around people. These surrounds were like cradles
in which every animate creature or growing plant breathed and
was sustained. I knew that these enveloping forms gave them
health and protection to live and grow. Their substance
seemed to emanate from within and yet had a life of its own
from without which, if destroyed or crushed, would cause
death to the more solid living form which it enveloped and
sustained.
Lying thus in the grass and watching every moment in
the fields lest I should miss the "little people," I observed how
the living trees and shrubs and flowers drew their air and
colour from the dancing globules of light which filled, what
people know as space. Such globules I had first seen, long
before, in my room and I knew that the entire atmosphere
was made up of these little dancing balls of light. Now, for
the first time I discovered that these little whirling forms had
within them colour-substance which was eagerly sucked in

by the surround of every plant and animal. This, I realized,
was the way in which the plants received their colour and
their odour. I was definitely certain that this was so, for
under the midday sun I saw the globules drawn back from
the flowers by the intense heat of the sun and then absorbed
by its rays. In the early morning, and more particularly in
the twilight, the light-substance of the globules was stronger
and danced more swiftly toward the surround of all living
forms. They seemed glad at such times to give themselves
and their fluid-substance back to living things, as though
they would thus make up for their midday lack of vitality.
When the sun had gone and twilight had ended, I saw
the light globules intensify and grow stronger. Deeper
colour-substance living within these balls became more vivid
as they played in the dark. Now they gave themselves so
intensely to the flowers that the perfume of the blossoms grew
stronger and their petals more vigorous; the over-blown rose
revived for a moment and the drooping plants lifted their
leaves erect again. I knew that the night air whatever it
contained, charged and recharged all living things with new
and strange vitality. I realized that the plants and flowers
knew this too. I watched them feed themselves upon this
strange night force, and even hold this invigorating sub
stance greedily within the base of their bloom and the curl
of their leaves.
I also saw the globules dance in the moonlight in a
slower and more premeditated rhythm. I knew that the
influence of the moon's rays on the light-balls was far differ
ent from those of the sun. In the moonlight the little balls
grew strong like glass; their blue colour gave way to violet
and deep purple tones; they took on the light and colour of
night. As I watched the globules respond to the moon, I too
felt the effect of its light on my body. Under the influence
of the moon I threw off my clothes to let the light-substance
of the globules touch direct upon my body. When I returned
to my room from the garden and the night, I opened the
window wide and invited the globules to come and share

with me my sleep. I felt the melody of the dark and the
moonlight caught up and held in the dance of these little
balls of light.
I shared my new discoveries with none but "The Chil
dren." They nodded their heads; I was sure they under
stood. Apart from "The Children," I now needed no
companionship; I lived in my own little world. I had only
time, apart from them, for the sounds and the colours and
the movements of this new Universe.

Chapter IX
THE COMING OF THE GYPSIES
HEN I was ten the gypsies came with their caravan
▼ V and animals. I remembered them vaguely, from other
years, but on this occasion I saw them with new interest. For
the first time, my uncle allowed me to go with him when he
went out to show them where they might camp on his
property.
That first night I was impressed by the strange difference
of the gypsies to any of us. I wondered at their brilliant
kerchiefs, their gleaming bracelets and heavy earrings, which
even the men wore. I was intrigued by their sullen faces
and their downcast eyes which darted at one obliquely
instead of looking straight into one's eyes. The two solemn
gypsy babies interested me, even more than the women who
carried them; so silent and still were these infants that they
might not, I thought, have been alive. I lingered with my
uncle, watching every move as the gypsies prepared their
camp for the night.
Early next morning, before the household was awake, I
slipped away to the gypsy camp alone. They were cooking
their breakfast over a bright fire and barely looked up as I
approached. A very old woman whom I had not seen the
night before addressed me and bade me seat myself beside
her; a man moved to make room for me. I instinctively
knew that the old crone liked me and that she ruled the

family. The rest of the gypsies ignored me but that did
not matter, for I knew that she was my friend. So I sat
quietly and looked her up and down; though she was dirty
and unkempt I did not mind. I noticed that the gypsy men
hardly spoke to the women, unless to demand something, and
in a language which I did not understand. My first visit
to the gypsies was suddenly brought to an end by the
appearance of my uncle. He took me home and warned me
not to see too much of them.
I had waited impatiently all next day for the twilight
hour when my uncle said that I might approach the gypsy
camp. In the evening I went back to them and talked with
the old woman. I found her strangely sympathetic and
from the way she looked at me, rather than by anything she
said, I knew that I had found in her someone, at last, with
whom I could talk and who would understand me. The other
gypsies interested me less, although I liked to watch them
and hear them speak. I was fascinated by the dark sullen
heads of the two young men, bending over sheets of tin
which they made into cans and cooking utensils; and I loved
to watch their brown fingers lacing the red willow canes into
chairs and garden seats, or cutting up leather to make laces
for their shoes; so easily did their fingers work they might
have been working with magic. The babies I could examine
to my heart's content; they were most disappointing, since
they hardly moved and never cried. The two young women
seemed tired and unhappy, they had no authority of their
own in the camp. They quarrelled amongst themselves in
harsh and angry voices. When the women argued with each
other, the old man whom they addressed as the "Old One,"
bade them keep quiet; otherwise he hardly looked up from
the fire or spoke. He and the younger gypsies however,
regarded the old woman with respect. Her voice brought
them all to a strained attention; even the young men looked
up attentively when she addressed them. It was easy to see
that her word was law to the entire camp. I found that the
late evening was the best time to visit the gypsies, when

they gathered before the fire and rested. As I approached
them they would make room there for me. If no word of
greeting was spoken it made no difference; their eye contained
a welcome and that was enough.
The old woman's appearance was not prepossessing; she
always looked like a bundle of rags to which there was
neither beginning nor end. But her deeply furrowed face was
kind and her dark eyes were merry and young. In time I
had told her everything that had happened to me and all that
I secretly thought and felt and experienced. As I spoke to
her I watched her face for signs of disbelief; but there were
none, so then I knew that I could tell her of my visions and
of "The Children." She listened with interest to all I had to
say, remarking, "Do not be unhappy if others don't believe
you. It is not given to everyone to know and see such
things; not all my people can see that way, though we are
born of a mighty race to whom God gave direct knowledge,"
she said.
"Years ago, in the dim beyond, our peoples talked direct
with God; we have been wandering over the face of the
Earth longer than man remembers, and we have forgotten
the methods of our Fathers. I was born with the 'seeing eye'
and have the power to heal and to kill. The things you see
and hear are therefore not strange to me. I have seen and
heard beyond man's understanding ever since I could talk
and walk."
She told me then of her childhood in Poland and of her
first unhappy marriage in Spain. She slipped back to tales
of her youthful beauty which she said had always brought
great good to her tribe, in presents and privileges in whatever
country they had wandered. Her stories of the killing of her
rivals interested me most. When the moon was at the full
she said that she buried with special incantations a wheaten
sheaf, three feet deep, to represent her adversary. For three
weeks she waited; each night she worked the spell. After that
her rivals always wilted, grew sick and died in great pain.
She told stories of bewitching cows so that they fell sick

and gave no milk when a farmer refused her people food or
shelter. And she would put curses, she told me, by sign, on
the gates and doors of those who drove her away from their
farms.
It became a regular thing for me to visit the old woman
every day. She allowed me to accompany her when she went
to reconnoitre for the tribe. With unerring eye she always
went to the most prosperous farms and cottages. A well-filled
hen-roost made her chuckle with delight; she would remark,
"to night my soup will be good." We would often go to the
fields together to gather herbs for her seasoning and ingredients
for her potions and ointment. She taught me strange names
for all the flowers and told me the stories of these names.
She showed me all the plants she used for her concoctions
and told me which ones healed and which would kill. At
first she went with me on these trips but afterwards she sent
me out alone to reconnoitre for her food and gather the
leaves and roots for her mysterious brews. Although I loved
to wander with her by day, I waited with impatience for the
night to come when, unknown to the household, I would
leave my bed and cross the garden to slip down to the camp
and take my usual place beside the old woman at the fire.
In the wavering light, strange shadows flickered across their
faces; the old man played wild gypsy songs on a violin, which
he had made himself. The women rocked and crooned to
the babies; then, tapping their heels to the sharpened notes of
the music, the men sometimes broke into song.
The strange atmosphere, the weird shapes in the dark, and
the wild music all stirred me deeply. It was like my first
taste of heaven. I used to ask the old woman never to go
away, but if she had to leave I begged her to take me with
her; but she shook her head and said, "No, you mustn't
think of it." My aunt's threat of sending me away from
home was often repeated and this life of the gypsies seemed
to be a perfect way out of my troubles.
One night the old woman drew a black box from the
folds of her tattered shawl and showed me her treasures of

gold and silver, strange coins and amulets gleamed in the
dark, each, she said, possessing mystic powers. From the
bottom drawer of the box she drew forth a packet of Tarot
cards, greasy and torn; she began to tell me then the meaning
of the symbols. The old man looked up in protest as though
to stop her but she answered his disapproval by saying, "This
is a 'knowing one' who has come amongst us." He accepted
her statement and she went on telling me the story of the
cards. She taught me also to lay them out and read them
for myself whilst she made sand pictures and mysterious
signs. She afterwards showed me how to make the sand
pictures and even to read their meaning. But, she warned
me that I must never tell my family what she had shown
me, as this would surely arouse my uncle's disapproval of her
tribe.
One night when I was sitting close beside her, one of the
young gypsies came in, later than usual, bringing with him a
young girl who looked about thirteen to me. She seemed very
frightened. The young gypsy approached the older man and
spoke with him in angry tones. Then he pushed the girl away
from him; whilst he spoke to the woman, she crouched trem
bling by the fire. One of the young women then arose and
grudgingly gave her a drink. I was consumed with curiosity
to know what was happening, and asked the old woman to
tell me. She refused to answer and told me to go home. The
next day when I returned she was as kind as usual and said,
"Tonight there will be a wedding, and you must come and
join us." This surprised me, as I felt that the youngest woman
of the tribe was already the gypsy man's wife; she had, I
noted, looked hurt and angry and perhaps jealous, the night
before, at the sight of the other girl.
That evening when I reached the camp there was an air
of excitement and expectancy; the women were still cooking
a pot of food over the fire, the men were drinking together
and the old man was playing softly on his violin. Tonight
the old woman did not seem to notice my presence; she was
getting things out of the boxes, jewelry and bright coloured

shawls, in preparation for the wedding. Everyone looked
gayer than ever before in their special vivid shawls and ker
chiefs. The bride had lost her frightened look of the previous
night and now seemed bright and happy. She was wrapped,
by the old woman, in a brilliant red shawl, leaving her shoul
ders bare in gypsy fashion; she had no jewels and her long
black hair hung straight across
'
her shoulders. The other
young woman, whom I believed was already the gypsy's wife,
sat weeping quietly by herself. The rest of the camp was gay
and joyful. By the old woman's side was a small table con
taining coloured cups and strange instruments. I could make
out a small dagger lying beside them on the table.
To begin the ceremony they took the pot off the fire
and the old woman ladled some of its contents into the col
oured cups for each of the gypsies. They drank this solemnly
in silence and the rest of the pot was then taken and buried
in the earth by the old woman, without a word. Then the
old man built a fire of twigs and carefully sprinkled the
sticks with powders. Before setting the fire alight, he took
the right wrist of the young gypsy and bound it to the left
wrist of the girl. After that the old man lit the fire and
took the dagger from the table and quickly pierced the wrists
of both with a sudden thrust and blood spurted forth. I
saw the old man reach for a piece of linen to bind their
wrists together, but the sight of this blood made me sick and
I fled from the camp in terror.
Next morning, when I went back, the gypsies had
broken camp and gone away. I was sad at losing the old
woman; I felt I should never see her again. The stories she
told me remained with me and my enthusiasm to possess my
own herb garden grew out of my contact with her. I remem
ber the amusement in my uncle's face when that patch of
garden, which he had set aside for me, became a lurking
ground for strange weeds and herbs that I had come to love
and cultivate. I never saw these wild weeds as intruders;
to me, because of the old gypsy woman, they were always
the treasured healers of the garden. Day by day, as I dug

my plot of ground and watched the growing things develop,
I loved it more deeply. Every moment in which I could
escape the house, I lived with my strange herbs and flowers.
I was amply rewarded, for I began to discover how the
plants and blossoms received their perfume and their colour.
I saw the process whereby growing things receive their colour
through light, and I knew, without being told, that there
was indeed, an hidden and healing strength in my colour
world. I began to pretend that I too, as with the flowers,
could draw colour from the light; and now I have, strange to
relate, come to know that it is truly possible for me to do so.
I was quite certain that among my myriad flowers and plants,
each had a personality of its own. And just as I knew them,
I felt that they knew me. I became aware of all the strug
gles which went on amongst the growing things in the gar
den, and sensed all their loves and their joys and sorrows.
The life of the garden became an amazing world in
which an actual drama was lived out in my presence; there
fore my responsibility to love and help the garden grew. Now
I began to dislike cutting off the growth of the flowers as
much as I did the killing of animals; for I was certain
plants suffered as much as other living creatures when they
were separated from their stalks. Whenever any flowers were
cut in the garden, I would try to comfort them through sym
pathy for their pain. But then I began to make a marvelous
discovery; I found that my beloved flowers were able to
develop a different process of breathing in their new environ
ment and so survive the first shock of being separated from
their parent roots. It comforted me to know that all
plucked flowers could survive in this way. I would be up
with the dawn to watch the opening of the flower cups, and
at night I would slip away secretly, to surprise the flowers as
they went to sleep or wakened for the night. I came to
know also, the way that the midday sun would absorb the
perfume and steal the colour from the flowers, and how they

I AM SENT AWAY TO BOARDING SCHOOL
I DO not know how long I might have continued living
in my own discoveries, now silent and no longer speaking
of anything which concerned me, if my teacher had not
noticed my weariness, and that lessons were interrupted by
headaches and coughing. She drew my aunt's attention to
my run-down condition, and it was discovered that I was
on the verge of a complete collapse from bronchial catarrh
and measles. After that siege, I was never again a completely
healthy child. A series of illnesses followed which left me
subject to bronchitis. Only many years later did I realize
that I had at this time, developed tuberculosis, a family inher
itance, to which most of my mother's family had been sus
ceptible. When my teacher drew my aunt's attention to this
weakened condition, my aunt became kinder towards me and
took me to task for not having told her myself that I was
suffering.
When I recovered from this illness, my aunt decided that
I must now go away to boarding school because she was
unable to control my reckless habits of running out of doors
inadequately clothed at all hours of the day and night. It
gave me no feeling of sadness to say farewell either to my
aunt or the day school. I only worried as to how my "Unseen
Children" would take my departure and whether they would
follow me. The necessity of leaving my room and the gar

den gave me the greatest unhappiness; I felt that somehow I
was being parted from something which I should never know
again. I regretted too, losing the happy associations with my
uncle; he had not been well for some months and I sensed
that we would never have such companionship together again.
I dreaded the prospect of boarding school because I was sure
I should be confined indoors a great part of each day. I was
never happy in a house without a garden; a house without a
garden was inconceivable to me. I had seen city houses and
shuddered at the prospect of ever having to live in one. To
be happy I had to be related to all growing things; it was
the only way in which I felt secure and complete. In spite
of my reluctance at leaving home, I parted from my aunt
without regret.
The new school made no great appeal to me. Situated in
Dublin within an old square, the house was a cheerful and
friendly three-storied Regency building. The Principal was a
shadowy creature who had little to say at any time; she did
not impress me when I was brought to her on my arrival; I
am not even sure that she saw me. I suppose a new girl
meant little to her anyway; she seemed more concerned with
her sheet of figures than her pupils. Her two sisters, both
dressed in black were present; they spoke in hushed tones and
took charge of the running of the establishment. They
seemed gentle when they took me to my room.
There were sixty girls, ranging from ten to sixteen, in
the school. This was a strict Protestant establishment, chosen
by my aunt to help me overcome and forget the Roman
Catholic teachings. I shared a dormitory with five others;
although these girls were older than I, I felt immediately that
I would have no trouble in handling them. I was flattered
that the older girls took me up, treating me as one of their
own age, and making me their confidante. They liked my
recklessness and my ability to enter into all kinds of pranks
which upset the law and order of the school.
My knowledge of Biblical lore helped me much at first;
the fact that I could now recite from the Bible, as well as give

f studies as English, History and Mathematics. But troubles

began immediately with French, German and Music. The
same teacher taught me French and German. I knew from the
first that she disliked me and I felt the same way about her.
I found her perfunctory and slack in her teaching. I was
never willing to curry favour with her as some of the others
did. When she gave me dry grammar rules to learn by heart,
I would ask her to give me examples of how to use them.
She would become angry and say "You are not far enough
advanced for that, as yet."
I cannot absorb information unless I hear it first and
see it written down. I could learn things by writing and
re-writing, but never by repeating them by rote. My insistence
on trying to understand and learn in my own way, was mis
understood and mistakenly attributed to impertinence. My
antagonism to this teacher caused me to create fresh disturb
ance whenever I could. She assumed therefore, that every
sign of disorder in the classroom was caused by me, and so
she punished me for every misdemeanour in our group. There
was an open feud between us and as it grew deeper it became
impossible for me to learn or absorb anything from her. Due
to the resistance she set up in me, I have never, to this day,
been able to learn any foreign language.
Music I loved until I began to study it at school. I was
discouraged and scolded there because I sang off key. When
the teacher asked me to sing or play scales, I tried to place
additional half-tones between the usual whole notes. I was
reprimanded for this. I could not make her understand that
I heard the finer intervals of sound between the ordinary notes
of the scale. I felt those tones ought to have some location
on the piano keyboard before me.
Again and again she would say, "Listen to this," while
she played over the scale and then would add "There are no
other notes to be heard." As she played those never-ending
scales, 'I would hear each note split and become two tones, the

impasse over this; she refused to teach me any longer, saying
that I was a willful and disobedient child and would not listen
to any scales. I was hurt and vexed with the teacher when
she said that I could not hear. I knew that I heard what
she heard and much more besides. Once in trying to defend
myself I told her that I heard sounds not only with my ears,
but felt them pass through my spine and vibrate at the knees.
Her answer was "You can lie and fool other people, but not
me." That was the last time she taught me. Again I was.
forced back into my own world of listening and seeing which
no one understood or believed in. It was twenty years before
I obtained objective confirmation that my hearing and seeing
as a child, was bound up with my actual clairaudient and clai '-
voyant faculties.
The moment came when I could not fight any longer
against the misunderstandings and accusations of the teachers.
I lay awake, weeping at nights over my failure to adjust
myself to the point of view which met me at school. Natur
ally curious and eager to learn, I wanted passionately to
understand music and languages. I felt now that my spirit
was breaking. I was conscientiously telling my teacher's the
truth of what I saw and heard and felt; they would not
believe me.
The break-down in my health soon followed in the wake
of my despair; I had to be taken home. I developed bronchial
pneumonia which later gave way to whooping cough and I
was weak and sickly for many months. This return home
was a merciful release from my nights of agony and my days
of frustration at school. One day when 1 was recovering, I
overheard the doctor telling my aunt that it was a miracle I
had not died. I had shown, he said, no will to live. I knew
he was right. I was exhausted, a child fighting against a
world that had never understood the truth of any of my
experiences.
I went back to school when I recovered. My attitude
had changed. I would, as far as I was able, carry through

ance. I hated the idea, but saw no other way out. Everyone
at school seemed glad to see me; the teachers were kinder in
their treatment, but still objected to what they termed by
incorrigible behaviour. They did not change my point of
view; I withdrew and gave up trying to study or work for I
could not carry the full school program, because I had not
yet regained my normal health. The doctor had insisted that
my illness was due to cramming and overwork and at last
the teachers were solicitous and allowed me special privileges,
which made me the envy of all my schoolmates.

Chapter XI
MY UNCLE'S DEATH AND MY "VISION" OF HIM
T iTHEN I was recovering at home from bronchial pneu-
▼ ▼ monia, the doctor made frequent calls on my uncle,
who was visibly tired and coughed a great deal. Suddenly, one
day, my aunt called me to my uncle's room. She was obviously
upset, a state I had never known her in before. I entered the
room and stood looking down at him. He was still, barely
breathing. I knew he was dying, and once again the fascination
of death was upon me. He looked at me with what seemed to
be a troubled gaze, essayed to speak, but no words came. I
touched his hands gently —they were cold. I could think of
nothing to say, and could only remember how often I had
clutched his hand before, to steady myself in our walks in the
woods and fields. Although we had not walked together since
I had been at school, I now felt a terrific need for his pres
ence. I cannot say that I was upset emotionally, but that
I felt terribly empty as though a hole had been made in my
head and my brain seemed to be slipping away. How long
I lived in this sensation, I do not know. When my uncle died
events for some time had no meaning for me. The loss of
my uncle through these days preceding his burial was a deep
pain. To look ahead was to feel his loss more keenly. I could
not bear to contemplate life with my aunt without him; I
realized how vastly important to my life there he had been.

He alone had made it bearable, interpreting my needs and
wishes to my aunt when I could not.
Through these days no one expressed sympathy with my
aunt, without turning to me and saying, "Now you must be
a comfort to your aunt." I, who had never known the
meaning of being comforted was now expected to comfort
another.
I did not go near my uncle's room after he died. From
my observations of what happened at death I was sure he
was not there any more. In my own mind I was certain he
had tired of living and escaped his body. So surely did I
believe this that on the day arranged for his funeral, I went
to the garden where he liked to sit in the sun and spoke
aloud to him, saying, I at least understood why he had gone
away. It never occurred to me to doubt that he had heard
me. When the time came for the body to be removed from
the house I refused to go to the cemetery. On the Sunday
following his funeral I was given a spray of flowers to place
on his grave. I carried them to the churchyard but resenting
the idea that his body should want them, I threw them out
of sight over the churchyard wall. I never could bear to
approach his grave nor the grave of anyone I have loved.
A few weeks after my uncle died, I was sitting in my
own room in the twilight feeling very restless and depressed.
I had not been allowed out that day because my chest was
troubling me. As I was waiting for the lamps to be brought
in, the door opened quietly. There in the lamp light of the
hallway I saw my dear uncle, standing clearly before me. I
was surprised how well he looked for in the weeks before his
death he had seemed feeble and worn. Now he appeared as
before, erect and strong. I was overcome with joy at seeing
him again and he showed himself happy to be back with me.
He spoke to me and asked that I obey the wishes of my
aunt, whenever possible. He said he appreciated the difficul
ties of my present life with her, and predicted that in two
years time I should be free to leave her and go to London.
Then, before I had time to ask any questions the door closed

quietly and he was gone. My first impulse was to run after
him but I found myself rooted to the spot. Gradually it
dawned on me that he had gone and I could no longer reach
him. Suddenly I collapsed in a chair and tried to under
stand what had happened. By the time the lamps were lit, I
had begun to ask myself whether I dared tell anyone of this
experience. As the night came on I began to feel at peace,
knowing definitely for the first time that death was truly a
"coming alive" again, in some place beyond my ordinary seeing.
At first I felt strangely exhilarated by my uncle's unex
pected visit; but later, came a sense of terrible emptiness at
his going. The conviction grew deep within me that my
uncle knew my needs and would continue to care for me,
with the same* understanding as he had shown before his
death. It never occurred to me that I had seen a ghost, or
that anything strange had taken place. I simply explained
the appearance of my uncle to myself by my knowing that
all things went "out there," and that he too shared that fate.
Never again did my uncle visit me. Nevertheless I continued
to believe that he was still close to me and ready to hear
whenever I spoke. This knowledge comforted me. Who
would understand this experience of my uncle's return? . It
was not, I knew, to be shared with anybody.

Chapter XII
I PURSUE THE MEANING OF DEATH
THAT
spring, my delight in the isolation of my room and
the garden was rudely broken by the homecoming of my
cousin Ann. She had always been a mystery and I had never
given much thought to her brief visits. But now, my aunt
informed me Ann had been ordered by the doctor to take a
long rest and give up her work.
Since my uncle's death my aunt had lost her grip on
life and her health had broken down. So now I heard that
I was to be turned out of my beloved room which contained
all the secrets of my life; I had to gather myself up and
leave this refuge from whence I could, at night or dawn,
slip out into the garden and escape into the fields for untold
hours; precious hours that had been my very own to be lived
with the things I knew and loved. A room upstairs, which
had been my uncle's study now became mine. It was pleas
ant and sunny and the roses peeped in at the windows. Under
other circumstances I might have loved that room which in
retrospect, appears to have been a charming haven for any
child; but my longing for the freedom of the garden made
my new room take on for me the air of a prison. It was true
that this room also faced the garden, but as I was now so high
above it, I felt myself miles away from the growing green
things which I loved.

Ann's homecoming was a source of joy to my aunt, but
to me it was a catastrophe. I never grew accustomed to her.
She had been undergoing cures abroad for two or three years
and that was why I had not seen her for a long time. My
aunt, realizing that Ann's condition was hopeless, had brought
her home. That autumn she died suddenly. Since I had
scarcely known her, her death did not touch me. It was
the second death of a human being I had known, but it dis
turbed me less than that of my uncle; certainly less than
that of the little animals that I had killed.
Within a few hours after my cousin's death, I asked for
permission to visit her room. I tip-toed in and remained quiet,
lost in wonderment at where the personality of Ann might
now have gone. Again, as with the little ducks, I saw, rising
above Ann's body, a curling, shadowy grey substance. When
I entered the room it was already gathering itself with slow
movement, into a spiral shape which finally disappeared into
the atmosphere above her head. I was most interested to dis
cover that this process of separation took, with the human
body, hours longer than when the shadowy substance separated r
from the bodies of the little ducks.
While I had been able to escape attending my uncle's
funeral, I was forced to be present at Ann's. The same dread
of such lugubrious ceremonies was upon me now, as when my
uncle died. I was repelled by the groups of mourners and
the obvious satisfaction they derived from their black clothes
and their short lived grief. The minister began the burial
service with solemnity, but before it was half over he was
hurrying it unceremoniously to a close. I moved quietly to
the edge of the grave as he spoke and looked in to watch
them lower the coffin. My head swam, and I felt suddenly
sick. I caught hold of my aunt's arm and begged her per
mission to go home, but she would not let me go.
A sudden sense of indignation overwhelmed me at the
false mourning of my aunt and those around her, about the
rightful and inevitable process of death. I knew that in the
animal world, there came a clean, natural departure from the

physical form, at the moment of dying. This whole dreary
set-up of funeral ceremony, I was convinced, had no relation
to the truly simple changes which occurred to all creatures,
at the moment, which human beings call death. This rhythmic
transformation which I had watched, again and again, with
all living creatures, gave me no sense of finality, but rather
of a continuous and rhythmic movement toward fresh adven
ture. In living close to the animal and plant worlds, I had
come to understand that there seemed little difference between
birth and death, to any living creatures excepting the human.
How much unnecessary and hopeless misery might have been
spared to man had he observed as I had the true nature of
birth and death. I knew both of these processes of change
to be joyful and equally creative. Why, since the balance of
the whole universe is kept so perfectly by Infinite Direction,
must man alone, of all living creatures, fear for his place in
the scheme of things, and be so lost and frightened in facing
what he calls death?
After Ann's passing, my aunt's attitude underwent a
change. She became gentle with me and punished me less.
If she did so, it no longer took a physical form. She would
set me sections of the Bible to learn by heart; but this was
no real punishment, as I enjoyed that immensely. I then took
the Bible, as do many others, to be literally true. God became
a reality to me and I grew fond of this "Invisible Old Man of
the Skies," as I called Him. I took keen pleasure in His
ability to know what all His People were up to. I loved the
idea that He was always causing wars, and tearing peoples
asunder. This idea of continual punishment came so close
to my own life at home that I began to put my aunt in the
same category as God. Sometimes, however, I thought He
overdid the punishment of His People, and as I read more
of the Bible I felt less sympathy with His severe measures.
Gradually I found my sympathies shifting altogether from
the thundering God of Genesis to the serene beauty of the
Psalms.

Chapter XIII
I APPROACH THE MYSTERY OF CONFIRMATION
MY
uncle had expected me to be confirmed in the Eng
lish Established Church and the school was preparing
me for this, before his death. I was looking forward to the
ceremony with anticipation; although I had never obtained
my aunt's permission to attend a similar service in the Cath
olic church, I had, some years before, gone to the chapel and
secretly watched the confirmation of my Catholic schoolmates.
These girls were not more than eight or nine years old;
before the ceremony they seemed awed and impressed by the
service in which they were about to participate. I was dis
appointed, when I tried to question them, to find that they
understood very little of the actual meaning of this Sacrament
they were about to undergo. So, feeling that I had to see it
for myself in order to more completely understand it in spite
of my aunt's command, I hid myself secretly in the gallery
of the chapel. In that position I was far enough from the
altar to be impressed by both the mystery and the beauty of
the ritual of the Confirmation Mass. After it was over I
talked to the children who had been confirmed and expected
that those who had participated in the service would be even
more deeply moved than I. This was not so; they had not
been stirred at all by this experience, although they were

pleasantly excited by their new white dresses, their wreaths
of flowers and filmy veils, and they felt the importance of
making their first communion on the coming Sunday.
When I was twelve years old I came home from boarding
school to be confirmed myself, in the Church of England.
In spite of the slight impression confirmation had made on
those Catholic children whom I had watched go through this
ceremony some years before, I felt sure that something deep
and profound must be about to happen to me, through my
own experience, or my uncle would never have placed such
emphasis upon it.
The day came at last. I was full of expectancy. That
morning I re-read my catechism, to be very sure that I
understood the importance of that Sacrament in which I was
about to participate. With half a dozen other girls I knelt
by the communion rail, full of hope and deeply moved by the
expectation of being transformed into a graver and more
responsible person. My first shock came when I looked up
and saw the Bishop. He was a gross, red faced, heavy handed
man. I knew immediately that he could not be the means of
bringing me the deep and mystical experience for which I was
hoping. I tried to curb and deny this impression to myself,
but it was useless. I watched, out of the corner of my eye,
as his coarse hands gave grudging benediction, and I really
dreaded the moment when he would finally move up the line
of children and touch my head. The memory of the Catholic
confirmation I had witnessed flashed
'
back into my mind.
I could see again the kindly Catholic prelate placing his hands
with gentle blessing on the heads of my schoolmates. I could
still remember how deeply moved I had then been, by the
mystical setting and the harmonious chanting and intoning
of the priests. Here, in this church there was neither beauty
nor true emotion; everything was hurried, perfunctory and
cold.
When my confirmation was over, I went home and
straightway sought the end of the garden, where my uncle
used to love to sit. I spoke aloud to him, knowing that he

would hear me. I said, "I am so sorry, I'm afraid I have
disappointed you. My confirmation has not changed anything
in my life, as I had hoped. How can I take on new life and
responsibility when I do not understand the pledges I made
to renounce 'The Devil and all his Works and the Lusts of
the Flesh'?" I tried to explain to this uncle who had died
that all this talk of the Devil and temptations of the flesh
meant nothing at all to me. Until now I had never been
on speaking terms with the Devil and his works, so how then
could I renounce them. I was heartbroken and wept and
through my tears I sobbed to my uncle, "If you had only
been here you would have helped me to understand."
That evening I asked my aunt why I had gone through
the confirmation service without emotion or change of spirit.
Her answer to me was, "I suppose you hardened your heart
against God." That left me bereft of any hope to understand.
I wept the night away in my bed, more utterly alone and at
sea than I had ever been before. That was the end of all my
hope of spiritual regeneration.

Chapter XIV
I TAKE MY FIRST COMMUNION
AFTER
recovering from the disillusion of my confirmation,
a faint hope came to me that in my first communion I
might still experience the rebirth of myself, which I had
missed in the previous ceremony. I went to the early morning
communion service on Sunday, again hoping that at this
moment I should feel the Presence of the Host. The whispered
words, "Take this and eat," accompanied by the participation
in the ritual of Bread and "Wine, brought me no sense
of a Potent Presence. I left the communion rail, realizing
again that this minister of God who was a sickly man, was
no adequate representative of God's Grace on Earth. I knew
in a flash that whoever God was, he was not to blame for the
perfunctory and empty interpretation of His Words and Works,
given by those consecrated as His ministers in the Church.
I had come to realize that these men of God, spoke of Him
in the same tone of voice as they enquired about the weather
and their next meal.
After my first communion, since I was still forced to go
to church .by my aunt, I developed a different attitude.
I listened and watched critically, finding fault with the
readings of the texts by the minister, and I took special glee
in noticing how often the old fellow repeated the same sermons.
The nobility of our countryside came to church, and sat apart
from the crowd below. They paid for their pews in the

galleries, which were for only the titled families. I watched
a certain baronet look down from his height and count his
retinue of servants in the pews reserved for them in the aisle
below. If any of them had dared to miss a service, I knew
that they would be reprimanded. As the baronet sat down
in his seat, I could see him run his finger around the hymn
books on the stands, looking for dust with his chamois-gloved
hand. This he did each Sunday and woe to the verger if any
dust were found. I knew the verger would never have a
chance to listen to the Word of God without interruption.
He was kept too busy regulating the furnace, to keep the
temperature of the church bearable.
Often his Lordship arrived early, in search of trouble,
and when his pew was not in order, would even interrupt the
bell-ringing of the verger and roundly abuse him with such
words as, "What the b hell does this mean, leaving these
dead flowers under the memorial window of my family?"
This happened so regularly that it became for me, part of the
Sunday ritual. The old baronet had often threatened me
with corporal punishment, if I did not curtsey suitably when
he appeared.
Our family pew was in the rear of the church, near the
font. From there I had a full view of the local community
coming in Sunday attire to worship God. The more prosperous
ones sat in front in their spruce clothes, the poorer ones were
lined up behind them, dressed in their faded black. Sometimes
I tried to imagine what would happen if one poor woman,
more daring than the rest, should come to service with a vivid
poppy in her hat or dressed in some unexpected and brilliant
colour. I wondered too, if all this dull monotony of our
Sunday service gave God any pleasure. There were moments
when I had an unholy wish that God would really come and
manifest His Presence to this dozing congregation. How
startled and afraid they would then be, to find that he did
actually exist. This then was the way I imagined the drama
of God being played, each Sunday morning, when I was
forced against my will, to attend church services.

Chapter XV
I MEET MY FIRST BOY FRIEND
AFTER
first communion I went back to school feeling
that something should have happened to me even if I
felt no change. I therefore, began to pretend to know a
great deal more than I really did. On my return to school
the older girls began to take me into their confidence at night
in the dormitory. Commenting on my new grown-up-ness,
they began to tell me of their budding romances. Most of
these opened with the exchange of notes with boys in a nearby
school. As in most Irish boarding schools of that day, we
went out in the afternoons in our dark uniforms, always
walking two by two in what we called a "crocodile." Accom
panied by two teachers who conducted the promenade, the
tallest girls were at the front, the shortest ones at the rear.
Although I was fairly tall, I often manoeuvred to walk with
one of the smaller girls, so as to be at the end of the line.
This was a strategic position; there I was beyond the direct
supervision of the teacher's eyes and was free to pass messages
for the other girls to a waiting scout from the boys' school.
He in turn would carry these missives to the boys they were
meant for. I enjoyed winning the approval of the older girls
for the way that I transmitted their letters. But I never had
any personal interest in all this exchange of messages.
Contact or communication between school boys and girls
is absolutely prohibited in Ireland, either during or after

classes. But as soon as a girl leaves school she is expected to
settle down and marry. In Ireland of that day, there was
little chance of a girl having a professional career; marriage
was the only solution for most of them. This strained and
repressed attitude towards normal companionships between
growing boys and girls resulted in an hysterical undercurrent
of secret manoeuvring. This atmosphere both repelled and
excited me. The favourite places for exchanging confidences
were the dormitories at night and during church service on
Sundays. At church the boys and girls were under one roof
together, for morning and evening services.
In church I gradually became aware of a strikingly tall,
good-looking young man who watched me on successive Sun
days as I came and went from church. When he caught me
looking up he smiled at me and I smiled back. A few weeks
later, one of the older girls for whom I constantly delivered
notes, came to me with a very mysterious air and confided to
me that several of the girls had been in the habit of escaping
from school at night, for secret meetings with the boys from
a neighboring school. She said she had been instructed to
bring me along to meet someone who wanted to know me.
But she gave me no details. This was the first I knew of the
secret meetings. I was very thrilled at the prospect of the
adventure and went with her that evening when she escaped
to meet her special friend. I was pleasantly surprised to find
that the boy who wanted to know me was the admirer who
had smiled at me so often in church. He was older than
most of the school boys and was studying medicine at Trinity;
his home was in the Argentine. Our first meeting was easy
and natural. He apologised for the necessity of meeting me
in this secret way but knew no other means of getting in
touch with me. He was under the impression, from seeing
me at church, that I was a good deal older than I really was,
and he was quite concerned when he realized that I was less
than thirteen and that he was already twenty-four.

Chapter XVI
I AM EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL
AFTER
this meeting I went back to my dormitory
pleasantly excited but with an uncomfortable feeling
that the whole escapade was wrong and that I had not only
failed myself, but that I had exposed myself to justifiable
reprimand, should my secret rendezvous be discovered. Ac
customed as I was to punishment, I had, nevertheless, been
comforted by knowing that up to that time I had not acted
wrongly, according to my own standards. Now I knew that
I had not only broken the law of the school, but that I had
entered into something which gave me an uncomfortable sense
of guilt. When I expressed this, next day, to the girl who
had been my companion, she said: "Don't be silly! Everyone
else breaks out of school to meet the boys, why shouldn't we?"
This answer did not make me feel any less guilty. But
the days went by and I began to feel less troubled and even
hoped that I might again accompany her to meet our boys.
I had no longer any qualms about going.
When we met again, my South American friend was as
happy to see me as I was to be with him. We walked into
the Park and sat down on a bench. As we sat beside each
other, he took hold of my hands and explained to me quite
seriously, what the inevitable outcome of these meetings might
be. For the first time, I heard the explanation of the meaning
of sex, and he, being a medical student almost twice my age,

stressed his own sense of responsibility about our conduct. He
told me that he was surprised to find that I was only thirteen;
my appearance and bearing had given him the impression that
I was much older. He told me that if he had known I was
so young, he would never have sent me the message to meet
him. He warned me too, that my maturity while still such
a child, might lead me into situations with other boys for
which I was not prepared. He was astonished to find that I
had no sex knowledge of myself, instilled, either at home or at
school, and he directed my reading on this subject for the
future.
I had listened eagerly to all he had to say. Whilst I had
observed the process of life and death in nature and the sex
process in animals, I had never thought of any of these
principles as having any practical relation to my own life.
On the way home, as we walked together, it occurred to me
that the happiness I felt in the nearness and companionship
of this new friend, was perhaps connected with what the
catechism called, "The sinful lusts of the flesh." Weighed
down by this thought, I went back to school with a depressing
sense of the responsibility of growing up and feeling that it
was not going to be such a pleasant adventure after all.
I went back to the appointed place to meet my school
chum, so that we might return to the dormitory together. She
was not there and I hurried back only to find that she had
reached school before me; some of the girls were bending
over her bed as she wept brokenheartedly. They tried in vain
to still her sobs. All I could find out from these frightened
girls was that "something terrible had happened." I guessed
that what had occurred to her was probably the "tragic
consequences" my friend had already warned me about. I
went to bed very disturbed, dreading the approach of morning.
When the Principal sent for me, my schoolmate was already
there in her office. Frightened at her bitter experience, she
had gone to the Head of the School, not only to confess what
had occurred to her and to me the night before, but also to
expose the whole system, by which the girls in school escaped

at night, to meet their boy friends outside. My share in the
whole sorry business seemed grave, for I had been with her.
So, I too, was forced to tell all I knew and freely admitted
my responsibility in disgracing the good name of the school.
I felt myself to be an outcast and a sinner. I did not know
how the other girls felt.
Next day I was expelled from school and sent home in
disgrace. There, I had to face the anger and condemnation
of my aunt. When I reached home, she met me at the station.
Her greetings were abrupt and cold. Neither of us spoke a
word during the drive home, but when we reached the house
she told me to go to my room where I would get my tea, and
as soon as I had finished it I was to come downstairs and give
her some explanation of my unfortunate conduct at school.
As I came in to see my aunt, I felt relieved that, at last, this
was to be the end of my misery. Any punishment I felt
would seem a welcome relief after the confusion of the last
few days. When I saw her I decided not to beat about the
bush, but to tell her the truth about everything that had
happened. As I explained how the adventure began, she pressed
me to continue, saying, "What did the young man talk to
you about?" When I told her that he had explained to me
the true meaning of sex, and helped me to understand what
risks there were for a girl out in the world alone without
this understanding, she interrupted to say, "Aren't you ashamed
of your sinful and venial behaviour?" I answered that while I
was sorry for breaking the school rules, I had no sense of
personal shame or disgrace for what I had done. I was eager
to get through with her and take my punishment so that I
might again be alone and at peace with myself. My interview
ended with her final words, "Now go to your bed, and by
morning I will have decided what to do with you and I will
tell you about your parents."
I guessed by the tone of her voice that tomorrow's
disclosures about my parents, who had died when I was an

Chapter XVII
I HEAR, AT LAST, THE STORY OF MY DEAD PARENTS
NEXT
morning my aunt was distant and cold and made
me feel afresh, the enormity of my conduct. Without
any explanation, she handed me two photographs of a young
woman, whom I recognised as the "Anna" belonging to
"Anthony." In a vague way I had thought of these two
people as being my father and mother, without attaching
importance to what such a relationship implied. Handing me
the two pictures, my aunt said, "This was your mother as a
girl, and at the time of her marriage. I prayed when she died
that you might die too, and be spared her inheritance, for it
was a bad one. Your mother was like my own child. She
was the youngest of a family of thirteen, of which I was the
oldest. Your grandmother's health failed after your mother's
birth, so I became for a time, responsible for the family,
especially for her, a growing babe. I loved her as though she
were by own child. She was very unlike the other children
in the family, and had a wayward and independent nature
like you. She loved the pleasant and artistic things of life
and did not fit into the rigid family tradition.
Your grandmother, a French woman, loved this last child
very dearly and gave permission for her to be educated abroad,
even though this was bitterly opposed by other members of
the family. She went to school in Belgium and later on was
allowed to visit our mother's relatives and friends in France

and Algiers. On one of these trips to Algiers, she met a young
Spaniard and corresponded with him. When it was found
that she was taking his attentions seriously and considering
him as a suitor, our parents forbade the correspondence. He
was a Roman Catholic and besides he had neither position nor
money. Our parents would never consent to your mother
marrying someone who was not of her own faith; she was
strictly raised, as we all were, in the Presbyterian Church.
Our parents had hoped that she would marry a man of her
own faith, well-known to them both, a young clergyman who
had been devoted to your mother, even as a child. She seemed
to conform to their point of view for her future, and to have
given up the young Spaniard as a suitor. The preparations
went on in the family for her impending marriage to the
clergyman but on the eve of the ceremony, she disappeared
without giving any explanation as to where she was going.
"I was convinced that she had gone to her Spaniard. I
had never been wholly deceived into believing from her
acquiescent demeanour, as did the rest of the family, that she
had given him up. Our father and mother spent days of
anxiety trying to discover her whereabouts; then came a
letter telling them only that she was in Paris, whither she had
gone to marry her Spaniard. The family, outraged by your
mother's marriage to a man who was a stranger to her faith
and one who had nothing to offer her in either position or
wealth, forbade her even to communicate with any member
of our family again, and nothing more was heard of her for
four months.
"Then came a letter to our mother telling her that she
was to have a child. She was unhappy and afraid to be alone
and asked permission to return to Ireland and have her child
in her home. Her parents would not receive her, but I, who
had recently married, told her to come to me. She came with
her husband.
"From the first, I did not like him. He bitterly resented
the attitude of the family towards him." My aunt turned to
me and explained, "You see, he had no right to be resentful.

He had neither position nor money when he married your
mother, and besides that, he was a Roman Catholic. I could
not bear to have him in the house; there could never be any
peace between us. He found a position as private secretary
which took him away from my home; then, as soon as he had
enough money, he took a little cottage not far from us where
your mother went to live until you were born.
"During all this time before your birth, your mother was
very unhappy, because her parents still refused to receive her.
Under these circumstances, I gave her all the love I had, but
this was not enough to give her peace. She grew sick and
unhappy before your birth and she was made miserable by
your father's hate of her family. He was moody and resentful
and therefore, he often became irritable with her. I might
have been sorry for him then, but I could never forgive him
for having taken her away from our Church and home. He
soon became bitterly jealous of my influence over her.
"You were born to her with great difficulty. She hoped
that your coming would be the means of bringing about that
reconciliation with the family for which she still longed. But
I told her, when she was up again, that our mother and father
would never forgive her. I knew, too well, that for them,
the barriers of religion could never be dropped. Your father
could never be accepted in our family.
"The next day I saw your mother's lifeless body being
lifted from the well in the garden. After that I could never
bear to see your father again. I then insisted that you must
be brought up by me in our religion, but I gave in to your
uncle later and allowed you to become a member of the
Established Church to which he belonged. Your father had
hoped to take you away and have you brought up by his
sister. This, our family would not allow. Six weeks after
your mother's death, your father shot himself in the office of
his employer. Later, I had your name changed from Vancho
to that of your uncle.
"I have told you today the story of your parents, to
show you how easy it is for the child of two such tempera

mental people to sin. You see how your mother and father
were punished for their wrongdoing. The laws of God cannot
be set aside. Don't forget you have their blood in your veins.
I have prayed often, that this heritage might not come out in
your behaviour. Already you show a tendency to looseness.
Your mother too, was wayward and headstrong. Never forget
how she gave way to the desires of the flesh with a foreigner
and a Catholic who had nothing to offer her and was in no
way her equal. The lust that overcame your mother ended in
shame and disgrace to our family. Beware that your own
seeking for knowledge may not be a cloak for a desire to fall
away from spiritual grace. Unless you can turn to God and
your Church and admit your sins, it will be too late to seek
redemption. I feel it is not possible to send you to a boarding
school again, but if you are at home and go daily to school,
under my personal supervision you may learn to conduct
yourself properly."
The tragedy of my parents' deaths failed to bring home to
me the moral that my aunt had hoped to point out. I saw
only in their sad story the injustice and intolerance of the
family which had really caused their deaths; sympathy and
understanding might have helped them to live. I could dis
cover no sin in the love and marriage of my parents. Since
already I took neither the Protestant nor Roman Catholic
religions very seriously, I failed completely to see the enormity
of my mother's crime in marrying a Catholic. I knew that
I would feel that it was horrible for any two people in the
world, whether close to me or not, to be prevented from doing
what they really wanted. This revelation of my parents'
history did not make them seem any more real than they had
been before. What remained with me was an intense hatred
of my aunt's intolerance, and a recognition that she had, that
day, put an even greater barrier between us and our under
standing of each other.
My increasing unhappiness made me seek "My Children"
more than ever. They had visited me less often at boarding
school and I hoped, now, that I was back again, that we would

ment, they came less often. At about thirteen, "My Children"
went away as suddenly as they had come, when I was four.
Since then, I have often wondered why when I seemed to

Chapter XVIII
FROM CHURCH TO POLITICS— MY ARRIVAL
IN LONDON
NOW
that I was living at home again, formal religion
had to be taken up in my aunt's household. This
forced me to ask myself, again, whether the Protestant or
Catholic Church could give me the spiritual comfort which I
sought from religion. To find this out, I went to the services
of both churches. Now, however, neither of them gave me
anything. In my childish way I believed I had already found
out too much about the limitations of those responsible for
the destiny and teaching of both religions.
I had heard the Catholic children prepare for Confession
and was shocked to find that for them the Confessional was
no means of spiritual release, but a place where perfunctory
peccadillos could be recited each week to the priest. I there
fore, came to the conclusion that Confession, to which that
Church attaches so much importance, was for most of my
schoolmates merely an empty formula. Yet even today, I
know that if I had to go to church, I would prefer contact
with the mystery and emotional fervour of the Catholic
Church, to the cold formalism of the Church of England.
Unfortunately at a very early age, I came unexpectedly
upon the mockery of the principle of celibacy amongst the
clergy. I knew of more than one unhappy boy who had been

drawn into illicit relationships by his own pastor. It was
unfortunate for me that these experiences came my way at an
age where I was seeking from the church, that peace which
was denied me at home. I now only went to church to
satisfy my aunt, and keep up an appearance of devotion for
her sake. At thirteen, an age when most children are only
beginning to think seriously about the meaning of religion,
I was already finished with what had become for me, the
empty forms of both the Protestant and Catholic churches.
As with most Irish children, I grew up in an atmosphere
in which politics were alive and really important. The history
of Ireland became a living thing, which did not begin and
end with the text-book. Sunday mornings, after mass was
over, political meetings were held in the National School. The
country people from far and near attended. Their very
obvious interest and sincerity had always attracted me, but
I had never been allowed to go to these meetings when I was
younger. Now that I was at home again and more mature,
I made up my mind to investigate the local political scene for
myself. I would start out to go to church on Sunday morn
ings, to appease my aunt, but instead of entering, I would
continue on to the village schoolhouse to attend a political
meeting.
Men of the position and standing of Joe Devlin and John
Redmond sometimes came to lead these meetings; there were
lesser speakers also, whose sincerity and enthusiasm marked
them for future honours; amongst these was Jim Larkin.
Their oratory was superb. I was deeply stirred by such use
of language, as I had never heard before. Whilst I found
myself moved by the music of their words, I became aware,
for the first time, of the vibrations that words make in space.
The intensity of feeling released through the sounds of the
voice projected a moving energy into space, which became
visible to me in the form of undulating lines. As I looked at
these rhythmic currents, produced by sound, I began to
wonder whether the beginnings of music had not risen for
early man, through his perception of these charged lines in

space. I became lost in the magic of my own contemplation
and I do not know whether the music of the speaker's voice,
or the emanating lines from his speech fascinated me most.
I recognized that the speaker's words, with their deep sincerity
born of his emotion, constituted in the truest sense of the
word, a deep prayer for Ireland's freedom. I knew that the
quality of these words would draw from the Living Breath, a
true response, just as I knew that my own prayers would
always be answered from that same Source.
Whilst I loved the sincerity and earnestness of these Home
Rule Leaders, I sensed limitations in the attitude of some of
them. The violent tactics of a Jim Larkin, driving the
cattle and the horses off the estates of the landowners, some
times causing them to be maimed, upset my ideals of how
Home Rule should be won. Although I accepted such political
methods as temporarily inevitable, it caused me, later, to lose
sympathy with many of the Leaders of the Home Rule move
ment; though I never lost faith in the dream of a free
Ireland.
During this period, I had many altercations with my
aunt over my devotion to the "Rebel Cause," as she called it.
She had been raised as a Conservative, and could only accept
Sovereign Rule as being right and necessary for Ireland. Not
even on the subject of politics, did we have a meeting ground.
I continued to go to the day school which my aunt had
found near us for me; and there I made great efforts to
conform to school routine and I curbed as far as I was able,
my adventurous impulses and my rebellion against authority.
I was successful, and I became a favourite with the teachers.
But this time I remained aloof from my schoolmates. Though
I was always glad to have a word of approval, I no longer
needed companionship because I had become so deeply attuned
to living in a world of my own.
The power to sense and see the surrounds of living things,
and my growing capacity to visualize forms and sounds in
space, kept me absorbed. I no longer needed to speak to
anyone of these things which I knew. Nor was I convinced

of their meaning and reality to me, and I had no hope any
longer, of winning understanding from others.
At fifteen, I had another serious break-down in health
and spent the winter in bed; the latent tuberculosis which
was a family heritage became active. In the. spring, the
doctor said I could make no permanent recovery in the Irish
climate, so he advised my aunt to send me to the drier atmos
phere of the south of England. She found a school to her
liking there where I was to go, after the Easter holidays. In
the meantime I was to visit for a while, a friend of the family
in London.
I was inwardly excited about leaving my aunt and no
thought of what she felt about all this entered my mind; in
fact I never believed she felt anything, so little emotion did
she ever show me. To say farewell to the farm-people never
occurred to me, but for days before I went, I spent hours
taking leave of the trees and the flowers and little brooks
which I loved, and all the hidden places in the woods which
knew me, as well as "The Children." The night before
leaving home, I felt a terrific conviction that I should never
be happy again in the same way, nor ever see these things
again with the same eyes. I wept for all the bushes and
blossoms and birds which I loved, without knowing exactly
why I wept; a cold, vague discomfort possessed me. Had I
felt, at that moment, that my aunt would have listened to
my appeal and allowed me to remain at home, I would have
asked her that boon; but I knew, from long experience, that
this would be a useless request. Still feeling sad at going away
from all the living things I loved, I went to the garden and
there faced quietly the knowledge that the future turmoil of
my life would make this kind of peace impossible again. So,
gravely, I took leave of my childhood and the world of living
force there, which was so intimately bound up with my whole
being.
I bade a formal farewell to my aunt. She exhorted me
to curb my temperament and remember to keep up my reli
gious training. Her son, whom I had but rarely met or seen,

took me to the boat; he told me that I was very like my
mother and promised to send me some old pictures of her. He
spoke a good deal about my father, of his family background
in Spain and of his tragic death. I had always, in the past,
felt glad that I had no parents, when I heard other children
talking of how much they feared them. Now, for the first
time I wished, as he spoke of my mother and father, with
warmth and understanding, that I might have known those
two who were my parents.
When my cousin spoke of my parents, he retold much of
what my aunt had already said, but he gave the story a
sympathy and understanding that she had withheld. He made
me comprehend something of my father's deep sensitivity and
tragic nature, and that he had been torn with grief and
bewilderment at my mother's death. He also told me how
deeply hurt my aunt had been, when my mother decided to
live independently, and how she had grown to positively dislike
and disapprove of her before her death.
My arrival in London thrilled me. Whilst I have never
yet quite understood the English temperament, I gave my
heart at once to that great city. I went to live with a
cousin of my aunt. I went to school for a short while with
her daughter, who was soon to be married. For the first time
I was thrown into adult society, and was pleasantly surprised
to enjoy it, and immensely pleased to find myself treated as
a mature person. These people, to my astonishment, listened
to my views and ideas as though they had importance. They
commented on how much I had lived and experienced, to
know so much of life at sixteen. I had the novel experience
of being constantly in demand with everyone I met. Then I
knew, that all the hardships and misunderstandings at home
had not been in vain; I realized that through these conflicts
I had become an individual and that I could deal more easily
because of them with this large new world that I met in
London. They laughed at the idea of a girl of my maturity
continuing at boarding school; I began to agree with them,
and I asked my new friends how I could avoid it.

Chapter XIX
LIFE IN LONDON
ONE
night, a small dinner party was given by this friend
of the aunt with whom I lived; it was to celebrate the
impending marriage of my cousin. The man who sat next to
me at dinner was a dark, merry, blue-eyed person, whom
everyone seemed to like. In our talk he plied me with ques
tions and was amused to hear of my coming to England to go
to school, and to find out that this was my first dinner party.
Turning to my hostess, he commented, "This child is delicious;
before she goes to school you must let me take her around and
show her London. You know," he said, laughingly, "I'm
fond of educating the young." She replied, "We are all so
busy getting ready for the wedding, it will be a great treat
for her to have you."
So it was settled that he would call for me a day or two
later. He took me to all the places a child should go; the
Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral, Westminster, and all
the museums, until my head whirled. I told him I was stifled
with buildings, and asked where I could see some gardens, so
then he took me to St. James Park and Kew. He found some
time every day, to take me around; when he was too busy to
take time off to explore the city, he would at least take me
out to luncheon. Gradually I began to accept him as part of
my daily life and to feel that this pleasant companionship
would go on forever. I had from the first day, called him by

his Christian name, Clive; now the household I lived in began,
good-naturedly to tease me about the way that I had taken
possession of him. He had become the confidant of my mis
givings, about going to a new boarding school; to my anxiety
he always replied, "Don't worry. When the time comes, we'll
find a way out." This remark, though vague, quieted me
for the moment; I was satisfied, as always, to live in the
"now," and let the events of the next hours take care of
themselves; in this mood I enjoyed every moment with Clive
and put school out of my thoughts.
The wedding of the daughter of the house happened ten
days before I was to leave for school. It made a deep emo
tional impression upon me, because I regarded marriage as
one of the most serious sacraments of the Church. I pre
pared myself for her wedding day by reading the ritual of
the marriage ceremony as laid down in the Book of Common
Prayer; I went to the wedding in an exalted state of mind,
expecting to see some powerful transformation take place in
both the beings of the bride and the groom. I expected this
experience to be so overwhelming that the bride would prob
ably be unable to participate in the reception. My feelings
towards this wedding ceremony were altogether mystical; I
seemed to be participating at some other such ceremony
which had happened to me, long before, that had since been
forgotten. I felt somehow the necessity of some spilling of
blood; perhaps I was unconsciously remembering what I had
seen as a child at the gypsy wedding.
I was disappointed to see the bride appear at the recep
tion in a gay and nonchalant mood; I was still immersed in
the mystery of the marriage ceremony and expected her to
be in the same state and I was shocked to find that after the
service, there had occurred no change whatever in her state
of being; the lofty and impressive meaning of the ceremony
had passed her by; she responded so carelessly to the toasts of
the guests, and consumed so much champagne, that it shocked

Book of Common Prayer, had lost for me, something of its
sacred beauty, due to the irreverent behaviour in my young
eyes of the bride and the groom and their wedding guests.

Chapter XX
MY WEDDING
EXT day Clive came as usual to take me out. I told him
that I had expected the bride to be transformed by the
ceremony and that I was disappointed when she took' it all
so casually as an every-day matter. He laughed at me and
enquired whether I would not like a wedding of my own
some day. "Yes," I responded, but "some day" seemed a
long way off to my sixteen years.
Clive stayed to dinner that evening; the conversation
turned to the wedding of the previous day. Suddenly Clive
turned to the family and said "Eileen said today that she
would marry me." My hostess indignantly turned on him
and said, "Clive, don't be silly. You have been turning the
kid's head. She has been brought up very strictly, and I
am responsible for her while she stays in London. You have
no right to joke with her about such serious matters." I
was hurt by his words and thought that he was teasing me
for having taken the wedding too seriously; but he turned
to me and said, "I'm serious. You are going to marry me,
aren't you?" I remained silent. My hostess asked him, "Are
you out of your mind, Clive, or have you been drinking, to
make such a proposal. She is only a child." I was hurt and
humiliated by the turn of the conversation and left them all
hurriedly to go to my room.

The next day my hostess spoke with me before I went
out to keep a luncheon appointment with Clive; she was
obviously worried by the further conversation which had
taken place after I had gone to bed. She said very kindly,
"Go out to lunch with him, my dear, but don't take him too
seriously. Your aunt would never hear of such a thing as
this marriage, and I would be held responsible."
At lunch, Clive was more in earnest than I had ever
seen him before. He turned to me and said, "Eileen, I am
very serious about this proposal. I do love you and I want
to marry you." I was flattered, and I must confess that in
my young ignorance I saw in this proposal a means of avoid
ing the new boarding school. After lunch the storm broke
when I told my Aunt's cousin, that I had said "Yes" to
Clive's proposal. When she asked me why, and realized that
I saw in it a means of escaping school, she was terribly upset
and sent word, post-haste, to my aunt, who ordered me to
come straight home to Ireland. I showed my aunt's letter to
Clive; he was angry and pointed out to me that if I went home
now, my aunt would make my life more unbearable for me
than ever before.
I must say I was still capable of being frightened by
her disapproval, but her negative attitude roused my fighting
spirit. Now, for the first time, this marriage seemed really
necessary and important to me; with a newly summoned
bravado I was now determined to marry Clive, however much
my friends and family opposed. When later that day I heard
that my aunt had already started her son toward London to
fetch me home, I was more determined than ever to go through
with my marriage.
I moved to the home of one of Clive's friends and he
then applied for a special license so as to marry me as soon
as possible. When my cousin arrived from Ireland, instead
of opposing the wedding as I had expected, he furthered our
plans for two reasons: first of all because he immediately liked
Clive and became fast friends with him; and then he told
him that knowing that I was a strange child, he feared that

Chapter XXI
AFTER MARRIAGE I LIVE DIVIDED WITHIN MYSELF
IWAS married at eleven o'clock in the morning, and at
four we were leaving London for Paris on our wedding
trip. After luncheon, when I was alone for a moment, I
was for the first time able to realize the terrific step I had
taken. I was about to move into a new life with a complete
stranger, who, from now on, as my husband, would have con
trol over me and my life. I wished in that moment of acute
realization that I could rush back to my home in Ireland; I at
least knew the measure of my aunt's severity; but of this
strange man to whom I had so suddenly bound myself, I
knew nothing. Abject fear for the future and what it con
tained swept over me.
My honeymoon was a miserable experience. I found
myself daily rebelling against the thing I had done and I
would have made any sacrifice if I could have found some
way of being relieved of my new relationship.
I was still undeveloped and quite ignorant of what mar
riage meant. I did not really care for my husband until after
the birth of our first child. The house where we settled in
London on our return had been newly built and I could plant
my own garden. In spite of other restrictions it was a great
joy to me to have this house. Since I had been well trained
by my aunt to be an efficient housewife, I was eager to show
my husband how successfully I could cook and sew and take

care of our home. He reminded me that he had supplied
me with competent maids to take care of the house and that
he felt that his wife should be well-dressed and charming and
entertain in style. He expected me to be ready, whenever he
came home, to adjust myself to his wishes and interests. If,
he said, he had wanted a housekeeper, he would have married
one! I was terribly disappointed but I had already learned
that arguing with him was of no avail. I knew then that
he was going to do the thinking for us both and that what
I wanted did not matter to him at all; he told me more than
once during that first year, that I was too young to have a
mind of my own.
During this period, my mother-in-law helped me to
understand the willful and difficult nature of her son; she
taught me the importance of adhering to social customs, and
she gave me a sense of the dignity of my new position as
her son's wife. She often bridged the differences between us by
making him realize that I had too much mind and energy to be
left without any definite activity of my own and she helped
me to realize that her son was not the self-sufficient male that
I had imagined him to be, but a limited human being like
myself with needs which must be considered. Gradually I
began to accept my mother-in-law as a friend; I could tell
her my innermost thoughts, and I was happily surprised that
she cared to listen. She came to see me every day and we
frequently went on expeditions together and soon became close
companions. As our friendship grew, she often entreated me
to speak to my husband as frankly as I did to her. She did
not understand why I could not talk more freely to Clive.
On our return from our wedding trip, my husband had
spoken very seriously to me of the necessity for abandoning
my way of visioning. He told me that other people did not
sense and see such things and that if others heard me speak in
that way they would surely consider me unbalanced. He
insisted that if I continued such ways of perceiving that it
would surely lead to insanity; he reminded me that I had
probably inherited such unhealthy tendencies from my mother

and my father. The coldness of his tone and the emphasis of
his words brought home to me very definitely that the world
of adult normal people did not sense and see as I did.
I took his words literally and believed that I was surely
headed for madness. I accepted what he said when he told
me that the things I saw had no reality for others; I was sorry
if they did not exist for others but I knew that they were
more real than ever for me. Nevertheless his words gave me a
great shock, for until that moment, I never truly believed
what had been told me at home and by my childhood play
mates that other people did not perceive in the same way as I.
A surface part of me now accepted this fact, but the inner
"me" heard a voice, saying, "But this is not true."
From that moment I became aware of living in two
separate worlds. In one I was the gay, superficial and accept
ing wife; in the other, I was the sensitive, observant, truly
active personality, belonging only to myself. Into the second
world no one else ever had a chance to enter, my husband
least of all. As the division between my two states of mind
grew, I chose again to draw in and live with myself alone, as
I had done when a child. This now made it easy for me to
deal with both my husband and my friends; when I lived in
this separated state no one was really able to reach me and
they could no longer cause me either hurt or confusion. If
this were madness then I had no more fear of it, because in
this state alone was I truly peaceful and happy.
I must have been married about four months when I
knew that I was going to have a child. I was intensely happy
at the prospect; I felt that while I had been outside looking
in at life previously, now I was participating actively in its
creation. Giving life was something that I understood; I had
so often sat with the animals and helped their young to be
born. Now I could identify myself with this miracle of
birth. I was going to have a male child, I knew, full of
power and rude with health; and even in that first ecstasy,
my wish was to give birth to my baby quite alone and have
it take place in the open night under the stars. I would have

none of the conventional way of treating my pregnancy; I
was, to myself, a young animal about to bear her young.
This exaltation of carrying my child, opened me again to
the rhythm of living things, a state which I had rarely exper
ienced, since I had been living in London. Now I walked in colour
in which my child was also bathed. I went away from people
and sought the open fields and woods; again I was at home
with the trees and the living earth; again I ceased to be "me"
and became a vessel through which the stream of life rushed
on, torrential and inevitable. My clothes were a hindrance
to the caress of the energies which came to me from the liv
ing day and night; again I was folded in the voice of the
wind and the rain and the sun; I threw off my clothes and
crept into the garden to sleep. I resented the nurse, chosen to
help me through my labours; I was unwilling to have periods
of rest imposed upon me and I became irritable, if anybody
tried to interfere with my mode of living.
My husband had little interest in becoming a father;
this suited me because I already felt that the child belonged
to no one but myself. But our relations had now become
strained. I learned with a shock from his cousin, that a
mistress, who was in his life before he married me, had never
really been out of it. His cousin showed me one of my hus
band's letters in which he wrote of me: "I am tired of her
virginity and ignorance." The unhappiness of this revelation
hurt and crushed me and my first impulse was to run away,
but then, I still accepted the formal teaching of the Church,
to which I had seemed to have so little relation, that "whom
God hath put together, let no man put asunder." Now lone
liness drove me into a deeper identification with the baby I
was carrying.
My son came quickly, a little before he was expected.
I was able, therefore, to bear him alone. I had no fear for him
or myself, although I was wracked with pain. The exhaustion
which came after this effort gave me a reaction from which
I nearly died. Although I was grateful to my husband for
his kindness to me during the months of pregnancy, now I

was very little concerned as to what he did with his life.
I was relieved to be excused from dressing up and entertain
ing tired men and ugly women at his table. I lived for
the child and was bored with the community which made
up our neighbours and associates.
Living away from people with the baby as my only
absorbing interest, the world of nature opened to me again. I
lived in a state of bliss, bordering on exaltation. This fright
ened my husband and I could not make him understand that
I was living again, as I had in childhood, in an intimate con
tact with all living things. My state worried him and he
again begged me not to speak to anyone of my sensings or
inner experiences. Suddenly it came to me that all the depths
of misunderstanding I had lived through with my husband,
as well as earlier with my aunt and teachers, arose from
the fact that this contact with all living forces which flowed
through me was not perceptible to them, or to anyone else
I knew. Maybe, I thought, that difference between me and
other people is the borderline between sanity and madness.
I felt there was absolutely no one to understand or help me;
I was forced back to living in this world of my own true
being, quite alone; but never afraid.

Chapter XXII
MY SONS AND THE GROWING DRAMA OF "VISION"
Y son grew in loveliness. I wanted to take care of him
myself, but I soon realized that I had not recovered my
strength sufficiently to look after him alone. Life slipped
by in the household fairly easily, until my boy was five months
old. Then, one afternoon when I had the child out in his
perambulator, he became fractious and irritable; I stopped a
moment to change his position and lifted him up and shook
him impatiently. As I put him back more comfortably I
heard, to my surprise, a faint sigh over my shoulder, then I
heard my name called distinctly and a voice, cold and admon
ishing, warned me that I must not lose my temper with the
child as he would not be with me much longer.
I turned my head around, in the direction of the voice,
but there was no one to be seen. The voice was not that of
anyone I had known; it was cold and dispassionate. I was
sick and frightened at these words of warning and brooded
over them for days. As my son throve and grew, I began
to suspect that I had been a victim of my own imagination;
but I worried if this boy showed the least sign of not being
The following year my second child was born. I had
none of the same intense feeling about this child, either dur
ing pregnancy or after his birth. He came quietly, a wide-
eyed baby. As soon as I had recovered, I began to have a

sense that he would not be with me long; I was very depressed
without knowing exactly why. The memory of the warn
ing which I had received about my first son's death grew in
intensity. No matter how much I tried to forget it, I was
unable to do so. My concern for both the children and my
own low state of health now worried me so much that I
decided to tell my husband. I felt that I could no longer
bear the weight of my depression alone; I told him of the
warnings which I had received about both children and of
my fear that they might come true.
He tried to be sympathetic, but he assured me that I
was a victim of my own imaginings, due entirely to my
nervous and depressed state. He sent me to a doctor who
gave me a tonic and suggested that I needed some outside
activity which would take my mind off myself and my chil
dren. He also advised a change of climate; I refused to take
his advice, my home and children meant too much to me, and
I was unwilling to leave them. I knew that I was not really
sick nor in need of a change of climate; I was only afraid
that my ever growing depression registered a tragic truth
about the coming loss of my children.
I took the doctor's advice, however, about redirecting
my energies beyond the limits of household and children. I
joined a woman's club and tried to take an active part in
the local charities. It all seemed to me a waste of time and
futile; I would much prefer to read in the quiet of my room
than kill the hours of the day in social make-believe. Also
there was growing within me a deep sense, that before long,
marriage would not fill my life. My increasing sense of my
rightful independence, this growing force, would not permit
me to submit much longer to the authority of a domineering
husband and the restrictions of the life I was living. I had
as yet, no definite sense of how or when my married life
would alter, but I knew quite definitely that beyond myself,
a process of change had already begun to work upon me
from outside, in the Universe. I had learnt that it was not
necessary to act oneself, in order that things might happen.

All one had to do was to voice one's necessity with faith and
conviction, to the Living Breath; that, in its own good time
and measure, would do the rest.
About this time, my husband noticed that I had seem
ingly not recovered from my depression and anxiety about the
children and he took me to see a psychiatrist. All that this
physician had to suggest was a re-adjustment between my
husband and myself in our marriage relations. A few days
after this visit my oldest boy, now two years old, fell sur-
denly ill. For several days the doctors were unable to diag
nose his condition; they hinted at infantile paralysis and
within a few days brain fever had set in. Within a week he
was dead. Menengitis, they decided, was the cause of his
going. Five months later the second boy died of the same
dread disease.
Now I was childless; all my courage and fortitude left
me. For many months I was nervously ill and shaken at the
loss of my two children but I could not grieve for them in
the conventional sense of the word, for I knew by now, that
the drama of dying led to other states of living. Again I
had seen the nebulous personality of my son wind itself up
wards and float away from the form of his body, while I
held him in my arms. It was, to me, as though unseen
fingers were weaving a silken thread. The movement of this
floating substance, curled and floated rhythmically, as in a
dance, until it disappeared beyond my vision. But I felt ill
and resentful, because I did not understand why my children
should be born only to die so soon.
The suffering which followed the death of my sons led
me to search further for the answer to the revelation which
this phenomenon had allowed me again to witness. I wanted
a method by which I could follow the journey of these mov
ing energies beyond the point that my vision could not
embrace, and follow them into whatever state might yet
exist for them, beyond my present understanding. Whilst the
intensity of my desire for reaching this state did not carry
me as far out into space as I desired, I did begin to see

through, into and beyond dense form. I became aware that
the processes of growth in organic life happened from without,
as well as from within the living organism. I saw that the
floating surround of all living organisms, sustained the organ
ism and the life of its own inner physical body, as though it
were a breathing, outer lung. I knew then, for the first
time, that these surrounds were sustained and held in shape,
(as I came to verify later) not by the breathing of oxygen,
but of carbonic acid gas. I saw very clearly in these days
that these surrounds of all living matter consisted mainly of
what science calls carbonic acid gas; if the living organic mat
ter became congested, I observed that the oxygen-breathing
process slowed down and the carbonic acid gas became more
dense. In the case of the human body, I have often watched
the same process taking place during periods of illness.
All this "seeing" activity tired my body, for however
little I took any part in this medley of movement, its force
passed through me and shook my being. I was aware of a
burning sensation as though constant charges of electricity
were passing through me. Again, as in childhood, I now saw
streams of colour and light, blending and interchanging their
forces; a marriage in space, all light containing colour, all
colour containing light. Light and colour no longer appeared
as beams, or rays, but curved and became slowly rotating,
cylindrical shafts, reaching out endlessly into space. I also
began to feel and sense the thoughts of others and saw them
as forms in light, moving towards their destiny, either dis
sipating or impacting, according to the force with which
they had been projected. From these experiences, I knew that
thoughts were things, clothed with a life and power of their
own, once they were born. Thus went on the drama of vision
for many weeks. If I could only find someone to under
stand what I was seeing! I knew that it had some deep sig
nificance if I could only penetrate its meaning. When I
tried to explain these experiences, and struggled to find words
to describe what I saw and sensed, my husband's anxiety for
my sanity forced me to hold my peace. I looked in scientific

and religious books in the hope I might find an explanation of
the things I was experiencing; but no help came to me from
these sources.
Now I became more clearly conscious of what was hap
pening to me, when I had begun to live in two separate states
of mind at one and the same time. I had always known that
I could withdraw from my physical body; I had learned that
method of avoiding suffering long before, as a little girl;
now for the first time I was able to see the process taking
place, as it occurred in myself. I was sitting one day in a
chair, in a quite relaxed and passive state, wondering whether
I should get up, when looking ahead of me, I saw a shadowy
replica of myself. Never had I had such a shock; I could
scarcely believe that I was such a commonplace creature, as
I now saw myself to be. I got up and tried to approach my
other self; as I did so it lost its outline and began to draw
back towards me, and fall into its protective place as my
own surround. I came to realize later that such projections as
these were only extensions of my own surround and I also
came to know that these projections only take place when the
conscious mind is completely relaxed. In time I saw and
began to understand that, with everyone in states of sleep
or alcoholic intoxication or under the influence of certain
drugs, this surround separates and moves outward and beyond
the physical body.
Studying the nature of these surrounds and their work
ings in later years, I became convinced that they had a pos
itive and important function, as a protection to what we
call the physical body. I became aware that enveloping and
extending beyond the living organism, our surrounds receive
and condense all impacts of sound, light and movement,
diminishing their violence before they permeate our physical
bodies. Seeing and sensing this, I realized that another func
tion of our surrounds was that of an all-discerning eye, which
penetrated beyond man's ordinary vision.
Since this process of separation of mind with its varying
changes had been natural to me from childhood, it did not

cause me fear when it took place. I learned to use this
division of consciousness in a practical way. I found that
this surround became an actual mirror for my own use, in
which I could see myself clearly at any time; whenever I
wished . to assure myself that my personal appearance was in
order I need never glance at a looking glass; I could use my
lipstick or powder my nose in the reflection of my own
surround. Some years later, I came to know that this surround
had much more important functions than the ones I had
then discovered.
The intense experiences consequent on pushing out into
space, to explore the meaning of death, left me spent and
mentally tired. It was increasingly difficult now to face the
routine of domestic life; more than ever, my marriage had
lost interest for me and I wanted to get away from my
present environment and its painful associations. The only
place I could think of to go and find peace, was my old
home in Ireland. I knew that the woods and well-remem
bered haunts of childhood would heal me. I only hesitated
because my aunt would be sure to be critical and difficult
with me again; but so deep was my need to return to Ireland,
that I did not allow this doubt to hinder my going. My
aunt's cold greeting as she opened the door, chilled me again,
as it had in my childhood. She looked frailer now, but her
grim determination to rule and to be obeyed seemed even
stronger than before. She disapproved of my coming back
and leaving my husband behind; she intimated that my place
was* beside him in my own household. But this unfriendly
attitude did not prevent me from enjoying my garden and
the farm. I had my own little room back again and it gave
me comfort and a welcome. There had been changes in the
personnel of the place; a new housekeeper and gardener had
come and this made it feel less like my old home. I had
come back, hoping to find my former peace in the scenes
of my childhood, but I began to realize that this visit to
Ireland was but an attempt to escape from the problems of
my married life, and it would not be the means of solving

them. Now I felt there was nothing to be gained by remain
ing any longer, so I went on to Dublin, before returning to
my husband, in London.
Whilst I had been at school in Dublin, I had become
interested in the Abbey Theatre. Now looking for an expres
sion of life for myself beyond my career as a wife, I
thought seriously of the theatre as a profession. I sought
out some of the Abbey players and others connected with
the theatre, to get some advice. I had always regarded
actors and people of the theatre with wonder and awe, as
individuals who were greatly gifted and set apart from oth
ers. My first intimate contact with the theatre now dis
illusioned me; actors, I found, were inclined to be vain and
interested only in themselves. Also when I came to realize
the amount of routine and training demanded in the the
atre, the prospect of acting became less attractive to me. I
felt that in acting, as in other things one did in life, one
either must do it well or not at all. This attitude all through
my life has made it impossible for me to undergo the routine
of training or teaching from anyone else. I know immediately
whether I can or cannot do a thing myself; if I can do it I
know that I can do it well and quickly; if not, I leave it
alone. There have been no half-way measures possible for
me at any time.
Leaving Dublin, I went back home, to London. But my
visit had helped clarify my vision; I was now ready to face
the issue, and to find some way to terminate the marriage;
I really wanted to find some work which would be an expres
sion of my own self and give some reason and meaning to
living. I went to my mother-in-law to express my need of
some outlet in work, but she, far from being sympathetic,
told me that my first duty was to my husband and my home,
and that my job at that moment was to have another child.
She pointed out that the loss of our sons had been as acute
for my husband as for me; I had, until that moment, selfishly
thought of the children as completely mine; that he too had
suffered, had never before occurred to me. Her argument

convinced me that I should again take up our life together.
In time I bore another son. This baby died a few hours
after birth. My recovery was rapid, so swift in fact that I
could scarcely realize that I had just been through another
tragedy. I had borne this child as a duty, to please my hus
band, but I had never regarded it as mine, nor had I any
great emotion over either its birth or its subsequent death.
After this I made another effort to interest myself in
some activity outside my home, but still remained a part of
it. I enrolled in a school for Domestic Science, and again tried
to be active in the life of the community by taking a part
in charity sales and bazaars. But all this show of activity
was superficial and forced, and gave me no real satisfaction.
I tried another aspect of the theatre; this time it was
musical comedy. I got myself a position quite easily and
would have liked to continue long enough to accomplish
something but my husband and his family were displeased and
insisted on my coming home again. This was the second
time I had taken a paid position away from my home and
my husband, and on both occasions he had been upset at my
independence and insisted that he was quite able to take care
of me. He spoke sharply of my obligations to him and
pointed out that there were many delightful ways for a wife
to "kill her time," while still remaining attractive and respon
sive to her husband. Although I did return on both
occasions, after proving to myself that I could be economically
independent, I did so most reluctantly; these were only my
first attempts to free myself from the economic bondage
which a house and husband now represented to me.
Home again, as soon as outside activities had ceased to
use my energies, the inner world opened again without any
effort on my part. I was a victim of my own hypersensitivity.
As I look back now on this period, it is difficult for me to
formulate, even to myself, what the nature of the sensations
of these weeks really were. I hesitate even to speak of the
states I was then in, for I suspect that most people would
link them with a condition of unbalance. Nevertheless, they

did contain preliminary signs of supernormal sensing, deeper
and more intense than any that I have since experienced,
except in times of serious illness.
Incredible as it may seen, I found myself, now, seeing
more easily and clearly with my finger tips or through the
nape of my neck, than through my eyes; and hearing come to
me through my feet and my knees. In that state, I felt
sound as an external current, entering my body from without
and vibrating through its bony structure. From that time
on, I became aware of auditory sensations that reached me
from outside, but not through the hearing of the ears; this
type of hearing later became more developed and coherent,
and remains with me yet, as what is now called clairaudient
perception just as the seeing which takes place, without the
use of the eyes, is generally termed clairvoyant perception.
When I lay down to rest, exhausted from these experi
ences, I would suddenly get a feeling of nausea and lightness,
and above me, I would see myself, as clearly as though I
were looking at someone else. Although I am not sure what
process was taking place at that moment, I believe that this
must have been the beginning of those more conscious and
controlled efforts at projection, which I was able, later, to
use in controlled telepathic experiments. Until my husband
later told me, I did not know that I had also short spells of
amnesia at this time, in which I talked aloud.
I was thoroughly frightened by all these experiences, and
asked my husband to take me to consult a good psychiatrist.
I dreaded lest this was indeed that madness, now closing in on
me, which my husband had so often warned me about. When
we got to the psychiatrist's office I was prepared to tell him of
these experiences, which had now begun to overwhelm me.
I had hoped for help to deal with them, and sought an explan
ation of their cause; but he gave me no chance to speak for
myself and simply turned to my husband for a detailed account
of my family history. I came in to consult him, convinced
that I must be on the brink of madness; I came away not
only convinced that I was on the verge of insanity, but

that I had been the cause of the death of my children,
through an inheritance of disease. The only concrete sug
gestion that the psychiatrist had made was that my husband's
sexual inadequacy was probably the cause of my hallucina
tions; my husband, a passionate man, was furious. I was
much closer to a nervous collapse, when I left, than when I
entered the psychiatrist's office.
The sum total of this diagnosis led eventually, to the
break-up of our marriage. Although this did not come imme
diately. Outraged and sick at heart at what I had just been
told, I went immediately to have the necessary blood tests
made, and soon received the proof that the psychiatrist's pro
nouncements about my own state of health were quite untrue.
Convinced that I could get no help or understanding from
the medical profession of that day, I began to wish that I
could study the foundations of medicine, chemistry and
physics for myself; I was certain that the key to my condi
tion could be found in the knowledge contained in such
studies. My husband, of course, opposed this effort of mine,
as he had blocked all my other attempts to become independ
ent, and my own means did not permit me to plunge into
such years of study as I might have done then.

Chapter XXIII
MY FIRST ATTEMPTS AT BUSINESS
AND MY AUNT'S ILLNESS AND DEATH
FTER several disappointing interviews with physicians
and psychiatrists, who obviously understood nothing of
my condition of mind, I came to the conclusion that it was
useless to seek any further outside aid or advice. I must
therefore, learn to know myself. I had always been sure that
work which interested me, would be the only antidote to my
nervous and unhappy condition. Soon the opportunity came
to cure myself. One day at luncheon, a friend told me that
she was opening a catering establishment with some capital
left to her at the death of her husband. She asked me . to
join her on this venture and I jumped at this opportunity to
take up some serious work which would absorb my energies
and fill my life. This time I left home without any qualms
and threw myself wholeheartedly into the new project. I was
happy in this new occupation because I had been trained by
my aunt to be a good cook and run a household competently.
I was happy to find that I could work well and easily and
that my partner complimented me on my special ability to
make people buy and eat much more than they intended to
when they came in to our shop! As the business flourished,
my health improved, for the natural tiredness of hard work
gave my mind less chance to separate into its two aspects.

Then news came to me that my aunt was dangerously ill;
I was not asked to go to her but I felt a need to go back to
see her and my home again. When I arrived, her sisters with
dark and gloomy faces chilled me with their frigid greeting.
I asked to see my aunt but they kept me away from her,
telling me that she was no longer conscious and very close
to her end. I however, managed to slip into her room for a
few moments; she lay in her bed in a semiconscious state, and
she turned her eyes toward me and opened them for a
moment. I believe she recognized me for she regarded me with
the hard and unforgiving expression which I had long associ
ated with her. As I left the room I could only think that
she was going out of this life in the same harsh and unfor
giving way as she had always lived. When I came into the
hall I saw my aunt's relatives waiting about, enjoying their
black clothes in anticipation of the funeral ceremony and
mourning which would follow her death. As my relation
with my aunt was ended and I had nothing in common
with the rest of her family, I could see no reason why I
should go through this horrible pretense of grieving with her
relatives, or wait for the completion of the funeral ceremony
after her death. I therefore, announced my immediate depar
ture and although I knew that the family was relieved to
have me go, they did not hesitate to express their disapproval
of my unconventional behaviour, in going away before the
interment of my aunt had taken place.
I did not want to leave without going back to my gar
den for a last farewell to the place where I had known such
happiness. I stood there in the dark and tried to recapture
the atmosphere of my childhood, spent among the trees and
the flowers. I almost hoped that I would hear again my
uncle's voice, speaking to me as in the past; but the dream of
my childhood was over. When my aunt died that phase of
my life was closed forever. Also all the confusion which
she had caused in my life had now dropped away. I knew in
that moment that I was free. From that time on, however
difficult life might become, I was always ready to meet each

new situation before it came upon me, by a certain fore
knowledge of what was in store for me.
The Great War broke out almost as soon as I had
returned to London from that trip to Ireland. My husband
who was a Territorial, was immediately detailed for duty
abroad. In the emotional crisis and upheaval following the
prospect of war and of his departure for the front, I was
very remorseful for my own inadequacy in our marriage; I
willingly therefore, promised to give up my own work and
attend to his household in his absence. I looked after his
house, but my other work had now become increasingly
important to my own life and I was unable to relinquish it.
In a few months, after his departure, I found myself
again pregnant; I had no feeling this time, that the child
would be a boy. A girl was born, as I expected and for
several months after her birth I was dangerously ill. From
that time on my lungs were never strong again. No year has
since passed without many interruptions from illness.
When my daughter was three months old and I was
beginning to feel a little stronger, my husband returned to
England from the front, to transfer into the Flying Corps;
that meant he would be in England for several weeks. I
looked forward to his homecoming; the war and the sacrifices
demanded from the men, made me, as a woman, feel that
I had a great deal to make up to him now for the unsatis
factory nature of our marriage. I was full of good resolu
tions to remould myself into a satisfactory wife. On his
return he was tender enough to me, but not in the least
interested in our baby girl; he seemed worried and preoccupied,
and was glad to be away from me whenever possible.
One day my mother-in-law came to see me in a very
nervous and uphappy state; she told me that she had had a
quarrel with Clive over his recent behaviour. She felt it was
time that I knew that he had been on intimate terms with
another woman since his return from the front. She was
upset over it all and begged me to pull myself together and
get well as quickly as possible so that he would have no excuse

for neglecting me. My first reaction was to" 'be* sorry" *for'fiuve, -
because his mother had found out about his relationship with
another woman; I only wished that he had had the courage
to tell me about it himself, for I would have been glad for
his happiness if he had found someone for whom he could
really care. Although my pride was hurt for the moment,
that feeling did not last. Again, I heard a voice telling me,
"You knew that this marriage would not last."
My husband's family took his infidelity more to heart
than I did; I knew now that my marriage was really ended
for me after all the futile attempts to free myself from it.
My mind leaped ahead to a future devoted to the upbringing
of my child and the making of a career of my own. A part
of me had always known that I must some day create a place
for myself in the world. As soon as this final freeing came,
I wanted to be up and away long before my strength had
returned.
The swiftness of my decision to end my marriage shocked
both my mother-in-law and my husband. He could not see
why his temporary unfaithfulness, while I was still ill, could
be a sufficient reason for the break-up of our marriage. I
told him that I took my share of responsibility for the failure
of our marriage but that it was not in my power to fulfill
his needs, in the terms he required; and he was annoyed at
this indifference to him, and my lack of concern over his
latest infidelity. I was in no mood to listen to him when he
insisted that he still wanted me as a wife.

Chapter XXIV
MY CAREER DEVELOPS
AND I AGAIN EXPERIENCE "PREVISION'
'HE success I had whilst assisting as a partner in my
J- friend's restaurant, made me decide that I could start
one of my own. In the two years that I ran my own place,
it grew rapidly, with the patronage of the wounded soldiers
from the nearby hospitals. I was much too busy to spoil my
child, and had only time enough to give her proper physical
care and attention; this was evidently good for her, since she
gave me no trouble and grew up as a healthy and contented
child. To myself, however, I still _
remained a problem; I
had accepted the judgment of my husband and mother-in-
law, who really believed that I was on the verge of insanity.
They both stressed this point when I was determined to break
up my marriage in order to have my freedom; both of them
also suspected that behind my desire to be free, lurked a lover
whom I now wanted to marry; they came to see me in my
place of work on many pretexts, and in the end, my mother-
in-law asked me if another man were not my real reason for
wanting a divorce. They could not believe that freedom for
its own sake was the whole aim of my life. That I threw
myself with such intensity into work when I could still have
been protected and cared for by my husband, seemed to them
both further proof that I really was unbalanced; they could

not realize that I had found out for myself that hard work
was the only thing which used up my tremendous energy and
so for the time being, preserved my sanity.
I lived now, believing that my increased capacity to see,
out and beyond physical sight, and hear beyond physical hear
ing, were surely signs of a disordered mind. I wondered from
day to day, how long this condition would continue, or
whether it would eventually lead to a more violent state. As
a child in Ireland, I had seen several unbalanced people; I
knew that it could be mild and harmless or that it might
become suddenly violent and dangerous. I had, because of
my childhood observations, a more detached and objective
attitude toward madness. 'Without this preparation, I might
indeed, have been in danger, through my very fear of an
impending break-down. I did nevertheless, consider that I
must be the victim of some mild form of unbalance, which
might at any moment become more than I could deal with.
In order to assure myself that I was not undergoing any subtle
change for the worse, I would try to study the reactions of
my friends to my behaviour and ask them from time to time,
whether they found that my responses were very different
from those of other people. They usually laughed at me, for
imagining such absurdities, and so dispelled my fears. I grew,
therefore, to accept myself and my state of extreme sensitivity
as natural to me and I gradually learned to live with my
apparent "madness."
My restaurant became so successful that if I were to con
tinue it would need larger quarters. When it reached that
stage I decided that I had had enough of that special type of
activity. Everyone was then engaged in some form of war
work, and I felt impelled to do something of that kind. My
new plans at this point, were held up by a severe attack of
rheumatic fever which the doctor attributed to over-work.
When I had recovered, I leased some large premises in central
London, where I set up a resting home for wounded officers.
It combined the atmosphere of home and club; my hostel was
started on the proceeds of my restaurant and some borrowed

capital. Many people discouraged me from launching it,
declaring there was neither room nor need for such a place;
this opposition only made me more determined to make the
hostel a success.
To devise a scheme is, with me, to find myself already
half-way towards its completion. My growing love of organ
ised effort, and my then practical commercial sense, helped
me to carry out my plans successfully. By running my place
in a business-like way, I shocked many people who were at
that time, swept by the sentimentality of war hysteria. I
had no such emotions about war; I hated it and all its con
sequences. As a child, when my uncle read the Boer War
news aloud, and sometimes told me stories of the horrors of
the massacres in India, I could never understand the useless
folly and needless cruelty of man; why should man desire to
kill man. In dealing with the war results, I found a middle
ground for myself, in establishing this officers' rest home where
I could do something to help shattered individuals recover
health and strength in order to take up life again.
Beginning with one house, my hostel grew until I could
accommodate as many as fifty officers at a time; this made me
very happy because it had grown up so spontaneously.
Although the personal supervision of the place took a great
deal of my time and energy, it still did not absorb all my
forces, and in my alone times I found that my seeing and
sensing were now opening into other types of perceptions. I
began to see fragments of incidents and episodes connected with
people whom I knew, flashing before me like blurred pictures
on a dark screen. This new and unsought intrusion of vision
disturbed me a great deal; especially when I began to see
events taking place in the lives of my friends, before they
had actually occurred to them. I saw images of people and
events of whom I knew nothing; perhaps a few days or even
months later, I would meet some of these same men or women
whom I had seen previously in this way. Sometimes, a picture

of a fire or an explosion would flash before me and next day
I might read a description in the newspaper of just that
occurrence, which I had witnessed in a vision.
The opening of these new sensibilities disturbed my nerv
ous and physical organism; waves of nausea often accom
panied such visions and sometimes left me exhausted and ill
as though I had spent my strength in living through the
experience I had just seen. I began to observe also, that when
such sensibilities were active, I felt an intense drawing upon
the sex centres; this increased my anxiety and puzzlement as
to the meaning and purpose of these further extensions of
sensitivity. As a result of this increasing perception which
at that moment seemed so useless and meaningless and utterly
exhausting to my health, I felt more alone and bewildered
than ever. I knew from my previous unpleasant experiences
with medical men that their advice would be useless; so trying
to re-establish a balance toward "normalcy" I threw myself
into a whirl of social festivities and a round of gaiety in
order to shut out the invasion of these unwanted perceptions.
After a few months of this kind of living, I came to the
conclusion that it was less of a drain on my strength to live
with my own perceptions, than with people; so I gradually
accepted these perceptions as an inevitable part of me and no
longer tried to evade them.
Among the officers in the hostel there was one to whom I
was particularly drawn and with whom I spent a good deal
of time. He was sensitive, artistic in his tastes and beautiful
to look at. He had not as yet, been to the front, but had
contracted a fever which had invalided him and prevented his
going. I noticed, when the men spoke of their war experi
ences, that he shuddered and would say, "I wish you fellows
wouldn't be so bloodthirsty." I felt sorry for him and when
he confessed to me one day, that he dreaded going to war, I
was full of pity for him. He was afraid I might tell the
others how he felt; he had joined, as had so many others,
because there was nothing else that he could do. As the
days went by he turned toward me more and more for com

panionship and sympathy; he said I gave him strength and
courage to face the day when he would be called upon to
go to the front. I was fond of him and responded to all
his needs of mothering.
One day he came home very upset and told me that his
regiment would be leaving in a week's time for the front. "I
can't," he said, "face the going away from you, nor the
horror of war, unless you marry me." I was fond of him,
but not in love with him; I had such a definite sense that if
he went he would never come back; it seemed, therefore, such
a little thing to do to marry him, and give him this brief hap
piness. I did so, and gave him all the sustenance I could, by
building up a fantasy of the gay and happy life which would
be ours on his return from the war. When I saw him off,
he had more courage over the prospect ahead of him, but I
knew that he would never return. When he left, I threw
myself again into the social whirl around me.
About a month later, came a day when I knew that my
husband was going through hours of terrific suffering and
fear. In order to relieve the strain of what I was feeling
about him I gathered some friends together to go out to dine
and dance. At eleven-thirty, as I went out of the crowded
room, the vision of my husband dying, began to open; I
seemed for the moment, to have lost my own identity, and
was caught in the midst of a terrible explosion. I saw this
gentle, golden haired man blown to pieces —I watched the
pieces fall; I swam out on a sea of sound. When I came to
myself, I was sitting in the foyer of the restaurant alone. I
knew that my husband had been killed. I recovered my
strength sufficiently to go back to my party; I was afraid to
tell them what I had just gone through.
Two days later my husband was reported missing. A
week later the official word came from the War Office that
he was listed as dead. No one heard from him again. His
brother officers wrote to me that he had gone out on a wire-
cutting expedition and never returned. Years later, after the
war was over I saw his name amongst the missing on the

Menin Gate at Ypres. I was the only one who knew the
manner of his going.
For the few days which followed this vision experience I
was sick with shock. I was rent apart by the uncertainty as
to whether I was the victim of hallucination or the recipient
of true experience happening at a distance. This second
explanation seemed the most difficult to accept, because I had
as yet, never heard of prevision. My Irish background made
me wonder if this might not be what the country people
called second sight. I did not dare mention the vision to any
body and waited anxiously for the next few days. When the
news arrived that he was among the missing, I could no longer
doubt the truth of my visioning. Fear overwhelmed me when
I realized that I had something unusual in my make-up, which
made it possible for events to register themselves vividly in
some part of my being, whether I wished it or not. Further
more, I began to realize that the event could be happening
either close to me or at a distance, could be occurring in the
present, or could have occurred in the past, or might even be
about to happen in the future.
The unbearable strain of being the unwilling recipient
of such events occurring either within or without our accepted
clock-time standard, shattered for the time my every-day way
of meeting life. In this condition I began to wonder, how I
could prevent this invasion of external happenings from tear
ing my nervous system to pieces. At night, in bed, I began
to do what I had always done in times of stress and emergency
—I appealed to the Breath of the Universe to help me build
up some strength which would assist me in shutting out the
impact of these unwanted experiences; then as I lay in bed, I
used, quite firmly, to address the chambers of my mind as I
had come to know them, asking each in turn, to keep out the
invasion of external impressions from my two selves.
I had come by now, to accept myself as having two
separate selves to deal with. I had, in this dilemma, stumbled
upon the technique of what I later learned, was called auto
suggestion. Gradually I noticed that as I continued this

method of appealing to my two selves, the invasion of things
external diminished. If I relaxed my constant use of this
process, however, impressions from without, would again rush
in. This led me to continue that method of protecting myself
from them each night. It became thereafter a regular nightly
exercise, as inevitable as the brushing of my teeth before I
got into bed. After I had found that this was so successful,
I began to experiment with using it for several other pur
poses; I tried it out for protecting myself from pain and
from illness, and for carrying through difficult adjustments
in human relationships which I would otherwise have been
unable to accomplish. It was only years later that I discovered
that in order to meet my own needs, I had developed a com
plete technique of suggestion. I had shut off so completely
all my participation in external visions that I soon began to
wonder whether I had lost my power to perceive them; but
whenevef I stopped giving orders to my two minds, and
allowed myself to drop back again into a passive and relaxed
state, the outside impressions began again to register them
selves upon me.
After the death of my second husband, everyone was very
kind and sympathetic, but my friends seemed puzzled that I
could now take up again the round of daily living, with such
apparent ease. I could not explain to anyone what was really
taking place within me; after all, I had no words to describe
these experiences, even to myself, and I had become resigned to
bearing them alone. Too often had the term of "madness"
been applied to me in the past, when I sought outside help in
dealing with these unexpected happenings. Now, my growing
ability to control my two minds, made it possible for me to
carry on my business and personal life with what seemed to
my friends, an air of security and confidence. No one was
allowed any longer, to know or share with me the difficulties
or complexities of my being, which arose from this interplay of
my two minds. As a result of this conscious protection of the
activity of my second mind, I was accused of being hard and

indifferent. No one guessed what struggle and conflict pro
duced this outer shell for my own defense and protection.
I began to ask myself very seriously, what was this
double self which separated me from other people? Now that
I had received verification and proof that my visioning was
connected with actual events, I could no longer accept the
implication of madness, which had previously been applied by
my aunt and then by my husband to my visionings and per
ceptions. I knew that my mind was normal for me. I began
dimly to be aware that this functioning of these perceptions
had a meaning beyond what I could yet comprehend. My
problem was now to understand the inter-relation and the work
ing of these two minds, more clearly, so that instead of being
used against my wishes by either of them, I should learn to
use them consciously.
During the next year the process of dealing with myself
became easier. I had an increase of visioning which I could
now control by allowing it to happen when I was ready and
also by being able to shut it out at will. This new mastery
of the two minds, lessened my fatigue and nervousness and led
to the return of my earlier visioning of both light and colour,
which had seemed to be shut out during the opening of these
more elaborate visual events. These events which I now wit
nessed, covered as they developed, a wider variety and range
of subject than ever before. They were seldom connected
with my personal life, but were often episodes related to past
or future happenings in the lives of people I knew. Often
I would hear snatches of conversation which at the time of
registering them, had no meaning for me; but perhaps a few
days later, to my amazement, I might find myself in a room
with several people and listen again to this identical conver
sation which had reached my hearing from "somewhere,"
several days before it actually took place. Sometimes I would
hear the names of people and places mentioned, which at the
time sounded strange, were unknown; months later, these
very names would crop up again, through some unexpected
meeting with new people, who would turn out to have some

definite association with these very names and places which
had been thrust into my consciousness.
During this period, another type of experience occurred
to me. Within a few days of each other, two close friends
wrote to me; one was living three hundred miles away, the
other twenty miles from me at the time. Both enquired if
all were well with me, because they had both been quite dis
turbed by actually becoming aware of my presence in their
houses. This, they both knew must be physically impossible,
but they were both troubled as to what such a vivid impres
sion of me in their own surroundings could possibly mean.
At that time I had no suggestion to offer, as to what they
might have been sensing; but many years later I realized that
I had probably been thinking of both of them whilst in a pas
sive state and that one aspect of my mind had therefore,
moved out and reached them. This must have been what was
taking place, for later, when I learned to use the mechanics
of clairvoyant perception and telepathic communication, I
consciously projected this second mind to the place or person
I wished to reach.
At the time of these visionings of events, I became con
scious of an increasing pressure at the top of the nose, and
between the eyes, and at the same time this pressure led to
the feeling of a channel being gently opened from the centre
between the eyes to the cerebellum. This process was not
painful nor difficult, but if it continued long I became tired
and had to shut it by moving about. As the visioning increased,
I located a spot between the eyes, in the forehead, where the
images began to register. These events, beginning at this
point, appeared to move out, through, and beyond me, focus
sing themselves at a point far distant from me, so that I had
almost to strain visually in order to see their detail. For
want of a better description, I used to think of the process
to myself, as a kind of mental magic lantern, the lens of which
for reflecting pictures, was located on my forehead above the
eyes.

As I struggled to find words to express to myself, the
meaning of what I was going through, I came to feel that
Mind was a greater phenomenon than anyone had yet seemed
to realize. Whilst one tiny ribbon of it guided the mechanics
of conscious thought, there must be vast realms of untapped
and unfathomed sources which touched and linked all aspects
of life with each other. I began then to sense the vastness
of the Universal Scheme in which each individual plays such
a minute part. I began to know that the human being was
not nearly as important in the evolution of the Universe, as
he liked to believe. He was only one channel through which
the Force or Intelligence of the World worked toward its own
Evolution. Man was but an incident in the larger scheme of
things. I worked out a method for myself by which I could
conceive of the Evolution of the Universe. It seemed prob
able to me that individuals had no comprehensive minds of
their own, but had brains which were delicate mechanisms,
which simply permitted them to participate, according to the
degree of their capacity, in this evolution.

Chapter XXV
HOW I HAPPEN TO RE-MARRY—
I EXPLORE THE ENGLISH AND IRISH LABOUR
MOVEMENTS
FINALLY
one of the spells of serious illness made it impos
sible for me to carry on with my officers' hostel any longer.
I had been working two years without rest, and my health
had given way. I developed a quinsy throat, with scarlet
fever and then rheumatic fever in quick succession. Since
I had no partner in the business, I decided to give it up and
take time for rest and recuperation. After a few months I
came back to London able to face things again, but without
my previous exuberant energy. I had then no active work in
hand; such moments are always dangerous for me; they leave
me open and liable to be drawn into the needs of those
around me. This time I heard that one of my old friends
was lying wounded in a hospital, not far from town. I was
told that he was in a very bad state and that a visit from
me would surely cheer him up. I went to see him and found
him most depressed; his fiancee had broken her engagement to
him and he had just heard from the doctors that the amputa
tion of one leg was necessary.
I went to see him a number of times, doing all I could to
cheer him up; I knew not only that it would be possible for

me to help him get well, but that the amputation of the leg
was unnecessary. He came to depend on my presence and
help and he began to feel that he needed me. He soon asked
me to marry him. I was fond of him but never thought for
a moment that I was in love. I had grown accustomed as
had so many at that time to feeling that the long war years
made everything one did, of but a temporary measure. I did
not enter into this marriage with any thought of its being
permanent.
Within a month the Armistice was declared. My husband
expected me to settle down to a quiet, well-ordered life with
him. He was very surprised when I refused to accept as
final the comfortable way of living which he could offer me,
for I had again the strong urge to get back into business.
I knew that when the soldiers returned there would be
many pressing social changes to be dealt with and that the
Labour Party would surely come into prominence in that con
nection. I had already been for some time, a member of the
Fabian Society, and my sympathies had long been with the
cause of Labour. I wanted to get an active contact with
the workers and their leaders; I therefore, took over a Labour
hostel which had already been started. Here I felt that I
could observe and know all types, that made up the Labour
movement. Through this I felt I could get an understanding
of the fundamentals of organized labour and also earn my
living by working with an active and interesting group of
people. I saw a great number of fine, intelligent men, devote
every moment of their lives to the cause of the worker, but
when elected to Parliament, their ambition realized, they
would lose all their eloquence and fire. I noted, with a sink
ing heart, how responsibility and new environment changed
independent and courageous Labour leaders into cautious and
conservative politicians. Feeling disappointed with this experi
ence, I recalled the fire and enthusiasm of the Irish Political
Leaders of my childhood, and wondered whether the lack of
fire in the English Labour movement made it seem unreal to
me.

So again I went over to Ireland, only to discover that
there was little of the old imagination then at work in their
leaders. It was at a time when they were bitter, sullen and
resentful toward England. There were then no leaders of
the calibre of Redmond, O'Brien or Dillon, to lift them out
of their despondency. As a good Irishwoman, I could weep
tears over the suffering of Ireland, but I was not in actual
sympathy with the nationalistic policy of that period. I did
feel, however, that the true spirit of the Ireland I knew as a
youngster, was still kept alive by the literary and artistic
groups, born and stimulated by the vivid and living faith of
the beloved AE, Yeats and Lady Gregory.
I returned to London, knowing that I would never
make a good politician. As soon as I came close to the
famous and important leaders in any field, I became aware
of their human limitations and was disappointed at the over-
importance man placed on himself, and the under-importance
he placed on the ideals of the movement, of which he was a
part. I became convinced that I would always set my values
in the reverse order. I never lost my sense that the ideal of
any movement must continue to be far greater than the
individuals who help to sustain or support it. I believe that
at the heart of every man is this belief in some ideal, but the
conditions of every day living, often blur this vision. Men
find it too difficult to remember and make sacrifice for it;
however, there are the few who remember and keep faith.

Chapter XXVI
EDWARD CARPENTER AND HIS EFFECT ON MY LIFE
DURING
the time I was in this post-Armistice Labour
hostel I still continued to have my experiences in vision-
ing and sensing. But I was fortunate now in having found
one person to whom I could speak of these matters. This
was Edward Carpenter, who was then a man of almost sev
enty. I was deeply stirred before I had met him, in reading
his social and political writings. We first became friends on
the basis of our mutual sympathies for Labour and his deep,
spiritual love of his garden and all growing things, drew me
to him; in the early days of our acquaintance he spoke of his
love of trees and that he was careful never to offend the
spirit of growth in nature. I knew then that he too had the
power to understand and merge with the force of living
things. This made it easy for me to speak with him of what
I sensed and saw; he did not misunderstand, but seemed tre
mendously interested, and explained to me that I was born to
what he called a state of Cosmic Consciousness, and that many
people sought in vain to achieve such a condition and failed.
He told me of the lives of those personally known to him who
had achieved this state of "miraculous living," as he called
it. He took me back, step by step, through my early child
hood experiences, and made me describe them to him in the
order in which they opened and came to me. He explained,
very gently, that these were not the ordinary childhood mem

ories and experiences. My very way of describing them to him
made him say that these experiences were not subjective imag
inings, but external and objective impressions that came to me
from without. He proceeded to show me the surprisingly
logical way in which my perceptions had opened, and was full
of regrets that I had not been brought up by someone who
understood that my visionings were Cosmic realizations, and
who might therefore, have encouraged me to follow, instead
of suppress them.
He said that my inability to hear music correctly, or to
even touch an instrument was due to the misunderstanding,
misuse and repression of my Cosmic hearing, when it had
begun to open. He was the only person who understood what
I meant, when I told him that the spectrum was not sufficient
to express the range of the colours that I saw; he assured me
that I had such a sound knowledge of colour, that I might
have expressed it in unusual painting and design. With these
powers of perception he urged me to take up one of the arts;
he felt that in some form of artistic self-expression, I would
find an adequate channel for the application of my vision and
understanding.
Also in order to understand my own nature more clearly
and so that I might trace the steps by which man's lower
nature became spiritualised, he advised me to read certain
books on the psychology and physiology of sex. Only after
I had read them, did I understand how profound was his pur
pose. He then explained that he wanted me to become aware
that all who possessed these special sensitivities, blended in their
natures the qualities of both the masculine and the feminine;
in this way, he led me to understand that the variations in
sexual types, such as the bisexual and homosexual, were not
to be despised. He interpreted them as nature's steps to an
ultimate and higher form of mankind. He had a deeply reli
gious nature, I thought, and regarded Art and Beauty as the
supreme expression of God.
He introduced me to the spiritual and religious move
ments of the day and singled out those leaders who seemed

to be the recipients of Cosmic Law. I heard through him of
many religious movements previously unknown to me and
amongst them was the Theosophical Society. He told me
about the breaking away of the then-active Steiner group;
he told me that Madame Blavatsky and Rudolph Steiner had
both originally started their work on the basis of well-known
spiritual truths. With a mischievous twinkle, he announced
that when religion in such movements had lost its truth and
simplicity, it was made to appear complex, in order to appeal
to the pseudo-elite; with a kind of impish glee, he added,
"The Theosophists tried to catch me, but I have my own God.
And so have you." He advised me to read their publications,
but not to get pulled in to anybody's organization; he stressed
the necessity of not cluttering up my thinking with second
hand experiences, the reports of others, but to continue to re
main true to myself. I went to Theosophical meetings, and
read the literature of that society; I came away convinced
that however satisfactory this might be for some people, it
had no life or meaning for me; it seemed a laboured effort to
superimpose a covering upon traditional religious forms; if
one were looking for form and ritual, I felt that there still
remained the beauty and mysticism of the Roman Catholic
Church. But I was no longer in search of any kind of ritual
for myself, so I turned away from all these movements.
I told Edward Carpenter of my negative reactions to the
Theosophical teachings and to all the others of which he had
spoken. He laughed, and seemed pleased, saying, "Your own
judgment will take care of you. Now that you are growing
up and beginning to think for yourself, I am able to introduce
you to the true source from which these movements draw
their so-called 'inspiration.' First I would have you read
Emerson, and know him well. Then, digest the 'Leaves of
Grass,' written by a well-beloved friend of mine, whose name
is Walt Whitman. Fraser's 'Golden Bough' will give you
something later on, and one day, get to know Spinoza, and
when you know him, disregard the lesser prophets. When you

Scriptures, especially the Upanishads and the Mahabharata, and
then return again to your Bible and read it afresh with new
understanding. After you have read and digested all of these
writings, you will begin to understand the folly of modern
man's attempt to create a new religion."
He told me of his discovery of Walt Whitman and how
thrilled he had been when he first came across his writing.
He had a profound love, amounting almost to worship for
Whitman's vision; nevertheless, he saw the limitations of the
man and his poetry. He told me much of Whitman's life,
of the man's simplicity and inner decency; he regretted that,
as yet, the world appreciated him so little, and that in con
sequence, Whitman had in his loneliness, become arrogant
and self assertive in his own defense. He would always say
laughingly, "Whitman is not respectable yet, but he will be
some day."
In the two years of my close friendship with Edward Car
penter, I might say that I had the most profound spiritual
experience of my life; one which gave me a sense of being
re-born and set free. He had liberated me from the burdens
of my past life; I no longer carried an abiding sense of sin
and secret despair about my childhood or my parents, or the
failure of my first marriage. He truly made me understand
that my sensing and visioning were not the products of an
unbalanced mind, but the positive powers of knowing and
understanding, beyond the range of ordinary comprehension.
For the first time in my life, I realized that my perceptions
of this world of light and colour and movement, were not
the hallucinations of a disordered mind, but the true seeing
and sensing of what Carpenter called Cosmic Consciousness.
Whatever I have said of Edward Carpenter seems inade
quate to express my profound debt to one of the greatest spirits
of the modern world.

Chapter XXVII
HOW MY DAUGHTER RECOVERS FROM A SERIOUS
ILLNESS
MY daughter was laid up with a series of illnesses that fol
lowed each other in close succession. Beginning with mea
sles, she then developed whooping cough and later pneumonia.
Although she had never been a particularly energetic child,
this was her first serious illness. She suffered very much and
I was extremely worried over her condition. One day I
overheard the doctor telling my husband and the nurse that
he could do no more for the child and that the crisis would
probably occur at about two o'clock that morning; but at
whatever time it might happen he was to be called, as I
would probably collapse if the child did not pull through. I
burned with resentment against him and the whole household,
and made up my mind that I would not give up my fight
for my child's chance to live. I sent the nurse away and
decided, within myself, that the child must get better. Then
came one of the strangest and most unexplained circumstances
of my whole life. I had taken the little one out of her bed;
she gasped for breath; I was helpless but could not bear to sit
in agony and watch her fighting alone, for breath. In desper
ation I held her close to me, as though to give her of my
own strength; there seemed nothing else that I could do.
Suddenly I heard a voice saying to me, "Be careful! She

must have more air. Open the windows and allow a new cur
rent of air in the room." I did not dare to look or question
from whence came that command; I just opened the windows.
I remember watching the curtains flutter, and wondering if
there were too much breeze. A moment later I saw the out
line of a figure leaning against the bed, a short, lithe man; his
face was turned away from me. I was too petrified to look
very closely at him. Although my limbs were trembling, I
knew I must approach the bed, and put the child back on it.
As I laid her down, I was aware of this man, in grey gar
ments, standing beside me, with a sympathetic and kindly
smile. His presence reassured me; fear left me and I knew
he had come to help me save the child. I must have been
sitting beside the bed when he left, but I did not see him go.
I do not remember how long I remained in that position. The
next thing I recall was a resounding noise in my ears, which
turned out to be someone knocking at the door. I went to
the door and unlocked it, to find my worried household stand
ing there, fearing the child had died. I returned to my daugh
ter, who was now sleeping quietly in her bed, and I knew, for
certain, that she would recover. In the next day I collapsed
from the strain of those last few days and again I was ill for
many months. At that time the dread asthma, from which
I have suffered ever since, developed. Meanwhile my daughter
grew well and she is now a healthy girl of twenty-two. The
memory of the mysterious stranger who saved my child's life
remains to this day vivid, but unexplained.
After the miracle of the healing of my daughter by the
mysterious visitor, I began to recall the other two objective
visions of my childhood. I remembered the vision of my uncle
coming to me, after his death, and the promise that he made
to me, that I would within two years, leave Ireland to go to
London. This prophecy had come true, although I had almost
forgotten the entire experience until that moment. Then I
recalled my first vision; that of my Aunt Leon holding her tiny
baby; this experience had happened before she had actually
died. I now realised, with astonishment, that without having

overheard in my home that she was to have a child, I under
stood in the vision that the child was the cause of her death.
My third and most recent vision, was that of the stranger
who had actually saved my daughter's life. I could no longer
tell myself that these visions were not true. All three had
been followed by objective evidence which proved their
Tightness.
Edward Carpenter had been reluctant to give me a clue
to these visions, although I felt that he understood the nature
of them. The time had come now, when I felt impelled to
find some explanation of these phenomena.

Chapter XXVIII
MY FIRST EXPERIENCES IN SPIRITUALISM
AND THE BEGINNING OF TRANCE
T this time, among the many people who stayed at my
hostel, was one man who threw some light on the nature
of my visions. When I first spoke with him, I must admit
that I misjudged his true comprehension of this subject. One
day he stopped to speak to me and surprised me by telling
me that he recognised my "latent mediumistic powers," and
then proceeded to explain that he himself, was clairvoyant
and that he could see that I had extraordinary powers, cover
ing the entire range of mediumistic phenomena; and that
these included healing, psychometry, clairvoyance and clair-
audience. I was naturally excited by such a statement and
asked him to explain to me the meaning of some of these
words which I heard, used by him, for the first time in my
life. He then gave me a simple explanation of what the
spiritualist believes, about the capacity of individuals to com
municate after death with the living. In order to illustrate
what he meant, he told me that he was able to speak with
his dead daughter; I was skeptical and asked him to show
me how he did this. I then heard him address his daughter
as though she were in the room; I looked about to discover
her but was unable to see her. I looked at him then with
pity and sympathy, quite sure that the poor man was quite

unbalanced and simply imagining that his daughter were there.
At that moment I was quite unconscious of the fact that I
was treating him in exactly the way that others had dealt with
me, in the past, when I spoke of my own visions.
I might have dismissed the whole episode then as useless
and unimportant, if he had not handed me his watch at that
moment and said, "Tell me what you sense about this." I
took it in my hand and so as not to disappoint him, I began
giving him what seemed to come to me as incidents about his
son's life. He said that what I told him about this son, whom
I had never met, was true, and that this was proof that I had
the power to psychometrize. I was startled, but interested
in the whole procedure, and I questioned him closely about
the nature and use of this psychometric and other powers.
When he elaborated his belief in the relation of the dead
to the living with much emotion, I was disturbed by his
implicit faith. He spoke of his daughter as though all the
thoughts, the aims and tastes which had motivated her when
she was living, were still the foundation of her new existence
in some other locality. Although I knew something of the
changing state of death, I was shocked that death was inter
preted as a change of place, but not of consciousness, for per
sonal and trivial ideas. From the little that I had yet been
able to observe personally, of the change that did occur to
living organisms at the time of death, I was certain that some
definite transformation took place, which led to a new and
vital state of being; just what this condition might be, I could
not say. But after I had watched this intense and dynamic
movement of separation taking place so often in organic and
human life at the moment of death, I knew that any reactions
which might occur in the state beyond death, could not pos
sibly be the same as those which happened on the plane of the
living in this world. And yet some such explanation as this
man gave me of his daughter's changed state seemed the only
possible one which could give any meaning to my own vision
of the dead. I was, therefore, not unwilling to investigate
the problem more deeply, and he suggested that I go with

him to the headquarters of one of the London spiritualist
societies.
He first took me to a meeting in which a clairvoyant
was giving messages to the audience from dead relatives and
friends. I took it very seriously and went in trembling with
anticipation; recalling the experiences of my own visions of
the dead, I expected a profound and terrifying revelation.
The room was very still, the audience waited, and then the
clairvoyant began, "For the lady at the end of the room,
with a big black hat, there is an old man with a grey beard
and blue eyes. Could he be your father?" "Yes," said a
voice in the back row. "Could his name be John? I see a
large 'J'—or it might be James," and the lady in the back
row responded helpfully, "You are right. It is James." "He
says you are worried about conditions that are changing for
the better at the end of the month. Would you recognise
that?" The lady answers, "Yes. It fits exactly." As this
conversation took place, I looked for the apparition of the
father, but could see no sign of him.
The clairvoyant next asked for 'Alice,' in the audience;
two or three women answered to that name; she settled on a
restless looking girl in the front row as the appropriate one
and said, "Your mother is calling for you. She is here." The
girl breathlessly asked for news. "Your mother says she is
happy and wouldn't come back for worlds," offers the clair
voyant, "but, Alice, you must carry on and take care of
father and the household." Alice accepted this gratefully but
I was so sorry for her, and thought how banal and meagre
was her message. So it went on for an hour; communications
from the new abode of the dead and advice about the routine
existence of the living, poured forth from the lips of the
clairvoyant; but I failed to see a single phantom in the room.
It is only fair to say that my few visions of the dead,
up to that time, had come upon me by chance and were never
as yet, produced by means of a conscious knowledge of how
to be clairvoyant; this power only developed for me years
later; after I had been using trance mediumship for some time;

so I was in no position as yet, to pass judgment on the per
formance of this clairvoyant.
As soon as the meeting was over a waitress served tea
to the audience. There was a buzz of conversation and I
overheard one .
grey-haired woman telling another that she
was not coming again because she never got a message and
her friend replied, "Oh, but my message was good. I knew
Eric was there, because he described the fob with his initials
on it that his father gave him before he went to the war."
I heard 'Alice' compliment the clairvoyant for the wonderful
evidence she had given her. I waited to hear no more, but
persuaded my friend to leave the meeting with me. Once
outside I told him how shocked I had been by this performance.
Was it possible, I wondered, that all I had come to understand
about the liberation and cleansing that followed death could
be reduced to such a level of banality.
Nevertheless 1 went back the next day, and took out a
membership in this society. There were two things that I
did not understand and to which I was seeking some solution.
I wanted to find out the way in which the clairvoyant func
tioned and I wanted to discover whether she also saw her
visions of the dead, objectively, as I did. One other matter
I wanted to understand also and this was the nature of psy-
chometry and why or how I had been able to psychometrize
my friend's watch. I began now to go to every kind of meet
ing which this society held; this included lectures and dem
onstrations in clairvoyance and psychometry. I still remained
baffled, because I could find no clue to the way in which
these experiences occurred. The people in the society were
extremely kind; they encouraged me to read a great deal and
told me about their own psychic adventures. They advised
me that if I wanted further enlightenment on the subject, I
should join a group for the development of my own psychic
power. When I asked the secretary for some explanation of
the way in which this power of psychometry worked, I could
get no clarifying answer which satisfied me. She suggested that
since I had obviously some mediumistic power, she would

introduce me to some other members of the society who were
forming their own circle for psychic development, and this
might help me to discover more about my own psychic powers.
I met the new circle, composed of half a dozen women,
who gathered together once a week in a dark room at the
society's headquarters. The meeting opened with the Lord's
Prayer; I was then requested to place the tips of my fingers
on the surface of a table with those of the other women.
Each time that I was present they claimed that the table
moved more rapidly and spelled out more swiftly, tapping out
messages "from the dead" using the accent of the table leg on
the floor.
I was intrigued by these experiments and tried them out
at home with my husband and our friends. We had excellent
results and received some unexpected communications. I recall
one episode in which a cousin of my husband, who was sit
ting with us, asked the alleged communicating intelligence,
to inform him of the exact address of the place where he was
born. He did not know himself at that time, and only verified
the truth of what was told him later. This type of objective
verification impressed me enough to make me continue my
investigations.
The third time that I sat in the circle with the group
of women, something unexpected happened. I found myself
growing drowsy and before I knew it I was sound asleep. When
I came to I was being roused and shaken by the other women
who seemed frightened and upset. I found myself in a some
what nauseated and giddy condition with an effect of lights
playing before my eyes. I heard them say that in my sleep
I had given evidence of their dead ones being present, entities
who spoke to them all. I was thoroughly frightened at what
had occurred and I hurried home to tell my husband; he was
indignant and said, "This is awful. You must not go to that
society any more." For the moment I had a sense of relief
that his decision had put an end to these experiments.
When the secretary of the society heard of what had
taken place at this last session of the developing circle, she was

She said that no one present knew enough of psychic develop
ment to handle what was happening to me. She then advised
me to consult a friend of hers, who had a profound knowledge
of psychic matters. And that was how I happened to meet a
Swiss, whose name was Huhnli.

MY CONTROL "UVANI" FIRST APPEARS
I WENT one day, in trepidation, to see Mr. Huhnli by-
appointment, at his modest rooms in Lambeth; I was relieved
to find him a gentle and simple person. He asked me what had
been happening to me and said that he had received a letter
from the secretary of the spiritualist society telling him some
thing of my problem. I told him of my experience and he
listened sympathetically, suggesting that I sit down quietly in
a chair and relax. I did so and felt myself becoming sleepy
again; he told me not to worry about it, and again I lost
consciousness. When I awakened, he said, "I want to talk to
you of what has been happening while you were asleep. You
are potentially a trance medium of great power." I had not
heard these terms before and asked him to tell me what
trance really was. He explained that it was a condition depend
ent on an extreme passivity of mind and that it could either
be of a light or profound nature. In this deeply entranced
state, the individual lost control over his own consciousness,
in what appeared to be a sleep-like state; but at this time,
some external "spirit" intelligence might enter in and take
control of the organism, and he added, "This is what has
happened in your case. I spoke with the controlling entity
who used your mechanism whilst you were apparently asleep.
He is a man of unusual intelligence, who declares that he is

an Oriental; he wishes to do serious work to prove the validity
of the theory of survival. He gives the name of Uvani."
Mr. Huhnli's words bewildered and frightened me. I
left as quickly as I could, and when I found myself again in
the street, I was sure that none of this experience had really
occurred to me. I jumped into a taxi, rushed home to my hus
band and told him the whole story. He was most annoyed
that I had seen fit to go and visit this stranger, and then in
angry tones he assured me that if such things had taken place,
I was not merely on the brink of insanity, but had already lost
my reason. I began to think he was right, and for the first
time in my life I knew the meaning of fear. For weeks I
never slept without a light burning in my room, and wondered
all the time if this unknown, Uvani, saw and heard everything
that I did in my daily life. I also wondered if this Oriental
might not be a figment of my imagination; I could hardly
believe that I had "made him up," as I had no particular
interest in Orientals. I endured this state of conflict as long
as I could alone, then in desperation, I went back to see Mr.
Huhnli again.
When I returned to Mr. Huhnli, I explained to him that
what troubled me, was the possibility that if this personality,
the control, Uvani, really existed in such close relation to me,
that he could certainly spy on my most intimate and private
behaviour. He assured me that the control personality would
not be interested in such matters, and had succeeded in reach
ing me for some profound purpose. I was somewhat relieved
when Mr. Huhnli said, "Your control may not approach you
unless you prepare the way for him by going into an entranced
state." I replied, "I must have it in my power, then, to
avoid trance, and so dispense with him."
He doubted whether this was possible and he feared that
if I did so, I might harm my health; for the control person
ality, he explained, had already established himself through me
and had made his purpose clear, having stated that he came
to try to prove the truth of survival after death. I doubted
the whole thing, but the sincerity and honesty of Mr. Huhnli

made me trust him, and believe what he said about these
mysterious areas of my being, which I did not understand,
and over which I had no control.
Mr. Huhnli then suggested that he could help me to deal
with both myself and the control, if I would continue to allow
him to speak with this Uvani whilst I was in a trance; and
that he could thus help to direct and train him. I followed
Mr. Huhnli's suggestions as far as I could and gradually came
to accept his point of view, that I had the makings of a
mental medium.
In order to continue my work with Mr. Huhnli, I had
to go against the wishes of my husband, who was already hurt
that I had ignored his advice against playing with my psychic
powers. This development of trance, convinced him that I
was now in a dangerous and unbalanced condition and should
be examined immediately by a psychiatrist. This time I refused
to go; he and his friends were so disturbed by my state, that
they spoke of having me placed under observation. I had been
wanting to give up my hostel for some time, and this marital
disagreement coming close upon the illness of my child, and
my increasing ill-health, made me decide to dispose of it at
this time.
Having closed the hostel, and sent my daughter away to
school, I was free to be alone again; for my husband had gone
abroad. The continued strain of all that had taken place
laid me low again. A serious hemorrhage kept me in bed for
some weeks and I had ample time to reconsider all that had
been happening to me since I had first entered the spiritualist
society, and had begun to develop trance mediumship, with the
help of Mr. Huhnli. In reviewing the activity of the past few
months, I could scarcely believe that all these strange occur
rences had taken place. It all seemed unreal and fantastic,
and I was appalled to think that I had allowed myself to be
drawn into behaving in such an hysterical manner. I began
to realize that the validity of the existence of the control
depended on the word of a single individual, Mr. Huhnli, and
that perhaps he could have been mistaken in his interpretation

of my condition; then too, I refused to accept the idea that
any other intelligence than my own, should work through my
physical make-up. By the time that I had recovered my
health I had fully determined to close off my trance powers
forever, and I rejected the idea that a control personality could
have any genuine existence. For several months I maintained
this attitude and I kept clear of all spiritualist meetings.
Out of my illness and enforced rest came one very deep
and important discovery about myself. I had time to review
my entire life and link up certain experiences which had so
far remained unexplained. I saw for the first time, that the
trance state might be part of a psychological pattern which
had its inception in my early childhood. I began to under
stand how the pain and suffering of these early days had made
me withdraw from the world of people into the world of light
and colour and movement. I could now recall that the first
time I had been successful in escaping the pain of the punish
ment inflicted on me by my aunt, was when I so separated
myself that I could see her lips moving as she scolded me,
but not a word penetrated my ears. I now remembered also,
that when the physical punishment became almost unbearable,
rather than cry out, I learned to draw inside myself and would
fall promptly to sleep, thereby banishing the painful after
effects of a beating. I carried this process to such a fine point
of development, that I would later experiment at school by
drawing physical punishment upon myself from the teacher,
so as to discover how completely I had learned to escape the
consequences of pain.
I also recalled the many episodes of amnesia which had
taken place during the early and unsatisfactory years of my
first marriage, and during the tragic episodes of my sons'
deaths. I understood now more clearly, that these periods of
so-called amnesia were also forms of escape from the too-
painful conditions of living. This new perspective on the
technique of escape which I had developed and continued to
use all my life, for avoiding both pain and suffering, may
well have prepared the way for the later development of this
trance state, which was now upon me.

Chapter XXX
HEWAT McKENZIE AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF MY MENTAL MEDIUMSHIP
IHAD made up my mind to forget the experiences which I
had gone through with the spiritualist society and go to
some other surroundings, perhaps Australia, in search of a
release from old patterns, and also of a practical way to earn
my living. But a stronger destiny was at work. On my
way to the ticket office for an actual departure to Australia,
I met a friend who offered me a very good position in Lon
don. At that moment, I happened to be in Southampton
Row, only a few steps away from the headquarters of the
spiritualist society; I had an impulse to call on the secretary
and this call changed the course of my life. She seemed most
pleased to see me, and expressed her regret that I had given
up working with Mr. Huhnli; but she strongly stressed the
importance of my continuing with my pyschic development.
In fact, she said that recently, while sitting with the trance
medium, Mrs. Osborne Leonard, she had been told by the
control, Veda, that she would meet me and be instrumental in
helping me to continue my trance work. At first I resisted
the idea, but her genuine sincerity and interest made me
promise to meet a friend of hers who knew a great deal about
the subject.

In this way I met Mrs. Kelway Bamber. She told me
that she had been informed by the control of Mrs. Osborne
Leonard that she would meet me and aid me in my develop
ment. She was a capable woman, with a strong personality
and had lived in India for many years. She was herself very
mediumistic and had received a series of letters psychically,
from her dead son, Claude. These had been published. I Was
impressed by Mrs. Kelway Bamber; although she was mediumis
tic, she was a woman of fine and keen intelligence. She was
sympathetic in helping me in the development of my trance;
and when she heard that my control personality was an Orien
tal, she felt that she could help to develop the capacities of
this Eastern control because she herself had a deep understand
ing and sympathy with the East and its philosophy. Through
her I soon met most of the leaders of the spiritualistic move
ment in London, and she arranged that I have experimental
sittings with all of them.
I went into trance and apparently the control, Uvani
"came through" and spoke with them. From all reports,
these early attempts contained satisfactory proof that he
would be able to deal with the giving of evidence concerning
"survival after death." This I soon realised, was the only
subject that interested the spiritualists. Among the prominent
ones I met at this time, was Mrs. Hewat McKenzie, who with
her husband, had founded and organized the British College
of Psychic Science. I was immediately impressed by her intel
ligence and honesty and also by her cautious approach to
spiritualism, even though she believed profoundly in its truth.
I was pleased, therefore, when she suggested that she would
like me to meet her husband, who was reputed to be a great
authority on psychic phenomena. Consequently, a few days
later, I met Hewat McKenzie.
He had a most remarkable personality and his humourous
outlook and generous welcome, made me want to know him
better. I dined with him and realised that he had a greater
knowledge and understanding of psychic phenomena, than
anyone I had yet met. I was glad therefore, to give him an

experimental sitting, so that he might judge of the nature
and quality of my control personality, Uvani. After this sit
ting, he told me that I had potentialities as a trance medium,
provided that my powers were properly trained. He said that
I had given him in this first experiment, little evidence of "sur
vival," but that this was no proof that I could not later
produce it. He also stated that I had great psychic power and
that at this point I needed no training in order to use it. But
he stressed that in trance-mediumship, the most important
thing was the adequate training and development of the
control. He was the first and only person in the entire period
of my psychic development who seemed to realise that the
quality and spiritual level of communications expressed in the
trance state, were dependent on the degree of mental and spir
itual development of the control.
Hewat McKenzie was the only one of the leaders of the
spiritualist movement who refused to take any pronouncement
of a control personality as inevitably the word of some "Higher
Power." He explained to me, that in his estimation, the pos
sibilities of trance mediumship had been wasted and allowed to
deteriorate, so that they now, mainly functioned on emotional
and sentimental levels. This was due to the fact that when
the controls first appeared after a potential medium became
entranced, no one regarded them as limited personalities who
might themselves need help and training, in order to under
stand the highest use of their own position and functioning.
He explained to me that a control personality is only an inter
preter of what reaches him from other states of consciousness,
and therefore, he (the control personality) had to be taught
how to make the purest use of his powers and to transmit
only from the highest levels of truth.
This attitude of Hewat McKenzie impressed me greatly
and threw a new light on the possibilities of mediumship. I
felt that with his assistance, I might get a true understanding
of my "psychic powers" and some clarification of my early
objective visions. I had come to value and trust the integrity
of understanding, which both he and his wife possessed. For

the first time I was able to trust the judgment of somebody
else and under the joint direction of Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie,
I decided to become a trance medium at the British College
of Psychic Science.
Hewat McKenzie's lofty conception of mediumship was
something which I had never before met. He considered
that the most profound philosophy of the early teachers and
the inspiration of all great Scriptures, had been received
throughout the ages by the channel of mediumship. He empha
sized the responsibility which possessing this power placed upon
me, and declared that I must therefore, exercise care and
control over my habits of daily living. He emphasized the
necessity of leading a quiet and harmonious life, free from
the excesses of alcohol, sex and elaborate food. My whole
responsibility to myself and my mediumship lay in living
this simple and controlled existence.
He pointed out that under tuition, the control person
ality could be trained to take good care of the other aspects
of my mind. The strength of Hewat McKenzie's training
of my mediumship, lay in his profound understanding of the
nature of the subconscious mind. He regarded the subcon
scious as containing the entire mind of man; its form, he
said, was that of a vacuum which drew everything to it,
and all memories were contained therein whether we were aware
of this fact or not. Contrary to the general view expressed
at that time, he regarded the conscious mind as merely a sur
face and incomplete expression on one level, of what was tak
ing place in the profound subsconscious; to Hewat McKenzie
the nature of man and of his subconscious were one.
Because he believed that the subconscious absorbed every
thing in its environment, whether good or bad, he set up cer
tain rules for the protection of my subconscious self, while
he trained my mediumship. First he explained the danger of
blurring or interfering with my own clear functioning, if I
sat for experiment with other mediums; he said that this was
equally true if I sat with development groups or opened up
any other aspects of mediumship than trance, at this time.

In order to keep my subconscious free from other people's
ideas and influence, he insisted that I avoid all reading on
psychic and occult subjects. He gave special attention to the
methods by which the control must give his evidence, asking
him to bring through types of information that might be as
far removed as possible from the conscious knowledge of the
investigator. He regarded suggestion and hypnosis as valuable
aids in the development of trance mediumship, believing that
both could help to produce a deeper separation between the
two minds, conscious and subconscious, and thereby create a
condition in which the subconscious functioning would be
freed from the influence of external conditions. The control
would then have a clearer channel through which to work. (He
also hoped that by means of suggestion, he could give me relief
from the asthma from which I now suffered continuously.)
Before I met Hewat McKenzie, some aspects of my own
physical mediumship had begun to manifest themselves.
Knocking occurred when I was present and small objects
moved, as though invisible hands touched them. When I
consulted Mr. McKenzie as to how to deal with this matter,
he advised me strongly to discourage it and helped me to
control it by giving suggestion to me in the waking state,
and by asking the control when I was in trance, to absorb
this energy into the trance activity.
I continued working for the next five years under the care
and direction of Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie. I sat once a week
during this period with Mr. McKenzie for the further devel
opment of the control, and the direction of my trance medium-
ship, into other phases, not related to the type of communica
tion which proved "survival." As long as we worked together,
he limited my professional work at the College to not more
than one or two appointments a day. In the years which
followed, I built up a reputation as a trance medium, and
following Mr. McKenzie's advice, I shut out all other aspects
of development and activity. His insistence that I concen
trate on this single form of psychic development, led to an
intensification of the trance power. From the records which

were made at the time, it would seem that my trance utter
ances, dealt with evidence of "survival," precognition and
clairvoyant perceptions in trance.
During the years of the development of this work, whilst
I allowed Mr. McKenzie to train the control personality, I
never fully accepted the reality of the control's existence for
myself. Often, in conflict, I went to Mr. McKenzie and told
him of my doubts about my control, XJvani and of my sus
picion that he might not be a separate personality, but only
a split-off of my own subconscious mind. Both Mr. and
Mrs. McKenzie felt indignant at this suggestion, and told
me that I was in no position to judge of the validity of the
control's existence —which was true. My doubts made me
often refer to the XJvani personality jokingly as the "Old
Bird;" this shocked and hurt Mr. McKenzie who had taken
the whole development of my mediumship very seriously.
As I continued to work at the British College, I began
to observe more closely the reactions of the different types of
people who came to be known as my sitters. For those who
have no knowledge of this subject, a session with a medium is
called a sitting and those who come to work with a medium
are known as sitters. I often asked myself what these people
came for and how they made use of the advice and informa
tion they received.
I was not long left in doubt. There were a few who came
because they were drawn by an earnest desire to communicate
with someone who had died. But at the risk of drawing angry
criticism on my head, I must say that many of the people who
consult mediums use these sittings as an opiate or aphrodisiac
and not as an aid to more responsible living. I base this judg
ment on the typical comments made to me by the majority of
sitters when I came out of trance. Although I usually pro
duced results for them, there were times when a sitter did
not get the evidence he sought; at such moments, when I
awoke from trance, I was indignantly questioned and asked
whether I was ever able to give any satisfactory results.
This shocked me for several reasons. If these people

believed that I was truly in deep trance, and that the control
personality was transmitting knowledge from another level of
consciousness, how then could I be held responsible for either
the quantity or the quality of the evidence which might be
given to them? Furthermore, I wondered why they should, at
any time, accept so eagerly and unquestionably any of the
positive statements which were made to them while I was
entranced and then complain so bitterly about any negative
results. It seemed incomprehensible to me that whatever the
products of trance communication, no one ever raised any
question as to the principle by which the technique of medium-
ship was able to function. I came to the conclusion that
the chief reason people desired to use my trance was for entirely
personal enquiry concerning messages of consolation and
encouragement. How rare amongst the thousands of sitters
who have come to me in the past fifteen years, were those
who ever sought to investigate objectively the nature and
principle of communication and mediumship.
I began to feel the futility of continuing work on this
level. It had none of the basis of fine understanding that
Hewat McKenzie trained me to expect in objective investiga
tion. Even though I had seemed up to that time, to accept
the spiritualists' point of view about controls and communica
tion in my work, a part of me, had nevertheless, never believed
in the reality of my own control, Uvani, nor that these com
munications which he transmitted were necessarily from the
alleged dead. It was not that I questioned the validity of the
messages; I was in no position to do so; but the source from
which they came, I felt, might have been that of my own sub
conscious mind, or that of the investigator. I knew that,
had I continued questioning in this fashion, I would be
incapable of doing the work expected of me, and that I would
also be shutting myself off from further objective investiga
tion and information. I went on therefore, with my work
as a trance medium at the British College of Psychic Science
until Hewat McKenzie died.

lofty attitude towards psychic matters had made possible the
serious development of my trance mediumship. This sustained
me up to that time, and through the years which followed.
Whatever integrity and seriousness I have been able to achieve
in my attitude towards using my supernormal sensitivities, I
feel I owe to the untiring patience and faith of this unflinching
and courageous man.

Chapter XXXI
MANIFESTATIONS OF PHYSICAL MEDIUMSHIP
AND EXPERIMENTS WITH POLTERGEIST PHENOMENA
HEW
AT McKenzie had always insisted that if my trance
mediumship were to serve its purpose, I must be willing
to keep out all aspects of physical mediumship when such
appeared. I had accepted his point of view on this matter,
and had therefore refused to encourage any of the manifesta
tions of physical mediumship. In my last years at the British
College, I showed signs of developing physical mediumship.
But as this force suddenly grew strong in me, I became curious
to investigate for myself whether it had any real use or
purpose.
Because I knew that Hewat McKenzie would not approve
of my opening myself consciously to this power, I consulted
some other leaders in the movement about it. A group of us
then sat experimentally together each week, for observation.
Before long my co-workers observed that I was beginning to
produce a misty, translucent stuff, related to ectoplasm. In
this substance, they noticed the formation of a series of faces
which they felt represented as many as twenty people whom
they had known in this life. It is possible that further experi
ment along these lines might have produced interesting results,
but I began to have an attack of conscience and hesitated to

allow such physical phenomena to develop further, contrary
to the advice of my friend, Hewat McKenzie.
I therefore went directly to him and told him just what
had been taking place in our experimental sittings. He talked
most seriously to me and explained exactly why he had advised
me against allowing such outbreaks of physical mediumship to
develop; they would, if I continued,' he insisted, interfere with
the growth of the deeper and finer aspects of my mental
mediumship, which he considered too valuable to interfere
with in this way. He warned me also that the hypersensitive
state of my body, which already subjected me to so much ill
health, could not possibly resist the added burden of the ter
rific strain of physical mediumship. Since I had already
experienced one or two manifestations of the shattering effect
of this physical power, I listened most attentively and follow
ing his advice, I shut down on any further experiment with
physical mediumship. I promised Mr. McKenzie, then, that
I would not indulge in any other form of physical investi
gation or development, until I had, for several more years,
solidly established by mental mediumship.
One of Hewat McKenzie's greatest interests in life was
the observation and study of poltergeist phenomena. The rea
son he gave for this was that he believed that such phenomena
contained the clearest and most objective proof of "survival
of life after death." He often recounted some of his own
experiences in dealing with the poltergeist. As these occur
rences were extremely rare, I had not ever expected to be pres
ent at any of them.
A poltergeist manifestation is known to take place usually
where there are present either adolescent children, or those of
retarded development. The outbreak can take many forms,
but its usual expression consists of violent and unexpected
movements of objects through space. These movements are
likely to be accompanied by either loud noises or explosions
or repeated rappings. There can, of course, be several explan
ations offered for the cause of these phenomena; but Hewat
McKenzie felt that the spiritualist hypothesis was the most

probable one. He believed that behind the manifestations of
every poltergeist, there existed an "unhappy spirit" earthbound
who was trying to attract attention by means of whatever
sudden movements and sounds it could produce. Sometimes
these "unhappy ones" might, he said, turn out to be connected
with the family, or the place in which the outbreak occurred.
Mr. McKenzie declared, from his own previous experiments, he
knew that if he could, with the help of a medium, reach the
"unhappy spirit" who caused the disturbance, he would then
be able to get at the cause of the poltergeist manifestation.
He asked me to assist him in the investigation of just
such an occurrence which he was about to explore. In order
to do my part, I was simply expected to go into trance. What
occurred from that moment I was told later, after I awoke
from trance. I heard then that Uvani had succeeded in
reaching the "unhappy spirit" which was causing poltergeist
disturbances, and had relayed to Mr. McKenzie the explanation
of why the troubled creature had come back to disturb his
relatives. Hewat McKenzie then undertook to unravel the
difficulties which had caused his return. In this particular
instance there were, I was later told, complications over a
lost will. McKenzie succeeded, through the directions given
to him by the unhappy spirit, in locating the document hid
den behind a picture frame. Satisfied by the successful out
come of his disturbing visit, the alleged grandfather departed
and that outbreak of phenomena gradually subsided and came
to an end.
Since that experiment I have assisted, successfully, at a
large number of these poltergeist experiments. The spirits who,
on these various occasions, unfolded their stories while I was
in trance, seemed without exception to have caused these
poltergeist disturbances because they were troubled by some
deep emotional conflict which had not been resolved before
their death. Revenge and the righting of wrongs often
seemed the motives for their return. When these complications
were removed, the manifestation of poltergeist phenomena
always ceased as abruptly as they had begun.

Chapter XXXII
1 TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY MEDIUMSHIP
AND SEEK A KEY TO ITS MEANING
AFTER
the death of Hewat McKenzie (summer of 1929),
I felt shaken and very much alone in my work; for now
the only person on whom I relied in the direction of my medi-
umship, had gone. It seemed impossible for me to continue any
longer at the British College for Psychic Science without his
support. But I now found myself so deeply committed to
work as a trance medium, that I could not easily withdraw
from that activity. I therefore, decided to work with a num
ber of other well-known spiritualist societies; in this way I
hoped to gain a more varied contact with people in this field,
and also expected to obtain a clearer understanding of the types
of people whom the other spiritualist societies attracted.
Although in my contacts with a number of organizations,
I had now a wider range of types to study, the quality of
their interests and the motivation of their activities were, I
soon discovered, no more profound than those of my previous
sitters at the British College. I began to notice that most of
those who had sat with me over long periods of time, seemed
well satisfied with the communications they received while I
was in trance; but I had come to the conclusion, however,
that instead of gaining strength and independence through
their work with me, they became more emotional than they

had been, and seemed less, instead of more, able to think out
or decide matters for themselves. I was disturbed by this
realization, for I feared that this might gradually lead to a
serious weakening of their mental fibre.
I was then beginning to take a new attitude towards my
own work. I began to feel a serious responsibility for the
effect of these trance communications on my sitters. Although
I accepted the activity of my control while I was in trance, I
began, nevertheless, to see that I too, was to a degree, respon
sible for the consequences of these messages. The realization
that there was far more deterioration than improvement in
most of the people who had a habit of working with me,
brought back all my old doubts as to the value and use of my
mediumship. I began to have a strong revulsion of feeling at
the part I had played in producing such results through trance.
Again I wondered whether I should not be finished with my
mediumship forever.
During this time, while working as a trance medium, my
daughter was happy at school and now as this period of doubt
about my work set in and I was considering a new cycle of
living I fell ill with para-typhoid fever. This was followed
by two serious operations which suspended all my activities
for many months.
During this time of my illness I lived close to my own
being, glad to immerse myself again in the realm of the two
minds and so forget all about the drifts and problems of the
trance work I had been doing. I returned in convalescence
to explore once more my world of light, sound and move
ment, and I began to discover for myself, that colour could
begin to heal me; I found out, for example, that I could
attract certain, specific beneficial rays to me by wearing cer
tain colours. I gradually began to find myself understanding
the meaning and the use of colour in the momentum and
equilibrium of many aspects of life. I believe that I had
learned then to revitalize myself by this new comprehension
which had come to me of the nature and use of colour vibra
tion. When my friends saw me again after my months of

serious illness, they were amazed that I gave out such a vivid
impression of health and vitality after so long a siege.
I was urged again to resume my activity as a trance
medium and for a while I forced myself to go on even though
the spirit of its usefulness seemed to have vanished for me.
My work continued to give satisfaction to those who came
to me, but I no longer felt that I was functioning usefully.
I longed to be free of my mediumship and I began to cultivate
an active social life, which I had avoided during these later
years of my psychic work.
Uvani had always been the only control who purported
to transmit messages and information when I was in trance,
until just before my illness, when a new personality spoke
through me to some of my sitters. They told me that his
name was Abdul Latif, and that he claimed to be a Persian
physician, who had lived in the time of the Crusades, at the
Court of Saladin. He first presented himself to an American
sitter and then later to an Englishman, who was especially
interested in healing work. From that time on he extended
his activities through my trance state to many people inter
ested in health and healing, and among these were several Lon
don physicians.
Abdul Latif had been known by spiritualists to appear
and work through a number of mediums in different parts
of the world, before he had ever spoken through my trance;
he still continues to do so with other sensitives as well as
with me. When I first heard of his appearance, I was afraid
lest this new manifestation be due to a split in my own per
sonality. I then studied carefully my own condition after
trance, in order to discover if there were any disturbing con
sequences. Since none were evident, I ceased troubling about
Abdul's presence. When I was first told that he had com
municated through me, I had never heard of his name; only
much later did I find out that he was already quite well-
known for his work through other mediums. From the
reports of my sitters, I began to realize that the level of my
trance communications had altered considerably since the

introduction of the alleged Abdul Latif; apart from his work
in healing and prophecy, he discussed both serious spiritual and
philosophic problems. He did not spend time on the constant
proof of "survival" as Uvani had done, so steadily, for many
years. I wondered why this change in the type of communi
cation occurred whenever Abdul Latif was said to be present.
Always needing to find my own answers to my problems,
I puzzled over this matter for some time, and finally came to
the conclusion that the level of communications might have
changed because the needs and wishes of the people who now
sat with me were different. They sought information and
advice on healing and philosophy and therefore, I began to
suspect the subconscious mind could reach out towards these
new areas and draw in whatever knowledge was sought. If
this were true, then two conclusions would be possible; either
that the control personalities were part of my subconscious,
or that the subconscious might be vaster and more profound
than anyone had yet imagined. Therefore, without coming to
any final conclusion on this point, I went on with my work
and produced results which were satisfactory. This seemed,
for the time being, more important for me to do than to
worry over the existence or non-existence of the personality
of Abdul Latif.

Chapter XXXIII
I PLAN TO GIVE UP THE USE OF MY
SUPERNORMAL POWERS
YET
the feeling of dissatisfaction recurred. Looking
back on the trance work I had done up to this time, I
realized that though I was producing results, I could not
wholly accept their significance. Finally I decided to try
to get some evidence for myself from the work of other
mediums. I felt that I could justifiably do this now, since
my own mediumship was firmly established. I attended
seances for both mental and physical phenomena, but I was
never able to get any form of evidence for myself which I
could accept. This increased my doubts as to the usefulness
of my own trance communications. Again my health was
poor and several physicians suggested that the separation due
to my use of trance, might well be the cause of my many
illnesses; I personally believed that my own conflict and
doubts concerning the nature of my work had driven me to
a point of nervous tension and exhaustion. The combination
of these circumstances made me determine to give up com
pletely, all my work as a trance medium.
My friends protested and could not believe that having
carried on my psychic work so seriously and steadily to the
satisfaction of my sitters for many years, that I could now
seriously intend to give it up. Some of them, distressed at my

decision, undertook to discuss the matter with the control
personality, Abdul Latif, while I was in trance. They reported
that he made light of my intention and said, "This is only
a process in her further development. I wouldn't worry
her about it. She will go through with this, but will not,
as she thinks, give up her mediumship." My friends reported
all this to me, but I ignored the reported comments of Abdul
Latif, and I went right ahead with my plans. I again heard
a voice, toneless and cold, which said to me, "Make the most
of your happiness; it cannot last." I shuddered, and remem
bered that similar warnings had been the forerunner to the
deaths of my two sons. Now this undoubtedly applied to not
only my determination to give up professional psychic work
but to my determination to try to find some personal happiness
again. A dear and valued friend had convinced me that in
marriage to him such happiness was possible and life moved
ahead smoothly enough for us, until the day that the banns
of our marriage were published. On that very day both my
fiance and I fell suddenly ill. I developed an active mastoid
and he caught a serious chill, which quickly developed into
septic pneumonia. Within a week he was dead, and I was
lying in a hospital, dangerously ill from the complications
of a burst appendix and mastoid. I was then so near to death
myself, that no one dared tell me that my fiance had died;
I was still in a critical condition when the doctors thought
fit to inform me of his tragic end. Perhaps the shock was
too much for me, for I now developed a sudden high tem
perature, and again was forced to undergo still another
operation, this time on the throat.
I was told by my own physician, long after I had recov
ered, that the doctors and the nurses in the operating room at
that time had heard clearly the tones of a voice, which spoke
just after I had become unconscious from taking the anesthetic.
No one present seemed to know exactly what the voice said;
but my own physician who, in his youth, had been in India,
told me that he recognized certain definite words of com
mand, as spoken in Hindustani. He knew that I personally,

had no knowledge whatever of any Oriental language, and
that at that moment, because of the way I was bound up, I
would have been quite unable to utter a word anyway. He
was so impressed by this incident, that he sent a letter to one
of the leaders in the spiritualist movement, recording the exact
circumstances of this occurrence. It is surprising to note
that G. R. S. Mead, the well known scholar, who often during
this period, communicated with Abdul Latif through my
mediumship, as well as through other sensitives, reported that
he was informed by Abdul Latif, shortly after this occurrence,
that he had been present in the hospital room during my
operation.
It was many months before I recovered sufficiently from
this protracted illness to begin to consider my future. The
state of my health now made it impossible for me to try to
undertake any new type of work. The only thing that I could
envisage doing, was to take up my mediumship again, but I
decided, it would have to be in a new and very different man
ner from any of my previous work. I felt that the only con
dition under which I would now use my trance, would be for
the purpose of investigating it and other psychic phenomena.
This new attitude had developed as the result of startling
changes in my own psychic make-up, during the days of
convalescence.
One evening, when I was feeling very low and weak, I
was lying quietly in my hospital room, when I became aware
of the ebbing away of my vitality; I felt that if this con
tinued I should soon lose consciousness. The next thing I
knew the wardrobe standing against the wall opposite my
bed was tottering and crackling and explosive sounds were
coming from it. I was terrified and rang for the nurse. The
moment she entered the room the manifestations ceased; but
I knew that when she left again, the outbreak would recur.
I explained to the nurse what had happened and begged her to
remain with me. She humoured me and stayed a little while.
Scarcely had she left me when the wardrobe started to shake
again and a particularly strong interior explosion threw open

its doors. I was just able to touch my bell before I passed out
in a dead faint. It took me twenty-four hours to recover
from the effects of this experience. The nurse told my doctor
that, while standing in the hallway, she had heard the explosive
noise which took place in my room just before I fainted.
As a result of this disturbance, the doctor who treated
me now admitted that he himself was clairvoyant, and told
me that he felt sure I had just undergone an important
psychic experience; but beyond that he could give me no fur
ther help in understanding what had taken place. However
much I had been frightened at that time, the experience
heightened my clairvoyant perceptions; they were now definitely
opened, and they have remained active ever since. A knowl
edge of this new development in myself led me on to try to
discover what principles made possible the occurrence of
psychic phenomena.
No sooner had I come to this determination, than the
way for me to carry it out, presented itself in an almost
miraculous manner. I received an invitation to visit the United
States, and to work there under the auspices of the American
Society for Psychic Research.

Chapter XXXIV
TO THE UNITED STATES IN SEARCH OF
OBJECTIVE RESEARCH
ISAILED for the United States in the autumn of 1931, and
I worked for six months in New York, under the auspices
of the American Society for Psychical Research. I left Lon
don expecting that the American Society would be much more
scientific than the spiritualist groups which I had worked
with in London. My first disappointment came when I found
that although this organization was established originally for
psychical research, the majority of its members were spiritual
ists; these, as was the case with the English, were not in the
least concerned with the objective investigation of mental
phenomena. I was amazed to find that no attempt was made
in the American group to keep objective records of the sit
ting which I gave. And again I found myself surrounded by
people whose only interest was in communicating with the
dead.
I was deeply disappointed, but I remained in America to
fulfill my contract. Continuing under the auspices of the
same society, I then visited Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The research in these cities was even less objective than the
work in New York.
However an opportunity soon came to me to do some
special research in one of the well-known American universi

ties. It was, I heard, to be an investigation of my powers of
trance, clairvoyance and psychometry. I spent some weeks in
those laboratories over these experiments, but the results were
never published.
My next piece of research dealt with telepathy, taking
place over a distance. I worked on this subject with several
well-known psychiatrists and scientists in America who were
much interested in the problem. Besides myself, a note-taker
and two investigators were included in each experiment. One
of these investigators was present in the room with the note-
taker and me, while the other one was always at some con
siderable distance; sometimes in another part of the city, some
times as far away as across a continent, or even on the other
side of the world. Although the investigators considered these
experiments as being purely telepathic, I knew that in order
to do them I had also to employ both clairvoyance and pro
jection; but as telepathy itself was the only concern of these
researchers I was never asked to explain how I did the work.
In all these experiments the results were outstanding; they
not only proved telepathic communication, but they also con
tained evidence of clairvoyance, prevision and clairaudience.
In the room arranged for the experiment, the investi
gator at a distance from me and of course unseen prepared
a series of objects, perhaps on a table; I was expected to get an
impression of them and describe these to the note-taker. At
the same time the investigator would also select some subjects
to think about; they might concern the title and contents of
the last book he had read, or the automobile accident which
had happened to his child.
If I were expected to pick up the impressions of the
objects resting on the table, my method was first to use pro
jection, and then clairvoyance alone; but when I had to pick
up thoughts from the investigator's mind at a distance, I
first used projection and then telepathy. If the investigator
at a distance thought about the objects on the table, and I
drew these impressions from his thoughts, I was then not
using clairvoyance, but telepathy. In the many experiments

I had done of this type, I have found no one who was aware
of the fine distinction between the steps of these processes of
projection, clairvoyance, telepathy and clairaudience, and how
they were related to each other. In order to explain them, I
shall have to use concrete examples of my own work.
Let me use, first, as an instance, one of my experiments in
what the investigators call telepathy at a distance. I shall
tell the circumstances of an active experiment, but the names
of places, personalities and the exact materials used in the
experiment are purposely disguised. We worked this experi
ment between Newfoundland and New York. I was in New
York; a well-known medical man had arranged the condi
tions of the test in his home in Newfoundland. I knew for
myself that in order to accomplish the experiment success
fully, I would have to use conscious projection in order to
arrive at that destination in Newfoundland, which I was
expected to reach.
It will, therefore, be necessary for me to explain the
process by which I knowingly project. What is not gen
erally accepted by science, but which I nevertheless know to
be true, is that everyone has a double, of finer substance than
the physical body; it is referred to either as the astral or as
the etheric body by some scientists. This is not to be confused
with the surround; which remains in position enveloping the
human body, while the double can be projected. It is by means
of this double that either accidental or conscious projection
is accomplished; now in these experiments I was doing con
scious projection, and I know from my own experience, that
when I project this double, I do so from the centre of my
chest above the breasts. From the moment I begin to pro
ject, I am aware at this point, of a pull, accompanied by a
fluttering, which causes the heart to palpitate, and the breath
ing to speed up, accompanied also, if the projection is a long
one, by a slight choking in the larynx and a heady sensa
tion. As long as the projection continues, I remain aware of
these sensations taking place in my physical body.

While I am in a state of projection, the double is appar
ently able to use the normal activity of all five senses which
work in my physical body. For example, I may be sitting in
a drawing room on a snowy day and yet be able in projection
to reach a place where summer is at that moment full blown;
in that instant, I can register with all my five physical senses
the sight of the flowers and the sea, I can smell the scent of
the blossoms and the tang of the ocean spray, and hear the
birds sing and the waves beat against the shore. Strange to
say, I never forget the smallest detail of any such experience
which has come to me through conscious projection, though
in ordinary daily living I can be quite forgetful and memories
of places or things may grow dim. It might be interesting here
to note certain differences that occur to me during conscious
and unconscious projection. In the unconscious state when
I may be day-dreaming, or on the verge of sleep, my double
may slip out without my willing it and sometimes strike
obstacles in space which block its free movement and cause
a repercussion to my nervous system and a shock to my phys
ical body. Such impacts never occur when I project myself
at will into space; this is due to the fact that I then move
out consciously in a more flexible and fluid state.
Now for the Newfoundland experiment mentioned above:
In my projected state in that place in Newfoundland, where
the experiment was set up, I found myself not only at the
place of the experiment, but before I entered the house, I
was able to see the garden and the sea, as well as the house
I was supposed to enter; I actually sensed the damp of the
atmosphere and saw the flowers growing by the pathway.
Then I passed through the walls and I was inside the room
in which the experiment was to take place. There was no
one there and I looked up the staircase searching for the experi-
mentor I had been told would be there. If I had to move
upstairs to find him, that would mean additional effort on my
part, but fortunately he walked down the stairs at that
moment, and entered the room which I knew had been selected
for the experiment. What took place then included not only

telepathy, but the entire range of supernormal sensing, includ
ing clairvoyance, clairaudience and precognition. The doctor in
this experiment, himself had powers of supernormal sensing, and
was obviously aware of my presence and that the experiment
had begun. In what I am about to relate, the proof of our
mutual awareness will soon become evident.
Speaking aloud and addressing me, he said, "This will be
a successful experiment," and I sitting in a New York room,
was able to receive this speech, seemingly through my physical
hearing. The investigator in Newfoundland addressed my
double which I had projected into his study, and said, "Now
look at the objects on the table." I followed his direction from
that moment on, in much the same way as a hypnotized per
son responds to suggestion. I could see the objects on the
table, not by means of ordinary sight, but through clairvoyant
vision; I then gave a description of what I saw to the note-
taker with me in New York. I heard the doctor say, "Make
my apologies to the experimentors at your end. I have had
an accident and cannot work as well as I had hoped." I
transmitted what I was hearing in Newfoundland to the note-
taker in New York, in the exact words which had been spoken
to me, and I also described the bandage on the doctor's head.
This had scarcely been done, when I heard the experimentor
in New York comment, in an aside, "This can't possibly be
true, because I had a letter a few days ago and the . doctor
was quite well then."
The experiment continued and I remained in my projected
state; I followed the activity of the investigator in Newfound
land. The next thing he did was to walk slowly to his book
case in his room; before he reached it I knew that he was
thinking of a certain book and I knew its position on the
shelf; this was telepathy. He took it down and held it up in
his hands with the definite idea that I, being present, could
read its title and he then opened it and without speaking,
read to himself a paragraph out of this volume. The book was
about Einstein and his theories of relativity. The paragraph
he had selected, he read through silently, and as he did so, I

was able to receive from his mind, the telepathic impressions
of what he read. The sense of his reading, I reported in my
own words to the stenographer in New York. In the mean
time, the experimentor, speaking aloud, told me in my pro
jected state, that during this experiment, he too had projected
himself into the bedroom in New York of the psychiatrist
who was his co-experimentor. He proceeded to describe the
two photographs that he had actually seen there on his previous
(physical) visit to New York, but he now explained in New
foundland, that these photographs had been put away, and
that the bedroom of his friend had been redecorated since his
actual physical visit.
This was the end of that experiment, and the recorder
commented when it was over, that the entire proceeding had
taken fifteen minutes. Had this experiment rested on telepa
thy, alone, I could never have reached nor seen the experi
mentor, the locality or the room and set-up for the experiment.
All that pure telepathy could have produced would have been
the thoughts in the experimentor' s mind, and the impressions
of the words he spoke aloud to me. Much that made this
experiment unusual and striking, was that this doctor in New
foundland also had the power to project himself, and was
then able to receive impressions clairvoyantly and telepathi-
cally from the place in New York, as I projected and did the
same to his home in Newfoundland.
The record of the experiment in New York was posted
that night to the doctor in Newfoundland. Next morning a
telegram was received from him; in it, he described an acci
dent which had occurred just before we began our experiment,
and a day later a letter was received from him, listing the
steps of the experiment as he had planned it. The telegram
proved that I had not only heard his message correctly, when
he spoke to my "double" there, but I had actually perceived
his bandaged head. Remember, he opened the experiment by
predicting that it would be successful; this prophecy was
more than justified by our unusual results. I had succeeded
in catching and relaying this prediction telepathically; so that

in this case precognition and telepathy occurred simultaneously.
From his letter, we learned that he had used a table and
placed upon it a series of objects which I had seen correctly
by means of clairvoyance; every step of my description of
his behaviour turned out also to be correct. The book he
removed from the shelf, the title and the subject matter he
read to himself, were as I described them when received through
my own conscious projection, and my application of clair
voyance and telepathy. Without the use of these additional
faculties of perception, such a complex experiment would not
have been possible.
The mechanisms I use in precognition are closely linked
to the mechanisms I have already described for projection.
This and all the other steps in psychic functioning are induced
by conscious changes in my breathing. To do precognition I
have to conceive of standing outside of time; that is a process
which I learned as a child when I drew back from the curving
movements of colour and light, in order to watch them more
closely. In this stepping back, I perceive yesterday, today and
tomorrow as a single curve, the circumference of which
becomes visible to me at all points on its surface. It is only
by moving out of time, away from past, present and future
that I can examine their every aspect. In this state they
present themselves to me, not as in sequence, but as existing
simultaneously; in that moment, time loses all reality and I
seem able to live in the past and future at one and the same
instant. To me then, there can be no such thing as present
time, for the moment we begin to think in the present, it is
already past, and the future is already present.
Soon after this telepathic work I completed a piece of
research work already begun by the famous psychic
researcher, Hereward Carrington. His study was an attempt to
test the validity of JJvani and Abdul Latif, as trance person
alities, quite separate from my own. He used for this pur
pose two types of testing; the measurement of the psycho
galvanic reactions and the well-known association-word-tests;
in this psychological test, if the association reactions of Uvani,

Abdul Latif and myself should each be quite different, to this
single list of carefully selected key words, then presumably
these two trance personalities would not be drawing from the
same subconscious memory as my own, and therefore the
minds of the two controls would then be regarded as
psychologically separate from mine.
The plan of this experiment was well worth carrying out,
and the results, as far as they went, showed certain striking
differences of response, between the alleged trance personalities
and myself; but a more intensive study of this subject would
have to be made in order to draw any final conclusions as to
the identity or non-identity of trance personalities with myself.
Another study along similar lines was undertaken with me
in England during the following summer, by a well-known
psychic researcher. The conditions under which the experi
ments took place were, in my opinion, not sufficiently scien
tific. The galvanometer was not delicate enough to register
my exact reactions, and the researcher sometimes tested me
without having anyone else present to witness the work.
I made several attempts, at this time, to get some scien
tists I knew, interested in further research of objective mental
phenomena, hoping to get them to repeat and thus recheck
some of the work that Hereward Carrington had done with
me in America; but without success. The subject still remains
an important one, and would lend itself to serious research,
if it were properly conducted and carefully recorded by trained
investigators.

Chapter XXXV
MY CHANGING ATTITUDE TO MY MEDIUMSHIP
SINCE
no scientist I knew seemed ready to go deeper into
the investigation of mental mediumship with me, I
resigned myself to returning to my work with the spiritualist
societies. Now then something unexpected took place. I, who
had hitherto given many successful sittings each week, found
myself unable to produce results. I wondered whether my
trance mediumship was coming to an end and I was encour
aged to believe this by the people who came to me. Most
of them considered that scientific research was unnecessary
and that the experiments had probably interfered with the
activities of the control.
I soon learned, however, that this was not the point of
view of the control; I heard from some of the regular, more
objective sitters, that Uvani said that he would not cooperate
in giving advice, and producing purely personal evidence any
longer for sitters who were not concerned with the serious and
objective method of his work. He also stated that for many
years he had given sufficient proof of the truth of "survival,"
and that he was now prepared to deal primarily with the more
serious aspects of living and research. I was again in con
flict with myself, over the nature and meaning of all my
own trance work, and I began to question the validity of my
control. Up to this time I had been able to consider Uvani

as a pale shadow in the background of my work who had
helped towards its results.
Now a new problem presented itself to me. If I were
failing to produce the evidence which the spiritualists sought,
and Uvani were unwilling to cooperate further in that way,
in all seriousness I asked myself what indeed was the nature
of this control? Did he have any reality apart from myself,
and if so was his intelligence superior to mine? I also began
to question whether evidences of "survival" could really be
obtained by this method of trance mediumship, which I was
using? The profound implications lying behind the entire
process of communication were brought home to me. I had
been sitting for over ten years, acting as the channel through
which alleged conversations took place between the living
and the dead; either this procedure was a tremendous self-
deception, and none of what was spoken came from super
normal sources; or else it was a source of profound truth
and it should never have been allowed to be played with in
the casual handling of so-called psychic researchers who were
interested largely in personal messages. Maybe, I realised, the
great philosophers and teachers of old understood this verity,
when they kept certain great spiritual laws apart from the
multitude, revealing them only to such as had attained a high
state of being. I began to feel that the great religious teachers
of the past had understood this principle of which modern
man seemed ignorant, and that perhaps this was the cause of
the division of religions into the esoteric and an exoteric
teaching.
This realization grew more powerful to me as I weighed
its implications; man I knew, had always been able to gain
infinite knowledge from the Universe by means of Revelation,
but only at such times as his state of being was truly desirous
and inwardly prepared for its reception. Again I wanted to
reconsider what purpose or meaning could be attributed to my
own work as a sensitive. I had to retrace my steps and
re-examine the process by which I had established my trance
mediumship. I realised now that those who had been able to

help me develop my mental powers, were spiritualists and had
inevitably conditioned the products of my trance communica
tions. Their own faith in, and desire to communicate with
their dead, had, I came to believe, given the initial impetus to
these trance communications which they obtained through me.
If this speculation of mine were correct, then would not other
sitters who did not have a spiritualist philosophy, but who
sought sincerely through my trance for some other revelation
of knowledge or confirmation of faith, also be able to reach
quite different levels of communication?
It was not long before I understood the answer to this
question; for with the new trance personality of Abdul Latif
introduced, certain entirely different levels of understanding
had begun to open in my trance work; subjects such as heal
ing, philosophy and religion had replaced the flow of spiritual
ist messages. I began to understand also that had I been
born in some different culture or civilisation, I would have
been conditioned to become a channel for quite other com
munications. Had I been born in India or China, or the
Congo, I might only have produced in my trance such com
munications as were sought by those of the local faith
or cultural tradition. Now I believed I saw a certain prin
ciple at work, behind all communication —namely that the
subconscious mind was a vehicle capable of expanding indefi
nitely and able to contact all possible realms of understanding
which it might choose to reach.
I came back from these speculations as to the meaning of
man's capacity to reach areas of understanding beyond his
conscious knowledge, to re-examine the mechanisms by which
it was possible to communicate. This led me to continue with
renewed seriousness in my consideration of my own medium-
ship and an analysis of the means by which it took place.
I tried to diagram the process of trance mediumship. In
it we have three personalities to consider—the control, the
medium and the investigator. Each is limited by his own
point of view and experience, and in the case of two of the
three involved, control and medium; control and investigator;

unknown to each other by way of the usual human contacts
and exchange. What takes place between these three per
sonalities? I assumed that the control exists and I allowed him
in this assumption to function as the personality he claims to
be. I assumed that his experience is as conditioned in its
own way, as that of the medium and the investigator; his role,
as we know it, is to transmit communications through the
medium's mind.
Here is what takes place in a specific sitting. The inves
tigator arrives; the medium goes into trance, and the control
begins to speak. Let us suppose this enquirer has come to
speak with a dead sister, fully convinced that this is pos
sible. The control correctly describes the dead sister and
gives her name as "Prudence." The investigator says this is
true. Then comes a message advising the brother to dispose
of the family property to the real estate man who visits him
tomorrow. Before the investigator accepts this advice, he
asks his sister for some real evidence of her identity. She
refers to the amethyst ring on his finger, which had belonged
to their dead mother; she also describes an accident which
occurred to him in the River Seine, when he was studying in
France, at the age of eighteen; she describes the death of his
older brother after an operation for appendicitis. All these
proofs the investigator admits are true. He then asks his
dead sister, through the control about the place which she
now inhabits and enquires about her present activities. She
tells him that she is content and working hard at her own
development with others who have passed on; but she is
vague about the conditions of her present dwelling. This we
may take as an example of the kind of information which
comes through in a sitting. What then is the value of such
information and by what mechanisms has it been gathered
together and presented to the enquirer?
To my knowledge, nobody has as yet sought an answer
to these questions, on the nature and functioning of medium-
ship. In order to obtain it for myself, I found it necessary
to examine every step which takes place in trance mediumship.

Return with me therefore, to the example which I have just
cited, and begin to watch the medium go into trance, and
the control appearing to take possession. (We know that sci
ence regards the state of trance as the product of auto-sug
gestion, that it can first be produced by some unexpected
shock or fear, or the desire of the individual to escape from
some painful condition of living; its appearance can also be
due to the influence of suggestion from another person.)
The next step to observe in a trance sitting, is how the
control deals with communication. The average sitter is usu
ally too emotional and eager to be critical of what takes place.
The control first introduces to the investigator whatever per
sonality is present for him. In the example I've used above, it
was the dead sister whom he described as blue-eyed and wear
ing braids of fair hair coiled around her head; he gave her
name as "Prudence." The sitter accepts these statements as
correct and he agrees that the evidence offered by his sister
concerned actual experiences of his own life. This type of
sitting occurs frequently and I am told that Uvani has pro
duced much evidence of this type, when I am in trance. (But
I am also able, in the waking state, to give similar evidence
clairvoyantly. I can see dead relatives surrounding the peo
ple who seek my help and sometimes I hear the names of these
dead ones, and receive the impression of the message they
wish to transmit. I see all this in a series of images and
symbols, which shift and change before my clairvoyant sight.
This is only the beginning of the process; the most difficult and
most important part follows: this is the interpretation of these
pictures and symbols. What must not be ignored is that the
meaning of these images and symbols depends entirely on my
limited human interpretation of them.)
This control, Uvani, has been questioned by my more
objective sitters as to the process that he uses in communica
tion. He has stated more than once that he receives messages
by means of visual impressions and he must interpret the
meaning of these images in order to project them through my
mind. He explained how he got the impression of the names

of dead relatives for a sitter. In the example I have just
used, of the sister's name "Prudence," Uvani explained that
he first saw an upright column; he was not certain at first
whether it was intended to form a "P" or an "F"; he then
saw the image of a purse, and then knew the letter to be "P."
He asked whether the purse meant anything to the sitter; on
receiving a negative response, he sought further association
with the meaning of the word "purse." Words such as
"caution," "saving" and "prudence" came to him. Then, with
a flash, he said "something fell into place" and he knew that
the name was "Prudence." He announced this as the name
of the sister, and the investigator admitted that this was so.
The way in which the name of the sister was secured by
Uvani, while I was in the trance state, is exactly the way I
work in the clairvoyant, waking state. It is evident to me
from this that the stimulation taking place in the trance and
clairvoyant states is similar. This, I think, opens up a tre
mendous field for objective research in the future, as to how
the subconscious mind arrives at these impressions through
images and symbols.
In examining my own process of clairvoyance, I have
become aware that I draw the knowledge which helps me
build the images of the dead relatives and friends of those
who need help, from the subconscious minds of the sitters.
Is it not possible therefore, that the control does likewise, with
or without being aware whence he draws the substance for his
images? If there is truth in this conclusion of mine, is there
not a possibility that the control personality is unnecessary
to the reaching of what is considered supernormal knowledge?
Such information may be there, within areas of the subcon
scious mind though the conscious mind may not be aware
of it, nor yet know how to reach it.
Whether the material received by clairvoyance, or in the
trance state, does come from the subconscious of the sitter,
or from supernormal levels, it is in either case received in
pictures and images which need interpretation. This is the
important part to remember: the symbols and images of clair-

voyant seeing or of trance communication can be misinter
preted and misunderstood. So long as the human mind is
responsible for the interpretation of matters dealing with sub
jects beyond its own limited experience, there is bound to be
inaccuracy and distortion. If it were possible for a tenant of
another state of being, to try to communicate his ideas by
aid of symbols to a human being in this dimension, it is very
doubtful if our type of human intelligence would ever fully
comprehend what was being transmitted. If my reasoning on
this subject were correct, it would lead to the conclusion
that no control, nor trance state is necessary to obtain what
is termed supernormal knowledge.
I hesitated to allow myself to think too persistently
along these lines, since I realised that the majority of experi
enced and trained investigators whom I had met (up to that
time) would not agree with me. My desire to explore more
deeply this aspect of the problem of trance mediumship and
of all "supernormal communication," made me eager to work
with trained scientists, who would be interested in such a
serious study of mental phenomena.
Now it was practically impossible for me to continue to
give "evidence of survival" in the old way, since I no longer
was sure that it came from the alleged dead. I felt, from that
time on that if I went on giving such evidence through my
trance state, I might become a party to fraud. I therefore,
determined, in order to protect my own integrity, whether I
was understood or not by spiritualists and others wanting sit
tings, to begin to exclude this type of communication.
This forced me to become more objective about myself.
I had not originally wanted to become a medium, and had
never consciously sought this method of using my super
normal perceptions. Nor had I ever been wholly at peace with
my work of using trance for communication. But whilst I
was coming gradually to reject the thought of the control as
a personality, and to reject as well the mechanics of trance, as
the means of reaching supernormal knowledge, I was neverthe
less, aware that there was some Force outside myself which

worked through me to produce supernormal functioning. I
was still at a loss to understand how this energy worked
through me, where it came from and what its purpose could
be.
Looking back over my life I knew that ever since I was
a small child, I had been aware of such sound, movement and
colour, as other people apparently did not sense or see; these
perceptions unfolded and grew until now I found in myself,
powers which gave me the ability to see clairvoyantly, hear
clairaudiently, and sense telepathetically what took place around
me. Through the years I had obtained enough objective proof
for myself that these faculties produced correct results; but
what I did not know was how they worked, or how I came
to be in possession of them.
The answer to these questions I thought could only be
found with the help of those who were trained in exact
methods of Science.

Chapter XXXVI
WHAT I DISCOVER ABOUT TELEPATHY AND
CLAIRVOYANCE IN THE RESEARCH AT
DUKE UNIVERSITY
S at that time there seemed to me no opportunity to do
-f*- research in England, I returned to America in the
autumn of 1933. I got in touch with the late Professor
William McDougall, who was then at Duke University and I
asked him whether he knew of any objective investigation in
this field being done in America. He told me that research
in parapsychology was then being carried on at Duke Uni
versity, and that if I were interested in cooperating, he would
be happy to have me come down and take part in the experi
ments with his assistant, Professor J. B. Rhine; but Dr.
McDougall explained that he would be absent from these
experiments as he was about to return to England.
I was eager and interested at the prospect of working at
last, in a University which was prepared to do objective
research of this kind. When I met Professor Rhine, I was
charmed with his directness, simplicity and enthusiasm, and
heard with interest, of his plan of work for studying telepathy
and clairvoyance. He told me that he had already done a con
siderable amount of experimental work with a group of stu
dents and that he now looked forward to doing a similar

study with me. Dr. Rhine explained to me the way he worked
in order to examine clairvoyant and telepathic powers and he
showed me the (now famous)" type of especially designed,
cards which he used for his investigation. The experiments,
to date had shown him that the students who had clairvoyant,
ability, had also telepathic power and he also thought it
possible that other supernormal, perceptions might later be
revealed and observed by further investigation.
He used the term Extra-Sensory to describe any percep
tion which could not be attributed to the working of the
ordinary five senses; he had abbreviated this term for con
venience to the initials ESP which have since become the
accepted condensation for Extra Sensory Perception in all
research of this type. It is unnecessary for me to describe
Dr. Rhine's technique of testing with his special cards; it is
now well known because of his magazine articles and his
books, to those who are interested in this field of research.
After making thousands of tests with his students, Dr. Rhine
came to certain conclusions as to their powers of telepathy
and clairvoyance and he aroused great interest and controversy
in the general public by his statement that about one in five
of those students tested showed decided ESP ability.
When I heard from Dr. Rhine that he had been testing
his students for telepathic and clairvoyant ability by means
of these ESP cards, I was glad at his suggestion, to submit to
the same experiments. He thought that it would be especially
interesting to check my known powers of clairvoyance and
telepathy by his recently developed tests. I began the experi
ments with interest and enthusiasm, never doubting that it
would be a simple matter for me to produce results quite
easily by means of this new technique. But after a few tests
for clairvoyance with the cards, it was evident that my scores
were unusually low. As I had done so much successful work
in clairvoyance and telepathy for many years, I began to ask
myself why I could not produce them also with Dr. Rhine's
ESP cards.

My study of this revelation brought me to certain definite
conclusions as to why the method by which I had been able
consciously to produce clairvoyance in my own work in the
past, was not applicable to the laboratory tests with the ESP
cards. I tried to explain my conclusions to Dr. Rhine and he
seemed to listen sympathetically, but without giving too
serious consideration to my explanation, he asked me to con
tinue the card tests in the same way as I had commenced
them. I did so, in order that he might complete his experi
ment, and also that I might continue to examine most care
fully every step of the technique of his work (and my results)
both in the experiments with me and with the students.
I was first challenged to reexamine the processes by which
I worked supernormally when doing these experiments at
Duke University. I stated my conclusion at the time to Dr.
Rhine, that I was sure clairvoyance and telepathy depended
upon an active radiation registering between two people or
between an individual and an object; and since the ESP cards
lacked such radiation, they did not stimulate my clairvoyant
vision. I repeat this now, not as a mere theory, concerning
the ESP cards, but as a practical conclusion based on years of
supernormal experience.
There
is,
I
am well aware, among psychic researchers
and those few psychologists who accept the validity of super
normal sensing, little agreement as to the nature of these
powers, or as to their method of functioning. Most of the
time the scientists and specialists who discuss the subject, are
theorizing as to what telepathy or clairvoyance may or may
not be; not on what they know as fact from the develop
ment of their own psychic faculties or from any objective
research on the functioning of these powers.
I
considered the
beginning of Dr. Rhine's experiments in ESP
a
most promis
ing and important step in the direction of objective research
concerning the nature of supernormal functioning.
I
have
heard him state in
a
lecture, before publishing the results of
his work on ESP, that he did not believe that the theory of
radiation contained
a
possible explanation of clairvoyance and

telepathy. At another meeting in answer to a question, he
admitted that he did not know what this Extra Sensatory Per
ception which he was testing really was. Dr. Rhine is appar
ently not the only scientist working in this field who does not
know the nature of these supernormal powers, for I have not
yet been able to find an exact description of the process of
clairvoyance or telepathy produced by either a psychic or a
scientific investigator of this subject. This gives me the cour
age to go ahead and try to describe, at least, what I know
occurs when I become clairvoyant or telepathic. The method
by which I place myself in a psychic state with the help of
certain processes of breathing and stimulation from an object
or a person, may not be the way in which other psychics
work. But I am conscious of my own processes throughout
the work and I shall therefore try to describe the way in
which my own supernormal faculties become active:
Clairvoyance as I know it, cannot simply be directed to
order on any particular subject. I may, or may not, be able
to get knowledge clairvoyantly concerning a specific person
or object. I can only do so if I receive an adequate energy
stimulus (which I shall presently explain) , from the individual
or the object. In order to reach a psychic state in which I
can sense and see clearly, I need such a stimulus. And then
what comes to me clairvoyantly, I sense and see simultaneously
in a series of images which are animated, but simple, like a
child's drawings. After I have received such impressions and
visions in this way, I must then struggle to find words to
interpret them adequately to the listener. What I receive
may be much or little. This depends on the degree of the
energy stimulus I receive, as well as my own condition of
psychic sensitivity at the time.
Suppose that the object I am asked to be clairvoyant about
happens to be a watch. If it were a brand new watch which
had just come from a factory, the most that I could get
from it clairvoyantly, would be images connected with its
manufacture. I might get episodes of the people in the fac
tory who set the springs in place, or of those who melted the

silver for its case or of the salesman who sold it in the shop.
But the watch would not as yet, have developed a "personal
history" of its own by being long in the possession of one or
more people. On the other hand, should I be asked to become
clairvoyant about a particular watch which has lived with
many owners, I could not predict just what part of its his
tory I might begin to get impressions about clairvoyantly,
at a given time, but I would certainly be able to describe
some aspects of its wanderings and perhaps some of the life
of its various owners. So unpredictable is this process of clair
voyant psychometrizing that one day I might get images of
the history of one of the watch's owners, and at another time,
some quite different episodes from the life of someone else
who possessed the watch; and yet in many such experiments
which I have made in the course of the years, the various
episodes might all prove to be true about that watch. This type
of clairvoyance concerning things, is popularly known as psy-
chometry, though it is not an accurate word for describing the
process.
People as well as objects must give out an energy stimulus
by which I am able to work clairvoyantly. But if when I
begin to do so, the natural stimulation which I know I receive
from the active emanations or radiations of people or objects is
interrupted or not permitted to enter spontaneously into the
conditions of an experiment, then I am left without the
natural stimulus which . I have always found necessary in
order to work supernormally.
For me Dr. Rhine's ESP cards, just like the new watch I
have been describing, lacked that energy stimulus which
would make it possible for me to see the symbols on the cards
clairvoyantly by the light of their own radiation. In fact
during many of these tests, I seemed to be inhibited by the
very limitations set to the experiments, from using whatever
supernormal powers I possess. But when I could not get these
from the ESP cards themselves, I found that I could some
times, when Dr. Rhine was fresh at the work, draw them
from his own mind, when he concentrated on them. When

ever I used this process, my scores at reading the ESP cards
at what was called clairvoyance, would rise perceptibly.
But I want to make it clear that when I did this with Dr.
Rhine I was, from my viewpoint, really working telepath-
ically and not clairvoyantly. In this connection it is interest
ing to note that whenever I was doing the planned telepathic
experiments with the ESP cards at Duke, I obtained better
results than with clairvoyance. Whether I did these telepathic
experiments with one of the students or whether I picked the
images of the cards telepathically from the mind of Dr. Rhine,
I was, in both cases, freed from the limitation of the direct
use of the cards and their inanimate symbols. Instead, I was
able to catch the moving symbols which the mind of either
Dr. Rhine or a student projected to me through space. By being
passed through the mind of another, the symbols were thus
made to live again and register for me supernormally.
My interpretation of what takes place, in my own experi
ence, is that the card symbol when thought of, is projected
as a light image, moving through space, and thus reaches me
as a form of radiation. (In the last part of this book I discuss
in greater detail the way I believe such radiation registers
through space, working through all forms of organisms, human
and otherwise.) What I have, since childhood, seen as a neb
ulous surround, enveloping each living organism, has, according
to my present understanding, a definite use and purpose as
receiver and transmitter of radiation throughout the universe.
I have, in recent years, come to call this human aura or
surround a magnetic field.
Although I had defined my position towards telepathy
and clairvoyance to Dr. Rhine, he wished me to return to
Duke University and continue working by his experimental
methods for a second year. I did so, but the results produced
never had, from my point of view, anything to do with true
clairvoyance; they were to me then as now, only guesses, as to
what images existed on the face of Dr. Rhine's ESP cards.
However many thousands of tests might be made with the
technique followed by Dr. Rhine and his assistants, with the

students and myself, their conclusions never changed my per
sonal conviction that I was simply guessing at the symbols on
those ESP cards. Clairvoyance, as I understand it, from my
many years of work, depends, for me at least, on the use of
an active radiation or emanation from person or object as a
stimulus. I have spoken of an energy stimulus as being neces
sary in clairvoyance and telepathy. I had such a stimulus in
my work at Duke, not from the ESP cards, but from the
interest and enthusiasm of Dr. Rhine toward the work we
were doing. Let me repeat, when he was present, I could pro
duce better results with the ESP cards by taking them tele-
pathically from his mind.
In order to produce good results in trance and in other
forms of supernormal sensing, it is also, according to my
experience, necessary to have such a stimulation that is due
either to the energy which radiates or emanates from the object,
or from the interest, sympathy or desire of the individuals who
take part with me in an experiment.
I say this, convinced that no serious experiment or good
work to further such research can take place, without an
ardent desire on the part of the experimentors or workers to
achieve positive results. Affirmation, faith and desire, are the
energy stimulus needed to produce results, in science as well
as in art and life. I know that in making this statement I
am speaking of a subject which has rarely been recognised as
of serious importance in the development of Psychic research.
But I am convinced that many an investigator has confused
a negative attitude toward an experiment with objectivity, and
has thereby closed the doors on the necessary energy stimulus
needed by the sensitive, engaged for the experiment in super
normal sensing.
I again summarize why, from my point of view, it was
difficult for me to read Dr. Rhine's ESP cards: It was due to
three things; first, that I cannot do true clairvoyance sud
denly to order; secondly, that for me, the symbols on the
cards, gave me no definite energy stimulus in the form of
radiation; and thirdly, that if I did catch images and move

ments from the cards clairvoyantly, they concerned, as in the
case of the new watch, those people who perhaps had pro
duced or designed the cards or places where they were made,
or the substance from which they were manufactured. All
this, according to my own knowledge of the subject, would
have been true clairvoyant data in the experiment, even if it
were not the information which Dr. Rhine was at that
moment seeking; all he was asking me to do was to sense
the symbols on the cards.
While I was at Duke University, I also did some experi
ments with Dr. Rhine in the reading of handwriting. For
this purpose he prepared a series of uniform envelopes. Within
each had been placed a fragment of handwriting, perhaps a
word or a phrase of a particular person. This had been
carefully wrapped in many coverings and then well sealed in
the envelope. As a test, Dr. Rhine expected me to take these
envelopes in turn and by means of what he considered
psychometry, give replies with each envelope of handwriting
to a series of questions concerning the sex and age of the
individual, whether married or unmarried, the colour of his
or her eyes and hair and so forth.
From my own experience, the excessive covering over
of the handwriting precluded my use of psychometry and
made it necessary for me to use clairvoyance instead. The
handwriting itself does not give me the impression; though if
I perceived the handwriting I would certainly get impressions
from it. The thing that I tried to sense in holding the
envelope was the radiation of the writer's personality left there
by him.
This experiment was, from my point of view, another
effort to force supernormal sensing into especially selected
and quite arbitrary channels, in order to answer certain specific
and quite limited questions. I could get very little by this
method of attempting to regulate my own clairvoyance. For
if I placed myself in a truly psychic state, to be clairvoyant
about a given envelope which contained a scrap of hand
writing I might happen to get some information in clairvoyant

images (as in the case of the new watch) about the author of
the handwriting or about any number of other aspects of
that piece of handwriting history. To explain more specifi
cally why I might not be able to get the required information
to answer these questions, I might sometimes perceive the
image of the one who prepared the envelope of handwriting
for the test, or he who had last handled it, instead of the
person whose handwriting was on the paper inside. All these
contributing factors lead to a bewildering and complicated
series of clairvoyant images which make it quite impossible,
from my point of view, to study or estimate clairvoyance
by means of such an arbitrary technique.
Supernormal sensing, whether for pure clairvoyance,
psychometry or telepathy may, to a degree I know, be focused
and consciously helped by my own control so as to become
either consciously active or consciously closed. But I have
already explained the vital importance of an energy stimulus
which works spontaneously to create a psychic state in which
I am able to be clairvoyant. All that I have said about the
impossibility of becoming clairvoyant to order, concerning a
pack of ESP cards, applies also to becoming arbitrarily clair
voyant about a questionnaire concerning an individual whose
handwriting I happen to hold encased in an envelope.
I cannot say that I consider that I worked from psychic
levels when I told cards for Dr. Rhine, or answered a ques
tionnaire about the life of an individual whose small scrap of
handwriting lay in an envelope before me. I made myself
give answers to both types of questioning, in these tests of
clairvoyance and telepathy at Duke. But according to my
knowledge of the processes of clairvoyance and telepathy, I
merely guessed.
The result of further experiments I made with Dr.
Rhine, while I was in a trance state have been published; he
had spent little time on the study of the nature of the
control personality in trance and so could, therefore, give me
little help on this subject.

Whilst I had been delighted and interested to work with
this university teacher in the terms of his own experiments,
I did not find that he had any answers to certain vital problems
which still concerned me. I was still searching for answers
to the mystery of the mechanisms of my supernormal powers,
and the meaning of my trance mediumship.
Supernormal sensing is not subject, so far, to the same
laws as our rationalized thinking. Supernormal perceptions,
as I have experienced them, are not limited by either time or
space. Science, it is true, has not yet been able to discover
the laws by which the mind is able to work telepathically or
clairvoyantly. But I believe that the time is not far distant
when research may be able to both measure and photograph
those human energies by which supernormal sensing occurs.

Chapter XXXVII
ANALYSIS UNDER HYPNOSIS AND OTHER
EXPERIMENTS GIVE ME FURTHER CONTROL OVER
MY SUPERNORMAL POWERS
opportunity for further research was ready for me to
undertake. Dr. William Brown, the well-known English
psychiatrist, who founded the experimental laboratory of
psychology at Oxford University wanted me to begin a new
type of research into the nature and mechanism of trance.
He had, the year previously, tried a few trance experiments
with me, in which he communicated with the Uvani per
sonality; following this he made one attempt at hypnotising
me and again succeeded in reaching Uvani under that condi
tion. This led Dr. Brown to propose a new type of experi
ment; he suggested that if I would be willing, he would like
to make a study of multiple personality, analysing me under
hypnosis. This was not the first time that such a proposal
had been made to me by psychiatrists and analysts, but I now
felt ready for the first time, to seriously undertake such an
experiment. I had reached a point through my own investi
gation of the processes of my trance, where I welcomed the
prospect of any further light which analysis might give me
on the nature of my own mediumship; I also hoped that it
return to England in 1934 for the summer, an

would offer an objective method of testing the reality or
non-reality of the control personalities.
I made it clear to Dr. Brown that I was fully aware of
the psychiatric viewpoint towards the nature of trance, that
it was a form of neurotic escape, and that I knew that it was
regarded by psychiatrists and others as a disassociation of the
personality; I was also conscious that any psychiatrist attempt
ing to analyze me, whether he did it with or without hypnosis,
would be searching for the fundamental cause of my dis
association in some shock or fear in early childhood. I declared
that I was willing to cooperate with him in this analysis,
and was quite prepared to risk the loss of the trance con
dition and the possible disappearance of the controls, should
these prove to be no more than "a disassociation of my own
personality."
I was advised by some of the serious investigators in
psychic research, not to undergo these experiments with Dr.
Brown for fear that it would lead to a disruption of my trance
accomplishment. But I welcomed this opportunity. In addi
tion to my previous doubts and disappointments in arriving at
any clear understanding of these psychic states, I also continued
to wonder whether the physicians were correct who had so
often suggested that my trance mediumship was a contributing
factor to my constant ill health.
While I underwent analysis, Dr. Brown's assistant recorded
my galvanic reflexes. I had less than a dozen appointments
with him. In the first session he asked me to recall while still
in my waking state, whatever memories I could of my child
hood; the rest of the work took place while I was under
hypnosis; but it is important to note that Dr. Brown never
reached the controls by this method. So at the last appoint
ment before he went on a holiday, he asked me to go into
trance. When I awoke, Dr. Brown told me that he had, on
this occasion, spoken with Uvani.
There were no further sessions. Although I had gained
at that time no further understanding of my own medium-
ship, I did, however, soon prove to myself that a new mastery

of my supernormal functioning had become mine. This was
important and unforeseen. Now I developed the ability, in
the course of the following months, to penetrate those levels
of consciousness from which the controls had drawn their
supernormal knowledge.
This came about, as a result of my careful study and
contemplation of the method by which Dr. Brown had been
able to make me recall on awakening exactly what I had said
in hypnotic sleep. I felt certain that I could apply to myself
the same principle of hypnotic suggestion as Dr. Brown had
used on me. I also came to the conclusion that if I had been
able to speak under hypnotic control, I could also write to
myself in that state. I therefore experimented for a number
of months in developing automatic writing under auto-sug
gestion. I believed that if I began to give myself the neces
sary suggestion, before going into trance, I would then not
only be able to penetrate those other levels of consciousness,
familiar to controls but that my automatic writing would
reveal facts about the levels visited.
It is necessary to explain for those unfamiliar with the
mechanisms of mediumship, that up to the time of this analysis
with Dr. Brown, all my trance utterances seemed, from what
had been reported to me, to be transmitted either through
the controls (Uvani, etc.) or some other specific trance per
sonalities. But never at any time had I been able to accept
the existence of the individuality of any so-called trance
personality who claimed to communicate through me; though
I had accepted as genuine the information drawn from those
other levels of consciousness, through which these control
personalities seemed to work. This had, therefore, left me in
the somewhat paradoxical position of doubting the reality of
the controls, while recognizing the validity of the source from
which they drew their supernormal knowledge.
Automatic writing is at present a little-understood and
much-misused process. What is claimed to be derived by this
method from supernormal sources, may often be no more
than an expression of the unconscious conflicts and desires

of the human writer who produces these scripts. But even
though many of the scripts are the result of subconscious
conflict and self-delusion, there are a small number which
deserve objective checking. I regard my own experiments
with automatic writing made at this time through auto-sug
gestion, as of no importance to anyone but myself. And I
only refer to them because they played an important part
in beginning to free me from further dependence on the
control personalities in my supernormal development.
My automatic writings dealt not only with the subject
of my immediate life, but also with what seemed to relate to
possible previous states of consciousness. Some of this material
was undoubtedly drawn from my subconscious, but a great
part of it, I am convinced, came from areas of the
superconscious.
How then did I, during this experience, come to distin
guish between the levels of the subconscious and super-
conscious mind? The subconscious, I recognized in both pic
ture and symbol as representing the conflicts of my daily
life; but beyond this level, I discovered still other areas which
needed to be explored. I came gradually to understand that
I was drawing from a less personal and more extended area
which reached beyond the limits of the experience of the
subconscious. In it, I found vivid pictures of distant and
unknown places and people, fragments of strange music, rare
colours and unfamiliar languages. These experiences were
quite unrelated to those (subconscious) dreams of the con
flicts and problems of daily living; with such dream symbols,
I have always been able to deal, interpreting them quite easily
for myself. But in these more profound and unknown scenes
I came to realise that I was drawing upon areas beyond those
related to either my waking or subconscious states. I could
only explain my deep sense of connection with such remote
but nevertheless soul-stirring experiences, as due either to their
association with possible other lives I had lived; or with race
memories. Penetration of these supernormal areas made me
aware of a consciousness greater than anything I had ever before

conceived. A sense of supreme awareness pervaded me; it was
a state in which I was permitted to participate and receive
knowledge from some ultimate source beyond the limits of
personal being.
The controls had not been dissipated by means of the
analysis under hypnosis, nor had any new interpretation of
their meaning come to me during my work with Dr. Brown.
No scientist, I had to admit, had yet been found to interpret
the real meaning of trance communication. Again I began to
wonder whether the whole structure of mediumship might
not depend on a form of telepathy and whether the medium
does not draw information for communications, from the
subconscious mind of the sitter.
Back in America for the third time, I spoke to one of
the greatest living scientists about the impasse of my investi
gations of trance mediumship. Not only was he expert in
his own field, but he possessed a more comprehensive under
standing and knowledge of supernormal phenomena and the
laws which govern them than anyone I have ever known.
He suggested that if I wanted to penetrate more deeply into
the problem of my own mediumship, I should find a way to
have an objective investigation made of the controls; to do this,
he suggested that I get some doctor with the proper training,
to make a study of the physiological states which registered
while I was in and out of trance, so that science might begin
to learn what a psychic state really is. This suggestion inter
ested me deeply, and gave me a new line of approach, by
which a serious study of the controls and the trance state
might at last be made.
It was not long before I found that the doctor who had
looked after my general health, had sufficient training to
make these physiological tests for me. He made a series of
these experiments, first on me in the waking state, and then
on the alleged controls, when I was in trance. Unfortunately,
these physiological tests were left incomplete, and were done

too inaccurately to allow any scientific deductions to be drawn
from them.
Another experiment along similar lines was undertaken
on my return to London. Very little time was given to it
by the investigators; only three tests of physiological reactions
were recorded. From these few experiments made upon the
alleged controls and myself, a report was then made, stating
that no difference was evident between the responses I
exhibited in the waking and the trance states. I remained
convinced, however, that in spite of the fact that this report
was negative, the physiological investigation of trance medium-
ship, thoroughly and objectively studied by trained researchers,
would reveal interesting and useful data to the human race;
for I have not forgotten that it was one of the greatest sci
entists of our day, who proposed this experimental method
of the physiological investigation of the control personalities
and myself.
I did another piece of research that summer in England;
this was a repetition of the type of work that Dr. Rhine had
been doing with the cards in Extra-Sensory Perception. In
going into this second experiment to test clairvoyance and
telepathy with the ESP cards, I knew that my work would be
limited by the nature of the cards just as in the previous
experiments at Duke University. But I asked a friend of
mine, who was well acquainted with the range of my psychic
work, to visit, if possible, one of these London experiments.
I wanted the verification of my own reactions to this type of
work before I closed the door on it as a possible means of study.
She received an invitation from the investigator to take
part in one of the ESP card experiments. I made no comment
to my friend, either before or after the experiment, as to my
own attitude toward these card tests. When that day's work
was over, we left the laboratory together, and her first
remark to me was that I had seemed to show no signs of
working psychically at any time during the ESP card tests
for clairvoyance. I agreed with her comment, for I knew that
while reading these ESP cards in London, I had not been in

a psychic state. I had again, as at Duke University, made a
sincere effort, while experimenting with these cards, to apply
my own powers of clairvoyance and telepathy. But for the
same reasons I have previously given, about dealing with Dr.
Rhine's tests of clairvoyance and telepathy, with these identical
ESP cards, I could not become psychic over their symbols.
Consequently, I was forced to give my answers by what I
consider a process of guessing, quite unrelated to either
clairvoyance or telepathy; I was therefore, not surprised to
hear that the results of my ESP card tests in London, were
entirely negative.
After these experiments were over, a friend recalled to me
that in a trance communication received by him, some
months before I started the English experiments, he had been
told by the control that my work in the coming summer in
England would contain nothing but negative results. The
control sent this message to me through this friend, advising
me not to work at all that summer, because I had as yet,
recovered very little vitality from a previous serious illness.
Since I have however, never taken the advice or the opinions
of the controls seriously, concerning my own life, I brushed
this suggestion aside, and in spite of ill health I tried to do
a great deal of experimental work that summer. In retrospect
I must, in candour admit, that whatever Force gave me that
advice, the prediction, as well as the advice that it offered,
was more than justified by the lack of success in the work of
that year.
I have often been asked to explain how I regard the advice
and suggestions given by my own controls for my benefit.
Again I repeat I have never been willing to accept entirely, the
reality of these controls as personalities, but I do accept the
authenticity of certain knowledge I receive supernormally
through them. I have always regarded the direction of my
own life as my responsibility and have never felt therefore
any need of external help or advice. I have been fortunate
enough to have always been aware of a very definite power

within myself upon which I am able to draw when neces
sary for help either for myself or others.
By means of this finer sensing which scarcely seems super
normal since it has been so much a part of me since earliest
childhood, I have always been able to reach out for what
ever knowledge I might need for myself or for those who
are close to me. I have regarded this power as a sacred
responsibility and trust and I allow no personal experience
or opinion of others to interfere with its true functioning.
As I have developed more ease in reaching out consciously to
those areas, regarded by some as subconscious and by others
as superconscious, I have come to wonder whether the so-called
control personalities as well as I, in my waking state, do not
draw from the self-same extraneous source of knowledge and
understanding, though in somewhat different ways.
The attitude of medicine and psychology towards those
who have any form of mediumship or special sensitivities is to
place them in the category of neurotics, hysterics or even
schizophrenics, and then consider that this has finally classified
and disposed of them. But as I have suggested in tracing the
phases of my own research with a number of well-known and
experienced investigators, none of them was able to throw any
new light for me on the nature and mechanisms of my medium-
ship and I was always, in each step, forced to re-examine it
for myself. And I feel bound to state, not in a desire to
defend mediumship in general but in order to clear myself
from these false appellations of abnormality, that I do not
find that I show any signs of being either neurotic or hysterical
in any of my adjustments to life. Rather would I say that
I find myself more sane, more objective and more practical
in coping with life, than are many of the non-mediumistic
people I meet in my social and professional existence. And I
must add that whatever disturbances of ill health have been
mine, are primarily not due to my mediumship, but to an
extremely poor constitution, a family inheritance. My inves
tigations of the phenomena of mediumship convince me that
these are not new or extraneous sensitivities but rather refine

Chapter XXXVIII
MEDIUMSHIP AND OTHER SUPERNORMAL
PERCEPTIONS AS I HAVE COME TO KNOW THEM
A T the end of the summer of 1937 I asked myself what
new understanding of my own supernormal powers I had
gained by submitting myself for some years to arduous and
objective research under the direction of a number of rec
ognised medical men and university professors, in both the
United States and England. These men included many rec
ognised leaders in the field of psychiatry and internal medicine,
as well as biology and psychology. Every part of my anatomy
had been examined at one time or another by the various
specialists and researchers who made these experiments. X-rays
and fluoroscopes, galvanometers and cardiographs were used.
All my sense organs were tested, my blood, heart, chest, throat,
nose and various internal organs were examined. Some of these
tests were made while I was in and out of trance. Others
were made under hypnosis as well as in a waking state. Rec
ords were made of my physical, mental and emotional reactions
in trance and under hypnosis, as well as in my normal waking
states.
And what light, I now asked myself, had all this scien
tific research at the end of seven years, thrown upon the nature
and mechanism of my supernormal functioning? In terms of
the reports and investigations of the doctors and the profes

sors I would answer that the experiments showed meagre
results and no illuminating conclusions as to the nature of my
supernormal powers. But in terms of the understanding of my
own supernormal powers, I came to the conclusion that I had
really learned a great deal for myself about how to function
consciously in telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition. I
had also made some interesting discoveries about the workings
of my mental mediumship and I had come to certain conclu
sions about the nature of physical mediumship. Each experi
ment I had gone through had forced me to re-examine the
way in which I worked supernormally, and showed me why I
could not accept as valid, certain of the scientific techniques
which were used as a means of testing or investigating my
supernormal powers.
I know now that most of these workers were not looking
for the answers to what I consider the basic questions con
cerning supernormal phenomena. And until Science comes
to grips with the way in which clairvoyance, clairaudience,
precognition and physical and mental mediumship operate,
nothing revealing and conclusive will be realised.
Among the scientists who did research with me, I was
aware of two fundamental attitudes; a minority was interested
in a personal approach to my mediumship as a means of
gaining knowledge and information to be applied to their
own life and work. Such investigators would, if questioned,
certainly deny any private interest or confidence in this prac
tical aspect of my work. The records of such research, in
which the investigators were personally concerned will, I am
certain, in consequence of their emotional identification with
the subject matter, never be published.
The attitude, however, of the majority of the scientists
who worked with me was of another order. They considered
themselves objective and open-minded, but they met the
investigation of mediumship and other supernormal phenomena
with an attitude of negation. While I have always welcomed
the skepticism and detachment of the scientific observers . who
have worked with me, I have come to believe that this

personally negative, instead of a positive, objectively critical
approach, may interfere with the detached procedure of pure
research.
Amongst the many scientists I have known there has
been only one who combined with exceptional scientific train
ing, a genuine psychic power of his own, and a profound
understanding of how it functioned. Perhaps without such
knowledge, the scientist who attempts research into super
normal phenomena will never be able to develop an adequate
technique for . its investigation. And without this funda
mental comprehension of the nature of psychic processes in
his own being, the researcher will constantly be assailed by
fear and doubt and thereby negate and destroy his own
research.
But this state of fear and negation is in many men;
they dread change and resist any pressure which draws them
away from familiar paths to those less known. Man clings
to what he hopes will remain the security of an ancient
pattern, rather than risk the untried forms of the new.
Only some terrific shock or crisis forces the mass of men
to break from their age-old habit and tradition. When
negation rises up in the garb of fear and insecurity, it turns
the herd . of men against the few who serve as advance
guard to open new pathways for those who follow.
We see this same struggle taking place today, in educa
tion and government as well as in medicine, physics and
biology, against the new implications of greater personal free
dom and wider social responsibility for all men. Such changes
are resisted because the old order has served in the past.
As I grew in the understanding of the development of my
own mediumship I knew that my psychic capacities had
actually begun to develop in my early childhood. What I
then called my first sensing and seeing of movements, of light,
sound and colour were an important aspect of the growth of
my supernormal powers. When I first became aware of these
nebulous surrounds of all living organisms, I began to study

them and discovered that they appeared to contract and
expand, as though breathing with an "outer lung." I also
perceived at that time, and have ever since, been aware
that light and colour and odour were given to flowers, as
they breathed inward gently, by means of their surround.
Since my earliest youth, I observed these surrounds or auras of
all animals, plants and man, working on this same principle
of a gentle exterior inhalation and exhalation.
Not only did I become aware of this process of breathing
which took place in the surrounds of the living organisms
I studied, but I also made certain discoveries about the rhythm
of my own breathing. This became very important to me
in later life; I could consciously shift my way of breathing
when I wished, to change from one psychic state to another.
I mention the control of the tempos of breathing because it
plays a vital part in all of my supernormal work. Few
people are aware that there is always this intimate connection
between the way in which I breathe and the kind of psychic
state I wish to induce. This applies not only to my conscious
movement into trance, but also to my power of shifting at
will into the clairvoyant, the clairaudient or the precognitive
state. Each state requires a different tempo of breathing.
If this principle of controlled breathing were more clearly
understood by those who are sensitives they might thereby
help to regulate their own psychic state, and avoid much of
the hysteria usually associated with the preliminary stages of
mediumistic development. Hypersensitivity is an inevitable
part of the psychic nature, but it can be both controlled
and protected by the use of specialised breathing. And yet
this is a subject that I have never heard discussed by either
psychics or those researchers in the West who have been
concerned with studying the nature and mechanism of super
normal perceptions. No one showed me how to control my
breathing in this fashion. I believe that I first learned to
hold and change the rhythm of my breath in those early
days in my garden. Perhaps it was the awe and wonder at
these first childhood experiences of entering a whirling

world of light and movement, which caused a state of sudden
suspense, so breathless that I began thus to hold back my
breathing and so first change its normal rhythm.
I can still recall that in those youthful days I would
command myself and the flowers to be completely still. I
would remain suspended, almost without breath or motion,
so that I could enter into the rhythm and colour around me,
without missing a single sound or movement. Out of these
earliest experiences of sensing and seeing, began my habit of
giving myself either mental or vocal orders, which developed
into a conscious technique of applying auto-suggestion to
all aspects of my living. My later discovery of the use of
suggestion as a practical means of overcoming the difficulties
of existence may have been born out of living so much alone,
and of being so little understood by grownups that I was
forced to rely entirely on myself for direction.
Always this light and colour and odour I sense and see
have reached me in a state of incessant movement, going
either towards or away from the organism in the form of
active rays. Each type of living has for me its own particular
kind of radiation, whether it be a flower, an animal, a metal
or a stone. In man, the light and colour rays are more
condensed than are those of lower organisms.
In order to do supernormal sensing, I enter into the very
life of these rays of light and sound and colour and I use the
light rays as one might a telescope in order to see what lies
beyond and within the body protected by its own surround.
Then I seem to be able to sense the history of the organism
which rests within its own gently breathing envelope. But I
can only do this if I attach myself to the light and colour
rays which penetrate and emanate from the surround. That is
why I have emphasized the nature of this process which takes
place around the object as being one of some kind of radiation;
it is always on these shifting rays of light and colour that I
work whenever I do clairvoyance, telepathy or projection.
I am fully aware that my own trance, as I have shown
in the story of my early childhood, did begin as a means of

escape from a too painful aspect of living. The immediate
cause of all trance may well be, as psychiatrists claim, due
to some sudden shock or fear which causes a disassociation in
the psyche. But classifying trance as due to shock or fear
or a wish to evade some painful experience does not explain
either its fundamental nature or its function. It only describes
the immediate way in which it manifests. Scientific research
has not yet discovered the true nature of a trance state nor
been able to show how trance is able to penetrate areas beyond
the reach of the conscious mind in the waking state.
Most people regard trance as consisting simply of a
passive and sleeplike state. They do not realise that an active
as well as a passive principle is here at work. For trance
contains within it a double rhythm which I have come to
understand through my own experience. The passivity of the
trance acts as a mirror in which the images and thoughts of
its more active aspect are received. The active and passive
principle are so closely related as to bring forth and reflect
almost simultaneously; and both of these trance conditions,
the active and the passive, I know are stimulated by the cre
ative and glandular processes of the physical body. Trance
is mental, emotional and physiological and its true condition
still awaits more exact scientific investigation. Trance in its
duality of active and passive behaviour, responds according to
a fundamental law of our entire Universe; this principle of
being passive and active, negative and affirmative, links such
mediumship to the laws which govern the action of matter
and energy throughout space.
The role of the control personality
is,
I
believe after my
experiences and study, primarily that of interpreter of the
images constructed or discovered by the subconscious mind;
it
might also be but an aspect of this subconscious mind
which dramatises itself into
a
trance personality. On the
other hand,
is
it
not equally possible that the subconscious
mind
is
in itself but
a
channel which can reach out toward
other areas of superconsciousness, and draw from that illim

itable reservoir of the Universe, knowledge beyond the attain
ment of man's conscious state?
So far as I am able to judge, what I receive clairvoyantly
is in no way connected with my personal life and associations,
either conscious or subconscious. I know immediately when
this type of acceleration begins, and I am aware that without
its action I can make no claim to working supernormally.
Whenever my clairvoyant faculty is active, this produces a
stimulation, a sense of excitement, such as one feels on
entering some unknown and forbidden territory as a child.
The problem of dealing with the nature of clairvoyant
vision is very complex. It is regarded by most of the inves
tigators with whom I have done laboratory research, as a
form of extra-sensory perception. But when these scientists
are asked to define what "extra-sensory" perception
is,
they
usually describe
it
merely as
a
form of sensing outside of the
range of the five physical senses of man.
I
do not, from my own experience of clairvoyance, con
sider that this faculty
is
either an extra-sensory or abnormal
perception, but rather that
it
is
simply due to the intensifica
tion and refinement
of
the activity
of
the five senses,
of
touch,
taste, smell, sight and hearing, combined and carried to
a
higher
pitch
of
awareness than most people ever reach.
I
should like to give
a
concrete example from my own
experience, as to the way in which clairvoyance develops for
me as
I
intensify and raise my own state of consciousness.
I
might happen to be working clairvoyantly with
a
certain
investigator and suppose that
I
find myself suddenly projected
to the garden of this experimenter's home. There
I
become
aware perhaps of standing under an apple tree. Now all the
physical senses here come into play within the conditions
of
my
clairvoyant state, even though the clairvoyant sense still
predominates.
It
is
winter and
I
see the apple tree which
is
at that
moment stripped and bare. Then
I
am able also to see that
same apple tree in its different phases of seasonal change and
growth outside of that moment in time. Just which aspects

of the tree I may see, depends partly on my own focus, also
partly on circumstances beyond my control. I may glimpse
it first as a seed when planted or as a young tree not yet
ready to bear fruit. Or again I may perceive it in full
bloom and quite definitely smell the odour of its leaves and
blossoms. Or - I may get an impression of the tree, laden
down with apples and be able to describe the colour and size
of its fruit and anticipate their flavour to such an extent that
saliva gathers in my mouth. While I am in such a clairvoyant
state all this may take place in rapid sequence. It may concern
many periods of that apple tree's life, or I may only catch a
glimpse of the phase which is especially related at that
moment, to the life of the investigator with whom I am
working.
But in this example which I have chosen at random as
illustration, it is important to note that the physical senses
of sight, smell and taste are very much in evidence, though
they occur within the functioning of the clairvoyant state.
In my own experience, supernormal sensing is never "extra
sensory," but always includes within it the functioning of
the five physical senses.
Often in clairvoyant images I see a single person with
perhaps some part of a limb, or a facial feature, suddenly
emphasized and growing to a size and importance quite out
of relation and proportion to the rest of the figure I am
seeing. When this occurs I always know that there is pur
pose and meaning in this distortion. If it is presented in this
way, it is a method of drawing my attention to some par
ticular problem or event, for instance, on one occasion the
hand of a man I was seeing clairvoyantly increased to such
size that I could see clearly that it lacked a thumb, a signifi
cant disfigurement to the sitter. Once I saw the dimple on a
cheek of the dead wife of a certain man with whom I was
working, grow so large that it seemed to become a hole in
her face. The reason for this distortion appearing to me
became clear when the unnatural importance of that par

ticular dimple in the love relation of the husband and wife
was presently told me.
I do not know when and how clairvoyant vision begins,
any more than anyone can explain how their own sight begins;
but once it has commenced, I am able to increase its power and
intensify its action, by consciously accelerating my breathing. —
When clairvoyance does begin for me, a tingling sensation
passes through the body but seems to release itself through
my fingers and feet, the tip of my nose and other hyper
sensitive parts of my body; it is as though the clairvoyant
mood were cleansing the channels of the body to make room
for itself. As this happens I know also that my other senses
become sharpened and more acute and interact with the clair
voyant vision, enabling me to become increasingly aware of
sound, taste, smell, touch and sight.
My clairvoyant vision is always accompanied by its own
musical rhythm. It is as though the act of clairvoyance
produces, in my case, a sound chamber of its own. By this
I mean that while in the clairvoyant state I myself seem to
be contained within a sound box which, far from disturbing
me, creates an exhilaration in which I feel protected. Within
this contained area, I am aware of finer distinctions in tone
and volume and hear far more clearly the tones of a human
voice or of a musical instrument. At such a moment I am
able to be more keenly aware of divisions in the notes of a
tone of a voice or an instrument than of the words which
are sung, or the tune that is played. I am then also conscious
that there is a sense of separateness established between me and
the object or person of the experiment. A thick mist seems to
form which divides me from the subject with which I am
working. This misty veil or substance steadies my own move
ment and makes it possible for me to receive by means of its
reflective power, the thoughts, feelings and emotions con
nected with the object or person of the experiment. As
the clairvoyance grows, actual physical surroundings become
dimmed; also I am aware of a kind of expansion within
myself. I seem to be at the same time both within and

without my body, while drawing breath and vision from the
field surrounding it. In this condition of clairvoyance my
entire body seems to take on a visual perception, so that I am
able to see not only through the forehead but equally well
with the back of the head or the fingers, and sometimes the
whole surface of the skin becomes both an all-seeing eye and
an all-hearing ear.
In my own experience I cannot easily draw a satisfactory
distinction between clairaudience and clairvoyance so as to
clearly explain exactly where clairvoyance leaves off and
clairaudience begins. I know that both these types of per
ception are usually classified as "extra-sensory," but I never
find them functioning except with the other senses; again
I emphasize this belief of mine based on experience that all
of our physical senses are included in an intensified or refined
form, within the functioning of clairvoyance and clairaudience.
The question of the nature of the images received in
clairvoyance, their method of reception and their gradual
building up or translation by man into words, is still a vast
province to be objectively explored, and investigated. In order
to estimate the role of the image-making process in clair
voyance, would it not be interesting to discover what propor
tion of so-called normal people, receive their ordinary impres
sions in every day life in the form of images or pictures?
This must indeed be a universal experience, for man's first
attempts to communicate with others by means of writing,
were always in terms of picture language.
I have previously spoken of receiving clairvoyant impres
sions as images and then having to interpret their meaning in
relation to the circumstances or people they impinge upon.
From earliest childhood I have been aware of fundamental
symbols which I seemed to be compelled to draw. When I
went to school I found these images were closely linked with
the shape of the printed alphabet. To me the letters also
became associated with and identified with types of people
and their characters; this grew into what might be called
my personal picture-language and when I later came to use

clairvoyance I found that these same symbols presented them
selves to me always associated with certain types and tempera
ments. I have now what is an almost infallible sign language
for me which makes the classification of all the people I
meet and work with a clear and simple matter.
In the every day exchange between people there
is,
under
ordinary circumstances, stimulation of the activity of the
heart, the movement of the blood and the action of brain
responses taking place. But when communication occurs
through "supernormal" sensing all these processes are, in my
case, distinctly speeded up; there
is
a
definite acceleration
of sensation, productive of
a
rise of temperature,
a
quickening
in the heart action and
a
swifter pulse. The normal processes
of thinking, sensing and seeing are accelerated and
a
changing
emotional state takes its place;
I
then become the recipient of
a
series of pictures, images and reflections which reach me
seemingly slower than through my other or "normal" senses.
When
I
am using clairvoyant vision
I
do not look out at the
object, as in ordinary sight, but
I
draw the object towards me
and enter into its very life essence, becoming for that moment
a
part of it.
So definitely
is
this an experience which impinges on one's
physical body from outside, that when such an experiment
is
over,
it
is
difficult,
if
not impossible, to remember any part
of the experience —even
a
single word spoken. The effects
of "supernormal" sensing are very different from what occurs
if
one sits down to think through
a
difficult problem for
one's self. The solution of the personal difficulty brings about
a
certain strain and fatigue; but after "supernormal" sensing
there follows only
a
pleasant relaxation and stimulation, with
out any form of tiredness; there
is
for me no disturbance to
the mind, only
a
feeling of lightness, accord and rest.
I
have heard
it
said that in "supernormal" sensing, con
centration and meditation are necessary. But this seems con
trary to anything which
I
have learned from my own experi
ence in clairvoyance, telepathy and projection.

the process, are prerequisites to the production of such states.
A mood of what I like to call high carelessness, is the one
in which I obtain the best results. In fact I have found that
any conscious effort to think, feel, sense or see in the man
ner of meditation, makes impossible that accelerated movement
which I have found essential to "supernormal" perception.
J am now aware of seven levels of consciousness when I
work clairvoyantly. But it took me many years of self-
examination before I was able to analyze their differences.
Transition from one of these states to another is swift and
subtle. I can only describe these changes as they are known
to me. I have not met anyone who seemed aware of these
shifting levels which register certain physiological changes
during the process of clairvoyance. In the first state there
is an instinctive reaction which registers in the nerve centers
of the stomach, accompanied by an intense and primitive
desire. In the second state, I become aware of a movement
which sways upward and outward from the solar plexus and
then folds back towards the base of the spine. In that moment
a welling up of strength transforms the original primitive
desire into a pleasurable state of suspension and anticipation.
This third movement which follows the demanding activity
at the solar plexus, leads to an expansion of the torso and a
stimulation of the circulation of the breath throughout my
being; this change of tempo causes the spine to relax and
become flexible. The warm and pleasant sensations which
arise from the spine open up a distinct fourth level of con
sciousness; which leads to a clearing and expansion at the
back of the neck and this sensation continues to rise until it
reaches the skull and penetrates the brain.
In the fifth state, the space behind the forehead clears
and becomes suffused with soft light in which changing colours
play an important part and I actually enter into a dimension
which is colour. Accompanying this state comes a condition
of peace, free of all thought and connection with time, space
or events. This period of passive receptivity is followed in the
sixth state by a general acceleration and unification of all

five senses. Now the process of clairvoyance definitely begins
to function and coordinates and speeds up all sense perceptions.
In the beginning of clairvoyance the tiny space behind the
forehead, illumined by the glow of light, seems to grow and
expand beyond the measurement of time or space. The action
which then takes place can be related to an actual event of
today, an occurrence of tomorrow, or of an episode which was
lived a century or more ago. Likewise the actors in the scene
I see in that space behind the forehead may be people who are
now alive or those who lived in the distant past. Within this
moving panorama these figures are distinct, whether they be
large or small.
The seventh level of consciousness contains within it much
that I have so far found difficult to put into words. This final
level is no longer a part of the process, but is the attainment
of a new state of being. In that instant I become almost
simultaneously, more and yet less myself. It is at this moment
of the crescendo of my clairvoyance that precognition, clair-
audience, projection and vision-at-a-distance occur simul
taneously. In this state, I receive inspiration, and I become
one, am identified, with all life, which my vision beholds and my
wish embraces. On this level of consciousness I can reach out
and be aware at will of the cycle of life of any human being.
Had I not learned to control this power of perception to
protect myself from the impact of these experiences, such inten
sive sensing and receptivity might cause exhaustion. As my
body becomes increasingly exhilarated in this development of
the clairvoyant state, my mind grows more clear and quiet.
I know that clairvoyance and other "supernormal" sensi
tivities are not simply mental processes, since they work
through the emotional and physiological functions of. man
before they reach the mental state. When investigators classify
those who show psychic proclivities as "abnormal," they have
failed to recognize that "supernormal" functioning is rooted in
the normal and instinctive nature of man. Unfortunately, the
development of psychic sensitivity which may have begun
spontaneously, is sometimes forced unduly by those who are

eager to hurry the opening of their own powers. And this
may lead to a neurotic or unbalanced condition, which does
not occur when supernormal sensitivities are rightly handled.
Others who have begun to develop, sometimes misuse this new
capacity in a desire for selfish purposes, to gain either money,
attention or power.
The foundation of such powers as clairvoyance and telep
athy are, I am convinced, not abnormal, but natural to all
human beings; they are simply the result of the development
of our physical senses and are the instinctive products of man's
gradual evolution. I know this to be true, not only from my
own experience, but from my knowledge of people from all
parts of the world, whom I have met, types which have
oriented themselves to a normal and practical existence but
who happened to develop some aspects of "supernormal" sens
ing, which helped them to enlarge either their personal or pro
fessional life. A number of such people whom I met have
been interested in archeological or anthropological research, and
have admitted to me that they found themselves possessed of
faculties which enabled them to perceive the inward nature
of whatever objects they were investigating. Sometimes, such
individuals, through their supernormal sensing, were able,
unexpectedly, to analyze the unknown history of some pre
historic relic, or to uncover the technique of some lost colour
process or the secret of some ancient glaze. Others have told
me that they succeeded in restoring lost modes of early music,
forgotten religious ritual and buried forms of ancient speech,
hidden within some fragments of the past. Such recognitions
of the history of man's evolution in music, art, language and
archeology were not vague ideas of untrained individuals; they
were statements made by men and women thoroughly versed
in their chosen professions, who accepted the validity of such
experiences of sensing or "supernormal" identifying of an old
record, only when careful scientific research had corroborated
the data of their "supernormal" perceptions.
What explanation has modern psychology to offer for such
phenomena? It tends to reject the validity of such claims as

those which I have just cited as paranormal; and it prefers
to regard individuals who claim ability to recover ancient
knowledge through "supernormal" sensing, as either neurotic
or unbalanced. But psychology will finally be obliged to
envisage the human psyche in its comprehensive relation to both
time and space. When that time comes, the present concept
of memory and consciousness will have to be revised so as to
include the superconscious as well as the subconscious areas
in man.
Instinctive awareness which I find as the base of all super
normal sensing, is not confined to man alone, for it also
directs the behaviour of all other living organisms. Intuitive
perception is that activating principle in the life of both
man and animal, which preserves them against the hostile
forces of their own environment. This alertness, or hyper
sensitivity, in all living creatures, is created by the fundamental
synthesis of their five senses registering within the physical
body; such instinctive vigilance is the foundation of all true
self-protection, which means survival. "Supernormal" sensing
is really nothing, therefore, but a refinement of that dynamic
power which propels all life through its own incessant growth
and evolution.
I have already spoken of the way the development and use
of my own supernormal perceptions is related to the control of
my breathing. All athletic trainers and teachers of singing are
aware of the vital importance of breath in regulating the bal
ance between movement and equilibrium. Born athletes, dancers
and skaters not only possess an instinctively perfect coordination
of the body, but also an unconsciously perfect correlation of
their breathing with their movements. I emphasize this, in
order to draw attention to the fact that the instinctive athlete
or dancer is born with such natural coordination, now rare in
man, but still common to all animals. Man has forgotten that
rhythmic coordination of movement and breath was once his
natural heritage. He has lost his birthright, but he can remem
ber how to retrain this instinctive capacity for his own use.
And so today, for success in sports or dance or song, man

submits to a careful discipline in order to correlate his sense
responses with bodily control.
From my own efforts to regulate my supernormal states,
I know the importance of the exact use of breath in harmoniz
ing the coordination of the body. The manner in which the
psychic uses his special sensitivities is closely allied to the way
in which the athlete, when alert for action, uses his physical
senses. And by a careful study of my own breathing processes,
I have discovered that I control my supernormal states in exactly
the same way as an athlete or dancer controls his body.
The importance of the process of breathing as an aspect
of supernormal phenomena is not yet recognised by the West.
But the East has long understood its significance and use in
both the instruction of Yoga and the ritual of the dance.
In ancient times it was known to teachers, leaders and
many others that inspiration was the power which linked man
with the Supreme Forces of the Universe. When this power
of true communication with the Highest was lost to man, he
not only forgot the method by which he had reached those
states, but also the memory of this inspiration; what remains
to him of this inspiration, man still reveres in his Sacred Scrip
tures as the living Word of God.

Chapter XXXIX
MY OWN CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING RADIATION,
MIND AND CLAIRVOYANCE
S I have grown more familiar in recent years, with the
functioning of the body and the mind, I have come to
know the surround as a magnetic field; and since this seems to
be a more adequate term than either aura or surround, I shall
continue to use it. While such a field envelops the physical
body, it also encompasses in it a nebulous and mist-like forma
tion around the body which seems to breathe at a higher
vibration than the body to which it belongs. I also see this
field acting as a life-giving and protective mechanism to the
chemistry of the body. Although the magnetic field consists of
substance similar to that of the body, it draws its strength as
far as I can observe from the carbonic gas as well as from other
elements of the body. These substances, when released from
the physical organism, appear to come into contact with the
atmosphere and form therewith a closely woven, though fragile
and cob-web-like stuff which always surrounds the body.
This magnetic field plays the role of the condenser of all
experience which enters the physical body from without; it is
capable of sifting through its mesh-like substance all atmospheric
radiations of light, sound, colour and movement. This makes
the magnetic field surrounding each human organism the
receptor and reflector of all "supernormal" as well as normal
perceptions which eventually reach the human organism.
When experience is received within the magnetic field

I see it as then passing through the body in a series of light
rays which move rhythmically in and out in a swift and con
tinuous succession. The field is able to participate in the
ceaseless changes of the physical body through an inner process,
whereby these light rays register, unfailingly, the design of
daily living throughout the physical, mental and other bodily
states of the human organism.
I always examine the condition of the magnetic field which
envelops the body of the person with whom I work clairvoy-
antly. It is by the state of this field that I am able, according
to its clarity and particular colours, to judge the degree of
physical, mental and emotional vitality and health of the
individual. Colour plays a most important part in signifying
the state of well being and emotional stress in the field of each
person.
I have often been able to trace within the magnetic field,
lines and breaks which tell me what specific disease or illness a
person has had. My analyses of such "scars" have been verified
on many occasions. To those who know its language of signs
and colours, man's magnetic field becomes a kind of map by
which the condition of body, mind and spirit is clearly dis
closed. So does this field play a decisive role in the development
of man's personality. I hope that Science will soon become
aware of the existence of the magnetic field as the diagnostic
chart of the state of man's entire being.
Since this magnetic field interpenetrates the physical body
and yet reaches out and exchanges with other energies in the
Universe, by means of radiation, man is thus closely linked with
all the forces at play upon the world, through the energy of
his mind, his emotion and his physical sensation. There is
actually no real separation between man and his mind, his
psyche and his body; these are but three aspects of man's being.
And I am convinced that the key to the interrelation of man's
three-fold nature lies in the scientific investigation of this
magnetic field which envelops his physical body.
When man perceives the range of powers within his grasp,
he eventually will understand the nature of his own field, and

then he will be able to reach out to the furthest realms of
thought and being. What are now regarded as the accidental
supernormal perceptions of the few, will gradually become the
widely accepted and more clearly understood powers of the
many. I do not state this as" a plea for developing supernormal
sensing in everybody; but were science to accept the actuality
of this field, after a period of objective investigation, it would
begin to alter its opinion concerning the nature of personality;
and what the world now calls supernormal would gradually be
accepted as the natural and normal condition of man.
I have described this magnetic field which I see enveloping
all human beings, as the receiving station in which man may
obtain images, impressions and sensations not only from other
people but from many parts of the Universe. These impressions
are simultaneously sifted by the responses of the mind which
accepts or rejects such impressions; they are received and trans
mitted by a form of radiation which is active throughout
nature.
The movement of this energy is not visible to ordinary
sight. In my own case I first see movement in colour and light;
the nature of this primary action taking place throughout
space is a rotating one; and out of it are born all my objective
clairvoyant perceptions. I am aware of heavy inchoate darkness,
before I begin to see form clairvoyantly. This darkness is
charged with pulsing, breathing, movement which bursts into
curving rays of light and colour. Some of these seem to split
from the original parent rays, and moving out, form them
selves into lines of light which proceed to develop an animated
four-fold movement. These vivid lines take on a swaying
rhythmic motion as they interlace in light spirals throughout
space. From these, more lines are continuously born which
tumble into place and create simple forms. Within such shapes
I am aware of energy forming into substance which is both
irridescent and seemingly gelatinous. Globules of colour emerge
from these light forms and contain, I believe, the original pat
tern and essence of all life.

This process occurs in a fraction of the time it takes me
to describe it. Nor does any such conscious analysis ever
accompany the activity of my seeing it. I mention it to
clarify the transitions which occur before the clairvoyant
sight is opened. At that moment I am able to see through,
around and beyond an object. Again, I repeat, I must be in a
state of easy relaxation, with no effort at concentration in
order that this clairvoyance may function, and any attempt to
force the vision simply limits its power.
I have described only what I directly perceive and know
to exist, although I cannot pretend to wholly understand what
takes place. I lack the scientific training to grasp what lies
behind such transformations of energy into light and light into
colour. Some of these changes, I am aware, are already known
to the physicist, but I am now merely attempting to describe
what I am able, through my own perceptions, to sense and see
clairvoyantly.
Mind, in the universal sense, I know to be without and
not within the human body. I am able to see the impressions
emanating from the outer universe register in the magnetic
field of all living organisms. As such ideas, sensations and
emotions reach man from without, they are, I recognize, received
by certain centres located within his own magnetic field; these
impressions are then passed on to register within the physical
body. From my own experience, I am prepared to state
that the brain of man registers and directs the activity of
only a limited part of the impressions of his own mind. For
the mind of man consists not only of the conscious and the
subconscious, but of the superconscious as well; and of these
three areas, the subconscious and the superconscious are, as I
sense and see them, located in the magnetic field; the con
scious mind simply registers within the body a limited pattern
of daily living.
To this conscious mind I attach little importance as com
pared to the subconscious or superconscious areas. For I
regard it merely as a temporary pattern of existence, played
upon and transformed by the other more powerful and more

important levels of consciousness. It is by means of the sub
conscious that man is linked to the experience and events
of the past, and through the superconscious that man attains,
or may attain, his own powers of vision and inspiration.
The area of the deep subconscious is, according to my
own understanding, the source from which is born both the
conscious and the underconscious mind. The underconscious,
I see acting between the conscious and the subconscious levels
and containing that part of the day's history which has not
yet been dealt with, and drawn up into the pattern of the
conscious mind.
Modern psychology has come, of late, to accept the
hypothesis of the subconscious as the area in which man's
buried wishes and forgotten experiences push through to the
conscious mind, in symbolic form and action. But no such
recognition has as yet been granted to the power and
importance of the superconscious mind.
The subconscious, I regard as containing the whole and
complete ego of man. But though the subconscious is com
plete and self-contained, as is the seed kernel from which a
perfect tree with trunk and branch and leaves will ultimately
spring forth, yet the fulfillment of the process and mechanics
of this experience depend on its interrelation and exchange
with its own superconscious. If the subconscious represents
the seed of the tree, the superconscious is as the leaf and rep
resents the external agent by which the tree of consciousness
lives and breathes.
In each phase of evolution all changes in states of con
sciousness become enveloped in an external form appropriate
to its degree of being. This transformation is evident in the
evolution of all life from plant to animal and then to man.
There is no reason to suppose that this process comes to a
stop at man's present phase of development. Higher states
of consciousness would inevitably evolve corresponding forms
of being. And this I know to be true from my own personal
experience of seeing and living in supernormal areas. Although
I penetrate these levels through the direction of mind and

the control of breath, I do so, with the accompaniment of a
swiftly vibrating magnetic field. The form of this field
although invisible to normal sight, is the body which accom
panies the functioning of superconsciousness in man. And
though mind can reach out into space through the radiation
of thought, each phase of consciousness is wrapped within
some form of vehicle, subtle and invisible though it may be,
which is appropriate to the state of evolution of its being.
I have described the steps by which I sought a funda
mental explanation of mediumship in my work with the
psychic researchers and the scientists. And when they had
all failed to present any form of interpretation of supernormal
functioning, I was forced to turn within myself and so seek
to discover a more profound understanding of the meaning
of mediumship. But before I give my own conclusions, I must,
however, briefly recall that psychiatry still estimates all aspects
of mediumship as abnormal states, in which all degrees of
dissociation, including trance, are regarded as neurotic escapes
from reality.
While I am able to agree that some "dissociated" people
are neurotic, I cannot understand why this should condemn
all who manifest signs of dissociation, as necessarily abnormal
or unbalanced. It would be well to remember that every
normal person has also his moments of dissociation in day
dreams or phantasy, and that these are but minor expressions
of that same phenomenon which occurs in mediumistic states.
Where then is the dividing line between what is normal and
what is abnormal in dissociation? And how much phantasy
may an individual be permitted before he must be classified
as neurotic? This raises the interesting question of whether
artists and sensitives are "escaping from reality," either in
creating works of art or in mediumship. Or whether there
may not be, in the state of superconsciousness, a higher reality
from which the artist and the sensitive draw inspiration?
I have come now to a point in my own life, where I
am prepared to take a stand, and to state positively that super

consciousness is not a condition of illness and unbalance, but
rather one of vitality, harmony and completeness, a state of
realisation from which all the great creations and profound
illuminations of mankind have been derived. And when I
speak of superconsciousness, I refer to a state which I know
through all the manifestations of mediumship. Dissociation
has been considered as an abnormality and a source of destruc
tion to the life and personality of the individual; but in the
course of years, I have come to know that in my own states of
separation, whether in or out of trance, I can be constructive
and helpful to others as well as myself.
When I withdraw into the trance state, this neither tires
nor exhausts me; rather do I gain strength and deeper under
standing from the supernormal levels I then reach. When
open-minded and earnest people, free from the limitations of
a spiritualist faith, or any other fixed formula or belief, work
with me, they have often reported that constructive help in
healing, enlightenment and understanding, has been given to
them, during my trance. I have received so much proof of
the constructiveness of my trance states, for others as well as
myself, that however much trance may be interpreted, as a
means of escape from the problems of living, I am sure that
it is more than that, since it contains certain positive and
constructive elements of supreme importance to the growth
of man's personality. I therefore believe that much study
and investigation as to the nature of trance still lie ahead for
the scientific investigator.
Because trance mediumship is so little understood today,
I have given considerable attention to it here. Those unfamiliar
with the various expressions of mediumship, may not be aware
that both its mental and physical aspects manifest during
the trance state. But I do not intend to discuss at length the
nature of physical mediumship, because I regard it merely as
a further transformation of that same energy evident in mental
mediumship and in all other forms of supernormal phenomena.
In physical mediumship, I believe it is the wish of the
unconscious mind which directs the energy (without material

the air. If unconscious mind can so influence objects by
means of its energy, how much more effectively may conscious
mind, with its more clearly focussed power, cause the move
ment of objects and the activity of people at hand or at a
distance. I say this, knowing through my own experiments
that I am able, to influence the movements of objects and the
behaviour of people, without physical means. With the
direction of conscious mind, I can also score, at will, certain
numbers in a game of chance, with a frequency far beyond
the expectations of the law of probability. I can carry such
an experiment further and so control the mind of another
person who is playing the game of chance, as to produce what
ever number I have previously selected. By such results, I
have shown again and again, how conscious mind can control
physical phenomena; a proof that energy can be directed at
will, and that wish and desire do control physical action.
Surely such experiments invite further objective investigation.
Controlled experiments have been made, not only with
the control of objects as in the case of the games of chance,
but with the influencing of the behaviour of people at a dis
tance. I might cite a very simple example in my own
experience. When my daughter goes out, though I do not

about by my control of the radiations of energy sent out by
my mind either to the dice in a game of chance, or to the
mind of my own daughter. Such experiments, (of many,
many similar ones) prove to me that thought has the power
to move objects and influence people and events and to inter
fere with the predicted results of the law of probability.
These occurrences become significant to us when we recognize
that mind is here evincing the power to deflect the energy of
a destined event, before it takes place in time.
The power of thought, is therefore intimately connected
with the nature of time. We are in consequence obliged to
ask ourselves what is time, the laws of which can, under cer
tain conditions, be overcome by mind? Time is a product of
man's mentality. It is said to consist of past, present and
future. But these are but the limited mental categories man
creates for his own convenience, in attempting to focus his
own fluid existence within the limitless areas of space.
To me, as a sensitive, such divisions of time have no
significance. For the present is but the instant which lies
between the past and the future, and in that moment in
which we utter "now," it has already become a part of what
we call the past. Nor can we refer to these classifications of
time, as past, present and future, without necessarily relating
them to our changing states of consciousness, which move
both within and without time. For the present is as fleeting
and illusory as that ephemeral area of consciousness we call the
conscious mind. Conscious mind is then identical with that
temporary narrow strip of man's living where unconscious and
super conscious meet and blend. Such terms as "present time,"
and "conscious mind," are man's way of expressing that instant
of arrest and focus in his own awareness, occurring within
the limits of time and space, as he knows them. Such are the
confines of what man is wont to call "reality." A condition
limited to practical use, in his daily dealings within a three
dimensional world.
But man is surely more than a three dimensional being.

ing both the past, and the future; by turning back and
recalling his buried memories, he is able to recover the past;
and by projecting his thought forward he can learn to control
the future. Did man but comprehend the potential range of
his powers, he would be capable of reaching beyond time
to a state where past, present and future are one, and beyond
conscious mind to an area where the subconscious, the con
scious and superconscious are united. When man comes to
recognise such experience as his birthright, he will indeed be
able to live with himself at the same time in those states out
side of time, which are as yet little known or understood by
him.
I have often spoken of radiation as my own means of
contacting the world of outer events; especially do I use it
as a way of relating myself to that supernormal world of
which I am constantly aware. While the process of man's
own power of radiation is as yet so little understood or accepted
by Science, I am convinced that in the near future the
exploration of the magnetic field will prove that man is a liv
ing "world" or "sun" and that he is surrounded by a certain
nimbus, as are all light bodies; and it will also be discovered
that this field or nimbus which envelops his physical body
connects him and his consciousness with the mind of all other
forms of life, as well as with the greater Mind of the Universe.
With the growing knowledge of the science of light and colour,
man will be able to photograph the form of the magnetic
field which envelops him and every other living organism.
New precision instruments will soon be built to register
man's own radiation and its relationship to other types of
energy in the Universe. These will have to be more delicate
than any yet constructed, in order to catch the swiftly mov
ing emanations radiating from the body, as well as the brain
of man. Eventually, man will begin to discover that his own
body has within and without it, the answer to the meaning
of his existence on this earth and to the riddle of all these
other states of consciousness which baffle him today.

Although he is keenly aware of light and colour in the
world of which he is a part, man does not begin to recognize
that he also participates in the brilliant pageantry of nature's
ever-changing hues. This magnetic field in which he dwells,
can be likened to the shifting radiance of a rainbow. Unaware
of being folded within this ever-changing film of colours,
man covers his physical body with vivid clothes in order to
gratify his own need for colour. He has this deep need
although he is far from understanding that in the true science
of colour every shade and tone has a particular effect upon
the living organism.
Medicine has become more definitely aware of the thera
peutic importance of colour in various forms of treatment,
as it has also become more successful in the use of X-rays,
infra-red and ultra violet-rays. But there still remains much
to be discovered about the healing value of colour rays in
the research and experiment of the future. When the
unexplored possibilities of man's own radiation begin to
unfold, a new comprehension of the nature and functioning
of the human mind and consciousness, will be formulated, and
a wider use of the range of light and magnetic rays will be
developed by Science.
Healing on a scale undreamed of as yet by medicine or
psychology, will soon be made possible, when further knowl
edge of the nature and strength of the rays contained within
each body are charted and rightly directed. Then, will it be
more widely recognised that such fundamentally destructive
states of negation, as doubt, fear and insecurity are at the
root of man's physical ills. When at last he comes to
understand that he himself gives out those vital rays which
can either heal or destroy life, he will began to accept his
own responsibility and he will desire to learn to direct and
control his own radiations for the positive use of himself and
his fellow men.
Such self-knowledge could be increased and directed by
the right use of suggestion and auto-suggestion. There exists
today little understanding of the therapeutic and educational

use of suggestion in opening the potentialities which lie as
yet undeveloped within the personality of each human being.
Those who now use suggestion, evidence no serious recogni
tion of the complexity of the process, nor of the special
technique required for using it correctly. They will have to
become aware of the many levels of conscious and unconscious
mind, to be reached and dealt with in all human beings, before
they will be able to recondition the emotional and spiritual
forces of those who turn to them for help. I have observed
that those doctors, educators, parents and religious teachers
who attempt to use suggestion, whether they call it by that
name or not, usually insist upon a state of passivity or lack of
self-direction from those they treat. This is a mistake, for
although this method may result in quick and easy domination
of a person's mind and also produce a temporary improvement,
it can but lead to an increasing dependence and a loss of
initiative on the part of the patient. Only when suggestion
helps to liberate the powers of an individual and so gives
to him an understanding of how to apply auto-suggestion for
the growth of security and self-mastery, does it begin to ful
fill its promise as an healing art.
Most people are not yet aware, that in our daily life and
thought, we are continually releasing energy to form light
rays which will strike and "ground" somewhere. When man
recognises that he can direct the energies of mind, not only
in such mental forms as appear in telepathy and projection,
but also in a physical form that can influence and move mat
ter, he will then begin to understand that he has the ability
to challenge consciously the law of chance or probability.
Mind is the true force that creates all things in the
Universe. Just as the architect must image in his own mind
the building he will some day erect, so must mind in the
Universe, conceive all things before they can be born. First
comes the image or vision to the artist or creator and then
follows the realisation of the dream in a completed work of
art, or a world.

In the not far-<listant future people will become more
consciously aware of the tremendous power which is contained
in thought and of how it acts throughout the universe, inces
santly charging and recharging the current of our daily lives.
For let me repeat and emphasize, thought is an active force,
going forth from man's mind like a flash of lightning, which
strikes and affects other minds as it moves and travels through
space. It is so potent that it can make or mar us. If we
realised the inherent and compelling power of thought to
direct and control, or create and destroy, we would think
deeply and constructively before allowing ourselves to be
drawn into much of our useless living. Thought is the great
motivating power from which all desire stems. And desire
is the breath of the Infinite within all pulsing life. In the
world today there are signs that the profound nature of
thought is again beginning to be recognised, understood and
applied to our daily existence. If man comes at last to accept
through objective proof that mind can be transformed into
energy as well as energy become mind, he will soon be able
to understand the principle of supernormal sensing and all
else which takes place in the Universe. Great is this truth
and greater the man who truly perceives that spirit is the
strength of mankind and that thought is the monarch of the
world.

Chapter XXXX
WHERE I STAND AND
WHAT I BELIEVE TODAY
I AM now ready to explore new levels of objective research
made impossible by my lack of health in the past. For
a number of years, I have been aware of a healing power within
myself, but I knew that the time had not yet come when I
could rightly use it for myself or others. I was still at that
stage of my development where I questioned and negated
the positive aspects of my supernormal powers. But I was
sufficiently aware of the law, to know that I could not
accept the responsibility of these powers until I had been
able to heal myself by their means. I recognized that until
I could grow into a full acceptance of the use and responsi
bility of my own supernormal powers, I could not begin to
exact true satisfaction from my work.
I am now being asked where I stand today and what is
to be the direction of my future work. I find myself reluctant
to continue my activities as a professional medium, since I
have become convinced that it interferes with the objective
research to which I now desire to devote myself. I have
come to the conclusion that the spiritualist hypothesis alone
limits the freedom of such research; nor is the point of view
of most psychic researchers as yet sufficiently objective or

detached to penetrate into those new and unexplored areas of
the mind with which I now propose to experiment.
In order to do this, I must first return to that point
in my own development, where I allowed the spiritualist
interpretation of the trance state to be placed upon me as
the only true explanation of such a phenomenon. Such biased
use of trance, I am now convinced, limited, for me, the natural
functioning of many states of consciousness, which were
already making themselves apparent in my life. In recent
years, quite apart from my work as a trance medium, I have
been able to use these other aspects of consciousness in dealing
with myself and others; the effective use of such areas has
brought me to a deeper understanding of the laws governing
my own body and mind, and therefore I have also been able
to apply this realisation to the lives of others. In dealing with
these mental levels in myself, I have found the way into
certain areas not understood today, but which are certainly
related to the symbolic language and alphabets of the past.
Although I am aware that the symbolism of the unconscious
plays an important part in psychology today, this seems but
the beginning of a process which must go deeper into the
subconscious and also the superconscious areas of man's being.
This is one of the most important fields of research in which
I hope soon to take an active part.
I have grown increasingly aware of the way in which
thought can be employed to build up states of mind which
become as real and objective as three-dimensional material
reality. It may have been that in early childhood I created
these protective images which later dramatised themselves
into controls; but it is also possible that unconscious or racial
memories may have supplied the substance which filled the
controls with personality.
Through the years of my trance communications and
research, two control personalities, those mentioned previously
in this book, have always been identified with my work, and
they have never ceased to maintain their independent and
separate selves. It is interesting to note that they have

tae nature of their own being and the mechanisms of my
supernormal functioning; but up to the present any efforts to
dislodge them or to reduce them to aspects of my own con
sciousness have led to no change in their attitude, position,
or state of being. The control personalities still maintain the
roles they have always played in relation to me, since my trance
work began. I have reached that point in my development
where I can live in harmony with myself and at peace with
those so-called personalities, for I am now able to regard
them as the finer aspects of my true self. Whatever their
origin may be, I do not, at present, have at my command the
means of knowing; but for the time being, I am content
to accept the controls as aspects of a constructive principle
upon which my entire life has been built.
Since I believe that thought is the fundamental process
of creation and that nothing that has once manifested in this
world, is ever lost, it is possible that those who existed before
us, have stamped a living memory of themselves upon the
ether of our cosmos, and that such form may, through desire,
be vivified and drawn back, by those of us who have within
ourselves some special bond with that aspect of the past. All
my supernormal experiences convinced me, that the past,
present and future are but aspects of one continuous process
in the Universe. In such an evolution, birth and death fall
into place, as necessary phases of an eternally changing cycle
which strives towards the perfection of man's soul. One life,
is for a human being, a single fragment of his total experi
ence, and through such existence, man is bound by memory
and sensation to all living forms which have been and shall
be. For me, therefore, the state of death is no more than a
breathing spell, in which the soul which has passed out of
this life, may take time to extract the essence of that experi
ence before it enters into another phase of being. Death
therefore contains within itself a subtle preparation for that
new and unpredictable adventure, which, though man may,
as yet, be incapable of perceiving, lies most surely beyond

that state of realization which he knew of old, then truly will
he regain the power of the Spirit and the ultimate reunion
with his God.
