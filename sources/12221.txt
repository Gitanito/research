I lost consciousness several times. The steering wheel pushed me against the driverâ€™s seat. I had a series of broken ribs on both sides, a broken breastbone, and both ankles had been broken. I spent 8 weeks in intensive care.  During this time, I had one or two NDEs. I never knew if they belonged together or not. I'm writing both of them down. 
 
 The first experience was when my body was lying on the operating table. I had six or seven doctors and nurses around me.  Yet, I was standing in a corner of the surgery room and watched for about 20 seconds to see how they were operating on me. 
 
 I was weightless and slowly flying straight up. I was standing upright but not on a surface where I would have been able to stand. Surrounding me was an agreeable brightness that was white but not blinding.  I felt truly good. I didn't think. I just let everything happen and it was beautiful. After a short time, I saw a gray edge above me, which was slightly bent. I moved towards this edge and when I was there, I saw my deceased mother and her mother who was my grandmother. Their faces could be recognized through brighter or darker white and it was slightly fuzzy like looking through milk glass, yet nothing was between us. My mother reached out with her hand. 
 
 I knew that if I went through the door, I would be dead immediately, but that I would be in heaven. I stayed. After this, the NDE ended immediately. 
 
 In the second experience, my grandmother put her hand on my mother's shoulder.  Without talking but through 'thought transmission' we all knew immediately what was going happening.  Within tenths of a second, my grandmother 'communicated' to my mother, that I would be there soon.  Time seems to be different there because- a second can be decades or more.  I didn't take my mother's hand.  After that, the NDE ended immediately. 
 
 Nevertheless, in both cases, I had the choice. I could have left the operating room immediately and been in 'heaven'. 
 
 I could also have taken my mother's hand and would be there. 
 
 My life and my way of living changed after the accident and the NDEs. At the age of 35, I'm now a pensioner and there are many things that I cannot do anymore. 
 
 But the NDEs positively changed my life.  I'm much more serene than before. There are many things that I don't take as seriously. I'm doing a lot more thinking instead of doing something. I'm not afraid of death any more.  I rarely get upset.  I have much more respect for people, animals and plants.

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?       Yes     Difficulties are actually not so difficult, if in need you can let yourself get help. Challenges can be mastered. If you fail, then it is not so bad. Only those people that do not accept our social securities will experience hardship. The more, all three terms are not 'menacing' anymore, after the NDEs.

Were you compassionate prior to your experience?       Greatly compassionate toward others

During your experience, did you gain information about love?       Yes     There is an existence after death. I have seen my mother and grandmother, they passed on long ago, and yet they exist.

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?       Moderate changes in my life     I'm more serene, don't care so much about things, old virtues unessential; I'll rather see what the day will bring than plan everything thoroughly.  I am not hurried. I hardly get upset, as I know that after death there comes something more and 'there' is genuine kindness; being nice, calm are better virtues than cleanliness.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        Yes I am kinder, more serene, unhurried, I don't care waiting anymore, less excitement, according to the motto 'act in a way that your acting could be declared as a common law.'  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    The content of the experiences I will never forget, not even part of it, except maybe if I might get a dementia, for what I don't wish.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        The certainty that there is something more after death, and that I will see my deceased relatives again.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I shared my NDE with others. Before, I had no knowledge about them, so my NDE(s) could not have been influenced.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     It was real, because a dream is different with me, and this clarity and the knowledge during the NDE, and other factors, like the clear alertness cannot be unreal, so they have been real.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     I have been reading the book of Bernhard Jakoby 'We never die' and the book of Dr. Jeffrey Long 'Evidence of an Afterlife', and slowly the (taboo) topic NDE comes out into the public (TV), AND THAT IS VERY WELL SO!!! As many are not talking about it, because they don't want to be considered as mad.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       People, don't be scared of death!

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       Please inform ever and ever again that there is proof, that there is a life after death. You don't have to feel ashamed about an NDE - especially old people should get this information.
