  		            88.    Ricardo Grandfather NDE    3/25/1999.      Secondhand NDE 10064.     From Portugal      In that place there was a group of people who seemed to be waiting for him. They were all in white, and they all had a rosebud painted on the chest area of their garments.  It was a realistic depiction of a rosebud, with two leaves on either side of the stem.  One of those people came sliding up to my grandfather, holding in his hand one of those rosebuds.
  NDE from Portugal, shared by grandson. Powerful and profoundly meaningful imagery.   

    87.    Evelyn NDE    12/29/2001.      NDE 487.     From Denmark      The bright light had slowly transformed into a figure dressed in a white robe. Everybody became silent as the figure came towards me. The face of the figure was very bright, smiling and calm. I could even feel its warmth.
  NDE from Denmark associated with surgery.   

    86.    PJ NDE    12/16/2001.      NDE 480.           What strikes me as so real about this experience, even after all these years, is the comfort and peace of it, as well as the vivid colors and sharp details of a landscape that I ordinarily would take for granted.
  Two NDEs, both with visual perception of earthly events far removed from the body.   

    85.    Gina NDE    12/9/2011.      NDE 474.     From Canada      The next thing I knew, I was passing through a tunnel towards a very peaceful and beautiful bright light. I was met by moving forms that were pure energy. It was such a beautiful, loving place. I remember loving it there, and feeling astounded by the love that I was receiving. I reviewed my life, and I did the judging.
  NDE at age seventeen due to car accident.   

    84.    Jackie NDE    12/9/2001.      NDE 472.           I told her I floated up and saw all this happen...it really scared her and unnerved her... as my description of the situation (was) very accurate.
  NDE at age 7 due to intestinal bleeding. Accurate out of body perceptions.   

    83.    TO NDE    12/9/2001.      NDE 477.           Well, I didn't see a "white" light, but there was a wonderful, calming, warm, homey light that was a color I'd NEVER seen before. The only way I can describe it is a violet/white/blue fluorescent type color--but it was almost like a pool of color or presence (not a tunnel, really) that was radiating so tremendously. I WANTED to take it in...to go to it...
  NDE associated with black widow spider bite.   

    82.    Alan NDE    2/8/1999.      NDE 10049.           ... a bright beam of golden light washing away the blackness. Somehow, I'm struck in the chest by one of those beams. I feel no pain; but I fall down and can't move. Someone picks me up and lays me down on a table or bed. I'm asked if I want to go with them, or wait and get fixed-up.
  Unusual variant imagery following severe injury.  What is notable about NDE in general is that such variant imagery is so unusual.   

    81.    Jerome NDE    10/27/2001.      NDE 428.           The confirmation of personal continuity of identity was, by far, the most spectacular part of the experience. The realization that my thoughts of the moment had such an impact on my mental state outside the body was the ""worst""--but perhaps also very good in that I learned (I believe) what I must work on to ensure a fully positive experience when I depart from my body finally without any option to return.
  NDE from cardiac arrest. Interesting out-of-body perceptions.   

    80.    Kelly NDE    10/27/2001.      NDE 426.           The being was pure evil it was negative. I did not know the being and it communicated to me it wanted me for my power and strength.

  NDE associated with drug overdose/poisoning. Very transcendent experience.   

    78.    Burke NDE    10/27/2001.      NDE 390.           "The information rushed me as if this was to be the last stages of some type of completion perfecting the harmony in which I was now a part of."
  NDE associated with near drowning. Received enormous knowledge.   

    77.    Val NDE    10/27/2001.      NDE 389.           "When I realized I couldn't progress forward because my Mom was holding my arm, I felt very torn...not wanting to leave her and my family, but desperately wanting to join the figure waiting for me in the light."  
  NDE associated with surgery. Interesting involvement of mother in account.   

    76.    Alexa H NDE    1/20/2002.      NDE 10050.   Multimedia. Another Multimedia.    I saw how my acting, or not acting to help rippled in effect to other people and their lives. It wasn't until then that I understood how each little decision or choice affects the World.
  NDE associated with labor and delivery complication.  Detailed experience on the other side.   

    75.    Joanna NDE    1/12/2002.      NDE 10051.           Never had I seen or even imagined a place of such purity and peace. Serenity, tranquility, and a calm I had never known before were present there.
  NDE associated with cardiac arrest, with very difficult life both before and after the experience.   

    74.    TS Angel Visitations    7/7/2002.      Other 10063.           IN 1983 I WAS PREGNANT I WAS DUE IN AUG 1983 BEGINNING IN JANUARY AN ANGEL CAME EVERY NIGHT AROUND 0300AM TO TELL ME "SHE IS NOT YOUR BABY TO KEEP
  Touching account by a nurse of prophetic angelic visit.  Not a NDE, but part of the greater spectrum of such experiences.   

    73.    Linda B NDE    12/9/2001.      NDE 10053.           When my eyes opened, I was in hell - in a certain chamber of hell.
  Internal bleeding led to NDE with both classic hellish imagery and classic heavenly imagery.   

    72.    Tee NDE    9/30/2001.      NDE 10054.           Nothing is hard to describe. No sensory input or output. I don't know what else to call it other than describing it as black or nothing.

    63.    Miguel NDE    3/4/2001.      NDE 304.           I didn't see anyone, but I felt He was around me, full of love and joy, and I wanted to stay, but it wasn't my time yet, so I was sent back to my family.

  NDE from lady in Iran at age 17.   

    57.    Lisa B NDE    10/1/2000.      NDE 273.           I became aware that there were 2 (possibly 3) "beings with me, one on either side.  They were communicating with me - directly, telepathically, just putting their input directly into my consciousness, no words and much less "time".  I knew I was somehow removed from these usual "laws" or ways of processing experience.  While I did not sense a life review on specific terms, I was shown, by understanding- not pictures or movies, many significant things in my life.  The good and the bad.  All focused on my contributions- how I handled myself.  I remember the almost palpable absence of all fear.  I was made to understand that this fear is what underlies many of our poor choices.  That there is nothing to fear.  I felt compassion toward myself like I never could imagine possible.  A type of love that I never knew.  Empathy, sympathy for all I'd experienced and a new determination to let myself live as I could and should and must.  I knew I had a clear purpose and was shown this purpose so I could understand how needed I was.
  Fascinating life review!  Experiencer is a Veterinarian.   

    56.    Tim NDE    4/22/2001.      NDE 10010.           Each ball of fire represented a totally different and unimaginable reality. Each one was unique, each one was so different from the other. I later realized that they were actually realms of life.

    55.    Jennifer NDE    12/3/2000.      NDE 10011.           In the meantime, those of us who have been chosen will go forward loving and knowing what the real importance of our tenure here on earth is.

  Transcendent NDE by an attorney.   

    50.    Karen B NDE 187    5/7/2000.      NDE 187.           Next thing I remember I was in a dark tunnel with a light at the end. I was compelled to go to the light. When I came into the light, there was a being of light. It was the most peaceful feeling I have ever felt. More peaceful than I can put into words. The being told me I was HOME but I needed to go back because he had some work for me to do. He said I would not understand the meaning of the work until I went back. He showed me what it was like to have a peaceful world and that we can attain that peaceful world if we have faith and help one another. He said I would come back here and help with this work. In time, I would remember who I really am and what my purpose is on earth. After my work was complete I would come back home. I agreed to come back and help. It has not been easy to come back to this world and all its pain and suffering. In fact, it was a very painful experience to come back. It was like a cruising feeling or of an awareness of feeling the material plane.
