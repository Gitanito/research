  		              		Experience Description   

    I had been estranged from my abusive dad and his side of my family for 5 years. This included my grandma, whom I loved, but he would not allow me to speak to her. Shortly after my grandma had a stroke, I got a cold chill up my spine. It was so strong, that I  told my friend, 'I have never felt a chill like that before in my life. That was so creepy'. I had no idea she had had a stroke. I was informed by a family member a couple of days later as my grandmother was not found for 2 days.
  
  I went to the  hospital around 7pm. My uncle begged her to open her eyes but she couldn’t. My uncle and mother stayed in the room for some time and then left me alone with her. A nurse came in the room and told me her vitals had changed dramatically, the moment I stepped in the room. Once she left, I sat at my grandma’s side and spoke to her about how much I missed her all those years. I told her how much I loved her, the memories I had never forgotten and how sorry I was for how we had been treated and that I was unable to speak to her. After a long conversation, I told her that I knew Jesus was waiting for her.  I told her  she could go,  be with Him, and let go of this life. 

  Immediately after I said that, her breathing completely ceased. I felt a very sharp pain in my chest. I recalled in that moment my best friend telling me that she had felt an extremely, sharp pain in her chest when her uncle passed away under similar circumstances. I ran to get the nurse immediately, and told her my grandma was not breathing anymore. When we returned to the room, she wordlessly checked her vitals,  then ran to get two other nurses. The three nurses confirmed she had passed away. I truly believe that her soul was already on the other side with Jesus, and she was simply waiting for me to give her the OK to go.
  
  The following evening, my uncle gave me a couple of her things. This included a ceramic Christmas ornament of hers I had never seen before of two red cardinals snuggling. Over the following few days, I saw red cardinals every day, which is not common for me. I believe she was letting me know she was free as a bird.
