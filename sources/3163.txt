 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Omatunto</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

  Omatunto ("Conscience").
 Teosofinen Aikakauslehti ("Theosophical Magazine‚Äù).
 1905  Monthly
 Helsinki, Finland.  Language:  Finnish.
 Editor: Pekka Ervast, Maria Ramstedt.
  1/1, January 1905.

 This was intended to be a Theosophical journal but seems to have been short-lived or to have never gotten off the ground: Ervast (1875-1934) was simultaneously at the beginning of 1905 involved with publishing Tietaja and also Ruusu-Risti.  He was a writer, editor and clairvoyant and  had joined the Swedish branch of the Theosophical Society and then in 1907 started the Finnish branch.
