INTRODUCTION
I recently had put into my hands a most attractively
produced and fascinating booklet entitled, "Who and
What Are the Rosicrucians?” In a sub-title, the booklet
offers to place “Facts at Your Fingertips.” And, on the
inside of the cover, we are told, “This Is a Reference
Work for Editors, Authors, Publishers, and Research
Workers.” Additional authority is lent to this little work
by the statement that it was printed by the "Rosicrucian
Press, Inc., San Jose, California,” ancl that it is “Issued
by Permission of the Department of Publications, Su­
preme Grand Lodge, A.M.O.R.C.”
A first glance through the pamphlet left me deeply
impressed by the quality of the production. I was filled
with admiration of the orderly and telling way in which
Rosicrucians introduce themselves to all its readers. And
I was duly astonished by the profuse and beautiful illus­
trations of their plant and its many departments at their
San Jose Headquarters, in California.
It was impossible not to feel the appeal such a booklet
would have for multitudes of people, quite apart from
the lavish promises and reassurances contained in the
text itself.
S
ASTOUNDING STATISTICS
How widespread has been the success of that appeal is
evident from the really remarkable statistics, showing
the extent of the Rosicrucian Foundation’s activities.
We are told that “the number of readers of magazines
and newspapers in which AMORC advertisements appear
monthly equals the entile population of Turkey, or over
17,500,000 persons.”
As a result, incoming letters provide 7,000,000 words
to be carefully scrutinized by the Reading Mail Depart­
ment; bring more foreign money orders than are received
“by any other institution between San Francisco and
Los Angeles”; require in reply “7,120,000 sheets of letter-
size stationery w'hich, if laid end to end, “would form
a path of paper from New York City to Kansas City, or
1.236 miles”; involve a “postage expenditure amounting
to more than $50,000 annually.” Moreover, “AMORC
forwards a greater number of packages, via Railway Ex­
press, than any other organization in Santa Clara Valley,”
whilst “over 6,000,000 pieces of literature are mailed to
all parts of the world annually.”
All that is both arresting and stimulating. The figures
are almost astronomical. One may not think that refer­
ences to “the entire population of Turkey,” or to “a
path of paper from New York City to Kansas City, or
1.236 miles,” aHord any particular reason for confidence
in Rosicrucianism. But they do impress the imagination,
and suggest that it might be worth one’s while to look
into the teachings, and the claims, and the promises of
so remarkable an organization.
“SEE LIFE AS IT IS!”
Before looking more closely at the “Who and What”
pamphlet, let us glance at some samples of the Rosi­
crucian advertisements which appear in magazines and
newspapers read by “over 17,500,000 people monthly.”
In Sydney, Australia, where the writer of this booklet
lives, the prominent headlines “SEE LIFE AS IT IS”
appeared in one of the Sunday newspapers.
Cleverly, the advertisement began by hinting that the
reader of it had hitherto been deprived of information
which should have been his. "The popular teachings of
schools and churches color your vision. The truth is
concealed.” To suggest hunger is to create an appetite!
Then an appeal is made to every man’s innate desire of
privilege and superiority. “Real possibilities for your
advancement in life are kept for the few. A power great
enough to change your whole life is available, if you
find the key.”
Who, on reading that, would not wish to find the key?
Rut no intense and prolonged search is necessary. “The
Rosicrucian secret writings will give you the true pic­
ture of life, and the mysterious forces that await your
command.”
It is difficult to assess the concentrated allurement of
those few words. To be spared all effort, to be let into
a great and precious secret, to be granted access to mys­
terious realms where there are hitherto unknown forces
which will be at your command as surely as if you had
been presented with Aladdin’s Lamp must prove irresist­
ible to multitudes of readers. Think of what it means.
"You will find a different key to your personal problems,
and a simple way to more abundant realization of your
desires.” Is it all a dream? No. “For many centuries the
Rosicrucian system has created a new life with new possi­
bilities for multitudes who are now happy and con­
tented.”
These last words may leave a little uneasy those Chris­
tians who vaguely remember the declaration of their
Divine Master, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.”
Are the Rosicrucians, with their offer of a new life, offer­
ing a new religion? Be reassured I The advertisement
concludes with the emphatic assertion, “The Rosicru­
cians are NOT a religious organization.” It is all per­
fectly good, and perfectly harmless—
granted its truth.
5
UNSEEN POWERS
In a rival Sunday newspaper there was another adver­
tisement, with a picture of the heavens and the planets,
and the challenging question, “Do Unseen Powers Direct
Our Lives?”
This advertisement is an appeal to our sense of the
weird and of the uncanny. There are queer things that
do make one wonder. So the Rosicrucians offer us a few
leading questions along the lines of the occult and mys­
terious forces which seem to shape our lives, yet baffle
us. “Are the tales of strange human powers false? Can
the mysterious feats performed by the mystics of the
Orient be explained away as only illusions? Is there an
intangible bond with the universe beyond, which draws
mankind on? Does a mighty Cosmic intelligence from
the reaches of space ebb and flow through the deep re­
cesses of the mind, forming a river of wisdom which can
carry men and women to the heights of personal achieve­
ment?”
The answer being taken for granted, the reader is
asked forthwith, "Have You Had These Experiences . . .
that unmistakable feeling that you have taken the wrong
course of action; that you have violated some inner, un­
expressed, better judgment . . . the sudden realization
that the silent whisperings of self are cautioning you to
keep your own counsel—
not to speak words on the tip
of your tongue in the presence of others . . . that some­
thing which pushes you forward when you hesitate, or
restrains you when you are apt to make a wrong move ...”
Now is there anyone who has not had such experiences?
The diagnosis fits everybody. The symptoms are such that
all can recognize them. They are the common lot of
every mutable, sensitive, thinking human being. Any
movements of doubt or hesitancy, any vague fears, re­
grets, or impulses will enable you to admit that your
case is exactly thatl
Listen, then, to the startling revelation. "These urges
are the subtle influence which, when understood and
directed, has made thousands of men and women masters
6
of their lives. There IS a source of intelligence within
you as natural as your senses of sight and hearing, and
more dependable, which you are NOT using now!”
But surely every human being knows that, over and
above the senses of sight and hearing, he has an intelli­
gence! And one is using his intelligence whilst reading
this very advertisement of the Rosicrucians, or the words
themselves would be meaningless. I5ut more than that
is intended.
COSMIC MIND
"Challenge This Statement!” we are urged. "Dare the
Rosicrucians to reveal the functions of this Cosmic mind
and its great possibilities to you. Take this infinite power
into your partnership. You can use it in a rational and
practical way without interference with your religious
beliefs or personal affairs.”
So the Rosicrucians believe in a "Cosmic mind of in­
finite power” . . . a “mighty Cosmic intelligence from
the reaches of space which ebbs and flows through the
deep recesses of the human mind, forming a wisdom
which can carry men and women to the heights of per­
sonal achievement!” That’s pantheism, or it’s nothing.
It implies a god to be identified with the universe,
occupying space, and reduced to an ebbing and flowing
physical or psychic force on a level with all other forces
of natural creation.
Yet again we are assured that we can be put in touch
with this pantheistic god of the Rosicrucians without any
interference with our present religious beliefs! But what
if we believe in the One True God? What if we are Chris­
tians? The Rosicrucians must surely hope that we won't
think of that; or that we arc so ignorant of our own
religion that we don’t know what it means! One thing
is certain. No one who is really a Christian could possibly
accept Rosicrucianism. To do so is to abandon Christian­
ity for another and different religion altogether. That
will become clear beyond doubt from a study of the
Rosicrucian Movement in itself.
7
WHAT ARE THE ROSICRUCIANS?
The Rosicrucians describe themselves as "The Ancient
Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross,” of which the initial
letters A.M.O.R.C. are used as an abbreviation.
They claim to be a world-wide fraternal organization,
devoted to the exposition of “a system of mystical and
metaphysical philosophy, intended to guide the develop­
ment of the inner consciousness.”
One who becomes a member is taught “the significance
and application of the Cosmic and natural laws in the
universe around him, and in himself. It unites into one
livable philosophy, metaphysical idealism, and such
practical sciences as physics, chemistry, biology, physi­
ology, and psychology. It also seeks, by its educational
campaign, to rid society of the enslaving influence of
superstition.”
So we are told in the splendidly produced prospectus,
“Who and What Are the Rosicrucians.” But the claims
are preposterous, and calculated to appeal only to the
credulous; whilst the professed aim to eliminate super­
stition is brazen insincerity in an organization which
would collapse completely were it not for the superstition
of those who adopt and support its teachings.
On a par with its repudiation of superstition is its
claim to be non-religious, and to conflict in no way with
the principles of the Christian religion. No one who has
an elementary knowledge of either Rosicrucianism or of
the Christian religion could possibly be so deceived.
Rosicrucianism is essentially religious, as we shall see.
And it is utterly opposed to the Christian religion.
EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND
The official brochure tells us that “Traditionally, the
Rosicrucian Order traces its origin to the Mystery Schools,
or secret schools of learning established during the reign
of Thutmose III, about 1500 B.C., in Egypt. Though he
devoted himself to an investigation of ‘the mysteries’—
in
other words, natural phenomena—
Thutmose III still
8
clung to the ancient religions of the period. His descend-
ent, Amenhotep IV, 1355 B.C., known as the heretic king,
also became leader of the mystery schools; but, being ex­
tremely progressive, he abolished the polytheistic religions
of the time to advance in their stead the world’s first
doctrine of monotheism. The Rosicrucians look upon
Amenhotep IV as their traditional Grand Master.” p. 8.
Now all that is not historically accurate. The ancient
Egyptian "mysteries” were not merely a study of natural
phenomena. Nor did the world’s first devotion to a doc­
trine of monotheism originate with Amenhotep IV. But
that is by the way. The important thing is the admission
that Rosicrucianism claims to trace its teachings back to
the ancient mystery schools, which were the product of
Egypt’s pagan mythology.
“From Egypt,” continues our prospectus, “the secret
teachings of the brotherhood spread into Greece, and
thence into Rome. During the Middle Ages they were
concealed under a variety of different names.”
It is true, of course, that the pagan mystery religions
of ancient Greece and Rome absorbed and incorporated
many ideas from the mythologies of both Persia and
Egypt. And it is significant that the Rosicrucians have
to admit that, in Christian times, those who held to such
pagan superstitions had to conceal their opinions, and
practice their fantastic and un-Christian rites in secret.
If, therefore, these are the “secret mysteries” Rosicrucians
want to revive in these modern times, they stand self-
condemned in the sight of all who retain any Christian
beliefs at all!
But let us leave this remote source of their teachings,
and turn to the historical origin of the Rosicrucian Order.
HISTORICAL ORIGIN
“Chronologically,” the “Who and What" booklet tells
us, “the Order is mentioned as far back as 1115 A.D.,
in a book of the collection of Brother ‘Omnis Mariar,’ in
Germany. It rose to considerable prominence during the
sixteenth century when, following the invention of the
9
printing press, a small pamphlet entitled 'The Fama
Fraternitatis' was issued, and given wide circulation. It
was said to have been written by a theologian, Johann
Valentine Andrea (1586-1654). The pamphlets were
part of a campaign for its revival.”
Now in every age there have been secret societies. But
the Rosicrucian Brotherhood cannot be traced back his­
torically beyond Johann Valentine Andrea, even nomin­
ally. I say even nominally, for the modern Rosicrucian
Order has no continuity as an organization with Andrea's
Fraternity. It is an independent Society, founded cen­
turies later, and claiming only to possess similar secret
and mysterious teachings.
There is a legend that a certain German nobleman
named Christian Rosenkrcuz (1378-1484), when travel­
ing in the Middle East, was there initiated into Arabian
magic and other Oriental mysteries, which he determined
to blend with the Christian religion. On his return to
Germany, he is said to have founded in 1408 a "Frater­
nity of the Rosy Cross,” the members of which were to
devote themselves to the study of the deepest forces of
nature in profound secrecy. All that is sheer legend.
There is no proof that Christian Rosenkreuz ever existed.
All we know is that, in 1614, a pamphlet entitled "Fama
Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis” was published at Cassel, in
Germany, by Johann Valentine Andrea. He claimed that
the secret wisdom of Christian Rosenkreuz had been
transmitted by an anonymous Fraternity or Brotherhood
for some two hundred years, and that he was the first
to make the Fraternity known by his pamphlet. The
Rose and the Cross were chosen as symbols because they
were ancient symbols of occult societies, and because they
were included in the family arms of the Andrea house­
hold.
'I’he publication of the “Fama" was an open invitation
to chosen souls to join the Fraternity, but under the
penalty of death for any disclosure of its secrets and ac­
tivities. The morbid propensity of the age for magic,
weird and mysterious rituals, and secret societies led to
an extensive membership, and the influence of Andrea's
10
Fraternity became very considerable. Andrea himself
ultimately renounced Rosicrucianism, and frequently
denounced it as ridiculous comedy and folly. But he had
started something he could not stop. When Freemasonry
was founded as another secret society in 1717, it borrowed
much from the Rosicrucians, above all from their ritual;
and to this day there is, in the Scottish Rite of Free­
masonry, a symbolic degree known as the "Rosicrucian
Degree.” But what is known as the “Rosicrucian Order”
has no connection with Freemasonry. It is a modern, in­
dependent organization, having a secret philosophy and
ritual of its own, modelled on those of Andrea’s
Fraternity.
The Foundation at Rosicrucian Park, San Jose, Cali­
fornia, claims that the Order was first introduced into
America in 1694, with a location at what is now Fair-
mount Park, Philadelphia.
IS IT A RELIGION?
Under the above heading, the "Who and What” book­
let says, “The Rosicrucian Order is absolutely NOT a
religious movement or sect. It is non-sectarian in every
respect. As its membership is world-wide, it of course
includes persons of every creed and denomination, as
does any other world-wide fraternity of a cultural nature.
Many leading clergymen of Protestant denominations,
rabbis, and priests are members; but the Order itself, in
the past and at present, is free of religious alliances.
Although its ethics adhere to the principles of Chris­
tianity, it must not be considered a religious movement
or a Christian sect. The teachings and philosophical
doctrines of the Order do not interfere with the religious
freedom of its members.” p. 5.
So it is that people with religious scruples are disarmed,
and the simple deceived. For the truth is far otherwise
than stated. The Rosicrucian Order is a religious move­
ment. It is not non-sectarian in every respect, for it is it­
self a sect, thriving like a parasite on a membership drawn
from other sects. It is sheer pretense to suggest that it
ll
is no more than a fraternity of a merely cultural nature;
and whilst it may be true that Protestant clergymen and
Jewish rabbis have been deceived into becoming Rosi-
crucians, it is certainly not true that any Catholic priests
in good standing with their Church are in any way asso­
ciated with them.
As for its being "free of religious alliances,” that merely
means that it is an independent religious organization.
If it does not ask its recruits to break with other re­
ligious bodies to which they already belong, it is surely
not unaware that eventually they will more and more
lose such faith as they have in other religions as they
progress in Rosicrucian teachings and practices. The
claim that its ethics adhere to the principles of Chris­
tianity is negatived by its fundamental disregard of the
requirements of veracity.
In the “Who and What” propaganda booklet we are
told, "The Rosicrucian Order is absolutely NOT a re­
ligious movement or sect.” Rut in the "Encyclopaedia
Britannica,” in his article on "Rosicrucianism,” the
Imperator himself, Dr. H. Spencer Lewis, writes, “It is
non-sectarian, and in a broad sense, non-religious, inas­
much as its teachings include the practical sciences to a
greater extent than principles of religious thought.”
So it is not non-religious after all, save only in a "broad
sense”; and that, not because it omits religious teachings,
but only because it includes other matter in addition to
such teachings! Why this modification of the Rosicrucian
attitude to religion? Is it that the “Facts Put at Our
Fingertips” by the propaganda booklet arc not sufficiently
reliable lor inclusion in the "Encyclopaedia Britannica"?
If so, how can such dishonesty be reconciled with the
ethics of Christianity?
The truth is that Rosicrucianism is the revival of an
ancient heresy against which the early Christian Church
fought for its very life. This was the heresy of the
Gnostics, who also sought to blend pagan mythology
with Christian doctrines, under the pretence of attaining
to a higher, secret, and mysterious wisdom, not to be
gained from the ordinary teachings of the Church. But
the Church knew that their system meant the corruption
of the Christian revelation. Let us consider this aspect
of the subject a little more deeply.
AN ANCIENT HERESY
The pagan world, into which Christianity was born,
was rife with all kinds of superstitious cults, philosophies,
and mythologies. And there was in existence a “secret
confraternity of knowing ones," called the “Gnostics,”
who had built up a mysterious system of doctrines se­
lected from all the current religions and philosophical
theories of the East, ranging from the Mazdeism of Persia
and the legends of the gods of Greece and Rome, through
to the astrology and necromancy of Egypt.
There was an incessant groping and research into the
chaotic wilderness of “ancient wisdom,” to find the real
secrets of the universe; and the Gnostics claimed to have
discovered the treasure, and to be in possession of a secret
knowledge and understanding of mysteries hidden from
the ignorant. Their system consisted of all kinds of ab­
struse and fantastic notions concerning the nature of the
universe, and the destiny of the human soul; and, on
the practical side, of mysterious spells and rites of magic
by which they said that the initiated could win power
and immortality. Astrology, necromancy, occultism,
superstitious incantations, and all the other sorry prod­
ucts of the immature mind were included in the Gnostic
program.
They were, of course, right in declaring their doctrines
to be hidden and mysterious, for their doctrines were
undoubtedly incomprehensible to people with no more
than sound common sense in their heads. But there was
a fascination in the secrecy, and a subtle appeal to the
overweening pride of intellectuals in the claim to higher
enlightenment. As a result, most intelligent pagans
yielded to the Gnostic delusion, and loved to hint, in
cryptic ways, that they knew' more than they could say.
When Christianity came on the scene, the Gnostics
13
relished the prospect of delving into yet another religion,
which talked of God and man, and of a world beyond
this. Who knows what new treasures of knowledge they
might not gain from tfiis Christian system, to add to i
their store of hidden knowledge? Many of them, there­
fore, became Christians. But their conversion could not
be called more than nominal. From the moment of their '
baptism, they claimed to know more about Christ than
the Christians whose ranks they had joined. They scoffed
at the idea that He had been a real man in Galilee.
He had been, and was still a god, they claimed; but at
most He had taken on the semblance of a man. He
had staged a series of apparitions solely in order to
manifest the hidden mysteries of the Beyond; and once
this purpose was accomplished. He had ceased to mani­
fest Himself on earth.
So these Gnostics turned the Master's sayings inside
out, seeking ever deeper and more startling secrets within
them. They read into them whatever their fertile imag­
inations wished to find in them, and ridiculed the
ordinary teachings of the Christian Church. They
formed inner circles within the Church to cherish and
preserve the "secrets" they claimed to have discovered,
and allowed a chosen elite to be initiated very solemnly
into small esoteric groups, and to take part in conferences
and mysterious rites, concerning which only faint rumors
reached the outside world. Within these groups there
were degrees and passwords and signs and emblems—
all
the trappings which fascinate the ungrown mind to this
day.
CHRISTIAN OPPOSITION
The Church was not slow to detect the danger of the
Gnostic movement within the ranks of Christians them­
selves. From the very beginning Christianity had incul­
cated a horror of pagan religions, and the Apostles had
refused to allow anyone associating with pagan religious
rites to go on partaking of the Table of the Lord. There
was felt to be an immeasurable gulf between the doc­
trines, liturgy, worship, secrets, and ceremonies of occult
mythologies, and the religion of Christ.
Moreover, Christ came to offer, not secrets and esoteric
doctrines for a select few, but a Gospel to be preached
and taught to all nations in its full integrity, just as He
had taught it to the Apostles. He had bidden them to
go, and to teach all nations “all things whatsoever I
have made known to you." So the Church, from the
very beginning, condemned and excommunicated the
Gnostics, branding them as heretics, corruptors of die
revealed truth, and enemies of Christ.
Yet, writes Lewis Browne, in his book “Since Calvary,”
“one finds such things still being taught with flambovant
secretiveness by people who call themselves Rosicrucians,
or Speculative Freemasons, or even Theosophists. Usu­
ally there is a queer gleam in the eyes of such people,
a gleam which is said to be the light of esoteric wisdom,
though it may really be the glint of paranoia. In our
day, however, it requires a somewhat maimed intelli­
gence to believe that some secret fraternity of illuminati
is in possession of an ancient and mysterious ‘inner
Knowledge’ as to the Beyond.” p. 63.
ROSICRUC1AN TEACHINGS
The official, but deceptive booklet we have been con­
sidering tells us that, as regards the teachings of Rosi-
crucianism, "An indi\idual listing of the subjects in­
cluded in the membership curriculum would be too
lengthy for the space provided here."
But it generously gives some clue to them. "In the
main,” it continues, “it includes such topics as the
mysteries of time and space; the human consciousness;
the nature of matter; perfecting the physical body; the
effect of light, color, and sound upon the mind; the
ancient philosophies; the development of will; human
emotions, instincts, and their relation to personality;
important discoveries in Rosicrucian chemistry and
physics; explanation of the phenomena of intuition, etc."
No hint is given that the treatment of this galaxy of
subjects must necessarily trespass on the field of religion,
and color or even distort one’s understanding of Chris-
15
tian doctrines. But, aware of the high-sounding nature
of such extravagant claims, the booklet contents itself
with saying, “Highly speculative, fantastic, or improbable
matter is not included in the teachings of the Rosi-
crucians.”
One can’t help feeling that a guilty conscience dictated
that last sentence. For it is very difficult to believe that
the Rosicrucian officials do not know their doctrine to be
just what they have pretended to exclude, "highly specu­
lative, fantastic, and improbable” guesswork. What repu­
table scientist would incorporate in any text-book the
"important discoveries of Rosicrucian chemistry and
physics?”
But let us turn to the impact of Rosicrucianism upon
religious teachings, an aspect of the subject which this
booklet omits to mention.
I have before me a book entitled, “The Rosicrucian
Cosmo-Conception,” or “Mystic Christianity.” It is
described in a sub-title as, “An Elementary Treatise
upon Man’s Past Evolution, Present Constitution, and
Future Development.” The author is Max Heindel; and
the book was published in 1920 by the International
Headquarters of the Rosicrucian Fellowship at Mount
Ecclesta, Oceanside, California.
It may be, of course, that the Mount Ecclesia Rosi-
crucians are a rival body to the San Jose' Rosicrucians.
AMORC may regard Max Heindel as a schismatic be­
cause he won’t throw in his lot with them; or even per­
haps as a heretic. But that is not very important for the
purposes of this discussion. The point is that both
organizations claim possession of the Rosicrucian
“Secrets”; and Max Heindel has been led by Rosicru­
cian principles to an interpretation of Christianity
which is utterly un-Christian.
16
MYTHICAL NONSENSE
In dealing with God, Max Heindel speaks of a
“Cosmic Root Substance,” and tells us that “From the
Root of Existence—
The Absolute—
proceeds the Supreme
Being, at the dawn of manifestation. This is THE
ONE.” p. 181. Apart from the innate absurdities of
such a statement, it involves sheer pantheism. It makes
God an evolving part of the created universe. In fact,
earlier, on p. 180, we are told, "God is found in the
highest division of the seventh Cosmic Plane!” No
Christian for a moment could accept such teaching.
When discussing “Christ and His Mission,” Max
Heindel says, “In the Christian Creed occurs this sen­
tence: ‘Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God.’ This
is generally understood to mean that a certain person
who appeared in Palestine about 2,000 years ago, who
is spoken of as Jesus Christ—
one separate individual—
was the only-begotten Son of God. This is a great mis­
take.” p. 374.
Max Heindel then gives us as the truth the strange
doctrine that Christ and Jesus were separate and distinct
individuals; that Jesus was an ordinary man who had
lived in different circumstances, under various names,
in different embodiments. In his present stage, he had
been educated by the Essenes. But the great Sun-spirit,
Christ, entered into the then body of Jesus with the
i latter’s full and free consent, in order to make initiation
into the Rosicrucian mysteries possible for all men! On
the death of Jesus, the great Sun-spirit, Christ, secured
admission to the earth itself, and since that moment has
been its Regent! pp. 367-410.
This is no mystical interpretation of Christianity. It
is mythical nonsense which, in the eyes of all well-
instructed Christians, amounts to sheer blasphemy.
On p. 403, Max Heindel refers to “Christ's younger
brothers, the Archangels”; and elsewhere tells us that
"Angels are highly evolved human beings!”
Human beings themselves he declares to be subject
to the “I.aw of Consequence.” This I.aw arranges that
17
"a man is born at the time when the position of the
bodies in the solar system will give the conditions neces­
sary to his experience and advancement in the school of
life.” p. 161. “The stars may therefore be called the
‘Clock of Destiny.’ p. 163. We are even told that the
twelve signs of the Zodiac are “twelve Creative Hier­
archies!”
After this excursion into astrology, we are introduced
to the old rc-incarnation theories of Indian philosophy;
improved, of course, by Rosicrucian wisdom. There is
no transmigration of human souls into animals. The
“Rosicrucian” Law of Rebirth means that we become
reincarnated only as better men, progressing always
towards our final evolution into Angels; when we, too,
shall become “creators.”
On p. 400 wc are told that no human beings need
redemption and salvation by the precious blood of
Christ, as Christians have been led to believe; and, on
p. 402, that not all men need salvation, even in the
Rosicrucian sense of the word.
Such is “Mystic Christianity” according to "Rosicru­
cian Cosmo-Conceptions.” But what a travesty it all is!
On p. 520 of his book, Max Heindel says frankly, “The
Order of Rosicrucians is not merely a secret society; it
is one of the mystery schools, and the Brothers are Hiero­
phants of the lesser Mysteries.” Would it not be better if
they contented themselves with the claim to be
"Hierophants,” dropping all pretence to be Christians?
“NOT ASTROLOGY”
Despite Max Heindel’s description of the stars as the
“Clock of Destiny,” and his open support of astrology
as a branch of Rosicrucian “science,” AMORC’s “Who
and What” propaganda booklet insists on p. 7 that “The
Rosicrucian Order does not teach, indorse, or practice
astrology, fortune telling, crystal-gazing, numerology, or
any other past or present superstitions, or similar popular
pseudo-scientific practices. Furthermore, it neither teach-
18
es, practices, nor recommends spiritualism or hypno
tism.” In the “Encyclopaedia Britannica," the Impera-
tor, Dr. H. Spencer Lewis, gi\es the same assurance in
his article on Rosicrucianism. He declares that "it has
consistently tabooed the superstitious arts of the Orient,
and does not include fortune-telling, necromancy, or
spiritualism."
Yet, on p. 10, some of the facts placed at our finger­
tips in the “Who and What” brochure concern the
Planetarium. “The Rosicrucian Planetarium, located in
Rosicrucian Park, San Jose, California, and built at con­
siderable cost, is one of the six planetariums in the United
States. It is the only one entirely built and designed in
America. It is called ‘The Theatre of the Sky,’ because
it presents the greatest drama of all the ages, the mytho­
logical traditions and Cosmic roles of the planets and
stars, revealing their surprising astronomical mysteries,
and giving young and old a clearer conception of the
wonders of the heavens."
No one can object to the study of astronomy, nor to
any scientific aids towards obtaining a clearer concep­
tion of the wonders of the heavens. But scientific
astronomy is left far behind in a Planetarium designed
to “present the greatest drama of all the ages, the mytho­
logical traditions and Cosmic roles of the planets and
stars." Mythological traditions cannot have for Chris­
tians the value Rosicrucians attribute to them. And
what becomes of the Rosicrucian-vrepudiation of astrol­
ogy, in the light of statements about the “Cosmic roles” of
planets and stars? Planets and stars have no more a
“Cosmic role” than have cabbages or camels.
And can any Christians admit that the “mythological
traditions and Cosmic roles of the planets and stars”
constitute “the greatest drama of all the ages"? For a
Christian, the Greatest Drama of all the ages was the life
on earth of the Incarnate Son of God, Jesus Christ, and
His redemptive death for the salvation of mankind.
But the effort to deceive credulous people into the
adoption and support of Rosicrucianism does not stop
there.
19
“NO STRANGE PRACTICES OR RITES”
The “Who and What’’ booklet, in its effort to disarm
suspicions concerning the true nature of Rosicrucianism,
declares that it has "no strange practices or rites.”
“Rosicrucianism,” it says, “makes no demands upon
its members that would oblige them to conduct them­
selves in any manner that would bring them into public
ridicule or condemnation. The members are not re­
quired to dress, eat or act any differently than would
be expected of any intelligent and morally responsible
man or woman in the conduct of his or her ordinary
affairs. The members resort to no practices or rites
which in any sense are injurious to health, family re­
lationships, or morals.”
The first thing that occurs to one on reading these
words is astonishment that such an assurance should be
needed. What is there, in Rosicrucianism, which would
lead one to suspect that members might be expected to
behave differently from ordinary people who rejoice in
intelligence and moral responsibility? The very pro­
testation is an admission of something queer about the
whole system.
But, secondly, the explanation strangely fails to cover
the proposed objection. It makes no reference to the
superstitious religious rites, against which Christians
must be particularly on their guard. The general state­
ment that there is nothing which could bring members
into “public ridicule or condemnation” is not enough.
That would follow' from the very nature of the Rosi-
crucian Order as a secret society. Are there any strange
practices or rites in secret? That is the vital question.
Now, on p. 19 of the official handbook, there is an
illustration of “The Supreme Temple, Rosicrucian
Order, A.M.O.R.C.” But the very description of a build­
ing as a "temple” connotes worship. And the interior
design of the building is obviously one of religious sig­
nificance. There is a central sanctuary, with a Mithraic-
looking altar encompassed by four decorated pillars,
the whole set-up intended to create a mystic atmosphere.
20
The official booklet describes it as a “lodge-room,” but
goes on to say that in it “are conducted the impressive
and symbolic ritualistic convocation of the Grand
Lodge.” No matter how they may wrap it up in words,
however, the fact remains that the ceremonies conducted
in this “Supreme Temple” are religious in character.
They arc “impressive” because strange. And what arc
“symbolic ritualistic convocations,” if not “rites”? Yet
we are seriously asked to believe that Rosicrucianism in­
volves “no strange practices or rites”1
Again, on p. 17 of the official booklet, there is the pic­
ture of "The Shrine of Amenhotep IV, Pharaoh of
Egypt.” It is built as a square-cut archway, leading to a
colonnade of pillars bordering an open sun-lit pathway
which is possibly meant to suggest the road to wisdom.
The arch itself is covered with Egyptian hieroglyphics,
in honor of the mystic teachings of Amenhotep IV7
,
upon whom the Rosicrucians have conferred the priv­
ileged title of "traditional first Grand Master.”
Once more, however, a “shrine” is a religious term,
implying a hallowed center of devotion and worship.
It at once awakens the thought of prayers and of pil­
grimages. Nor are our misgivings allayed by the descrip­
tion accompanying the illustration, “This artistic
structure, erected on the grounds of Rosicrucian Park,
commemorates the Initiation held by approximately a
hundred Rosicrucian men antPwomen in Karnak Tem­
ple, Egypt, in 1929.”
Such admissions of ritual and worship in the midst
of ancient symbols of pagan mythology make it astound­
ing that, on an earlier page in the same booklet, the
categorical statement could be made, “The Rosicrucian
Order is absolutely NOT a religious movement or sect.”
p. 5. Have the compilers of this brochure no idea of the
meaning of words? Or do they hope that at least
the readers of the booklet wull miss the real significance
of the movement they have been invited to join?
21
CHRISTIAN VERDICT
What is the truth about Rosicrucianism? It is a mod­
ern revival of, or at least an imitation of the ancient
pagan mystery religions. It is precisely what it so em
phatically denies itself to be, an occult, semi-theosophical,
superstitious, thinly disguised form of astrology, blended
with strange practices and rites which do constitute it a
religious movement or sect.
It may, not very innocently, describe itself as an inno­
cent “system of mystical and metaphysical philosophy,
intended to guide the development of the inner con­
sciousness.” But Christians have all the religious and
spiritual guidance they need in the teachings of Christ,
Our Lord. One who understands the Gospels, who
meditates their teachings, who has at his disposal the
wisdom, experience, and advice of the Church Christ
established to safeguard His doctrines and precepts, one
who sincerely tries to put into practice the prescriptions
of the Gospels and of the Church of the centuries—
such
a one has no temptation to look elsewhere for religious
truth and spiritual guidance.
Certainly, no one who has any real understanding of
the Christian religion, and loves Christ above all things,
could have anything to do with Rosicrucianism. It is
a system which hopes to secure recruits from amongst
the ranks of Christians who have drifted from any clear
knowledge and realization of what the Christian religion
really means.
In conclusion, it must be said that, far from resulting
in a more enlightened interpretation of Christianity,
Rosicrucianism can result only in its perversion. It ap­
peals to imagination, not to reason; to credulity, and
not to any genuine spirit of faith; to pride, and not to
humility; to self-assertion, not to reliance upon divine
grace. In a word, it is utterly un-CIn istian. And only
one conclusion is possible. St. Paul’s horror of the an­
cient heathen mystery religions is the only attitude a
true Christian can adopt towards the Rosicrucian Sys-
22
tem, and similar outbreaks of humanity’s morbid pro­
pensity towards esoteric magic, secret so-called mystical
societies, and pagan mythology.
