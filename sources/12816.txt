  		              		Experience Description   

    Below are the notes in my medical record concerning the event that led to the NDE: Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts X 3

  Notes: GSRMC LEFT INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY, LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY, SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT TO OBSTUSE MARGINAL BRANCE OF CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY, SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT TO RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY

  I had the open heart surgery the morning of 8/5/21. I was taken off the ventilator early on the morning of 8/6/2021 the next morning after the above surgery.  I was asked to take a small walk around the ICU ward.  When I came back from the walk I was not feeling well and I collapsed in my ICU room.  I learned later that I coded for 2+ minutes.  CPR was performed and I was rushed back into surgery. Stents were put into my left anterior descending artery as the bypass in that artery failed. One other bypass has failed since 8/6/2021 and I have seven stents in two of the bypassed arteries and the third one is still uncertain and we are still monitoring it closely. On the operating table on 8/6/2021 during the catherization process I coded again. I was put back on a ventilator and sedated. After the catherization the echo cardiograms that were performed where showing alarmingly low numbers. I stayed in this state from Friday morning (8/6/21) to Monday (8/9/21) when I woke up and my echo cardiogram showed my heart function at normal.  

  From the time I coded to when I woke up I had a number of experiences. I cannot recall exactly when these experiences occurred or if they were even linear but I believe they were linear as it involved me making a decision about returning to my body.   

  I recall not being afraid and in a void (just clear open white space). I recall a life review but no judgement was attached to it just a play back.  I recall the presence of a guide but not really seeing that guide just communication with them telepathically. I floated for a while in this space, I am not sure for how long.  I recall an out of body experience; the medical team talking over my body and expressing concern that they did not know how much longer my other organs could hold out with the amount of medication I was getting and my heart's current function. I think that is when I knew that I was at risk of not recovering.  I recall communicating that I was tired and ready to go. I meant tired of life (I have had many traumas in my life and I have suffered with that trauma for most of my life). I remember being concerned for my son and husband but ready to go.  The guide informed me that I was not ready to pass to the next phase of existence because my soul (not sure if they used that word but that is what they were referring to) was not ready.  I still have lessons to learn but those lessons were not revealed to me.  I do recall understanding that all of our relationships are temporary and meant to help us grow or learn something, it seems cold but they were not as intimate as we believe even our most cherished such as the parent child and spousal relationships. They are almost transactional in that we teach other lessons that we need to grow.  Our relationship is transitory and we have many of them over our lifetimes. I somehow also knew that we lived many lifetimes and this current life was temporary in the greater timeframe. I recall the guide informing me that I could return to my body or be reincarnated. I saw a woman with a young child but she was of a different race than me and I recall thinking I did not want to do this over again and I did not want her life and if I had to come back I wanted to be with the people I knew and loved. I guess that is when I made my decision to return to my body. Once that decision was made I recall rushing to get back to my body. The phase I recall saying over and over is that I have to get back to my boys. I recall passing through a space where I felt the presence of my loved ones who have passed on (I have lost both my parents and my mother-in-law in the past few years) but knew I did not have time to stop and communicate with them I had to get back to my body. I don't recall how I got back to my body it was not as if I traveled to any type of portal I just recall waking up. 

  When I woke up on Monday they did another echo cardiogram and everyone was surprised at how well my heart was functioning and I started to gain strength quickly. Because of Covid-19 I could only have one visitor a day so my husband and son alternated visits. I recall my son visiting on Tuesday and I was still pretty sedated but getting stronger and then how surprised he was when he came back on Thursday and I was up walking and talking for the majority of our visit. 

  That is my NDE experience.  Since it was not revealed to me what I have to learn to be ready to move on to the next phase I guess I did not really gain any secrete knowledge outside of the fact that our consciousness continues beyond our physical death and that can and do have multiple lifetimes.  I did also learn that we do not carry the knowledge of those past lives with us from lifetime to lifetime, it is a reset every time. Know that doesn't really expense how some people did actually have recall of those past lives but my understanding from my experience was that we are not supposed to have that recall.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 08/06/2021  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-relatedHeart attack  CPR given   Open heart surgery, the bi passes failed the next morning after surgery I coded for over 2 minutes t  Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   Had unplanned open heart surgery and the bypasses failed and I coded twice.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  Yes as explained above.  My medical team discussing my condition. My husband said they had called him to the hospital because they were medically concerned about me.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness   the images presented to me were dreamlike and distant.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I am not sure how to answer this question.  I guess I feel like at each stage since I had multiple experiences that I recall. I do not recall a conscious journey anywhere like through portals or lights.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     I cannot tell if time was moving linear or if the events I recall were in a linear order.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Since I was in a all-white space I did not have any visual recalls.  I feel like the images I was presented where in my mind's eye almost dream-like.  
  
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Same as the visual experience explained above.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     Yes, loved one but I knew I did not have time to interact so I didn't.  I have images of what my next life could be if I elected to reincarnate v. return to my body.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain   I was in space that was bright white but felt more like a void. I have described this space like a waiting station.  I know that I did not move on to the space beyond this was transitional space.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     safe white void  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         calm, at peace.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     I gained some knowledge but not complete knowledge. For I describe this above the section of what happened.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control     just in the life review.  

Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future     Of what life might be if I reincarnated.  

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life   I could not move on; I was coming back to life either into my own current body or through reincarnation but I was not allowed to move on as my soul is not ready and still needs to grow.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other faiths- New age   Former Christian but have not practiced in many years.  I am more included to believe that all the world religions share some common origins I am just not sure what it is.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     consistent with others beliefs (Buddhist belief in reincarnation but honestly I don't know much about Buddhist religion or Hindi which I think also believe in reincarnation).  I was raised Christian and have not been practicing for many years so not consistent with my religious upbringing.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     less fearful and willing to live and express my truths more.  Less concerned with what other people think about me.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   it felt like my guide but it was telepathic.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I was given the knowledge in a general sense that we live many lifetimes to learn whatever it is we need to be ready to move to the next phase of existence.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Uncertain     I got the sense that our individual experiences and life spans are small in comparison to some greater scheme. For example, that we live multiple life's and we are growing and learning in each until we gain some level of knowledge that prepares us to move on to the next phase of existence.  I wasn't provided any specific knowledge of what that next stage is or even what we have to do gain the knowledge to gain access.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain   Only that we are here to learn some special knowledge but it was not revealed to me what it is exactly. I think it has to be with love and learning how to give it unconditionally but that is my guess.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I explained it in the question above.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          Yes, when a soul is ready (gained the knowledge it needs it can move on to the next phase of existence but if physical death occurs before the soul is ready to move on it will reincarnate.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     They are help us learn  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I felt like that that might the ultimate lesson we are supposed to learn. How to truly love unconditionally.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life     I believe I have a mission I just don't know what it is.  I felt like experience was personal (concerned with my growth) but I don't know how to identify what I am supposed to be learning to prepare me for the next phase of existence.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain I am being more honest and less fearful so I assume that is impact my most intimate relationships.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I feel like there were just things I knew but cannot recall them being told to me explicitly.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I do not know how my remembrance of the experience compares to my remembrance of other life events that occurred around the time of the experience  N/A  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Well that I have to learn something and I don't know what it is.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Here, a few friends.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I knew that people have had experiences.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     After I was able to put a timeline together of what was happening to my body I feel like it confirmed what I believed and reaffirmed for me that I did have a NDE.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I have since done a little research and my experience is pretty consistent with others explanation of their experience.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No
