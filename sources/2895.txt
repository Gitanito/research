DEFINITIONS IN
PHILOSOPHY
To appreciate the scope and value of phil­
osophy and its superiority over every other
branch of learning, it seems appropriate to
consider briefly the opinions of learned men
relative to the importance and dignity of this
noblest of human institutions. The quotations
which follow are for the most part verbatim,
but in a few cases we have slightly condensed
the original statements; in no way however,
adding to or altering the meaning.
Hume: “Be a philosopher; but amidst all
your philosophy be still a man.”
Learning should never separate a man from
his world nor cause him to feel himself super­
ior to others; rather it should bring him clos­
er to the heart of mankind and bestow upon
his soul a realization of the dignity of all life
and the identity of all creatures.
[1 1
Cicero : “Philosophy, right defined, is noth­
ing but the love of wisdom.”
The soul, ultimately disappointed in hu­
man relationships, must turn from its attach­
ment to outward forms and bestow its affec­
tion upon those imperishable truths which
alone can satisfy man’s yearnings.
Southey. “Philosophy is of two kjnds: that
which relates to conduct, and that which re­
lates to knowledge. The first teaches us to
value all things at their true worth, to be con­
tented with little, modest in prosperity, patient
in trouble, equal minded at all times. It
teaches us our duty to our neighbor and our­
selves, but it is he who pursues both that is the
true philosopher. The more he \nows the
more he is desirous of knowing; and yet the
further he advances in knou^edge, the better
he understands how little he can attain, and
the more deeply he feels that God alone can
satisfy the infinite desires of the immortal soul.
To understand this is the height and perfection
of philosophy.”
From this definition it becomes apparent
that sacred and secular knowledge are but the
aspects of one divine institution. True phil­
osophy is not satisfied to reason only upon
[ 2 ]
mortal concerns but rises to loftier speculation
intent upon discovering not only the law but
the Maker of the law.
Gifford:
“Divine philosophy! by whose pure light,
We first distinguish, then pursue the right;
Thy power the breast from every error frees,
And weeds out all its vice by degrees.”
It is most fitting that a definition of phil­
osophy should come to us in verse for as science
is the prose of living so philosophy is the poetry
of existence. By the perception of divine reali­
ties we come finally to rhyme all the dissonant
lines of life.
Epictetus: “All philosophy lies in two
words: Sustain and abstain.”
The wise man sustains his reason by feed­
ing it upon a sufficient diet of thoughts. He
abstains from that which will bring sickness
to his mind by eliminating from his thinking
and living all thoughts and actions which are
unreasonable and destructive.
Coleridge: “In wonder all philosophy be­
gan; in wonder it ends; and admiration fills
up the interspace.—But the first is the won-
[ 3 ]
der of ignorance, the last is the parent of
adoration.”
Only the philosopher possesses the power
of intelligent appreciation. To the wise man
the wisdom of the universe becomes apparent.
From the intelligent contemplation of exist­
ence arises a full realization of the perfection
of that Parent Cause upon which all creation
hangs.
Cicero'. ‘‘To study philosophy is nothing
but to prepare oneself to die.”
We may face the small issues of the day
with ignorance and still preserve some small
illusion of security, but in the presence of that
great transition which is the inevitable fate of
all men, our only security lies in some adequate
appreciation of the universe and its plan.
Quarles'. “Make philosophy thy journey.”
How wise was that old emblem-writer
when he perceived that life is a journey in wis­
dom, action an experience in knowledge, and
truth the whole purpose of our being.
Epictetus'. “The first business of philosophy
is, to part from self-conceit!’
[ 4 ]
A man who over-estimates himself will un­
der-estimate his world. To be humble is to
admit the greatness of the universe. Out of
a becoming humility arises the capacity for un­
derstanding.
Muller, Max: “Philosophy is the knowl­
edge of the limits of our knowledge.”
Beyond the small circle of the known
stretches an eternity of uncertainties. Of this
the wise man is aware but he has found secur­
ity in the realization that beyond the eternities
of the unknown again is the all-sufficient cir­
cumference of truth.
Aristotle: “Philosophy is the science which
considers truth!’
Though Pilate’s question remains unan­
swered it is the opinion of the wise that it is
not unanswerable. The philosopher knows
that there is but one way to discover truth and
that is to become truth. Philosophy is the sci­
ence of becoming.
Bulwer-Lytton: “Real philosophy seeks
rather to solve than to deny!’
When the temple of wisdom is completed
much of its foundation will be made up of
[ 5 ]
stones which sophists have rejected. There
is no virtue in denying things as they are but
there is great virtue in discovering the reason
for things as they are.
Seneca: “It is the bounty of nature that we
live, but of philosophy that we live well;
which is, in truth, a greater benefit than life
itself
To live without thinking is to descend to
the state of the brute, but to crown life with
intelligent action is to rise to the estate of the
supermen.
Lavater: “True philosophy is that which
makes us to ourselves and to all about us,
better!’
There is no merit in wisdom, there is no
reward in knowledge, there is no comfort in
faith, unless these things manifest outwardly
subduing the violence of action and bringing
us to a harmless mode of existence.
Nisbet: “The modern skeptical philosophy
consists in believing everything but the truth,
and exactly in proportion to the want of evi­
dence; in making windows that shut out the
light and passages that lead to nothing!’
[ 6 ]
Philosophy is nothing if not noble; it is of
no value unless it inclines the race to gentle
virtue and noble action. To the measure that
it fails to adore the One, serve the Beautiful
and venerate the Good it fails to be philosophy.
Voltaire: “The discovery of what is true,
and the practice of that which is good, are the
two most important objects of philosophy.”
Thinking is not merely an exercising of the
mind, it is a directing of the mind. Only such
as have organized thought to the accomplish­
ment of some actual good are worthy to be
denominated wise.
Shaftesbury. “The sum of philosophy is
to learn what is just in society, and beautiful
in nature, and the order of the world.”
Philosophy is founded upon vision and ex­
perience; vision to perceive a noble end and
experience to modulate mans’ natural impulse
to over hasten the reformation of his world.
Plutarch: “Philosophy is the art of living.”
The arts are sciences of the beautiful, and
if philosophy be the art of living it must be the
art of living beautifully.
[ 7 ]
Shaftesbury. “It is not a head merely, but
a heart and resolution, which complete the real
philosopher.”
Reason arises not from intellect alone but
from the whole life. It is built upon wise
thinking, generous feeling, and trained per­
ceptions.
Thoreau: “To be a philosopher is not mere­
ly to have subtle thoughts', but to so love wis­
dom as to live according to its dictates.”
Philosophy is first living then thinking.
The philosophic life is the only foundation up­
on which an intelligent life can be built.
Seneca'. “Philosophy is the art and law of
life.”
By this Seneca infers that philosophy is a
rule of procedure, a code by the living of which
man becomes worthy of happiness.
Selden, fohn: “Philosophy is nothing but
discretion.”
By discretion we should understand that regu­
lation of action by which all intemperences
are controlled whether they be of the mind or
of the body. He who is discreet is above an
unreasonable act and may be just termed wise.
[ 8 ]

Cowley. “To be a husbandman, is but a
retreat from the city; to be a philosopher,
from the world; or rather a retreat from the
world as it is man s, into the world as it is
God’s.”
The world of God and the world of man
are not separated by any distance other than
the interval of understanding. As we grow
wise we depart not into some distant country
but rather we perceive the wise man’s world
emerging form the very ignorant world of our
own sphere. A
Burhe'- “Philosophy is queen of the arts and
the daughter of heaven!’
The wisest of the sages have always main­
tained that wisdom had its beginning not
among men but among the gods from whom
it descended for the salvation of humanity.
Seneca-. “Philosophy is the health of the
mind.”
It is normal for man that he should think
well but the blight of materialism has de­
stroyed his birthright to wisdom. It is there­
fore necessary in this benighted age for each
man to struggle valiantly if he is to achieve
to a normal and reasonable state.
[ 9 ]
Londos: “A true philosopher is beyond the
reach of fortune.”
To be truly wise it is necessary to so love
wisdom that there is no place left in the mind
for anxieties concerning the temporal state. He
who lives in desire for plenty or in fear of loss
has no right to call himself a philosopher.
Sims: “Philosophy is reason with the eyes
of the soul.”
The intellect in itself can perceive nothing
beyond that which is intellectual but the in­
tellect when quickened with spiritual percep­
tion bestows the philosophic viewpoint.
Hare: “The business of philosophy is to
circumnavigate human nature.”
A philosopher must be fortified against
himself. Philosophy is a conspiracy against
the inadequacy of ourselves. By it we are giv­
en courage to act more nobly than is natural
to the human animal.
Lamartine: “Philosophy is the rational ex­
pression of genius.”
We may define genius as special aptitude
but when special aptitude is directed to the
most important of all efforts, the perfection of
[ 10]
self, it is termed philosophy. A philosopher
is a genius who has discovered the most per­
fect use of his abilities.
Joubert: “Whence? whither? why? how?
—These questions cover all philosophy.”
Whence—God. Whither—to God. Why
—law. How—wisdom.
From the Infinite to the Infinite we must
proceed. The why of life is known only to
the Maker. But from philosophy we learn
how to fit ourselves into the plan of life and to
prepare ourselves for final identity with our
Cause.
Carlyle: “The philosopher is he to whom
the highest has descended and the lowest has
mounted up] who is the equal and tyndly
brother to all.”
Between heaven and earth stands the wise
man. His earthy part has been raised to its
highest perfection as the instrument of a di­
vine purpose. The higher part, the soul it­
self, has become tolerant of the limitations of
the body and wise in its own weakness is tol­
erant of the limitations of all other things.
