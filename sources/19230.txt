Oh
there was a man named Gordon Cooper who
most of you may know was someone who
gave us testimony about the craft that
landed on the dry lake bed in California
Edwards range back in 1956 I believe it
was that his crew film that he saw the
film footage and sent it back to the
Pentagon well Gordon Cooper very heroic
figure an early early mercury astronaut
and I were speaking to a conservative
group called the Federalist Society here
in Washington who were very interested
in this because they were interested in
the unconstitutionality because their
strict constitutional and I will speak
to any group I don&#39;t care
you know I&#39;m he&#39;s fine our politics I
don&#39;t care so I mean I agree with the
group&#39;s politics all the way through but
they were interested and they invited me
and Gordon Cooper so we went so my wife
was with me it was here at the Hyatt I
think near Capitol Hill and I was going
so I started talking to Gordon and
comparing notes of people we had talked
to within the system and he had been
asked by secretary defense cohen co h en
who was secretary of defense for bill
clinton bill bill clinton search defense
had asked him directly to give him all
the actionable intelligence all the
details needed about that landing event
of a craft at the dry lakebed in 1956
because he wanted to see that footage
and he got back to Gordon Cooper and
said I can&#39;t find it it&#39;s not accessible
it&#39;s in this unacknowledged project and
the Secretary of Defense
so there&#39;s another person proven out of
the loop so I started making a list of
all the people who had been denied
access who by all rights absolutely must
know if it&#39;s a legal program Secretary
of Defense President United States
CIA director on and on and on then I end
up a couple years after this getting
invited to brief the head of the Defense
Intelligence Agency General Patrick
Hughes now general Patrick Hughes was a
man you&#39;d often see him with Madeleine
Albright and Bill Clinton and other
people he was the head of the Defense
Intelligence Agency which is
like the CIA for the Pentagon it&#39;s
almost as large man it&#39;s their in-house
intelligence shop where as you know the
CIA is a civilian agency that this is a
military intelligence but the Defense
Intelligence Agency is sort of sits on
top of all military intelligence and he
was the director so and he&#39;s a
three-star general so I get invited to
brief General Patrick Hughes at the
Pentagon so I think well let&#39;s see what
he knows of course he wanted to know
what I know so again I sent him a full
dossier and briefing prior to arriving
so he be adequately brought up to speed
we had a meeting scheduled I go to the
Pentagon full military escorts in like
you always have in these areas and I go
in and we start talking about this and
he he says well I find this amazingly
interesting he says but in all my years
in the military I have never been told
anything about it nothing and I said
well I doesn&#39;t surprise me there are
other people in your position he says he
got up he went over to a bookshelf and
on it was a little like he&#39;d get it a
toy store a little et doll like about
this big and he grabbed he says this is
all I&#39;d gotten for my inquiries about
this issue through channels in other
words someone gave it to him as a gag
gift now there was a full-bird Colonel
sitting at the table during this
briefing and I started explaining the
way you know these particularly and he
knew what an unacknowledged special
access project was this is know he says
but he didn&#39;t know about this one and he
wasn&#39;t being he says well I can&#39;t
imagine that there are operations within
the Defense Intelligence Agency that
know about this and they wouldn&#39;t tell
me when I&#39;ve asked I said well they
would say to me they lied to the
president they lied to the CI dirty and
though why do you and the colonel
visibly stiffened because I said at that
moment there are people on your senior
staff who are tasked with this issue but
they don&#39;t want you to know for whatever
reason
and this Colonel stiffened and my
military advisor and I compared notes
later that guy was on the inside lying
to the general the colonel was zooming
the general illegal yes
treason yes happens every single day at
the Pentagon and CIA so when you&#39;re
dealing with an unacknowledged special
access project this sensitive so these
are not conspiracy theories I&#39;ve been
there on the guy who set up these
meetings and was there and I will say
that I&#39;m the only civilian you&#39;ll ever
meet who&#39;s had meetings of this nature
with people like that all over the world
so I wanted to put this on the record
now after this we had about a 15 minute
discussion and then the general told me
something very surprising he says you
know my father this is General Patrick
Hughes telling me my father knew of some
kind of illegal conspiracy in the US
government back in the 50s and 60s
because he was apparently was also very
high official that was so serious and we
thought the old man was a kook referring
to his father he said I thought this
would all be nonsense until I got into
this office until I became the head at
the Defense Intelligence Agency and
contrasted with what I&#39;m being told with
what I&#39;ve seen received from the
disclosure project or a project Starlite
at that time and he said that you know
my father was so upset by this he
eventually ate his gun committed suicide
and you know and you know so the weight
of this is huge huge so I said well you
know you just move on but he said I
don&#39;t know what I can do because they&#39;re
not gonna tell me anything I said but I
have disclosure project witnesses inside
the DIA who&#39;ve seen satellite imagery of
ET craft out in space we have their
testimony he says well they won&#39;t tell
me anything
so of course what you realize is that
these positions
rotate their therefore year or two or
three or four the president if he&#39;s
lucky eight but there&#39;s this permanent
system so let&#39;s call it the permanent
secret government versus the one that
sort of is this revolving door of folks
sometimes the people in that system know
and sometimes they don&#39;t and since the
mid-1950s the criteria for being on the
inside of the secrecy is the following
and this is how I explained it to a
five-star Admiral in England who is also
one of our witnesses Admiral Lord Hill
Norton he was the head of the Ministry
of Defence and he was a sea lord they
called them back then they don&#39;t have
five-star Admirals anymore and he was
the head of the Military Committee for
NATO so I went to his cottage in
Hampshire some years ago Emily dropped
me off took the kids to the Salisbury
Cathedral I believe and I continued on
had a meeting with the Admiral and you
know you get a picture of what my life
must be like so it nuts completely nuts
so anyway so I&#39;m there with this man and
we&#39;re sitting in some wingback chairs in
his his parlor and what he called his
cottage in Hampshire and which is his
gorgeous old Antiquity house with the
thatched roofs and beautiful and he we
started talking about this he was a very
fastidious man he had a little teeny
notepad like this in a pen and taking
assiduously taking notes very very and
we got to this question and he said will
you know the entire time I was the head
of the Ministry of Defence which is also
means you&#39;re head of mi5 and mi6 and the
intelligence units in England it&#39;s the
same position there is separate here if
CIA director and Secretary of Defense
there is one head and he says this issue
was never briefed to me there was I was
never told anything and I said yeah
that&#39;s isn&#39;t surprise me now it would
have may be phone um burr of years ago
and he said and as military the head of
the military committee for NATO I
never told even though I&#39;ve now have
learned NATO was dealing with some of
these events such as the big events that
were in Belgium with the massive
triangular craft and things like that
well I said he says and I want to know
why they wouldn&#39;t tell me it was like
his pride was his a sense of propriety
oh he was a lord in the House of Lords
also he says why wouldn&#39;t they tell me
and it was a little bit petulant and but
also hurt I said well let me answer your
question with a question and he didn&#39;t
like they thought I was being a cheeky
American and I said but just bear with
me what would you have done if you found
out that there was a cabal that had run
amuck of the laws of all the democracies
that had this information and had the
technologies to completely fix the
environment in global poverty create a
civilization that would be sustainable
for thousands of years with these types
of free energy technologies and that
they had killed people to keep this
secret assassinated people and broken
the walls of their country and their
solemn oaths uphold their constitutions
to do so you know I wouldn&#39;t stick for a
bloody minute
I said that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t tell you I
said the first thing they do when they
make a decision that you&#39;re in and
you&#39;re out of the loop of this issue is
whether you&#39;ll go along with the secret
agenda if you&#39;re going to go along with
the secret agenda they&#39;ll tell you and
they&#39;ll give you a little bit and then a
little bit and then a little bit and
bring you up through the system if they
think that you&#39;re the kind of stand-up
person who would be appalled when they
find out what the criminality of this
group is and how illegal it is and what
damage they&#39;re doing to the earth and to
the humanity by keeping a secret and
that you might blow the whistle on it
like Jack Kennedy was planning to do in
his second term that&#39;s why they took him
out and that&#39;s where they took off my
old Marilyn Monroe I have a document to
prove it
and a top-secret document from the NSA
vault
it&#39;s
my first book to read it nobody reads
anymore
but anyway what was interesting is that
he looked at me he says that is it then
I said yes
they do a soul biopsy like doctors do
biopsies they do if they do a soul
biopsy and a psychological analysis to
see if you would be willing to go along
with that agenda if you are willing to
go along with it they&#39;ll give you a
little bits until you rise up through
the system if you divert from the system
they take you out you&#39;re gonna be dead
so they&#39;ve learned not to be too
reckless with who they tell because they
don&#39;t want to have to kill too many
people and we body scattered that looks
conspicuous like they did in the 50s and
60s with John Foster Dulles and
President Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe and
other famous people so so I said that&#39;s
why it&#39;s managed this way now you may
have had a predecessor who is mo Dee
head who came up through that system
who knew all about these projects so it
doesn&#39;t have anything to do with your
rank it has to do with your values it
has to do with your willingness to go
along with an agenda that is the most
criminal evil dangerous agenda that any
potentates have ever had in the history
of the world that we know of and that&#39;s
what we&#39;re dealing with with this this
super-secret Magi group and they are not
going to be reckless and who they read
into and pull into those projects so
that is something you you have to
understand now let&#39;s fast-forward to the
congressional initiatives which I began
in the mid 90s so I mentioned the
chairman of the House Government Reform
and oversight committee Dan Burton there
was a man many of you who were low
income like myself I was very poor
growing up probably went to college I&#39;m
something called a Pell Grant senator
Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island started
the Pell grants sponsor that bill and he
was at a meeting with the noetic
sciences
Institute and I did a briefing for him
and met with him there and it was very
interesting because here was a very he
was chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee very key committee
foreign relations and he said you know
I&#39;ve wondered about this my entire
career we&#39;ve made enquiries we&#39;ve never
been given any information through
channels and he said would you come to
Washington and do a briefing for my
staff I said well sure anytime I can
come up I was still living in North
Carolina then and he said Oh wonderful
and then I looked at him and I said you
know the Senate or the problem with all
this is that you&#39;re a good man who
should be representing humanity to these
visitors from interstellar civilizations
and you&#39;ve been deprived of dealing with
the ultimate foreign relations issue
interplanetary relations and he looked
at me through his horn-rimmed glasses
and went you know dr. grim afraid you
may be right I said well I am very
poignant moment but that was the way it
was and then I met with a senator dick
Bryan of Nevada whose home state has the
course Nellis Air Force Base and the so
called
area 51 he had no knowledge of these
projects so I met with him and a kind of
a clandestine little meeting at McCarran
Airport in Las Vegas he was flying in I
was flown in put on one of those little
beeping carts taken to something that
looked like a janitor&#39;s closet opened it
up it was a VIP holding area and I met
with the senator and we were talking
about this he said I have never been
told anything about this when we&#39;ve gone
into the secure commitment the skiffs
for the intelligence briefings and so I
provide a briefing to him and it goes on
and on and on and on I mean I mean the
numbers of people I personally briefed
you know of course you know you probably
all know about you know briefing
oh I&#39;m blocking on his name the the
Kucinich who ran for president and no 8
and Kucinich was very interested in this
but he wouldn&#39;t hold a hearing he
even when he was the chairman of the
subcommittee for domestic Government
Reform and oversight he had had a
sighting shirley maclaine outed him
during the campaign and embarrassed him
he&#39;s very supportive of disclosure I
have this in for me I can we stay in
contact but he wouldn&#39;t hold a hearing
