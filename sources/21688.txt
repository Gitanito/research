I
HAVE issued this book in response to the in-
sistent requests of many of my friends and
followers; and the name that I have chosen
for it is one that I have had in mind for many
years as being a fit and appropriate title for a
printed collection of some of my Theosophical
Lectures, delivered at various times and in va-
rious places in the United States and Europe.
The Lectures or Addresses that I have chosen
out of hundreds, for printing together under the
title "The Travail of the Soul," seemed to me
to fall naturally under that name; because they
all deal with different phases of human suffering
and error, out of which I have endeavored to
point a sure Path leading to Light and Peace; and
this Path is the eternal Way of the Spiritual Life.
There is no other true Path, for it is the Path
XX FOREWORD
of Wisdom Unbounded, of the Light of Eternity,
and of Ineffable Peace.
The Lectures are printed practically in full
and almost verbatim from the stenographic records.

THE REAL MAN
TfiE genuine teachings of Theosophy were
1 brought to the western world by H. P. Bla- Genuine
vatsky in 1875. She never presumed to T/teo$oplry
claim them as her own, but declared they were lnou11rt
as old as the ages. After you have read some of 6g H. P.
our literature, you will find out how she received BlatJab/cg
them; and how almost impossible it is to believe in 187S
that, even with the knowledge that s~e had, she
could have accomplished so much in the teaching
of the Ancient Wisdom in her short stay on this
plane. Her remarkable erudition was in ad-
vance of anything that is known in modern
times. This is admitted by some of the greatest
savants of the age. Her monumental books, par-
ticularly The Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled,
set the scientists to wondering and questioning.
H. P. Blavatsky was altogether quite an
unusual woman, phenomenal in a sense, and yet
no more than any other human being would be who
had had her advantages, and, above all things,
3
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
who had the desire to know the truth as she had.
The Real She was a woman of an intensely analytical mind,
Man ever pursuing the path that would lead to Truth;
and when she found it, she brought this great
blessing of Theosophy to the Occident, and to
America first.
I have chosen for my subject this afternoon,
'The Real Man.' Whatever I may say, will be
no reflexion on the men and women of the present
time. The fact that men and women are not
greater than they are and that more is not ac-
complished in the sense of the grand advance-
ment of the human race, is very largely because
real knowledge is lacking.
Thousands of people today, who are doing
their best, trying to lift the sorrows of the world,
have not the key to the situation, which key is
Theosophy; because it places man in an entire-
ly new light.
In the first plac~, never can a Theosophist ac-
cept the idea that man's destiny is limited to one
earth-life. Free the human mind from this limita-
tion; teach man that as a soul he reincarnates again
and again, and you immediately set him on the
4
WAR VERSUS EDUCATION
Path; you give him a grasp of eternity, a gr~at
sweeping picture of his possibilities, with no
impassable limitations.
The differences among men are so marked
all over the world that in the truest sense there is
continual warfare going on; and at any time we
may be overwhelmed with the outer aspects of
war.
There is something wrong with any man who
is ready to encourage war. The brutal side is in
control, when he is ready to kill his brothers.
War is savagery; and because it is accepted by
the sa-called civilized world, this is no proof that
it has the 'favor of God/ so to speak.
It is dreadful to think of the millions that
are spent in preparation for war, and how little
is done to keep our boys and girls from 'going to
the dogs' for the want of that quality of education
that would give them a balance of all the faculties
-physical, mental, moral, and spiritual.
This is not a far-fetched picture - not the
picture of a dreamer; it is an absolute fact.
Mothers and fathers are bringing their children up
with a fear of the possibilities of what may happen
5

Education
Human
Per/ediiJility
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
to those children in the wrong direction, and yet
day by day and year by year they seem to be grow-
ing less competent to ward off the catastrophe.
What promise or surety has a mother of anything
that is permanent in this world for her children, so
long as human beings will encourage warfare?
Theosophy declares that man can attain
perfection. If this is true and feasible, and if
the teachings of Theosophy are applicable, then
we have the possibility of something new happen-
ing for all.
The real man is not some special individual
of unusual and remarkable gifts, who will lead
you to the heights. The real man is he who is
conscious of his own essential divinity and acts
accordingly. This divinity is a power that
shows to every man the god in himself; that
brings home to the minds of men and women the
fact that, being immortal souls and parts of the
great scheme of eternal life, they have sacred
duties to perform.
So, instead of expecting the real man to come
from some unexpected quarter, heralded by the
angels, let us look for him even in our midst,
6
HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS EVERYWHERE
wherever we may be; because it is possible for
any.man to have the knowledge of his own essen- Hutn11n lm·
tial divinity; and once he has that, he has a key perfediom
that opens up his whole nature. It carries him EtJerywhere
out into such an atmosphere and realm of thought,
into such a breadth of vision, that he no longer
accepts the limitations that were his yesterday.
Theosophists are striving to give to man the
knowledge of his spiritual heritage, of his right to
live as a soul, to stand strong and true and perfect
-not all in one lifetime, oh no! It takes many
goings and comings, many reincarnations.
This morning I looked out over the blue
Pacific, saw its beauty, felt the touch of its
wonderful appeal, and I asked myself, what does
man get out of life? Everything is so imperfect,
so uncertain, at the present time. People find
themselves disappointed not only in themselves,
but in their nearest friends. Sometimes it is
a shock.
All over the world we see degradation, dissi-
pation, and the deathly forces that are at work
upon the youth right at hand- at our very door,
so to speak. For proof of this, all one has to do
7
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
is to read the daily papers or walk along the street
Theo&ophg and make ordinary observation of those who
Giou a pass him. Is not this something to think of?
Ner.o Vi&ion Once man becomes conscious of his own
essential divinity, that he is a part of the eternal
scheme of life, and holds to this state of con-
sciousness in faith and absolute confidence, he
opens up his whole nature and finds a revelation
within himself. Where he was weak, he becomes
strong; where he was ignorant, he acquires know-
ledge; where he had the limited idea of one life,
he has the conception of many lives; and so on.
·He is in himself an epitome of life.
All the best books in the world cannot give
to man the knowledge that he has within him-
self, right within his own heart.
-Theosophy opens up for people a new vision
of life. In their enthusiasm for and appreciation
of what it has done for them, many have changed
their lives in a remarkable degree. They are
challenged to be true and faithful to the divine
qualities of their natures; they learn that nothing
is lost in the divine economy, and that all of us
belong to Deity's great family. No matter how
8
THEOSOPHY GIVES A NEW VISION
disappointed or discouraged we rnay be, let us
remember that we all belong to that great family.
Let us accept the fact that there is not a
moment's time to be spent, then, in the question:
"Is this right or wrong?" The real Man knows
what is right and wrong. He is inspired; he is
affected to such a degree that if you could look
into the inner part of his being, you would find
the very atoms of his blood going through changes.
The whole constitution of his life is changing, so
that he is no longer the same man he was yesterday.
He is ready to accept anything and everything
that is right, that he may live the life, that he
may become, that he may win the victory and
be the living example for all men.
This message is so direct and straight that it
can be taken up by the poorest, the most unhappy.
It is found in the teachings of Theosophy.
Now, if these teachings were some new-
fangled fad, I would wonder at anybody believing
them, because there are so many isms, and odd
things, and mad, imaginary, and distressing doc-
trines brought out today. But Theosophy is
older than all other teachings. It is the parent-
9
Tire Anti-
quity of
Tlaeo.plty
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
teaching of all religions; and it was lived and
worked out for the salvation or the advancement
of man ages upon ages of years before Jesus Christ
was born.. Think what a conception we can
find just in this idea!
To the man who has heretofore accepted the
one-life theory, imagine what a picture these
teachings open up! What proofs he has of the
mysteries of life, the wonderful mysteries in Na-
ture! And how little we know of them! How
little we know of the momentous questions Who
we are, Whence we come, Whither we go!
One can get no conception- of these profound
mysteries unless he has Theosophy; but when
one has Theosophy, there is an 'at-home-ness'
about it. There is more alertness of mind; there is
a warmth and a glow in life; the sun is shining all
the time; the heart is beating to the harmonies
of Being, and one is not striving and working for
himself alone.
The beautiful part of it is, that one strives
then for all humanity. He has not to know all
humanity, nor to be recognised by all humanity.
But if he is living to serve humanity, he is writing
10
THE ANTIQUITY OF THEOSOPHY
down in the very atmosphere in which he lives,
the foundation and basic thoughts that every
man should have: that man is his own redeemer,
and, as I have said over a~d over again, that he
either blesses or curses his own life, according
to his choice; because man has all choice.
Man lacks in knowledge in many ways, be-
cause he has had only faith; but not until he
reaches a certain point of knowledge can he avoid
the extreme, imaginary, and foolish ideas every-
where current today. Such a man will not be
flooded with the spirit of the age - for this is not a
desirable age.
But what one man can be, all men can be.
There is no need ofwaiting until tomorrow to begin,
nor of depending upon a so-called new-coming
'Messiah,' or any of that nonsense, that is being
taught by certain pseudo-theosophists. Real Theo-
sophists are waiting only for each man to find the
Christos-spirit in himself, by himself, in the silence
of his own heart, in the inner chamber of his
own life.
I am misunderstood very much because I
always declare that I think that man has a more
11
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
difficult task than woman. I never had any-
Man's Tas~ body teach this to me, but I have always held it
More Jif- to be a fact; because a man has to face more
ficult than. varied and trying environments, while perhaps the
Woman's woman can stay protected. He has to meet un-
certainties and impositions; and he has, alas! little
time for spiritual thinking. He is rushing hither
and thither in the great psychological fever of the
age, and ever facing the bread-and-butter ques-
tion and his daily responsibilities.
Look at the youth of today! A few years
ago, they were little innocent children. Look
at them today as you see them on the street:
the girls with painted cheeks and the boys with
hands in their pockets, slouching along carelessly.
These exemplify the facts that we have to meet.
We do not have to go to Europe or anywhere else
to see them. We can go even into our own towns
and see the devastation, and the degradation,
and the awful pressure that is brought upon the
youth particularly, because ofthe lack of that inner
knowledge which young and old should possess.
If we wish to bring humanity to something
new and better, let us accentuate more than
12
ACCENTUATE MAN'S ESSENTIA~ DIVINITY
ever the idea of man's essential divinity. After
a while we shall become used to hearing about it! Accentuate
Let me take as an example a man whose Man'$
life has not been flooded with the influences of &8enlial
the age, who has risen above them, and is stand- Dioinity
ing out conscious of these things that I have
told you about. The very fact that he is aspiring
is a wonderful thing. But we can aspire and
aspire, and if we do not act, it is of little use.
But if a man takes up every duty as conscien-
tiously as he would if he were to die tomorrow
and be 'brought to the judgment-seat,' so to
speak, how different life would be!
But men do not seem to do enough thinking.
Even among the greatest scholars, they seem to
pull off just a little. One wonders at this. They
touch the fringe of truth, but they touch it so
delicately and so fearsomely, lest they lose their
prestige or lose their salaries! One cannot tell
what they are afraid of losing. But they cannot
be fully sincere; they cannot live the life thus,
under the pressure of the hour, and of man's inhu-
.
mantty to man.
But the real man that I speak of has the
13
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
courage of his convictions. He is determined to
look into what is said about Theosophy. He
analyses it; and before he knows it, he is in it;
and when he is in it, he cannot get out of it; it
becomes a living part of him. Where different
attributes of his nature were weakened or ener-
vated or negative, they become positive and
strong, through the application of the human mind
to the realization that man is essentially divine,
and being essentially divine, that he has potent
inner qualities, which we seem not to know much
about. But man can be eternally seeking them,
eternally aspiring, eternally advancing. And if
he is, of course the records are being imprinted
continually in his own inner nature.
These records are not imprinted by telling
him and assuring him of his growth and praising
him at all. But he realizes that he has begun
to think in a new way: that most of the thinking
he did before was just surface-thinking. He never
took time to think deeply into his own nature:
he never knew anything about his higher states
of consciousness; he never applied his mind to
the possibility that there are more worlds than
14
ACCENTUATE MAN'S ESSENTIAL DIVINITY
one, that there are thousands and millions of
worlds, and countless·ages before us and behind us.
He is no longer satisfied with merely mental ac-
tivity. He goes above it. He pushes on in his
investigation, to strengthen his life, to purify it,
to beautify it, and to perfect it.
When he touches Theosophy and has this
consciousness of something divine in him, some-
thing he cannot go away from, it is so absolutely
fascinating that he commences to train el"ery
part of his nature.
A revelation comes to him - not a revela-
tion in the sense that many might imagine, but
it is a conscious power. He reaches another state
of consciousness. When he reaches this state,
he is likely at first to be confused, to doubt;
because he has not yet reached the full state or
the better state, which every one can reach in
this one life. Not until he reaches the third de-
gree of thinking can the confusion and doubts
vanish. I cannot say anything further than this
now about this third degree; but there is still
another degree.
How easy it is to compare this inner develop-
IS
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
ment with the study of music! When you started
to learn your notes, did you ever dream for a good

run up and down the scales and play a few simple
pieces? You did not expect to find yourselfcoming
out before the public as known musicians. And
it is the same with all classes of men, who work
in that way. They work on one line.
But the real Man works on all lines. First he
·makes his physical body a fitting house for his spiri-
tual soul,- the immortal man. He keeps himself
pure and clean and strong, not only in the outward
sense, but he keeps his inner life so as well.
Then he realizes that for thousands of years
men's minds have been weighed down with teach-
ings that are impossible to accept in the light of
reason. He realizes further that he has not here-
tofore reasoned deeply about them; he has let
others do his reasoning for him.
He passes through this and reaches another
state ofconsciousness, where the higher soul speaks,
where the immortal man speaks. He receives
the light of the living power that is in each of you,
from the smallest to the greatest, from the weakest

there is no aloneness any more; there is the
realization of the higher state of consciousness,-
the consciousness of the companionship of the
gods, so to speak. That is not an extravagant
statement to make.
I have never had any children of my own;
but I have seen very beautiful children: I have
looked into the eyes of a little innocent child,
and at such times I have felt that if I could have
been entirely true to myself in other lives, and
if I had had even the knowledge that I have
now, that child could, without a word, without a
sermon, but just by its presence and in its eyes or
its manners, reveal to me many of the secrets oflife.
I believe many of these children come pre-

hear them. Instead, we commence to train them
just as grandfather or great-grandfather did, ac-
cording to a certain system. We do not give
them any chances at all.
And so they grow up. And then you blame
them afterwards when they are all out of tune;
when things go wrong! After a while some of
them may be so far off the track that they go to
prison, and a few of them are hanged! Isn't it
pitiful? They are not wholly to blame. We can-
not blame anybody or anything except ourselves!
And even in doing this, we should not bring
ourselves to embarrassment, but rather should we
feel the importance of reaching the Light, of
pushing our way along the Path until we reach
the heights, and know the Truth, and become!
Real life is joy, . even here on this earth.
If you do not find the joy of life, that is your
own fault.
You mothers must make new conditions for

godlike qualities of your own nature that will

your friends desert you, and when everything
goes wrong. That wonderful inner power is the
treasure of your life and of your future lives.
It is the high spiritual treasure of humanity.
That is why I am so enthusiastic. It is quite
impossible to be anything else, with the know-
ledge of Theosophy pointing out the way.
My words come too fast for me to do justice
to my subject. No one can bring that state of
consciousness to you, nor give it to you at all.
We have been told: "Seek, and ye shall find."
I can do so little that I am often ashamed, when
I come to speak, that I cannot say more to you.
I feel this inner touch, but I cannot say too much,
lest you misunderstand.
But let me assure you, that if you are trying
to refashion your lives and the future of your
children, study Theosophy! You do not have
to join our Society. But get the facts! Do not
listen to what other people say to you! Study the

try to give you that which is nearest to our own
souls, the most sacred, the most beautiful, and
the most helpful things.
Have some conception of the nature of a real
Man or a real Woman! It is not so far away from
any one, if those who have aspirations can try to
reach the point of believing in themselves, ignoring
all the old conceptions of fear and dread of punish-
ment, of hell and death, and look upon them
in another way.
Consider death as the most divine phase of
life! This brings home to you something that
nothing else can. Those w~o are tired and think,
perhaps, they are nearing the end of life, let them
realize that theirs is a glorious prospect. I envy
them.
Death is wonderful! When the old coat -
the body that you have had to wear in order to
keep yourself together in your mortal life - is
about to be changed, do not believe that the great,
eternal, Source of Light and Life, is going to give
you less privileges than just every-day nature
has. Even the trees 'reincarnate,' so to speak.

TJIE subject I have chosen is "The Real Woman

If one is at all eager to learn something
from Theosophy and the meaning of these temple-
talks, it is important that he should realize from
what viewpoint he approaches and judges them.
For if one is satisfied with life as it is, if one has
t:to protest to make concerning conditions as they
are, if one's own life is filled with seeming joy and
happiness, I would hardly expect to see such
a one here.
I think that most of those who come here are
of inquiring mind. They have touched life in
its different phases; they have had their shadows
and their disappointments and their heartac.hes
and their suffering; and they erave the Light.
So possibly we might say that you who are
present this afternoon are really earnest inquirers,
seekers for more knowledge and more light.

And if you are all in that state of mind, even the
little that I may say ought to leave some im-
pressions with you that will turn your minds to
further investigation.
And when you have made this, then you will
have answers to your questions. You will have
explanations of many things which you do not
understand now, answers to questions that have
never been answered before. Life's Whys and
Wherefores will be explained. And then of course
you will have a wonderfully clear knowledge -
as far as you can gain knowledge in one lifetime -
of the meaning of existence, whence you come,
and whither you go, and so forth.
Consider for a moment the man whose mind
is quite settled that this one earth-life is all that
there is of human existence, that there is a special
place called heaven somewhere in the skies, where
his soul will rest for all eternity,- one who has
been educated or has taught himself to believe
that his sins can be forgiven to the extent that
he can escape the consequences ofhis own thoughts
and deeds, and that his mistakes can be wiped
out by a death-bed confession and repentance, etc.,
26
THE TRUTH WITHIN
-why, you will .find that such ·a man is not
searching· for Truth. One cannot say that that
mind is satisfied, but it is not seeking, it is not
alert. And certainly never in the last few cen-
turies was there such a time as the present in
which to find the Truth.
Once you find the Truth, you possess a know-
ledge that is wonderful and powerful. You will
find it within your own natures. If you wish
verification of what I tell you, all you have to do
is to read some of. the things that Jesus has
told you. Did he not say that the kingdom of
heaven is within you?
So we Theosophists not only educate our-
selves aqd our listeners to a nobler conception
of the outer, material life of a human being,
but we are also taught to seek knowledge of
the inner life.
One might very readily ask: ''What is all
this about? There are so many teachers who tell
us of this and that theory, which they them-
selves have evolved."
But this knowledge that we Theosophists bring
to you is not our invention. H. P. Blavatsky, the
27
Within
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
great foundress of our Society, in no sense claimed
the teachings as her own. It is the knowledge
of the ages, it is the Ancient Wisdom, that was
taught and lived thousands of ages before Jesus
Christ's time.
One of the great objects of our Organiza-
tion is to teach man to know himself.
I have read a great deal in my life; I have
a large library, and I have acquaintances of
great culture, but no one can answer the· ques-
tions that my soul demands except Theosophy.
So, because I am so sure of it; because my heart
is so faithful to it; my soul is stirred to de-
clare these truths to the world. This is why
I am here: because I know that these truths
belong to every human soul.
If for the last eight or ten centuries humanity
had been taught its spiritual heritage; if it knew
that it was essentially divine in nature; that it
had within itself the power of accomplishing so
much on the line of self-eonquest, man could
not move away from the fact of Reincarnation,-
that the soul of man lives not just one life, but
many, many lives; and on its path of self-directed
28
THE TllUTH WITHIN
evolution, it gains the knowledge that is neces-
sary to perfect man.
The perfectibility of man is one of the fun-
damental teachings of Theosophy.
As most of you are not familiar with Theo-
sophy, let me reason with you. If you were, I
could tell you many things that are very wonder-
ful and beautiful and true; but now, you might
think them far-fetched.
So I will merely ask you how any human
being can have any conception of the greatness of
life or of its grandeur, or how any human mind can
conceive of Deity as we speak of Deity- All-
Loving, All-Powerful, All-Knowing, the Great
Central Source of Life and Light- if he accepts
the idea of only the one earth-life, if he accepts
the idea of a personal, punishing God, and unless
he accepts the idea that there are many thou-
sands of worlds more than this.
Reasoning from this viewpoint, one finds him-
self questioning: Where am I? Who am I?
In taking up my subject, I will have to intro-
duce a type of woman, who has studied Theo-
sophy and applied it to her every-day life so
29
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
assiduously, and faithfully, and understandingly,
The Real and hopefully, that life is beautiful to her, it is
Woman joy to her; and she has the wisdom to know that
if it is not so to others, it is because they have
not yet found the key to the essential know-
ledge which any human being can have.
Such a wo,nan, growing up under the care
and tuition of parents who are also good Theo-
sophists, will be a different type of woman from
most women that you meet today. Her life will
be so rich and full of service to humanity, that
she will have no time to spend in pushing herself
into a position of importance. She has no dis-
position to throw herself before the public.
But with her knowledge of the inner teachings,
which carry her through this world of perplexities,
she is more inclined to be the simple woman,
the true, noble-hearted, broad-minded, cultured
woman. And the more knowledge she has~ the
more beautiful and the more simple she becomes.
This is the type of woman we should have every-
where throughout the world.
Why do we find so few of this type? Why
do we have so many isms, so many doctrinal
30
"JUDGE NOT, THAT YE BE NOT JUDGED,
idiosyncrasies and false teachings? Because we
have been brought up from our infancy and child-
hood with false ideas.
There may have been a disposition on the
part of our parents to have us be good.
But how can a man be true to his higher
nature, how can he have the knowledge of his
inner nature and his great possibilities, until he
knows himself? Of course he cannot immediately
know himself in fullness, because the acquirement
of knowledge is a gradual process; and it is im-
possible to gain all knowledge in one lifetime.
But the first step is to live closely to the
conviction that man is essentially divine, and
that knowledge and power lie within himself. He
may be poor and hungry and homeless; he may be
misunderstood; you might even find him in prison
-and, indeed, I have found men in prison who
were innocent and should not be there. So there
can be no harsh censure on the part of a Theoso-
phist against the man who makes his mistakes.
One must not censure. One cannot censure
his fellow-men and face his conscience. It is
impossible. The greater the suffering, and the
31
..juJge not,
that ye
6e not
juJgeJ"
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
greater the sin, and the greater the mistakes that
we see our fello~ human-beings making or en-
during, the larger should be our charity, the
fuller and richer should be our compassion.
So a Theosophist who is studying these teach-
ings seriously should strive to make them an actual
part of his or her life, thus making every day
tell for some advancement, every real duty per-
formed as a sacred obligation; and no matter
how small, it must be rightly done. Then the
days fly by and one is at peace at all times.
And while there may be compassion and
heartache for those who are suffering and have
not the light, there is such soul-energy, there is
such inner power, radiating from one like him
I speak of, that he is not resting nor fully at
peace in his soul, until all his strength, health,
and life are given towards making the Path clear
for all.
We should waste no time in grieving over our
own mistakes; for every moment is precious.
And nothing is lost in this wonderful economy
of life. The influence of every good thought
and every good deed remains with us forever.
32
SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF HER OWN NATURE
The girl or young woman I have spoken of
is brought up to believe in her own essential SoltJing the
divinity, her spiritual nature. She knows that Mystery of
no matter how many books she may have studied, her own
nor how many teachers she has had, nor how Nature
great her gifts or her discernment, there is still
something more that she must study; and that
is, the mystery of her own nature. And when
rightly studied, this mystery proves really to be
very simple and very beautiful. She will find
much light thrown on it in our Theosophical
books, especially those of H. P. Blavatsky, who
brought the Ancient Wisdom to us.
When you know more of her teachings, they
will not seem strange at all. You will see how
natural they are. You will say, "How odd that
I had not known of them before." This has
very often been my experience with people who
have tried almost everything until they found
Theosophy. And as they advance, they find in
Theosophy the large liberality of thought that
satisfies mind and soul.
You know we have no competition for honors
in our Society. And we make no efforts to convert
33
THE TllAVAlL OF THE SOUL
our listeners. We have no right to allow our
minds to influence others in the way of compell-
ing them to believe as we do or to act as we
dictate. Our duty is to give the simple teachings
of Theosophy, and trust that they may be under-
stood and applied. That is all we can ask.
Suppose this typical young girl I speak of
has reached the age of sixteen years. She knows
about herself; she has studied Theosophy;· she
knows about the divine quality of her nature;
and in her character, her looks, and in her life, .
there is something quite unusual, very beautiful
and inspiring.
She is an innocent girl in the truest and
deepest sense. You would not find her studying
the fashion-plates, painting her face, or wearing
the shortest dresses that fashion permits. She
would not be out rushing into the glamor and
unrest of the world.
You would probably find her spending a good
portion of her time at home with her parents,
improving her mind by study, and performing
her duties there. If father was doing his duty
and mother was doing hers, that is where daughter
34
ON THE THRESHOLD OF MARRIAGE
would be. She would be building up the home-
center, putting something of a spiritual quality On the
into it that we must have, if we are ever to find ThruholJ of
peace and rest. Ma"iage
The girl I am speaking of is living for the
tomorrow. Her vision is so broad and so large,
that she is not satisfied with the knowledge she
has already acquired. She seeks a little more
every day. As she grows older in knowledge,
she grows younger in spirit.
And when the time comes in her association
with her friends that some one seeks her com-
panionship as a wife, the girl who has had the
influence of a Theosophical education from child-
hood in her home, with the example she has
had from her father and mother, would have the
intuition to say No, unless that man carried within
himself, in his very atmosphere,- not just in
his speech, nor his position, nor his wealth- an
indescribable something that was akin to her own.
These teachings, when they come into the
lives of the old or the young, are very protective.
They develop one's inner knowledge. This is
not a thing of imagination. It is just as real
35
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
as anything else in life. It can be found out by
Building each one for himself, through his own study and
1M /Jeal advancement. It is a great light on the Path.
Home Perhaps the next ma.n who crosses the path
of my typical girl will be one of her own kind.
Perhaps his father and mother had not only the
love of their child that all parents have, but they
had also made their home exceptionally beautiful.
Perhaps they felt not only the sacred responsi-
bility that nearly every father and mother feel,
but they had a deeper knowledge of what their
duties and responsibilities were; they were wise
enough to know that that child was not all their
own, but part of the great divine scheme, placed
in their keeping to learn, to progress, to evolve,
and to become.
Such a man would be really akin to the
ideal girl I have spoken of. So let us follow
the united lives of these two.
They love home, and they give to their
home the wonderful charm, the divine quality
that comes into being when two such souls are
living together. And if they know, even to a
degree, that the inner life is the indestructible
36
BUILDING THE IDEAL HOME
life, the divine life, they do not settle down to
make their house so much their own, that they
give all their time and all their lives to the con-
ventional idea of merely building a home.
They begin first to build spiritually- not
by anything magical or supernatural, but be-
cause they have found the inner secret of soul-
enlightenment, that comes to every human being
who makes himself ready to receive it.
This ideal woman and ideal man. are not
building their home just for the community, not
just for the state, not just for the country; they
are building for all humanity. Their breadth of
vision and the enlightenment they have found
in their studies bring home to them the fact that
we are all of one divine and great family.
So they make their home beautiful. They
are naturally refined; they are cultured; they
are pure and they are clean. All true students
,
of Theosophy become that way. And let me
assure you, that no ma:tter what splendid types
of parents we may find in the world today,
and in our past history, there is something new
and inspiring in the Theosophical conception
37
The Coming
ChilJ
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
of preparation for marriage and parenthood.
It is not difficult to believe that the two
I have spoken of have given perhaps a little
more thought to the coming child. This is no
reflexion on present-day mothers and fathers.
I wonder that these do as well as they do, with-
out the knowledge of Theosophy. But my two
ideal parents feel their responsibility, in that
the gods have given them a treasure - not a
treasure to hold, and bind, and confine, and con-
trol, but a treasure on which they can pour out
their hearts and which can evoke something
divine in their own lives as the three grow to-
gether in the sanctity of this beautiful home.
You know Jesus said, "Where two or three
are gathered together in my name, there am I
in the midst of them."
And believe me, dear comrades, this is pos-
sible even in one life, with the basis of a splendid
evolution, magnificent conquests, grand achieve-
ments, and the "glory of God," so to speak,
in their lives, when they have worked together
in harmony and thrown themselves back into
the consciousness of their higher natures.
38
THE BALANCED EDUCATION
One cannot work this out with his brain-
mind alone. If he did, he would make it all Tlae ·
brain, and no heart and soul. The brain, of Balanced
course, has its place; it must be educated and Education
cared for as a useful instrument. But there
must also be intuition. And the two that I
have spoken of will have it.
Can you not conceive that their child will
bring into the world something a little different,
perhaps a little better than 1J10St children have
a chance to bring?
This child will be taught, and will know
instinctively, that the body is the temple of the
soul; that it is sacred and that it must be kept
pure and clean and healthy, so as to be able
to work in .consonance with a harmonious life.
It will soon .learn that its mentality also re-
quires attention. That education will begin
coming from the parents in a most delicate, in-
direct, and impersonal way.
And as the body grows in the glory of life
and in vigor and health, the conceptions of the
mind grow larger. Nature assumes a different
aspect for us. We know that the children can
39
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
learn to love Nature as we never loved it. We
HereJitg can believe that in the lessons of Nature are to
anJ be found the essence of the proofof Reincarnation.
Intuition As that child grows up, it is not satisfied
with ordinary scholastic education. Day by day
it seeks more and more knowledge of the spiritual
life, without in any sense neglecting the duties
of the outer life.
The parents are not dreamers nor fanatics.
They are splendidly balanced; and so they give
to their child a splendid balance of the physical,
the mental, the moral, and the spiritual educa-
tion. One need not be surprised if the result
is something ahead of the commonplace.
I do not believe that anybody in this world
today, who has lived only as long as I, has studied
the question of heredity more than I have. I
have studied it from the standpoint of my Theo-
sophical investigations.
The mind has a true power of willing. If I
were the mother of a child, it would depend
very much upon me, what that child would be
from its very conception. And if I have in-
grained into that child some of my secret weak-
40
HEREDITY AND INTUITION
nesses, some of my insincerities or my failures,
it is more than likely that that child will show
similar hereditary tendencies.
But now let us go back to the ideal mother
and father, who, in bringing up their child, have
shown the power of the will - the mental will
and the spiritual will. With the knowledge of
Theosophy, with this intuition that I have
spoken of, this ideal wife was full of reflexion
while she was carrying this child; she analysed
herself. It was self-study all along the way-
not with fear and trembling, but with that rare
confidence that Theosophy gives to those who
study it seriously.
Hereditary tendencies can be overcome. I
have had some remarkable experiences in study-
ing heredity in little children, where there was
very little on either side of the house that would
honor the children. Yet I have seen some such
children rising and rising, under proper teaching,
until they had overcome hereditary obstacles.
And this power is aroused by evoking the qualities
of the inner man, the higher nature- that quali-
ty ofintuition, which is above the mere brain-mind.
41
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
Once in a while we read of people having
very wonderful experiences. We Theosophists
do not follow visions or dreams, or anything of
that sort; but sometimes remarkable things have
happened to advanced ·men and women, and they
have performed marvels. And when these things
have been accomplished, they were the expres-
sions of the higher natures of those who did them.
It is this quality of intuition, which inspires
our great artists, our great musicians, our great
scientists and inventors, when they reach the
heights and do the grand acts of achievement
that the world acknowledges. And this quality
of intuition is just as accessible to all of us as is
the .air we breathe. But we must 'be ready.
. Our minds must be purified. We must have
some conception of the possibility of knowing
more in future than we do now. And when we
reach that point, the book of life is open to us-
the revelations of our own experiences.
And if the ideal lovely woman and her
splendid noble husband that I have spoken of
can reach this point of achievement, can over-
come heredity· in just one life, think what two
42
HEREDITY AND INTUITION
such going along the path of self-directed evolu-
tion would do for humanity! And if children
were born to them, they would be different
types from what we have now.
Here, then, for the present, we may leave
the real man and woman still living and serving.

I
REALIZE the enormous corruption, immorali-

flooded today. People may live their indi- Humanity's
vidual lives quite separated, to a degree, from Promise
the world's chaos and confusion, and endeavor
to lift themselves out of the mire and breathe
the fresh air of truth; but it must be very difficult
to span the gap.
There is a greater and deeper meaning to
life than is generally understood. Theosophy
gives the explanation of life's deeper meaning;
it gives the enlightenment and the real know-
ledge that every man should have. I therefore
approach my subject from the standpoint of
Theosophy, which I represent.
The real child or youth is humanity's promise
for the future. We must, of course, consider
this child as being born to the real man and
the real woman of whom I have already spoken,
who were living the real life in a promtstng en-

vironment, with at least partial understanding.
Their lives were very true, noble, and beautiful;
they were excellent examples to all.
I shall make very little attempt to treat of
the outer man, who lives entirely in the dollar-
and-eent world, and considers this one life the
only one; because his ideas are very limited with
regard to the divine scheme of existence. But,
rath~r, I shall speak more of the inner man.
It is an ancient teaching that the child should
be cared for from its very conception- that there
should be preparation for the incoming soul.
Those mothers who have talked most serious-
ly to me on the subject, and who. seem to have
the greatest concern for the welfare of their
children, tell me that they are not well satisfied
with the little that they have in their hearts and
minds, with no basis upon which to work. This
basis Theosophy gives.
We Theosophists accept the child as having
been born into this world many times before.
We believe in Reincarnation. We consider that
the child is a glorious, Heaven-sent gift to the
real man and woman; but the gift is not so ex-
48
ETERNAL LOVE, THE UNIVERSAL IDEA
elusively theirs that the child is outside the work-
ings of the divine laws and the wonderful natural
laws that are always acting.
The mother should be the real teacher from
the time the child is conceived; and from then
on, if the child is placed in the proper environ-
ment and has the proper education - both spiri-
tual and worldly, in the right degree,- that child
has the promise of amounting to something, in
the truest sense of the word - of being an example
of prohity, sincerity, and virtue.
Neither you nor I could exist if there had
not been some starting-point- some great uni-
versal idea. And this universal idea is Love -
Eternal Love.
Before the child is born, the real mother has
confidence in her husband, because he is walking
on the same path as herself in self-directed evolu-
tion. There is no half-way loving, because they
are both living the real life and finding happiness
and peace.
These two that I speak of believe in the
essential divinity of man. They know that their
child is, in the deepest part of its being, a soul.

So they have a rare treasure placed in their
care. They know that it has two natures in
one being; that the outer, flesh-house, the mortal
part that we can all see and love, is capable of
great development even in one lifetime; but that
their child's full advancement and progress in
this life cannot take place if it is eternally con-
fronted with only the environment of the outer
man and has little if any touch of the inner.
I am confident that many mothers, in the
deepest recesses of their nature, in their silent
moments and unuttered feelings, do come very
close to some of the sublime truths of the inner
life, without being able to explain them. But
Theosophy offers the explanation.
The home of the real man and woman that
I have spoken of is of a rare quality, built on
spiritual and inner forces as well as outer. There
the mother has a basis on which she can work.
She guards her thoughts from the time when
the child is conceived. She builds high ideals
into her thought-life before the child is born.
Without this inner spiritual knowledge that
I speak of, the key to the child's future is missing;
50
THE SACREDNESS OF EXPECTANT MOTHERHOOD
and. when its dear little eyes look out into the
world, telling all humanity of the godlike things TheSacred-
it has brought, it gets no answer, save perhaps nus of
from the innermost recesses of the mother's heart; Expedanl
for she is the creator, the one who is molding that Mot/zer/aooJ
character, possibly for glorious achievements and
superb victories in self-conquest.
How lovely children are even in their mis-
chief and their little difficulties! How marvelous-
ly more so would they be in rounding out the
spiritual nature under the guidance of .. the real
mother and father, who are not only the care-
takers, but the watchful angels!
In the ancient days that I have· so often
spoken of, the expectant mother was not under
the pressure of the annoyances and trials of every-
day life. She had a sacred obligation to perform,
a tremendous, sacred right. She was about to
receive the gods, so to speak. So she spent her
time quite separated from the many unnecessary
associations and pressures that bind the woman
down to the every-day life of care and perplexities
and anxieties. The husband understood that it
was to be so. Thus the nurture and education
51
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
of the child began even before it was born, in
preparation by both father and mother.
An obtuse mind might not accept this; but
the thinking mind cannot but see that there ia
something in it.
Try to look at the word-picture I have made,
in the same spirit that you would approach a
glorious and magnificent painting by one of our
greatest artists. How you would then be lifted
out of your every-day selves!
It does not matter how poor a mother is
nor how many struggles she may have; she can
conceive of such a picture by throwing herself
into her own sacred thought-realm, where the
very silence will be full of music, and beautiful
surroundings, and golden promises.
This is not my story; it is the story of the
ancient wisdom, and the story of the inner life
of the mother. The mother and father who
follow this path find the joy of life, and their
greatest joy is in having the power to give en-
lightenment to their child.
How many of our children and our young
men and women do we prepare to meet life's
52
THEOSOPHY OPENS THE DOOR. TO MAN'S SOUL
battles? Alas! All down the ages we have been
educated almost entirely in the outer life. The Tlaeosop/zg
inner life has scarcely been considered at all; Opem the
and so the real things are not accomplished; the Door to
great results do not come. If they did, the world Man's Soul
would not be as it is today; we would not have
so much crime, distress, suffering, and vice.
If the child has been prepared through the
rounding out of its character, so that its soul
can breathe the invigorating fresh air of the eter-
nal life, when it reaches the age which most
parents realize is the time of greatest temptation
for it, that boy or girl will not only be practical,
sensible, pure and good, but you will find it the
strong boy or girl, who can resist temptation.
Such a one is wonderfully protected for the whole
of its future; is not bewildered nor misled, and
has, even in its early years, a comparatively clear
insight into its possihilities.
Theosophy opens the door to the soul of
man, that he may live in the truest sense and
may discover within himself the power to over-
come and to become.
If you had seen all that I have seen, while
53
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
working in the prisons and the penitentiaries, of
the awful mistakes that have been made through
ignorance, you would work perhaps harder even
than I do, and you would feel still more the
agonizing cry of the world, because humanity
lacks the essential teachings that will help man
to know himself.
The spiritual man takes in the needs of the
outer life, adapts himself to it, does -not run
away from it, but goes through it victorious.
He is able to lift the burdens of humanity, and
to teach men by the beauty and simplicity of
his own life.
When you have followed up the teachings
of Theosophy, you will find that they are the
panacea for all the difficulties and trials of life,
as well as their explanation.
What is wanted in the world today is balance.
Extreme measures on any line generally bring
reaction, chaos and confusion, and deep, deep
-regrets.
No man can know himself until he recognises
his own inner divinity. Without this he is like a
ship at sea without a rudder. No man can become
54
THEOSOPHY OPENS THE DOOR TO MAN'S SOUL
a real father, a real benefactor to his country,
nor a real honor to his family and himself, if
he does not know something about the laws
governing his inner nature, pointing to the essen-
tial divinity of man.
The members of the Universal Brotherhood
and Theosophical Society are teaching the pure,
true, sweet Theosophy, just as H. P. Blavatsky
taught it, and just as it was given to her by her
Teachers; and this Theosophy has in it much
that will lift humanity's burdens. It explains
the meaning of life; shows man his true heritage;
brings that enlightenment that every human be-
ing should have, if he wishes to do justice to his
soul and to his own essentially divine nature.

SELF-ANALYSIS
S
ELF-ANALYSIS is one of the phases of
thought that is least accentuated in human The Sours
life. We eagerly pass judgment on our Longing for
neighbors. We are quite ready to criticize and Frwlom
to 'place' our great writers and the bogus ones.
We read almost innumerable papers, magazines,
stories, and books that are useless to us. But
self-analysis is nowhere found as a practical feature
of human life.
A man is heavily in the shadows if he has not
been taught, or if he has not found out for himself,
that he is essentially a spiritual being, that his
soul is alive with superb possibilities. The hunger
of his heart tells the story of how the soul longs
for real freedom. How it is seeking recognition!
How it is trying to find its place, to become more
and more intelligent, and better informed! How
it seeks knowledge of facts in place of mere beliefs!
Another cannot give you what you own your-
self. Self-analysis is the secret of coming into
59
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
your own. Examine yourself! Do not be satisfied
with today or with the books you read or with
the half-living that you call life! Dream yourself
out into your greater possihilities! Visualize the
future- if only a single year ahead! Day by
day gain knowledge through self-examination,
through the realization that man is spiritually
immortal, through the royal dignity of the high-
er soul. ·
Remember that this little span of seventy-
seven or a hundred years is only a step in the
progress that you as souls are about to make.
When you do this, you can look back at your
sorrows and trials and see that some of them
were merely necessary experiences in your evolu-
tion. And some of the things that you con-
sidered injustices you will find seemed such, he-
cause you looked at effects only and not at causes.
When you find yourself in that state, how broad,
how liberal, how magnificent, how splendid, you
will be in the realization of the knowledge that
bespeaks you as immortal!
Examine yourselves! Question the eternal
laws of life! Ascertain the secret of the many
60
THE SOUL'S LONGING FOR FREEDOM
riddles and problems which confront you! Why
do our souls respond to the grander notes of
music? Why are we carried away with the glory
of the sun, the fragrance of the flowers, and the
beauty of all that Nature offers? Because then
we are nearer the spiritual side of ourselves.
Even if you cannot live up to your highest
feelings, you touch the fringe of great truths in
your aspirations; and when these are registered,
the answer must come in time.
Find the Higher Self through self-analysis!
To find the immortal self, the divinity in man, is
to open up for yourself a new existence, a new
vision, a grand and superb symphony of life,
singing all the time, though your ears rnay be
deaf and your eyes cannot see. But within is
the rising, surging, pulsating power of the soul,
which tells the story of the eternity of man and
his vast p<;>ssibilities.
A man cannot be a Theosophist unless he is
a thinker- unless he has reached a point where
he is not satisfied with what he has been taught
and tried to believe. His unrest has turned him
in the direction of investigation, and in his search
61
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
for truth, he has found Theosophy. In finding
In Firulinf Theosophy, he has found himself.
Thet)$0phy, If a man has no more conception of the deep-
Man FinJ1 er things of life than mere brain-mind argument
HinuJf can give him, and if he is limited to the belief in
one short earth-life of seventy-seven or a hundred
years, his power of self-analysis is very small.
Real self-analysis is impossible to anyone who
has not to a degree found his own essential divinity.
Believing in his own essential divinity, something
opens up in his nature. He finds himself on a
line of investigation and research. He has made
a beginning for his future happiness. He uses
ordinary reason, of course; but he has some-
thing more. He must go beyond the limitations
of the external man and visualize for himself
a picture of the possibilities of the human soul.
Then he reaches a point where real self-analysis
is possible. .
Of course I am speaking from the stand-
paint of a Theosophist, who accepts the idea of
many lives in repeated incarnations on earth,
who accepts the idea that man is divine in his
potential qualities. Thus Theosophy gives us a
62
IN FINDING THEOSOPHY, MAN FINDS HIMSELF
really great man- quite a dignified contrast to
the teaching we received in our childhood, that
we were all born miserable sinners!
The man who accepts the idea that he is
essentially divine, must also accept the idea of
spiritual growth, evolution. Evolution is often
taught in a ridiculous manner; but evolution
based on the essential divinity of man, on the
eternal progress of the soul through the experi-
ences of many earth-lives, ever approaching the
great goal of perfection, is an inspiring and
sublime doctrine, and it can never conflict with
any proved scientific fact.
Our Theosophical teachings are based on
eternal Truth. In fact, if one will take the trouble
to study them, he will find that once in a while
the Theosophist does have a sensible idea!
The most beautiful secret of the Theoso-
phical teaching is that, no matter what know-
ledge man may acquire necessary to balance and
adjust his own life and bring it into harmony
with his aspirations, he must impart to others
the peace and happiness which this knowledge
gives him. There must be something more than
.t
63
Tlw.oloplty
Li/U 1M
Veil
THE TllAVAlL OF THE SOUL
merely gaining knowledge for himself, atta1n1ng
wealth, winning a position, writing learned books,
and being considered important or 'advanced.'
There must be burning in his heart that spirit of
mercy and compassion, which will lessen man's
inhumanity to man.
That is the true love of the Divine. The
Divine Love is all-powerful and all-merciful.
There is mercy in the laws that govern our being,
mercy in Nature, mercy in divinity.
Potential divine qualities are sleeping with-
in every man. They are still sleeping, because
we turn away from them. Though the sun is
shining, if we tum away from it and go into
the shadows, we lose its warmth.
Theosophy lifts the veil. It opens the door.
It silences argument with its facts. It is not a
new set of teachings at all. It is as old as the
ages and was taught thousands of years before
Jesus Christ. It is the parent-religion, because
it holds within itself the elements of all that is
best in every religion.
The knowledge of external nature taught in
our schools is necessary for our education; but
64
THEOSOPHY LIFTS THE VEIL
it is not enough. There must be knowledge of
the inner laws of being, familiarity with oneself,
with one's weaknesses and one's strength.
Theosophy brings man close to his own es-
sentially divine nature. It gives him a right
royal courage, even in the face of death, which
Theosophy teaches means rebirth and spiritual
progress for the soul.
No real self-analysis is possible to the man
satisfied in acquiring merely intellectual know-
ledge. With all his worldly attainments, the one
thing that man most hungers for is knowledge of
himself- the power to analyse and understand
his own life. This is essential for his soul's ad-
vancement.
When man finds this knowledge, then he can
declare that' the Divine is love, and that human
life is essentially beautiful. Life is beautiful as
far as we make it so. Every man makes or mars
his own life, according to his own inner know-
ledge and the choice that he daily makes of the
path he will walk.
Everyone fails in his duty, if he does not
realize that we all owe a great duty to our fellow-
65
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
men - even to the most unfortunate and de-
graded. We might have been in the same position
ourselves, if we had had the same surroundings
as they.
We must acquire a new idea of compassiQn,
a new sense of justice. Then our consciences
will grow; and as we climb the hills of progress
and reach the heights and learn of the glory of
life, of the glory of the Divine, and the love and
mercy in the human heart, then we shall, in the
spiritual sense, embrace the whole of humanity.
For brotherhood is a fact in nature. We are all
united by the same natural laws and must follow
the same divine guidance.
Lay up your treasures in heaven by rounding
out your life on earth, freshening and beautifying
it. Let each one fulfil his smallest duty to the full-
est, and live hopefully and trustingly, uplifting
the world by the purity of his individual life.
The world needs a change. We need the
sweetness and nobility which every living man
and woman has potentially within himself or
herself. This is the way to bring humanity
up to a higher state of morality and dignity.
66
THE SOUL'S POWERS UNLIMITED
The weakness of our present civilization is
in man himself. The reason for it is that he The Sour&
allows the lower nature in him to rule instead of Power&
the higher, divine self, which is immortal. The Unlimited
lower nature is the undeveloped side of him,
which can be transmuted and brought up to a
quality that leads ultimately to happiness and
perfection.
My heart is warm for humanity, burning
with the hope that all may find at least some
part of what I have learned of the meaning of
life through my knowledge of Theosophy.
If you could move out of the glamor of the
world, out of the psychology of the age, away
from the insanity of its unrest, you would find a
new kingdom within yourselves. Each one of
us has the key to the situation, which appeals to
all that is noblest and best in our hearts.
There is no limitation to the power of the
spiritual soul of man. All that is needed is for the
brain-mind, which belongs only to the mortal and
dies when the body dies, to become conscious that
there is this divine power of the higher soul.
It rnay seem to us to be sleeping, but it is within
67
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
the very nature of man. Reason has its place
of course; but if we appeal only to our reason,
only to the outward man, or to the world's con-
ventional thought, if we come under the psy-
chological influence of the unrest of the age, we
receive very heavy doses of despair. We manifest
it in different ways. Suicide is an extreme instance.
But there are a great many very splendid
people, who have within them royal qualities of
superb character; yet they do not know it.
And that is why they struggle so; that is why
life is such a terrible riddle for them.
If a man does not know his own essential
divinity, he has not the key to the situation;
he cannot know his own inner God nor begin even
to think towards Universal Deity intelligently.
He does not know himself; he is the greatest of
all mysteries; for the last thing in the world he
would ever do, would be to come to himself for
knowledge. He refuses to challenge his heart,
his soul, his principles, and his conscience. No!
He will go anywhere and everywhere but to the
right place, and still despair!
So the supreme courage of the soul that I
68
THE SOUL's POWERS UNLIMITED
have often spoken ·of can be manifest only in
one who knows himself, at least to a degree.
One who has such knowledge is as sure of it as
he is that the sun shines; he is as sure of it as
he is of the pure love for his mother; he is so sure
of it that it is teeming through his whole nature;
it revivifies him, puts new blood in his veins,
gives him a new conscience, so to speak, and a
stedfast courage.
Any man can make the effort to reach that
knowledge. It requires no great strain, no re-
markable process of the mind or anything of
that sort. It is just a calm, quiet confidence in
oneself, that one can reach the goal. Then
comes the real joy of living.
We must admit that we do not meet so
many people in the world who carry in their
lives or in their faces, or in anything they do or
say, much that bespeaks the joy of living. But
that is what we should all find; because Nature
is singing a beautiful song to our souls and our
hearts all the time. There is something in the
splendor of Nature that appeals to us.
The more we know of our divine selves,
69
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
and the larger consciousness we have of the great-
ness of life, the better we comprehend that it
would be impossible in the divine scheme for
man to be born on earth and fulfil his complete
destiny in just one lifetime. It is impossible
because the program is such a great one - it
reaches out to eternity.
What could be grander and more beautiful
than to reach a point of certainty? Everything
in life would change. I a.m not an extremist;
I follow middle lines; but I am firmly con-
vinced that if we take care of our divine natures
in the sense that we should, and if we utilize
for all our lives this knowledge of right living,
we would have the secret of longevity; and really
and truly, the old would commence to grow young.

AN'S principal stumbling-block is ignorance.
No matter how much scholarship he may Reincarna-
have, or how much ability or even genius, lion anti
he is still spiritually ignorant until he knows some- Soul-
thing about Reincarnation; for this doctrine opens Knowledge
up a pathway that leads to the heights. It carries
one out beyond all dreaming- not to conditions
that are far-fetched or fantastic, but along middle
lines. It keeps him true.to all that is noblest and
best in life. It gives him a deeper knowledge of
his own soul; and it touches life with the rosy
color of the beauty and joy of living.
Reincarnation is a subject that brings home
to one so much that is consoling and uplift-
ing. It carries man away from the limited
idea of one earth-life of one hundred or a hun-
dred and twenty years at most. It takes him
out into the great thought-world of eternity-
into a new field where his heart has gone many
times in his ideals and his aspirations.
73
The Reli-
gioru Ten·
dmcy in
All Men
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
Teach a man that he is a soul; that in his
make-up the eternal, everlasting growth of his
life is of a spiritual quality; that he has more
than one life to live on this earth, before he can
know himself or understand the meaning of exist-
ence, or fulfil the dreams of his youth and his
highest aspirations.
Could there be a grander message to prO-
claim to all humanity than this great doctrine
of 'another chance' - the ancient doctrine of
Reincarnation?
All men have the religious tendency in them;
and according to all real philosophy and reli-
gion, the great plan of life is to bring man to
the recognition of the inner qualities of his own
spiritual nature. I do not mean the potential
qualities of the physical man, but of the spiritual
man- the real thinker, the man who loves, who
is ever striving to progress, to go ahead of himself
in a sense, to make today better than yesterday,
and tomorrow brighter than today.
It does not take twenty years to reach some
understanding of oneself. One can find the key
to the situation only within. Man holds within
74
THE STUDY OF REINCARNATION
himself the secret of his uplift or of his downfall.
He is his ~wn savior, his own enlightener, and his The Study
own God, so to speak,- or, he is his own de- of Rein-
strayer. He has before him a field of immense carnation
possibilities even in one lifetime.
One may be despairing, he may have made
no end of mistakes that nobody knows anything
about but himself. But the divine laws apply
to all; it is for us to embrace them. We must
know them; we must find them, and apply them
to our lives. We must live the true and un-
selfish life.
By the living of the forceful and enlightened
life, how soon the greatest mistakes of our na-
tion and our children would disappear! A great
sweeping force would meet us and stir the people
with new joy and new hope!
If the idea once touches your hearts, you will
not be able to move away from it. It will help
you to eliminate all the difficulties and doubts
that you have to fight in your own natures,
which now are mysteries to you.
Reincarnation was taught in past ages, and
it was taught in the western world until about
75
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
the sixth century of our era. But as man-made
dogmas pushed their way into the thought-life
of the time, slowly and surely it was thrust aside
in an age of spiritual darkness. But it has never
died out. It still has its place in many oriental
countries; and Europe and America in conse-
quence have less real spiritual life than they.
I recommend those who are interested in
the subject to study H. P. Blavatsky's books
or any of the publications of our Society. Then
they will be safe. This warning is necessary,
lest they be misled by the publications of pseudo-
theosophists, for which indeed we cannot be
responsible.
I say this advisedly and with much thought,
because there have been sO-Called theosophical
societies with their 'coming Christs' and all this
foolish nonsense, and much that we cannot in-
dorse- indeed, much that we repudiate. We
do not dabble in the fantastic teachings which
some who call themselves theosophists do. Con-
sequently we are obliged to state that Theosophy
is truly presented only through . the original
Theosophical Society, which we represent.
76
THE STUDY OF llEINCAilNATION
Another of the great stumbling-blocks in the
minds of men is their conception of death. Out Tile Be~~ulg
of a hundred people who discuss the subject o/ DeatA
with me, perhaps only ten or fifteen have the
slightest idea of Reincarnation, although the doc-
trine is spreading rapidly all over the world. It
is quite remarkable how this ancient teaching is
being revived, and as the minds of men become
more worthy of it, its spiritual value for them
will increase.
According to Theosophy, death is only re-
birth. That which dies is only your old coat of
flesh, which is physical and mortal, and it cannot
live in the spiritual world. But that which we
love, that which we believe in, that which did
the real thinking- quite apart from the mere
brain-mind- that which did the loving and the
growing and the serving, is the immortal soul
of man.
Death viewed in this light is beautiful. I
•
often wonder if the dear people who feel that
they are going soon, know the joy that awaits
them. I wonder if they dream that the divine
laws hold us in their keeping, when we are free
77
The Deity
anJ .SJf-
KnowleJge
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
from this mortal body, this house of flesh. Of
course the brain-mind, and mere brain-mind
thinking, die with the body. It is only the grow-
ing, aspiring, serving, climbing, and conquering
spiritual soul that is immortal and reaches the
point where the truth is known in fullness.
I am so full of confidence in these divine laws
and of the surety that death is beautiful, that it
makes life bearable; it makes us forgive our
enemies; it makes us feel ourselves in a new
world of thought; and it is the states of mind
that we live in that make our characters.
We should not weep for our darling loved
ones who have passed on. There is a clear ex-
planation for their condition.
We do believe that Love is eternal, and
therefore it is immortal. If the Divine is Love,
this should free us entirely from the fear that
besets those brought up under the old idea that
we wer~ born in sin, and that God is a punish-
ing and revengeful being.
Divinity is Love, eternal in power, and to us
incomprehensible. The only way by which we
can know anything about Deity is to feel its
78
THE DEITY AND SELF-KNOWLEDGE
power in our hearts, in our dearest moments of
silent aspiration, when we are seeking the Truth
and seeking the Light in our own quiet way.
That is when it comes. The revelation is within.
Hence that old teaching, "Man, know thyself,"
has a deep meaning for the Theosophist.
Someone may ask: "What are you going
to do about all the difficulties and sins and wrongs
everywhere in the world?"
Well, we cannot help conditions by standing
still. The only way to help is to go ahead and
b~come light-bringers and ex;amples of nobler
things for others. We may then find something
within our own hearts, in our souls, in our minds,
which we can express in our actions and our
words or in some other way- something to lift
the burdens of those who suffer. We can become
rich and full with the divine touch of the know-
ledge that man lives again and again, that his
spiritual soul is eternal, that death is beautiful,
that, indeed, death is life- rebirth.
It is better to swing into the atmosphere of
thought that I have made for you here today,
than to go anywhere where you are reminded
79
TM. Glory
and Jog of
Li-oita~
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
of your sins and your mistakes, where you are
threatened with the punishment of a revengeful
God or anything of that sort. If 'God' is Love,
there is no vindictive punishment.
An abundance of rich spiritual blessings is
in store for us at all times; but we cannot re-
ceive them until we reach up for them.
Truth is very simple; it is very beautiful;
it is very accessible; it is always the same; but
in seeking it, we often go the wrong way to
find it.
Life itself is true and beautiful. The Truth
is for all; and all we have to do is to fashion our
hearts towards new aspirations, drive away our
preconceived notions, our prejudices, our dislikes,
and our limitations; and, above all things, kill
out egoism. Throw overboard the idea that you
know it all; for in truth and in fact, we are
all little children before the Higher Law.
But we are all a part of"God's great family,"
and the grand and glorious possibilities of man,
as proclaimed in the teachings of Theosophy,
are waiting for us all.
If you consider only the subjects of Death
80
THE GLORY AND JOY OF LIVING
and Reincarnation, you will enter into a greater
world of thought than ever before. Study TheO-
sophy further and you will find new blood in
.
your vetns, new powers to overcome your own
we~knesses, a broad and trusting confidence in
the future. You will be ready to die tomorrow;
in fact you will be almost too eager for the change.
So go into the glory and the joy of living and
loving and serving and becoming, and thus fulfil
the destiny of your soul.

M
y subject is: "The Splendor of the Inner
Life of Man." What Theo--
For one to have an adequate concep- sopltg is
tion of what I am attempting to say, one must at anJ is nol
least know that the members of the Universal
Brotherhood and Theosophical Society compose
and are upholding the original Theosophical So-
ciety; that we are unsectarian and non-political
in our efforts; that we are not seeking nor teaching
phenomena, nor unbelievable and uncanny things,
nor superstitions, nor sa-called astrology, nor
palmistry, nor any of those idiosyncrasies which
some who call themselves theosophists, believe
in and teach.
What we are aiming to do is to explain to our
listeners that there is a superb and eternal teaching
-the TRUTH; that Theosophy is as old as the
ages; that it was lived and supported and believed
in thousands of ages before Jesus Christ's time.
85
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
It should be remembered that H. P. Bla-
vatsky, the foundress of the Theosophical Society,
never attempted to teach her pupils or the public
that she invented the philosophy. Her object
was to tell the world of the great truths of Theo-
sophy, and how ancient they were, and whence
they came.
She declared that Theosophy could an-
swer all the questions that puzzle humanity,
especially all thinking men and women; because
Theosophy, in the truest sense, without any
imagination, is absolutely based on facts, and
is the panacea for our ills and our mistakes.
It has the power to reveal man to himself; to
give him to understand that he is something
more than a creature born for one lifetime only,
and that he has within himself the eternal verities
of life, if he only knew it.
The object of real Theosophy is to enlighten
the people, that they may know that there is
something holy and uplifting in the world that
can be held to, and believed in, and taught, and
Jived; and in it one will find progress, advance-
ment, enlargement of vision, and explanation of
86
WHAT THEOSOPHY IS AND IS NOT
the meaning of life, and why we are here, and
so forth. All these things are brought out in the
teachings of Theosophy. And they come to you
and to all, without money and without price.
· All our workers here are unsalaried; not one,
from the least to the most important or the most
useful, receives any monetary remuneration for
his Theosophical services.
So, with this introduction, you may under-
stand that there must be a very deep interest on
the part of the members of the Universal Brother-
hood and Theosophical Society who have identi-
fied themselves with the Organization's activities
at Point Lorna; and that they are convinced
of the truth and the grandeur of Theosophy;
and they desire not only to live it, but to make
it known.
The aggregation of thought, and feeling, and
interest, and unselfish work of all those partici-
pating in the Theosophical life here creates a
distinctive atmosphere. The artists will tell you
about the atmosphere of their paintings, the mu-
sicians of their work; and so it is with the Theo-
sophists. They find a great deal in the atmosphere
87
Tire Splen-
dor of tM
Inner Life
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
of life- that is, in trying to bring out in their
daily lives the nobler and better part of their
natures, so that the world may be benefited.
My subject is not far-fetched at all. The
grandeur and the splendor of the inner life of
man should apply to everyone and should interest
all; because the teachings of Theosophy are
based on fact; and it is facts that we want nowa-
days. We do not need any more superstition,
nor any more weird, uncanny teachings. We
desire the truth about why we are here, what we
are here for, and the meaning of life. When
we find these truths in our Theosophical studies,
and apply them to our daily activities, we also
find the beauty of life, and some wonderful ex-
planations of the apparent injustices of the world.
Theosophy teaches that man is his own
greatest enemy and his own best friend. He has
the power of destroying himself or advancing
himself. He can bless or curse his own life.
I am not ready to judge a man until I find
out whether he has tried Theosophy. If he does
try it and does not find anything in it, then I
will decide that the karmic law will compel him
88
THE SPLENDOR OF THE INNER LIFE
to go through his hells, and his hells, and his
sufferings, and his disappointments, and his dis-
couragements, in order to awaken him. I feel
that something must have hit such a man so
severely, that he is lacking in that quality of
resolution needed for all serious truth-seekers
when he arrives at the point of reading and
knowing about Theosophy, and yet cannot find
in it that which I speak of.
So if we are looking for the splendor of the
inner life of man, we are not going to speak of the
exterior life; we are not going to speak of man's
successes, or his mistakes, or his attainments, or
his honors, or his wealth or his possessions; but
we are going to speak only of the inner life of man.
And Theosophy teaches, and I believe it
with my whole soul, that man cannot live rightly
without the splendor of his inner life; though
of course there are different degrees of it, different
expressions of it, and different stages of its growth.
One might go into the prisons and find there
a most degraded type of humanity; but Theo-
sophy would say, there is yet a hidden ray of
the inner life left in him, because he was born
89
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
a man, and as such he had the rarest opportunity
..Man of all living creatures to realize that he is a soul.
Know The body dies; but the higher soul lives on;
Thy$Jf!" for it is a part of eternity. There is majesty in
the thought: it is something to lead us away
from our trials and difficulties, out into a realm
of thought where man can think, and live, and
know, and grow, and love, and serve. And the
poorest man can do this; the most uneducated
or the educated.
Each one has his opportunity of finding the
key that will unlock the riddle of his own nature.
"Man, know thyself!" We do not presume to
say that anyone could know all there is about
man or his possihilities in one short lifetime;
for we are yet like little children out in the woods,
trying to find our way.
No one of you can tell me half of the wonder-
ful processes of Nature that made you a human
being out of an Atom. The mother should know
the most, and she cannot do it. So life at the
present time is a mystery, because man does
not know himself.
But from this point of view, one can see with
90
"MAN, KNOW THYSELF!"
what joy and delight I dare to think into the
life of man, and to think into the possibi]lities of
his inner life; because that is the spiritual man,
the living soul, not the part that dies when the
body dies.
The world may not know anything about
the inner life of man; many may not be1lieve in
the possibilities of the inner life. But th:at does
not make any difference. A fact is a fac:t; and
Nature is a fact, and the universal infinite laws
of life are facts; and we must meet them, vvhether
we will or not.
According to Theosophy, the grea.t pur-
pose of man being on this earth-plane, living
this life and other lives, is that the soul may
have the privilege of growing; and advancing,
and learning through experience. Verily, this
teaching opens a new vista of inspiring hope
for the human race. It lifts the veil, so to speak,
on the inner life of every human ~eing:. But
one cannot understand this at all, or have any
interest in the subject, if his mind is so limited
and he is so prejudiced against the teachings
of Theosophy, that he turns away from them.
91
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
"Man, know thyself!" That is the real study
of Theosophy! What are we here for? What
are we searching for? What are we trying to
reach? Why are we living in this world of effort?
Are we not trying to show that man is a spiritual
being, and that as such he is born for all eternity?
We are obliged to accept the teaching that
there is a great, magnificent, sacred, and uni-
versal plan in life. But those who live entirely
in the outer world, following solely worldly pur-
suits from day to day, if they do not believe
in the inner life of man, and live in accordance
with it, must still remain ignorant.
You know that in the Bible, Jesus taught
us that the kingdom of heaven is within. He
did not say we would find it in a boat out on the
great sea of life without a rudder, or on some
other planet, or anywhere else but within our-
selves!
Now, according to the Theosophical teach-
ings, we believe that man evolves from one
life to another; and in proportion to the know-
ledge he seeks, or the knowledge he gains, he
goes ahead. To advance along the path of
92
SELF-DIRECTED EVOLUTION
self-directed evolution implies self-study, self-
growth, self-controL Self·
No man can dabble merely with the teachings DirecleJ
of Theosophy and then proclaim to the world Eoolution
that he has found the panacea for life's ills!
Unless he has taken from his Theosophical studies
something he is applying to his life, in order to
make it better, to make his tomorrow brighter
than yesterday, to give him new life, new blood
in his veins, new thoughts in his brain, new
vibrations and pulsations in his heart, he has
not found the panacea. But when he gets it,
he never lets it go; because he has discovered
that there is something more than the outer life
for him; he knows that there are more stars in
the heavens than he had dreamed of; that the
universe is full of wonders that as yet we know
nothing about; because we are still children in
the school of human efforts.
We must be like the musician, who starts in
childhood with his five-finger exercises, and counts
aloud -1, 2, 3, 4. As he continues applying
himself, after a while something new and promis-
ing is aroused in him. His ability increases
93
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
day by day; and after some years, he finds him-
self acknowledged a master-musician!
So it is with the great artists, the great
writers, the great inventors, the great thinkers.
They have found within themselves the splendor
of the inner life, which is the key to their success!
And while they may never have heard of the name
of Theosophy, their souls are touched by their
aspirations. They have made up their minds
that tomorrow they will do more than they did
today. Nothing can discourage them. And that
is what I · mean by the splendor of the inner
life of man.
Evolution shows us that there are different
degrees of progress, and various stages and con-
ditions in life. It is obvious that one man rnay
know more than another, that one man may
serve more than another. So in the process of
evolution we have all varieties of human condi-
tions to deal with.
But the essential teaching of Theosophy is
that man shall know himself. Do not bother
about your neighbors, until you have found out
that secret in your own nature: "Man, know
94
THE INSANITY OF SELFISHNESS
thyself!" And when you find it, you will aim to
impart it to the whole world. And it is inspiring Tire In-
for us to rejoice even in our trials! Theosophy sanity of
is so gloriously beautiful! I can see it day by day, Selfislrnus
and month by month, and year by year, touching
the hearts of the people!
In the study of Theosophy and its applica-
tion to daily life, man will find his inner life.
But no man can find its splendor if he is looking
for the outer expression of it. He must look for
something that his heart yearns for. There is
not a man living, provided he knows how to
think and his brain is properly balanced, who
does not yearn for something better, who does
not aim for something higher and more true,
and who does not aspire to become a nobler man.
But how much encouragement does he have in
the world? Not very much, you will agree.
Selfishness governs the world, and I say that
selfishness is the insanity of the age. In the dif-
ferent countries of Europe which I have visited,
one can see the misery and the agony, and the
torture, and the suffering, and the injustices that
have been inflicted upon the people as the result
95
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
of this insanity expressing itself in the great war.
That war created a hell that we shall not move
away from for many years. And we in America
also took part in it, and we have yet to suffer
for it too.
Let us realize that every century has its own
time and way of doing things. And right now,
this very hour, when I am talking to you, will
never come again. You will never have this
chance again, nor shall I. So we can see how
precious the moments are, how precious time is,
how gloriously sacred and beautiful life is!
When we are in search of the truth and are
on the right path, when we believe in self-directed
evolution and in our own essential divinity, we
are marching forward in confidence. We may
make our mistakes; we may falter and find our-
selves in the shadows; but believe me, the spirit
of the eternal Truth is then working through our
lives, no matter how little it may be seen by others.
The splendor of the inner life of man is
manifested by the truly great thinker. I hold
that no man can think in the truest sense, and
find himself, even in small degree, without draw-
96
THE TRULY GREAT THINKER
ing upon the spiritual strength of his nature.
He finds the truly creative powers of his mind, if The Truly
he is not wedded to mere intellectualism. He Great
will not try to refashion himself or the world and Thinker
create his god on the basis of what he already
knows. The moment you find a man who thinks
he knows much, run away from him. He is dan-
gerous. His egoism is so great that he is really
a colossal failure.
The real thinker is not to be judged by
his wealth, nor his fame, nor his position. He
may or may not partake of these things. But
the real thinker is so involved with, and so much
a part of, the new life and the new knowledge
that come to him from the inner man, that he
has twice the strength to do his daily duties:
he meets the battles of life with twice the courage
he had before.
You will find more love in a man like that
in one moment than you will find in another
in ten years. Why? Because his mind is open
to the light of the eternal man and of the soul
living its different incarnations. Each time he
comes back to earth, he is in a new school of
97
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
experiences, new processes of growth - he is
Magnifiunl ever advancing.
Motherlaootl Consider the growth of a child from a single
cell! Ah! That is a magnificent, wonderful, and
glorious process! And we human beings, with
our little minds, have nothing to do with it at all.
The mother is the nurse. She has a holy treasure
to take care of. But suppose she does not be-
lieve in the spiritual nature of man; suppose she
has no vista of life's grand possibilities; suppose
she has neglected, or forgotten, or overlooked them;
or suppose she has been too weak to make an
effort to become; what kind of a mother can
she be to the little innocent soul entrusted to
her care? What can she teach her child, or her
husband, or her community, of the real life?
How little she does! - because the basis of life
is in the spiritual nature; that is the part that
knows, that progresses, and that aspires.
There are many very splendid characters in
the world today. I have known some educated
splendid thinkers and great workers, who have
nevertheless been burdened with many setbacks.
But if they knew even the little that I know-
98
MAGNIFICENT MOTHERHOOD
because Theosophy cannot be fully understood
in one lifetime,- they would realize that every
man holds within himself the key of his salva-
tion, of his redemption, and of his ultimate
conquest.
Now, there is nothing pessimistic about these
teachings, nothing to make one feel sad. There
is a great deal for one to think about in them.
With humanity in the condition it is in today,
one may think it is rather far-fetched for me to
speak of these subjects. But this is just the time
to talk of them, to attract people to the im-
portance of studying the whole nature of man,
of trying to understand the sacred meaning and
purpose of life.
I cannot conceive that any mother and
father are fitted to be parents, until they have
learned something of the universal laws of cause
and effect. They must know something of their
own inner natures. They cannot live entirely
in the brain-mind, the mere intellect, and mere
scholastic education. They must have spiritual
enlightenment.
So where you find great thinkers, who have
99
Dijferenl
Desreu of
Thin~ins
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
reached the heights, you will probably find also,
if you study their mothers and fathers, something
very unusual. Something had happened in their
lives; there was a divine trust, an inner trust.
It may be that nobody knew anything about it,
because they had made no effort to speak of it
to the world. But it marked the child for better
things.
Now, in becoming a real thinker,- accord-
ing to Theosophy and according to my idea,-
the first thoughts that one has are a little danger-
ous; and one should go very slowly in following
those thoughts in the conduct of the practical
affairs of life. The wise man always 'goes slow.'
But when he reaches the position where he can
recognise that there is this inner something in
himself which aims to express itself, he will meet
it half-way.
Of course, even when the sun is shining, if
one turns away from it and goes into the dark-
ness, he will not get the benefit of the sun's light
and warmth. So it is with Theosophy. We
must meet it half-way. We must find out what
it is, and receive its spiritual benefits. One must
100
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THINKING
realize the optimism of its teachings. It will
give new life to the most discouraged.
We say to those who err or to the prisoners:
"Remember that for every moment you breathe,
you have another chance. Realize further, that
when you are tired and your eyes close, and you
throw off the body, instead of going to death you
go to life. It is nothing but throwing off the
worn-aut overcoat of flesh. Then the soul rises
in the splendor of its life, just as far as it has
lived; for there is that inner life; there is that
spiritual manhood."
That to me is a message for every man -
indeed for every boy and girl and every woman; .
but particular!y for every man; because I think
the men have a hard time. They do not find
very much in the world of business that attracts
them to spiritual thoughts. A great many of
the books one reads are disappointments; many
of the preachers one listens to do not come up
to the mark..
So again, I say, strive to find out what is the
meaning of life, what is Theosophy, what is its
application, what does it accomplish, whence
101
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
come its truths, and how do we get them. Probe
down into these questions and see what Theo-
sophy means.
As nothing is asked of you except to listen
to these ancient teachings, you must see that
we have no object in the world but to benefit you.
Considering again the different degrees of
thinIcing: As I say, when man first begins to
think, using only his brain-mind, he is confused.
The next time, he thinks he knows a little more
and is a little more confused. The third time he
commences to think, he is just coming to the
depths of more serious thoughts, and that is the
time when a man becomes discouraged and gives
up. He does not know that the higher laws are
right in his inner nature; and pc:rhaps the very
question he is confused about can be answered
by himself, if he is patient.
But if he seeks again for knowledge at this
Fountain of Truth, this Center within himself,
in the confidence of his dignity and manhood,
then he finds something. There is where the
Great Thinkers live, who are the dominant powers
of the ages. And none but the generous and
102
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THINKING
unselfish can ever reach the real thinking quality.
Others are so absorbed in themselves and so
afraid of losing their identity, fearful lest they
become lost in the clouds, or something of that
sort, that they dare not challenge themselves to
find out who they are, whence they came, and
what they are here for.

SPIRITUAL AWAKENING
'J'O me the word 'awakening' has much value
1 in it. The whole of humanity needs a new
spiritual awakening.
Knowledge of the great, splendid, inspiring,
artd eternal life of the soul is not yet ours; for
if it were, we would meet life with a new cheer,
a new trust, a new hope, and a new love; we
would have the key to our problems; we would
be climbing the mountains; we would be living
in the eternal, and yet doing our full part here;
we would be loving as ·we have never loved he-
fore, understanding as we have never under-
stood before; we would be drawing all our thoughts
out of our inward, spiritual natures, out of our
aspirations; and if we were to do this, the glory
of the great universal law, or as the church-
people say, 'the glory of God,' would shine in
our hearts with every breath that we drew.
Then we should clearly understand that this
one lifetime ofseventy-seven or one hundred years
107
The NuJ
of All
Humanity
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
is but one school-time in o:ur many lives. We
must believe in ourselves more and try to break
away from the dismal picture that has been given
us all down the ages, of man's limitations, and the
limitation of God into a personal, revengeful God,
and that man was born in sin. Our souls forbid
our accepting this picture, for it is an insult to
our own spiritual dignity.
When will the time come, when men will
awaken? This is the question. Only a very few
here and there are boldly seeking the Light. Half
the dear good people.in the world meet the larger
truths that are coming to humanity, timidly.
Go out into the gardens of nature and talk
with the trees and the flowers, away from the
reach of men, and there find yourself, there talk
to your God; or, do it alone in the silence of
your own nature, sounding the depths of. your
own soul; and you can never tell how soon the
Light will come to you.
The awakening must come through suffering,
if people are not ready to reach out and receive
the Light spontaneously, trustingly, lovingly,
hopefully. You may read the best books and
108
THE NEED OF ALL HUMANITY
have the most learned teachers, but you never
can get the real secrets of life, that are at hand Science and
for each of you, until you have found them within Religion
yourselves. Then there will be a new spiritual Both Ma-
awakening in you, and you can answer humanity's leriali:eJ
cry for help. Through catching a glimpse of the
soul's possihilities, everything will change. A
wonderful soul-dignity will arise among men.
Let each man believe more in his own possi-
bilities, hugging closely all that is true and beauti-
ful and leaving behind him all his mistakes, setting
aside his prejudices and stretching his mind out
into the eternal things, realizing that this earth-
life is necessary in a sense, but only so far as he
concerns himself with his needs and not with
his wants. If we could give one-half as much
time to our spiritual selves as we do to some of
the non-essentials in our daily lives, we could
make the world over.
Ofcourse the real followers of H. P. Blavatsky
do not accept the propaganda for a supposed
'coming Christ,' which the newspapers have been
discussing recent1y, but repudiate this - a 'coming
Christ' heralded, it is said, by certain so-ealled
109
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
'Theosophists.' That is to us the most absurd
thing in the world; and if you want to find a
good collection of lunatics, we feel that you will
probably find them among pseudo-Theosophists,
who are talking such sensational nonsense. It
is shocking! Please remember that it has nothing
to do with the teachings of the Universal Brother-
hood and Theosophical Society, which is the ori-
ginal society founded by H. P. Blavatsky.
We have not to look to anything external
for the help that we hunger for; we are to find it
within ourselves, each one according to his own
evolution. Theosophy tells man that he himself
is his own redeemer - or his own blasphemer.
Science fails by be!ng too much materialized,
and religion, as it has been taught for so long,
fails for the same reason. It has made of the
Divine a revengeful, punishing God - personal
and finite. But the God of the Theosophists is
infinite, all-loving, the 'Great Enlightener'- not
a person at all, but an immense, eternal force
that always has been and always will be, just as
light always has been and always will be.
We are not placed on this earth to be parrots
110
DIVINE LOVE AND JUSTICE
or babies. We are here to redeem ourselves; to
take our opportunities for self-directed evolution. Dioine
There is nothing more terrible than to see so Looe and
many splendid people just drifting about, accept- justice
ing sa-and-so, simply because their grandfathers
did. And one of the most horrible nightmares in
human life is that old idea that we were born in
sin. Our own tenderness and gentleness and
ideality give us a grander view of life than that.
That is why I say that human life is a terrible
tragedy, for the reason that the Divine laws, or
the laws of nature, are not understood; life is not
made beautiful, the real depth and glory of every-
day life is not known, because more time is spent
in the material things than in the spiritual.
When we can fashion love and justice into
our lives, and build a great new hope through
the Theosophical teaching of Reincarnation, of
more and more experiences so that we may conti-
nue to grow, then comes real independence of soul,
then comes that wonderful spiritual awakening,
which is the keynote for the new year.
Although I have never read it in any book,
I believe that when our children are born, or, as
111
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
we would say, reincarnated, they are ready for
the awakening, for the revelation of revelations
in themselves; and they might teach the elders,
when they come; but they are not given half a
chance. Are they not tied down with customs
and habits and set plans and the old limited idea
of just one earth-Hfe?
What does the boy or girl have in the grow-
ing time to attach himself or herself to, that has
the basic spiritual life in it? And after a while
they move into the psychological nightmare of
half-dreaming and half-living, instead of fully
living.
When the material life is well understood
according to Theosophy, and lived truly with
an understanding of the spiritual life, you will
not have to spend your time studying from books
who and what you are: you will find inside your
own natures a wonderful poem of life, a won-
derful revelation. It may not come in a moment
or in a day. It is something indescribable. The
only way that I can get even an approximate
expression of it, is to compare it to a mother's
iove. No matter where we may be or what our
112
DIVINE LOVE AND JUSTICE
mistakes or our disappointments, we only have
to revive the memory of our mother's love, and
we are tender and gentle and loving and trusting.
Think of the spirit of Universal Brotherhood
ripening the heart of humanity! All the difficul-
ties that confront us would be surmounted.
Sickness, disease, sudden death, and all the un-
natural horrors of the world, were never intended
for us. They are the result of the misuse of know-
ledge or of the lack of knowledge.
But oh! the divine glory of having a know-
ledge of life that is all-loving and all-powerful,
in the belief that not one is lost, that self-directed
evolution is the plan that \Ve are a part of, each
one moving according to his evolution, and the
ultimate goal the ever-expanding perfectibility of
man. We will not presume to insult the divine
laws by expressing an opinion as to when that
will be. But it will come through the spiritual
awakening of your higher natures, which are in-
destructible and eternal.
A very few people can do tremendous things
when their minds are rightly attuned to the needs
of the hour. The divine laws of life are the
113
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
factors that we must appeal to: we have enough
The of the world's pressures, of vice, of sin, of crime,
Clrrilitntu- of disharmony.
Net~ Year At this Christmas-time and time of New-
Seaon Year's resolutions let us look forward with a new
hope. It certainly seems a most opportune time
for us to take in in thought the deeper meaning
of spiritual awakening.
The world is filled with a tremendous amount
of brain-power, great intellectual energy, and in
some directions superb efforts for the advance-
ment of the human race. But there is still some-
thing woefully lacking.
At this time with the glorious charms of
nature about us, especially here in this wonderful
state of California, should we not expect more
ofourselves, ofothers, and indeed ofall humanity?
While it is true that man is a thinker and
that some m.en do much thinking, still we do not
think deeply enough; and so we do not compre-
hend the strength, the beauty, the grandeur, and
the potency of man, once he has raised his con-
sciousness to a higher state. There is no limit
to the possibilities of man's growth. As yet we
114
THE AWAKENING OF THE SOUL
are all as little children on the by-paths of life,
often discouraged and then again renewing our Tlte
courage. We have much to lead us astray; but A1.0a~ening
the light shineth within. Every man has his oftAe Soul
own light, his own strength, his own ability and
his own opportunities, if he will but grasp them.
Instead of looking outwards or to others for
a knowledge of the Divine Wisdom which we call
Theosophy, look within; that is the place. Men
must be led kindly to this spiritual awakening.
They have their weaknesses and their strength;
but they can be led like children if they only
have the confidence to accept the teachings; and
they cannot have the confidence to accept the
teachings until they understand them; and if
they do not understand, who can condemn them?
I believe that the great inventions, discoveries,
and achievements of humanity are the result of
the aggregation of all the thought- and effort
put on the subject.
There is something tr~mendously fine in man
when considered as a whole. His possibilities for
future development are magnificent. But if one
has no faith in anything outside of his thinking
115
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
qualities, he can have no adequate idea of his own
strength of character or of the possibilities of his
life. He cannot get these until he has discovered
within himself those spiritual qualities which come
from his highest yearnings- the spiritual awaken-
ing. Sometimes it comes through sorrow and
misery; sometimes much thinking and much
questioning bring it; sometimes it overwhelms
him like a revelation and takes him out of the
common way of thinking into a new world of
creative ideas. He awakens and finds who he is
and why he is here. He commences to see that
there are wonderful divine forces playing through
human life all the time- visible and invisible.
Certainly whatever that source is that fashions
this wonderful scheme of the universe, what-
ever that center of light or energy is that de-
veloped and brought us where we are, it has
the power to explain the mystery of our lives,
to tell us who we are, why we are here, whence
we came, and that all knowledge is at our com-
mand if we seek it.
Theosophy teaches that man is essentially
divine in nature, and that the part of him which
116
THE AWAKENING OF THE SOUL
is not divine is what worries him, frets him,
keeps him discouraged and down in the shadows,
and creates all disharmony. That is not his
Higher Nature; .and he cannot live in his Higher
Nature if he does not make room for it, and make
for it the right atmosphere. We have scarcely
begun to think yet. We touch the fringe of great
truths; but it takes human hands and human
hearts to bring these truths closer .to our under-
standing.
If our journey through life can be so solidiy
true that every note in thought and act is pure and
every motive unselfish, then we shall be able to
hear some of the undertones and overtones of the
great harmonies of life: we shall have our spiritual
awakening. These things are possible.
Then there will come stealing into our na-
tures, into our hearts, our heads and our inten-
tions, a larger charity for those who err, a new
quality of tender compassion that will make us
forgive our enemies. We will close our eyes at
night knowing that something quite new and all
our own has been born of our thought and our
will-power- not from our criticism, our intellectu-
117
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
al harshness and severity, but from the softness,
the tenderness and the gentleness of our own
hearts.
Once man's consciousness of his own essen-
tial divinity is aroused, it is like a new circulation
of the blood; it makes new life; it gives new
vision; it creates new hope; it can and does re-
flect itself on to the physical body.
What man needs more than anything else
is balance. Unless man is a bump of walking
egoism that nobody could endure, he knows in
his striving and in his yearning that there is
something more waiting for him; that there is
something he should have had which he has
not had. ·
It takes so few to do grand and magnificent
things, when they are united. Many men do
well, but they do not do well enough. Many men
think, but they do not think deeply enough.
Men have not faith enough in themselves to
bring themselves to the paint of challenge and
self-analysis.
There is a peculiar timidity that is born in
our blood, passed down for generations. Think
118
THEOSOPHY THE PANACEA
of the fear that people carry through life- the
fear of death, of suffering, of poverty, etc. Fear TheMoplay
consumes a great deal of man's brain-oil and the Panacea
dissipates much of his energy and power.
With this awakening to new and better things
come revelations so sacred· that no words can
describe them. I am not telling fairy-stories.
I am talking of my own experiences and the ex-
periences of others whom I have been working
with for thirty years.
I know what I say when I declare that the
Theosophy which we teach is the panacea for all
the ills of the world. It cannot make you all
over. It cat:tnot rub out your mistakes in the
way that you might wish, but it gives you the
opportunity to move out from under the pressure
of the psychology of the age and the fear that has
brought you to a state of half-discouragement
or of half-conquest.
A man with full confidence and conscious-
ness of his own essential divinity, though he may
not have a shelter, he may not have a dollar or a
friend, yet has one of the treasures that every
man must possess before he c~n reach a point
119
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
of understanding and knowing his God or himself.
Death according to Theosophy is rebirth.
Understanding this we should not be ready to
hold our loved ones with us when they must go;
we should not hold them with regrets and tears
and seHish grief; we should put these aches and
pains aside and forget them, and thus help our
loved ones to their freedom and their release
from the body the soul has been struggling in.
When you can think of death in this way it is
a revelation. You can smile while the tears are
bursting through your heart.
Move away from the psychology ofjust brain-
mind thinking! You think you have educated
yourself, whereas it is the world that has edu-
cated you. You are an epitome of the world's
joys and its woes. Your brain-mind shuts out
the enlightenment that the soul would give you.
The soul is the companion, the warrior, the friend.
It travels the path for eternity, whereas the body
is just the physical overcoat that we wear for
this time while we are here on earth.
Move away from small, narrow, personal
things and go into a higher state of consciousness!
120
THEOSOPHY THE PANACEA
The feeling will be like that which comes to one
who has been living down in a valley without
seeing any sunshine for a long time, when sudden-
ly he finds himself at the top of the hill with the
most glorious vista of the world's beauty spread
before him. The whole make-up is changed. One
attains a quality of the mind that belongs to the
immortal man- intuition. Depending upon your
own intuition, the very trees and flowers will talk
to you. You will be so sure of yourself that you
cannot be interfered with, if you are on the right
path of self-directed evolution.
You mothers and fathers, what are you giv-
ing to your children that will stand by them when
you are gone, that will make their lives bearable,
that will enable them to understand the meaning
oflife and find its joy?
Keep thinking and thinking more deeply, and
before you know it you will find yourself caught up
from this web of controversy and questioning;
enlightenment will come; more smiles will be on
your face, more gladness in your eyes, more joy
for your children and also for your community
and therefore more peace for the world.

I
F people would put aside their limitations and
inquire, question, study, persevere, and work
sufficiently, we should certainly have a dif-
ferent humanity.
What troubles me most is that people can
be satisfied with the limited idea of one short
earth-life in which to attain perfection. True,
there have been good and splendid people in this
world brought up under this teaching, but they
would have been good and splendid anyway, no
matter what religion they were taught.
Not within the last hundred years at least,
it seems to me, was there such a time as now,
when humanity has so little in view, so little to
hope for or to fashion its plans to. For a true
Theosophist there can be no contentment except
in a life of eternal progress, royal service, great
victories, magnificent conquests over self, constant
spiritual advancement, and the ever-increasing
search for the inner spiritual knowledge.
125
The Search
/or Inner
Knowledge
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
There is learning enough in the world to
make us all saints; but singularly enough, we
do not become saints! Without the conviction
of the truth of Reincarnation, most people go
out of their bodies no more satisfied with life
than they were when they first began to think.
When once we begin to know ourselves, to
find the golden thread of divinity within us, our
fears and lack of trust disappear; we feel so rich
and purposeful that we are anxious to share our
spiritual treasures with others. Then there is a
wonderful, royal, inner exchange, such as Christ
spoke of when he said, 'Love ye one another.'
The body is the vehicle through which the
soul - the real man - gains the schooling of ex-
perience in different lives. As I see it, in this way
only is self-directed evolution towards the goal
of perfection possible. Therefore man must live,
suffer, learn, know, and become, before he finishes
the course.
We can find the glory of the Divine in every-
thing true and beautiful. Man can live the pure,
strong, trusting life, if only he has faith in him-
self. The divinity within him must speak in
126
NO CREEDS NOR. DOGMAS IN THEOSOPHY
his every thought and act- this is inspiration.
To know oneself is to understand life. It No Creeds,
is the inner key that unlocks all life's mysteries.
And to know himself, man must trust himself,
he must do his own thinking and not let others
do it for him.
The dogma that we were born in sin certain-
ly suggests a very queer sort of plan which limited
human minds have made for the great, divine,
and universal Deity that we love, the universal
source and center of life and light!
Theosophy has no creeds and dogmas to offer.
Jesus the Christ had none and you know how well
he got along without them. There is nothing
fanatical about Theosophy. If any student of
Theosophy is fanatical, it is because the fanaticism
was so in his blood that he could not fully under-
stand Theosophy in one lifetime.
Nothing in the world will so stir your real
nobler nature and make you at least partly con-
scious of there being more in you than you had
thought, than to recall the tenderness of the
love of your mother. When we know ourselves,
we shall be so overwhelmed with the mightiness

of the spiritual life - the only reality within us -
Man's that we shall have no more questions; our trust
Essmtial in the Supreme will be as complete as that of the
DitJinity child who goes to its mother in all its sorrows
and disappointrnents.
As Theosophists we do not remind you that
you are terrible sinners. We make no attempt
to convert you nor to have you join our Society.
We are only anxious that you shall share with us
some of the knowledge which Theosophy has to
offer - knowledge of the Self. It gives us the
spirit of good-will, liberality, and tolerance. It
is full of promise. And in spite of the terrible
conditions we see everywhere around us, when
we understand human life, the progress of the
soul, when we believe in the etemity of human
evolution and the essential divinity of man, life
is really joy. We live then in a new world; we
can know the Divine and our own souls.
The knowledge of man's essential divinity
is the great element lacking in most of the reli-
gious teaching of the day. Man has the power
to redeem himself and to bless the world and to
make all days, days of gladness and joy. When
128
MAN'S ESSENTIAL DIVINITY
that is done, we shall have the true spirit of
brotherhood, which is a fact in nature, as it is
in our hearts.
Can you not conceive what a lift it would be
to the great human family if each and all, from
the lowest to the highest, could be absolutely
assured of the essential divinity of man? With
this key ~~ their heads and in their hearts, what
a great step forward humanity could take!
Again, if we could accentuate, for every hu-
man being on the face of the earth, the teaching
that man was not born in sin, this would be an-
other revelation to many. I hold that no man
can understand the true dignity of his own charac-
ter, so long as he accepts the old dogma that he
was born in sin.
How can we satisfy ourselves that the All-
Knowing, All-Loving, Eternal Deity guiding our
lives- God or the Divine Spirit- can be any-
thing but love? To say that the Divine is a punish-
ing, jealous, and revengeful God is blasphemous,
especially when we admit that humanity comes
on to the earth not at all from its own choice.
We must come to the point where we accept the
129
Anotlan
Clumce
/or All
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
infinite as infinite, and not as finite, personal,
jealous, or revengeful.
My experience for many years in New York
brought me into contact with the most unfortu-
nate and the most despairing and degraded-
and the most condemned. I found it impossible
to accept the idea that their sins were so great
that they should be punished any more in an
imaginary hell after death, than they were being
punished already by the mere fact of their miser-
able existence on this earth. Instead of this
heart-crushing doctrine, my Theosophical co-
workers and myself tell the unfortunate, with all
the intensity of our feelings and our convictions,
that they have another chance, just as all hu-
mans have, in another life on earth, in repeated
rebirths, until all the lessons of earth-life have
been learned.
I think it is wonderful that humanity does
even as well as it does, under the pressure of the
erroneous teachings that it has received for so
long, and its lack of knowledge as to the real
meanings of life.
I put myself in the position of the people
130
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR ALL
for whom I have worked- the most degraded
and the most depraved, one might say- and I
realize that, if I had had the same environment
that they had, and if I had not had the oppor-
tunities which have been mine, I might have been
just as they were. This thought breathes a won-
derful spirit of tolerance and patience and for-
giveness. And one cannot strike one true chord
in one's heart without setting into vibration an-
other and another and another ad infinitum.
A man may possess much knowledge; he
may have much faith in himself; he may to a
degree accept the divine laws; but if he is not
aware of his own spiritual will, its power and its
majesty, he finds himself out of place, awry.
We make no effort to convert you to Theo-
sophy. We leave you to go your own way, to
do your own thinking and acting. But you can-
not move very far away from Theosophy, once
you have accepted these few fundamental teach-
ings which I have hurriedly sketched. The royal
blessings of spiritual truths are yours; but it
is you who must find them for yourselves. And
there can be no dilly-dallying with the spiritual
131
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
life. We cannot play saint and angel on Sunday
Life is Jog and then waste our time during the week.
We must be absolutely true and faithful in
our acquisition of spiritual powers and have no
time to throw away on non-essentials. To know
the doctrine, we must live the life. And when we
live the spiritual life, then that horrible shadow
of death that has haunted so many of us from
childhood will have its revelation for us, its beauty
and its charm. Where can those who grieve for
their loved ones find that warm, rich, powerful,
inspiring force needed to sustain them except
in Theosophy?
Who is to blame for the failure of so many
of our children? Humanity is to blame. The
children have not been given the key to the
knowledge of their own lives. Most of them know
not one thing of their spiritual natures. And
what examples have they not had in this world of
ours from people who just manage to keep out-
side the jail - thousands and thousands of them!
Let us open up our minds to the fact that
life is joy; that is, the real spiritual life, and
that the disarrangements, the failures, the dis-
132
LIFE IS JOY
couragements, the heavy, tearing, heart-shadows
that we must face in life are our own to readjust.
We have an opportunity, even in the ordinary
lines of daily activity, to think a little more, to
let our souls break through into something better,
and to find ourselves out under the great blue
sky in our aspirations, in touch with nature's
wonderful lessons and its silent and marvelous
beauty.
If there is any power in the world that can
be legitimately used to prevent so many children
coming into the world under present conditions,
I pray that such power may be used; for there
is too much suffering, too much ignorance, too
much sickness, and there are too many deathly
horrible things facing us all the time to inflict
them on our little ones.
We must challenge ourselves, as we are chal-
lenged all the time by the Higher Law. We must
face ourselves in our weakness, in our timidity,
in our indifference, in our unbrotherliness, in our
cold-heartedness. If we could tear these things
out of our lives and be like little children at the
feet of the Master we would find something of
133
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
the real meaning of life. We mig:ht find some-
thing of the glory of living and share in the
wonderful revelation that comes from a know-
ledge of the Spiritual Self.
At best, of course, our knowledge is limited.
Seventy years is very little in the ages that we
shall see before we reach that state~ of perfection
where we 'shall go no more out.' This is our
heritage.
It is impossible for me to think of any other
way to adjust myself to humanity. I cannot
truly love my fellow-man unless I have this inner
heart-fire burning within me all the~ time~ that I
may do more and more, that I may become
sufficiently evolved to walk the pa1th with others
and to help them.
This is the charm of Theosophy. It warms
the whole nature. It satisfies the mind, the heart,
and the soul. It brings peace such as you have
never had in your lives before. It gives you a
new interpretation of the meaning of life.
A full life must be expressed spiritually as
well as materially. At the present: day the ma-
terial life is much looked after and of course in
134
LIFE IS JOY
many ways it has to be; but, on the other hand,
there are so many non-essentials in most lives to-
day. If we can throw these overboard and begin
anew to climb the mountains ofspiritual aspiration
and serve and aim to reach the top and there see
the great vision of universal life, then we shall
be glorified in our manhood and womanhood,
glorified i~ our love of the true and the beautiful.

LET THERE BE LIGHT!
ALMOST every hour I remind myself of the
deplorable conditions of humanity. Some Tlae Limi-
people are so occupied with their own selfish tatioru of
living that they give no thought to tomorrow and Falu
are satisfied with what they have. Others touch Teachings
the needs of humanity rather lightly and some-
what indifferently. Thousands and thousands do
not care at all. Still others are, in their own esti-
mation, absolutely hopeless. -For my ·own part,
though I am optimistic by nature, I do not think
a serious observer of the world's needs can be
over-happy.
There is much to think about. If we think
at all, we must easily see that the conditions we
deplore would be very different if each one of us
realized his own ability and possibilities, if we all
could have had such education as would have
enlightened us and freed us from the psychological
nightmare of false teachings.
According to my observation, humanity is
139
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
only half living. There are many isms, many
fads, many societies, and many teachings; but
there is one thing that none of these has answered:
What is the real meaning of life? The large ma-
jority are satisfied with the one earth-life, and
absolutely believe that ·it is all man needs and all
he will have. This to me is a lamentably limited
view. It is a travesty on truth, on religion, on
the Divine, and on man.
It is very clear to me that man must know
himself before he can adjust his life, before he
can adapt himself even to this one life. I repeat,
he must, at least to a degree, know himself. The
two Theosophical doctrines of the duality of hu-
man nature and of Reincarnation will clear the air
and put truth in places where there is ignorance,
and hope where there is despair. Ere long man
will begin to find himself; and he never can find
his own ability, his own possibilities, his own
potency, until he has this inner knowledge. And
it does not take a lifetime to acquire such know-
ledge.
All classes of thinking minds are calling:
'Let there be light!' This is an acknowledgment
140
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
that they have not found the light. There is
not knowledge enough nor enlightenment enough; Let there
and a little knowledge is very dangerous. But Be Light!
let a man be conscious of his soul-dignity and
power, and he will think himself away from his
narrow environment and warm his heart in the
thought of the royal possibilities of the human
race; for verily, they are royal; and when once
they are understood and brought out in daily
living, then life becomes joy.
Each one of us, with all our difficulties, our
trials and heartaches and disappointments, even
the injustices we suffer, can fashion ourselves to
such an ideal of living, that there can be no fear,
no timidity, no real restlessness, and no doubt.
The whole mass of humanity must be brought
to a point where they can conceive of a vision of
life so broad, so far-reaching, so forceful, that
they cannot move away from it. Then they will
awaken and really begin to live. Then shall we
be responding to the cry, 'Let there be light!'
For, according to·the teachings of Theosophy,
man himself holds the key of his divinity, of his
soul-life, of his progress, of his self-directed evolu-
141
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
tion, and of the superb possibilities ofstepping.out,
moving on, and climbing ever upwards into higher
realms of thought.
Let us use our minds as it was intended we
should use them: to look upon the grandeur of
human life, and the beauty of its duties and its
responsibilities, and then to find that love our
souls have longed for, within ourselves. When
we find this, then we shall realize that others
have the same; we shall realize our universal
kinship, and our separateness will cease.
Just as long as we live in the shadows ofdoubt
and fear, just as long as we cannot feel profoundly
the justice of human life, we are only half living.
What I am saying to you did not originate
with me; nor is it original with the Theosophical
Society nor with H. P. Blavatsky, its foundress;
but it is the teaching of the ancient Wisdom-
Religion, which has been ignored for ages; and
because it has been ignored, humanity has drifted
away from its moorings. And now, in its longings,
its yearnings, and its prayers, it cries, 'Let there
be light!'

enough to believe that there is real genuine good Worltfs
in Theosophy. Teaclrers
That goodness justifies itself; for those who
are real Theosophists, who live the life, and follow
its teachings, they are slowly but surely becoming
the teachers of the world. They ask no gifts, no
rewards; all they ask is that you should think
towards this great subject and see if you cannot
find within the teachings of Theosophy that won-
derful something that your hearts crave. I might
describe it to one in one way and to another in
another; but you know there is a longing, a
yearning, a restlessness in your natures; you know
you are not satisfied; you know that life is too
limited for you in its present aspect. To find the
magic talisman, take up the investigation or the
study of Theosophy.
There is no attempt made by members of
our Society to convert you or to have you join
our ranks or to declare yourselves Theosophists.
If you are a real Theosophist you will be de-

claring it all the time by your actions, and your
words will be unnecessary.
People are growing hardened to man's in-
humanity to man. They drink their coffee in
the morning and read the paper telling of one
poor fellow being hanged and another one about
to be hanged, and they are not stirred. The only
way for us to be stirred is to have something
hit us right in our own heart, in our own environ-
ment, perhaps right in our own home-life. Then
we begin to think.
We are baffled as to the cause of these con-
ditions. But when we think deeply we realize
that it is the lack of knowledge; it is ignorance;
it is the psychology of the age in teaching us
that we were born in sin; that we are unworthy,
and that we must keep working and working and
working in order to appease the 'wrath of God.'
But Theosophy teaches that man is essen-
tially divine in nature; that in this divine aspect
of his life he has many lives to live. If he has
made his mistakes yesterday, today he can cor~
rect them, and tomorrow he will go forward.
There is a future for him. There is clearly

It is my hope that you who listen to my

will challenge you, something that will bring you
to the point of realizing that there is yet some-
thing more for you to do in life. You must be
in a position where you have to say, cLet there

within yourselves, into Nature, and into your

Very few of you have had any realization of
your aspirations. Ifone can have right aspirations,
based upon knowledge of man's essential divinity
and of repeated lives for greater growth and larger
service, then he really begins to live, then the
light streams in upon him from the whole universe.
It is here all the time, waiting for you and for me;
but if we turn away, with our imagined superior
intellectual concepts, we do not see it. We must
reach out for it. It comes just as the sunshine
comes, or as the flowers in the springtime.
145
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
The glow and the grandeur of truth, as it is
T~p/ai· manifest in the teachings of Theosophy, give you
cal Gifts something that you cannot find anywhere else.
It will give you a wonderful power of endurance,
a rare quality of discrimination, a royal, divine
trust and a conception of life so grand, so superb,
so uplifting and inspiring that you will feel you
have embraced an entirely new world. You will
touch the fringe of truth, and when you get it
you will never let it go.
This new feeling in your heart, awakened
through your aspirations and your courage, will
enable you to reach the point of knowing that man
is immortal, the spiritual soul eternal and ever
•
progresstng.
This is not just belief, it is knowledge: there
is no language to describe how you get hold of it,
but it is a living fact in your life and you cannot
move away from it. You begin to live the real life,
the natural life; your body responds in better
health; your mind is filled with larger hopes,
greater vision, and the superior knowledge that
comes from a consciousness of your own essential
divinity. It will sweep you over all your diffi-
146
THEOSOPHICAL GIFrS
culties and carry you, as you work with the laws
that govern you, to that peace which passeth
all understanding. It is not a matter of words;
it is a matter of reality.
So I very strongly urge you and advise you,
if you wish to have explanation of your problems
in life, go slowly to work at studying Theosophy.
Take the right books, do not follow false teachers,
and see what will come into your life and into the
lives of those who depend on you. For the whole
world will change to you; your whole vista of
life will alter; that indescribable something that
you yearn for all the time but do not have will
be yours- and that is courage. It stays; it
defies time, men, tradition, everything! It stands
firmly on the rock of truth and it lives in the
truest sense enlightened- fully enlightened as
far as experience permits. Then is the meaning
of life and of love and of justice explained.
When this is done, then you have found your
own inner divinity, you have found the key that
will make your lives useful, beautiful, full of
that divine courage that every man should have.

THEOSOPHY, THE NATURAL RELIGION
OF MAN
I
T should be distinctly understood by all in-
terested in the teachings of genuine Theo- The Ancient
sophy, which is the Ancient Wisdom, that Wiuom
the members of the Universal Brotherhood and
Theosophical Society are not fanatics; neither
are they extremists; they are absolutely prac-
tical and believe that their duty is not to convert
the masses, but rather to give to those who are in-
terested information concerning the basic teachings
of Theosophy, which hold the key to man's
true evolution.
·With the pressure of all that is put upon the
bread-winners of the world in money-making,
politics, social duties, and all the distractions of
external life, they do not have time to realize
that man, in order to find his true position, to
find his strength, to find his human nobility, to
find his manhood, and to receive the knowledge
of the inner, higher, more sacred teachings, must
151
The Opt;..
mism of
Theolophg
THE TRAVAJL OF THE SOUL
believe that he is something more than an animal;
he is something more than a being that is created
for seventy-seven or one hundred years and then
is lost forever! Nay, nay! Verily, I say, the
Spiritual l\1an is eternal, as the Ancient Wis-
dom teaches.
Thinking in this way, one can very easily see
that Theosophy, which is Religion itself, is opti-
mistic, that it is full of promise- of promises
that can be fulfilled; that it looks upon life as
sacred, and not only as sacred, but as beautiful,
in spite of the shadows of sickness, disappoint-
ment, sorrow, and vice.
How easily we can see today that Nature
brings home to us, in its silence, the great eter-
nal verities!
We Theosophists accept our teachings as the
natural religion of mankind. It is the .religion
of the world. It is the religion that every man
must have before he can fashion his life up to
his ideals.
Let me ask you: Where do your ideals come
from? Where do your hopes come from? What
is this that steals into your nature sometimes
152
THE OPTIMISM OF THEOSOPHY
when the shadows are heavy and makes you feel
that possibly tomorrow they will all be lifted?
All such hope comes from the spiritual side
of man; not from the physical body, not from
the brain-mind, but from the higher, the inner,
the deeper part of man- the very thing that
Jesus Christ taught, the inner meaning of his
great message.
Theosophy, being the natural religion of man-
kind, brings to us a rare optimism. We are able
to meet the trials of life and its crises and dis,..
appointments much more cheerfully than those
who believe that they were born in sin, and that
they have only one short earth-life of a hun-
dred years at most.
We feel that it would be an offense to the
Divine Spirit to hold that Deity is omnipotent,
omnipresent, eternal love, and then to leave im-
printed on our minds and on our natures and
therefore on our future, the untrue ideas of ori-
ginal sin and of the one earth-life.
Our religion is so natural because it comes
from the inmost part of our own natures - the
Eternal Man. It comes to us as the sun comes
153
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
in the morning. It comes as the flowers come
&Ja EArl/a. in the springtime. It comes as love and friend-
Life a
Scllool of
Experience
ship come to you.
Man is dual in his nature: he is not just a
physical body as we see him. He goes through
this earth-life in a physical body just as he goes
to school. He goes to school in the winter, and
in the summer he takes a vacation. When he
goes to sleep at night the body is not dead. In
the truest sense, when the body is tired and
worn out and goes to its rest, the spiritual soul
does not die. It lives on. The spiritual soul is
that part of you which makes you love, makes
you trust, makes you hope, makes you dream
the great dreams of the world. And such dreams
are the proof of your spiritual nature.
So, according to the teachings of Theosophy
and according to my firm conviction, man has
more chances than one for the larger life on this
earth.
To many men, the charm and the benedic-
tion of Theosophy is that, no matter how many
mistakes one has made in the past, no matter
how blinded he may have been, no matter how
154
EACH EARTH-LIFE A SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE
selfish, no matter how he has turned away from
the nobility of his own spiritual nature and gone
astray, tomorrow is his if he finds the key to
the situation, which is the inner knowledge of
his own essential divinity.
As a race, I do not think we give much
thought to the subject of life and death. There
may be hundreds or even thousands of exceptions
to this, but not the millions yet, who attempt to
think about the meaning of life or death only
when death comes to their loved ones.
Then the questions arise and challenge man
to give an answer: Whence come we? Whither
do we go? What is the meaning of life? Is this
all that the great, eternal All-Father, so to speak,
intended for us: seventy-seven years on earth,
and a hard cold life at that, with the conscious-
ness of the weight of our mistakes, and the belief
of many in the damnation of man because of
these mistakes?
No wonder humanity is in turmoil! No won-
der we have wars! No wonder we have to defend
our country with guns and the sacrifice of human
souls! No wonder we have all these things, when
155
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
man has been taught so long of his supposed
innate depravity and of his original sin, and that
he must, if he is to know a,nything of the blessings
of life and of these spiritual things, depend upon
other forces than his own!
Theosophy teaches us that man is the Con-
queror. He can bless his life or he can blaspheme
it. He can, if he will, live close to Nature, close
to his own essential divinity. He can do his duty
cheerfully and bravely and cou.
rageously. He can
love nature and understand it. Thus he will find
the natural religion. Where does he find it? He
finds it in his own heart- in the inner chamber
of his soul.
With the knowledge of the splendor and
grandeur of the natural religion of Theosophy,
and of the vastness of human life and the eter-
nity of spiritual things, he will have the superb
inspiration of realizing that high thoughts bring
higher thoughts, that noble acts make nobler acts,
and that even small weak men make greater
men, when they find that within themselves lies
the secret of the spiritual conquest of self.
So this natural religion appeals to the souls
156
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE TEACHINGS OF JESUS
of men; it appeals to the heart. It tells man
that his brain-mind never will carry him to peace, Follow the
never will carry him to glory, and never will Teachinas
carry him to permanent success, even in this life. of juus
The brain-mind must be educated, of course, for
it is a part of the great scheme of man's existence;
but it is only a part, and it perishes when this
body dies. But the spiritual soul is eternal.
Study the teachings of Jesus and see what
he says of the spiritual soul of man. You do not
have to move away from the simple, pure, un-
dogmatic teachings of Christianity to know that
the spiritual man is the eternal man; that, on the
other hand, the mortal man is the impermanent.
Let the mothers and fathers make this dis-
tinction for their children; let them convince
the children, by their daily example and daily
teachings, of the appeal made to them by Theo-
sophy to live up to higher standards.
Every country needs a higher code of spiritual
nobility and of morality. There must be a
cleaning-aut process in human life. Believing as
we do in evolution, we know we cannot do it
all at once. We believe in the process of self-
157
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
directed evolution, through the pressure of the
An Appet~l Divine Laws which are in the hearts of men.
/or tAe But in the meantime Theosophy's great mes-
C/rilJrm sage, with its natural religious aspect, is appealing
to men and women all over the world to awaken
to the New Time, to the present, to utilize all
opportunities of finding the depth and the beauty
and the magnificent possibilities there are at hand
for the spiritual life of man.
It is a broad statement that I make, but I call
this an age of negation. For, while one man is
pushing ahead and winning his strength of charac-
ter, determined to do his full, rich, beautiful duty,
according to the dictates of his heart, other men
are just half-asleep, because the mind is strained
and the spiritual nature has no chance.
Surely all mothers and fathers should find it
worth while to give real attention to Theosophy.
And if they cannot do it for themselves, or for
their country, or for the sake of principle, they
should do it for their children.
For their children are not here, in a sense,
by their volition. There is no choice in these
things. The children are coming to earth-experi-
158
AN APPEAL FOR THE CHILDREN
ence by the thousands, and what have we to offer
them? We have some education, some refine-
ment, some achievements; we have great minds
and great wealth and all that; but the permanent
spiritual attainments are not yet yours.
So, you mothers and fathers, much as you
love your children, you can agree with me that
you cannot tell what will be their tomorrow.
The struggle for bread and butter is one of the
most cruel afflictions that the human heart has
felt. The war has made it terrible. And the
curse of the war will hang over us and hold on
to us, until we free ourselves from modern re-
ligious delusions.
In spite of the shadows, the Spiritual Man
can arise in the strength of his inner nature, with
the consciousness of his spirituality, with the de-
termination to make of tomorrow a brighter day,
because he then will live in the truest sense.
Think of these thoughts coming out of the minds
of our brilliant men and brilliant scholars! It is
these teachings ofTheosophy that humanity needs
to know.
This is perhaps far-fetched, until it comes
159
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
home to you when you have to meet the problem
of death and your disappointments that are un-
bearable. That is when these thoughts come.
Think! Oh think! And let the Light shine!
Theosophy i.r the Natura/ Religion of Man-
kind. · It is the panacea for all the ills of the
world. There is magic in it. It is to be earned
and lived and brought out, before one can know
the benefit of it.
But if there were nothing else in the world
to induce you to see the possibilities of the great
secrets of these wonderful teachings, the induce-
ment should be to save your children. Let them
know, when they are old enough to raise their
hands to strike, that the same energy must be
directed towards doing things worth while. Do
not wait until they grow to be sixteen or eighteen
years of age and then launch them out into the
world's life unprepared.
So every day, just as you try to teach them
their lessons in right action, just as you give
them their bread and butter and their clothing; so
also care for their souls, and let them know that
wonderful Nature, outside of all the speech of man,
160
EVERYWHERE WE ARE CHALLENGED
will tell the story of what is demanded of them.
So the challenge is at every turn. It is every- EtJerywhere
where. It is right in our hearts. It is in our We are
duties, in our disappointments, in our heartaches. Challenged
But we have been for so many years and
ages held down with the deathening idea that
we were born in sin, that we have lost that quality
of true courage that man must have, if he is to
stand out and declare himself as something more
than a brain-mind or a man who lives for just
seventy or a hundred years and then vanishes.
What I say is said in order truly to interest
you, to challenge you to seek in Theosophy the
answers to your hitherto unanswered questions.
I have no disposition to 'convert' you to TheO-
sophy.
I would have no faith in humanity if I did
not believe in more than one life on earth. I
would not know the real meaning of life. I would
not know the real meaning of justice, unless I
had a conception of the vastness, the superb
greatness, of the royal, sacred, spiritual, dignity
of man, when he is in his right place.
I have preached for thirty years that when

Let Nohle you not see the influence of a true woman in her
Woman home with her children, in her motherhood, in
LeaJtAe her wifehood, meeting her responsibility to the
Wag whole world's children, instead of living just for

the little church, or the little village, or the
little town, or city?
I know that every human being is sacred
before the Higher Law, and consequently we must
treat him as such. We must hold a higher respon-
sibility towards men and women. If they have
made mistakes which discourage us, we must look
in a higher direction. Hope for them, work for
them, and have no censure; for alas! " they know
not ·what they do!'' .
This spirit of brotherhood, which is in the
philosophy of Theosophy- the Natural Religion,
-brings a new quality of conviction and a new
quality of love.
How can you mothers explain your love for
your children? The best teachers and the greatest
scholars never could give you a satisfactory an-
swer as to what love is. It is developed according
162
BLESSINGS MUST BE EARNED
to your degree of understanding, according to
your conception of what life is, and what man is,
and what the soul is.
Grasp the idea of an eternal, over-ruling,
supreme Source of generosity and spiritual gifts,
and that we are m·embers of a Great Spiritual
Family. What belongs to us can never be ours
until we work for it. You rnay think of the
blessings of the world in the rnaterial sense, but
without this inner knowledge they count for little.
Oh the beauty and the wonder of the development
of a man who has glimpsed his own spiritual
nature!
You have to earn what belongs to you. But
earning what belongs to you does not imply all
the rush, and unrest, and dissatisfaction and dis-
.appointments, which we see everywhere along
the way. Put all these things behind you, and
close the door on them. Remember that you are
part of the great Universal Family; and it is
spiritual knowledge that you must have- spiri-
tual power to conquer.
With the ideas of universal brotherhood, and
the great principles of justice, and honor, and

equality, and all these divinely beautiful things
that belong to us really, but which we do not
express, cannot you see that even within a few
years' time there may be a possibility that we
shall never have another war?
My talk is fragmentary, but my earnestness,
and my energy, and my disposition to speak with
you should be enough to show you that I am eager
to help you. I have been very much in earnest
for thirty years in teaching Theosophy, and I
expect to be so until I close my eyes on this
earth-life.
There is no disposition on our part to take
anything from you; neither can we bring you
wealth nor great honors; but we can bring you
the Wonder-teachings of Theosophy, pure and
simple, and true and noble and dignified and moral.
What I say is not said in the spirit of an-
tagonism, nor to persuade you to think as we
think. Not at all. It is to give you a broader
outlook on life than you have already, no matter
how great your culture may be.
We cannot bring to the minds of the people
a right conception of what Theosophy really is
164
THE ESSENTAIL DIVINITY OF MAN
and means unless we can give them a conception
of what man is.... I shall have to brush aside Tlte&1enti(J
many old ideas that you may have in your minds, DiDinity
derived from your education or from your an- of Man
cestors.
Theosophy places man in a very high posi-
tion, because man is essentially divine. Remem-
ber that! He is divine in essence. He has his
weaknesses, his idiosyncrasies, his peculiarities,
and even his vices; but he has within his nature
the possibility of the Divine Man.
I have seen a man so degraded, so far aw:ay
from truth and honor and decency and man-
hood, that he had very little appearance of be-
ing anything but a degraded animal; and yet,
when I am gone, you will some day read of
the wonderful experiences I have had for more
than thirty years in my prison-work and else-
where, in absolutely demonstrating that man
is essentially divine- that he has within him
potential qualities that can pull him up from the
depths of error and place him in a position where
he may go out and meet humanity bravely,
and work manfully, honorably, and divinely.
165
Human
Duality
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
The secret of these contrasts in human na-
ture can be found in the study of Theosophy,
particularly in the subject of hunrtan duality.
Man does not know himself. He has no assurance
of his divine qualities. He uses his tnental facul-
ties exclusively, and consequently his soul is a
stranger to himself. He is a mystery to him-
self, just as you are all mysteries to yourselves.
No matter how much you study, no matter
how much you know, or how far you are ad-
vanced in certain aspects of spiritual knowledge,
you are still mysteries to yourselves, and ever
will be until you find the Theosophical explana-
tion of who and what man is, when,ce he comes,
and whither he goes.
But while man is divine in his possibilities,
yet in the flesh-house in which he llives, he has
the weaknesses·of human nature: this is because
he is dual in nature, and not until the brain can
comprehend that duality, can it appreciate the
spiritual power of man to convert thf~ detrimental
part of his nature and bring him to the knowledge
of himself. Not until then will he find himself.
With this conception of our rational, inner
166
HUMAN DUALITY
consciousness, and of the beauty of life and of
the grandeur of life, we of the human family
ought to have a higher conception of Deity,-
the Omnipresent, Infinite Source of all, with which
conception is spiritually interwoven all humanity.
The experiences that we have in our shadows
and disappointments and unhappinesses are the
experiences that come to the mortal man, not
to the immortal.
Let the mind look into its own nature and
enlarge its conception of the Divine, its conception
of life- of its beauty, and glory, and wonder.
The moment we do this we are lifted above this
plane of living that has brought us so much that
we cannot understand; and we reach a concep-
tion of a great world and of many worlds, more
than we have ever before seen or dreamed of,
and of the greatness of life and of the greatness
of the Divine.
But first of all, man must find himself..
"Man, know thyself!" Man must find him-
self. He must draw the line between the high-
er, spiritual man, and the lower, animal man.
Then he will immediately have a new concep-
167
The Di1ine
;, LMe:
We puni•la
Ourulou
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
tion of the meaning of human life..... .
We are still little children along the path
of life. But if we can acquaint ourselves with
the spiritual side of our natures, we shall find
ourselves above the perplexities of human exist-
ence, growing, ascending.
We must teach our children that the Divine
is love. We must set aside the old idea that
the Divine is a punishing, revengeful, jealous God.
If God is love, God is not punishing and revenge-
ful. The Divine does not punish us. We are
not punished; but we punish ourselves through
our ignorance; by our lack of knowledge of who
we are, why we are here, what life means, and
of the grandeur and the glory of the inner life
of man.
No matter what there is on the othn- side,
the higher nature, the immortal nature, is the
controlling power in man- not in a very large
degree at our present state of evolution, as our
wars and troubles all tell us. But nevertheless
man has the controlling power within himself
to make or mar his life, to bless or to curSe it.
Once he realizes this, then will many of the
168
MAN RELIGIOUS BY NATURE
intricate conditions of human life have their ex-
planation, as belonging only to the mortal being. Man RJ;..
But we must first put the brain-mind where 11ou1 6g
it belongs. Educate the mentality and use it; Nature
but admit that there is something higher, nobler,
something eternal, something that is moving along
the path to overcome and to conquer, not for one
life only, but for many lives. This is what we
are here for. We are here to test ourselves, to
find our spiritual strength, and to be so sure of
it, that it will be impossible for us to drift away
from our divine heritage.
The real history of man is written not in
books, but in his own nature. And the history
of man is understood only as man understands
himself. As he understands and applies his know-
ledge to his life and to his associations, to his
conditions and to his education and his religion
- he truly lives.
The whole scheme of life points to the fact
that man is religious by nature!. He is born re-
ligious. Look into the eyes of your children and
see what they would tell you, if you would listen.
Children and all people should be educated to
169
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
the idea that man is religious by nature. Let it
be the grand symphony running through the life
of man; that he is born religious.
If this is so, why do we have so much sorrow,
so much trouble, so many difficulties? - you will
ask. It is because we place our brain-minds su-
perior to that inner consciousness, that inner
touch, which is the proof of the soul of man.
Think, think, ye men of the present age,
that man, in his essential divinity, can not only
rule himself, but can rule the world! How soon
would the differences and the controversies and
. the antagonisms and all the causes of disharmony
go out of the people!
If a man depends upon the brain-mind alone,
he can reason himself out of reason. But let him
put the brain-mind in its proper place, and then
find that inner state of consciousness, that won-
derful enlightenment, that no words can describe.
When he does this, then he is the master of his
own life, and as far as he develops, he is propor-
tionately the master of the world.
Let us have the teachings of optimism sent
broadcast! Let poor humanity forget all their
170
MAN RELIGIOUS BY NATURE
sorrows, their tears, and their heartaches! Let
them in imagination view a wonderful future,
not only for themselves and their children and
their country, but for the whole world!
Let man have his opportunities by accepting
the idea that he is religious by nature. Let us
set the example, so that he may go forward.
This is the work of Theosophy. We have
no time t<? spend in looking for phenomena. - The
study of phenomena may be very good for a few
scientific minds, who have nothing else to do.
But when the world is in such a state as it is,
suffering for more and more help, when the hearts
of the people are crying for more relief and less
pressure, it is time that the great men and women,
and even those who are not great, should bring
to you, right in your very presence, the absolute
knowledge of the religious nature of man - that
man is religious by birth and through the whole
scheme of nature.
It is not difficult to grasp this problem, and
to meet it in such a way that you challenge
yourself~ You will not have to have a book
to read from; for you will have the book of
171

your own life to study. You will have some-
thing priceless.
I have been for thirty years connected with
the Theosophical Movement, and I could not
enthuse, I could not come to you and talk as I do,
if I did not know the truths of Theosophy, and
besides this, if I had not seen the marvelous
changes in human nature that its teachings have
wrought.
I have taken Theosophy into the prisons;
and the results were not obtained because I did
much; but it was because I had the knowledge
of Theosophy in my life and in my experiences.
So with Theosophy I have gone into the
prisons, and I have seen changes marvelous -
not in a day, not in a week, perhaps not in a
month, perhaps not even in a year; but slowly
and surely through these teachings would come
an awakening of the inner consciousness; and
then would come enlightenment; and all the
temptations in the world would never change
the few whom I am thinking of, who have gone
through this experience; because they hav:e found
it as a treasure- not just to be thought of, not
172
REINCARNATION, A BASIC TEACHING
just a bra!n-mind conception, not something that
has been worked out by a theorist. Reincarna-
1t is something that you, as the great scien- lion, a
tist of your own soul and your own life, must Buic
work out. And when you do this, then the Te4chinl
Light will come..•.
First, realize the duality of man, as the
Ancient Wisdom teaches. It teaches that the
spiritual man lives on forever with his memories
of all that is noble and pure; but that other part
that held the man down, that made him forget
his own soul, that degraded him, all that goes out
when the body dies.
This does not mean that the soul of the one
I speak of immediately ascends to great heights
of spirituality; because you know the basic teach-
ing of Theosophy is Reincarnation. With this
teaching one gets a new conception of life. One
cannot confine himself very long to the idea of
just one life or of a punishing God or of being
born in sin, after one has looked into Theosophy
in an unprejudiced way.
Study this subject in such a way that you
challenge yourselves! Be independent of all criti-
173
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
cism! Theosophy is yours. You ca.n have it
without price. And the more you argue over it,
and try to strain your brain to bring out some
idea or conviction against it before you have
studied it thorough!y, the more you will lose.
But move towards it as a child moves towards its
mother, when it is first learning to walk. T.o that
child its mother is the whole universe. It is en-
tirely done up in that mother.
That is the way we must be when approach-
ing spiritual truth. We should be as little children
at the feet of the Divine Law, so to speak, in our
aspirations, in our whole feeling, in everything.
All these feelings are within man; but they must
be brought out.
If you keep the mind constantly attuned
only to mental conceptions, you do not even have
one half-light on your deepest problems. But if
the mentality can have its education, its oppor-
tunities; and then if the spiritual can have its
place; there is a blending of the realities and of
the tangible and possible things in life. And
when one is in that position, one can so easily set
aside so many of the old and misleading ideas.
174
REINCARNATION, A BASIC TEACHING
Think how humanity today is weighed down
with its own mistakes; how it tries to 'love God,
and it cannot! Why? Because it is not logically
consistent to any human mind to love a God that
punishes, that is revengeful and jealous.
All these misleading teachings about the
Divine should be taken out of your vocabulary,
out of your children,s minds, out of your schools;
and ·in place you should emphasize the love of
the Divine in man, the love of the Divine mani-
fest in each one, because each one of you has an
immortal side to his nature. Thus you can more
readily comprehend to a degree what the Great
Central Source of Knowledge is.
You are here today. Tomorrow you may die.
But the spiritual soul, with its aspirations, with
its conceptions, with its devotion, with its sacri-
fice, with its love for the True and the Beautiful,
lives on and on.
And there we have the man ascending, climb-
ing, with his ideals not a thousand miles away,
not for Sunday only and forgotten on every other
day, but for every day the ideals, the aspirations,
and the supreme consciousness of the essential
175
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
divinity of man as an ever-present reality.
This is the great, divine message that the
Ancient Wisdom- Theosophy-offers you today.

DEATH OR REBIRTH
ALL humanity needs an awakening now. Some-
thing tremendously powerful and impelling The Lar~er
must come to us, if we as a people are to View
begin to find our true places before we make the
Great Change. The old teaching of the one earth-
life is deadening, blinding, and misleading.
We must have a larger view of the great
scheme of life and of evolution. We must be-
come acquainted with our real inner Selves-
the part of us that thinks, and loves, and seeks
to become, not the part that is fashioned accord-
ing to the customs and the moods of the hour or
the age; but the real Being, who lives and thinks
within, and who knows something of the grandeur
and beauty of life. No power on earth can
change its vision.
Now if one or two or a thousand or even a
million can have this larger view, why cannot
the whole race have it? Why must humanity
pray, study, think, hope, doubt, and in the end
179
The Simple
Pot/a
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
lose faith? The fact is that people are unac-
quainted with themselves; and they cannot be
familiar with the inner and Divine Laws of life
until they are 'up and doing.' The life of men
with its attractions and its duties is so very little
in comparison with what it might be for each
living soul.
In the face of death, the real Theosophist
can smile, while many despair. He can rejoice,
while others are sad; because he knows that
life is eternal, while the great majority merely
hope.
How much do you know of what was before
you were born, or what is to come after you have
passed on? How much knowledge have you of
yourself and of the laws governing your inner
life? How much can you explain of the great
mysteries of life and death -or rebirth?
You may be very learned, very proficient, with
no end of erudition; you may be one of the bright-
est lights on the horizon of intellectual achieve-
ments; but alas! there is still something missing.
What humanity needs today is to take the simple
path to the Truth in order to gain real Knowledge.
180
THE SIMPLE PATH
What have you in your knowledge of the
future that will recompense you for being born
on earth, for living and suffering here? This is
the great question which Theosophy answers.
The true Theosophist is one who looks at
life rationally, accepts broader views thereof,
moves out into the great silent world of Thought,
and finds himself aspiring to reach the mountain-
tops, where the sunlight of Truth dispels the
darkness of ignorance. It is the simple facts of
man's inner spiritual life that he must know be-
fore he can do justice to himself, to his neighbor,
and to his country.
No matter how much good a man may do,
if he has not the basic idea of the eternity of life,
of its abundance, of the glory and the grandeur
of it, it is a wonder to me how he lives at all.
The comfort in the teachings of Theosophy
is that they bring to humanity the knowledge of
its spiritual heritage- of that which belongs to
it by divine right, that spiritual knowledge which
should be ours from birth·
, through childhood,
up to manhood and womanhood, and onwards.
This spiritual knowledge, working in harmony

of INd}, When death comes, the majority of people
look upon it with fear and terror or with ques-
tioning and doubt. But to the Theosophist, death
means real life - rebirth.
In order to understand the doctrine of Rein-
carnation, we must view human life and evolu-
tion in a broader and deeper sense than most
people are accustomed to. We must know some-
thing of the majestic Divine Laws that hold us
in their keeping. We must know something of
whence we came and whither we go, and what
is the purpose of life.
If the human race as a whole had any con-
iidence in the reality of life, in the great inner,
sacred truths, there would be found the know-
ledge necessary to meet many of the difficulties
we cannot overcome now. There would then be
no differences among individuals or nations.
There would be no wars.
Man, being essentially divine, has within his
own inner nature all the godlike qualities that
182 .
THE OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF DEATH
can be evoked and can be lived; and indeed are
being lived by a certain class of people, though of
course very imperfectly as yet.
When people, either educated or uneducated,
can look upon life as optimistically as do the Theo-
sophists, then we may have some hope for hu-
manity. We must have such hope; we must
believe in ourselves; we must believe in our god-
like natures; we must believe that brotherhood
is a fact in nature; and that the world that most
of us live in, is a ·very small world in comparison
with the great one that we have next to know.
Because we are still half asleep; because we
are so held down by the ignorance of the age and
by the despotism of mere intellectualism, we have
not yet found ourselves out in the great blue of
life; we have not the courage to go to the top of
the mountains; we have not confidence enough
in ourselves to differ from others in order that
the truth may be made plain to all. Thus we
may ultimately work for the great human family,
understandingly and harmoniously.
The question of death requires deep thought
as well as a rational view of eternal life. It
183
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
would be absurd to talk of Reincarnation, of our
souls living on through etemity, ~oving on
through different states and conditions until they
reach perfection- it would be far-fetched and
laughable to the man who has no conception of
the greatness of life and of the Divine Laws, nor
of the mercy and splendor and grandeur to be
found in even his daily experiences; but when
one has the higher intelligence and spiritual know-
ledge united with what he has acquired through
study and observation, it is all so simple and clear!
To most people, death is gloomy; but to the
Theosophist death is very beautiful. For before
death comes, we have learned through the teach-
ings of Theosophy- the Ancient Wisdom,- that
the real man, the spiritual soul, is eternal.
How can even the smallest mind that thinks
at all limit man's evolution and his aspirations
to one short earth-life? Such a limited concep-
tion is both a tragedy and a comedy. I cannot
see how one can move away from the teaching
of Reincarnation, once it has been clearly ex-
plained to him.
It is not susceptible of proof to one who is
184
KNOWLEDGE VERSUS PROOF
determined in advance not to accept it; but how
little we should know, if we threw aside every- Knowledge
thing that we could not immediately prove! oer8U$
Why, no one, with all his knowledge, and all Proof
his hopes and dreams, can explain what real love
is. And yet we know it exists. When we have
grown wiser, and better understand the great
truths of Theosophy, true love will have such a
mighty meaning that it will be the message of
all ages for humanity. For real love is eternal;
we know it is so; and how can it be eternal, if
we have only seventy-five or one hundred years
in which to live and express it?
The reason we know so 1ittle about these
spiritual things, is because we keep too much
away from them. We do not go close enough to
the secrets of our own inner natures. We do
not search our own hearts enough. We have not
faith enough in ourselves. Our vision is not
broad enough.
The beauty of life is in the knowledge gained
from experience. But one must work for this
knowledge. If he does not work for it, he does
not get it. And when the work of one lifetime
185
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
is done, he is ready for another life-experience.
I do not see why any one should have trouble in
accepting this idea. It is vastly more easy to
accept than many teachings which the world has
accepted- not to its benefit.
Death is rebirth. We Theosophists are as
confident that the soul lives on, as we are that
the sun will shine tomorrow. I know that my
mother lives; and I. know it in the deepest and
truest sense; and I know that the same path
that she trod- if I choose to make the effort
that she did- I shall find also.
There can be no separation in true spiritual
love. Consequently at times, at fitting periods
in our evolution from one life to another, there
must. be renewed associations on some spiritual
plane, which we cannot talk about, but which
we know exist.
How little we know, and how much is at
hand to know! It is ours to find within our
own hearts.
There is no death in the truest sense. The
joy that I have in the thought of eternal life,
compels me to speak of it with great gladness
186
DEATH IS REBIRTH
and much intensity. I do not wish any one to
miss the glories of the great Central Source of
All - of the Divine, and of the mercy and the
justice of the Higher Law.
If we had the right conception of this Higher
Law, we should better understand the meaning
of the apparent injustices of life, and half our
difficulties would be passed over; for we would
have the knowledge how to meet them.
And if we could find men and women so im-
bued with confidence in themselves- not in ego-
ism, or anything of that sort~ but with con-
fidence in their own essential divinity and in the
mercy of the Higher Law, they would under-
stand that death is simply a change -just a
vacation from the school of earth-life for a time;
and that eventually that which belongs to us by
divine right will be ours. We cannot lose it.
Nothing is lost in the economy of nature.
Each one can find within himself the great
secret of life and know that the spiritual soul of
man is immortal; there is no death; love is
eternal, and the Divine is all-embracing and
infinite, and therefore impersonal.
187
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
What is most needed is knowledge of the self.
Know yourselves, trust yourselves, be growing
all the time, ever advancing, climbing ever up-
wards! Then when death takes your loved ones,
you will have smiles instead of shadows; you will
have joy in your eyes instead of tears; because
your souls will have told you that, man being
immortal, the Divine love unlimited, and the
Higher Law divinely just, all is well for hu-
.
mantty.
It is the duty of all to apply spiritual know-
ledge to the daily life and to make this cleaner
than ever before, ever purer, more optimistic,
more courageous, more affectionate, of greater
service, and nearer to the simple and beauti-
ful truth of love.

PROSPERITY AND THE POVERTY
OF OUR IDEALS
M
y effort is to bring home to the minds of
my listeners the fact that Theosophy, as Tile Magic
presented by the original Theosophical So- PoUJer of
ciety, which I have the honor to direct, is a very Silence
serious study.
It is so serious that, in spite of all the opposi-
tion it has had since H. P. Blavatsky introduced
it to the western world in the seventies of last
century, in spite of all the chaos and confusion
that we find in human life, in spite of all the vice,
and sorrow, and degradation everywhere, still it
is a growing factor, not only in this country, but
all over the world.
I have thought much on this subject, and
when I find myself a little older and too tired to
talk, I have decided that I may write a book on
some of my impressions of how Theosophy has
found its way into the hearts of many people
throughout the world. I do not think it has been
191
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
so much through what has been said, nor even
through the great propaganda that we have con-
ducted in all parts of the globe. Moreover, I do
not believe that the books we publish, which are so
tremendously forceful- even some of H. P. Bla-
vatsky's- have done as much good as has been
accomplished in a way that we cannot see nor
hear, for we have not the eyes to see nor the
ears to hear. Our intuition, like that of our an-
cestors for many, many ages, has been asleep.
But in the sacredness of the silence, great
and wonderful things are done. It is time that
our present civilization woke up to this fact.
One has not to move very far away from
himself to realize that the very best thoughts he
has ever had, have remained for the most part
unuttered. Man's greatest aspirations, his bright-
est dreams, his grandest hopes, have been so deep
in his heart-life, in his mind, and in the silent
yearnings of his better nature, that no words
could utter them- so sacred are they and so
little understood.
In spite of all the great efforts that have
been made to spread the Truth, I hold that this
192
THE MAGIC P.OWEil OF SILENCE
silent power in our hearts, in our longings, in our
unuttered prayers, tells of even better things for
humanity all the time, just as far as our motives
are unselfish and impersonal.
Oh if every man today could have just the one
living idea of his own essential divinity, of his
everlasting, eternal life, of his being a part of Deity's
greatfamily!
Nothing is lost. Consider everything that
happens in our waking and in our sleeping, in
our thinking and in our talking, and still more
in our s~lences. Is it understood or even dreamed,
that one's most beautiful and helpful ideas come
in the silence?.
Think of the glory and mystery of the beauti-
ful flowers! In the early springtime we have
little evidence that anything is waiting for us;
and then, almost in a day, from all parts of the
earth, everywhere, come these beautiful messen-
gers of silence! There is certainly a mystery
about them. We cannot·yet fully tell what the
wonderful processes are that have brought these
flowers to such perfection. We do not know how
long ago the first seed of them was planted!
193
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
There is so much that we meet in our every-
day lives that we cannot explain, that we do not
understand. And the reason is that we have
removed ourselves so far away from our higher
source of knowledge - the better part of us, the
nobler, aspiring, eternal part, which is to be
found only in the silence.
The other part of us belon~s in a sense only
to the outer world, to the mortal man, to the one
lifetime. But Theosophy gives us the beautiful
message that we shall live again and again!
Hug to your heart the idea that you are
divine in essence. Believe that the best of your-
self is to be found in the silence, when your soul
is seeking recognition. Yet- it is so lonely!
The soul of humanity is so lonely, because men
live so much on the outer plane and so little in
the inner field of the aspirations, and the hopes,
and the consciousness of their essential divinity.
Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, that wonderful
Russian woman who founded the original Theo-
sophical Society of modern times, was the great
character of her age. She brought to the western
world the teachings of the Ancient Wisdom and

llELIANCE UPON THE DIVINITY WITHIN
of the deeper meaning of Universal Brotherhood.
My purpose, as was hers, is to bring home
to the human mind the consciousness of its own
essential divinity, of its power to direct and con-
trol its own life.
We have been educated for ages to look
outside of ourselves for help; so most people
have tried to penetrate through the mysteries of
life with the brain-mind alone, and have never
reached the Real; because they have depended
upon external help instead of retiring into the
silence of their deeper natures and feeling their
own heart-throbs, so to speak, and challenging
and questioning themselves. They do not reach
It, because struggling humanity has for ages been
continually reminded of its mistakes, its weak-
. ' . ,
nesses, tts stns.
So men have had little time left for finding
out who they are, where they come from, and
whither they go. They have had little to satisfy
their souls. There are some things that may
satisfy a limited mind- the brain-mind,- be-
cause that mind may be yet psychologized with
the unrest of the age. It ·may mean well, but

THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
it does not know itself; consequently it does not
aspire. But there are thousands and thousands
in the world today who are seeking the Light
and the Truth.
This brings me to my subject of the day:
'Prosperity and the Poverty of our Ideals.'
I shall speak of America in particular. We
cannot help acknowledging that in the material
sense America is prosperous; and as the country
advances in its outward prosperity, so do the
people to a degree. But they do not reach the
deeper needs of their natures in this way; and
bear in mind, what they do get through such
prosperity is only for this one life, unless they are
of the kind that believe there is more Light;
and therefore long for, strive for, and work un-
tiringly for, more Light.
Such as these are moving in quite another
direction than those entirely occupied with ma-
terial prosperity. They have a superb trust;
because, when one is absolutely conscious of his
own essential divinity, the Light breaks, the veil
is lifted, and life has a new meaning.
In the great scheme ofour spiritual evolution,
196
TOLERANCE AND SELF-KNOWLEDGE
it was intended that we should love one another
in the truest sense - be brothers, live in the
spirit of brotherhood. If we so lived and had the
knowledge of our own essential divinity, all the
rest that our souls long for would come. But
without this key, which Theosophy gives, there
is no way to solve the perplexing problems which
confront us.
It is intended in the great plan of the uni-
verse that man should know himself. The great-
est writers, iavants, scientists, even the world's
geniuses, ·go just so far, and they cannot go be-
yond; because they have not the wonderful key,
which Theosophy gives, which is that man is
divine in essence. They do not see beyond
this life.
I am not antagonistic towards anyone. I do
not believe in interfering with other peoples' re-
ligion. I desire to be tolerant; for I .do not know
what I would accept as a belief now, if I had lived
in the same environment in which others have
lived. Consequently the· spirit of charity and
great tolerance must grow in one's nature.
Conscious of man's essential divinity, and
197
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
still more conscious of the love of the Great
The Force Central Source of Life, all the rest is cared for,
of Genuine if I am doing my duty, if I am living according
TAeoMJpAy to the best knowledge I have, and especially if,
going beyond that, I am ever seeking more
knowledge.
Theosophy is such a telling and lasting force
in a man's life! Speak with any real Theosophist
on the subject.
Do not look upon the idea of man's essential
divinity and his eternal life as such a far-away
idea! Consider it more deeply, and then look
out into Nature and see what she will tell you.
Then come back to the realm of deeper thought
and face yourself with knowledge, with enlighten-
ment, with larger ~rust, conscious of the power
to overcome through this trust.
Know well that you are challenged by the
Divine Laws of life! It is not intended that you
should be disconsolate or that you .should think
you are such wretched sinners! Such a belief
has no place in the Great Scheme of Eternal Life,
which is all Love.
Reach out into the atmosphere of Love!
198
THE FORCE OF GENUINE THEOSOPHY
Think of it, work for it, live for it, serve for it!
Then you will find the key that brings you very
close to your heart-home,- a touch of that Peace
that you forever crave.
Every human face tells its story in a different
way; because we have all grown up differently
and in different environments. So take the idea
of self-directed evolution, in connexion with what
I have said: that man has within himself the
inner knowledge of his essential divinity and is
able to direct his destiny- to make it strong~
splendid, pure, and full of service, or otherwise.
This is a picture that I often think of.
It is remarkable that, in spite of all the gran-
deur and beauty of life, we allow ourselves - not
intentionally or understandingly, but ignorantly,-
to drift into the vortex of the world's chaos, con-
fusion, doubt, fear, restlessness, and despair. And
it is out of that condition that Theosophy is
breaking a way. It proclaims that every man
is his own savior: he can curse his life or he
can bless it!
Until a man has the knowledge of his own
essential divinity, it is quite out of place for me
199
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
to think for a moment that he is to be condemned
for what he did not know! He is not to be con-
demned for the mistakes he has made, when look-
ing outside for the Light, while it was within.
But he is to blame, if he continues doing so,
after he knows that there is another door open
for him, and that all he has to do is to enter in.
The stars and the light and the very at·
mosphere challenge every man. But first he must
challenge himself. Yea, verily, he must chal-
lenge himself!
When we think along these lines we are out
in a vast field of thought. We no longer suppose
that this is the only world. We learn of the
hundreds of other worlds, and the hundreds of
other planets.
And then we might possibly have courage
enough to believe that we have lived before!
And that some part of the knowledge that we
have in our lives now, we have had before!
But our lives are still unfinished; because,
if man is essentially divine, eternal, one wonders
if a rational mind could conceive of man living
only seventy-seven or one hundred years~ just
200
THE POVERTY OF IDEALS
one lifetime in· which to solve this great riddle
of eternity!
There is a great poverty of ideals in human
life today. The best of them are unexpressed.
What field does the world offer in order fully to
live out our ideals? Where is the comradeship,
or the education, that will take us out of our
limitations into a larger view of life and a larger
view of the majesty of the Infinite Laws, and the
glory of living? In very truth·, humanity is cry-
ing today for the peace that comes from living
out our.inner ideals! Even the unborn children
are calling for it!
Aye, even those whom we loved, who have
gone on ahead, are not at peace. They cannot
be at peace while they are waiting for us. Is it
not true that Love is eternal, holds us fast, and
binds us closely together? And surely these ties
are not broken by death!
While, as I said, material prosperity belongs
only to this one life, yet surely you do not think
for a moment that I would not wish you pros-
perity! But to be so absorbed in material gain
in the outer life as to imagine that that is all,
201
The Pooerly
of Ideals
anJ the Cry
/or Peace
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
or that it is going to bring you the peace that your
hearts crave- nay, nay! - it is only transitory.
If this material prosperity is sustained by
honest dealing and right conduct, it is a part of
the scheme of life. But otherwise there is nothing
to it. Better be out in the woods with no shelter,
than to be living as many are living today, gain-
ing their prosperity at the expense of their suffer-
ing brothers!
As I think back to twenty years ago, I am
more and more impressed with the poverty of
our ideals today. How different men and women
were then! How different were our ideals! How
different our customs were! How different our
habits of thought!
And the question I often ask myself is, have
we advanced? Has civilization reached a point
where we can speak with pride of it as a glorious
civilization? No, we cannot do it, because we
must ever keep in mind those fellow human beings,
who are going ~own hill all the time, losing their
way; those who have no faith, no love; those who
have been overlooked and are drifting downwards.
We must be doing something more than we
202
THE POVERTY OF IDEALS
have ever done, and we must do this very soon.
We must raise the ideals of men to a higher
standard. Too many people- not all, thank the
gods! - have their ideals for Sunday only and
forget them the rest of the week.
Theosophy offers humanity a philosophy of
life that is so optimistic, that it brings to the
realization of all, the wonderful power of changing
one's own life. Surely every man and woman in
the world today can do better than they have
done!
The silent power that I spoke of is every-
where. You will not always see it under the name
of Theosophy. You will find it in the kingdom
of Nature, in the woods, in the sound of the
waves as they wash the shore, in the stars as they
speak their silent language to us, and in the
silence of human hearts everywhere.
And then your mind will go beyond into a
grander vista of another world and more superb
possibilities for all- even for the very least of us.
The things you have lost or missed in this
life, that really belong to your souls, can be
yours; because Theosophy declares that eyery-
203
A Pt.
/or the

THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
one has another chance- always another chance!
So let us work for the grander ideals and
discourage anything and everything that leads to
the extreme.
Let us bring our boys and girls into a common-
sense line of action- a more quiet, more thought-
ful way of living and growing. Pray let them
not suffer from our poverty of ideals! And he-
cause these ideals are not tangible, do not imagine
they are not real! They are the greatest realities
of our existence.
There are ofcourse very good men and women
everywhere; but they are the exceptions. And
when I refer to the poverty of our ideals in this
country, and indeed in other countries as well,
I am not referring to our beautiful buildings, our
splendid school-edifices, our great inventions, nor
to the world's enormous wealth of material pos-
sessions. No, I am talking about our children,
our boys and girls, who walk our streets every day:
I am thinking about them.
Most of them are not going the right way;
many of them are drifting the wrong way- some
rapidly, others slowly and insidiously. There is
204
A PLEA FOR THE YOUTH
no real c·
hance for them. Why? .Because high
ideals are not presented to them from Monday
morning until Saturday night, as they should be.
On the contrary, they have drummed into their
ears, and they read in the newspapers and every-
where they turn: Dollars! Dollars!
Now of course the dollar-and-cent question
has its place; but our minds are made for some-
thing more! They are made to do grand think-
ing, to echo the thoughts of our higher natures!
When the body dies, the brain-mind dies
with it. What does go on forever is that etern.al,
spiritual part, the spiritual soul, the essential
divinity that I have told you of.
. The cry of the age is: "More light! More
light!" w~ must therefore make truth so easy
to understand, .that even the children can grasp
it, and ·grow in it, and conquer, ~nd .
find the joy
of living!
Nowadays our boys and girls are not happy
unless they are moving about,. here, there, and
everywhere. They think they must have the
fever of excitement in their every-day lives.
The restlessness of the youth is menacing.
205
THE TllAVAIL OF THE SOUL
To change this condition, make your homes
Spiritual more attractive in the truest sense; illumine them
&juoena- with the light of real Knowledge; bring them to
lion a condition where your children will know that
you have found the right way. Then you will
begin to accentuate something new in your own
souls, that will re-echo in your children and
in all.
Of course you must have your outward life
and you must work for the dollars and cents
rationally. But you must divide your time and
give to your souls, to your consciences, and to
those you love, a tribute of the gods, so to speak;
for such it proves to be, when a man finds in this
noisy world of ours, that humanity is divine in
essence, and that nothing is lost in the Great
Scheme of Life. This gives a man a larger view,
another view, and still another, which are not
contradictory, but are the result of his continu-
ous growth, of his deep aspirations, strengthened
by his spiritual will.
One need not be surprised if he looks in
the glass and finds that some of his wrinkles
have gone out of his face, that his sorrow and
206
SPIRITUAL REJUVENATION
despair have begun to vanish. He will begin to
find in himself secrets of a divine love that warms
his soul and enlightens his mind, and enables
him to give courage to others. Perhaps he will
find in his own home new opportunities and ways
of speaking more kindly and building more se-
curely and more richly for the future, through his
knowledge of the everlasting life.
But we need not wait for another life. Every
moment can be made so precious that ere long we
shall have the evidence of true, splendid, royal
ideals active in the world for our children, taking
the place of all that distressed us yesterday.
Then we shall find men and women growing more
closely to the Divine Plan, more gloriously and
splendidly for their fatherhood and motherhood,
and for the greater good of all humanity.

DOES THEOSOPHY BUILD OR DESTROY?
D
OES Theosophy build or destroy? Of course,
if one asks this question of people in general, TAe TAeme
one will receive in answer their opinions
according to their knowledge. But as I am treat-
ing the subject this afternoon, being a Theo-
sophist, I shall naturally treat it from a Theo-
sophical standpoint.
It may be possible that I can give a few
ideas that may help you in your lives and thus
benefit your country and benefit the world, be-
cause, if we can get into our minds the deep and
profound meaning of Brotherhood, which Theo-
sophy teaches, and if we can commence to live
the life of Brotherhood, we shall then have no
divisions, and there will be no wars.
Struggle, suffering, and conflict, are the re-
sult of people being so separated in interest; they
are not united; one nation is against another;
and it is fight, and battle, and struggle for bread
and butter all along the way: when all we have
211
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
to do is to find the secret of living and to realize
that the life of man is a true, mighty scheme.
Man is the commanding figure in life. He is
the summit of its expression on earth.
When one thinks of that, every one - even
the most discouraged, the most disappointed, the
most disheartened - can rise in the conscious-
ness that it is a solemn fact that every man is
essentially divine in nature, and that he has the
power within him to know this truth; and when
he knows it he will apply it to his life; and when
he applies it, he will live more truly, and then
his life will be one of joy, of service, of helpful-
ness, and of peace, instead of what it is now.
In saying this, I am beginning to show you
that Theosophy is constructive. Theosophr de-
stroys error, destroys mistakes, destroys ignorance.
It leads man away from the dark shadows of life
to the beauty and charm of true living, and to
the consciousness of soul-wisdom, which is that
knowledge of religion that is born in man.
One cannot go away from the fact that we
are religious by birth, by ancestry, and by nature.
Our tendency is to seek the Truth. And if we
212
THEOSOPHICAL OPTIMISM
can seek Truth with confidence in the self, in other
people, in our country and in other countries - Theosophi--
if we c~n have that sweet, warm, beautiful, bind- cal Optimism
ing force of brotherly love with us constantly,
we shall be as happy as Nature is. Nature is
very wonderful and very beautiful as you know.
It teaches.
Theosophy aims to set aside and eliminate
all the shadows and the disappointments and the
discouragements that come into man's life. I
have not to spend any time in telling about how
discouraging are the conditions in the world today.
And why are they so? It is because humanity
has not the Light, it has not the Knowledge, it is
yet ignorant of its royal heritage and its possi-
bilities.
And so, instead of blaming and criticizing
man, let us believe in man in a new way. Many
have endeavored to bring out this idea, but they
have not hit the mark. And they have not hit
the mark because they are so overburdened and
overshadowed with pessimism, with doubt, with
timidity.
Now, that is not the religion to teach. Theo-
213
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
sophy teaches that man must have hope; and it
must be built upon the Heart-doctrine, out of
his own nature. It must be built upon the pic-
tures or the visions that he has of the growth of
his own life. And one cannot be satisfied with
the same thing every day, because one does not
grow if he accepts only the things that satisfied
him a few years ago. Every day should add
something to one's knowledge.
Knowledge of what? Knowledge of oneself,
knowledge of the Divine Laws that govern life.
When one can find this knowledge and apply it
to his life, he has touched magic. To a large
degree he sweeps away all the difficulties in his
life- the disappointments, the overshadowings,
the limitations, and the over-humility. One
awakens every morning with a consciousness that
something new has happened: a great light has
come; that the great blessings of the eternal
truths of life are here, close to us daily.
Then one begins to see that man is not to be
set aside; he is not to be belittled. Nor can he
ever find the peace and the joy and the know-
ledge of living, until he has found himself. He
214
THE ETERNAL MAN
may read all the books, have all the teachers,
listen to all the preachers, but never will he win, The Eternal
in the truest sense, until he finds his own heart, Man
his own soul, and believes in the eternity of man's
spiritual nature. When this happens, one can
very easily realize that something wonderful comes
to a man who has long lived in the shadows of
discouragement and then suddenly finds himself
in the light, aspiring, becoming.
Now, according to Theosophy, as I under-
stand it, we are never alone; because within this
body of ours, within this part that in seventy-
seven or a hundred years dies, is the inner part,
the eternal part, which lives and goes on forever.
That is the Spiritual Soul of man.
And the soul is traveling on its pathway of
spiritual attainment. It is progressing, it is
climbing the mountains each time it is reborn,
each time it suffers to gain more knowledge.
That is growth.
Move away from all the weights and shadows
that are upon you, and love yourself- your in-
ner Spiritual Self- for truth's sake! Love that
Self that you may have the power to serve others!
215
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
Love it, because you are loving the eternal man!
But the trouble with humanity is that it sees
and loves the outer man, the physical man, the
mental man, and it thinks that this is the whole
thing. But the other Man, the Real Man- which
is the spiritual, eternal nature- this has very
little attention given to it.
Cease dwelling on your sorrows and troubles,
and go out into the bright light of Truth, out into
the great hopes! Build castles for yourselves!
Build vistas! Let them be merely from the brain-
mind, if you can do no better, but build them
high towards the Spirit, and plan them today,
that tomorrow shall bring you more light, more
knowledge, more courage, and more determina-
tion to win out, not just for this one life, but for
your soul's sake and for humanity's sake.
Humanity is waiting for humanity, and the
hearts of men are bleeding for that help and that
quality that can be given; not from one man
alone, but from that unity of force, that wonderful
bond of brotherhood, that must come and bring
us to a position where we can look out over the
tops of the mountains. There, instead ofstruggling
216
THE APPEAL OF THEOSOPHY
with our difficulties, we can rise above them.
When we reach that position, then we are The Ap..
constructing, then we are building for the future peal of
-not just for seventy-five or a hundred years; Theosophy
but we are building the very thought-atmosphere
that we live in, we are building our country for
even better things; we are purifying our politics
with a new life, through the spiritual energy
and will of man.
This little talk of mine is of very little sig-
nificance perhaps to some. But if one studied
our Theosophical books, he would find the sig-
nificance of what I am saying..
Theosophy's appeal is to those who love the
Truth, who are seeking more Light, who are not
satisfied with the conditions of the world, who are
trying to bring more peace and real happiness
to mankind, to those who love their children
Theosophically, and would pave the way for them
and make a golden path that they may tread,
rather than struggle along the path of sorrow.
It is to these that Theosophy appeals.
There is no disposition on my part or any
true Theosophist's to disturb those who are satis-
217
The
Pruent
Moment
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
fied in their spiritual knowledge. There is no
attempt to destroy. There is no attempt to do
away with anything that is good. There is no
attempt to teach Theosophy except for the pur-
pose of bringing more sacredly to every man the
knowledge of his spiritual rights and duties, so
that he may live in those duties and rights happily
and truly, that he may sustain his country with
such force of truth and higher patriotism, that it
will be impossible to have war.
War is in the air. We have not passed it yet.
And it is for us, just this growing body of people
in the right state of mind, to be up and doing.
One can never know what such a body can do.
The real thing is to construct, and to con-
struct today, not preach construction today and
tomorrow do nothing. No! That is not the
way to do. The way to do is to live every day
in such manner that the next day may be a better
one, that there may be more courage tomorrow
than today.
Follow the simple teachings that Jesus called
the Christ taught- not the teachings that others
have added to what he taught. Live in the
218
MAN IS A SOUL
spirit of brotherhood and keep yourselves in the
sunshine! If the shadows are over the hills, know Man i3
that they are good. The rain and the clouds are a Soul
also needed for vegetation. But wait until to-
morrow, and build, construct in the sunlight and
joy of life!
By doing this, one destroys error and stands
before the world as an example of spiritual living
- not a half-way life, not a timid life, not an
apologetic life, not shams, but real things.
It is wonderful to realize that man is a soul,
that he is a part of the Universe, and that no-
body can rob him of this fact: that he has within
him the power to conquer, to overcome, and
to become. Man can stand before the world as
one who knows his soul, who knows the truth
that is before him, and who is ever striving to
grow in this knowledge.
Whe~ one stops to think of life as it is, one
realizes that we are little children. The best of
us, the most studious, the most advanced in
thought, experience, and education, know very
little ofhuman life; indeed, very little of anything.
The one essential for us, if we are to round
219
The Mi&-
&ion of
Theo&ophy
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
out our characters and become anything that ap-
proximates to our ideals of manhood and woman-
hood, is that we shall know ourselves. We must
know the secrets of living. We must know what
it means to live nobly and honorably and truly,
and with such dignity and pqwer that truth will
manifest through us.
So the mission of Theosophy is to teach man
to construct- to build, to make everything better
today than it was yesterday for humankind; so
that each may find within himself the key to the
secret of governing his own life and bringing it
into harmony with other lives. Thus there will
be a united family of human beings all over the
world, so strong, so impregnable, so impersonal,
that war cannot come. When you demolish the
spirit of warfare and make it disappear, you are
beginning to climb the mountains - to reach
the Light.
There is no attempt on the part of the So-
ciety which I represent to 'convert' you, because
we do not believe in 'conversion' in the ordi-
nary sense.
We believe in every man finding within him-
220
THE MISSION OF THEOSOPHY
self the power to change his life, to look into his
own heart, into his own soul, to challenge him-
self, to find his weaknesses and overcome them;
to see his strength and try to glorify the Divine
and glorify Nature and glorify human life, and
glorify his own life through a knowledge of him-
self and of his essential divinity. When one
reaches this point of understanding, he will see
only sunshine and cheerfulness.
Take the real Theosophists as examples. I do
not mean those counterfeits that you must know
in this country as in other countries, who are
imposing a 'Coming Christ' upon the credulous.
(You know there are counterfeits to every true
coin.) But the members of the Universal Brother-
hood and Theosophical Society are united, and
working unselfishly, without salary, without hon-
ors, without fame, simply working assiduously
every day to bring the whole human family into
a better condition - into a larger trust and more
happiness.
And it does not take great oratory or a very
gifted person to bring home to one the hidden
impulses of the heart, and all the hopes and
221
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
aspirations that have never been answered, and
to solve all the questions and doubts.
All these problems must be solved before
humanity can find its way, before the best nation
can find its real nationality, before the unity
among men and women shall be of such a kind
that it cannot be broken, because the spirit of
brotherly love, which Jesus taught, when he said
"Love ye one another," will then be triumphant.
That is the spirit that must exist in the hearts
ofmen.
What sublime and magic feelings these words
bring up! Jesus did not tell you to hate each
other or to destroy each other! He did not tell
you to punish each other! He told you to love
one another.
It is the very simple teachings of Theosophy
- which is as old as the ages, far, far older than
Jesus Christ's time,- that give the touch that
brings man back to his own, to his heritage, to
his rights, and to the undeniable facts that he is
a soul, and that he has the power within himself
to bless or curse his own life.
How is it that you have so many aspirations
222
•
THERE IS NO DEATH
and so few of them are fulfilled? How is it that
you long for the day when all men shall be at There i&
peace with one another and with their own souls, no Death
- for the day when you may understand the
future, when the conviction will come to you in
such a way that you cannot dispute it, that
there is no Death, that what we call death is but
a transition, a change, that we live here for seventy-
five or a hundred years, and then instead of dying
out or going to some place in space- none of
us being sure of which place we are going to! -
our souls do but take a needed rest, before resum-
ing the duties of earth-life again in a new hu-
man form?
It is utterly impossible for a human mind
that is clear in confidence in his own soul and in
himself to accept the idea that the Divine- the
great, eternal, all-loving Deity, which your own
Bible tells you about- could ever have planned
for you to go through the suffering you have
endured.
No! The suffering which humanity has had
for ages, has been inflicted by man himself. He
does not do it intentionally. He does not know
223
•
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
why he does it. And unless he has the teachings
DitJine of Theosophy to fortify his mind and soul, he
LoDe must be very much staggered, and deeply afflicted
with doubt.
But Theosophy teaches that spiritual man
is eternal; that the body lives seventy or a hun-
dred years, and then it, the physical life, tired
and worn out, dies; but the soul lives on, in just
the same way that the trees live on through the
seasons. You see them springing into sunshine
in the summer with their beautiful foliage. And
when the winter comes, the leaves all disappear.
If you were a stranger and had never seen a
tree before, you would say it was dead. But it
is not dead, because the spirit of nature, the
elements of nature, never die. The real prin-
ciple of the tree is not changed. Next year you
see fresh leaves. But they are not the same
leaves. They are, in a sense, a copy of the leaves
of the previous year. The life of man is analogous.
Put yourselves into this position: that the
God that you must revere, and the God that you
must follow, must be a God of Love.
Your God cannot be unmerciful, because
224
DIVINE LOVE
Divinity is perfect. Divinity cannot punish you,
because Divinity is perfect. Divinity does not
place·you on this earth and then punish you for
being here! You punish yourselves- possibly not
today or yesterday, but somewhere along the
gamut-pathway of your lives, you have sown
seeds which have yielded their harvest of misery,
and doubt, and suffering.
I am not talking merely to hear myself talk;
I am talking from conviction. I am associated
in my Society with thousands all over the world,
w.ho were like you before, and but for Theo-
sophy might have had no hope of anything be-
yond this life of sadness and trouble and dis-
appointment and heartache and lack of faith in
humans and sometimes lack of faith in the Divine.
Look within your own natures and believe
that man is essentially divine!
But when you reach this position of realizing
that the great Eternal Light is centered in man,
as a source of light and help and strength to him,
your conviction of the possibility of spiritual life
and the pos~ibilities of another life and the eter-
.nity of man, is rekindled. So is your love of the
225
THE TllAVA.IL OF THE SOUL
Divine, of the Eternal, in such a way that your
confidence is reborn.
When you understand this, you will find
something new in your blood, something new in
your heart, something new in your mind. You
will have new hope, more trust, a broader vista,
that will tell you of the mercy of the Divine or the
great Source of Life, and will bring home to you in
the saddest moment of life the compensation which
you cannot get in any other way.
You may not believe in it today. But we
Theosophists are very broad-minded and chari-
table. We know you are in the hands of this
Divine Law, and that sometime or somewhere,
you will meet that which belongs to you. So if
you miss it today, you may meet it tomorrow.
One has no time to talk of the different de-
grees of intelligence or the different degrees of
belief or the different degrees of goodness and
kindness in humanity. One must discover these
things for himself.
But it does not take very long for a man
who is weighed down and discouraged to reach
out and to meet life with a belief that there
226
THE HEART-DOCTRINE
is something noble and splendid in the hearts
of all men, something that has not been ex- Tlte Heart·
pressed, something that has not been awakened. Doctrine
My experience in my work for the shut-ins
in the prisons for more than thirty years has been
very remarkable. No prisoner ever lost anything
by meeting me, because I gave to all what Theo-
sophy teaches- that is, optimism and a quality
of courage which every man must have, if he ex-
pects to go through life with confidence and with
love for his fellow-men.
No mother should dare to bring children
into the world unless she has the spiritual courage
and the spiritual knowledge to guide them to
the light of Truth, and to the knowledge of Duty
in the highest sense, and to the love of the Divine
in the fullness of the heart.
It is the lack of knowledge that humanity
suffers from, not because it is evil; not because
humanity is low and degraded in its nature. It is
simply because it is unacquainted with itself, and
because the real spiritual man is not recognised
in the true sense that would enable the mortal
man to find his own way out of ignorance.
227
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
Think of all the time we spend in eating and
The Surd of drinking; and also in gaining the dollars and cents,
Happinu$ so as to do our duty by those we love; and then
think how little time we give to these ideas:
Who is man? Whence comes he? Whither goes
he? What is the meaning of life? Books are
read. Preachers preach, and teachers work; but
how much more could be taught and lived, if
life were met heartfully in spiritual trust!
Have you ever thought, when you listen to
beautiful music, how your natures change? How
your minds open to the beauty of life? How
full of cheer and hope and trust .you are?
The real secret of true living is finding inner
peace and happiness, and I do not believe one
human being can be found who can honestly say
before the Divine and before his conscience that
he has found true and complete happiness. Why?
Because the very unrest in man's nature is the
proof that he has not found it.
What more does Theosophy offer? The con-
viction that you can find it.
Theosophy is not far away. It does not re-
quire a great fortune to reach it. It does not
228 ,
THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS
require the persuasiveness of great orators. It
only requires that people shall go towards it and
meet it in confidence, and with the disposition to
trust in the self, to believe in the Higher Self,
and in conquering the lower selfand thus becoming
godlike. That is what we want!
So, if we can build our lives on a belief in
the eternal man, happiness can be found. And
there is no other way. Believe first in the essen-
tial divinity of man and the all-loving power of
the Divine- no punishment, no revenge, but
love and service and encouragement, and that
spirit of brotherly love that brings all men to-
gether, so there can be no wars, no differences
among men. Then in the course of time disease,
and many darkening, discouraging phases of life,
will disappear.
Why? Because in treading this Path of Light,
man will have found his happiness, he will have
found his peace, he will have found his inner
Divinity, and also he will have found himself!

THE SACREDNESS OF MARRIAGE
I
F this subject were rightly considered, we should
not have such a dismal story to tell of the
failures in married life - the disasters, the
mistakes, and the sorrow. In our modern life,
with all its reading and study and mental acquisi-
tions, humanity seems to have lost sight of the
fact that a real marriage is almost a divine in-
stitution.
When marriage is accepted as a sacred sanc-
tion, a sacred gift, and a sacred power, and it is
entered into understandingly by both man and
woman, we shall have no more divorces. There
are surely enough divorces today to compel us
to take another view of marriage.
For marriage there should be great prepara-
tion, just as there is for everything else of a
serious nature that is accomplished in life. This
preparation should begin in rightly forming the
character of the children. If children were rightly
educated, the sacredness of all life would creep
233
Real Mar-
riage a
Dioine
lmlitulion
Hi1/aer
EJucalion
for the
Youtla
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
almost imperceptibly into their hearts. We need
not talk to them of marriage, but we can give
them, even before they are ten years old, some
slight conception of why they are here, and what
is the meaning of life.
No man who has any respect for law and
order should have the audacity to assume a posi-
tion of responsibility, which he knows very little
about. It is the same with women. If this rule
were followed in marriage, we should have true
marriages and there would be no divorces.
But marriage is taken up so lightly nowadays,
that the disasters that follow its many failures
are pathetic; they bring heartache, sorrow, and
disappointment: and one never knows how far
the effects may reach of a marriage entered into
without a full consciousness of its sacredness.
Our duty compels us so to fashion our chil-
dren that before they are sixteen they can feel so
deeply and profoundly the seriousness of life, that
there is no room in their minds for them to absorb
the errors and weaknesses and the insinuations
and the innuendoes of false teachings and bad
examples. We must educate our children on such
234
HIGHER EDUCATION FOR THE YOUTH
a high key of morality, of honor, ·and of justice,
that they will have a firm anchorage in the great
vortex of human life.
How can you expect your boys and girls to
build their homes spiritually, and splendidly, and
royally and justly, if they have no foundation of
character on which to build?
Coupled with all the good intellectual train-
ing that we give to our children, we must give
them primarily the moral education. We must
teach them in their tender years, before they move
too far away from us, what it means to live, to
love, and to serve. We .must imbue them with
the idea of the greatness of human life, showing
them so plainly and so clearly, that they will
accept it, that life is precious, sacred, divine;
and that being divine, it is a part of eternity.
Boys and girls brought up in this way, with
their thoughts rooted in the spiritual realities,
will grow as the flowers grow, and by the time
they have reached. a point of decision, of selec-
tion of their life-companions, they will act slowly
and unqerstandingly, thoughtfully and wisely and
rightly. They will realize that human life, rightly
235
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
understood and rightly lived, is joy; and that
The joy of this joy to be lasting, must be built on high
Life anJ tire principles. Such children would become the
Fear of teachers of the race.
Puni$hment Our power of service to humanity, our real
joy, happiness, depend upon the education of the
spiritual side of man - especially of the child.
The children in the Raja-Yoga School at
Point Lorna begin in their tender years to find
themselves in their efforts, in their mistakes, in
their disappointments, without fear ofpunishment.
They begin to find that knowledge is within;
that the glory of God is within; that the divine
life is within; and, in the simplest possible way
they move towards it, just as they would towards
a flower in the garden.
Why can we not make the whole world sing
of the joy of living, the joy of loving, and above
all, the joy of serving? Why can we not live out
our highest aspirations?
Because we have been for ages psychologized
with the fear of punishment, and the fear of that
awful hell, wherein we were to be burning for all
eternity. We do not hear so much about it now
236
THE FEAR OF PUNISHMENT
as we did fifty years ago; but if it were true then,
it is true now. Fortunately for me, I did not
accept it even as a child.
There is no spirit of condemnation in saying
this; for there is a very great tolerance among
Theosophists for those who do not share our con-
ceptions. This is a great incentive for us to work
more and to feel our responsibilities more, and to
love more and to try to serve more. As long as
one human being is unhappy, I cannot conceive
that I could be completely happy.
The Theosophical teaching of Karma, that
'as ye sow, so must ye also reap,' does not con-
demn you to eternal punishment; it merely means
that you shall reap the consequences of your own
actions, until you have learned your lessons there-
from, until you have canceled your indebtedness.
Nor can we move away from the spirit of
forgiveness, because it comes right out of our
divine natures; it breathes the Christos-spirit;
it takes us away from our personality and our
selfishness, and we have no more time to think
of our wrongs.
We ourselves, rather, must become an example
237
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
to humanity which will ~hallenge all thinking
people to a deeper and more profound conception
of life. Remember that they themselves are es-
sentially divine. Splendid qualities are sleeping
within them.
No matter how great the worldly success
or the scholastic attainment, there must come
that inward consciousness of divinity, best ex-
pressed in the spirit of loving and forgiving.
When this is done, we shall know the meaning of
eternal Love, of eternal Justice, and of the sacred-
ness of marriage.
Man knows, if he thinks at all, that there
are many universes; many lives; and glorious
achievements for all men; and that life can, even
now, be made beautiful and helpful and opti-
mistic. But first he must have the basic idea
that the spiritual man is immortal, that, hence,
man is essentially divine in nature. Then we
shall have a new conception of Deity- not as a
personified being, but as a superb, wonderful,
full expression of divine perfection.
With this knowledge of essential divinity,
which every man can find within himself, there
238
THE MYSTERY OF BIRTH
must come a higher education for the youth.
Theosophists believe that the child that comes The Mys-
to us is not all ours; he is a part of the great tery of
scheme of life, and he has a great mission to per- Birth ·
form. It is not for us to attempt to limit the
possibilities of that child; for wisdom is to be
learned even from the lips of little children.
When a child comes to us, who can tell the
mystery of its birth? Science goes just so far,
but it does not take us into the spiritual realm;
it does not bring us to the realization that that
bit of humanity is essentially divine; that we
have a sacred responsibility in giving it its due.
You can educate it, love it, pet it, provide
for it, suffer for it, sacrifice yourself for it; but
·you fail in your duty to your child, until you can
give to it that which it expects from you. You
are the teachers.
Children are not put in your keeping just
for the short seventy-seven or a ·hundred years,
not just to be cared for on the physical plane.
Not at all. You must give them the realization
of their essential divinity which they are entitled
to. Maybe the child, within its own nature,
239
THE TRAVAJL OF THE SOUL
unable to speak or act, may teach its parents
something about the spiritual life.
We believe in the eternity of life, in the
universal law that guides us and cares for us, as
far as we permit it to do so, and of the ultimate
perfection of man: that is the great ideal we are
striving toward; that should be the impelling
force in the hearts of men today.
You have your money and lose it, you have
your property and lose it, but once you get that
divine force, ~hat divine consciousness that you
are a part of the great universal scheme of life,
you have found the treasures of the law. You
can suffer then understandingly; you may be
without a friend, without shelter. Never mind!
You have this treasure,- the consciousness of
your essential divinity.
That is what Theosophy is teaching, and
that is the keynote of man's life- to find his
divinity and realize his heritage; and then he
immediately understands his own responsibilities.
He does not have to be taught them. He knows
within himself his own responsibility to himself, to
his children, to his city, to his nation, and to the
240
THE MYSTERY OF BIRTH
world at large. This responsibility is ennobling.
With the consciousness of their own essential
divinity, mothers and fathers must necessarily
have a broader view of life, for if they have it
not, how can they give it to their children? So
that not only do we need a higher education for
the youth, but for men and women as well.
When we have a new conception of ourselves,
a new conception of the responsihilities of married
life, then something new happens; we become
optimistic instead of pessimistic. We have risen
above that limited idea ofone life; our vision opens
as we begin to see the greatness of the Divine and
the greatness of man, with his possibilities. Then
man is made anew, he is blessed in his own know-
ledge, in the reality of his consciousness that he
is essentially divine. It is something so sacred,
it is within the heart of every human being, and
every man has felt it.
So in order to do justice to our children,
there is a sacred duty for the parents, and that
is to know themselves: "Man, know thy.self!"
When you find yourself you then have the sec.
ret
to give to others who have it not. And here is
241
Life i1
Belluii/ul
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
where you should press into the atmosphere of
home-life something new, something right royal,
something that makes you forget your trials and
troubles.
The children come into your life right out
of the unknown world, the world of living reality.
They may know more than we do, and it is for
us, in bringing them into the exterior and every-
day world, to search within our own hearts, find
the key to the situation, and then awaken the
children to this reality.
Then our anxieties and our worries would
be lessened, because in the broader conception
we would be working in harmony with the Divine
Law; our whole natures. would be alive and
afire and aglow with that beautiful reality of
the divine life.
We Theosophists know that life is beautiful;
we do not run away from the miseries and troubles
of life, but we are endeavoring to plow through
them into the atmosphere of human thought,
and bring home to the mothers and fathers some-
thing that will save the next generation.
As soon as a child is able to raise its hand
242
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
in a ternper, or to scream, or to say " I will"
and "I won't," that is the time when mothers
and fathers should begin to teach the child to
know the duality of its own nature.
The only evidence you have of 'his Satanic
Majesty,' or of anything approaching it, you will
find within the heart of man. But these forces
can be transmuted, as the child is drawn to the
True and the Beautiful.
We do not believe a mother will ever have
success with her children as long as she loses her
temper in trying to manage her child. She then
goes down to the level of the child, and some-
times drags it lower down than it already is.
So in dealing with our children, we must
be clean and strong, and pure, and true, and firm
in our convictions; so that when those children
look into our eyes we are not ashamed. Besides
giving them the worldly things and ministering
to their needs, we must give them one-half of
our time, one-half of our nature, one-half of every-
thing that is blessed and true.
So, in your love of the True and the Beauti-
ful, you will find the great secret of living in
243
TilE TllAVAIL OF THE iOUL
such a way that life will be a joy, and the children
of this coming time will receive blessings through
you; so that you will make ofyour own home-life a
heaven on earth for those who depend upon you.

AGAINST CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
I
HAVE chosen for the subject of my talk today,
'The Death-Penalty.' But before ·touching The Theo-
directly on that subject, I would like to state $ophical
for the benefit of those present who possibly have Conception
never been here before, how Theosophy looks of Death
upon death; and also how it looks upon the cor-
rection of evil. Our books are teeming with most
interesting facts regarding death from the TheO-
sophical standpoint, which carries with it a very
cheerful aspect.
To you it may be only the declaration of a
possibility, while of course to me it is an assur-
ance, that man lives again and again on this
earth; that he has repeated opportunities of ad-
vancing spiritually. This conception gives one a
larger view of life.
Theosophy teaches that man, being divine
in essence, is immortal- that he lives on and on.
This doctrine is wonderfully beautiful and is com-
mon sense. It is ·quite impossible for one who
247
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
thinks deeply on the subject to settle down and
be satisfied with one short life. Those who have
the highest aspirations, the grandest hopes, and
the largest plans, never can fulfil them in one
lifetime.
If humanity is, as we believe ourselves to be,
the highest expression of creative life on the earth-
plane, what limitations are put upon man by the
idea of just one existence! What an insult is
such a conception to his spiritual dignity! To
confine him to one life on earth for the realization
of all his aspirations, his hopes, his yearnings,
and the splendor of his inner character, which
may not be known at all in the outer sense!
Man cannot find the justice of life, if he is con-
fined to one existence on earth.
So Theosophy presents the sacred doctrine
of Reincarnation. It is built upon a larger and
more optimistic view of life than the western
world is accustomed to. It teaches that man is
essentially divine, and therefore sacred; that while
the body is mortal, living on this earth and then
dying, the spiritual soul is immortal- it does not
die. With this conception, man expects more
248
THE THEOSOPHICAL CONCEPTION OF DEATH
of the Higher Majestic Laws of Being, which
govern our lives.
With this new view of existence, the man
or woman who is nearing the time when he or
she is about to be separated from this earth for
a time, is to be envied. Why? Because the
body, the physical garment, is worn out and is
to be thrown aside. It is of the earth, earthy;
while the spiritual soul is a part of the Divine
Life, which we cannot control, but which we may
understand to a degree, if we will, and which
cares for us.
You must all admit that there is some re-
markable and wonderful Law caring for all hu-
manity; for with the present chaotic condition
of civilization, etc., where would we be without
it? But so few of us look at it in that broader
sense.
I cannot conceive how anybody can be timid
or fearful or regretful about coming back to earth
again. Of course, I have met some really splendid
people, well educated in a way, who rebel against
the idea of Reincarnation, because they imagine
that they will come back to the same old locality
249
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
as before, and have the same old aches and trials
Another and disappointments, and have no larger vision
Chance than before. But such a conception is absurd.
We have no right to say what the world will have
in store for us; but of this we may be sure: it
will give us our due; because nothing in the great
universal economy is lost; nothing can be lost.
So that which the immortal man fails to
achieve in this life, he has the opportunity of
reaching in another existence. We always have
another chance. There is great significance in those
two words, ANoTHER CHANCE, when applied to
one's own life, and more particularly when ap-
plied to some poor unfortunate fellow about to
be hanged. The idea of another chance, con-
sidered from a Theosophical standpoint, is of
.
great rmportance.
In my experience with prisoners, extending
over thirty years, mostly in this country but also
in Europe, I have found that the assurance of
'another chance,'- given to a prisoner with a
friendly smile of sympathy, that will prove one
is not working in jail from curiosity or for queS-
tioning, but rather to do something helpful,- will
250
ANOTHER CHANCE
do more for that prisoner than all the preaching
in the world. I have found it so.
I have saved many a man and many a girl
from despair and from the wrong path, just with
the little knowledge I have of Theosophy, which
is so very limited.. (In fact, all our knowledge is
very limited, in comparison with what it will
be in further experiences.)
But I have found great efficacy in this mes-
sage of Another Chance given to the unfortunate.
One must give him time to think it out. Then
comes the questioning: "What does it mean?"
And then the book of revelations of Theosophy
is open, if the one who gives that message, does
it intelligently. It gives hope; it gives under-
standing; it gives a definition of life; it gives to
the man who has committed a crime a clear ex-
planation of the fact that he possesses a higher
and a lower nature.
I suppose that all of you, in your moods,
or notions, or whims, or experiences, must have
sometimes found in your own lives many things
that you were not overproud of. Perhaps many
thoughts only, or perhaps some acts, that were
251
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
not creditable. But when you thought more
Mercy anJ deeply, the better things would come to you-
BrotherltooJ your higher natures would assume command
.
agatn.
So in considering the unfortunates, who have
drifted off the Path, let us remember that we too
might have drifted- and might be drifting now-
as they did, if we had had no better opportunities
than they. We cannot know what the prenatal
or hereditary conditions were in these I speak of.
We know very little about their parents. We do
not know what the fathers and mothers taught
them, or failed to teach them.
So the man who is about to be hanged -
what has he had to depend on? Can you not see
that somewhere along the road he has lost faith;
probably first in himself, then in his neighbors,
then in humanity, and finally in the Divine?
And then he commits some offense which brings
him within the reach of the law and he must
be punished. And if his offense has been murder,
the only way men know how to punish him is
to kill him!
This we Theosophists will not have! We
252
MERCY AND BROTHERHOOD
won't listen to it without protest! We won't
tolerate it! It is barbarity; it is murder legalized
by man-made laws, which are against the Divine
Laws! It is an outrage to all the finer and better
qualities of human nature, no matter how low the
offender had fallen. We do not know what the
causes were that led him astray.
This does not mean that we should extend
our mercy so far that we will excuse him, or
place him in a position where he can repeat his
crime. Not at all! But we should all recognise
that that man, being a part of the Divine Scheme
of Life, just as we all are, possesses at least a
spark of the Divine in him. There is something
sacred in him, in spite of his degradation and sin,
and the horror of his offense.
We cannot recall to life the one he may have
slain, but we can at least open the way for the
offender to find his own soul, so that he may re-
cover himself, so to speak, 8efore he is launched
out into another life.
All that it requires is the spirit of mercy, of
true brotherhood. And no matter how much we
rnay differ, or how many horrible and dreadful

THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
things we may see in the records of those who have
erred, we must cultivate the spirit that Jesus
taught. Surely there is no one here who could
turn away from the sacred teachings of the
Nazarene.
If there were no other reasons for abolishing
the death-penalty, we ought to remember his
words; first: "That ye love one another"; and
second: 'Thou shalt not kill.'
In considering this question of the death-
penalty, one has to meet not only the law of the
land, but the men who administer that law. It
is not possible for us to think for a moment that
any judge would wish to impose a sentence of
death on a fellow-man.
I have no question that many people think
that every governor who refuses to raise his hand
or his voice, to give a man who is condemned to
death another chance, does so from choice. Of
course he has the power to do it or to refuse to
do it, and the legal right to do it or to refuse
to do it. And if he refuses a pardon because he
has had so much ingrained in his mind the prin-
ciple of "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
254
"AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH"
tooth,'' we are at an extremely dangerous point,
where we can label such conduct as 'man's in-
humanity to man.'
For did not the Teacher declare that we
must "love one another"? Those simple words
need no amplification.
And yet, during the war, there were so-called
Christian preachers leaning over the pulpits and
preaching to their people that God was admonish-
ing them to show that quality of devotion to
America that would annihilate the enemy! I call
that fiendish barbarism!
The only way you can reach the point of
seeing it as I do, is for it to strike your own son,
or your own children! If it touches your own
hearts, that is when it sets you to thinking!
Then you can move into a proper atmosphere
for realizing the awful injustice that is done by
war, and also the awful injustice that is done
by capital punishment!
How does our life come to us? Does it not
come out of the Eternity of spiritual things- out
of the majesty of the Higher Law? It comes to us
with a power that we can neither explain nor con-
255
THE TR.AVAIL OF THE SOUL
trol, according to that Divine Law. And so life
should go, when the body is tired and worn out,
when the physical has done its part. Then the spi-
ritual soul seeks the liberty that it should have.
But to launch a life out of existence by the
hand of man, is an interference with this Divine
Law. It is the result of man's inhumanity to
man. It is a part of the insanity of the age. It
is the lack of brotherhood. It is fiendish and it
is barbaric!
No matter how bad the man we speak of
has been, we have no right to take his life. How
much more liberal, how much more in accordance
with the teachings of Jesus Christ, how much
more grand and godlike it is, to show mercy!
Can you not conceive how one who has been
condemned, hates humanity? He hates every-
thing that has crossed his life, because he has
been deprived of some of the essential things he
should have had; and because we have had them,
we stand and pass judgment on him; whereas if
he had had the same chances that we have had,
perhaps he would never have been where he is.
It requires not only deep reasoning to reach
256
cc BORN IN SIN"
the depths of the subject I am discussing, but
it requires heart-thought. ..Born in
One cannot think along these lines very long Sin"
and let one's heart warm towards the subject,
without reaching one's higher nature, the spiritual
part of oneself, that really demands that nobler
justice may be done.
But it is not for us to condemn even him who
condemns the unfortunate to death; because he
does not know any better. For he has been taught
the doctrine of centuries in the Occident that we
are "born in sin," that there is a damnation, a
curse on us, from the time we breathe, as little
innocent children! Oh how pained I am to think
that anyone will talk of the 'all-loving God,'
the All-Powerful, Omnipresent One, who is ever
guiding our lives, and then imagine that It could
make such a law for Its children!
Of course, Theosophists do not accept that
dogma- that "man is born in sin." But the
Theosophist accepts the teaching that he has lived
before; that he is imperfect.; and that as he
lives, so he receives in return; that if he has
lost opportunities, understancling them and know-
257

THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
ing them, he must make them up. There is com-
pensation everywhere. Eternal Justice will not
permit any overdoing on one side or the other.
I do not know how many read the criminal
statistics and how many realize, in our great
'civilization' of today, what monstrous and almost
unbelievable reports we have of crime and of the
so-called 'correction' of crime. Our newspapers
are teeming with them. It is pitiful that the
newspapers print the stuff, as was so clearly
pointed out by 'Craig Kennedy' in a recent issue
of The San Diego Union. It is poisonous in its
psychological influence on the young- indeed,
on all minds; and this evil is constantly increasing.
We have new forms of crime, more fiendish,
worse than ever before, showing man often as
seemingly only a brute. But the worse he is,
the more he has my pity; because I always ask
myself: What brought him to that condition?
What were the influences that fashioned his life?
What knowledge did his parents give him- in
fact, what knowledge did they have to give him?
Within the last few days we have been read-
ing of several very young men who were put out
258
POISONOUS PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PRESS
of physical existence by the noose. That was to
'square the account'! ''An eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth!" The situation has become
something monstrously dangerous and terrible!
Have you ever stopped to think of the psy-
chological influence of the public reports of these
crimes and hangings? A young boy or girl, pos-
sibly with good, loving parents, sits down and
reads of the crime of legal murder, of the legal
destroying of human life by the state. They
notice that papa and mama take their break-
fast just the same, read the paper and show no
distress at all; and so they too read the papers
and become callous.
After a while something happens to them;
because, let me tell you, the soul of man must
have the best in its environment; it must have
the light of Truth and the consciousness of its
own essential divinity, that it may stand and
live and become. We cannot give our children
this soul-freedom, if we allow them to be brought
up under the psychology of the appalling spiritual
ignorance of the age.
True, we have great institutions; we have
259
Man's
&uniial
Dioinity
Prood
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
high schemes of education; science is making
great strides on many lines; but show me the
evidence that men are growing better, that families
are becoming more united; that the youth are
maintaining their virtue and fulfilling the promises
of babyhood and childhood! You cannot find
such evidence. It is nowhere to be found! A
good man - noble, courageous, and true - is a
rarity nowadays.
But, on the other hand, that the race is still
stancling on its feet at all, not dismayed, not hor-
rified, not completely thrown down and rushed
into the insanity of the age, is proof enough for
me of the essential divinity of human nature.
This innate divinity will continue to sustain
you, if you will turn towards it and permit it
to do so. Of course, if you turn away from the
sun, you might say that it did not exist; and so,
if you turn away from your own essential divinity,
it does not exist in your consciousness.
This morning, when I looked out over the
great blue Pacific, and saw the beauties of Na-
ture, felt its touch of kindness and quiet, and
breathed the sweet wonderful air here, of Loma-
260
MAN's ESSENTIAL DIVINITY PROVED
land, everything seemed to be telling me of the
finer things of life.
Then I thought of the youth of the present
time, and of their shadowy future. What example
do we give to the youth today? What do we give
them that is so vivifying, so engaging, so con-
vincing, and so powerful, that it lifts them above
the psychology of the age?
Physical and mental ability are not enough.
There must be something behind these; and that
something is the spiritual soul of man, that must
speak. It is the soul of our reformers, the soul
of our teache~s, the soul of the parents, that must
save the situation that confronts us today.
No matter how many laws are made, no
matter how many systems are introduced, no
matter how many sermons are preached or ar-
ticles written, our boys and girls and young men
and women are 'going to the dogs' as never be-
fore in the history of modern times.
You, who have had some experience, com-
pare the youth of the present time with the youth
of even forty or fifty years ago. And that was by
no means the best type! Even then there was
261
Abo/i$h the

THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
pitiful ignorance; there was the psychology of
centuries of false teaching; and though you might
not admit it, there was on your minds the blearing
and marring influence of the dogma that you
were 'born in sin.'
I wonder if you have ever stopped to think
what a reflexion such a dogma is on the Divine
Life- that It had created us and then damned us!
In taking up this study of the death-penalty,
my object is first to remind you that those who
are sent to prison, and those who are hanged, were
children once- mother's children- and not so
very long ago, either!
But they drifted. And let me talk plainly, we
have let them drift. I say this not in the spirit
of blame for anyone; but the fact is, we have
let them drift away from their moorings, from
their soul-Opportunities, from the sacredness of
the home, and from the sacredness of the Divine
Laws that find expression in our very blood.
Yes, we have let them drift, and they continue
to drift.
A few years ago we read occasionally about
a murder or a hanging. Now our papers are
262
ABOLISH THE DEATH-PENALTY
full of them, sometimes two or three in one day,
in one State. The picture is black and dis-
0
couragtng.
Splendid men in some of our States have
worked until they have succeeded in abolishing
the death-penalty; and their reports show that
there is no more crime in their States than in
others, where this relic of barbarism still persists.
If we are to do away with capital punishment
in our own State, we must throw all our forces,
our minds, our hearts, our energy, and our speech,
against it.
Many a young boy has never known of crime
and has no intention of doing any evil, yet does
not know the difference between his impulses and
his intuitions; and under the influence of bad
company or of strong temptation, he makes his
first mistake. What happened?
Oh if the parents, just in this part of the
conntry, could see conditions as I see them! And
yet they cannot see them, and they could not
bear them, anyway!
What is it that makes the boy go wrong? It is
the unspiritual and deadening influence of the psy-
263
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
chology of the age, that is sweeping all over
Inadequate the world.
Education Many of our systems of education are good
as far as they go; but they are too negative.
They have no spiritual basis to work on. They
do not understand the laws that govern man's
life. And no father can tell his son or his daughter
anything about those laws, if he has never been
taught them himself; even though he may have
had a superb education, hold a prominent position
in life, and he good in heart, and desire the best
for his children. But he cannot grasp those laws
if he knows nothing about them.
Let him then turn to the teachings of TheO-
sophy- not the false teachings and impositions
ofpseudo-theosophists with their so-called 'coming
Christ,' and all that; nothing of that kind here!
Then he will realize that there is no possibility
of a change for the better until man finds himself.
"Man, know thyself!" He must take a new pride
in himself and his own spiritual dignity.
Let him say to himself: " I rnay not fully
believe it yet, but I will see how I feel for a few
days, trying to believe that I am divine in essence,
264
THEOSOPHY THE KEY
that I have the power of self-eontrol, and can
gain many victories over myself even in one life. Theosophy
I have no time to think about old age and loss the Key
of money or anything else."
I have always said that men have a harder
time than women. They must of course give a
large portion of their time to the bread-and-butter
question. But when they see that they are yet
'out-of-doors' so to speak, still under the sweeping
influence of the world's psychology, that crime is
increasing, that the children are 'going to the
dogs' fast, and that human life is threatened, they
must look for a panacea.
I tell you that Theosophy is the panacea.
It won't make the world over at once. But it
lifts some of the burdens, and it gives you the keys
to solve the vexing perplexities of your own lives.
True, the Theosophical books are man-made;
but they are based on the Eternal Laws. And
their teachings are very ancient. They were under-
stood and lived long ages preceding the time of
Jesus Christ, when people lived according to the
spiritual laws, simply and sanely. Then their
imaginations aided in their spiritual development.
265
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
They had a higher quality of discretion than even
the most educated minds have nowadays,- a
quality of the soul.
A man may do just as nearly right as he can,
the best he knows; but if he knows that within
the depths of his own soul there is vast knowledge
for him, if he thinks again and again of the possi-
bility of realizing his essential divinity; before
you know it, he has imbibed some of that undying,
eternal, ever-breathing force that is right at hand,
if he will only reach it. And when he reaches it,
it brings him to a place of surety, from which
he can work.
A question was put to me two or three years
ago in Berlin by a great scientist, who had looked
much into Theosophy and was very deeply in-
terested in it. He said he had a question that I
could not answer, which was in substance as
follows: ''If, as you say, all are God's children
and under His protective power, how is it that
we have these awful catastrophes, disasters,
floods, and so forth, where so many lives are lost?"
"Well," I said, "that is very easily answered.
In the olden days, those people who had the
266
MAN CANNOT TWIST THE IMMUTABLE LAWS
larger knowledge of these inner teachings, did not
make the mistakes that we make. When a man Man cannot
selected the place where he was going to live, Twi$t the
never was such a thing heard of as his depend- Immutahle
ing on his brain merely, in order to decide where Law$
he would go or not.
"So, today, if he has had Theosophy, and
applied it to his life, he will know more or less
clearly where he should go. No matter how
great the inducement of money and opportunity,
he would not go to an unsafe place; and if he
believes in his essential divinity and does justice to
his inner life, he will have this consciousness that
I speak of, that will warn him where not to go."
This is not far-fetched at all. It is right with-
in your grasp. You can know what will come to
pass. If these people that we speak of had had
their intuition awakened, they would not have
gone to those places. And when the catastrophe
happens, are we going to 'blame God' for it?
Why not accept the fact that the Divine
Laws are immutable; and that it is for us to ac-
cept them and apply them; but that we cannot
twist them to our intentions? We must meet
267
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
them half-way; and if we meet them half-way,
Bwuti/ul we get a response in our natures, in our souls;
lkatla! we get an explanation of many things that other-
.
wtse we cannot answer.
One of the most beautiful subjects to con-
sider, for one who is seeking a knowledge of Theo-
sophy, is the explanation of death; for the TheO-
sophical explanation is true. You know it in
your soul, when once you grasp it, that death
means life, liberation, advancement, progress, and
another chance!
We do not know all the definiteness of these
laws, any more than a mother knows about her
little prenatal baby. Do you suppose that she
could tell you anything about the mystery of
the processes that govern the development of
that body in the body? No! She could not do it.
One must keep thinking and thinking! One
of the great secrets of the ancients is: Think,
and think, and then think again, and then hesi-
tate to speak or decide; and then think still
again; and if your mind is receptive, if you are
ready for the Truth, if you are seeking it, Light
will then be yours, and you will progress surely.

CHRISTMASTIDE AND THE SPIRIT
OF LOMALAND
M
y prayer is that all that is beautiful and
true and ennobling in Christmastide may The Awa~en..
be ever preserved; for before many years, ing of the
we may awaken to an understanding of the fact ChriJloJ-
that we have greater duties than we know; and Spirit
that the real Christmas-time means the awaken- in Man
ing of the Christos-spirit in man- the awakening
of that inner, quickening, potential Force, which
you all have- the spiritual soul.
The world will sooner or later accept the
doctrine of Reincarnation- indeed, it is fast ac-
cepting it already. Why, I could not live, I
could have no faith in the Divine Laws that
framed the universe, that brought the wonders
of the world to us, that have given us the mys-
teries of mysteries which we have no power to
explain; I would not want to live; there would
be no hope, if it were not for this eternal hope
which Theos.ophists have in the inspiring thought
271
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
of the absolute justice of that Infinite Power
which ultimately restores universal harmony.
I am not one who believes in dwelling on
the sadness and sorrow of life; for I know the
great joy of life could be ours, now and at all
times, if we would only find it within our own
souls. I believe that justice will ultimately come
into the world; but I also know that unless I do
my fullest duty I am miserable.
And so for the true Theosophist, working
perhaps in the same way as I do, there is happi-
ness in spite of the misery; for the reason that
we are trying to do the best we can. We have
no disposition to remind humanity of its weak-
nesses. The weaknesses tell their own story and
bring their own miseries. Most of the weaknesses
in human nature are due to ignorance.
We have no time for condemnation. Our
time is spent in constructive wor", in building
human life anew with a royal .and eternal hope.
· When we look at the beauties of Nature and
the spirit of Justice that breathes in our own
hearts and in everything that is good, it is not
difficult to have a quickening hope, to close the
272
THE AWAKENING OF THE CHRISTOS-SPIRIT
doors on the past, on the shadows and the·suffer-
ing, and to awaken in the new time.
And perhaps Christmas-time is the best of
all times in which to awaken and feel this divine
tou.ch that is in the heart of every man, if only he
will recognise and understand it.
Then every day and every hour would be
so sacred that we could not spare any time in
destroying our neighbors or in doing anything
but constructing, trying to build up the new hope
and the new life and the old but ever new love-
the great im·personal love that certainly is in the
hearts of men, however much we may be sleeping
when it calls.
Those who are familiar with RaJa-Yoga know
that we always aim to instruct. There is always
something more than mere entertainment in a
festival, and tonight, with these little children,
seeing the delight and joy they feel in taking part,
has be·en a schooling in itself.
Christmas is a time when we should try to
forget our sorrows, disappointments and heart-
aches~ and move out into ·the broad new world
where everything means love, where everything
273
SJj.-Forget-
/ulneu
lwing1 Jog
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
is touched with the glory of love, where love rules
the mind, the heart, the soul, where love is the
guiding power not only for little children but for
their elders.
And the Theosophist of course, at times like
this, carries his mind forward in a great advance,
for the reason that he does not hesitate to say
to those who care to hear that he has an abiding
belief in Reincarnation.
We have so much more to live for- to suffer
for if necessary- because we realize that this
one life is but a classroom in the great School
of Experience that includes many lives; and that
Justice rules the world. Humans fail, but Jus-
tice prevails in the course of time, and the know-
ledge of this brings to us a closer realization of
what life means, what love means.
Thus to a Theosophist life is sacred. There
is no time to waste. We must be up and doing,
day by day, year by year, for we realize what
life means.
To serve rightly one must forget oneself in
the service. The true joy of life is realized only
when self-forgetfulness rules, and life is joy when
274
SELF-F~R.GETFULNESS BRINGS JOY
we meet it honestly and conscientiously. But to
find this joy there must be in the heart a superb
trust. That once born, when we come to the end
of life, we find that we have really reached the
youth of life.
I was very much overcome on Christmas
Eve, when I saw all my Raja-Yoga boys and girls
and the little children, in their international fes-
tival. I remembered how I first started the Raja-
Yoga School twenty-six years ago with five pupils.
I saw my upright, manly boys and my splendidly
womanly girls and the promising little folk. And
I thought: Oh if the whole world could only
have this great secret of Theosophy, that man is
divine in essence!
We haven't time to criticize. If we must
criticize, let us turn the criticism on ourselves!
The Higher Law will take care of us if we will
only meet it half-way. That is why we are teach-
ing these little children, not only at Christmas
but on every day throughout the year, that life
is character, that life is service, and that life
• •
IS JOy.
I am sure that if you had your choice of a
27S
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
place in which to come into touch with ·the spirit
The of beauty and peace, you could find nothing more
Spirit of lovely than this wonderland of ours.
LomalanJ We have been working for more than twenty-
five years now to keep this International TheosO-
phical Center a living proof of the real spiritual
life among our students - quite unpretentious;
but the history of the last quarter-century will
show that our workers have been very much in
earnest; they are in full sympathy with the heart-
ache of the world; they are not looking for special
favors or privileges for themselves; but they are
t_rying to live the Theosophical life- the real,
pure,-true life, ·in such a way that their example
may arouse others to a larger hope.
I do not look upon humanity with despair;
because I have an undying faith in it. I have
great· love of human life and great love of the
Eternal Life- the life wherein the spiritual soul
can find its place.-
Real life is beautiful; and the only reason
that the world's life as we see it i~ not always
beautiful, is because man himself makes it other-
wise. If we feel that we get a very small share
276
OPTIMISM, THE SECRET OF SUCCESS
of the beauty of life, it is because we have been
evading the issues in our own lives for so long-
perhaps through many lives.
We shut ourselves out from all that is godlike
and wonderful and beautiful by the hard grind
of every-day life- by the insincerity of human
life and by the insanity of the age- unbrother-
liness.
In some way we have to move out of this
difficulty; and I advise you that Theosophy is
the shortest way out; and it is also the way .that
will give you a contentment and a satisfaction
that nothing else will. You may lose your friends,
your wealth- you may not even have a shelter
to cover you; but if you have true Theosophy in
your lives, you will live in a consciousness that
'As you sow, so you must also reap,' and that
what you have earned in the spiritual sense is
yours forever.
Optimism is one of the secrets of our Theo-
sophical teaching. It is certainly the secret of
whatever success I have been able to achieve
in life. I will not bend to the shadows and the
clouds of despair. I throw my whole being out
277
Optimism.
the Secret
of Success
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
into a world of thought where there are no limi-
tations. Nothing is lost in Divine economy. I
suppose I shall go on talking for all eternity about
these things; but each time I speak, I aim to
strike a responsive note in the hearts of my
listeners; and to make my message so simple and
so acceptable, that they cannot go away from it.
We can find our God right at our door, if
we will, in our gardens, in the trees, in the flowers,
in the sky, with the children, and above all, we
find our God in our own hearts.
The little I know, has made me so happy
that I want to give a part of my joy to every
human soul in the world. I hope to have the
physical strength to keep on giving it and giving it;
I am in no hurry to die, because I desire to do
my part in this world, with my limited know-
ledge and experience, to lift humanity's burdens.
Why are so many prematurely growing old
and .gray and tired and discouraged? Because
they entertain so many non-essentials in their
lives. They are slaves to the psychology of the old
dogma that we were born in sin, and are the help-
less creatures of a punishing, revengeful God.
278
OPTIMISM, THE SECRET OF SUCCESS
I say this with no reflexion on the many
dear, splendid people in the churches. I am very
fond of them, because I have just enough wisdom
to love them as part of 'God's great family.'
In this great sweeping ocean of the world's ac-
tivities, we belong to each other and we must
serve one another; and when we realize this
fact, we shall have no time to condemn.
We must work with the Divine Law in order
to bring ourselves into harmony with it and into
consonance with all the exquisite and beautiful
aspirations of our hearts. In this way our con-
ception of life becomes so enlarged that we ask
impatiently for another day and another day, that
we may expand and grow and love and become.
Man's real education begins in his spiritual
aspirations. We are either growing, standing
still, or going backwards. If we have the light of
aspiration burning in our hearts, if we are pos-
sessed of a divine Trust, if we love all humanity
with an abiding affection, then we can be sure
that we are on the right Path.
It always alarms me to see people who are
satisfied with themselves. I can never be satis-
279
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
fied- neither with myself, with you, with the
world, nor with conditions in general; because
so many non-essentials in life ·are holding hu-
manity back.
People sometimes dislike me because I am
intent on letting them know how great they really
are, how powerful in their soul-life, how godlike
they can become, and how near they are to great
truths. Whatever power of serving humanity I
have, has come to me through suffering; aRd
when you can find a religion that will explain to
you the meaning of suffering and you can cheer-
fully accept it, then you may know that you are
on the top of the mountain for this life.
Do not fret or worry! Take your first duty
today and make it the most sacred thing in your
life. Then .take the next one, and no matter how
hard it is, make it sacred too; and so on with
the others. Then the eternal soul within you -
that part of you which is a part of Divinity, a
divine ray, so to speak- will open the way, and
take you to your own. But you must work for it.
If you turn your face away from the sun, you
cannot see the light. So is it in the spiritual world.

THE CHALLENGE OF THE HOUR
TJIE men and women of the present time are
1 being challenged by the condition of the Sympathy
world. Crime, disease, vice, and insanity are /or tlae
increasing rapidly, and the greatest remedial Worlti'J
efforts that have been made have not brought us SorrowJ
to a state of security.
You all wish conditions could be better. But
the challenging question is: ccHow much are you
doing to change them?" Can you be satisfied
with present conditions? Can you be satisfied
to bring up children in the shadow of the world's
present condition, and not enlighten them as to
their possibilities?
The Light will not all come in a flash. Each
one of you must seek the Truth and find the
way for himself. You must find strength; you
must find your spiritual individuality, if one may_
call it such; you must strengthen your minds
with a purpose so true, so high, and so constant
that you cannot move away from it. It will stay

lenge to tlae When you get this, then you will commence
Parmls to climb. You cannot measure your steps, but
you will find that something is happening to you.
You will have more sympathy for the sin and
sorrow of the world than you ever had before.
You will find that you have more spiritual strength
than you ever had before, and you can meet
your trials and your difficulties much more
courageously. Why? Because you are slowly
delving into the depths of your nature and finding
there those godlike attributes which every man
possesses.
Even the humblest, the most ignorant, the
most forgotten, the most mistaken- all have ~s
royal privilege, under the sun of the eternal
teachings of Theosophy.
The question is: Are all the mothers and
fathers perfectly satisfied about their children?
I know better. Are they perfectly satisfied with
themselves? I know better.
The very fact that they are dissatisfied, shows
that there is still 'unfinished business' in their
284
THE CHALLENGE TO THE PARENTS
natures. · The great Heart of the Universe opens
its doors for those who earnestly seek the Light
-without price. But they must find the warmth
of the eternal love of the Divine in their hearts,
that we know exists. The mother knows what
it is. Oh how much our mothers know of that
love, and how beautiful it is! And if they have it
for their children, what must it not be in the
great Heart of the Universe- Deity?
You mothers know in your hearts that the
children you have borne have something divine,
sweet, and splendid in them, and you try to keep
it and to protect it. But you cannot keep it;
you cannot make it grow; you cannot make it a
livjng power in their lives, unless you have faith
in yourselves and in that thing which you most
love in your children - the divine soul.
Theosophy opens up Nature to you in a
new way. When it has once touched your lives,
you will look into the blue of heaven as you
never·did before; the songs of the birds will have
new music for your hearts and the evening breezes
will tal~ to you like the souls of your loved ones.
When you feel the mightiness of the real,
285
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
inner life and are growing in the richness of it,
then you begin to know the fullness and the
grandeur of the love of the Divine. But remember,
you have your own life to fashion, and you go
only just so far as you permit yourselves to go.
We know the Infinite Laws exist, because we
feel the touch of them in our hearts at times.
When we can build our natures, our characters,
our souls, and our love for humanity on the great
broad platform of these Universal Laws, in the
atmosphere of continuous growth, evolution, of
the exchange of the spirit of brother!y love and
patience towards one another, then how different
will life be to us!
Study Theosophy, and ere long many of your
heartaches and your sorrows and your disappoint-
ments, which you have never understood before,
will be explained to you, and you will find there
is justice in them, all along the line.
This is the time of challenge to the real in-
side thinker, the loving mother and the conscien-
tious father. We must awaken and find the key
that will bring to every home and to every human
heart that spiritual quality that so many seek.
286
THE CHALLENGE OF OUR JOYS AND SORROWS
You cannot think for even two minutes of
your beloved mother, without your whole na- The Cltal-
ture softening. Why? Because there is that /enge of our
natural bond of love between mother and child, joy1 and
that still is yours, and still holds you in love and So"ow1
worship. It is the eternal love of the Divine
in the mother, and it is in every human being,
down to the lowest type, even those who have
sinned and whom we condemn. No matter!
Underneath the enfoldment of all the miseries
of life, there is the power of Love.
Why should I not be enthusiastic? Why
should I not have belief in humanity? Why
should I not have the spirit to forgive even my
worst enemy? What I know, I know; and it is
not the result of thinking nor of study; it is an
overwhelming sense of the greatness of life, and
of the joy of life, and of the peace there is at
hand for all.
Some ofyou dear people are tired. I am tired,
too. But I never give up; and my whole soul
at this Christmastide is turned to the idea that
this is the time of challenge. All nature is chal-
lenging us. Those who have passed on are chal-
287
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
lenging us. Those who have failed and some who
have not failed utterly, but have made mistakes,
also are challenging us.
All the miseries and heartaches of the past
can go out of our lives, if we can begin to make
new records, by bringing our souls into a higher
state of consciousness.
We live so much in our bodies and so bind
ourselves to our physical needs, that we forget
our souls and our eternal future, and so we are
only half living.
There is a challenge to every human being
to use present opportunities, which will never
come again. We must color our lives with a new
hope, with a beautiful picture of the future, with
confidence in ourselves. We must begin life anew.
There will be no sounding of bells or cries from the
house-tops- only that wonderful inner touch of
the sublime in man, that opens the doors of the
mind, so that the spiritual sun can shine in and
enlighten and warm our lives.
Then that beautiful, inner, eternal part of
ourselves, which ·has so little recognition in the
workaday world, will bloom and blossom like the
288
THE CHALLENGE TO SELF-EXAMINATION
flowers, and we shall find that after all, life is joy.
We shall learn that much of what we call suffering The Chat-
means growth, if we are only big enough to rise lenge to
above it. And we shall realize that the other part, Self-
somewhere along the line, possibly without inten- Examination
tion, we ourselves have caused, and that we are
but reaping what we have sown.
Theosophy, with its great doctrine of Rein-
carnation,, is great enough for the broad mind.
It enables him to open the next page of life, to
lift the veil. It shows him the wonder of the uni-
verse- not only of one universe, but of thou-
sands of universes, millions of stars and suns and
planets, all in their ordered places! And we are
shut in, in a little town, or a little State, or a
little country! It is too small for us! There is
something more! Try and find it!
This New Year is, on the one hand, a time of
chaos, confusion, unrest, misery, and suffering;
and yet w~e might also say on the other hand, that
it is a time of glorious possihilities.
Ifwe could stretch our imaginations, we might
open up for ourselves a wonderful vista; for the
reason that humanity, and each individual member
289
THE TRAVAIL OF THE SOUL
thereof, holds within himself treasures of untold
blessings- treasures of truth, of enlightenment,
of godlike and god-given things that we are all
asking for.
The very fact that we are dissatisfied reminds
us that things are all awry in ourselves. We
have not to .go to New York or Boston or to
Europe or anywhere at all in order to find out
what is the matter with human nature. All we
have to do is just to look at ourselves. We must
come down to basic facts and look at life as it is.
Nature in all its glory is singing to us every
day its wonderful song of peace and beauty and
enlightenment; but we hear it only a little, just
occasionally; because we are so held in with our
mental attitudes, our states of mind, our limited
knowledge.
One must go a long way before finding many
who will tell one of their absolute belief in some-
thing more than the one earth-life. And with
this limited conception of only one earth-life, I do
not see how we can have a vista of possibilities
that are encouraging; I do not see how we can
have much to offer our children; I do not see how
290
THE CHALLENGE TO SELF-EXAMINATION
we can dare to live beyond a day; because every-
. thing on the outer plane, as far as we have gone,
is incomplete.
It is impossible for so much misery to exist
in the world, without our taking part in it. We
may not commit as great wrongs as some do;
we may not suffer poverty and hunger and other
misfortunes; but we do feel deeply, when we are
true to ourselves, the suffering of humanity.
H. P. Blavatsky gathered up the teachings
of Theosophy, as she found them, and brought
them to suffering humanity, hoping to do her part
to lessen the world's misery; and she certainly
did it most grandly. She never claimed that she
originated the teachings, which are as old as the
ages, and were not invented by anyone. But she
lifted the veil for us, and made a vista so broad
and high and eternal, that following the Path she
indicated, we could not lose our way; for in fol-
lowing that Path we would find the true Key of
Life: a knowledge of the essential divinity of man.
