THE OlllGIN OF THE EGYPTIAN J.ANGUAGE

EXTB.ACTED FR.OH THE ASIATIC JOU&llAL.
The leamed have ventured to decypher those Egyptian writings, which
have transmitted to our days convincing evidence of the power and mag-
nificence of a civilized and ancient people, by reference to agriculture,
astronomy, and the extraordinary precepts of Egyptian deities ; but how
grievous has their error been in decyphering the alphabet of a great language,
which contained definite and indefinite, masculine and feminine articles with
different symbols, must be easily discerned by all who are willing to sacrifice
their prejudices at the shrine of truth.
Some writers have asserted, that a reference was necessary to a Chinese
dictionary, and others have alleged, that all the different images of animals,
plants, and furniture, which aretermed Hieroglyphics, are merely ornaments
instead of writing.
What a deplorable loss would it have been to every branch of literature
and science, if, in a country which has been the cradle of the arts, and
whose inhabitants erected such time-conquering monuments of glory, skill,
and power, we had no traces of their history or a capacity for understanding
words which they placed before us, not with the feeble traces of a pen on
paper (which might have suffered from fire or water), but with iron chisels
upon primitive and everlasting rocks !
The fortunate discovery of the Rosetta stone, which is now in the British
Museum, and the vast erudition of Dr.Young, Ackerblad, Sylvestre de Sacy,
and Champollion, to whom the literary world are so much indebted, have
lifted the thick veil which had so long shut out the tide of light.
It has been proved that images of plants, animals, furniture, &c., are
real c.haracters, and have reference to the Coptic language, which is the
same as the ancient Egyptian. Those images have, with a very few excep-
tions, been transmuted into Greek characters, that the Ptolemies might learn
the Egyptian language, by putting down the sounds in their Greek cha-
racters, just as they had heard them from the natives. Theywere then pte-
served in a Greek dress for the promulgation of new laws and dogmas.
The subject to which I now invite attention from the learned, has by
some public writers been understood but superficially, and others of eccentric
dispositions have entirely misconceived it; I mean the nature of the Egyptian
language and its etymology, which unfortunately has not sufficiently engaged
the mind of those great antiquaries, who acquired such reputation by the
decyphering of the Rosetta stone.
Since the time of Scaliger, the first who gave attention to the Egyptian,•
Leonard Abela the Maltese, was sent by Pope Gregory XIII. to Egypt,
and was supposed to ha,·e acquired some knowledge of the language.t

T/1e Origin ef t/Je Eg!fplian Language
Jean Baptiste Remondi proposed to publish a Bible in the Egyptian and
nine other languages, but was unsuccessful.• The learned Peiresk paid a
great deal of attention to this suhject,t and engaged Samuel Petit and
Saumaise to cultivate a full acquaintance with it. He committed to their care
the manuscripts which he possessed; but Saumaise alone acquired a know-
ledge of the language.i About this time Pietro de la Valle returned from
the East, with numerous Egyptian manuscripts, an Egyptian-Arabic lexicon,
and a grammar.§ He, unfortunately, gave his books and papers to P.
Thomas de Navarre (or Thomas Obicinus, as he was sometimes called),
with a view to their translation; the latter, however soon expired,11 and in
a letter which Peiresk received, it was asserted, that no other Coptic books
or manuscripts were found amongst the papers of the deceased. Peiresk,
being anxious to bring the manuscripts of Pietro de la Valle before the
public, had asked them from the latter, but he met with a refusal, and they •
were given to Kircher, who, with their assistance and that of others, which
he found in the great library of the Vatican, was enabled to publish his Pro-
dromus .lEgypliacus(Romre, 1636),and La Lingua .lEgyptica Reslitula,
in 1643, which latter was well received by all the literary world,1[ although it
contained numerous mistakes, which, with the exception of his introducing
words not found in the original, might be deemed excusable, when we
consider that it was a subject pre~enting many difficulties to the author.
Kircher's opinion wa~, that the Greek was derived from the Egyptian.
Gessner in his :Afitkridales,n collected some Egyptian words, which are
transmitted to us by the ancients. Hottingertt gives several details of the
Egyptian language. Theodore Petrreus, during his sojourn in Egypt,
studied the language with great application, and collected many manuscripts.
Unfortunately, his circumstances did not enable him to lay them before the
public ;tt and he only published the first psalm in the Egyptian language,
with an Arabic translation and a Latin version, under the tiUe of " Psal-
lerium Davidis in Lingua Coptica seu .lEgyptiaca, una cum versione
Arabica, nunc primum in Latinam versum et in lucem edilum, a M.
Theodora Pelrtt!o; L1'1fd. Ba/av. sumlihus aucloris." 1663, in 4to.
There is in Sion College, London, the first verse of the first chapter of ....
the Psalms, and a few words of the second verse, in the Egyptian language,
with its pronunciation as he heard it when in Egypt. The page is very
scarce, and so little known, that I shall give it in the samll shape and

are some Egyptian MSS., which Huntingdon collected when in Egyptaod
Syria.t Marshall, the Rector of Lincoln College, intended to have pub-
lished the New Testament in the Egyptian language, which wu announced
ir,i the Preface to the History ofthe Copts;i but unfortunately death prevented
the accomplishment of his ohject. Thomas Edwards devoted a considerable
portion of his time to the study of this language with success; but, finding
not so muoh patronage as he expected, he would have thrown bis manuseripta
intothe fire, had not Picquos and other friends disauaded him from destroying
- them. His Coptic Dictionary is preserved in the U niveflfity of Oxford.j
Ed. Bllrnard was considered a good Egyptian scholar. His copy of
Kircher, containing numerous corrections in its margins, is preserved in the
Bodleian ·library, and Wiston, the famous burgomaster of. Amsterdam, pre-
sented through him the punches of Coptic and Ethiopic to the Oxford Press.u
P. Bonjour had great success in his attentions t.o the language of Egypt,
and left many manuscripts, which are in the Augustinian Conven_t at Rome,
and they include a Coptic-Arabic psalter, an Egytian lexicon, and a literal
translation of the prophet Hosea. He proposed to publish the Pentateuch
in Coptic, but unfortunately had not lei~ure to complete his task.4V
In 1715, Pope Clement XI. sent the learned Jos. Sim. Assemani to
Egypt, for the education of its language.** Pfeiffer devoted him11elf to its
study in Germany, and wrote some verses on the birthday of an elector,
which are published in Blomberg's Fundamen/a Lingu111 Copticte, P· 99.
Andre Muller studied the same language, but without much success, and
two days after his decease, his MSS. were burned.tt . Andre Acolothus, a
clergy.man at Breslau, devoted some attention to the language, but with
what advantage to the learned publio will appear by a brief out.line of his
system. He supposed the old Egyptian language had no connexion wjth
the present Coptic; but that the modern Armenian would furnish us with
the means of understanding the language of the Pharaohs. The modern
Armenian, he says, offers an etymology, sure as well as natural, of all the
Egyptian wordswhich have been transmitted to us by Greekand Latin authors,
and the usage by the Armenians of their capital characters, by figures
of human beings or animals, is the emphatical proof or sign that it is

the Egyptian language: and "surely," says he, " it would provide us with
a key for the comprehension of hieroglyphical writing." The reader, who is
only slightly acquainted with both languages, must see at what a low state
the knowledge of the Egyptian was in the time of the reverend writer, who
intended to develope such ideas in a great work to be called Lingua .LEgyp•
tiaca Resti/ula,* had not death preserved the literary world from his curious
speculations.
In the year 1716, Blumberg published a small Egyptian grammar, under
the title of Fundamenla Lingua! CoptictE, and intended to have given a
lexicon, had not death prevented its completion.
A large collection of Egyptian books and manuscripts have been deposited
in the King's Library at Paris. Louis Picque, doctor of Sorbonne, devoted
himself with considerable ardour to this great pursuit, and was the first who
found that there were ditferent provincial dialects. " To him," says the
learned M. Quatremere, "we owe some ingenious etymologies of Joseph's
name:"
" Ce nom, que les septante ecrivent -}olo,u. ~·•rix, est compose, suivant
Picques, des mots Coptes ncoT il<l>€tt€2_,, 1al1a mundi (v. Commerc. lit-
terar. p. 296; it. Lettre aJacquelot, dans la vie de Lacroze, p. 290 et 298).
Cette etymologie, qui a ete egalement proposee par Jablonski (Glo11ar•
.LEgyptiac. ed. Te Water, p. 213; itap. Michaelis, SupPl.em. ad [,e.rica Hebra'ioa,
p. 2129), me parait la 1eule veritable, et t1aul beaucoup mieu1 que toute11
celles qui ont ete indiquees par dift'erens savans, et meme par le P. Bonjour,
et par le savant M. Jl'orster ("6 B9110 Antiquorum, p. 101 et suiv.)."
This is the testimony of M. Quatremere, in his Recherchessurf Egypte,
p. 74, which was published so late as 1808, and I know no work which
gives a further illustration of that name ; but, with great deference to all
my predecessors, I fearlessly assert, that it had a very ditferent meaning in
the mind of Pharaoh. I read the name as it is in Hebrew, nlJ1D nlDJt.
According to the Bible, Joseph saved the lives of the Egyptians; for they
lltlid 1ln"nn,' thou hast kept us alive.' Gen. xlvii. 25. Now the words

Hebrew, would by the same sound convey the same idea to all those who
understood his language.

corrections in the Lexicon of Kircher, which was seen by Seebisch, at the
Dominicians of Rue St. Honore, Paris.•
In the year 1716, the Abbe Renaudot published a collection of orien~l
liturgies,t three of them (S. Basil, S. Gregory, S. Cyrill) have been tran•·
lated from the.Coptic; to that translation was added a commentary and
many dissertations ; the title of one is De Copticorum Alezandrianoru"'
Liturgiis.
Clodius also took up the study of that language, and is said (by him·
self) to have corrected a great many mistakes of Kircher.*
By the toil of these learned men the Egyptian language did not make any
progress; their successors were still obliged to undergo immense labour, by
studying without lexicons or any other guide which might have assisted them.
If, therefore, we do not find amongst them a perfect treatise on the etymo-
logy of that language, or on its origin, we must not be surprised. But
even among all the bright stars, such as Wilkins, Lacroze, Jablonski,
Raphael Tuki, M. Scholtz, Woide, the Cardinal Borgio in Rom., P.
Georgi, M. T. Bernard de Rossi, Thomas Valperga, the Baron Sylvestre
de Sacy, M. Schow, Tattam, Peyron, &c., some of whom provided us with
good grammars and lexicons, others with translations, so that we might
say the Egyptian language was well known to them, still we only dis-
cover sli'gltt traces of their etymological investigations. The learned
Quatremere, who gives a full description of all the authors, and whom I

l'H~breu, n'ontpu apporter pour preuve qu'un petit nombre de mots, dont la
rassemblance peut etre attribuee au Aasard."
I have, therefore, considered it a most important task to investigate that
branch of Egyptian etymology. I know that etymology is a dangerous
field for enquiry, as a great many are misled even by etymologyzing their
own mother tongue, much more easy is it to be misled in a language so
old as that which we now treat of, and which has been for thousands of
years almost forgotten. My discovery has not been accidental, nor have
I been indebted to the similarity between the Egyptian and another power-
ful language. I investigated the nature of each word, divided it into mo·
nosyllables, compared it according to the sound which it might have had in
its original writing, compared the same word to another of the same con-
tents, so that it sometimes required an hour or two for acquiring the real
etymology ·of that word. True grammatical traces were my chief stimu-
lants to pursue a study in which I had such difficulties to encounter. I
now beg the reader's kind attention to the grammatical consideration of the
language.
Before proceeding to the analysis of the Article, I think it necessary to
acquaint the reader, that my intention was not at all to follow the traces of
some grammarians (who described the Article first, for its necessary prece-
dence of the noun, which they thought the basis of the language), as I am
of quite a different opinion, for a most important reason, which I shall ex-
plain in the following investigation of the Article.
The Egyptian Article
is· expressed by the monosyllable OOffi n. m, which has a striking si-
milarity to the Hebrew word nD 'here,' or 'tMa here.' By examining
its different significations, we shall easily discover the reason why itbas been
named thus.
Let us suppose a person surrounded by a people to whom his language '
would be unintelligible, and he still wishing to point out a certain thing
which he might have a de'i'ire for, he would be obliged to communicate his
wish by signs, to shew with his finger, MD, ' here,' ' this here' (I am de-
siring) ; but as it might happen that those who. were with him were not
just looking at him, he then, to attract their attention, would be obliged to
accompany his signs with a natural. so~md, brought forth solely by his breath,
which is the sound of an aspirated h n, and passing through the pressure .
of his lips, would produce the sound of a p !), ni (nD).
It would thus be evident, that the Hebrew word nD ' mouth,' is com-
posed of two sounds; .one then k, signifying ' the breath,' and the other
rn911ized by Google
10 The Origin ofthe Egyptian Language
the D1'• signifying ' lipa; and the whole word, being the first natural pro-
duction of the mouth, denotes it, n!) ' mouth.'
The expression of the word here is also given by that word Mi>;· only
with a difference in its diacritical points, which, in etymological researches,
is of very little consequence, as it only requires to make use of such a sound
when we would attract the hearer's attention to that spot, here.
Consequently, the Egyptian article n'i o(cl>LI, ' tit•,' or • this,' the
demonstrative pronoun, is exactly the Hebrew word nD ' this,' or 'that.'
There is another discovery, which may be considered as not unimportant.
Grammarians have always been inclined to derive the Hebrew article -:n,
with a dagesh in the next character, from the Arabic J', but I cannot
perceive any necessity for it ; a:1 soon as it is evident that the aspirated
sound Ii n has been the original one for expressing the word /his, why
should we not rather think that the Hebrew n, with a dagesh in the fol-
lowing letter, is of the very same nature ? The dngesh might as well re-
place the a.c;pirate sound of another n It, as it does according to the gram-
marians for a J.
I cannot therefore agree with any grammarian who should consider either
the n,oun or the verb as the original basis of language. I should think
there has always been the greatest necessity to shew what we were de-
siring; hence the article n'i the, or the demonstrative pronoun this, has
been the /rue basis of all languages.
1'/ie Arlicle,femi11ine gender,
is expressed hy c:::::. ; T, e, t, the very character corresponding to the
Hebrew n, forms the feminine gender, like ,,:Jl, by the addition of the
T or n, becomes feminine, l'l',:Jl, •i?fl:J, l'l'Wl::l, &c.
The feminine article T is also used in Egyptian, in the same way, to
change the masculine into feminine as in the Hebrew ; for instance:
In Hierogl. xior in Hierat. zicon denotes •a brother,' m
Hebrew MN ' a brother.'
.fV\l'N\
In Hierogl. l0 ~ or in Hierat. liTcwne denotes 'a sis/er,'
in Hebrew n-mN ' a sister.'
Thus it is evident that con ' a brother,' becomes feminine, denoting
a si'sler, by adding a T. Tcone, just as in Hebrew nN 'a brother,'
by the addition of a l'l becomes l'llMN ' a sister.'
The T, or n, aTso signifies the feminine gender in the future tense,
.,ONn ' she will say,' 1;n 'she will go,'

the n for a c. I need not speak about, as it is well known how frequently
it changei;1 in almost all the languages.
The nouns form their plural by changing € into €0"¥', the same ter-
mination relates to the formation of the plural in Hebrew verbs, as from
i'm ' to walk,' i::>1
m ' they walked,' -,oil/ ' to keep,' i-,ow ' they kept.'
The nominative case is expressed by the words Itx€, i l or It, permu-
ting the (}'for ~, which is the case in Sahidic, in the same word ; here we
recognise the Hebrew· word Mtzm ' subject,' which is the noun when
placed in the nominative case. ...
The genitive case is denoted by the word ItT€ , which is a composition
of tO and 11N; the genitive ba.'I then the same power as in other languages,
of di ot du ; thus, -,:::iin TINO ' of the word,' instead of 11N tO. Reading
that word in Hieroglyphics, we only discover the· It and the T, which
might prove that it was alluding to a word terminating in It and T, as is
to he seen in the following passage, which is read on the tomb of Me-
nephtah the 3d, first corridor:

plural of some adjectives is denominated by the termination analogous to
the Hebrew 017iiJn, C'l~pn, C'l:ln.
The comparative is formed by the word €2,0T€ 'above' or ' more
than ;' the € with the accent, we know, denotes a deficient character, which
might be It; thus €It would probably have been introduced by a rapid
pronunciation, instead of lO ; the following syllable 2,0T is undoubtedly
the word nN ; consequently €2,0T€ would be composed of lO and nN ,
which is the real comparative sign in the Hebrew i'nNO ?iiJ ' taller than
his brother,' or inNO ?iiJ.
The superlative degree is sometimes formed by adding € to the positive,
with TRp ' all/ the syllable € is like the above-mentioned lO and T€p
' is perfectly,' changing the T into an <:); the Hebrew word "INUJ ' all
the others ;' thus we recognise the superlative degree of the Hebrew ?iiJ
.,NttlO ' taller than all ihe others ;' instead of ~Nit' 10. In Sahidic and
Bashmuric, the superlative is sometimes formed by eH.A,T€ ; here the
Hebrew word iNO is to be seen as plain as possible, which is in fact a
principal sign for expressing the superlative in Hebrew.
The Pronouns.
The affinity of Egyptian pronouns with the Hebrew is too clear to re- •
quire any preliminary observation; it is only to be remarked, that the prin-
cipal sound of the first person singular is kept throughout all the different
pronoun!>, which contradicts those grammarians who suppose that n:JN has
been the original root of the pronoun, and it is a striking argument in
favour of my view, which the reader will be furnished with by the Egyptian
word Wlt2,, 'to live,' or' to breathe.'

The possessive pronouns are composed of the radical sound of the per-

Egyptians always made use of the personal pronoun instead of a ; 'to.'

The demonstrative and relative pronouns are sometimes prefixed to the

which is abridged by the word •?w ' mine,' ' bP.longs to me,' or i?it' , l?it' ,

The definite pronouns are c{>A.l or &A.I ; here the same is to be observed
as that which has been explained in speaking of the definite article.
The interrogative pronou~ mn, 'who,' or' what,' is exactly the He-
brew word •o or no? 10 , only it is transcribed from Hieroglyphics,
where it is expressed by ~ or f 0 0 0 0
1 , which might have been
read no, or 10, or •O, as well as Cl, or 0'l . I shall have an ample op-
portunity of explaining this, when analysing the word T2'lll€ 'woman.'
In the Sahidio , the interrogative pronoun is expressed by the word
A.2'PO? Here I am inclined to recognise the words ,; no ' what is to
him'!' The sounds~ and ~· are frequently changed one into
another; the same we know is the case with p and A; consequently, in
the question A.2'POK ? ' what is to you ?' we discover 1; no?
I shall now proceed to the analysis of several hundred words, which are
expressed by similar sounds and characters in the Hebrew and Egyptian
languages.
A.It2> or Wlt2'' to live.' The word nlN in Hebrew signifies ' to sigh,' to
breathe,' as well as it denotes the pronouns.' I' and' We.' •:JlN, llMlN.
rn911ized by Google
14 The Origin ef the Egyptian Language
It signifies ' to rett' nl and also ' a place of repo1e' nnuo. It abo
means • an upright line to measure,' 1lN no1n ?r (Amo1 vii. 7).
Sighing ~r breathing is the sign of life. If, for instance, A entered a
dark room, and asked if there were any person present, the answer of B,
produced by a sigh or heavy breathing, would be an evidence that there
was. Therefore, the pronouns I and We are given by the same root
nlN ' to sigh,' ' to breathe,' only with a permutation of the n into a :J,
as it only requires a sigh or heavy breath to make known the presence of
a living creature. The Hebrew word ' to rest ' and the Egyptian word ' to
deep ' are expressed by the same root nu as breathing distinguishes 1leep
or repo1e from death LnJ<oT €nJ<LT €nJ<oT.
The same root also denotes a place of repose nnno, and as the root
is associable generally with an upright walking creature, it has been
used for a perpendicular line to measure with 1lN.
~€n or ~wn denotes ' a judgment,' in the Egyptian language, and 91n
'a harbour,' or' protection,' in the Hebrew. As one class of men are
chosen for the protection of the weuk, so a harbour protects the mariner
from the ocean's violence.
W~ or ~L~ ' affiiction ' 1:JO. This word is derived from 1:30
which signifies 'to hend;' hence TnN 110• •:Jl 'if thy brother will be
bent (by affliction, or distress').
S!JHPI ' a son ' ,NtV the nearedt relation wn ,,Nit'; it seems to be a termi-
nation of,iV::J 'flesh.' The I of S!JHpl is like the (')in Hebrew, which
forms the word into a substantive, as ,::ll-',::>J, ,3'0-•,m.
fS'f..o(f" ' a bed ' ?o ' a basket.' It may be naturally dupposed that, in the
early ages, parents plaited branches of trees into a kind of basket,
which prevented their children from falling when asleep; and hence a
basket is called bed ; the termination o(J"'is a Greek one, of.
n€' heaven' i1JlD or i1V:l ' swelling' or ' rising,' is so called from its ap-
pearance in rainy weather, when clouds seem swelled with water; hence
i1Jl:l , like rlW:lll:lN-nJlDN ni?1•::i; ' to lament • or ' calt,' for the
rising or swelling of the throat.
pw.t..l.€ ' a man ' no, ' high ' ' upwards,' 01,; hence a man, from his
constantly walking upright, and his superior intelligence, 01,.
Of the same root would then be the Egyptian pyramids, signifying the
high and superior one, mpw.l.l.€.
Adler, in his BibHsck critiscke Reise nach Rom, p. 192, said, pLilA.
or PLill signified ' height.' The learned object that the word pLilA.
is not to be found in the Egyptian language with this meaning ; but I think
the word which denotes ' man,' pwil€, is the same as that for 'pyra-
mid,' -both of them signifying ' a superior one.' And this opinion agrees
with the idea of the learned Baron Sylvestre de Sacy, who, in his Obser-
vations sur le nom des Pyramides, p. 26, demonstrated by his vast
erudition that the characters ~pil, in many languages, alwaJS denote

a certain distinguished place ; as the word pw.u..e, 01, or no, could
also be included under the same root.
€J>Cl>LI • a temple,' would be recognised by the Hebrew word M::l"1N , which
originally denoted ' a window on the top of the house.' The same word
is also used for ' chimne9;' or ' the window on the top of the house,' has
also been made use of for a chimney, as i1::l"1NO 1W)1:11 (Ho1hea xiii. 3) :
hence the name of a house or vessel in the Talmudical terms was denoted
by the same word.
That the windows were important features in a temple, would appear
by the fact that one at Dendera had 180 of them; one only was opened in
succession every day, probably for the admission of the sun or for the
egress of the sacrificial smoke. (See De Sacy's Oh1ervatio111 mr le nom

Before I analyze many words compounded with A.T, I must make one
observation. The word I am afluding to is A.T, which always denotes
in the Egyptian language 'not.' The same word is to be found in He-
brew under the following significations: the root of it is niy ' to walk,'
or ' to pass away,' in the same sense as the word .,:l.Jt ' to pass,' is used
speaking of the time; hence, iy ' prey,' iy ~JM' "'lp:l:l ' a thing which
has been taken away,' and is no more in the hands of its owner. Thus
the meaning of A.Tin Egyptian is analogous to the Hebrew, and always
denotes ' not,' or ' deprived of.'

This root has been made use of for the name of the great man,
who, when a child, was taken out of the water by the Egyptian
princess Thermuthis.
It has been reasonably thought by mariy learned persons that his name
must have been an Egyptian one, as Thermuthis gave it to him in her mother

tongue, and the etymology of it was supposed to be either a composition of
.u..wo-r•GI. .u..wo-.:-cwt (bett.er C€T), or .u..wo-r-sge,• as all
these words commemorate his wonderful preservation from the wat.er.
But a most difficult question still remained; whose words were the fol-
lowing inn'WI) c•on lO ':l " because out of the wat.er did I take him?"
Ezod. ii. JO.
These words could not have been said by Thermuthis, as they are the
plainest Hebrew words which could possibly have been used, and they cannot
be the words of the Bible, as they are used in the first person lnn•wo.
I therefore propose another etymology, which might be preferred to the
former for two reasons. One is that I do not take. the word as a compound
one, but read it as it is, and the other is, that I am able, by transcribing
the whole passage into hieroglyphics and Coptic, to shed a light on all the
following word·s as they were spoken in plain Egyptian by Thermuthis,
and as they are still Hebrew. The affinity of the former with the latter is
strongly proved even by that passage alone.
Thermuthis did not consider the former birth which had been given to
him by his mother as one which gave him life in this world, as he was
exposed to perish in the waters. The Princess was the person who might
be considered as the giver of his birth and existence by her preserving him.
She therefore considered him as her son, p; nC, 'i1'l loco laudato, and
called bis name " Born, because out oflhe waler is liefirst born."

The learned reader will not object that in the last word is in Egyptian
S!JA..U..lCI and in the Hebrew "-A.S!JICI as ·this is a case so frequently
met with, and if still he be not satisfied with it, I can even propose another
etymology, which is exactly the same as in Hebrew (permutating n for rz:);
only the last syllable l i1 would not be expressed, which would not be of so
much consequence if only the principal sense of the passage is well preserved.
It is to be expect.ed that a oorrupt.ed offspring of a language might lose
in a whole passage one syllable which sounds sometimes like a vowel
u ,· I would then transcribe it into Egyptian, and the meaning would be
instead of "was the first born," " was the son born."

to see another Augustan age before I pay the debt of nature.
.l..l.€TL Te.U.0"¥' ' immortal.' Before I proceed to the analysis of
those words which are composed of .U.€'T, it is necessary to observe,
that I do not agree with preceding grammarians, that .U.€'T denotes, in
such words, the conjunction' and.' · I cannot comprehend what there is to
be understood in ~€, 'free,' and .U.€'T~€' liberty.' What
relation can it have to a word which would express' andfree' .'l I think
the syllable .U.€'T could be better translated, if added to another word in
the way of composition by no, the syllable which forms a verb to a sub·
stantive, in the ?vDnn. I need not remind the reader, that the Hebrew
has not a present tense, as this is always expressed by the substantive and
the personal pronoun. Thus, a person who teaches himself is called
io;no, and to express ' I teach myself now' is rendered by io?no •lN :
therefore the syllable .U.€'T, added to any verb or adjective, would de-
note a substantive. But if it be objected, that even the syllable which I
alluded to is a composition of a o, which is the real sign of the participle,
and the n belongs to the ;l'Dnn ; I answer, it is so for the very reason
that the syllable no is only the transforming sign into ;l'Dnn; a con-
jugation which expresses a reciprocal fact, always signifies that such and
such an action has peifectly been done, as ~here is nothing better exe-
cuted than that which the man does for himself. Therefore, no would,
according to that idea, denote 'entirely;' thus the above-mentioned word
.l..l.€'TL Te.U.0"¥' is r-iio iv r-io 'entirely not dend.'

,:J lD~.11' o•povi 'and vallies are covered with grain.'-Ps. lxv. 14.
Grain, or any other nourishment, is expressed by the word which denotes
'to enlighten,' as abstinence from nourishment causes a weakness in sight,
and taking customary food strengthens it. When Jehonatan tasted the
honey, he said 'l'l11,N •::> Nl 1N'1 ' look here, how bright my eyes are!'
1 Shem. xiv. 29. Hence '1:l 'grain,' and even a verli has been made of it
on; 'l'1:Jrt1 2 Shem. xiii. 5. Thus, any fruit, also •l~::l ''1D is denomi-
nated by the same syllable : ·J~:J '1::1 noi Pro'IJ. xxxi. 2. Then the meaning
of the word returns to its origin ; for expressing soap, which cleans other
things, it is called o•t:t:i::io rt•'1:l::l1 Malach. iii. 2; and lastly it denotes an
expression for a true, pure friendship. If two persons agree in their ideas,
or are convinced of reciprocal affection, such a coincidence of pure hearts
is then called n•'i:I ' purity.'

The Egyptians never put down their words as we do at present, viz.
write fil"llt an article, then the adjective or number, accordingto grammatical
construction ; they always putdown their principal idea, and then surround-
ed the figure by signs, for gender, number, and adjective, not in a particular
direction, but as it happened to suit the com·enience of the writer.
It may be supposed that in transcribing the holy characters carved on stone
(hieroglyphics) into hieratic, or into enchorial (common writing), they used
to put down those characters from left to right, instead of from the right to
the left as before. Thus they wrote, instead of €.IJ.., which is expressed by
the figure of a woman ft.,and proceeding from the right to the left, the
Pyllable T~I ~: so that it was to be read n•n ON. When transcribing
D.
it into common characters, they put down W rThe syllable €.IJ.., which
is expressed by an ichnographical line of the plain female figure Zi we see
on the left hand side of the group, and the next two signs, which are to
express T2'1'! are now to be seen on the right. Thus it is plain that

That the n has been transcribed into a n is well ascertained by several
observations which I have made.
XW.U.' a book,' is the Hebrew word ciTU ' to set, or lay before.' The
permutation of X for <f' I
sufficiently demonstrated at
the nominative 11X€, which
is in Bashmuric ncr€, but
it would be necessary to speak
in some detail respecting the
relation or letting, or laying
before, to the word which
should express hook. Let us
inquire what root bas been
made use of in the Hebrew
for the word hook. It is ex-
pressed by the root i:.io ' to
relate,' to acquaint the suc-
ceeding generations with that
which occurred in our time :
xwpt •strong, mighty,'
cS"LA€ 'lame,'
i:i::i '.llN:l i:ion wo;i.
Ezod. x. 2. The laws which are
to be left for posterity, or any
thing which should be com-
municated to others, in order
that it might be kept in their
memory, is expressed by the
word oiiu : thus, :-i'.?Ni

which thou shouldst lay be-

of commandments, that they
should be permanent in their

hence a hook i!>O is derived
from -,go ' to relate,' and in
the Egyptian from the root

I have adopted the words in general as they occurred to me in reading
whole passages or in the lexicon, and it will be found that numbers of them
correspond exactly·in the Hebrew a111l Egyptian languages. The reason
I have not given the pronunciation of the latter and the punctuation of the
former is, the Hebrew words are so very plain and so coincident with the
Egyptian, that every person who is acquainted with the Hebrew can read
them with facility.
Unfortunately I have been unable to see Rossi's Etymologitl! .lEgyp-
tiactc, whicb the highly learned Baron de Sacy named to me when I had the
gratification of conversing with him in Paris.
The annexed title-page has been copied verbatim from a book which con-
tains several 1Ethiopic translations ofRuth, Jonah, Joel, Malachi, and Zepha-
niah, as well as some chapters from the New Testament. No. 6. is a portion
ofthe Psalm now under consideration. The number o( the volume is 61. H.
That the Egyptian language is a corrupted offspring of the venerable
Hebrew will, I trust, appear to all who are impartial in the examination
of the proofs which I have now adduced, and which I pnrpose to continue
if encouraged so to do.
