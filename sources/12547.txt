Then I was engulfed in light and there was a place - a completely black place I couldn't see through or break through. The light was warm and inviting and I felt like I was a kid in my grandmother's arms - the only safe place in the world. I felt myself losing everything then I heard a woman's voice scream 'NO it is not yet his time!' I awoke and was in an emergency room with the taste of charcoal in my mouth and mad as hell.
