PREFACE
The source and value of a book depends upon the
power and force that presents the great urge within
the author's mind to give to the world the particular
book or treatise upon given subjects. Then another
estimable import depends upon the reader. A book
may make known to the reader, many things which
the book does not contain, or eliminate many others.
There may be perhaps a thousand read a book; the
majority of the nine hundred and ninety nine hurriedly
skimming its pages, thus missing its luxurious fruits
of wisdom. While one may concentrate and meditate
as he reads its pages ; gleaning much of its real truths.
The author has endeavored in rather an allegorical
manner to elucidate the different chapter-lessons in a
short concise manner; bringing through the study a
clearer understanding of the metaphysics and the psy
chology of right thinking. Desiring to reach hungry
souls who are earnestly searching for more light, yet
who cannot delve deeper into the esoteric, until learn
ing the basic principles. The soul must have literature
to correspond with its present capacity; then sail on
and on into richer fields of promise.
The author if a thinker, places his stamp indelibly
on the printed pages. His thought inspired through
the great universal agencies or apparently his own, is
photographed upon the pages, there to seek the perusal

of other minds, to be carried onward from mind to
mind in an endless chain, through the great crucible
for universal good.
The author's prayer is, if The Keeper of the Temple
has enlightened or benefited the reader in any manner,
it is a part of the law of service to permit others to
benefit by it,—PASS IT ON.

INTRODUCTION
In presenting the The Keeper of the Temple, it is the
author's desire to bring to the reader something of
an understanding through the short treatise of each
special lesson, of the law of cause and effect (as we sow
we reap,) that every thought a man thinks, has its ef
fect upon his destiny and that man is his own maker
through the equalization of Divine law, all of which
brings a practical Christianity through service.
A magnificent gift this—with which the Creator of
all good gifts has endowed one, this gift is life.
Few know what use to make of it, for few know
why they are, what they are, or just where they are
going. To aquire this knowledge, is to get in tune with
the Infinite. There God's law will be the able teacher,
pointing the way to the place of eternal life and direct
ing thy steps toward the safety zone, while in this ex
pression.
Thus does it keep hearts throbbing in the glorious
ecstacy of living on, by finding greater joy in human
sympathy, following the path of the Master Christ,
He who trod the path of the Golden Rule, which is
justice and service.
The author pleads with the reader to become more
alert; for it is very necessary all become more con
scious of the new age we're living in. It is an age of
marvelous possibilities, the age of reason.

This volume on practical psychology or the laws of
life and the art of living well, brings a special message.
Through it one discovers there are fixed immutable
laws of nature, opperating in man, which bring one
happiness or unhappiness, health or disease.
One is obliged1 through desire and experience some
times, to discover the law that liberates him from the
shackles and bondage of ignorance. For desire is the
genius seeking for outer expression; determination is
good, still better is knowledge of the I AM.
For as one becomes a good servant, he learns to be
come a good master. Thus becoming ones own re
deemer, through service.
The Keeper of the Temple teaches how to attain the
highest in ones own religion, each being allowed the
privilege of his brother who may follow a different
path yet, however divergent they appear, leading
finally to the holy temple of God.
Few arrive at the pinnacle of spirituality which
has been sought by many, but found only by a few.
These have been obliged to search dilligently and to
study well the great laws of life, God and nature.
These are the souls who are constantly praying for
sober, earnest conscientious students of God's universal
laws to see still greater light.
The author's earnest desire is to blaze the trail,
make it smoother and safer for those feet to travel who
seek through the esoteric door the exemplification of
God's divine truths, also to discover where their source
of supply lies.
Those who have found the illumined path should be
daily charting seas for other ships ; for they know love

and service are links through which all discover rich
fruitage of eternal life.
Each chapter lesson is a short treatise on some all
important subject ; a compass pointing the way onward
to greater achievements on the path toward Master
ship, whereon every soul is obliged to travel alone.
The Keeper of the Temple demands much, use your
intuitional powers with great consideration, with si
lent meditation, concentration, energization, peace,
poise and power, that makes for perfect health, and
beauty of soul; that the Temple throughout will be a
sacred and holy place of communion, an ever-ready
station for giving and receiving; where the masters,
seers and sages can be entertained at Thy Holy Sanctu
ary.
Lives of great men all around us
We can make our lives sublime.
And departing, leave behind us,
Footprints on the sands of time.
—Longfellow.

CHAPTER I
Lesson l
THE KEEPER OF THE TEMPLE
"Know ye not that ye are the temple of the living God."
Here is the secret of the wonderful creative power of the world.
The secret power of the Master. -
If one will permit the I AM,- the God
within to have full control to be the
-» Keeper of the Temple—the Watch-
man at the Door—he will find success
" on all plains of life.
It is when one omits the recogni
tion of this omnicient power, endeav
oring to walk the path alone that he
discovers his failures in demonstrat
ing the law.
Jesus said, "Behold I stand at the
door and knock. If any man hear my
voice and open the Door I will come in
an sup with him and he with me." This is becoming
one with the Father. God the omnipotent is daily
knocking at one's consciousness (the door of the Holy
Temple) . If permitted to come in and dwell there, he
will be the keeper and daily guest. Jesus said, "I and
my Father are one." To fully mainfest this at-one-ment
is to have Health —Abundance of Supply and Power.

It is God the great architect that has so graciously
given into your hands the keys and plans of the Holy
Temple—Thy sanctuary thy earthly abode while upon
this earthly plane—put them safely into the secret
recess of the Soul, there to hang upon the walls of this
inner Temple beautiful and wholesome thought pic
tures. Sacred because of their Holiness —beautiful in
their force and power.
One becomes through earnest effort a creator a
master builder of the beautiful. Where he alone sets
his own boundries —builds his own foundation —con
structs his- own Temple.
-Thought Pictures
Give freedom to thoughts, then as an artist with
skilled fingers molds from plastic clay thought pictures
from his mind, thus will the soul become a sacred
shrine to rise higher and higher through conscious
realization of its oneness with God. Molding and con
structing through properly directed thoughts.
People should never put limitations and barriers up
on themselves, it binds one down to eternal drudgery.
Burn all barriers by daily communication with the
loving Father the Keeper. This acquaintanceship and
Divine contact is discovered and maintained through
entering the shrine of silence. Here one constantly
familiarizes himself more and more with God's won
derful love, bounteous goodness and supply.
At the second altar, the shrine of silence, one is in
close communion and in harmonious relationship with
this Divine presence, where His radiance illuminates
the Soul by increasing the spiritual vibrations,

strengthening and building to a greater degree a more
perfect Temple. Putting additional incense upon the
fires at the altar of love to be fanned into closer at-
one-ment, beauty and force by concentrated and
constructive scientific thinking.
The healing—strengthening —purifying and joy-
giving bounties of this Master architect is accessible
to all, to have and to hold, for through konwledge of
Divine law one can constantly refine the vibrations of
thought, through scientific constructive thinking, with
a poised and radiant mind they will become a beautiful
mental flower-garden. The care-taker or Keeper of
the Temple is tending it through love, peace, power
and Divine Wisdom.
"Attuned to Harmonial Law"
Thus one is attuned to the harmonial law, this in
turn harmonizes the physical functions of life attun
ing the whole being and contacting Divine supply.
The scales of being when properly attuned sound
one harmonious note, where life responds in Rythmic
tones of love—in turn gathering and gleaning spiritual
power through the Christ atmosphere.
Hold steadfast to the priceless key of Divine Love
that unlocks the gates of the Holy Temple, the new
Jerusalem; where the highest heartfelt aspirations
and the transcendent radiance dawns, hastening on
the new day of the long desired and anticipated mil
lennium.
Wherever you are, be noble,
Whatever you do, do well,
Whenever you speak, speak kindly,
Give joy where'er you dwell.

CHAPTER II
Lesson 2
THE APPRENTICESHIP
"Ever standing guard at the door of thy soul with the
illumined key of wisdom and love will be found daily and hourly
the Keeper of the Temple, God."
When Seeking Realization and
Illumination, be courageous with pa
tience toward those who would do you
injustice. Keep an open mind to re
ceive and a pure heart, with patient
fidelity and faithful adherence to ob
ligations. "Be not too critical, a fault
finder, be ready to face your own
faults and willing to rectify them."
Keep progressive by constructive
thinking.
Know through the power within
you can untimately conquer your
greatest problems that face you on the Onward Path.
Preserve unbiased spiritual perception with compas
sion for all others on the Path, whether or not they
think as yourself. Know they are equally God's chil
dren and pupils. Be willing to give as well as receive
spiritual instruction.

Look onward to higher and nobler ideals of progres
sion and perfection knowing there is an unlimited
supply of wisdom in the temple of light, and always
more luxurious fruits on the tree of knowledge.
Keep constant and true to thy own self, never shirk
an obligation or duty you owe the Master.
Only through service can the highest pinnacle of
perfection with the realization of thine own illumined
soul, be reached.
Drink deeply from the fountain whose waters are
fed by the springs of eternal truth where the inex
haustible light will shine in thy soul forever.
Sometimes it is necessary to go through fire to burn
all the dross and to purify the gold within the human
soul.
"Seek the pathway of Divine Wisdom, there to find
the Master Key to the Temple of Truth."
When forever associated with the Keeper of thy
Temple, one attains poise, discretion, consideration.
Go often into thy silent shrine for meditation. Learn
to master concentration, thus gathering energy, peace,
power, contacting perfect health and beauty of Soul.
Then the Temple through-out will be a sacred and
holy place for communion; where thy own developed
and inspired consciousness perceives the transcend
ent glow of Divine Wisdom and Power.
Love is the golden key.
It turns the lock, illumines the way,
Where men discover life's rich treasures awaiting them.

CHAPTER III
Lesson 3
Consummation of Desire
Who seeks heaven for self alone?
They must needs take others with them to atone.
He who works for love alone may wander far
Still God watches, He brings him back where the blessed are.
In the daily routine of life, are the
small things that constantly confront
one that must be mastered ; for unless
one can surmount these try as he may,
he need not hope to master the greater
things he hopes to overcome.
To reach the place intended for all,
as life evolves onward, one is obliged
to first possess an intense desire for
study of the esoteric laws of life with
a determined resolve to possess truth
and gain mental efficiency at any cost.
Persistence is the road whereby
one's efforts may be crowned with glorious success;
where thy feet will be planted upon the pathway of
Divine Light.
When never yielding nor faltering, but still keeping
persistently onward, you create conditions that pave
an invisible pathway to supernal heights.

The consummation of one's greatest desires and
hopes will be gratified when commanding the door of
thy great mind to stay closed against impatience,
doubts, fears, worries of might be's, or fear of ability
to achieve and arise to supernal heights.
Realize your own great power and that your thoughts
can take you to realms of bliss through self determina
tion and will power, trust yourself are you not a part
of God's great cosmic force? Each individual soul
should think more seriously upon these facts, and in
vestigate the higher spiritual laws of life.
Self-Discipline
The journey of the soul is distinctly marked by
self-discipline and justice and each soul who sees the
glimmer of this truith realizes the importance of this
principle ; it may be a marvelous discovery to some.
Through it is found the very necessary conclusion
that patience and perseverance with an even mind
is a practical method of procedure.
Through equal compensation alone does one finally
reach this sacred shrine. In like manner every soul
discovers he is a probationer.
No one can pay another's pass-port (across this
divide) to the promised land, but self alone is obliged
to pay for this ticket by working out salvation through
service.
All have been endowed with sense and mind to dis
cover all that is great and beautiful ; at the same time
life's probationary period here must be marked by
searching out human needs. This is service rendered

the life beautiful.
One constantly discovers the testing fires of life's
experiences are variant and many before a life can be
well lived and measured by the standard of accomp
lishments. If they have done their best no more can
be expected, no more need be desired. God is then
strong within to help with this life's initiation.
Hesiod, the Greek poet, exhorted the husbandman
to pray for the harvest but to do so with his "hand
upon the plow!"
- "Work and pray your best, then God will do the rest."

CHAPTER IV
Lesson 4
No man can acquire knowledge for another, every living
soul is obliged to be its own creator. Its own builder.
-.,„„- All will discover still greater proof
of this fact when entering into the
realms of spirit. Discovering they
have created for themselves either a
Heaven or Hell. A condition of peace
and happiness, or one of constant re
morse, through unaccomplished ef
forts.
No personal Diety or God has
created either of these; they alone
have built around themselves these
conditions.
By conscious realization of the
proper use of the power of thought creation or uncon
sciously, one sends ahead material that builds the
mansion he at some future time will occupy.
It is of greatest importance that all become con
scious of this great and necessary truth now, that is
every one is largely his own creator, making his own
Heaven or Hell, palace or hovel, for one may have

either just to their liking and ability to create through
their working knowledge of the law.
Thoughts are the Creators of Our Future Destiny
Through this is discovered the God consciousness
within. Every soul creates through his own thoughts
and actions his own place here and his abiding place
in the future. Yet few realize their own thought
power is working the machinery that constantly
creates their joys, sorrows, success or failure, their
Heaven or their Hell
If man knows not what he is now, nor his own
capacity and power to create, he should begin to ac
quaint himself with his own great possibilities smol
dering within, that can be fanned into life by the
working machinery of the brain forces. "For the
proper study of mankind is man." Oil up the un
used faculties of the mind, by proper usage, that is,
obey the Divine law and its precepts.
One can gain the knowledge of his relationship to
the laws governing the universe, by identifying self
with this scientific light, discovering where his needs
and limitations, and how to unify himself with the
power that enables one to live a new life, through the
Divine creative fires of love; therein lies the creative
law for health, success and happiness
Some of God's choicest flowers grow low
It depends upon the kind of seed we sow,
If you would happiness with rich treasure find,
To others must learn to be good and kind.
Cultivate the acquaintance and love of others near by
If your own soul's window you hope to clarify.

CHAPTER V
Lesson 5
Creative Vibrations
Life is an arrow, have a mark, aim high, your thoughts are
the bow, send them forth to the skies.
Through this knowldge that thought
is creative vibration; one becomes
conscious that the quality of what is
created depends on the quality of the
thoughts we think.
Each day we are gradually creating
something. What am I creating? Is
the daily question in our silent mo
ments to ask of self. What ever it is,
it is thus producing the vibrations
that mold the future destiny of the
soul.
No two create alike, for no two
think alike. Just as you find a score of musicians
with untuned instruments, all trying to tune in their
own way. There must be one all perfect instrument
to give the key note, that all may tune in as one in
perfect harmony.
In this incident it is the discovering of the key note
that all must vibrate to and that is, God's great Uni
versal law that must be recognized and daily made use

of. Although it is no easy matter to change the
mental attitude, yet by persistent effort one can learn
to dial properly on the universal broadcasting station.
Universal law, or creator of all good, must be our
oorpartner. We must seek and express the first and
nearest in all places and in all things to the ideal of
perfection. For without this there cannot be a per
fect attunement of our being whereby one can receive
through the ether waves wisdom from the masters of
light, whose duty it is to instruct and inspire the earth
children, that they may better prepare themselves
whereby they may best administer unto others who
are less fortunate.
Delve deep into the secret recesses of the mind,
where there are millions of mental workers or dor-
ment brain cells waiting to be called into action. Here
are golden treasures that can be manufactured, the
cultivation of creative and constructive thought force.
Hidden Treasures Discovered
Many continually toil, only upon the surface of life
but when one in a serious and methodical manner dis
covers how to create through the law of attract
ion, then he becomes a real creator of high des
tiny, discovering the wonderful hidden treasures with
in, that can make even earth life a part of Heaven
or paradise. This is harvesting of results.
When one learns to create through scientific think
ing, conditions for himself are bound to change for
the better, and creative energy can take care of a
larger situation as easily as it can a small one. Then
know the Infinite can adjust your affairs in com

parative relation to your knowledge of its use, and
when fully conscious of the Divine workings of this
creative energy, one can weave such an environment
about themselves that all the way to Heaven can be
Heaven! The destination is bought and paid for in
advance. Although not bought by the price of gold,
as many seem to think they can do; but through
service—earnest desire—confidence of purpose and a
firm grip upon knowledge which is power, knowing
that service alone must pay the toll.
Why has the heart relentless yearnings?
For heights and steps untrod.
Some call it the voice of longing
And others the voice of God.

CHAPTER VI
Lesson 6
ATTRACTING NEW CONDITIONS
One sweetest thing on earth
Is loving thoughts,
They build a mansion
In the skies,
No mortal hand has ever wrought.
Through the art of visualizing and
concentration one attracts new con
ditions where he becomes a builder
through magnetic attraction.
Everyone if he so desires can be a
constructor and helper to the Master
Mason, doing his part toward laying
the corner stones first, which is Ser
vice, Power, Love and Faith. These
are the basis of all achievement and
mold through mental action a place
for us in our final construction house
of God.
High Ideals
One should constantly keep the concentrated
thought of high ideals, for our lives are the reflec
tion of our predominant thoughts, thus molding new
thoughts into a perfect pattern, bringing that knowl

edge which is the result of creative thinking ; where
one can penetrate new worlds of thought and experi
ences.
Thus one learns to attract and create approxi
mately all that belongs to him. Then will one
entertain only thoughts that create from within into
outward expression, beauty, peace, Jwppiness, opti
mism, success and the joys of a perfectly rounded life.
By constant association with and working for and
through this divine creative law, does the magnetic
law of attraction draw through service and love as
a steel needle is drawn toward a magnet, to the con
dition all have made for themselves here or here
after. This is the law by which success comes and
all other things that count tot real worth.
'The majority of people believe only in what they
can see; while all the time our actual lives depend
entirely on what we do not see, that is the great
creative power within."
"Shall we constantly keep before us the Godly
mirror of divine inspection; whereby each one may
clearly see by its inner reflection how to mold and
create daily and hourly through this visualizatin
greater physical and spiritual perfection.

Lesson 7
OUT OF THE MISTS
Cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the
outside thereof may become clean also. Matt. 23:26.
Out from the mists of the past two
thousand years of uncertainties the
sun of a new day is born upon the
horizon! This ushers in a new mode
of thinking for through the power of
scientific thought vibrations comes
the greatese awakening.
It is fast scattering the befogged
atmosphere of misconceptions and
old ideas from the vision and replac
ing a new trend of thought. This
scientific age is fast dissolving the
mists of the anthropomorphic God on
the throne, filling the world with an all prevading
God of love.
The world in general, is becoming more analyti
cally inclined and more ready to listen to truth's
finer message—to roll the stone of doubt aside.
Those who have had no conception of life here
after, are now begining to enjoy the real essence of
truth, although the ever bearing fruits of the inner

depending upon how rich the soil of human kindness,
—endeavor, and understanding of God's love, burns
within the human heart for those they contact in the
daily walks of life.
Then how will they keep this soil of human kind
ness fertilized and cultivated ; by exercising the gifts
of the spirit God has given them is another method.
How luxurious and fragrant the blossoms and how
abundant the harvest will become depends upon self
alone. All have a dream. Have hopes and aspir
ations to see materialized sometime, although seeming
so indifferent, for few make an effort toward bring
ing this into a realization.
The Stone of Superstition
Many will say what can I do? Roll the stone of
superstition and prejudice ideas away, for never can
one hope for a great materialization of their wishes
to come true by wasting their precious time waiting,
but rather should they put into application the great
thought forces, that everyone has and should be
capable of using with the co-operation of the spirit
ual agencies who are appointed as ministering
forces.
Then by sincere desire which are prayers in em
bryo, visualizing an image of this desire, then
through useing the powerful energy and thought
forces he can bring into realized fruitage the desire
out of the seeming mists.
This is one of the scientific methods, that have
finally come to the befogged minds, through dis

carding the old method of thought for a more pro
gressive method of procedure that brings about the
desire. But no longer should one hope to receive
these things we will call spiritual blessings without
work for Jesus said, '"Prayer without works is dead.''
With this new understanding of life with its
various and perplexing problems apparently solved,
living becomes a joyous reality; appreciating then
the things one's own mentality has helped to bring
into expression.
Keep en Rapport With Power
Out of the mists of old superstition into the sun
light of the new psychology of thought, are dreams
being realized. Putting into application the use of
the law governing Divine Supply; one must in any
degree, keep en rapport with this power and in
harmony with the Christ consciousness.
Thus realizing one's own power, the I AM is the
central dynamo of thought, making ideal dreams
not a supposition but a reality. Keeping the machin
ery of the mind working, correspondent with the
higher forces of spirit.
"We are all probationers here. When our time
has expired we will receive our reward according to
merit."
Fill the time so full of worthy actions that the
search light, shinning through the mists, will reveal a
life rounded out by rich gifts of love and philan
thropy.
''Our greatest happiness should be in helping
those less fortunate than ourselves."

How long a time must pass until all those in the
light will wish to interest themselves in those who
inhabit the misty atmosphere of doubt and dread of
a hereafter.
The sun will not shine less bright by letting others
share with you your knowledge, joy, and the as
surance of an after-life.
There is sunshine enough for all, do not be selfish
in the distributing of it.
The stars in their brightness and beauty, sparkle
none the less brilliant by giving of their silvery
light to all alike.
The silvery moon-beams sends rays of light to
every nook and crevice, just as bright as it shines
upon the great wide oceans.
If all would begin the distribution of just a small
portion of the sunlight and happiness that comes
into their lives, they would not be lessening their
share but bring out of the mists others to share alike
with them and thereby helping on the great millen
nium.
"Knowing the loftiest peaks, rise out from the
low valleys the bright shining summits add glory
to their hidden foundation."
The world is ne'er a vale of tears.
Smile the Mists away, till rainbows span it,
Inspire with love that life endears,
Then all the world will find it."

CHAPTER VIII
LESSON 8
A KEY TO AN OPEN DOOR
"The keynote of helpfulness is a key of love opening the
door of loving service."
One may have keys of all descrip
tions, yet not apply the right one that
will open the dormant possibilities
which are securely locked within the
vault of human consciousness.
There are many keys of helpful
ness, and of great assistance toward
opening this door. A great deal of
trouble appears to be in so much
mental agitation. Too fast living, not
enough time given to the more seri
ous problems of life where, if given,
time and study would give to one the
key that would calm the troubled waters and make
smoother sailing for themselves and those about
them.
For violent commotion or agitation, inattentive,
inconsiderate and thoughtless multitudes of souls
today vibrate to other souls who are sensitive their
own thought waves.
This is a chain that should be broken as quickly

as possible by trying to cultivate the soil of human
kindness and thoughtfulness, taking into consider
ation others and allowing them the privilege at least
of living quiet, peaceful lives if they so wish.
The Key-note
All have time to apply this one key-note of help
fulness, love, and human kindness if they so desire,
and will, when they discover and recognize who the
true dweller is within, and that love is the key wait
ing in palpitating silence for the divine urge.
When one opens this door he will discover that
which is a powerful chain that does not even end
when the earth ties are severed.
The duty of every soul is to be kind, for every true
impulse is engendered by divine love, and give a help
ful word of courage. Never let an opportunity pass.
Tell them the truth about what life really is ! Then
tell them not to break this chain of helpfulness for
each good deed is a priceless pearl in their crown
of life eternal, pass it on to others, and soon there
will be started such a golden chain of good purposes
that it will encircle the world with its strength and
power of loving service.
The writer met a lady only recently who had gone
through many Gethsemanes, losing her husband and
only son just five weeks apart; with many other
things that seemed to her such dire trials ; and was
to those without an understanding of God's wonder
ful plan. I spoke to her of life eternal and the as
surance that her loved ones still lived on, was near
her many times to comfort and cheer her in these

present hard experiences, giving her strength to go
on in the path she must tread alone. She expressed
joy at this thought, saying if this could be true ho/w
happy life could yet be. Then I told her to pass this
thought of spirit communion with the other helpful
things I gave to her on to others that it may be an
endless chain of helpfulness. She exclaimed in
astonishment and with credulity, she had never
thought of this wonderful method of thinking be
fore.
It is time for all who are in the light to reach those
in the shadows of uncertainty, to give what ever pos
sible, to those who are eager and ready for the truth,
the helpful message of life eternal.
Draw the curtain of doubt aside for them reveal
ing the convincing truth dressed in its rightful color.
The Key to The Esoteric Door
The esoteric door is ready to be opened to those
who are willing to recognize the correct door and
apply the proper key that unlocks the dormant
possibilities for there are endless doors and as many
keys to this great dormitory of the mind. Use the
key that says I AM, that I AM and Master of my own
destiny. I shall awaken the dormant children of my
mind to work for me, to do my bidding.
Here one gains more knowledge for the door of
greater possibilities will open. There-by discover
ing the key that is marked giving. But are you too
deeply engrossed in self, too self-centered, to make
use of it? One talks of God within, but do they who

have the key unlock the door that manifests Him in
outward expression of philanthropy?
These are the keys of the fullness of life, of joy—
sunshine —love and helpfulness. Then all who make
use of these, keeping them shining bright by
their daily usage are living in agreement with God's
Divine Truth, having discovered the key to the open
door of freedom and realization through service.
Key to Fulness of Life
Those having found this knowledge and used it have
discovered the key to the fullness of living happy,
helpful lives.
Pres. Wilson in an address before a large body of
notables in France once said, "Condescension is not
helpfulness. We must not condescend to help others,
that doesn't have the right touch of helpfulness about
it."
This is true because one must not stoop to help
others but realize that they stand on the same level
with yourself. That they are one with you, your broth
er, your sister, and that you are doing the kindness
from an equal standpoint. This makes them feel you
are on the same level with them and have the great
impulse to share with humanity.
Be a helper, that makes it seem just a natural con
sequence. Soul growth assists and gives to all the
key to accomplish this trait of due consideration and
furtherance of truth; for they recognize the univer
sal is the supreme intelligence of power—wisdom and
divine love, the eternal source of all.

beautified by its cultivation and sacrifice. Perfect in
its at-one-ment. The golden key then opens the door
of illumination from within, by the creative fires of
loving service through the divine law of love.
"Through loving service, great or small
One earns the master key—
That unlocks the door to the shrine within
Where treasured pearls of wisdom wait for thee."

CHAPTER IX
LESSON 9
MASTER CONSCIOUSNESS
"Mind is the master weaver of our destiny, the magic mould
er of character."
"What do I think of myself, is the question to ask daily. If
you are not satisfied with yourself it is never too late to remodel
your character."
To be master is to master self, then
learn to do your own thinking. Neith
er shunning duty, nor screening self
for fame's sake. For one with a mas
ter consciousness, cares not for the
seeming tinsel of today's glory that
is like a bobbing cork, on the surface
of the water, but rather is one who
sees beyond these illusions, on the
stream of life, to the glorious riches of
Spirit.
"No man is free, who is not master
of himself." —Claudius
A master mind judges not by what a man sees on
the surface, he knows through developed conscious
ness what a man is really within, this is all that
counts.
A broadcloth coat may hide a heart of sin and
shame, or a rough exterior a heart tender with love

and compassion for others. The loyal souls do not
accuse or condemn. Beware of those who revel in the
tearing apart the reputation of others. They may be
trying to cover up the guilt of their own heart of
secret sins .
In St. Luke, it tells us to strive to enter in at the
straight gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to
enter in and shall not be able, when once the Master
of the house is risen up he hath shut the door. Thus,
one should keep in the path of right thinking. Let not
negative thoughts control the mind if one does,
he is far from being a master, for once the Master
has control, then shut the door of thy mind1. Turn
the key in the lock, barring out these would be prow
lers.
"I Shall do My Own Thinking"
One should say to himself, "I have determined no
mind is strong enough to control or rule my think
ing, for I have full mastery over my every thought.
I shall do my own thinking. I control my own destiny.
Never be persuaded to listen and believe all that
someone, who comes to tear down another's character
says to you. It is your right to accept or reject their
story. Keep your own great mind, always in full
control with a master grip, seeing all and believing
the smallest portion. With a Master consciousness,
you learn to know Justice. The Master Jesus had
Justice well developed, for he knew who was true and
who was false. This is where "I and my Father are
one."
One should learn to detect and watch for the flashes

that cross the mind. Think not that they are of little
account. Thoughts from Master Minds are often
wafted to you upon the ether waves. Keep in readi
ness by attuning yourself to receive this kind of
thoughts.
Emerson says, "Abide by your spontaneous impres
sions with good humored inflexibility, else tomorrow
a stranger will say with Masterly good sense, precisely
what we have thought and felt all the time and we
shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion
from another."
Impressional souls know how true this is. Hearing
many times beautiful thoughts expressed almost in
exactness of their own thoughts they previously
have had, yet fearing to express them. These are the
beautiful thoughts or vioces we hear in quiet solitude.
This is one great need of visiting the silent sanctuary
often, that we may not miss the pearls that are for
us alone to share.
Live Your Own Life
Care not what others may think of you. Just know
what you want to do and must do concerns you alone,
not what others think is right for you. This is where
you become your own master, permit no one else to
live your life, because they think their opinion is bet
ter than your own.
Do your own thinking and grow masterful. Be
consistent in all you undertake. Scorn all eyes and
listen not to tongues, care only for greatness of char
acter. There never was a great masterful Soul that
was not at some time in his career misunderstood.

When one can reach the place where they care not
for criticism, they are traveling fast upon the road
leading to Mastership.
You are where you are through the thoughts built
daily into your character. The soul constantly attracts
that which it constantly is thinking of. Good thoughts
produce rich fruits of the spirit.
Law and) order are the predominating principles in
the universe; justice is its key-note. Use systematic
introspection and self analysis, then know you are
in the center of life, doing your best—trusting self—
accepting the place you are in graciously, conscious
you shall rise to greater heights still, that you know
your worth as a benefactor—a servant— a master—
reaching down—lifting up and smiling through all
the way. These souls have become conscious of their
true relationship to the divine spirit.
Only by diligent work is the pearl of truth found.
He who digs deepest finds the richest treasures, mold
ing and building his own destiny with an unerring
hand, for he that seeketh findeth and to him that
knocks it shall be opened.
A masterful achievement lies in the realization of
the maxim of Ainyahita:
Stand alone and mind thy own,
That alone will sin atone.
"Never permit the moth and rust" to enter the
portals of your mind. Put up a bulwark by strong
affirmations of truth, with beautiful thoughts that
gather to you sunshine that ripens the fruits of your
every effort.
"A good servant makes a good master and he that is greatest
among you, let him be the servant of all."

LESSON 10
THE LAW OF JUSTICE
Mercy is an attribute of God Himself; and earthly power
doth then show likest Gods when mercy seasons justice. —Shake
speare.
As a man's action such his fate;
Then justice shall be true and straight.
Aristotle
There is an unwritten law of justice and that is
"all must pay."
The law of compensation is the bal
ance wheel of justice. It is found in
-:. the fact every act rewards itself wheth-
." er it is good or bad, great or small.
Because you or I think we are sup
erior in rank or knowledge, that we
will be permitted to pass the judgment-
seat with all our faults and eccentri
cities unnoticed is a vast mistake. Jus
tice may be posponed for a time, how
ever a perfect balance time comes,
that is the administration of law ac
cording to the letter. For every one
is obliged to pay to the last farthing.
The law of justice must be unreservedly met. Justice

dollars and cents for usually it depends upon the bank
roll how much real justice one gets, whether innocent
or guilty.
Condemnation is usually the stock in trade of those
who are concealing something in their own lives of
which they are ashamed, trying to disguise in sheeps
clothing their real character.
A Sheep Skin Cloak
"God does not regard the laws of man. He cannot
be bought with silver nor gold. His price lies in the
heart of every one; the price is justice. A just bal
ance is a Divine fulfillment of the law. The fulfillment
of the law of justice.
There are scores of souls today hiding under the
cloak of innocence. We recall Aesop's fables retold
by Newkirk of the wolf in sheep's clothing. For one
discovers people prowling about today to consume or
destroy in this manner where e're they can, sowing
injustice on every hand. There are many such as these,
but what of the reaping time?
It will come soon or late the weighing in the balance
on the scales of justice. Out from memory's chest, I
will give to you the little poem, that you too may turn
back for a moment the pages of childhood memories,
where today you can see with clearer vision to read
between the lines and with acuteness of added years
be convinced of the definition of the law of cause and
effect? and as we sow so shall we also reap.
"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," seem to
be as a rule the world's standard of justice, although
it is hard to pray for those who despitefully use us,

love.
The Wolf
"A wolf who like others of his race,
Went hunting oft, unlucky in the chase,
Worked out a scheme he thought would be complete,
To give him every day enough to eat.
He made himself a sheepskin suit of clothes,
That covered him entirely, tail to nose;
And with a flock throughout the day he'd keep.
Deceiving both the shepherd and the sheep;
Then in the cote at night a lamb would kill,
And ere the dawn at pleasure eat his fill.
Ere long the shepherd felt the urgent need
Of meat, himself and family to feed;
Came in the night, all dark within the fold,
And on a sheep as he supposed laid hold.
But in the wolf instead was plunged the knife;
Now paying for his treachery with his life.

One of selfish, cruel mind;
Seeking others to deceive;
Just appearing to be kind,
Manners only make believe;
And in time it comes about,
People surely find him out.

Where God Reigns
Where God in justice reigns there is no need of a
sheep skin cloak to hide a selfish soul, there it will
stand forth supreme for the good shepherd who is the
Master consciousness He is ever at the gate to guide
thy thoughts with zealous care.

or perhaps to another, yet if the watchman of your
consciousness is asleep they may reach your mind and
possibly corrupt it.
St. John 10 :l-3. "Verily I say unto you he that en
ters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth
up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber,
but he that entereth by the door is the shepherd of the
sheep, to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear
his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and

In Revelations it tells us, Behold I have set before
thee an open door and no man can shut it. (This is the
door of divine justice.) Prejudice may be the King
today but tomorrow is dethroned by justice.

ment bar."
The great Judge is righteousness; for does it not
say the sheep will find their places on the right, the
goats on the left. Every man will know his place and
God will say, Come into your inheritance.
Justice is often regarded as the supreme virtue. For
the scales of divine justice weighs every one accurately
in the balance, according to the deeds of service ren
dered. Know then that the first law of God is justice;
the scales are balanced, by almighty God of love.

In Shakespeare's Revelations
O Justice with Thy scales unseen;
Unhanded seeing eyes;
Invisibly doth each act weigh,
In the immortal skies;
As thou hast made the dust of man
To cover spirit sight.
So hast Thou, in Thy hidden plane,
A balance true and right.
To see man's past writ on a scroll.
Unfolded, balanced, plain.
This is the hell that wisdom planned,
The soul-s undying pain.

CHAPTER XI
LESSON 11
FREEDOM
One that has fought for independence, knows what
freedom means.
Freedom is found when the prepon
derant stone of doubt is rolled away
from the sepulchral mind permitting it
to go free, although this freedom is
not found through earth or sky or seas
but through a resurrecting or renew
ing of the mind, discarding the old
grave clothes of superstitions and worn
out ideas of the past.
Discovering from the throne of thy
own consciousness comes the independ
ent right and possession of free
thought with freedom, dominion and
supreme authority over the soul's actions knowing in
God's great Universal Kingdom no carnal rubbish or
silt must enter.
The Soul must be cleansed by purity of thought
and right living, where one is washed in the living
streams of God's wisdom and purity, that is being
cleansed, not by the sacrificing of blood but a changed
mind, converted and renewed, not by the vicarious
attonement, for shedding of another's blood cannot
possibly save you from sin, but though walking in the

footsteps of the Man of Galilee, this pattern he left is
one of sacrifice and service.
Practice regeneration through change of thought.
This changes conditions, bringing into manifestation
and knowledge, that all depends entirely on self alone
and the method of thinking whether you are good or
bad.
It is cowardice to call upon Jesus to save. Go to
work, think right then you will live right. The right
kind of thoughts give freedom from the shackles of
enslavement.
Oh, that we might be privileged to tell the masses
of humanity and have the prerogative to help all to
know what kind of work is necessary to produce re
sults.
Divine Force
Divine force cannot be surpassed, it speaks for
itself freedom. It has the ability to inspire courage
and confidence, dispelling fears and bringing into ex
pression one's own natural powers and is a welcome
guest of victory well earned on freedom's throne by
the path of patient determination to the heights of
magnificent achievement.
One feels as a Bondsman or gallie slave would
when the freedom one has long sought is found and the
moss-covered stone has rolled away breaking the
chains of old worn out ideas to come into a new king
dom, a new discovery of power all their own. And
that thought is power this is the greatest discovery—
its possibilities are unlimited —it sets one free—open

ing the flood gates that have long been locked by
superstition and fear.
Today all can be free but one must learn the law
how to unlock the door permitting freedom of the
unlimited possibilities. No imagination can portray
what freedom man and his world will accomplish
after a century more of the conscious use of thought
forces which are all powerful, yet so easily controlled
when living in agreement and in harmony with Divine
Law. It gives you freedom, awakens thought—kindles
the fires of tenderest emotions —it binds with loving
unity the universe through its limitless distance of
space.
The rounded world is fair to see.
Nine times folded in mystery:
Though baffled seers cannot impart
The secret of its labored heart.

CHAPTER XII
LESSON 12
OLD TRADITIONS
Freedom of thought redeems the world from old traditions
and conditions.
"Thought takes man out of servitude into Freedom.'*
Emerson
It is limitation of thought that
causes so much human ignorance, dis
tress and fear. The world is now
gradually awakening to the truth;
they are learning to control the
machinery of the mind by controlling
thought. This lights the way out of
bondage into freedom.
Through proper use of thought
force it takes one from bondage and
poverty to independence and freedom.
The public in general were astonish
ed and doubted Emerson when he
wrote, "Thought rules the world." But time alone
proves all things, this is now proven, showing from out
the darkness comes forth freedom of understanding.
Without the shadows one would not appreciate the
sunshine ; therefore the world appears to be pretty well
equalized between shadows and sunshine, make room

for more light, be looking upward and; onward in thy
consciousness, giving less and less room for the un-
welcomed shadows to enter.
Dr. J. M. Peebles has said, "Every winter has its
Spring; under the ice the crystal waters run; above
the clouds the sun in splendor shines; after darkness
and dews of night the spring-buds drip and glitter
with diamonds, be of good cheer then brothers and
sisters all, it is better, far better further on.
The tide of God's immortal truth.
Climbs up and on forever,
Could we but pierce the rolling storms
That veil the pathway sunward,
We'd see a host of angels forms
Forever beckoning onward.
In Shakespeare's Revelations, he says of freedom,
"Spirit has many joys unknown to mortals. Absolute
freedom is perhaps the greatest of these. The phrase
in itself cannot be realized by mortals so interdepen
dent are they. To know no need, no desire, which
cannot be supplied through prayer; to know no afflic
tion it cannot lay down, if it will; to owe nothing, to
have to pay nothing more, except to its maker —these
are some of the minor glories of a spirit in the realm
of Spirit."
Does not this freedom speak of real contentment
and joy. One should watch his thoughts in earth life
that they do not make a stone wall or prison to bar
the way to future bliss. Then joy and freedom will
be the culmination and climax to this new experience
rising above the shackles of earth, content and happy
in the unlimited scope to soar to realms of hitherto
unknown bliss. Shakespeare said, "There is nothing
good or bad, but thinking makes it so."

Roll the stone of doubt and fear aside;
Let Christ within thee, abide.
Barring the door, against sorrows, or anxiety:
Prepare thy soul lamp, to light thy path, —thro' eternity
Peace within thee dwells —not doubt, nor grief shall be.
For sorrows live alone —thou needes't not grieve.
A light dawns —all mystery can be solved;
Freedom speaks —dispelling doubts and unbeliefs.
The stone can now be rolled—far away.
The load grows lighter,—day by day.
Gradually we've pushed aside worn out creeds;
Revealing God within —'tis all we need.
Deliverance is here no church can save
No creeds dictate, nor pave the way;
For any soul, they alone —must mould their life—
By righteousness, —and loving sacrifice.
Roll the stone aside, the best you can;
Being and doing, is the workings of God's plan.
And every human soul is a part—look up— lift up;
Roll away the heavy load that mantles the heart.
Let all share in humanity's call;
Giving relief and comfort—listen to your inner call.
The Master speaks, hear the mandate echo— ring out above;
'Tis like sweetest music —give humanity love.
The stone will then forever—roll aside;
Within your life—God will constantly abide.
In forgiving all—loving all—you'll find realization;
For all humanity—having deep compassion;
Hark—a freeman speaks —I now understand;
In earth nor sky, nor outward thing, doth the Master dwell;
But within I've found—"The I AM."
This voice speaks peace to my soul —all is well:
The stone of doubt rolls from thy sight;
Cease thy wonderings—Oh child of the night;
The Master speaks within thee—'tis a new day;
Listen to that voice —listen I pray;
Heed not the clanging, of the outer night;
Look up, rejoice—see the illumined light.
Comes from without thy soul —listen until—
In the silence —you'll hear —like strains of sweetest music
swell;;
"Tis the Master speaks —peace be still—all is well.

LESSON 13
THINKING AND DOING
"There'a nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it «o."
—Shakespeare.
Every one today who thinks at all
constructively knows how true this
is. (A master thinker masters condi-
tions.) If those who permit themselves
to be wounded by a sharp and cut
ting remark are not master of circum
stances. Turn the key in the lock,
barring the door against hurts of that
sort rising above the wound and grief
it could cause, is slipping a notch up
ward on the span of life. We are
over-cotming on the road of life's re
buffs and are becoming master of
forgiving and forgetting.
The greatest aim in one's life should be, how can
I make the world better, safer and happier; this
comes through discovering one's own great possi
bilities and the scientific use of thought forces ; this
knowledge authoritively teaches a true method of
procedure. Then the world will be far better for
our having lived in it. Thus becoming a constant
reflector of divine light and a benefactor to human
ity.

Seeing—then doing the work that should be done;
stand not idly by with folded hands and serenely
wait, or for opportunities to come to you or for others
to do the work that is yours to do.
Thou know' est not the day no'r hour when the
silent messenger may come. Then will we be called
upon to give an account of wasted opportunities.
Have we conscientiously thought this important ques
tion over? Are we quite sure no time has been squan
dered in idleness? And equally as sure we have done
everything we could for those less fortunate? How
many hours have we really spent in loving service; or
in other words how much of the master's business have
we finished? These are serious questions to ask
one's self just now.
Today begin thy labor anew, in the master's vine
yard. As you give so shall ye receive.
You will be provided for when God's watchful
eye knows even the sparrow's fall.
Harken then to the cry—lend a helping hand.
Love, teach, heal and pray,
For the Master calls you today —
Something can'st thou do?
Well thou know' est I
If to the inner consciousness —be true.

EACH PASSING HOUR
Generosity is found in the soul who has climbed high on the
rugged road of experience.

Every passing hour brings a special
opportunity and privilege. Make life
r1=ii=^gigrXv- a glad activity—do the thing that

presents itself now if it is very min-
ute. One then becomes more capa
ble of mastering greater things. There
will always be more wonderful things
on ahead to be mastered.
The time will never come when we
know and understand all things.
God's infinite plan is too wondrous.
Might we not get busy and explore
it while we are able with the present
light on the path? Greater illumination comes as
further we climb onward and upward in Christ con
sciousness; to unspeakable peace and freedom.
Many miss the little things to be done for others ,
in their search for the greater things that perhaps
never comes; for remember the beginning of small
undertakings means the consummation of the great
er: "The great oak tree from an acorn grew." Sow
the seeds of usefulness today that in the future
there will be a monument of service to your credit.

"We are always dropping the fruits of knowledge,
we could not keep it to our self alone, it speaks
though we are silent."
Deal Generously
The more we get out of life, the more we should
constantly and willingly put into it; for by cheerfully
giving, your reward is rich fruits of the spirit. If
you have knowledge permit others to light their can
dles by it. Thus do you keep your own spiritual lamp
trimmed and constantly burning with a rich glow,
filled with the oil of goodness, helpfulness and love
toward those less fortunate.
"Be self-sacrificing and generous with those in
your own home surroundings. Then deal generously
and justly with others out side of that home. You
will then be sure to discover not only happiness for
your self but a greater satisfaction in the thought,
I have contributed to others as I should like to be
dealt-by."
Try to see good in others. Be not a criticizer, a
faultfinder. Ere one knows it, they may be adver
tising their own greatest fault and the one people
hate to hear most."
Try looking on the bright side of life and smile.
It's about the only thing without a cost but the
brightest thing worth while.
Try bidding your soul to admit only constructive,
helpful thoughts of health, strength —power is mine
—my own will come to me. / am Success.

"Try cultivating a cheerful disposition, make your
life worth while. What if your face is filled with
wrinkles, if they are caused by smiling."
Borrow not trouble, nor pine o'er things as they seem;
Walk onward with head erect facing the taunting stream;
With no backward regrets for things past and gone;
Just promise self to press on in this new era of each coming new
day,
With something accomplished just a little better than the yester
day.
With true resolve and undaunted courage then
you will discover a successful finished goal rounded
out in faith triumphant, in loving service given, —
obligations filled—on to a blessed and victorious
triumph.
For only then can thy own great soul have power
to press on and compete with all trials and obstacles
on life's rugged pathway. Thus living thy life the
best you can, singing thy own song of victory to
music from the spheres ; like glorious symphonies from
God's great universe.
Then you are becoming a master magician of the
art, cultivating thy own rare flower garden of at-one-
ment; where it will bloom throughout all time a
memorial of victory gained.
This great honor given comes to one for a life lived
well ; by copying from the perfect pattern left by
the loving master Jesus. For he said these things
I do ye can do, when living in correct obedience to
the natural laws of God and life, will all truly find
the law of compensation working perfectly.
A truly great soul is he who has faced many a

without a murmur, —discovered seeming friends

forgives you and so do I, they are on the road toward

Small minds have little room for generosity. Their
soul growth is stunted. Students of psychology must
assist these to broaden their concept of life. They
judge from their narrow vision the world's greatest

LESSON 15
A CLEAN PASSPORT
"It Takes You All The Way"
"To rightfully understand the Infinite, we must be real sure
of the Infinite within first."
"in the history of the human race we can readily trace the
divine law of progress."
What constitutes a clean noble
character?
It is to live in the great store house
with Infinite power. Practice living
in the upper chamber of thy being,
then on faithfully executing your
duties, there will be gold bricks plac
ed in thy structure house, for every
act will be there, perfected by love and
service to humanity.
If it is true we can be what we
want to be, every one who desires to
become a power for good should begin
to build a concrete character by daily constructive
thinking, constantly adding to the building with its
foundation of truth, a fortress of strength, —a for
tification of power, of knowledge, soul quickening,
expansion and plenteousness.
Too many build one day, tearing down the next, by
either thoughts or deeds. These lack poise and con

centration of though force. To be a constructor of
character building one is obliged to have strong powers
of endurance. Hold fast to that which is good, turn
the key in the lock against distinctive negative
thoughts.
Here is one of the simplest receipts: See- no evil,
hear no evil, speak no evil—adhere to principles of
brotherly love, charity and mutual aid. In other
words follow the golden rule. Then will you live
happy, contented, useful lives. One can never be a fail
ure if abiding by this formula which is God's
This method will build the fortress of protection,
but how many forget this indispensible part of the
foundation of truth.
Begin and be deaf, dumb and blind to every evil,
for when negative thoughts are given out they never
lose by telling and nothing but inharmony is gained.
Be unyielding when once sure of the truth.
Emerson said, "Don't bark against the bad but chant
the beauties of the good."
"Blame no one for their short comings either in
thought or word, for they are of God and should! be
dealt with as thy own self."
"Enter often the silence, this is the gateway to
divine consciousness where the mirror reflects the
divine in every soul (on the path).
When my bark unmoores for sea,
Will there be sufficient light for me?
With God's illumined rays along your path —
And faith your guiding star,
You'll sail on and on o'er crystal seas
With profound joys awaiting thee.

If desire is sufficiently implanted within the con
sciousness to do right then one has his own passport
to sail on to the land of promise.
Not a heaven where one is supposed to sing psalms
and play upon a harp throughout eternity. This
would be a dreary Heaven to those who are not gifted
in either art. But a place where your desires may be
gratified; providing you had worked out through
service upon the earth plane sufficient to be deserving
of these privileges now.
Dr. W. C. Biting of St. Louis, in addressing Univer
sity students once said, The world is good enough for
me. I do not want to go to Heaven. I had rather
be here today than be in Heaven. It is not Heaven
to me, either to thump on a harp or wear a heavy
crown and attend eternal prayer meetings. Most of
those meetings we have today are bad enough.
He evidently did not realize he need not die to be in
Heaven. This is the mistake the greater portion of
the people make today. God's passport is from earth
to the spheres above; for all the way to Heaven is
Heaven for unless you have it here you will not find
it there. It is bought and paid for through char
acter.
If strung upon thy heart
A cloak around thy soul;
Oh consistency "Thou art a jewel rare"
Its stability co-exists with
Thy great character—
The Shining goal.

LESSON 16
TO SWIM LIFE'S CHANNEL IN SAFETY
"Everything that is really worth while has its annoy
ances. Like labels they have their attachments. To receive the
crown, is to carry thy cross with a smile.
Out on the streams of time are
constantly floating the millions of
souls.
Up or down the stream humanity
are continuously going- ; more seeming
ly going down stream, because of its
apparent easy progress, yet the ma
jority are struggling for supremacy,
—power,—advancement for self in
some form or other. But all are
struggling for existence, the majority
are discovering a very hard task be
fore them. While the fewer going up
stream have greater resistance to battle against; yet
do they find joy in their labor because right is might
and they press on at last mastering conditions, after
mastering self. Thus do they find peace and rest at the
end of another period, stepping out of their life boat
that served them, upon the sands of an infinite sea.

Summit of Human Evolution
Those who discover the shortest road to the height
of mastership are those who are lead on by the master
minds who have already reached the summit of human
evolution, rough and rugged though it may be there
are a few who do find this great summit.
Jesus the Christ was pure and holy and achieved
Mastership, and as truth loving souls we are swimming
the channel of life reaching out for this supreme goal
of light and wisdom on the path of evolution. Unify
ing self with universal mind, the all pervading spirit.
It is well known there are many constantly endeavor
ing to persuade others in seeking this channel of power,
or to pilot them as far on the road as they have gone,
to show them the light and the way. Some are heeding
the call while others preferring to go on down the
stream of less resistance, not interested in self advance

prefer an easier way, trying to hypnotize themselves
that it is the best way.

OF POWER

easiest way, to be the best way in any

It is those who give service, who
at last discover the Aladdin lamp.
While those who float with the mental
sewerage down the stream, forgetting
or neglecting to help others about them are selfish,
miserable, souls torn to pieces by unhappy vibrations,
caused by disagreeable environments and negative
thinking.
It is far more profitable to struggle if they must up

with Christ's teachings. For here is discovered

absolute contentment of mind, with a soul alight with
the promise and daily assurance of "Come unto me all
ye that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you
rest."
This is sweetest music, to the tired soul who is
swimming life's channel and reaching out with a soul
yearning toward the promised land—the Kingdom of
safety.
Santa Catalina Channel
Those who were first to reach the main land in the
Santa Catalina swim as well as those who did not suc
ceed in reaching the promised goal, were spurred on to
greater effort when glimpsing the main land with its
shining search lights to guide and direct them, and
the great beacon from the lighthouse tower sending
out its promising rays, giving greater courage to swim
on risking life and limb for the promised reward.
There were two incentives to swim on, one the honor
of being the first to swim across that great distance of
water, the other was the gold that would enable them
to be more independent, to have the things they had
always longed1 for, and with this reward could be
gratified.
The students of truth who are in the initial stage
are glimpsing the main land, the great light of this
new dispensation, for through their own dynamic
force they are given the urge to labor on.
To serve where service is needed, that there will
be a pure outlet of giving, thus an open channel for
receiving universal good and quickening power.

For those who lose courage or give up and stop
swimming will go to the depths in the surge of the
great mental sea of unrest and despair.
"Go to the full depths of God's great promises; there
alone is discovered the life boat of courage, trust,
faith and divine love, for these are the initiative and
foundation stones of the great lighthouse of divine
wisdom, standing before each initiate who would start
out to swim the great channel of life's ocean."
The Life Line
This is the life line, the incentive that keeps one
afloat; bids him constantly to hope on. (In a previous
volume "Inspiration and its Precepts) I have told you ;
when hope is deal life becomes a shallow mockery.
The fires of hope must never die out, for this is the
life saver that keeps one afloat, glimpsing the shores
of this infinite sea.
One finds it is constantly a swim. The majority
of this great ocean of humanity are about you reaching
out in their distress and ignorance for comfort and
courage.
Remember you are obliged to save self first; then
throw to them the life line; for self preservation is
the first law of life. This is not selfishness it is only
just to yourself. Climb into your own life boat and
receive positive assurance of your own safety, then
are you strong and capable to throw out the life line
of hope and rescue other weary and storm tossed
souls form the depths of degradation and despair.

Discrimination
One can observe or mark the difference between
streams and rivers by the names given them, all hav
ing their source in different places; yet do they finally
mingle their waters in the one great ocean.
Similarly the different paths of man take different
courses. However divergent they appear. Following
through straight paths to pastures fertile with rich
promise, through following their own highest light;
while others travel the downward and crooked path
way of seelming destruction.
Go Out on Your Observation Train
Stop for a moment, and go out on your observation
train. You will discover in God's own good time, that
soon or late by the route of evolution's train, looking
deep into the soul's mirror, eventually it all leads to
God; for through the opening of the mystic door you
perceive the truth whereby you see to walk in Jesus'
steps.
Listen to the human beatings of the tide of the infinite sea;
Bearing upon its stormy restless waves humanity—
Crying to you and to me, too throw to them the life line,
That will land them safely, to the shining shores;
Of the promised land in safety.

CHAPTER XVIII
LESSON 18
BE THE PILOT OF YOUR OWN DESTINY
"Do not keep constructive thoughts in the steerage; Per
mit them to sail out on life's great ocean where they will benefit
You need not drift down stream
with the human tide, you can become
your own great pilot of your destiny.
Arouse the dormant faculties of your
brain, they are as sleeping pirates;
put them to work by constructive
thinking.
One is obliged to become an expert
pilot before he can steer his own
great ship of life into a harbor of
safety. It takes more than one short
earth life in practice to become even
in part qualified and some it will take
perhaps ages to become a master chaftsman of the
art.
The great captain of your ship of life requires a
great degree of service toward those less fortunate
and an unusual degree of skill is needed to handle
them with an understanding heart.
God is good—he does not permit us to see tomor
row's storms, that we are to meet out upon life's
other souls.

it remains that mystical something which lies beyond
the present scope of vision.
If many souls saw the open book of the future,
or knew of their transition period they would not
have courage to go onward and face their own Geth-
semanes, carrying their own crosses. In God's
loving mercy this He conceals.
The thing that must be visioned is preparedness
for this "some day" that never fails to come to all ;
the invitation from this silent visitor one is seldom
if ever ready to meet on his arrival.
One can prepare himself, through the understand
ing of divine law to encounter what ever lies before
with a brave heart, living each day by faith in the
power to overcome the many obstacles on the temp
est beaten shore as tomorrow dawns nor be crushed
by the storms however fierce they may beat against
thy tender soul; then with hope and love sail on and
conquer destiny.
A LIFE OF REGENERATION
When one lives a life of regeneration and divine
love has wrapt them in its protecting embrace;
then it is like sweetest music, to the soul attuned to
the harmonies of the spheres, to know that the great
forghorn of spiritual understanding and knowledge
of the awakened truth will keep blowing away the
mists of doubt, old fears and superstitions of a
wrathful and revengful God; sounding the voice of
faith and courage o'er the troubled waters.

The deck of your ship of life is swept clean by
the sunlight of a God of love. Here mercy and for
giveness with fraternal love is found for the heart
of man and the harbor of understanding is eventu
ally reached.
Though the voyage may appear to be long, rough
and toilsome, or fraught with its various experiences
of doubts and fears; or tossed oe'r the stormy waves
of creed bound shores and dogmas ! Do they at the
final stage listen in and trust the one experienced
pilot of the God within which daily and hourly so
licits and inspires confidence, faith and courage to
press on to the finishing goal reflecting divine truth.
This all comes to the developed soul in Christ
consciousness; for when the lighthouse of divine
wisdom is eventually reached, then the mystical key
is turned in the lock, opening the esoteric door to
the treasure house of marvelous possibilities of
power.
A new day is dawning, its rays are already pene
trating the universe with greater desires to forge
ahead into new fields of scientific research. To
discover truth first hand. It is like a new song sung
to sweet music.
For floating out to the great sea of humanity goes
forth the message ; there is no death, all is beautiful
life eternal, when living the regenerated life of lov
ing service for God and humanity, then the home
coming will be one of rejoicing.

Resurrection
We are being daily resurrected; out from super
stitions and conventionalism into the glorious reality
and freedom of a new existence. Discovering that
it is a scientifically proven fact that life is eternal
progression, and it is our thoughts, and them alone,
that carry us onward and upward cementing the
foundation for spiritual freedom.
What splendid news this is to the millions of
doubting storm-tossed souls, to discover that it is a
scientifically proven fact; that life does not end
with the vacating of the physical form ; but sails on,
and on, in its quest for greater possibilities. Reali
zing by the simple method of changing thoughts they
can substitute good for evil, altering an otherwise
humdrum life for a constructive one.
Be sure to tie a firm knot upon the end of the life
line that it may not slip through your hands or be
yond into an abyss, until you have become master of
self, thereby mastering circumstances. This.- is all
accomplished through becoming the captain and
controller of your every thought; thereby controlling
your own destiny.
The masts and rudders still bend and creak, for
the majority of humanity still groan under the
storms of life's uncertainties; with the seeming
mysteries that surround transition, although they are
fast learning that it is only the stepping out of the
old, into the newer life eternal.
Those who have the knowledge of the divine laws
of God, have the true definition of this life's exist

shores. These have become the pilot of their own
destiny. Thus are they prepared to guide the strug
gling doubting freighted ship of humanity's cargo
into the harbor of safety.
This superlative power diffuses its divine radiance
of wisdom out from the centre to circumferance ;
points the way toward life's eternal shores; where
storm-tossed souls can discover through its divine
guidance the loving pilot, that God within is direct
ing their life even unto the shores of the infinite sea.
The storms that daily sweep o'er life's sea are the
needed experiences, trials and sorrows that are
necessary for life's lessons; many times they are
numerous and severe, all depending on soul advance
ment. When gaining the aquired knowledge pa
tiently and understandingly ; they will readily dis
cover on stepping out upon the shores of the next
port; their soul refined and beautiful, sparkling and
fresh as a flower after a night's dew.
Then glistening and pure as a sea of glass will the
soul be transformed and radiant, reflecting the per
sonification of God's great radiant light forever.

SAIL ON AND ON! WITH GOD
THE PILOT
"Truth may be stretched but cannot be broken, and always
gets above falsehood, as oil does above water." —Cervantes.
A person without the understanding of the laws
of nature, —or laws of God, is like a ship without
a pilot at the wheel. He is tossed about on the sea
of life without a rudder, with no compass, or knowl
edge of the great creative power waiting for expres
sion from within that is fully competent to steer the
ship of life into a harbor of safety.
Every one is capable of becoming the captain of
his ship and of mastering it with the strong hand of
an experienced seaman ; if he is willing to stop in the
mad rush long enough to ask himself this question —
whither am I going and why? Then ask for divine
love to aid you in the adjusting of all your affairs,
and the solving of your various daily problems. Di
rectly comes the bursting of the sunshine o'er
troubled waters and thy ship of life sails smoothly
on and on o'er life's sea.
God invites you, He says, Come to me with an
understanding heart and walk hand in hand solv
ing the workings of the divine law of love, this law
of nature will never fail you, in storms or sunshine
it is ever the same. With this anchorage, enlight
ened souls will never put out to sea in a storm. They
wait for that calmness that comes only to those who
know poise and rhythm with calm demeanor; this

and on in the glories of this new awakening that
God invites you to share with Him.
Human Tide
Powerful and relentless is the tide of the infinite sea.
Carrying upon its bosom, the throng of humanity.
All have the same chance; to conquer fate and tide:
All finding the same God, to love and walk beside.
BE THE PILOT OF YOUR DESTINY
When the Storms Break
"When the storm breaks is when the pilot's skill is always proven.
In calm he usually enters the port unnoticed."
* * *
All rivers run into one sea, yet the sea is not full. Upon
the place whence the rivers come thither they return again.
Ecclesiastes.
The great ocean is made up of drops of water and
grains of sand; each equally important to it. In
like degree is the soul that gives out a truth, though
it may be very minnute, still it is equally momentous
for the seed of truth sown, will in time grow into
great helpfulness. Thus do we all constantly assist
in God's great and wondrous plan of love and service.
James 4 :4. Whereas ye know not what shall be

LESSON 19
BARNACLES OF INHARMONY
"Name that day your best when you have conquered hate,
prejudice, malice and jealously."
Shake off the shackles that have a
tendency to bind that is, the counter
part of fear, discord, malice. To break
these shackles is to be free to live in
peace and harmony with self and home
surroundings and with all souls every
where.
Get out of inharmonious vibrations
for as sure as life is, they produce
illness, sorrow and misery.
Disrupt the barnacles of supersti
tion and fear so inclined to cling and
grow, in similarity to the barnacles
that gradually weigh down a great liner in mid ocean.
They cling to her hull until at times they have to be
torn off before the ship can proceed upon its journey.
Make the voyage on life's great ocean smooth sailing
by doing duty to the best of your ability. This will
help to make life's voyage smooth and successful.
Give no barnacles an opportunity to weigh you down
or get you in their grip. Sail on, never think of drop
ping anchor, no difference how rough life's seas appear,
for when one's vision becomes clearer ; comprehending

path of Divine Light, living upon the upper deck —vi
brating in harmony with the super-conscious mind—
the mind of God.
When coming in contact with other passengers de
sirous of seeking the safest voyage to the land of
promise, to become seekers of truth, pilot them by the
light and fruitage of your own great understanding
soul. Guide them by the compass that never faileth,
it points out the surest route to the way of truth, peace
and life eternal.
Though I walk through the valley and the shadow, I

With this promise and the God of love within the soul,
no sickness or harm can molest —"For he giveth his
angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways."—
91 Psalm.
Affirm, "/ now have within me an indwelling force
and power that never faileth. It keeps the compass of
my Soul pointing toward the lighthouse of Divine Truth
and love supreme, wherein lies an inexhaustible supply
of health and love, peaceful harmony and plenty await
ing my recognition. New life is shining forth from my
watch tower, where every fiber of my being is in per-
fact rhythm, vibrating to the sweet harmonies of the
spheres."
Sail on, great soul, through storm and din
God's great love surroundeth thee—
You're sure to win.

LESSON 20
ARE YOU A CAMOUFLAGE
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High,
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 9 1 Psalm.
Behold the serpent's guile how
subtle, how beautiful, yet so vile and
poisoness —self-deceiving in its splen
dor and opalescent tints —lurking in
unfrequented places, he strikes his
innocent victims, then rushes under
cover. Its beautiful glossy coat hides
its poisoness sting.
Like the reptile with its camouflage,
poor deluded souls think they elude
detection. They may for a time con
ceal from the physical sight—still the
all-seeing eye of God and the spirit
forces have the clear cognizant piercing sight, seeing
through the thickest cloak of deception.
This search-light is constantly playing upon every
thought, action or deed. To their sight is unfolded
every duty or obligation done or left undone.
Business associates or acquaintances may be fooled
by a camouflage for a time but the consciousness, the
still inner voice ever whispers its accusations.

Many listen before they have gone far, others will
not heed until running the line of gauntlet with a
ruined character, perhaps causing many heads to bow
in sorrow and shame for their reckless, lawless living.
Know the all seeing eye of God, the great and noble
Masters and forces from the spheres, wish for the
advancement of the earth children always and are
saddened when the blotch appears upon the negative
plate that constantly registers or photographs every
act, every thought.
Form New Habits
Being wise is wiping from the slate old conditions,
commencing a new record with new resolutions, form
ing a new habit of procedure. Fighting a new battle
against all odds, placing into motion new machinery
of the mind, new forces, new thoughts that will create
new vibrations, bringing into action new and far bet
ter conditions. This is regeneration produced by
change of thoughts, thus changing vibrations.
Forget misunderstandings- and mistakes. Leave
them behind you. They were lessons on life's slate
to be erased now, they were experiences needed for soul
growth but now forget them.
Then the test of the forces that regulate the search
light will make no mistake. Analyze the problems that
you meet on your path, "watch for camouflage in
others but your own actions first." One well develop
ed in soul intuition will know the true from the false.
One is apt to stumble many times, over boulders at
their very feet in their haste on watching the top of
a mountain they have started to climb, they forget to

path in their anxiety to reach the summit. A student
on stumbling over problems then analyzing afterward,
in all probability will not need to repeat the occurrence.
Watch thy steps. Go slow, the slow growth is the
strong hardy one. Spiritual unfoldment is like riches
that come quickly, one is apt to make mistakes in
using it.
Study the natural laws and when a spiritual gift
is your birthright appreciate it by using it for th?
good of humanity. No matter who may criticise, you
are working for God and not for man.
On analyzing of the laws of life it is discovered
one is a pathfinder on humanity's mountain trail, to
guide footsore travelers along truth's pathway onward
and upward, evolving through service.
The star of hope will shine bringing encouragement
all the way; for the sparkling, refreshing waters of
divine truth greet all who climb toward this summit.
Those living the real regenerated life, are cleansed
and purified by the divine fires of loving service, do
ing the things the Master left to be done, going about
doing good for this takes in all things. It sounds
simple enough but who today are actually following
in his steps. Are we doing our best?
Those who are need no camouflage. Their life is
a reflection of the great teacher of Nazareth and can
readily bear the sharp scrutiny of the X-ray.
Their character shines forth in their countenance
and happiness and contentment, with the torch of
loving service lights the way for them unto the shin
ing shores of the celestial city of God.

A Life of Sacrifice
The life that shows sacrifice through service for
others will find a joyous welcome awaiting its pos
sessor in spirit realms for through constructive think
ing, united with love and service it will create in ad
vance a palace that surpasses any made by material
means.
John 1:4: In my Father's house are many man
sions—they are many and various for every soul is
constantly creating its own in agreement with their
mode of thinking. All are creating either mansions
or hovels.
Yesterday and tomorrow are as sleeping pirates,
let them there lie. Sufficient unto the day is the good
or evil thereof. Do well this day the task you have
before you. Tomorrow will never fail to bring its
own obligatory service to you.
One can masquerade, or camouflage before others
for a time; but that still small voice of God within is
smouldering, and if given an opportunity, will blaze
forth in an eternal glow.
This is the illumined light, that must walk by your
side to guide and solve life's problems. "When by
passing clouds you become oppressed seek the inner
sanctuary, the silence, turn the key in the lock and
commune with the Father there to find peace and com
fort."
Send out your bark,
Far o're humanity's Sea;
Laden with loving thoughts:
They'll come floating back to thee.

LESSON 21
NEAR SIGHTEDNESS
"Be eure you are right then go ahead. You can't be bother
ed with other peoples opinions."
The agitation, distress and worry
that so many people today apparently
have, is from their lack of interest in
progressive ideas in the knowledge of
life here and here after, saying they
cannot be bothered, or have not the
time. They perfer to travel along on the
narrow gage road of existence all
through life. Through their near
sightedness, they are living a cramped
and dwarfed existence.
Therefore these posses a dwarfed
and cramped mentality. Becoming
more so as they choose to travel on in this manner, in
no degree are they endeavoring to obtain knowledge
of what lies beyond. Not careing to look beyond the
bend in the road to see where their train of thoughts
is leading them.
They somewhat resemble the story I once heard
told of two men, both of whom were most horribly
and fantastically ornamented with cross-eyes, who met

off and surveyed the other in a hostile manner through

This reminds one of the old saying "Look before
you leap." Reason out the great solutions of life, an-
alize if you can the wherefore and whence and then
you will not take the leap in the dark or run upon an
obstacle as the two unfortunate cross-eyed men did.
The Jazz world is going on in such a mad pace they
care not to bother or think where they are going, until
some calamity befalls them in some manner or some
grave mistake is committed. Then they know not
which way to turn, nor to whom. For they have neg
lected God so long, they feel ashamed now to approach
him. When trials come the tears of anguish and cries
of pain go out with a distress signal to the all su
preme Father for help and strength, it is not denied.
If one stays away from the great Spirit, forgetting
him in prosperity, or in surface pleasures yet does one
know the perfect love that is pledged prompting this
divine omnipresent Father to still love and keep sight
of the wayward and careless soul, never forgetting
nor wavering from the child that still belongs to him.
When perils come and persecutions are hard to bear
shall they go to him again and again? Yes, for the
knowing, loving Father never forgets neither does
he forsake thee—have faith—according to thy faith

tecting embrace and thou art satisfied—"but we are
not to serve God through compulsion but through
choice.
One may make countless mistakes, nevertheless
these experiences are usually stepping stones leading
to progression and purification, onward to the heights
of spiritual attainment if they will but listen for the
signals.
On reaching a successful termination through hard
earned efforts there is a satisfying realization of ones
own power to accomplish greater things.
Some are real helpers and firm believers—others are
destroyers, weaklings. These must be taught the
truth where they can profit by the results of right
thinking, then will they too see how to live construct
ively.
"Development does not take place
From without to within,
But the exact opposite,
Turn the search light within
There to find the defects and remedy them."

LESSON 22
SERENITY
"As we grow older in years, we grow riper in experiences,
richer in knowledge and righteous judgment."
• » »
"Serene, I fold my hands and wait,
Nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea,
1 rave no more 'gainst time or fate,
For lo: my own shall come to me."—Burroughs
There is philosophy in his lines,

and never rave 'gainst seeming fate,
"
just put thy shoulder to the wheel and
push, then thy own will come to thee.
Many wait for an imaginary judg
ment day, for Gabriel to blow his horn
and the grave to give up its dead. Then
a revengeful God judges all; sending
some to Heaven, others to hell. Those
who are studying the true philosophy
of life today are fast discovering the
real truth of life, and that once de
plorable day is fast disappearing, leaving in its place
a God of loving justice and tender mercy.
You are Your Own Great Judge
Every one eventually will discover he is his own
judge, and every day is a judgment day. Then when

stepping across the border line, there they discover
still they are their own Judge. This final decision
places them in their rightful place; for there con
science is their guide.
Serenity in all of life's journey, be it long or short,
is a wonderful trait to possess, for with it as their
boon companion on life's pilgrimage, one will be bless
ed1 with equanimity of temper, calm and unruffled
within, however hard the storms may rage without.
This is where the "magic staff" should constantly be
demonstrated. "Under all circumstances, keep an even
Mind."—A. J. Davis.
With the majority of the younger generation at
least, serenity appears today to be something of a lost
art. If you speak of serenely folding their hands, to
be still and calm the inner storms, immediately they
say, "Why I just couldn't do that. I would die." So
they rush on in this mad Jazz age, finding, only
the husks while the inner kernels, the essence of their
diviner life lies dormant; therefore, it awaits the
awakening, perhaps by some great tragedy or sorrow.
One finds through progressive ideas to wait in the
real sense of the word, brings stagnation. One must
be up and doing some form of work, either physical,
mental or spiritual work of some kind.
Serenity comes through poise and poise brings
mastership. Usually this mastery cames through long
and various experiences. A few seem to be born
with a serene temperament. The majority must ac
quire it through Soul qualification, unifying them
selves with the great universal power and divine love.

Prov. 16: "He that is slow to anger is better than
the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that
taketh a city."
The soul of calm, serene temperament is chosen as
a sensible and valued friend. Its quiet even vibra
tion is like a strengthing tonic. It speaks of compos
ure and reliance. It is this real self sufficiency that
all should seek to acquire.
Through the study of nature one discovers the
rythm of life is poise, equilibrum, power and soul
serenity, forgiving aU, forgetting all and in loving
devotion wrapped in the arms of the Christ love, send
out on the wireless ether to all humanity, the unspoken
word, health, happiness and peace.
Man wails his lot and calls life harsh and rude,
O. happy bird, do you not toil for food?
Have you no tasks which hold you fast by day?
Feel you no pains that you can seem so gay?
Ah, yes, you share our cares, O, singing bird.
Yet from your throat there comes no grumbling word.
In spite of all life's hurts, while you survive
You tell the world 'tis sweet to be alive. —Guest.

Feed me with food convenient for me;
Lest I be full, and deny Thee and say.
Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor and steal
And take the name of my God in vain.
He asks neither extreme poverty nor extreme
wealth. This was his wish in the long ago. All
humanity today would do well to keep this thought
still before them in this progressive age for the conflict
goes on, up and down, on the scale, frequently the
cause is purely physical, waging a conflict of some kind
within. These Souls who travel either up or down
the scale are daily gambling with life, only to lose all
in the end.
He Went Home
Six hundred years before the advent of Christ, an
Indian Prince was born named Gaudama, now often
called Buddha. He seeing the conflict of the miser
able wretches worked to death in the fields, kept down
by the thoughts given them of being deserving of this
punishment and misery caused by things they left un
done and crimes committed in former existences.
He tore himself away, leaving wealth, possessions
and miseries all behind him, determined there was
something better through the constant divine urge he
had. He went forth, teaching and preaching of wis
dom, Justice and Self-denial, Self-renunciation, con
templation and purity—teaching his followers to travel
by the way of what he termed an eight-fold path.
Some of these ideas he placed before them were, right
aspirations, right mode of living, right views, right
speech, right effect, right conduct, right mindfulness.

This mode of living would place each soul above the
conflicts of life today placing their feet upon a solid
rock, the foundation made through the power that
comes by the conscious use of constructive thinking,
courting neither poverty nor riches as the one who
wrote in Proverbs so clearly stated. Nothing comes
to us without effort, we are obliged to strive and climb,
to enter the realm of contentment and success. In
this manner one is able to stear clear of the conflicts
that are daily facing the world. If conflict does come
as they usually do to the greater majority some time
in life, be able to meet them by daily practice of the
Buddha's eight-fold method.
Be true to thine own self,
As you wish others to be true to thee.
Doubly blessed you will then be—
Conflicts you will seldom see.

CHAPTER XXIV
LESSON 24
APPRECIATION
"Still work on, love on and serve. God knows what thy hand
has to do. Unnoticed by the throng, uncaring by thee. He knows
—He watches —He cares for thee."
It is discovered on close thought
that it is really love alone that
prompts one to fully appreciate the
real worth of others and the minutest
thing did for us, but today we are also
discovering that this just valuation
or gratitude toward others is not
abundant—then toward the Creator of
all good gifts it is scarcer still.
Many take it for granted that all
the good things of life they can get is
coming to them. This may be all true
but one should realize from whence
the fountain flows.
It is difficult to put the real and true valuation or
proper estimate of worth upon kindly deeds prompted
by love, especially is this true of those who are daily
exhibiting this love in the immediate home atmos
phere.
Just suppose one of these loved ones would pass
quickly to spirit life, then immediately do we begin

to take an inventory of all their innumerable qualities
while with us, for now we do not wish to think of
omissions of the past.
Perhaps some valued friend leaves for some foreign
land, what a wonderful difference there is manifested
then within our lives, we then begin to realize what
they were to us. It sets up the vibration of think
ing of their value how we could have appreciated them
more while with us.
It is possible to set in motion an endless wave of
vibrations by seeing only the good qualities, always
speaking only the good to them, seeing only the good
in them.
Can we then estimate the valuation of true loving
friendships? Not as we should. Do our actions show
our feelings in dislikes in loves? Many times to one's
shame we must confess they do.
Good Fellowship
Emerson says: "My friends come to me unsought,
the great God gives them to me." Clothe thy self with
radiance of the Christ light. Throw thy cloak of
sympathy and love about these who are drawn to you ,
As we give love we are loved. Those who know this
union of good fellowship thrill with a satisfied feeling
of harmonies ineffable.
These are the ones who know how and when to ap
preciate the good of life. Many times deeds of love are
trampled upon or misjudged or perhaps some one is
judged harshly. This is caused through the lack ol
Soul Culture or making light of a kindly deed.

Never mind, those; are selfish friendships and un
developed Souls who have no sense of appreciation.
Their love vanishes as dew, the moment things do
not come their way. This is only pretence of friend
ship. They know scarcely the meaning of gratitude.
We are constantly being weighed in the balance of
Justice and sad to say found wanting. Can not those
who read these lines, if they have not measured up to
the proper test, become more thoughtful exhibiting
toward others more loving solicitude and loving grati
tude —trying to estimate the true value of others.
Deeds of Kindness
Do not leave the words unspoken when a kindness
is shown you. It is easy to say, "I am grateful." It
means such a big lift of encouragement, it helps to
smooth out many times the rough places along life's
rugged path. One knows not aways by the outer
surface how a heart may ache for sympathy and love.
One cannot determine nor estimate the value of
deeds of kindness. Let the mirror of your soul reflect
love and an understanding heart.
The majority will appreciate every kindly thought
and deed, never mind about the others, knowing as we
receive the good of life we must give equivalent in
return. One does not wish flattery nor do they de
sire after they have served for the other to feel in
debted. Just be helpful then you appreciate from an
equal standing. Give a loving thought to a friend
although far away; this is giving as the angels give.
Value your friends to such a degree that you ask
them not to share your burdens nor your losses.

CHAPTER XXV
LESSON 25
Friendship Should be Based Upon Worth
Rather Than Position or Wealth
One does not care especially about self analysis. He discovers
too many of his own faults. People are more anxious to define
the faults of others.
If a true friend, thou hast entwined thy self around my heart;
if false to me God's love alone can atone, and conquer thee.
Out on the great open road of life,
we meet such good wholesome people.
No creeds, isms nor hide-bound ideas
interfering. Just the interchange of
passing thoughts and ideas only. Ytet
there is left a lasting impression of
friendliness and good fellowship, one
likes to remember.
"The only way to have true and last
ing friends is to be a true friend."
It would seem good if one could
always see his friends through rose
colored glasses.
The friends that drift from your side, for no ap
parent reason, are but friends in the seeming only.
Let them pass, never mind, others come to fill up the
nitch with a more understanding heart.

It is far better to stand entirely alone, than to stand
with the crowd who are false.
The multitudes may trample you under foot, God
will lift you to supreme heights.
It is far better to know who are false, even though
it cut as a two edged sword, than to harbor false
friendships.
It is deplorable to discover the world is full of
Judases and so few Christly souls. Pray on, love
on, you will gain the victory over friend or foe,
although you may discover the bitter cup.
The ones who are ready to accept the stinging blasts
and falsehools of others, are not the ones to court as
friends. These on the slightest provocation drift with
the tide and surge down the stream. When standing
in the capacity of a real friend you have made a point.
A true friend is he, when a viper comes to sting
with a poisonous tongue, can readily say, "I don't be
lieve it," then will paddle up the stream with you and
conquer the foe.
"God's eternal friendship is yours for the accept
ance, work to keep it." From experience one discovers
all is not gold that glitters in the sunlight.
Many diamonds in appearance are only paste. A
real friend is a jewel of priceless worth, treasure
them as such. They will not leave you in the darkest
hour of poverty nor forsake you in sorrows direst
trials.
Never break a trust, nor mar a friendship, no mat
ter what the apparent gain. Emerson says, "I chide
society and embrace solitude and yet I am not so un
grateful, as not to see the lovely and the noble-minded

as from time to time they pass my gate. Who hears
me, who understands me, becomes mine—a possession
for all time."
"Strive hard to be real —ao much is false;
So much is painted —so much smoothed over."
Climb alone to the top of the highest mountain,
rather than trust to a false friend, who is ready to
push you from your path to gain your place.
One craves not a king nor queen, to walk with them
as friends if in a lower station of life. For under
the velvet mantle, one would long to find a soul on a
level with their own, in thought and companionship.
One seeks not a friend in effigy ; but that substantial
and real something to have and hold, while time shall
last. Solid and sincere, filled with truth and justice,
love and tenderness, in their mirrored presence.
He who offers himself as a candidate, is obliged to
measure up to this high standard of composition and
efficiency.
There is no requirement that these friendships need
be handled as costly china, nor silken tissues, that
blows to the four winds, the moment a storm brews.
They must needs be the harbinger of friendships
lasting forever. Seldom used, ever near if needed,
and ever reliable.
A false friendship is like a rattler. Curled up in
its hiding place, when least expected it strikes.
The strongest weapon is needed to combat this
enemy. It is God's protecting power. It is thy shield
and buckler, know there shall no evil befall thee, for
He gives His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
all thy ways.— 91 Psalm.

Trust this truest friend, in storms or in sunshine,
He will walk by your side ; if you love, trust and hope
on.
When in doubt, use the old maxim, "When you find a
friend good and true; change not the old for the new."
For fear when the tinsel of the new one wears
away, nothing but a tarnished bauble will remain..
It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion: It
is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he
who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the
independence of solitude. —Emerson.

Proverbs 25:21 —If thine enemy be hungry—give him bread

Since writing this little chapter on Friendships I
received a letter from one who has proven hersell a
true and valued friend. Sending me the following lines,
she received after an experience she had gone through
in being truthful wfth a supposed friend.
TRUTH AND FRIENDSHIP
My friend and I were friends indeed,
Until one day —we disagreed.
I told the truth and in the end
I had a foe instead of friend.
Had I just smiled and passed it by
I'd still have a friend but live a lie.
Some how the things we think are right,
Oft' lead us into darkest night.
Then all alone we battle through,
Paying the price for all we do;
Though I can say and truthfully too, unto the end,
I did not deceive my one time friend.

LESSON 26
LIFE'S CAMERA
"The real life of every one is a composition of acting and
depicting human life through character upon the world's stage.
The theatre platform is the stage of life, the audience the greatest
consisting of the world of humanity."
The truthful manuscript to be studi
ed is coming from harmonial spheres,
photographing upon the human mind
the real pictures which are our own
true loved ones—friends, teachers and
master-teachers, bringing back from
over there the true message of life in
the spheres of those who have stepped
off the stage of earth life.
These are fully conscious of the
great truth that death is life and
life eternal. That it all depends upon
the quality of the acting whether real
or pretense what credit is received in the final analysis.
The new age is here, a new song is being sung to
sweetest music, if one will open his prejudiced mind,
so that due examination will find and determine for
himself and drink in to the fullest measure the truth
ful messages that have been brought back from what
is the real life, the spirit realms of the spheres.

Seen and Unseen Audience
There is always surrounding one a seen and an un
seen audience. These eyes are judging according to
their views, those with narrow stunted vision or one
idea people, seeing through murky glasses of an un
developed consciousness. Their judgment is not to
be depended upon but this unseen camera, filming
every act, there is nothing like it to show up the bad
acting.
Many keep behind the scenes, acting out life's drama
of sorrows and misfortunes, their joys or good for
tunes unseen in silence, or closing the soul in neglect
ing the duty toward others that would help them to
forget their sorrows or the bad acting of the past or
grieving over some imaginary wrong perpertrated
against them.
Start forgetting. Go out upon the stage of life
and search through the great audience of humanity.
There are many with trials greater than your own.
Help to ease their burdens, your own will grow light
er. This is a sure remedy that helps one to forget;
it is one of the greatest blessings a burdened soul can
find, "the art of forgetting."
Life is a series of many prolonged experiences,
each series a play acted within the life; usually it is
associated with both seriousness and comicality, there
fore one discovers blessings whereby they are per
mitted to have at least some comedy as well as tragic
incidents in their life, but life is mixed with a great
deal of farce, for usually both qualities are exagger

ated —yet, too, is life a duality that is expressed in
every department of nature, thus reaping daily the
effect of cause.
However it comes, each series acted within the life
is for the betterment and growth of the soul. Only
through these series can one hope to find that which
fits one for higher grades of life.
X-Ray of Godly Life
All must go on acting their life's drama or farce
every act speaks for one's self for the character will
be known. There is no need of trying to varnish over
the defects or try adding luster to seeming perfection.
Man is like the undeveloped photographer's plate, the
likeness is there but the plate must be developed, be
fore the likeness of man becomes visible, the God must
be developed to make visible a Godly life.
One may presume from the point of worldly judges
eyes and deceive ; though the point is to live through
out that the critical eye of the world or the negative
plate of the X-ray from spirit forces brought to bear
and focused upon us may bring out a shadow of a
perfectly developed character.
If the camera could register the real inner Soul as
the outer visage is reflected in a mirror, would it be a
pleasing picture? If so there is nothing to dread or
fear, for the old life has been effaced for the Diviner
Self, living and enacting the new, forgetting the old,
reflecting the inner life in outer expression, in life's
series of profitable acts. Life is a picture show, we
are the actors, throwing upon the screen the things

service?
Then when the curtain is lowered upon earth life's
final drama, it will rise again amid a burst of ap
plause, as one enters upon the real stage of life in the
world of spirit where the orchestra of the spheres
will play hallowed music and the sweet angelic voices
sing an anthem of praise and hallelujah. The curtain
is lowered upon the last earthly performance there
by stepping out and ascending to the next step of
progression in life eternal, there to more perfectly
round out the life (if one so wishes) for all is left
to soul desire still, where every desire may be gratified.
As F. L. Homes so fittingly says:
Let's start forgetting—
There are so many things to lay away
In graves —dead hates, fears and doubts that flay,
And all these faults scarce worth a grain,
There are so many black days we have known
There is no use regretting—
Let's start forgetting.

CHAPTER XXVII
LESSON 27
SELFISHNESS OR LIBERATION
"God sends every bird its food but he does not throw it
into the nest."
Those who are big and whole heart
ed are those who sorrow in others sor
rows and losses or rejoice in their
; joys.
Those who are selfishly small and
envious, poison the small world they
live in by their inharmonious vibra
tions, their world is small because
they make it so by their own selfish
thoughts.
- Those who are big and whole-heart
ed rejoicing in others' pleasures are
making their own pleasures also. It
makes their world beautiful, resounding and ringing
out with the vibrations of love and good fellowship
to those whose ears are finely attuned to ether waves
of thought.
The world looks beautiful to those who see goodness
in others instead of faultfinding; they are creating
their Heaven about them.

If a mind is filled with variant discord, it is en
compassed with vibrations that will record the in
harmonious or discordant thoughts ; thus does it sound
and resound until the atmosphere is full of it.
Many wonder why they are sick, have sick head
aches and etc., this very thing will droduce a poison,
that brings about various kinds of illness. Many do not
know what has caused their trouble. If they will
search themselves or their home surroundings they
may find it there.
Imaginary Slights
Numerous times the greatest cause for so-called
diseases is imaginary slights; for a diseased mind
such as hold a grudge, imaginary slights or actions,
can poison the sweetest atmosphere and harm sensitive
souls. If this vibration is kept up long enough it will
finally become such a mental disease and unbalance
the strongest mind.
As one permits selfish motives to take possession,
the good within diminishes. Permit the sunlight of
God's love and understanding to enter, then observe
how quickly the dark clouds roll away, one re
ceives wonderful dividends from this mode of living.
"An infallible remedy for imaginary trouble is to
get right with God."
What you are within you most surely are without.
Then the trials and cares that are so small in God's
sight, although many make mountains of them, will all
disappear by change of thought. This is such a simple
remedy but the mightiest that has ever reached the
consciousness of man. Think right then all will live

LESSON 28
A DAY STAR
When you look for sunshine, you will be sure to find it
even on the cloudiest day.
Did you ever stop to think the stars
> in their azure depths of the Heavenly
skies are always shining? Although
"
we cannot see thejm yet they are al
ways there but by day they are hid
den by the brightness of the sun's
rays. Black lowering clouds may hide
the sun from our sight, yet still the
sun shines.
In like manner many noble un
assuming souls are stars of light and
angels of mercy, though others may
appear to outshine them in brilliancy.
Nevertheless, if there is a mission for them to perform
it is done faithfully and well.
Each separate star has its own individual place to
fill in the firmament above; its own place in God's
great plan.
When the shades of night are drawn and the sun in
its brightness disappears there they are found illum
inating the darkness by their wonderful beauty, filling

another but the dimmest star and the most unassum
ing soul has its mission. Their worth is seen and ap
preciated as the brightness of the sun disappears froim
sight. It is known God cares for them all alike.
"Never lose your foothold on the ladder of progress.
Follow your own highest light, knowing all light is
progressive."

"Be a day star, out shining those of night, even though the
clouds do come making day seem night. You can scatter doubts

CHAPTER XXIX
LESSON 29
LIGHT
"The night is far spent and the day is at hand; let us there
fore cast out the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of
light." —Romans 13.
♦ » »
God said, "Let there be light and there was light." —Gen. 1 .
Daily expressing God's goodness is
to know how to radiate, and to do this
is to manifest the God within into out
er expression.
To live the radiant life is to be a
reflector. This is to be every one's
duty, no two reflecting the same. Each
in his separate star, reflecting in
greatness and beauty according to his
light received. How for reaching it
becomes.
Jesus said, "Let thy light so shine
before men that they may see your
good works." As no two stars reflect the same radi
ance, neither do two souls hope to reflect equally the
same light.
It is not necessary to laboriously shovel out the
darkness and gloom of night's shadows that gather
so fast around an unenlightened soul—all is needed
is to turn on the light of God's universal laws.
This brings poise and comfort to any storm-tossed

soul. The light that shows them their duty to God,
meaning duty and love to those around them and to
all they daily contact. When this place is reached
the soul door is opened permitting them to ungrudg
ingly give love and consideration with divine justice,
sharing with all—otherwise these souls are miserable
making others miserable also.
An Even Balance
The scales must swing in an even balance. When
a truth is received it should not be bottled up and
labeled as a private possession. A body of water with
out inlet or outlet becomes stagnant . Give it freedom
then see how alive it becomes in its shimmering spark
ling beauty. In like comparison is it to those who
give and give of their light ungrudgingly or without
reluctance.
The source from which this goodness flows is scien
tific thinking; it is the Keeper of the Temple. Take
the golden key and unlock the gateway to the Holy
City of light and wisdom. It brings one to that placa
bility where life on the path is really a worthwhile
one to travel. Here one pierces the dark clouds with
an understanding vision for clouds and sorrows some
times cross the path of those in the light, also, then
through the broadened vision does one know the sun
still shines beyond the darkest cloud. This is the stone
rolled away by the unfolded Christ consciousness.
Through this wisdom one knows just where to meet
out Justice or to withold Judgment—then one sees
every soul unscreened not that which covers it—this
is growing in Divine Wisdom, for you know as you
are known.

In His Steps
The earnest prayer of the human heart daily should
be "Give me more light" that I may reflect it to others
less fortunate. This is giving as the Christ gave.
Only then can one hear the voice from the burning
bush of Moses, sound its sweetest music to a soul well
attuned and refined through spirit thoughts to catch
the great rays of God's power and wisdom as they
pass by, assisting one to live the radiant life of the
Master —following in his steps.
Listen—be still, quieting the outer senses, look with
in then from out the depths of the soul will come the
message to you recharged and chemicalized by the
force and power of God. Give humanity love, each in
his own sphere, each by his own light giving, one is
then a radiant reflection of God's perfected love.
"Reach upward as far as you can toward God's
great summit, then God will come and meet you,
gladden and lighten the way."
All are on the great ladder of progression with you
seeking light in some form of manifestation. Many
are above you, others are below. Those below you,
are to be aided by you, do not push their hold frofm
the round of the ladder, lest you, too, slide back also,
for as you hope to get first aid1 from these above
you are obliged to give to those below.
By thy own light seek thou to live,
If spurned by the world of man, do not fear,
If despised and pushed aside have no care —
You have your work, thy song to sing —
Thy deeds of love to do—
Keep hoping—keep trusting—keep praying on,
Claiming no reward this duty does not give.

CHAPTER XXX
LESSON 30
THE WAY
Truth is Boundless; Truth is Illimitable
"Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven and all things will
be added unto you."
Every soul is obliged morally or
physically to discover the way is with
in, no use to look for it in some far
away place at some future time. Look
within your own soul—there you'll dis
cover the part of you that is divine.
Therein lies the haven of rest, the
sunshine of the soul. Is there discon
tent, weariness, oppression, some dark
cloud ? Begin today to throw wide the
windows of the soul, permitting this
sunshine to constantly come into the
upper-chamber, for light and under
standing of the way is there. It will scatter the clouds
of depression with their apprehension of evil or dang
er, permitting God's unlimited light to enter.
If one will form the habit of listening to the inner
consciousness the way will be shown him. Jesus said,
"Fear not, for lo / am with you even unto the end."
With this realization is discovered the way, the truth
and the light to the Kingdom within.

CHAPTER XXXI
LESSON 31
COMPENSATION
"Those who give not, till they die" show that they would
not then, if they could keep it any longer. For he who provides
for this life, but takes no thought for: eternity, is wise for a
moment but a fool forever."
It matters not in how great a degree
one stands well before the world in
position or wealth, life will surely pay
each soul for what they get. If it is
gotten in honor or dishonor, if deeds
of shame stamp their wealth with
dishonesty, certain and sure will they
reap sometime what is sown. In John
4, Jesus said, "Say ye there are yet
four months and then cometh the
harvest, behold I say unto you, lift up
your eyes and look on the fields that
they are white already unto harvest.
He that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit
unto life eternal that he that soweth and he that
reapeth may rejoice together."
All have a perfect right to the place in the temple
they are building. If it is built upon a solid foundation
of love and good deeds toward humanity. In the glory
of Divine love one is assured of a living tree of right
eousness, deserving the fruitage of God's Love.

Seek the depths where the living waters flow, never
be too busy in material affairs to spare a short period
each day to shut out the world around you and co)n-
mune with the God within—knowing you are a part of
Him and the Universe. The battles of life are over
come here, one beholds the safe road that leads to wis
dom and power.
Threads of Gold
One daily weaves life's fabric in threads of gold
when love and peace are there. When hate is woven
in, the threads of life become tangled and knotted, for
one is daily receiving the effects of every cause for the
law of compensation is the law of Justice.
When the world awakens to the realization of this,
the progress of mankind will not go on so slowly as it
has in the past. One will see all things are for a pur
pose. It brings strength of will, conquering doubts and
scattering fears.
Time and experience are the soul's educator, although
numerous times the experiences are a severe teacher,
Goethe's choice for his motto —"Time is my inheri
tance, time is my estate."
The harder the trials and experiences, the greater
strength we have to tackle the next difficult problem
that confronts one and brighter the stars will shine
in the future if patience is in the watch tower.
"We as individuals pass as a ship in the night but
principles and influence abide forever."

"The secret of Happiness is not in satisfying your
every want, but in changing them. In proportion as we
allow selfish motives to possess us, the good in us die
out."
"See that the resounding echo ever brings back to you sweet
harmonies." This is your compensation.
SYMPATHY
"Keep the home fires of thy own heart aglow, no matter
who may chance in weariness to cross thy threshold of life. You
can furnish them with the warmth and cheeriness of thy own
hearth stone or greater courage to add to their knapsack."
What is it worth when lonely or overwhelmingly
grieved—weighed down with some Gethsemane that
must be passed through to feel the pressure of a warm
hand clasp of a sympathizing friend and a word of love
and courage?
It really helps remove the clouds and shadows of de
pression, making room for the warmth and sunshine
of peace to enter their lives.
Does it strike a harmonious chord within? Does it
help to give strength? Speak courage or voice love?
Does it build confidence? Yes, it does all this and
far more for sometimes without a spoken word it helps
subdue the troubled waters. In silence it seems to
whisper, "your burdens, your sorrows and trials I
would gladly help you share. I understand." This is
an example of the Christ work He was constantly prac
ticing toward others, stilling the troubled waters,
saying, "peace be still."
In spite of your own trials, in no degree neglect
the opportunity of offering your sympathy and love.

LESSON 32
JUST CREDIT
Life is light and peace or darkness and gloom.
You can have either one, by a change of thought—
Either is easily acquired—which path doth thou choose?
Life is dual, a mixture of lights,
shadows, sunshine, trials. Many are ---i^
grieving over the yesterdays that hold
the past with its many disappoint
ments and the numerous things desir
ed, but failed to accomplish.
Others are constantly looking to a
far distant future for the fulfillment
of some supposed qualification that
will be a separate acquisition in life's
destiny later. It is only natural for
man to wonder what life holds later
for him but too many lose sight of
the present in so doing, forgetting the present is all
one is actually sure of.
The majority today are traveling far too many ex
peditions, reaching out and beyond, longing for the to
morrow that holds their expectations. They forget that
life is all eternity, they are wasting their energy and
overlooking the profit and pleasure to be gained today.

If instead one would permit the fviure to wait and
take all the sweetness and aroma out of the today, they
would get the credit due them.
The desires of the future will be accomplished much
easier, when reaching this place in evolution's plan.
Fears of the future will melt away and be forgotten
by the sunkissed atmosphere of today's glory.
Emerson says, The great need in life, "Is someone
to make us do the best we can." "He who lives the
best he can each day will find encouragement and help
along the way." Demand of life the opportunity to
express what you really are, then in return life will
demand you to improve every occasion offered for this
pacific purpose, when measuring up to this standard,
the pure white Jasmine in the soul's garden will daily
bloom.
"THE JASMINE"
Into the garden of rarest flowers.
Scented with perfumes rare
In sweet simplicity, the Jasmine grew,
Giving of its fragrance where —
Weary and care-worn travelers trod;
Whether they be high or low.
It mattered not, the climbing Jasmine—
Gave of its trophies rare.
Gentle and unassuming be—a Jasmine,
Like the angels robed in white,
Ready where e're duty calls thee.
Be a giver e're the night—
Doth come and find thee.
Be ready with thy golden light.
There will the Master find thee, as the Jasmine—
Gives, fullest measure thru' sorrows darkest night.

CHAPTER XXXIII
LESSON 33
SELFISHNESS— A DESTROYER
"Withold not good from them to whom it is due, when it
ia in the power of thine own hand to do."
Selfishness is poverty. It is a dis
ease causing a destitute, lonely exis
tence. It destroyes and burns up the
soul of those who invite or harbor it
as a guest.
It is forever adding soreness to one's
sorrows and sharpens one's pains. It
aggravates all the losses a soul is liable
to endure and when goaded to ex
tremes often turns destroyer and
strikes its last blow upon its self.
Do not fear to give credit where
credit is due. If one cannot them
selves do great deeds they should at least appreciate
them in others.
No jealous, envious person can rise to greatness what
ever may be the opportunities offered for advancement;
no broad or generous person can ever live an ignoble
life.

Jealousy Seals the Windows of the Soul
A whole lifetime of humdrum duties cannot so nar
row existance as does the habit of belittling the noble
deeds and experiences of others.
Never fail when an opportunity presents itself to
give praise where it should be given, your own soul
will then expand.
Jealousy is a consumption bred in your structure
house where love should be. Where God is, fear and
jealously is cast aside as naught. Jealously seals the
windows of the soul for it shuts one up in privacy of
self, then the soul becomes miserly.
Open up the windows of thy own conscience,
permit interest and love of others to enter. When
one is jealous of their companions or friends this means
that they have drawn the blinds and closed the shut
ters tight where they see only the dark walls, never see
beyond into the great heart of humanity.
There are oceans of sunshine, love and happiness for
all those who live in harmony with the law of Divine
supply giving and receiving in like portion.
Lincoln has said, "Oh, hard it is to die and not be
able to leave this world any better for one's little life
in it."
"As diamonds throw out their beautiful
Colors of opalescent and rainbow hues;
So truthful principles and unselfish motives
Reveal the beauties of Heaven's own."

LESSON 34
PROBATIONERS
"Sit in thy own great judgment seat first, then you will be
able to judge another."
Every soul is a probationer on evo
lution's path, whose emancipation
comes only when every condition in
life is rounded out. All depending on
how justly entitled they are to have
conferred upon them the different
degrees, how quickly they evolve up
wards to greater freedom.
There are those who realize their
responsibilities to God and man who
pass through their probationary
period with patient fortitude, carry
ing their crosses with a smile of un
derstanding, knowing that Divine law is Divine
Justice.
Through the probationary period one is daily
weighed in the balance for all are obliged to pay this
price of redemption, not through Jesus Christ or
shedding of his blood but through the justifications
of their own daily labors, thoughts, and deeds for
or against the laws of life.

But there are many even though the still small
voice of their conscience tells them the right from the
wrong path to reach the goal of probation, they will
say the world owes them a living, then wait for some
thing to come to them. They find sooner or later that
God helps those who help themselves. This is the
workings of Divine law.
Compensation
Every soul is obliged to vindicate itself by its own
compensation period, paying to the last farthing the
debts they owe the Creator of all good gifts. This
is a true philosophy of life, every one is paid in his
own coin.
"I planted and cultivated but God gave the increase."
Cor. 4:. It is for humanity to plant and cultivate,
then God will compensate the laborer in full measure.
Does He not say prayer without works is dead? One
can never hope to be happy nor receive even a small
degree, either here or hereaftr without service—with
out the give and take plan.
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one
and every man shall receive his own reward according
to his own labor, "for we are laborers together with
God. Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building."
Cor. 3 :8.
Those who through the probationary period are
constantly constructing, building and are useing
thought power scientifically are co-workers with God.
Those who care not how or what they think are
traveling unheedingly toward a great yawning abyss.

They are destroyers. These are forever crying over
their misfortunes for they have failures many of them
made by their destructive negative and careless think
ing.
One can never hope to be at perfect peace until he
has performed from the lowest to the highest duty to
God and man. No need to attempt substitution for
there is no possible subterfuge, no evasion, one must
stand the test alone. Receiving the high or low as to
grade, may we pray all will stand grades of 99% when
the testing time comes.
Commit these lines by Edgar Guest lest thou forget.
"if you see a man who's weary, help him out,
Be a willing friend and cheery, help him out;
Life's a game to give and take
Andj what's done for kindness' sake
Tends the better world to make, help him out."
"The unerring law of compensation, will govern every act
of our lives."
It is a proven fact: necessity of circumstances proves our
friendships and unerringly detects our enemies."
WHO PAYS THE PRICE
Who pays the price—the wage of sin?
All must pay, no free passes to enter in
Yet the gate does stand ajar—
Justice pays all at the judgment bar.
There is a fixed and invisible law, all are obliged
to pay. Multitudes of ministers are telling their con
gregation that by the crucified Christ you are saved,
that all is needed is to repent, then you can enter
into Heaven.

The Master Jesus taught the people where to find
the truth. Did he not say, "The Kingdom is within?"
When rightfully discovered there would be no room
for sin.
He sacrificed his life for the truth.
Every soul upon earth is obliged to settle every
debt himself alone, as long as it remains upon life's
book. Taking the lesson the Teacher of light taught
is paying the way through service, then the door is
opened wide for all to enter. Henceforth search to
discover the highest light, then practice it toward all
humanity.
Heaven is within if peace and righteousness are
there. It is above all and in all. There sits the
Judge that no King can corrupt.
There all is life and truth and light,
With no more sorrows nor strife,
It will keep one busy to pay what's due—
Remember it must be paid and paid by you.

CHAPTER XXXV
LESSON 35
MUSIC AND POETRY
Take more time to enjoy the things of life.
Providing it does not deprive others of their rights,
God has put the universe at your command.
Music, poetry, all nature —thus He gives—we take —
Accept His valuable gifts with a greatful heart.
Who are training their ears to hear
only what is lovely and lastingly val
uable. Attuning their soul to enjoy
the rhythm and exhiliration of good
music, or poetry, deriving pleasure
from others' laughter, from others'
joys, or enjoying a rippling brook
or great wide sweeping oceans. If
they do not their life is yet dormant.
Their souls not yet attuned to God the
great giver of all gifts.
One should demand their percep
tions to be awakened to the importa
tion of beauty and the joy of living.
Like must be divided into useful things for the
body and invigorating and vitalizing things for the
soul, when one is a lover of good music and the
rhythmic lines of poetry, then God is near. Try to
have good music near; for its sweet harmony attunes
the soul to harmonies of the spheres.

Happiness is not by any means all contained in
material things. It is when a soul is fully awakened to
divine truths one discovers this to be true, for only
then does he really enjoy the beauties of life and un
derstand how one must live in the rhythm of life to
enjoy the atmosphere of peace and harmony. Loving
to do the things that are really worth while.
Throw off the shackles that bind the soul down to
misery, constructing thoughts of faith and courage.
Look life squarely in the face, then the soul within
will become a living thing of beauty responding to
outer loveliness.
Joy and happiness will vibrate as sweetest music
around one attuned to nature and life; they cannot
help broadcasting it out to a yearning world effect
ing the whole atmosphere ; reaching into endless space
with its influence. The rhythmic vibrations will re
echo the peace from within. There will be music and
and poetry in every passing hour. For such souls
give as the angels give. In this vibrating life force
is found freedom in mental and physical expression.
Use your gentlest voice vibrant with love, watch it
daily, prize it as a rich jewel or a sweet gentle in
strument attuned to the harmonies of the spheres,
quieting the turbulent sea and storms of life with its
power.
Irving says :
A lost temper never mellows with age and a sharp
tongue is the only two edged tool that grows keener
with constant use.

LESSON 36
TUNING IN
"Tuning in to where one touches the radio-activity of Uni
versal minds in the material and spiritual realms of life, can be
done by all, old or young, rich or poor, high or low, sick or well.
Through acquiring this knowledge, one discovers the basic
facts of all existence, whereby one daily reaps the reward of
merit through awakened consciousness."
Tuning in is found today to be a
very common phrase of speech since
the wonderful radio has made its ad
vent into our lives.
All are aware that radio consists of
two important principles that are nec
essary in receiving the wireless mes
sage. These are the broadcasting
apparatus, the other the receiving set.
"One is the giver the other is the re
ceiver." One is of no account with
out the other.
The world of thinkers know that
man is a composite both of combined sender and re
ceiver and many other wonderful things of power,
when the physical and mental perfection is thoroughly
developed and understood. The mental attitude of
man is the real magnet, for the Divine law of attrac
tion is accurate in its likes and dislikes. The mental

attitude is our personality, and depends upon the men
tal powers of thought what we think and what we are
is a proven factor in our life.
"The Master-Key tells us if we wish to change
conditions all that is necessary is to change our per
sonality which will in turn change the environment,
things and conditions, or the experiences with which
we meet in life." Metaphysical and psychology stu
dents understand the workings of this law. This is
tuning in on constructive thinking, it will not be an
easy matter to change the attitu-dle of thought after
a life time of haphazard thinking.
Changing the Dial
If one wishes to change a radio program they
change the dial, tuning in to another station, changing
wave lengths, bringing in over the air another, per
haps better, or worse. Our mental broadcasting and
receiving depend upon the rate of vibration, the eth-
eric thought waves upon polarity action, reaction be
tween each individual and the Universal for as the
radio depends upon the broadcasting station and the
receiving station, so the Universal can broadcast only
through the individual. This universal power re
quires this energy to start it into activity.
Man must tune in to vital principles, the strict ad-
herants to this law is very important, for if one
tunes in to a poor program they miss the good one;
if on a good one they miss the poor one, each indi
vidual is a receiver. If well attuned they get the best,
whatever they tune in on they get. The millions of

humanity are daily broadcasting anything you want.
Be careful and prayerful, tuning in daily to receive
only the best of mental and spiritual manna.
Practice daily the dialing of the station of God's
spheres where you receive for the mind currents of
noble thoughts, knowledge and Divine truth, and the
best of everything, all attracted through living in har
mony with natural law.
When the mind is attuned to this station you have
the vital principles, then the sensitive vibrations of
the soul registers only the truthful messages from
(over there) and from masters of light from their
broadcasting station. Tune in on this great store
house, you will receive to the limit of your mental
capacity.
What of the Etheric Wave
One hears a great deal of the hertzian waves or
electric waves, the bases of the wireless telegrapthy.
What of the electric waves? These etheric waves
will be the basic topic in this new age we are just
entering, although scarcely mentioned in the past yet
over these etheric waves the messages of Truth, Knowl
edge and Wisdom are sent from higher spheres.
To tune in to spirit, the finest of etheric vibrations,
it is as necessary to prepare one's self as carefully as
one goes about to prepare the sensitive wires of the
radio to catch the waves of thought sent forth from
the central broadcasting stations.
Those who are finely attuned to the etheric vibra
tions are conscious of the fact that the super-station
of the spheres is constantly trying to broadcast to the

earth. So far there are a few who are finely attuned
enough or adhere to the wavering attachment of the
vital principles necessary to receive the best results.
The mind is the greatest instrument in the world.
It is the most powerful and sensitive to vibrations.
With it properly attuned one can catch as they are
sent forth over the finest etheric waves messages
broadcasted from this great super-station of the
spheres.
It is found then preparedness is very essential for
results in any sphere of life. One would not think of
trying to run an airplane or automobile without gas
or oil. One must not think of trying to opperate be
tween the earth and spiritual spheres without prepar
ing the mind by cleaning out all old dregs and rub
bish (old thoughts and ideas) replacing clean, pure
material of the finest texture. Thus all depends up
on whether one receives from the higher or the lower
planes of life, for all kinds of thoughts are constant
ly struggling for entrance.
Living Unselfish Lives
It is very essential to properly chemicalize and purify
the thoughts by love and uprightness. Living unselfish
lives for this is the only way to get through the etheric
waves, the reliable message across from broadcaster
to receiver.
If it is proven one message has come across (and
it has been without a doubt) then all the millions of
souls can get them across, if the conditions (the in

struments) are properly attuned with no static inter
ference (mental agitation) which makes occasion
for poor transmittal of the message.
Try it out, experiment, one never will know what
he can do without making an effort, until he thorough
ly tests it out for himself, with unbiased, unpre
judiced mind, for if it works for another it will work
for you. Then broadcast the fact that immortality
is a truth, that those gone before do live and have
come back with the vital message proving immor
tality.
Then a new song will be sung, for upon the horizon
a new age is born, a new day, a new epoch is here.
Keep pace with the times. Get the vital message across
to others. The majority want it, a few do not, leave
these alone to find out for themselves. You cannot
possibly tell some people anything, they know too little
of the right thing and too much of the wrong. Their
bigoted ideas and narrow gauge vision will not per
mit them to know and understand.
The Safety Zone (for tuning in)
The safety valve of the mind, one is obliged to daily
cultivate. Watch as well as pray that thy thoughts
may not travel forth as undisciplined children.
For as the power-plant on an airplane is the entire
apparatus for generating power, including motor,
propeller, radiator, gasoline tank etc., in like degree
should the mind, the greatest thing of man, be the
propeller translating rotary force, not only forward
but upward and onward with autmatic stability. With
the maintenance of equilibrum, this steady onward

progress keeps one in rhythmic vibrations out of the
reach of these lower planes, into higher planes of
cosmic life, there to constantly tune in with nature's
God on higher planes of consciousness. Far away
from static interference into the safety zone, there to
worship in God's holy temple, to be in constant rap
port with God's universal supply.

LESSON 37
ACRES OF DIAMONDS
"Honor those who have dared to thwart your plans, they
have spurred you onward and given you strength to climb. An
easy voyage down the stream of life would not make a strong
sailor."
The human race with its different
and confusing ideas on truth have all
something of the Divine light as the
diamond is constantly reflecting light
through many facets, Universal Truth
is flashing its glorious rays of light to
the children of man.
It is gradually breaking through
the darkness, reaching those minds
who are open to conviction and really
want the truth.
Souls climbing the mountain
through experiences are gaining know
ledge and however severe it may be, it is the path for
them and is good whether they know it or not, for
every mistake there is a lesson gained. Every problem
solved is a step toward mastership, through it all is dis
covered God's Divine Truths are more valuable than
the most priceless gems. To draw from this supply
one will never be bankrupt. Through this discovery

the path for each soul will be made clear. The final
great truth is, ail are obliged to go through the refining
machine alone.
There are scores seeking truth, like the farmer I
told you of in our book On the Path, who sold his farm
to go out on a search for diamonds and on that same
farm was an inexhaustable diamond mine.
They think if they go to foreign lands and etc.,
they will discover greater truths while within their
own soul will be discovered rich mines of spiritual
ore. When cultivated through their own efforts of
unfoldment the Christ principles through service, will
lead them courageously on where each deed will be
a gem in their own crown through life eternal.
The Road That Leads to Heaven
The majority are searching for the road that leads
to Heaven or the road that is easiest, safest and best
to finally reach eternal life. There is no easy path, even
those who understand the law, are obliged to pay the
price of redemption.
Contentment signifies a mind at peace, this is a
little bit of Heaven without a doubt. With it comes
the realization there are many things in store for the
human family. All being so differently constituted.
Contentment for one would not mean contentment for
another. Some may need very little to make them
happy while others would demand great wealth, travel
or constant amusement to make up what they would
call contentment and happiness.
Another would be satisfied with a little home and
family with enough to eat and something to wear,

money enough to buy the bare necessities of life, not
trying to extend their vision beyond their present
narrow scope.
This is all the outward expression, the psychologist
is he who knows how to find real and lasting content
ment. One is obliged to take the initiary steps
to discover its true origin first from within.
Get right with your God. This inner consciousness
will show one the true meaning of contentment comes
from the realization that service wins them this place
of peace only "By thy words thou shalt be justified
and by thy words be condemned."
One meets up with contentment when the mind is
free and assured of a future place to rest after the
turmoil of earth's existence . "Straight is the gate and
narrow is the way and few there be that find it." This
leads to contentment, the broad way that winds and
winds its way leads to destruction.
Inner Consciousness
If the inner consciousness is at peace all other
things come. How can we find this road, not through
religious beliefs or man-made creeds.
A cartoon I once saw by Cummin, called "The Road
to Heaven," portrayed so well people seeking the many
different paths leading to as many different kinds of
churches, all of course teaching how to reach this
Heaven or Paradise. The guide post naming each
church stood out forcibly upon the pictured path. The
father, mother and children, debating which path to
choose, which church to decide upon. If a wheel of
fortune had been there instead and each would try

his luck on turning it, wherever it would stop on the
name of a church, that one would be as right as an
other perhaps, for as the old saying, all roads lead to
Rome, so all churches aim to lead to God and Heaven.
Churches and creeds are of very little use without
character, for it is the great stepping stone that leads
to the King of Kings in the city of the angels.
If each church were named the path of light the
road to spiritual education and greater wisdom, it
would be found far better than the confusing creeds
and dogmas of the numerous churches today. All pro
fessing to be the right path, also it is very confusing
to the uneducated minds who know not which is right
or wrong.
Scientific Laws of God
It has been prophesied in this new age which we
are now entering the churches will be turned in
to educational institutions where the minds of the
race will be taught the rudiments of learning
first, then will be taught how to know themselves,
to keep their body clean and holy, then how to help
humanity out of the gutters and slums, to rectify their
faults by a clean mind and body, purified by the
scientific law and proper knowledge of thought force.
When becoming acquainted with this law they will
begin to know what to do to save their souls from
sin. Purity of thought will help them to see the path
to choose. Whether to the church with a fiery cross
or none at all; or a place where they can wor
ship God according to the dictates of their own con
science, to think pure thoughts living to walk upon

unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.
With this law obeyed there will be one great wheel
with the spokes leading to the hub the great universal
church of God, where he says, "Come unto me all ye
that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you
rest."
This is a rich gift, a rich promise like unto acres
of shining diamonds in the sweet peaceful fields of con
tentment and a holy life with God the Keeper of the
Temple.
"Sweetly will the blessings of the Masters of light rest upon
you. The words of their wisdom flow to you. The radiant rays of
their illuminated light from spirit guide you. In moments of high
and lofty vibrations will you sense the inner depths of spirit; in
this realization comes the secret joy of God's wondrous peace
and wisdom.

CHAPTER XXXVIII
LESSON 38
HANDICAPED
The sparing sower shall reap sparingly, the generous sower
shall reap plentifully. 2 Cor. 9 :6.
The majority of the race feel they
are handicapped in some form or an-
other. Especially is this true when
:
they are asked to perform some line
of service that means a sacrifice to
them, usually making excuses for
themselves, endeavoring to get out of
their own obligation. Pushing off
their obligations on some one who is
less able to preform it yet who are
always ready to do for others.
Excuse makers may or may not be
physically or materially able to per
form the tasks. God's mirror is the all seeing
powerful searchlight —the tester that is the great
est scrutinizer in the world, from which no one can
morally or physically hide.
Those who are walking in Jesus' steps see no
handicap, they do not ask the way nor where, nor
for conditions to be more equalized. They know
however rough or hard the task is to tackle, it is
the Master's work.

Duty we Owe to God
It is time for all to begin to realize what their
duty is to God and man. One is not placed here for
self enjoyment entirely as many seem to think and
act although one derives great pleasure in doing for
others. I ami constantly trying to impress upon the
mind of all that power is service and happiness is in
giving more than in receiving. "It is to serve,"
(many will not like this idea, but it is true,) be in
terested in the race of life itself, rather than the
goal, selfishness contains the germs of dissolution.
Do you know what Jesus meant when he said, "As
ye do it unto the least of these my children ye have
done unto me." By this he meant service.
Every thing done however small is service if it be
loving service rendered unto the masters of light.
It all will keep the searchlight of the soul polished
and help to overcome the handicap. However try
ing push it aside or forget it, one will be stronger in
the service of love. Without love in the soul very
little worthwhile things can be accomplished with
telling results.
Have you done the best you could with the materi
al you have had to work with or that the handicap
has placed in your way?
You can look about and see the thousands that
have far less advantageous opportunities than your
self perhaps. Have they passed you in race for ac-
cojmplishments?

should never be satisfied; for a satisfied soul does
not grow, this will never do. But perhaps some have
never had a positive goal in view, if not it is surely
time to begin to bend every faculty. Get in the race
and try to achieve that goal. There is a Divine urge
impregnated within the soul sometime in life to dis
cover the place that belongs to them. Push onward
and upward, facing every difficulty with a brave
heart. Permit your ability to be tested, then the
place suited for your especial talent will be shown
you.
One may try many different lines and fail, yet may
discover hidden in the recesses of the soul a talent
that especially belongs to them alone. Many lack
the energy to try out or make another effort after
failing in some one line of endeavor. They should
remember there is an other goal farther on if they
miss the first.
Too many fail to think as they should. Thought
may be a smouldering fire but when fanned into
flame will create for one the power to make their
fortune.
Thomas Edison, working when a boy as a tele
graph operator for six dollars: a week, would never
have been the household word as he is today had
he failed to think, keeping the fires of thought al
ways fanned into a blaze as he worked. Now his

Keep Hope Ablaze
One of the dearest ladies of my acquaintance,
grown ripe in life's many experiences. She was
handicapped from birth. If she had bemoaned her fate,
looking for sympathy (but instead she gave to every
one) she would have had a pityful life of it, giving
up hope of making anything worthwhile of herself.
Her life would have been practically ruined, other
wise she has been a shining light to every one about
her.
Her father, a physician, passed on in early life,
leaving her mother with four small daughters, she
the oldest, although afflicted by the handicap of one
arm being gone, was studious. She went through
school and college, later helping to educate the younger
daughters to where they could help themselves. She
all the time keeping the wolf from the door by her
work and courageous efforts and smiles of hope and
courage toward those about her, those who had
greater physical ability to do than herself.

too shame another with two strong hands.
She was gifted in the sick room and neighbors or
friends at all hours of the night, called to her to
come and help comfort and ease their pain, and now
she is traveling on the sunny slope of life. She smiles
on, thanking God for the many blessings she has had
and for the joy she has been able to bestow upon
others.
Through service you gain power. One learns to
say it is not I but the Father that dwelleth in me. He
doeth the work. Thus Jesus said, ''I go to prepare
a place for you. I will come again and take you unto
myself, that where I am there ye may be also," —
through service.
''We keep discovering God's generosity, He never
takes one thing away that He does not replace in
some other way."
Begin the day with cheer,—Thoughts are things,
so start the day with cheery thoughts and construc
tive ones.
This is God's day, I will do the things that will
keep it filled with light. No angry thoughts shall
enter to disturb my peace—nor to make the day less
bright.
I will give out loving thoughts to any disturbed
soul I chance to meet upon my path. I pray the
memory at the close of day, will fill my soul with
satisfaction and peace.

CHAPTER XXXIX
LESSON 39
WHAT IS HUMANITY SEEKING
"The rarest most difficult courage enables one to recogize
their mistakes; making of them stepping stones for the future."
Humanity is constantly racing on
ward to some imaginary goal ahead.
Some will reach it, others will not.
Is it selfish pleasures only they are
seeking? Is it by chance that they
are here, or were they all sent here
for soul growth, or to get all they can
for self and as the old crude saying
reads "the devil for the hind most?"
Meaning no one else gets considera
tion but self.
Many seem to act as though this
earth was created for their especial
needs and purposes ; that no one should infringe upon
their rights either. While some go along in a degree
of Rip Van Winkle sleep, careing not for any one else
in particular just so their toes are not trampled upon
in the shuffle for existence, taking all, giving nothing
in return.
These aforesaid can be numbered by the thousands,
while a portion of the others we might mention are

trying to live by the golden rule plan, that is the ex
ample left by the Teacher of old, who went about doing
good. These appear hard to locate for they seem few
and far between and are usually looked at with rather
a pitying air as queer or fanatical.
Must our earth have another jolt to awaken hu
manity to their responsibility?
Slow Up
Humanity is going too fast a pace, they seem to
have very little time to stop and consider why they are
here or where they are going from here.
If the majority do not slow up they will find on
awakening into the real life, not even a garment to
cover themselves with, nor even granted a place to stay.
Jesus said, "In my Father's house are many man
sions." There is one being prepared for every one.
May all pray their earthly deeds will be as loving pic
tures in that home that's waiting; although our lives
must be filled with Heavenly grace. This means our
character must be spotless ever showing the God with
in, leading to paths that wind and wind in new dis
coveries of soul advancement.
These mansions are varied in size and material, for
many seem to be sending over very little that can be
used ; while the others are daily adding fresh material
by their loving philanthropy toward humanity.
Stop and ask of self, what kind of material am I
actually providing? What aim I laying up in my bank
for the future life? If we are to judge by appear
ances of some of those we have just now in mind ; they

haven't even laid a foundation. Although God alone
is their judge, we have all we can manage to look to
our own laurels.
I grant there will be much wailing and gnashing of
teeth from the supposed elite when their harvesting
time comes, expecting then just what they always
received while upon the earth; but it will profit them
nothing for there they may be sadly dissapointed if
they have failed in serving the Master. Their record
there will be to take it or leave it, for it is all ac
cording to merit, and they will be their own high judge ;
be it what it may, pray the soul's mirror will reflect
a pure white Christed life.
Unfinished Efforts
One's own conscience tells them if the pages of
life's book is white or if the record is clean and un
tarnished, or if it is filled with deeds and of unfinish
ed efforts.
Each vine of love we plant sometime will send forth
its tendills of beauty.
There is still time to consider life's pages. Begin
anew today with no backward regrets, for one gains
nothing by bemoaning at the eleventh hour the work
left undone or the deeds of kindness left unfinished.
The thing to do is think—what am I doing today, take
an extended trip on your observation car ; you will see
every good act or bad is before you as a mirror re
flecting your image.
It will take a long time to unwind the tangled
threadls of life that have knotted and tied around
one whose great problems and duties have been so

Is it over a precipice into darkness and despair or
into fields of golden promise, with the ffowers of the
soul well nourished by labor in the Father's vineyard.
What is humanity seeking? Happiness or misery?
Either is yours for the choosing. There is joy and
happiness in right doing, for only in this manner can
one hope to reap what they sow.
Permit the light that is yours to shine for others
as you travel the road of life; for it was the lack of
balance and development that caused Judas to become
the betrayer of the Christ.
Keep your lamp filled with the oil of loving kind
ness, live to give and let live; then the register will
read in the final sumtming up of your spiritual assets,
"child of the earth, well done, enter into your reward."
Your cross will become an illumined one and your
crown will be studded with jewels that were constant
ly added by your own good service of love rendered.
All are your equals in spirit, this is easy to discover
when love and faith shines in and become your con
stant guide and daily companion.
When the whole truth, the Divine Light love and wisdom,
gets one in its grasp; the door of Divine supply will swing open,
for we will be givers, and finding ourselves at peace within and
at peace with the world.

LESSON 40
WORRY
"Choose your own life-line. The line that will draw you to
grander, nobler and higher realizations. This is worries blotter."
The most peaceful and illuminating
light that ever shed its rays upon the
human heart is the light of under
standing that comes to the person
who has banished the bugbears of life,
hatred, strife, envy, fear, selfishness
and worry.
For v)orry never has yet helped one
nor got them any place. The energy
and time and force expended in
worry if applied to some constructive
thinking and doing, such as "The
world is mine." I am free to make of
my opportunities what I will. By so doing one at
tracts people and forces that are constructive instead
of destructive for as a man thinketh in his heart so is
he. In his soul he is actually positive, convinced he is
a power unto himself.
Positive and constructive thinking attracts desirable
conditions more and more, keeping one sweet and full
of sunshine. Clean out the stray and useless thoughts

Christ's great high-way of understanding. Finding

Stop worry and crossing bridges until you are posi

as one imagines before hand. In fact, often there will
be none there for with constructive thinking one dis
covers a new way around. We have discovered there
is a place to fill, a duty to perform or one would not be
here. You will find this place if you will be still and
know you are master of your own soul. Fretting and
worry closes out the light while it is trying to shine up
on your pathway.
"Be still and know that all is well for you are a part
of the Divine Plan."
Every one has his problems to solve, sometimes just
a word or an understanding silence from a developed
soul, while the sorrowing one unburdens his heart, will
relieve and calm the wearied soul. He will begin to
see a glimmer of light for the workings of the Infinite

LESSON 41
TRAGEDIES
"If you are not satisfied with yourself, it is never too late
to remodel your thoughts —your character—thus avoiding many
tragedies of life."
There are many tragedies being en
acted behind the four walls of palatial
and pretentious homes. Tragedies in
lowly hovels —upon city streets or
country highways —approximately in
every station in life.
Many are inclined to think because
of the great wealth and beauty of sur
roundings which wealth brings that the
people in such environment may be
perfectly happy therefore many are
covetous and envious begrudging these
their station in life, desiring eagerly
their place. (Don't do it.)
There is a true saying, "in every home there is
a skeleton in the closet." This signifys there is no
one who escapes the tragedies of life. Some are real
ones while others are only in the seeming.
If one has no sorrows, heart aches nor trials—if
all were flowers and sunshine, no clouds, no storms,
of night —this would be a real tragedy, a life fully

continued sameness. The soul tires and the spirit
tries to break the shackles for with no employment or
vocation, nothing at all to do, is a calamity for any
soul. Multitudes of people are found very unhappy
not realizing the cause is, this God within seeking
outer expression.
If one was privileged to see behind the four walls
of the greater portion of the idle rich, seeing the
empty lives there, they would shrink back in horror
and thank God their own life was so filled with vibra
tions of work as well as play.
Liberate yourself from the bondage that holds you
in its grip, for you alone must be your own redeemer.
Every soul can receive just so much help the rest
must be done alone. This is how one becomes the
master of circumstances. Break the shackles of en-
viousness and be grateful for what you have and
what you are. You are the Keeper of thy Temple and
are daily molding your life making it a beautiful and
desirable place to occupy or a daily tragedy, either
is at your command.
If you are given another's place in all probability
it would not be nearly as satisfactory as your own—
although it may be a mansion, a beautiful sight to
see without, yet the inside may be one of sin and
shame or sorrow and despair.
I beseech you never envy another their shoes, they
may fit tighter than your own. Try the best you can
to be reconciled to your place you now occupy. Al
though nights of despair coime—as sure as morning
of a new day dawns, so sure will belssings come some

Through cultivation of your own thought forces, you
learn the law of attracting the good and beautiful.
When the pages of memory is turned back for a
glimpse of the past, one can thank God the former
things are gone. If the present holds better and
brighter things be grateful the current has turned in
your favor. Not forgetting those others whose trag
edies are yet new. Hold out to them the promises of
the future which holds for them also blessings untold
from the promised land, if patience, faith, hope and
love become the watch word, as tragedies make their
grim appearance.
"If our hearts are right, we are a living reflection of the
within.
All are seeking to hide the tragedies of life that burn and
scortch the soul within, caused more often by another's mis
demeanors rather than his own making still they are tragedies
yet would you without the shadows enjoy the sunshine?"

am I actually worth from a spiritual stand-point of
view? This is the immediate question that now faces
one and must be tallied1 up at some future date, per
haps not so far off.
Are You Positive as to Their Standing
Man is what he knows—otherwise he knows not
what he really is and many from appearances, appar
ently do not care. They have not time to be bothered
about knowing anything, but simply desire to exist;
to have all they can eat—sleep as long as they like and
not be bothered about thinking at all. This would
be life for a great majority perhaps; but for others
it would be stagnation and living death.
One should not flatter himself, nor be over confident
as to their own spiritual standing. It would be very
beneficial or profitable if every one would keep a tally
by daily analysis, of what they are actually worth.
For none are perfect, if so there would apparently
seem to be no need to press onward in truth, lest you
go backward ; press onward, for there can be no stand
ing still.
From a material standpoint it may give one a high
standing, making them feel exalted to the degree that
dollars and cents are concerned. While one may be
upon a King's Throne today, tomorrow may be oblig
ed to step out to meet the Throne of judgment.
Then it is when all of the accumulations created
by them, will be tallied up against or for according to
merit. Some may exhibit scorn or contempt at this
idea of merit; you see now in a glass darkly, but then
will all be face to face with this great problem of

find our spiritual bank account above our own expecta
tions.
The greatest question is, will you and I be ready to
meet whatever it is? Remember neglected oppor
tunities will not return to you.
Time lost is never regained. The present is all the
time one is sure of. Ask yourself, "Have I thus far
created that by which my self analysis will show my
worth is actually what I think it is? If doubtful of
a high rating now is the time to begin creating suf
ficient material to pass the test, for tomorrow may
be too late.
Begin by being a harbinger of truth, as John of
old. Teaching others to look to their account and
determine what their standing is and that they also
are creators of their own destiny and are ethically
obliged to give service to be confident of knowing, if
they are actually worth what they think they are.
WORTH WHILE
A tender smile to cheer them,
When the mountain seems so steep.
Or a little word of courage
When troubled waters seem so deep.
Or when the storms of life are roughest;
A courageous smile helps to smooth the waves.
Or just a little love will cheer them,
Helps to smooth the roughest way.
Makes the sun shine o'er troubled waters,
Lifts the burdens hard to bear;
Give this word, or smile to others,
It drives out gloom and deep despair.
Then you've been weighed in the balance finding
You're worth far more, than you may think;
For you have made their lives, well worth the living.
For in the giving you receive
Seven fold with pressed down measure;
For love's labor—you achieved.

If you lack health, faith, love or the conscious

your power of thought. For constructive thoughts

something that may never come or if
it does may not come in their exis
tence. Many mar their life by their
grievances. Every grief which seems
substantial, has various shadows of
one's making.
Shadows fall very easily across one's
pathway if they are inclined to be
drawn toward them.
Keep the shutters open that the sun
light may drive away every passing shadow.
Never allow anyone to pull you into the shadows.
Only in the light can you build constructive thoughts.
Avoid the darkness that holds destruction.
The beautiful trees that shade you from the heat of
the sun have grown for years with no loss excepting
perhaps the loss of their leaves in winter, then when

Why be less content where God is pleased to put
you? Thank God the future is hidden and accept the
seeming mysteries of life as they come with a brave
heart. What lies beyond trust it in God's keeping,
He stands at the helm.
The hardest things to bear may never come to one.
It is the looking forward to the seeming unevitable
that wrecks lives many times. Shut and bar the en
trance against adversities.
The shadows of misfortune are only in our imagi
nation for these shadows are more often a part of our
light if we could but know it.
Scatter the seeming shadows and clouds by your
smile of courage. Face the battles that you daily
meet on the path. You will find others with still
greater problems to solve.
The Orientals say there is no limit to the knowing
of the self that knows. In psychology and scientific
esoteric revelations is discovered the law to higher
attributes of the soul. The key that opens the great
gate on the mystic pathway, whereon is found realiza
tion and illuminations of the super-conscious mind;
the searchlight on the path.
"Then permit what will to come, you, will receive
no harm, unless you think it to be a disaster. It is
within your own power to decide, to know if it be
one, or make of it some future blessing."
"Why permit terror to paint such a grim consequence in
thy mind to see—most all such pictures of imagination which
will all fail to appear."

CHAPTER XLV
LESSON 45
SHOULD PRAYERS BE ANSWERED
Pray not the old way, "Oh God teach me how to die."
Pray the profitable prayer—for self and others —
"Oh God teach me how to live."
Prayer with a great many people
is something to ask for in a material
way. Others give up personal effort
after going to the Infinite source for
aid. One should not forget God must
have personal co-operation in all
things.
One must not yield to fear or per
sonal weakness but go to this great
source with an open mind, with de
termined faith, asking then knowing
the prayer will be heard, recorded
and answered providing it coincides
with God's great plan of things.
The scientific method of prayer would be best. Silence
thy self, then ask your self will it inconvenience anoth
er if my prayer is answered, will it help others as well
as self. If you can answer your self conscientiously
ask "God and the holy Masters of light that they may
see into your soul, if it be the divine will to grant your
prayer. Then with faith let go, thanking the giver of
all good and precious gifts.

Supposing one prays to be made physically well and
are not? It may be that very affliction is the one thing
through which he will receive the lesson intended to
bring him humbly to the foot-hills of greater under
standing of God's unlimited wisdom and power.
It is for him to humbly abide with fortitude the
physical ailment, until the Christ love awakens the
great faculties of his mind, placing in his path the key
that teaches "Man know thy self" and be healed, phys-
icaly, mentally and spiritually.
Or again the petition is for material aid in some
form or other ; whether or not the prayers are answer
ed, be patient for it is all preperation for the final ful
fillment of the law. In this case no amount of prayer
or Heavenly forces can influence or change the current
of one's progress.
The mind has great influence over the physical for
ces, although it cannot perform what the world calls
miracles, but through a strong development will one
combat destructive forces that constantly try to hamp
er any accomplishments of a construceive nature. For
it takes watching and praying and concentrated
thought power to keep the door closed against them.
Prayer in this instance is the combating force that
locks the door against the harming influence.
Aspirations
Keep the aspirations high—aspire to do the right
always. Keeping this motto before the mind, one
will surely be led in paths of truth and by thy power
ful will attract the force and power that can remove
doubt and allay the fears of coming disasters. One's

pathway will be made smoother by trusting always
to this divine light upon the path, arising in mag
nificent splendor; contacting higher rates of vibra
tion and unifying self with God's universal supply;
which is a part of the great plan of the universe.
It makes no mistake.
Listen in silent communion to be guided in divine
wisdom, then speak the word that must be chemicaliz
ed by Divine Love; this heals the soul-sick and broken
hearted.
Pray for soul healing, then the healing of the physic
al body and material conditions will then follow in the
wake of this former accomplishment, clarifying the
mental vibrations.
The mind is a sensitive plate. Jesus said, "Wilt
thou be made whole ? He said, "Behold I stand at the
door and knock, if any man will hear my voice and
open the door (door of the mind) I will come in and
sup with him." He constantly knocks at the door of
thy consciousness, if you would receive, pray and be
lieve then thou wilt receive.
Co-operation With God
God helps those who constantly co-operate with
Him. Then by thinking constructively one helps
gradually to build a perfect physical temple, as well
as proper environments.
Prayer works no magic transformation, but it sets
in motion proper thought forces that obey natural law
through gradual processes. The essential thought is
to know the thing concentrated upon, or you are pray
ing for, is really going to be good for you, or for the

good of others, as I have before stated. When this
is the case it is creative and will bring good results.
The law of retribution or justice is sure; what one
puts into the vibrations returns unto its own; one
must become an open channel for good only.
Many in the orthodox world will think it sacri
legious to speak of scientific prayer; although a truth
student is fully conscious there is a vast difference
between scientific prayer and a haphazard or auto
matic prayer, simply praying without feeling. By
directing one's thoughts conscientiously and system
atically upon the good object sought we place the mind
in harmony with the universal mind and in tune with
the Infinite; starting up a vibration of thought force
and power that accomplishes lasting results. This is
co-operation with the psychological laws of God and
the higher attributes of the soul.
This universal power (God power) is constantly
seeking to express itself in service. It seeks the open
channels where it finds greater activity, always en
deavoring to do good. To be a greater service to
mankind.
One becomes obedient and receptive to this influence
by constantly purifying and chemicalizing the
thoughts, thus one is en rapport with God's goodness
and in at-one-ment with universal supply.
"Constantly pray to raise the fallen and to heal the
sick in both body and mind."
Pray only for today's need. If God sees fit, you

forces, thereby you can create for yourself your de
sires providing they coincide with God's plan of things.
Pray truth be thy watch word,
Wisdom thy guiding star —
Lit by the fires on the altar of love.

From star to start out upon the ether waves,
From sphere to sphere, thy power will be felt.

LESSON 46
GIVE AND TAKE
"Give and take —this is the great Universal law of succes."
If there is an effort made to attain
something worth while, it is never lost.
Strive to win something if it is only
the esteem and appreciation of those
around you, neighbors, friends,
strangers, all, including self will to a
greater degree be made better ami
happier. Endeavor then to keep what
you have won.
Be considerate of another's faults,
no one thing does human life need
more. Scatter pearls of loving thoughts
among those who need comfort. May
none ask and be turned away ; have a heart that is ten
der, a temper that never hurts, nor be too weary to lift
a soul out of the mire if they call. In other words let
your daily actions speak loud of loyalty to the human
family.
You become a banker adding to your account as
you take the daily opportunity to help those less for
tunate. Thus does one continually draw the wealth of
love and justice through the law of compensation.

"Good efforts are the living keys that open the floors to

* * *
GIVING
Give a loving smile of courage —to another;
When mountains seem so steep.
Or a little word of kindness to a brother
When troubled waters seem so deep.
When storms of life seem roughest;
A word or smile, may calm the waves.
Or help bear without a murmur,
To tread life's rough or toilsome way.
It makes the sun shine much the brighter;
Lightens burdens hard to bear.
Give those smiling words of courage;
It helps to drive away despair.
Your own life will be worth the living;
For one receives in the giving
Seven-fold, with pressed-down measure;
God's own rarest, richest treasures.

CHAPTER XLVII
LESSON 47
BLESSINGS
"If the body is in harmony, the soul can evolve and the
spirit express its God-hood, as the soul evolves the spirit doth
infill."
Selfish desires must be banished.
Live in a world where the soul object
is endeavoring to boost the human
family on and upward to higher and
nobler realization of life. One's own
soul light will become magnified by co
operation.
The soul is the spiritual ego, through
the spiritual vibrates the Diviner
harmonies of life. Spirit is the soul's
light, through our spirit we recognize
our oneness with God. From God
colmes only good and perfect gifts.
Awaken to this mighty truth then does one arise
and praise God for all past and present blessings
and go on with trusting God for future ones.
An effective plan to eliminate discouragements is
gratitude. For in counting the numerous blessings
one discovers the pathway of life has more flowers
than weeds and their fragrance is found a magic dis-
peller of the unwelcome guest, discouragement.
One can never accomplish anything while in its
grip for it paralizes every effort and stupifies the
power to think. It becomes a target for disease and
diseased mind means a diseased body.
"Take daily God's healing draughts of love, it gives courage
and countless blessings with perfect Health and untold Hap
piness."

May our life be so filled with valiant deeds that we will
be glad to leave our foot-prints behind.

Rule in this specific instance? Many advocate the
view that it would be inappropriate and would annoy
certain people to treat them exactly as we should
like to be treated. Every soul is inseparably bound up
in some form or other with others in all life's mani
fold relationships. As hard as one may try they
cannot live by self alone for their manner of living
effects others beside themselves. The Golden Rule
means you are to be square with all humanity. Hon
orable and decent for decency's sake, doing good to
ward others and enthusiastical in your endeavors for
good fellowship and brotherly love. As ye sow so
shall ye reap.
Are You a Servant of Humanity?

you gave me drink, was naked and you gave me
clothes, was sick, you ministered unto me in prison,
you came to me with words of cheer, I was a stranger
and you gave me a home."
One is obliged to have a certain degree of spiritual
development and moral teaching, sufficient to be
sympathetic and comprehensive to serve as a bonds
man for God toward the human race with a great deal
of compassion, patience, perservance, courage and a
stalwart stamp of loving forbearance.
The great foundation for the true brotherhood of
man must be grounded upon the rock strong as

"Charge them who are rich in this world that they

6:1-17.
When one harms another or wounds by thought or

words of love and helpfulness. Assist those who are

Ragged, uncomely, and old and gray,
A woman walked in a Northern town;
And thru the crowd as she wound her way
One saw her loiter and then stoop down,
Putting something away in her gown.
"You're hiding a jewel!" the watcher said.
(Ah, that was her heart, had the truth been readl)
"What have you stolen?" he asked again.
Then the dim eyes filled with a sudden pain,
And under the flickering light of the gas
She showed him her gleaning. "It's broken glass,"
She said, "I hae lifted it up frea the street.
To be oot o' road o' the bairnies feet?"
Under the fluttering rags astir
That was a royal heart that beat!
Would that the world had more like her,
Smoothing the road for the Barnies' feet)

LESSON 49
ENERGY
"The success achieved on all plains of life is produced by
the use of nerve force and energy with patient endurance,
stick-to-itiveness and with determination to win by all odds."
WHY IS ENERGY A SEEMING MYSTERY?
An important step in reserving en
ergy is to control the internal nature
or mind and senses. This is accomp
lished through the practice of con
centration and meditation, uniting all
the forces of power into one concen
trated energy. Then through patience
and constant endeavor one stores up
energy and builds for the future. It
turns the fly-wheel of fortune, and
it is essential what ever the goal, in
any line of endeavor ; for one is oblig
ed to keep a reserve supply of stored
up energy for every emergency.
For when energy is fully exhausted, numerous neg
ative conditions can make their appearance both in
the mental and physical world. Then not only is
energy needed to be a success in the commercial world
but also in every line of endeavor that needs thought
concentration.

Power is Stored up Energy
With this stored up energy and with the proper use
of all the mental faculties, one may accomplish in
finitely more than at present. If one would use these
faculties properly or develop even a small portion of
them as they should be, there is scarce a limit to one's
capabilities.
In the past men were forever limiting self. Fear
of failures in all lines of endeavor were their con
stant nightmare. The present day, thinkers have be
gan at least to realize the larger vision, seeing into
the future before them greater possibilities; for
through awakened knowledge it constantly reflects its
lucid rays.
The last great discoveries have awakened the race
more than any other previous ones with the conscious
realization that thought can be sent across the con
tinent without connecting wires, the potentialities of
man are being realized as never before.
We are Entering a New Age
In this new age just being entered upon men are
obliged to realize their unlimited power and energy.
This must be put into use in uplifting and aiding
humanity for the betterment of its conditions.
One of the most beautiful traits of courage is its
evenness and serenity. For wasted energy is caused
by scattered forces of power. Through anger the
vibrations is lowered, this quickly weakens the
strength and burns up energy and force. But energy

and force with calmness and poise are needed for emer
gencies of life. These are our reserve forces in the
battle of life.
Cosmic energy (the all prevading universal reality)
acts according to the quality of which we are con
scious. One should not doubt but simply trust in the
God power. This will bring a person in touch with
cosmic energy.
One may possess the acquisitiveness and a natural
capacity to do things, yet still permit possibilities to
forever lie dormant, needing some urge or word of
encouragement from another to fan them into action.
Fear is Failure
THE THING I FEARED HAS COME UPON ME
The fear of failure is a powerful and destructive
form of thought. To be fully conscious of power and
know that thought is energy, enables one to be
an overcomer for he knows the storehouse of supply,
the Fatherhood of God, and that God is able to do
exceedingly and abundantly more than man can ask or
think.
A poverty stricken soul, hasn't time to think, or
freedom to think, nor the physical energy to direct
thoughts into channels of constructiveness and power;
or the ability of reserving strength and force.
"Those who think—know, God—love—law and
energy is the cause of which man is the effect, for
cause is the principal of all life."

God's Forces of Energy
Jesus understood thoroughly the law of energizing
and regeneration. This was his success in his mar
velous healing. He constantly drew his supply from
the great storage battery, God and his forces of
energy. This is the power and revitalizing thought
force that builds anew.
"For every house is builded by someone —but He
that built all things is God." Heb. 3:4.
Our body is only our earthly tenement house (some
times a tumbled down one) , an inn by the side of the
road. We live in this habitation for a time to learn
earth's varied experiences and preparation for the
higher stage of existence.

A developed soul has the knowledge
of accomplishments, taking prepara

habitation.
Therefore one does not truly live un
less he is actually doing all that he can
in the way of good works permitting
no ability nor energy to be wasted.
Therefore a psychologist builds and
constructs; he knows the art of con
serving and directing energy.
If we would receive we must open
the door to giving, it is advisedly nec

intact, a few of which are, instinct, intuition, intellect,
inspiration, illumination, discrimination. These must
be well Christed through the use of energizing of
life's forces.
That all these attributes may be well developed,
a soul is required to be well attuned to the diviner
things of life. Living in the atmosphere of high vibra
tions through a Christ developed consciousness.
Directing Energy
A small ten-cent horse-shoe magnet can hold a steel
pin. A great electric magnet can hold and transport
a giant locomotive, this is energy. The power within
determines our holding power and the energizing force
contacted from the storage battery, the universe.
The Use of Occult Power
In useing occult power, one is not dealing with vague
uncertainties or possibilities, but with nature's power
ful forces. Deal with them justly and lovingly, with
consideration as you hope to receive divine justice, and
bring it into submission to your will.
The blacksmith fans his fire with the great bellows,
useing force and energy; bringing it to a desired heat ;
then placing a bar in this great heat and force, it is
communicated to the iron. The iron is removed and
by powerful blows it is hammered into the desired
shape.
There is within the blacksmith's mind an image of
what he hopes it will assume and in response to his
visualization it is modeled to the desired form or shape.

Within our life is that great energetic force wait
ing the urge of a clear visualization to fan it into
outer expression, through desire of the soul.
Energy can be transformed in numerous and vari
ant ways; yet it is never lost, nor got rid of except
as it is given forth to something else.
It is found that everything in existence from the
highest of spiritual beings, to the very lowest densest
rocks and minerals in the earth beneath our feet, are
mediums for transmitting different and distinct forms
of energy. The same total of energy always remain
ing the same; yet this same energy through distribu
tion is never lost.
We are also magnets and in agreement to our con
stant drawing and understanding ability, are constant
ly receiving our portion of this great and glorious
energizing power that builds a perfect mind and body.
Energy creates power, energy creates success, en
ergy creates money and friends, for energetic people
get there every time.
Energize your work, your talk, your walk, make
yourself a live force of energy; then you have created
a personality of power.
A necessary requisite for bringing occult power and
life energy into activity is to have specified times
for silent meditation and concentration with powerful
and illumined thought affirmations, to touch the mas
ter minds who are daily instructors and inspirers, if
vibrating in harmony with them; for all are magnets,
like attracts like.

LESSON 52
THE LABORATORY OF CONSTRUCTION
"When one spends a greater portion of his time, pulling
weeds from his neighbor's garden; he has no time to cultivate
his own and will soon discover his choicest flowers of the soul,
choked by weeds and thistles there to smother and die."
As the need of rain and moisture
dwarf and kill out flowering shrub
bery and vegetation, just so sure will
one discover that negative thoughts
and1 the results of mental and physical
illness, prevents mental growth. It
causes a warped consciousness; while
positive thoughts strengthens the will

mind and body; this is why positive
affirmations for health and success
are an aid to negative minds.

There is a poison that can fill the mind and can
cause infection ; this is suspicion, or perverted imagi
nation—a whisper of a may-be-so, if fanned by the
breezes it flares up, burns and scorches like a slow
fire.
Oft times this gossip and suspicion may not be
known as an actual fact. Although this may-be-so is
growing fast and furious ; for it resembles weeds grow
ing, like them, stronger with its rankness, taking
finally actual thought form. For like the weed or
flower it has invisible strength and force pushing it
onward into beauty or ugliness; therefore is one con
structing or destroying according to the working
knowledge and application of thought force.
The Refining Machine
On every hand one can see tender shoots of chil
dren; often a sensitive or benevolent, loving soul,
may immediately send out the prayer or thought,
"Oh, Father divine, wilt thou securely protect these
children from every icy blast that blows. Put a fence
securely about them, a body guard as it were to pro
tect them."
It is not necessary to do this, for in the working out
of God's divine law, each individual soul is obliged to
go through their own refining machine. Although it
is only natural and humane to send forth loving pray
ers to God for His loving care over His children; yet
God is constantly caring for His own.
If a child burns his fingers in a fire he quickly dis
covers his mistake, and is not likely to repeat the

same performance again. All these experiences are
lessons; otherwise they might have at some future
time a more serious accident.
Take for instance two children playing around a
rose bush; one may stick his fingers upon a thorn
and cry out in pain ; while the other will enjoy the rose
bush and see only the beautiful blossoms. Or again
some one may fall over an object in their pathway
and remove it ; or if asked why they did not do so may
reply, "I shall let them get the same experience I did,
then they will learn their lesson as I did."
It may seem rather unfeeling or severe, but it is
found very true that experience is the best of all teach
ers whereby every one, be he old or young is obliged
to work out his own problems, solve his own lessons of
life if he would hope for soul expansion.
Harvested Results
Every one is obliged to cultivate his own soil of the
soul; sowing and reaping the harvested results of his
own efforts. This is not a new psychology of thought
or procedure but as old as time ; for no one can hope
to sow rankness, and reap perfection.
When one studies closely God's glorious work of
nature; he discovers the different stages, are all
chemical changes. As the mind of man, body and
soul are constantly working toward a perfect realiza
tion and at-one-ment with Divine Truth.
In the course of events one personally desires to
cultivate more beautiful flowers than weeds; this is a

natural consequence, although it all depends upon the
cultivation of the seed sown; but in God's construc
tion house all were meant for flowers.
All are constantly evolving through space of time,
although no one appear able to judge, or to say just
how old or how young one really is. But when one
understands divine law in its entirity, he will no long
er wonder why—when we say, why pick off the
thorns? They will know.
Thorns are Lifes Lessons
As the sunlight filters and finds its way through
nooks and crannies; so do experiences gradually sow
better environments. If these thorns are taken as life's
lessons; for each one like a drop in the great ocean
becomes a live force if submerged.
Take care of self, self preservation is the first law
of life; for then one is properly fit to look after other
fellow beings. Acquire the knowledge and wisdom of
the beautiful flower state, sending out beauty, color
and cheer ; giving an incentive to others to be similar.
Yet not in a bigoted way of, "See how I grow," but,
"How sweet is the humble violet."
One cannot compel a soul to be wholly a weed ; how
ever rank the environment. For the moment one
awakens realizing they are a living identity, they be
gin to mold their life either in the light or in the dark
ness, that is to be either a weed or a flower; for it
must grow from the root upward. Although it can
not possibly be any worse weed or flower than the
root itself made it. All depends entirely upon the

the mineral kingdom, vegetable, animal and the king
dom of man are in the rates of vibration.
One often discovers weeds are in disguise, like the
poison ivy, beautiful to look upon, but those who have
had experience know the sad results.
Through soul unfoldment one learns the true art of
discrimination; this an occult student is obliged to
learn on all planes of life, lest they discover many pit
falls.
One Grows Through Suffering
Use your own developed sense perception; your
analysis should show how much poison, malice, envy
or hate is there.
No child or person on earth is wholly perfect, neith
er are they wholly bad. As rain is a blessing, it also
causes destruction. One would not ask God to entire
ly stop the rain, nor to obliterate the scorching sun;
but would rather cry, give to us the light radiance of
the sun even if we suffer from its rays.
Put your self in the hands of the loving Father, to
be cultivated in the laboratory of construction, for
he knows best and doeth all things well.
It is not by suplication nor crying in loud prayers
that the soul reaches the meridian of perfection;
but through labor and loving service toward other
human beings less fortunate than your self; that the
heights, depth and breadth of growth are reached.
It depends entirely upon one's own efforts what the
harvested results will be. It is through developing,
producing and refining that every soul alone becomes

hind, permitting the bud of divine wisdom to unfold
and blossom forth into a beautiful flower to adorn the
soul's garden.
Jesus speaking in parables said of a farmer having
great fields of ripening grain, on observation he saw
many stalks bent and broken. He said do not save the
stalks with broken blades. Go forth and cut and burn
them. After a time he went to measure the grain,
but not a kernel could be found. He inquired of the
harvesters where is my grain? They answered, we
did according to your word, gathered and burned the
broken blades and not one stalk remained. Then Jesus
said, if God saves only those who have no broken
blades, who have been perfect in his sight, who will
will be saved and the accusers hung their heads in
shame.
The rarest flowers of the soul's garden are purity,
uprightness, then with faith, hope and love in the
fore-ground, its divine essence is strengthened and
its quickening power reaches to the furthermost
corners of the globe. Its influence sails forth on the
etheric waves reaching throughout all space and for
all eternity.
If you stop one heart from breaking;
Or save one life the taking or sooth one pain;
Or help one soul to see life's fairer gain,
You have not lived in vain.

HEALTH AND HAPPINESS
"If your life is filled with soul beauty, it is bound to radiate

one is obliged to think beauty, health

beautiful thoughts of love and power.
Philips Brooks has said, "No man
has come to true education who has
not felt in some degree that his life belongs to his race
and that what God has given him, he has given for
humanity."
Happiness can be acquired by cultivation of right
principles; when followed unerringly, life becomes a
gift from Heaven.

a short road to joy and gladness.

LESSON 54
INTUITION
Keep the thought polisher busy that no blemish will appear
to mar the clean spotless beauty of the soul window.
Intuition or sense perception is a
sixth sense. Although it does not
come under the head of the five sens
es. For intuition is instinctive knowl
edge or feeling. Immediate percept
ion is sense perception.
Discernment, correct judgment,
moral perception; these three are
necessary in the act, state or faculty
of receiving knowledge.
Where the faculties of the brain
cells are highly developed, one is
able to sense and know things as they
really are. This intuitive faculty is a wonderful gift
if used correctly. When misused or misunderstood
it is the cause of much misplaced judgment.
One calls the voice of intuition the voice of God
speaking. Go often into the silent sanctuary; there
listen and heed the call, for it comes to counsel, com
fort and strengthen one in life's many trials.

A Developed Consciousness
If a mind is fully developed in Christ conscious
ness, it becomes big and liberal. ''Small minds have
little room for generosity." This is true because
their soul growth is dwarfed and stunted. They dis
like intensly to see another rise. Such a feeling be
comes the forerunner and cause of mischief and
grief.
Put a mind of this caliber in a club, lodge, or
church organization; then see how quickly their
small narrow-gage mind, seeing through their small
er vision, discovers things to feel hurt over and find
time to go forth scattering chaff, where wheat should
be sown. While a mind of larger vision, developed
in sense perception and soul culture, understands,
knows and sees only good.
This is because God's high fence of protection and
power surrounds and shields them. Through their
own developed power of intuition they can truly say,
''Father forgive them."
These souls stand enveloped in their own great
illumined rays of power. One discovers this is a
part of the soul's unfolded consciousness. For
through this intuition is revealed the truth; who are
enemies, who are not, when to say yes, when to say
no. This psycho-analysis of self and of others is the
science of psychology and power of knowing the
truth.
Some are born with this gift; others must aquire it
through study and developing the mental faculties,
bring each up to an equal high degree.

I can and I will. I open my mind to a greater
knowledge of Divine Laws. I am an open channel
for the Inflow of the Father's Love and Wisdom: I
recognize His Power in all—and Through all. My
awakening consciousness now is absorbing His un

Wealth and Divine Supply through the ever flowing
stream from God's great store house. I am sub

Through the shrine of Silence, I give thanks unto the

The master key tells us, the real secret of power
is the consciousness of Power. Become conscious of
that inexhaustible power in the world within.
Get in tune with infinite vibrations ; a good receipt
is,— be loving, noble, charitable; love to give as well
as receive; foster no ill, be over-comers, forgive and
above all else learn to forget.
To see the path of light, is to be conscious of power. This
is the science that makes psychology work for you.

For the majority, life holds a mixture of farce,
comedy or empty parade, tragedy and moving pictures,
that are enacted before life's camera. In these series
of daily performances is found every thing under the
sun in sorrows and trials innumerable. All of which
can be changed through the power of thought, into
performances of construction that will build and draw
the world in homage to thy very feet.

DEVELOPED CONSCIOUSNESS
A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
which he possesseth: but rather in the power and life energy
One's life consists in what the soul
possesses then gives. To receive a full
transportation into a higher state, is
to seek the Ways and Means Commit
tee which is found through the esoteric
door of the soul. Through whose win
dows, one visions God's rich promises.
Through concentration of thought
forces, does one gather force and pow
er glimpsing the beauty and charm
that come through silent meditation.
Through this developed conscious
ness, one then subsequently discovers
the subtile substance that is a part of God's creation
and on every hand can one vision the great abundance
of nature's store-house. Through this new found
treasure-house of marvelous wisdom comes an illumin
ed and radiant light ; revealing all are perfect by God's
own handiwork.

It is not a fairy tale, but all divinely true for it

race to explore, understand and to conquer.
"Life is not all a smooth road; but is found still
rougher, when tempted to detour."
Through the analysis of life is discovered, the ma

A soul often finds he himself started the cause,
whereby he is bound to reap the effect.
Concentration—Affirmation

of the universe through concentration. Making a cen

THE MEASUREING SCALES OF YOUTH
How beautiful is youth I How bright it gleams,
With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!
Book of beginnings, story without end,
Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend.
—Longfellow.
The world and all life is beautiful,
seen through the eyes of youth. With
their vision of the expected and beau
tiful voyage ahead; for youth has
many illusions and much valuable time
is spent in day dreaming. Although it
is work and earnest efforts alone that
make these dreams come true.
The foundation of future success
with its joyous realities, must be
built in the present; therefore it must
be well mixed with a growing under
standing and a keen visualization of
future possibilities, on which aspirations become real
ization.
In youth the days pass all too slowly, they are con
stantly looking forward in anticipation to birthdays
or holidays, that they may dance and make merry or

that they may become old enough to enter into their
dreams of undertakings to build the castles of their
present day dreams.
As one grows older (in years only, for the spirit is
ever the same) each day comes the realization, if one
will stop in the mad rush long enough to take note,
that they are drawing nearer the mysterious valley of
uncertainty to many, and dire dread to others, of the
seeming shadow of death. Dear ones, this is but the
open door-way to the life beautiful, if lived well while
here.
Yet does one wish on that his days and years may
be lengthened.

than themselves.

through the gleaning process, where the brain becomes
an engine for constructive thinking.
By the supremacy of their high and lofty ideas, one
is sure to come into their own on some plane of life.
For in the process of the soul's evolution one is oblig
ed to keep watch constantly, pruning away the defects
as they appear. This means daily self analysis. The
youth of today asks, is life really worth the struggle,
what does life lead to? They should, by all means,
be taught in their educational work, both self analysis
and the -power of thought. That it not only rules their
own life's actions, but affects all those whom they
associate with. Teach them the psychology of right
thinking, that it builds character and molds their life
into whatever they choose to make of it.
If a student of truth, how glorious it is to climb
understanding^ step by step toward the mountain top
of greater knowledge; there to view the panorama
of their past efforts and gradually see with still broad
er vision the greater truths of life unfolding to view
and with joy press on toward still greater heights of
unfoldment and of greater service to humanity.
There must be a personal effort, and striving to un
derstand by one's self; using one's own creative
initiative, perception; thus building for soul culture
and expansion.

durance, and when the present condition is worked
out, and its lessons learned therefrom, something
better will present itself; for as the smallest bolt is
so essential to the greatest dynamo to make it perfect,
in like manner does every soul become a part and
necessary to God's plan.
Each soul makes its own limitations by its thinking.
If all could see God's plan as it actually exists, gov
erned by divine law they would wish to have nothing
changed knowing that the eternal plan of God's wis
dom is altogether perfect.
"A new age is born." An idea is born in a young,
pliable mind then comes the growth of fixity, but if the
mind is allowed freedom, there is constant growth.
Permit old ideas and old culture, the old age of things,
to die, as they served time and purpose. Then the new
age is born. Today comes a new civilization, new
achievements a new basis for thought is born ; in this
new era—not a new God, but a greater and newer inter
pretation of the old; for the eyes of coming genera
tions will see him in all things, within and without,
there the spark of the divine is ever found.
Work on in thy own sphere of existence, although
limited as to resources. When you have done the best
that you could and have laid down the implements of
service, to take your work on the next sphere of ex
istence, some one else will pick it up where you left off
here to go on with it.
Perhaps they are more capable, or can more fully
perfect your ideals. They may have better resources
to draw from. Yet many jewels will be in thy crown,
if you did your best.

Sons- of God
Beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not
yet appear, what we shall be, but we know that when
he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see
him as he is. 1 John.
Try to realize the truth, that all are now the sons of
God and should awaken this God perfection within
themselves. From youth to old age, one is on the path
of evolution or progression; constantly leading on
ward through its varied avenues toward the final
goal, perfection, that many are searching for, but few
find it, the cause being the lack of proper understand
ing of direction of thought. That takes one to the
mountain top of transfiguration, or to the depths of
despair.
It is imperatively necessary the younger generation
that are to come must be a thinking race, and an un
derstanding one, that is far reaching, broadening
their mental faculties becoming more progressive,
thus reaching more of an equilibrium. They are now
no longer willing to sit still and be told by ministers
or priests to do thus and so, or they will be eternally
damned. They are going to know for themselves if
this is true.
Cork-Screw Minds
God has invented the cork-screw mind of the youth
today. They will find out, they are discovering things
our forefathers never dreamed of. They must know
for themselves. They will pull out the cork, let it
explode if it will, never mind they will find what is
there. It is right they should.

LESSON 58
SEEK FRESH MANNA
No one is happy who cannot think for himself.
Too long people have been fed upon
the worm-eaten manna of past ages.
Today they are seeking to gather fresh
:
manna from the fields of science that
is superior for present day activities.
That will enable them to seek out their
own great kingdom, to know whereof
they speak. They shall know the
truth. For the truth will set all free.
The past centuries have been filled
to overflowing with experiences and
conditions that fettered and bound
humanity to worn out creeds and
dogmas or superstitions of various kinds. They are
bursting the shell of fetter and chain that bound ; dis
covering they need no longer look to the past, except
ing for the lessons and experiences it contained.
As one evolves onward evolution's progressive train
is continuously bringing about wonderful changes and
world successes, constantly bringing new ideas, new

knowledge and guidance, but to the present age for
their light and wisdom.
Every where is manifested greater opportunities
for the younger generations, that our forefathers
could never have dreamed of or visioned. If the pres
ent generation patterned after them where would evolu
tion be today? When through proper education, the
present youth reaches the enlightened period, discover
ing that all power comes from within; they have dis
covered the key that unlocks the door to the great
reservoir of knowledge. Where it substitutes wisdom
for ignorance and joy for sorrow.
All are links in the chain of God's great universe;
it is for each one to perfect their link by duty, love,
service and obedience to that still small voice of God.
These are his precepts and when followed, will carry
one on the wings of success, throughout all life.
In this new and progressive age called the new era,
the youth is obliged to observe more closely and to
think scientifically, realizing their thoughts alone lead
them into paths of progress or they are dragged down
ward into pitfalls made by their own negative think
ing.
The manna that feeds the great multitudes today,
must be (man know thy self) and faith in Him who
fed the multitude with five loaves of bread and two
fishes. John 9:14. Living to be worthy of the beau
tiful that surrounds those who live in the direct path

We receive in exact proportion to what we give.
Those who receive little give little, this is a just law.
If we give smiles to the world, we will receive smiles
in return. It becomes habitual.
If we try to love the world and every body in it,
we will discover the vibrations resound in good fellow
ship with the world's treasures near at hand, in the
good and beautiful. It is of greatest aid in the influence
of character building and in moulding a happy and use
ful life.
THE MEASURING SCALES
To speak, and walk uprightly in His path,
God gives each one to choose;
The measuring scales held in His hand at last,
Show justly, if we lose.
At last where men must pay,
Alack, the balance true.
What words and deeds shine forth to greet your face—
What grace of God awaits to welcome you?

LESSON 59
POWER OF THE WORD
And I say unto you, that every idle word that man shall
speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
For by thy worda thou shalt be justified, and by thy worda thou
shalt be condemned. Matt. 12:36, 37.
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established
unto thee; and a light shall shine upon thy ways.
When they cast thee down, thou shalt say.
There is lifting up; and the humble person he will save. Job
22:28, 29.
There is to be found in words mar-
ous beauty, power and force. Not
alone in their agreeable sound, nor
in the rhythm, or melody of their ut
terance. The real sublime beauty of
words is discovered in a visual value.
All have seen the one word smile
given a conspicuous place and invar-
rably, we do smile. The suggestion
of that one word starts up a psycho
logical and vibratory influence upon
the sensorium or brain cells.
It is discovered that through just
this one seeming simple little word smile starts up
a vibratory force for good.

hungry human hearts. It would be very advanta
geous to keep hanging on the walls of our homes and
offices as well; this word, with our old fashioned
mottoes, old yet ever new "Love ye one another" and
many powerful words that suggest truth, love and
good fellowship. Along with success, power, cour
age, happiness, honor, determination and aspiration:
All embrace and resemble truth and suggest bigness
and broadness of vision. They fill our being with
desire for power.
With words like these daily facing one, it becomes
easier to center upon one or many of them, this sets
up a current of vibratory thought waves that con
stantly help toward character building.
Contemplate the Words of Jesus
As He healed through love, those who were
brought to Him to be healed, and when He spoke to
the little children ''Suffer the little ones to come unto
me ;" we can see His face carry a soft loving smile ;
can visualize the loving expression, the sentiment
expressed upon His noble countenance.
One can picture mentally the different expressions
portrayed upon the face, when speaking words such
as, I love you, or I hate you. For words can make
one beautiful, when they reflect thoughts of love
and beauty, or can make one hideous when reflect
ing upon thoughts of hatred or malice. Our foun
dation must be grounded upon the rock of divine
love. If built upon the sand one does not compre

mentally can one live the Christ principle —and His
words become a power.
The names of our great leaders and benefactors
of the world today and past ages inspire us with a
courage to climb upward.
The greatness of words to a comparative degree,
with greatness of thoughts, makes you what you are.
One should weigh their words in the balance;
make each one count if possible. Be a power unto
thyself. The world is living all too fast, in this short
existence for idle words. Rather let thy utterance
be yea and nay.
Every time one thinks a thought of truth, or speaks
a loving word, it is adding one more word of faith to
the mental garden energy, which builds for power,
spiritual efficiency, energy and nerve force.
Every time one repeats a strong affirmation, in
words for strength, prosperity, or health; which are
real attributes of the soul; one is formulating the
quality of mental energy that the soul requires ; caus
ing it to become stronger and more powerful. Grow
ing into a perfect manifestation in newness of life,

Sometimes stomach trouble, a bad head ache, or

body can live under can attack one whose mind is

To abbreviate in short, every thought which en

Therefore, effects the whole physical anatomy,

Already we have discovered words or thoughts

good thoughts; therefore, speaking good words

for the future life, constructive loving thoughts: pro
duces constructive loving words. "As the thoughts
of the sculptor visualizes: then molds the perfect
images: so every word spoken, has a direct effect upon
the physical body.
The duration of our time here is all too limited
and valuable to waste it in the things which have no
lasting value. When all have to give an account of
their idle words and time, can they say my time was
wholly given in loving words and efficient service for
the Master who gave me life? Stop for a moment
and ask yourself how far have I paid my debt?
Then affirm : The glory of the Christ consciousness
is now awakened within me! It quickens and illumines
me. Constructive thoughts and words, through di

with success on all planes of life, for divine love ad

Many times a great truth is hidden in that which we dislike.
Again, many times a great truth lies in small things; therefore
too often goes unnoticed. The smaller leads to the greater. The
small word love when put into action, can calm the troubled
waters of the soul. It can stop wars and bring about world broth
erhood all of which combines for a world peace.

bravely and patiently teach humanity
to carry their own with the same forti
tude.
Through knowledge of the basic
principles of God's divine laws, will
these discover their own destiny
is
be
ing daily carved by patient fortitude
and perseverance toward the principles of life's
duties, that constantly confront one on the path.
They gradually discover the great principle of the
all creative force in existence

creates into outer expression our desires,

properly
directed.
All are obliged to sow today for the future harvest.
The farmer knows very well he must keep his choic
est seed to sow that his harvest will be one worth the
reaping.

Give your choicest seed of truth to hungry human
ity; for he who sows will reap accordingly, this will
be his living witness.
Through this great and glorious compensation law
comes the harvested results. The growth that never
fails to produce a bounteous harvest.
Thus is he cultivating harmonious and desirable
conditions, with the avenue open for prosperity and
spiritual attainment.
Exercises for Freedom
Enter the silent sanctuary, there utterly relax, let
the walls of God shut in, away from the tumult and
the constant din. Then be sure it is not from a self
ish motive you are concentrating, but for a greater
enlightenment and freedom for self and for others,
then the cosmic power acts quickly in bringing into
manifestation your unselfish desire. Tell God all
about it, then place all on the altar and forget about
it. This can be done if you have faith enough. In
breathe deeply from the solar plexus, let go, physic
ally and mentally then you will sense spiritual free
dom.
Get acquainted with God the Father; open full
wide the entrance-door to the soul. Give full surren
der, and there talk with Him as you would with a
loving father. Ask in full faith believing and receive
thy full deliverance.

CHAPTER LXI
LESSON 61
UNAWARES
"Illuminate our way Masters of Wisdom; Give us The
harmonious radiance to see the sublime light of Thy presence —
ever near."
Watch and work as well as pray.
"For faith, if it have not works is
dead." This prayer on every turning
point of the way should be uttered—
"What wilt Thou have me do?" Or
still better, "What wilt Thou have me
do for others?" Forget thy own
existence in loving service, then peace
and joy will be mingled with thy every
burden. For the only real richness is
gained by what is given away.
Emerson said, "The thing I hold
is the thing I lose."
Be awake to your every duty for if you are found
asleep at the switch you will be responsible for the
train loads of humanities freightage being wrecked.
Will you turn the switch that gives them the right-of-
way to the station of understanding and light or will
you permit them unawares to pass into the open switch
of darkness and misery?

"Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiv
ing your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word
and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his
natural face in a glass, for he beholdeth himself and
goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what man
ner of man he was." James 1 :22-24.
The greatest of all habits is the habit of self, the
one who can control himself can control others, in pro
portion to their mental power they also control their
own destiny.
In life's great immensity one is apt to let the best
aims slip by; unheeding, unhelping, while there are
myriads of souls hungering and thirsting for grains of
truth. To know something more of the great infinite,
they are searching to discover the fountain of peace
and rest, from life's numerous conflicts and Gethsem-
anes. Those who hope to find Heaven and peace first
must learn the law of giving, through the law of lov
ing.
Pause for a moment from out this fast age of living
and take a short inventory. Is every one doing their
whole duty to humanity? I am afraid no one is. Is
there not something more can be done? Unaware does
the time slip swiftly by. Have your obligations been
met? If even the little things are neglected as well as
the large duties no one is eligible to be called a Chris
tian. Do the things that meet your observation today,
whether for great or small, high or low, rich or poor.
"There is always work to be done. Scatter sunshine
sparkling with the dews of love revealed, your labor
is needed, the harvest is ripe within your fields."

The time goes speeding on, is your task finished?
Some one else cannot do what is your duty to perform ;
observe closely less the blessing is lost that was yours
to give, for the Master said, "As ye do it unto the least
of these my children, you have done it unto me."
How many are ready for the Master to visit their
household. He may come unawares we know not the
day or the hour. Pray none may be found asleep at
the switch. Learn to know God, then you will awaken
to find yourself in His Kingdom. With the finish,
permit these lines by an unknown author to sink deep
into thy soul, lest you be deprived of your share of
blessings.
THE MASTER'S CALL
They said, "The Master is coming to honor the town today;
And none can tell at what house or home the Master will choose
to stay."
And I thought, while my heart beat wildly, "What if He should
come to mine?
How would I strive to entertain and honor the Guest Divine?"
And straight I turned to toiling to make my home more neat.
I swept and polished and garnished, and decked it with blossoms
sweet ;
I was troubled for fear the Master would come ere my task was
done.
So I hastened and worked the faster, and watched the hurrying
sun.
But right in the midst of my duties a woman came to my door;
She had come to tell me her sorrows, and my comfort and aid to
implore.
But 1 said, "I can't stop or listen, or help you any today;
I have greater things to attend to!" and the pleader turned away.
But soon there came another, a cripple, thin, pale and gray.
And said, "Let me stop and rest a while in your goodly home,
1 pray
I have traveled far since morning. I am hungry and faint and
weak;
My heart is full of misery, and comfort and help I seek."

But I said, "I am grieved and sorry, but I cannot keep you today;
I look for a great and noble Guest I" So the cripple went away.
But the day wore onward swiftly, and my task was nearly done,
Yet a prayer was ever in my heart that to me the Master would
come.
And I though 1 would spring to meet Him, and serve Him with
utmost care;
When a little child stood by me, with a face so sweet and fair;
Sweet, but with marks of tear-drops, and its clothes were tat
tered and old;
A finger was bruised and bleeding, and its little bare feet were
cold.
And I said, "I am grieved and sorry, you are surely in need of
care,
But I cannot stop now to give it; you must hasten and go else
where."
At the words a shadow swept over his blue-veined brow.
"Some one will feed and cloth you, dear, but I am too busy now."
At last the day was ended, my task was over and done;
My house was swept and garnished, and 1 watched in the dusk
alone.
Watched—but no footfall sounded, no one came to my gate.
No one entered my cottage door; I could only pray and wait.
1 waited till night had deepened, but the Master had not come.
"He has entered some other door," I cried, "And gladdened some
other home.
My labor has been for nothing" —I bowed my head and wept;
My heart was sore with longing, but in spite of it all I slept.
Then the Master stood before me, and His face was grave and
fair:
'Three times today I came to your door, and craved your pity
and care.
Three times you sent me onward, unhelped and uncomforted.
And the blessing you might have had was lost, and your chance
to serve has fled."
"O Lord, dear Lord, forgive mel how could I know it was Thou?"
My very soul was ashamed, and sank in the depths of regret
and woe.
And He said, "The sin is pardoned, but the blessing is lost to thee;
For comforting not the least of mine, thou hast failed to com
fort me."
