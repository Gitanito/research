As I wiihed to fee the curiofities of
this city, and as the Prince was
waiting only for the arrival of
remittances to return to his native
country, he eafily prevailed on
me not to depart before him. We
agreed not to feparace during the
time of our refidence at Venice,
and the Prince was fo kind as to
accomodate me at his lodgings at

diveriions, and though he was but
thirty-five years old, he had refitted
the numerous attradlions of this
Voluptuous city. To the charms

was a ftranger to the world about
him. Senfible of the deficiency
of his own judgment, he was apt
to give an unwarrantable prefer­
ence to the judgment of others-.
Though far from being weak, no
man was' more liable to be govern­
ed. When conviction, however, had
once entered his mind, he became
firm and decifive; equally courage­
ous to combat an acknowledged
prejudice, and to die for a nevyone.

turn. He read much, but without
difcrimination. As his education
had been negledled, and as he had
early entered the carter of arms,
his uhderftanding had never come
to maturity. Hence the know­

of his ideas, becaufe it was built

One evening, as ufual, we were
walking byourfelves, well mafked,
in the fquare of St. Mark. It was
late, and the crowd was difperfing.
The Prince obferved a maik which
followed us every where.. This,
nialk was an Arminian, and walked
alone. We quickened our fteps,
and by different turns endeavoured -
to lofe hirti. It was in vain, the

Having reached home he began at
length to fpeak : “ It is laugha- -

We were juft approaching him,

Republic were waiting to pay their

tend him to the Aflembly, where
the firft nobility of the city were

hardly an opportunity of giving

The Ghoji-Seer was firft publiihed

It appears, however, from the
fequel, that the perfon fo often

was a Roman Catholic prieft. In
