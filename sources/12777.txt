  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in the top right hand side of an ambulance and looking down at my body. I could read the thoughts of the emergency medical technician (EMT) who was with me. He was   thinking that I was so young to die. When looking down at myself, I thought, 'Am I dying.' I then sensed a presence with me. The presence spoke to me in a kind and soothing female voice. I did not see her. She did not speak with words but with thoughts. That is the best way I can describe it. When I thought 'Am I dying' she spoke with surety and said, 'No! that would never be asked of your parents.' My parents have lost a twin girl at birth and we lost my brother in 1999 after fighting a year long battle with a very strong cancer. These events nearly destroyed all of my family. Then it was like she became even more soothing than before. She told me not to fear because there would be nothing wrong with me.  She told me this several times. Then she told me that they would run tests on me, many tests but not to fear for they would find nothing. 

   The love that came from that presence that I call my angel is inexplicable. I describe it this way: Take the person that you love the most in all the world and magnify that love times a million. That is the love and comfort that I felt, yet this does not even give it justice.  Just as she said, they ran many tests on me and found nothing.  I believe that is because she was giving me strength for the future because just two years later, I had Grand Mal seizures. Once again, they ran every kind of test on me only to find nothing. I know that I Spoke to one of God's angels. No one will ever convince me that I did not. There is no way she could have known and prepared me for the future not to mention the love, total kindness,  complete forgiving and unconditional love. I felt that is truly beyond human explanation. Thank you for listening to my very beautiful experience. I am no longer afraid of death. In fact, I embrace it and can't wait to go home!
