INTRODUCTION,
º O N T H E
IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE.
“I have often, of late, reflected what an unhappy man I must
have been, if I had not acquired in my youth some fund and taste of
learning. What could I have done with myself at this age without
them Let me therefore most earnestly recommend to you, to hoard
up, while you can, a great stock of knowledge ; for though, during
the dissipation of your youth, you may not have occasion to spend
much of it, yet you may depend on it, that a time will come when
Lor D CH Est ER F1 E L p.
IN presenting this work to the public, the
experience of nearly a century supercedes the ne
cessity of our eulogiums on its contents, and has
stamped its importance and usefulness with the
sanction of its appebation. We shall therefore only,
in these introductory pages, endeavour to impress
the youthful reader with a due sense of the import
ance of acquiring knowledge in general, and parti
cularly such as may be attained by the study of
iv INTRODUCTION.
this volume, by exhibiting a brief sketch of those
subjects which occupy its pages.
It must not be expected that in them should be
found a complete circle of the Sciences; or that any
authors, now deservedly esteemed, should be re
jected to make way for what is here offered. It
was intended, by the means of these precepts, not
to deck the mind with ornaments, but to protect it
from nakedness, not to enrich it with affluence, but
to supply it with necessaries. The inquiry therefore
was, not what degrees of knowledge are desirable,
but what are in most stations of life indispensably
required; and the choice was determined, not by
the splendour of any part of literature, but by the
extent of its use, and the inconvenience which its
neglect was likely to produce.
I. Iteading and Spelling.
The prevalence of this consideration is shewn
in the first part of our work, which is appropriated
to the humble purpose of teaching to READ and
spell, ;—a task of little magnificence, but of great
importance, inasmuch as it is the root from whence
all our acquirements in literature spring, and is
equally useful to the highest and lowest as a preli
minary step to the acquisition of general know
ledge.

guage render it a subject of pleasing and useful in
.
INTRoduction. v
quiry; it is the general vehicle of our ideas, and
represents by words all the conceptions ofthe mind.
Books and conversation are the offspring of this
prolific parent. The former introduce us to the
treasures of learning and science, and make us ac
quainted with the opinions, discoveries, and trans
actions of past ages; by the latter, the general in
tercourse of society is carried on, and our ideas are
conveyed to each other with nearly the same rapi
dity with which they rise in the mind. Language,
in conjunction with reason, to which it gives its pro
per activity, use, and ornament, raises man above
the lower orders of animals; and, in proportion as
it is polished and refined, contributes greatly with
ouher causes to exalt one nation above another in
the scale of civilization and intellectual dignity.
Thus duly impressed with the importance of a
knowledge of language, we have endeavoured to
present the student with a concise view of English
Grammar, and exhibited such rules as, by atten
tion, we flatter ourselves he may be enabled to
write and speak the English language with purity,
perspicuity, and elegance; and also gain an intro
duct on to those general principles of grammar that
may lay a foundation for his future progress in
classical literature.
III. Letter-Writing.
The importance of writing Letters with propriety
justly claims to be considered with care, since, next
to the power of pleasing with his presence, every
man would wish to be able to give delight at a dis
tance. This is also a talent which unavoidably is
called for almost every day of one's life, as well on
vi INTRODUCTION.
business as on pleasure. We have therefore select
ed such models for imitation as we trust will enable
the student to form a correct idea of the epistolatory
style, and which may be useful to him in transact
ing the general business of life.
---
IV. Arithmetic.
This art, from its obvious utility, commenced in
the earliest state of society, and received gradual
improvements as commerce was advanced and the
sciences were cultivated. It is cultivated with suffi
cient diligence by those whose occupations render
it their interest to be expert in the application of
its rules. To the merchant and the banker it is in
dispensably necessary, and to all ranks in society,
from the peasant to the peer, it is highly useful.
From the first entrance of a young man into society,
he will find the advantage of keeping some account
of what he receives and pays, as he may reap the
double advantage of securing himself from the im
positions of the fraudulent, and from the folly of
spending more than he can afford. This practice
may give a check to his expenditure, suggest to him
the propriety of not exceeding his income, and put
it in his power to be generous as well as just. Thus
economy, produced by regularity of accounts, may
be the parent of beneficence. Such a habit of re
gularity is far from being inconsistent with the li
beral notions of a gentleman, although not recon
cileable to the heedless extravagance of the spend
thrift. The observation of every day proves its uti
lity in every situation of life; and without the con
stant comparison of receipts with payments, com
munities as well as individuals must eventually be
involved in embarrassment. It can never be ne
- INTRODUCTION: . vii
• glected except by those who are determined to pro
ceed blindly and inconsiderately to certain distress
and ruin. - - - . . .
Arithmetic is the measure of almost every thing
valuable. It is not only the indispensable guardian
of private accounts, but the guide to political know
ledge, as to the population, revenues, balance of
trade, coinage, and military power of nations. Dr.
Johnson well observed, “that nothing amuses more
harmlessly than computation, and nothing is more
often applicable to real business or speculative in
quiries. A thousand stories, which the ignorant
hear and believe, die away when the computist takes
them within his grasp. Numerical inquiries give
entertainment in solitude by the practice, and repu
tation in public by the effect.” *
V. Geography.
Without a knowledge of this branch of science,
no reader can have a clear idea of the scene where
any occurrence takes place, but is liable to the
grossest mistakes by confounding one part of the
world with another. It is equally applicable to mo
dern as to ancient history, and introduces the pleas
ing combination of the ancient and modern names
of places, and the characters and manners of the
different inhabitants. It assists the memory by the
associations of ideas which it suggests, and the
prospect of a country represented by a map or a
globe, recals to mind the memorable deeds which
have been performed in it, as well as its illustrious
In en.
Persons in various situations of life are interested

viii INTRoduction.
from its cultivation. While it constitutes a branch
of knowledge essentially necessary for the traveller,
the merchant, and the sailor, it furnishes abundant
stores of investigation to the naturalist and the phi
losopher. It is not only requisite for every reader
of history, but for every one who peruses the daily
accounts of the events which are taking place in
various parts of the world, whether they are M. Seats
of war or of commerce. It has long been considered
as a material branch of a polite education ; at pre
sent indeed it is more particularly requisite that it
should be so, as the British commerce and colonies
extend our connexions to so many different coun
tries, and as many voyages of discovery have of
late years been made.
VI. Astronomy.
This science is, of all others, both the most su
blime, the most beautiful, and the most interesting;
for there are no persons, of whatever age, to whoul
the heavenly bodies are not objects of curiositv.
The certain principles upon which it rests are proved
by the calculations of eclipses; asthe astronomer can
determine not only that the luminaries of day and
Jight will be darkened, but he can pronounce with
certainty at what particular point of time, and to
what particular extent, such obscurations will hap
pen, and exactly how long they will continue.
Some parts of astronomy are so useful to mankind,
as to make the cultivation of it highly necessary ;
accordingly we find traces of it among all nations.
By its assistance, geographers are enabled to ascer
tain the true figure and size of the earth, and the
situations and extent of countries; chronologists
can compute the measure of the year, and naviga
j
INTRoduction. ix
tors can determine, the longitude of places, and
direct their courses through the trackless and stormy
ocean with correctness and safety.
-
• *. *
VII. Geometry and Mensuration.
On the usefulness of these branches of science it is
unnecessary to expatiate in an age when mathema
tical studies have so much engaged the attention of
all classes of men ; we have therefore only to ob
serve, that in this part of our work, simplicity and
a desire to render easy of comprehension the sublime
principles of these branches of knowledge, have
been what we have chiefly aimed to accomplish.
VIII. Stenography or Short Hund.
A brief sketch of this art, which has of late oc
cupied the attention of the most ingenious of our
countrynen, also forms a part of this volume. Our
study has been, in the outline we here give of this
useful art as well as polite accomplishment, to render
it simple and easy of practice, so that the writer, by
attention to the principles laid down, may at his
pleasure, with facility, follow the words of the public
orator, take down his speech, preserve the debates
of the tribune, or follow the professor of science
through his elaborate discourses.
Besides these interesting subjects, the elucidation
of which forms a portion of these pages, there are
added, Instructions for the conducting of Business
in general; also the best method of Book-keeping,
Merchants’ Accounts, &c. &c. -

Having thus exhibited to the young student the
useful materials of which our Book is composed, it
remains now only for us to impress on his mind the
necessity of diligent application, without which
he can never acquire knowledge, nor attain any
object of his pursuit, however trifling it may be,
much less when he aspires to the ... that
may be gleaned from this work. Consider, then,
that idleness is the parent of every vice; but well
directed activity is the source of every laudable
pursuit and honourable attainment. It is peculiarly
adapted to the frame and constitution of youth,
promotes good humour, and is conducive to health.
Indolence and inactivity are no less subversive of
every purpose of mental improvement, than of the
general happiness of life. An idle boy will gra
dually lose the energy of his mind, will grow indif
ferent to the common objects of pursuit, except
such as stimulate his passions; and when he ad
vances in life, he will with difficulty be prevailed
upon to make any important exertion, even for the
promotion of his own interest, and much less for
that of his friends. The character of a sluggard—
of him who loses the pleasant, the healthy, and the
precious hours of the morning in sleep, and the
remaining part of the day in indolence, is justly
reputed contemptible. While his powers of mind
remain torpid, the diligent applies his activity to
the most useful ends. His steps may not be uni
formly rapid, or his actions always conspicuous; he
may not attract the gaze of mankind, or move in
the circle of fashionable levity and dissipation; but
you may observe, that by habitual dexterity of
conduct, and the practice of business, he is quali-.
fied to meet the difficulties and fulfil the duties of
any situation in which he may be placed; and you
will frequently see him, by his unremitting perse
verance, acquire objects of fortune, distinction, and

If you take an extensive survey of the world,
you may remark, that nothing great or laudable,
nothing splendid or permanent, can be effected with
out the exertion of diligence. Are not the treasures
of fortune, the fruits of industry, the acquirements
of learning, and the monuments of glory, to be
referred to its animating influence Behold the
student, engaged in poring over the volumes of
knowledge by his midnight lamp, and stealing his
hours of study even from the season of repose ; be
hold the peasant roused by the dawn of the morn
ing to pursue his daily toils along the furrowed
field; repair to the manufactory of the artificer,
and, amid the various divisions of labour, observe
with what alacrity all the sons and daughters of in
dustry are plying their incessant tasks; or visit the
crouded haven, where the favourable gales call the
attention of the vigilant mariners; and you will re
mark, that the whole scene is life, motion, and ex
ertion. In these various situations, in every nation
of the globe, from the ardent and enterprising sons
of Britain, to the myriads who people the empire
of China, you may observe, that the principle of
diligence, Tike the great law of creation, which
causes the planets to perform their invariable revo
lutions, pervades each busy scene, and throughout
the universe actuates the race of men for some use
ful purpose.
Finally, reflect that time pursues his flight on
rapid wings; and that the hours of youth, like the
waters of an impetuous stream, roll on never to
return. You must be sensible that the portion of
life appropriated to your education, is not, if duly

considered, a season for pleasure and pastime alone;
that the days will come, when the engagements of
the world will allow you little leisure to increase
your stock of knowledge by study, and to improve,
by regular application, those talents which Provi
dence has committed to your care, for the use of
which you are accountable to conscience, to soci
ety, and to Heaven; from the abuse and neglect of
which will spring deep regret and unavailing sor
row; but from their cultivation will arise the delight
of a self-applauding mind, and the respect and ho
nour of the virtuous and the wise. -

CoN son ANts; w iſ AT DIPHT110N Gs A Re, Tuiel R. NUM
BER, AND how PRONou NCED AND W RIT TEN.
"THE design of this book being to instruct mankind, espc
cially those who are young, in the methods of conver
sing and transacting business in the world; therefore those
accomplishments of spelling and writing good and proper
so good a hand, yet if he be defective in spelling he will be
ridiculed, and held in contempt, because his writing fair
will render his orthographical faults more conspicuous.-
Therefore,
First, Syllables are made of letters, words of syllables,
and sentences of words, &c. -
There are twenty-six letters; viz. a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, ,
j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, w, y, and z. In these
letters we are to observe their names, their form, and their
force: their names, by which to know them ; their form,
English claim the first notice; for let a person write ever
whether great or small; their force, in pronunciation or
latterance. -
Letters are distinguished, according to their sound, into
vowels and consonants: a vowel is a letter that soundeth
by itself, and these are six in number, viz. a, e, i, o, u : y
is also an English vowel, when it cometh after a consonant,
and hath the sound of i, as in by, sly, reply, syllable, &c.
but the y is never used in words not derived from a foreign
language, otherwise than at their end. A consonant is
, a letter that hath no sound except it be joined with a vowel,
for without one of the vowels no syllable can be made; as
b, c, d,&c. without the aid of a vowel, cannot be sounded.
Though
2 Tile You Ng MAN's BEsr CoMPANIos.
Though we have twenty-six letters, and six of them roſtels,
yet we have two inty-one consonants; for y, when set before
any vowel in the same syllable, becomes a consonant; as in
youth, youtler, beyond, &c. Note, that j hath the sound of
g, as in join, jingle, &c. JP is a vowel at the end of a word,
as law, now. - - -
When two vowels come together in a syllable, and are
not parted in the pronunciation, but united in one sound
they are called Diphthongs; of these there are thirteen, viz.
ai, ei, oi, au, cu, ou, 'ce, oo, ea, co, ou, and ie ; as in maid,
faith, either, join, aul, cunuch, stout, feed, seed, food, broad,
stealth, wealth, people, steeple, hoat, oat, heat, beat, feat,
friend, field, &c. Note, In the first seven words both
cowels are sounded ? but in the other fifteen, one of them is
scarcely heard. -
There are also those that are called Tripthongs, where
three vowels meet in one sound, as in beauty, beau, lieu,
and quaint : Likewise ay, oy, u/, atº, cic, and ow, become
Diphthongs at the end of words, but are called improper
Diphthongs; as in say, key, joy, saw, bow, &c. Note, aw, ºw
and ow, are commonly sounded as au, eu, and ou.
Of LitteRs G R FAT AND SMA 1.1, AND wil EN to I, E. Us? D.
Great Letters are not to be used in the middle or latter
end of a word, except the whole word be so written, as iri
JEHOVAH, LORD, or titles of books, &c. For it would
be very absurd to write thus: To Mr. geolºge Roſieſts, in
tha\! ES street; instead of, To Mr. George Itogers, in
Thames-street. , -
Great Letters are to be written at , the beginning of
sentences: as, Know when to speak, and when to be silent. -
At the beginning of all proper names of places: ships,
rivers, &c., ai, London, the lion, Thames, Sctern : Also
the Christian names and surnames, of women and men
must begin with great letters; as, Samuel Sharp.
At the beginning of the more eminent words in a sentence
as, Faith is the Foundation of the Christica Religion; or, if
a word that we have a particular regard or deference for,
as, God, Christ, King, Queen, &c. At the leginning of
every line in poetry; and at the beginning of the names of
arts, sciences, and trades; as, JPriting, Arithmetic, Geome
try, Music, Carpenter, Smith, &c.

ENGLISH GRAMMAR. 3
Note, The personal pronoun I, and the interjection O,
must always be written in capitals; for it is ridiculous tº
write thus: On Monday last i came to your house, but you
were not at home; 0 how much it gricted me !
The small letter s is commonly written f at the beginning
and in the middle of a word, and s at the end ; but if two
of them come together in the middle of a word, they may
be written thus, ss or ſs.
Oes ER v Atiox's cos cert N ING THE Soux D or Letty. Its,
a N D wil ic II An E on ITTED IN PRON UN c1 ATION.
A is not sounded in Pharaoh, nor in Sabaoth, but as if
written Pharo, or saloth ; neither in marriage, but as
mar-rige ; also, parliament as parliment, and chaplain as
chaplin, &c. In some proper names it is drºpped in the
pronunciation; as in Aaron, Isaac, Canaith, Balaams
which are pronounced as if written, Aron, Isac, Canan,
Balan; but we must except Ba al and Ga-al. A is
sounded broad, like aw, in words before td and li; as it:
bald, scald, hall, wall, fall.
B is not sounded in thumb, dumb, plumb, lamb, doubt,
debt, subtle, &c. but sounded as if written, thum, dum,
plum, lam, dout, det, suttle, &c. -
C is sound d hard like K, before a, o and it, and before ?
and r, as in these words, cane, came, comb, cub, clay, crane,
crab ; and soft in cement, city, and tendency. C loses its
sound in scene, science, and victºra's , likewise in indict,
indictment; also before ſ, as stack, rack, stick, thick, brick.
In words of Grºck and Hebrew dº rivation C is sounded Hike
f{, as in sceptic, Cis, Acellema, &c. - -
Ch are sounded like K in many foreign words, some of
which occur in the holy scripture; as in chorus, Chymi, ,
Chrysostom, Christ. In the word schism, the sound of ch is
lºst, it being sounded as if it were sism ; and in the words
Jºachel, Cherubim, and Archbishop, it is sounded in the
English manner. Ch in French words sound like sh, as in
chevalier, pronounced shevalier ; mareschal, marshals
machine, mashcen ; capuchin, capitsheen; chaise, shaise.
D is not sounded in ribband, nor in Hednesday, which
are pronounced ribbon and IFonsday; the termination cd is
often shortened into t , as burned, burni : chokcd, chok: ;
ripped, ript; passed, past; choped, chopt; &c. -

E is not sounded in hearth, &c. E final is that placed
at the end of a word; and is seldom heard but in Monosyl
lables, as in me, he, she, ye, the, &c. where it hath the
sound of ee: and in words derived from foreign languages
in which e has its perfect sound; as Jesse, jubilee, Mamre,
JNineve, Candace, Cloe, Unice, Penelope, Salmone, Phebe, epi
tome, catastrophe, Gethsemane, simile, pramunire, &c. In
all other cases efinal serves only to lengthen the sound, and
to distinguish it from other words of a different meaning,
which are written without e, and are sounded short; as in
1hese examples following, viz. cane, can ; hate, hat ; bite,
bit ; fare, far; hope, hop; made, mad; scrape, scrap ; stare,
star; tune, tun ; write, writ, &c. In words of more than
one syllable it strengthens, the sound of the last syllable,
but does not increase the number of syllables; as admire,
demise, blaspheme, &c. E lengthens the syllable also in
some foreign words, such as Eve, Tyre, Crete, ode, scheme.
E is seldon: written after two consonants; as in pass, turn,
black. Yet after rs it is used as horse, nurse, purse. Also
the words ending in cre, gre, and tre, sound the e before
the r, as in these words, acre, lucre, centre, sepulchre, mitre,
lustre; which are sounded as if written aker, luker, center,
sepulcher, miter, and luster, E final also serves to soften c
and g, as in ace, place, lace, spice, truce, oblige, huge, age,
&c. If nouns in e final take safer them, with an apos
trophe before it, it stands for his, as the Pope's eye, or the
eye of the Pope, the table's foot, or the foot of the table. If
without an apostrophe, it makes the plural number, as
Popes, tables, Words derived from these written with e
Jinal seldom retain it, as in writing, loving, doing, &c.
not writcing, loveing, or docing ; except in the termination
ge and ce, before able, as in changeable, peaceable, &c.
£ should not be written after a diphthong in these
words; vain, main, gain, fear, know, &c. not vaine, maine,
gaine, &c.; , E final is annexed, but not sounded, in those
words which would otherwise end with i, o, or u; as in die,
foe, sloe, true, virtue, &c. but there are some exceptions, as
do, so, to, &c. .
Lastly, there are scne words in which the final e does
not lengthen the sound, as give, live, some, one, done, &c.
F in plurals is changed into v ; as wife, wives; staff,
states ; knife, knives.
G is not sounded in sign, reign, gnaw, gnat, a sign,
design, seignior, seraglio, phlegm, &c, G is sounded soft

in gender, ginger, and gipsey; but hard in Gibeon, Giherah,
Gilboa, Geth-se-mane; and hard also in these proper
names, Gibson, Gilman, and Gilbert; and likewise in these
words, gelt, geld, girt, gimp, geese, gander, gamble, gather,
gild, &c. Observe, that if g be hard with a long vowel,
we is joined and pronounced in the same syllable; as in
plague, Prague, Hague, rogue, league, dialogue, catalogue,
& c. -
Gh in the end of some words, where au or ou goes be
fore, hath the sound off, as in tough, rough, cough, laugh,
sounded as tuff, ruff, coff, latf; but buff, cuff, snuff, and
huff, must be so written—Gh is not sounded in migh/y,
though, through, daughter, and Vaughan,
H has place, but no sound, in chronicle, Christ, ghost,
John, Rhine, schedule, and schism, &c. H is not sounded "
at the end of words if it be alone, but with tc before it, it is
sounded as snatch, watch, &c.
I is not sounded in adieu, juice, renison, fruit, bruise.
Salisbury; it is sounded like ee in oblige, magazine, and
machine, &c. I is sounded long in proper names ending in
iah, as Jeremiah, Hezekiah; but short in A-ri-el, and Mi
ri-an.--I is sounded like u in first, dirt, bird, &c.
K is nearly allied in sound to c, but to know when to
use one, and when the other, Note, that c has the force of
k only before a, o, oo, and u, and these two consonants t .
and r, and therefore we must not write kare for care, kow’
for cow, krown for crown: and the use of k is only before e,
i, and u ; wherefore we must write keep, key, knight, kill,
not ceep, cey, cnight, nor cill. But the words calendar and
Catharine, are written sometimes kalendar or Katharine,
K is written after c only in pure English words, such as
back, deck, sick, &c. for the best authors have omitted it in
words derived from the Greek and Latin, such as public,
music, physic, &c. , - -
L is not sounded in calf, half, chalk, stalk, walk; those
words being pronounced as if written caff, huff, chauk,
stauk, wauk. Neither is l sounded in Holborn, Lincoln,
salmon, or chaldron; these are sounded as if written Hoborn,
Lincon, sammon, chadron; nor in colonel, where the first l
has the sound of r, as cornel.
In the word accompt, mp is sounded like un. -

wimmin. And sometimes O is sounded as u, as in money,
colului, conjure, attorney, Monmouth, as if written munity, , ,

as in Shealtiel, Phaltiel, and the like; and in the English
derivatives mightier, emptier, pitiable, &c. -
U is sounded like e in bury, berry; like i in busy, bizzy.
U is sometimes written after g without being sounded, as

OF SYLLABLEs AND THEIR Divisions, BEING THE ART
of SPELLING.
A Syllable is a sound pronounced by a single impulse of
the voice, as vir-tue, so that virtue being thus divided, or
taken asunder, makes two syllables, viz. vir and tue; which
put together, form the word virtue. And many times a
vowel, or a diphthong of itself makes a syllable, as in a bate,
e-te-ry, i-dle, and in aug-ur, aid-er, dy-ster, oak-en.
No syllable can be made, be there many or few conso
nants, without the aid of a vowel or diphthong.
The longest monosyllables we have in English are length,
strength, and straight ; which could not be sounded with
out the vowel e or i. -
The Art of Spelling may be reduced to the four following
general rules or heads: -
1st. When a consonant comes between two vowels, in
dividing the words into syllables, the consonant is joined to
the latter vowel; as in sta-ture, na-ture, de-li-ver, a-ni-ty,
&c. except compound words, which terminate in ed,
en, est, eth, er, ing, ish, and ous; as coast-ed, gold-em,
Know-est, know-eth, bear-er, bar-bar-ous, fool-ish, ra-ven-ous,
and sub-urbs. - -
2dly. When two consonants come together in the mid
dle of a word they are to be parted, if not proper to begin
a word; as num-ber, stran-ger, for-tune, &c. not numb-cr.
strang-er, fort-une. When the same consonant is doubled
in a word, the first belongs to the foregoing, and the latter
to the following syllable, as in the rule above, and in these
words, Ab-ba, ac-cord, ad-der, &c.
3dly. Consonants that begin words must not be parted in
the middle; as, a gree, be-stow, re-frain, not ag-ree, bes-tow,
ref-rain.—These consonants may begin words, viz, bl, br, cr;
dr, dw, ch, fl.fr, gh, gl, gr, kn, &c. as blunt, break, chaw, cry,
draw, dwelt, flesh, ghost, &c.
4thly. When two vowels come together, not making a
diphthong, they must be divided, as in vi-al, ca-li-ant,
Li-on-el, du-el, cru-el, me-tc-or, and La-o-di-ce-a. ---------a ---
Some particular Notts.
L is doubled in words of one syllable, as well, tell, swell,
hall, wall, fall, will, hill, mill, &c. But in words of more
than one syllable the word always terminates with single l;
- * &S
ENGL1sh GRAMMAR. . . . 9
as angel, Babel, hurtful, beautiful, and dutiful. Neither
must l be doubled in always, also, although; not allways,
allso, allthough, &c.; but words accented on the last syllable
must be excepted from the above rule, viz. install, recall,
inroll, rebell, and repell. - - - -
Y must be used before the termination ing, as buying,
lying, carrying, paying, slaying, burying, &c.
f you cannot write out the whole word at the end of
the line, you break it off at the end of a syllable, thus, con
- demn.
C must not be put between two consonants; as think,
not thinck; thank, not thanck; but if a vowel goes before e,
ou must write c before k, as brick, thick, stick, &c.
Of S and C, some people may easily drop into error by
mistaking S for C, as in the beginning of the following
words, where C has the perfect sound of S, though C must
be undoubtedly written; viz. in
City Citron Cellar Cieling Censure
Cell Censor Censer Certain Cypress. ,
Civet Ceruse Cinque Cymbal Circuit
Circle Centre Cistern Cymon Celestial
Cease Cipher Cement. Celerity Celebrate
Centurion Cinnamon Ceremony.
These words must be written with S and C, viz.
Science Sceptre Scarcity Sciatica
Schedule Scheme Schism. Scythian.
The following words should be written.
with ti - with si - - - - * ,
Contention Confusion ... . .
Action - Occasion . . . ~
Contradiction Contusion - -
Attention . Oppression
Benediction . Allusion * .
Apparition Ascension * ... . . . .
Concoction Aversion . . . . . . .
IDeclaration Aspersion - * *
Ambition Commission -
Contrition - Comprehension
Oration Circumcision
Oblation Conclusion.
The following words should be spelled thus:
Passion, not Pashon Salisbury, not Salsbury
Fashion, not Fation Leicester, not Lester * *
B 5 Cushion,

Cushion, not Cution Shrewsbury, not Shrusbury ...

Worcester, not Worster Westminster, not Westmister. *

words of the same sound, or nearly the same sound, though
widely different in their sense and signification; such as the
following:
A Assistance, Help
A BE L., Cain's Brother Assistants, Helpers.

OF Stops, AND oth F.R MARKs, used IN REAL ING
AND WIRITING.
THESE are of absolute necessity; and great regard
ought to be had to them for the better understanding of
what we read and write ourselves; they are likewise of
use to others who shall hear us read, or see our writing.
Stops, or Pauses, considered as intervals in reading, are
no more than four; though there are other marks to be
taken notice of. The names of the four Stops are, a Com
ma, Semicolon, Colon, and Period, or Full Stop: and
these bear to each other a kind of progressional proportion
of time; for the Comma signifies a stop of leisurely telling.
one, the Semicolon two, the Colon three, and the Period.
four–And are made or marked thus: . . . . . . .
Comma () at the foot of a word. * . . . . . . . * -
Semicolon () a point over the Comma. ,
Colon (:) two points."
Period () a single point at the foot of a word.
, lxample of the Comma (): There is not any thing in
the world, perhaps, that is more talked of, and less under
stood, than the business of a happy life.
; Example of a Semicolon (;): The orator makes the
truth plain to his hearers; he awakens them; he excites
them to action; he shows them their impending danger.
: Example of the Colon (:): A sound mind is not to be
shaken with popular applause: but anger is startled at
every accident. - - -
. Example of the Period (); It is a shame, says Fabius,
for a commander to wxcuse himself, by saying, “I was
110t
20 THE You NG MAN's Best CoMrAN Ion.
a -
not aware of it.” A cruelty that was only fit for Marius
to suffer, Sylla to command, and Cataline to act.
By the foregoing Examples we may easily note, that a
Comma is a note of a short pause between words in the
sentence; and therefore the tenor of the voice must still be
kept up.–The Semicolon is a little longer, and the tone of
the voice very little abated.—The Colon signifies perfect
sense, though not the end of the sentence; and the voice
somewhat abated.—The period denotes perfect sense, and
the end of the sentence.
* When the Question is asked, there is a crooked márk
made over the Period, thus * and is called a Note of Inter
rogation. Example, What could be happier than the state
of mankind, when people lived without either avarice or
envy The true time of pause for this stop is the same as
with the Semicolon. . - * .
! If a sudden crying-out, or wondering be expressed, then
this mark is made over the Full Stop, thus! and call d a
Note of Admiration, or Exclamation. Example, Oh the
astonishing wonders that are in the Starry Heavens ! -
() If one sentence be within another, of which it is no
part, then it is placed between two Semicircles or a Paren
thesis, made thus (). Example, Pompey, on the other
side (who hardly ever spoke in public, without a blush)
had a wonderful sweetness of nature. Again: Of authors
be sure to make choice of the best, and (as I said before)
stick close to them. In reading a Parenthesis, the tone
must be somewhat lower, as a thing or matter that comes
in by the bye. The time is equal to a Comma, and ought
to be read pretty quick, lest it detain the ear too long from
the scnse of the more important matter. -
* Apostrophe, is a Comma at the head of letters, signiſy
ing some letter or letters left out in poetry, as would'st for
wouldest, ne'er for never, 'tis for it is, o'er for over. Or to
denote a Genitive Case; as my Father's House, my Uncle's
Wife, &c. - - -
'Accent is placed over a vowel, to denote that the stress

- Hyphen or Note of Connection, is a straight line, which
shows that the syllables of a word are parted, and the re

“Quotation, or double Comma inverted, is used at the

author to be his own words, as an excellent Poet says,
“The proper Study of Mankind is Man.”
When we distinguish any particular Syllable in a word
with a strong voice, it is called accent ; but where any
particular word in a sentence is thus distinguished, it is
called emphasis: and the word on which the stress is laid,
is called the emphatical word. Seme sentences contain
more senses than one: and the sense which is intended can
only be known by observing on what word the emphasis is
laid. For example. Shall you ride to London to day?
This question is capable of four different senses according
to the word on which the emphasis is laid. If it be laid i.
the
22 Til E. YoU NG MAN's Best CoM PAN ion.
the word you, the answer may be—“No, but I intend to
send my Servant in my stead.” If it be on the word ride,
the proper answer may be—“No, but I intend to walk,”
If the emphasis be placed on the word London, it is a diffe
rent question; and the answer may be—“No, for I design
to ride into the Country.” If it be laid on the word to-day,
the answer may be—“No, but I shall to-morrow." . How
important then is a right emphasis in determining the
proper sense of what we read or speak.

* > . OF WO RDs.
The use of words are to convey our sense of things to
another person, and for that purpose are divided into four
classes, viz. - - - w
1. Names. 2. Qualities. 3. Affirmations. And 4, Articles.
NAM Es.
Names declare things themselves, and need not the help
of any other word to make them understood, as, a boy, a
ship, a cow, &c. But these names in general admit of a, an,
or the before them, as a house, an union, the world. - -
. Sometimes they need not either of those articles, but
stand by themselves as misery, joy, sorrow, & c. -
- - - - . . º *- : * ~ : These

sº
ENGLISH G RAMMA R. 23
These names have two different numbers, viz. the Singu
lar and Plural. The Singular speakelh but of one, as
a stone; the Plural of more then one, as stones.
The manner of making singulars plurals, is by adding s,
as cap, caps, mug, mugs, cat, cats, &c.
But when the singular ends in ce, ch, se, sh, r, ze or ge,
when sounded soft we either must add s, or es, and make
another syllable, as, grace, graces; church, churches; purse,
purses; fish,fishes; for, fores; mace, maces; stage, stages.
There are many cxceptions to this rule, as man in the
plural number makes men; woman, women; child, children;
Anife, knives; staff, states, &c. • *
There are several words which have no singular number;
and, on the contrary, there are some which have no plural,
Proper names have no plural, because they agree but to
one. … . . .
As to personal names when mentioned in conversation,
they must be either spoken of ourselves to another, or of a
third; and there are three persons in the singular, and three
in the plural, viz.
Singular. Plural. * *
I is the 1st person ſe the 1st person, * -
Thou, or you the 2d. Ye or you the 2d person,
He, she or it, the 3d person. | They, the 3d person.
These following have a leading state, as I has me; thou
thee; he, him ; she, her; we, us; ye, or you, them; they, them.
Note, I, he, she, we, ye, and they, begin a sentence but
seldom end it; me, him, her, us and them, seldom or never
begin a sentence, but often end one. - -
QUALITI es.
Some qualities proceed from personal names, as my,
mine; thy, thine; our, ours ; your, yours ; her, hers; their,
theirs, &c. -
These qualitics serve to express the nature, or manner of
things, as good, bad, great, small, green, black, &c. and by
putting to it a name, or thing, will make good sense, as a
good boy, a bad girl, a great dog, a small room, a green leaf,
a black hat, &c. .
Note, The articles a, an, or the are qualities, but have a
different use and signification, viz. a or an expresses the
same; only a is used before a consonant, and an before a
vowel, as a sword, a knife; an egg, an ear. The article
- -- * * * ~ * ''. " - a the,
24 The YouNg MAN's Best CoMPANIon.
the, shews the reality of a thing itself, as the clock struck sir;
signifies that very clock we are speaking of.
Qualities, likewise, have their degrees of comparison, as
first, tall, second, taller, third, tallest; or suppose I am
speaking of three persons, John, is tall, James is taller,
amitel is tallest ; again, Sarah is pretty, Mary is prettier,
Susan is prettiest." - - - - -

of Arrinnations on Veins. .
A Verb is a part ofspeech, that betokens doing, suffering,
or being, as I love, I am ſored, I live.
Verbs are known by the word to going before them, as
to laugh, to cry, to weep, to dance, to be cold, to be lame, &c.
There are three sorts of verbs, viz. active, passive and -
neuter. A verb active denotes an action, or doing of any
thing; and in such a manner, that a person or thing it
acts upon follows the verb, as I love her, &c. and a verb
that signifies suffering, has the title of a verb passive, as
I am lored. The English tongue has no passive verbs, for
we have not a verb that denotes suffering, but is supplied by :
the use of two or three words, which are called auxiliary !
or helping verbs. *** .. *
A verb neuter signifies the state or being, and sometimes
the action of a person or thing but has no noun after it .
to denote the subject of action. •
A verb neuter is sometimes active, as I run; and some
times passive, as I am sick. - -
There is another verb called impersonal, being without
any distinction to either sex; and is governed by the word
it, as it thunders, it snows, it is hot, &c.
There are also belonging to verbs four things, numbers,
persons, moods and tenses; and first of numbers, viz. two,
the singular and plural. -
- OF PEItsons. -
Verbs have six persons, viz. three singular, and three
plural, as . • * - - a. *
I, thou, or you, he, or she, or it, are singular:
|We, ye, or you, and they, are plural. "
º * - Qr thus, a ... "
• Singular. Plural. -

Thou playest or dost play, Ye or you play or do play,
He playeth or doth play, They play or do play.

ENGLIsh GRAMMAlt. 25
Of Moods.
Moods signify the various ways of expressing a verb or
action of a verb; and strictly speaking, the English have no
mood; because they have no alteration of the verb itself,
unless in thesecond and third personssingular of the present
tense, and the second person singular of the preterimperfect:
therefore, the mood in English is expressed or known by cer
tain words called helping verbs; of which there are two sorts,
perfect and defective: the former are the verbs am, be, or
have; the latter be, may, can, might, will, would, shall, should,
could, must, or ought; as thus, the possibility of any thing to
do, or to be done, is expressed by can or would, the liberty
or design of the speaker or doer, by may or might; the incli
nation by will or would; and the necessity of doing a thing
by must or ought, shall or should.
OF TENSEs.
Tense, in grammar, signifies the different times of an ac
tion, viz. first, it shews the action or thing that is doing, but
not finished. Second the action or thing finished or done,
without regard to any thing else. Third, the action not
yet "done, but will soon be done or finished, which are
comprehended in the time present, time past, and time to
come. * -
. There is another division of time, viz., The time past is
subdivided, 1st. into the time not perfectly past. 2d. The
time long past; and the time to come is subdivided into the
time some great while to come. -
OF REGULAR WER ps. '
Regular verbs are those that observe a stated rule in the
formation of their times. -
A regular verb keeps the same in every person, tense, or
time, save sometimes it has a syllable more in some of the
persons, and a syllable more in some of the tenses, of which
I shall give you a hint by way of example.
Present Time. -
Singular. I love or do love, thou lovest or dost love, or you
º: or do love, he loveth, loves, or doth or does

Plural. We love or do love, ye or you love, or do love,
they love or do love -

Preterimperfect Time, or Time not perfectly past.
Singular. I loved or did love, thou lovedst or didst love, or
ou loved or did love, he loved or did love.
Plural. We loved or did love, ye or you loved or did love,
they loved or did love.
Preterpluperfect Time, or Time long past. -
Singular. I had loved, thou hadst or you had loved, be had

Plural. We had loved, ye or you had loved, they had

First future Time, or Time to come.
Singular. I shall or will love, thou shalt or wilt love, or you
shall or will love, he shall or will love.
Plural. We shall or will love, ye or you shall or will love,
- they shall or will love. -
Second future Time, or Time of long space to come.
Singular. I shall or will love hereafter, thou shalt or wilt, or
you shall or will love hereaſter, he shall or will
love hereafter.
Plural. We shall or will love hereafter, ye or you shall or-.
will love hereafter, they shall or will love hereafter.
The perfect verb am or he, is used to supply the want of
verbs passive in the English language, and make the sentence
complete, by being joined to them, or going before them,
as I am grieved. - º
As for Example: Present Time. t
Singular. I am wounded, thou art or you are wounded, he
is wounded.
Plural. We are wounded, ye or you are wounded, they

OF PART1c1PLEs. -
A participle is a part of speech derived of a verb, and
signifies either being, doing, or suffering, as a verb does:
Of which there are two, viz. active, having ing added to the
verb, as loving; passive having d, t, or n, added, as loved,
tuught, slain.
OF A Dv ER Bs.
An adverb is a part of speech joined to a verb, to an ad
jective, to a participle, or to another adverb, to declare
their signification, as º
First, to a verb thus: -
Sarah sincerely loves John. .
Secondly, to an adjective thus:
Chloe is a very comely lass.
Thirdly, to a participle thus:
- He is a manjustly deserving preferment.
fourthly, to another adverb thus:
He speaks very prudently.
Adverbs ending in ly, are derived from adjectives, as
from just, true, brave, &c. comejºstly, truly, bravely, &c.
Some adverbs are likewise comparad, as soon, sooner, and

“Of Conjunctions.
A Conjunction is a part of speech that joins words and
sentences together, and shews the reason of a thing or the
manner of their dependance.
The following are some of the principal, viz. and, as,
although, also, but, because, either, except, for, howsoever, if,
likewise, moreover, no, not, namely, nevertheless, or, otherwise,
sare, since, that, therefore, &c. -
* There are various kinds of conjunctions, but the chief
are copulatives, disjunctives, casuals, and conditionals, as for
Example: - -
1. A conjunction copulative, joins...words or sentences
together, as I sing, and James dances. -
2d. A conjunction disjunctive, joins words but makes
a division in the sense of the thing, as I or James shall be
beat.
3d. A conjunction casual, shews the cause or reason of a
thing, as I do work that I may eat.
4th. A conjunction conditional, renders the speech
doubtful, as, If the seas dry up, we shall find great riches.
OF PREPositions.
A Preposition is a part of speech most commonly set
before other parts of speech, and are either 1st. In apposi
tion or separated, 2d. Joined or in composition. -
Prepositions of apposition are these, viz, above, about,
after, against, at, among, amongst, before, beside, betwixt,
between, below, behind, beyond, by, bencath, far, from, in,
into, off on, or, upon, out, of, towards, to, until, on this side,
on that side, over, through, under, up, to, with, within,
without. As for example: f
- John and Peter travelled into Egypt.
Here into is the preposition, separated from the noun;
but if the moun be left out, it is expressed thus, John went
before, and Peter followed after, viz. John went before Peter
and Peter followed after John. -
Prepositions of composition are these, viz., ad, en, wm,
up, out, mis, dis, &c. adverb, enjoy, undone, upside, &c.
OF INTERJECTIONs. -
An interjection is a part of speech, that betokens a sud
don passion of themind, either by being surprised overmuch, ,
Or
º
f.
- ENG lish G RAM M A R. 29
or by jesting, doubting, &c. and generally have a note
of admiration after them, as oh! alas ! O! wondrous ! hy
brave boys &
OF SENTEN ces.
A sentence is the joining two or more words together, so
as to make perfect sense, as Julius Caesar was a worthy
man, for under his conduct the Romans first entered into
Britain.
There are two kinds of sentences, simple and compound.
A simple sentence is that wherein there is but one verb,
and one nominative word of the subject either expressed or
understood, as, the bell rings. - -
A compound sentence is two simple sentences joined
together by a conjunction, or a relative, as, I run and you
fight, I laugh and you mourn, I pipe and you dance, &c. -
Moreover, for the due joining of words, there are three
concords. The first is between the nominative word and
the verb, viz. The nominative word is the thing or person
that either is, does, or suffers; and is, in general, set before
the verb, as, James laughs, John mourns, Judas betrays, &c.
Except when a question is ask'd, and then the nominative
is set after a verb, as lovest thou?, doth the king come?.
- Likewise if it be an imperative sentence, as, work thou,
ring the bell, &c. -
And sometimes when the words it or there comes before.
the verb, as, it is my book, there came one to me. ,
In a conditional sentence, Had I been covetous to please"
my Master, I would have used diligence; for, if I had been
covetous, &c. To find the nominative word or case to the
verb, ask this question, who or, what? and the word
that answers to the question shall be the nominative case
to the verb, as, I read the book through: Who read the
book through I, &c. ſ
A verb personal agrees with his nominative case, in num
ber and person, as, the master readeth and ye regard not.
Many nominative cases singular, with a conjunction co
pulative coming between them, will have a verb plural, as,
Thomas and Charles were both at school, &c. -
Note also, That sometimes the infinitive Mood of a verb
is the nominative case to the verb, as, to steal is scandalous.
Sometimes a whole clause aforegoing, may be the nomi
i native case to the verb, as, to rise betimes in the morning, is the
most wholesome thing in the world. *
C 3 Wyen
30 THE Young MAN's Best CoMPAN1on.
When a verb follows a noun of multitude, it may be
put in the plural, when the case is absolutely determined
to be more than one, as the multitude wondered when they
saw the dumb to speak, the lame to walk, &c. and it is
most commonly of the singular number, as the multitude
is very noisy. . The croud is gone, &c. º
The second concord is between the substantive and the
adjective. When you have an adjective, ask this question,
who or what? the word that answers to the question, shall
be the substantive to it. There is no distinction of case,
gender or number in the application of adjectives to sub
stantives in the English, as in Latin, as, a comely lass,
a dirty boy, &c.
The pronouns this and that, make these and those, in the
plural, as, this man is my servant; these men are my servants;
that book is my son's; those books are my daughter's.
The adjective, for the most part is set before the substan
tive, as, a good boy. Yet sometimes when there are more
adjectives than one joined together, or one adjective with
other words depending on it, the adjective may be set after
the substantive, as, a commander, both stout and brave.
And sometimes when the article the comes between, as
king George the third, &c.
When two substantives are put together in composition
the first takes to itself the nature of an adjective; and is
commonly joined to the following substantive by a hyphen,
as, a water-cask, a sea-horse, &c. -
Adjectives are frequently used as substantives, as some,
for some men; few for few men. -
The third concord is between the antecedent and the
relative. When you have a relative, ask this question, who
or what? and the word that answers to the question shall be
the antecedent to it. - - ~
A relative sentence is that which has in it the relative ad
jective, who or which, And the antecedent is the word
going before the relative, and is rehearsed again of it, as,
this is the bird which you brought home, i. e. which bird -
you brought home. The relative agrees with the antecedent
in number and person, as, that man is wise, who speaketh
few things. . . . - -
When there comes no nominative case between the relative
and the verb, the relative shall be the nominative case to the
verb, as wretched is he who is in love with money. O

Implements, viz., good Pens, Ink, and Paper; likewise
a flat Ruler for exactness; and a round one for Dispatch;
with a Plummet or Pencil to rule lines. .
* FIow, to hold the Pen. . .
THE Pen must be held somewhat sloping, with the . . .
Thumb and the two Fingers next to it; the Ball of the
Middle-finger must be placed straight, just against the
upper part of the Cut or Cradle, to keep the Pen steady;.
the fore finger lying straight on the Middle-finger; and
the Thumb must be fixed a little higher than the end of ,
the fore finger bending in the Joint; and the Pen so placed
as to be held easily without griping it. The Elbow must ..
be drawn towards the Body, but not too close. You must
support your Hand by leaning on the Table-edge, resting
it half way between your Wrist and Elbow, not suffering.
the Ball or fleshy Part of your Hand to touch the Paper;.
but resting your Hand on the end of your little finger, .
that and your fore finger bending inwards, and sup
ported on the Table. So fixed, and sitting pretty upright,
not leaning your Breast against the Table, proceed to .
the making the small a, c, e, i, m, r, s, w, and r ; ;
which must be all made of equal size and height; the
distance or width between the two strokes of the n must .
be the same with the distance or width in the three strokes ,
of the m: the same proportion or width must be observed
in the u, w, and o. The Letters with Stems, or Heads,
must be of equal height; as the b, d, f, h, ı, and f :
and those with tails must be of equal depth, as the f, g,
p, q, and f. The Capitals must bear the same proportion
to one another with respect to size and height, as A, .
B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, &c. All upright strokes,
and those leaning to the left hand, must be fine or hair:
strokes, and all downright strokes must be fuller or blacker.
Due care must be taken,” that there be an equal distance
between Lºtter and Letter, and also between Word and

when you have gained a habit of writing fair and free; for
it is much more commendable to be an hour in writing six
Lines well, than to be able to write sixty Lines in the same
time, which perhaps will be unintelligible. And beside by
a slow and fair procedure you will learn in half the time,
and therefore it is vain in a Learner to desire to be quick
before he has acquired Experience, and a Freedom of
Writing by frequent practice. Never overcharge your
Pen with Ink; but shake what is too much into the Ink
stand again. - -
f How to make a Pen.
THIS is gained sooner by Experience, and Observation
from others who can make a Pen well, than by verbal Di
rections. But before you begin to cut the Quill, scrape of
the superfluous Scurf with the Back of your Penknife,
scrape most on the Back of the Quill, that the Slit may be
the finer. After you have scraped the Quill, cut it at the
End, half through, on the back Part, and then turning up
the Belly, cut the other Part, or Half, quite through, viz.
about a quarter or almost half an inch, at the end of the
Quill, which will then appear forked. Enter the Penknife
a little in the back Notch, and then putting the peg of the
Penknife-haft into the back notch (holding your Thumb
pretty hard on the Back of the Quill, as high as you intend,
the slit to be) with a sudden or quick twitch force up the
slit ; it must be sudden and smart, that the slit may be
clearer. Then by several cuts on each side bring the
Quill into equal shape,or form on both sides; and having
brought it to a fine point, place the inside of the Nib on
the Nail of your Thumb, and enter the Knife at the Ex
tremity of the Nib, and cut it through a little sloping, then
with an almost downright cut of the Knife cut off the
Nib. The breadth of the Nib must be proportioned to the
breadth of the Body, or downright back-strokes of the
Letters, in whatever hand you write, whether small or
Text. Note. In sitting to write, place yourself directly
against a fore-right Light, or else have it on your left
Hand, but by no means have the Light on the right
Hand, because, the shadow of your Writing-hand, will
<bstruct your Sight.

As good Ink is essential to good Writing, I here give a
Receipt or two for making some of the best Black ink in the
World, viz. - - -
A Receipt for making Black Ink.
To six Quarts of Rain or River Water, put one Pound
and a Half of fresh blue Galls of Aleppo, bruised pretty
small; six Ounces of Copperas; also eight Ounces of
clean, bright, and clear Gum Arabic. Let these stand to
gether in a large Stone Bottle near a Fire, with a narrow
Mouth, to keep it free from Dust; shake, or stir it well,
once every Day, and you will have excellent Ink in about a
Month's Time, and the older it grows the better it will be
for Use..
Ingredients for a Quart.
One Quart of soft Water, four Ounces of Galls, one
Ounce of Copperas, and two Ounces of Gum, mixed and
stirred as above. The Galls must be bruised.

How to make Red Ink.
Take three Pints of stale Beer (rather than Vinegar) and
four Ounces of ground Brazil Wood; simmer them together
for an Hour, dissolve Half an Ounce of Gum Arabic in it,
then strain it through a Flannel, and bottle it up (well
stopped) for Usc.
To keep Inkfrom Freezing or turning Mouldy,
In very severe Weather, ink will be apt to freeze, which
takes away all its Blackness and Beauty. To prevent
which, put a Wine Glass of Brandy or other Spirit into a
Quart, and it will not freeze, And to hinder its turning
mouldy, put a little Salt in it

Dear Aunt,
The trouble I have already given you puts me to the
blush, when I think of intruding again on your goodness;
but necessity, which frequently obliges us to such actions
as are contrary to our inclination, is the motive that in

me, if I once more beg your assistance, which I do not
doubt but you very well know I stand greatly in need of
at this time, and I shall ever have a grateful remembrance
of your goodness to me; and I hope I shall be, one time

OF SECRET WRITING.
First, If you dip your pen in the juice of a lemon, or of
an onion, or in your own urine, and write on clean paper
whatever you intend, it will not be discerned till you hold
it to the fire, and then it will appear legible.
Another way: When you write a letter, the contents of
which you intend shall not be discovered but by those you
think
Of Arithmetic. . . - 43
think fit, first write your thoughts on one side of your letter
with black ink, as usual, and then, on the contrary side, go
over the said matter that you would have secret, with a
clean pen dipped in milk, and that writing cannot be read
without holding it to the fire, when it will appear legible in
a bluish colour. - -
A third method is, to have two pieces of paper equal in
size, and the uppermost cut in chequered, holes or squares
big enough to contain any word of six or seven syllables,
and in those squares write your mind in regular sense, and
then take off the said chequered paper, and fill up the va
cancies with words of any kind, which will render it per
fect nonsense, and not capable of being read to any purpose,
and transmit and send the said uppermost, or chequered
paper, or another exactly of the same form, to your cor
respondent; whereby he shall, by laying it nicely on your
said letter, read your intended sense, without being per
plexed with the words of amusement, intermixed, which
make it altogether unintelligible.
Or again, you may write to your friend in proper sense
with common ink, and let the lines be at so commodious a
distance, that what you intend to be secret may be written
between them with water, in which galls have been steeped
a little time, but not long enough to tincture the water, and
when dry, nothing of the writing between the said lines can
be seen; but when it is to be read, you must, with a fine
hair pencil, dipped in copperas-water, go between the said
lines, and so you make it legible. ,
Note. This way will excite no suspicion, because the
letter seems to carry proper sense in those lines that are set
at a proper distance, -
of ARITHMETIC.
After writing, the next necessary step towards qualifying
a person for business is the understanding the noble science
of Arithmetic, a knowledge so necessary in all the parts of
life and business, that scarcely any thing is done without it.
In my directions for its attainment, I shall proceed with
such plainness of method, and familiarity of style, as shal!
render it easy to be understood, and conspicuous to the
meanest capacity. And first of Notation and Numeration.
Of
44. The Young Max's Best Companiox.
of NoTATION and NUMERATION.
In Notation we must note, or observe, that all numbers
are expressed by, or composed of, these ten figures, or cha
racters following, viz. . . . . . . . . . . . - * -
One, two, three, four, five, sir, seven, eight, nine, cipher...
rº, 1 '', 2 3 tº 4 5 ... 7, , ; 8 ; , 9, ... 0 . .
Nine of these are called significant figures, to distinguish
them from the cipher, which of itself signifies nothing; but
as it is placed in whole numbers, serves to increase the va
lue of the next figure or figures that stand before it; as 3 is
but three ; but before the cipher, thus, 30, the 3 becomes.
thirty, &c. But in decimal Fractions, 0 decreases the va
lue of figures behind it, for there, 3 is three-tenths of any
thing; but by placing 0 before it, thus, O3, it is decreased
from 8 tenth parts to 3 hundred parts of anything, &c.—
We are to observe, that every one, or any of the above-men
tioned nine figures, or digits, have two values, one certain,
and another uncertain ; the certain value is when it stands
by itself; the uncertain is, when joined or placed with
other figures or ciphers; for when any one of these figures
stand alone, they signify no more than their own simple va
Hue; as 5 is but five, 4 but four, 6 but six, and 3. no more :
than three, &c. And this is the certain value of a figure.
But when another figure or cipher is annexed, they then are
increased in their value ten times; as 5, or 5 units or ones,
to 5 tens, or fiſty; 4 to 4 tens, or forty ; 6 to 6 tells, or
sixty; and 3 to 3 tens, or thirty; as thus, 51, fifty-one ;-
42, forty-two; 63, sixty-three; 34, thirty-four, &c. Again,
if any of the said figures stand in their place towards the left
hand, they signify so many hundreds. as they expressed
units or ones; as 500 is five hundreds, 600 sik hundreds,
and 300, three hundreds, &c. If any of them possess the
4th place towards the left hand, they are so many thousands.
as they contain units; and so any or every figure increases
by a ten-fold proportion, from the right hand to the left, ac
cording to the place it is found or stands in ; so that 5 may
be either five or fifty; five hundred, or five thousand ; in
the first place, 5; in the second, 50 ; in the third, 500;
in the fourth place, 5000, &c.
The true value of figures in conjunction may be fully
learned and understood by the following table: -

For the easier reading of any number, first get the words
at the head of the table by heart, as units, tens, hundreds,
thousands, &c. and apply them thus: 75, five units, five;
and 7 tens, seventy; that is, seventy-five. Again 678; 8
units, eight; 7 tens, seventy; and 6 hundreds,six hundred;
that is, six hundred seventy-eight. Once more, 3456;
uuits, six ; 5 tens, fifty; 4 hundreds, four hundreds; 3
thousands, three thousands; together, three thousand four
hundred fifty six. The 4th lineof the table, viz. 123456789,
may be read thus: one hundred twenty-three millions, four
hundred fifty-six thousand seven hundred eighty-nine. But
the manner of reading any number may be rendered more
intelligible by stops, thus: make a comma after every third
figure or cipher, beginning at the right hand, and sô on
towards the left, thereby distinguishing every third place
into hundreds, as hundreds of units, hundreds of thousands,
hundreds of millions, and hundred thousands of millions,
&c. And for trial, read the first line of the table, where
the last place in valuation is hundred thousand of
millions, and being pointed into periods, will stand thus,

thousand of millions, 678 millions, 921 thousands, 460

of millions, two hundred forty-five thousand six hundred
seventy-eight millions, nine hundred twenty-one thousand

In addition of simple numbers, whether it be yards, gal
lons, pounds, or any thing else, remember to carry 1 for
every 10 that you find in the right hand row, or rank of
figures, being units to the next row of tens, and the like
from the rank of tens to the row of hundreds, &c. and
whatever it makes in the last row, you must set down,
amount to what it will.
The numbers above are set down in order, as before di
rected; that is, units under units, tens under tens, &c. as
may beplainly understood, by being indicated at the head
of each row, or rank, by U. T. H. &c. signifying units,
tens, hundreds, &c. Then in casting up each example, to
know its total, I begin at the right hand, or unit's rank of
the first example, and say 2 and 4 is 6, and 6 is 12, and 8
is 20, and 2 is 22, and 4 is 26; in which row there are two
tens, and 6 over; wherefore I set down 6 just under its own
rank, and carry 2 to the next row, and say 2 that I carry
and 4 makes 6, and 2 is 8, and 8 is 16, and 0 is 22, and 4

is 26, and 2 is 28; and this being the last row, I set dowt.
the amount, viz. 28; so that the total number of yards is
found to be 286, and the amount of the next or second ex
ample is found by the same method to be 3562 gallons.
And in the third and last example, the total number of
pounds is found by the same way to be 369484; and so
the total of any other example of the same kind, viz. simple
numbers of one denomination may be found. Note, That
when any of the ranks amount to just 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
&c. then you must set down the 0 under its proper rank,
and carry either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, according to the number
of tens that you find to the next row.
We come now to Addition of Money.
In England or Great Britain accounts are kept in pounds, .
shillings, pence, and parts of a penny ; so you are to ob
serve, that
4 Farthings make 1 penny. *
12 Pence 1 shilling, and
20 Shillings I pound.
In adding of these together, you are, with the same punc
tuality, to mind that pounds be set directly under pounds,
shillings under shillings, pence under pence, and farthings
under farthings; as in the following example.
But before you proceed, it will be necessary to have the
following tables by memory, for the readier remembrance
of how many shillings there are in a given number of pence,
and how many pounds are contained in a given number of
shillings, &c. * * -
Note, That l stands for pounds, s for shillings, d for pence,
and qr for farthings, those being the initial letters of Libra,
Solidus, Denarius, and Quadrants, Latin words of the same
signification.

The use of these tables is this: whenever you are casting
up any sum of money, you begin at the right hand (as be:
fore in sums of one denomination), suppose at the place of
pence, then if the rank or denomination of pence amounts,
from the bottom to the top, 56; your table of pence tells
you, that 50d. is 4s.2d. to which adding 6d. the sum is 4s.
8d. if to 92d, the table tells you, that 904. is 7s.6d. which
with 2d. over, is 7s. 8d. And if to 81d, the table shows that
80d. is 6s. 8d., and 1d. more makes 6s. 0d. &c. -
* The shilling table serves to lead you to a quick recollec
tion of how many pounds are in so many shillings; as, ad
mit the rank of shillings arises to 57s. the table says that 50s.
is 21. 10s. and 7s. over make 2l. 17s. If to 84s. the table
shows that 80s. are just 4d. and 4s. over, make 4!. 4s. If
to 1 12s, the table shows that 100s. are 5l. and 12s. more
make 5l. 12s. &c." . .

How to prove Addition. -
In all examples of addition, whether of simple numbers,
that is, numbers of one denomination; or in examples com
pound, that is of divers denominations, as pounds, shillings.
pence,farthings, &c. the readiest method of proof is to cast
the same downwards, beginning at the top as you did the
same upwards, beginning at the bottom, and if that is the
same the work is right. " I might-here give examples of
other kinds of addition, as apothecaries weight, cloth, liquid,
dry and long measure, time, &c. but this method serves for
any of them, having respect to the tables that belong to
those several denominations, as follow, viz,
A Table of the Parts of Apothecaries IP'eight.
20 Grains 1 scruple 3 a scruple
3 Scruples 1 dram 3 a dram

to take, a lesser, number out of a greater, and shows the
remainder or difference. . . . . . * * * * * -
Place the less number accurately under the greatér, draw
a line under them, and beginning at the right hand, take
each figure in the lower line from the figure under which
it stands. If the figure in the lower line is greater than that
in the upper, then, in numbers of one denomination, ten
must be borrowed and added to the figure in the upper
line; take the figure in the lower line from the sum, and
write down the remainder, but for every ten thus borrowed,
the must be paid or added to the next left-hand figure in
the lower line. Erample. ... Suppose Mr. Andrews owes

to the figure that stands directly over the figure 6), and
there remains 7 ; then i that I borrowed and 4 is 5, for as
I borrowed 10 in the inferior place, which is “pial to one
in the superior, so I must now pay the same; therefore I
say 5 from 2 I cannot, but 5 from 12 (borrowing 10, and
adding it to the figure 2, as above,directed) andºthere re
main 7; then I that I borrowed and 1. are 2, from 3, the
figure above it, and there, remains 1 and 80 the example is
done; and by it shown that"Mr. A. still owes Mr. B. 177
pounds; fora proof of its truth, add 177, the remainder,
to 146, the lesser of the two given numbers, and it will?
make 323, being the same with the greater number or sum:
of money, first due, and therefore it is a sure proof of the
truth and certainty of the rule. . . . . . - - " -

5, and 5 from 9, and there remain 4: and lastly, 2 from 6,
and there remain also 4; so that 4414 are left behind, which
put to the number he takes to market, makes the number
he had, viz. 6904, and shows the deduction to be true, and

This table is so plain and easy, that there is scarcely
need of direction; for the product of any two figures will
be found in that square, which is on a line with the one,
and under the other: thus 54 the product of 6 times 9 will
be found on a line with 6, and under 9; or in a line with
9, and under 6; so 7 times 8 is 56, and 8 times 7 is 56,
&c. And thus the table ought to be got by heart for the
more dexterous readiness in multiplying.
Now for the Application."
Example 1. How many is 3 times 472? Which 472
being set down in the margin; I say, 3 times —— 3 is
6, which place under 3 the multiplier; then 3 times ——
7 is 21, set down l under 7, and carry 2 for the two 1416
tens, as in Addition of one Denomination, then 3 times
4 is 12, and 2 carried is 14; which set down, and the pro
duct is 1316: that is3 times 472 make so much: which may
be proved by Addition, by setting down 472 three times in
additional order, and casting it up, which shows that this
rule performs compendiously the office of addition.
Example 2. Again, how many are produced by multi
plying 742 by 4 - - -
742 Multiplicand). Here I say 4 times 2 is 8, and 4
4 Multiplier. Rº:4 is 16; 6 and carry 1; and
$: times 7 is 28, and l is 29, which
set down; so the whole product is
2968, as appears by the work.
More examples of one figure in the Multiplier are these:

And here you must begin with that figure which is in
the place of units of the multiplier, and go through the
whole multiplicand, by multiplying each figure of it first
by the said unit figure, then by the next, namely by the
figure in the place of tens of the multiplier ; then with the
third, &c. to the last; always remembering to place the
first figure of every product or line exactly and perpen

dicularly under the figure you multiply by; and then
add the several lines or products together, which so col
lected give the total product required, as in the examples
following, viz. - *
Example 1. *.
How many are 23 times 7426? First, I begin 7426
with the unit figure 3 in the multiplier, saying, - 23
3 times 6 is 18; 8 (which H set directly under 3,
by which I multiply) and carry I; then 3 times 2227s
2 is 6, and 1 is 7; then 3 times 4 is 12; 2 and 14852
carry I ; then 3 time 7 is 21, and ) is 22; and
so I have done with the first figure of the Mulit- 17079S
plier, viz. 3. Then I go to the next, that is 2, and -
twice 6 is 12; 2 and I carry 1 (which 2 is placed in a di
rect line under 2 the multiplying figure) then twice 2 is 4,
and 1 is 5; then twice 4 is 8, and lastly, twice 7 is 14,
which I set down; then I add the two products together;
saying 8 is 8, 2 and 7 are 9, &c. and the total is the true
product or result of the multiplication, viz. 170798.

And these two examples accord with the other defini
tion, or use of this rule.
I shall in the next place say something concerning
Multiplication of money, and a little of its use, and so con
clude this rule. -
Multiplication of Money.
Multiplication of money has a great affinity to addition
ofmoney; the same method being taken in carrying from one
denomination to the next, viz. from farthings to pence, from
pence to shillings, and from shillings to pounds. And as in
Addition, and other Multiplications, you begin at the right
hand and proceed towards the left, so here you begin at
the least denomination, which is also at the right hand.
This method of accompting is the most apt and expe
ditious of all others, for small quantities, and therefore
extremely necessary in making bills of parcels, &c. and is,
beyond all contradiction, as sure and certain as any way
whatsoever.
-
. . ;
The general Rule
! Is always to multiply the price by the quantity.
The first step is, for quantities from 2 to 12; and this is
done by one multiplier, as in the examples following: º
- Erample 1. - l. s. d.
Multiply . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 12' 6.
(or 6 pieces of cloth at 7l. 12s. 6d. per piece) by 6
45 15- - 0.
Of A RITH MEric. . . . . 65
Here I say 6 time 6 is 36 pence, which is just 3s. I
set down 0 in the place of pence, and carry 3s. to the place
of shillings, (exactly the same as in Addition of Money)
then 6 times 12 is 72, and 3 is 75s. or 3l. 15s. where
fore i set down 15 in the place of shillings, and carry
three to the pounds; then 6 times 7 is 42, and 3 is
45l. So the whole amount of the pieces of cloth, at 7l. 12s.
6d. per piece, is 45l. 15s.
- !". Example 2.
Again, How much is 9 times 13s. 4d. or what is the
amount of 9 marks 9 -
In this example I say, 9 -
times 4 is 36d, or 3s. I set 6 0 0
down 0, and carry 3; then 9 * . " …
times 13 is 117, and 3 makes 120; but 120 shillings make
just Gl, and so much is the value of 9 marks,
º Example 3.
Once more: What is the value of 12 gallons of wine at
5s, 4d. per gallon? s, d.
, Here I say 12 times 4 is 48; 0 and 12
carry 4; then, 12 times 5 is 60, and 4 -
is 64s. or 31.4s. &c. - - - - 3 - 4 - 6
The next degree of reckoningis of quantities exceeding
12, even to 12 times 12, or 144; all which, as far as 144,
are found in the Table of Multiplication; which is a ready
help to all purposes of reckoning; and that yºu may pro
ceed with dexterity, you must be very ready in the said
table, that you may immediately see what component
parts suit the quantity proposed, or is pretty near it, and
then work accordingly. -
If the quantity be 15 yards, I readily know that 3 times
5 is 15, and therefore 3 and 5, or 5 and 3, are to be my
multiplier. If the quantity were 21, then 3 and 7, or 7
and 3, would be multipliers; if 30, then 5 and 6, or 6 and
i. also 3 and 10, or 10 and 3; if 45, 48, 56, 66, 72, 96,
c. were the quantities, then 5 and 9, 6 and 8, 7 and 8,
6 and 11, 6 and 12, and 8 anti 12, &c. are to be my mul
tipliers, and exactly hit the several quantities of which th
are component parts; and examples of this kind have two
multiplications for their solution. -
I shall

viz. If 10s. 8d. be the value of 3 times 3s. 5d, then 5 times
the value of 210s. 3d. must of necessity “be 15 times the
value of 3s. 5d. because 5 times 3 is i5: And its truth
may be proved by Addition and Multiplication, thus: set
down 3s.5d, three times, in Additional order, and put the
three lines together, and the total of them multiplied by 5,
as before, and the answer will be the same. *Or'set down
17s. 1d. (the product of 5s. 5d. multiplied by 5), three times
also, and add them together, and the total will be exacti
the same with the result of the multiplicatiºn; as in the

The next step is of quantities, or numbers that are not
to be answered precisely at two multiplications: In this
case you will have an addition of one line more, occasion
ed by bringing down the priee of one to be added to the
last product; or else a line more made by multiplying the
price by what is defective or wanting in the number by
two multiplications, to make up the proposed quantity
complete; as it may be of 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. as by the sub
sequent examples may be seen and understood.

The use of this, rule is to know how many times one
number or sum is contained in another, as if it were asked,
how often is 9 contained in 54? the answer is 6 times; or
how many times 12 is there in 144 Answer 12 times.
As by Multiplication great, denominations are brought
into small, so contrarily by Division small denominations
are brought into greater; as farthings (from one gradation
to another) into pounds, pounds weight into tons, and
gallons liquid into hogsheads, &c. -
In this rule we are to take particular notice of the three
following terms, viz.
1 "c Dividend, or number to be divided.
#3The {;or number by which we divide.
3 Quotient, or answer to the work; which shows
how often the divisor is contained in the dividend.
4. The Remainder; which is an uncertain branch of this
rule, because their is sometimes a remainder, and sometimes
not." The remainder is always of the same name with the
dividend, and is less than the divisor, for if it be greater than
or equal to, the divisor, the work is wrong. -
To divide any number of one denomination by a number
not exceeding 12.
Rule.—Write the divisor on the left hand side of the
dividend, making a curve line, thus ) between them, and
find how many times it is contained in a certain number of
figures of the dividend, and place the result below.
Multiply the divisor by the quotient figure, subtract the
product from that part of the dividend, and carry the re
mainder, if any, as so many tens to the next figure of the
dividend. - - - *
Then find how many times the divisor is contained in
that number; place the result in the quotient, multiply the
divisor, subtract the product, and carry the remainder, as
so many tens, to the subsequent figure of the dividend.
Divide again this number, as before, and so on, to the end
of the dividend. - - -
. If the divisor consist of a number not greater than 12,
and the dividend of a number not higher than 144, the
answer is gained at once by the multiplication table; thus .
iſ 63 is to be divided by 9; the answer will be 7 times.
Here 63 is the dividend, 9 the divisor, and 7 the quotient;

cause in 78 there are eight nines and 6 over. 8 G
The general method of proving the truth of division is
this “multiply the answer by the divisor, and take in the
remainder, if any, and the result will be equal to the divi
dend, when the operation is right.” The following exami
ples will itiustrate the foregoing rules. -

In the first of these examples I say, the 4's in 7 once,
and there remain 3, which considered as tens, and placed
before-8, the next figure in the dividend, make 38; then
the 4's in 38, 9 times; 9 times 4 is 36; 36 from 38 there
remains 2; or two tens, which carried to the 9, the next
figure in the dividend, make 29; then the 4's in 29, 7
times; 7 times 4 is28; 28 from 29 there remains 1; which
makes the 0, the next of the dividend, 10, and the 4's
in 10 twice; twice 4 is 8; 8 from 10 there remains 2;
which make 6, the last figure of the dividend, 26; lastly,
the 4's in 26, 6 times, and 6 times 4 is 24; 24 from 26,
leaves 2 the remainder: and so for the other two examples.
And for proof of the work multiply the quotient by the
divisor, and take in the remainder in the place of
units; and if the product be the same with the dividend,
the division is right ; for I say, 4 times 6 is 24, and 2 the
remainder, make 20; 6 and carry 2, &c. -

When the divisor consists of several figures, then there
arises a little more difficulty in the work; but if the fol.

will be evident from the following example, &c.

The example thus set out, I begin at the left hand, seck
ing how often I can take 32 out of 78; or more easily, how
many times 3 are in 7, and the answer is 2 times; which I
place in the quotient thus 32)78901(2, and then according
to the General Rule, I multiply the divisor 32, by the 2

the General Rule) the divisor 32 by the said 4, saying 4
times 2 is 8, placing it under 9 in the dividual; then 4 times
3 is 12, which set down under 14; so there is 128 to be
taken out of 149, and then the work appears thus: -
32)789.01(24 And after substruction there remains 21;

210 times 32, the divisor, is there in 210 Or
- casier, how many times 3 in Q1 2 But ob
serve, That whenever you have a place more in the dividend
than in the divisor, then always try how often you can take
the first figure of the divisor out of the two first of the di
vidend, and the answer is 7 times; but it will not bear 7
times, for 7 times 32 is 224, and you cannot take 224 out
of 210; or rather you cannot take 22 out of 21; wherefore
try in your mind before you set down the answer, or figure
of the quotient, whether it will go to the number of times
as is most easily suggested; as here the question or demand
is readily answered 7 times; and so many times 3 may be
taken in 21; but when you come to multiply the whoſe
divisor by the times you place in the quotient, you begin at
the right hand, and go towards the left, carrying the tens
that arise to the next place, which so increases the product,
that sometime, subtraction cannot be made, because the
under line is greater than the upper; wherefore first try in
your mind, as has been said; and since it will not bear 7
times, try if it will not go 6 times; saying, 6 times 2 is 12,
2 and carry 1; and 6 times 3 is 18, and 1 is 19, and 19 may
be taken out of 21; therefore set down 6 in the quotient,
next to the 4, and multiply the divisor 32 by it, and the
work willstand thus: -

(an equal number of places with the divisor) answer 0

in the dividend (for O must never begin the quotient, as wat
said before) and make a point under it, viz. under the last 0
but one, as may be seen in the example; and there being a
place more in this dividual than in the divisor, I try how
often the first figure of the divisor, viz. 3, is contained in
the two first figures or places of the dividend, viz. 30, and
the answer is 10 times; but you are never to take above 9
times at once, in any of these examples of division; where
fore try in your mind whether it, will bear 9 times, before
you set it down in the quotient (as noticed before), saying
to yourself, 9 times 5 is 45, 5 and go 4; 9 times 6 is 54,
and 4 is 58; 8 and go 5; and 9 times 3 is 27, and 5 is 32;
now 32 cannot be taken out of 30, wherefore take a figure
less by an unit or one, viz. 8 times; and finding it will go
8 times, set down 8 in the quotient; and then say 8 times
5 is 40; 0 and carry 4; and 8 times 6 is 48, and 4 is 52,

Then to the remainder 80 I bring down o, the last figure

then you must try how oft you can take 365 out of the said
dividual 800, and the number of places being equal in both
divisor and dividual, to wit, 3, try how oſt 3 in 8; answer
2; so put in the quotient, and say twice 5 is 10, 0 and
carry l; and twice 6 is 12, and 1 is 13; 3 and carry l;
and twice 3 is 6, and 1 is 7; so there is 730 to be deduct
ed from 800, and the remainder is 70, viz.

2920 - eight two pounds per diem, and 70l. over;

tuns in 46242 gallons, and 126 gallons remaining, or over
and above, which being half of 252 the divisor, the remain
der is half a tun more.
When you have a cipher or ciphers on the right hand of
the divisor, in the first, second, or third place, &c. separate

such cipher or ciphers, with a dash of the pen, from the rest
of the divisor; and also cut off as many figures or ciphers
from the right of the dividend as you cut off ciphers from
the divisor, and divide the remaining figures towards
the left hand, by the remaining significant figures of the
divisor. -
Example.
Divide 42952 square poles of land by 160, the square
poles in an acre of land.

When the divisor is 3, 4, 5, 6, or more figures there is
a sure and easy way of performing the work truly by mak

The foregoing table is made by doubling the first line,

said first line, makes 493.824 for the 4th-line, or product,

The Use of the said Table.
When you have pointed out your number of places in
the dividend, cast your eye on the table, and at the first
view.you may know how many times you can take, as in
this example 7 times are too little, and 9 times too much;
wherefore I set down 8 in the quotient, and place 987648,
the tabular number, which stands against 8 under the divi
dend; then I subtract that number from it, and the re
mainder is 6, to which I bring down 1, and place 0 in the
quotient; then to the 63 I bring down 2, and place 0 in the
quotient; then to 632 I bring down I, the last figure of the
dividend; but still it will not bear any times or time, where

To prove Division.
Division may be proved by Division thus:
... If you divide the dividend by the quotient, the quotient
will be your former divisor.
Example. Divide $280 by 345.
+ - 345)8280(24
... Here the working again is needless, it beingjust done,
and shows the truth of the assertion, that Division may be
proved by Division. -
But the most usual way of proving Division is by Mul

As I have given some examples of the utility of Mut
tiplication in Money, I shall here give a few examples in
Division of Money; whereby may be seen how expeditious
ly things may be done without having recourse to Reduc
tion, the Rule of Three,’ &c.
Erample 1. Divide 26t. 12s. 6d. equally among five men.
For disposition of working set it down as follows:
In the working of this H say, the 5's
1. s. d. in 26, 5 times; 5 times 5 is 25; 25.
5}26 12 6 from 26, there remains 1, that is 1
—— pound, or 20 shillings; which, with
5 6-6 the 12s. in the place of shillings, makes
5 32s. then the 5's in the 32, 6 times; 6
times 5 is 30; 30 from 32, there re
Proof 26 12 6 main 2s. or 24d. which with 6d. in the
—— place of pence, makes 30; then the 5's
in 30, 6 times, and so the work is done, and the answer is,
that each man must have 5l. 6s. 6d. for his equal share in
the said division of 16l. 12s. 6d. among five persons; and
the truth of it is proved by Multiplication of Money, suf
ficiently shown in the rule of Muktiplication; as here, 5
tim's 6 is 30, 6 and carry 2; and 5 times 6 is 30, and 2 is
22; 12 and carry..] ; and 5 times 5 is 25, and 1 is 26, &c.
Of ARITIIMET1c. 83
Erample 2. Divide the charges of a country feast,
amounting to 246l. 13s. 4d. equally among 12 stewards, to
know what each steward must pay.
l. s. d. Here l say the 12's in 24 twice,
12)245 13 4 and 12's i. 0 times, and there re
-** mains 6l, or 120s. and 13s. make 133,
Ans. 20 11 1–4 and then the 12's in 133 are 11, and
—— there remains 1s. or 12d. and then
12 and 4 is 16; and the 12's in 16 once, and 4 remain; so
that each steward must pay, 201. 11s. Id. and something
more than a farthing; and this may be proved as above.
When any quantity is such a number that any two di
gits of the Multiplication Table multiplied together make
the said quantity or number, then thequotient may bevery
expeditiously found at two divisions, and sooner than at
one. Example. Divide 7872 by 32. In this example the
component parts, which multiplied together, make the di
visor 32, are 4 and 8, or 8 and 4: for it matters not which
of them you divide by first; for either way will give a true
and the same quotient, as may be seen by the different
methods of the following work. º
4)7872 – Or thus: 8)7872

When it appears that there is any remainder in the first
division, or the last, or both, to know the true remainder
as if divided by the common way, take this method, viz.
multiply the first divisor by the last remainder, and take in,
or add the first remainder, if there be any, and the product
will be the true or same remainder, as if you divided by
the long way. Erample: divide 4567, by 15.
3)4567 Here I multiply 3, the first divisor, by

By this method of Division of Money, you may, by
having the price of several things, know the price or value
of one thing, at the said, rate, as well as by the Rule of

in the Rule of Three, when the first number is a unit, or 1.

The various uses of Multiplication and Division will

Rule of Arithmetic called

REDUCTION;
Which shows how to reduce numbers of one denomina
tion to another, thereby discovering the same value, though
in different terms.
I. As first, all great numbers are brought into smaller
by Multiplication, as pounds into shillings, pence, or
farthings, by multiplying by 20, 12, or 4. Or hundreds
weight into pounds weight, by multiplying by 4 and by 28,
or by 1.12; or lower, into ounces or drams, by multiplying
the pounds by 16 and 16.
II. And on the contrary, all small names are brought into
greater by Division; as farthings into pounds, by dividing
by 4, 12, and 20; and pounds weight into hundreds
weight, by dividing by 28 and 4; the drams into pounds
by dividing 16 and 16. -
But note, That pounds are brought into pence by
multiplying by 240; or into farthings by multiplying
‘by 960; and just the contrary by Division.
Ex. 1. In 240l. Sterling how many pence

These foregoing examples are great names to be brought
into small (as inay easily be observed and understood)
therefore as the rule directs, it is done by Multiplication,
by multiplying the greater name by the number of the
next lesser name that makes one of the said greater; as in
the first example the lesser name to pounds is shillings;
wherefore I multiply, by 20, because 20 of that lesser name
makes one of the said greater name, i. e. 20 shillings make
a pound, And the same regard is had, and method ob
served, in the example of weight, as is very plain to be seen
in the work, and is called Reduction Descending, because
it brings higher or greater, dcnominations into lower or
lesser. . . - * * . - -

In the first way I divide the farthings by 4, because 4 -
make a penny, and the quotient is pence; then the pence
I divide by 12, because 12 make a shilling, and that quo
tient is shillings; these I divide by 20 to bling them into
pounds, thus; I cut off the cipher in the dividend to
wards the right, for the cipher that is in the divisor 20,
which is also separated from 2 with a dash of the pen; then
I halve the figures one by one, as they are united with the
remainder in the dividend; which half is pounds, and is
a short way of dividing by 20; in the example I say the
half of 10 (because I must not set down 0 at the beginning)
is 5, and the half of 3 is 1, but there remains 1, which
makes the next, which is 0, 10; and the half of 10 is 5 ;
so that 10300 shillings make 515 pounds, or there are so
inany pounds in 494400 farthings.
Note, In dividing by 20, as above,' if anything remain
it must be joined or annexed to the figure of cipher cut

(excepting what you cut off) remained 1, then that 1
must have been added to the cipher separated or cut off,
and there would have been 10 shillings.

1n the first of the two foregoing examples I divide the
pounds by 28, to bring them into quarters; then I, divide
those quarters by 4, to bring them into hundreds weight,
as above. . - - - -
In the second way, I divide the pounds weight by 112,
the pounds in 1 Cwt. and it brings the pounds weight into
hundreds weight at once. -
The said examples arc of small denominations to be
brought into greater; and therefore it is done by Division,
by dividing the lesser name by as many of them as make
the greater name: that is by 28, because 28 ºf them
make one of the next greater name, viz. a quarter of an
hundred, and this reduction is called Redaction Ascend
ing, because it brings low or small names to higher or
greater denominations; by which may be observed, that
all questions in Reduction, whether ascending or descend
ing, are answered either by Muhiplication or Division,
or by both ; as will plainly appear in the examples.
When it is required to reduce numbers of several deno
minations by Reduction Ascending, or by Multiplication,
you are to work as before; but you must always remem
ber to take in such numbers as stand in the place of the
next inferior denomination, as when you multiply the

tion, or place of shillings, you must take them in ; so
likewise when you multiply the shillings by 12, if there be
any pence in the place of pence, you must also take them
in ; and so when you multiply the pence by 4, to bring
them into farthings, you must take in the farthings, if there
be any, in the place of farthings, as in the following
work. - -

By the above it appears that 145l. 12s. Sterling is
equivalent to 242l. 13s, 4d. Flemish, at 33s. 3d. Flemish
per pound Sterling. t
Thus Flemish money may be reduced to Sterling money,
though the course of exchange may be at any other rate
of shillings and pence Flemish; but when the rate above,
viz. 33s. 4d. then the answer is sooner found by multiply
ing by 3, and dividing by 5; for 400d. Flemish is the same
to 240d. Sterling, (each being a pound) as 5 is to 3, for
if you divide 400 by 5, it quotes 80; so 240, divided by

The next rule in Arithmetic is
The GOLDEN RULE, or Rule of Tii Ree.
It is called the Golden Rule, from its excellent usc in
Arithmetic, and in other parts of Mathematical learning.
And also denominated the Rule of Three, because by
three numbers given, proposed, or known, we find out a
fourth number required, or unknown, which bears the same
proportion to the third which the second does to the first
number: ,whence also the Rule of Proportion.
. . . . . . . Of
90 Tim F. You NG MAN's Best CoMPANIon.
Of this Proportion there are two sorts; one named
Direct, and the other Indirect, or Reverse. .
Direct Proportion is when the second and third numbers
are to be multiplied together, aud their product divided by
the first.
Indirect or Reverse Proportion, is when the first and
second numbers are to be multiplied together, and their
product divided by the third. -
* In Direct Proportion, the fourth number, or answer to
the question, contains the third number as often (or as
many times) as the second contains the first.
But in Indirect Proportion the greater the third number
is, the less is the fourth; and the smaller the third number
is, the greater is the fourth.
The Stating the Question.
The chief difficulty that occurs in the Rule of Three is
the right placing the numbers, or stating the question;
for when that is done, you have nothing more to do, but to
multiply and divide, and the work is done.
And to this end, we are to remember, that of the three
given numbers, two of them are always of one denomination,
and the other number is of the same name with the fourth
number or answer required; and must always be the second
or middle number. And the number that asks the question
must possess the third or last place, and the other number
of the same name with the third must be the first number;
for the first and third numbers must always be of one name,
viz. both money, both weight, both time, or both measure.
And though they be ofone kind, yet if one of them is altered
by Reduction from a higher to a lower name, then the other
must be reduced to the same name. That is, if either thc
first or third number consist of several denominations, that
is, of pounds and shillings; or pounds, shillings, and pence;
or of pounds, shillings, penee, and ſarthings; or of tons,
hundreds, quarters, and pounds, &c. then must they be
reduced to the lowest name mentioned. And if any one
happens to be of divers denominations, and the other but
of one name, then the number of one name must be reduced
as low, or into the same name with the other. As suppose
the first number is brought into (arthings, the third number
also, though but pounds, must be brought into farthings.
Then you are to multiply the second and third numbers
sº ther, (when the Proportion is Direct) and divide the
- product
Of A RITH M ETIC. 97
product by the first number, and the quotient thence
arising will be the answer to the question, and in the same
name with the middle number: and if in the small denomi
nation, it must be brought by Division to the highest name
for the better understanding the answer. If the middle
number be of several denominations, it must be brought
into the lowest mentioned.

In this example, the product of the third by the second
number is 7900; which divided by the first 365 (according
to the rule) quotes 19 pounds, the name of the middle
number, and there is a remainder of 265; which multi
plied by 20, according to Reduction, the product still
divided by 265, there comes out 14 shillings; and yet there
is a remainder of 190, which multiplied by 12, and the
product divided by 365, gives 6d. and there is a remainder
of 90: which iſ multiplied by 4 (the last inferior name)

The Rule of Three, Inverse or Indirect Proportion.
In Indirect Prºportion, the product of the third and
fourth numbers is equal to the product of the first and sc
cond. - \
But the method ofstating any question in this rule is the
same with that of the direct rule.
For the first and third numbers must be of one name, and
so reduced as in that rule, and the number that asks the
question must possess the third place; and the middle num
ber will be of the same name with the answer as it is there.
To know when the question belongs to the Direct, and when
to the Inverse rule. -
When the question is stated as aforesaid, consider whe
ther the answer to the question ought to be more or less than
the second number; if more, then the lesser of the first and
third numbers must be your divisor ;
But if less, then the greater of the two extreme numbers '
must be your divisor. -

may be a proof to the other, as may be seen in the follow

Here the yards are divided by 4, because 3d. is the 4th of

And thus may any question proposed be answered, be
longing to the second table, or parts ofa pound: that is, by
dividing the given number by the denominator of the frac
tion, and the quotient will always be pounds; and if any
thing remains, it is always so many halves, thirds, fourths,"

you divide by. -
If the price be shillings and pence, or shillings, pence,

I have not here room to speak of the various and almost
infinite methods and rules of Practice, but I shall leave
some general rules, which, if carefully noticed, will be of
the greatest use to learners. These are: -
1. When the price is parts of a farthing, or of a penny,
and 3,3%, &c. then multiply the integers by the numera
tor, and divide by the denominator, and the result will be
either farthings or pence, which reduce to pounds, &c.
2. When the price is pence, and no even part of a shil
ling; as suppose 5d. 7d. 8d. or 9d, then it may be done by
taking their parts, as 3d. and 2d. is 54. and 4d. and 3d. is 7d.
and 4d. and 4d. is 8d, and 6d. and 3d. is 9d. but it is an easy
and sure way to multiply the given number by 5, 7, 8, or
9, then the product is pence, which bring to pounds by ſte
duction. -
3. When the price is pence and parts of a penny, as 13d.
2}d, or 63d. then work for the penny, by taking the #:
for 2d. the # ; and for 6d. the #: then for the faithing take
a 3 of the penny line, and for , 4 of the two-pinny line;
and for # take # of the sixpenny line; then add the results
together, and the total will be shillings, which reduce to
pounds, by dividing by 20. Or by the sure way of bring
ing the mixed number into the lowest denomination; as 13 d.
1I] to
110 Tile You NG MAN's BEST CoMPAN joN.
into 5 farthings; 2%d into 5 halfpence, and 6;d. into 27
farthings; then multiply the integers by 5, and the product
is farthings; or by 5 halfpence, and the product will be
halfpence; or by 27 farthings, and the product will be
farthings; which, whether farthings or pence, reduce to
pounds, &c.
4. When the price is shillings and pence, or shillings,
pence, and farthings, multiply the integers by the shillings
of the price, and take parts of the pence, or pence and
faithings, &c. -
5. If the price be pounds and shillings, or pounds, shih
lings, pence, and farthings, multiply by the shillings in
the price, that is in the pounds and shillings, and take parts
of the pence and farthings.
6. When the number of integers hath a fraction annex
ed, or belonging to them, 4, #, #, &c. then take 3, 4, #, of
the price of one of the integers, and add that to the other
results. -
TARE AND TRETT, &c.
Gross Weight is the weight of goods in hundreds, quar
ters, and pound, with the weight of the hogshead, cask,
ehest, bag, bale, &c. that contains the goods. -
Tare is allowed to the Buyer for the weight of the hogs
head, cask, chest, bag, bale, &c.
Tretë is an allowance made for waste, dust, &e. in sun
dry sorts of goods, as tobacco, cotton, pepper, spices, &c.
and is always 4lb. in each 104lb. Subtile, and found by di
viding the Subtile Pounds by 26, because 4 times 26 make
104lb. When the gross weight is brought into pounds, and
before the tare is deducted, they are called Pounds Gross,
and after the Tare is subtracted the remaining pounds are
called Pounds Subtile, which divided by 26 (as before
stated) quotes Pounds Trett, &c.
Tare at so much per Cask, Hogshead, Bag, &c.
The allowances for Tare are variously wrought, as by the
following Examples:

In this Example the lbs. Tare of one Cask are multiplied.

Tare; and the Gross Weight is reduced into Pounds by
the method'shown in Reduction of Weight; and then the
Pounds Tare are deducted from the Pounds Gross, and the
remainder is Pounds net, viz, 4722, as above.
When the Tare is at so much per Cat, multiply the
number of hundreds by the Tare, and take parts for the
odd weight, adding to it the Tare found by Multiplication,
and dividing by 122 to bring it into Gross Weight in order
for Subtraction, -

There are a few other rules, such as Barter, or exchange
of Goods for Goods, for Coin &c. but these being per
formed either by the Rule of Three, or by Practise it is
needless to enlarge upon them. -
, ()F. FRACTIONS VULGAR AND DECIMAP.
A Fraction is a term for a part or parts of an Unit. ,
A Vulgar Fraction is written with two figures, or num
bors one above another, and a short line drawn between
them. The lower number is called the Denominator, and
this shews in how many equal parts the unit is supposed
to be divided. The higher number is the Numerator,
which shows how many of those paris are meant by the
Fraction. Thusif I want toexpress 7d. as part of a Shilling, I
write "... The Denominator 12 shows the number of pence
in a shilling, and the Numerator 7 is the number given.
if I would express 13 shillings, as a part of a pound I
write #3: or if 35lb. as part of a hundred weight, I write
ºr, because in the first case 20 shillings make 1 pound,
and in the second 112lbs. make 1 cwt.
Fractions are thus set down and read, viz. 3, one fourth;
3, one half; #, one third ; #, one fifth ; ;, one sixth ; ;,
two thirds; #, two fourths; #, five sixths; }, five sevenths,
&c. -
Fractions are either proper or improper: a proper Frac
tion hath its numerator less than the denominator, as #, five
eighths; ##, twenty-four fifty-sixths, &c.
An improper Fraction has its numerator greater than the
denominator; 4, seven thirds; #3, forty-eight fifteenths,
&c. -
Fractions are either Simple or Compound; Simple,
when a part of an unit or integer, or thing, hath but one
numerator, and one denominator; as # of a pound sterling
# of a cwt. # of a tun, ; of a gallon, &c. Compound is a
Fraction of a Fraction, as the # of a 4 of a pound sterling,
which is equal to half a Crown; or when one is divided
into any number of parts, and those parts again sub-divided
into parts, &c.
Again, Fractions are of two kinds, Pulgar and Decimal.
Vulgar Practions are as before stated. Decimal Fractions are
artificially expressed,bysettingdown the numerators only, the
denominators being understood; and are always an unit,
with as many ciphers annexed as there are places in the
numerator;
1 14 Tii E You NG MAN's Best CoMPANIon.
numerator; and therefore may be either 10, or some
power of 10, as 100, 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000, &c.
Decimal Fractions appear, and are worked as whole
numbers, but are distinguished from them by a point or
coinma prefixed thus: .5 is read five tenths; ,32 thirty-two
hundredths; and ,256 two hundred fifty-six thousandths ;
but of their use we shall treat hereafter.
Reduction of Vulgar Fractions is to prepare them ſor
Addition, Subtraction, &c.
1. To reduce a mired Number to an improper Fraction.
Multiply the integer by the denominator, taking in the
Inu ineral Or.
Er. Reduce 12 gallons § to an improper Fraction, thus:
4. -

Answer *, or 51 quarts.
2. To reduce an improper Fraction to a whole or mixed number.
Divide the numerator by the denominator.
Er. Reduce the above to a whole or mixed number thus:
51. 4) 5
4. 12–3 remainder equal to §
Here 12 gallons is the whole number, 3 the fraction,
the same with three quarts.
3. To reduce Fractions to a common Denominator.
Multiply the numerator of each Fraction into all the
denominators except its own, and the product will be a
numerator to that fraction; and so on by the others. The
common denominator is ſound by multiplying all the deno
minators together. - -
Er. Reduce 3, 4, and # of any integer to a common
denominator; thus, twice 4 is 8, and 6 times S is 48, for a
new numerator to #; then 3 times 3 is 9, and 6 times 9 is
54, for a new numerator to #; lastly, 5 times 4 is 20, and
3 times 20 is 60, the numerator to #: Then to find the
common denominator, say 3 times 4 is 12, and 6 times 12
is 72, the common denominator; so that #3 is equal to
$, # is equal to #, and #3 is equal to #. Which may be
thus proved :
3 of a pound is 13 4 48 72) 162 (2 or 23

Here the several numerators are added together, and they
make 162; which placed over the common denominator 73,
make the improper fraction +%; and its value is foulid as
before shewn in the Rule for reducing an improper fraction
to a whole or mixed number. . -
4. To reduce a Praction into its lowest Terms.
Rule. If they are even numbers, take half of the numera
tor and denominator as long as you can; then divide them
by any digit number (i. e. 3, 4, 5, 6, &c.) that will leave
no remainder in either. - - - -
Er. Reduce #: into its lowest terms; thus the half 56 is
28, and the half of 84 is 42, then the half of 28 is 14, and
the half of 42 is 21. So the fraction #3 is reduced to #,
And since these cannot be halved any further, for though
you can have 14, yet you cannot 21, without remainder;
try therefore to divide them by some other digit number;
you will there find that 7 will divide both numerator and
denominator without any remainder; then say the 7's in
14 twice, and the 7's in 31, three times: so the fraction; :
reduced into its lowest terms, will be #; which is of the
same value as #. The working is performed in the follow
Jng manner. - - -

Addition of Vulgar Fractions.
If the Fractions to be added have a common denomina
tor, add the numerators together for a numerator, which
place over the common denominator, and the work is done.
Er. Add 3, 4, and # of a pound sterling together. Thus
2 and 3 is 5, and 4 is 9, the numerator; which place over
5 the common denominator thus 3, and this improper frac
tion 3, is in value 36s. for 9 times 4s. (the 5th of a pound)
is 36s. for if the number 9 be divided by the de- 5).9
nominator 5, I say the 5's in Ol. once, and 4 re- –
mains, which is ; of a pound, or 16s. 1.
But if the Fractions to be added have unequal denomina
tors, they must first be reduced to a common denominator,
by the Rule before shown, before addition can be made;
and then proceed as above. -

Here the numerators are added, and their total is 152;
which divided by 4, the common denominator, quotes 38

3. When compound fractions are to be added to simple
ones, reduce the compound fraction to a simple one, as
before directed; and then proceed as above.
Er. 1. Add + and # to # of # of a pound; thus once 2
is 2, and twice 4 is 8, therefore # is equal to the compound
fraction. Then saying, 2 and 3 is 5, and 2 is 7, the new
numerator, and #, equal to 17s. 6d. will be the answer.
Er. 2. Add + to # of + of a shilling. The work will be .
added to "r, but these inust be brought to a common de
nominator, and the fractions will then be #3, added ##,
which will be 3%, or when brought to the lowest terms # of
a shilling; the 8th of a shilling is144. therefore is 7#d.
That this answer is right is thus proved: I am to add #
of a shilling, or 4%d. to # of ; of a shilling, now the third
of a shilling is 4d. and 3 of 4d, must be 3d.; of course 4}d.
added to 3d. gives 7 d. according to the answer as above.
| Subtraction of Vulgar Fractions.
In this Rule the Fractions must have a common deno
minator, or be reduced to one, before any deduction can
be made. -
Er. What is the difference between 3 and 3 Answer #;
which may be proved by Addition, for 4 and # make #.
Note. The difference between the numerators is the dif.
ference of the fractions. . . . . . . . *--.
Again; from # of a pound take + , : here the fractions
are to be reduced to a common denominator; 36 is the

To subtract a Compound Fraction from a Simple one.
Rule. Reduce the compound Fraction to a simple one,
and work as before.
Er. From #3 take # of #, say twice 8 is 16, and 3 times
9 is 27, therefore #%, is equal to a compound fraction.
Then then # and #3 must be reduced to a common deno
minator, thus, 13 times 27 is 351, the first numerator; 16
times 14 is 224, the second numerator; and 4 times 27 is
378, the common denominator. Subtract 224 the second
numerator from 351 the first numerator, and the remainder
is 127, which place over 378, the common denominator,
thus ### Answer.
JWhen a Simple Fraction is to be deducted from awhole number.
Rule. Subtract the numerator of the fraction from the
Denominator, and place the remainder over the deno
minator, carrying 1 to subtract from the whole number,
&c.
Erample.
From 12l. take # of a pound, thus 5 (the numerator)
from 8 (the denominator) and there remains 3, which
place over the denominator 8, thus #; then 1 from 12 and
there remains 11. So the Answer is £11;, or 611 7s.6d.
Multiplication of W.ulgar Fractions.
Rule. Multiply the numerators into one another for the
numerator of the product, and then do the same by the
denominators, for the denominator of the product.
Er. Multiply 3 of a pound by ; of ditto: say 3 times 5
is 15, the numerator, and 4 times 6 is 24 the denominator.
So the Answer is ##, or in the lowest terms #.
Kou are to observe, that Multiplication in Fractions
lessens the product, though in whole numbers it augments
it; as above #, or 12s. 6d. is less than #, or 16s. 8d. and
also less than the othe fraction $, or 35s.
2. To multiply a whole Number by a Fraction.
Rule. Multiply the integer by the numerator of the
Fraction, and place the product over the denominator.
Note. Multiplication by a Fraction implies the taking
away some part or parts of the multiplicand, and therefore,
may be truly expressed by a compound fraction. Thus
# inultipli d

To multiply a Simple by a Compound Fraction.
Rule. Reduce the Compound Fraction to a Simple one,
according to the foregoing rules, and work as above.
Er. Multiply § of a pound, by 3 of 3 of a pound: say 6
times 6 is 36, and 8 times 12 is $6. So that the answer is
33, or ; in its lowest terms; equal to 7s. 6d.
Division of Vulgar Fractions.
Multiply the numerator of the divisor into the denomi
nator of the dividend, and the product is the denominator,
of the quotient; then multiply the denominator of the divi
sor into the numerator of the dividend and the product will
be the numerator of the quotient.
Er. Divide #3, by 4. The work will stand thus:
- ##### quotient. -
Here 16, multiplied by 2, gives 32; and 15 by 3, gives
45: so the quotient is #3 equal to 1 ##, as in the work.
Again, suppose ## was divided by 3, the quotient will
be ##, equal to 1 integer, or whole thing. And so for any
other Example. -
s Reduction of Decimal Fractions.
What a Decimal Fraction is has been already shown.
The next thing is how to reduce a Vulgar Fraction into a
decimal, which is no more than to annex ciphers at discre
tion (that is 2, 3, or 4, &c.) to the numerator, and then
dividing by the denominator. -
Erample
Of ARITH MEric. 121
Erample 1. Reduce # of a pound sterling to a decimal.
4)300 ) that is, 75 hundredth, equal to 3 qis. of any thing,
— X whether money, weight, measure, &c. as being #,
75 X and is written 75 of 100, and so 25 hundredths is
in Decimals, the quarter of any thing, as being the 4 of a
100, and is expressed,25, and five tenths expresses the half
of any thing, as being the # of 10, as thus ,5.
In Reduction of Decimals it sometimes happens that a
cipher or ciphers must be placed on the left hand of the
decimal, to supply the defect of the want of places in the
quotient of division. In this case, always remember that
so many ciphers as you anner to the denominator of the
vulgar fraction, so many places you must point off in the
quotient towards the left hand; but if there be not so
many places to point off, then you must supply, the
defect by placing a cipher or ciphers to the left of the
decimal.
Erample 2. Reduce 9d, or ºr to the decimal of a shilling,
thus: 12)9,00 equal to ,75, or 75 hundredths of a
- —— shilling, or to 9d.
75
Er. 3. Reduce 9d. to the decimal of a pound sterling.
In this case the denominator of the fraction will be 240,
as 240 pence make a pound, and the work will stand thus,
240)9,0000(,0375 Here are but three places in the
720 -
quotient, viz. 375, and therefore I
- cannot point off 4 for the four ciphers
1800 annexed to 9; wherefore I prefix 0
1680 to the left of the quotient 375, thus
-- ,0375, and then it is 375 ten thousand
1200 parts of an integer; and in vulgar
1200 fiactions it would stand thus +$ºs.
The more ciphers are annexed, when the Answer is not
exact, the nearer will it bring the decimal to the truth: in
most cases, however, four ciphers annexed are sufficient.
But when you are to reduce 4, #, or # (as above) of an in
teger to a decimal, or any number of shillings to decimal
bf a pound, two ciphers are sufficient.
Er. 4. Reduce 3 farthings to the decimal of a pound,

Book-KEEPING is the art of recording mercantile trans
actions in a regular and systematic manner. -
: A Merchant's Books should exhibit the true state of his
affairs. They should show at first sight, as it were, the
particular state of each transaction, and exhibit also the
general result of the whole? and they should be so arranged
as to afford correct and ready information upon every sub
ject for which they may be consulted. * -
Books may be kept either by single or double Entry.
Single Entry is chiefly used in retail business; it is the
most concise and simple method of Book-keeping, but not
the most perfect.
A. Double Entry is generally used in wholesale and mercan
ile affairs, whence it is usually called by way of pre-emi
ence Merchants’ Accounts. Of these we have now to give
an account: and is is not without good reason that most
eople of business and ingenuity are desirous to be masters
of this art; for if we consider the satisfaction that naturally
arises from an account well kept, the pleasure that accrues
o a person by seeing what he gains, by the species ots";

he deals in, and his whole profit by a year's trade, and
thereby also to know the true state of his affairs and cir
cumstances, so that he may, according to discretion, ra
trench or enlarge his expences, &c. as he shall think fit,
the acquirement of this knowledge must surely be de
sireable. - -
The Book of principal use in the business of Double
Entry are the Waste Book, (by some called the Memorial)
Journal, and Ledger.
Waste Book.
In this Book must be daily written in the order of time,
in which it happens, whatever occurs in the way of trade;
buying, selling, receiving, delivering, bargaining, shipping,
&c. without omission of any one thing either bought, sold,
borrowed, &c.
The Waste Book is ruled with one marginal line, and
three lines for pounds, shillings, and pence, and the day of
of the Month, and the Year of our Lord, is inserted in the
middle of the page. In this Book any one may write, and
on occasion, any thing may be blotted out, if not well
entered, or any Error be made. -
JOURNAL.
INTO this Book every article is brought out of the
IWaste Book, but in other terms, in a better style, and in a
fairer hand, without any alteration of ciphers or figures:
and every item is promiscuously set down without intermis
sion, to make the book, or the several entries in it, of more
credit and validity in case of any law dispute, or any con
troversy that may happen between merchant and merchant.
In this book you are to distinguish the Debtor and Creditor
(or in other terms, the Debts and Credits). And to this book
you must have recourse for the particulars of an account
which in the Ledger are entered in one line. In this book
also, the day of the month is usually placed in the middle
of the page: it is ruled with double marginal lines, for
reference to the Ledger, and with three lines for £. s. d.
as the Waste Book. r
Of the Ledger.
From the Journal or Day Book all matters or things are
posted into the Ledger, which by the Spaniards is called

counts. The left-hand side of this book is called the Debtor
and the right the Creditor side: and the Numbers or Folios
of each side must be alike, as 45 Debtor, and also 45 Credi
tor. The day of the Month (in this Book) is set in a nar
row column on the left hand, and the Month on the left of
that: but when I kept Books, the number in the narrow
Column referred to the Journal Page, and the Month and
Day were placed in the broad Column, to the right of that:
and at the Head of each Folio the name of the place of
Residence, and the Year of our Lord; as thus: -

But the Example of these several Books hereafter follow

There are several other Books used by Merchants
besides the three before mentioned ; as the Cash
Book, which is ruled like the Ledger, and in this all
Receipts of Money are entered on the left-haid Folio, and
payments on the right; specifying in every Entry the Day
of the Month (the Year being set ou the Top) for what and
for whose Account the Money was received, or paiti;
and the total Debt or Credit on each side is to be posted
into the Ledger to the account of Cash therein, in one line
of either side, viz. to, or by sundry Accounts, as per Cash
book,

book, Folio, &c. which is to be done once a Month, or at
discretion, and the Particulars of each Side, Article by
- Article, are to be posted into the Ledger to the proper
Accounts to which they belºng : with References in the
Cash Book to the several F-iº's in the Ledgr; and carry
the Balance over Leaf into the Cash Book, by which you
may know at any time what Cash you have, or ought to
have by you. . - -
Another Book, is a Book of Charges of Merchandise,
wherein is to he entered the Custom and petty Changes of
any Goods shipped; as porterage, wharfage, warehouse
room, &c. which once a Month is transferred into the
Cash-bock on the Credit Side, making Reference to the
Book of Charges of Merchandise; and likewise the same
in the Debtor Side of the same Account in the Ledger for
the Amount thereof -
The next Book I shall name, is the Invoice Book, or:
Book of Factories. In this Book are to be copied all
Invoices of Goºds shipped, either for Accompts proper or
portable; and also of Goods received from abroad, which
must always be entered on the Leſt Side, leaving the
Right Side blank; and on the Advice of the Disposal of
Goo is sent abroad, and also on the Sale of Goods received
from abrºad, enter them on the Blank or Right side; so as at
first View may he seen how the Accompt stands, &c.
'I'he next is a Bill-book, in which are entered Bills of
Fxchange accepted, and when they became due; and
when paid, they should be made so in the Margin. -
The next is a Book of Household Expenses for
monthly Charges of Housekeeping; likewise Apparel,
House-rent, Servants Wages, and Pocket Expenses; and
this may be monthly summed up, and carried to the Credit
of Cash. -
B sides the abovementioned, there must be a book to
copy all letters sent abroad, or beyond the seas, in which
the name of the person or persons to whom the letter is
sent must be written full, for the readier finding it.
. Then next, and what is very necessary, a receipt-book,
wherein are given receipts for money, paid and expressed
- for whose account or use, or for what it is received ; to
which the receiving person must set his name for himself,
- or some other, with the year and day of the month on the
top. - - -
* * * - - Lastly,
134 THE You NG MAN's Best Cox PAN fox.
Lastly. A note, or memorandum-book, to minute down
affairs that 9ecur, for the better help of memory, which is
of great use, when there is a multiplicity of business.
Having given an account of the several books and their
use, the next thing will be to give some few rules of aid, to
enable the book-keeper to make proper entries, and to dis
tinguish the several debtors and creditors, viz.
First. For money received, make cash dr. to the party
that paid it, if for his own account, and the party cr.
Secondly. For money paid, make the receiver dr. if for
his own account, and cash cr. -
Thirdly. For goods bought for ready money, make the
goods dr. to cash, and cash cr. by the goods.
Fourthly. Goods sold for ready money just the contrary,
i.e. cash dr. and goods cr. -
Fifthly. Goods bought for time; goods bought are dr.
to the seller of them, and the seller cr. by the goods.
Sixthly. Goods sold for time, just the contrary, i. e. the
party that bought them is dr. to the goods, and the goods
cr. by the party.
Seventhly. Goods bought, part for ready money, and the
rest for time. First, make the goods dr. to the party for
the whole. Secondly, make the party dr. to cash for the
money paid him in part of those goods.
Eighthly. Goods sold, part for ready money, and the
rest for time. First, make the goods dr. to the party for the
whole; secondly, cash dr, to the party received of him in
part of those goods. Or either of these two last rules may
-be made dr. to sundries; as goods bought, dr. to the seller
for so much as is left unpaid, and to cash for so much as is
left unpaid, and to cash for so much paid in ready money;
and so on the contrary for goods sold. */
Ninthly. When you pay money before it is due, and are
to have discount allowed you, make the person dr. to cash
for so much as you pay him, and to profit and loss for the
discount, or make the receiver dr. to sundries, as before.
Profit and Loss is Dr.
To cash for what money you pay and have nothing for
it, as discount of money you receive before due, and for
abatement by composition, houshold expences, &c.
Per Contra, Cr.
By cash for all you receive, and deliver nothing for it, as
discount
*
Book-keepſNº. 135
discount for prompt payment, any legacy left you, money
received with an apprentice, and by the profit of every par
ticular commodity you deal in, by ships in company, by
voyages, &c. - -
To balance, or clear an Account, when full written.
First, if the dr. side be more than the credit, make the
old account cr. by the new ; and if the contrary, make the
new account dr. to the old. But if the dr. side be less
than the credit, then make the old account dr. to the new,
and the new account cr. by the old, for such a rest or sum
as you shall find in the account. - - -
2. An account of company, wherein you have placed
more received of another than his stock, then add as much
on the debit side as you find on the credit side, to the end,
that in the new account you may have so much debit as
you put in, and so much credit as you have received.
3. In accounts of merchandize, you must enter the gain
or loss, before you make the old account cr. by the new,
and the new dr. to the old, for the remainder of the goods
unsold. -
4. In the foreign accompts, which you are to keep with
a double column for the dollars, crowns, or other foreign
coins, as well as their value in l. s. d. which have been re
-ceived or paid, by bills ofexchange for goods sold by factors
or correspondents, or bought by them for the accompts be
fore; here you must first balance the said inward column
of dollars, crowns, &c.
To remove an Accompt full written to another Folio.
Sum up or add the dr. and cr. sides, and see the differ
ence, which place to its opposite. Admit the cr. side ex
ceeds the dr, then you are to write the line in the old ac
compt to balance on the dr. side, to answer the line on the .
cr. side of the new accompt. - º
IIow to balance at the Year's End, and thereby to know the
State of your Affairs and Circumstances. sº
You must make an accompt, of balance on the next void
leaf or folio of your ledger toyour other accompts, but after
so done, do not venture to draw out the accompt of balance
in the said folio till you have made it exact on a she t of
paper, ruled and titled for that purpose, because of mistakes
or errors that may occur or happen in the course of balanc
ing
136 - THE Young MAN's Best CoMPANION.
->
ing your ledger, which are to be rectified, and will cause
erasements or alteration in that accompt, which ought to be
very fair and exact; and after you have made it to bear in
r
the said sheet, copy fair the said account of balance in the
ledger.
The Rules for balancing, are these, viz, , , . . "
1st. Even your account of cash, and bear the net rest to
balance dr. . . .
2dly. Cast up all your goods bought, and those sold, of
*
what kind soever, in each account of goods, and see whether
all goods bought be sold or not; and if any remain unsold,
value them as they cost you, or according to the present
market price, ready money, and bear the net rest to ba
lance dr. . . . . . . . . . .
3dly. See what your goods or wares severally cost, and
also how much they were sold for, and bear the net gain or
loss to the accompt of profit and loss. - -
, 4thly. Even all the personal accompts with your drs. and
your cºs. in order as they lie, and bear the not rest of them
severally to balance. - * * -
5thly. Even your voyages, your factors accompts, where
in is either gain or loss, and bear the net gain or loss to the
accompt of profit and loss to the goods unsold to balance.
6thly. Even the accompt of profit and loss, and bear the
net rest to stock or capital, as an advance to your stock or
capital. - - -
7thly. Even yourstock, and bear the net rest to balance
cr. Then cast up the dr. and cr. sides of your balance, and
if they come out both alike, then are your accompts well
kept; otherwise you must find out your error, by pricking
over your books again to see whether you have entered
every dr. and cr. in the ledger as you ought. -
Note. By pricking over the book is meant, an eramining
every article ºf the journal against the ledger, and marking it
thus : or thus + , and upon the second evamination thus f ; and
upon a third examination thus $; or any other mark.
Note also. In all accompts of goods, you must keep a co
lumn in the middle of the leaf, of each side,for number, weight,
or measure. -
Though all that hath been said in relation to book-keep
ing, and the several rules thereunto belonging, may seem a
little abstruse to the altogether unlearned therein, yet there
is no such mighty difficulty to instruct them as they may
imagine. The following hints may render what hath been
already said intelligible to an ordinary capacity.
Book KEEPING. 137
1st, Stick close to the text, or general rules before-men
tioned, viz. That all things received, or the receiver, are
debtor to all things delivered, or the deliverer; for this rule
holds good in all cases. *
2d. When the dr. (whether persons or goods) is known,
the cr. is easily understood without mentioning it; for if
. A. be dr. to B. then B. is cr. by A. for what sum soever it
be. Also, if goods be dr. to C. then C. is cr. by those goods
for the sum they amount to. * .
3dly. This art of book-keeping is called Book-keeping by
Double Entry, because there must be two entries, the first
being a charging of a person, money, or goods, and the sc
cond a discharging of a person, money, or goods. -
4thly, strictly note, That if the first entry be on the dr. or
left hand side of your ledger, the next or second entry must
always be made on the right or credit side of your ſedger;
for when one person or thing is charged, then always ano
ther person or thing is discharged for the said sum, let it be
what it will. - - - -
And so it is in balancing an accompt, and carrying it to
anotherfolio; for if the old accompt be settled by the ba
lance on the credit side, then the new accompt must be de
bited or charged on the debit side for the sum that balanced
the old account. - -
Much more might be said on this Art of Book-keeping, if
I had room; but I have said what I hope may be sufficient
for the instruction and improvement ofany reader.
The next matter I shall go upon is to shew, or give ex
amples of various kinds of receipts and promissory notes;
also bills of parcels in different trades ; likewise bills of
book-delts, billsofexchange, with remarks on them, and some
other precedents of writings in trade and mercantile affairs.

Note. The sum received must always be erpressed in words
at length, and not in figures, in the body of the receipt; but it
may, and ought to be expressed in figures between two lines on
the left hand of the name at the bottom of the receipt, as well
as in the body of the receipt. ' ' ' '. -
When a receiptis given in a book, thereis no occasion to
mention the man's name of whom you receive the money,
because that is implied, he being the owner of the book.

Here it will be proper to give a general rule for'casting
up any thing sold by the thousand; as bricks, tiles, &c.
and other things mentioned in the book of rates, viz. barrel
hoops, goose quills, oranges, and lemons, squirrel skins, bil
lets, &c. Which is as follows, viz.:
Multiply the given number by the shittings in the price
(if the price be at so many shillings per thousand), always
cutting off three figures or places on the right hand; and
the figures towards the left hand are shillings, which divide
by 20, to bring them into pounds; and those figures sepa
rated toward the right hand multiply by 12, the next infe
rior denomination, and still cut off or separate three places

are pence; and cutting the three last figures off, multiply
by 4, still separating three places toward the right hand,
and the figures toward the left hand are farthings.-If the

things per thousand, multiply by the shillings as before, and
take parts for the pence and farthings, as in the rule of

Of Bills of Erchange.
Bills of exchange are cither inland or foreign. The in
land bills are drawn by one trader in one city or town, upon
another of another city or town, in the same kingdom ; as
London upon Bristol, or Exeter upon London, &c. and these
chiefly concern shop-keepers, and wholesale traders either
in town or country; and theforeign more immediately con
cern the merchants. * * *
Bills of Exchange, if handsomely drawn, must be written
in a fair hand, on a long piece of paper, about three inches
broad, and written in form after the following precedents :
Form of a Bill payable at Sight.
- London, 5th April, 1810.
At sight pay to Mr. Gregorius Grandy, or his order, the
sum of fifty pounds for value received of Christopher Cut
purse, and place it to account, as per advice from

Seven days after sight pay to Mr. Nat. Needy, or his or.
der, twenty-four pounds ten shillings for value received of Mr.
Timothy Transfer, and place it to account, as per advice from

Cheapside, London. Mark Moneypenny.
if Mr. Needy send his servant, Abraham Honesty, to re
ceive the money, after he has written his own name on the
back of the bill, (which is his order) the servant must write
a receipt to his master's name, thus:
- Received for Nat. Needy,
Abraham Honesty.
Usance is a determined time fixed for payment of bills
of exchange, and reckoned cither from the day of their be
ing accepted, or from the day of their date. This is called
Usance, because regulated by the usage or custom of places
on which they are drawn. - . .

Remarks on Bills of Erchange.
1. The acceptor of any bill is the absolute debtor to the
person to whom the bill is payable, for the contents thereof.
2. The person to whom the bill is payable, must demand
the money the very day it be comes due, and if the acceptor
dies before it becomes due, it must be demanded of the ex
ecutor or administrator. - -
3. The drawer of any bill must always give his corres
pondent a letter of advice, that he has drawn such a bill
on him for such a particular sum, &c.
4. There
Book. KEEPIN G. - 149
4. There is no obligation to pay a bill without such let
ter of advice.
5. In England a bill is due the third day after the expira
tion of the time mentioned in the bill.
º
Of Indorsing Bills and Notes.
It frequently happens, that between the acceptance of a
bill and the time of payment, the party to whom it is first
made payable has occasion to pay it away." In this case
he writes his name on the back of the bill, which is his
ðrder, and gives it to the person to whom he is indebted ;
he is then empowered to receive the money: and if the se
cond person also wants to pay it away, then he likewise
writes his name under the other, and delivers it to a third
person to receive the money; and it may happen the third
does the same, and delivers it to a fourth person, &c. All
that thus do are indorsers; and he that last has the bill, if
the acceptor will not pay it, may sue him, or the indorsers,
or drawer, or any of them, for the money.
An indorsement is sometimes in these words, viz. Pay the
contents ofthe within-mentioned bill Henry Hasty.
George Greedy,
But generally the name only is counted sufficient.
**
Of Protesting.
When a bill is to be protested, the party who is in posses
sion of the bill must go to a notary public, (not a common
scrivener) whose business it is ; and he goes to the accep
tor's house and demands payment, &c. He then draws up
a protest according to law; which is to be returned to the
drawer, or the person from whom he received it, within
the time limited, &c. -
It is quite unnecessary to give the form of a protest, as :
no person can do it for himself.

Business on the wharf, concerning erporting and importing of
goods, &c. Entering then at the custom-house, &c.
When there are goods to export, and ready packed, &c.
there must be first made a bill of entry (as itis called) of the
contents, after this form, viz,
In the Loyal Briton, Abraham Handy, for Barbadoes.
Edwin Erport.
Three cases of haberdashery. -
Five tuns of becr, &c., Qf,
Book-KEEPIN.G. . 153
Of these bills there must be seven, one of which must be
in words at length, and the other may be expressed in
figures. These are by the clerks of the custom-house en
tered into several books kept for that purpose. If some of
, the articles pay custom, and others not, then there must
two entries be made ; one for those that pay custom, and
another for those that do not; and you must likewise have
two cockets.
A Cocket testifies the payment of all duties, and is writ
ten on a small piece of parchment as follows:—
Know ye, that Edwin Export, merchant, for three cases
of haberdashery, and five tuns of beer, in the Loyal Biton,
Abraham Handy, for Barbadoes, hath paid all duties.—
Dated the 9th of November, 1809.
On the back of the cocket must be set down the marks,
numbers, and quantity of the articles expressed in the in
side. Then on clean paper transcribe your bill of entry, .
upon which a shipping bill will be made out, on the back
of which signify the marks, numbers, and contents, as bc
fore, on the cocket, both of which being thus indorsed, are
to be delivered to the searcher at the water-side, who depo
sits them in the office till the going away of the ship; they .
are then delivered to the Captain or Master of the ship.
Jf you have not knowledge or experience enough to en
ter your goods yourself, application must be made to one
of the clerks in the long room, who make it their business
to enter goods; they will write out bills, and pass your
entries, without any further trouble, or your running a risk
of making any false entries, &c. for which you will pay .
him one shilling.
Entry Inwards.
On a ship's arrival, search the entry book in the long
room, and you will find the name of the ship and Captain,
as also the waiters that are to attend the delivery of the
ship, and at what wharf the goods will be landed. The en
try inwards runs thus : -
In the Mercury, Jacob Keelson, from Antigua...
25 hlids. of sugar, &c,
56 bags of cotton, &c.
There must be eight of these bills (though but seven out---
wards) and one of these also must be in words at length, which
is for the warrant of delivery, and must be signed by the
H 5 . person .

person in whose name the goods were entered, and the mark
also in the margin, which being done, and the fee for en-.
try and custom paid, you will then have from the land
waiters a warrant for the landing and receiving your goods.
When goods are to be exported by certificate, viz. fo
reign goods formerly imported, these goods being to be sent
abroad, or exported to another place or country by a na
tive of England within twelve, or a stranger within nine
months after importation, entitles the exporter to a draw
back of part of the custom paid on the importation of the
said goods, upon producing a certificate from the comptrol
ler that they have paid the duties inwards. And the de
benture of custom drawback runs thus:
Debenture.

an entry with us of two thousand ells of broad German linen,

Besides these, there are certain places called Docks,
which are harbours cut into the land, where there is no
current, but only a flow and an ebb, occasioned by the rise
and fall of the tide in the river Thames, and these are con

The smaller dock contains an area of 24 acres, and is de
voted solely to the business of loading outwards. The pro
prietors of these great works are styled the India Dock Com

money. To reimburse themselves, they lay a tonnage of

OF THE MENSURATION OF PLAINS & SOLIDS,
The several kinds of Measuring are three, viz.
1st. Lineal, by some called Running Measure, and is :
taken by a line, and represents length without breadth; the
parts of which are, -
12 Inches 1 foot, 3 feet 1 yard, 16 feet and a half I rod,
pole, or perch.
All kinds of ornamental work, such as a cornice, frieze,.
&c. are measured by Running Measure. -
2dly, Superficial or Square Measure, is that which re
spects length and breadth, and the parts are, -
144 Inches 1 foot, 72 inches half a foot, 36-inches one
quarter of a foot, 18 inches half a quarter of a foot, 272
feet and a quarter 1 rod, 136 feet half a rod; 1296 inches,
or 9 feet, one superficial, or square yard. -
3dly, Solid, or Cube Measure, which respects length,
breadth, and depth, or thickness, and the parts are,
1728 Inches 1 foot, 1296 inches three quarters of a foot,
864 inches half a foot, 432 inches one quarter of a foot, and,
27 feet one solid yard. - -
Superficial Measure.
To measure things that have length and breadth, such
as board, glass, pavement, wainscot,and land, is to take the
dimensions of the length and breadth, according to the
customary methods used in each particular: for instance,
board and glass are measured by the foot, the dimen
sions are taken in feet and inches, and the contents given
in feet. - -
The dimension of wainscoting and paving, plastering,
and painting, are taken in feet and inches, and the con
tents given in yards.
Of the Square and Superficial Contents or Area.
The squaring of any numbel is mu't lying it into itself,
Mensur AT10N. 157
as 12 inches multiplied by 12-inches make 144 square
inches. The superficial content or area of any thing is
found four several ways, viz. by whole numbers, by deci
mals, by practice, and by cross multiplication, in each of
which methods I shall give examples of operation.
A rectangle hath its sides perpendicular, and these that
are opposite equal; but the adjacent sides are unequal:
boards, wainscots, ceilings, windows, doors, &c. are com
monly of this figure.
When any thing is to be measured, it must be considered
what form or fashion it is of, and then it must be measured
according to the several Rules for cach figure.
First. If it be a square or oblong, then the length and
breadth must be multiplied one by the other, which gives:
the contents in square measure, and that product must be
divided by its proper divisor, according to 1he name in:
which the content or area is to be given. - -

Here the length in inches is multiplied by the breadth in
inches, and the product 1152 divided by 144, the square
inches in a foot, quotes 8 feet square for the content of the
board. -
A Rule for Dispatch. -
If the length of a board, or piece of glass, be given in
feet, and the breadth in inches, multiply one by the other,
(without any reduction) and divide the product by 12, and
the quotient will be the answer in feet, and the remainder
will be parts of a foot. So the foregoing Example might
have been done sooner by dividing 96 the length by 12 the
breadth, and it quotes 8 feet for the content, by the
former way. -

Answer 15 7 6. - 15, 7%
The four methods here used are as follow: first by mul
tiplying the inches together, and dividing by 144, &c.
The second work is performed decimally: the third me
thod is by cross multiplication, and the last and best is
by practice.
Any of these methods may be easily understood by the
use of the arithmetical part of this Book, except the me
thod by crosss multiplication, which may be thus ex
plained:
Rule. Under the multiplicand write the corresponding
denominations of the multiplier. Multiply each term in
the multiplicand, beginning at the lowest, by the feet in the
multiplier, write each result under each respective term;
carrying an unit for every 12, from each lower name to
its next higher.
Note. Feet multiplied by feet give feet:-Feet multi
plied by inches give inches: but inches multiplied by
inches give seconds.
In the same way multiply all the terms of the multi
plicand by the inches in the multiplier, writing the result
of each term one place removed to the right hand of those
in the multiplicand. Do the same with the seconds in the
multiplier, getting the result of each term two places
removed to the right hand of those in the multiplicand.
Thus in the examples I say, once 6 is 6, and once 12 is
F2;--then with the 3 inches I say, 3 times 6 is 18, that
is 6 and carry 1, (putting the 6 to the right hand of the
line of inches).3 times 12 are '36 and 1 are 37, but 37
inches are 3 feet, one inch, which I put in their proper
places. I now add the two rows together, which make 15
feet, 7 inches, and 6 seconds. -

Carpenters' Work.
Roofing, flooring, and partitioning, the principal parts

square of 10 feet each way, that is 100 square fect.
For roofing, multiply the depth and half depth by the
front, or the front and half front by the depth, and you.
will have the contents, if the roof is true pitch.

whole, except they are included by agreement, in that case
the doors, door-cases, and windows must be mentioned in
the written agreement.
There are various sorts of carpenters' work belonging to
a building, viz. cornices, guttering, shelves, dressers, &c.
all which are measured by superficial measure. There are
also doors and door-cases, lantern-lights with their orna
ments, cellar-doors, curbs, columns and pilasters, which
all are valued by the piece, or superficial foot.
Carpenters measure the frames of any building, (which -
they call the carcass) by the square of 10 superficial mea

Sawyers' Work.
It may not be improper here to add something relative to
the method used by sawyers in measuring their work, which
when they perform by the Great, as they term it, they
most commonly measure by the superficial foot; so that it
is not difficult to take the dimensions; for they account the
depth of the kerfs for the breadth, and the length for the
length. The dimensions being thus taken in feet, the con
tents of one superficial kerf may be found by multiplying
the length by the breadth, then having found the number of
feet in one kerf, multiply it by the number of kerfs of the
same dimensions, which gives the number of feet in them
all. - -

Of Walling.
Walling is measured by the rod statute measure, being
272 feet and 3 superficial. The method of taking the
-dimensions for a wall round the orchard or the like, is by
measuring the length by a line going over the buttresses;
and for the height by measuring over the mouldings, (pres
sing the line into them,) even to the middle of the coping:
likewise in taking notice of the thickness of the wall, i. e.
how many half bricks in length the wall is in thickness;.
for three half bricks, that is a brick in...length, and one in
breadth, is standard thickness; and all walls, whether more
or lºss must be reduced to this standard by this rule, viz.
multiply the product of the length and height, by the
number of half bricks that the wall is in thickness; which
product being divided by 3, the quotient will be 272 (the
# being generally neglected,) and the quotient-will be rods,
one brick and a half thick, standard measure. . ."

When the work is wrought Decimally, divide by 2723,

the measuring of brick-work may be shortened by having
the rod of 16 feet 3 divided into 100 equal parts, with
which you take the dimensions, and length of the wall in
those rods; and 100 parts multiplied by the height give
the contents in rods of any wall that is a brick and half
thick. Deduction must be made for doors, windows, &c. .

Of Chinnies.
This kind of brick-work is commonly agreed for by the
hearth, and sometimes by the rod; and the method of tak
ing dimensions thus:–If the chimney stands not leaning
against, or being in a wall, and worked upright over the
mantle-tree to the next floor, it is girt about the breast for
the length, and the height of the story is taken for the
breadth, and the thickness of the jambs for the thickness.
But if the chimney stands against, or in a wall, which is
before measured with the rest of the building, then the
breadth of the breast or front, together with the depth of
the two jambs, is the length; the height of the story the
breadth, and the thickness of the jambs the thickness. But
if the chimney stands in the corner of a room, and has no
jambs, then the breadth of the breast is the breadth, the
height of the story the length, and the thickness the thick
ness; and, for the shaft, it is commonly girt in the smallest
part for the length, and the thickness of both sides for the
thickness, in consideration of the widths, pargetting, scuſ
folding, &c.
There is nothing to be deducted for the vacancy between
the hearth and the mantle-tree, because of the width and
the thickening for the next hearth above.
Of Gable Ends.
Take halfthe perpendicular for the breadth; the width
of the house for the length, or half the width of the house
for the breadth, and the perpendicular for the length,
which brings the measure to an oblong, and the contents
are found by multiplying the length by the breadth, &c.
Note.—There are several other things in bricklayer's
work, as cornice, facias, straight arches, scheme arches,
hips and valleys in tiling, and water-courses : all which are
measured by the foot. Also piers, pilasters, rustic work,
&c. which are valued by the piece.

Slating
Is valued by the square of 100 feet, in some places by

G” In tiling and slating, where there are gutters and val
leys, there is commonly an allowance, which is to take the
length of the roof all along the ridge, making the gutter
double measure ; this is allowed in some places. Some
times there is an addition for hollow ware, that is ridge
tiles, gutter tiles, corner and dormar tiles; and here cus
toms differ; for in some places one superficial foot is count
ed for every lineal foot or running measure; then 100 feet
lineal is reckoned a square. In other places, for every 100
of such tiles is reckoned a square.

Plasterer's IWork
Is of two kinds, viz. First, Work lathed and plastered,
sometimes called ceiling. Secondly, Plastering upon brick
work, or between the quarters in partitioning, by some cal
led rendering; both which are measured by the yard
square, as by the joiners and painters. In taking dimen
sions of a ceiling, if the room be wainscoted, consider how
far the cornice bears into the room, by putting up a stick
perpendicular to the ceiling, close to the edge of the upper
most part of the cornice; measuring the distance from the
perpendicular stick to the wainscot, twice which distance
must be deducted from the length and breadth of the room
taken upon the floor, and the remainder is the true length
and breadth of the ceiling. As if a floor be 24 feet long,
and 18 feet broad, ºnd the cornice shoots out 6 inches,
deduct 1 foot for both ends, and the length of the ceiling
is 23 feet; the same for the breadth, and it leaves 17 feet
broad; which multiplied together, gives the contents as 391
feet; or 43 yards and a half, nearly, thus:

Land Measure.
Land is usually measured by the acre. The dimensions
are taken with a chain of four poles in length, which is di
vided into 100 parts, called links, and 10 square chains
make an acre. Let them be 10 in length, and 1 in breadth,
or 5 in length and 2 in breadth, &c. or 160 square poles;
but to find the contents, (if not regularly square) it is gene
rally divided into triangles ; Thus a piece of land of 4 sides,
(if not square) may be divided into two triangles, pieces of
5 sides into 3, and a 6-sided piece into 4 triangles, and so
Oil,
To measure a Triangle.
Admit the longest side of the following triangle, viz. AD
to be 76 poles; and the perpendicular or dotted line BC
to be 30 poles; multiply '76 (the base) by 15, the half of
the perpendicular B C, and it produces 1140 : or multiply
the whole perpendicular by half the base, (or longest side)
it will produce the same; which divided by 160, (the
square poles in an acre) the quotient gives the contents of
that piece of land in acres; multiply what remains by 4,
dividing by the same divisor, and it gives roods, &c.
The perpendicular is always drawn from the opposite
angle to the base, or longest side, as in the following

To reduce Statute to Customary Measure.
According to a statute made in the 33d of Edward I. and
another in the 25th of queen Elizabeth, a statute pole is 16
feet and a half long, but in some parts of England poles of
18, others of 21, and some of 24 feet long, are used, called
customary measure, being in use according to the custom
of the place where they are taken. Therefore, to turn one
kind of measure into another, admit statute measure to be
turned into customary, as thus: multiply the number of
acres, roods, and poles, statute-measure, by the square half
yards, or square half feet in a square pole of statute mea
sure, dividing the product by the square half-yards, or
square half feet contained in the pole of the customary
measure, and the quotient gives the answer in the latter, in

To know the contents of a piece of timber by common
or decimal arithmetic, observe as follows, vir.—The tree
being girted, and one fourth part taken for the side of the
square, multiply the length of the side of the square in
inches into itself, and that product by the length in feet;
which product divide by 144: but if you multiply by the
length in inches, then your divisor must be 1728, and if
any thing remains, divide by 12, and the quotient will be
the odd inches.

way is to multiply half the diameter into half the circum
ference, and then multiply that product by the length,
which divide by 1728, and the quotient is the contents. If
you cannot measure the end of the piece, you may know

Of Solid Measure.
Solid or cube measure has been already defined, as well
as superficial measure, some of the figures of which are
numbered 6, 7, and 8.
To measure a solid in form of a cube, which is in
length, breadth, and thickness equal, multiply these into
themselves, and the last product will give the solidity or
contents. A cube has six sides, and is in shape like a die.

Of Gauging. -
There is some kind of affinity between the art of measur

being performed by cube or solid measure. For as often as
there is found 1728 solid or cubic inches in a picce of tim
ber, of whatever form, it is said to contain so many solid
feet; so likewise in gauging; so many times as QS 1 (the
solid inches in a becr or ale gallon) are found in any vessel
of such liquor, that vessel is said to hold so many gallens;
so of wine; only in that the divisor alters, it being 231 solid
or cubic inches, instead of 282. - - -
The gallon of dry measure contains 272; cubical inches.
Every cubical foot in beer or ale measure contains 6
gºi!ons and almost a pint,
- The same in wine measure is 7 gallons, and almost 2
quarts. . . . . . .
A cubical foot of dry measure contains 6 gallons and
somewhat above one third of a gallon. .

The Extractions of the Square and Cuhe Root, of great Use
in Measuring, Gauging, &c.
Of the Square Rout.
1st. A square number arises from the multiplication of a
number into itself, the number so multiplied being called
the root; thus 4 multiplied by 4 produces 16, for 16 is a
square number, and 4 is the root thereof; so also 4 is the
square of 2, for twice 2 is 4, and 9 is the root of 81, for 9
times 9 is 81, &c. º
2dly. To extract the square root of any number is to find
another number, which multiplied into itself, produces the

tive roots, are contained in the following tables, viz.

5thly. When the square foot of any number less than 100
is required, and that number is not expressed in the forego
ing table, then take the root of that square number in the
table which is the least nearest to the given number. Thus,
if the square root of 50 be required, then as 49 is the nearest
square number in the table, its root, 7, will be the root of
the given number, nearly.
6thly. A compound square number is that which is pro
duced by a number consisting of more places than 1, mul
tiplied by itself, and is never less than 100; so 729 is a
compound square number, produced by the multiplying 27
into itself, and 961 is the square of 31.
7thly. The root of any number under 100 may be easily
known by the foregoing table of single squares; but to ex
tract the root of a compound number of several places, ob
serve the following directions: - -
Er. To find the square root ofthe number 45796.
1. Set a point over the place of the units thus, 45796,

Uses of the Square and Cube Roots.
1. To find a Mean Proportional between two Numbers.
Rule.—The square roet of the product of the given num
bers, is the mean proportional sought: so the mean propor
tional between 16 and 64, will be 32, for 16 multiplied by
64 produces 1924, and the square of 32 is also 1024.
This is the use in finding the side of a square equal to any
parallelogram, rhomb, rhomboid, triangle, or regular
polygon. -
2. To find the Side of a Square equal to the area of a given.
Superficies. -
Rule.—The square root of the contents of any given su
perficies is the side of the square. So if the content of a
given circle be 160, the side of the square equal will be
12,649, &c.

squares of the base and perpendicular, that is, of the other
two sides.
1. Let the base or ground B A fig. 13, represent the
breadth of a moat or ditch, and the perpendicular, B C the
heighth of a castle, tower, or wall; and the hypothenuse A
C the length of a scaling ladder.
In this figure the base AB is supposed to contain 40
yards; and the perpendicular, or height of the tower, or
wall, 30 yards; what length will the hypothenuse AC, or
scaling ladder be? -
Rule.—The square root of the sum of the squares of the
base and perpendicular is the length of the hypothenuse,
thus: - -
1600 the square of the base 40.
900 the square of the perpendicular 30.
-
The sum 2500 (50 yards the root or length of the scaling
25 ladder.
(0) -
2. If the length of the base or breadth of the ditch were
required, then the square root of the difference of the
squares of the hypothenuse and perpendicular is the length
of the base, or breadth of the ditch or noat, thus:
2500 the square ofthe hypothenuse AC.
900 the square of the perpendicular BC.
The differ. 1600 (40 Yards, the root or breadth of the
16 ditch.

An easy Rule to find the Length of the Mast of a Ship.
The mast always bears a certain proportion to the breadth
of the ship ; whatever be the breadth of the vessel, multiply
it by 12, and divide the product by 5, which gives the
length of the main mast. Thus a ship 30 feet broad, in
the widest part, will have a mast 72 feet long. And a ship
40 feet broad, will have a mast 96 feet high, for 47=12x
480, and 480 divided by 5, gives 96. -
To find the Thickness of Masts. -
The thickness of masts is estimated by allowing one inch.
for every three feet in length ; accordingly, a mast 72 feet
long, must be 24 inches in diameter.
SOME USEFUL GEOMETRICAL PROBLEMS.
At a given Point near the middle ofa Right Line, to Erect gº
Perpendicular. --
Let CD (fig. 14) be the line given; to have a perpendi
cular erect it from the point B, with the compasses
(opened at a convenient distance) place one foot at the
foot B, and with the other make the two marks E and F,
on each side of B, and at equal distances from it; then,
with the same, or at any other distanee in the compasses,
set one point on E, and with the other describe the arch G
G; which being done, without altering the compasses, set
one point at F, and with the other describe the arc HH,
crossing the former at the point At; through which inter
seetion, with a ruler draw a line from A to B, which will
be perpendicular to the line CD.
To raise a Perpendicular at or near the end of a Line.
This is effected several ways; but I shall instance only
two, which are very easy.
1st,
GeoMETRicar. ProE LEMs. 211
1st Suppose the line AB (fig. 15.) be given to raise a
Perpendicular near the end, A.
First open your compasses to a convenient distance, and
set one foot on the point A ; and with the other describe
the arc FED; then with one foot of the compasses in D,
(they being kept to the same distance) cross the arc in E,
and then setting one foot in E, with the other make the arc
AFG, crossing the first arc in F. Again set one foot in F,
and with the other describe the small arc HH, crossing the
former in the point C; so the line AC being drawn, will be
the perpendicular required.
2d. Let B be the given point on which to draw the per
pendicular BI. Open the compasses to any convenient
distance; and setting one foot on the point B, pitch down
the other foot at random, as suppose K, then the foot rest
ing in K, turn the other about till it cross the line AB in
L; then draw the line KL, and continue the same beyond
K, setting off the same distance KL, (at which the come
passes already stand) from K to M, so a line drawn from B,
through M will be the perpendicular required.
3. How to divide a Right Line into Two equal Parts.
Suppose the line AB (fig. 16.) be given to be divided into
two equal parts. Take in the compasses any distance
above half the length of AB, and setting one foot on the
point A, with the other draw the arc FDE; then (with the
compasses unaltered) set one foot in B, and with the other
cross the former arc both above and below the line, in the
points F and G, then a line drawn from F to G shall inter
sect, or cut the given line in II, and divide the line AB into
equal parts, AH and D.B. -
4. A Line being given, how to draw another Line parallel
thereto, at any distance required, or through any point as
signed.
Of parallel lines there are two sorts, viz. Straight or Cir"
cular. And all circles drawn on the same centre, whether
greater or less one than the other, are said to be parallel or
concentric, that is, having one common centre.
In this figure the circle ABCD (fig. 17.) is concentric or
parallel to the circles EFGH, because both of them are
drawn from the same centre. The line 4C is the diameter
- of
ºf 2 T11 p. YouNg MAN's Best CoMPANIon.
of the greater circle, and the line EG of the lesser circle.
And all right lines drawn from the centre to either of the
circumferences, are equal with respect to their periphery;
and such lines are called half diameters, and sometimes the
raditis of the circle, and will divide the circle into six
equal parts, each containing 60 degrees, and the whole
circle 360; into which all the great circles of the sphere
are supposed to be divided.
Of Parallel Right Lines.
Right-lined parallels are lines drawn on a plane of equal
length and distance; and though infinitely extended will
never meet, and in all parts retain an equal distance as un
derneath. -
-- .
- C D
To draw a Right Line parallel to another Right Line at a
* Distance given., -
Take in your compasses the given distance GH (fig. 18.)
then setting one foot in E, draw the arc IK ; then moving
to F, describe the are LM ; then laying a ruler on the top of
the two arcs, just touching them, draw the line NO which
will be parallel to the given line EF.
5. Through any three Points (not in a straight line) to de
scribe a Circle. - -
Let the pointsgiven be AB and C,(fig. 19.) through which
it is required that a circle be drawn. First, set one foot of
the compasses in one of the given points, as suppose in A"
and extend the other foot to B, another of the points, and
draw the arc of a circle GFD; then (the compasses not al
tered) set one foot in B, and with the other cross the said
arc with two small arcs, in the points D and E; and draw
the line DE. Thirdly, set one foot in C (the compasses be
ing at the same distance) and with the other foot cross the
first arc GFD in the points F and G, and draw the line FG,
crossing the line DE in the point O, which is the centre
sought for; in which, place one foot of the compasses, and
describe the circle at the distance OA, and it will pass.

How to make the line ofChords Geometrically to any assign
- cd Length or Radius. -
As in the art of dialling, frequent use is made of the line
of chords, it is proper here to show the making thereof. :
A line of chords is 90 degrees of the arc of a circle trans
ferred from the limb of the circle, to a straight line; now
every circle, whether great or small, is divided (or supposed
to be divided) into 360 equal parts, called degrees; so the
semi-circle contains 180; the quadrant, or quarter, 90, and
the radius, or semi-diameter, (which is that line with which
the circle or semi-circle is drawn or described) is always
equal to 60 degrees of that circle which it describes, and
therefore 60 degrees of a line.
To make the Line of Chords.
First draw a line to any length, CBD (fig. 20.) and on the
middle thereof, erect the perpendicular AB; next open
your compasses to the radius or length that you would have
your line of chords be, which admit AB, and with that.
distance on B as the centre, describe or draw the semi
circle CAD, which is divided into two equal parts or qua
drants by the perpendicular line AB; thirdly, divide the
arc or quadrant 4D into 9 egual parts, each of which will
be 10 degrees, according as the numbers are seen and set
apart to them. The quad: ant.AD, being thus divided into'
parts of 10 degrees each, set one foot of the compasses in
I), and open the ſoot to 90, and describe the are 90 A,
touching the line CD in 4, so is the point 4 upon the right
line CD, the chord of 98 degrees. Open the compasses
from D to 80 degreſs, and describe the arc 80 b, so shall
the point b be the chord of 80 deg. Open the compasses
from D to 70, describe the arc 70 c, c the chord of 70 de
grees, and so of the rest, and then you will have the line
DA, divided into 9 unequal parts, called chords, as in fig.
20, and if the quadrant he large enough, each of the paits:
inity be sitbdivided into tº n others, in the swine iuanner, a.d
then you have the chords of 99 degrºes.
- - Thus
214 - THE You NG MAN's Best Companion.
Thus much for the line of chords frequently made use
of in dialling, where there is not the conveniency of having
a mathematical instrument maker near at hand.
Note—A degree is the 360th part of the Globe, or of any
circle; and each degree is supposed to be divided into 60parts,
called minutes; so that 45 minutes is three quarters of a de
gree, and 30 minutes half a degree, and 15 minutes one quar
ºfer ofa degree. -

INSTRUMENTAL ARITHMETIC.
As all problems or questions in measurement, &c. are
solved or answered arithmetically by the pen, so are they,
instrumentally taken by compasses, from certain lines, &c.
or rules made for that purpose, for the help of those that
are deficient in arithmetic, or for a quicker dispatch of bu
siness; and such performances are called Instrumental
Arithmetic; and of these instruments, the most in use are
the three following: 1. The carpenter's plain rule: 3. Gun
ter's line: 3, Coggeshall's sliding rule. -
Description and Use of the Carpenter's Plain Rule.
This rule is made use of in measuring boards and timber,
being two feet in length, and divided into twenty-four parts
or inches, and every one of those parts or inches subdivided
into half inches, and each of these halves into quarters, and
each quarter into two parts; so that every inch is divided
into eight parts, and the whole length into 192 parts.
As this rule is well known, it is not necessary to represent
it; but, however, for the better understanding it, I shalf
give one thus :

By this table it will be easily understood that a board of

and a piece of 3 inches broad will require 4 feet in length
to make a foot square, &c.
At the other end of the rule is a table called Under
Timber Measure; and described thus:

So that if a piece of timber be 6 inches square, 4 feet in

It is a common method with carpenters to add the
breadth and thickness of a piece of timber in inches toge
ther, and call the half thereof the side of the square ofthat
piece; but this method gives the contents more than it is ; ,
and the greater the difference the larger the error. But the
true square may be found in Gunter's Line, thus: place one
point of the compasses upon the line, at the thickness, and
the other at the breadth; then half of that extent wiłł reach,
from either the breadth or thickness, to the side of the true
square in inches.

3. Description of Coggershall's Sliding-Rule.
This rule is framed 3 ways; sliding by one another as the
... glazier's rule; sliding on one side of a two-feet joint-rule;
and one part sliding on the other, in a foot of length; the
back part being flat, on which are sundry lines and scales.
Upon the aforesaid sliding side of the rule are four lines
of numbers, three are double lines, and one a single line of
numbers, marked with A B C and D, the three marked 4
B and C are called double lines of numbers, and figured 1,
:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Then 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 10,
at the end. That marked D is the single line of numbers,
and figured 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, and at the end 40,
even with and under 10, in the double line next to it; and
that is called the Girt-line, and so marked in the figure.
The figures on the three double lines of numbers may be
increased or decreased at pleasure; thus 1 at the beginning
may be called 10, 100, or 1000; and 2 is 20, 200, or 2000;
so that when 1 at the beginning is 10, then 1 in the middle
is 100, and 10 at the end is 1000; but if 1 at the begin
ning is accounted for 1, then 1 in the middle is 10, and
10 at the end is 100.
And as the figures are altered, so must the strokes or
divisions between them be altered in their value, according
to the number of the parts they are divided into; as thus,
from 1 to 2, it is divided into 10 parts, and each tenth is
divided into 5 parts; and from 2 to 3 it is divided into 10
parts, and each tenth into 2 parts, and so on from 3 to 5;
then from 5 to 6 it is divided into 10 parts only; and so on
unto 1 in the middle ofthe rule, or the end of the first part
of the double line of numbers. The second part of the
double line is divided like the first.

The Girt-line marked D is divided from 4 to 5 into 10

the end, which is right against 10 at the end of the double

The lines on the back-side of this rule that slide on one

of GEOGRAPHY.
Geog RAPHY is the art of describing the surface of the
earth, the constituent parts of which are land and sea.
Many arguments may be produced to prove that the
earth and seas are of a spherical or globular figure; one of
them may be sufficient in this place, viz. that ships in sail
ing from high capes or head-lands, lose sight of the lower
parts first ; and continue gradually also to lose sight of
those which are situate higher and higher, till at last the
top disappears, which could not be unless the surface of the
sea were convex; now this convexity of the sea is found to
be uniform in all parts thereof, therefore the surface of the
waters is spherical, which being granted, that of the land
must be nearly so, because its extremity sets limits to the
WaterS. -
The whole body of the earth and seas is therefore called
the Terraqueous Globe.
Since, as has been before observed, all circles are divided
- lintº
z
GEog RAPHY. 221
into 360 degrees, therefore any great circle surrounding
the terraqueous globe is usually so divided. Our ingenious
countryman, Mr. Richard Norwood, about the year 1635,
by an accurate measurement of the distance between Lon
don and Yerk, found that a degree of a great circle was
about 69% statute miles in length, and consequently that the
circumference of the terraqueous globe was 25,020 miles;
whence its diameter will be 7964 miles.
The sea covers the greater part of the terraqueous globe,
out of which the land rises with very slow accents, the
height of the loftiest mountains being Chimboraco in South
America, and this is not quite four miles perpendicular
above the surface of the sea.
Geographers have found it necessary to imagine certain
circles to be drawn on the surface of the carth, for the
better determination of the positions of places thereon.
These are either greater or lesser circles; great circles
divide the globe into two equal parts, the lesser circles
divide it into two unequal parts. -
There are six kinds of great circles; two of them, viz.
the Equator, or Equinoctial, and the Ecliptic, are fixed ;
but the others, viz. the Meridians, the circles of Longitude,
the Horizons, and the Vertical circles, are variable, accord
ing to the part of the globe they are appropriated to.
- There are two points on the surface of the terraqueous
globe, called the Poles of the Earth, which are diametri
cally opposite to each other; the one is called the North,
and the other the South Pole. -
The Equator is that great circle which is equally distant
from both the above-mentioned poles, and is so called from
its dividing the terraqueous globe into two equal parts,
named from the poles which are situated in each, the nor
thern and southern hemispheres. It is also called the
Equinoctial, because when the sun enters it, the days and
nights are of equal length in all parts of the globe. Seamen.
commonly call this circle the Line.
Meridians or Circles of Terrestrial Longitude, are sup
posed to be drawn perpendicular to the equator, and to
pass through the poles: they are called Meridians, or Mid
day Circles, because when the sun comes to the meridian
of any place it is noon, or mid-day, at that place,
Hence every particular place on the surface of the ter
raqueous globe hath its proper meridian, and consequently
322 THE YouNg MAN's Best CoMPAN io N.
a traveller who doth not directly approach to, or recede
from one of the poles, is continually changing his meridian.
* With respect to the two circles above described, every
place upon the earth is said to have its particular latitude
and longitude. - -
The latitude of any place upon carth is its distance from
the equator, in a direct line towards one of the poles; and
since the meridians proceed in such a direct line, therefore
latitude is reckoned in degrees, and parts of degrees, on the
meridians of the place. ... “ -
* The longitude of any place upon the earth is the east or
west distance of the meridian of that place, from some fixed
meridian, at which longitude is supposed to begin. Now,
since all the meridians pass through the poles, they coin
cide" with one another at those points, and their greatest
distance from each other will be when they are farthest
from those points of coincidence, viz. at the equator; there
fore, longitude is reckoned in degrees, and parts of a de
gree, of the equator. -
* Geographers have differed very much in the meridian
from whence they have assumed the beginning of longitude;
the ancients chose the meridian of the Canaries, which they
called the Fortunate Islands: others have pitched upon the
Azores, or the West, rn Islands; but the most usual way
is now to reckon longitude from the capital of that coun
try in which an author writes, and accordingly the lon
gitude is reckoned in this work from the meridian of London.
Parallels of latitude are small circles drawn parallel to
the equator at any assigned distance therefrom ; therefore
every particular place on the surface of the terraqueous
globe hath its proper parallel of latitude.
There are four of these parallels of latitude that are par
ticularly remarkable, viz. the two tropics, and the two polar
circles; but for the better explanation of those properties it
will be necessary, first, to define the ecliptic. -
The Ecliptic is that great circle in which the sun seems
to perform its annual motion round the earth ; this circle
makes an angle with the equator of 23°29'; it intersects
it in two opposite points called the Equinoctial Points;
and those two points in the ecliptic, which are farther from
the equinoctial points, are called the Solstitial Points.
The tropic of cancer is a parallel of latitude 25°29' dis
tant from the equator in the northern hemisphere, passing
- ihrough
Geography. 223
through the northern solstitial point of the ecliptic, as be
fore described : And,
The tropic of Capricorn is a parallel of latitude, as far
distant in the southern hemisphere, passing through the
southern point.
The arctic polar circle is a parallel of latitude 23°29'
distant from the north pole; and the antarctic polar circle
is a parallel of latitude as far distant from the south pole.
The tropics and polar circles divide the globe into five
parts, called zones; that is to say, girdles or belts; one of
them is called the torrid; two temperate; and two frigid.
The torrid zone, so called from the great heat of the sun,
which passes directly over the heads of the inhabitants
twice in a year, is situated between the two tropics, and is
therefore about 47 degrees in breadth; the inhabitants are
called Amphiscians; that is, such as have their shadows
cast both ways, the sun being seen at noon sometimes to
the north, and at other times to the south of them.
The northern temperate zone is situated between the
tropic of Cancer, and the arctic polar circle; and the
southern temperate zone between the tropic of Capricorn,
and the antarctic polar circle; they are each ofthem about
43 degrees broad; the inhabitants are called Heteroscians,
that is, such as have their shadow but one way; for at noon
the shadows of the inhabitants of the northern temperate
zone are always cast northward; and those of the inhabi
tants of the southern, southward. -
The frigid zones contain all that space between the polar
circles and the poles themselves; the northern frigid zone
being surrounded by the arctic circle, and the southern by
the antarctic. The inhabitants are called Periscians, be
cause, when the sun is on the same side of the equator as
those inhabitants are, their shadows are, in the space of 24
hours, cast of all sides, or quite round them. The sun
does not set in the places within these zones during several
successive revolutions or days in the summer; and in the
winter he doth not rise for a like space of time. To the
inhabitants of the poles, if there be any, the sun is visible
for one half the year, and invisible for the other half.
If any place on the globe, except the poles and equator,
be particularly considered, there will be three other places
on the same meridian which have more immediately a re
lation thereto, viz. 1. That place which has the same lati
L 4 tude
224. The Young MAN's Best Compasion. .
tude on the other side of the equator. The inhabitants of
this place are called Antiscii. They have mid-day and
mid-night at the same time with those of the place assum
ed; but the seasons of the year are different, the summer
of the one being the winter of the other.
2. That place which is on the same parallel of latitude,
but is 180 degrees different in longitude. The inhabitants
of this place are called Perisici. They have summer and
winter at the same times with those of the place assumed ;
but the times of the day are different, the mid-day of the
one being the mid-night ..A. other. -
3. That place, which has the same latitude, on the other
side of the equator, and is 180 degrees different in longi
tude. This place is diametrically opposite to the place
assumed; its inhabitants are called Antipodes, and their
seasons of the year, as well as times of the day, are totally
ºpposite.
The horizon is that great circle which divides the upper
or visible hemisphere of the world, from the lower or invi
sible, the eye of the spectator being always in the eentre of
the horizon. Hence every particular place on the terra
queous globe hath a different horizon; and consequently a
traveller, proceeding in any direction, is continually chang
ing his horizon. -
The circle is, by mariners, divided into four quarters,
containing 90 degrees: the four points quartering this circle
are called cardinal points, and are named East, West,
North, and South: the east and west are those points on
which the sun rises and sets when it is in the equinoctial ;
and the north and south points are those which coincide
with the meridian of the place, and are directed toward
the north and south poles of the world.
Each quarter of the horizon is further divided into eight
points, which are very necessary to the geographer for dis
tinguishing the limits of countries: but the use of those
divisions is much more considerable when applied to the
mariner's compass. -
Before the invention of this excellent and most use
ful instrument, it was usual, in long voyages, to sail by, or
keep along the coast, or at least to have it in sight; as is
manifest and plainly evident by the voyages of St. Paul,
Aets xx. 13, and xxviii. 2, which made their voyages long,
and very dangerºus, by being so near the shore. But *::

by the help of a needle, touched by the magnet or load
stone, which, by a wonderful and hidden quality, inclines
its point always northerly, the mariner is directed in his
proper course of sailing through the vast ocean, and unfar
thomable depths, to his intended port; and, if the wind is
favourable, can sail more than 333 leagues, or 1000 miles,
in a week, through the darkest weather, or darkest nights,
when neither land moon, nor stars are to be seen, which
before were the only guides, and if not seen, the mariners
were at a great loss, and exposed to the most imminent
danger.
The following figure is a representation of the said Com
pass, with the cardinal and other points :

The terraqueous globe, or globe of the earth and water,
is divided by nature into continents, islands, peninsulas,
isthmusses, mountains, promontories or capes, hills, and
vallies, oceans, seas, lakes, gulphs, or bays, streights, ports,
or harbours, and rivers, rocks, shelves, banks, marshes, and
bogs.
A continent, called sometimes the main-land, is a large
tract of land, containing several contiguous countries, em
pires, kingdoms, or states. -
An island is a piece of land wholly surrounded by the
ocean, sea, or other water, and so divided from the conti
nent. - -
A peninsula is a piece of land encompassed by water, ex
cept on one side, where it is joined to the continent or other
land. -
An isthmus is a neck, or narrow piece ofland, that joins
a peninsula to the continent.
A mountain is a part of the earth which is considerably
higher, or more elevated, than other lands near it.
A promontory is a mountain running out into the sea,
the extremity of which is called a cape or headland.
A hill is a smaller kind of mountain; and a valley is
that land which is situate at the bottom of a mountain or
hill, or between two or more hills or mountains. -
The ocean is a vast body of salt water, which separates
some of the continents, and washes their borders or shores.
A sea is a branch of the ocean flowing between some
parts of the continents, or separating islands from them. ...
A lake is a body of water every where surrounded by the
land. • -

A gulph, or bay, is a part of the ocean or sea contained
between two shores, and is encompassed by the land, except
on one side, where it communicates with the other waters.
A strait is a narrow passage whereby seas, gulphs, and
bays, communicate with the ocean, or with one another.
A port or harbour is a part of the ocean, or sea, so en
elosed by the land that ships may ride in safety.
A river is a running water, descending in a narrow chan
ñel from the mountains, or high lands, and emptying itself
into some ocean, sea, lake, or other river.
Rocks are immense stony masses; shelves and banks are
eminences consisting of stones, sand, or other matter, which
obstructs the passages of ships at sea, and often prove fatal
to those who do not keep clear of them.
Marshes are lands lying low, and liable to be overflowed
by the sea or rivers; and bogs are mixtures of earth and
water, over or through which it is dangerous to attempt a
passage. ,
The known parts of the earth are commonly divided into
four parts, viz. Europe, Asia, Africa, and America; the
first three were known to the ancients, and are for that
reason called the Old World; the fourth was discovered
something more than 300 years since, and therefore called
the New World.
The lands which lie towards the north and south poles
are very little known; that towards the north pole is called
Terra Arctica, and that towards the south pole Terra An
tarctica, or Terra Australis Incognita; the latter is sup
posed by some to be nearly as big as Europe, Asia, and
Africa.
The ocean assumes different names in different parts of
the earth; and the seas, gulphs, and bays are named most
ly from the lands to which they adjoin; it is thought,
therefore, most convenient in this short sketch to describe
the land and waters together; and first -
Of Europe, with the Adjacent Waters.
Europe is bounded on the north by the northern or frozen
ocean; on the west by the north Atlantic or western ocean,
which separates it from America; on the south by the Me
diterranean sea, separating it from Africa; and on the east
by Asia, to which it joins, without any visible limit, to
wards
GeogaApiry. 229
:
wards the northern parts, but on the southern it is sepa
rated by various rivers, seas, &c. -
The length of Europe, from Cape St. Vincent to the
Uralian Mountains, is about 3,300 miles, and the breadth
from Cape North in Lapland, to Cape Matapan in Greece,
may be about 2,350 miles.
Europe contains the following empires, kingdoms, re
gions, or states, viz. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Turkey,
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Po
land, Denmark, Sweden, and the Russian Empire.
. Of Spain and Portugal.
Spain and Portugal are surrounded by the sea on three
sides; on the south and south-east by the Mediterranean,
which communicates with the western or Atlantic ocean,
by the Straits of Gibraltar; on the west by the said ocean;
and on the north by the same or a part thereof, called the
Bay of Biscay; on the north-east by the Pyrenean moun
tains, which, reaching from the Mediterranean to the Bay
of Biscay, separate it from France.
Portugal is now a kingdom separate from Spain, to
which it was formerly subject. It is situate on the ocean,
which washes it on the westand south; it is hardly 300 miles
in length from north to south, and about 100 in breadth. The
capital city is Lisbon, which was, till lately, in a ruinous
condition, having been almost totally destroyed by an earth
quake, and a fire which succeeded it in November 1755.-
The city of Oporto is also a place of great trade, particular
ly famous for its wine.
Most of the provinces of Spain were all formerly separate
kingdoms; such were Andalusia, in which Gibraltar is si
tuated, as are the cities of Seville and Cadiz; Granada
within the Straits, the principal city has the same name, and
on the Mediterranean are situated the ports of Malaga and
Almeria; Murcia, more eastward in the Mediterranean, in
which, besides a city of the same name, is the city and port
of Carthagena: Valencia, north-eastward of Murcia : this
has a city and sea-port of the same name, and another port
of great trade, called Alicant.
Spain is divided into fourteen districts, viz.
Asturia, Leon, Valencia, Murcia,
Biscay, Old Castile, New Castile, and
Navarre Arragon, Estramadura, Granada.
Galicia, Catalonia, Andalusia,
Its
230 The Young MAN's Best Companios.
Its chief towns are Madrid, the capital, Barcelona, Se
ville, Corunna, and Cadiz, sometimes called Cales.
The principal rivers are the Ebro, the Tagus, and the
Douro, all of which have their rise in Spain.
On a promontory, in the south of Spain, stands Gibral
tar, which has been in the possession of the English for a
century, and is so defended by nature and art as to be con
sidered impregnable. Not far from Spain are the Balearic
Isles, called Majorca, Minorca, and Yvica.
Proceeding eastward along the Mediterranean sea is the
kingdom of France, which is bounded on the east by Italy,
Switzerland, and Germany, on the north by the English
Channel, on the west by the Bay of liscay, and on the
south by the Pyrenees, which separate it from Spain, and a
part of the Mediterranean sea. . .

Paris, the capital of France, is, next to London, the
largest and most considerable city in Europe. It contains,
at this time, immense collections of works of art, ancient
and modern. The other principal towns of France are
Lyons, Marseilles, Bourdeaux, and Lisle. , -
The principal mountains in France are the Alps, which
anciently divided it from Italy, and the Pyrenees, which
divide it from Spain. -
The principal rivers are the Rhone, the Garonne, the
Loire, the Seine, and the Somme. The Rhine forms the
boundary between France and Germany. -
The canals in France are very numerous; the chief work
of this kind is the canal of Languedoc, about one hundred
and eighty miles in length.

Near Toulon are the isles of Hyeres, which are the same
as Homer's Isle of Calypso. On the western coast is the
Isle of Oleron. The Isle of Rheis opposite Rochelle. Bel
lisle has been repeatedly attacked by the English. The
Isle of Ushant is the most westerly head-land in France.
Italy is divided from France on the west by part of the
§§ from Germany on the north, by the same mountains
called the Alps, and is every where else surrounded by the
Mediterranean Sea, and the Gulph of Venice, which is a
branch thereof. -
it is divided into the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of
Etruria, the Roman States, and the kingdom of Naples.
The Appenines forin a grand chain of mountains, which
runs through almost the whole extent of Italy. Mount
Vesuvius, near Naples, is a celebrated volcanic mountain.
But Vesuvius, compared with Etna in Sicily, is only a small
hill; the circuit of Vesuvius is thirty miles, that of Etna is
one hundred and eighty. The ashes of Vesuvius are some
times thrown seven miles, but those of Etna are frequently
thrown thirty.
Rome was the principal city of the Pope's dominions,
and the capital of Italy. Florence is the capital of Etru
ria, and is now regarded as the Athens of modern Italy.—
Milan is the capital of the Italian States.
Sicily, the largest of the Italian islands, is separated from
the south-west part of Naples by the Strait of Messina.-
This strait was famous for the Scylla and Charybdis of the
ancients, the former being a rock, the latter a whirlpool,
both very dangerous to the navigators of that period. The
chief towns are Palermo, Messina, and Syracuse. The so
vereign was sometimes styled King of Naples, and sometimes
the King of the Two Sicilies. Sardinia, another large
island, is situated almost in the centre of the Mediterra
mean: the principal town is Cagliari. Corsica is separated
from the northern parts of Sardinia by the Strait of Bonifa
cio; its chief town is Bastia. The island of Malta lies
about sixty miles south of the island of Sicily, and is celc
brated for the strength of its fortifications, and is now pos
sessed by the English.
Candia, to the south of Greece, is famous for Mount
Ida; and both Malta and Candia are renowned for with
standing sieges by the Turks, who in the former lost thirty

Rhodes, N. E. of Candia, is famous for its collossal sta
tue, between the legs of which ships sailed into the harbour.
In its right hand was a light-house for the direction of mu
riners. It was destroyed by an earthquake. -
The principal rivers are the Po, the Tiber, the War, and
the Adige.
Germany was formerly divided into 9 great divisions,
called eircles; 3 northern, Westphalia, Lower Saxony, and
Upper Saxony: 3 in the middle, Lower Rhine, Upper -
Rhine, and Franconia; and 3 southern, Suabia, Bava
ria, and Austria. These circles were subdivided into prin
cipalities, duchies, electorates, bishoprics, &c. Besides
these, there were a number of free cities, which were Sove
reign States, some of them styled Imperial Towns, and
quartered the Imperial Eagle in their arms.
The Emperor was elected by ten electors for life, under
the title of Emperor ofGermany and King of the Romans.
The present Emperor is also, in his own right, Archduke of
Austria, and King of Bohemia. The ten electors were
the King or Elector of Bohemia; the Elector of Bava

Elector Arch-Chancellor of the Empire, whose residence
was Ratisbon; the Elector of Saltzburgh ; the Elector of
*; the Elector of Wurtemburgh; aud the Elector of
168Se.
The Electors of Saxony and Hanover were regarded as
the principal potentates in the north of Germany; the Elec
tor of Bavaria, and the Elector of Wurtemberg in the south.
Prussia and Austria were considered as independent powers.
Almost every prince in Germany, of which there were about
200, was arbitrary in the government of his own estate; but
together they formed a great confederacy, governed by po
litical laws. The head of those petty sovereigns was the
Emperor. -
The chief towns are Vienna, the residence of the present
Emperor: Dresden, the residence of the Elector of Sax

Rhine, the Main, and the Elbe.
The Austrian Dominions.
The Austrian dominions comprehended Austria, Bohe
mia, Hungary, part of Poland, with the Venetian States.—
By the partition of Poland Austria acquired one sixth part
of that country, and ſour millions of subjects.
The capital of this Empire is Vienna, where the Empe
ror is regarded as the successor toAugustus; in the other pro
vinces he is looked upon as the nominal King of Hungary
and Bohemia. The other chief towns are Venice, Prague,
Presburg, Buda, Cracow, and Trieste:
The principal mountains are the Tyrolese, the Alps, and
the Carpathian Mountains.
There were in Germany several free cities, which were
small commonwealths under the protection of the Germanic
Body, such as Ratisbon, Frankfort, Hamburgh, &c. And
among the Alps were several small commonwealths, com
monly known by the namo of the Swiss Cantons.
Switzerland, remarkable for its mountains, is divided into
thirteen cantons, Zurich, Berne, Underwalden, Zug,
Schweitz, Basil, Glacis, Soleure, Uri, Appenzel, Lucerne,
Fribourg, and Schaffhausen. The three principal towns
are Basil, Berne, and Zurich.
The sources of the Rhine and the Rhone, two of the
grandest rivers in Europe, are to be found in the mountains
of Switzerland. The lakes of Constance and Geneva have
been long celebrated for their beauty. The Alps, which
divide Switzerland from Italy; the Mountains of St. Go
thard, in the Canton of Uri; and Mont Blanc, on the bor
ders of Savoy, are the highest in Europe.
Denmark and Norway, two kingdoms under the same
sovereign, are bounded on the north and west by the ocean,

east, and the ocean on the north.
This vast empire comprehends in fact all the northern
parts of Europe and Asia, but only a small part of its inha.
bitants are in a state of civilization. By the partition of
Poland, Russia has acquired two thirds of that country, and
six millions of inhabitants.
The principal towns are Petersburgh, the capital, Mos

stantinople, in the eastern part thereof, being the residence
of the Grand Seignior, sovereign of the empire.
The northern provinces are Moldavia, Bessarabia, Wal
lachia, Servia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia; those in the middle
are Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Albania, and Epirus;
the southern parts, called Greece, contain Thessaly, Åchaia,
and the Morea. The famous city of Delphos was in the
district of Achaia, but it is now reduced to a mean village,
called Castri. - -
The metropolis of Turkey, Constantinople, is finely situ
ated between the sea of Marmora and the Black Sea.—
Adrianople is the second city in the Turkish Empire.
The principal rivers are the Danube, the Saave, and the

We shal) give a brief account of some of the principal
cities and towns in England, without any particular regaid
to the order of arrangement.
LoN Don, the metropolis of England, is perhaps the most
populous and richest city on the face of the earth. Includ
ing Westminster and Southwark, it may perhaps be deemed
three cities. London
23s The YouNG MAN's BEST CoMPANION.
London, taken in this extent, presents almost every va.
riety which diversifies human existence. Towards the east
it is a sea port, replete with mariners, and with trades con
nected with that profession. In the centre it is the seat of
numerous manufactures, and prodigious commerce, while
the western or fashionable extremity present royal and
noble splendour, amidst scenes of luxury and dissipation.
This city is supplied with water by the Thames, the water
of which is thrown into the houses by machinery erected at
London-Bridge, and by the New River, which flows from
Ware, in Hertfordshire. The highest parts of London to
wards Mary-le-bone have their water, from a number of
large ponds situated on Hampstead Heath. -
York is thenext city to the capital in dignity, though not
in extent, or in opulence ; it is regarded as the metropolis
of the north of England. The cathedral of this city is
greatly celebrated: the western front being peculiarly rich,
the chief spire very lofty, and windows of the finest painted
lass. -
g LiveRPool, approaches now the nearest to London in
wealth and commerce. It is only about a century since
this immense town was a mere village. In 1699 it was con
stituted a parish, in 1710 a dock was constructed, and the
chief merchants came originally from Ireland. The infa
mous traffic in slaves was a distinguishing feature of Liver
pool, and it was there that from 100 to 150 ships were con
stantly employed in that trade. In a single year, during
the American war, Liverpool fitted out 170 privateers.
BRistol is still a large and flourishing city, though much
of its commerce with the West Indies and America have
passed to Liverpool. Bristol is famous for its hot wells.-
In the adjacent rocks are found beautiful crystals, called
Bristol stones. The trade of Bristol is chiefly with Ireland,
the West Indies, or North America, Hamburgh, and the
Baltic. By the navigation of the two rivers Severn and the
Wye, Bristol engrasses most of the trade of Wales. In
1787, Bristol employed 1600 coasting vessels, and upwards
of 400 ships engaged in foreign commerce.
MANchester is celebrated for its cotton manufacturers,
which are known and prized in every part of Europe.
BIRMINGHAM was originally a village, but is now a town
of immense manufactures in iron ware. The extension of
Birmingham, originated in a great degree from Mr. John
- - - - i. Taylor,
:

Grog RAPHY. 239
Taylor, who introduced the manufacture of gilt buttons,
and japanned and enamelled works. The great fabric of
the arts, called Soho, belonging to Messrs Boulton and
Watts, is situated about two miles from Birmingham.
SHEFFIELD is famous for its cutlery and plated goods.
LEEDs, BRADF1ELD, HA LIFAx, and WAKEF FLD, are the
chief centres of the manufactories ofwoollen cloth, and stuffs.
Leeds is the principal mart for broad cloths. The cloth
hall appropriated to the sale is a vast edifice, and the whole
business is transacted within the space of an hour on the
market-days. -
HU Ll is celebrated for its large dock; and its trade with
America and the south of Europe is very important. The
coasting traffic is extensive in coals, corn, wool, and various
manufactures.
Newcastle, so named from a fortress, erected by Ed
ward I. is a large and very populous town, in the centre of
the grand coal-mines in the counties of Durham and Nor
thumberland, which have for many centuries supplied Lon
don, and most of the east and south of England with that
species of fuel. - -
In the west of England, Ereter, the capital of Devonshire,
is an ancient and respectable city, the principal commerce
of which is in coarse woollen goods, manufactured in So
mersetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall. They are export
ed to Italy and other parts of the Continent to a very great
amount, and the East India Company purchase yearly a
very large quantity. Some ships from Exeter are engaged
in the cod and whale fishery.
SALISBURY is famous for its flannels and cutlery, particu
larly for the manufacture of scissars. Wilton is celebrated
for its carpets. -
WINchestER, the chief city of Hampshire, was for cen
turies the metropolis of England; it still retains many ves
tiges of ancient ſame and splendor. Besides a cathedral,
Winchester has a college founded by William of Wickham,
which has sent forth many illustrious characters.
PortsMouth, in the same county, is the grand naval
arsenal of lºngland. The harbour is noble and capacious,
narrow at the entrance, but spreading into an inland bay,
five miles in length, and from two to four in breadth.

NoRwich, the capital of Norfolk, from its size and con
sequence, is justly styled a city. It is a place of great
trade, particularly in camblets, crapes, stuffs, and other
woollen manufactures. The wool is chiefly from the coun
ties of Lincoln, Leicester, and Northampton, and the prin
cipal exports are to Holland, Germany, and the Mediterra

In St. George's Channel, almost equally distant from
England, Scotland, and Ireland, is situated the Isle of Man,
the royalty of which, under the kings of Great Britain, was
formerly in the family of the Stanleys, Earls of Derby; but
the male issue ofthat family being extinct, it was enjoyed
by the Duke of Athol, descended from the Derby family by

it was annexed to the Crown.
The Britannic Isles above described are separated from
France, on the south by the English channel; and from
Holland, Germany, Denmark, and Norway, by the German
ocean on the east; the northern and western sides being
washed by oceans of the same name.

The Hague is the largest, and was the richest village in
the would ; it is thirty miles from Amsterdam ; and was,
before the Revolution, the seat of Government, and the re
sidence of the principal people.
Amsterdam, the capital, is curiously built upon wooden
piles. Leyden is famous for its university. The streets
have canals running through them, the borders of which are
planted with rows of trees. The principal rivers are the
Rhine, the Macse, and the Scheklt. The canals are very
numerous, and serve for the same purpose as roads in other
countrics.
ASIA.
Asia is separated from Europe towards the north-west;
towards the south-west by the eastern part of the Mediter
ranean sea; and by the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea,
which divide it from Africa. It is bounded on the south by
the Indian ocean; on the east by the pacific; and on the
north by the northern or frozen ocean; its dimensions may
be conceived from what follows. - -
It seems most regular to divide this large country accord
ing to its present possessors, the Grand Seignor or Emperor
of the Turks, the King of Persia, the Great Mogul, and the
other potentates of India, the Emperor of China, and the
potentates of Tartary. - - .
The Turkish possessions in Asia are Anatolia, Syria,
Arabia, Armenia, or Turcomania, Georgia, andMesopota
nia, or Diarbeck: of which in their order.
Anatolia, formerly called Asia-Minor, is encompassed
cn the north, west, and south sides, by the Euxine, the
Mormorian, the Archipelago, and the Mediterranean seas;
it is separated from Syria on the south-east by the moun
tains called Taurus, and from Turcomania on the east by
the river Euphrates.
Syria, called by the Turks Suristan, is subdivided into
Syria proper, Phoenicia, and Palestine or judea ; whose
chief cities are Aleppo, Damascus, and Jerusalem.
Arabia (a country which preserves its ancient name, as
do the inhabitants their roaming disposition) is bounded on
the west by the Red Sea and the Isthmus of Suez; on the
north by Palestine, Syria, and Diarbeck; on the east by

the Persian Gulph, and on the south-west by the Arabian
sea, and part of the Indian ocean.
It is divided into three parts, called the Desert, the Stony,
and the Happy; the two first lie to the northward, the other
to the south.
There are very few towns in the desert or stony parts of
this country; the Arabs living in tents, and removing with
their families from place to place, as profit or convenience
suggest. But in Arabia the Happy, (one of the finest coun
tries in the world) there are several of note, such as Medina,
where the sepulchre of Mahomet, the founder of the Turk
ish religion, is; Mecca, his birth-place, to which every
Turk or Mussulman is obliged by his religion to come in
pilgrimage once in his life-time, or to send another in his
stead; Aden, a place of traffic; and Mocha, famous for its
coffee.
Armenia, or Turcomania, is bounded on the west by Ana
tolia, on the south by Diarbeck, on the east and north by
Georgia and the Euxine sea.
Georgia, formerly called Iberia, including Mingreli and
Gurgistan, is bounded on the north by part of Russia, on
the west by the Euxine sea, on the south by Turcomania,
and part of Persia, and on the east by part of Persia; the
cities of the greatest note are Fasso and Tafflis.
Mesopotamia, or Diarbeck, is bounded on the north by
Turcomania, on the west by Syria, on the south by Arabia
the Desert, and on the cast by Persia; its principal cities
are Diarbeker and Bagdat.
Besides these large possessions on the Continent of Asia,
the Turks hold several islands in the Archipelago; with
Rhodes and Cyprus in the Mediterranean sea, the last of
which is very considerable.
The next division of Asia, proceeding eastwardly, is Per
sia, which has the Turkish dominions on the west, the Per
sian Gulph and part of the Indian ocean on the south; the
empire of the Great Mogul on the east, and, on the north,
part of Tartary, the Capsian sea, and part of the Rus
sian empire. This is a very large country, but at present,
it is torn to pieces by different competitors for the sovereign,
power; the capital city is Ispahan; the most considerable
of the others are Derbent on the Capsian sea, and Gom
broom and Bassora on the Persian Gulph. -
Proceeding still eastward, the next empire is that º the
a ſcal
GeoGIRAPHY. 247
Great Mogul, which has Persia on the west, the two Indian
Peninsulas and the bay of Bengal on the south, China on
the east, and part of Tartary on the north.
This is another large tract, with the inland parts of which
the Europeans are not much acquainted.
The principal cities are Agra, Lahor, Delhi, Cabul, and
Cassimir; but whether Agra or Lahor is the capital, is diffi->
cult to determine; the Mogul hath a magnificent palace at
each of these cities.
The maritime parts of the continent of India are divided
by the bay of Bengal, a branch of the Indian ocean, into
two peninsulas, anciently called India Within, or on this
side the Ganges, and India. Without, or beyond the
Ganges; besides which two peninsulas, there are several
large islands belonging to India, of which in their order.
The peninsula on this side the Ganges contains several
distinct territories or kingdoms, most of which either are
or were subject, or at least tributary, to the Mogul; the
western side thereof is called the Coast of Malabar, the
eastern the Coast of Coromandel.
The coast of Malabar contains several European settle
ments, such as Bombay, an island belonging to the English
East India Company, and Goa, to the Portuguese, at each
of which they have the sovereignty; and the English trade
at least, if they have not forts, at Guzurat, Surat, Calicut,
and Cochin. -
Theisland of Ceylon, by some called Zeloan, is situated
a little to theeast ofCape Comorin, the most southern point
of this peninsula. -
The coast of Coromandel, which is washed by the bay of
Bengal, tends towards the north and north-east from Cape
Comorin, and extends to the mouth of the Ganges; the
Principal settlements of the English on this coast are, Ma
dras or Fort St. George, and Fort St. David, near which
the French had a settlement called Pondicherry; which
neighbouring settlements were for several years at war with
each other, with various success, the natives, headed by
by their Princes, called Nabobs, having taken part therein,
some on oneside, and some on the other; but the English
were at last victorious, and have lately had large provinces
yielded to them by the Princes of the country.
The peninsula on the other side of the Ganges, consists
of the large kingdoms of Bengal, having a capital of the

situate to the south, is almost encompassed by the sea, and
the city, so called, is situate near the southern extremity;
Cochin-China, whose chief city is Cambodia, and Tonquin,
whose capital is of the same name. .
South-west of Malacca is the island of Sumatra.
South-east of this liesthe island of Java, separated by the
straits of Sunda; the western point of which is called Java
Head by English mariners, it being often the first land made
by them after they have doubled the Cape of Good Hope;
the principal citics are Bantam and Batavia, the latter of
which till lately belonged to the Dutch East India Com
pany, who were sovereigns over the greatest part-of this
- Harge and fi uitful island. It now belongs to England.
Eastward from Malacca and Sumatra is the island of
Borneo, almost round, and near 600 miles in diameter.
The island of Celebes is to the east of Porneo, but much .
less than it, . Proceeding eastward are the Molucca, or
Spice Islands; the Dutch having made themselves masters
of the e, thereby engrossing the spice trade to themselves.
The Phillippine Isles are very numerous, some authors
have reckoned 10,000 of them; the most considerable is
Luconia, whose capital is Manilla. -
To the north and north-west of these is situated the po
tent Empire of China, reckoned by some to be as big as all
Europe; it hath the Pacific ocean on the east and south
east; Cochin-China and Tonquin on the south-west; the
Mogul's empire on the wet, and on the north-west and north
a part of Tartary.
There are a great number of cities in this empire, of
which Pekin, situated in the northern part of the country,
is the capital; the European trade to this country is chiefly
carried on at Canton, a great seaport in one of the southern
provinces. - --
The most considerable Chinese Islands are those which
compose the empire of Japan; which consists of several
large islands, the largest of these is Niphon: and the chief
towns are Jeddo, Miaco, and Nagasaki.
Thus we have taken a cursory survey of all the southern
parts of Asia; the northern hath only one general name,

is subject to divers Potentates, of whom little is known.
AFRICA.
AFR1cA is a large peninsula, which is joined to the con
tinent of Asia by the Isthmus of Suez, a narrow desert be
tween the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The inland parts
of this Continent are not much known to the Europeans;
so that only the sea coasts will be mentioned here, begin
ning at the Isthmus of Sucz, and coasting first along the
Mediterranean sea.
Egypt is under the dominion of the Turks; its present
capital is called Cairo; the piratical States of Tripoly,
Tunis, and Algiers, have capitals of the same name, and the
capital of the empire of Morocco is the city of Fez.
Along the coasts of the Atlantic ocean, there are no ex
tensive dominions, the inhabitants being mostly subject to
petty Princes of their own, who being almost continuaily
at war with one another, sell their prisoners for slaves; the
European nations have been induced, for the protection of
their trade therein, and other commodities, to erect several
small forts in different places, to enumerate which would be
tedious; the Madeiras, the Canaries, and the Cape Verd
Islands, are the most considerable on this coast; the only
one possessed by the English is a very small one, called St.
Helena, frequented by the East India ships.
At the southern extremity of the Continent is situated the
Cape of Good Hope, where there is a tolerable town for the
convenience of shipping, built by the Dutch East India
Company: from hence, along the eastern coast, both on the
ocean and in the Red Sea, very little remarkable offers itself
to notice. At some distance, however, from the part of this
coast is situated one of the largest in the world, called Ma
dagascar, which has been at different times the asylum of
European pirates. r

known to the inhabitants of Furope, Asia and Africa, is
divided into two remarkable divisions, called North and
South America, which are joined together by the Isthmus
of Darien or Panama. -
North America includes the United States, Spanish and
British America, and the independent Indian nations.
The inland seas of North America are the Gulphs of
Mexico, Californio, and St. Lawrence, with Hudson's Bay,
and Davis's Straits. The Gulph of St. Lawrence is closed
by the island of Newfoundland, and the great sand-bank,
#.four hundred miles in length, celebrated for the cod
shery.
#. lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Winnipeg, and
Slave Lake, are the grandest in the world, and may with
propriety be denominated seas. The rivers are also grand
features of North America. Of these, the principal are
the Missouri, or Mississippi, the Ohio, and the St. Law
rence; and the most celebrated mountains are the Apala
chians, passing through the territory of the United States.
Among these the Ohio has its rise.
The UNITED STATEs are divided into Northern, Middle,
and Southern.
. The northern States are Vermont, New Hampshire, Mas
sachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The middle
Statesare New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and the territory on the north west of the Ohio. The
southern States are Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, North
Carolina, Georgia, and the country south of Kentucky.
The chief cities and towns are Washington, the capital,
Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Charles
town.
The Spanish dominions were Louisiana (which have been
lately ceded to the United States for a certain sum of
money) East and West Florida, New Mexico, and Old
Mexico, or New Spain. Mexico is the capital of all Spa
nish America. The chief river in Spanish America is Rio
Bravo, and the capital lake is Nicaragua.
The British dominions are amazingly extensive, and in
clude Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia, New Bruns
wick, the island of Cape Breton, Newfoundland, the Ber
mudas, or Summer Islands. -
. The Native Tribes and Independent Countries.—These are
Greenland, Labrador, the regions around Hudson's Bay,

those nations lately discovered by Sir A. Mackenzie, and
those on the western coast.
Of the West Indies.—The most important of these islands
are Cuba, and Porto-Rico, Spanish; St. Domingo, and Ja
maica, English. North of St. Domingo and Cuba are the
Bahamas, the principal of which is Providence Island. The
Caribbee Islands extend from Tobago in the south to the
Virgin Islands in the north. Those belonging to England
are Barbadoes, Antigua, St. Christopher's, St. Vincent, Do.
minica, Grenada, Trinidad, Montserrat, Nevis, and the Vir
gin Isles, Guadaloupe, St. Lucie, and Tobago. The Danes
formerly possessed St. Croix, and St. Thomas. St. Bar
tholomew belongs to the Swedes, and Eustatia to the En
glish. - -
From these islands are procured sugar, rum, cotton, in
digo, spices, cocoa, and coffee; in time of war the smaller
and inferior islands are often changrig their masters. . .
South America comprehends Terra Firma, Guiana, Ama
zonia, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Chilli, and Patagoniº.
Amazonia and Patagonia are not under the yoke of any
European power; they are divided into several kingdoms,
cach of which has its chief. The inhabitants have no tem.
ples or priests, but worship images of their departed heroes.
South America has no inland sea, but the river Ama
zons, and that of La Plata, are celebrated as the largest in
the world. They both have their rise among the Andes.—
The mountains in South America are the loftiest on the
whole face of the globe, and are intermixed with volcanos
of the most sublime and terrific description. The Andes
follow the windings of the coast, and extend four thousand
six hundred miles. The highest are near the Equator, and
are covered with perpetual snow. The Spanish dominions
in South America are Buenos Ayres, Peru, Chilli, and New
Granada. Peru and Chilli are famous for their gold and
silver mines. In Chili it never rains, the sky is seldom
cloudy, but the night dews supply the want of rain.
The Portuguese territory of Brazil is perhaps equal in
extent to the Spanish, compensating by its breadth for its
deficiency in length. Guiana belongs partly to the French:
and partly to the Dutch. Cayenne consists of an extensive
territory on the Continent, and of an island of that name.
The southern extremity of South America is Patagonia,
a desolate country, inhabited by a savage race, some of
M whom

whom are of a colossal nature. The islands contiguous to .
South America are Trinidad, the Falkland Islands, Terra.
del Fuego, Chiloe, and Juan Fernandez. The Gallipago
Islands are near the Equator, and the Pearl lslands lie in
the Bay of Panama.
ASTRONOMY."
Ast RonoMY is a Science which treats of the motions
and distances of the heavenly bodies, and of the appear
ances arising from them. -
There have been a great variety of opinions, among
philosophers, concerning the disposition of the great bodies
of the universe, or of the positions of the bodies which
appear in the Heavens: but the notion now embraced by
the most judicious astronomers is, that the Universe is
composed of a vast number of Systems or worlds; that in
every system there are certain bodies moving in free space,
and revolving at different distances around a Sun, placed
in or near the centre of the system, and that these Suns, or
the other bodies, are the Stars which are seen in the
Heavens. -
That system, to which our Earth belongs, is by astro
nomers called the Solar System; and the opinion, which
supposes the Sun to be fixed, in or near the centre, with
several bodies revolving round him, at different distances,
is confirmed by all the observations hitherto made.
This opinion is called the Copernicum System ; from
Nicholas Copernicus, a Polish Philosopher, who, about
the year 1473, revived this nation from the oblivion it
had been buried in for many ages. -
The Sun is therefore placed in the midst of an immense
Space, wherein ten opaque spherical bodies revolve about
him as their centre. Seven of these wandering globes are
called the planets, who, at different distances, and in dif
ferent periods, perform their revolutions, from west to east,
in the following order.
Ast RoNoM Y. - - 253

and performs its course in about three months or 87d. 23h.

almost thirty years, that is 10759.l. Sh. in one Revolution
round the Sun. And the 3 Herschell Planet, whose year
is equal to almost eight-two of ours. The distances of the
planets from the Sun are nearly in the following proportion,
viz. supposing the distance of the Earth from the Sun to
be divided into 160 equal parts; that of Mercury will be
about 37 of those parts; of Venus 66; of Mars 155; ofJu
piter 493; of Saturn 903; and that of the Herschell 1813.
The Orbits + of the planets are not all in the same plane,
but variously inclined to one another; so that, supposing
the orbit of the earth to be the standard, the others will
have one half above, and the other half below it; inter
secting one another in a line passing through the Sun.
- Besides these seven large planets, three smaller bodies
have been discovered revolving about the Sun between the
Orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
. The plane of the Earth's Orbit is called the Ecliptic;
and this the Astronomers make the standard, to which the
planes ofthe other orbits arejudged to incline.
* The right line passing through the sun, and the common
intersection of the plane of the Orbit of any planet with the
ecliptic, is called the Line of the Nodes of that planet, and
the points themselves, wherein the orbits cut the ecliptic,
are called the nodes. . The orbits of the planets are not
circles, but ellipses or ovals.
What an Ellipsis is may be easily understood from the
following description: imagine two small pegs or pins fixed
upright on any plane, as a table, and suppose them tied
- - with
* The characters placed before the Namesof the Planets,
are, for brevity's sake commonly made use of by Astrono
mers instead of the words at l ngth, as ? for Venus, &c.
+ By the orbit of a Planet is understood the Track or
Ring described by its circuit round the Sun, but by the
plane of the Orbit, is meant a flat surface, extended every
way through the orbit infinitely.
254 THE YouNG MAN's Best CoMPAN16N.
with the ends of a thread, somewhat longer than their dis
tance from one another; now if a pin be placed in the
double of the thread and turned quite round (always stretch
ing the thread with the same force) the curve described by
the motion will be an Ellipsis. The two points where the
pegs stood, (about which the thread was turned) are called
the Foci of that ellipsis; and if without changing the length
of the thread, we alter the position of the pegs, we shall
then have an ellipsis of a different kind from the former :
and the nearer the Foci are together, the nearer will the
curve described be to the circle, until at last the two Foci
coincide, and then the pin in the doubling of the thread
will describe a perfect circle. -
The orbits of all the planets have the Sun in one of their
Foci, and half the distance between the two Foci is called
the eccentricity of the orbits. This eccentricity is different
in all the planets, but in the most of them it is in little
schemes or instruments made to represent the planetary
orbit, and need not here be noticed.
The ten planets before mentioned are called primaries, or
|. planets, but beside these there are 18 other lesser
*lanets, which are called Secondaries. Moons, or Satelli
tes. These moons always accompany their respective pri
maries, and perform their revolutions round them, whilst
both together are also carried round the Sun.
Of the Primary Planets there are but four, as far as
observation can assure us, that have these attendants, viz.
the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Herschel.
The Earth is attended by the Moon, who performs her.

diameters of the Earth from it; and once a year is carried
round the Sun along with the Earth.
Jupiter has four Moons or Satellites; the first or inner
most performs its Revolution in about one day and 18%
hours, at the distance of 5; Semidiameters of Jupiter from
his centre; the second revolves about Jupiter in 3 days and
18 hours, at the distance of 9 of his Semi-Diameters; the
third in 7 days and 3 hours, at the distance of 14; Semi
diameters; the fourth and outermost performs its course in
the space of 16 days 18 hours, and its distance from Jupiter's
centre is 25 of his Semi-diameters.
Saturn has no less than seven Satellites; the first or in
nermost revolves about him in 1 day and 21 hours, at the
distance
-
s
Ast Rono MY. 253
distance of 43 diameters of Saturn from his centre; the
second completes his period in 23 days, at the distance of
54 diameters; the third, in about 43 days, at the distance
of 8 diameters; the fourth performs his course in about 16
days, at the distance of 8 diameters: the fiſth takes 79;
days to finish his course, and is 54 diameters of Saturn dis
tant from his centre. The sixth performs his revolution in
1 Day ; and the seventh in little more than 22 heurs, these
two are nearest to the planet, but being discover, d last are
called the sixth and seventh instead of the first and second.
The Satellites, as well as the primaries, perform their Re
volution from West to East; the Planes of the Orbits of the
Satellites of the same Plane are variously inclined to one
another, and consequently are inclined to the Planes of the
Orbitsor their primary.
Besides these attendants, Saturn is encompassed with a
thin ring that does no where touch his body; the Diameter
of this ring is to the Diameter of Saturn, as 6 to 4; and the
void space between the ring and the body of Saturn is equal
to the breadth of the ring itself; so that in some situations
the Heavens may be seen between the ring and his body.
This surprising phenomenon of Saturn's ring is a modern
discovery; neither were the Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn
known to the Ancients; the former were first discovered by
the famous Italian Philosopher Gallied, by a Telescopc,
which he first invented; and the celebrated Cassini, the
French King's Astronomer, was the first that saw the five
Satellites of Saturn; which, by reason of their great dis
tances from the Sun, and the smallness of their own bodies,
cannot be seen by us, but by the help of very good glasses.
The six Sateliites of Herschel revolve about the Planct
in the following times: The first in 5 d. 21 h. the second in
16 d. 17 h. the third in 11 days, the fourth in 18 d. 11 h.
the fifth in 38 days; and the sixth in 107 d. 16 h.
The motion of the primary planets round the Sun, (as
also of the Satellites round their respective primaries) is
called their annual-motion; because they have a year, or
the alteration of the seasons, to complete in one of those
revolutions. Besides their annual motion, four o the
planets, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, are
known to revolve about their own Axis, from west to east :
and this is called their diurnal motion. For, by this rota
tion each point of their surface is carried successively

towards, and from the Sun, who always illuminates thc,
hemisphere which is next to him, the other remaining ob
scure : And, while any place is in the hemisphere illumi-.
nated by the Sun, it is day; but when it is carried to the
obscure hemisphere, it becomes night; and so continues
until, by this rotation, the said place is again enlightened
by the Sun. - - - -
The Earth performs its revolution round its Axis in 23
hours 59 minutes; Venus in 28 hours; Mars in about 24
hours and 58 minutes; and Jupiter moves round his own
Axis in 9 hours and 56 minutes.
The Sun is also found to turn round his Axis from west
to east in 25 days; and the Moon which is nearest to us of
all the planets, revolves about her Axis in a month, or in
the space of time that she turns round the earth; so that
the Lunarians have but one day throughout their year.
The planets are all opaque bodies, having no light but
what they borrow from the Sun; for that side of them
which is next towards the Sun has always been observed to
be illuminated in whatever position they be, but the oppo
site side, which the solar rays do not reach, remains dark
and obscure; whence it is evident that they have no light
but what proceeds from the Sun, for if they had, all parts
of them would be lucid, without any darkness or shadow.
The planets are likewise proved to be globular, because let
what part soever of them be turned towards the Sun, its
boundary, or the line separating that part from the opposite,
always appears to be circular; which could not happen if
they were notglobular. -
The Earth is placed betwixt the Orbs of Mars and Venus.
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Herschel,
all move round the Sun; both which may be proved from
observations, as follow :
1. Whenever Venus is in conjunction with the Sun, that
is, when she is in the same direction from the Earth, or to
wards the same part of the heavens the Sun is in, she either
appears with a bright and round face, like a full Moon, or
else disappears; or, if she is visible, she appears horned
like a new Moon; which Phenomenon could never happen,
if Venus did not turn round the Sun, and was not betwixt
her and the Earth ; for since all planets borrow their light
from the Sun, it is necessary that Venus's lucid face should
be towards the Sun; and when she appears fully illumina
ted,
.
Asi RoxoMr. - 857
ted, she shows the same face to the Sun and the earth;
whence, at that time, she must be beyond the Sun, for in
no other position could her illuminated face be wholly seen
fiom the Earth. Further, when she disappears, or, if
visible, appears horned; that face of hers, which is towards
the Sun is either wholly turned from the Earth, or only a
a small part of it can be seen by the Earth; and in this
case she must of necessity be betwixt us and the Sun. These
observations must be made with a telescope.
Besides the for going there is another argument to prove
that Venus moves round the Sun in an Orbit that is within
the Earth's ; because she is always observed to keep near
the Sun, and in the same quarter of the Heavens that he is
in, never receding from him more than about ; of a whole
circle; and therefore she can never come in opposition to
him, that is, the Earth never can be between the Sun and
Venus, which would necessarily happen, did she perform
her course round the Earth either in a longer or shorter
time than a year. - - -
And this is the reason why Venus is never to be seen near
midnight, but always either in the morning or evening, and
at most not above three or four hours before Sun-rising,
and after sun-setting from the time of Venus's superior con
junction, or when she is beyond the Sun, she is more
easterly than the Sun, and therefore sets later, and is seen
after Sun-setting: and then she is commonly called the
JEvening Star ; but from the time of her inferior conjunc
tion, till she comes again to the superior, she then appears
more westerly than the Sun, and is only to be seen in the
morning before Sun rising; and is then called the Morning
Star.
After the same manner we prove that Mercury turns round
the Sun, for he always keeps in the Sun's neighbourhood,
and never recedes from him so far as Venus does; and there
fore the Orbit of Mercury must be within that of Venus,
and on account of his nearness to the Sun he can seldom
be seen without a Telescope. -
Mars is observed to come in opposition, that is, the
Earth is sometimes between the Sun and Mars; he always
preserves a round, full, and bright face, except when he
is near his quarters, when he appears somewhat gibbous,
like the moon, three or four days before or after the full:
Therefore the Orbit of Mars must include the Earth within
it
258 THE You NG MAN's Best CoMPAN Iow.
it, and also the Sun ; for if he were betwixt the Sun and
us at the time of his inferior conjunction, he would either
quite disappear, or appear horned, as Venus and the Moon
do in that position. -
Mars, when he is in opposition to the Sun, appears to us
almost seven times larger in diameter than when he is in
conjunction with him ; and therefore must needs be almost
seven times nearer to us in one position than in the other.
For the apparent magnitudes of distant objects increase or
decrease in proportion to their distances from us: but
Mars keeps always nearly at the same distance from the
Sun, therefore it is plain it is not the Earth but the Sun that
is the centre of his motion.
It is proved, in the same way, that Jupiter, Saturn, and
the Herschel, have both the Sun and Earth within their
Orbits; and that the Sun, and not the Earth, is the center
of their motions; although the disproportion of the dis
tances from the Earth is not so great in Jupiter as in Mars,
nor so great in Saturn as it is in Jupiter, because they are
at a much greater distance from the Sun.
We have now shown that all the planets turn round the
Sun, and that Mercury and Venus are included between him
and the Earth, whence they are called the inferior planets,
and that the earth is placed between the Orbits of Mars
and Venus, and therefore included within the Orbits of
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Herschel Planet, whence
they are called the superior Planets. And since the Earth
is in the middle of these moveable bodies, and is of the
same nature with them, we may conclude, that she has
the same sort of motions:—but that she turns round the
Sun is proved thus: -
All the planets seen from the Earth, appear to move
very unequally; as sometimes to go faster, at other times
slower, and sometimes to be stationary, or not to move at
all; which could not happen if the Earth stood still”.
The annual periods of the planets round the Sun are de
termined by carefully observing the length of time from
their departure from a certain point of the heavens (or
from a fixed Star) until they arrive at the same again. lº.

*
these kinds of observations the ancients determined the pe
riodical revolutions of the planets round the Sun; and were
so ºxact in their computations as to be capable of predict
ing celipses of the Sun and Moon. But since the invention
of telescopes, astronomical observations are made with
greater accuracy, and consequently our tables are far more
perfectthan those of the ancients.
And, in order to be as exact as possible, Astronomers
compare observations made at a great distance of time from
one another, including several periods; by which means
the error that might be in the whole, is in each period sub
divided into such little parts, as to be very inconsiderable.
Thus the mean length of a solar year is known even to se
conds.
The diurnal rotation of the planets round their axis was
discovered by certain spots which appear on their surfaces.
These spots appear first on the margin of the planets'
disks, or the edge of their surfaces, and seem by degrees
to creep towards their middle; and so on, going still for
ward, till they come to the opposite side or edge of the
disk, where they set or disappear; and after theyhave been
hid for the same space of time that they were visible, they
again appear to rise in or near the same place as they did
at first, then to creep on progressively, taking the same
course as they did before. Spots of this kind have been ob
served on the surface of the Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn, by which means it has been found that these bodies
turn round their own axis in the times before mentioned.
It is very probable, that Mercury ard the Herschel have
likewise a motion round their axis, that all the parts of
their surface may alternately enjoy the light and heat of
the Sun, and receive such changes as are proper and con
venient for their nature; but by reason of the nearness of
Mercury to the Sun, and the immense distance of the
Herschel from him, no observation has hither to been made,
by which their spots (ifthey have any) could be discovered,
and therefore their diurnal motions have not been deter
mined. The diurnal motion of the earth is concluded to
exist from the apparent revolutions of the heavens, and of
all the Stars round it, in the space of a natural day. For
it is much easier to conceive that this comparatively small
Globe should turn round its own axis, once in 24 hours,
than that such a great number of much larger bodies, some.
of
260 THE YouNG MAN's Best CoMPAN10 N.
of them so immensely distant, should revolve round it in
So short a space of time. The solar spots do not always
remain the same, but sometimes old ones vanish, and af
terwards others succeed in their room; sometimes several
small ones gather together and make one large spot, and
sometimes a large spot is seen to be divided into many
small ones. But notwithstanding these changes, they all
turn round with the Sun in the same time.
Each planet is observed always to pass through the
constellations Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,
Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces,
and it also appears that every one has a track peculiar to
itself, by which the paths of the six planets form among
the Stars a kind of road, which is called the Zodiac; the
middle part whereof, called the ecliptic, is the orbit de
scribed by the earth, with which the orbits of the other,
planets are compared.
As the ecliptic runs through twelve constellations, it is
supposed to be divided into twelve equal parts, of30 degrees
each called Signs, having the same names with the twelve
constellations they run through.
The plane of the ecliptic is supposed to divide the ce
lestial sphere in two equal parts, called the northern and
southern hemispheres; and a body, situated in either of
these hemispheres, is said to have north or south latitude,
according to the hemisphere it is in; thus the latitude of a
celestial object is its distance from the ecliptic.
The planes of the other five orbits are observed to lie
partly in the northern and partly in the southern hemi
sphere; so that every one cuts the ecliptic in two oppo
site points, called nodes; one, called the ascending node, is
that through which the planet passes, when it moves out of .
the southern into the northern hemisphere; and the other
called the descending node, is that through which the
Planet must pass in going out of the northern into the
southern hemisphere. The right line joining the two nodes
of any planet is called the line of the nodes.
The names of most of the constellations were given by
the ancient astronomers, who reckoned that star in Aries,
now marked Yº (according to Bayer), to be the first point in
the ecliptic, this for being next the Sun when he entered
the vernal equinox; at that time each constellation was in
the sign by which it was called; but observations show,
- - that
ASTRONOMY. w 261
that the point marked in the heavens by the vernal equi
nox, has been constantly going backwards by a small
quantity every year; whereby the Stars appear to have ad
vanced as much forward, so that the constellation Aries is
now almost removed into the sign Taurus ; the said first
star in Aries being got almost 30 degrees forward from the
equinox; which difference is called the Procession of the
Equinor, whereof the yearly alteration is about 50 seconds
of a degree, or about 7.2 years. -
All the Planets have one common focus, in which the
Sun is placed; for as no other supposition can solve the
appearances that are observed in the motion of the Planets,
and as it also agrees with the strictest physical and mathe
matical reason; therefore it is now received as an elemen
tary principle. -
The line ofthe nodes of every Planet passes through the
Sun; for as the motion of every Planet is in a plane passing
through the sun, consequently the intersections of these
planes, that is, in the lines of the nodes, must also pass
through the Sun.
All the Planets in their revolutions are sometimes nearer,
sometimes farther from the Sun ; this is in consequence of
the Sun not being placed in the center of each orbit, the
orbits being ellipsis. -
The Aphelion, or superior Apsis, is that point of the
orbit which is farthest distant from the Sun, and the Pe
rihelon, or inferior Apsis, is that point which is nearest the
Sun; and the transverse diameter of the orbit, or the line
joining the two Apsis, is called the line of the Apsis.
The Plant ts move faster as they approach the Sun, or
come nearer to the perihelion, and slower as they recede
from the Sun, or come nearer the aphelion. This is not
only a consequence from the nature of the Planet's motions
about the Sun, but it is confirmed by all good obs, rvations.
If a right line be drawn from the Sun, through any
Planet (which line is called by some the Vector Radius),
and be supposed to revolve round the Sun with the Planet,
then this line will describe, or pass through, every part of
the plane of the orbit, so that the Vector Radius may be
said to describe the area of the orbit.
There are two chief laws observed in the Solar System,
which regulate the motions of all the Planets; namely,
I, The Planets describe equal areas in tdual times; that
1S,
262 THE You NG MAN's Best CoMPAN LoN.
is, in equal portions of time the Vector Radius describes
equal areas or portions of the space contained within the
Planet's orbit.
II. The squares of the periodical times of the Planets
are as the cubes of the mean distances from the Sun.
That is, as the square of the time which the Planet A
takes to revolve in its orbit, is to the square of the time
taken by any other Planet B, to run through its orbit, so is
the cube of the mean distance of A from the Sun, to the
cube of the mean distance of B from the Sun.
The mean distance of a Planet from the Sun is its dis
tance from him when the Planet is at either extremity of
the conjugate diameter, and is equal to half of the transverse
diamet, r.
The foregoing are the two famous laws of Kepler, a
great astronomer, who flourished in Germany about the be
ginning of the 17th century, and who deduced them from
a multitude of observations. But the first who demonstrat
ed these laws, was the incomparable Sir Isaac Newton.
By the second law, the relative distances of the Planets
from the Sun are known; and if the real distance of any
one be known, the absolute distances of all the others may
thereby be obtained.
Besides the Planets already mentioned, there are other
great bodies that sometimes visit our System, which are a
sort of temporary Planets; for they come and abide with
us for a while, and afterwards withdraw from us for a cer
tain space of time, which they again return. These wan
dering bodies are called Comets. -
The motions of the Comets in the heavens, according to
the best observations hitherto made, seem to be regulated
by the same immutable law with the Planets; for their
orbits are elliptical, like those of the Planets; but vastly
narrower or more eccentric. Their orbits have different
inclinations to the Earth's orbit; some inclining north
wardly, others southwardly, much more than any of the
planetary orbits do.
Although both the Comets and the Planets move in el
liptic orbits, yet their motions seem to be vastly different,
for the eccentricities of the Planets orbits are so small that
they differ but little from circles; but the eccentricities of
the Comets are so very great that the motions of some of
them seem to be almost in a right line, tending directly
towards
Ast RONoMY. 263
º
towards the Sun. Now, since the orbits of the Comets are
so very great that the motions of some of them scem to be
almost in a right line, tending directly towards the Sun.
Now, since the orbits of the Comets are so extremely ec.
centric, their motions, when they are in their perihelia, or
nearest distance from the Sun, must be much swifter than
when they are in their aphelia, or farthest distance from
him; which is the reason why the Comets make so short
a stay in our system, and, when they disappear, are so long
in returning.
The figures of the Comets are observed to be very dif.
ferent; some of them send forth small beams, like hair,
every way round them; others are seen with a long fiery
tail, which is always opposite to the Sun. Their magni
tudes are also very different, but in what proportion they
exceed each other, is as yet uncertain. Nor is it probable
that their numbers are yet known, for they have not been
observed with due care, nor their theories discovered, but
of late years. The ancients were divided in their opinions
concerning them ; some imagined that they were only a
kind of Meteors, kindled in our atmosphere, and were there
again dissipated; others took them to be some ominous pro
digies; but modern discoveries prove that they are worlds,
subject to the same laws of motion as the Planets are; and
they must be very hard and durable bodies, else they could
not bear the vast heat which some of them, when in their
perihelia, receive from the Sun, without being utterly con
sumed. The great Comet which appeared in the Year
1680, was within ; part of the Sun's diameter from his sur
face; and therefore its heat must be intense beyond imagi
nation, and when it is at its greatest distance from the Sun
the cold must be as rigid. -
The fixed Stars are those bright and shining bodies
which, in a clear night, appear to us every where dispersed
through the boundless regions of space. They are termed
fixed, because they are found to keep the same immutable
distance from each other in all ages, without having the
motions observed in the Planets. The fixed Stars are all
placed at such immense distances from us, that the best
of telescopes represent them no bigger than points, without
having any apparent diameter.
It is evident from hence, that all the Stars are luminous
bodies, and shine with their own proper and native light,
clse
. c.
264 The Young MAN's BEST CoMPAN 10N.
else they could not be seen at such a great distance. For
the statellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Herschel, though
they appear under considerable angles, through good teles
copes, yet are altogether invisible to the naked eye. -
Although the distance betwixt us and the Sun is vastly
great, when compared to the diameter of the Earth, yet it
is nothing when compared with the prodigious distance of
the fixed Stars; for the whole diameter of the Earth's an
nual orbit appears, from the nearest fixed Stars, no larger
than a point, and the fixed Stars are at least 100,000 times
farther from us than we are from the Sun; as may be de
monstrated from the observations of those who have endea
voured to find the parallax of the Earth's annual orbit, or
the angle under which the Earth's orbit appears from the
fixed Stars. * > -
Hence it follows, that though we approach nearer to a
fixed Star at one time of the year than we do at the oppo
site, and that by the whole length of the diameter of the
Earth's orbit, or 190 millions of miles, yet this distance,
being so small in comparison with the distance of the fixed
Stars, their magnitude of positions cannot thereby be sen
sibly altered. Therefore we may always without error sup
pose ourselves to be in the same centre of the heavens, since
we have always the same visible prospect of the Stars, with
out any alteration. - - - * * - -
If a spectator was placed as near to any fixed Star, as
we are to the Sun, he would there observe a body as large
as the Sun appears to us; and our Sun would appear to
him no bigger than a fixed Star, and undoubtedly he would
reckon the Sun as one of them, in numbering the Stars.
Wherefore, since the Sun differeth in nothing from a fixed
Star, the fixed Stars may be reckoned as so many Suns. -
It is not unreasonable to suppose that all the fixed Stars,
are placed at the same distance from us; but it is more pro
bable that they are every where interspersed through the
vast indefinite space of the universe; and that there may be
as great a distance betwixt any two of them as theie is be
twixt our Sun and the neauest fixed Star. Hence it ſol
lows, why they appear to us of different magnitudes, nºt be
cause they realiy are so, but because they are at different
distances from us; those that are nearest excelling in bright
ness and lustre those that are more remote, which give a
fainter light, and appear smaller to the eye.
Astronomers
i
:
. . . . * * ASTRONOMY. . - 265
Astronomers distribute the Stars into several orders, or
elasses; those that are nearest to us, and appear brightest
to the eye, are called Stars of the first magnitude; those
that are nearest to them in brightness and lustre, are called
Stars of the second magnitude; those of the third class
are styled Stars of the third magnitude; and so on until we
come to the Stars of the sixth magnitude, which are the
smallest that can be discerned by the naked cye. There.
are infinite numbers of smaller Stars that can be seen
through telescopes; but these are nºt reduced to any of
the six orders, and are only called telescopic Stars. It may
be here observed, that though astronomers have reduced
all the Stars that are visible to the naked eye into some one
or other of these classes, yet we are not thence to conclude
that all the Stars answer exactly to some one or other of
these orders; but there may be in reality as many orders
of the Stars as there are numbers, few of them appearing"
of the same size and lustre. * † -
The ancient astronomers, that they might distinguish the .
Stars in regard to their situation and position to each
other, divided the whole starry firmanent into several as
terisms, or systems of Stars, consisting of those that are :
near to one another. These asterisms are called constella->
tions, and are digested into the forms of some animals, as
men, lions, bears, serpents, &c. or to the images of some .
known things, as a crown, a harp, a triungle, &c." --
.The starry firmament was divided by the ancients into
48 images or constellations; twelve of these they placed ;
in that part of the heavens in which the plants of the
planetary orbits are; this part is called the Zodiac, because
the constellations placed therein resemble some living
creature. The two regions of the Heavens on each side
of the Zodiac are called the north and south parts of the
heavens. - : * * -

The constellations noted by the ancients on the south
side of the Zodiac were the Iſ'hales, the River Eridanus,
the Hare, Orion, the Great Dog, Little Dog, the Ship
Argo, Hydra, the Centaur, the Cup, the Crow, the Hoff,
the Altar, the Southern Crow, and the Southern Fish. To
these have been lately, added the following, viz. the
Pharnir, the Crane, the Peacock, Noah's Dove, the Indian,
the Birdof Paradise, Charles's Oak, the Southern Triangle,
the Fly, or Bec, the Swallºw, the Chamelion, the Flying
J’ish, Toucan, or the American Gouse, the IWater Serpent,
and the Sword Fish. - * . . .
. The ancients ſcigned these particular constellations or
figurcs in the heavens, either to commemorate the deeds
of some great man, or some notable exploit or action; or
else took them from the fables of their religion, &c. And
modern astronomers still retain them, to avoid the con
fusion that would arise from making new ones, when they
compare the modern observations with the old ones.
Some of the principal Stars have particular names given
them, as Syrus, Arcturus, &c. There are also several
Stars that are not reduced into constellations, and these
are called, unformed Stars. -
Besides the Stars visible to the naked eye, there is a very
remarkable space in the heavens, called the Galary, or
Milky Way. This is a broad circle of a whitish hue, like
inilk, going quite round the whole heavens, and consisting
ofan infinite number of small Stats, visible through a te
Jescope, though not discernible by the naked eye, by rea
son of their exceeding faintness; yet, with their light they
combine to illumine that part of the heavens where they
are, and to cause that shining whiteness. - - - -
> The places of the fixed Stars, or their relative situations
one from another, have beçn carefully observed by astro
numers, and digested into catalogues. The first among
the Greeks, who leduced the Stars into a catalogue, was

catalogue (and some of the
Hipparchts, who from his own observations, and of those
who lived before him, inserted 1022 Stars in his catalogue
about 120 years before the Christian AEra; this catalogue
has been since enlarged and improved by several learned
men, to the number of 3000, of which there are a great
many telescopial, and not to be discerned by the naked
eye; and these are all ranked in the catalogue as Stars of
the seventh magnitude. . . - -
It may seen strange to some, that there are no more than
this number of Stars visible to the naked eye; for sometimes,
in a clear night, they scem to be innumerable. But this
is only a deception of our sight, arising from their vehement
sparkling, while we look upon them confusedly, without
reducing them into any order; for there can seldom be
seen above 1000 Stars in the whole Heavens with the naked.
eye at the same time; and if we should distinctly view
them, we shall not find many but what are inserted upon a
ood celestial Globe. - . - -
Although the number of Stars that can be discerned by:
the naked eye are so few, yet it is probable there are many
more which are beyond the reach of our optics; for through:
telescopes they appear in vast multitudes, every where
dispersed, throughout the whole Heavens; and the better
our glasses are, the more of them we shall discover. The
ingenious Dr. Hook, has observed 74 Stars in the Pleiades,
of which the naked eye is never able to discern above 7;
and in the Orion, which has but 80 Stars in the British
m telescopial) there has been
numbered 2000 Stars. - '*. :

And since the Planets are subject to the same laws of

to, but vastly ex-ed it in magnitude, it is not unreasonable
to suppose that they are all habitable worlds." And since
the fixed Stars are no way behind qur Sun, either in size:

in relation to the art of making Dials: but first it may be

In making this Dial you make two Dials; for the erect
direct North Dial is but the back-side of the south, for as
this beholds the south part of the meridian, so the other
faces the north part of the meridian; and as the meridian.

so the back side thereof, viz. the north side, represents the

only receiving the hours of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the morning,
and the same at night, and (in this latitude) not all of them
neither; for it shines not in this plane at 8 in the morning,

Having given these examples as specimens of the
mechanical structure of dials, I will now point out the
method of performing the like by the globe. -
To construct a horizontal dial by a globe, elevate the
globe to the latitude of the place, say 58.9 the latitude of
London; turn it till some particular meridian comes to the
inorth point ofthe horizon; sit the index to XII. now turn
the globe tºll the index points to I. and the meridian will
cut the horizon in the number of degrees from the north
point that I. is distant from XII, and so on with repect to

of the globe cuts the horizon in the number of degrees
from the north to the east, viz. 1139; 24.3°; 384.”; 534°;.
71,” and 90°, which are the respective distances of the
hours I. II. III. IV. V. V.I. from XII. m the plane of the
horizon. The same is to be done with regard to the morn
ing hours, and, being transferred to the horizontal plane,
on which is fixed a gnomon, the dial is complete.
Of Beautifying AND colou RING DIALs,
First, the boards are to be brushed over with Linseed Oi!,
thinly ground with Spanish brown, done over three or fºur
times (drying between each timey, a little thicker cach time
with the colour, and this is called Priming. *
To MAKE THE FAT OiL Fon DIALs.
Boil Red-lead, and Linseed Oil, and a little litharge of
Gold (about a penny-worth), together, till almost as thicſ,
as syrup; and when cold, and well settled, pour the clearest
into a bottle or bladder for use. - -
THE Goln S12 e For DIALs.
Mirfine ground yellow Ochre with the aforesaid fat oil
to such a consistency as when used it may settle smooth of
itself. - -
A Mixture For Hou R Lines.
Grind Vermilion or Lamp-black with the fat Oil.

First draw them with a Pencil dipt in the Gold Size before
mentioned; and when so dry as to stick to your fingers, then
with a smooth-edged penknife shape your leaf-gold to your
mind; take it up with a piece of cotton cloth fired to the end
ofa stick, and lay it on the size, pressing it down with the
same cotton, and when dry brush off the loose: gold, with a
feather, and smooth the rough edges of the letters with a

oak, one, two, or more feet square, and about three inches
thick. Take two boards, and get them planed on both sides,
and thenlaid in the sun-shine, or near a moderate fire, two or
three days together, then plane them again, and fit them with
goodjoints, and fasten them in gluing with wooden pegs, as
gou may have seen coopers fir their pieces of heading to
their casks, and when thus glued and dried, plane them
again, and then fasten them, by mailing two small plates of
iron or tin on the back. If you cannot get seasoned wood,
but green, then boil it about an hour in water, to make
it tough and keep it frºm warping. In the general, wood is
accounted better than stone, because it keeps the colouring
more staunch or firm. - - - - - - - --- -
Before you colour your Dial-plate or board, fir your
iron stile of 38 degrees (which indifferently serves for all
England), and having marked your hour-lines with ink, fas.
ten a nail at the end of each hour-line, that the head ºf each
nail may shadow or direct you to the centre when it is coloured.
And as it may happen that golden letters or figures may decay
an a few years, you may on that account, make them with a
white lead paint, painted with red in a black margin. IWhen
your Dial is finished out dry, dip a father in your oil, and
anoint it thinly ; for the finer you mir or grind the colouring
with the oil, the more beautiful it appears, though not so
lasting. -

The current coin of this nation is either made of Cop
per, Silver, or Gold. Of Copper is made the Farthings,
Halfpence, Pence, and Two-pences. Of Silver the Pennies,
Two-pences, Three-pences, Groats, Sixpences, Shillings,
Half-crowns, and Crowns. But ºthere is very little Silver
coined below the Sixpence. Of Gold is made the Quarter
Guinea, the third of a Guinea, or Seven Shilling Piece,
the Half-Guinea, the Guinea, and Five-Guinea Pieces.
There are also some few ancient pieces of Gold, of a pale
volour, as being alloyed with Silver, and therefore may
be reckoned the best, and sometimes called Angel or Crown
Gold; but the Old Gold, or broad Pieces, are mostly al
loyed with copper, which makes them of a reddish colour.

but better thus, 1.4—10–8 #: The Mark for
pounds standing before the sum denominates the first num

follow shillings, and after shillings succeed pence, &c.
When the price of any thing is shillings and pence, it is
set down thus: s. d. -

a halfpenny, or one half of what it follows. s
three farthings, or 3-4ths or qis. of what it follows. :
And being thus set fraction-wise, the under figures
show how many parts of the quantity before it is divided
into, and the upper figures show how many of those under
parts the fraction stands for; as thus, # an ell, 3 of a foot,

THE GARDENER's CALENDAR;
Or the Practice of Gardening in all its Branches, for the
- twelve Months in the Kear.
J A N U A R Y-Plºure Garden. -
FROST is to be expected now, and nothing is so hurtful
to tender Flower-roots, and their Shoots for Spiing.
Ranunculuses, Anemonies and Tulips will be in danger;
cover the Beds to guard them; lay on Pea-straw, where
they are not come up; but where the Shoot appears,
place Hoops with Mats and Cloth upon them. This is the
common Practice; but in that excellent Work, The Com
plete Body of Gardening, there is a method proposed, much
easier and better. This is to place behind them a Reed
hedge, sloping three Feet forward.' A Mat is to be let
down from the Top in severe Weather, and taken up in
mild. This preserves them, and yet does not draw them
weak, or make them tender. Cover the Beds and Boxes
of seedling Flowers; and take off the Defence when the
Weather is milder. Cover Carnation Plants from Wet, and
defend them from Mice and Sparrows.
Clean the Auricular Plants, pick off dead leaves, and
scrape away the Surface of the Mould; put fresh Mould
in the place of it, and set the Pots up to the brim in the
Mould of a dry Bed, and place behind them a Reed-hedge.
For the Kitchen Garden. Throw up some new Dung in a
heap to heat, that it may be ready to make Hot-beds both
for the early Cucumbers and Melons in this part df the
ground, and for raising seeds of Annuals in the Flower
garden. Dig up the ground that is to be sown with the
Spring crops, that it may lie and mellow.
Nurse the Cauliflower Plants kept under glasses careſul
ly; shut out the Frost, but in the middle of milder days
let in a little air; pick up the dead leaves, and gather up
the mould about the stalks. - -
Make a slight Hot-bed in the open ground, for young
Salading, and place hoops over it, that it may be covered
in hard weather. Plant out Endive for Seed into warm
Borders; earth and blanch Celery. Sow a few Beans and
Peas, and seek and destroy Snails and other Vermin.
Fruit Trees, whether in Orchards, or Espaliers, or
against Walls, demand the same general management.
Cut off
. . GARDENING. 293
Cut off dead Wood and irregular Branches; clean the
Stumps and Boughs from Moss with a hollow Iron ; and
repair Espaliers, tastening the Stakes and Poles with Nails
&c. and tie the Shoots down with the twigs of Osier.
Place Stakes by all new planted Trees; and cut Grafts
to be ready; lay them in the Earth under a warm Wall.
F E B R U A R Y –Pleasure Garden.
Make Hot-beds for annual flowers with the Dung laid
up for that purpose, and sow them upon a good bed of
Mould, laid regularly over the dung.
Transplant perennial Flowers and hardy Shrubs, Can
terbury Bells, É. and the like. Break up and new lay
the Gravel-walks. Weed, rake, and clean, the box borders.
Sow Auricula and Polyanthus seeds in boxes; these
should be made of rough boards six Inches deep, with holes
at the bottom for carrying off water; they must be
filled with light Mould, and the secds scattered thinly over
the surface; then some more Mould must be sifted over
them a quarter of an Inch thick, and be set where they
can have the morning Sun...
Plant out Carnations into pots for flowering.
Dig and level Beds for sowing Radishes and Onions,
Carrots and Parsnips; and Dutch Lettuce : Leeks and
Spinach should also be sown now, also Beets, Celery,
Sorrel and Marygolds, with any other of the hardy kinds.
Make up the Hot-beds for early Cucumbers, and sow
Cauliflower-seeds and some others. -
Plant Beans and sow Peas; the best way is to sow a
Crop every Fortnight, that if one succeeds and another
falls, as will often be the case, there may still be a cousant
supply, at the due season, for Table. Plant Kidney beans
upon a ſlot-bed for an early crop. The Dwarf, White, and
Battersea Beans, are the best sorts. They must have Air in
the middle of mild days when they are up, and once in two
days they must be gently watered. Transplant Cabbages,
plant out Silesia and Cos Lettuce from the beds where they
grew in Winter,andplant Potatoesand Jerusalem Artichokes.
Most kinds of Trees may now be pi uned, but it will be
better to do it in Autumn; whatever has been omitted
must be done now, the hardiest kinds being pruned first,
and such as are more tender at the latter end of the month,
when there will be less danger of he r suffeling from frost.
- - - - - 3 Transplant
*94 TII E You NG MAN's Best CoM PANIon.
Transplant Fruit-trees to the places where they are
wanted; opening a large hole, settling the Earth carefully
about their Roots, and nailing them at once to the Wall, or
fastening them to strong stakes. Nail up the tender Trees
with care. Sow the Kernels of Apples and Pears, and
Stones of Plumbs, for Stocks, and keep off the Birds.
M A R C H-–Pleasure Garden.
Watch the beds of tender Flowers, and throw Mats over
them supported by Hoops in hard weather.
Transplant all the hardy perennial fibrous-rooted Flow
ers, Sweet-williams, Golden-rods. Dig up the earth about
those which were planted in Autumn, and clean the
Ground between. * -
All the Pots of flowering Plants must now be dressed.
Pick of dead leaves, remove the Earth at the top, and put
fresh in the place, give them a gentle watering, and set
them in their places for flowering. Taking care the Roots
are not wounded, repeat this once in three days.
The third week in March is the time to sow sweet Peas,
Poppies, Catchflies, and all the hardy annual Plants.
The last week is proper for transplanting Evergreens;
but for this purpose a showery day should be chosea.
New Hot-beds must be made to receive the Seedlings of
annual Flowers raised in the former.
Sow in the beds of the Kitchen-garden some Carrots and
also the large Peas, Rouncevals and Grey.
In better Ground sow Cabbages and Savoys, also
Carrots and Parsnips for a second Crop, and towards the
(nd of the Month put in a large parcel of Beans and Peas.
Sow Parsley and plant Mint; also Cos and Imperial
Lettuce; and transplant the finer kinds.
In the first Week sow Dutch Parsley for the roots.
In the last Week if dry Days, make Asparagus-beds.
Clear up the Artichoke-roots, slip off the weakest, and
plant them out for a new Crop, leaving four from each
good Root to bear; and from such as are weaker, two.
Dig up a warm border, and sow French Beans. Let them.”
have a dry soil; and give them no Water till they appear.
The Grafts, which were cut off early and laid in the
Ground to be ready for use, are now to be brought into
service, those of the earlier kinds are to be used first, and
the Apple last of all. Look to the Stocks inoculated last

Year and take off their Heads. A Hand-breadth should
be left on the Place: This holds the Bud secure by tying
to it, and the Sap rises more freely for its Nourishment.
The Fruit-trees planted last October must be headed :
and should be cut down to almost four Eves; the Sap
then rises more freely.
A P R I L-Pleasure Garden.
Tic up the stalks of all Flowers to sticks two feet long,
thrusting eight Inches into the Ground, and let them be
hid among the Leaves, rake the Ground between them.
Take of the slips of Auriculas, and plant them out care
fully for an increase. Transplant perennial Flowers and
Evergreens, and take up the roots of Colchicams, and
other bulbous Plants.
Sow French Honysuckles, Wall-flowers, and other hardy
Plants, upon the natural Ground; and the tenderer kinds
on Hot-beds. Transplant those sown last Month into the
second IIot-bed. Plant some Tubereses in a moderate
Hot-bed, and sow Carnations and Pinks on the natural
Ground and open Borders.
Plant a large crop of French Beans, choosing a dry
warm Border. Plant cuttings of Sage and other aromatic
Plants. Sow Marrowfat Peas, and plant some Beans for a
late crop; also Thyme, Sweet Marjoram, and Savory. .
Prepare Dung for making ridges to receive Cucumber
or Melon-plants designed for Bell or Hand-glasses.
S w young Sa'ading once in ten Days: also Cos and
Silesia Lettuces.
The sectis of all kinds being in the Ground, look to the
growing crops, clear away the weeds among them, and dig
up the Earth between the rows ºf Beans, Peas, and all other
kinds that are planted at distances. This will give them
a strong growth, and bring them soon to perfection.
Draw up the Mould to the stalks of the Cabbages, and
Cauliflower-plants; and in cold Nights cover with glasses
Carly-Cucumbers and Mclous.

Take up the Hyacinth-roots which have done flowering,
and lay them sidewise in a Bed of dry rich Mould, leaving
the stems and Leaves out to die away; this practice great

take off all straggling Branches from the large flowering
Plants, and train them up in a handsome shape.
Plant out French and African Marygolds, with other
Autumnals, from the Hot-beds the last Week of this
Month, choosing a cloudy warm Day.
Tie up the stalks of Carnations. Plant cuttings of the

more advanced for planting them in the open Ground.
Water once in two bays those Plants that require
it. Destroy Weeds in all parts of the Ground, and dig up
the Earth between the rows, and about the large kinds.
Sow small Salading once in ten Days, as in the former

also Endive, and plant Beans and Peas for a large crop,
and French Beans to succeed the others. With care thesc
kinds may be had fresh and young throughout the Season.
On a moist day, an hour before Sun-set plant some

In the Fvening of a mild showery Day plant out into
the open Ground the tender Annuals hitherto kept in
Pots in the Hot-bed Frame; they must be carefully
loosened from the sides of the Pot, and shaken out with all
the Mould about them: a large hole must be opened for
each ; they must be placed upright in it, and when settled
by a gentle watering, tied to Sticks. . .
Let Pinks, Carnations, and Sweet-williams, be laid this
Month for an increase. Let the Layers be covered
lightly, and watered every Day a little at a time. -
. The Spring Flowers being now over, and their Leaves
faded, the roots must be taken up and laid by for planting
again at a proper Season. Snow-drops, Winter-aconite,
and the like, are to be thus managed. -
The Hyacinth roots, laid flat in the Ground, must now
be taken up, the dead Leaves nipped off, and the Mould ;
and, when clean, laid upon a Mat in an airy Room to har

Cut the cups or pods of Carnations that are near blowing,
in three or four places, that they may blow regularly.
Inoculate some of the fine kinds of Roses.
In the Kitchen Garden, transplant the Cauliflower Plants
sown in May. Give them a rich Bed and frequent waterings.
Plant out Thyme an other savoury Plants sown before,
and in the same manner shade and water them. Take the
advantage of cloudy weather to sow Turnips; and if there
be no Showers, water the Ground once in two Days.
Sow Brocoli upon a rich Border, and plant out Celery
for blanching." This must be done in trenches a Fool and
a half deep, and the Plants must be set half a Foot asunder
in the rows. Endive should also be planted out for
blanching; but in this the Plants should be set fifteen
inches asunder, and at the same time some Endive-seed
must be sown for a second crop. Pick up Snails; and in
the damp Evenings kill the naked Slugs.

unless very severe, and be valuable in the Spring. The
second week in August sow Cabbage-seed of the early
kinds; and a week after sow Cauliflower-seed. Some of
these may be also ventured in a very well defended situa

and brown Dutch kinds, in a warm and well sheltered
piece of Ground. Transplant Lettuces, sown earlier in
warm and well sheltered Borders. Take up Garlic, and
spread it on a Mat to harden; also Onions and Rocambole;
and at the latter end of the Month, Shalots.
Watch the Fruit on your Wall-trees, and keep off
Vermin swarming about them. Pick up Snails, and hang
Bottles of sweet Water for Flies and Wasps, fasten loose
Branches, and gather the Fruit, carefully as it ripens.
Go round the Vines, and pull of trailing Branches so

STENOGRAPHY, or SHORT-HAND. "
The art of stenography, or short-writing, was known
and practised by most of the ancient civilized nations.
The Egyptians, who were distinguished for learning at an
early period, at first expressed their words by a delineation
of figures called hisroglyphics. A more coucise mode of
writingseems to have been afterwards introduced, in which
only a part of the symbol or picture was drawn. This
answered the purpose of short-hand in some degree.
After them the Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Romans,
adopted different methods of abbreviating their words and
sentences, suited to their respective languages. The
initials, the finals, or radicals, often served for whole
words ; and various combinations of these sometimes
formed a sentence. Arbitrary marks were likewise em
ployed to determine the meaning, and to assist legibility;
and it seems probable that every writer, and every author
of antiquity, had some peculiar method of abbreviation,
calculated to facilitate the expression of his own senti
ments, and intelligible only to himself.
It is also probable, that some might by these means
take down the heads of a discourse or oration; but few,
very few, it is presumed, ceuld have followed a speaker
through all the meanders of rhetoric, and noted with pre
cision every syllable, as it dropt from his mouth, in a
manner legible even to themselves. To arrive at such
consummate perfection in the art was reserved for more
modern times, and is still an acquisition by no means
general.
In every language of Europe, till about the close of the
16th century, the Roman plan of abbreviating (viz. substi
tuting the initials or radicals, with the help of arbitraries,
for words) appears to have been employed. Till then no
regular alphabet had been invented expressly for stenogra
phy, when an English gentleman of the name of Willis
invented and published one. His plan was soon altered
and improved, or at least pretended to be so. One al
teration succeeded another: and at intervals, for a series
of years past, some inen'of ingenuity and application have
composed , and published systems of stenography, and
doubtless have themselves reaped all the advantages that
attend it. But among the various methods that have been
- - - P - - -

proposed, and the different plans that have been adoptedby
individuals, hone has yet appeared fortunate enough to
gain general approbation; or proved sufficiently simple,
clear, and concise, to be universaily studied and prac.
tised.
The English writers on stenography, are Mr. Addy,

Bridges, Byrom, Coles, Cross, Dix, Everardt, Even,
Facey, Farthing, Gibbs, Graeme, Gurney, Heath, Holds.
worth, Hopkins, Jeake, Labourer, Lane, Lyne, Macau
ley, Mason, Mavor, Metcalfe, Nicholas, Palmer, Rich,
Ridpath, Shelton, Steele, Tanner, Taylor, Thicknesse,
Tiffen, Welster, Weston, Williamson, Willis, B. D. and
Willis, &c. Of all these, Dr. Mavor has given the most
complete work in his Universal Stenography, which is now
used as a class book in many schools.
Some systems are replete with unmeaning symbols,
perplexing arbitraries, and ill-judged contractions; which
render them so difficult to be attained by a common capa
city, or ordinary application, that it is not to be won
dered at if they have sunk into neglect, and are now no
longer known. Other systems, by being too prolix, by
containing a multiplicity of characters, and those charac
ters not simple or easily remembered, become ineffectual
to the purpose of expedition, and are only superior in
obscurity to a common hand. Some, again, not only
reject all arbitraries and contractions, but even preposi
tions and terminations; which last, if not too lavishly em
ployed and badly devised, highly contribute to promote
both expedition and legibility; and though they reduce
their characters to fewer than can possibly express the
various modifications of sound, yet they make nearly one
half of them complex. In the disposition of the vowels,
there is the greatest perplexity in most systems. A dot is
sometimes substituted for all the vowels indiscriminately,
and the judgment is left to determine which letter out of
six any dot is intended to express; or a minute space is
allotted them : so that unless they be arranged with ma
thematical precision, they cannot be distinguished from
one another; but such a minute attention is inconsistent
with the nature of short-hand, which should teach us to
write down in a short time, as well as in small bounds,
what we wish to preserve of what we hear. Nor is the
plan of lifting the pen and putting the next consonant in
the vowel's place, in the middle of words, less liable to
objec
STEN og RAPHY. 315
objections; or that of representing all the vowels by dis
tinct characters, being obviously ill-calculated for facility
and dispatch, and consequently inadmissible into any use
ful system.
The person who first proposed the omission of vowels in
the middle of words, which it is obvious are not wanted,
and invented letters, which could be connected as in a
running hand without lifting the pen in the middle of the
word, made a real improvement on the works of his pre
decessors. But most systems, either in their plan or
execution, labour under, some capital defect, attended
with circumstances highly discouraging to the learner, and
which in a great measure defeat the end of their invention,
by being too complicated to be learned with ease and re
membered with accuracy, or to be practised with the ex
pedition which is requisite; and so difficult to be deci
phered, that a man can scarcely read what he has just
written.
To obviate these defects; to provide against prolixity
and conciseness, which might occasion obscurity; to ex
hibit a system founded on the simplest principles, which
might be easily learned and read, and yet be capable of
the utmost expedition—were the motives that gave rise to
the present attempt. -
This method will be found different from any yet pub
lished, and superior to all in the disposition of the vowels
and the facility of arranging them; the confusion in plac
ing which seems to detract from the merit of the best per
formances on the subject ; and it may be affirmed, without
ostentation, that characters simpler in their form, and
more perfect in their union, have not been applied to the
art of stenography.
As well as it could be determined, the simplest charac
ters are appropriated to the letters most usually employed:
indeed, as far as possible, those which are complex have
been rejected; but as it was an object always kept in view
that the writing should be on a line, a few are admitted
into the alphabet for that reason.
The characters for the double and triple consonants are
the easiest that could be invented, consistent with per
spicuity; for care has been taken to provide against all
obscurity which might arise by adopting letters too similar
in their formation; and with respect to the prepositions
and terminations, those which occur most frequently are
P 2
316 THE YouNG MAN's BEST CoMPANIox.
expressed by the simplest characters, which will be found
perfectly easy in their application.
The arbitraries are few in number, and the arbitrary
abbreviations, as they are entirely from the letters of the
alphabet, and chosen from some thousand of words in
conimon use, will well repay the learner for an hour's
trouble in committing them to memory.
In the last section is laid down a scheme of abbreviation,
comprised in a few rules, perfectly easy to be understood
and practised by proficients in this art, which we hope
will be found free from the perplexity complained of in
many systems where abbreviation is admitted. The prin
cipal rules are new, and are so easy,so extensive in their use,
and so consistent with expedition and legibility, if applied
with judgment, that they alone might suffice. The learner
is however advised by no means to adopt any of them, till
experience has convinced him that they may be used
without error or injury to legibility. All abbreviating
rules ar suited to those only who have made some progress
in the stenographic art; for although they certainly pro
mote expedition in a wonderful manner, and afford the
greatest ease to a proficient, yet a learner, as expedition
is not his first, though his ultimate view, should admit of
nothing that in the least renders the reading difficult.
Of the Principles of Stenography.
The English alphabet consists of 26 letters; six of which
are vowels, as every school-boy knows. -
This alphabet, as is observed by the best grammarians
who have written on the language, is both defective and
redundant in expressing the various modifications of sound.
But all modern alphabets are equally, and some more
anomalous in these respects.
But as it is not our intention to propose a mode of spel
ling different from that in common use, when applied to
printing or long-hand writing, we shall only observe, that
in stenography, where the most expeditious and concise
method is the best, if consistent with perspicuity, the fol
lowing simple rules are studiously to be practised. -
Rule I. All quiescent consonants in words are to be
dropped; and the orthography to be directed only by the
pronunciation ; which being known to all, will render this
art attainable by those who cannot spell with precision in
long-hand.
STENoGRAPHY. 317
Rule II. When the absence of consonants, not entirely
dormant, can be easily known, they may often be omitted
without the least obscurity.
RULE III. Two or sometimes more consonants may, to
promote greater expedition, be exchanged for a single one
of nearly similar sound; and no ambiguity as to the mean
ing ensue.
RULE IV. When two consonants of the same kind or
same sound come together, without any vowel between
them, only one is to be expressed; but if a vowel or vowels
intervene, both are to be written ; but if they are perpen
dicular, horizontal, or oblique lines, they must only be
drawn a size longer than usual; and characters with loops
must have the size of their heads doubled.
Might is to be written mit, fight fit, machine mashin,
enough enf, laugh laf, prophet profet, physics fisiks, through
thro, foreign foren, write rite, wright rit, island iland,
knavery navery, temptation temtation, knife nife, stick stik,
thigh thi, honour onour, indictment inditement, acquaint
aquaint, chaos kaos, &c.
Strength strenth, length lenth, friendship frenship, connect
conek, commandment comanment, conjunct conjunt, humble
humle, lumbor lumer, slumber slumer, number numer, ex
emplary eremlary, &c.
Rocks ror, acts aks or ar, facts faks or far, districts
distriks or distrir, affects afeks or afer, afflicts afliks or
ºflir, conquer konkr, &c.
Letter teter, little litle, command comand, error cror,
terror teror, &c. But in remember, moment, sister, and
such like words, where two consonants of the same name
have an intervening vowel, both of them must be written.
These four rules, with their examples, being carefuily
considered by the learner, will leave him in no doubt con
cerning the disposition and management of the consonants
in this scheme of short-writing: we shall therefore proceed
to lay down rules for the application of the vowels with
ease and expedition. -
RULE I. Vowels, being only simple articulate sounds,
though they are the connectives of consonants, and em.
ployed in every word and every syllable, are not necessary
to be inserted in the middle of words; because the con
sonants, if fully pronounced, with the assistance of con
nection, will always discover the meaning of a word, and
make the writing perfectly legible.
RuLE II. If a vowel is not strongly accented in the
P 3
-3 HS THE YouNG-MAN's Best Companion.
ancipient syllable of a word, or if it is mute in the final,
it is likewise to be omitted; because the sound of the inci.
pient vowel is often implied in that of the first consonant,
which will consequently supply its place.
RULE III. But if the vowel constitutes the first or last
syllable of a vowel, or is strongly accented at its beginning
or end, that vowel is continually to be written.
RULE IV. If a word begins or ends with two or more
vowels though separated, or when there is a coalition of
yowels, as in diphthongs and triphthongs; only one of them
is to be expressed, which must be that which agrees best
with the pronunciation.
RULE V. In monosyllables, if they begin or end with
a vowel, it is always to be inscribed, unless the vowel e be
mute at the end of a word.
Such are the general principles of this art; in vindication
and support of which it will be needless to offer any argu
ments, when it is considered that brevity and expedition
are the chief objects, if consistent with legibility; and the
subsequent specimens in the orthography recommended
will, we hope, be sufficient, to show that there is no real
deficiency in the last mentioned particular.

Qf the Stenographic Alphabet.
As the whole of this art depends upon a regular method
and a simple alphabet, we have not only endeavoured to
establish the former on satisfactory principles, but have
been careful to appropriate, according to the comparative
frequency of their occurrence, such characters for the let
ters as, after repeated trials and alterations, were conceived
to be the best adapted for dispatch.
The stenographic alphabet consists of 18 distinct cha
racters (viz. two for the vowels and the rest for the conso
nants), taken from lines and semicircular curves; the form
alion and application of which we shall now explain, be
ginning with the vowels.
For the three first vowels, a, e, and i, a comma is appro
priated in different positions; and for the other three, o, u,
and y, a point. The comma and point, when applied to a
and o, is to be placed, as in Alphabet Plate, at the top of the
next character; when for e and u, opposite to the middle;
and when for i and y, at the bottom. -- -
This arrangement of the vowels is the most simple and
distinct that can easily be imagined. Places at the top,
the middle, and the bottom of characters, which make
three different positions, are as easily distinguished from
one another as any three separate characters could be ; and
a comma is made with the same facility as a point. .
Simple lines may be drawn four different ways; perpen
dicular, horizontal, and with an angle of about 45 degrees
to the right and left. An ascending oblique line to the right,
which will be perfectly distinct from the rest when joined
to any other character, may likewise be admitted. These
characters being the simplest in nature, are assigned to
those five consonants which most frequently occur, viz.
l, r, t, c hard or k, and c soft or s.
Every circle may be divided with a perpendicular and
horizontal line, so as to form likewise four distinct charac
ters. These being the next to lines in the simplicity of
their formation, we have appropriated them for b, d, n,
and m. -
The characters expressing nine of the consonants are all
320 The Young Mas's Best Cowpastos.
-
perfectly distinct from one another; eight only remain
which are needful ; viz. f. g, or j, h, p, q, w, w, and r. To
find characters for which we must have recourse to mixed
curves and lines. The characters which we have adopted
are the simplest in nature after those already applied, admit
of the easiest joining, and tend to preserve lineality and
beauty in the writing.
It must be observed that we have no character for c when
it has a hard sound, as in castle; or soft, as in city; for it
always has the sound of k or s, which in all cases will be
sufficient to supply its place: or c being easier written,
might be used in all cases for the hard sound.
It likewise is represented by the same character as l;
only with this difference, r is written with an ascending
stroke and l with a descending; which is always to be
known from the manner of its union with the following cha
racter; but in a few monosyllables where r is the only con
sonant in the word, and consequently stands alone, it is to
be made as is shown in the alphabet for distinction's sake.
The character for h, when lineality requires it, may be
made from the bottom and inverted: And often h may be
omitted entirely.
Z, as it is a letter seldom employed in the English lan
guage, and only a coarser and harder expression of s, may
be supplied by s whenever it occurs; as for Zedekiah write
Sedekiah, &c. or z itself may be used.
Of the Prepositions and Terminations.
The prepositions and terminations in this scheme are so
simple, that the greatest benefit may be reaped from them,
and very little trouble required to attain them; as the inci
pient letter or the incipient consonant ofall the prepositions
and of several of the terminations is used to express the
whole. But although in the Plate sufficient specimens
are given of the manner of their application, that the learner
of less ingenuity or more slow perception may have every
assistance, we have subjoined the following directions.
Rule I. The preposition is always to be written with
out joining, yet so near as plainly to show what word it
belongs to; and the best way is to observe the same order
as if the whole was to be connected.
Rule II. A preposition, though the same letters that
constitute it may be met with in the middle or end of a
word, is never to be used, because it would expose to ob
5Cu Tlty.
St.E.Nog RAPHY. 321
Rule III. Observe that the preposition omni is expres
sed by the vowel o on its proper position; and for anti, anta,
ante, by the vowel a, which the radical part of the word
will easily distinguish from being only simple vowels.
The first rule for the prepositions is (allowing such ex
ceptions as may be seen in the plate) to be observed for the
terminations; and also the second mutatis mutandis; except
that whenever sis, sus, sys, cious, tious, and ces occur, they
are to be expressed as directed in the fourth rule for the
consonants, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of
words. But in a few words where three horizontal charac
ters meet, it will be better to express the fis, &c. by the
semielliptical character in the Plate opposite tious.
RULE IV. The terminative character for tion, ston, cion,
cian, is to be expressed by a small circle joined to the
nearest letter, and turned to the right; and the plurals
tions, sions, cions, cians, rians, tience, by a dot on the same
side.
Rule V. The terminative character for ing, is to be ex
pressed likewise by a small circle, but drawn to the left
hand; and its plural ings by a dot. In horizontal charac
ters, by the left hand is meant the top, and by the right the
space below the letter. In all other chararctes the right
and left positions cannot be mistaken.
Rule VI. The plural sign s iz to be added to the ter
minative characters when necessary.
Rule VII. The separated terminations are never to be
used but in polysyllables or words of more syllables than
One.
These rules duly observed will point out a method as
concise and elegant as can be desired, for expressing the
most frequent and longest prepositions and terminations in
the English language. If it should be thought necessary
to increase their number by the addition of others, it will
be an easy matter for any one of the least discernment to
do so, by proceeding on the principles before laid down.
Rules for Abbreviations.
Though a more concise method of writing, or more nu
merous abbreviations, may not be indispensably necessary,
if the foregoing directions be practised for a considerable
time, yet contractions will be found extremely useful and
convenient to those who have attained a proper knowledge
of the subject, and lead to a greater degree of expedition,
at the same time that] they diminish the labor of writing,
322 THE You'NG MAN's BEST CoMPANIox.
It has been observed in the introduction, that abbreviations
are only to be employed by proficients in this art; becausg.
expedition is not the first, though the ultimate, object in
view : and that an easy legibility is of the utmost conse
quence to the learner; which, however, cannot be pre
served, if he adopts too soon those very rules which in time
will afford him the greatest ease when applied with judg
ment.
The following short and practical rules will be found
fully adequate to every purpose for which they were in
tended, and are far superior in the facility of their applica
tion to any which we have seen.
RULE I. The usual abbreviations in long-hand are always
to be followed; as Mr. for Master, M. D. for Doctor of
Physic, and Abp. for Archbishop.
RULE II. Substantives, adjectives, verbs, and participles,
when the sense will direct to the meaning, are to be expres
sed by their initial consonant with the distinguishing marks
exhibited in the Alphabet Plate,viz. a substantive must have
the dot exactly over its initial consonant; an adjective must
have a dot under it; a verb is to be expressed by a comma
over its initial consonant; and a participle by a comma
under. The dot or comma being placed thus will never
occasion them to be nºistaken for vowels, because they
should always be on one side or other; whereas the mark
for parts of speech must constantly be placed exactly over
or under. These being the four principal parts of speech
will be sufficient; and an adept will never be at a loss to
know when he can with safety apply this rule to them.
RuLe III. To render the writing more legible, the last
letter of the word may be joined to the first, and the proper
mark applied. -
RULE IV. The constituent or radical part of words, es
pecially if they are long, will often serve for the whole, or
for sometimes the first syllable; as, we ought to moderate
our er. by our circum.; a man's man, commonly shape his
for.
RULEV. All long words without exception may have
their prepositions or terminations expressed by the incipient
consonant of such preposition or termination.
RuLE VI. When there is a great dependence between
the parts of a sentence, the initial letter will often suffice;
as L. is the capital of Great B. ; the eldest S. of the king
of G. B. is styled P. of W. Every one, it is presumed,
Fºllow this to be perfectly legible either in long or short
8thd.
STEN og RAPHY. 323
Rule VII. The terminations mess and less may be
omitted; as faithfulness is only to be written faithful; for
wardness, forward; heedless, heed ; stubbornness, stubborn,
&c.
Rule VIII. The second and third persons of verbs,
ending in eth and cst, may be expressed by s ; as, he loves,
thou teaches; instead of he loveth, thou teachest : or even
without's ; as, he love, &c.
Rule IX. Words naturally supplied by the sense may
often be entirely omitted, and yet no ambiguity ensue; as,
In beginning God created heaven and earth, for in the begin
ning God created the heaven and the earth.
RULE X. When there is an immediate repetition of a
sentence or word, a line is to be drawn under the sentence
or word to be repeated; as, Amen, Amen, is to be written
Amen; but if any words intervene before a word or sentence
is to be repeated, the line must be drawn as before, and A or
mark of omission placed where the repetition should begin;
as, Is it just the innocents should be condemned a reviled

Fabricius's Reply to Pyrrhus.
As to my poverty, you have indeed, Sir, been rightly
informed. My whole estate consists in a house of but
mean appearance, and a little spot ofground, from which
by my own labour I draw my support. But if by any
means you have been persuaded to think, that this poverty
makes me less considered in my country, or in any degree
unhappy, you are extremely deceived. I have no reason
to complain of fortune, she supplies me with all that
nature requires; and if I am without superfluities, I am
also free from the desirc of them. With these I confess 1
should be more able to succour the necessitous, the only
advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied; but as
small as my possessions are, I can still contribute some
thing to the support of the state and the assistanee of my
friends. With regard to honors, my country places me,
poor as I am, upon a level with the richest; for Rome
knows no qualifications for great employments but virtue
and ability. She appoints me to officiate in the most
august ceremonies of religion; she entrusts me with the

command of her armies; she confides to my care the
-most inportant negotiations. My poverty does not lessen
the weight and influence of my counsels in the senate; the
Roman people honor me for that very poverty which you
consider as a disgrace ; they know the many opportunities
I have had in war to enrich myself without incurring cen
sure; they are convinced of my disinterested zeal for their
prosperity; and if I have any thing to complain of in the
return they make, it is only the excess of their applause.

Letter to a Friend against Waste of Time.
Converse. often with yourself, and neither lavish your
time, nor suffer others to rob you of it. Many of our
hours are stolen from us, and others pass inseusibly away ;
but of both these losses the most shameful is that which
happens through our own neglect. . If we take the trouble
to observe, we shall find that one considerable part of
our life is spent in doing evil, and the other in doing no
thing, or in doing what we should not do. We don't seem
to know the value of time, nor how precious a day is ;
nor do we consider that every moment brings us nearer
our end. Reflect upon this, I entreat you, and keep a
strict account of time. Procrastination is the most dan
gerous thing in life. Nothing is properly ours but the
—ºatwe breathe in, and all the rest is nothing; it is the
only good we possess; but then it is fleeting, and the first
moment robs us of it. Men are so weak, that they think
they oblige by giving of trifles, and yet reckon that time
as nothing for which the most grateful person in the world
can never make amends. Let us therefore consider time
as the most valuable of all things; and every moment
spent, without some improvement it virtue or some ad
vancement in goodness, as the greatest sublunary loss.
