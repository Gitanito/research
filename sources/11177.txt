  Experience Description:   

    As a four-year-old child, I had cardiac problems including arrhythmia and valve problems that frequently brought me to the hospital. One afternoon, I found 'myself' floating above our small house. I could see the roof of our house from above, as well as the yard and the woods. I saw everything from a bird’s eye view which is an angle I had never seen before. Floating in the sky above the trees, I saw a glowing lady in white and blue robes. She beckoned me to come to her. I thought/said, 'NO! I want to stay with my parents!' I instantly found myself back in my body lying on my bed.

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown.     I think this is the part of my experience that may be the most interesting, and the only thing I can attribute it to is my NDE as a child.  I am different from most people in that I have had frequent 'after-death communication', shared death experiences, prophetic dreams, miraculous events and events when I seemed to be a medium to heal others.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain I love everyone and often everything.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I can replay the event like a movie in my head.  Particularly strange, was the sense that I was making a choice as an adult consciousness when I was out of my 4-year-old body.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I am different from most people in that I have had frequent 'after-death communication', shared death experiences, prophetic dreams, miraculous events and events when I seemed to be a medium for spirit  to heal others physically and emotionally.  I am a very ordinary, somewhat conservative person.  But miracle after miracle happens to me.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Having the choice to stay or go.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes.    When a young person I know committed suicide, I knew he was in trouble at that moment he died even though I wasn't there.  I was miles away and hadn't even seen the boy or his family in three years. But at the moment of his death, I  felt tremendous pain in my chest and anxiety for him. I'd call it anguish.  An hour later, a friend called me to tell me about his death.  When the call came,  I knew what the news was to be.  In the months afterwards, through dreams, he communicated with me and asked me to give a message to his mother.  I was very reluctant to do it.  After about a year, I told her what had happened. She was relieved to know that her son still existed.  Other times, when people are physically healed by my channeling God's healing to them, they are usually very surprised and moved.  I can see people's auras and know much about them through their aura.  For example, my friend who has cancer has a gray area in her aura near the cancer.  In my normal awareness, I can be judgmental about people based on shallow appearances.  When I look at someone's aura, though, I inevitably love them with all my heart.  So, you can imagine I love everyone and I am very connected with everyone.  This has led to many interesting experiences, such as saving people from suicide (twice), and many other interesting connections--Knowing when people are in trouble, for example, or seeing them as translucent if they are near death.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It just 'was'.  When you are a child, everything is magical, so it fit in with life fairly seamlessly.  It just didn't seem odd.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I just 'know'.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         It's great.  Thank you.
