 The journal always listed itself as a monthly, but the numbering of issues (1/2 is January 1904, and 1/3, is January 1905) indicates a hiatus in publication.  The journal was published by The Metaphysical Magazine and advertised as "pocket size"--which seems to have been its real excuse for existence.  In 1906 it was combined with its parent, but apparently only temporarily, because it appeared thereafter as a separate journal again and was still being advertised in Man--a variant name for The Metaphysical Magazine--in 1913.  The issue for March 1905 has a long, sentimental article, "Is Man Alone Immortal?," by R.S. Clymer on the immortality of dogs.  Whipple (1848-1916)  edited the Metaphysical Magazine  and wrote widely on Metaphysical Healing--including Absent Treatment in Metaphysical Healing (New York, 1891), etc.--but always in a dry and intellectual way that contrasts sharply with this journal's more popular and less restrained competitors.
