  		      1823.        Damaska C NDE       10/12/2008.      NDE 21944.             I remember that moment where I had the sensation of the veins stretching and bursting. I felt the blood fill me head. There was instant silence and numbness, and then everything stopped. I can describe it as content. Instantly, I was outside my body, surrounded by a landscape of natural beauty. I seemed to be flying without the aid of anything or anyone. I was aware of my state. I was surely going somewhere, but I did not know where. I was passing over hills and valleys. There were all of these green trees and shrubs. The total beauty took me up, but I knew that was not what this was all about. Then, I suddenly saw right into my room.  
   Apparent stroke or brain hemorrhage.  NDE while on intense spiritual quest.  She is a reverend, and was born in Trinidad/Tobago.   

    1822.        Richard M NDE       12/17/2008.      NDE 3858.       From Canada.      I was in the hospital with total heart block from my second open heart and my heart stopped. I sat up in bed grabbed my brother by the neck. Next thing I know I'm standing with this other guy in the hall and I'm laughing at the monitor that is flat and I'm thinking wait till that guy figures out what's going on. Then my brother turns and looks out into the hall, next thing I'm really warm absolutely no pain and I'm thinking like I've never felt so positive in thought.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    1821.        Raymond C NDE       12/27/2008.      NDE 3857.             I didn't see a light or deceased loved ones but I recall looking at (although I had no eyes or a body) a bluish green almost translucent membrane. This membrane dominated an entire side of wherever I was. I could not see through this membrane but I could see shadow movement going on behind it and hear sounds and could feel the presence of many some-things behind it. I not only had very enhanced senses but my sense of taste and smell were so enhanced that I could taste and smell this membrane. Each time they stopped my heart I saw this with perfect clarity. I wasn't afraid but looking at it, I could sense great energy behind this membrane and it did not seem entirely benign.  
   NDE due to medically induced cardiac arrest to treat cardiac arrhythmia.   

    1820.        Michael K NDE       12/27/2008.      NDE 3856.             I can remember the emergency medical technicians saying I was dead, and discussing the use of charcoal. But I was leaving for another place. I do not remember the transition/journey. But I was fully cognizant of the place I was in. I had no sensations, heat, cold, sound, light, touch, not even pain. I felt my eyes were functioning normally. I had no trouble breathing. I felt I was in a place of great sorrow. All was black, as I felt my eyes were working the darkness seemed to go on forever into the distance in all directions. I turned in different directions searching the darkness, listening, but there was nothing. It seemed forever but then light, the lights and the ceiling of the emergency room came into focus. They had revived me.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt.  Void experience.   

    1819.        Michael H NDE       12/17/2008.      NDE 3853.             I was in an atmosphere of absolute white that had no ending anywhere. It was an unending white void. Suddenly, my late parents came to greet me but I do not recall them speaking to me. Other people were there suddenly and I did not recognize any of them. I was at total peace and comfort.                    
   NDE due to severe trauma from car accident.   

    1818.        Dorothy S NDE       12/27/2008.      Secondhand NDE 3851.             The next thing she knew she was floating at high speed down a long, perfectly black tunnel with the sensation of being enfolded in soft, luxurious black velvet. She used the words 'black velvet' in her description. She described how wonderful she felt, how good it was, with the complete absence of pain and struggle. No trouble breathing, no distress of any kind. She had a feeling of pure physical wellbeing and overwhelming goodness and relief.  
   Daughter shares mother’s NDE due to asthma attack in 1951. Mother is now deceased.   

    1817.        Linda K NDE       12/27/2008.      NDE 3849.             I turned to my right in the midst of that stream and looked straight into the eyes of Jesus. My Savior was standing on the side of the water where my grandparents had been on a level just a little above me. I shall never forget his eyes. They were dark and so full of love. I knew he knew everything about me from inside, out. I knew he instantly knew every thought I had ever had, every act I had ever done, everything, totally everything about me. I felt no fear at all. Just the strongest love I have ever felt from anyone anywhere in my entire existence. That love was real and sort of wrapped me up and cuddled me. Not Jesus, but the love, which poured from Him to me, was almost tangible. I wanted to go to Him.  
   NDE due to several cardiac arrests. Remarkably vivid NDE considering the severe brain damage and amnesia she suffered as a result of these cardiac arrests.   

    1816.        Anita K Possible NDE       12/27/2008.      Possible NDE 3848.       From Canada      Next thing I remember is being in very bright light, looking down on my body, a body that meant nothing to me. I did not see the room or doctors or husband or anything else in the room, my body was also surrounded by light. I was stunned, instead of being in awe or seeing the beauty, all I could think of was my thirteen-year-old mentally handicapped son, and my new baby. I could feel God (I think it was God) and I said to him, 'No God I'm not ready,' there was no need for words, it's like my thoughts were all that was needed.  
   During cesarean section. OBE above body saw body surrounded by light in operating room, but nothing else. Felt presence of God. No clear imminent life-threatening event in operating room or in recovery area that could be corroborated.   

    1815.        Dave W Possible NDE       12/17/2008.      Possible NDE 3847.             I closed my eyes and suddenly found myself in another place. I was a consciousness, and I could see all around me. I was in a very small close valley, almost a very wide ravine. It was in full Technicolor and seemed real. I could sense a light breeze; there was no sound. I was the only one there, and no one else had been there for a long, long time. I was on one side of this place. I could see up hill, downhill, and across to the other side. The grass seemed closely cut and green, and yet I felt like no one had been there for hundreds of years. It was a forgotten place, and I was totally alone.  
   Recovering from heart bypass surgery. No clear imminent life-threatening event at time of experience.   

    1814.        David G NDE       12/26/2008.      NDE 3839.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon.      This was an entity of white light, without definite form and hovering in the air. It was not exactly there, but I sensed its presence. It did nothing. While this was going on, I had the vision of a dog, which was bounding towards me with its tongue out; obviously full of good intentions. The person seated between the other two, on my right, struck the table with a gavel, while holding up some papers in the other hand. Then he said my name, and: 'He is condemned to go on living.'  
   NDE from post-operative complications.   

    1813.        Nora NDE       12/20/2008.      NDE 3843.       From the UK.      I felt like the whole world stood still. I didn't feel hard of breath, I felt calm. Next thing I know, I feel my spirit lifted from by body - more specifically by my shoulders. I looked up and the whole ceiling (the pool was indoors) was this gorgeous white light, as if a portal, I felt drawn to it in a way. At the time, I was looking down and could see my cousin standing and the nannies frantically talking. 'What should we do?' they said in Hindi but I understood it (I don't speak Hindi). At the time it felt weird I could see down at them but at the same time, I could see the tiles and the water around me in the pool as if they were all one. I remember looking down and having my whole life explained, to feeling the love of the people in my life, and most of all feeling like I had a choice to live.  
   NDE due to drowning in Qatar at age ten/eleven.   

    1812.        Anna-Mari Possible NDE       .      Possible NDE 3842.       From Estonia      I was rather ill and had a high temperature, about 39,9 C and I was lying in my bed. I closed my eyes and suddenly I saw this intense light that was everywhere. The next moment I was in a place and it was fuzzy and in the background I could see light again. I also saw a figure who was standing in the light and reaching his/her had to me. I tried to walk towards him/her, but I couldn't because there were an invisible wall between us. And when I tried to walk through it I couldn't because it hindered me. Then I saw the exact same light as at the beginning of the experience. The kind of light which filled everything. And I opened my eyes.  
   Age 11.  Illness, temp 39.9.  Saw light everywhere & another being.  No clear life-threatening event.   

    1811.        Greg B NDE       12/20/2008.      NDE 3841.             After being judged by GOD, I stepped out of the bright light and saw everyone.  The words out of my mouth to my mama were, 'Who the hell are all these people?' She said, 'What do you mean baby, they are you, they are all you.' I knew that meant that everyone I saw was from the generations before me and all the way back to the very start. The only male I got close to was my uncle Herschel who was pushing his way with force to reach me. I think he thought I wasn't going to be there long.  
   NDE due to infection of the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) and seizure.   

    1810.        Robin M NDE       12/20/2008.      NDE 3840.             I went to a place that was beautiful lit - like the sunshine but much prettier and more golden (kind of like sepia tones). Seemed like a neighborhood and I was shown around to all the people I loved and missed and they were all so happy. I remember being surprised like Oh, Hi - wow you're here how nice and smiling very broadly. Remember my dad sitting on a stoop of sorts with his hand outstretched to me. He was many years younger than he was when he died and I was just a toddler reaching up to him. I know I saw many people but can't remember who they were specifically except for my dad.  
   NDE due to heart attack.  Experience shared one week later.   

    1809.        Roxie J NDE       12/20/2008.      NDE 3837.             I knew I was going to die in the next few moments. I was fully okay with this revelation.  Then my world stopped. I saw a bright flash of light brighter than the sun, there was complete silence. Diamonds were in the light shining and falling all around me. I was spinning, flying, floating. It was a warm and pleasant feeling.  
   Auto accident. Experience may have begun prior to impact of semi on her car suggesting a component of Fear-Death Experience.   

    1808.        Fabia NDE       12/17/2008.      NDE 3823.       Originally from Tunisia, living in France. Original in French, translated to English by Amy.      Then I exit my body and ascend to the ceiling; I see my body entwined in bloody curtains, a door that keeps opening and closing. I am very far above, as if the ceiling were very high. The words, 'We can't save her! The car that was bringing blood was in an accident! We are sorry.' My mother's cries: all this must be happening in hushed tones, but I hear it so clearly and loud, it's metallic. I think: 'It's not possible that they are screaming so loudly!!!!' Then a deep wellbeing throughout my body, a desire to rejoin the scintillating brilliant light that is drawing me to it.  
   NDE from childbirth complications.   

    1807.        Marisol A NDE       8/31/2008.      NDE 16036.       From Quito, Chile.      She recalls everything turning black. Then she felt as if she was going very fast through some sort of a tunnel and was able to see everything that had happened the previous days. In the whirlpool, she even saw the things she wanted to buy. She felt bewildered at first. Then she saw herself on the floor, very pale and her frantic husband kneeling next to her trying to resuscitate her. When her daughter walked in crying, Marisol felt sorry for them. When the paramedics arrived, she watched how the resuscitation was applied and how she was taken into the ambulance. She felt very calm and at peace. While she was inside the ambulance, she realized it was going to be too difficult for her husband to raise their daughter by himself. He would have to leave his job to manage the coffee shop. Her daughter was still very young and needed guidance. After all these thoughts she decided that she could not leave yet.  
   Second-Hand NDE from Chile.   

    1806.        Suzy B NDE       12/17/2008.      NDE 3804.             A formless presence from inside the light told me without words that I needed to live. I refused them because I did not want to return to a life and body filled with constant pain. They told me that they needed me to live, and I told them that I needed to be with them. The light felt like a transitory place between earth and the next place, and I wanted to move on to the next place rather than going back. They expressed that I had an important purpose to fulfill for the Earth that was vital to the divine plan for our world.  
   NDE due to adverse reaction to medical treatment.   

    1805.        Marie C NDE       12/16/2008.      NDE 3784.       From Canada. Original in French, translated to English by Amy.      When I lost consciousness. I was floating in the water and I called out to my sister telepathically. I saw where she was sitting at the edge of the pool and I asked her to signal to someone that I was missing and that they should locate me. Right after I came to (after CPR) my thoughts were concentrating on the color blue. I was telling myself: 'It's really beautiful here. I have never seen a blue as beautiful as this.' But then I saw faces appearing in the blue sky and asked myself what these people were doing in my sky. It was the people witnessing the accident who were standing above me and who I saw appear one after the other.  
   Child drowning at age twelve.   

    1804.        Francesco I NDE       12/16/2008.      NDE 3828.       From Denmark.  Original in Italian, translated to English by Amy.      So that's what I was doing and then realized how bad the situation was when the force of the ocean dragged me out. Suddenly I was outside of my body and I saw myself under water surrounded by dead alg', at the mercy of the currents. I saw very well what was happening when my vision was turned upside down. Now my image was changed and narrowed so that I saw myself in an egg with my head down in the fetal position. I came back to life and the wave that had brought me back to shore had also hurled me near my companions.  
   Child drowning at age seven.   

    1803.        Michelle J Probable NDE       12/15/2008.      Probable NDE 3835.             Then I noticed there was a presence there with me that was so familiar. I had known this presence forever - or so it seemed. The presence knew me. The light could have consumed me, but no harm came to me. There was pure love in the light. I was at peace and my mind was totally opened in receiving whatever the presence in the light had to give. I totally trusted the presence (God) because I had remembered the light, for some reason. It was awesome! There was a sound in the light. It was very faint but also soothing. The Presence in the light (God) began to communicate telepathically to my mind and I was permitted to respond telepathically, even though He had already known what my response would be. I was given the question, if I would like to return.  
   Probable NDE due to suffocation from tumor near trachea.   

    1801.        Jamie N Probable NDE       12/15/2008.      Probable NDE 3829.             I was in a beautiful space that was filled with light. A male angel, whom I cannot describe other than as a being of light, was talking calmly to me. He told me that everything was going to be all right. I was going to come through this emergency and go on to live a very long and pleasant life. He said I would have little things happen as they do in life, but nothing really bad would happen to me. I would have mostly peace and much joy in my life.  
   Probable NDE due to peritonitis with ruptured colon.   

    1800.        Bob L NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3827.             The light was strong and somewhat unearthly at the end of a long tunnel. The light was as much love as anything in that it was pervasive. My relatives (all deceased) were there, all at their prime in life. They were dressed (I would say 1940's style which would have been prime years for most). Relatives I knew of, such as my grandfathers, but never knew in life were there as well as uncles and aunts who passed before I knew them. The unconditional love was overwhelming and permeated all of us genuinely and richly.  
   NDE due to three story fall from building.   

    1799.        Brian C NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3826.             When I got to the emergency room lying on stretcher, it was like I was looking down on myself and body, no pain. I could hear nurses and doctors talking, cutting my pants and clothes off. Nurse saying get a catheter, me peeing everywhere, laughing. Everything seemed real white, clear, and vivid 3D. Then I black out, the pain, seeing my bones popped out and blood.  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident.   

    1798.        Nancy M NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3825.             Then, I seemed to be sitting on the end of a hospital bed and a very beautiful angel appeared standing before me. My arms were by my side and my hands were in my lap. She had a full head of very gold, shining hair, that seemed to glow like a halo, but it was her hair shining. Her eyes were pale blue and she was wearing a soft brown gown that crisscrossed in front. The gown was edged in gold and she had a golden rope tied around her waist. I have often wondered why her gown was brown. She wrapped her arms tightly around my body and looked straight into my eyes. She did not speak verbally, but with her eyes I knew she said. 'You are not going anywhere, you are staying right here.'  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest.   

    1797.        Carl G NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3824.       From Russia      At this same moment, I was shot through a tunnel of light. I was standing before Christ, the light behind Him, was so bright, you could not look at with human eyes. He told me, 'No you must return for this reason, you will have a son born unto you.' (Three years later to the very day my son Julian was born.) Christ showed me my whole life, the good, the bad, and all the rest. Then Christ said, 'That is alright, life is a learning experience.' I was there for some time and Christ showed me much during that time. Some I was able to bring back with me. Christ gave me a message to tell all. Christ said, 'Tell them they must learn to love all that is around you. They must learn to love our God OR return to this world and live life all over again. OR they will lay down next to sleeping waters and drink from thereof.'  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    1796.        Kathy T NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3822.             The next I knew, I was up in the corner of the room, where the walls and the ceiling join. I could see myself, lying in the bed. I don't recall seeing a respirator, just the room and me lying on the bed. No one else was there. I looked for a moment, and then looked directly across the room to the opposite corner. I then floated (more propelled) diagonally across the room into the opposite corner and entered the corner. When I came out on the other side, it opened up into a tunnel.  
   NDE due to illness.   

    1795.        Thomas B NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3820.             I felt I was no longer part of this world but had easily slipped into another existence. I began to see my life up until then as if I was watching a movie. Recognition time had sped up and what would have taken days to view was now flashing by but I was able to see and comprehend everything I was seeing and hearing incredibly clearly. I have to say that even sight and sound had taken a new form. I was experiencing everything differently. Memories were like dots that swept in, unfolded, and were consumed by my new vision. I felt so beautifully at peace. Comfortable beyond anything I had experienced before.  
   NDE due to criminal attack at age seventeen.   

    1794.        Chari H NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3819.             About then, a light from above expanded above me. It filled the sky with a mass of bright colors. I felt a tugging sensation in my chest as the light started bringing me towards it. I felt Great Love coming from within the light. As I grew closer towards the light, I could see two figures coming towards me. I recognized them as my Great Grandfather who had passed away a few years earlier and my little brother who died at age two. My Great Grandfather was standing there holding my little brother's hand. They were very happy to see me, but I wasn't happy to see them. That's when I realized that I was dead. I became very upset. He could read my thoughts and his thoughts entered my thoughts. We communicated back and forth telepathically. As soon as I had a thought, he had an answer for me. I wanted to live so I began to beg Jesus and God for my life back, if they were listening to me, but I wasn't sure if they would grant me life.  
   Remarkably detailed NDE at age fourteen due to auto accident.   

    1793.        Rhea V Probable NDE       12/15/2008.      Probable NDE 3818.             At first I seemed to be moving through a dark tunnel toward a white light at the far end. The tunnel and the light grew larger. Eventually I emerged into what seemed like a strange new world, dark and mysterious. I felt alone as I moved on. Before me, blocking my way was a dark ominous figure (it seemed to be a male). He wore a long hooded robe and was silhouetted against a glorious rosy glow from pastel clouds that filled the sky at some distance behind him. The rosy glow drew me and filled me with a marvelous sense of total love and acceptance. This was home, and I wanted to be there completely. The figure would not let me pass. I couldn't see his face, but I wasn't afraid. I felt only tremendous love from him. I couldn't hear his words, but I could understand what he was telling me: I wasn't done yet, and I had to go back. I tried to protest. I didn't want to go back. I wanted to go into the rosy light.  
   Probable NDE related to surgery.   

    1792.        Larry NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3817.             I watched myself fall in a kind of slow motion event but I was viewing it from above my opponent's right shoulder, about two or three feet above him. The light that was in the room was different, more luminous but not brighter. The detail of everything around me was incredible. It was like my skin was a sponge, that is to say that I could see in depth I couldn't before. I was completely at peace as I watched this and had no remorse whatsoever.  
   NDE due to head injury during karate sparring.   

    1791.        Diane V Possible NDE       12/15/2008.      Possible NDE 3816.             First, there was a Disney bluebird. (Remember, I was five years old.) Then, there was a blue-eyed blond Midwestern Jesus. There was a life review of the smallest details and lots of guilt. My Sunday school had taught that Jews didn't go to heaven. Even at five, I felt this was wrong and expressed concern. I was told, 'We are all one.' The Jesus figure changed into different races, genders. It was dizzying.  
   Age five. Possible NDE. Past life review. Met Elizabeth. Apparently encountered many past lives. They were putting IV in, which they would not be doing if she were having a life-threatening event, and nurse told her after return that she never left. No cl   

    1790.        Atana NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3814.             I saw myself bathing in bright light. Surrounded by twelve beings in white garments - I was in the middle of the circle. I also saw shadow people in the corner of my back yard - they were told that they cannot come near me because I have done a hundred and eight good things in my life time.  
   NDE due to reaction to insulin with low blood sugar.   

    1789.        Jenna P Probable NDE       12/15/2008.      Probable NDE 3811.             The first thing I recall was floating in darkness. My head and torso were contained in a clear rectangular box, which was filled with a plasma like substance. I was only a torso at this time I had no arms or legs that I could see or feel. I was surrounded by beings who were helping me. I can't describe what the beings looked like. They were just there helping me, taking care of me. I wasn't frightened at all. I felt comfortable and cared for. After I was no longer in the box, I recall just floating. I didn't go anywhere in particular I was just floating in darkness.  
   NDE due to accident followed by drug induced coma.   

    1788.        Vicki P NDE       7/4/2011 & 12/15/2008.      NDE 5261/3810.             I had a severe cold and my mom was 'greasing me up' with Vicks Vaporub.  I began to hear a buzzing sound that grew louder and louder. The next thing I knew, I was going rapidly through a tunnel toward a light.  I saw small, bright orbs of light accompanying me and I said to myself, 'Angels!'  Before I could reach the light, I returned to my body and came to.  My mom was slapping me, crying, and screaming.  I was very angry to find myself back in my body.  I wanted to go on... it was so peaceful and joyful.  
   NDE due to illness at age 8.  Shared 49 years later.   

    1787.        William E Father NDE       12/15/2008.      Secondhand NDE 3809.             He looked around and saw the tunnel with the light, got up and went to it. Everything was so peaceful and he felt so alive. He was met at the light by his father, grandfather, grandmother, and some other old family members but if he told me who, I don't remember. His father said he couldn't come in yet, he still had many important things to do. His father also gave him some messages for his mother and some important legal information she would need. Dad and his father never really got along before and dad was not happy that he couldn't stay. That was uppermost in his mind and it took a while before he even passed on the information to his mother... cousin Dewey said he was very changed. From a hard living cowboy who was ready to 'scrap at the drop of a hat and willing to drop the hat himself' to a calm, friendly person who never had a bad word about anyone and would do anything to help anyone, including his worst enemy, which he claimed he had none.  
   NDE due to typhoid fever. NDEr was the father of the person sharing account. NDE happened in 1919.   

    1786.        Mildred K NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3808.             That's when the emergency medical technician asked the driver what our estimated time of arrival was because he was running out of oxygen. I wanted to cry, but I remembered that my family did not know what had happened to me - and then it happened! Everything was totally black for a minute or so. Then I found myself in the most vibrantly beautiful rose garden that anyone could ever imagine! The foliage was vibrant, glossy green and the rose blossoms were absolutely enormous and so exquisite in both color and fragrance. I was very peaceful in my own mind, not really thinking of anything except the overwhelming peace and glorious beauty of the beautiful, seemingly endless garden of perfection. I was there surrounded by perfection. Then, I heard a noise behind me, a slight rustling. Then I saw my mother, who has been deceased since 1990. There were others with her; my father, deceased in 1960; my sister, deceased in 1980, Others of my family were standing behind mom, dad, and sis. I asked mom if she loved it here, because I sure did.  
   NDE due to illness.   

    1785.        Nancy L Probable NDE       12/15/2008.      Probable NDE 3807.             I did not want to return to my body. I was having the time of my life on the other side. I remember seeing the dark void of space, then seeing the earth, and it was truly brilliant from a distance. Next, I was enveloped in light. Don't remember the tunnel, just dancing light and color. I had small children and a husband but I had not been happy. I remember knowing myself completely, sensing all that was going to happen to me, being shown the future in glimpses. I was told by 'God' who was very present emotionally, but not in a body, that there were many golden opportunities ahead, and this life is a fantastic gift. I remember feeling the love and fulfillment of being with God and I did not want to leave him or this experience.  
   Two experiences with one of them a Probable NDE.   

    1784.        Mark G NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3806.             I moved forward in time and was about twenty feet in the air looking down at the ground. I saw people dressed in black at what looked like a cemetery. Mostly I felt their sadness and at that time, knew it was my funeral that they were at. It was at that point it dawned on me that I was dead but because I felt fine it was not at all distressing to me to know I was dead. After all, when you are dead, there is not much you can do other than see what comes next. The second I realized I was dead and felt their overwhelming sadness my first thoughts were compassion for them, 'Don't feel sad about me. You will all be dead soon enough so live your life and enjoy it.'  
   NDE due to being attacked by a 1,800 pound bull.   

    1783.        Randy P Probable NDE       12/15/2008.      Probable NDE 3805.             I remember walking with Jesus holding his right hand along a path in a 'park' area. Any attempts to describe the beauty of this experience are futile. I remember seeing other 'souls' walking in the area. I told Jesus that I wanted to stay but He said that I had to go back, that there were things I had yet to do. I remember at the end of the experience that I was watching myself hold his hand from a distance in an area that was darker.  
   Probable NDE at time of surgery following accidental valium overdose at age four.   

    1782.        Ted V NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3803.             Then I saw, as in a dream, a copy of the local newspaper's front page. I realized it being held by the neighbor lady across the street from our house. A hand turned the first page and I was drawn to an article in the lower left corner of the next page. The title of the story was 'Young Tucson boy drowns in flooded wash'. As I started to read the article everything went brilliant white and I felt a presence and a hand on my left shoulder. I also remember hearing a faint, gentle voice saying 'It's not your time.'  
   NDE at age twelve due to being washed into culvert during storm. Remarkable future vision of article regarding his own death in newspaper, and inexplicable physical removal from culvert.   

    1781.        Randy S NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3802.             I was pronounced dead to my family when the doctor tried again I started crying... I remember the very bright purple and white lights. I felt that I was leaving home. I wanted to go but then again, I didn't... I went from the light into my body... I was coming from a place where time did not exist.  
   Wow! Apparent NDE at the time of his own birth, due to complications during his own birth.   

    1780.        Stephen F NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3801.             I left my body completely. I rose above it to the point where my thorax was just above my head. I do not know where my legs and feet were. I was able to look down through my head and into the inside of my body. I saw nothing there but blood dripping from the inside of my empty rib cage. I could see the inside of the soles of my feet. There was a bright light above and behind me. I went back into my body and the light went away.  
   NDE due to ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.   

    1779.        Tammie NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3800.             I remember hearing her yelling, and mumbling words. She seemed scared and confused, so I got in the ambulance with her, when I looked at her, her face and head were vibrating really fast, so I held her hand, and she calmed down. I remember getting to the hospital together in the ambulance, we were inseparable best friends I wanting her to be ok. I then woke up on the ground with a Dallas police officer kneeling beside me.  
   NDE due to severe auto accident at age ten. Interesting OBE involving being with her friend who was also injured in the accident.   

    1778.        Keith R NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3799.             The next thing I was aware of, was being above my struggling body and watching it. Then somehow, I was in the presence of sort of a field of love that was totally wonderful. I felt like I was really 'HOME'. There were no beings that I can recall.  There was only peace, love, tranquility, and in at-home-ness feeling. Words cannot truly describe it. Next, I was seeing my mother weeping over my body. Then I woke up on the raft and people were pushing on me. I was angry that I was no longer in the field of love and tranquility.  
   NDE due to drowning at age five. Shared sixty-five years later.   

    1777.        Lacey D NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3798.             I was floating up and away. But not floating like we think of, I was in a warm dark place that felt very awesome and good. It seemed like I was headed towards a place where light was emanating. Not necessarily a light at the end of the tunnel - it seemed I was willfully going towards the warmth and the more I felt it, the more I wanted to go. I realized I must be dying but it felt very good and was what I wanted and nothing else mattered.    
   NDE due to head injury at age sixteen.   

    1776.        Josh W NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3797.             I recall, in some of the most vivid detail, that I was floating above the main ski lodge. It was like being in a helicopter about fifty to seventy feet above the ground.  I was just hovering. There was either no noise or total silence. I remember I could feel the warmth of the sun, but it wasn't the sun it was much brighter and hurt to look directly at. The warmth that it emitted was a 'right' feeling.  The feeling I had was that everything was calm, relaxed and perfect.  
   NDE due to head injury during skiing.   

    1775.        Marie B NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3794.             Instantly, I felt myself rising up into the air and gazing down below at my body. It grossed me out, as I must have been having a seizure. As I was floating above my body, I saw my body contort and my hands were like shaking and wiggling in a spastic way. I immediately felt REVULSION to that body and thought 'how grotesque'. I felt myself going higher up away from my body and I thought to myself, 'Oh no, I don't want to die now - my father and my dog need me.' At that point, I could not feel my body at all - just was viewing it from above. S  
   NDE due to head injury from jumping out a car door.   

    1774.        Jesse M NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3793.             I remember that a great sense of peace came over me. I still don't have the appropriate words to describe it. I didn't go through a tunnel or see a bright light, but I was surrounded by people I knew who had already passed on. Some, I didn't personally know, but I did know who they were. They were telling me how nice it was too see me again, and to finally meet me in person.  
   NDE due to post-operative blood loss.   

    1773.        Dewa NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3792.             Allergy shock and death... I took an herb medicine for my sinus problem but did not know I was allergic to it... I was in a dark room or tunnel and it was so peaceful but really dark. I heard people calling me from far, far away. I did not want to come back for it was a wonderful feeling and I was annoyed and had to come back.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction to herb.   

    1772.        Peggy L NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3791.             I was having spinal surgery. I went through a 'tunnel' that had a very bright white light at the end. As I neared, the light, I could see many people with their arms stretched out beckoning me to come. They appeared as 'grayish' figures, but I could not see their faces. As I got closer, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace beyond any understanding of the word and I wanted to go. Then I heard a male voice that permeated my entire being and it said, 'No! Her children need her.' Then I woke up with my friend shaking me. A couple years passed, and I found out that my husband, her step-father, had been molesting her. That is when I finally understood what that meant. They did need me.  
   NDE due to post-operative complication.   

    1771.        Jo H NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3790.             Two hours later my roommate was screaming for help. I was code blue when they found me. I was purple and not breathing. I was floating in the room, there was a bright light above. But when I looked down, I could see the doctors and nurses working on my chest. As they tried to insert a tube in my mouth, they had to stop to clear away a large blood clot that had formed which cut off my airway. I felt myself being pulled upwards but a voice behind said, 'Joanna it's not your time to go, you still have work to do.'  
   NDE due to post-operative complication at age sixteen.

I didn't have time to feel afraid, annoyed, or any other emotion. All I knew was that I was getting closer to a small speck of light far in the distance. I was not walking; I was just getting to the light, as if something was pulling me. No pain, no fear.  
   NDE at age fourteen due to accident while playing roughly.   

    1768.        Kristin D NDE       12/15/2008.      NDE 3782.             I feel so tacky saying this since it's so stereotypical, but there was always a bright white light, and I'd go to it, and once I got there, and I touched it, everything was beautifully white and scintillating and warm; it smelled sweet and inviting, like cupcakes or warm vanilla sugar, and there were these - the phrase used on the site was 'unearthly beings', and they talked to me.  
   NDEs from age six months through to five years old due to seizures.   

    1767.        Haley L NDE       12/8/2008.      NDE 3778.             I started east down the road, in the direction that would take me home. But I wasn't in my body or a car, I was just gliding down the road. I can't explain how that felt. I was going very fast and since I traveled this road for years I knew all the landmarks and remember passing them.  
   NDE associated with truck accident and blood loss.   

    1766.        Lindsay C NDE       12/8/2008.      NDE 3774.             Clinically at this point I should not remember what happened but I do. I saw it. He waited. He waited until he figured out I didn't just sedate myself. When I stopped breathing, he dragged me to the bathroom. He called 911. My dog barked at him. He waited scared. The paramedics arrived they turned me over, I was not breathing, I did not have a heartbeat. They intubated me. They tried to get veins but they blew. They cut off my sweatshirt then my sweater. They gave an adrenaline injection. All of this was so calm, light, and peaceful. I felt so light, safe, and happy.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt thirty-seven days prior to sharing her experience.

I drifted toward the ceiling, and the monitor line went flat. I saw unearthly beings, but they looked as if they were not trying to hurt me. One minute later, a bright light fell above me. through a pitch-black tunnel, I drifted up to that light. Near one foot before the light "swallowed" me up, I suddenly start to fall back to my body. I call this a strange vision/dream, but it was cool.

    1764.        MHB NDE       12/8/2008.      NDE 3771.       From Canada. Original in French, translated by Amy.      It's simple: When I SAW myself, I was above my body. I knew it was not my time to die. So, I came back into my body. The only other person I saw was an Asian wearing surgery greens.  
   NDE due to infection following surgery.   

    1763.        Lucie C NDE       12/8/2008.      NDE 3768.       From Canada. Original in French, translated by Amy.      After a moment (maybe a few seconds, but they seemed to me like an eternity) I see my body getting up, I no longer have any control over it, while my consciousness attempts in vain to find a solution. My body begins to run in all directions, exits my room, goes into the living room, circles the table and my arms try to grab onto to something, anything, so that I won't faint or die. Then my body (without the control of my brain) instinctively returns to my room and I collapse, overtaken by an enormous fatigue, so tired from having fought so hard. I am still suffocating, but my consciousness distances itself from this suffering and this fight in order to make an assessment of my life. I see images flash very quickly sort of the way dreams work one scene to another without any logical relationship, but here my brain understands because it doesn't have to know all the details in order to understand the relationships, and only a few images are needed.  I relive all the emotions from my childhood at an incredible speed, in about a minute I have completely suffocated. At that point, I realize that I am under the control of a superior being, a divine-like presence has my life in its hands, and therefore I am going to die. I know this and am not afraid.  
   NDE due to reaction to throat spray.   

    1762.        Egyptian Man NDE       12/8/2008.      NDE 3720.       From Egypt.      During sex I felt my heartbeats increase then I lost conscious. I floated into a dark tunnel. I was wearing white clothes. At the end of the tunnel I saw a shining white light. While I was going through the tunnel I could hear nice Japanese music, I had never heard Japanese music before but I was very sure that it was a Japanese music. Before I got to the end of the tunnel my consciousness came back to me, my skin was colored deathful. I was sweltering and I could not raise on my foot, gradually I became normal again.  
   NDE during sex.   

    1761.        NT NDE       12/1/2008.      NDE 3770.             I started to see this green light far off into the distance, and I was curious at first, and a little bit relieved that I could finally see something. Then when the light was coming closer, I got scared of the source of light. I had a vague feeling it was evil. I remember thinking of something like the source of light was Cthulu (even though I am not really a cult follower or anything like that). I fell forward and upright, faster and faster to it, and got more terrified of the green light. Then I started to relax and think maybe whatever or whoever it was had something to tell me. By the time I was close enough to make out that the green light was an orb, covered with appendages of some kind, I was anxious to see more of what it looked like. Then suddenly I woke up, and my boyfriend was slapping my face and shaking me. He said I was out for just a few seconds, but I felt I just woke up from a twenty minute dream.  
   NDE due to accident asphyxiation during sex.   

    1760.        Alan F Possible NDE       12/1/2008.      Possible NDE 3769.       From Thailand      In the next instance, I passed into the intense light of Heaven, no sun or moon, no gravity or air, but the brilliance of the place emanates from the things themselves and is composed of the non-material 'substance' of God's spirit, intense, beautiful, glorious. I then found myself moving rapidly far above the 'ground,' and then saw a beautiful ribbon of blue in the distance, which soon became a very broad, glassy surfaced river as I first turned and hovered over it, at which point it 'spoke' in the same way, out of the life that was within it, 'River of Life.'  
   Sick with mercury poisoning. No clear imminent life-threatening event. Met Jesus who described self as 'Union of All Things'. Beautiful landscape.   

    1759.        Cam Possible NDE vs Drug Experience       12/1/2008.      Possible NDE vs Drug Experience 3765.       From New Zealand.      First came absolute darkness, then a bright orb of light. The light was more than light; it had a hexagonal tessellation of radiant yellow/orange, but mostly white. There it stood, an oval of light, then a line came out from the orb, and it went to the right and up, and then began forming a spiral. Then the line stopped just above it. I was told through the vision and somehow telepathic I understood, this is life. Life begins and life stops, and then begins again. The rebirth. The line began again, with a small gap in the spiral, and again, the spiral began, and stopped. This happened seven more times with gaps between each one, then the last line faded.  
   Experience at age sixteen due to 'huffing'. Very influential on his beliefs.   

    1758.        Auriel P Probable NDE       12/1/2008.      Probable NDE 3764.             As I walked out into the hallway, I felt an unbelievable warmth. The best way I can describe it is if you put a big soft fuzzy blanket in the dryer and then wrapped it around your bare skin. The warmth enveloped me and it smelled like a spring day. Then to my left the hallway grew intensely bright. It blocked everything else out and I turned toward it and began to walk. I saw myself from behind. I was dressed in a hospital gown, short sleeved and hanging to mid-calf. Although I had lost most of my hair due to the illness, my hair was now long, thick and hanging almost to my waist. The draw toward the light was irresistible.  
   Probable NDE due to severe illness.   

    1757.        Carry G Prayer NDE-Like       12/1/2008.      NDE-Like 3763.             When the being of light first said this, I felt like the most loved human being of all time, the most favorite of all human beings in the universe, past, present or future, yet at the same time I knew this being loved everyone equally and just as infinitely as I felt right then. The being delighted in me and was completely focused on me. I was the center of its attention yet somehow I knew everyone was at the 'center' of its attention. When the being said those words to me, I knew it saw me as I was, faults and all, not just at that moment, but for all the moments of my life. I felt no shame, no judgment; in fact, it was so liberating to be known so perfectly, to be so wonderfully accepted, yet at the same time, not judged or condemned in the slightest way.  
   Remarkably transcendent prayer experience with many similarities to NDE. This experience led him to become a Catholic priest.   

    1756.        Nick F NDE       12/1/2008.      NDE 3762.             In 1976, I drove from Missouri where I taught 7th Grade Boy's Health Science for a night of moderate celebration. I remember nothing else until I woke up.  I woke up. Didn't know where I was - nothing new there. Pretty soon, I saw a suit walking around. 'Sir, can you tell me where I am?' 'Mr. F, you've been in a serious automobile accident... My vision had the impossibly bright light, looking at my body from outside and incredible love.  
   NDE due to auto accident with skull fracture.   

    1754.         Alan Mc NDE       11/28/2008 & 12/17/2008.      NDE 3760/16041.       From South Africa.      There is a beautiful balance to existence, while the dark void is awful, the domain of the light is so peaceful, loving, glorious even blissful that I cannot really find adequate words in the English language to describe it. Therefore, we all have varying degrees of light in us that will allow us into the glorious light of the almighty. We meet an essence of God in the light end of the tunnel, at the end of our earthly life. God can work with the light in us, make us pure and allow us to progress up the various levels of heaven into his eternal blissful presence of everlasting peace and joy! It is a progress of eternal learning. Then we become one with God, but retain our unique self-awareness or our unique personalities are retained forever.  
   NDE due to coma from illness.  Markedly transcendent experience.   

    1753.        Allen T NDE       11/28/2008.      NDE 3759.       From the UK.      I was somewhere else - firstly, it was very dark and then I felt as if I was traveling at speeds as if being on a magic carpet, traveling to different places at speeds, which don't exist on earth. After a while, I went into a tunnel, which eventually became brighter and brighter - absolutely unbelievable. When I stopped moving/travelling I was greeted by voices/people that I don't remember (and still don't) but where I was felt absolutely peaceful, loving, welcoming and real.  
   NDE due to unknown causes with associated unconsciousness.   

    1752.        Frances H NDE       11/28/2008.      NDE 3757.             Then all of I sudden, it was like I 'popped' up and out of my body and my next thought was 'I'm not dead I'm alive, more alive than I had ever felt before!' I did not look back at my body or the beach. I did not travel through a tunnel. My spirit went straight to the Light. There were people in the Light. The Light and all the people in it were full of love and understanding. I was in a place where I wanted to stay.  
   NDE from drowning at age seven.   

    1751.        Mary NDE       11/17/2008.      NDE 3731.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon.      One, I am without pain. Two, I am hearing with an echo. Three, I feel I'm in a tunnel. Wow!!!! It looks like I'm dying!!!! I started to notice that I was getting further from the end of the tunnel, very slowly. I was very scared and got extremely nervous, saying to myself: 'Wake up, wake up, wake up' and trying to turn round and move so that I would not get any further away. At that point I noticed I was leaving the tunnel at great speed, recovering all of a sudden and completely my vital functions, sight, hearing, touch, etc.  
   NDE from loss of blood due to surgery complications.   

    1750.        Kendra NDE       11/16/2008.      NDE 3755.             I was surrounded by a warm, white light.  I traveled upwards and felt safe.  I felt such love, more than I've ever felt before.  I felt myself trying to get to the end faster. At the end of the light, I saw a beautiful golden gate with three figures. My mother, my grandfather whom I never knew but at that moment I felt like I had known him all my life, and a man dressed in white robes and medium brown hair radiating love in waves. For the first time in a long time, I felt accepted and at home and I didn't want to leave. My mother and grandfather told me to go back that I didn't belong here yet. I shook my head. I didn't want to leave the peace I felt there.  
   NDE due to seizure.   

    1749.        Marlin C NDE       11/16/2008 & 8/20/2011.      NDE 3754/5329.             As soon as I died I was standing in total darkness, and right in front of me was the brightest light you had ever seen in your life but it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  Then this voice came from the light saying to me 'step into the light, step into the light.'  At first, I was scared because I had never been in a situation like that before.  After the voice repeated the saying again, I stepped into the light.  When I did it hit me like a ton of bricks!!!  The first thing I felt was overwhelming LOVE!!! The next thing I felt was true peace and contentment, it seemed like I was home!  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    1748.        Jen C NDE       11/16/2008.      NDE 3752.             I lay there staring at the ceiling when I stopped breathing. I then felt myself being pulled up out of my body and out of the hospital into this vast void that was both dark and light. It was silent and still, strange but peaceful. Then I felt myself yanked down and I was back in my body with two nurses looking over me.  
   NDE due to breathing cessation from medication.   

    1747.        Brian G NDE       11/16/2008.      NDE 3751.             What I remember is a person asking me (I can't recall seeing a face but I think it was a male) if I wanted to stay or come (with him). I knew exactly what he meant and why he was asking me. I was even looking at myself lying unconscious on either a stretcher or bed. I responded to him that I wanted to stay because my wife and children needed me. He let me know that my decision would be supported (strong sense of compassion), and that though it would be difficult, in the end everything would be okay. Also, there was a very strong sense of peace.  
   NDE due to head injury from car accident. Interesting to note the unique NDE state of consciousness during amnesic period.   

    1746.        Audie M NDE       11/16/2008.      NDE 3750.       From Australia.      I went above my body and could see through the walls. I was in the hospital at the time, and could see the nurses in their canteen. They were saying how sick I was and were eating my pears, as I would not need them. I love pears, and my mother could not normally afford them, but had bought them for a special treat. I then went to my home and saw my mother and father getting ready to come to the hospital to see me. I tried to tell them about the pears, but they couldn't see me. I recall feeling very peaceful and quite interested in everything that was going on around my earthly body, but enjoyed floating and being able to go where I wished. I didn't want to go back into my body.  
   NDE due to scarlet fever at age twelve. Experience is shared forty-eight years later.   

    1745.        Tina R NDE       11/16/2008.      NDE 3746.       From Canada.      I was standing upright, but not on the ground, it was as if I was floating in a very silent, peaceful space. There was an oval shape of a cloud-like image surrounded in light that became larger and larger in size. I heard a voice saying; 'Tina, it is not your time yet, so don't worry or panic.' The voice repeated this statement two or three times and then told me to relax, calm my body and concentrate on opening my eyes. I then remember thinking (knowing) that it was my angel speaking and comforting me. I felt an extreme sense of peace and stillness. During the second experience I also remember thinking that it was really unfortunate that my life was over but if I were to go I wouldn't be alone and that I would be with my mom. But the voice answered my thought with words of comfort and peacefully suggested that it was not my time to go.  
   NDE due to complications of infection.   

    1744.        Kristy C NDE       11/16/2008.      NDE 3745.             I remember being pulled backwards and when I turned I was in an earthy tunnel and a door was before me that opened into a spectacular light. The light was brilliant, but it did not hurt! As I passed into it, it glowed with warmth, love, knowledge, and understanding. Not just my own knowledge, but knowledge of everything.  I had complete understanding, collective but separate. Everything made sense. Everything was more vivid, the colors were brighter and deeper, everything was tranquil and at peace the moment I crossed into the light. I was now standing in a lush rolling meadow, covered with blooms and trees. I felt a presence strong and even more wonderful; I knew my family was with me. The presence had a deep resonating voice that touched the core of your soul. I don't remember what the voice told me, but the peace and calm seemed to magnify. I remember sitting in the meadow, I was cradling something in my arms, asking to cross a small free flowing stream, and not being allowed, I asked to stay. I did not want to go back.  
   NDE due to complications during gallbladder surgery. Interesting in that she had awakened during surgery, then cardiac arrest, then NDE.   

    1743.        Gordy K NDE       11/16/2008.      NDE 3744.             I was fully aware that was my body on the gurney; however, there was a 'lack of concern' on my part (not to mention a total lack of the pain and discomfort I was in before I began my experience) and soon lost interest on what was happening to my body. I looked around behind me, saw the cupboards on the wall, and read some of the labels on the doors describing the contents behind the doors. They were Dymo-labels popular back then. The cupboards and room dissolved away to blackness with a bright light in what would have been the corner in the back of the cupboard.  
   NDE due to unspecified illness.   

    1742.        Ruben G NDE       11/15/2008.      NDE 3741.       From Mexico. Original in Spanish, translated by Simon.      In my instinct for survival I was climbing on his back to breathe, and he was doing the same thing. Exhausted from all my efforts to get out, I gave up and was swallowing water, when suddenly I saw something like a video of my life, every moment was seen. Just then, it was a wonderful thing, and after seeing this video I regained consciousness.  
   Child near-drowning.   

    1741.        MB NDE       11/13/2008.      NDE 3743.       From Brazil. Original in Portuguese, translated by Rio.      Afterwards, the tunnel turned a light yellow and I saw a female 'being' appear in order to accompany me. We finally arrived at a light and then a room appeared - sort of a control room - where there were people behind one-way mirrors. I heard someone say that I had arrived at a parallel universe at a HIGHER LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS where it was possible to see other people living normally upon the earth. That was a great revelation. The secret to the universe was presented to me. The secret is that there is another world where things really are real, where truth, goodness and harmony exist. Life is not limited to the earth experience. Earth life is only a small part of the whole. Those who earn the right are shown eternal life. That was the essence.  
   Childbirth NDE.   

    1740.        Benino NDE       11/10/2008.      NDE 3749.       From Italy. Original in Italian, translated by Amy.      After an indefinable moment of time, I found myself outside of my body, and I saw my body lying on the bed. I rose in the air always keeping my eye on my body. Then everything turned black.  I found myself in a tunnel. The sides of the tunnel were brown, grey and black and the colors were all mixed up together. I didn't perceive sound, heat, hunger, feelings, weight, memories, anxiety, and emotions. I was all sight. The time I remained in the tunnel is hard to say, but it seemed like several weeks.  At the end of the tunnel, there was a small light.  
   NDE at age four. Atypical because he is now atheist (not because of the NDE) and considers the NDE as a hallucination.   

    1739.        John S NDE and Possible NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3742.             I was there for five minutes or so. It was the most at peace I ever felt. Who would think drowning would not be traumatic, at least in my experience. I was out of my body. I guess it was weird. I saw myself through the murky water. It's hard to explain, but my mind was just floating around with no body. I saw a very bright white light that started to expand very rapidly.  
   NDE at age ten from near drowning, and possible NDE at age forty-one from suicide attempt.   

    1738.        Jackie R NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3740.       From Australia.      I remember walking into a grey zone, another plane that was like a duplicate of this Earth. I wondered were my friend.  Although I couldn't see him I knew he definitely was not on this plane - it was just a knowing from somewhere I can't explain. I felt lost and confused it was hazy and I was walking through bush, trees - just wandering. It was misty grey, foggy almost. I was not afraid but neither joyful, just confused and dreamy. All of a sudden, a firm father like voice told me 'You must go back, you cannot stay here!'  
   NDE due to car crash.   

    1737.        Jessica P NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3739.             Before I came to those several days later it was almost as if the wreck would keep re-playing in my mind. I could see myself sitting in the truck, but from above. And very close as if I was sitting right on top of the roof with the top pealed back. It was as if that one little area where I had been covered with a bright white light that was clouds or fog around me, but I could still see myself clearly  
   NDE due to car accident.   

    1736.        Shirley R NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3737.             Standing at the light, that is not really a light like we know on earth, I felt I finally was home after a long, long journey. Every question I ever wanted to know about the universe and life was answered at that moment and not a word was spoken, but I could feel the information enter my soul. There were silhouettes of women and men and children floating up at an angle through a fog like light. All were looking up at an angle and I was watching them and waiting for what seemed like my turn. I was filled with happiness, safety, and love, everything we the people look for and seek out here on earth. I still cry to go home into the light, I do not want to be here on earth anymore, but know that I have no choice not even suicide.  
   NDE due to post-operative complication.   

    1735.        Abraham B Probable NDE       11/1/2008.      Probable NDE 3736.             At one point within seconds something inside me from my belly separated and departed at a great speed and went to a black tunnel. At the end, the part was engulf in an extremely bright white light. It was the most peaceful quiet and happy experience of my life.  
   This is one of the few Jewish experiences that we have received.   

    1734.        Cathleen C NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3735.             I knew that He had the answers to all questions so I began to ask Him things I had wondered about the most. Why is there evil? His reply, 'Because there is good.' I asked how anyone, being what they are, be permitted to exist in this home of God. He made me understand that He knew everything about me, that I was who I was because He Himself had designed me to be exactly, precisely who I was and that whatever I was I was still His creation, His child and He loved me so very much.  
   Remarkable NDE due to criminal attack involving strychnine poisoning. Initial part of NDE in hellish realm. Exceptional spiritual wisdom.   

    1733.        Mark T NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3733.       From the UK.      Suddenly everything went white. There wasn't a tunnel, music, or anything like that, just a blanket of white light. The white light was as if you were to look directly at the sun. I felt as if I was gently laid down on the seabed. Then I felt surrounded in an invisible cloak of safety and serenity. It was the most peaceful feeling I had ever, and have had to this day, felt. I knew I was safe. Then I felt a horrible jolt as someone grabbed my arm. All of a sudden, the water felt extremely cold and I started to feel the same original panic as I felt the cloak slipping off me. A woman pulled me out of the water and I started breathing again. I was really annoyed at the woman, as if she had just woken me from a peaceful sleep - only ten times worse.  
   NDE at age sixteen due to drowning.   

    1732.        Cathy B NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3732.       From Canada.      I felt my body shutting down and then I had a flash of my entire life including pre-birth. Then I was up and looking down at my back and I wasn't scared I just kept thinking that any minute he'd go away and then I'll start to breathe again. I was okay with my body dying. Then I remember looking up and being pulled/sucked toward a great white light. When I got closer to the light, I saw the outline of adults. I was only there for a moment before I was sucked back and then I was breathing again.  
   NDE due to criminal attack at age seven.   

    1731.        Richard H NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 3730.             Overall, it was an incredible, transformational, inspirational, spiritual experience resulting in a quickening of my awareness/consciousness, a loss of fear, a loss of the fear of death, a strong sense of greater meaning, remarkable insight into the human condition and the dire importance of relationships, an unshakable conviction that there is nothing to fear concerning death or the afterlife, a strengthening of my intuitive abilities and a profound sense of inner peace, all of which led to a greater appreciation of life, and a sincere desire to live my life to the fullest, and the conviction I should do something constructive with my second chance. And more!  
   NDE due to heart attack.  Markedly life-changing.   

    1730.        Ashley G FDE       9/29/2008.      FDE 21909.             We were coming down a hill and at the bottom of the hill was a semi sharp turn to the right. Mikey was driving about sixty-five miles per hour, and I told him to slow down but he didn't. We reached the bottom of the hill and right before the curve, I remember there was an old run down barn to the right. Then when he went to go around the curve, he lost control of the car. I felt like I was standing outside the car on the side of the road in the right in front of the barn. The car seemed to be a hundred feet away. I could see the red car, I could see us in the car, I could see the car spinning and sliding across the wet pavement, and I could see the other cars and their headlights coming from the other way. I kept thinking that they were going to hit the car. It all seemed like it was in slow motion, but I was in normal motion. As soon and the car stopped I was back in the car just sitting there wondering what had just happened. The car never rolled or hit anything. It just spun around a couple of times.  
   Fear-death experience due to near crash in car.   

    1729.        George L NDE       9/29/2009.      NDE 21905.             My soul or spirit left my body at that moment and I went somewhere I don't recall.  Then I was floating with my hand on my mom and dad's shoulders as they were walking down the hallway in the hospital.  My spirit went to the operating room where I was looking down at my body with all the doctors and tubes and stuff sticking out of me.  Only my face was peeking through the ceiling tiles. I was in the ceiling, feeling like my feet and legs wanted to float upwards.  Then I was instantly at the head of my surgery table.  I was still looking through the ceiling tiles when I saw this white shape at the foot of the surgery table.  It was shaped a lot like me. Size, slender, height, everything. Anyway, it slowly laid into my body and worked its way from my feet until it finally disappeared into my face and that's when I came back to life.  
   NDE due to being shot.   

    1728.        Nadera S Probable NDE       10/19/2008.      Probable NDE 3703.       From Iraq. Original in Arabic, Non-Western NDE      I saw four people, three men and a woman, one of the men was in white uniform and I knew the woman according to her clothes. They put me on a litter (ambulance litter) and they pushed it running through a passage for hours, then we arrived to the end of the way. I saw a light. I told them this is was my first time to get a breathing failure and you didn't take me younger brother in spite of that he is an asthma case for fourteen years, so please let me go back.  
   NDE by Professor.   

    1727.        Jay MD Patient NDE       10/19/2008.      Secondhand NDE 3728.             After twenty-eight shocks (I think), I got her back. She was technically without a cardiac rhythm of her own for an hour and a half. We took her to the intensive care unit. The family was flabbergasted. They'd thought I had 'done something' to kill her. The staff, and anesthesiologist told the family (more bluntly than I would have) that, 'The only reason your mother is alive is because of Dr. Jay, He refused to give up when everybody else told him to. He's why she's alive.'  That night, Dr. Scott and I, went to the intensive care unit and asked this elderly lady if she 'remembered anything.' 'Yes,' she said, 'I was in the corner of the room - floating - and saw you working on me. You shocked me and I was dead. I saw a massively white bright light and there were two angels there - telling me it wasn't my time and to go back. But I didn't want to.'  
   Remarkable account from a surgeon who resuscitated a patient who had coded due to heart electrical abnormality while undergoing surgery. The patient told a classic NDE, and then denied having had the experience later. To the best of our recollection, this   

    1726.        Frank A NDE       9/29/2008.      NDE 21901.       Non-Western NDE from Ghana Africa      I was in second grade at the time. As children played in our classroom, we formed a circle and started doing circular movements. As we moved in the circular orbit, either my hand or the hand holding mine let loose and I hit my head on the wall of the classroom. The next thing I knew, I had my experience.  I saw myself floating over my body in some whining noise. As I hung over my body I could see all my classmates clattering and chatting in a noisy manner. At the classroom entrance, children and other people came and went. As people came closer to my body, my floating image went back and forth and I could clearly see my body lying on the ground with my hands holding my head. The noise I hear in the classroom was clear.  
   NDE due to head trauma at age 8.  NDE happened in Ghana in West Africa, making it a relatively rare   

    1725.        Jason B NDE       10/19/2008.      NDE 3727.             Soon after this, I had the out of body experience.  It was as if I was standing over myself in a crowd of onlookers. I watched the paramedics arrive as they began CPR. I then saw things from the ground again after what seemed like minutes. I closed my eyes, and that is when I began feeling relaxed. I could see very bright light, and everything was very silent. I could not hear any voices or noise from the street, but just still quiet.  
   NDE due to auto accident at age seventeen.   

    1724.        Granit N NDE       10/19/2008.      NDE 3707.       From the Netherlands. Original in Dutch, translated to English by Annelies.      I was in a rotating tunnel (a kind of cloud) and inside the tunnel there were billions of small lights. I looked around, I was surprised and had no idea what was happening. I heard beautiful music that resembled classical music. I remember (like it happened yesterday) the feeling I had: peaceful, quiet, without worries. At the end of the tunnel was a large light, which looked like the sun, but this light I could look into. I remember saying (telepathic words not by word of mouth): 'Wow it is beautiful here. Where am I?' Suddenly with the speed of lightning I was back in my body.  
   NDE from an eight year old playing with firecrackers.   

    1723.        Michel vd B NDE       10/19/2008.      NDE 3673.       From the Netherlands. Original in Dutch, translated to English by Annelies.      At the same time I see my friends (five kilometers further on) getting in their car, they are saying: Michel is late maybe he's not coming. I say right away, 'Hey, I'm lying over here.' But they don't hear or see me. Suddenly, I see them coming from the opposite direction my head is. I wave to them, they stop, and then they say, 'Shit! That's Michel's car.'  I say, 'Yes, don't you see I've been in an accident?'  
   NDE from car accident.   

    1722.        Yulia Possible NDE       10/18/2008.      Possible NDE 3702.       From Russia. Original in Russian, translated to English by Sergey.      I flew through the funnel along a spiral at a great speed, very loud noise in my ears, like a very strong wind. On the walls of the funnel, not sure how they were attached, there were some unusual objects; at that moment I knew what they were, but forgot later, I have a vague feeling that they were toys. While flying, I heard voices talking to me. They were a bit with an echo, with unusual timbre, I think now that they were muffled as by cotton. Then I clearly understood what they were telling me and knew that they belong to three apostles, but when I returned, I forgot what they were saying. Being in the 'funnel', I felt happy, free, joyfully amazed like a child. I had a feeling, that in my earthly life I saw everything through a very dusty glass.  
   Even though there is a question as to whether she was unconscious during the experience, this is definitely NDE-Like.   

    1721.        Agnes O NDE       10/12/2008.      NDE 3726.       from Canada      It felt like my chest is going to explode and then it all stopped. It got quiet and peaceful. I saw my hands floating in front of my face. I remember looking at them with no emotion. I could see the sunrays cutting through the water, shining on the rocks, and thought how beautiful they were. I saw the weeds floating around me; I saw parts of my life in front of my eyes. But the most important was the PEACE that I felt. I felt light and peaceful like nothing else mattered.  
   NDE due to drowning at age fifteen.   

    1720.        Hazeliene M NDE       10/12/2008.      NDE 3725.       From Singapore      I suddenly I was in the very dark tunnel going up up up and way up there (above). Then after that, it was very dark place and I know that place was a tunnel. After passing through from that very dark tunnel, it has changed to very bright light. I had seen a very bright light, I thought it was sun, but it was not. I don't' have an idea where's that light came from. Someone spoken to me for a while, I heard and that voice came from that light.  
   NDE at time of unconsciousness due to apparent illness.   

    1719.        Nina S Probable NDE       10/12/2008.      Probable NDE 3724.       From the UK      During my operation I found myself standing on the apex of a bend in a tunnel.  The tunnel was metallic and coming from one end out of the dark I was watching what looked like meat hooks hanging from a moving conveyor moving slowly towards me.  There were gnarled, twisted, burnt looking bodies hanging fr0m the hooks, which gradually moved towards the bend and me.  As I looked to the other end of the tunnel, I could see an incredibly white light - so bright that it seemed to reflect from the metallic tunnel.  
   Probable NDE during surgery for a skull fracture.   

    1718.        Marilyn M Probable NDE       10/12/2008.      Probable NDE 3723.             I woke up in the car, my sister was moaning, I told her to be quiet and that everything would be ok. I blacked out and came to in the ambulance, felt like I was lying on a pile of bricks. I begged my dad who was in the ambulance with me to tell me where my mom was. I blacked out again. Woke up again in the emergency room hearing blood curdling screaming. I blacked out again and woke up going into surgery hearing a nurse say she doesn't have much hair so we don't have to shave her. My out of body experience was sometime during surgery I think. I was hovering over myself and saw five other people around me in white coats. They were just standing there. The light was behind me and I did not look into it. I felt very peaceful and secure in where I was. The next thing I remember was that I came to in a hospital room with my dad looking at me and he still would not say where my mother was.  
   Probable NDE during urgent surgery following car accident.   

    1717.        Marney S Daughter NDE       10/12/2008.      Secondhand NDE 3721.             A few months after being released from the hospital, she told our 12 year-old daughter, 'I'm all better now.'  Our older daughter responded with, 'You are?  How do you know that?'  Our 2 year-old said, 'God told me.'  A few weeks later, we were sitting around the campfire as a family roasting marshmallows when our daughter told us, 'God came to see me when I was at the hospital.  He carried me up to the sky when the doctors were putting something on me.  He told me I was all better now and took me back to the hospital.'  
   NDE at age 2 shared by parents when she is age 5.  NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    1716.        Mary R NDE       9/28/2008.      NDE 21892.             Then there was a very small moment of total darkness and then I found myself walking upward through an old stone and earth tunnel that had a bright white light at the end.  Before I got to the light, the stones and earth turned into the heavens with all of the stars.  I instantly knew all of their names and purpose and they seemed as though they were living beings with a reason for being created.  One in particular I was told was my birth star.  Everything was within a heart beat yet seemed as if time had stopped.  You knew things all at once yet separate as well.  There was an angel walking on my right side with me the entire way and I was told he was my guardian angel.  I saw my entire life as though I was watching a movie.  There was an invisible border you could not see yet you understood not to cross it or you could not leave. Horses and dogs were playing together and when they stopped, they seemed to stare a hole through me and then went back to playing.  I was told they were checking to see if I was the person they were waiting for that they had loved while on earth.  
   NDE due to severe head injury from criminal attack.   

    1715.        Anitta J NDE       10/4/2008.      NDE 3716.       From Finland.      I saw an enormous light at the end of the tunnel and I was going to it. My previous life went through like a film. Then I felt that somebody, whose face I did not see, took me on the arms and I felt very peaceful. There was no fear or pain, just happy and restful feeling. Then I saw my father, just like he was when he lived and he said to me, 'Come here, here is good to be.' I wanted to run to him, but I could not, because there was a border between us. I cannot describe the border it was like a wall, which I could see through.  
   NDE at age fourteen due to heart attack secondary to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (an abnormality of electrical conduction of the heart).   

    1714.        Thaddeus K NDE       10/4/2008.      NDE 3715.             Suddenly, I am looking down at myself from the ceiling. My position is reversed so that my head is opposite to my feet on the bed. I see myself very clearly.  I have normal vision. Then, I am presented with making a decision, although I heard no voice.  I just had 'knowledge' that I have a choice. The choice is stay or go.  There is absolutely no value to either choice, which surprises me. Then I feel a sense of absolute calm. I choose 'stay'.  Immediately I am back in my body.  
   NDE due to gram negative bacteria septic shock. NDEr is a retired physician who is sharing this fifty-two years later.   

    1713.        Armandina G NDE       10/4/2008.      NDE 3714.             All of a sudden, I was somehow normal and not drunk. I don't know if I was sitting, standing, or lying there.  But I clearly realized someone (I don't really know if it was a person or a ghost, as I was looking forward at a slight right angle) in a slow, gentle, commanding voice asking 'Do you want to come (as if to sway his hand/palm open from forward to back) or do you want to stay (as if now motioning his hand from the position in back to where it started with hand and palm open)?’  
   NDE due to alcohol overdose.   

    1712.        Shirley R NDE       10/14/2008.      NDE 3713.       From the United Kingdom      Lying in a bed I had pancreatitis and didn't know if I was going to live or die. Seen a black tunnel, it was swirling, and my daughter and my mother were at the end of this tunnel. They were calling me but my godmother who is my grandmother told me to go back. Soon I started to get well again. I have seen a similar thing in my bedroom and it is frightening. I am afraid to go through that tunnel.  
   NDE while in intensive care due to pancreatitis.   

    1711.        John S Probable NDE       10/4/2008.      Probable NDE 3718.             Next thing I remember, I was looking down at myself sitting on the bench of the emergency room.  The girl who brought me over was seated next to me.  A doctor was kneeling in front of the "me" on the bench, moving my mouth around.  He said the jaw was broken clear through.  I later found out the left side was also broken in pieces.  As I looked down, I was aware of an endless continuum behind me, but I did not turn around.  Indescribable, all-encompassing Love surrounded everything.  It was perfect peace and well-being beyond imagination. There was someone or something that communicated telepathically with me.  It's hard to explain the feeling of intimacy, care and connection I felt with it.  We were almost one. But what was behind me was so much greater than me.  Looking down at me on the bench, we felt such compassion for the poor guy.  He didn't know that he was surrounded by Love.  
   Probable NDE after jaw fracture.   

    1710.        Belen NDE       10/3/2008.      NDE 3647.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Amy.      When I was three years old I was involved in a car accident, as I was getting out of my father's car I fell onto the asphalt. I became unconscious, and they declared me clinically dead. I remember that in that moment I found myself alone in a kind of forest with really tall trees and a lot of light, probably sunlight. I was walking quietly through the greenery and I felt so much at peace, I don't know if it was a dream or just a state of unconsciousness. The peace I felt was indescribable, I remember it as though it happened yesterday.  
   NDE that occurred when she was three years old.   

    1709.        Pia H Probable NDE       10/1/2008.      Probable NDE 3651.       From Belgium. Original in Dutch, translated to English by Garry.      Suddenly I'm without a body and am overcome by a feeling of wellbeing; I know everything and yet nothing. This is it: death = life; LOVE! It is impossible for me to describe the feeling. I felt myself so connected to everything; it was so heavenly and easy! I didn't have to breathe; I didn't have to do anything, only BE! This wonderful feeling was so overwhelming I was almost glad to be dead; it will be heavenly at life's end.  
   Probable NDE from allergic reaction to anesthesia.   

    1708.        Stella NDE       10/1/2008.      NDE 3697.       From Italy. Original in Italian, translated to English by Amy.      The tunnel was semi-transparent and I saw points of light like distant stars becoming rays of irregular lights, like the headlights on a car that is speeding down a curved road. My speed kept growing until the light could no longer reach me and I saw that the tunnel was one giant curve, but a curve that was barely discernible, yet I could feel it. Then I was home. The light surrounded me and I was in eternity, every question I asked had an instant clear response, even if I didn't understand every answer. The gentle song of many voices surrounded me but I couldn't understand the song. I walked barefoot in an undulating field on soft grass and not far away an oak tree stood out. It was more imposing than anything I had ever seen, a brilliant green like life. (I could write a whole book about that tree alone but I will stop here.)  
   Four years old. Exceptional NDE. OBE - saw nurse lose ring and told her where to find it. Remarkably transcendent. Profound insights on life's purpose and free will.   

    1707.        Newlin D NDE       9/29/2008.      NDE 3710.       From India      As I was being electrocuted I left my body and floated above the scene. I was surrounded by a warm diffuse light but could see everything clearly. I could see my body shaking and convulsing with the electrical current, my eyes were open, my mouth was open but I couldn't speak. I seemed to know that I was going to die unless something changed. I don't remember being scared or frightened at all - very matter-of-factly. While floating I went over to where my dad was working at the other end of the garage. He had his back to my body and wasn't aware of what was going on. I went over to him and then he looked up from his work on the floor, turned to see my body being electrocuted.  
   NDE due to electrocution at age eleven.   

    1706.        Fanny B Probable NDE       9/29/2008.      Probable NDE 3711.       From Switzerland      I felt my soul (I don't know what word I can use for this) just rising up from my body, horizontally, or from the belly, something like that. Then, it's just like most people's feeling, so peaceful, so grateful and my body or my soul had no weight at all. I was in the middle of nowhere, I could see all around me in the same time, 360 degrees. The whole room was lit by a kind of light bright but not hurting, there was no corner, no shadow, and the light seems to be peace, happiness and so on.  
   Probable NDE three days after surgery.   

    1705.        Flannigan D Probable NDE       9/29/2008.      Probable NDE 3708.             As I floated up there, I was watching my body lying on the table with the doctor and nurse leaning over me. I could see the clothes I was wearing, my short-sleeve blue, red, and white shirt, which my grandma made for me and two like them for my brothers. I also had on some blue jeans and my black shoes. My shirt was partially covered with a white towel. As I watched from above, I became aware of a smell (like lilacs) which reminded me of my Grandma (my mother's mom) who had died in a car accident just two years before that.  
   Probable NDE at age eight during surgery. Shared fifty-three years later. He is a minister.   

    1704.        Newie NDE       9/29/2008.      NDE 3706.             I found myself in a sort of courtyard. There were no flowers, but the grass, bushes, and tree leaves were an extraordinarily vibrant green. Over the horizon was white and gold light. I knew I was in the presence of something sacred - not God as commonly described - and I experienced true awe for the first time. I was not afraid. There was an invisible barrier separating the courtyard from the light and the landscape beyond, and I was scrambling around, trying to find a way through. I heard a female voice say, 'It's not your time yet.' I replied, 'I've had a stroke and my left side is paralyzed. What better time could there be?' But they wouldn't let me in. I'm not sure who 'they' are, but I was devastated when I realized I was being dragged back to my ruined body.  
   NDE due to stroke.   

    1703.        Russell P NDE       9/29/2008.      NDE 3705.             I felt my breathing slowing, and then stopping. Then I was engulfed in light and there was a place - a completely black place I couldn't see through or break through. The light was warm and inviting and I felt like I was a kid in my grandmother's arms - the only safe place in the world. I felt myself losing everything then I heard a woman's voice scream 'NO it is not yet his time!' I awoke and was in an emergency room with the taste of charcoal in my mouth and mad as hell.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    1702.        Don R NDE       9/28/2008.      NDE 21883.             Apparently, the split second that my head hit the windshield and I started yelling, I had an out of body experience. I felt myself hovering above my body about ten feet up.  I remember a white light but I think that was from the black jack.  But I do remember that God spoke to me and said to come with Him.  I said, ‘No, I want to marry and have a son and daughter.’ I put that wish in the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem nine years later.  I have been happily married for twenty-one years with a daughter and son. I also remember Him telling me to walk to Port Arthur, Texas (my hometown) and don't look back. That's it.  I had a mild concussion and burst some blood vessels in my arm. I recovered.  
   NDE due to head injury.   

    1701.        Leonard S NDE       9/19/2008.      NDE 21878.             I only remember that when we were at the hospital Emergency room, I was floating above my body.  My body was on a stretcher or gurney and my mom was next to me crying.  I remember seeing someone come up and feel my arm for a pulse (I assume) and turning to my mother and shaking his head.  The next thing I saw was another individual being talked to by the first one and that individual checking on me.  He said something to my mother and then I was wheeled into a treatment area.  This is all I saw. I awakened a day or so later.  
   NDE due to being hit on back of head with baseball bat at age 12.   

    1700.        John P Probable NDE       8/30/2008.      Probable NDE 21877.             Once I got to the hospital I was placed in a metal tub with ice and some type of solution. My clothes were burnt to my skin and I could still fill the electricity going through my body. The pain was so great that I asked God to come and get me and relieve me from the pain. It was terrible. Then I began to rise up out of my body as a spirit. I could see over the top of my body and see all the doctors in the room looking at my lifeless body. I also saw my mother come into the hospital room screaming and crying. She was a nurse at the hospital at that time. Then something or someone, I think it was God, said come into the light and my spirit began to lift higher into a place of white lights with bluish color surrounding. It was very cool and it took away the pain. I don't know how long I was gone and the next time I remember being in my body. I was at home wrapped in bandages over my whole body from head to toe.  
   Probable NDE due to electrocution at age 8.  A second experience is described which is more consistent with dream vs narcotic experience (presumably he was on narcotic pain medications at the time).   

    1699.        Mary G SOBE       8/17/2008.      SOBE 21870.             It was the day before my thirty-seventh birthday.  Noelle was coming into the world.  I had a bad experience with my son's birth eight years before, so this time, I decided to go completely natural.  It was a little frightening, because the doctor had not arrived.  The nurse and my husband had to deliver her.  I was lying on my left side and the pushing urge took over.  Suddenly I was behind myself, looking at the event taking place.  No more fear--no pain.  Just peace.  I didn't even seem surprised that I was there.  Then I saw an amazing pure white light coming from inside my lower back.  The light was so bright that it would have hurt my eyes, but it didn't.  It was really indescribable but felt like love on the highest level I have ever experienced.  I remember wondering what it was.  Immediately I could see it was shaped like a baby--my baby!  The entire experience lasted only a short time, and I was back in my body just as she was born.  I believe I was very privileged to witness my daughter's soul entering her body.  
   OBE at time of childbirth.  Witnessed baby’s soul entering its body.   

    1698.        John T FDE       7/13/2008.      FDE 21868.             I was caught in the cross fire. There were thirteen shots fired. I was hit three times, through my right hand, through the left forearm, and in the left arm part of bicep muscle. I saw one bullet pass my eyes and hit concrete right in front of me.  During this episode, my spirit left my body and was looking back at my body shaking uncontrollably. I became very calm but had thoughts of how I was going to explain to Walter’s wife and nine children I tried my best.  I thought he was dead. Also how to tell my parents?  In the calm was a white light of calmness. Thank you for letting me tell my story, as for today I do not fear death.  
   OBE associated with Fear-Death Experience due to being shot, but not in critical organs.   

    1697.        Luz H NDE       9/29/2008.      NDE 3681.       From Puerto Rico. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      I entered into shock, and that is when everything began. I felt great peace, and felt no fear in separating from my body. I felt myself floating and that I was rising from the gurney. I could hear people praying all around me but could not react, could not open my eyes or move, etc.  
   NDE from post-childbirth complications.   

    1696.        Kane D NDE       9/27/2008 &amp; 2006.      NDE 2698/3692.       From the UK.      I could see 360 degrees around my body and in every direct.  I could see any place at the same time.  I had instant knowing. I thought of my daughter and I was there at her home with her.  Yet, at the same time, I was here in the hospital looking at myself. I watched a trail of visitors around the bed.  They were panicking.  I watched a lady place a lavender candle on the side board.  She hid it in the draw before I came out of my coma. (I found it later) I felt love surround me, like warm cozy arms squeezing around me. Yet, I had no body. I felt, I knew it was OK.  
   NDE due to brain hemorrhage from right temporal aneurysm. Integration experience - Also shared in 2006.   

    1695.        Frances Probable NDE       9/27/2008.      Probable NDE 3691.       From Ireland.      I was trying to come out of the anesthesia and a heard a nurse say, 'She isn't awake yet. Let her sleep a little longer.' It was then it happened. I felt so very sleepy, but unable to say I was awake. The next thing I felt separate from my body and woke up in black but only for a second, not even a second. I then was slowly going toward light and as I progressed toward it I felt almost layers of myself falling away - I became lighter and lighter and happier - just so happy. I was in a tunnel of very white light and I saw a group of people who loved me. I don't know who they were, but they were familiar to me. No words were said but I felt the pure joy of being there, such incredible relief. There were many women young and old.  
   Probable NDE following surgery.   

    1694.        Paul J NDE       9/27/2008.      NDE 3693.             I remember standing on the edge of a cliff and in front of me I saw a mist, a floating fog, but for some reason I knew it was bottomless. All I could feel, hear, and see was sadness. It was at that moment of realization that I knew my right hand was raised. I turned my head and looked at my hand and I looked up to see that I was holding the left hand of Jesus. I knew in my heart it was Him. He didn't look at me, he just turned me away from the edge of what I can only call the abyss, and led me away and towards darkness. The next thing I remember is coming to and asking my wife to get me a priest.  
   NDE due to brain hemorrhage from aneurysm.   

    1693.        Derek C NDE       9/27/2008.      NDE 3694.             After an unknown amount of time to me I was awake again lying on my bed but things were very different. I felt no pain, very much at peace, and not sure if I just woke up or was awakened but on the left side of my bed was my Oma and Opa (grandmother and grandfather in German) both of whom had died at different times in the past. On the right side of my bed were my Great Grand Mother and Great Grand Father. I have never met my Great Grand Father; he died long before I was even born. My Great Grand Mother was the love of my life as a child, if I was bad during the week my punishment was that I would not be allowed to go to her home and stay with her for the weekend. I have more fond memories of her and being with her than anyone in my life.  
   NDE during unconsciousness following apparent heart attack.   

    1692.        Gary T NDE       9/27/2008.      NDE 3695.             At that point, I was in a stage of total darkness and I felt wonderful, no pain, and no fear. Then I realized where I was at and I saw a bright light. My doctor was in the light and he told me I was not going to die. I went with him into the light and things started moving faster and faster. I came to a few hours later in intensive care.  
   NDE due to blood loss.   

    1691.        Curtis K NDE       9/27/2008.      NDE 3696.             A kind of darkness came over me and I experienced a grayish dark void of infinite nothingness. I had no fear at this point. I had no concept of time or relationships to time or of moments passing. It was a very unusual feeling to say the least, not what we normally experience in the everyday reality of our lives. I felt myself becoming more and more aware, self-aware. I had feelings of expanding awareness, becoming everything known, experiencing everything yet to be known. As this was happening, everything I had been taught, everything I believed in, everything I ever learned or thought throughout the course of my lifetime, fell away from me as if they never held meaning in the first place. This felt okay to me, I had no fear.  
   NDE due to apparent heart attack.   

    1690.        Roxanne H NDE       9/27/2008.      NDE 3698.             This is where and when things changed. I know I was somewhere and very little light. Then in front of me, I saw blue clouds, bluer than any blue you can imagine, with brilliant white clouds fluffy white, whiter than you have ever seen. While looking at this I saw gold I am not sure if it was a table a road or a fence or altar. As I got closer I saw a figure. At first, I did not know who it was so I got even closer. I saw Jesus standing before me. I couldn't believe this was true until he moved. He was brilliant, love radiated from him and he knew who I was and everything about me. He was perfect (for lack of a better word) his skin, his hair, his eyes, they were like nothing I have seen before or since. His robe was white and blue all on piece but yet blended into one garment. His gaze was of acceptance, recognition, and love.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    1689.        Justin M NDE       9/27/2008.      NDE 3699.             I then almost instantly found myself in complete darkness. It was a strange darkness. I mean it was dark, but I had no trouble seeing the area around me. Suddenly, I felt this presence in the area with me. I then said in a normal tone 'What is this? Where Am I?' My reply back was 'You have suffered an injury, and that is why your here.' I then tried moving. I struggled to move from side to side, but couldn't. I literally felt like I was being held still. The being was so strong that I couldn't get free, (I don't mean that in a scared way). I then said 'Why are you holding me still?' The being replied back 'I have to.' I replied back 'Am I gonna be alright?' In a loving, fatherly voice the being replied, 'You'll be alright.'  
   NDE due to head injury in early childhood.   

    1688.        M.E. NDE       9/27/2008.      NDE 3700.             The tunnel was very vivid and immediate and real though. I was in a tunnel of light and I experienced the tunnel of light - and I know it was not just the ordinary experience of being pushed through a tunnel because I was watching it all from above. I saw myself stretched there, I saw the scrubs and caps or whatever those hospital folks wear on their heads, I saw their shoulders, backs, I did not see their faces, just mine. I saw the floor, I saw it all from above and I could see the bright, bright sky all along the side of me and above me and then surrounding me too.  
   NDE at age six from head injury in accident.   

    1686.        Abdul A NDE       9/19/2008.      NDE 3690.       From Yemen, living in the UK.      When I opened my eyes, I saw myself standing on my knees and arms. I was in a place that had no beginning and no ending. It was a white place, white everywhere. I was very tired and couldn't stand up. When I looked in front of me, I saw three tall men standing next to each other. The two on the sides were the same height, but the one in the middle was taller. Their faces were blurry. I couldn't see them clearly. The middleman (the tallest one) pointed at me. I felt that everything was shaking and I felt like something was pulling me. Then I saw myself back in the classroom. The nurse was holding me and he said that they had nearly lost me.  
   NDE associated with faint at age fifteen.   

    1685.        Joseph G NDE       7/6/2008.      NDE 21856.             I went to the emergency room of the hospital because of a bad reaction to a tetanus shot.  While in the emergency room, I was given two shots of penicillin.  After the second shot, I fell to the floor.  All of a sudden, I found myself floating at the ceiling watching the turmoil going on in the room.  My body was on the gurney jumping and shaking.  The room was full people working on me; pounding on me.  The nurse who gave me the shots was sitting on the floor in the corner, hysterical. I saw them use the electric paddles, trying to start my heart, with no luck. I thought I heard someone say that I was dead. Suddenly, this doctor rushed into the room, shoving everyone out of the way. He was carrying this long syringe with a long needle and plunged it into my chest.  That was the last thing I remember.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction that happened 50 years ago.   

    1684.        Hosin F Possible NDE       9/1/2008.      Possible NDE 3663.       From Iraq. Original in Arabic.      Two weeks after I had the same thing happen, I felt something swooped into my face. I entered to dark black tunnel, and then I reached to a shining colored phosphoric golden world. I looked at myself, I couldn't see my body so I knew that I had left it behind, it was on the bed and my family was crying there. The speed was much more light speed, but it was fun. I tried to turn my head around me but I could not my sight was straight ahead only. I exited that world to a third world, this new world looked like our world at sunrise time, with some clouds, with wafts of breeze, I said to myself here I will not suffer anymore, this is the end of sickness and fatigue.  
   Possible Non-Western NDE from Iraq. Can't tell if he actually died, but at the very least, he had an OBE/STE.   

    1683.        Pam C Probable NDE       4/1/2012.      Probable NDE 16032.       As told to NDERF's Elaine S.      She was placed under anesthesia and found herself going through a tunnel.  She heard tinkling chimes, experienced flashing lights, and saw there was a bright light at the end of the tunnel.  Someone was waiting at the end of the tunnel dressed in a long robe with a hood who took her to another area.  There were five or six others dressed similarly in that area. They looked like monks.  She couldn't see their faces, but she knew who they were, although now she doesn't know who they were. Even though she felt at the time that they were loved ones.  It was like being home again. Everyone hugged and embraced.  There was an overwhelming feeling of love.  It was like a reunion.  
   Wow!  I get chills reading this one!  It is so transformative.   

    1682.        Jose MO NDE       8/31/2008.      NDE 3653.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Nancy A.      The moment came when - though I was not breathing - I felt I was breathing, I stopped feeling my heartbeats. I had neither pain nor weariness, no, everything was very, very pleasant, I felt stronger and more alive than ever before, I felt light as if I could fly at any moment. However, I couldn't move a single muscle. I didn't care about it, I was absorbed in what I was feeling at that moment - I wasn't hearing or seeing anything, I felt no pain or weariness, I didn't notice the passing of time. Unexpectedly, I lost awareness of my body and I saw myself in some other place, to be more precise, I saw myself at the school I attended (I loved school). Then I saw myself at my best girlfriend's house but I couldn't see my body, I just saw a landscape. I was feeling even better with all that, those images made me really happy and there was also wind at the back, a light wind.  
   NDE from a childhood prank.   

    1681.        Todd H NDE       8/30/2008.      NDE 3684.             All of a sudden, the pain disappeared. I was told that all my thoughts were in the past; that none of that mattered anymore. It was so peaceful. I felt the presence of others. They were close but so far away. I did not recognize them, but I knew they were familiar. I was told, 'You will suffer in silence.'  
   NDE from Pulmonary medical procedure. Peace, felt presence of others. Post-traumatic stress disorder after this.   

    1680.        Fred S NDE       8/30/2008 & 8/13/2011 &amp; 10/16/2010.      NDE 3682/5312/4850.             I then left my body and saw my physical body go limp. I was at the point of not returning. The technician who tried to catch my whisper saw what was happening. The anesthesia mask was ripped off my face, the IV was taken out and I was intubated. I came back in a panic, clawing and grabbing at everything. I was surprised how close I came and I immediately recalled being outside of my body watching myself go limp.  
   NDE due to anesthesia complication.  NDE initially shared 10 days after the event.   

    1679.        Robert N NDE       8/30/2008.      NDE 3680.             At age seven, while swimming (I had not really learned yet) in a motel swimming pool, I found I could not get my head above water. I swam underwater to the edge and tried to pull myself up. The ceramic tile border was slippery, and I could not get a grip on it. I was drowning. At this time, I started to see myself struggling from a perspective from below and behind me. This visualizing continued until, at the last moment, I was finally able to gain a grip, and was able to pull my head above the water.  
   NDE at age seven from near drowning. Sharing NDE fifty-two years later.   

    1678.        Paul T NDE       8/30/2008.      NDE 3679.       From India. Non-Western NDE.      I felt like I was a hydrogen balloon floating in the air. I was going upward. When I felt it, I tried to open my eyes and my head was laying downwards. When I slowly opened my eyes, I saw my body lying on the roadside. I got really frightened. I felt like I am paralyzed and I was going upwards but I felt someone is carrying me very lovingly (an unconditional love). I tried to move my body and turned my eyes upwards to see who is carrying me. What I saw was Mother Mary. She wore a blue and pink dress (there is a statue painted in this color) with a crown. And the position is like she is carrying me with both her hands, I felt very comfortable in her hands.  
   NDE at age five due to being struck by van.   

    1677.        Austin T Probable NDE       8/30/2008.      Probable NDE 3678.             At that point, I was in a different place with two or three other beings. They were much taller than I was, I felt very small and insignificant beside them. They were very compassionate to me, despite how inconsequential I was compared to them.  I was shown my life, and they talked about it. They pointed out an event in my childhood when I was four or five years old, and one of them said to the others, 'That's why he had to do great things,' and the others agreed.  
   Suicide attempt produced this experience.   

    1676.        Cynthia NDE       6/30/2008.      NDE 21844.             The last thing I actually saw was the emergency string which I think I pulled. What happened next is something that makes me wonder ‘what really happened’. I remember being surrounded by a bright white light. It was all around me. I started to hear the voices of nurses in panic, yelling, asking for help. It was chaos. The strange thing about their voices is that I heard them as if they were far away. I could hear them saying to one another ‘She is not breathing, she's turning blue.’ As I heard this I could remember thinking to myself, ’I'm not breathing? I don't need to breath’. As I was in this bright light, I could literally feel wind blowing through my body. I didn't have to breathe because the air flowing through me was enough and I knew this. All I could feel was peace and happiness.  
   NDE due to blood loss after delivery.   

    1675.        Glauco S NDE       8/17/2008.      NDE 3674.             I had flashbacks about playing soccer with my friend, being hugged by my mom, the sun, the rain, things that made me happy. I also knew my angel did this for a reason because any sane person would not want to go back. I also realized for the first time how beautiful and fragile Earth really is. I could sense the earth breathing like it was alive. I could see a light around everything that was alive, trees, flowers, grass, animals, volcanoes and humans. I sensed that humans were in control over other living things, I have the word (aura) stamped in my mind ever since.  
   NDE due to near drowning (under water about twenty-two minutes) in Brazil at age eight. Three brothers saw the same angel. Remarkably transcendent experience.   

    1674.        Janie G NDE       8/17/2008.      NDE 3672.             Then there was this voice, this presence, I can't explain it - a bright light and a voice off to the side of me. She said,' Do you remember the way you breathed when you were going to have the children?' I knew she meant the Lamaze slow chest breathing I used when I gave birth to my children. She asked me to use this breathing technique. At this time I really panicked as I began to think of my children and how little they were and how much they needed me.  
   NDE due to overdose of epinephrine at dentist office.   

    1673.        Sharon B NDE       8/17/2008.      NDE 3670.             I had a life review which just seemed to happen all on its own. This lasted but a blink of an eye and the lesson in the reviewing process is that we judge ourselves; God does not judge us. Then I heard His voice, which seemed to be infused into me, yet I heard it as well. The messages were very clear - what you put into this universe, you will get back.  
   NDE due to accident with direct head injury. Three NDEs all similar, one described in detail.   

    1672.        Damien R NDE       4/24/2008.      NDE 21840.             Then was thrust into a long tunnel of sort, couldn't see it but more like could sense it. I was traveling at an unreal speed faster than I would've ever imagined. The feeling of weightlessness was present. I began to feel fear and panic, then I broke through to what I believe was the other side. A sudden calm took over me and a new found happiness. I know now that as long as we are present in our shells, or bodies, we are unable to feel this extent of peace, love, tranquility and comfort. The tunnel gave way to an immense light that couldn't be seen but more like felt. Everything was blinding bright but not in the same sense as staring into the sun or a welding arc. It was more of a second sight phenomena. I started communicating with something vast and all powerful, all knowing and true to the purest definition. It wasn't as if we were talking like person to person but more like telepathically, for a lack of better words. I fully understand now how words are unable to bring to light or understanding an experience that happens on a spiritual plane.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    1671.        Ekaterina A NDE       8/14/2008.      NDE 3667.       From Bulgaria.      Suddenly, as though I was this man, I was watching the world through his eyes. He had a small woman and eight kids, and the last kid was newborn. He was a poor peasant, who hardly supported his family, but among all peasants he was considered to be in the middle class. His native language was German, but he also spoke French well. He was living outside of the city and cultivated the earth. I understood all of this when I started watching through his eyes. He went round the hill and in front of him a vast plane revealed itself, in the middle of which was an ugly, gray, depressive city, from our point of view, small. The historical time was the Middle Ages. He reached the city and entered. The picture that I saw from his eyes was so startling, that it can't be seen even in the most bravely staged and realistic Hollywood movie about the Middle Ages.  
   Exceptional NDE. Associated with operation for pheochromocytoma (rare tumor) at age sixteen.   

    1670.        Judy H NDE       8/14/2008.      NDE 3669.             I could see myself lying on the operating room table. As I was floating up, I went through a set of double doors and was in a beautiful green field. It had a creek running through the middle of the field on the other side of the creek was a beautiful field of flowers. There was also the most perfect mountain in the field. I was standing far away from the creek but it seemed like I took one-step and was across the creek.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest during operation for tubal ligation. Interesting concept of a 'boundary' in NDEs here.   

    1669.        Van R NDE       8/14/2008.      NDE 3665.             At this point I didn't feel as if I had died. It felt more like I was slipping away from life slowly and I couldn't stop it. I remember my roommate was sitting next to me and I had turned my head to look at her. Everything went quiet and I felt like I was in a dreamlike state. Everything slowed down. At that moment, I felt as if I was out of my body and the déjà vu feeling was so intense. I remember I felt really disappointed and knew I had died. I was telling myself that. I felt I was still alive, just not in my body and even shocked that I was still functioning. I had the feeling that sleep was no longer an option and my mind was going to wonder for eternity. I then remember sound came back suddenly and I was back in my body.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction. Happened less than two weeks ago.   

    1668.        Story C NDE       8/14/2008.      NDE 3664.             I was rushing through beautiful colors, all at once my paternal grandmother stood in front of me. She was beautiful, dressed in a beautiful white gown, behind her there was a veil, like looking through lace curtain with other beings milling about. She told me I could not stay, I wanted to stay I felt so wonderful. She told me I had to go back and care for my babies (I had a two year old also).  
   NDE during childbirth fifty-two years ago.   

    1667.        Diane B ADC       8/14/2008.      ADC 3666.             The experience I wish to share is one in which my father passed over and I witnessed him leaving. I saw a little whirlwind leave the top of his head as it fell into my arm. Then I saw my mother extend her hand and I heard her laugh. I do remember thinking, 'Science is trying to measure what I saw.'  
   ADC witnessing a whirlwind come from her father’s head at his moment of death.   

    1666.        Alfonso SD NDE       8/8/2008.      NDE 3618.       From Columbia. Original in Spanish. Translated to English by Simon.      In front of me, there was a light (I'm not certain whether it was a light or a horizontal line, perfectly straight and infinitely extended). I cannot remember the exact color or form, but it was everything that exists. Literally EVERYTHING and at the same time NOTHING, nothing besides this had existence, there was no universe, no world, no time, no space, nothing - and nobody! It was the most crushing feeling of absolute Nothingness, you could not turn it around to look from a different angle, it was impossible, the light was everything, and my body did not exist.  
   NDE from near-drowning incident.   

    1665.        Ruben E NDE       8/6/2008.      NDE 3614.       From Columbia. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon.      At first I was floating, surrounded by a very white and brilliant light, and as I descended I noticed that the white light was not just light: there were very, very white clouds which I was passing through. After coming through the clouds, I found myself descending towards a very beautiful landscape, with green meadows, rivers, butterflies and birds. I was moving towards a hill with a tree on top. The sensation I felt I cannot express in words, but it was so wonderfully tranquillizing that the desire is there to return and feel it over again.  Before I reached the tree, I felt the landscape darkening, and I felt as if I was being dragged backwards at great speed, taking me away from this place; then I found myself in the hospital again, surrounded by people.  
   NDE from cardiac arrest.   

    1664.        Amelia NDE       7/30/2008.      NDE 3611.       From Brazil, Original in Spanish, Translated to English by Simon.      I had a perforated ulcer, with a lot of bleeding. My husband took me to hospital. Until then I was relatively conscious. I was taken to the operating theatre, where I only remember hearing: 'She has no pulse, no pressure, we're losing her.' I didn't think this could be about me, as I was ascending a tunnel with a wonderful golden light at the end. I felt extraordinarily happy, a feeling of unforgettable well-being. I don't know when I came to again. What intrigues me is that after a month or two, already completely restored to health, I sometimes saw a young man (40, more or less) in my house, looking at me. I never saw his face, and he neither said anything nor made any movement. This happened on and off for about 5 months.  
   Beginnings of a NDE from blood loss.   

    1663.        Maria N Possible NDE       7/30/2008.      Possible NDE 3655.       From Puerto Rico. Original in Spanish translated to English by Carmen.      All of a sudden, I felt something coming out of my body, something from myself was coming off me. I didn't want this to carry on before I could see my daughter. Something was pushing me to leave the chair where I was sitting. My mind was telling me that I didn't want to go before I could see my daughter and tell her about the beautiful experience I was going through. I closed my eyes and saw a virgin; something wanted to take me but when I insisted on wanting to see my daughter, it left me alone and I felt my body back on the chair again.  
   Possible NDE from not being able to breathe.   

    1662.        Antonieta SCC Possible NDE       7/29/2008.      Possible NDE 3662.       From Peru. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Carmen.      During those moments while I was unconscious I began to see a very intense tunnel full of a light too bright and my body went towards this tunnel. I felt an intense incomparable happiness. I arrived at the end of the tunnel and, surprised, I saw a beautiful garden full of flowers. Then I saw a prince or very bright angel dressed in bright white clothes who was indicating that I should be back to the tunnel, to which I no longer wanted to return.  
   Possible NDE from anesthesia reaction.   

    1661.        Christopher J NDE       7/28/2008.      NDE 3658.             I was standing in the middle of a meadow, rolling hills and beautiful flowers dotted the area. I could see cottages in the distance. A song more beautiful than any I have ever heard was playing in the background, with no visible source. The very air emanated love and warmth, a love that goes deep into the soul and can withstand anything. The guy called me by name and I turned around. The man was barely out of his twenties, blond, longish hair, blue eyes, dressed in the whitest clothing I have ever seen. (Later, I learned that angels were clothed in light, which explains his clothes.)  
   NDE due to being smothered during childhood 'game'. NDE at age eight. He is age twenty at time he shared this.   

    1660.        Kristi Possible NDE       7/28/2008.      Possible NDE 3657.             I survived the fire and being so small I do believe that I was visited by someone or some being from the other side when this took place because of the way certain 'talents' and preferences have stayed with me in this life from the very beginning. I grew up in a home where religion was viewed as a crutch for the weak. Both of my parents claimed to be Agnostics but my mom did allow me to investigate religious organizations when I was in my pre-teens. However, ever since I can remember, I prayed to God every night. I did not pick this up from any relative or friend. I remember having the surest certainty that there was a God, that he personally watched over me and that he and the others with Him were incredibly beautiful.  
   Premature birth and fire in incubator at the time. Has experienced aftereffects since that time typical of NDErs.   

    1659.        Brian NDE       7/28/2008.      NDE 3656.             At age twenty-four, I was late for work, so I hopped on my motorcycle and a car turned left in front of me. I hit the car at over sixty mph and flew over it. I was wearing a helmet, but hit my head really hard. I guess that when I was unconscious in the ambulance, I was dreaming that my best friend at the time Scott and I were just hanging out like usual, and he jokingly asked me if I liked God or the Devil. I said, God of course and immediately I found myself in the back of an ambulance, being resuscitated. Each event has changed the way I look at life, I value each day, and though I don't attend church, I feel a very close connection to God and thank him for giving me a wonderful life.  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident. Relatively rare experience of encountering someone apparently alive at the time.   

    1658.        Attila P Possible NDE       7/28/2008.      Possible NDE 3625.       From Germany.  Original in German. Translated to English by Amy.      He passed me by and went smiling towards my doorway. The sentinels drew back and the massive doors opened. I saw an intense warm light and heard pleasant music, which was in absolute harmony. It was a place of palpable tangible love. A place of welcome, of feeling absolutely at home. I understood what it meant to be home. No question, just absolute acceptance. Belonging. I moved so that I could quickly get to the light. Before I made it to the door one of the sentinels grabbed me and held me fast. The doors closed. Next, I found myself in some kind of courtroom. Before me sat an unbelievably stern all-powerful yet very kind judge. Absolutely incorruptible. Duty and person were one and the person didn't exist without the duty. I sat on a bench and near me was a friend or defender. Great love emanated from him. Was it Jesus?  
   Possible NDE at age four from the Croupe.   

    1657.        Sandra NDE       7/28/2008.      NDE 3620.       Original in Spanish. Translated to English by Amy.      That's when I had the strange sensation of floating. I could see my friends gathered around me but I could no longer hear them. I could also see my body; I was white and not moving. It was very strange. An intense light appeared and almost blinded me. In that light, I saw my paternal grandfather. He died when I was only three years old. I felt good at the same time that I was worried. I can't describe it.  
   Short NDE while playing basketball.   

    1656.        Jackie G Probable NDE       7/27/2008.      Probable NDE 3572.       From Mexico, Original in Spanish, Translated to English by Simon.      All I felt was something marvelous invading my body; an indescribable peace and love which has to be experienced, though I would not wish anything bad for anybody. I had a feeling of 'where am I?', then, 'I know I'm here and I don't want to go back there. I know I have died and my past life means nothing to me.' It is a feeling, which comes to me and covers me; it is lovely.  I began to see some huts, it was a charming wood, then suddenly I was hovering, and I saw that people were eating. They were all in white with jackets or tunics, I don't recall exactly, and I saw Mama in the distance, chatting, and someone else approaching her. '  
   Very sick from Hepatitis A and grieving for mother.   

    1655.        Olivia G NDE       7/27/2008.      NDE 3643.       From Mexico. Original in Spanish, Translated to English by Amy.      I fought to stay alive, I spoke with God and told him, 'Here I am Lord, You have me here, whatever you want let that be your Will.' In that moment I saw a dark void, I knew it was Him, and at the depth of the Void a sacred heart. He spoke to me and told me it wasn't going to be easy. I saw my children and the pain of the youngest one who would miss me terribly, I knew it wasn't easy but I kept fighting to live.  
   NDE from accident and saw nurses fixing medical mistake.   

    1654.        Bridget F NDE       7/21/2008.      NDE 3648.             At this point, a being made of light came to my side. I was not raised religious nor was I baptized. I could be wrong but it felt like what people call Christ. It was not the Christ we see in paintings or pictures.  It was not the Christ we hear about from evangelicals.  It was not America's Christ nor any other representation of Christ I have come across. This was a being so pure, so benevolent, and so non-judgmental I could barely comprehend the level of compassion this being possessed in the small yet brilliant light that it was. Not until it touched me and said 'I'll take that, it's for me,' and took the beam from me and touched me, was I even able to fathom this amazing love.  
   Exceptional NDE due to auto accident.   

    1653.        Linda G NDE       7/20/2008.      NDE 3649.       From Australia.      I came to understand that we all choose to come to Earth to fulfill a plan of some sort or even learn about a particular interest. We choose our bodies, parents, and life plan. May I also add that some people come here for the most simple of reasons; to learn how to play tennis for example; or simply for the cake and food - as silly as this sounds our life plans aren't so high and lofty as one might think. I DIDN'T MEET ANY 'SAVE THE WORLDERS' OR ANYONE WISHING TO BE A PRESIDENT. MOST HAD SIMPLE WISHES. I was also told we could exist on different planes for other lives but our life here on Earth is a life not purely to experience physical pleasure or pain but to have a physical experience because in all other planes we don't need a body as a vessel.  
   Exceptional NDE due to accidental drug overdose.   

    1652.        John W NDE       7/20/2008.      NDE 3650.             I was alone in a large space - bright white light and warm and comfortable. I was very tired and ready to sleep. Sleep was a great temptation. I saw myself there wrapped in bedclothes but not necessarily in a bed. I somehow understood that to go to sleep was to NOT wake up and the decision was mine. My next recollection is of being in my bed in an emergency room of the hospital and seeing the door open.  
   NDE due to accident.   

    1651.        Christopher E OBE       7/20/2008.      OBE 3652.       From Nigeria.      Well the more warning the more the other force I can't explain is pulling me toward another venture. At all this stage I clearly understand that I am out of my body because I feel the same way as I feel now writing all this down. But the peculiar thing is that while standing in my village I can still see my body sleeping in my friend's room far aware in Germany, while trying to put all this things together, my eyes were opened more to my immediate environment! I started seeing all the dead elderly people of my kindred. They were all happy in there various compounds some cooking while some are doing other domestic works. From the spot I was standing I could see every compound and all the past dead elderly people of our kindred...  
   From individual living in Nigeria. Probable dream/OBE.   

    1650.        CJ C Possible NDE       7/13/2008.      Possible NDE 3646.             In the pit I realized that God is one and he stands as one. We are all an extension of God and if we don't stand as one we will fall. That's how the universe is connected. If we hurt those around us, we are hurting ourselves and we will fall. Because who will be our support when we need it? If we love others by first loving ourselves, we are close to God and others. If we hurt, hold bitterness, are unforgiving, hatred or any other thing against ANYONE we are going to destroy ourselves. Because we will keep the bitterness inside and it will make us physically sick and we'll eventually spiral down to the pit  
   Very sick due to drug use, but no specific imminent life-threatening event clear. Very transcendent experience.   

    1649.        Cabell M NDE       7/13/2008.      NDE 3642.             The experience was not of the mind but what I believe to be of the soul and spirit. There was a huge light and my soul was at a learning point, our lives spent here in body, and soul being present in them, is to learn as much as we can. When we are older and pass from this life, I was shown that a new life to go on learning doesn't stop. For example, like a car we make newer and better models, just like our souls. As time goes on and our soul leaves our bodies at the time of death we go on to another dimension in time and learn even more without recollection of what was previous or in the future, but our souls remain always everlasting. I hope this makes some sense to you because it did to me.  
   NDE associated with an operation.   

    1648.        Tracy T NDE       7/13/2008.      NDE 3641.             I was no longer in my body. I had crossed over to a wondrous place of pure peace of love. What I recall is bits and pieces. I was met by who I thought was Jesus. We spoke for a time, then I was taken to a place I can only describe as a flowing grassy meadow without end or beginning. There I was told to rest. How long I was there, I can't explain. Time did not exist as we know it here. I was aware of all things, although I could see no spirits. I was aware of them. Those living as well as dead. Communication was complete and without misunderstanding. Time passed, and then Christ came to me. Though he was away, He was not. Alone in this beautiful place I was content. He asked if I wanted to return to the living. As I answered the question, 'NO, I want to stay here.'  
   Gripping NDE due to Ryes Syndrome at age fifteen.   

    1647.        Alison D NDE       7/13/2008.      NDE 3640.             Euphoria, clear, perfect happiness, contentment. I know not how to call it. It was the most perfect emotion imaginable. Neither too great nor too small, not manic, not placid, but perfect, the ideal psychological human state, and I would give anything to regain it. The emotional state was the highest point of the experience, and the key of the memory. I lie awake at night going over the emotional state, trying to analyze it, to figure out how to regain it, to find a way to recreate it in real life in a natural way. The best way I can explain it is this: It was a purely experiential happiness without judgment, without time sense (neither past nor future), and perfectly mindful (even though I was in pain, there was no 'positive or negative' awareness of the pain), and with a clear, glorious, euphoric happiness that was not clouded by any negativity or agitation. No negative emotions at all, in fact. None at all.  
   NDE due to anaphylactic reaction from MRI contrast. Contributor is Ph.D. Psychologist. Given this background, remarkable discussion of NDE experience.   

    1646.        Jean K Other       4/18/2008.      Other 21827.             We always went to my Mother's and help prepare holiday dinner. I was standing against the door going into the kitchen, just talking and laughing with everyone in the kitchen. I saw myself on the other side of the room sitting on the steps, peeling potatoes and talking and laughing, but I could not hear what I was saying and all I could do was point at myself. Of course, everyone laughed and said yea right, but I could not explain it. I didn't know why or how. Only how strange I felt at the time. Everyone laughed it off and I though no more about it until about hour later. I was actually sitting on the steps peeling potatoes, and it was as if I felt a shock, jolt and I realized that where I was, what I had seen an hour earlier. It just happened.  
   Interesting example of autoscopy and déjà vu.   

    1645.        Cara NDE       7/6/2008.      NDE 3637.             I perceived myself and other beings as masses of energy...all connected and yet separate. There were no body forms or communication, as I know it in human form. There was simply a sense of all knowing. Each and every spirit being was supportive of each other, and I "knew" them, although they didn't have the same forms as when I knew them on the earth school. There were no limitations such as space or time in the spirit world. I was aware of the big picture regarding the past, present and future. I was aware that the earth school experience was one part of my evolution.  
   Exceptional NDE due to head injury.   

    1644.        Dave R NDE       7/6/2008.      NDE 3639.             Little by little I began to become more conscious of the state I was in and was looking up at the object before me getting closer and acknowledging more and more it's power and greatness. The feelings I felt about its greatness where not just mine but I had a sense that that feeling was shared from many others as I did not feel alone although I didn't see anyone. I had absolutely no thoughts of my life or what had just happened. I just focused on the lit object.  
   NDE at age twelve associated with introduction to smoking cigarettes. This account is yet another reason not to smoke.   

    1643.        Antonio C NDE       7/6/2008.      NDE 3638.       From Brazil.      During this time I remember talking to myself that I was dead. For sure, I was dead once I was meeting Jesus and St. Peter. I was surprised being in a dark place as I thought heaven was blue with angels playing music. I was not scared at any time, actually I felt myself playing around with myself saying how bad the accident was that I ended up being there. It was very weird mainly because I do not believe on these things and I am not religious.  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident. Accident occurred slightly more than one month ago.   

    1642.        Jackie M NDE       2/11/2008.      NDE 21825.             Although I could see myself and Mary neither one of us were moving.  Another thing is that the distance it was of me looking down on myself was more than it could've been.  It was as if I were looking down from the distance of being on a second floor, but we lived in a trailer at the time with maybe ten foot ceilings. While this was happening, I felt that God was with me.  I distinctly remember feeling that I had the choice either to go with Him or to stay behind.  I remember the term ‘letting go.’ That I could ‘let go’ if I wanted and that it would be as easy as releasing a ball from your hand.  Also, I just KNEW that either decision would be all right with Him.  I felt like He was leaving this decision entirely in my hands.  I wasn't afraid at all.  As a matter of fact I had a feeling of absolute peace.  
   NDE due to miscarriage at age 15.   

    1641.        Thea NDE       7/1/2008.      NDE 3630.       From Romania. Original in Romanian Translated to English by Mariana.      When I did give up, the water disappeared and all around me there was this gentle light that did not hurt my eyes, and I experienced a sense of total peace and calm. I remember thinking that if that was death it was fine with me. I would like to tell you that I had an unhappy childhood, with an alcoholic father and a mother who did not have much time for me, so being there in that place was a wonderful thing for me, indescribable.  
   NDEs at age four (scarlet fever 104 temp) and eight.
