  		              		Experience Description   

    Early last November, I went in for a long overdue physical. Along with various issues, I was having acute pain in my kidney area. I was inspected from head to toe, but neither the doctor nor I followed up on the pain in my back. I just attributed it as the cost of aging. The exam went great and the doctor said I would live to be 90. Fast forward to the Sunday after Thanksgiving. About half way through our church service, I felt like a baseball bat had slammed into my midsection. I said my goodbyes and made towards the back of the church, where I had to sit down or collapse. I made it to my truck, drove 10 miles, and barely made it to the door.  I told Betsy, my wife to be, I was having a kidney stone attack. I tried to rest but could find no relief.  She tried to get me into the car but I couldn’t make it. We called 911. They bypassed emergency room and went right into a CT scan room. The next thing I knew I had 10 nurses and doctors cutting off my clothes and preparing me for emergency surgery. I had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), 10.5 cm long and it ruptured as we headed to surgery. A 5 cm AAA has a 95% death rate and mine was twice that long. 

At this point things got hazy, but I'm told that before I would let them operate, I had the surgical team sing, 'You are my sunshine with me.'  What are the odds that I got to the hospital with minutes to live, the head surgeon was on duty, and I picked the only hospital that can do this procedure. Imagine Betsy, who came in thinking it was a kidney stone and hearing this news.  I lost 8 pints of blood just as they got started operating.  After extensive surgery, I had lost all function beneath my ribcage, including kidneys, intestines, and my right leg went from blue to black.  I was given a 50% chance of survival for the next 24 hours. After 2 days, I woke up in the intensive care unit (ICU). 

Some hours after that, I looked at my Betsy, held her hand, and said 'Here I go.' I coded and died again. Betsy told me the scene of the team giving me chest compressions and fighting to save me is etched in her mind forever. I had another extensive, emergency surgery to fix my lower gastro-intestinal tract and woke up 2 days later. For 11 days I was in the ICU, fighting to stay alive. On top of all that, I had to learn how to walk again. Yet, I stand before you today, by the grace of God and the best surgical team in Tennessee. My hospital stay did end on a high note. Betsy and I had planned on getting married before this happened, so we got married at the hospital.  

When Walter, my spiritual mentor, found out what had happened, his first words were, 'Praise God!' and his second words were, 'What did you see?'

I woke up in a place that was dark and warm. The first thing I noticed were the stones.  They were as tall as me and in so many colors; bright reds, yellows, greens, and blues.  They were glowing with writings on them that were older than time itself. Although I could not read them, I understood them. There was an arrow on each one, That pointed to the next stone. I was confused until it hit me. My favorite book in the Bible is John and begins with 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.' In Genesis, God said, 'Let there be light,' and in the middle of the darkness, the stones were leading me home.

My second experience was more dramatic. This time, my life flashed before me. Whole years of my life flashed by in a second, but with complete clarity. Time had no meaning here. Even more dramatic, decisions I had made in a split second were played back to me. I understood not only the impact they had made in my life, but the impact oncountless other lives as well. Some decisions I was proud of, while some I lowered my eyes in humiliation and shame. Yet, there was no judgment, other than my own.  The review simply let me see that choices have consequences.  But it was the third event that had the greatest impact on me. At the end of this experience, I was picked up and held by the most loving presence.  Words can't even describe it. Any parent here knows the feeling of holding a baby close to your chest and feeling heartbeats merge.That was what it was like for me. I was too awestruck to speak, but I'm sure we talked because I remember being gently released. And then I woke up in ICU.

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Two lessons.  1. Love God, Love Others (yes, even the mean, hurtful ones), Love Yourself! I am a unique expression of the Universal whole, with my flaws and all. 2. Express Gratitude for All Things in your Life; big and small, good and bad. Human life is temporary and worldly things are an illusion. Simply seek 'To Be' and the Eternal will flow in you

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The human experience can't relate to the vibrant glowing colors I saw, the emotions I experienced, and the power of Universal Love that enveloped me. Words alone will never convey what I experienced.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I signed up to be a speaker for a community outreach center. I speak to churches, civic groups, conventions.
