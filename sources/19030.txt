and colleague paula harris who has uh
paula harris is with me today and has
been a key person for the disclosure
project
and a support for what we&#39;re doing since
oh gosh the 1990s
1990s in italy yeah in italy
and uh thanks to paul harris we got some
amazing interviews with the
vatican astronomer and monsignor
balducci
and max pogey the capitan of the
captains of al italia airlines
and many other great cases so i&#39;d like
to
thank paula for everything she&#39;s done
to help move this field forward and many
people don&#39;t realize this but she&#39;s been
involved
since the i believe 80s with jay allen
heineck
of colonel corso very key people
seminal figures in in this effort going
back for
40 years and she&#39;s just done an
enormous body of work uh over the years
and is one of the great
unsung heroes of this this field in my
opinion
um and she just consistently
does amazing work she&#39;s also become
really adept
at doing close encounters of the fifth
time
and making contact and she really
understands
consciousness and the whole spectrum of
what this
subject entails and and of course you
know i&#39;ll let you speak um
paula about you know you&#39;re seeing the
movie and your reaction to it
well first of all i have let me say that
we
we do go way back and i support work
stephen my god we&#39;re on the same
wavelength and we&#39;ve been at it a long
time
i&#39;m not even going to tell you what my
age is but anyway
i basically will always support anything
you do i started
working with your films with sirius you
know
where creststone was serious when we did
serious
and it was an amazing film and then i
helped michael mazzolo
with uh a little bit with um
unacknowledged but this film when i saw
this film i was telling steven look you
know call me about this film because
probably the best film i&#39;ve ever
ever ever seen on this subject matter
and i&#39;ll tell you why
i&#39;m an educator by a profession i have a
master&#39;s
in education i taught school for 30
years high school
i taught at the american overseas school
of wrong for 15 years and i taught here
in boulder colorado and when you try to
present material
to an audience you have to present it in
a certain way and close encounters of
the fifth kind
is that kind of film it starts with nuts
and bolts it starts at the beginning
with the actual cover-up it has the
actual
uh people uh you get the sources you
don&#39;t get
gossip you don&#39;t get a conspiracy theory
stuff you get
the actual sources speaking the actual
you know the actual
heroes you mentioned corso you mentioned
other people i was involved with
bringing out
their testimonies those people are
heroes just like you are stephen
and it starts like that and then it goes
on to show the implications of the
cover-up
and the implications of the cover-up for
this planet are serious
right stopping humanity from going
forward and they say also
uh the messages we&#39;re getting from our
cosmic cultures is that our
spiritualities does not match
our technology right so
one of the things that we have to do is
become aware awake and aware
and for people that don&#39;t understand the
word consciousness is me
means being super awake but then you
have to add the component of
responsibility
if you know what&#39;s going on and you are
conscious
are you conscious when you&#39;re making
contact then you have a responsibility
you can&#39;t do nothing about it right so
uh the film has in the middle they the
the cover-up the where we should be
in 2020 uh especially uh
having worked with colonel corso i
realized steven that the real secret i
didn&#39;t know
was the military industrial complexes
um acquisition of the technology i
thought it was other things i thought it
was religion i thought it was
panic i thought it was these other
things but when there&#39;s a vested
interest
in keeping these things secret
then what needs to happen is there has
to be kind of a revolution
and and with uh the vested interest in
the military industrial complex
and i must add also that because of what
i know what
happened italy when you&#39;re looking at
the new york times
and everything there&#39;s an agenda behind
every single solitary
disclosure piece and it isn&#39;t
necessarily
for the raising of consciousness for
mankind
the very end is what you touched me
stephen
i was so emotional especially when you
used colonel
corso&#39;s words at the very end if you
could take it
i i started to cry i was totally still
i tried to understand the implications
of that
film um and it came across
it the message at the end was what
really made it different from like
unacknowledged
and serious um so this film
is graduate school of disclosure this
film is very spiritually oriented and
this film affects humanity this film
really affects people well we&#39;ve had so
many great
folks who from all walks of life who&#39;ve
seen it
who&#39;ve reached out to us from every war
country and um you know i recently heard
from demi lovato who&#39;s a
pop singer who was just completely
taken by this and got we have a new app
out that i don&#39;t know if you know this
polo that
lets people network with each other in
their own communities to form
contact groups and it&#39;s called the ce5
contact app and apparently she had
gotten it
and on her birthday a few weeks ago used
it with a few friends and had an amazing
contact experience
so what we&#39;re finding is that people
from all walks of life
um are are doing that and this is why
you know that whole
last part of the film is about the
science of consciousness
non-locality where people in meditative
states and in higher states of
consciousness
affect those around them that they those
people don&#39;t even know they&#39;re there
but it affects how they think and feel
in a way that&#39;s very
positive that is evolutionary and that&#39;s
that one percent effect that we talk
about
but now what we&#39;re trying to do is is
reach that one percent of the global
population
which is about 80 million people
but that&#39;s very doable because we have a
lot of influencers
and people coming on board who are
actually
looking at the film and then they&#39;re
getting the app
and they&#39;re trying it and they&#39;re having
these amazing experiences
like you had at mount shasta remember um
some years ago
and so i think that you know to me
that&#39;s where it all
is it isn&#39;t you know what the oval
office might do
or congress is what are the people going
to do and
it&#39;s the people are responsible for the
future of this planet
not these um you know
so-called leaders who for 70 years have
dropped the ball on this
yeah you know i wanted to tell everybody
and when i did an interview with dr
edgar mitchell apollo 14
astronaut and he told me he was doing
these psychic experiments from the moon
and in those days they were using cards
and they were using
all kinds of things and he said that the
people that were receiving the messages
in florida that it was
90 percent accurate if you can send
thoughts from the moon
and it&#39;s 90 percent accurate can you
imagine what thought
what the thought process could do on the
planet
right and that&#39;s what&#39;s important is you
figure that
because one of the key parts of close
encounters to the
the fifth kind um which by the way has
been
number one on amazon and itunes and
all over the world it&#39;s very unusual for
a crowdfunded
indie film to to do that is that
it makes this point that there isn&#39;t any
barrier
in space or time to consciousness and
thought
and so we&#39;re used to thinking in a
straight line
but in reality it&#39;s a holographic
conscious universe
and those words what that means is
is every point in space and time is
connected to every other point
on a deep level of these dimensions of
consciousness and thought
and that&#39;s what these ets certainly
understand because they&#39;re going beyond
the speed of light
among star systems and so if we&#39;re going
to be
ambassadors to them and contact them
we need to understand this paradigm
of how the universe actually functions
and that&#39;s why you know those
experiments that were done
at sri and with russell targ and then
what edgar mitchell shared with you is
so important
there are a lot of data points a lot of
people think this is some kind of voodoo
but there&#39;s such solid scientific uh
evidence and proof of what&#39;s called
entanglement
or entangled and non-locality in physics
dealing with consciousness and thought
and of course you add to that
that the et&#39;s have uh devices and you&#39;ve
seen many cases like this where people
will see there&#39;ll be a little box or
something and the et&#39;s are actually
transmitting and receiving thoughts
so they not only can do it innately
telepathically
they have technologies that interface
with quanta
of thought a discrete thought that&#39;s
intended a clear intention
and that&#39;s why the ce5 protocols
actually work
is because it&#39;s actually based in a
science and some of the course people
say that science goes back to the
ancient betas
and the ancient teachings of of native
cultures and
the aboriginals of australia with dream
time and what have you
and it&#39;s true it does but you add to
that the fact that we are dealing with
advanced technological civilizations
that not only understand the science of
consciousness but have developed
technologies
that are a very subtle trans-dimensional
electronics
that interface with mind and thought and
that&#39;s why they receive what we&#39;re
sending to them so clearly
i know and it&#39;s very well explained in
the film um
stephen because when you watch that film
uh
for me because i know you and i i&#39;ve
i&#39;ve dealt with us
um c seti and everything i i mean
it&#39;s familiar but for the people maybe
like demi lovato or other people that it
for the first time
it&#39;s explanation it doesn&#39;t it isn&#39;t woo
it&#39;s science it&#39;s a science that has
been around for a long time
and it&#39;s also a way of of um
of going on of dealing with things of
doing
a small groups of of contact groups
which are all over
uh your contract your contact groups
are making contact and they&#39;re they&#39;re
doing it in a way that is very
respectful
right it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s not like watching
dolphins at sea world it&#39;s
it&#39;s a very much honoring of the
civilization&#39;s presence
not only in our past but in our current
world and future
and with the objective of us creating
sort of
a global uh movement of
ambassadors who are humans to these
civilizations
in a way that&#39;s peaceful because you
know i always tell people we take a
couple steps back
and you begin to realize that my god how
have they been
dealt with since world war ii shot at
downed
vivisected killed tortured
um you know denied ridiculed
um caricatured uh into sort of the worst
sort of
fascist ways racist ways that you&#39;d see
right out of nazi germany
is how most of ufology portrays aliens
so in movies hollywood um like
independence day and all these sort of
fear-mongering things
so there has not been a global
response that is responsible but also
enlightened and encompasses the correct
paradigm understanding the physics
and the science of consciousness with it
being linked to a purpose that&#39;s
peaceful
that&#39;s going to lift all ships uh and
help humanity but also
help the cosmos because the earth is
interwoven into
life in the universe and what happens on
this planet is actually
of great consequence elsewhere
that&#39;s actually true and most of my work
now because of the
of the disneyland factor and ufology
and you know i&#39;m an educator it&#39;s really
hard on me to see like
little gray aliens all over the place i
will tell everybody
that colonel corso told me that what
they were most worried about was not the
clone
or a clone they were worried about the
human type
beings that could have created them and
that most of the
what they considered uh you know
extraterrestrial
was human type in other words uh could
walk he said we were afraid they&#39;d walk
in the
in the the halls of the pentagon we
wouldn&#39;t recognize them
he actually said that so when i started
doing the work uh first i started on
giant rock i&#39;ll leave giant rock
contest he&#39;s the 50s and 60s like
extensive work
and realized that was all real back in
the 50s and 60s
be before the betty and barney hill
abduction which
changed the the face of everything um
the latin americans are having contact
with these
space people walking off ships and it&#39;s
they&#39;re seen by five
six seven two hundred people so
whatever is visiting uh that used to
visit
southern california or you know here in
the 50s and 60s
has gone to latin america mainly because
the people
have a different view of contact
i mean they they don&#39;t think anything of
it you know i was in
peru and i was with gonzalez and we were
shooting a film and what happened was i
went into the
the bed and breakfast is where i was
this older lady was cooking and i said
did you ever see anything and she said
oh yeah she said from that mountain two
space people came down and talked to my
children
sure yeah that they talked to your
children
and she said yes they talked to my
children she said we didn&#39;t think
anything of it then they turned around
and walked away
now that she knew they were space people
they did not put them on television they
did not
you know do anything special with them
they did not
they just said it&#39;s normal i mean that&#39;s
that&#39;s what we have going on here and
this is peru
i&#39;ve been to chile and i&#39;ve been to
argentina
and uh of columbia and in in columbia
there&#39;s a whole culture of contact down
there so
you know i think people think well you
know we&#39;re just going to see lights in
the sky no no
much lights in the sky you you&#39;re going
to see
people you&#39;re going to see
interdimensional people
you&#39;re going to see all kinds of
manifestation of consciousness
well and the other thing is that part of
it is that the culture is
much more accepting the other part which
is
a little more disturbing is that
while there are uh weapons that are
scalar longitudinal weapons on
satellites all over the earth
the really concentrated land sea
air measures that target and destroy
et craft when they are in 3-d in
proximity
are in the united states and some other
western countries
uh and much less so in the developing
world
so that&#39;s another huge factor
and one of the things that that is not
talked about much
is that uh even the the much valley-hood
roswell event which did happen although
there were multiple events actually
that event was precipitated by a
the euphemism that&#39;s used in the
military is radar which is often used
for
not only tracking an object but
targeting it with an elect
system and there&#39;s this memo as you&#39;ve
seen that we put out years ago
from the fbi that was from a field agent
guy hotel
who was writing about the roswell and
the crash and
and said that it was occurred after they
switched on
a new quote radar system at roswell that
caused these objects to get scrambled
and were down
because they were in full 3d in 1947
and that was the only nuclear bomb
squadron in the world and the ets were
very concerned
about what we might do to this planet
and each other but to the to other out
in space
so that technology was developed in the
40s
and is now on its 200th generation of
refinement
and so this is a really a big national
security crisis a lot of people don&#39;t
know that
when i brief the head of the defense
intelligence agency
some years back general patrick hughes
who&#39;s a three star he had been denied
access
to these projects but when i went to the
briefing
the central purpose for the briefing was
because
he didn&#39;t know that there were covert
operations and even unacknowledged
projects within the defense intelligence
agency that were denying him information
that were targeting uh and were
working with a group to kill these
ets and their spacecraft and down them
to study them but also just an acts of
hostility
from humans towards them so i find it
very comical that the whole
media thing that&#39;s going on now with
ttsa
and also the um the new york times cnn
that you know
the release of this tic-tac footage of
our
jets chasing the these objects off the
coast of california
that in every single story without
failure
and the history channel also stories uh
and you i want you to talk about this in
a moment about italy
it has is this narrative of them being a
national security threat
when in reality these civilizations of
which there are many
are viewing our concern that humans have
become a threat
not only to life on earth which we are
we&#39;re destroying the biosphere
but also could be a threat to other
planets given the nature
of the research and development that&#39;s
happened since the time of corso
and i have many people who i&#39;m working
with who for example
have been in uh unacknowledged special
access projects even
as recently as a couple years ago and
have retired who are giving me
information on the
specifics of what these technologies are
what they can do what we&#39;re doing with
it
and it is a really it&#39;s an
unacknowledged global emergency
that threatens the peace of the earth in
peace and space
and no one is talking about that instead
they&#39;ll release a little dribble of
evidence
as just an excuse to then attach this
narrative
this false hoax narrative of an alien
threat which of course werner von braun
predicted and warned everyone about
prior to his death
and i want to hear you speak of this
recent hoax
and fraud um that&#39;s been all over the
news from this italian case that you
were there
and met the admiral and the people
involved
yeah i was really surprised i was in
italy last year
and my friends told me that the group
uh the ttsa group were invited to speak
uh at one of the conferences but instead
they stayed in the barracks they stayed
in the military barracks
and i thought why when you get to have a
room at the ritz
you know but what was happening that i
realized when i saw the last episode of
the history channel was
they were looking for specific
information to show that ets were
hostile
and one of the situations they used was
a case that uh
you know i left italy so just keep in
mind i left italy
uh permanently in 2007 so i was in touch
with everybody
there um so one of the cases they used
was a case of caronia
in sicily and caronia um had
a mystery kind of phenomenon where
there would be balls of light coming out
of the water that would interact with
the electrical appliances and the houses
will catch on fire
so i was interested in that case and i
was working with
a he wasn&#39;t an admiral then with the man
from the um navy named clara de truccio
and we were very good friends i mean
we used to go to dinner together i knew
his wife i mean
i knew him very well and before i left
he briefed me
and said caronia is a big mystery he
said because
there is uh intelligence is there
they don&#39;t hurt anybody they didn&#39;t kill
the people in the houses or the dogs or
anybody but it really mystifies us so we
had to move the people
out of the city and we have cameras
there
well last year i&#39;m watching television
the same guy
is telling our people or are the people
that are
you know were there the the ttsa people
that there was a shoot down of a
helicopter by a ufo
so i&#39;m going how can he brief me and
actually he briefed me
in the cafeteria of the naval academy
downtown rome i mean we were sitting
there talking with all these navy people
around us they weren&#39;t listening but he
wanted to tell me that it was a mystery
and then the next thing i hear there&#39;s a
shoot down of a helicopter by you
first of all why would a helic ufo shoot
down a helicopter
if people had a half a brain they&#39;d ask
themselves what is the use of shooting
down a helicopter and it wasn&#39;t even
shot down
the blades were melted the bl and the
pilot walked out
so it&#39;s the pilot isn&#39;t dead the blades
are
melted but he showed this photo
because it was proof for a lot of people
photos are proof
right so this this photo of
a ufo and the that same helicopter
and all the people in that episode are
my friends i just had dinner with them
so
they all you know some of them actually
yeah i&#39;m going to mention
names but you met about two of those
years ago when you were in calabria
right you met two of those people and
i&#39;m going
what is the purpose what is the agenda
here
because to even announce something like
that there has to be an
agenda there has to be a reason it&#39;s not
disclosure i mean are you kidding
we have disclosure i don&#39;t know where
people are coming from we&#39;ve been
talking about this for
years if people read books and get
educated if they watch we have
disclosure we don&#39;t need the president
united states saying there&#39;s ufos
or even gun camera footage i mean you
just look at clifford stone&#39;s testimony
my god
yeah so what are you this getting before
we divert
what is this so when they you know this
thing that happened with the ttsa
it seems to be a pattern whether they&#39;ll
take would be a
totally benign sort of situation create
this alarmist national security threat
attached to the supposed evidence
and that seems to be on every case they
touch
and then the new york times and the
mainstream media
and cnn and the washington post cover it
religiously and i know why that&#39;s
happening because the intelligence
community controls the big media
as we know but the question is
what actually happened in in italy
and if since you have knowledge of that
this should be
evidence of them attempting to hoax this
narrative and create this false
narrative
well you know there&#39;s an agenda and the
agenda is that they went to harry reid
they went to congress they went to marco
rubio they went to all the people
that are looking for appropriations for
uh you know the next the next card that
verner von braun talked about you know
the
the next card they had to have proof so
they used the italian case
as proof there&#39;s a photo um but
uh and it will notice unfortunately
and i don&#39;t want to go into detail
there&#39;s testing going on in the
mediterranean
and there&#39;s testing of exotic weapons so
ufos are going to be around there
watching this
well it&#39;s a little more complicated
because the intelligence i have
is that a lot of these sort of
phenomenon are related to the fact that
there may have been ufos in an area
we go in and quote exterminate them i&#39;m
using a term from a naval intelligence
person
they then set up some of these
classified
high-tech human
weapons to create phenomenon as a
decoy and then can stage things that
look
terrible and this is exactly by the way
what
i think has happened with a number of
these cases that are coming out
it&#39;s quite likely that these this tic
tac
uh object is a lockheed skunk works
experimental anti-gravity vehicle as
opposed to anything
uh extraterrestrial that has been all
over the news from the pentagon
and we also know there&#39;s a very famous
place
that fell into the hands of people in
the intelligence community
and military and paramilitary operations
like bigelow aerospace called the
skinwalker ranch
and many years ago there was some
amazing contact and phenomenon happening
there
i know people who were there when the
skin walker ranch
got embedded with counter intelligence
operatives
who then created or simulated
similar similar but not exactly the same
kind of phenomenon but in a way that
would be scary
to sort of hijack that phenomenon so
what you find
is that wherever there&#39;s a legitimate et
events happening they will then go in
and do
a destroy search and replace and replace
it with something
that our extremely high tech covert
unacknowledged
technologies will then simulate no one
in the ufo subculture is talking about
this but it makes a great deal of sense
if you&#39;re trying to create two things
one is you manifest the cover
for the real e.t stuff and cover it up
with something that you&#39;re controlling
as a human intelligence operation and
the second is
you stage it in a way that creates
phenomena that&#39;s very spooky and scary
because that will then be attributed to
the aliens quote unquote
and that&#39;s really how
counterintelligence works i think at
some point i&#39;m going to need to do a
whole
series of having dealt with everyone
from the director of the cia and army
intelligence in 92 and 93
forward of how counterintelligence works
how they hijack events or men
or hoax events that then convince
people that there is a hostile alien
presence and
the reason i&#39;m bringing this up is that
i have
been reached out to by some very senior
people
at the cia about this and i know that
there are a couple of agendas that are
being fast-tracked
with all these disclosures in the
mainstream media
and it&#39;s one of the reasons i pushed
very quickly to get close encounters
with the fifth kind out
because i know that in the midst of this
pandemic
they are doing a slow roll out
of this fake disclosure
attached to an evil alien narrative
because
that is the ultimate card that they want
to play
to unite the world around a military
fascist
junta or sort of fascistic militaristic
state
super state and that&#39;s where we&#39;re
headed if we&#39;re not careful
but i know exactly how this is being
done
what the technologies are who&#39;s doing it
where the operation centers are this is
all known to us
and it&#39;s really a shame that what you
have are you know clueless producers
with the history channel
and people who are extremely uninformed
at ttsa
the the boy i had um sort of mentored
years ago
tom delong he&#39;s a rock star guy and
he stayed here at my home and they have
all brain washed so i call it a white
brain wash they&#39;re whitewashing at the
same time brainwashing the truth
so they remove it&#39;s a search and destroy
on the what the truth is
and then spin it but then they brainwash
people
about this threat from outer space which
of course reagan spoke of at the united
nations it&#39;s in our film
but but is now what the the mainstream
media is attaching that narrative and if
you look at what
senator marco rubio said a couple weeks
ago
about the national security threat of
the ufos
so this i know and i know that chris
mellon and other people who are
associated with ttsa
who work for the pentagon and
counterintelligence
are actually the ones going up on
capitol hill doing this
so the public needs to know that there&#39;s
a rather nasty game going on than it
includes going to a place that may have
had
say ufo legitimate unusual phenomenon
and events
running off that aspect then replacing
it with something that is
very convincingly alien that
isn&#39;t that the intelligence community
controls
but then does things that are very
frightening now
to give some perspective to this i know
you weren&#39;t there
paula but in 1997 when i took um
edgar mitchell astronaut edgar mitchell
to the pentagon with me to brief
admiral tom wilson and you know there&#39;s
been the leak of those notes taken by
davis
the aerospace guy about that meeting and
everyone was so astonished that it
actually happened and that
the admiral confirmed the existence of
unacknowledged
projects i think it&#39;s kind of crazy that
people are so excited about that because
i told the public about it 20 years ago
i don&#39;t know if they thought i was
making it up or what
i don&#39;t make up stuff you know me so
here&#39;s what happened though
they ended up at this what i did at this
meeting
with you know before admiral wilson
people don&#39;t realize
the reason i was in washington was that
we had a
closed briefing with about a dozen
top secret military people coming
forward as this
early disclosure project witnesses
before it went public in 2001
for members of congress and
representative dan burton was there who
was chairman of the house
government oversight committee and
others
and this was in april of 1997.
someday we need to do a history of all
this shouldn&#39;t we absolutely
yes i know a timeline we have some
some videotapes of this whole thing
happening but
the punchline here there was a man at
the meeting
who had worked in a skiff a secure
communication
information facility skiff underground
and it was in 1974
then he was on a interagency committee
that had the ability to hit a button
boom
and what would be deployed would be
a simulated alien attack on earth
and i&#39;m quoting from this man that
everyone from the national military
command center
joint chiefs of staff and the president
on down would
absolutely believe it was e.t and it&#39;s
us
now he had he was on that committee and
i know many people who worked this
program
and that was fully operational
46 years ago in 1974.
he said it had been around quite a while
before he was there
so what people need to understand is
that we&#39;re sitting ducks here
if we don&#39;t do disclosure properly and
we must not
let the charlatans and half
demweds who are doing this fake
disclosure
attached to this alien threat narrative
hijack
everything that&#39;s been that we&#39;ve been
working for
and that&#39;s why we have to blow the
whistle on this we have to
you know it&#39;s very important that you
share that this has been a completely
distorted story about the helicopter
shoot down
and i would add that most likely
by the time that event happened this
phenomenon that was going on
was the use of very high tech
electromagnetic weapons that were human
and that that we tease can control
technologies much better than that they
don&#39;t need to accidentally set off
your a fire or fire alarm in your house
what i&#39;m pointing out is that i think
that this whole thing is a setup
and i know having been involved now for
almost 30 years
with people at the level of the cia
director
the head of army intelligence people in
these unacknowledged special access
projects
that we have had for over 50 years
the ability to completely hoax
an alien phenomenon that would scare the
begins out of everybody
it would just scare everyone to death
and it would convince
ironically the reason they keep a lot of
our senior military in the dark
is that they would be the people in
response to the counter-attack
and they don&#39;t know that these
unacknowledged special access projects
have these technologies that simulate
alien phenomena and so that&#39;s been going
on since the 50s 60s
70s this is nothing new but this one man
his information was so explosive and his
credentials were
his bona fides were impeccable
that that night he was visited by people
that had worked with him on that command
in this unacknowledged special access
project and they took him from
the westin hotel in georgetown where we
were holding these meetings
for members of congress and it was the
night before he was going to testify
and he was never heard from and seen
again he left a note
under sherry adamak&#39;s door who was my
assistant who
passed away and saying that they are
begging me not to disclose this yet that
they want a chance to get these projects
under control
first but you&#39;re doing the right thing
we have this note
and this is from a man who was in the
operations center on an interagency
committee in 1974
who could fully stage convincingly
for the whole world an alien attack the
public you need to everyone needs to
grab this clip of this youtube thing of
what i&#39;m explaining right now
and and put it viral everywhere because
the public
have to be aware of the fact that we
have the ability to host this stuff
yes and they start should start thinking
why in the world will the aliens
after all these years want to attack the
planet earth you know i wonder what
people are thinking
there&#39;s everything i mean why would they
do that why
i mean for what benefit what would they
take our groceries i mean
why would they why would they want to do
that what people
ask first what the agenda is for every
single thing that happens
as if they would ask who benefits
yes why why they&#39;re doing it um
if it has to do unfortunately this
planet is built on a war economy i mean
studying uh adamski um and he spoke
about the
1950s and 60s there was
a thought that we could have had a space
economy and would it make just as much
money
if we had gone out into outer space you
know a la star trek
you know we would not be out there and
they could have made just as much money
but
again as vernon von braun said
and and adamski also said if you have an
ore economy you have to create the wars
well you have to have a war you have to
have an enemy
and you know what they learned was that
it&#39;s a little bit like
the third reich had to put out all kinds
of blood libel
and caricatures of gay people and jewish
people
and other people that they wanted to
have the population
hate because the leaders of the third
reich and certainly this
you know ridiculous hitler character
couldn&#39;t have done that by himself so
the public had to buy in
so what what you see now 70 some years
later
is the same fascist militaristic
tendencies
trying to get the public through the
mainstream media
to buy into that narrative that there&#39;s
another new
bigger enemy well who&#39;s going to benefit
from that the military-industrial
complex
but more specifically it&#39;s not about
money it&#39;s about the control of the
population
it&#39;s about control because people can be
controlled through fear
fear exactly okay look what coronavirus
has done
the entire world shut down some
estimates 250 million people are going
to die from the shutdown
a hundred times more than would die from
the virus
in starvation all over the world so what
you have
is an attempt to impose
fascist state-controlled control
over everyone&#39;s life well if the rolling
out of a threat from
off the planet does that globally
10 times more than a pandemic will
although some of the stuff they&#39;re doing
with the pandemic may just be a beta
test
for what&#39;s coming so i think we have to
wake the planet up
and but not just be aware of the problem
be aware of the solution which is what
we started off with
based in consciousness the human heart
and spirit
making peaceful contact staying with the
truth
these are all things we have to
redouble and redouble again our effort
on because
frankly i don&#39;t think there&#39;s a whole
lot of runway
left before we run out of runway and
crash here
our civilization has got to get his act
together on these issues pretty quickly
i agree and one of the things i want to
say stephen because
because i am talking to you today is i
will never make any statements on
anything that i personally don&#39;t know
about
make statements on opinion i can&#39;t do
opinion i don&#39;t know
the italian thing i knew because i was
briefed on that
and because i was following that and
because i knew everybody on that
particular
episode i knew everyone that was there
uh
i will only make statements on things i
really know about or i&#39;ve covered
firsthand and i&#39;m one of the
only researchers that does field
research so it&#39;s not based on gossip or
what somebody said or whatever
i&#39;ve gone there i&#39;ve talked to the
witnesses i&#39;ve done
i&#39;ve done the uh the the whole
background on it
that&#39;s the only way to make an informed
opinion
yes so you have to listen to the people
and like you
that have an informed opinion based on
information not off the top of your head
or what you think
or what your system is or whatever you
i we&#39;ve talked to you and i as so many
whistleblowers
so many people who&#39;ve been involved
firsthand
and that&#39;s the only way that i could
come up with an opinion i just can&#39;t
make it out of the clear blue sky
so i don&#39;t know if you know this now we
have over 985
people like corso that have come to me
now
and some who&#39;ve been in projects much
more involved than what corso was
involved with
in the 2000s up until 2012 what have you
um and and so uh there&#39;s another whole
kind of roswell case going on from 2002
off to marianas trench off of guam uh
where we
apparently downed and retrieved a uh et
vehicle and the man who was had the top
secret clearance who was on the
retrieval vessel
is coming forward with all that
information
so we&#39;re you know there&#39;s an enormous
amount that&#39;s
i try to deal as you do with people who
were there
or they have documents i&#39;ve just
received
and i can&#39;t go into this any further the
most
singular explosive you talk about
photographs
piece of evidence and photograph in ufo
history
the provenance of which we&#39;re running
the ground right now but we it will be
released
it will rock and change everything
and so i think people need to understand
that
we have to stick with the facts but to
understand the facts in
any context you can&#39;t just stick with
the facts of what the et
experience and phenomenon and events are
you have to also equally know what
covert human capabilities are
because if you don&#39;t know what a covert
human capability is
that could simulate an et event
you&#39;re going to be confused every day
all day and i&#39;ve been saying this for
almost 30 years
that my coming of age on this because i
started out doing
ce5 contact i did i wasn&#39;t interested in
disclosure i wasn&#39;t interested in
government
i was interested in meditation and
consciousness and contact
that was the starting of the project 30
years ago this month
this is our 30-year anniversary of ce5
and i was a young doctor in my 30s and i
just thought well this time for this
because an e.t visited me and said it&#39;s
time
so i started that and of course everyone
knows that
within a couple years we had some
amazing contact events we had that event
happen in florida
near pensacola where these four et craft
appear in the sky
and ends up on the front page of the
pensacola paper the next
day and from there the head of army
intelligence is
inviting me to a meeting and basically
saying what the hell are you doing
but i think it was then that i realized
that
you know what we&#39;re doing for contact
was the thing they were most afraid of
disclosure of witnesses documents
whatever
is retrospective by nature it&#39;s people
who have been here
or this event already happen doing
something in the now
real time really now making contact
and having hundreds of thousands and i&#39;m
hoping millions of people do it
the intelligence community cannot spend
that they can&#39;t control that
this is how we take their power away my
friends
this is why i call this the ultimate act
of cosmic
civil disobedience non-violent peaceful
but it completely takes the ball out of
their court
and i tell people you&#39;re not going to do
it by mucking around
trying to find out what happened 5 10 20
70 80 years ago although it&#39;s it gives
context
the real change that&#39;s going to happen
and this is why i&#39;m
emphasizing this during this part of our
conversation
is people going out making contact
everybody i don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a truck
driver
or an agricultural worker or a rock star
or the chief of staff for the president
everyone can do this and should do it
and so then you find out for yourself
to go seeing is believing then you find
out that these civilizations are not
only very peaceful and not harmful
but actually quite enlightened and very
much versed
in consciousness and deep spirituality
and the nature of the cosmos as a
quantum
conscious beautiful universe
so that&#39;s really to me where
everything need it we need to continue
with disclosure i&#39;m still working that
and i have some people right now who are
very close to the leaders in washington
that are have reached out they&#39;re
probably the most powerful people in
washington
for me to get this correct perspective
to
the right people in washington from the
top down
and i can&#39;t say more about that but it&#39;s
an act of like this week next week
program however the real action isn&#39;t
that to me that&#39;s a public service to
whether it&#39;s a member of congress or the
president or
someone in the pentagon who is being
given wrong information
but the real action is we the people
taking responsibility for the planet
going out making contact
and creating that morphogenic field
this living field of consciousness with
that one percent effect where it shifts
all of society
that&#39;s why i love that one percent
phenomenon that we feature in the
film close encounters of the fifth kind
where you know one percent of people
meditating in a town
and crime rates go down and violence er
visits i&#39;m an emergency doctor
go down and with this coherence in the
field of consciousness
that grows by only having one percent of
the population doing that
so like in america that&#39;s about three
million people
well we should be able to find three
million people who can wake up to this
and that would transform the world&#39;s
biggest superpower
you know the message in shasta that i
got and i don&#39;t want to go into detail
was the message that i got was one
sentence if you remember
what you mean yes it will lead
we will match your efforts yes i&#39;ve said
that for years
one sentence if you and it wasn&#39;t you
me it wasn&#39;t me it was humanity if
humanity will lead
we will match your efforts it means for
every one step you take
we will help you with two steps right so
that
that what well what happened with me is
they knew i was going to start writing
they knew i was going to start speaking
they knew i was going to be responsible
it was not about me it&#39;s never been
about me uh but that was a contact
experience
where i was given that message if you
will lead we will match your efforts so
you&#39;re not alone
correct we not we aren&#39;t
really i&#39;ve gotten all along since
my first contact in 1973
when i was had just turned 18 up in the
mountains
of north carolina and they
you know a lot of people i mean everyone
from larry king to the
ci director have asked me why don&#39;t they
just land at the foot
super bowl game or at the white house
and a lot of people say
why do we have to do that i said because
we&#39;re the children of earth
they want to be partners in this but
they don&#39;t want to do something that
looks like an
alien invasion and let&#39;s face it this is
the other problem
there has been 70 years of
disinformation
and false defamation and caricatures of
ets
that everyone has has been drinking that
kool-aid
everyone the abduction groups the
mutilation groups
ufo lore hollywood movies independence
day
alien the movie on and on and on
and on and on and everyone&#39;s so totally
brainwashed
that if they were to do anything too
frontal too out there immediately the
media
and the and this these covert programs
with seizon say
see we&#39;re being invaded so look if you
know with my meager iq if i have figured
this out i tell you the et&#39;s have
figured it out
because they&#39;re cruising around with iqs
of 4500 all right
top of the scale for humans is 200. so
you know i mean so being quite blunt
about it
you know people say yeah i&#39;m like
you know a kindergartner but so i tell
people we have to understand
they uh they know the media
the environment of the earth has been
poisoned
on this subject so badly that we
humans are going to have to lead the
effort and not only making peaceful
contact
but opening up the world to their
presence in a way
that doesn&#39;t trigger this militaristic
false narrative that we see rolling out
before our eyes i mean
paul every week there&#39;s a new article in
the mainstream media
about the ufo subject with somebody in
authority
putting it in a national security threat
uh sort of paradigm and so
we&#39;re going to have to quicken and
increase our efforts obviously
well that&#39;s what i was going to ask you
what should we tell everybody
in the time remaining how can they share
the film
how can they have part in this because
it isn&#39;t just
us it can&#39;t we can&#39;t do it alone yeah
we have to have people of good will
and we need millions of them yes
millions
a responsibility right now i mean
whether they
they tell people to watch the film right
everyone walk down or can&#39;t do with
their normal stuff you know they
watch close encounters of the fifth kind
but they should also now
to get context i don&#39;t know if you know
this but a week or so ago
unacknowledged moved over off of netflix
onto
amazon prime but right now it&#39;s only
available in english-speaking countries
in a few weeks it&#39;ll be global in latin
america so anyone who has prime can see
it for free
and it&#39;s up there now and we eventually
want that to happen first
close encounters of the fifth kind we&#39;re
working as hard as i can with the
distribution company to get it
even wider so that it&#39;s everywhere
um and so what we&#39;re going to try to do
is to get both those films that are good
educational beginners points for the
masses
on every free streaming platform like
ones you don&#39;t even have to have a
subscription
for and so we&#39;re working very hard to
get that
done um and you know that&#39;s going to be
coming out more and more this fall
and but i and and i think what in the
meanwhile everyone should get
uh folks to look at both of those uh
close encounters of the fifth kind and
unacknowledged
but also get the app the app is actually
what we added to this new app it just
came out a couple months ago
is that now if you get that app if you
have a smartphone you go to
it&#39;s it&#39;s ce5 contact app you can
actually
see who&#39;s in boulder
colorado that is doing or interested in
ce5 so you can
it&#39;s kind of like a dating app where you
can hook up with them and do
go out and do a little team even with
social distancing out in the wilderness
so we have done this so that anyone in
the world
can learn the remote viewing the
meditation
the contact protocols what the
philosophy is and the intention is of
the project
but also you can then see who&#39;s in your
area
and the more people who get on there the
more people there will be to choose from
because in some areas there might be 500
people but you only want to
meet up with a few people who are on
your wavelength and that you&#39;re
harmonious with so we did that
it was a very big project to get that
feature included
and i would say rather expensive we have
to host it
we&#39;re you know have to pay a fortune to
host the
uh messaging and the maps we have to pay
monthly for that people say why is there
a charge for this app i said
we&#39;re paying a lot so that people have
that interactivity
you know people people are so naive they
think everything happens for free
it doesn&#39;t you do something like this
where you get
zillions of people using it then you&#39;re
running into
six digit expenses you know
over time so what we&#39;re trying to do
though is get it out there
so that people if you&#39;re in a remote
area
in africa you&#39;d be surprised how many
people
there are in africa that have this app
you could find someone and do an
expedition and do contact
so you&#39;re not by yourself um so
it has that feature as well as all the
educational material
it has the sanskrit puja it has the
meditation
training it has a remote view training
it has the ce5
contact protocols the equipment you may
want to have
it has all that in the app so that&#39;s
something everyone can do
and and they can do it even under you
know quarantine or whatever
you can just do it with a few people who
are in your pod as they&#39;re calling it or
friends group
and go out and do it so that&#39;s something
everyone can do
and the other thing that everyone can do
is to continue to network
this to people who can be whistleblowers
or who have information
because they need to contact us at our
website siriusdisclosure.com
and the reason for that is that you know
this
polo a lot of what i have to do i&#39;m not
allowed to talk about publicly
not because i&#39;m under any kind of
national security edict i refuse to sign
one
it&#39;s because you have to maintain
confidence when you&#39;re dealing with
people
that are very high ranking in society
but
i&#39;m putting together material for
very high ranking people actively
um and certainly before the election and
so
what we need to be able to do is get the
best of the best of that in
you know and the most current so that&#39;s
another appeal i would make to people
because if you just scratch the surface
of
programs and people who work in programs
there are tens of thousands of people
who worked in these underground
facilities over the years
and dealt with this issue and they need
to know they can come forward
confidentially
i have never violated a confidence and
get us whatever material information
documents or just
their own knowledge to us because we
really need that
not only to eventually you know educate
the public
but to educate policy makers and
decision makers
who are being inundated
with hoax material they&#39;re being
inundated
with this history channel rubbish and
ttsa
spin so that&#39;s what our leaders are
being
inundated with and it&#39;s really dangerous
so we need to do something that
is uh gets the truth to those people
well i&#39;m on my way to crestone in about
a week or so i have five
acres in crest stone that&#39;s after i did
the movie serious i went and bought land
up there and i&#39;m gonna do what i can do
on a subconscious level on another level
uh because i think we need to quiet our
minds
and and make this a serious situation
so it&#39;s like close encounters of the
third kind changed
my life and started me on this path
i i really recommend to everybody at the
movie that i love the most and that&#39;s
close encounters of the first kind
and that&#39;s where the action is people
doing it themselves
yeah well i hope to see you soon
me too we&#39;re still just so as a
programming note to everyone listening
we&#39;re still from lockdown trying to
figure out
how to do a belated party
you know we&#39;re working on it um we&#39;ve
had some false starts and then found out
we couldn&#39;t do it
so given the restrictions with kovid um
we&#39;re trying to put that together
um i know there are a number of people
who were wanting and expecting to come
certainly paula was um but as soon as we
have
uh a venue locked in
um and the it&#39;s set up so it can be safe
and
meet all the requirements of the state
local federal
uh requirements uh we&#39;ll announce that
um
if we can make it happen we&#39;re trying
very hard to do so
um i know apollo is lobbying to do it
i know i want fireworks i tell you
you don&#39;t want to hand fireworks to me
i&#39;ll blow up the stage but um
no we gotta do it big we gotta do we
could do tailgating party with fireworks
tailgating well that&#39;s the other thing
if anyone lives
in uh you know the las vegas or phoenix
area
uh who who knows of a drive-in that we
could rent for a night
we could do i like joking about the fact
because i&#39;m
you know as you know paul i&#39;m poor white
trash i grew up
north carolina with no money and living
in a shack
um a two room shack with no heat no air
conditioning
anyway um so uh drive-ins were all the
rage when i was a kid in the 60s
so now it&#39;s become the rage again you
know garth brooks is doing a whole tour
with the
driver so if anyone can help us find a
place that we could
you know just sort of rent the whole
place for a night we could set up a
stage in front of the drive-in everyone
could be in their cars
and we&#39;ll have some huge fun thing
outside
i think that&#39;s kind of what we&#39;re we&#39;re
thinking of trying to do that i think
it&#39;d be a great
deal of fun um but if anyone has a
direct way of
of finding a place for us pretty soon on
that
um obviously you know the winner is
going to be coming um
you know october november once you get
much past then it&#39;s not practical do an
outside event but
um if someone can help us find a place
um
you know uh or know knows of a really
good place and
we probably would want to have a place
that would hold 250 to 500 cars in
that range um because you get three or
four people to a car
and um it would be a fun event so um
i wanted people to know i know a lot of
people listening we&#39;re planning to come
to the premiere
um some people are going to come to the
after party um
that obviously got cancelled in april
kosokovit but um
we&#39;re trying folks so it&#39;s not that it&#39;s
we haven&#39;t forgotten about it
keep the faith i think we can do this
all right
all right thank you everyone and i
appreciate everyone
tuning in and just spread the word and
you can share this
link to this uh this interview and i
just want to thank again
paula harris who&#39;s just an amazing
researcher a brilliant mind and a great
friend thank you so much for being with
me
thank you steven anytime all right
goodbye
