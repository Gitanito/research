Foreword
The Holy Scriptures say, "And it shall come to
pass that I will pour out of my spirit upon all
flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall pro
phesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your
young men shall see visions."
These words hold a promise against which all the
gods of materialism and science, as well as the
orthodox church, have arrayed themselves in end
less though fruitless battle.
The Scripture includes "all flesh" and not just a
few chosen prophets and divines of Biblical days.
It would seem that theology, at least, would wel
come the fulfillment of the Scripture; that propn-
ecies and visions "and all manner of miracles"
would be seized upon by theologians as proof of
their religious beliefs.
But, alas, it is not so. Even though the Scrip
ture be fulfilled a thousand times a day, which it
undoubtedly is, it never will calm the wrath nor
overcome the prejudice of those who contend
against prophecies and visions. Nor will their eyes
be opened. And if they do understand the truth,
perhaps it is over optimistic to expect their agree
ment to a truth which might conflict with their
own selfish ends. And so we find that with better
visions on the part of sensitives there also comes
greater opposition by Spiritualism's opponents.
However, their is one way by which any inter
ested investigator may prove to himself Spiritual

ism's claims as to communication with those who
have passed on to the world of spirit. That method
is simply for the investigator to find out for him
self. He may examine the techniques for develop
ing mediumship as given by some of the world's
finest mediums, try their suggestions, and see
whether or not he too may fulfill the great promise.
Remember, the Scripture says —"all flesh."
The mediums who have been written about in
this book are daily endeavoring to fulfill the
promise to the best of their ability. It is not con
tended here that these are the best and most pro
ficient mediums to be found. Every individual has
his own idea on that score. However, every one
of them is a leader in the movement. Each is an
ordained minister in some branch of Spiritualism.
The attempt has been to give the reader an in
sight into a variety of mediumistic phases and their
development. There is no recommendation as to
which method of development is best, nor is there
any particular classification of methods or mediums.
Judgment in these respects is left to the reader
who finds something herein which he can use.
I wish to extend, to every medium in the book,
my most sincere appreciation for help in putting
this material into the hands of psychic students.
In every case, they have cheerfully given of their
time to help bring a greater understanding of spir
itual law to those who wish to know and use that
law. —Robert G. Chaney

Edward Lester Thorne
SlJPPOSE you are ready for your first profes
sional sitting as a clairvoyant. And your first
client is a famous movie and stage actress. And
further, suppose you are only fourteen years old!
Can you picture yourself in such a scene? To say
that you would be nervous probably is putting it
mildly. But this is the experience that Edward
Lester Thorne, famous New York City medium, had
when he began sitting in Hollywood, California.
His first client was Marie Dressier!
Since that time, Mr. Thorne has demonstrated
his mediumship thousands of times. He has be
come famous throughout the world. He left Holly
wood long ago, and is now pastor of the United
Spiritualists' Church, 41 West 73rd Street, New
York.
I asked Mr. Thorne if he was frightened when he
had this first sitting with Marie Dressier.
"To me it has always been a perfectly natural
procedure. I played with spirit children as far

back as I can remember," was his answer.
This probably explains much of the success that
Mr. Thorne has had in mediumship. His constant
contact with spirit people through the years has
made it seem just the normal thing with him.
This has enabled him to be relaxed whenever he
makes such contact, and relaxation and spiritual
poise are necessary attributes in becoming at
tuned to the world of spirit. This relaxation he
has demonstrated upon thousands of cases, like the
time he sat for Dunninger the mentalist, the staff
of the Scientific American magazine, Life magazine
photographers and several reporters. But more of
this story later.
Mr. Thome's first manifestations of spirit came
to him when he was just five years old. At that
time he predicted the passing of his father. It
occurred in just the manner and time which he
had predicted.
In many families this would have been judged
a most unusual incident. There would have been
worries about the sanity, if not the sanctity, of a
youngster who was possessed with such powers.
But Mr. Thorne came from a family of Spiritualist
people, well acquainted with the workings of spir
it manifestations. His grandmother was Amelia
Cane, a well known and well loved medium of her
time. In fact her work was so prominent that she
achieved outstanding recognition as a medium. So
actually he was "brought up" in the work.
As he grew older, his psychic experiences con
tinued. Visions came to him and he heard voices

speak to him as well as experiencing many instan
ces of inspiration and impression. However, his
development was not unduly rushed and he con
tinued his work privately until he was fourteen.
At that age he began to sit for the public. He was
so successful in these sittings that his mother de
cided he should travel with his work. She felt that
coming in touch with this young worker would be
an inspiration to many others throughout the coun
try, as well as being of a convincing nature to
investigators.
Thome and his mother then toured the United
States from coast to coast and made many trips in
to Canada. If you were at all interested in psychic
things at that time, you probably heard of him. He
was known as "The Boy With a Thousand Eyes."
Many people unfold their mediumship by sitting
in a class guided by a developed teacher. But
mediumship was so strongly born into Mr. Thome's
family that he never sat in a developing class at all.
It just came naturally to him and always seemed
a part of his life. As time went on, other phases of
mediumship besides clairvoyance and clairaudience
came to him. He is now a billet reader, trumpet
and materialization medium, and does excellent
work in slate writing. However, his most out
standing phases are in the mental mediumship
category.
Of couse each medium has his own method of
development which he passes on to his students.
These methods differ just as all teachers differ in
every type of education. Mr. Thorne feels that stu-

dents pay too much attention to concentration and
not enough to relaxation. He says that concentra
tion is a very important aspect of development, but
that he has found relaxation to be even more im
portant.
To his way of thinking, relaxation is a science in
itself. It is difficult to the extreme, and comes
only with constant practice. Relaxation means
more than just lessening the tension of bodily mus
cles. There is a mental relaxation which is even
more important.
Most important to body relaxation is the proper
posture. The state of the body reacts upon the
mind in many different stimuli which keep the
mind from its proper relaxation. It is therefore
necessary to find a posture which will shut off these
stimuli entirely.
Some teachers of psychic development give their
students as many as seventy-five different postures.
But Mr. Thorne has found that there are a few
basic ones which will help the student attain the
relaxation necesary to mediumship.
The easiest method is to He down, arms extended
along the side of the body, feet close together. In
this posture quick and complete relaxation is
possible.
Different students find that different postures are
more suitable, and some have had the best results
with the Buddhic or mystic position. In this pos
ture the student sits erect, then places the left foot
against the right thigh. The right foot is inserted
under the left shin and against the left thigh. At

first this will seem a difficult position, but those who
practice it find that it soon becomes a natural and
easy one and makes for complete relaxation.
Another posture is to sit erect in a straight chair,
but do not touch the back rest. Let the feet be
close together and flat on the floor. Rest the hands
on the knees. This is the most common posture
used by students in the development of clairvoy
ance, clairaudience and the physical phases of
mediumship.
It will require months of practice, perhaps years,
to attain the ability to relax properly through the
use of these postures. But after you have at
tained it you can practice at any time of the day
and in other postures. Even standing in a street
car or at your kitchen sink or at your work, you
can spend a few seconds in practice. After all, you
will have to demonstrate your mediumship under
all sorts of conditions and relaxation always must
be used. You will be able to do it with increasing
speed as you continue your practice so that eventu
ally you can accomplish it in just a second's time.
When the body is completely relaxed you must
begin doing the same with the mind. Mental re
laxation can be practiced along with that of the
body.
At first, your mind will be filled with all sorts of
intruding thoughts. The memory of some pleasing
incident in your life will control the mind, or some
worry or fear will fight for attention. Some phys
ical pain of your body may send its sensation to the
mind. Any one of a million thoughts will try to

jump into the mental spotlight.
But the mind must be brought under control.
It must master itself. It must fail to recognize any
stimuli which come from the body or any outward
physical cause. It must make itself receptive only
to those influences which come from the world of
spirit. A complete blackout of all physical stimuli
must be accomplished. This, too, requires hours
and days and years of practice. The mind must be
freed from physical captivity and allowed to at
tune itself to the stimuli of spiritual nature.
Cutting the mind off from the physical world,
you fail to think of yourself as the person of your
name. The mind comes into the consciousness of
being pure spirit, existing on a spiritual plane, at
tuned only to that plane and its residents.
Mr. Thorne believes that if students will prac
tice relaxation every day they will find their de
velopment progressing at a much faster pace. He
asks all his personal students not to rely upon con
centration alone. Sitting and concentrating, by
themselves, do not bring mediumship. The stu
dent must make his entire body and mind receptive
to the slightest impulses which may be coming to
them, and this is best done through relaxation.
Mr. Thorne has an encouraging word to psychic
students everywhere. "What God has given to one
of His children, He can and will give to another."
This is a fundamental truth, alive with inspira
tion for all of us. Psychic students the world over
can look at the great mediums such as Mr. Thorne
and know that they, too, are capable of reaching

the same heights of God-given power.
He feels that all seekers of psychic development
should conduct their search only upon high levels
of spiritual thought. The power of mediumship is
a grand one, deserving of the very highest and best
that any person can give to it.
"Patience and sincerity of purpose are essential,"
are the words in which he puts it.
Mr. Thorne believes that most people are too
impatient. "Of course," he admits, "mediumship
is well worth being impatient for, but it cannot be
bought in that or any other way. A student must
not consider time the important factor. Unfold-
ment cannot be rushed, and our spirit friends will
'supply' the necessary power when they feel we can
spiritually absbrb it."
There are some people who might say that this
is easy advice for Mr. Thorne to give, having been
born into mediumship, but that it is something
which he has not had to experience for himself.
But from the age of five until he was fourteen, he
was sitting constantly to develop his mediumship
to greater proficiency. In other words he gave at
least nine years of everyday practice and meditation
to his work before he made any public appearances.
This was not just once a week class work. This
was every day practice. When one who has come
by mediumship as naturally as he has is willing to
devote nine years to further development, then it
is an inspiration to the rest of us to continue with
greater singleness of purpose and diligence.
Even now, Mr. Thome's entire time is devoted to

helping humanity. The number of people he sees
every year goes into the thousands, leaving him
little time for recreation or social life. This is one
of the penalties of fame, and the reward of being
a proficient workman in his chosen profession.
Mr. Thorne demonstrated his proficiency as a
medium, and incidentally his aptness at his own
doctrine of relaxation, when he conducted a sitting
for Joseph Dunninger, the famous stage and radio
mentalist.
Mr. Dunninger, members of the Scientific Amer
ican staff, the Life staff, radio commentators and
reporters from the newspapers witnessed the dem
onstration. There were over twenty investigators
present to see what a psychic could do that might
be beyond the realm of "natural" explanation.
Blank white cards were given to Mr. Dunninger
who examined them thoroughly. Then the cards
were placed between thick sheets of glass and
sealed with adhesive tape. After a few moments
wait, the word "Bottleneck" appeared, and under
it was the signature of Sir Oliver Lodge.
The word "Bottleneck" seems rather a ridicu
lous one to appear as a message from the world of
spirit. But actually it was a bit of very conclusive
evidence of continuing intelligence after death, and
was of great significance to Mr. Dunninger. That
word was one of a four word sentence contained
in a sealed envelope in the vault of the Scientific
American office.
The four words in this sealed envelope were
written by Sir Oliver Lodge before his death!

This entire demonstration was carried on in full
light. It required a proficiency of relaxation and
mediumship to perform it before the questioning
eyes that were present. You may have seen pic
tures of this event in Life magazine.
All of us have dreams of demonstrating medium-
ship in instances of this type, but we must realize
that it takes years of constant struggle, patience
and willingness to serve before we can attain such
great heights.
But the years of work have had their reward in
inner satisfaction. Upon many occasions, Mr.
Thorne is told that he has saved some person from
committing suicide, or from breaking up a home,
or from following a wrong path in life.
Opportunities for service are about equally di
vided between saving people from taking the wrong
path and getting others started on the right one.
Thousands of people owe their start toward hap
piness to his mediumship. Other thousands owe
honor to that same mediumship for the fact that
they have been saved from inflicting personal in
jury to their own souls.
For over thirty years Mr. Thorne has been using
his mediumship as a means of bringing comfort,
happiness and guidance to a hungering humanity.
As one of the workers of the General Assembly of
Spiritualists, he has brought a new light and under
standing to many faltering minds.
A glance at his church calendar will quickly show
you that he has not much time for anything out
side his chosen work in spiritual religion. Six days

a week he serves church and the thousands who
attend his services. In addition to this, much of
his time is taken with private consultations. Any
time left over is given to study, and further de
velopment of his psychic powers. But, in spite of
all the demands which are made upon his time and
energy, he is happy in the knowledge that he is
being of service to others.
He urges those who are so inclined to pursue
their search for mediumship development with un
tiring will. There is a greater need for medium-
ship today than at any time in the history of man
kind. Literally millions of souls are wandering the
earth in darkness. They need the light of psychic
science to guide them. That light can be given to
them only through human instruments who them
selves are living symbols of its great benefits.
Mr. Thorne says that his mediumship has
brought home to him a greater spiritual realization
of that simple but sublime measurement of mankind
—the Golden Rule. He feels that man should
practice it and not just speak it. He says that it
is for every individual, and not just for the "other
fellow." To him it is the most reasonable guide
that any person can follow.
"It is the one bit of doctrine that has been woven
into the fabric of every religion that man has ever
known," says Mr. Thorne.
He believes that the rest of us will find rich inner
rewards if we will only give of ourselves in service
to others.

II
Bertie Lilly Candler
AlTHOUGH you may not believe it, Bertie Lilly
Candler was afraid of the first spirit she ever saw.
But this is understandable because she was only
six years old at the time.
Many children who see spirit people at such an
early age lose their mediumship as they grow older,
but Bertie Lilly's continued to develop until today
she is the happy possessor of many phases of mental
and physical mediumship. When she was a little
girl, however, she had only the clairvoyant phase
and she always was frightened whenever a spirit
would appear to her. She didn't know what they
were, but was old enough to realize that they were
not earthly human beings. Her fear was caused
more by not knowing just what she saw than by
the actual sight itself. And so it is with most of us.
She was unable to get much help in understand
ing the visions which came to her. So for years
she continued to see spirit people and to be afraid
of them and what they might mean. Although of
course they meant her no harm whatsoever, hers

were many years of terror at the "spectres" which
she saw. But she had the courage to continue her
search to find out the meaning of these visions and
her mediumship developed into an outstanding one.
One of the greatest experiences of Bertie Lilly's
life came when she was in her teens. She still did
not know about Spiritualism and the many possibil
ities and useful truths which it contains. One day
she saw a vision. A spirit appeared before her and
began to talk to her.
"Your brother, Howard, is going to pass out on
the sixth of December at 7 :45 a.m.
" this spirit said.
Her brother was alive and well. She couldn't
understand why these words were spoken to her.
The spirit disappeared without another word.
At 7:45 on the sixth of December Howard passed
away.
Three weeks later he appeared to her! And he
began to speak—
"Tell mother not to grieve. I am happy and
living over here," were his words.
Howard's was the first death in her family, and
of course it was a great shock. But his appearance
to Bertie Lilly and the words he spoke were a com
fort which gave new hope to the family. But still,
it was a voice from the unknown and was not
understandable.
Then Bertie Lilly went to her minister. She was
a Methodist and thought that the pastor of her
church might be able to help her. He gave her as
liberal and understanding an answer as any ortho
dox minister could.

the Lord has sent His angel to guard you in the form
of your brother."
But this answer did not satisfy her. She felt
there must be some further explanation of such
phenomena. So she left the church and continued
her search for truth in other channels. Her
brother's coming to her took away some of the
fear that had been with her for so many years.
He was someone she knew and could recognize
and trust. She knew that he wouldn't come to
her if it was wrong or something to fear. She
searched until she learned about Spiritualism and
mediumship. Howard continued to come to her,
and today he is her main guide.
Bertie Lilly Candler is best known for her work
as a materialization medium. She has other
phases, too. Trance, trumpet and indepen
dent voice. She has practiced her mediumship
since 1919. She is a member of the International
General Assembly of Spiritualists, and since 1927
has been pastor of the Beckoning Light Church in
Miami, Florida.
When I asked her what suggestions she would
offer to students who are sitting for development,
she replied that, "First of all, a person seeking
development should study under a good teacher."
She feels that the guidance obtained in this way
will shorten the time of development by years.
She did not have the opportunity of sitting in a
developing class during much of her own unfold-
ment period. She was forced to learn many

tilings for herself which might have been given
to her much more quickly through the experience
of a competent teacher. Even after she had ob
tained much of her mediumship, she was so anxious
for class work that she did not at all mind sitting
with people who were not nearly as advanced in
the work as she was. It was during this period
that she sat in a class conducted by Mable Riffle,
whom she considers an outstanding teacher of
physical mediumship.
"But there is much more to it," she said, "than
just sitting in class." In the first place, a per
son's desire for mediumship should be activated
by the right motive. Mediumship for selfish gain
is as great a sin as violation of any of the Com
mandments. She believes that those who always
try to do the right thing and live a clean life will
find that a better mediumship will be their reward.
Bertie Lilly Candler is enthusiastic about the
possibilities of mediumship which have not as yet
been tapped. She knows, through her own exper
iences, that there is a great field for workers in
Spiritualism; that many localities suffer from a
lack of properly trained sensitives. Because of
her understanding of this need, she was glad to
offer her suggestions to those who are attempt
ing to develop materialization as their phase of
mediumship.
The development of trance mediumship is the
first step in attaining the phase of materialization.
The sitter should use the usual materialization

across a corner of the seance room so as to open in
the center. At least one other person should be
in attendance outside the cabinet. A larger group
will assist in furnishing a greater power with
which to produce the manifestation.
The student must sit inside the cabinet in a re
laxed state, entirely unconscious of his own body
or mental emotions. In entering the trance state,
some of her own students have had the
sensation of sinking, as though going down in
water. Others seem to contract their objective
consciousness within themselves, and some seem to
rise above their bodies or walk out of them. You
may recognize any of these sensations from your
experiences in development.
"Losing yourself in trance is of prime impor
tance to the student who is trying to develop ma
terialization," says Bertie Lilly Candler. The
student actually must lose his own consciousness
in entering the trance state. This enables the
spirit operators to control the manifestation to the
fullest extent.
Do not be afraid of allowing the guides to con
trol you. The law of attraction is such that you
will attract to yourself guides who are of a charac
ter and ability comparable to your own. Like
attracts like, good is attracted to good and bad to
bad. If you have lived so that you have attracted
to yourself guides of a high standard of character,
then you have nothing to fear at all. These guides
return to you for the purpose of manifesting
through you. and helping other spirit people to do

so. They are trained for it, and will see that no
harm comes to you.
In entering trance, breathing is important. The
breath should be even and regular, not forced in
any way. A rhythmic breathing exercise should
be practiced regularly. Mentally, you can direct
the breath to the psychic centers of the body which
correspond in location to the physical glands. The
best point of concentration for this life essence of
the breath is near the solar plexus region.
After you have directed the breath to this region
for a few moments, then sit relaxed and await the
sensations previously mentioned. A word of warn
ing is important here. Do not overdo the exercise
of directing the breath. This is nothing to play
with. Though you may not realize it, you are
dealing with a powerful force when you direct the
psychic qualities of the air to a psychic center.
If overdone, harmful and even disastrous stimula
tion of a psychic nature might result. It is similar
to electricity. Controlled in the wires of our
homes it is of much benefit to us. But uncon
trolled as in lightning, or in a short circuit, it is an
agent of destruction.
Materialization of the spirit body is produced
from a substance known as ectoplasm. Ecto
plasm is the spiritual counterpart of protoplasm,
of which your physical body is formed. Spirit
operators use the ectoplasmic body of the medium,
and spirit people materialize to your sight through
its use. This accounts for the fact that there are
times when the materialized spirit has some of the

medium's features, just as the Christ looked like
the gardener to Mary when she first saw him.
The ectoplasmic body exists in the inter-cellular
spaces of the medium's body. In vibration it is
halfway between physical and spiritual. It is
physical enough to be seen by the physical eye
And spiritual enough to be used by a spirit person.
The medium must project this ectoplasmic body
from his own in order that its substance might be
used by the spirit. It is further drawn by the
magnetism of the sitters. Then the spirit is
clothed with astral substance, drawn from all the
physical substance in the room, such as the sitters'
clothing, furniture, flowers, and so on.
As ectoplasm is affected by the physical body of
the medium, Bertie Lilly Candler recommends that
every student of materialization be especially care
ful in caring for his body. In general, ordinary
rules of diet should followed. However, she be
lieves that those foods which partake less of a
physical nature are most beneficial. Of course this
should not be carried to extremes so that loss of
physical energy results.
A materialization medium needs a great deal of
energy. The drain and strain on his body is un
usually high. Mediums of this type have been
placed on scales and their weight checked while
a spirit is manifesting through their mediumship.
They have become lighter by as much as twenty-
five pounds! Taking substance of this weight
from the medium cannot help but cause much
strain and loss of energy.

Proper exercise also is necessary. Bertie Lilly
likes to play golf. There are several reasons lot
her preference for this kind of exercise besides pure
enjoyment of the game and the physical exercise it
affords. In the first place it takes you out of doors
where you can breathe the purest of air. Taking
in this air helps to fill your body with all the psy
chic energy which the air contains. And then it
brings you in close contact with the ground, from
which you can assimilate a certain type of magnet
ism helpful to the manifestation of materialization.
The taking in of these substances is done without
conscious effort on your part. The body simply
recharges itself when coming in contact with them.
Bertie Lilly Candler first became interested in
Spiritualism in 1918. She was living in Cincinnati,
Ohio, at the time. One night her sister-in-law ap
peared to her in a vision. The sister-in-law was
living in the deep south, and Bertie Lilly did not
even know she had been ill.
She later learned that the sister-in-law had
passed away on the afternoon of the same day she
appeared in the vision. Just before her passing
she spoke to those who had gathered about her
bedside.
"I want to see Bertie Lilly," was the last sentence
she spoke on this earth!
It was at this time that Spiritualism first offered
itself as a possible explanation for all the visions
and voices she had seen and heard. She became
vitally interested in the movement, began attending
services and seances, and then sat in a home de

veloping circle. The third time this circle met, she
went into a trance. This was something new to
her, different than the other manifestations which
she previously had, and she continued her investi
gation and development. It seems as though she
was destined to become a materialization medium,
for she would not stop her search for an understand
ing of the phenomena.
It was just a year later, in 1919, that she began
her public career. She worried lest people would
not believe the things which she told them she saw.
But when they did believe, and recognized the mes
sages which she gave to them, she was thrilled
And who wouldn't be?
Aside from her golf, her only other hobby is in
doing charitable work. She realizes that everyone
has not had the same opportunities here on earth,
and that others have not been able to take advan
tage of the opportunities they did have. So she tries
to make it all up to them somehow. She looks
back to the time when she knew nothing at all
about Spiritualism and sees the difficulties and
problems which were in her mind. When she can
help another to solve his problems, she is happy.
After twenty-seven years of constant work in
Spiritualism you would think that a person would
take it more or less for granted. But Bertie Lilly
Candler is just as enthused about the movement
and the manifestations today as she was back in
1919 when she gave her first public demonstration.
To her, Spiritualism means more than just the
manifestations of spirit people. There is a deeper

side to the religion than just the proof of immortal
ity. She feels that many of the teachings should
be broadcast to the world in such fashion as to
make it impossible for the world to ignore them.
The teachings of the Master, in her opinion, are
the basis upon which every student should build
his life. She says that one of the greatest helps to
mediumship is in living in accordance with the
principles which he brought to earth. The render
ing of service to others helps build in every person
a philosophy which will stand him in good stead
when practicing his mediumship. The practice of
mediumship is not entirely a bed of roses for any
one, no matter how gifted he may be. This fact is
easily seen in the example which the Master set
for us so many years ago. It was the philosophy
which his service to others brought to him that
sustained him when in need.
She also believes that every medium should al
ways be trying to perfect his mediumship to a
greater degree. He should constantly strive to
reach out for the highest and best that is obtainable.
She believes there are many master souls who
are anxious for instruments through which they
might manifest to people of earth. They are look
ing for instruments of high purpose and character.
They have great truths which will be of unbounded
help to mankind, but those truths will remain un
told until the development of psychic ability
reaches that high standard upon which they can be
brought through. Perhaps you will be one of those
given the opportunity to serve in this way.

Ill
James M. Laughton
PeOPLE who have heard James M Laughton
speak and give spirit messages before congregations
numbering up to one thousand people would never
believe that at one time he was too shy to go be
fore only thirty persons. But it is true. In fact
Mr. Laughton says that overcoming shyness was
his greatest obstacle in the early days of his me
diumship!
You never would suspect it now. Whenever he
is before a congregation he is the very picture of
poise and self-confidence. I asked him what he did
to overcome this shyness.
His reply was short and to the point. In fact
it was just one word. "Practice."
"Shyness," he went on to say, "and nervousness
are, in my opinion, two of the great drawbacks for
many developing mediums who are just starting
to give messages. They are too nervous to appeal
before an audience. This keeps them from prac
ticing their mediumship, which is a talent that must

be exercised the same as any other."
Those who are afflicted with these difficulties
(and who is not?) may take both comfort and
courage in knowing that Mr. Laughton had the
same troubles to overcome. He found it necessary
to battle with himself to get up enough courage to
go before a few people and give messages. But he
wouldn't give up. The thrill which came to him
at being able to express to others what he had
received in a clairvoyant vision, or heard clair-
audiently, acted as a prod which made him go back
time after time in spite of his shyness.
"If you are shy or nervous," Mr. Laughton
counsels, "do not let it master you. Within your
self you have the ability to overcome these things.
In fact, you must overcome them if you wish to
become a good message bearer for the world of
spirit. Be determined that you are going to do
your best, that you will conquer all shyness with
in yourself. When you get into your work on the
platform you will forget yourself and your shyness
and will think of nothing except the messages you
are receiving."
Mr. Laughton says that being nervous just be
fore conducting a message service is a common
phenomenon among even the best of mediums
But by just going ahead their nervousness disap
pears when they begin their work. So if you are
being held back from speaking or giving messages
because of your nervousness, just go ahead with
determination. This takes courage, of course, but
if you have the desire within you, you will be able

to summon up the courage.
It is only by constant practice that you acquire
the poise necessary to conduct a polished service.
This gives you the ability to project yourself and
your personality out to the audience. It gives you
an easy flow of language and the ability to express
yourself, and the visions you are seeing, in a man
ner which is pleasing to your listeners. Mr.
Laughton recommends that you practice before
small groups such as found in the usual developing
class. He suggests that you stand before the class
just as though you were giving messages in church
and try to give messages to your classmates. A
good working knowledge of the English language
will help give you confidence in your ability to
express yourself. This should be studied anyway,
for your audiences will be made up of intelligent
people who are looking at you as the representative
of Spiritualism. The use of poor English will not
be very impressive to them. You must have such
a command of the language that you can express
yourself properly without even stopping to think
about it. It must become second nature to you.
Before large groups everywhere, Mr. Laughton
demonstrates his mediumship phases of clairvoy
ance, clairaudience, trumpet, independent voice and
inspirational speaking. He says that our spirit
teachers cannot always tell in advance just what
phase the student will develop at first. In his
experience, however, even the physical mediums
have developed mental phases such as clairvoyance
before any of the other phases.

Mr. Laughton is well known for his trumpet and
independent voice work. Dr. James and Judy, his
main trumpet guide and little girl messenger guide
have spoken to thousands of people. They have
brought words of comfort, of instruction, of encour
agement and of spiritual wisdom to many who were
in need of them. But in spite of the wonderful
manifestations which take place in his trumpet
circles, he believes that this mediumship can be
developed to an even greater degree. He says, "I
do not feel that any of the various phases are ever
complete in their development."
These words very well express his thought on
the subject. No one, he feels, ever has reached the
ultimate in mediumship. No matter what great
manifestations may take place through any person's
mediumship, he is capable of demonstrating even
greater as his development continues. Mr. Laugh-
ton himself devotes a regular time to the further
development of the phases which he now possesses.
Mr. Laughton reports that some people have said
to him, "I have been sitting in class for over ten
years and still cannot give a message." He says
that the reason for this is that probably they have
done nothing except sit in class, perhaps but once
a week or less. In developing mediumship, the
student must practice every day if possible. How
ever, the student should not be promiscuous in this
practice. The corner drug store or the cash regis
ter line in the super market are not the places
where mediumship should be practiced. It is best
done in the home with a friend or member of the

family for a subject. But practice of some kind
is necesary, just as it is necessary for a pianist to
practice the piano—every day.
And here Mr. Laughton makes a very good point
which many students fail to realize. "Music is not
in the piano alone." The artist at the keyboard is
as much a part of it as the piano itself. And me-
diumship is not only in the mechanics of the mani
festations but also is in the guides and teachers and
in the medium himself. In mediumship, all are
blended into one, and practice is necessary so that
a harmonious blending will make for the best re
sults. This sort of thing does not bloom overnight
It is only the result of constant practice.
In sitting for trumpet and independent voice
Mr. Laughton suggests that your class group of two
or more persons be assembled regularly, at least
once a week if at all possible. Between classes
you may be able to sit with members of your family
at home.
Place the trumpet in the center of the room,
either standing on the floor or laying on a table.
Open the circle with a prayer and a hymn. This
hymn should be one that attunes the members of
the class to a spiritual vibration. Then Mr.
Laughton advises that each person speak aloud the
names of his guides. Of course when you are sit
ting with an already developed medium this is not
so necessary, but sometimes it is advisable even
then. The reason for this is that it makes a vi
bratory attunement between each member of the
class and the guides who come to him.

The first demonstrations will be raps on the
trumpet. This shows that enough power has been
generated for the beginnings of manifestations.
When these raps are heard it indicates that you
have the attributes necessary for the development
of physical mediumship. The continuance of these
raps may take place for some time before other
demonstrations are made. But even a rap, coming
from the world of spirit, is cause for joy and thank
fulness. Though your circle may continue for
months without any other manifestations, do not
be discouraged, and above all do not show dis
pleasure. Keep such thoughts as far from your
mind as you possibly can. And it is possible for
you to eliminate them entirely.
If development continues, the next manifestation
will be either levitation of the trumpet or the faint
sound of voices coming through the trumpet.
Sometimes the trumpet will stay in place, but it
will rock back and forth. You will be able to hear
this in the dark, and will know that an attempt at
levitation is being made.
The voices may not be understandable at first,
so faint will they be. But as unfoldment goes on
they will become louder. It requires much time
for the controlling spirits to become accustomed to
their work, to be able to draw more of the necessary
strength, and to learn all the laws governing such
a manifestation.
Here is another word of advice from Mr.
Laughton. He suggests that you use the same
room for every sitting if possible. The reason for

this is so that acoustics and psychic properties and
conditions will remain the same on every occasion
The spirit guides have a difficult time of it at best
even when working with fully developed mediums,
and if you can keep the earthly conditions exactly
the same every time it will free them from making
unnecessary changes in spirit conditions at every
sitting.
Mr. Laughton, whose mediumship has been bring
ing comfort and inspiration to people for over six
teen years, had one of his first experiences with it
when he was nine years old. He lived in Brandon.
Manitoba, Canada. At that time, of course, he
knew nothing about Spiritualism. But he saw a
vision in which a little girl was lying in her casket
Then the vision seemed to expand and he could see
that it was in a church. At one side of the scene
the minister was giving the funeral sermon. He
then was shocked to. notice that the little girl was
someone he knew, one of his playmates, and the
daughter of the minister.
Six months later the little girl, who was well at
the time of the vision, died of scarlet fever! She
was buried from the same church that he saw in
his vision, and her father preached the funeral
sermon.
Previously, James had told the minister about
his vision. And when the incident really came to
pass, the minister remembered the prophecy that
James had given him. Of course he was very
interested, and called James to his study many
times to ask him if he had had any more visions

He always gave James a quarter on these visits
because he did not want him to tell any other per
son about them.
Mr. Laughton's first interest in Spiritualism came
after he had moved to Detroit, Michigan. He had
told a friend of the many premonitions which had
come to him through his childhood. Unknown to
Mr. Laughton at the time was the fact that this
friend was a Spiritualist. The friend recognized
the possibilities of mediumship in Mr. Laughton and
told him that he was mediumistic. Being a Pres
byterian, Mr. Laughton disagreed with his friend,
but he did accept an invitation to attend a Spiritu
alist church.
When he heard the medium giving messages, he
realized that he had been having similar experi
ences all along without knowing just what they
were. His interest was kindled immediately, and
he began sitting in class in order to obtain proper
guidance for further development. His first class
work was with Veda Hauxwell, a trance medium.
Later he sat in class with the famous Etta S.
Bledsoe. It was under her instruction that he de
veloped his trumpet mediumship. He began giving
public message services when he was only sixteen
years old!
Since that time he has travelled throughout the
United States conducting Spiritualist services, giv
ing messages and holding trumpet circles. He is a
member of the Spiritualist Episcopal Church, and
is the pastor of a large church in Detroit. Little
did he dream, when he was sixteen, that in time he

would appear regularly before hundreds of people
every Sunday night.
To him, the greatest thrill of his mediumship
happens annually each year on Etta Bledsoe Day at
Camp Chesterfield, in Indiana. Naturally, having
attained much of his development under Mrs. Bled
soe, one of the leading workers in Spiritualism for
many years, Mr. Laughton feels a very close spirit
ual attunement to her. She was one of those who
helped encourage him in his early mediumship.
She used to have him come to her home in Detroit
and practice his message work so as to improve his

he overcome his natural shyness before audiences,
and gave him the opportunity to demonstrate his
mediumship before many of the large congregations
which came to hear her. To Mrs. Bledsoe, Mr.
Laughton always was "My Jimmie." He was a
spiritual son to her.
He is eternally grateful to her for all the wonder
ful ways in which she hedped him and is happy
beyond measure that he now can serve as the in
strument for her returning to earth to speak and
give messages once more as she used to do for so
many years. She does this in public every year at
Camp Chesterfield, through his mediumship, on the
day that is set aside in her honor. As high as two
thousand people have gathered to witness this great
demonstration of mediumship. Hundreds of people
who heard Mrs. Bledsoe when she was on earth say
there is no denying her return, for her inimitable
personality and style of speaking are unmistakably

Much sustaining philosophy has come to Mr.
Laughton through his mediumship and the practice
of it. That the soul of man is immortal is a won
derful beginning for any philosophy, and Spiritual
istic phenomena is as much proof of that fact as it
is possible to obtain.
Mr. Laughton also finds in Spiritualism that
which sustains a person through all sorts of dif
ficulties and sorrows. He says, "I have found that
many of our sorrows and struggles here on earth
only mellow the human heart, and they often help
us the better to understand our fellowman. He
has problems, too, and we can be of greater ser
vice to him when we have experienced these things
ourselves." Mr. Laughton is sure that, no matter
how great the problem is that faces us here, we
may expect and actually receive help from the un
seen. The unseen is not necessarily the unknown.
"Though there are many things we would like
to have here on earth, we must remember that we
pass through this life quickly and probably will
have them over on the other side. In that plane
of existence, we will receive a greater unfoldment
and find a greater freedom of expression than could
possibly be ours here on earth."

IV
Bertha R. Marx
Most mediums are nailed to a cross several
times during their lives. Bertha Marx is no ex
ception, and except for the understanding and faith
of her husband, Curtis, she never would have
become a medium.
Her mother passed to the world of spirit in 1925.
Mrs. Marx was thoroughly depressed by this oc
currence. Then her husband told her that mother
was not dead; that she simply had passed on to a
more beautiful sphere of existence. He also told
her that if she would make it possible her mother
could return to her.
Mr. Marx said, "Mother is nearer to you now
than she ever has been before. The frail little
physical body which you knew as mother was only
a cloak which she wore. She has discarded it now,
and has stepped into the next room."

The words which most intrigued Mrs. Marx were.
"She can return to you if only you will make it
possible for her to do so." So she set about dis
covering the laws which might help her mother to
return.
She remembered having seen vague forms and
heard faint voices when she was a child. She re
membered her family telling her it was only a vivid
imagination. She remembered having prophetic
dreams which worked out just as she had seen them.
But this was in the dim past and had been shut out
of her life for more than fifteen years. However,
the things Mr. Marx told her struck a responsive
chord in her mind and she determined to find out
whether she still could talk to her mother or not.
Being urged and encouraged by Mr. Marx, she
began sitting for her own psychic unfoldment.
She sat with Russell Waldorf, of Springfield, Ohio,
for the development of trance mediumship. This
is when the opposition began to marshal their
forces and leap to the attack. Some of her relatives
were very much opposed to her psychic investiga
tion. They warned her that she surely would lose
her mind if she continued her attempts to talk to
her dead mother. Her friends, too, looked with
much disfavor upon the proceedings and did not
hesitate to speak to her about it. They told her
she was being hoodwinked, that it was impossible
for the dead to speak to those who are left behind.
The pastor of her church told her that mediums
were in league with the devil and that the imps of
Satan would torment her and drag her into the

depths of hell where she would burn eternally. In
the face of all this opposition, she was urged on
ward by Mr. Marx and continued the redevelop
ment of the mediumship which was hers in child
hood.
Her mediumship has become a fine one, and for
over ten years she has been demonstrating various
phases of it—clairvoyance and clairaudience,
trance, direct voice, healing and billet reading.
Her mediumship has meant much to the many
people who have come to her for comfort, inspi
ration and spiritual instruction.
In giving advice to students, Mrs. Marx always
says that the mind, the body and the soul should
be made clean channels through which the spirit
may manifest. All these three parts of the earthly
human being are tools with which the spirit works
in producing spiritual manifestations. To place
less than the best at the spirit's disposal is to fall
short of the medium's duty in the opinion of Mrs.
Marx. She does not believe that the search for
mediumship is something which should be indulged
in merely as a pastime. In sitting for development,
you are working with powerful forces which can
not be tampered or played with.
An earnest and sincere desire, within the stu
dent, for the right kind of mediumship is necessary
before that mediumship can be obtained. She says,
"Mediumship is a great gift. It is entrusted to you
to use not so much for your own good as for the
good of those with whom you come in contact.

"Remember, we get out of mediumship just what
we deserve. There is no place in it for doubt, or
for criticism of another seeker. Remember, too.
that there is a time and a place to open the door—
don't let it be on every street corner or every
gathering of curious friends.
"Have faith in your teachers—both spirit and
earth teachers. Although you may become im
patient, know that they are doing their best to help
you in your development. They are as anxious as
you are, but they are not impatient. Do not try to
demonstrate your gifts before you are fully ready.
Serve your apprenticeship in this as you would in
any other profession, just as willingly and just as
faithfully."
Mrs. Marx has some suggestions for those who
are developing trance mediumship. She says that
first you must have faith and confidence in your
spirit teacher. You should sit with some capable
person who is acquainted with the laws governing
mediumship and this phase in particular. "One
would not think of taking an anesthetic without
being under the care of a person who knew how to
administer it. Trance, roughly, is a sort of sleep
brought on by spirit controls. Without proper care
it can be very dangerous and detrimental." But
properly developed, trance mediumship is a very
wonderful phase and often leads to the development
of the physical phases. It happened in this man
ner with Mrs. Marx' mediumship. She developed
trumpet mediumship some time after the trance
work was unfolded.

She says that in trance you must withdraw, as
a spirit, from the control of your physical body.
To her it is like drifting into a state of unconscious
ness. She goes to sleep spiritually and mentally,
but not physically. The physical control of the
body is taken over by the spirit teacher. As the
Scriptures say, "I will pour out of my Spirit upon
all flesh."
After relaxation of all body muscles and men
tal tenseness, she seems to draw her consciousness
within herself. As she does this, the spirit con
trol begins to overshadow her own consciousness
and assume control of the body. Bit by bit, this
procedure continues until she has lost all conscious
ness and the spirit has complete control.
It is this drawing within of mental conscious
ness that is difficult for the student. It is a men
tal and spiritual process. Very often, at a certain
point in the process, the mind rebels and brings the
student back to full consciousness again. It is do
ing this at the call of the physical and earthly
desires. It refuses to give way to full spirit con
trol. When this happens, the student must begin
all over again, conditioning himself to accept and
give in to the spiritual laws through which trance
mediumship is made possible. This drawing with
in must be practiced continuously until the mind
becomes the servant of the spirit.
Perhaps it can best be described in the following
manner. Visualize yourself, as a being, becoming
smaller within your physical body while the body
itself remains at its normal size. In the earlier

stages of this diminishing in size you will detect
an overshadowing of spiritual influence in
proportion.
Mrs. Marx' first trance work came about in an
unusual manner. She was ill for five years as the
result of an auto accident. In seeking relief from
this illness she went to Mr. Waldorf for healing,
and from him learned many of the laws of medium-
ship. Once, while taking a treatment, she became
entranced and an Italian girl spoke through her.
This young lady gave the name of Marie. She
spoke brokenly at first, but soon learned the use of
the English language. She told of her past life in
Italy—giving facts that later were checked in both
the United States and Italy, and verified—and she
has been a spirit helper to Mrs. Marx ever since
that time.
Marie has said that at the time of Mrs. Marx'
accident she and Dr. Norris came to help her.
Marie was a nurse and remained to help Mrs. Marx
in the development of her mediumship. Dr. Norris
remained with her too, and these two spirit people,
along with Mona, a little girl trumpet guide and
billet reader, are better known to many sitters than
is Mrs. Marx herself. Mrs. Marx is sure that if it
had not been for this accident these spirit helpers
would never have been attracted to her, and her
search for mediumship would have taken a much
longer time. Tragedies often are blessings in
disguise.
Mrs. Marx says that coming out of a trance state
is like waking after a night's sleep. A realization

of consciousness comes over you, faintly at first and
then with greater strength. She says it is not wise
to attempt movement of the body for a few seconds,
any more than it is wise to jump out of bed im
mediately upon waking. With practice, both en
trance into and coming out of trance is easily ac
complished. Faith in the ability of your spirit
guides and confidence in your own ability to co
operate with them in the right way will help speed
your development of the trance phase of
mediumship.
Mrs. Marx says that mental poise is necessary for
the development of trance. In entering the seance
room you must free your mind of all troubles and
earthly worries. The mind which is chained to
earth cannot free itself from earthly things and
relinquish control of the physical body to the de
gree necessary for trance manifestations. The
ability to shut yourself off from all things earthly,
while not a psychic ability in itself, should be
practiced in order to further the ease in which the
trance state can be entered.
The first public demonstration of Mrs. Marx'
mediumship was at a Spiritualist gathering in
Springfield, Ohio, where she now lives. She was
asked to give messages at a Spiritualist meeting,
and although quite apprehensive at what the results
might be, determined to have a try at it anyway.
When the first message she gave was accepted by
one of the congregation, and proved to be evident
ial, she felt perfectly at ease from then on. This
was more than ten years ago, and she has conducted

hundreds of message services since that time. She
has served many churches and for several years
has been programmed at Lily Dale Assembly, the
large Spiritualist summer camp at Lily Dale, New
York. Lily Dale has been presenting Spiritualist
speakers and mediums for nearly seventy years,
and it is a high tribute to Mrs. Marx' mediumship
that she is one of the featured workers there.
Originally a Baptist, Mrs. Marx is now a member
of the Spiritualist Episcopal Church. She founded,
and is the pastor of, the First Spiritualist Episcopal
Church of Springfield, Ohio.
In every person's mediumship outstanding inci
dents occur which mean much to the medium.
Oftentimes these incidents are of no greater con
sequence than hundreds of others which have come
through the same mediumship, yet they somehow
are a greater source of satisfaction. One such in
cident occurred when Mrs. Marx was serving Lily
Dale the first year. A man and his wife were very
interested in contacting their son in spirit. Their
visit to Mrs. Marx was their first experience with
mediumship. The son came to them, told them
many incidents of his past life on earth. He spoke
of his last goodbye to his mother and of the wire
they received notifying them of his passing to the
world of spirit. He mentioned the chevrons which
he had left on his chest of drawers during his last
visit home, and the flag which was now on the
pillow of his bed. Speaking of these things was
of much comfort as well as being evidential to the
young man's mother and father. , i i :

Mrs. Marx says that one outstanding thing which
her religion of Spiritualism has taught her is the
lesson of tolerance. Regardless of what a person's
religion might be, to him it is the truth, and she
believes we must not do anything which will cause
him to be unhappy or dissatisfied. "Let him live
his life as he sees fit," she says
She further explains it in this way. "To us.
Spiritualism is truth; to your next door neighbor,
Catholicism is truth; to the neighbor on the other
side, some form of Protestantism is truth; to your
Jewish neighbor, his religion is truth.
"It can be compared with a wheel. We are
spokes, all going into the same hub —at-one-ness
with God, and a Christ-like spirit may prevail on
every one of the spokes. If your light is bright
enough so that those on the next spoke want to
walk in that light, welcome them. They may re
main, and they may not. But be tolerant if they
reTurn to their own. They seek their own level in
truth, even as you and I do."
People often ask mediums if they don't weary
of hearing spirit people talk to their own. Some
times it is tiring, but in almost every sitting some
thing comes which helps the medium build his own
personal philosophy of life. Often they are age-old
truths, it is true, but they are presented through
different eyes, bringing a new and fresh viewpoint
or a more beautiful picture to the mind of the
medium. Sometimes just a word will inspire an
entirely new chain of thought or enriching bit of
philosophy. Such a thought Mrs. Marx gives as a

John W. Bunker
One summer day, in 1937, John Bunker was
listening to the radio news broadcast while eating
his noon lunch in the cafeteria at Camp Chesterfield.
The radio reporter was telling thousands of listeners
that the famous "veiled lady" had not visited the
grave of Rudolph Valentino as she had done on that
same day for several years previously. The black-
veiled lady always had gone to the celebrated movie
actor's grave to leave upon it a bouquet of roses.
But this year her non-appearence had caused much
comment in newspapers and on the radio.
Mr. Bunker finished his lunch, then hurried to his
cottage as he had an appointment for a trumpet sit
ting. A few moments later there was a knock at
the front door. His appointment had arrived for
the sitting. She entered the seance room, and the
sitting began. A man spoke through the trumpet,
and suddenly Mr. Bunker realized it was Rudolph
Valentino. He was talking to "the veiled lady!"
This year, instead of vainly knocking at the door

way of death, she had come to speak to him through
the doorway that leads to the world of life—the
seance room.
For fifteen years, people from everywhere have
been ushered through that same doorway by the
mediumship which Mr. Bunker demonstrates.
They have found not only the comfort of talking to
their own, but also have received many spiritual
teachings which have enabled them to live in closer
relationship with the divine. For ten years longer
than this he has been giving readings to many
interested seekers. Besides clairvoyance and clair-
audience, he also has the phases of healing, apport,
direct voice, trance, billet reading and some inde
pendent writing.
Probably the mediumship for which he is best
known is the phase of apport. In this mediumship,
small articles such as roses, Indian arrowheads, and
bits of jewelry are brought from distances and
transported into the seance room through spirit
power. This sounds unbelievable, but thousands
who have visited his seances will testify to its
actually happening.
I asked Mr. Bunker how apport mediumship
could best be explained to those who had not wit
nessed it. "How can people, who have never seen
such a demonstration, be made to see that it is
possible for one solid object to be passed through
another?"
After tellling me that science now knows that
there are no actually solid objects, he said that I
should put in this book not his explanation of ap

ports, but one which was told to him by a college
professor. Here it is.
Apport mediumship operates through laws of
vibration just as other mediumship does. It is
much the same as the conditions which cause the
cycle of water's being drawn in the sky and then
returned to the earth as rain. We begin with water
on earth, either in its liquid state, or solid as ice.
Through the application of heat, water is drawn
into the sky as its rate of vibration is so raised
that it becomes vapor. This vapor is invisible,
like the steam at the spout of a tea kettle.
The vapor pervades the atmosphere. Then, by
the passage of magnetic currents through the ethers
it is gathered into a more concentrated form which
we see as clouds. The magnetic currents continue,
the clouds become of greater density as the
vapor is further solidified, and it finally comes to
its original vibration as water and it falls to earth
as rain. In brief, this is the scientific corollary
by which apport mediumship is explained.
In the mediumistic demonstration, an object is
selected some distance away from the seance room.
This compares to the water on earth. The object's
rate of vibration is changed so that it may be car
ried into the ethers in astral form, just as the water
is changed to vapor. It is brought into the seance
room and through the application of magnetic cur
rents is changed back again to its former vibration,
which may be compared to rain dropping from the
skies.
To be a medium for the demonstration of this

phenomenon, Mr. Bunker says that you must be
able to place at the disposal of the spirit operators
the spiritual energy, or magnetic current, by which
these operations may be accomplished. To attain
this ability, he offers the following suggestions.
"Much of your mediumship will be gained in
direct proportion to your ability to relax at the time
the demonstration takes place. I have found that
anxiety on the part of the student makes the dem
onstration of any phase of mediumship much more
difficult, and oftentimes impossible. It has come
to my attention many times, that those students
who possess an attitude of indifference are more
likely to succeed in their development. By indif
ference I do not mean an attitude of taking no in
terest in the proceedings but an attitude which is
the opposite of anxiety.
"To create within yourself the spiritual energy
necessary for the demonstration of apport medium-
ship, I suggest the use of posture and breathing ex
ercises. There are two postures which the student
may use. One is simply lying on a fairly hard
surface flat on your back with arms extended along
the sides. The other is to sit erect in a straight
backed chair, but not allowing your own back to
touch the chair. After practicing these postures
until you can assume them for some time in a
relaxed state without tiring, then you are ready to
practice the breathing exercise.
"This exercise is actually the one which will
create the spiritual energy. You must never, never
practice it unless you have full control of your

mind, emotions and passions. For if you do not
have this control, and this point I cannot emphasize
too strongly, you are walking on the thinnest of
ice over the deepest of water holes.
"Inhale in rhythm with your heartbeat, drawing
in breath to the count of seven beats. As you do
this, mentally direct the cosmic energy which is in
the air to the base of the spine, or the first psychic
center. Hold this energy at this point for a count
of three heartbeats. Then draw it up the spine to
the root of the neck and exhale through the mouth
for seven heartbeats. Pause for three heartbeats,
then begin the inhalation again. Practice this ex
ercise for not more than seven indrawings of the
breath."
Mr. Bunker says that in practicing this exercise
you will notice what appears to be an application of
heat at the base of the spine. It will seem to be
about the size of a half dollar. You will not notice
this at first, of course, but it will come after much
practice. This sensation of heat will travel up the
spine along the same path over which you direct
the cosmic energy. When it reaches the fifth psy
chic center at the root of the neck, you have within
yourself the energy necessary for apport medium-
ship. This energy you mentally release and place
at the disposal of the guides who will use it in
performing the demonstration.
Mr. Bunker begins to release this energy in the
late evening before retiring. The objects selected
for apporting are dematerialized, changed to the
vapor state or astral vibration, through the night.

They are held in that state until the apport seance,
which he always holds at eight o'clock in the morn
ing. At that time the battery created by himself
and the sitters generates the magnetic current
which transforms the objects back to their partic
ular physical vibratory state. Through the years,
his apport seances have been not only the scene of
amazing demonstrations but also the source of much
spiritual inspiration brought to the sitters by his
guide Dr. Gonzales, Thistle the messenger guide,
and Indian teachers.
In some seances this same apport energy is used
by the guides to perform healings. The two great
est of these healing incidents began, oddly enough,
on the same morning several years ago. One man,
Mr. John Bell, of Chicago, had been in an accident,
causing a stubborn illness which had lasted for
fifteen years. He was afflicted with a hernia, and
crippled so that he required the help of two canes
in order to walk. He had tried every known man
ner of treatment without success and at great cost.
He attended the seance for eleven mornings, re
ceiving a treatment each day. At the end of that
time he was perfectly healed and he has had no
trouble whatsoever to this day. He no longer uses
his canes.
The other gentleman was Mr. Ernest Wilson, also
of Chicago. He was injured in the first world war.
The injury developed into running ulcers on his
leg. Ever since the war he had not been able to
sleep without taking opiates, or he could choose to
lie awake and suffer intense pain. The night after

the first sitting he slept without either opiate or
pain for the first time in over twenty years. He
attended three more times, and was completely
healed. , > ..
Some time later Mr. Wilson made an interesting
statement. He said that for many years he had
considered himself a Spiritualist. Many friends
had asked him why he did not try Spiritualist heal
ing for his illness, but he had never done it. On
the first morning he attended the seance, Mr.
Bunker's little girl guide, Thistle, said to him, "Mr.
Wilson, we will heal you." At that moment there
seemed to flood within him an inner realization.
He knew he would be healed. And he was. Then
he proudly said, "Now I really am a Spiritualist."
Mr. Bunker was a funeral director for many years
before he gave up that work to devote all his time
to mediumship and the Spiritualist Episcopal
Church which he founded. It has been jokingly
said by many that he used to put people away and
now he brings them back. Before he knew about
mediumship as practiced in Spiritualism, he would
use some of his natural mediUmistic talents to
frighten people. A lady who had studied deeply
into psychology told him much about the mind and
how to use it in control over physical objects.
Oftentimes when some of the younger folks would
visit his home for a social evening, he enjoyed
causing curtains to move, or steps to sound on the
stairway or roof. The general atmosphere of the
funeral home, added to these phenomena, did not
contribute to the peace of mind of his guests^much

to Mr. Bunker's enjoyment. He knows now what
actually took place. He was giving spiritual energy
to spirit people in such a way that they could cause
the demonstrations for which he asked. (The
reason I seldom play golf with Mr. Bunker is that
he usually threatens to control the golf balls in the
same way. )
,
V
He first became interested in Spiritualism
through these demonstrations and his own clair
voyance. He thought that Spiritualism might be
able to explain these things to him, which of course
it did. He sat in a developing class in which the
medium was Margaret Bright. In this class, his
only daughter Eva, who passed into spirit when ten
years old, told him that she would be his messenger
guide. She worked with him in that capacity until
the development of his apport mediumship. At
this time she was replaced by another little girl,
named Thistle. Even after developing other
phases, he was several years in unfolding the apport
phase. His first Spiritualistic work was in Eaton
Rapids, Michigan. He has lived in or near this
town all his life.
There always has been much of the mystic in Mr.
Bunker. When he was superintendent and a
teacher in the Methodist Sunday school he always
taught the mystical interpretations of Biblical
characters and the incidents surrounding them.
In other words, he was a Spiritualist in thought
and in actuality long before being one in name.
He says, "Within every man is the capacity to
live as did the Christ. As well, in every man,

there is the capacity to commit any crime. It is
the struggle between1 these two opposite attributes
in which man finds himself here on earth. It is
the result of this struggle which determines what
we shall be. Knowing that we have within us the
capacity to be as the Christ, we may take courage
in all our trials. We must know that the same
divine power, which animated him, also is present
to animate us. Therefore, we have within us the
power to overcome not only all obstacles but all
evil as well.
"This is a great heritage which we must begin
to use in every moment of our lives, for the spectre
of atomic power and other heretofore invisible rays
now being discovered by science makes it necessary.
If we do not so live, that spectre will come alive,
and we will die in the destruction which it creates.
Our universe must become a spiritual one, pat
terned after the spiritual plans of the Christ. It
must become this in fact, and not just in the wishes
of mankind."
He also says, "I am the past, the present, and the
future. I am the present because of what I have
^
been in the past. I am the future because of what
I am in the present. Today's world was made by
yesterday, and tomorrow's world will not wait for
tomorrow to be fashioned. It is made today."
Aside from golf, Mr. Bunker's greatest hobby is
the Kiwanis Club. He is a charter member and
past president of that organization's club in Eaton
Rapids. He was the founder of the first junior, or
high school, Kiwanis Club in the entire internation

al organization. He also is a member of the Mason
ic lodge.
It is not often that mediums receive messages
from other mediums, nor do they frequently re
ceive communications which are wholly for them
selves. Although Mr. Bunker is sometimes more
fortunate than many mediums in receiving mes
sages from others in the profession, he tells one
story about a message he was given which makes
people wide-eyed with wonder, at least when he
first starts to tell it. In brief—he received a mes
sage from a dog! But the story itself isn't as in
credible as it sounds.
Mr. Bunker owns a bulldog whose name is Woofy.
She is his pride and joy, but she rules him with a
loving paw. One Thanksgiving day he was sitting
on the davenport in his home, alone except for
Woofy who was sitting beside him. He was think
ing that his brother's family were all together, and
his sister's family had gathered at her home, but
that he was all alone. These thoughts occupied his
mind for several minutes. There followed a series
of actions by Woofy which had never happened
before, nor since.
She looked into his face for a long moment, as
though she understood his thoughts about being
alone. Then she jumped off the davenport and went
to the front door, nose in the air just as if she was
greeting someone. Then she went to the chair next
to the door. She looked up into this chair, and her
eyes were pointed at the place where a person's
face would be if he were sitting in the chair. She

and a short wag of her extremely short tail. Then,
keeping her face pointed upwards, she went to the
next chair and repeated the performance. She did
this at every chair in the living room —five of them
Finally she returned to the davenport, jumped up
beside Mr. Bunker and looked at him again as if to
say, "See these people—you are not alone." Mr.
Bunker is confident of the fact that this is what she
was showing him. And no doubt she was right.
Thus ends the story of how John W. Bunker, the
internationally known medium, received comfort
and consolation from a message given to him by
his little dog Woofy. "God works in mysterious
ways, His wonders to perform."

Carl Horton Pierce
CaRL Horton Pierce became interested in Spir
itualism in 1912. His little son died in that year,
and Mr. Pierce was anxious to know what had be
come of him. He was sure that the little boy still
lived, and that he had found a place of happiness
in God's world. But he sought an actual message
from the youngster which would prove the beliefs
in his mind.
One question that I asked Mr. Pierce was, "What
was your original religious belief?"
"Strict Methodism," was his reply. And the
manner in which he put it made you know that the
emphasis was on the word "strict." It is a long
road from Methodism through Christian Science
and Eastern occultism to Spiritualism. But Mr.
Pierce travelled that road and is happy that he did
so. Mrs. Pierce has journeyed along with him,
and in many of their activities the two work togeth

er. At times the way has been difficult and dis
couraging. There have been set-backs and dis
appointments. But Mr. Pierce now feels that he
has reached the field in which he can accomplish
the greatest good for the most people.
At the time of his son's passing to the world of
spirit, Mr. Pierce was a Christian Science practi
tioner and lecturer. He had been in that work for
many years. But that religion did not furnish him
with any news of the son whom he loved so dearly,
and he realized that the word he was seeking must
be found in some other channel. His attention was
drawn to Spiritualism, and he wasted no time in
delving into the deeper aspects of psychic science.
He purchased every book about Spiritualism that
he could find. These books were not merely read,
they were studied thoroughly, cover to cover and
back again. But let me give you his own words—
"I immersed myself as thoroughly as possible in
its science, philosophy and religion, finding it the
answer to the yearnings of my heart and a hearts
ease to the bereaved."
Mr. Pierce's major phases of mediumship are
healing and intuitional perception. He says, "From
1898 to 1914 this was carried on without regard to
communication. From then on, communication
was recognized by me as an established fact, and
every effort was made to inculcate this in the minds
of all patients and adherents."
In his advice to healers and those interested in
developing this phase of mediumship, Mr. Pierce
advocates a combination of earthly and spiritual

power. He believes that much power is contained
in the healing word as spoken by man. But he
also counsels that this power is made much more
effective when it is combined with that of the spirit
teachers and masters who come to help us.
As he expresses it, "I have found it most effi
cacious to ask for the co-operation of those in the
heaven world who have the understanding and spir
itual attainment to accentuate our word. Thus,
as we speak the word of healing, we receive the
divine power of their realization plus the power
which we have attained through our own use and
practice of the word of power."
Mr. Pierce draws attention to the fact that there
is a slight difference between this method of heal
ing and that of merely calling upon the higher
powers to do the work for us. His method calls
for the use of the spoken word of god as power,
aided by the power and realization of those in the
heaven world who are appealed to for co-operation.
"Thus the one who speaks the word is constantly
being spiritualized, and the effects of such practice
upon the patients and those needing advice, coun
sel, direction or healing is—as compared with
other systems which I have thoroughly tried out—
little short of what might be called 'miraculous'."
This method, Mr. Pierce feels, is also of benefit
in helping the healer discover a higher source of
wisdom. He says, "We do not discredit, nor do we
discount, communication with the loved ones of our
family or friends who have passed on. We wel
come them all in love and appreciation. But our

guidance and unfoldment is from higher realms
wherein basic truth and Divine Wisdom are para
mount."
In other words, Mr. Pierce is sure that students
and healers who follow this method will daily be
increased in spiritualization of their finer senses.
There is no possibility of obsession or interference
from entities of lower astral realms, for the stu
dents are protected in their development by the
high powers whom they contact as well as by the
spiritual vibrations which they themselves set up.
Mr. Pierce uses the word in all his healing work,
and recommends that students of healing do like
wise. He says that in working with obsession ( and
he has treated hundreds of cases) this method is
especially valuable.
•
Going back to Biblical times, we find that the
Christ accomplished many of his healings in just
this same way. He did not call upon some super
ior force to do all of it for him, but used a combin
ation of his own powers with those of spirit.
Mr. Pierce feels that the phase of healing may
be developed in most every person. The talent for
this phase lies within every child of God. He
recognizes the Word of God as the power which
does the work. "Speak the Word only," said the
Centurion, "and my servant shall be healed."
Everyone can speak the Word. There is nothing
which prohibits the child of God from doing this,
or limits him in any way.
When sitting in your development class, Mr.
Pierce believes that you should protect yourself in

a spiritual way. You should not enter upon this
divine undertaking just to "see what you can get."
or "what you can see." Such an attitude disre
gards entirely the spiritual unfoldment of your spir
itual senses. Though you are striving to open the
door to spirit influence, you do not wish it
opened to just any influence that may happen along.
You are striving, or should be, for a meeting be
tween the highest divinity within you and the high
est on the spirit plane which may come to assist
you. In entering the class or seance room, he ad
vocates that you declare: God protects me from
erroneous influence during this class (or seance).
Class work is of great help to the student of
healing. It gives him the opportunity of coming
in touch with the doctor guides and master teach
ers who will be assisting with the healing work.
Coming in touch with these people helps the stu
dent to know them as realities, to feel a closer
companionship and to know the existence of a
common goal. Also, they are able to give advice
as to any specialized technique particularly suitable
for each individual student.
Further, class work helps the student to unfold
his own spiritual perception and inspiration which
are helpful in doing healing work. The ability to
recognize and interpret the spiritual aspects of any
particular disease or illness which the healer is
treating will do much toward helping the healer
effect a cure. The development of other phases of
mediumship is also helpful to the healer, even
though a good healer has no time to practice other

phases for the public. He can use them in combin
ation with his main work of healing.
Oftentimes class work will also help the healer
build up a spiritual philosophy within himself. The
work of the healer is not just to cure a disease.
His responsibility goes further and deeper than
that. He must help his patient to have an under
standing of spiritual cause and effect, the effect of
the mind on disease and other spiritual aspects
which help the patient to remain cured. The med
ical profession is now recognizing the effects of
mind and other outward causes which are the be
ginnings of disease. The healer must steer his pa
tient away from the particular mental or spiritual
cause which brought on his illness in the first place.
Many times, disease is merely the result of mental
inharmony, and though cured it will return unless
mental harmony is established.
A study of all things spiritual is an essential to
the healer if he is to do his work in an able manner.
The gift of healing is one of the highest of spirit
ual callings. It was practiced by the Christ more
than any other of his works. Disease is the great
est plague of mankind, and it continues in spite of
all the advances made by medical science. Only
spiritual healing can effect a complete cure in any
case, for only this type takes spiritual aspects into
consideration.
As much of the power to heal works through the
body of the healer himself, it is important that his
be a clean, healthy body. A regularity of hours,
of eating, and of spiritual devotions will speed

development of this phase of mediumship and make
it more powerful once attained.
In giving treatments, Mr. Pierce recommends
that the healer follow the Scriptural admonition,
:
Ask and ye shall receive." Around the healer are
those who will help him in his work, but the heal
er himself must invoke this assistance and other
power into actual being. Invoking this power is
done by the Word and by every life fibre of the
healer. It is a stirring up of cosmic force through
the use of the healer's mind.
In developing healing, and practicing
it,
it
is
well
to have a spiritual poise and confidence within you.
This
is
reflected to the patient and builds
a
faith
within him that will make the spiritual powers
more effective. About all disease there
is
a
confu
sion of spiritual ethers which must be calmed and
stilled. It
is
just as when the Christ appeared to
the disciples and said, "Peace, be unto you."
With practice, you will find yourself coming into
this state of peace. And when you have attained
it, you will find that all things necessary will come
to you. Or in other words, an abundance. This
is
not only
a
part of Mr. Pierce's healing method,
it
also
is
a
part of his everyday philosophy. That
it
is
workable
is
illustrated by the following
incident.
t
One Sunday during the war Mr. Pierce was on
his way to his church. One of the automobile tires
went flat and he began looking around for a garage
where he could have the tire fixed. But the gar
ages all were closed or, being short handed, would

not even consider working on the tire until Monday.
The filling stations that were open likewise would
not fix the tire.
Mr. Pierce returned to the car and said to his
wife, "Now mother, we know that tire will be fixed.
We must be calm —and ask."
Whereupon Mr. and Mrs. Pierce sat in medita
tion for a moment while Mr. Pierce silently asked
for help. Then he got out of the car again. Al
most immediately his attention was directed to a
small filling station which he had previously over
looked, probably because there was no sign of life
around it and it appeared to be closed as the others
were. But Mr. Pierce has confidence in many
powers which other people do not believe exist.
He went to the station, found an attendant there
who, when asked about fixing the tire said, "Surely,
I'll do it right away!"
Now this is not an important incident which
would vitally affect the lives of its characters. But
that just makes it all the more important to the
rest of us, for it shows how spiritual powers can
be used even in the minor incidents of our lives.
It expresses in a practical way the philosophy and
method of life which Mr. Pierce recommends for
every healer, and every other person for that
matter.
But all of Mr. Pierce's experiences have not had
such a happy ending. He has been in healing
work since 1898, and in the early years of his work
an ice man came to his house asking help for his
wife who was desperately ill with pneumonia.

"Take the trolley to Rahway (N. J.)," the ice
man said. "Then walk back toward Cranford
about two miles and you will see two ice houses
back from the street. There is where I live.
Please come as quickly as you can, my wife is
about to die."
He set out after church that evening, arrived at
Rahway about midnight, and began walking the
two miles back to Cranford. All along the way,
dogs came charging out at him as though to tear
him to pieces. But there seemed to be a circle of
light around him and when the dogs saw this they
would stop!
He finally arrived at the home of the ice man's
wife, passed the first door and entered the second.
The woman said, "Lucky you didn't come in the
other door, the dogs in there would have torn you
to shreds!"
Pierce paid no attention to this remark. "Be
at ease," he gently commanded, "you will lose that
pneumonia inside of fifteen minutes."
And it happened just that way. The woman
appeared very grateful. She gave him fifty cents!
Then she said, "I feel that you can help me.
Won't you sell my eggs for me?"
Still anxious to be of help to the lady, the next
Sunday morning Pierce and his son rode their
bicycles to Rahway, picked up several dozen eggs,
and began visiting members of the church. They
explained the circumstances, and sold the eggs.
In church that day he could not understand why

thrown at him from the audience. But it devel
oped that all of those eggs were bad. The woman
had had them in storage in her home all winter.
He never tried selling her eggs again, and it took
some time to explain matters to his congregation.
I would say it was about this time in his career
that Mr. Pierce began developing his philosophy of
spiritual poise.
Mr. Pierce first studied occultism under Pedro
P. Pequeno. Since 1934, he has received much
help and spiritual revelations from Dr. William
James. He has travelled all over the United
States and Canada, lecturing, teaching and doing
healing work. He is president of the Spiritual
Science organization of New York, and has the
title of bishop. He is a member of the Federation
of Spiritualist Churches and Associations.
When he first entered healing work it did not
hold the position it does today. Healers were con
sidered as bad as murderers, and the shadow of
arrest and imprisonment was over the healer at all
times. But through the years Mr. Pierce developed
within himself an overwhelming faith in the power
of God to heal anything, and he has clung stead
fastly to that faith in the face of all obstacles.
"Every one of our healings is proof of spirit
return," he says, "for no healing that is done under
this method is without spirit co-operation."
He has seen sight restored to blinded eyes, can
cer healed, paralysis overcome, and twisted limbs
restored to normal. These sights have proved

MaLle A. Riffle
.N1.ABLE Riffle has been arrested four times. She
is quite philosophical about it, and says, "Jesus
Christ was arrested, too, wasn't he?"
He was arrested for being King of the Jews,
which he was not and which he never claimed to be.
She was arrested for being a fortune teller, which
she is not and which she never claimed to be. It
is all a matter of the way you look at it, and just
as some officialdom misinterpreted the Christ's
work, so do some officials misinterpret our work.
Nevertheless, it is no fun being arrested, whether
it is a case of misinterpretation or not. It is not a
pleasant experience to endure even for the sake of
a work that you love. But Mrs. Riffle lives for her
work, for Spiritualism and its great truths, and she
is willing to undergo the trials of earth in order
that Spiritualism might progress. This is what she
says about it: "I do not mind being arrested for I
feel that I am no better than thousands of others
who have gone through hell to prove to this ignor

ant world that man survives the change called
death."
When she says this, she doesn't do it with 'the
idea that you will think she enjoys the experience,
far from it. But it does illustrate the fact that
Spiritualism is her life and her mission. She is a
crusader for truth as she sees the truth.
"If I am arrested a dozen times more I will be
just as faithful to my spirit teacher, Dr. Henry
Williams —and we will continue on until we two
join together to continue spiritual work in the land
of heaven."
Mrs. Riffle understands full well that although
the Christ suffered and died for humanity, that
humanity still questions the return of the spirit.
We still have scribes and Pharisees among us. If
Spiritualism ever has need for a martyr, it can call
upon her and know that she will answer.
As she has spent many years of her later life in
travel, she does not conduct class work any more.
However, in her travels many people come to her
for advice concerning their development. One of
the first things that Dr. Henry Williams tells stu
dents is to understand the work of each of the band
of guides working with most mediums. There is
the doctor who controls the manifestations in gen
eral; the oriental, often a Hindu, who works with
the psychic centers of the body; the Indian, who
is a protective force; the inspirational guide, who
brings spiritual teachings; and the messenger guide,
usually a child, who pages spirit people and helps
them to manifest. These guides are not the same,

nor do they do the same work, with every medium.
But in general they work in this manner.
Mrs. Riffle thinks it is well to ask your guides to
place themselves around you in the same position
every time you sit. This is so that in case there
are manifestations around you, you will know from
which guide they are coming. She advises the stu
dent to ask the doctor to place himself on the
student's right; the inspirational guide on the stu
dent's left; the Hindu behind him; and the Indian
in front of him. This leaves the messenger guide
free to go wherever needed most. Asking them
to place themselves like this will help you in your
early development. For example, if you felt a
touch on your right shoulder you could be reason
ably sure it was your doctor who was performing
the manifestation. Thus you will come more
quickly to know and recognize his touch.
Mrs. Riffle also suggests that several times during
your trumpet sitting period you rub the palms of
your hands together, quite fast as though you were
twirling a pencil, for a moment or so. This helps
to create an electronic force. You may have had
the experience of rubbing your feet along a wool
carpet, then touching someone with the tip of your
forefinger. Oftentimes a spark will jump from your
finger to the other person's cheek, because a positive
electrical force has been built up in your body and
is transferred to the other person who, having re
mained motionless, is negative. Rubbing the palms
together acts in a similar way, except that then the
force is directed toward the trumpet.

Mrs. Riffle realizes that many people have diffi
culty in relaxing. She suggests a simple physical
exercise which will help relaxation and which can
be used in conjunction with a developing period for
any phase of mediumship. The student should
stand erect, place his entire weight on the right
foot, then, keeping the left leg straight, raise the
left foot in front of the body as high as it will go.
Do this very slowly. Then lower the foot slowly
back to the floor again. Repeat this exercise for
the right foot. Then raise each hand, describing
an arc in front of the body, until the hand is
stretched at arm's length over the head. This, too,
should be done slowly, first with the left hand and
then with the right. This easy exercise helps to
relieve body tension, and many of Mrs. Riffle's stu
dents have used it with success in attaining
relaxation.
Relaxation is important, as the following incident
will show. Years ago, Mrs. Riffle used to travel
through Oklahoma every winter in company with
Nettie Nichols Johnson, a well known medium.
One year, on the way to Oklahoma City, they
stopped to hold a seance at the famous 101 Ranch,
well known in show business. The owner, Mr.
Miller, was a Spiritualist and asked the ladies to
conduct a seance there.
Upon arriving at the ranch they were treated to
a wonderful dinner. When it became dark Mr.
Miller announced that it was time for the seance
and asked the ladies to accompany him to another
building some distance away, where the meeting

was to be held. Mrs. Riffle noticed that he strapped
on a gun belt with two pearl handled revolvers in
the holsters. Wondering what in the world the
guns were for, they went through the dark night
with Mr. Miller to a small building which stood
apart from the others.
Mr. Miller opened the door and stepped aside to
let the ladies enter. Looking through the door,
they could see several figures inside, but the light
was so dim they could not make them out. They
stepped through the door—and found themselves
surrounded by twenty full-blooded Indians!
Mr. Miller followed the ladies inside, and ar
ranged the Indians in a circle around the room.
Next he placed his revolvers on a small table in the
center of the room. Then, speaking in Indian
language, he told them he would not stand for any
unwarranted display on their part, and if they be
haved they could talk to the spirits of their fathers
who now were in the happy hunting grounds.
Then he gave the word to the ladies to begin the
seance. You can see that knowing how to relax
was important under these circumstances.
Mrs. Riffle says that she never heard such beauti
ful singing in all her life. The Indians were very
orderly and made the best of conditions for the
phenomena. She says that it was one of the finest
trumpet circles she ever held. But she was thank
ful that Mr. Miller had brought his guns along.
Mrs. Riffle says if you have a problem to solve
which requires physical energy that your will di
rects your muscles to perform the required act. If

your problem requires mental energy, the will sets
the mind at work. If you are required to produce
the spiritual energy necessary for trumpet manifes
tations, then you must set at work the spiritual
energy which is a part of you as much as the
physical and mental.
We may not know just exactly the substance ol
which this energy is formed, nor the exact manner
in which it is applied, but this need not keep us
from using it. There is much about electricity that
man does not know, but this does not keep him
from harnessing its power and putting it to work.
In sitting for trumpet, Mrs. Riffle thinks that the
creation of the proper spiritual vibration rests upon
every sitter and principally upon the medium.
Levitation and voices are the creation of spiritual
powers which the medium must set in motion. All
substance, physical, mental or spiritual, is inactive,
or inert, until it is set into movement, and the first
process of activating these substances is caused by
the medium.
First of all, the medium must have the desire
for the manifestation to take place. This outward
desire is transmitted through to the spiritual being
of the medium which places the medium's spiritual
power at the disposal of the spirit operators. If
you desire to wiggle your little finger, certain pro
cesses are evolved which set in motion the physical
force which moves the finger. (And no scientist
is able to explain how this comes about. It just
happens as a result of your energized desire. ) The
same is true with mediumship, except that the

desire and the force used, and the results, are spir
itual ones. Through this process all physical mat
ter is subject to spirit power—the trumpet can be
levitated and the voices produced. The medium's
inner will, responding to outward desire, causes
spiritual vibration to become active.
Mrs. Riffle begins her circle with the Lord's
prayer and a hymn, and recommends that all stu
dents of mediumship do the same. This helps keep
the student's desires upon a spiritual plane, and
furnishes additional vibration which is used by the
spirit operators. After this opening, concentrate
your desire first upon levitation of the trumpet.
When levitation has been accomplished, then con
centrate upon the production of voices. Direct your
inner will to supply whatever power or force is
necessary to the production of these phenomena.
Mrs. Riffle says, "Achievement does not come
overnight, but through diligent study, practice and
self-reliance. Know that you possess talents which
now are lying dormant, waiting to be awakened
and developed."
No matter what obstacles may loom before you in
the development of your mediumship, Mrs. Riffle
is sure that they can be overcome through patience,
faith and determination. These attributes are
made stronger and of greater worth when linked
with a desire to serve humanity. If you know
Mrs. Riffle, you are aware of the fact that she is not
a woman endowed with an overabundance of pa
tience. But she says that developing mediumship
was one thing she just had to be patient with. Psy

chic unfoldment cannot be forced, and she states
that this was the greatest lesson she had to learn
in developing her own mediumship.
She began her development by sitting in class
with Thomas Smith in Anderson, Indiana. She
was twelve years developing her mediumship to
the point where she could appear in public with it.
Through those twelve years she had to make pa
tience her byword.
Although her family originally was of the Quaker
faith, they had been Spiritualists for many years
before this time. Her mother, Lydia Simpson, was
the first secretary of the Indiana Spiritualist Asso
ciation, an auxiliary of the National Spiritualist
Association. She is a devout Spiritualist to this
day—and refuses to tell her age. But she is "Mo
ther Simpson" to the mediums and visitors at Camp
Chesterfield, Indiana. Mrs. Riffle has been secre
tary of this huge camp since 1910. Charles Barnes,
a trumpet medium, convinced Mr. and Mrs. Simp
son of Spiritualism when Mable was eight years old.
A member of the National Spiritualist Associa
tion, Mrs. Riffle has practiced her mediumship for
thirty-seven years, thirty-three of them as a speaker
and message bearer. For nearly five years she held
trumpet seances in trance before she started speak
ing and conducting message services.
Her first public speaking and message work was
given in Anderson, Indiana, at the Madison Avenue
Temple. She says that she was timid about ap
pearing before those people and trying to speak to
them and give messages. She's not timid now.

She was thrilled then, and still is, when she can
receive a message that is helpful to some needy
soul, or is evidential.
In giving messages, Mrs. Riffle is name conscious.
She concentrates on trying to receive the name of
the spirit person who is attempting to send a mes
sage. She says it is just like standing in a large
railroad station. You hear the steady hum of
voices without noticing any one in particular. But
if one of those voices mentions the name of your
home town you catch it immediately. Other me
diums are description conscious, and find it easier
to describe the spirit, some are mannerism conscious
and so on. But as soon as she steps on the platform
she is intent on catching names.
When I questioned her about hobbies, she could
talk only of Spiritualism. She dreams of a psy
chic college where students can develop their me-
diumship just like students in other schools learn
manual trades or professions. She visions this col
lege being erected at Camp Chesterfield as her next
project in that Spiritualist mecca.
But I know that she does have a hobby, one that
she gets mighty excited about. She likes to fish.
Almost at the drop of a hat she will put on some
old clothes, grab a fishing pole, and head for the
lairs of the underwater inhabitants. Deep sea,
lakes, rivers, creeks, any place where a fish might
live, Mrs. Riffle has fished there. And when the
fish don't bite she forgets her patience.
With her mediumship she has brought a new
understanding to many, has reunited people who

have been separated for years, has located missing
people, and has solved crimes. But a travelling
medium never knows what experience he will have
next. Once in New Mexico, again with Mrs. John
son, she was holding a trumpet seance in the coun
try home of a Mr. Hill. The weather had been
threatening, and during the course of the seance
let loose with all its fury. A bolt of lightning
struck the chimney of the small country house,
giving everyone a shaking up and a good scare.
Next they discovered it had set the house on fire.
They all ran outside into the storm, the house
burned down, and they had to stay in the tiny
smoke house till morning. It's all in the evening's
work for the medium.
For eleven years Mrs. Riffle was a school teacher.
During all this time she had within herself an urge
to do something for humanity. She wanted to
prove to humanity that the soul of man was im
mortal. So she conducted a spiritual analysis of
herself to see if she could determine the best way
in which this could be done. She decided upon
mediumship and has followed it to this day.
Friends ridiculed her for her choice, but they were
unseeing souls, and she has since been able to bring
many of them to light. She says that she simply
"closed the door against ridicule and opened it to
spiritual development."

Hugh Gordon Burroughs
The states of Rhode Island, Georgia and Mississ
ippi have been missing something. They are the
only states in the union which Hugh Gordon
Burroughs has not visited in his Spiritualistic work
As a member of the National Spiritualist Associa
tion he has travelled by train, bus and automobile
to most every far corner of our land serving as an
instrument of the world of spirit.
Mr. Burroughs is a jolly fellow, but you never
would suspect that he would stay up all night long
just to see a huge circus unload. In all his years
of hard work, of seeing the seamy side of life
through coming in touch with everyone's troubles,
and in spite of his graying hair, that much of the
youngster has kept its place in his heart. If you
call on Mr. Burroughs and cannot find him, and
no one knows where he is, you'd better see if there's
a circus coming to town. If there is, you'll find
this gentleman having the time of his life watch
ing the giant elephants push bright red circus wag

ons down the unloading ramp.
There, he is in the height of his glory. The
sound of the calliope thrillingly signals the start of
the parade, and you may as well not look any
more for Mr. Burroughs. He is out of this world
until he has watched the procedure reversed, the
circus loaded up. and its train pulling out of sight
on the way to the next city.
After this happens he comes back to normal
again. Once more he is the servant of the people.
Once more he brings health to some suffering
person, or gives sound advice, or a trumpet sitting.
Or he gives a scholarly lecture in his Washington,
D. C, church where hundreds attend his services
every year. You cannot help feeling kindly to
ward a man who openly indulges in these extremes
of maturity.
At one time or another, Mr. Burroughs has dem
onstrated nearly every kind of mediumship that
is now known to us. Many people in the work
today have developed their mediumship under his
expert guidance and counsel. He has an en
couraging word for every person who in anxious
to develop psychic powers to the extent that they
can be used for the uplifting of humankind. To
him, mediumship is not just something that should
be indulged in as a passing fancy, and much de
pends upon the student's approach to unfoldment
at the very start.
"The student must have, first, true desire. De
sire leads to the fruit of desire," is the first advice
he gives to those who are beginning their develop

ment of mediumship.
There is much groundwork to be laid within, the
student who wishes his development to be of high
nature. There are spiritual attributes that go
along with psychical ones, and for good medium-
ship the spiritual nature and thinking are qualities
which should be considered first.
The student must develop within himself the
idea of selflessness. There are two reasons for this.
The first, of course, is that it is the proper, Christ
like attitude to take toward all the things we do.
And the other is that it enables the student to give
of his psychic powers for the use of the guides in
a better degree. He does not project his own
ideas and thoughts into his work as he might if his
attitude was more or less selfish. It makes for
a purer demonstration of spirit power and thought.
Mr. Burroughs feels that it is not right to attempt
mediumistic development with the idea that it is
to be used only for the person seeking it. Medium-
ship is a gift of God, and is to be used in God's
work. The student always must seek to be the
agent through which masters of light may work
for the good of all mankind. This takes medium-
ship entirely out of the realm of self, and places it
before mankind as the answer to every person's
plea for help and wisdom. Spiritual unfoldment
is every man's heritage, and cannot be regarded
as the private property of any one individual.
Faith and trust in God also is something that Mr.
Burroughs thinks every student should acquire.
We know that the Christ could do no mighty works

in one certain place because of the great unbelief
of the people there. Many students are awestruck
by the possibilities of mediumship. They see the
heights to which mediumship can go, and feel they
never will attain them themselves. And they
never will if they keep this attitude in their minds.
But with faith and trust, any student may rise to
greater heights than have as yet been reached.
The possibilities are as unlimited as God himself.
In other words, there is no limit at all except that
which the individual student places upon himself
By supreme faith and trust all limitations are re
moved, and the student will continue to unfold a
mediumship which will be a blessing to all
humankind.
To Mr. Burroughs' way of thinking, the develop
ment of mediumship begins long before the stu
dent enters the class room. The actual develop
ment in that class is the second step in the proced
ure. The attitude of the student, perhaps for years
before beginning actual development, is the first
step. And if this attitude has been a wrong one,
it should be changed before any attempt at develop
ment is made. If not, no one can say what the
results will be, except that they will not be good.
He believes that every student, if he intends to
become a worker in Spiritualism, must lead as
nearly a perfect life as is possible to live on this
earth. And it is possible to lead a perfect life.
Did not the Christ do so? He lived as all men can
live if they will to do so.
It might be hard to believe, but Mr. Burroughs

has known people who sought mediumship merely
for the purpose of seeing into the private lives of
others!
Others have been motivated by the desire of
fame, or fortune (they'll certainly not get this), or
to hold a power over other people.
The power of holy spirit wants nothing to do with
trash except to clean it away. It wants no part of
evil except to change it to good. That is a great
part of its purpose and mission, and any attitude
which does not reflect that same intention acts as
a repulsive agent, driving it away instead of bring
ing it closer to earth.
If you expect to be a fountain of refreshment at
which others may quench their spiritual thirst, you
cannot give bitter water with the sweet. The flow
must be pure as well as constant. Before getting
into mediumship it is well for the student to under
stand this fact, to face it, and decide for himself
whether or not he is willing to undertake the life
long responsiblility which it places upon him. If
he sees not the divinity of his task, then he had best
not attempt it, for his own unhappiness and that of
perhaps thousands of others will be the outcome.
On the other hand, the person who seeks medium-
ship not for fame or personal ends, but for the pur
pose of serving mankind, will find a happiness in
his work that mere words cannot describe. Tears
of gratitude in the eyes of those whom you have
helped are diamonds in the treasure box of the soul.
And words of thankfulness are like the ringing of
the cash register to the storekeeper.

Any student who looks down his nose at these re
wards is not a fit person to be the instrument of
spirit. Every medium who has received them
knows and understands their great worth.
It is true that a laborer is worthy of his hire.
And it is also true that every laborer receives in
one way or another his just reward. No medium
would trade his gift for a million dollars and the
enmity of his friends. The work he does brings
its own reward.
As Mr. Burroughs said before, "Desire leads to
the fruit of desire."
He says that the student must project a mighty
love to all mankind. He must lead a sincere, pray
erful life, drawing all mankind to him. This at
titude will certainly be reflected in whatever me-
diumship he may attain. As mediumship flows
through its earthly instrument, it is colored by that
instrument. And the mental attitude of the psy
chic is most certainly reflected in the mediumship
he demonstrates.
Why strive for anything less than the best? Mr.
Burroughs says that every student should set his
goal at the very ultimate, keeping this in mind as
part of his general attitude toward the work in
which he is attempting to become proficient.
Attitude. Attitude. Attitude. "What is your
attitude toward the mediumship you are seeking?"
is his constant question to every student. The me
diumship that you attain will depend upon your
answer. Mr. Burroughs has a full right to question
people's attitudes. He was an orphan, and often

He first became interested in Spiritualism when
he was twelve years old. He was living in Bluffton,
Indiana, his birthplace. One evening his music
teacher took him to a Spiritualist meeting held over
a bank in Bluffton. Judge Levi Mock was chair
man of the meeting, and this made a great impres
sion on young Gordon. The medium was Claig
Wright. This was the first medium he had ever
seen, but immediately there came to him a reali
zation that he was seeing and hearing a wonderful
truth. Previous to this time, while living on a farm
near Bluffton, he had heard voices, but thought that
everyone heard them so he said nothing about them.
When he was seventeen he moved to Joplin, Mis
souri. There, a Mr. and Mrs. Barnheardt took him
to a voice seance in Webb City. At this seance
his mother talked to him for the first time—she had
been in spirit since he was seven. Then he began
sitting in a home development circle with the
Barnheardts.
His gifts began to manifest themselves and he
was urged to sit with more competent teachers.
He has received instruction from such well known
mediums as Etta and Scott Bledsoe and Inez
Wagner who were in Topeka, Kansas, at that time.
Later he sat with Orin Dunigan at Chanute, Kan
sas. It was during this time that his greatest de
velopment came. Trumpet, slate writing, indepen
dent voice and other phases.
A list of his teachers would almost make a me

above there was Maud Lord Drake, Maggie Vestal,
Moses and Mattie Hull, E. V. Sprague and "Mother"
Sprague, William Hart and James Claud Wallace.
Burroughs started his public work when he was
twenty years old. His first work was in Joplin and
Wichita. When I asked him how he felt the first
time he ever gave messages he said, "I never knew
that anyone could feel like folding up—but you
can."
He said he could hardly stand to give his
messages, his knees were so weak. As he looks
back now, he thinks that perhaps he might not have
developed quite enough before he tried to give pub
lic work. But evidently the people thought it was
all right for they asked him to work again. He has
continued to this day, giving messages and inspiring
his congregations with fine lectures. But it is
easier for him to look back on forty-five years of
service than it was for him to look ahead to the
next few minutes on that first night in Joplin.
Once Mr. Burroughs was managing a trip
through Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma for
Maggie Vestal, the daylight trumpet medium.
They left Wichita and were going to Hutchinson
by train to fill an engagement that night. Sud-
enly there was a muffled voice which seemed to
come from the train seat in which Mrs. Vestal was
sitting. This unmistakably male voice was heard
by a stranger who was sitting behind Mrs. Vestal.
Then others in the car heard the sounds, which by
now had become several voices all intermingled

The source of these voices was the little leather
trumpet case which Mrs. Vestal always carried with
her and which was resting on the seat beside her.
By this time the entire car full of people had
gathered around. The trumpet was taken from its
case and a daylight trumpet circle was being held
on that train! Someone went through the train
telling people in other cars about the strange hap
penings, and before long a stream of passengers
was pouring in. Mr. Burroughs said that he
thought they had everyone in their car except the
engineer.
The trainmen came in, and demanded that the
whole proceeding be stopped, but the passengers
were enjoying themselves and wouldn't hear to it.
The rear coach was a special car carrying a travel
ling company of a musical show, "The Texas Steer
Company." They came to enjoy this unusual
seance, too. The crowd in the car and the delay
in getting people on and off at their stops delayed
the train so that it was half an hour late getting
into Hutchinson.
I wonder if the conductor's report read, "Delayed
one half hour between Wichita and Hutchinson by
spirit voices."
One of the greatest incidents of Mr. Burroughs
niediumship took place in Washington, D. C, in
1935. In one home where he held class, the lady
had fallen downstairs which injured her leg so that
the doctor said she would never walk without
crutches.
One evening he said to this lady, "I am going to

heal you." He told her to remove the yards of
wrapping around her leg. Then he sat for a little
while with his hands cupped around her knee. He
sent out a call for Black Eagle, his Indian healing
helper, and offered a prayer to God that the lady
might be healed.
After sitting in silence for a few moments, every
one in the room heard a loud snap, like a bone
going into place. Within himself, Burroughs knew
that the work was done. He went into a connect
ing room a few feet away and called the lady to
come to him. She reached for her crutches, but
he told her to walk without them. She tried a
step, then another, and finally she realized that she
was walking without help for the first time in
months.
Tears came into her eyes, and into Mr. Bur
roughs' too. The lady is eighty-one years old now,
still able to walk, and never tires of telling this
story. The next day her doctor came to visit her.
She met him at the door and told him of the event.
He listened in amazement, and all he could say was
"I take my hat off to that man. I want to meet
him." A meeting was arranged, and the doctor
and Mr. Burroughs have been good friends ever
since.
Originally, Mr. Burroughs was a Scotch Cum
berland Presbyterian. But he has found that Spir
itualism has given him a philosophy which fills his
every need. He believes that the greatest gift we
can bestow upon others is a good example. To him
birth and death are only incidents in the ever

Mamie B. Sckulz
W much is mediumship worth? Its value can
not be estimated in dollars and cents. Is it worth
losing the friendship of your own loved mother?
Mamie Schulz so believed in Spiritualism and the
great value of mediumship that she was willing to
pay this great price.
At one time Mrs. Shulz' mother was so set
against her daughter's going into mediumship, and
Mrs. Shulz was so determined to do so, that one
of them would cross the street whenever the two
met so as to avoid speaking to the other. Her mo
ther, Mrs. Hansen, being of the Catholic faith, was
certain that Mamie was doing the wrong thing
when she began to investigate Spiritualism. But
when she took up the development of mediumship,
then Mrs. Hansen was positive that Mamie had
made the greatest mistake of her life. It turned
out that she never made a finer decision. And it
also turned out that Mrs. Schulz did not have to pay
the price of her mother's love, for Mrs. Hansen be

came a Spiritualist too, convinced of it through her
daughter's mediumship. She loved nothing better
than to sit in the grove at Camp Chesterfield and
listen to her daughter speak or give messages. And
what began as a family rift finally served to draw
them closer together.
When her father passed to spirit, Mrs. Schulz
had a vision of him. He spoke to her, and made
her know that he still lived. Later on, a friend
took her to a seance. The medium was Mary
Murphy Lydy, a well known name in mediumship
which many readers of this book will recognize.
In this seance Mrs. Schulz' father spoke to her and
gave proof that it was really himself. He spoke in
Danish. Mrs. Schulz says, "That was all I needed."
This happened in 1914. Mrs. Schulz began sit
ting for development almost immediately, and sat
for four years before she felt herself qualified to
do any public work. She lived in Ft. Wayne, Indi
ana, and sat in the development class which was
conducted by Mary Dewey. The first phase of me
diumship which she developed was clairvoyance.
Clairaudience soon followed, and not long after
wards she began doing billet reading. Then she
unfolded trance and in later years, after continued
sitting for development, she developed trumpet me
diumship.
Mrs. Schulz' first prominence came to her as a
result of her fine work in reading billets. She was
one of the first to demonstrate this particular phase
of mediumship. Oddly enough, she says that her
temper and quick manner of speech were two things

she had to overcome before developing this phasie.
The reason for this is that in touching a billet the
reader often will know immediately the general
attitude of the person who has written it. Mrs.
Schulz was apt to react in like manner to those who
had written their billets in a critical frame of mind.
When her temper was aroused she was not able
to make the spiritual contact nearly as successfully
as when she kept her poise. And further, she
sometimes spoke before she thought, with results
that sometimes were embarrassing to persons in the
congregation and to herself.
But, unlike some, she was aware of her short
comings and realized they were hurting her chances
for further development. She also resolved to
overcome them. With a smile on her face she will
tell you, "It wasn't easy," and that even now she
must ever be on her guard. She says that gaining
control and mastery over yourself is one of the
first steps to mediumship—and she should know.
As she was one of the pioneers in billet work, I
asked Mrs. Schulz to give students some pointers on
the development of blindfold billet reading. Mrs.
Schulz is a fine worker in this phase of mediumship.
I have heard her give billet readings without even
having the billets collected from the audience. So
I know she is well qualified to give help to students
interested in developing this phase.
Much of billet reading is done by psychometry,
or through the sense of touch. In touching a bil
let, an impulse or impression is flashed to the mind
of the medium. This psychic impression sometimes

needs interpretation and sometimes may be given
just as it is received. Other senses besides that of
touch are also used in billet work, and so are clair
voyance and clairaudience. The good billet read
er combines all phases. But first let us examine
pure psychometry and Mrs. Schulz' ideas for its
development.
Mrs. Schulz says that a good method of practic
ing psychometry is to use an article given you by
a friend. This article may be a purse, a letter,
watch, ring or some similar personal effect. Be
fore touching the article it is well to free your mind
from all outside influences and all your own
thoughts about the person to whom it belongs.
Making yourself as relaxed as possible, mentally
as well as physically, take the article in your hand.
If you have freed your mind of all other thought
it will catch an impression of some type as soon as
the article is in your hand. At first it is well, and
easier, to attempt to catch character impressions of
the person to whom the article belongs. The phys
ical condition of the person is also easier to catch
by impression than some of the more complicated
conditions of the person's life. The mental states,
such as buoyancy, depression and others, may be
flashed to your mind upon touching the article.
This impression or psychic impulse that travels
to your mind will not be strong at first. It will
be a very subtle impulse. But it will be there, and
if you will practice it you will soon be able to sense,
mentally, these impulses in much stronger fashion.
Sometimes touching the article to the forehead

will help you receive a quicker impression. Mrs.
Schulz does not ask you to take her word as author
ity for all this. She urges you to try it for your
self and see that it works.
Another method of practicing psychometry is to
use the letters that the mailman leaves for you.
Before opening a letter, hold it for a few seconds
in your hand, just as you do with articles. Watch
for the impressions which come to you about the
general state of mind of the person who wrote the
letter. As you develop this ability it often will be
possible for you to tell even the general thought of
the letter's contents. And sometimes even the
exact wording of parts of sentences will leap into
your mind. This is something that every person
can practice in his own home, without attending a
developing class or sitting with a teacher.
After practicing with these objects for some time,
and acquiring the ability of "reading" them, it is
well to practice with the billets themselves. Have
a friend, or several friends, address small slips of
paper by putting the name of a spirit person at the
top. Then they should ask a question which that
person could reasonably answer, and sign their
name at the bottom. Mix the slips thoroughly on
a table at which you should be seated in a comfort
able position. Pick one of the slips at random
and, holding it in your hand, try to catch the im
pressions which come to you just as you did with
the articles.
In working with billets you must add other facul
ties to that of impression from the billet itself.

You could read all the billets in the world and not
be able to answer them except from your own judg
ment and experience. But this is not what you are
seeking. You want an answer from the person to
whom the billet was written. This answer you
may catch from the spirit person by impression,
just as you pick up impressions from articles. Or
you may receive it inspirationally from that person.
Or it may come to you by clairvoyance or clair-
audience.
The billet reader must be alert to every phase of
mediumship which he posesses. He may "feel" or
"sense" in the touch of his fingers or other parts of
his body, or in his mind. He may see visions, or
hear spirit voices. You will notice that most bil
let readers speak at a very fast rate. They are
trying to speak the things which already have come
to them in time to catch something from some other
sense or phase of mediumship. They do not take
time to think a single thought of their own, keep
ing their mind and all other senses free to receive
the things which come from the spirit person to
whom the billet has been written.
Of course billet reading can be done from psy-
. chometry and inspiration alone. But it is much
more effective when combined with the other
phases. Psychometry itself, Mrs. Schulz feels, is
not difficult to develop. She says that many peo
ple are endowed with this ability and use it without
even knowing it.
When first working with billets written by
friends, it is well only to try and "place" the billet

you are holding, or tell who wrote it. When this
contact is established for certain, then you can go
on to see what you receive in answering the ques
tion. Practicing with friends in this way, you can
then open the billet and read it after you have
given all the impressions you have received. This
will help you to develop your ability to interpret
visions and impressions that have come to you, for
you will know immediately the question which has
been asked.
Later on, still practicing with your friends, you
can try blindfolding yourself. Although the blind
fold keeps you from seeing the billet at all, this is
not its sole purpose. It also helps to shut out all
vision and thus greatly reduces the intrusion of
sight impulses. Some mediums tape their eyes
closed with adhesive tape before putting on the
blindfold. Others put powder puffs over their
eyes, or use hankerchiefs for this purpose.
Mrs. Schulz says that using the billet phase of
mediumship helps the medium contact more peo
ple who are new to Spiritualism and the phenome
na. It does this because the added vibratory
strength of the billet contact helps the medium
make a better attunement with spirit people who
are not experienced at manifesting. It also helps
the medium to "tune in" the ones to whom the
billet has been written and "tune out" the others.
Mrs. Schulz had an experience some years ago
which illustrates this fact. A Mr. Joe Phillips, of
Marion, Indiana, invited Mrs. Schulz, Etta Bledsoe
and Mable Riffle to conduct a meeting in that city.

The ladies met Mr. Phillips at the home of a mutual
friend in Marion and from there he drove them to
the meeting place. There was a great deal of traffic
on the streets and the sidewalks were filled with
people, but no comment was made about this as the
party was enjoying a general discussion about
Spiritualism.
The ladies thought they were going to some type
of hall which they supposed had been rented
specially for the meeting. They were flabbergasted
when Mr. Phillips drove them into the Marion fair
grounds and announced that this was where the
meeting was to be held!
He had erected a platform in the middle of the
race track from which they were to speak and give
messages. There was not a vacant seat in the fair
grounds. Over four thousand people had gathered
to witness the Spiritualistic demonstration which
Mr. Phillips had advertised for miles around with
ten thousand handbills.
Mrs. Bledsoe gave a lecture on Spiritualism.
Mrs. Riffle gave independent messages. And Mrs.
Schulz read the billets. She had a mountain of
them on the table before her. Every time she
called a name about fifteen people would answer.
Then she would have to bring something further
in order to make sure she was contacting the right
person with the message she was giving. The
night was almost a nightmare for the ladies, but
they carried through with their work. They had
to shout at the top of their voices in order to make
themselves heard. You can imagine that Mrs.

Schulz had to have every bit of her psychic ability
keenly alert in order to read the billets that night.
It is believed that this was one of the largest audi
ences ever to attend a Spiritualist meeting, if not
the largest.
Mrs. Schulz is known for her mediumship
throughout the nation. She is a member of the
National Spiritualist Association. In her early
mediumship she travelled to nearly every city in
Indiana and Michigan, and later almost everywhere.
For many years she has been pastor of the First
Association of Spiritualists in Philadelphia, Penn
sylvania, the oldest organized Spiritualist society
in the United States. It was at a service in this
church, before a congregation of over five hundred
people, that I watched her read billets without
having them collected from the people. They just
held them in their hands, or in their purses and
pockets, and she brought them their messages, not
only from the ones to whom the billets were written
but from other spirit people as well.
The first Spiritualist service that Mrs. Schulz ever
conducted was in Huntington, Indiana. She was
quite nervous but managed to calm herself and
forget her nervousness when she started her part
of the service. She has been in mediumship for
over twenty-eight years, and still is nervous before
a service is started. She says, "If I am not ner
vous, then I don't do nearly as well as I can. Be
ing nervous gives me, somehow, extra energy and
enthusiasm once I get into the swing of it."
She has plenty of enthusiasm and energy. Dur

wheel chairs for the men in the government hos
pitals. She is a member of the Amaranth Order
and the Order of the Eastern Star, the Second Fid
dle Club, the 51 Club and Past Matrons Club. As
a hobby she collects figurines. Mrs. Schulz has just
completed a very successful fourteen year pastorate
at the First Association in Philadelphia, and now
makes her home in Chesterfield, Indiana.
She says that, "In all things, love is the greatest
power there is—and God is Love." She also says
that she received much in her Catholic training that
was valuable to her in her Spiritualistic work. The
art of meditation and the power of prayer are two
things she has brought with her from Catholicism.
For her, the only beginning to every day is a prayer
for success in helping others.

Albert E. Vaughn Strode
-T ROM one far corner of this country to the other,
Albert E. Vaughn Strode lectures to large groups
and small, in large churches and in small halls.
Wherever he goes, the people receive spiritual in
struction and upliftment. He gives message ser
vices and private consultations. He is a tireless
worker on behalf of the world of spirit and the
truths of Spiritualism.
He says, "Mediumship is God manifesting
through mankind." He knows that the natural
laws which make mediumship possible are God's
laws, and that man is the instrument through which
these laws are put to use.
There are a few leading Spiritualist workers
who never needed to sit in a developing class to
develop their mediumship. It was simply natural
to them, just as musical or artistic ability is to
some people. Mr. Vaughn Strode is one who did
not have a developing teacher in unfolding his me
diumship. He always has been aware of what he

calls "the presence" about him, and knew that this
presence was his spirit teacher and helper.
Mr. Vaughn Strode was reared in a very strict,
dogmatic orthodox religious faith in which he was
taught that when a person died he remained that
way until the resurrection day. To him this teach
ing was quite absurd —especially since he had seen
many spirit people. In fact he saw, in spirit, the
people whose physical bodies he had seen buried
from the church. The church said they were dead.
Mr. Vaughn Strode knew them to be very much
alive. To him they were as real as any 'of the
friends he saw daily in earth life. So he left the
church, and has devoted the rest of his life to teach
ing the truth which he knows from first-hand
experience.
Mr. Vaughn Strode is a fine inspirational speaker.
Ideas on the development of inspirational speaking
may be gleaned from his own experiences in the
work.
"When I arise to address vast audiences, there
are times when I am as if petrified. Fright grips
me, and I wonder what I shall say to those who
have come to hear me. Of a sudden I am aware
of forces 'round me. A teacher, known to me as
Master Morah, stands directly back of me. There
are always two teachers with him, and they stand
on each side of me. It is as if a great electric
battery has charged my entire body. Quickly then,
I am speaking words and sentences as I hear them
spoken by Master Morah, and sometimes the others.

commonly called trance, but I believe it to be the
semi-conscious trance state, and I voice the mes
sage which is brought by the teachers."
"I will put my Spirit within you," say the Scrip
tures, and Mr. Vaughn Strode, in his speaking, at
tempts to be the proper vessel into which the Spir
it may be placed. There are times when the act
ual word of the inspiring spirit may be heard. On
other occasions it is more an inner realization of the
message the spirit is trying to bring. Sometimes
the bare thought is placed in his mind and he must
put it into words of his own choosing. And some
times entire sentences are flashed into his mind,
word by word, as thought impulses.
There are some who feel that speaking in this
way does not require any preparation; that every
thing can be left to the inspiring spirit. Mr.
Vaughn Strode says that this is not true. When
Master Morah flashes some thought into his mind
it comes so quickly that often he cannot give it
word for word. He must draw upon his own in
tellectual resources to put the thought in present
able form. Different audiences require varying
presentations of the same thought, and the speak
er must have at his command the ability to put
these thoughts in the manner which will be most
effective to the particular audience listening at the
moment.
Mr. Vaughn Strode counsels every person who
has ambitions toward inspirational speaking to
spend much time in study and meditation. In this
way he will be making of himself a better instru-

ment for bringing the Word of God to the people
through spiritual manifestations. Another reason
for spending much time in study is to help the
student attract spirit teachers of high calibre.
He says, "It is my belief that mediumship is God's
greatest gift to man. Since God is spirit, our me
diumship should be the most spiritual part about
us. We, as mediators between the mortal world
and that of immortality, should sense the sacred-
ness and the great responsibility of the precious
gifts with which we are entrusted.
"It is the duty of every medium to attract unto
himself teachers and collaborators from the spirit
world who are educated and who possess culture
and refinement. We are to remember that like
does attract like, and that as we send out the
thoughts for the finest and greatest teachers we
shall attract them. Ours is a wonderful work, and
we can accomplish this work only with the aid of
those who are capable of assisting us."
Mr. Vaughn Strode feels that the successful ap
proach to any phase of mediumship depends much
upon the mental attitude in which development is
undertaken. He advises the student to make sure
not only of his own sincerity but also that of any
other people with whom he might be sitting.
"Have your mind free from care and material
things." he counsels. "Be open minded and re
ceptive, and if you possess natural God-given
powers they will manifest in one, or more, phases
of mediumship. Be happy and altogether natural
about your unfoldment. ": *

"Enter the seance or unfoldment room with joy
in your heart. Leave care and sadness outside —
for the spirit folk are happy and they want to con
tact happy people in the mortal. Sadness and a
depressed feeling build a wall which is difficult for
spirit people to penetrate. Therefore, one of the
pre-requisites to the unfoldment of mediumship is
a happy frame of mind, and a real desire to learn."
Mr. Vaughn Strode also places great faith in the
value of sincerity of purpose within those who are
attempting development of a high spiritual quality.
He says, "Sincerity, in your unfoldment of medium-
ship, is your key to success as it is in all things. A
desire to grow and to acquire knowledge, and to
pass this knowledge on to others, will assist the
student or beginner in unfoldment more than any
thing else."
Mr. Vaughn Strode thinks that perhaps one hin
drance to development in many aspiring students
is the manner in which they look upon their teach
ers. He says that though they are spirit people,
we must realize that they are human beings as
natural as we are.
He tells students to "Treat your spirit helpers as
you would your earth friends. Love and respect
them as you would loved ones on earth. They are,
indeed, your truest friends and will do anything
to help you. Never be demanding of them; neither
are you ever to command them. They merit re
spect the same as those around you on earth. You
will find that when earth friends fail, and leave
you at times, your friends and teachers from the

world beyond will cling closely to you and lend
that great assurance and understanding which is
not possessed by many who are in the earth body.
"They are your 'guardian angels.' They see, and
know, and realize your every need. Therefore,
come to know your spirit helpers, and always trust
them. Their loyalty will prove itself over and over
again. Your struggles and vicissitudes while on
earth will be made easier because of their constant
watch over you."
Mr. Vaughn Strode possesses an ability known as
astral projection. He is able to project his spiritual
self into the astral world and then bring back to
his consciousness a recollection of the scenes he has
visited and the people to whom he has talked. He
uses this ability in another line of endeavor, aside
from Spiritualism, for which he is quite well
known. After visiting beautiful scenes in the
world of spirit, he holds them in his mind and then
paints or sketches them. He is a graduate of the
great Art Institute of Chicago, but ascribes much
of his artistic ability to the guidance and inspiration
of his spirit teachers.
In the world of spirit, on these astral trips, he
has found scenes of beauty and color which far
surpass anything which can be viewed on earth.
He remembers these scenes as closely as he pbssibly
can, and then transmits them to canvas when he
has returned to his physical body. When doing
the actual art work, he says that he is aware of
spirit hands guiding his own hands. Sometimes he
will close his eyes for a few seconds and then clair

voyantly see beautiful compositions and etheric de
signs which he paints or sketches. After seeing
these visions, he has no rest until he fulfills the
urge to place them on canvas.
He feels that it is possible for many people to
enjoy astral visits of this same type. It requires
practice and development, the same as any phase
of mediumship. He suggests that in attempting to
project yourself astrally, you call upon your spirit
teachers to be with you and help in performing
your objective. In addition to helping you project
your spiritual self into realms of spirit, they
will be able to conduct you to various scenes of
interest and guard you against any unseen and
unknown dangers.
In the universe about you is all knowledge.
Many answers to your own problems can be ob
tained by allowing the spirit self to gain this know
ledge during an astral flight, then communicating
the information to your conscious mind. At night,
when you are calm and relaxed, be in the silence
for a few moments and send to your inner self an
urge to travel in spirit realms. If you have a
special problem, request the answer to it. The
spirit, which is the real you, is all powerful and
can accomplish the mission for which you have
prayed. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
you."
When you retire for the night, send the same
urge to your inner self—ask it to travel the realms
celestial, there to find knowledge and wisdom and

power. Probably your first experiences in astral
projection will be no more than visits with some of
your teachers. But as you become more proficient
at this projection you will be able to travel great
distances from your body without danger or ill
result of any kind. In fact, you will find the ex
periences most enjoyable, educational and very in
spiring. You will return to your body with a new
concept of eternal life and a greater understanding
of the world of spirit.
In addition to his mediumship and artistic abili
ties, Mr. Vaughn Strode is a musician of note and
has composed many beautiful poems. In these two
branches of the artistic world, he also has noted the
presence of spiritual help. The inspiration and en
couragement which he has received from spiritual
sources has urged him ever to strive for the best
that he could accomplish in all his work.
He finds in music especially a vibratory influence
which is conducive to a greater awareness of things
eternal. He says that when attending a concert
it oftentimes seems as if the heavens open and
divine inspiration comes from the world beyond,
bidding him glimpse that which is real and eternal.
The invitation also is to share this deep inspiration
and knowledge of truth with others.
He does share it, travelling everywhere as a mis
sionary of the National Spiritualist Association.
He serves churches all over the country and for
several years has been one of the outstanding work
ers at Lily Dale Assembly in New York. His

is in Enid, Oklahoma.
Mr. Vaughn Strode feels that mediumship has
a great mission to perform here on earth. The
world's greatest famine is in the hungering of man
kind for a spiritual understanding which will help
him to live a successful life.
He says, "Mediumship's greatest mission is to
open the doors which separate the world of mortal
from that of immortal. The mission of the true
medium is to lift the veil and bid the investigator
look beyond, and there glimpse the beauties and the
wonders of the world where dwell his loved ones—
and the home to which he will one day journey.
Mediumship means service, and service to human
ity is indeed the fulfillment of God's laws upon
earth."

Clifford L. Bias
CoULD you imagine a person going to his first
developing circle and sleeping through the entire
procedure? That's what Clifford Bias did. And
he has been sleeping through circles ever since. Of
course he's not really sleeping —he's entranced.
When he was just fourteen years old he attended
his first developing circle. This was in Hunting
ton, West Virginia. The circle was conducted by
Mrs. Effie Fulton, who charged twenty-five cents
for the privilege of sitting in her developing class.
As soon as the meeting started, Clifford went to
sleep, and he didn't wake up until the circle was
finished.
He decided that he wouldn't go back again. He
couldn't see any reason for spending twenty-five
cents just to go to sleep. In fact he thought it was
silly. He could sleep at home and it wouldn't cost
him anything at all was the way he reasoned. The
rest of the people who attended exitedly told him
that spirits had talked through him while he was

sleeping. The excitement of these people about
spirits' talking didn't affect Clifford a bit, for he
knew that could happen at home too. So he never
went back.
But he did keep on developing his mediumship.
And today Clifford Bias is recognized as possessing
outstanding psychic ability wherever he goes. He
is a leading medium, a teacher, and a writer. His
book called Trumpet Mediumship, published by the
Dale News, is a "best seller" among Spiritualistic
works. All of this from the boy who slept through
his first circle!
Clifford's family used to worry about him when
he was a child. He was always running to them
with stories about the children with whom he was
playing. The name of one of the children was
Pepper. The reason his family worried so was be
cause there wasn't any such person as Pepper.
They scoured the neighborhood, but could learn of
no such child. However, when Clifford was ques
tioned about it he steadfastly maintained that he
had been playing with Pepper.
Actually he was playing with Pepper. But what
his family did not know was that Pepper was a
spirit. An interesting fact about Pepper is that he
really grew up with Clifford. It is just as though
he was a spiritual counterpart, for he has become
one of Mr. Bias' guides and thousands of people
have heard his voice in Mr. Bias' seances. When
they were youngsters, Pepper was just as real and
lifelike to Clifford as any person of the earth plane
He remains that way today. It is not unusual for

children to have spirit playmates. But this is one
of the very rare cases in which one of these play
mates grew with the person through adolescence
to maturity, and continued on as a guiding
influence.
When you attend Mr. Bias' classes you must be
prepared to delve deeply into the subject of Spirit
ualism in a scientific way. He recommends that
students who are sitting for development should
understand the theory of psychical science before
going on to its practice. If the students are in his
own classes, he insists upon it. He maintains that
a much better practice of psychic science can be
accomplished when it is founded upon a good
groundwork of psychic theory. And this conten
tion is entirely reasonable.
Of course in this short space it would be impos
sible to give a comprehensive study of psychic
theory. To give but one or two examples, Mr. Bias
cites as one of the fundamental laws which stu
dents must understand is that the active always
controls the passive. This might be illustrated by
pointing to the muscle of your arm. Energy is
transmitted through this muscle and the entire arm
is made to move. You can quickly see how this
would apply to such forms of mediumship as slate
writing and trumpet.
Another law which he asks students to study is
the law of conservation of energy. Energy can
neither be created nor destroyed. Every energy
is taken from some previous form of energy.
These are just examples of the studies which Mr.

Bias deems necessary as a prelude to the develop
ment of mediumship. There are some people who
would rather not bother their heads about such
things. They figure that the guides can do it all
so why should they worry about it. But an under
standing of all the laws of mediumship will help the
medium to be of greater assistance to the guides. A
better understanding of what those guides are try
ing to do makes for a closer relationship and better
co-operation between guide and medium. Better
psychic results are then inevitable.
Mr. Bias recommends that students study from
the following books: Guide To Mediumship by
Delta Samadhi, The Laws of Mediumship by C. C.
Zain, Guide To Mediumship by E. W. Wallis,
Biopneuma by Levi, What Mediumship Is by Horace
Leaf, Psychic Control by W. W. Kenil worth.
To save Mr. Bias from receiving a lot of letters
asking where these books can be obtained, I must
add here that many of them are out of print.
Spiritualist papers and magazines carry advertise
ments which describe used books of these titles
which are available. In cities, second hand book
stores may be a source of supplying them. The "in
print" books may be obtained through your usual
book source.
If you are sitting for the unfoldment of the men
tal phases of mediumship, Mr. Bias says you must
acquire the ability to receive, translate and trans
mit information from the spirit planes of life to
dwellers on the earth plane. If you are developing
nny of the physical phases, you are attempting to

act as a center into which energy can be accumu
lated and then used for the production of physical
phenomena.
Mr. Bias is well known for his work in trumpet
mediumship, a physical phase, and for the unusual
manifestations and demonstrations which take place
in his trumpet circles. So he speaks with authority
when he gives advice to students who are attempt
ing to attain direct voice mediumship. Here are
some of his ideas about the development of the
direct voice phase —some of them in his own words :
"I think it is interesting that I did not develop
direct voice mediumhip until I had sat with a direct
voice medium. I think the 'power' working
through another medium acts as a catalyst, or mo
tivating agent, which stimulates and brings into
activity the latent force of one's own direct voice
mediumship." And he adds that John W. Bunker
was the first direct voice medium he ever sat with.
Mr. Bias has other thoughts on this subject which
will aid students in their development. He recom
mends several private sittings with any prospective
teacher you have in mind to make sure of harmon
ious vibration and congeniality between student
and teacher. As to class work—he says that the
class should be regarded as one of the most sacred
hours. It is here that you come in touch with
teachers and guides of the higher spheres of life.
It is here that much of your own unfoldment opens
for you. No care is too great in preparation for
entering the class room. Both mind and body must
be clean. Harmony between class members is of

the utmost importance.
And here Mr. Bias offers an important resolution
which every student class member should make.
He should know that some will progress faster than
others, that perhaps he will not gain his medium-
ship as quickly as the person sitting next to him.
And he should resolve to be thankful for every
manifestation that comes and for every develop
ment of mediumship, even though it does not come
to himself. The unfoldment of any person is cause
for joy by all members of a class and not just the
one it comes to.
Mr. Bias recommends that a diary of your own
development be kept. This will help you to see
your progress from time to time. Aspirants to
development are apt to become discouraged and
feel that progression is not coming as fast as it
might. A glance at this diary, if faithfully kept,
will usually show that much more progress has
been made than realized by the student.
In the developing circle itself, Mr. Bias recom
mends that an equal number of persons of each sex
be present, and seated alterately. These people
should be seated in a circle around the outside of
the room, not in rows across it.
Starting at the same time each night, the class
should be opened with a prayer and hymn. Often
times it is well to have the room in subdued light
for the first half of the class, then darkened for the
last half. This will allow for development of both
mental and physical mediumship during the same
class.

After the opening song, a period of meditation
and concentration should be observed. From time
to time, song should be interspersed with these
meditation periods during the class meeting. Re
sults probably will be slow in coming, as psychical
adjustment is necessary before spiritual communi
cation can be established.
Before there is any development directly in con
nection with direct voice, there may be other phy
sical manifestations taking place. There may be
raps or taps on various objects of furniture or on
the trumpet. Sometimes communications can be
received through these taps by the arranging of a
code by which the sitters' questions can be
answered.
At first the trumpet should be placed upon a table
in a horizontal position. This is because voices
usually can be produced before levitation is possi
ble. The first voices will be faint, probably only
whispers. After the voices become loud enough
and sustained enough so that conversation is possi
ble, you will be able to learn through whose me-
diumship the manifestation is being accomplished.
"Every person cannot develop trumpet medium-
ship," says Mr. Bias. "To those who can, it comes
quickly for some and with others requires years of
development. No person, either of spirit or of
earth, can tell just how quickly this or any other
phase of mediumship will be developed in any indi
vidual. There are too many contributing factors
to be able to prophesy time of development with
any accuracy whatsoever.

"The thoughts you send out create a light which
is seen by spirit people. It attracts them to you.
Therefore, your thoughts should be of such nature
as to attract only the most desirable. Your spirit
ual earnestness is of paramount importance."
Mr. Bias' first religious training came when he
attended the United Brethern Sunday school as a
child. But he hungered for teachings which were
different than this school could give him. He be
gan reading all the spiritual and psychic books he
could find. These teachings were augmented by
the spirit guides who were attracted to him. Dr.
Lasceles, Sylvia (a little girl with a fund of spirit
ual knowledge), and Pepper have given him much
spiritual understanding. The voices of these guides
are familiar to Spiritualists throughout the country.
Mr. Bias says that he had no obstacles to over
come in attaining mediumship. Rather, he had ob
stacles in trying to do anything else. Several times
in his early life he tried other vocations, among
them being an actor on an Ohio river showboat.
But always he has been led back into mediumship,
and he has practiced it continuously since 1933. He
has given readings since he was fourteen. The first
mediumship that came to him was his clairvoyance.
The phase of psychometry followed some time later.
Then in 1937 he developed the trumpet phase. In
addition to trumpet and clairvoyance, he now prac
tices clairaudience, independent voice and partial
materialization.
His first public work was in Huntington, where
he later organized a church. He is a member of

the Spiritualist Episcopal Church and the Indiana
Association of Spiritualists. Every winter he con
ducts church services in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Some of his time is spent in serving other churches
all over the United States.
One day in his early mediumship, a lady came to
Mr. Bias for a reading which she duly received.
She seemed to be pleased with her reading, and
upon leaving gave him a few words of praise. The
next visitors were two policemen who informed him
that he was under arrest. He was taken to jail and
locked up. This was on the day before New Year,
and Mr. Bias spent a dreary New Year's eve and
New Year day in jail. It seems the lady claimed
that he had stolen her diamond during the course
of the reading.
She was rather vague as to just how the theft
was accomplished, but was sure that she had the
diamond when she went to Mr. Bias and that she
discovered she did not have it soon after leaving
his home. The day after New Year's, the lady
called the police and informed them that her sister
had found the diamond at home, and would they
please let that young man out of jail. He was freed
with a warning to "stay away from such stuff as
fortune telling."
One of the policemen who arrested Mr. Bias was
named Al Jessup. Some time after this incident
he became an ardent Spiritualist, and Mr. Bias has
held many seances in the Jessup home in
Huntington!

The very first mediumistic experience that Mr.
Bias ever had was when he was quite small. His
sister, Georgia, and some of her friends were ex
perimenting with "table walking." But they were
not having any success. More or less as a joke,
someone suggested that they: "Let Clifford put his
hands on the table." Whereupon Clifford marched
up to the table, laid his hands on it, and was as
frightened as anyone else when it was propelled
clear across the room. Clifford made a running
dive underneath the sofa.
Attracted by the screams of the entire group,
Clifford's mother rushed upon the scene. She
rescued him from his hiding place with much dif
ficulty and demanded that a stop be put to all this
sort of thing, which she termed "the devil's work."
But later Mrs. Bias was to enjoy her son's me-
diumship just as thousands of others have. She
became one of his "converts" and a better Spirit
ualist could not be found. It was my privilege to
have met Mrs. Bias several times before her passing
to spirit. She was a kind, gentle woman —a fine
person. And of course she was proud of her son
and the work he was doing —and with a good
reason for being so.
Mr. Bias has two hobbies, widely dissimilar.
One is analytical chemistry. Of course this ex
plains his interest in the mechanics of mediumship.
His other hobby is as unusual as the first, if not
more so. He collects circus programs. Hj2 and
Hugh Gordon Burroughs must be kindred spirits.
If you will send Mr. Bias an old circus or play pro

When Mr. Bias thinks of people, he thinks of all
people—those on earth of every race, and those in
spirit realms. He says, "I, along with all others,
am a citizen of the universe, existing in eternity."
This is the basis upon which he builds his philoso
phy of life. And it is a solid foundation.

Nellie Curry
Dm you ever pray for something that you would
be afraid of if you received it? Nellie Curry did.
She prayed that she might see a spirit, but was as
sure as she could be that she would be afraid if
she ever saw one.
Finally she did see one. And she wasn't afraid
at all.
Since that time Nellie Curry has seen and heard
thousands and thousands of spirit people. She has
transmitted their messages of comfort and advice
to people in every part of the United States. She
has thrilled huge audiences with her message work
and has brought tears of appreciation to the eyes
of individuals who have come to her for readings.
And never has she been afraid of a spirit.
In 1915, a friend took Mrs. Curry to visit the first
medium she ever saw. The medium was a Mrs.
Mitchell, of East St. Louis, Illinois. She told Mrs.

Curry that there were fine possibilities of medium-
ship for her. "You are psychic, and it would not
take long for you to develop," she said.
Mrs. Curry, thrilled with this news, became
very enthusiastic about such possibilities and ar
ranged for a class of ten people to sit with Mrs.
Mitchell twice a week. She also went to this me
dium every day for a private class, and sat at home
by herself every day. She was determined to de
velop mediumship no matter how much time it
required.
Along with all this, she cared for her five child
ren. She used to send her two oldest girls to
school, put the boys in the back room to play, and
put her baby girl on the bed to take a nap. Then
she would sit in the bed room, darkening it some
what by pulling the shades down. She always put
a chair by the bed to keep the baby from rolling
off. She would pray to God to let her see a spirit,
and at the same time being afraid that she might.
But she kept looking just the same.
One day she glanced at the chair alongside the.
baby's bed and there sat her mother-in-law, as real
as she ever saw her in life. She even had on a
grey dress that looked exactly like one that Mrs.
Curry had made for her!
She smiled at Mrs. Curry, and said, "You are not
afraid of me, are you?"
"No, ma, I couldn't be afraid of you!"
Her mother-in-law went on, "We are all together,
and John Will just came, too."
Mrs. Curry was startled at this statement.

"John Will isn't dead," she said. "How could he
be with you?"
Her mother-in-law just smiled, nodded her head,
and disappeared! Mrs. Curry couldn't understand
what she had meant by saying that John Will was
with her. He was living, and was the son of the
lady herself. Mrs. Curry puzzled over this for a
moment, and then she realized that she had seen a
spirit and wasn't afraid of it. It had all seemed
so natural that she hadn't even realized it till this
moment.
She looked at the clock. It was two in the after
noon. At six o'clock that same evening the family
received a telegram stating that John Will had
dropped dead at ten o'clock on that morning. This
experience proved to others of her family and
friends that there was something to this business
of seeing people who were dead, and hearing them,
so Mrs. Curry worked harder than ever to become
a good medium.
She did become a good medium, as those who
have heard her well know. She travels through
out the midwest, south and west as a missionary of
the Spiritualist Episcopal Church, conducting
church services and giving readings. Her work in
clairvoyance and clairaudience is outstanding in
every respect.
Those who are interested in the development of
these phases will do well to experiment with Mrs.
Curry's method of development. Her first advice
is to learn to relax, for it is only through being
relaxed that you can make the proper attunement

to see and hear the people of spirit. The next
step in her particular method of development is
unique—here it is in her own words—
"Form a mental picture of some object and con
centrate on it. For example, choose a rosebud.
Watch the rosebud open, petal by petal, in your
mental picture. Investigate every minute detail
of the bud. See its color, the shape of the petals,
the size and so on. Use other objects, too—alarm
clocks, jewels, telephones —there are a thousand
subjects.
"After you have practiced with these inanimate
objects until you have perfected your ability to
visualize and examine them, try visualizing people.
For a subject, take a person whom you don't know
very well. See this person in front of you. Notice
every detail about him.
"Then ask your guides to give you something for
this person, something that will have meaning to
him if not to you. Have a tablet and pencil at
hand, and each time you sit, write down the things
that come to you for the person on whom you are
concentrating. Probably you will write quickly
without paying much attention to the words or
symbols that you are putting down. Then, when
you have finished, go back to the beginning and
check through all the things you have written.
"At first it may be nothing more than symbols,
or little things that you do not understand —per
haps it won't even make sense for you. But as
you continue to practice you will find things com
ing to you that have more meaning. As your spir

itual vision develops out of the original mental
pictures you will find that your notebook contains
more and more of real value."
Mrs. Curry advises that all students sit in class
with a developed teacher. But if you live where
it is impossible for you to do this, she suggests
that a group of seven or more go together for sit
tings and to study a correspondence course on de
velopment and spiritual teachings, such as the one
that Clifford L. Bias has written.
"Read all the good books on the subject that you
can, applying to your daily life those things which
do you the most good. All the books you read
won't do you a bit of good unless you apply these
things to your daily life," says Mrs. Currie.
She recalls to the student's attention that "like
attracts like." She says that you could not expect
to attract a spirit guide who has a cultured mind
and marvelous personality if you did not fit yourself
to become that kind of a person. You could not
expect this any more than you could expect a fa
mous pianist to visit your city and play a concert
on a cheap upright piano. "He would play on an
expensive baby grand," she states.
Mrs. Curry says that applied psychology to her
is simply applied common sense, and she urges the
student to use it at all times. "Don't get discour
aged. Don't pay any attention to what your friends
will say about you. Don't think that perhaps your
fellow class member is further advanced than you
are. And don't think that anyone is taking any
thing from you that belongs to you, for that cannot

be done. What is your own will come to you, so
keep on trying. But don't just sit because you like
the teacher or class members." Sitting just for
company of a winter evening, or just for the fun of
it, has no place in Mrs. Curry's idea of good spiritual
development.
Most mediums, at one time or another, have been
accused of fraud. I think that perhaps Mrs. Curry
has a unique distinction in this respect. She has
been accused of being an unconscious fraud!
It happened this way. In 1932 she held a sit
ing for a group of doctors, lawyers and scientists in
St. Louis, Missouri. She had never seen any of
these people before, but brought them many evi
dential messages during the sitting. At the close
of the meeting, one of the professors, who thought
he had it all figured out, calmly announced, "Mrs.
Curry is an unconscious fraud. Her sub-conscious
mind reaches into our sub-conscious minds, gets the
names of our people who are dead, and dates in
connection with them, then she tells them to us."
Unfortunately for the professor, he hadn't
reckoned with the lady in whose home they were
meeting. She was a friend to those who had as
sembled, and had herself sat with Mrs. Curry for
readings for several years. She had kept elaborate
notes on these readings, putting down all the im
portant things which Mrs. Curry had told her.
She produced the notebook and proceeded to read
many of the items to the group. Then she told
them the following interesting story.

During a reading several years before this time,
Mrs. Curry had told her the names of two men,
one living in Canada and the other in New York.
The lady never had heard of the gentlemen, but
Mrs. Curry relayed a message to her from her father
in spirit that they would be of great help to her
husband in a financial crisis which he would be go
ing through. None of this could possibly have been
in the woman's sub-conscious mind.
When the prophesied financial crisis did come,
she was looking through the notes of her readings
and came across the names which Mrs. Curry had
given her. Her husband had never heard of them
either, but resolved to find them if he possibly
could. After a little inquiry the men were found
and were instrumental in helping the lady's hus
band recover in a financial way, just as her father
had told her they would.
When she brought these facts to the attention
of the group, most of them accepted it as something
out of the ordinary. Some of them even went far
enough to say that such an occurrence could origin
ate only from some unseen and superior intelli
gence. But one of the very learned men present
said it was just a "shot in the dark" and would
happen only once in a lifetime!
This is how mediums' souls are sorely tried.
After giving the finest of tests, to have someone
make ridiculous explanations such as these is mad
dening to say the least. But, thus runs the path
of mediumship.

Mrs. Curry's father passed to spirit when she
was eight years old, and her mother joined him
when Mrs. Curry was eleven. She was reared by
her paternal grandparents who were very strict
church people—in fact her grandfather was a
church elder. So when she was twelve, Nellie was
baptized in the Christian church and received her
early religious training there.
While Nellie was staying with these grand
parents, she roomed with a young aunt. The aunt
passed to "spirit when she was only twelve years
old. After she had gone, Nellie used to dream of
her quite often, and in these dreams the two girls
held many conversations. When Nellie would tell
grandmother about these dream visits, she would
receive a peck on the head from grandma's thimble
for saying she talked to people whom she knew to
be dead.
The dreams continued, however, and then she
began seeing others besides her aunt. The only
result of this was more pecks with the thimble.
Then the spirit aunt began telling Nellie when some
member of the family or a friend was going to join
her in heaven. Grandmother began to notice that
the dates were correct, and she would say to the
rest of the family,"Nellie's dreams are sure queer."
Before Mrs. Curry became interested in Spiritual
ism in 1915, her mother-in-law, Sara Curry, often
told her about going to seances. However, to Nellie
at that time, people who were dead were ghosts,
and that was all there was to it. She didn't entire
ly change her mind about this until the day she

saw her mother-in-law in the chair beside her
baby's bed.
She was twenty-seven years old when she had
her own class of students and gave private sittings,
and she was twenty-nine when she did her first
public work. This was in East St. Louis, where
she and a friend founded the First Spiritual Sci
ence Church. She has been serving the public as
a medium for twenty-nine years.
She well remembers the first time she was asked
to give messages at a national Spiritualist conven
tion. It was in Chicago, and there was a huge
audience present. She was thrilled, of course, at
the honor which had been extended to her, but she
was frightened too. She says she always will re
member how her knees shook. When she had fin
ished her part of the service, Mrs. M. E. Cadwalder
told her that she worked like an old trouper with
the poise of one who always had been before the
public. These few words of praise from one of
the leading Spiritualist lights of the day gave Mrs.
Curry renewed courage and confidence.
She says, "I can honestly tell the students that
it's all worth working and waiting for. When you
do especially well, there are times when you would
not exchange places with the First Lady of the land
—then there are other times when you don't do
so well—then you feel very small, and all you can
do is keep on praying that you will do better next
time."
Mrs. Curry says that her greatest thrill in me-
diumship was when she was invited to take her

test to work at Camp Chesterfield, twenty-five years
ago. She has been on the program there every
year since that time. She says that looking for
ward each year to seeing her co-workers, and work
ing with them as one big family, are the bright
jewels in memory's jewel box for her. In seeing
old friends and making new ones she adds more
jewels year after year.
Back in the days of vaudeville, the manager of
a well known booking agency offered Mrs. Curry
a large salary if she would demonstrate her me-
diumship on the stages of the theatres his agency
served. But she preferred keeping her work in
the realm of religion where it properly belongs.
However, she is often found in the theatre today
because she would rather see a movie than do any
thing else. In fact, you might say that attending
movies is her hobby. She never misses a "double
feature," and often sees the same shows more than
once. She just goes without even finding out
whether she has seen the show before or not. But
she often says that the experiences of the people
.who come to her for readings would make far
better movies than the make-believe ones that are
screened.
She says, "I could go on for hours, telling of my
experiences. Through the years I have met so
many different kinds of people—the old and the
young, the rich and the poor, and all the in be-
tweens. People in every walk of life are in search
of happiness they cannot find on earth. They want
to know where we go from here. So, my fellow

where you can."
And then Mrs. Curry has a final word of advice
that is good not only for those who are attempting
to develop mediumship but for everyone else as
well. "It won't cost you anything to smile, so
keep on smiling."

M. McBride Panton
Most mediums' doubts, says M. McBride Panton,
center around themselves. At least he found it so
in his own mediumistic development. He had de
veloped to the point where he was giving messages
from the platform, yet he says that doubts "loomed
painfully large and more and more insistent" as
he went on with his work.
He knew that he was receiving messages which
he passed on to others. He knew that he saw
visions and forms, yet back of it all there were
questions which he could not answer and doubts
which he could not overcome. People recognized
his messages, but he had a horrible fear that per
haps he was picking information from their minds
and giving it back to them. Because he knew
that much of it was a mental process, he wondered
where it all came from.

Then one evening the minister of a small, coun
try Spiritualist church became ill and could not
conduct the service. Mr. Panton and some other
developing students decided they would try to
receive messages for the small congregation of
strangers who had wandered in to the mid-week
service. Finally it came Mr. Panton's turn to see
what he could receive.
During the course of his message service he sud
denly saw what he describes as one of the clearest
clairvoyant visions he has ever seen. Directly be
fore him was the vision of a man riding on a hay-
rake. The man fell from his seat, and Mr'. Panton
felt that he had been severely injured, or had passed
to spirit, as a result of this fall. He told the con
gregation of this vision, hoping that someone would
recognize it,
All were silent. Not a soul answered.
If you ever have given messages, you will know
what a sinking sensation strikes you when there is
no answer to a message which you have received.
Then he heard the voice of the man he had seen
in the vision. He spoke in agonized tones, ap
parently in a terrible mental state. "Harry—
Harry," he called.
Mr. Panton said, "This man says his name is
Harry." Then he waited for a member of the con
gregation to answer.
No one spoke.
Then the man of the vision, will still greater
urgency and agony in his voice, called "Mary—
Mary."

"This man wants to come to someone named
Mary," said Mr. Panton. "Is there anyone here
whose name is Mary?"
There was no answer from the silent
congregation.
At this point Mr. Panton's doubts and questions
flooded in on him again. What was wrong? The
vision was so clear he was sure there was no
mistake. Then what had happened?
Finally—a member of the congregation said, "My
mother's name is Mary. I'll ask her if she knows
anything about it."
It developed that the man's mother lived miles
away, so Panton did not think that she had any
connection with the vision at all.
But on the next Sunday night, this same man
came to Panton and said, "You remember the mes
sage you received last Wednesday night? Well, I
asked my mother about it. She said it was her
uncle Harry who was killed when he fell off a
hayrake!"
Mr. Panton is sure that the giving of this message
was brought about by his spirit teachers in order
to show him, in an undeniable manner, that his
messages were not received through telepathy. No
one in the church even knew of Harry's existence,
either consciously or unconsciously. Only Harry
knew of the connection between his niece, Mary,
who was miles away, and her son who was present
and received the message.
So it was in this actual practice of his medium

ship that Mr. Panton was brought to know that the
mental phases of psychic phenomena were not sim
ply telepathic incidents. He continued in the de
velopment of other phases and is now well known
for his trance and direct voice work as well as
clairvoyance. Since the first public demonstration
in that little New Jersey church he has travelled
the country over, bringing the truth of Spiritualism
to psychic investigators everywhere. He is a mem
ber of the International General Assembly of Spir
itualists. He has served at Lily Dale and for sev
eral years he has been a member of the staff at
Camp Silver Belle in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. Ever
since the day of that first message, he has been
thankful to God that he was "privileged to be an
instrument for the demonstration of truth."
In unfolding his psychic abilities, Mr. Panton sat
in development classes with Frances Stevenson, and
later with Bessie Woodworth. He feels much
indebted to them and their spirit teachers for the
fine unfoldment that came to him. Before sitting
in these classes he had no psychic manifestations
except frequent impulses created by a strong in
tuitive sense. He knew that this intuition was al
ways right. But, like many mortals, he sometimes
acted contrarily to it—and then was sorry that he
did so.
Mr. Panton says that it is difficult to set down
any hard and fast rules for the development of
mediumship. In the several development classes
which he conducts, he has found that no two

classes, and no two students, are exactly alike, and
that different methods must be used in each case.
He says that, in general, the student should sit
relaxed and calm, with an expectant mental atti
tude toward unfoldment.
He says, "Mediumship, as I see it, stands midway
between worldly attachment and spiritual non-
attachment. It is the sign post pointing the way to
spirituality; it is not the way itself. It points the
way. Mediumship, then, needs the development
class. It needs the experienced teacher to bring
it out safely.
"I would advise all students to join a well pro
tected development class. Experience has taught
roe that development under any other condition is
a dangerous undertaking. Control is really the
keynote of proper development. Any fool can kick
a hole in a wall, but once he has done so, anything
can come in. Proper development is not simply kick
ing a hole in the wall between the two worlds, but
rather the erection of a door between, so that only
those one wants can enter.
"Development, when properly undertaken, is con
trol. And that control must be fostered within the
confines of a controlled and protected development
circle, under the leadership of an experienced and
competent medium and teacher."
The Bible says that "the spirits of the prophets
are subject to the prophets," and Mr. Panton feels
that such control should be exerted by the medium
so that only those things which are helpful and

Liplifting may be brought through. In the begin-
ings of mediumistic development, the student is
less able to realize and understand just what turn
his development is taking. He is anxious for any
demonstration of spirit. He has not built up with
in himself the ability to control any of the powers
which may be manifested through him, and con
sequently they may at times get out of hand—with
results as dangerous as uncontrolled electricity.
However, with proper guidance the student is able
to recognize this danger and to protect himself and
others against it.
Mr. Panton says, "I strongly advise against ouija
boards and similar aids to self-development. Self-
development leads, in all but exceptional cases, di
rectly to disaster, and abysmal disaster at that."
Keeping your own thought centered upon spir
itual things is one method of exerting control over
the spiritual demonstrations which may come to
you. Any person who enters the seance room in an
attitude which is anything but spiritual is inviting
lightning to strike him. Although it may be a mental
lightning, it is just as potent and destructive as the
kind we see in the sky. Pray to God that any
forces which manifest through you will be used for
the spiritual elevation of mankind. Adopt, for your
development sittings and at all other times in your
life "an attitude of prayerful, patient expectancy."
The attitude of expectancy is as important as
that of prayer. As the Christ performed a miracle
he expected it to happen. It is a positive attitucje

that gives additional physical force to physical dem
onstrations which have their beginnings at a spir
itual source. Expectancy is a side branch of faith
and at the same time is a part of faith. Job, the
Biblical medium, said, "The thing I greatly feared
is come upon me." Through putting into practice
the law of expectancy he brought upon himself the
very thing he was looking for. The student of
mediumship, in thinking of psychic development,
would do well to put this law into effect in a
positive way. It will help him to receive, not the
thing which he fears, but the thing which he desires.
Originally, Mr. Panton was an agnostic. He did
not believe in anything. He says, "Like so many
others, I had been fooled by the scientists of the last
century into believing that their science was the
final word—that the atom was solid and indivisible,
that the universe was a gigantic machine and that
there was in it no room for God or spirits. I was
a little machine in the big machine. It was nice
and cosy and surprisingly comforting to believe."
He was a copywriter for a cosmetic concern in
southern France, and upon his return to the United
States he and Mrs. Panton settled in Middletown,
New Jersey. Cne evening a neighbor announced
that she was going to a Spiritualist meeting in a
nearby town, so he thought it would be good fun to
go along and scoff at the proceedings. But he
didn't scoff. It was obvious to him that the me
dium was "getting information from some source
that was not a part and parcel of my beautiful

mechanistic universe."
Suddenly the whole thing became important to
him, because it shot all his preconceived ideas into
the scrap heap. He thought it might be done by
telepathy, but even the existence of telepathy was
contrary to his own universe which now was beam
ing to totter on its foundation of sand. He began
to read everything he could find on the subject,
joined the Society for Psychic Research, and most
important of all—became a member of a develop
ing class. He felt that he had to prove it to him
self through developing his own mediumship.
Step by step through this process, Spiritualism
became to him a clear path leading to spirituality.
Spiritualism proved itself to him as being exact
truth, and he says, "It thus became the most impor
tant thing in the world." From this time on he de
termined to leave the materialistic world of com
merce and devote his time and energy to the cause
of truth. He went to the fountain of truth to scoff,
but came away a purveyor of its refreshing waters.
Mr. Panton devotes himself exclusively to his
spiritual work simply because of the fact that he
does believe Spiritualism to be the most important
thing in the world. However, he does take a little
time off now and then to meet with ministers of
other faiths to discuss problems common to all
religions. He is a member of the Stamford (Conn
ecticut) Ministers' League. He is pastor of the
Albertson Memorial Church of Spiritualism in
Stamford.

Mr. Panton believes that the message of Spirit
ualism is to transform us, to help us take on and
become eternally identified with our true spiritual
natures. Realizing that the spirit world does exist,
he says that then we must know there are at least
two worlds, those of earth and of spirit. "And
they are both phenomenal worlds," he continues.
"They are neither, in other words, real. Because
their essence is action, change, and the real is un
changing, non-phenomenal and eternal. The real
is out of any time-space concept.
"The spirit world is, then, an extension of life
in this world, but in other dimensions. The spirit
world is not, and cannot be, then, the end or final
resting place. It is an in-between place, an exten
sion only. There is that which is beyond the spirit
world or worlds. There is that which is non-
phenomenal, eternal, real. God is. And God is
immortal, eternal and infinite. Because God is in
finite, then God is in every living creature, in me.
God is, then, my real nature, and the phenomenal —
all of it—is unreal, changing; in short, maya or
illusion.
"Since my real nature is God, then that which
identifies me with this maya is unreal and must in
time be banished. I believe that this is the aim of
all human life—of all life. Identity with the divine.
"Sin consists of identifying ourselves with the
phenomenal. Desire, greed, pride, possession and
so forth are the means by which we so identify our
selves. Salvation consists of becoming completely

XIV
Geraldine V. Pelton
HEN a young girl, Geraldine Pelton often saw
and heard spirit people. She would see them pass
ing through the rooms of her home, or bending
over a vase of flowers, or just sitting in a chair.
In fact they were doing the same things that people
of earth did. Often they would smile at her,
nod their heads in greeting, or even say a few
words.
Seeing and hearing these people were such com
mon place occurrences that Geraldine never stopped
to think that something a little unusual was taking
place. She really thought that everyone saw and
heard them—till one day she mentioned it to the
housekeeper. The housekeeper was absolutely
horrified.
"Geraldine! You're seeing ghosts—the spirits of
the dead! Other people don't see them, and it
would be better if you didn't either."

But Geraldine kept right on seeing them and
hearing them. And she has developed into one
of the leading psychics of our day. She is a trum
pet, materialization, trance and independent voice
medium, and has a rare phase of spirit painting by
which pictures of loved ones in the world of spirit
are obtained.
When the housekeeper learned of Geraldine's
ability and told her she was seeing the spirits ot
the dead, she began to worry about it all. Perhaps
it was the wrong thing to do, but she hardly knew
how to keep from it. She went to her parents and,
being of Catholic faith as was Geraldine herself,
they worried about it too.
And then one night, when Geraldine was sixteen
years old, a strange thing happened. She was in
her room, alone, saying her nightly prayers as she
had been taught to do. Closing her eyes, she be
gan to say the Lord's prayer and was just coming
to the words "Lead us not into temptation." At
this point a brilliant light suddenly appeared before
her. She thought someone had turned on the
electric light in her room, and opened her eyes to
see who had done it. Before her stood the mater
ialized figure of a wondrous man!
He was tall and dark skinned and was dressed
in a white robe. Over the robe he wore a long
purple cape, lined with gold. Geraldine was too
amazed and frightened to say anything. She tried
to speak but could not force a single word. The tall
visitor looked to her like a man from out of the
past, somehow come to the present, standing before

her in a blaze of light. He seemed to sense her
fright. The touch of a smile that was more of
understanding than amusement came to his lips.
He bowed slightly, and then began to speak—r
"My child," he said in a deep resonant voice, "a
line of the prayer you are saying has long been
misinterpreted. The Lord will not lead you into
temptation. Instead, henceforth, pray 'Let us not
be tempted'."
Then he quoted the entire prayer, inserting his
interpretation of this particular phrase and again
calling Geraldine's attention to the correction.
He then went on, "I am Pondoroza, your Guard
ian Angel. I have been with you since your birth,
and shall forever remain with you. Amen."
The bright light that had surrounded this celes
tial visitor suddenly became like a great white
flame that leaped to the ceiling—and then he was
gone!
To say that this experience unnerved her would
be putting it mildly. Geraldine herself says, "I
was frightened stiff." She told her mother of the
vision, and her mother decided that Geraldine
needed the services of a doctor. They called the
doctor immediately, and what do you think he
recommended? That Geraldine be taken to a
medium!
The next day, Geraldine and her mother searched
the papers for the name of a medium. They were
looking for someone who could help her get rid of
the ability that other people search for—that of
being able to see spirit people. She was so fright

ened that her family was sure she wold have a
nervous breakdown. They finally found the name
of Maud Fullerton, who also lived in Fort Wayne,
Indiana, Geraldine's home city. That very evening.
Geraldine was sitting in Mrs. Fullerton's class.
The rest of the students were there to develop me-
diumship, and Geraldine was there to "undevelop"
it! Fortunately, she didn't succeed.
One of the very interesting and very rare phases
which Mrs. Pelton possesses is that of spirit
painting. As this is a rather uncommon phase of
mediumship, a word or two describing this phenom
enon is in order here. In brief, pastels of spirit
loved ones are received on canvas or art paper. As
evidence that these are spirit made, close exami
nation of the picture does not reveal the telltale
strokes of the earthly hand.
The picture is produced either by a precipitation
of pastel from the chalk to the canvas; or the
chalk itself is handled by Mrs. Pelton's artist guide.
This guide is Edouard Manet, a French artist of
note who lived in Paris, and who passed to spirit
in 1883. He was the originator of the impression
istic movement hvart circles.
There are times when a combination of both
precipitation and direct contact with the chalk is
used. Through an energizing of spiritual power
and desire within Mrs). Pelton, M. Manet is able to
levitate the chalk and make the picture as any
artist would, or he can draw color essence from the
chalk and precipitate it to the canvas. In many
cases he will do both during the sitting, thus pro

during a picture of unusual effect and beauty.
Mrs. Pelton accepts very few students for the
development of this type of mediumship. In the
first place, there are few people who have the par
ticular type of spiritual power necessary for the
manifestation. Also the development of this phase
is an extremely slow process—so slow that many
students become discouraged and give up. In her
own classes M. Manet, the artist guide, works with
the guides of the students, helping these guides to
understand and use the spiritual laws by which
precipitation is produced.
In developing this phase of mediumship, Mrs.
Pelton says that the first requisite is the attraction
of an artist guide. He, or she, need not necessarily
be a person who was a great artist when living on
earth. He will be attracted to you through your
own love and appreciation of things artistic. Aside
from your own personality attraction, the finer your
artistic appreciation the finer artist guide will come
to you. After the guide has made himself known
to you, you may begin sitting.
From your art or stationery store, obtain two or
three sheets of art paper. This should be cut into
smaller sizes for your practice sittings. Buy a
small set of pastels. The entire set should not cost
more than one dollar. (Colored art pencils are
sometimes used instead of pastels.)
When sitting, place the pastels alongside the art
papers on a table or easel in front of you. Then
open your development period the same as you
would for any other phase of mediumship with a

prayer and a hymn. The room, of course, should
be darkened. For the first few moments, direct
your attention to the pastels, sending spiritual
energy from your own inner being to the pieces of
chalk. This creates a spiritually energized aura
around the chalk, allowing the artist guide to ex
tract color essence from the pastel and transfer it
to the paper by means of precipitation. It may be
possible that a chemist guide will perform the ex
traction of color essence and then place it at the
disposal of the artist.
After you have concentrated upon the pastels for
a few moments, direct your attention next to the
art paper. There a similar aura of spiritual energy
will make it possible for the artist to work with the
picture itself. Alternate your attention between
the pastels and the papers, creating spiritual energy
around both objects.
At first you may not receive any results at all.
The guides must acquaint themselves with the spir
it power which can be produced through your inner
being, for it is different with each person. Then,
they must work and experiment with different ways
of using this power in order to obtain the best
results. The first results that you do obtain prob
ably will appear to be only smudges of the chalk in
but one color. It may very well be, however, that
close examination of these smudges will reveal,
very faintly, a face or even several tiny faces. At
least this was true in Mrs. Pelton's development.
Another idea that will help in the development
of this phase is to take into the seance room with

you a picture of a person who is in spirits. Con
centrate for a few moments on this picture, toe.
Ask the guides to compare it to the spirit person
himself before starting actual work on your art
paper. Having this picture is a help to the guides.
Probably all of us change somewhat when we go to
the world of spirit. Earthly lights and shadows
have different texture and tones than those of spir
it realms, and of course to be recognized the picture
must have the appearance of the earthly person.
In other words, the picture you recognize must look
as the spirit person did when he was on earth, and
not necessarily as he looks now in the world of
spirit.
Mrs. Pelton says that the student who is develop
ing this phase of mediumship should not sit for any
great length of time. A tremendous amount ol
spiritual energy is used which quickly depletes the
spiritual resources of the student. The student
should not sit more than three times each week, and
for not more than half an hour each time. If re
sults are being obtained, probably the student will
be quite exhausted at the end of each sitting.
Mrs. Pelton first became interested in this phase
of mediumship when she saw spirit pictures which
had been made through the mediumship of the
famous Bang sisters of Chicago. Three decades ago
they were known throughout the Spiritualistic
world for their lifelike pictures which also were
made through a precipitation method. Her admir
ation for these wonderful paintings aroused within
Mrs. Pelton the great desire to have a mediumship

that would be similar to theirs. Through this de
sire, and her own inherent admiration for things
artistic, M. Manet became attracted to her. After
a long period of development she has arrived at
the present stage of her ability in this particular
phase.
This development did not take place as easily as
writing about it. There were many hours of sac
rifice, of giving up the time which would have been
given to the usual pleasures. But is was not
really sacrifice, for Mrs. Pelton was working to
ward the thing she most, desired. That she re
ceived it is proven by the many fine pictures which
have come through her mediumship. One time a
man and his wife went from Canada to Miami,
Florida, Mrs. Pelton's present home, just to see if
they could receive a picture of their daughter.
Upon its completion this picture was so like the
girl that when the mother saw it she fainted.
Mrs. Pelton sat in class steadily for three years
before she did any public work at all. The first
demonstrations of her mediumship before the public
took place in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, when she was
nineteen years old. She has visited many States
with her work, but has finally settled in Miami.
She is the pastor of the Temple of Continuity,
which she founded in that city.
Mrs. Pelton's sister, Marie, tried to persuade hier
to give up the work for fear of evil spirits.. This
was when Mrs. Pelton first began giving trumpet
work and holding classes. Although of the Catholic
faith, the sister always attended. One night she

entered the seance room several minutes before
class time. Mrs. Pelton thought she had gone in to
pray. At the regular time the class members
entered the room, which was not too brightly
lighted. They stood before their chairs and gave
the opening prayer. Then the light was turned
off as every one sat down—in a puddle of Holy
Water. Her sister had obtained a quart of it and
doused everything in the room to welcome the good
spirits.
One woman, a little high strung, screamed and
fell to the floor in a faint. Mrs. Pelton thought the
woman must have seen something which she had
not, became a little frightened and rushed for the
door. This started a general panic and the rest of
the class pushed after her. On the way, nearly
everyone stumbled over the poor woman on the
floor. Several moments later someone plucked up
the courage to go back after her. Mrs. Pelton says,
"Marie had certainly blessed things that night."
In twenty-three years of mediumship Mrs. Pelton
has had many memorable experiences, humorous,
tragic and sublime. One night, ten years ago, a
lady came rushing to her with tears in her eyes
She took a telegram from her purse and read it to
Mrs. Pelton. It said that her sister in Denver,
Colorado, had been told by the doctors that she
would live for only three months due to an internal
growth which was becoming larger every day.
The lady sat in class that night, and Pondoroza
talked to her. He told her that through God's
power he would be able to heal the sister. Then he

asked that the sister have the doctors examine her
again in three weeks.
She was examined as the spirit had requested,
and the doctors found that already the growth had
diminished to the size of a walnut. Three months
passed, and the lady did not die. In fact after ten
years she still lives, a healthy, happy woman.
Mrs. Pelton says that experiences like this one
make worth while the years of hard work in de
veloping mediumship. She has no regrets at losing
some of her old friends because she became a Spir
itualist medium. She has found new ones to take
their places.
For recreation and relaxation, Mrs. Pelton likes
to work in her flower garden. She is quite an
expert with the trowel and pruning shears. She
says that her only other hobby is "trying to be a
good wife to a very good husband."
Mrs. Pelton thinks it is well to look ahead in life
and try to see certain goals in view. However,
she does not believe in overtaxing yourself in at
tempting to reach this goal. This does not mean
that you shouldn't work for it, because the goal
must be earned. She says, "If you are worthy, it
will all come in due time."

XV
William H. Jackson
ILLIAM Jackson has been in mediumship for
a very short time—less than any of the other me
diums in this book. And that is one of the reasons
for including his story here. Sometimes, when a
person has been in a work for many years, he over
looks, or forgets, the viewpoint he had when just
beginning. The incidents which stand out most
in his mind are those of the later years, and his
opinions are influenced by later experiences.
However, one who has more recently come into
mediumship is more apt to see it from "the other
side of the fence." The months of study and
struggle to attain mediumship are fresher in his
mind. The picture of his development is still clear
before his eyes, and he still feels forcefully within
himself the struggles and trials which every student
of psychic development must undergo.

I believe that Mr. Jackson is the ideal person to
present this side of mediumistic unfoldment. He
has risen to national prominence since 1941. He
is a trumpet and independent voice medium, a
billet reader, and clairvoyant.
"No two individuals on this vast earth are exact
ly alike. Even apparently identical twins will
differ someplace. Nor do any two humans develop
mediumship in exactly the same way," says Mr.
Jackson.
In the very beginning of your development, Mr.
Jackson suggests that you do not hold in your mind
any certain phase of mediumship. Any of the
phases may come to you, or perhaps several phases
But it requires much spirit experimentation to dis
cover just which phase will be most suitable for
you, and you only hold back your own progress by
constantly turning your own thought only to that
phase which you particularly desire. He has found
that some people demand a certain phase of
mediumship.
"If I can't have a trumpet, then I don't want
anything," is what some people say. Very probably
these people will not have anything. Often other
phases must come first, and if they do not want
them they never will receive the mediumship they
do desire, which, being a further development of
other unfoldment, cannot come until the first has
been unfolded. Then perhaps these people are not
chemically or emotionally suited for trumpet.
They are simply turning away from a beautiful

mediumship just because their own selfish desires
are not being answered.
"Let us say that you wish to go from Chicago
to St. Louis. A friend gives you the offer of a
ride in his car. He is going to do the same thing
that you want to do, and would like to have your
company. You state that you will not go unless
you can ride in a Chevrolet. Your friend is sorry
but he does not have a Chevrolet. Later you may
discover that he drives a Cadillac! But it is too
late. He has gone to St. Louis and has taken
someone else in your place.
"This friend may be in the same position that
some people's guides find themselves. The guides
have come to perform a certain mission. But in
stead of letting them do it their way, the demand is
made that it be done in yours. It is impossible to
comply with your wishes in the matter due to
already existing circumstances, so some other per
son is given the transportation, and you end up
with none. Someone else might receive the me
diumship you could have had if you had not been
so demanding."
Mr. Jackson says that you can neither demand
nor command anything from spirit. He believes
that the first important step in developing medium-
ship is to try and touch God. To him this is more
important than trying to touch spirits. Getting
in tune with God's laws is the first requisite. Then,
when you have attained enough spiritual discern
ment, your teachers will reveal themselves and

help you to whatever phase of mediumship is pos
sible for you. After you have discovered what
phase you are blessed with, accept it, try to develop
it to its highest form, go ahead and help your
fellowmen with it.
Another thing that Mr. Jackson suggests is to
use common sense and sane thinking in your de
velopment. These are necessary to the highest
type of mediumship. In his words, "Jesus was the
world's greatest medium, and he was never weird
nor did he try to impress others with his super
normal powers. He was not just the meek man
that so many think he was. His personality was
not unassertive and uncritical. He blazed with
wrath against hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and the
unforgiving spirit. He contemptuously sent his
defiance to Herod. So do not confuse amiability
with love in your work. Be dignified, think clear
ly, be yourself."
When sitting for trumpet development, Mr.
Jackson thinks it is well to have a vessel of water
in .the room. There is a certain element in Water
which he feels is helpful in producing all psychic
manifestations. Many of Christ's greatest demon
strations were conducted near bodies of water. A
vase of cut flowers can be used. This not only
adds to the spiritual atmosphere of the room, but
he has found that some element may be drawn from
the flowers which also is conducive to the mani
festation. Just what is drawn from these things
is puzzling to all alike, but apparently something

of a spiritual nature exists in both water and
flowers which guides can use.
After your seance room has been arranged so that
you feel comfortable and at ease in it, and after
you have given the Lord's prayer and have sung
a hymn, sit in meditation upon spiritual thoughts.
In this period of meditation you elevate your men
tal and psychic vibration. In doing this you place
yourself in that vibratory level at which you can
draw psychic power to yourself. An indrawing of
this power takes place so that it is concentrated
within you. Then this power is placed at the
disposal of the guides.
To do this you wait until you feel yourself filled
with this power, then direct your attention toward
the trumpet. By doing this, you project the
power, that has been gathered within you, toward
its point of manifestation—the trumpet.
It is focused on that one particular spot like the
rays of the sun through a concentrating lens. In
fact, it works in a similar manner all the way
through. In a broad sense you are the lens
through which spirit power is concentrated upon a
physical object.
There is much for the sitter to do. He cannot
expect that spirit guides will do it all for him. If
this were true, every person would be a trumpet
medium. You must become adept at drawing in
this power in the first place, and in directing it to
the trumpet so that it can be used there to help in
the production of levitation and voices. Probably

not one in a thousand will receive results on the
first attempt. Very few will be successful to any
great degree even in the first hundred tries. But
somewhere between these two extremes there
should be some manifestation around the trumpet
—perhaps raps, or slight levitation, or the faint
sound of voices, providing of course that you have
the qualities necessary for trumpet mediurnship.
In the meantime, these same sittings will have
other benefits for you. Much inspiration will come
to you as you do your spiritual meditation. You
will find exhilarating new thoughts unfolding with
in your mind. These will be in the form of spir
itual truths which will mean much to you through
out your lifetime. So the time which apparently
is spent in idleness and fruitless waiting actually
is profitable after all. Further, there may be other
phases of mediurnship unfolding for you. Clair
voyance or clairaudience, or both, may develop.
During your meditation period it is very possible
that visions or voices may come to you. However,
these should be incidental, and not the object of the
meditation. The meditation is purely to change
your rate of spiritual vibration, and for that pur
pose alone.
Mr. Jackson says it is well to experiment with
various methods of unfoldment until you have
found the one which best suits your individual
needs. This is not necessarily the one which pro
duces results for you in the least time. Probably
it is the one with which you feel the greatest at

traction—the one with which you feel the most "at
home."
He says, "No one will be able to say exactly what
length of time it will take for you to develop any
phase. This is all within yourself—the sincerity,
the time, the work you actually give it. Never
sit for development with only the thought in mind
of how famous you may become as a medium. Sit
rather with the thought of how many of your suf
fering fellowmen you can uplift and help."
This was one of the obstacles which Mr. Jackson
had to overcome on his own road to development.
At first he looked at mediumship as a means of
glorifying himself. After sitting for some time
without results, his guide, Dr. Best, finally im
pressed upon him that it had to be selfless and for
the good of others. It was not until that time that
he began to receive his greater development.
Although as a child Mr. Jackson sometimes saw
spirit people and heard them speak, as many child
ren do, he did not become interested in Spiritualism
until early in 1941. Even then he was not im
pressed at first. He had, at that time, many dis
turbing factors in his life. He was dissatisfied with
his work and all the things about his life. "Men
tally," he says, "I was in the depths of despair,
There seemed to be no goal in life worth working
toward. Nothing was real or of any real benefit to
myself or those around me." It seemed to him that
he had spent many useless years on earth.
A friend thought that perhaps Spiritualism might
be of some help to him, and took him to visit

several Spiritualist churches. He went along just
because there seemed to be nothing better to do.
Then one evening he met in one of those churches
a friend whom he had known for some time, with
out knowing that he was a Spiritualist. It turned
out that this friend was a medium, so he attended
his classes for a time without getting any satisfac
tory results. Then he met another friend, also a
medium without his knowing it, and transferred
to his developing class. This second friend was
Earl Charles Best, and of this friendship Mr. Jack
son says, "Our common interest in the work was
predestined. I know that now."
Mr. Jackson sat in Best's class every Thursday
night for several months. In addition to this class
work they used to have long talks about Spiritual
ism, mediumship, occultism, metaphysics and kin
dred subjects. One night Mr. Best said that he must
say goodbye for good. Jackson thought that he
was going to enlist in the army, for he had talked
about it on a few occasions. A few days later, a
friend asked Jackson if he had heard about Earl.
"I suppose he is in the army now," said Jackson.
'
No," his friend replied, "he is in the grave."
Mr. Best had had a premonition of his own death,
had put his affairs in order and said goodbye to his
friends. He had become ill on the Friday after he
had seen Mr. Jackson, was taken to the hospital on
Saturday and passed to spirit on Sunday.
For three months, Mr. Jackson could find no
other teacher to take the place of Mr. Best. Then

one Sunday afernoon, after workng in his yard he
went to his room to rest. Suddenly Mr. Best ap
peared to him, almost completely materialized.
Then he spoke, telling Jackson where to sit for
development, where to find books that he had left
behind, and other personal things which were
proven later!
Mr. Jackson found the books and the teacher
sat for his development, and now Dr. Earl Charles
Best is his spirit guide! For all his development,
Jackson feels himself indebted to Dr. Best. He
says, "It all came about through Dr. Best's guid
ance." It is unusual to have a spirit guide who also
was your teacher while on earth.
Mr. Jackson was a Catholic convert when he was
sixteen. Since coming into Spiritualism he has be
come a member of the Spiritualist Episcopal Church
and of the Federation of Spiritualist Churches and
Associations. He is pastor of the Spiritualist Epis
copal Church of Chicago.
He has three hobbies. One is the back yard of
his apartment. There he plants flowers in a dif
ferent arrangement each year. He has several
tanks of tropical fish in his home. He likes them
brilliantly colored and with all sorts of odd shapes.
And lastly, he collects books on Spiritualism and
occultism. He has added extensively to the library
which once belonged to Dr. Best.
There is another point which this newcomer to
Spiritualist prominence feels is important. He
realizes the great value of messages and seances.

but he thinks that in the development of mediums
not enough attention is paid to lecturing. Most
mediums are called upon to lecture or preach in
churches along with their mediumistic work. He
says that, "Good lectures will do more to bring the
facts of our religion to the general public than al
most any other thing. Seances and messages may
puzzle people, but a lecture is worth just what is
in it." I am inclined to agree with Mr. Jackson.
He feels that all seekers of development should
also study speaking. They should listen to good
speakers on the radio or wherever they may be
heard. They should practice to improve and per
fect their own speaking ability, for much of their
work will be judged by the manner in which they
conduct themselves on the platform. It is well and
good to use inspiration, but the finest thought in
the world, inspired from on high, can be ruined
by poor presentation of it. He feels that most
every lecture and sermon should try to show the
value of our religion. This will carry a weight in
others' minds as well as the more sensational
message work.
After all, everyone cannot receive a message at
every service. It is the responsibility of the
speaker to give those who do not receive a message
something which they will remember and treasure,
something that will help them find a better way of
life, or be better people, or open their eyes of spir
itual understanding. This is a great responsibility
to place upon any speaker, and it demands the best

there is in any person attempting it. The lecture
part of the service is half of it—the half that is for
everyone, and it is just as important as the rest.
Whatever talents we have, Mr. Jackson feels that
we should use them in a humble and thankful way
for the benefit of truth. He says, "Thank God for
the blessings He gives us via His emissaries from
the spirit side."

XVI
Maud Fox
It IS strange how events of bygone days affect our
lives today. Actually, Maud Fox became a me
dium because a Spiritualist worker visited the little
town of Dundee, Michigan, over fifty years ago.
Mrs. Fox' grandfather, Abe Johnson, attended
this meeting because he wanted to hear from his
wife who had just passed to the world beyond. The
medium was Marian Carpenter, well known to
thousands of Spiritualists. She was visiting Dun
dee to give a series of lectures and message services.
This was in the early 1890's. Mr. Johnson was
convinced of the truth of Spiritualism at these
meetings.
He went west for several years, and upon his
return about 1911 he induced the Nevison family
to try some home sittings. In this home circle
group were Maud Nevison, her sister Loretta, her
brother Ben, her mother and father, and Mr.
Johnson. Almost immediately every member of
the family could hear raps on the table that was

in the center of the room, then the table moved
without any of their hands touching it.
r
They
worked out a code method of raps through which
they received messages from the world of spirit.
They later found they had contrived the same code
used by the Fox sisters (no relation to Maud),
though they had not heard of it at the time.
Later, someone suggested that they put a pencil
and paper on the table to see if they could receive
written messages. This they did, and received
many messages in this way. At one sitting they
were astounded when the spirit rolled up the paper
and spoke through it as through a trumpet. In
fact the words which this spirit voiced were, "Buy
r, trumpet." They had never heard of a trumpet,
so they began inquiring among friends who also
were interested in the work and found a healer
who took brother Ben to a man who made them.
That night they sat with the trumpet and were
blessed with their first trumpet voices. Later they
learned that no single one of them was the medium
for this manifestation, but that it was the result of
their combined forces. The entire family then used
to visit other homes and sit for friends who were
anxious to hear the voices of their loved ones in
spirit. These manifestations were among the early
physical phenomena demonstrations in the state of
Michigan.
The two sisters and brother in the Nevison family
all developed into well known trumpet mediums.
Ben was the first to develop this phase of medium-
ship, although he has not practiced it of late years.

Maud developed the phase next, and then her sister
Loretta, who is well known to Spiritualists every
where as Loretta Schmitt. Both these famous
ladies have been serving as mediums for many
years—as clairvoyants and trumpet mediums, and
often sitting together to obtain spirit drawings.
Many visitors to Camp Chesterfield have obtained
the wonderful crayon drawings which come through
their mediumship.
Mrs. Fox believes that prayer is the proper start
ing place in your search for mediumship. She
says, "Pray for your mediumship. Ask for it.
There is nothing supernatural about prayer. The
real prayer is that of great soul earnestness to toucn
angelic spirits, receiving their sympathy and love
for your humble needs. Remember, you cannot
have a blossom before there is a root." And Mrs.
Fox feels that root of prayer will give life to the
blossom of mediumship.
Prayer, of itself, is a spiriual attunement. It
raises the level of your thoughts to spiritual planes.
It helps you to come in harmony with the great
spiritual forces which exist all about you. It blots
out the earthly and brings the celestial into view.
It helps you to realize yourself as a spiritual being,
and thus to have a greater use of your spiritual
powers. Prayer is the beginning.
Don't just walk into your seance room and begin
to pray. Wait for a few moments until you feel
a spiritualization of your entire being. With your
mind, try to lift yourself to a level of etheric real
ization. Then, pray—giving wings to your own

spirit as it makes the contact with celestial spheres.
Mrs. Fox says, "Pray that spirit power might flow
through you; that you may be a channel unto God
to do His work on earth."
Mrs. Fox reminds you that the development of
mediumship is often a discouraging effort. But she
says that you must make up your mind to "test
yourself." You may expect to make many sacri
fices for your work if you wish to achieve a medium-
ship of high calibre and worth.
You cannot expect to reach the top in one step
any more than you could in any other calling. She
says, "Climbing is sometimes slow. But let your
soul refuse to be defeated. You are God's child
and He is proud of you. Remember, light is good
in whatever lamp it shines."
Mrs. Fox began her public work in 1916, in
Detroit, Michigan. This was five years after she
began sitting for her own development. She be
lieves that the greatest thrill in her mediumship
came shortly after this time. She was invited to
Flint, Michigan, to serve at a Spiritualist rally.
She was to speak and give messages at the after
noon meeting. The worker at the evening service
was to be E. W. Sprague, famous the world over at
that time for his work in behalf of Spiritualism.
Mr. Sprague attended the afternoon service in
order to hear the young lady from Detroit. Wher
the meeting was over he went to her, shook her
hand and said, "Girl, you are going a long way in
the work."
These few words from one of the greatest Spir

itualist luminaries of the day were indeed inspiring
to Mrs. Fox. Later she was to work with Mr.
Sprague many times, but she never forgot his pro
phecy, made thirty years ago in Flint. In this case,
at least, his prophetic ability could not be ques
tioned, for Mrs. Fox most surely has gone a long
way in the work.
One of the things which Mrs. Fox' admirers most
like about her work is the "style" in which she
gives her messages. Every message bearer has a
style or manner of passing on to the congregation
the things which he sees, hears and feels. Know
ing how often people speak of Mrs. Fox in this con
nection, I asked her if she would pass along to stu
dents some ideas that would help them develop
their individual style of giving messages. And of
course she was glad to do this.
"First, always be yourself," she said. "Do not
try to imitate others. Do not affect curious pro
nunciation of words, nor put on 'airs.' Be natural.
My way is my way, and your way is yours. Prob
ably both our ways have their good points and their
faults. And even after being in mediumship for
years we must be alert to correct our faults and to
improve our good points.
"As an illustration of style in giving messages,
let us imagine that a spirit says the name 'John
Smith' to you. If you say only 'John Smith' it is
stiff and formal, and probably not at all natural to
your own style of speech. You might say, 'I hear
a voice speaking the name of John Smith,' which
would be more natural, and more pleasing to your

audience. Furthermore, the few extra words
would give you time to see a vision which John
Smith might show to you, or hear other words
which he might speak. If you spoke only the name
there very likely might be a few seconds of wait
ing until you received something else from him.
This waiting would be an awkward pause in your
flow of speach.
"Another idea in giving messages is to make
attunement with the manifesting spirit in such a
way that you catch mannerisms which are pecu
liar to him. There is more to giving "messages
than letting the congregation hear the sound of
your voice. Remember that the people in front of
you are seeing you as well as hearing you, and that
sometimes a message can be conveyed by sight as
well as sound. You should become so well attuned
to the manifesting spirit that if he holds his hands
in a certain way you will do the same. If he
walks with a certain step, you will take a step in
the same manner. Thus you have added a visual
presentation of your message to the auditory. One
is just as much a part of the message as the other.
In other words, the thing you are trying to do is to
be the spirit himself for the moment. If you prac
tice this, and become adept at it, you will be told
many times that while giving a certain me3sage
you took on all the characteristics of the spirit
person who was giving it to you.
"It is not necessary to remind the people that
John Smith always hooked his thumbs under his
vest whenever he spoke. You simply show them

bring to them the reality of the manifesting spirit.
/ It is not always easy to do and sometimes cannot
be done at all. It requires much practice and a par
ticularly close attunement to the spirit person, so
that his mind practically becomes yours for the
moment."
Yes, it requires practice, long hard hours of it.
But if you have ever seen Mrs. Fox conduct a mes
sage service you will know that hours of practice
is a small price to pay for such an effective method
of giving messages.
Mrs. Fox says that one of the first things to do
in developing mediumship is to find out who you
are and what you are. Realize that you are a
spiritual being, and not just the physical body
which you see in your mirror. As a spirit you will
be dealing with other spirits, whatever your phase
of mediumship may be. Some will be spirits in the
body and some out of the body. But they all will
be spirits, and realizing that they are such will
help you in making your own psychic attunements
v/ith people of both heaven and earth. When this
realization comes to you and becomes firmly a part
of your thought, you are much better prepared
for mediumship. You have added another root
from which a healthy blossom can spring.
The fruits which come from these blossoms are
many and varied, and bring with them many pur
poseful incidents in the lives of mediums. Often
these incidents will have odd twists to them, and
always they serve a purpose. Once Mrs. Fox was

invited to hold a trumpet seance in the home of a
Detroit friend. As she boarded a street car she
thought someone pushed her, but on turning around
could see no one. She entered the car and, as it
was not crowded, quickly found a seat. Suddenly,
in the vacant seat in front of her she saw a spirit—
a small, round-faced man with a little beard. He
looked at Mrs. Fox and winked at her, and during
the entire trip he kept watching and smiling at her.
Quite perplexed, Mrs. Fox couldn't understand the
reason for all this attention.
Finally she arrived at the home where she was
to hold the circle. She was shown into the living
room by the lady who had invited her. Just a
step inside the room, however, she stopped short in
amazement. Hanging on the wall was a picture
of the man who had winked at her on the street car!
The man spoke in the trumpet seance which fol
lowed. It developed that the home in which the
circle was being held belonged to his daughter,
Mrs. Fox' friend. He spoke to Mrs. Fox as well
as members of his family who were present, and
explained the reason he had winked at her on the
car. He had been blind for the last ten years of
his life on earth. Feeling sure that Mrs. Fox would
tell of the incident, he believed it would be the
clearest way possible in which he could show his
people that he now could see.
Mrs. Fox came from a Methodist family. But
she found help and inspiration in Spiritualism and
for thirty years has been helping others find the
same. She is a member of the National Spiritual

she serves every summer. For the last few years
she has been dividing her time, even in winter,

From talking to thousands of people in her

XVII
Richard Zenor
The first scene in this story about Richard Zenor,
well known Los Angeles medium, is a "flashback"
to the time when he was seven years old.
"
He is in
the second grade at school. The teacher, quite ap
prehensively, looks at young Richard and wonders
if there is about to be a recurrence of an incident
which happened a few days before.
Yes—evidently there is, for she recognizes the
first signs. Richard has lost all interest in his
schoolmates and his surroundings, and seems to be
drifting off to sleep, even though he remains erect
at his desk. In a moment he begins to speak, al
though the voice does not seem to be his own. It
is much more adult, and the things which he says
are too mature for a youngster of only seven years.
What the teacher doesn't understand is that act
ually the voice isn't his own, for Richard is in
trance!

He was entranced several times during his early
school days, but then he found that demonstrating
mediumship wasn't just the thing to do in the pub
lic schools, and had to learn to control the mani
festation. This seemed a tragic thing to Richard
at the time. But the teachers didn't exactly ap
prove of such things as trance mediumship being
demonstrated during classes so he had to stop it.
As he says, with what is probably a masterful
understatement, "The teachers were getting the
idea that I was different from other children."
The first mediumship for which Mr. Zenor be
came well known was his trumpet work. He also
is a clairvoyant and has had the phases of materiali
zation and spirit photography. However, all of his
work now is through trance mediumship. With
this phase he gives private counsel to many people
and also conducts his church work at the Agasha
Temple of Wisdom, which he founded, in Los
Angeles. He has travelled extensively in the
United States, particularly the western part, and
Canada, giving demonstrations of his mediumship.
Just before a trumpet seance one evening several
years ago, a man and his wife came to Mr. Zenor
and asked for a private sitting. He explained to
them that it was time for the seance to begin and
a private sitting was out of the question at that
moment. However he invited the pair to the
seance, and they accepted his invitation.
During the seance a voice came through the
trumpet and spoke to the stranger by name. The
spirit said that he was the man's father, gave his

own name, then went on to say, "I want you to
know that I have been murdered and my body can
be found at the foot of a ravine—." Then the man
proceeded to give directions as to just where his
body could be found and even gave its position in
the ravine.
After the seance, the stranger told Mr. Zenor that
his father had been missing for three days, and
that he came that night to find a trace of him if
possible. The next day the location which the spir
it had described, and which was nineteen miles
from Walsenberg, Colorado, was visited. The body
of the man's father was found, just as he had de
scribed it in the circle!
To be a twenty-three year veteran as a medium
at the age of thirty-four probably is something of
a record. Mr. Zenor gave his first public demon
strations when he was just eleven years old. In
Pueblo, Colorado, he first practiced his medium-
ship publicly, giving messages in trance and doing
some trumpet work. In his first appearances be
fore the public he was timid and nervous more
than frightened. But he had already been associ
ated with Spiritualism for several years and ac
cepted it all as a matter of course.
Mr. Zenor feels that there are certain obstacles
in the path of the aspiring medium which must be
overcome. Some of these may be worked out by
the guides and teachers, but others must be met by
the student himself. First is in the matter of emo
tions. There are students who completely destroy
the spiritual value of psychic force through coloring

it, or inhibiting it altogether, with their own un
bridled emotions. The student must remember
that he is the intrument by which spiritual elements
are brought into material manifestation. The
emotionally uninhibited make poor instruments at
best. It is just like a saw with a bent tooth—it
makes a jagged cut, or will not cut at all, even
though it is the instrument of the most accomplished
of carpenters. Jealousy, envy, animosity, and other
similar emotions, are like bent teeth on an other
wise good saw.
The mind-wanderer, too, has an obstacle to over
come. Especially in trumpet work, vibrational
emanations from the medium are used in producing
both levitation and voices. If the mind is not con
trolled, but goes wandering off to some other sub
ject than the business at hand, it breaks the vi
bratory connection and no manifestation is possible.
The entire attunement which you have made is
disconnected. Neither levitation nor voices can be
produced and your attempt at development is
doomed to failure.
Mental self-control is not an easy process. The
body itself, with all its desires and passions, exerts
a strong pull at the mind's attention. Other ex
ternal influences leap at the mind as though to
throttle it against the task at which you have set
it. And this is something that these influences
actually accomplish unless you are able to assert
enough self-control to overcome them. The Holy
Bible puts it this way: "If thy right eye offend thee,
pluck it out, and cast it from thee." The Biblical

parable goes on to say that it is better that one
member of the body perish than that the whole
body be lost. So it is with mental and emotional
control. Of course this control is actually what
the Christ was talking about when he made this
statement.
It is much better to cast these undesirable, spir
ituality inhibiting thoughts away than it is to lose
a high type of mediumship. So put from you all
emotions and feelings and thoughts of a spiritually
undesirable nature, harmful to your highest de
velopment. These obstacles are ones which you
can practice doing away with every day. It is not
something which should be reserved for the seance
room alone. Make it a constant byword in your
everyday life.
Another obstacle which Mr. Zenor believes is a
hindrance to the student is in negative thinking as
compared to the positive type. A positive spirit
ual energy is required to produce spiritual manifes
tations. The person whose thinking is always neg
ative counteracts any positive force which may be
Rowing through him. The person who says he
"cannot," usually is the person who really cannot
do anything. He has created a negative mental
force which, being closer to the point of physical
manifestation, has the greater power. He has en
slaved his positive psychic power, confined it as a
prisoner behind a solid wall of negative thought
from which there is rarely any means of escape.
Mr. Zenor feels, too, that a critical attitude to
ward the progress of your development, or your

guides, is not conducive to further development.
This is really another type of negative thought
which colors or counteracts any spiritual vibrations
that might be produced through you.
The earliest memories which Mr. Zenor has were
about Spiritualism and the manifestations of psy
chic power. These date back to the latter part of
his third year of life on earth. His mother was
a medium, and she readily understood the medium-
istic tendencies which he displayed even at such
an early age. Having an understanding of the laws
which affect mediumship, she schooled him in prac
ticing them and helped him overcome many of the
obstacles which the student meets in his early
unfoldment.
He began sitting for trumpet manifestations when
he was only nine years old, and in that same year
was able to receive levitation and hear voices. He
used to sit with his mother in all his unfoldment
and meditation periods, and she was the only earth
teacher he ever had. Mr. Zenor thinks it wise,
when you have associated yourself with an earthly
teacher, that you stay with that teacher and not
attend first one class and then another. Your spir
it teachers become accustomed to working through
the vibration of one medium and therefore can be of
greater help to you than they could if forced to
change frequently.
Mr. Zenor devotes practically his entire time to
Spiritualistic work. He likes to travel, however,
and once in a while will take time for a travel
vacation. He takes his motion picture camera with

him and films the scenes of interest which he visits.
Eis collection of these travelogues has become quite
sizeable, and whenever he has not the time for a
trip he likes to screen them and, via the movies, re
visit the places he has seen.
In his earlier development, Mr. Zenor often saw
visions and heard voices which he duly reported
to his mother for her explanations and comments.
In this way he was helped greatly with his unfold-
ment. When he was still just a youngster, he saw
before him one day the vision of a coal mine.
He recognized it as a mine in which his father was
interested. He saw his father go near the mine,
and then there was a violent explosion. This vision
was told to his mother. The next day he saw the
same vision all over again, and the same occurrence
was repeated for several days.
Then one day the vision was extremely clear
cut, as though he could reach out and touch it.
It seemed so close and real that Richard, very
frightened, ran to his mother with the story. He
emphasized it to her so strongly that she prevailed
upon his father not to enter the mine that day.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, Richard was
playing in the yard of his home at Angilar.
Colorado. He heard a terrific noise, and knew im
mediately that it was the explosion he had seen
in his vision. Although many men were killed in
this disaster, his father had heeded the advice given
by the world of spirit and had not entered the mine,
thereby saving his life.
Mr. Zenor has been a Spiritualist all his life.

Both spiritual instruction and that for psychic un-
foldment have come to him entirely from the world
of spirit. He is convinced of the fact that the re
ligion of spirit is the one which all the masters
of eternal spiritual wisdom have taught their peo
ple. He is confident, too, that the religion would
spread much faster and be of more help to mankind
if every person who is developing mediumship
would devote his heart and soul to the unfoldment
of all the divine qualities which he possesses.
Every student should keep alive in his mind the
great promise of the Christ, who said of the man
who would believe in him, "The works that I do
shall he do also; and greater works than these
shall he do.

Robert G. Chaney
T
J. HIS is writing one's autobiography rather early
in life. I never thought I would be doing such a
thing. In fact, I never thought I ever would be
writing an autobiography at all. However for the
purposes of this book, and to make this chapter
fit in with the others, perhaps a sketchy account
of some of the incidents in my life will be necessary.
"In the beginning" I had double pneumonia. At
critical points in this illness my grandfather Francis
would come to my cradle, talk to me for a while,
and the crisis would pass. Evidently some healing
power flowed through him to help me. Probably
this was the first psychic experience in my life,
and I know of no other until I began to investigate
Spiritualism when I was about twenty-one years
old.
But long before this, my great grandmother
Holcomb used to have visions. She would see cur
rent events as they actually happened miles and
miles away. When my mother took a trip to
Europe, great grandmother Holcomb kept in close
touch with her by this method. She would see
what my mother was doing, and her vision would

be verified several days later by my mother's letters.
The family, evidently, was not impressed by grand
mother's visions. Perhaps this is accounted for by
the fact that they were all good Methodists.
My mother and father became interested in Spir
itualism before I did. I could see that it had helped
them in many ways, and though I did not believe
that communication with the dead was possible I
kept my own counsel on this account. The next
thing I knew I was a Spiritualist too. Nellie Curry,
Mable Riffle, Mamie Schulz, John Bunker and a
professor from the University of Michigan all had
a hand in convincing me. I would like to tell the
story about it all, but there is not room here.
A friend who did not believe in Spiritualism also
helped to convince me. We visited Camp Chester
field one summer, and had a reading given us by
John Bunker. In this reading he told me that I
could be a medium and explained how to sit for
development. On the way home ( Cincinnati, Ohio,
at that time) my friend said, "Chaney—you sit
like that fellow told you to do. If you get any
thing, tell me and I'll believe you."
I agreed, and began sitting as instructed. Six
weeks later I heard a voice whisper, "Grandmother
Holcomb." It was the same great grandmother
who had seen the visions, and who by this time
had been in spirit for many years. Thrilled, I
rushed to my friend and told him the wonderful
news. He did not believe me, and does not to this
day. Oh well—
It was a long, long time before I ever heard an

other spirit voice. I sat alone in my room at a
Cincinnati men's club every night, and once a week
in class with some wonderful people in Covington,
Kentucky. Later I moved to Eaton Rapids, Mich
igan, and sat in class under the guidance of Mr.
Bunker. Whatever mediumship I have, I owe to
all these friends and to the spirit people who came
to help me. And to them all I will be everlastingly
thankful.
My work in mediumship includes spirit photo
graphy, trumpet in the red light, billet reading and
healing. I enjoy work in the Masonic Lodge and
the Kiwanis Club. For relaxation I play golf and
see every sports event for which I have time.
So much for me—now let's talk about you.
Especially if you are interested in, or wish to de
velop, the phase of mediumship known as spirit
photography. There are lots and lots of people
who say that it is impossible to obtain a picture! of
a spirit. There are some who know that it can be
done. It is one of the phases of mediumship in
which A. Conan Doyle was most interested. He
collected thousands of spirit pictures and wrote a
book about the phase. There are hundreds of peo
ple who have obtained spirit pictures with their
uwn cameras and film. Their faith in this phenom
enon, naturally, hardly can be shaken.
Before developing this type of mediumship to a
high degree, it is well to understand how it works.
Photographic film is sensitive to light rays which
the human eye cannot see. These rays are intro
duced to the film, either from a point within the

camera or through the lens, and the result is a spir
it picture. To be a spirit photographer you must
be able to furnish the spiritual energy with which
these light rays can be controlled and directed.
Sometimes the light is reflected from the spirit
person himself, and sometimes it is projected and
directed by a spirit artist.
The same method for arousing spiritual energy
in the medium which has been described in the
chapter about John W. Bunker may be used by the
student. In first developing the phase, it is not
necessary to use a camera and film. Sheets of sen
sitive photographic paper of the type used for mak
ing photo enlargements may be used. I have
found that a good paper is Kodabromide E-2, 5x7
size, which may be purchased at any photo supply
store.
Keep this paper in your seance room for several
days before opening the package. During your
daily period of sitting, place your hands over the
package and mentally direct spiritual energy to
flow through your hands to the paper. Ask that
a spirit form, or a design of some type, might be
placed upon it. Then you are ready to develop
the paper. In your earlier development it may be
well to flash a dim white light on each piece be
fore developing. This will cause some of the nat
ural photographic processes to take place, giving
the spirit teachers a "starter" in further manipu
lating the chemicals. Development of the paper
is done in the regular chemicals for this purpose
(obtainable at your photographic store), and in a

room lit only by a red or amber photographic light.
The flashing of the dim white light will cause
dark areas to appear on the paper. It is in these
darkened areas that the spirit faces, or other de
signs, will appear. As your development pro
gresses, you will not find it necessary to flash the
light but will be able to receive the pictures purely
through spirit work and the energy which you
furnish.
I use this type of the phase in my public demon
strations. Persons chosen by lot are asked to se
lect at random any piece of paper from the pack
ages, and hold the sensitive side toward the solar
plexus for a few moments. I touch the back, or
non-sensitive, side of the paper for one or two sec
onds with the palm of my hand. Then the papers
are developed immediately while the entire audi
ence watches.
To obtain spirit pictures in the strict sense of the
word, as you do pictures of earthly beings, you
must use camera and film. Any make of camera
is satisfactory, but one that uses single sheets of
film instead of the roll type is best because it allows
for development of the sheets singly.
Most spirit pictures include the picture of an
earth person. Of course the person on earth is an
attraction for his own people in spirit. However,
there is not the control over who will manifest, and
who will not. that there is in other phases of
mediumship.
If you are attempting to develop this phase of
mediumship, you will need the help of some friends.

They probably will be happy to "sit" for your
experiments. Place them in front of a dark back
ground of any color. Do not use too bright a light
—the light from one 150 watt bulb in a reflector
has been satisfactory in my work. Then take the
picture just as you would at any other time, except
that one hand should be placed against the back ot
the camera, palm toward the film. This is to give
a point of magnetic contact between you, the film
and the spirit operator.
It is well to have the film several days previous
to taking the picture, just as when you are using
paper alone, and for the same purpose. The type
of film does not matter much, except that a high
speed, or very sensitive, variety should be used.
The film is best kept undeveloped for a period of
about three days to allow chemical actions started
at the time of taking the picture to be continued.
The film should be developed in a paper developer,
such as Eastman's D-72, so that good contrast may
be obtained.
There is one item about exposure and develop
ment which should be mentioned. The exposure
should be slightly longer than would ordinarily be
used, and development should be carried to the
point where the best contrast in noted. In mak
ing the positive paper print from your film, it is
well to underexpose and underdevelop slightly so
that even the faintest traces of spirit faces will not
be lost in the process. Remember —overexpose the
film; underexpose and underdevelop the paper
print.

When exposing the film, ask the earth person
whose picture you are taking to visualize some
person who is in spirit. There are several reasons
for this. A spirit person may not remember how
he looked when on earth, and he certainly doesn't
know how any earth person remembers him, for
each of us looks differently to every other person.
The visualization is to help the spirit persons to
know how the earth person remembers them, and
thus to manifest in a more recognizable manner.
This is well illustrated by showing your own pic
ture to two people. One will say that it looks just
like you and the other will say there is no resem
blance. So you can see that the spirit people must
know how you remember them in order to come in
recognizable form. However, the visualization of
any spirit person does not insure that that partic
ular person will be able to manifest.
Good results in spirit photography depend much
upon the earth person whose picture is being taken,
just as good results in other phases also depend
greatly upon the sitter. The medium only fur
nishes spiritual power. The rest depends upon the
sitter and the spirit people.
It requires but a minute or two to take a pic
ture, so do not expect that just snapping pictures
will develop you into a spirit photographer. You
must sit in regular periods for development and
use the breathing and posture exercises just as you
do for developing other phases.
There is a real need for spirit photographers.
There are fewer mediums of this type than of any

too great for the present few photographers to ful

you every encouragement and wish you every
success.
I first became interested in developing spirit
photography when a spirit person, in a trumpet
seance, told me that he would help me with it. He
asked me to take my handkerchief from my poc
ket and hold it, unfolded, over my solar plexus for
a few minutes. I did as directed, and when the
seance was finished there was a picture of a young
man on the handkerchief!
Later I learned that it was the picture of the man
who had talked to me. He did not tell me his
name, and I do not know it to this day. He asked
me to visualize him, just as I ask others to visual
ize their people whenever attempting a demonstra
tion of picture phenomena. He is a chemist who
manipulates chemicals and light rays so that the
pictures can be produced. Any person who is de
veloping this phase probably will attract a spirit
guide who will act in a similar capacity. Al
though I do not know for certain, I have an idea
that he asks me to visualize him in order to keep
my mind from other visualization which might in
fluence any results that are obtained.
Now, I've told you all I know about how to
develop this phase of mediumship. All else that
I can do is to wish you well and ask that the angel
world help you as much as it has helped me.

JuLIUS Caesar would have said, "All mediumship
is divided into three parts."
Have you ever tried to get three people to agree
on one thing? That is what must be done in order
to have a demonstration of psychic phenomena.
Three minds must be in tune; three spirits must
overcome the usual boundaries and limitations of
the earthly world. These three are the sitter, the
spirit person, and the medium.
These three people share, and share alike, the
responsibilities of producing good psychic demon
strations. When one is out of tune, the two others
are absolutely prohibited from fulfilling their de
sires in the matter. Sometimes, the medium is out
of tune; sometimes it is the sitter; and sometimes,
though less frequently, it is the spirit. Each party
must remember that he is only one third of the
whole, yet the success of every demonstration de
pends upon his co-operation.

Each of these three must contribute something,
or no phenomena will take place. When bad re
sults are obtained, it is well for we people of earth
to look at our part, fairly, and see wherein we
have failed. Then, the next time, if we have
learned our lesson, our results will be better.
Mediumship is not an "easy row to hoe." This
book would fall short of its goal if it only men
tioned the high points of the medium's life and
neglected the low. Although sensitive in every re
spect, the medium must be thick-skinned enough to
endure the disbelief of his friends, and perhaps
close members of his own family. He must not be
discouraged by failure in his work. He must place
his own shortcomings on the execution block and do
away with them. He must ignore the childish
and ridiculous remarks about his religion which
appear from time to time in print and on the radio.
And he must overlook the taunts of those mis
guided zealots of his own faith who take great
delight in tearing down the work of others. When
I think of these people, there always comes to my
mind an interesting scene which I once witnessed.
A new building was being erected on a downtown
Cincinnati site. Immediately next to it a building
was being torn down. Even to the most casual ob
server, it was very apparent that the workers with
initiative and brains were employed at construc
tion. Although I will admit that the ones who
were tearing down worked just as hard as the ones
who were building.

Remember, too, that the best medium in the
world cannot convince everyone who comes to him.
A friend once told me that through the medium-
ship of one of the mediums in this book he had
received both the best and the worst results he
ever had found in Spiritualism. So the medium
must be thankful for the friendships he has made
in the work, and thankful, too, that he has not
even more enemies. For this, even the Christ was
thankful.
If you do not remember having been a psychic
when you were a child, it does not necessarily
follow that you never will be one. Some people
are pianists before they are ten years old, while
others have accomplished great things long years
later. It is not the time you start that matters,
it is what you do when you do start. Many of our
greatest mediums were not what might be called
"natural" psychics. Mediums are natural human
beings who have developed a certain ability to a
high degree. Everyone has, or can have, some me-
diumship, just as everyone has some musical
ability.
One or two things in the chapters about the
various mediums need further explanation here as
there was no need to repeat them in each medium's
story. One thing is the purpose of the prayer and
hymn used at the beginning of each development
period and class. There are several reasons for
this. First, each class is actually a religious ser
vice. You are attempting to come in touch with
things divine. Another reason is that all spirit

people are not angels, and as a general rule, those
who are not will not be attracted to any place where
prayers are said and hymns are sung. The third
reason is to furnish additional vibratory force nec
essary to the manifestations. Another reason is to
put every person's mind in a similar attunement,
on spiritual things. And another is to have every
person breathing at the same rate, putting their
physical and psychical energies in common
attunement.
Another subject I would like to mention further
is the length of time required to develop medium-
ship. The various mediums have said that it can
not be estimated before you begin sitting, and that
no two people will require the same amount of time.
On looking over the previous chapters, I am afraid
it may sound a little discouraging. Let me tell you
the story of Blanche ("Mother") Edwards, a well
known trumpet medium for thirty-five or forty
years, who now has passed to spirit. Mrs. Edwards,
whose home was in Xenia, Ohio, gave me much
encouragement when I first began sitting for de
velopment. She told me this story.
Before her mediumship was developed at all, she
used to sit every night at eight o'clock with a
friend. Without missing a single night, this went
on for ten years with no manifestation whatsoever!
Then one night there came a whisper in the trum
pet. A man who had lived in Xenia told the two
ladies of his death, which had taken place in rather
mysterious circumstances. His coming cleared up
the mystery. The ladies were thrilled, naturally,

and spent the following day in telling their friends
about it and inviting them to the seance which they
intended to hold that evening. They were sure
that one of them was a fully developed trumpet
medium.
That night, their friends gathered with all the
expectations of having a miracle performed for
their benefit. They went to the seance room They
waited —and waited—and waited. And not one
single spirit voice even whispered. You would
think that after ten years of development sitting,
this night of failure would have turned Mrs.
Edwards against mediumship. But she was de
termined. She continued her nightly sittings—
and five years later she received her trumpet
mediumship!
She spent fifteen years in praying, hoping, wait
ing, studying—and most of all, working. "Mother"
Edwards was not a "natural" psychic. She had to
work for her development, and she knew that
"prayer without works is fruitless." She developed
into a wonderful medium, sat for the Cincinnati
Psychic Research Society many times, for well
known people from all over the country, and
brought untold amounts of comfort and inspiration
to thousands. So—don't be discouraged.
Probably you have noticed that nearly every me
dium has recommended that the student of medium-
ship should sit in a developing class guided by an
already developed medium. This book is not in
tended to take the place of these classes in any way,
for there is no substitute for class work. A person

may learn to play the violin by himself, but an
accomplished violinist can teach him more in ten
minutes than he can teach himself in a week.
There is a great need for mediums, and there is
no reason why many people cannot develop me-
diumship to some degree at least. There is a story
in the Bible about two men, named Eldad and
Medad. "The spirit rested upon them—they pro
phesied in the camp." One young man, evidently
a little jealous, ran to Moses and said, "Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp."
A certain Joshua also put in his plea, "My lord
Moses, forbid them."
Moses' answer is classical. "Enviest thou for my
sake? Would God that all the Lord's people were
prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit
upon them!"
If you wish to develop mediumship, I suggest
that you dedicate yourself to the service of the
world of spirit. Do this and you need have no fear.
You may be persecuted and reviled, but you have
made of yourself a divine dedication to truth and
the advancement of humankind. You may be poor,
but you will not hunger. You may find a particu
lar phase of mediumship, or you may discover that
you have other talents of even greater benefit to
mankind.
And remember this—"there are diversities of
gifts, but the same Spirit. To one is given the word
of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge, to
another faith, to another the gifts of healing, to
another the working of miracles, to another pro

Yes, there are diversities of gifts. And what
ever yours may be, use it so that ignorance and
misery and sorrow and death may be done away
with—and in their places will come wisdom and
health and happiness and life.
