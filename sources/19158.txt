you
my name is Joe what a key and I
completed a 20 year career in the Air
Force in 1988 I retired as a lieutenant
colonel in the spring of 1988 during
that 20 years I spent a good significant
substantial portion of my assignments
within Strategic Air Command the first
part of my career and another
substantial portion tactical and
I can pay my career in
superior force
well the event occurred very early
during my Air Force service it was in
1969 April of 1969 April 17th if if my
reflections and my logbook help me
accurately pinpoint that I had just
received my private pilot&#39;s license in
fact the day before on April 16th I had
successfully completed my Private Pilot
check ride and on the evening of April
17th the next day my instructor and I
had a brief flight in the holy contained
within the traffic pattern at Loring Air
Force Base in northern Maine and the
purpose of that flight was to give me a
night certification check ride so there
was a solid overcast that night at 3,000
feet above ground level which gave us
plenty of necessary altitude for the
touch-and-go landings in maintaining VFR
visual flight rules requirements and we
were landing to the south there was a
light breeze from the south the runways
of Loring were aligned one nine zero
degrees to the south and zero one zero
degrees to the north North by East and
the breeze was was fairly gentle but it
was significant enough that we did have
the South runway as active with my
instructor in the right seat and me
flying the airplane from the left see
the tower called us by our cessna
registration number and asked us if we
had seen anything unusual north of the
base and that was
that was the way they posed the question
did you see anything unusual north of
the base
I was pretty focused on the instruments
and trying to impress my instructor with
my ability to control the airplane at
night but he had time on his hands so he
responded to the towers call and said
that in fact he had on our previous
pattern seen a flash a bright flash of
light north of the base both my flight
instructor and I were living on Loring
Air Force Base at that time so it was a
matter of minutes to drive back into the
housing area so from the time we
responded to that inquiry from the tower
until the time we had driven back into
the housing area and we&#39;re getting out
of the car it was probably something in
the area of 30 minutes and as we got out
of the car my flight instructor was
looking back to the Northeast in the
direction of the runway and said what is
that I deleted an expletive but what is
that and I looked up in the direction he
was looking and he was looking in the
sky over the runway and what we saw were
three very bright but independent lights
and I mean three separate lights we
assumed they were independent and they
were in a perfect I is I equal lateral
the perfect triangle triangular
formation with the point south
the other two points of the triangle
directly behind it to the north the the
curious thing about this formation of
lights that caused us to watch it for an
extended period of time
ten or fifteen minutes we&#39;ve watched it
was that first it was silent second it
was moving slowly but in a perfectly
constant altitude perfectly constant
velocity and perfectly constant
direction from north to south we pieced
together later it was actually coming
from the direction where my flight
instructor had reported seeing the flash
of light earlier what was equally
curious about this since there was
absolutely no noise associated no sound
whatsoever associated with these lights
that they appeared to be drifting but
since they were traveling to the south
and having just landed the airplane
within the previous half hour we knew
unequivocally that the wind direction
was from the south and anything drifted
moving in the opposite direction so it
was some propulsion it was it was
purposeful
Manor and we also knew because we had
just landed that the storm 2000 foot
overcast and life that we were seeing so
brilliant that there is no way that they
were and we obscured by cloud or any
other escapes occasion so we knew that
that it is less than 3000 feet above the
ground we&#39;re sure how far away a lot but
it did appear to be over the runway
which hates on the formation the once
would have made made it very large if it
had been a single craft ship we agreed
after watching it with some fascination
for a period of 10 minutes or so so we
had no idea where but there is also not
likely to do about it and it wasn&#39;t
until the next morning when I report for
duty
this would have been the morning of
April 18 the first first duty I had each
day was to report to a wing stand-up
briefing in the wing command post this
was a Strategic Air Command beta
specified that
exactly equipped with as I recall three
squadrons of b-52s two squadrons of
kc-135 and a squadron of f-16 fighter
interceptors that world with poison
I arrived at the command post next
morning about 6:30 it was unusually act
and news will be well staff in fact was
v+ activity and our people who had
obviously been there most of the night
from their general appearance apparent
level of frustration so I very quickly
learned what what and occurring during
an I was began at about the time I saw a
delight it seems these guys in position
itself over the workforce because over
the alert had to be 52 figure to their
wartime and should be required therefore
there was doubt this was a very
sensitive area I can refer to the stuff
that they were prepared to carry out
their wartime
and these lights were very interested in
that
wartime configuration it would appear so
this was the center of focus the lights
they position themselves in that area it
was a typical training day for the Fort
Seddon Bomb Wing at our Air Force Base
and there were a lot of aircraft sorties
returning to base that night from their
daily training missions and that sort of
thing
and as as sorties returned I was told by
was doing in there overnight they were
asked to close and try to identify close
lifts try to identify these lies and
this included b-52s kc-135 and somebody
in those days interceptors they&#39;re in
there doing their particular training
missions as well and the pattern was the
same each time an aircraft would
approach the light wooden part in ways
that deciding aerodynamic knowledge did
anybody there had or could explain just
rapid accelerations rapid change
deflection variable and just doing
things that something that&#39;s flying by
the rules of aerodynamics to the
understand
always return to their point of entrance
which was the aircraft and then at some
point late in the night early in the
morning curiosity was data tie and they
they took off very expeditiously we&#39;re I
would be gifting how many hours this
took this whole event took from
beginning to end but it was certainly
probably in the range of six and perhaps
more hours duration and I filed it away
and I just mused about it and I
discussed it with a few people over the
years
not too many until a day in early in the
1990s I I forget the exact year and date
but it was about 93 or 94 that I had
occasion to attend a lecture by dr.
Steven Greer in Hampton Virginia
and saw a photograph of what I now
understand is a very familiar sighting
among those who have been privileged to
actually see UFO and learned at that
time when I saw the photograph I
literally jumped out of my seat grab my
wife by the hand and I said that&#39;s it
that is exactly what I had seen over
nearly 25 years ago at that point but to
see that picture just brought back the
image so strikingly clear that there was
no doubt in my mind but that was exactly
what we had seen over the runway in
April of 1969 it was only then only then
that I had any notion that it was in
fact a single machine not three
independent machines but I will deduce
with some degree of knowledge that they
must have been because of the repeated
attempts of returning aircraft close
with them from distances and altitudes
where they couldn&#39;t have acquired them
visually because of the low ceiling that
night so I would deduce from that fact
that they were being tracked on radar
both ground control radar and airborne
radar on the the aircraft that we&#39;re
returning to base it would be a very
reasonable deduction to say that they
were easily being tracked on radar well
I was the public information officer at
that time
so I can say with a high degree of
certainty that there was no public
statement regarding the incident I&#39;m
sure that sac was involved real time as
it was happening and if there were radar
tapes perhaps that there was a record of
the events in that regard as well as
unsure classified message treatment I do
remember very clearly that no no
aggressive action was taken by the Air
Force by anybody at the wing in response
to the lights because they themselves
did in fact show no aggressive or
threatening behavior whatsoever they
were simply in airspace that was
restricted airspace but but they were
not doing anything that would prompt any
sort of a security response but upon
reflection and in retrospect it is
curious how quickly that&#39;s that subject
just was dropped
it just wasn&#39;t discussed but very
clearly having seen the photograph that
is part of your presentation I know
exactly what it was it is what you have
photographs of from many different
locations at many different times it was
the triangular very large
 bigger than a conventional flame
absolutely that&#39;s why I was so surprised
when I saw the photograph to learn that
those lights which were so far apart
could conceivably be part of a single
machine and why I assumed and for all
those years believed I had seen three
separate machines and I assumed
operating independently although their
formation was so perfect that in
retrospect clearly there&#39;s no reason to
assume they were three except that for
them to be part of one unit it would
have to have been so enormous ly large
compared to anything and at that time
b-52s were considered pretty big
airplanes and they disapproved anything
that would have been part of a b-52
and we heard a voice come on very
excited
say yelling at God was here was the end
of the world and we looked at each other
in flood strength what&#39;s going on there
another few seconds went by and another
voice came one more control this person
said that there&#39;s a there&#39;s something
over the ship what he said there&#39;s
something over the ship
