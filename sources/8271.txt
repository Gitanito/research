  		              		Experience Description   

  My near-death experience 08/03/2006  

  The anesthetist's phone started ringing, ‘Answer the cell phone, answer the cell phone.’ He left the surgery room to answer it when he shouldn't  have.  The baby felt heavy in the belly and I came to know afterwards that this can be a sign that the blood flow is being cut off from the vena cava.  In that moment, I began to feel very badly.  It was just like my other three pregnancies, but the anesthetist in these other occasions, made a maneuver that relieved me during the procedure.   
  
  Since anesthetist was not in the room,  I tried to talk with the nurse who was on my left side.  I looked at her and tried to explain what I felt.  Suddenly, she started to yell, “Mom, open your eyes! Open your eyes!” I thought to myself, “My eyes are open and I’m looking at the nurse.”  At this moment,  I felt my spirit shift back, as if my face was a mask. And yet I heard all that was happening in the room. A continual, high-pitch sound caught my attention.   
  
  I felt that I turned my face a little to the left and  saw that the sound came from the vital signs monitor. In this moment, my spirit left my body.  I was standing at the bedside watching the doctors and nurses working nervously. I heard heavy, fast footsteps coming from outside of the room.  My spirit stayed parallel to my body but I continued hearing what was going on the in the room.  The anesthesiologist entered the room,  started to swear, and was very nervous.  He ordered the nurse that used to be at my side to administer 5mg of ephedrine.  The nurse yelled back, “I cannot!”, and the anesthesiologist responded “Give all of it!.”  

  At this moment, I found myself lying on a white bed with hospital railings.  In this place, I felt an indescribably calm peace, almost like an absence of feelings.     I looked more carefully and saw in the distance many people dressed in white, grouped together in an all white place.  They looked like they were in a meeting. But nobody saw me and there was no one near me. I knew  that I wasn’t supposed to be there.   I heard my baby cry and  felt a strong pull on my back, as if it fit me into something. It felt like I was  rapidly descending.   I leaned almost by the point of my head, like going down a roller coaster upside down. I then fit into my body. I felt a strong burning rising up my legs until it reached my head.  I was back.  

  Then I heard the doctor or nurse who was with the baby ask the obstetrician if he could bring the baby to see me.  She responded, 'Not yet.' Everyone left the room and went to another birth.     
  
  The obstetrician stayed there sewing me up.  He finished, gathered some towels and threw them to me. I stayed in the room, cold, alone, naked and motionless.  The clock was pointed in my direction. After much time, the first nurse passed by me and asked with concern, 'What are you still doing there all alone?'  She took me to the recovery room.  Nothing more was said to me. 

   Later, in the room, I made friends with the girl that was sharing the room with me. She   had  a baby after I had mine.    She tells me excitedly that during her birth the doctors talked about another birth where the mother had died and came back. I let her finish and said, “You are telling my story.”
