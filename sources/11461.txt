  		              		Experience Description   

    I was having an argument with my girlfriend when she stabbed me in the chest.  One moment, I was sitting in a chair and the next thing I know, I was floating above my body.  I was watching the paramedics attend to me but I was looking at them from above.  

  Then everything went dark.  I was was not alone.  Someone was there with me and I've NEVER felt that kind of LOVE BEFORE. I did not want to leave him; I did not want to leave that LOVE.  He told me that I had to go back.  When I asked, 'WHY?' He replied, 'The kids are going to need you.'  It was as if he knew exactly what to say that would reach my HEART and mind.  Yet, to this day I have no children.  But I immediately answered, 'YES! OK!'    

  I woke up in the hospital.  About 30 minutes later, that SAME VOICE said to me, 'You are about to leave again, but don't worry.  You are coming right back.'  Then, I flat-lined again.  I was floating outside of my body again.  I was watching the nurses rush into my room. I was not worried because I knew that I was coming back.  I did come back and got better.    

  Ten years later in the year 2000, I was on a bus when that same voice from my NDE said to me, 'You are about to meet your wife.  She needs you and you need her.' We are still married to this day.
