THE MASTER’S CALL
Ages you’ve slept, enthralled by Nature;
Centuries have crept by, faintly recalled ;
Spheres unheralded enfold you, unnoticed,
Constant, filled with ecstasies never sensed.
Glorious splendors burst about you, stilled
To your earthly ears. W ill you be wise?
W e come and go— Beacons to open eyes.
Scorned by souls in lethargy, we press on,
Watchful for the keen mind, devoted beings
Seeking mystics’ call. Can’t you hear it?
Worlds upon worlds DO whirl about you,
Scintillating, their rays bearing delights,
Riches immeasurable, and infinite.
Man you are now— a god by trying.
Stretch forth your wings in flight to God.
Severed, apart, your soul will have flown
Back to its source— beginning— its own,
To drink again of the waters most freely—
Creative joy sublime—wholeness undefined!
Masters come and go. Give ear! Give ear!
Giving their lives that others may live;
Tired but never wearying, they trudge on,
Blessing all stopping to take heed,
Well-wishing those who but pass them by,
Helpful to the needy, hopeful for the doubter,
Their work their joy, sorrow happiness.
Give ear that you may hear the call;
Watch that you may see the glint
Of the Master’s eye, sense the fragrance
Of His sweet-smelling soul, perfumed
By God’s first choice of Aetheria,
Or feel the thrill of Spirit eternal—
He labors for your good and others—
Skilled in all things—man’s elder brothers.

SAINT GERMAIN
S
a in t G e r m a in is somewhat a mythical, historical figure
having been mentioned at various times during the past
three or four hundred years, and it is impossible to understand
just how he has been able to play the part he has manifested in
great historical events unless one understands the nature of the
human spirit, the Divine Spirit, the various bodies each individual
possesses, and how the individual spirits of each and all embodi­
ments culminate in the present-day life-stream of a person.
Since 1929 there has been a great awakening among mankind
on earth due to the direct effect of the Cosmic Light. Even as
early as 1875 when Master Root Hoomi, through the person of
Madam Blavatsky, founded the Theosophical Society, there was
much activity of the cosmic in our limited earth realm. Conse­
quently there have emanated from the Great Central Sun of all
life, many new cosmic activities, understood more or less by the
esoteric philosophers, little understood by science and even
unheard of by the average person.
I shall not tell you I will entirely clear up the terrible mis­
understandings that have arisen about Saint Germain because of
a very meagre knowledge and explanation of his life and activity
by pseudo-masters and messengers, but I am certain I can explain
much that has never before been published to the outside world.
I am certain, too, since I met Saint Germain at Mt. Shasta in
Northern California in September, 1940, there is no one of the
present generation on earth who has been so close to him as the
writer. I am privileged by Saint Germain and other ascended
masters to explain to the world, just as they explained them to
me, the higher laws of life. I especially invoke the blessings of
Saint Germain, Jesus, Mahatma Root Hoomi, Lord Maitreya,
Mary the Mother of Jesus, Joshua the Master of Love, Anoma
the Lord of Venus, Master Morya-(St. JohaJ^Sanat Rumara,
Lord Mahachohan and Archangel Michael and all the blessed
beings who have taught me the past eleven monthJ.

F OREWORD
The time is propitious for a manifesto to be published to the
outside world of the current events in the cosmic field of specu­
lative science from the standpoint of the esotericist or transcen­
dental philosopher. Saint Germain is now and has been for sev­
eral hundred years one of the chief exponents, if not THE chief
exponent of the metaphysical theorems appertaining to the tran­
scendental laws of life. There are masters and teachers of physical
science, mental science, and spiritual science. Saint Germain is
an ascended master. He mastered all laws of life so far as this
physical world is concerned. It is the aim of the writer to explain
as clearly as possible who Saint Germain is today, what his place
is in the cosmic scheme of things, and to clear up misunderstand­
ings and misinterpretations that have been published regarding
the so-called ascended masters. “A little knowledge is a dan­
gerous thing,” wrote Alexander Pope. This is particularly true
of those who have made outlandish claims regarding their indi­
vidual powers as “messengers of the ascended masters.”
There is almost as much difference between a so-called “mes­
senger” and a real master as there is between daylight and the
darkest night. No real master ever makes wild claims as to his
powers in the outer world, nor does he ever try to enforce the
least of the cosmic laws upon mankind. Love is the ruling princi­
ple of the masters. Jesus, and His Ascension, is the greatest
example of mastership the outside world has ever knowingly
produced. However, He even said, “Greater things shall ye do,
for I go to the Father.” I sincerely believe we shall do greater
things in this day than Jesus did in His day. Why should we not?
Certainly He knew what He was talking about. The world is
advancing forward, not backward. Did Jesus live today,
embodied, he could reach hundreds of millions of mankind with
His message of love. Is this not greater than when he was per­
forming His ministry? Is it impossible for Jesus to re-embody
today? I have been told by Mahatma Koot Hootm^zfToseph
the Father of Jesus), that Saint Germain was John the Brother-
-of J esus-at the time of the ministry of Jesip two thousand years
ago. Yes, Jesus and Saint Germain werejbrothers of the same
physical mother, and I have also been told they were Sons of the
same Spiritual Father—both divinely sent into this world to
enlighten the blind people of this dark planet. If they were
brothers then, certainly they ARE brothers now. Time is most
insignificant when considered from a Divine or eternally spiritual
viewpoint. Science, religion and philosophy—the triune pathway
/ ( it . %+q
F OR E WOR D
that leads to balanced enlightenment and illumination—which
have traveled more or less abreast up through the ages—must
now be given an accounting as to their being the main stem of
the Tree of Life and Understanding. A New Age is here—the
Golden Age. We must have a new statement of Life’s Laws to
correspond to human progress and advancement. We have known
and mastered Life’s manifestation in mentality and physicality.
Now we must learn and master the Spirit—LIFE ITSELF. The
invisible realm of actuality is now, in the New Age, to be learned,
mastered and experienced. The individual spirit of Saint Germain
has much to do with this new element in the mass consciousness
of mankind. He, I have been told, is to carry out the work in
the human octave of life that his -elder blmmtrr, Jesus, began
and planned when on earth two thousand years ago. It is no easy
task, but great hosts of ascended Beings from the cosmic realms
of life, have promised to assist him, and he does not hesitate to
make a statement at this time that thousands of his faithful
adherents have looked forward to for many years. He is aware,
so he has informed me, there are thousands of students of the
“I AM” principles he instituted who have been side-tracked by
pseudo-masters, who knew only the elementary teachings, but led
faithful, trustful students to think they were master-teachers.
Most terrible conditions, mentally and physically, have resulted
in unnumbered cases throughout America and the world simply
because the egotistical, partially-enlightened, sought to “lead the
blind.” Thousands have become fearful through affirmations
diabolically projected into the ethers to shatter their groping
minds. Destructive practices are ruthlessly committed in the
name of Truth and Righteousness. Students who choose to look
to God, Jesus Christ or even Saint Germain, without adherence
to those who have set themselves up as self-appointed masters,
are blasted with shattering decrees, denounced publicly, driven
insane and otherwise tortured until they know not which way
to turn. These are those whom Saint Germain wishes to reach,
assuring them that such “black” practices are not of God, the
Ascended Masters, nor the White Magic of Love the Master
Jesus taught us centuries ago.
It is in the name of the Lord of Love, the Goddess of Love,
Blessed Saint Germain and Jesus and our Beloved Lord Maitreya
that I submit the following encyclical, fully aware that the Council
of the Great White Brotherhood does heartily agree to its publi-
xiii

cation for the benefit and direction of those faithful thousands
who now struggle for the Light, Love, Wisdom and Power of
Almighty God.
Affectionately given,
September 11, 1941 AMSUMATA.
THE GREAT SPIRIT
For twenty-two years I was consciously under the instruction
of the Masters before those years of intense study and application
brought forth to me the actual tangible proof of the modus
operandi by which they do Their GREAT WORK in the outer
manifestation. My first contact with them was through the
Theosophical Society, after I had been an ardent student of
psychology and kindred subjects. My second contact with the
Masters came through R.S.C., the Rosicrucian Brotherhood; my
third through various Brothers of the Universal Brotherhood;
my fourth channel of initiation was Saint Germain’s so-called
“I AM” activity; and my fifth and greatest source of instruction,
initiations and ascension into the cosmic consciousness and spirit­
ual reality of Life, Light and Love, was directly through Brothers
of the Great White Lodge; and the physical place where I made
the supreme contact was Mount Shasta in northern California.
Mahatma Koot Hoomi (Kuthumi), to me the greatest Initiate
living on earth, had more to do with my actual instruction than
any other one Master; however, numerous ones did confer upon
me the particular initiatory work it is their respective duties to
perform in the various offices they hold in the Great White
Brotherhood. It was through the initiations I received from the
Great Mahatma Koot Hoomi that I was brought into perfect
contact with Saint Germain and through whose Light and Love
I am able to walk constantly beside Him (Saint Germain). We
became ONE IN SPIRIT. “I do nothing of myself, but by
(Him) the Father.” As each Great Being initiated me into
Their “Temple” of Wisdom I also became ONE with them in
Spirit and in Truth. All who seek the whole Truth must first
find that ONENESS IN SPIRIT before they can actually contact
the Ascended Masters.
It was in the following order, as nearly as I can recall, that
I contacted those from whom I received instruction and initia­
tions: Mary, Mother of Jesus (Ave Maria), Mahatma Koot
X IV
F OREWORD
Hoomi -fJesepfe)T-Jesus, Archangel Michael, Lord Maitreya,
Sanat Kumara, Master Morya ’(Si. Johnny Joshua, Lord Ma-
hachohan, Beloved Krishna, Buddha Gautama and Anoma, Lord
of Venus. Other Masters I contacted, whom I may now recall,
but did not instruct me, were: The Venetian, Hilarion, Master
Serapis (Egyptian Temple), Issyra. In 1925 I had made the
acquaintance of Master Kelpa, who gave me marvelous instruc­
tion, informed me he was “finishing” and would soon ascend,
and asked me to carry on his teaching after he passed. For many
years I had received instruction through Saint Germain in the
inner levels. Through Him and Master R.S.C. I had received
my earlier training. It was in 1929 that I began to be conscious
of the great influence Saint Germain had, in spirit, over my life-
stream (Tree of Life). This spiritual influence proved to be
more dominant in my life from 1933, just previous to the birth
of a son in our family, David. He was a most remarkable child,
having, for example, sung and hummed the sacred word AUM
of the Orient many times daily from when he was two months
of age. He never once cried before he was ten months of age.
He ascended soon after his sixth birthday anniversary, but not
before he had taught me many things through his radiation of
Divine Love and his direct verbal expression of the higher laws
of life. He seemed to know everything without even thinking.
Probably I shall explain more regarding this episode of my life
in future chapters of this brief book, when a further explanation
of the Divine Spirit is given.
Following my explanation of the Great Spirit or ONENESS
OF ALL LIFE, I shall give you the events in their chronological
order as they occurred following my contact with Mary, the
Mother of Jesus, at Mount Shasta, August 29, 1940.
THE BIRTH OF FREEDOM
Would it not be heavenly, were we all free individuals, with
nobody to look to for orders? With nobody to criticise or
reprimand ? With nothing but kindliness to admonish us regarding
our mistakes? Would it not be a Paradise to look up to the
bright glowing sun in crystal-blue heavens and just feel that you
were entirely free from all HUMAN bondage, rid of all fear
that ever caused you to think one single thought of hate toward
another human being? Can you visualize what every individual
upon this earth might enjoy were we independent of human mis-
X V
FOREWORD
takes and entanglements into which we have been drawn by
HUMAN DESIGNS AND CREATIONS throughout the
ages? Think of the blissful joy we might share among earth’s
own splendors, even today, were it not for human hate, selfishness
and discord. What pleasures we humans do deny ourselves!
Simply because we do not understand the WHOLE. Our free­
dom cannot extend beyond our innate intelligence. We are the
ones who bind ourselves; we are the ones who must sever the
chains of selfishness by our own God-given will. You must look
to yourself, to your own heart, your own intelligence—that
“I AM” intelligence—if you would be FREE.
This matter of FREEDOM—this quality of freedom—this
progress of freedom—this universal battle FOR FREEDOM is
the throe of travail of old Mother Earth bursting forth into a
new BIRTH OF FREEDOM. The now-historical Wall Street
crash, the subsequent depression, labor strikes and riots, inter­
national financial quandaries, and all the depressive mental
stresses and reactions resultant on the part of humanity as a
whole, ARE THE LABOR PAINS OF MOTHER EARTH,
through which she is now passing in order to give birth to our
blessed UNIVERSAL FREEDOM. The forces of LIGHT
have at last won; the forces of darkness are on the run. To him
who sees the cosmic writing on the wall of time, numerous mani­
festations are now apparent to prove it.
That you who read this story, how the LIGHT “I AM”
gradually expanded from within me out into this human HEART,
BRAIN, BODY AND WORLD, to express herewith this
explanation of LIFE, I am going to give a simplified analogy.
This you will never forget, for it will “bring home to you” your
closeness to God, your dependence upon God and your INDE­
PENDENCE of humanly created restraint and domination.
WHAT MAKES THE HEART BEAT? For many years
as a young man and even as I came to be mature, I thought science
understood all such matters. Well, they didn’t. Your guess,
up until a few years ago, when came forth Saint Germain’s expla­
nation of it from the higher octave of life, was just as good as
any doctor’s or scientist’s. In a publication I once published,
not infrequently I provoked people to think of the deeper phases
of life by asking them such questions as “What makes the heart
beat?” 1 might ask you, “What makes a leaf green?” or “What
makes a flower bloom? Where does it get its life, its beauty
and loveliness?” There is but ONE GOD-—ONE LIGHT—
X V I
F OR E WOR D
ONE LIFE—ONE CENTER. We are each and every one of
us cells in the body of the WHOLE. In the physical octave of
life we can only use geometrical symbols in explaining the vibra­
tory status of each octave of life. Realizing that there is but
ONE and that you are a UNIT in THAT ONE, even though
you be an infinitesimal unit within it, then you, too, must realize
“ ‘I AM’ ONE with THAT ONE and IT is my FATHER.”
Jesus said “I can do nothing of myself, but by the Father.” In the
Bible is also stated, “You are made in the image of God.” Now
that does not mean simply that you are shaped “like Him,” but,
also, that you walk about within Him, you breathe Him, you are
within Him, “closer than hand or foot.” Now, what MAKES
THE HEART BEAT?
Have you heard of the “silver cord” that is broken when
one dies and passes from the physical body? It, too, is mentioned
in the Bible. There is nothing that will ever be mentioned on
this earth regarding the transcendental phases of life that is not
somewhere hidden within the pages of Holy Writ. But it has been
so twisted, mistranslated, misinterpreted and knowingly and
unknowingly abused and misused by priests and preachers, poets
and writers for so many hundreds of years that there are few
who possess enough of the “Light” within themselves to recog­
nize IT. WHAT MAKES THE HEART BEAT? There is a
silver cord or stream of light that comes through the top of your
head, which is anchored within your heart. That is what makes
your heart beat. It is connected to your heart just the same as
your electric light is connected with the powerhouse or generator
from which it receives its “juice” or electricity. God is the power­
house; you are one of His Lights. God is the WHOLE; you are
a unit of the WHOLE. That is why God is Holy—He is the
WHOLE. When you become WHOLLY perfect you become
ONE WITH GOD. When you become ONE WITH GOD you
are God. Jesus said, “I and the Father are ONE and the
SAME,” and “Even greater things than these shall ye do-, for
I go to the Father.” These are the things I want to explain to
you and “I AM” the LIGHT that can explain them. YOU ARE
the LIGHT, too, but you MUST KNOW YOU ARE THAT
LIGHT before it will reveal ITSELF to you as the LIVING
GOD, the Great Cosmic Light which worketh such wonders
with man these days.
Now, I shall give you the real bodily analogy, since you
KNOW you have a part with the Living God, the Light of
XV II
F OREWORD
God—the “I AM” Presence of God. You might wonder why
I write in the FIRST PERSON. It might sound silly to you,
but I AM THE FIRST PERSON, and I want you to realize
that YOU ARE, too, THE FIRST PERSON, and in order
for you to see things clearly and directly I MUST talk to you
direct. You yourself, are the analogy. You, in the physical body
—the physical part of you, according to science, are made up
of about three billion cells. Where do those cells get their life?
Did you say, “from the food you eat?” That is silly indeed!
If that were true science could produce a synthetic man just as
wise and intelligent as you. But science cannot produce a man,
because science is not God—the Great Central Sun of all Life
and God is the One who gives you the real life that courses
through your nervous system. The physical part of those cells
does come from the food you eat, mostly, at least, we will admit,
but the life principle, the Cosmic Light Part—the Real Self that
thinks and directs the movements of your physical body—is the
Being anchored within your heart. In speaking of you I say,
“YOU ARE,” in speaking of myself, I say “I AM” the Life,
the Light, the Love, the Intelligence and Energizing Substance
which “I AM.” You are the Lord and Master over those three
billion cells. Those cells look to you for life and sustenance.
Your heart-center is their God. You were made in the image
and likeness of God. What are you doing with your heritage?
Those cells are your world. Think of the millions of little lives
crying to you for life, light and love. And have you realized
that there is a human being somewhere within this particular
universe that corresponds to each and every cell within you?
In other words there are probably the same number of individual
souls in and about this earth as there are cells within your physical
body. Had you ever thought of that? You are a single cell in
God’s body; these physical cells in your body are single units
within you. Isn’t it simple? So simple that the would-be-wise
overlook it all for looking outside instead of inside. Just as there
are billions of tiny suns blazing in your body, you are a sun (son)
shining in the body of God. You are actually a Son of God.
As you become fully aware of your sonship with God you will
begin to feel the Electronic Light-Substance flowing into your
heart. You will actually see it. It is only through this complete
radiance and the full realization of its Love, Wisdom and
Power, that you catch the idea of Eternal Youth, and KNOW
that you ARE A “WHITE-FIRE BEING IN THE HEART
xviii
F OREWORD
OF GOD.” Physical activity, cleanliness, dietetics, proper breath­
ing, visualization, concentration, qualification of the Light-
Energy as it comes into the body—purity of mind—are all
necessary aids in bringing about harmony in the physical body
enabling one to realize ONENESS with GOD.
Friend, look to your heart. Speak to it. It is the nearest you
can get to God, because it is actually God beating your heart,
t Your own God-Presence is just above your head, too. You have
other bodies besides your physical body. Call to God to reveal
these things to you. Speak to God. God spoke to Moses from a
burning bush. He spoke to Jesus, Elijah and hundreds of others.
It is not unusual for people to speak to God these days, and it
is not unusual for God to answer. When you understand that all
Life is electro-magnetic—electrons and protons—it is as simple
as your radio.
IMPERSONALITY
Now, I (we) must carry the analogy of the universality of
life and the Great Spirit further, so that you may realize more
fully your oneness with God—His Light, Love, Wisdom, Power
and Intelligence. You shall know God when YOU BECOME
LIKE HIM. How can you become like Him unless you think
of yourself as being like Him? Does a barred rock egg, laid by
a barred rock hen, fertilized by a barred rock rooster, have much
trouble becoming a barred rock chicken, if placed under a barred
rock setting hen, so that Nature (instinct)—God’s out-picturing
in the physical octave—can take its natural course? It certainly
does not. Then, do you think you will have much difficulty becom­
ing like God, should you make up your mind to depend upon God,
to trust in Him, to visualize yourself as His Son, to long for
His perfection and be His mighty powers of Love? Yes, we have
physical fathers and we have spiritual fathers. There is the
physical body and there is the spiritual body, as Paul so ably
explained in the Holy Scripture. Each has its corresponding
parents—Father-Mother. In higher occult and spiritual circles,
so to speak, Joseph and Mary are recognized as the Spiritual
Parents of the Fifth Root Race?. It is the Great Spirit in Its
infinite activity that so few of today really understand. The
reason they do not understand is simple. They have not attained
to that divine principle in their own individual development.
One cannot accept something one has not experienced. The
X IX
F OR E WOR D
Divine Incarnation is experienced only by those who become
Brides and Bridegrooms in the Spirit of Christ.
In your physical body, mind and soul, you are a world within
yourself. Remember, you are, in addition to other SPIRITUAL
or ELECTRONIC adjuncts, three billion five hundred million
little cell-worlds—all looking to you for guidance—just as you,
as an individual, should you have the proper faith, look for all
your needs in God. Visualize yourself as large as the United
States. Your head is in Washington state, your toes are in Flor­
ida; your heart is in Denver, Colorado; your right hand in Los
Angeles, your left in New York. Do you think you will have
any trouble feeling your foot down in Florida? Lour heart in
Denver? Or your hand in Los Angeles? Intelligence is instan­
taneous. God is pure Intelligence. You are in the Body of God.
Do you think, even though you are an infinitesimal point in the
Body of God, that He has any difficulty in knowing you are
there? Absolutely not! Not any more than you would find it
difficult to feel a fly walking across your toe, even though your
toe were in Florida, and your brain, where you receive the elec­
tronic message via the nervous system, were in Washington.
For each and every individual in the world there is an invisible
ray of light connecting all hearts to the Heart of God, just as
every cell and atom in your physical body is connected with your
heart through your nervous system. As there are billions of tiny
suns blazing in your body, you are a sun (Son) shining in the
Body of God. You are actually a Son of God. When you become
fully aware of your Sonship with God you will that instant begin
to feel the Electronic Light-Substance flowing into your heart.
Again, returning to the visualization that God is the WHOLE
BODY OF ALL—EVER PRESENT in His boundlessness,
and you a cell in THAT BODY, let us consider for a moment
the element of Time, as we see it in the physical octave. There
can be no such principle of Time, as we understand it, in the
ALL-KNOWING, ALL-PRESENT, EVER-PRESENT
(WHOLLY) FATHER. Time is a humanly created element
that has to do with physical objects and life in the physical plane.
Physical objects—even planets and stars—are the products of the
GOD-INTELLIGENCE and SUBSTANCE under controlled
expansion from within out through God’s suns (Sons) and satel­
lites, lesser-gods, goddesses, human beings, animals, insects,
plants and minerals. If there were but one physical object in all
creation—small or large—with one single mind, which filled the
X X
F OR E WOR D
entire object, how could there be such an element as Time? But
let that single mind-object conceive the possible creation of
another mind-object—with the consciousness of space in between
them—immediately—instantaneously—you have brought into
extrinsicality the element of TIME. However, let me remind you
that even the first object, in its exoteric physicality, had to be
first conceived by a PURE INFINITE INTELLIGENCE—
1HE GREAT SPIRIT—and all mind-objects ever conceived
from the beginning of TIME, are STILL within the first MIND-
OBJECT, which is GOD—ALMIGHTY GOD—INFINITE
GOD. Remove all material things, the planets and all earthly
objects, and there would be no Time. However, that need not
affect the intelligence, light-substance, which is the ONE INFI­
NITE MIND.
As a matter of comparison, taking small, infinitesimal forms
of life on the one hand and human beings on the other, let us
see if we can come to a better understanding of the mocking
delusion Time really is. Science has proved there are infinitesimal
animalculae so extremely tiny that if one started to walk or creep,
as the case may be, from your toe to the top of your head and
back again where it started, it would take it just as long as it
would for you to encircle the earth by walking around it. The
millions and billions of forms of physical life, I believe, are but
the outer incrustation of the inner expansion of the ONE LIFE.
If intelligence can exist in an infinitesimal speck so small that even
a microscope cannot magnify it to be seen, then it is possible for
intelligence to exist in an object so large that it might be infinite.
I am certain I AM in the Body of God—in HIS BEING.
I am just as certain that everything in all existence is also.
I believe some of us are in the Heart of God, some NEAR His
Heart, some in His hands, others in His feet, some in His head,
etc. We go out from His Heart-Center and we return to THAT
CENTER. Until we determine our own way, God determines
it for us. The main object in life—physical life—is to get back
to God. Man is given free-will so he can do this. If he were not
thrown out on his own he could never become like God. As
individuals we may flounder around in the stream of Life for
hundreds of centuries, and possibly sink into oblivion, but the
probable thing we will do is what God intended us to do when
He projected us into this realm of the human free-will—
BECOME LIKE HIM—AGAIN. Life in this octave is its own
excuse for being. Life is constant change. Now we want more
xxi
F OR E WOR D
life, light and love. We will get it when we get back and when
we get back we will find that it is simply a state of consciousness.
Especially the physical plane. We came from nowhere and we
are going nowhere. WE ARE. I AM. GOD!
FIRST GOLDEN AGE MANIFESTO OF THE
GREAT WHITE LODGE
Blessed Brothers of Light
And all who seek the Light of Christ:
With urgency I proclaim to you a vital message—a Message
of Light, Love, Wisdom and Power, from the Great Masters
of the White Brotherhood, and from the Council of the Great
White Lodge. God Almighty, and the Blessed Christ Incarnate,
be our witness, to the Most Blessed Message that has come forth
to the people of this world in thousands of years.
Our Brother Amsumata of Bela, Guru, who received his
final initiations through Mahatma Root Hoomi, Lord Maitreya,
Master Issa, Lord Sanat Kumara and God of the Golden Heart
Mahachohan and the Lord of Lords Buddha Gautama, with the
assistance of Ave Maria, the Mother of Jesus, whose son he
(Amsumata) was at the time of the Ministry of Jesus almost
two thousand years ago,—does proclaim to all true seekers of
Light and Love, hopeful of its acceptation by those who know
Christ IN THEIR HEARTS, that he did ascend unto His
Father last June 4, 1941, through the Blessed Initiations afore­
mentioned at Mount Shasta in northern California, where he was,
as he has stated, not only conscious of the ascension, but was also
conscious of the crucifixion, saw the RED BLOOD pour from
his hands, feet and the “pierced side,” was conscious of the
“GOLD ESSENCE” being charged into his “higher body,” and
now bears the evidence of Christ incarnate in his physical body.
“She who is Nameless,” the “Jewel of the Golden Age,” also
of the “Golden Body of God,” did witness all regarding the
initiation and ascension of Amsumata, “The Radiant One,” just
as He did witness the incarnation of Christ in Her and as the
“Silent Watcher,” whose office He did hold, was with Her during
the time that She did grow and develop into the FULL ILLUM­
INATION of the Jewel of the Golden Age now being established
in Earth “in the Hearts and Minds of Mankind.”
Following His ascension Amsumata was taken into the Great
Presence, as the “Most Beloved Disciple,” of Lord of Lords
XXII
F OR E WOR D
Buddha Gautama, which is interpreted “Maitreya, THE
DOOR,” the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light, IN CHRIST.
Therefore Amsumata is “Maitreya” to “Seekers of Light.”
In the same Light and Love that Jesus spoke centuries ago,
and by the same authority of the Heavenly Father, the Cosmic
Father, through the Universal Media of the Great White Broth­
erhood, and by the empiric authority of the Great Mahatma
Koot Hoomi (KH) and Master Morya '(-St. John) ,■Manu of
the Seventh or Golden Age, Amsumata does proclaim to the
world, “I AM THE DOOR THAT NO MAN CAN SHUT,
for the Father has chosen me as His Beloved Son to bear the
Cross for the many who now seek entrance through the ‘portal’
into the ‘Temple of Light, Wisdom and Power’ of Almighty God,
the Cosmic Father of all, who now calls His Sons of Righteous­
ness and Truth home again.”
“Oh, Prince of the Golden Heart, where art Thou my Son?”
spoke the voice of the Almighty. “I am your Father, God of the
Golden Heart. I come to take you home into the Sun again.”
“Here am I,” answered Amsumata. “Thou knowest I love
Thee and Thy Truth, Thy Light, Love and Wisdom above all
things of earth.”
And following the 12th of November, 1940, the Great Mas­
ters did come forth to teach Amsumata, one after another, as
their duties were performed in their respective offices they hold
in the Great White Brotherhood. And just this week Mahatma
Koot Hoomi has declared the “finishing touches have been met
as advocated” to ripen and develop the “Chief-Avatar,” who
“now must not let shyness delay your accepting the cross placed
on your shoulders to carry.”
Mount Shasta, “The Mountain of God,” has been chosen by
the Great Brotherhood as the “DOOR,” where Amsumata-
“Maitreya” shall receive and initiate those “proven worthy” into
“that Temple not made by hands eternal in the Heavens.”
Master KH and Morya, both residing now in Tibet, have
promised to be here in America early next year to assist Amsu­
mata, the “Chosen One,” in his momentous work of bringing all
true seekers of Light unto Christ the Radiant Sun (Son) of
Almighty God.
Sincerely, in Plis Name, the Light of Christ,
SANUTRA.

the Universal Brotherhood as Sanutra.)

FOREWORD
THE JEWEL OF THE GOLDEN AGE
The Jewel of Perfection has risen to Her rightful place in
the heavens. The Sons of Righteousness guard Her Throne.
She blesses them with Her Love-Light. She feeds them crystal-
clear honey through the fragrance of Her love. They feed the
world. She reigns Queen.
The Lord of Love rules in the Heart of the Jewel. Wisdom
stands at Her left hand—Power at Her right. Beauty and Good­
ness are Her hand-maidens. Her Great White Diamond radiates
purity to every human heart. Her words are like the soft musical
petals of a Lotus, falling into a weary world to shed Love and
Peace eternally.
Jewels there be—yes, many of them. But the Jewel of Jewels
is “She Who is Nameless.” For Her the Gods have long waited.
Her Light illumines the world. To Her all Masters now bow
in humble homage. Her Love is the Law of the New Golden
Age. Her radiance now becomes the OUT-PICTURING OF
PERFECTION THROUGH THE SONS OF GOD. Her
Love reigns. It is Law.
The Jewel of Jewels, now risen—IN FULL ILLUMINA­
TION—now walks forth the BRIDE OF CHRIST, and all
shall soon be called to the Great Feast. “And the Spirit and the
Bride say, ‘Come.’ And let him that heareth say, ‘Come.’ And
let him that is athirst come; and whosoever will, let him take the
water of life freely.” Christ is here again. '
And all who look for Him will see Him as He is. And we had
a promise of God that He would appear in the heavens August 27,
1941, A.D. HE DID APPEAR. May the world rejoice that the
Jewel of Jewels is in Complete Illumination. She is the Law of
the New Golden Age.
Sincerely and affectionately given,
GURU AMSUMATA

“To Amsumata:
“The light is strong to begin the greatest outpouring of the Light of
the World, and as the years grow on and on the Universal Power will be
increased a million fold to bring out the development we talked of. I am
sure you have that intuition, but I am using the Amanuensis to emphasize
the necessity to not waste any time, as the distance grows shorter and
shorter as the time rushes on us. The great disaster is upon us if not
unfolded in the scheme as planned by all the Masters at our Great Con­
clave; for a T IM E and PLACE is marked out and the delay in the
development must be avoided and not let drift, but as the stars are set and
place for all things timed, so must our plans be fulfilled and you, ‘Chosen
One,’ now must not let shyness delay your accepting the cross placed on
your shoulders to carry. Many may be in the error of overlooking the
timely training, the FACES, as it were, that have been used to ripen and
develop the leader to the point of assuming the place as head of the staff
when all is ready, Chief-1Avatar,’ and so the way is shaping now to start
the procedure when the finishing touches have been met as advocated. The
timing of the writing completed, look well to the ‘East’ and stand at
attention when you see ‘Soon-Day’ Sun advance, and as the waning (sunset)
takes place do the vows we all agreed, and grow stronger and stronger, My
‘Azamata,’ and be a G R EAT STAR in the Firmament of our ‘Brother­
hood’—and BE W HERE A LL CAN BEHOLD. I am staying firmly
at your side, and will so continue.
“Your teacher,
“RO O T H OOM I (K H ).”
P.S. From Amsumata: I wish it to be understood that it is the

The Amanuensis who received the above letter knew nothing
of my spiritual association with Mahatma Koot Hoomi at the
time it was received, which proved to me conclusively the definite
source from which I had received much spiritual instruction. It
also proved to me that Ascended Masters such as Koot Hoomi
can use specially prepared persons as instruments through whom

instructions in the Great Work may be given to the outside
world; however, I do not wish to convey the idea that all or even
the greater part of my instruction was received in this manner.
I have received revelations, discipline, instruction and almost
every conceivable form of spiritual elucidation.
Maitreya’s Golden Age is here at last. In this book may be
found that wisdom that proves to him who seeks sincerely in
his heart, THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. The pro­
found laws of life are herein simplified in a manner never before
presented in the world. We are confident that Christ’s Message
will joyously reach the sincere seeking heart, and we are certain,
too, that much so cunningly hidden from the exotericist during the
“dark ages” is now revealed through the GREAT COMMAND

THE GREAT SPIRIT
The Love-Breath
I sensed the sweet-scented Love-Breath;
’Twas wafted from somewhere afar—
I dreamed it came through Thy Love-Will
From the radiant distant Love Star.
Like roses melted with sun-mist ;
Like a heavenly dew with pink glow,
That attar of roses enfolded me—
Through me, Master, it did flow.
The song of your heart came with it,
Your letters were missives of Light;
I heard the music of angels—
A ll things did beckon my sight.
Thy golden voice in the night
Brought love and strength profound.
Now, where art Thou, Oh, Rose-Breath?
Oh, where art Thou to be found?
Touch my heart with Thy fingers of Light;
Fill it with Thy Golden Glow;
Race the golden fire through my veins;
Reveal Thy Double Rainbow;
Immerse me in the Ocean of Might;
Place in my hand the Sceptre of Blue ;
Embolden me with the power of Right,
Blaze the Golden Light thru and thru.
Seize my mortal, hold it true ;
Enfold me in Thy dazzling White,
The Gold, the Pink and the Blazing Blue;
Hold me in Thy embrace tight.
Carry me to the Central Sun ;
Take me to the Radiant One;
Invest me with Thy Golden Key,
That I may open T H Y DOOR to THEE!

CH APTER I
During the month of June, 1939, I went from Eureka, Calif.,
to Los Angeles to attend the semi-annual conclave of the so-called
“I AM” students of Saint Germain assembled at the Shrine Audi­
torium. Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Ballard had just at that time
attained the peak of their religious-philosophical movement,
under the direction (we do not doubt) of Saint Germain. The
Ballards were messengers of the Ascended Masters, as was and
is shown by the marvelous discourses received and recorded
through Mr. Ballard. Evidence of the authenticity of the dis­
courses can be no better proven than by the understanding of
the transcendental laws of life so truthfully and accurately
delineated.
I had also attended the conclave at the Shrine Auditorium
during the summer of 1938; had read every book and magazine
published by the organization up to that time, having received
the first edition of “Unveiled Mysteries” from my “director” in
the Universal Brotherhood in 1934. I was fully aware of the
activity, inner and outer, and knew the Masters of the Great
White Lodge were not only directing The Ballards through
Saint Germain, but knew also that Saint Germain himself was
being directed by the Great Lodge. In 1925, when I had first
experienced such a state of consciousness as the ascension, I had
gone, so to speak, into the Cosmic Heart of ALL LIFE (GOD)
and returned to the lower planes of consciousness with a very
important message for this world. This message had to do with
the incoming of the Golden Age.
Even before I returned to this outer consciousness I went to
the Supreme Master of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood (then my
teacher) and told him that the Cosmic Light would become so
intense in this world that only those of the Light would be able
to remain here. “Those who do not harmonize with the Great
Light,” I explained, “will not be able to live upon this earth.”
This will be and IS TODAY the preparation for the establish­
ment of the New Golden Age, which, as I will explain later,
will be quite fully established by 1950. Through other persons,
writings and experiences, as well as events that came about in
tyiriO^
LORD M A I T R E Y A
the outer world, all such matters pertaining to the Cosmic Light
and its activity were confirmed in my personal mind and proven
in my individual experiences and physical activities. For instance,
I met and heard one Harry Eyer in 1926 in the Theosophical
Lodge Hall in Tacoma, Wash., who gave a dynamic lecture on
“Cosmic Rays.” He was so dynamic and powerful in his decla­
rations in expounding the transcendental laws regarding the
“spirit” and cosmic light I could actually see lightning flashing
about the hall. Up to that time Mr. Eyer was the most confident
and positive individual I had ever seen. HE KNEW LIFE
AND ITS LAWS. What he talked of confirmed what I had
already experienced in the inner planes, or higher cosmic
consciousness.
Previous to my going to the “I AM” conclave at Los Angeles
in 1939, there had been a disagreement with my wife regarding
my whole-hearted adherence to the “I AM” movement. She
could not realize in her outer consciousness just how thoroughly
I was enmeshed in the nucleus of the organization. My heart
and soul were in the matter. I had seen its inception on the
inner long before it became manifest in the outer octave; had
consciously conversed with Mr. Ballard in the higher planes,
directed the important phases of the activity, and frequently
contacted Mrs. Ballard, too, who was informed, in my presence
(on the inner planes) of Mr. Ballard’s eventual passing from
the physical body. Many of these matters I had written about
to Mr. Ballard. I have copies of the letters I wrote and the
answers he wrote to me, some of which will be published in this
book.
My wife, knowing I had ability to become more prosperous,
stubbornly persisted in encouraging me to turn my attention
more to money-making and home-making, and divorce myself
from the “insane idea” that I should “save the world.”
Therefore, when I went to Los Angeles, my heart was surely
troubled. I was torn between what I felt I should do in the
physical world and what my duties were regarding the Great
Spirit. Years previous it was very clearly shown to me that I
had embodied as Abraham Lincoln. Mr^Ballard claimed to be
the re-embodiment of George Washingtom/1 did not doubt his
statement. Too much had taken place in my own life-stream to
doubt such assertions from another. Following the conclave in
Los Angeles, after repeated failures to contact Mr. Ballard and
talk to him personally regarding matters of great importance
2
THE N E W - G O L D E N AGE
to the “I AM” organization, I again tried in every conceivable
way to get an interview with him. “Why shouldn’t Lincoln and
Washington work together?” I would speak silently under my
breath. I went to the Biltmore Hotel, called his secretary by
phone, called Mrs. Ballard by phone, sent notes to Mr. Ballard
from the foyer of the Shrine Auditorium, telling him it was
important that I see and talk to him. I had even written to him
before coming to Los Angeles, asking for an interview. Having
written such nice explanatory letters to me at various times
previously, I felt certain he would allow me to see him. Some­
how I was always prevented. Finding other avenues of approach
closed I went to Charles Sindelar, publisher of the “Voice,” the
“I AM” magazine, to see if he could arrange a meeting for me
with Mr. Ballard. Mr. Sindelar tried, but as usual, we met
failure. It seemed so important for “Lincoln” to see Washing­
ton, but it seemed the very “devils” of Hades were working
against both of us to prevent it.
In the meantime I had a most dramatic vision, a presentiment
of the passing of my beloved son, David, whom I knew to be the
re-embodiment of a great master. This came while I was trying
so hard to contact the Ballards and prove to them the position
I was to hold when the Ascended Masters were to actually begin
their work of establishing the new order on earth. I had definite
proof later that the “Blacks” were responsible for the sinister
activities then beginning to take place.
I have been told by my beloved teacher, Koot Hoomi, to
relate these things without reservation. This I shall do. One
cannot fully express the truths one knows in any other way. I
have nothing to hide. I have nothing to sell. I even haven’t an
“axe to grind.” I own nothing. I want nothing but to help lift
“fallen” humanity up to their own rightful sphere of life and
consciousness. This I know how to do, with the help of the
great Masters who have offered me help and protection, guidance
and direction, in all matters pertaining to God’s laws. It is as
Saint Germain told me the other day: “We are all ONE BODY
WEE, but many many are not up to par.” So, to all seekers
after wisdom I say, “I want to help you get back to par.” Isn’t
that a wonderful thought? Remember, you were up to “par”
one time. Now make up your mind to get back up “there.”
“The fatal blow” struck. At 12:15 P.M., August 12, 1939,
I received a telegram while staying at the “I AM” Sanctuary at
1320 South Hope Street in Los Angeles. The telegram read:
3
LORD M A I T R E Y A
“Norman R. Westfall, 1320 South Hope, Los Angeles. Come
immediately. David injured badly. Dorothy.”
I was sitting by the window in the Sanctuary reading the book,
“Ascended Master Light,” when the messenger boy brought the
telegram. This was the most crushing thing that had ever hap­
pened to me in this life. Of our five children David was the
youngest and most loved. He was a little ascended master him­
self. He had proven it. When 2 months of age he sat in his
cradle and sang the sacred word AUM, intoning it in two defi­
nite notes in a most powerful and musical manner. Every night
when put to bed and every morning when he awoke he hummed
and sang those words, radiating forth his love and light. Should
he happen to awaken in the night, which he did sometimes, he
would sing himself back to sleep, by continuing to hum the word
“AUM.” David never cried once before he was ten months of
age. He would sit as a “little Buddha,” smile and sing “A-a-a-a-
h-h-h—M-m-m-m-m,” over and over again and again. I loved
him more than anybody or anything in all the world. I was over­
come with grief. I thought my heart would burst. A woman we
called Elsie, who worked about the Sanctuary, and another, tried
to console me. They proclaimed decrees to the effect that all
was for the best, and whatever happened, David would either
be completely healed or ascend. The whole Sanctuary seemed
to be flooded with violet light. A great passion of sorrow envel­
oped me. I felt close to God Almighty. I wept unceasingly.
Just 58 minutes later I received the following telegram:
“David gone. Come immediately. Mrs. N. R. Westfall.”
Then I decreed that “in the name of God and all the Masters
of Light, David would either walk out of that undertaking estab­
lishment or he would ascend and become an Ascended Master.”
I knew that my prayer had reached the Great Cosmic Center.
Being without funds I wondered how I would even get back
to Eureka. Mr. Lanning had gone to attend a conclave in Oak­
land. Elsie said she would help me. Grief-stricken as I was,
knowing that my wife would be in a terrible state of mind, I
went to a broker’s loan shop and borrowed fourteen dollars on
my gold watch and chain, and left as soon as I could by stage
for San Francisco. While waiting at the station for the out­
going bus at San Francisco, I sent a telegram to Mr. Ballard
who was then starting a class in Oakland, telling him of the
tragedy in our family, and asked him to call for David’s ascen-
4
THE N E W G OL DE N AGE
sion. In addition to other things I had added to the message
telegraphed that “I always called David ‘My Angel Boy’.” The
other wording of the telegram I do not recall.
Having boarded the bus and on my way toward Eureka
again, I wondered how David had been injured. Had he been
run over by an automobile, or just how had he been taken from
us? Many such questions went through my mind. A news boy
came through the bus selling papers at Willits, almost half way
to Eureka from San Francisco. I dared not buy a newspaper.
I did not feel strong enough to face the truth. Finally someone
left a newpaper in a seat opposite me. I did muster up courage
enough to pick up that paper and read it. On the front page was
the story, how little David Westfall, age six years, had somehow
gotten his hands in the wringer of a powerful electric washer,
both arms were pulled into it and he was strangled to death.
His mother had found him hanging in the wringer a few minutes
later, but all efforts to bring him back to life failed when he was
taken to the hospital.
When I arrived in Eureka Mrs. Westfall was 12 miles out
in the country near Trinidad, unconscious, and not expected to
live. She had collapsed after sending me the second telegram.
She had known David was gone when she first telegraphed, but
feared my hearing of his death without previous warning might
be fatal to me. As soon as I had made necessary arrangements
with the mortuary, and prayed beside the body of David for some
time alone, I was taken to the bedside of my wife. She was in a
critical state. I was able to rouse her to consciousness, but imme­
diately she would swoon again, saying, “I don’t want to live. I
killed him, I killed him. I’m to blame.” She felt responsible for
the accident because she had either left the washer where he could
get to it or had probably absent-mindedly left it running when
she went down to the hotel we owned in Eureka. David had gone
ahead of his mother on the return home with his little sister,
Anne. She had stopped in to play with a playmate in the neigh­
borhood. David had gone on to the house with another little
boy. A neighbor later saw the other boy run from the house.
When the mother arrived at the house she found David hanging
in the washer, lifeless. She in her critical state could not, when
in the hospital later, get that picture out of her mind.
On the night of August 13 Mrs. Westfall was taken to the
hospital. She gradually became stronger, and on the 14th I
showed her a telegram I had received from Mr. and Mrs. Bal-
5
LORD M A I T R E Y A
lard, as follows: “Norman R. Westfall. Call being made. Will
let you know as soon as any definite word is given. Limitless love
and blessing. Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Ballard.” Mrs. Westfall
was able to understand. It seemed to strengthen her to think
that the Ballards were interested in David.
The next day, August IS, we received at noon the following
telegram: “Mr. and Mrs. Norman R. Westfall, Central Hotel.
Last night Saint Germain verified that your son David made the
ascension. How we rejoice with you. Limitless love and bless­
ings. Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Ballard.”
When I read the above telegram to my wife she definitely
began to revive. At last she began to realize that although
David was gone, he was immortal and had attained what was
intended in this life.
August 18, we received the following letter from Mr. and
Mrs. Ballard, typed on Hotel Claremont stationery, Berkeley,
Calif.:
M r. and Mrs. Norman R. W estfall August 18, 1939.
Central Hotel
Eureka, Calif.
Blessed Students of the Light :
Confirming our telegram to you of August 15th, Saint Germain gave
us the definite information that your son David made the Ascension under
the New Dispensation, instead of going through the changes ordinarily
accompanying so-called death.
So far as we understand, this is the beginning of the Ascension of chil­
dren under the new dispensation.
W e call to the “Mighty I A M Presence” of each one of you to charge
you with Ascended Master Discrimination, Self-control and Courage that
you may accept the Full Blessing of this magnificent privilege and be deter­
mined in your refusal to allow it to arouse within you any human feeling
of self-esteem, which would of course deprive you of the great benefit you
might otherwise receive. Nothing could be more harmful than to allow
the human to take credit in any way for such a Miracle of Divine Compas­
sion and Assistance.
W ith Limitless Love and Blessings,
Yours in the Service of the Light,
(Signed) M R. AND M RS. G. W . BALLARD.

THE N E W GOL DE N AGE
Slowly Mrs. Westfall mended, and with good care she was
able, after fifteen days, to leave the hospital, and again resume
her studies at Humboldt State College at Areata, where she had
been attending school in an endeavor to get a scholastic degree
with the intention of teaching in the public schools. She had
taught school in Kansas City prior to our marriage, having been
art teacher there.
The many letters we received from various students of the
“I AM” movement regarding the ascension of David were
encouraging to Dorothy, my wife, to try to forget the tragic
episode of her life, but she could not forget it. Many times I
would come upon her weeping; frequently she would awaken me
in the night sobbing, that picture of his frightful passing hover­
ing over her like a threatening shadow.
It is impossible to publish all the letters received regarding
David’s ascension, but for reasons efficacious to the future wel­
fare of sincere students of the profound principles taught by the
Ascended Masters, I include the few following letters herewith:

Eureka, Calif.
Beloved Friend:
The reason you have not been answered before is because Charles wanted
to write to you himself. But you know without my telling you how almost
impossible it is for him to get time even to dictate a letter and now I have
made up my mind to wait no longer as through talking to him I know what
he would like to say to you, so please accept this as from both of us.
W e both thank you a million times for that very beautiful picture of
precious David, as well as the smaller pictures. How thoughtful and sweet
and kind of you to send them to us.
How blessed you are! How glorious to be able to know that your
precious child has made his Ascension. I know what that must mean to you
and your precious wife. Of course we know that this knowledge of His
release into the Ascended State must have taken away all sorrow that you
would otherwise have had at His passing for you know of course that He
is with you all the time and then, what assistance He can be to you, your
dear wife and the other children. Surely it is glorious beyond the power of
words to express.

LORD M A I T R E Y A
When you look at that radiant smile, you can very easily understand
His Ascension. It is evident to me that He was brought back in this embodi­
ment just so He could make His Ascension quickly, having earned it in His
last embodiment.
Thank you so much for your wonderful letter, for the description of
this beautiful child and of your dream.
How amazing that almost from the beginning He was singing the
“I A M ”— proof positive beyond a doubt that He came in prepared for the
glorious event and you should feel yourselves blessed beyond most people
that He was loaned to you for so long a time and surely through His influ­
ence you are all sealed in the Light of God that never fails!
W e rejoice with you beyond the power of words to express.
Yes, you are right. Little Anne does remind one of Mrs. Ballard.
W ith all our love we enfold you, your precious wife and your beloved
children and shall always be glad to hear from you and see you when you
are in our city for now more and more we realize the absolute oneness of
the entire student-body and that which effects one effects all. Therefore, as
“One” we are striving together reaching upward together and may we all
make our Ascension together very very shortly.
Ever lovingly and sincerely yours,
In the service of the Light,

The magical radiance from the pictures I sent of David to a
few friends of mine is evidenced in the following letter I received
from a friend in Victoria, B. C .:
476 Constance Ave.
Victoria, B. C.
Oct. 9, 1939.
Dear M r. W estfall:
May God, the “Mighty I A M Presence” bless you FOREVER for
sending me the picture of your precious Son, the Ascended Master David
W estfall! W ith all the sincerity of my heart I thank you for it and for
your kindly letter.
Words fail to express the wonderful blessing that came with the picture.
I shall ever treasure it as one of my dearest possessions. As I held it in my
hand and read your letter the most glorious feeling of PEACE just flooded
my being. A ll I could do was just love, love, LOVE and bless Him and
ask Him to pour out His limitless Ascended Master blessing upon you
and his dear, dear mother, until you too make YO UR Ascension.

THE N E W GOL DE N AGE
David’s ascension has made me comprehend and FEEL so much more
fully the truth of Jesus’ words: “I, even I, if I be lifted up, shall draw all
men unto me.” I feel, or He has enabled me to feel, some of the GLORY
of His Ascension. Now can you see why I am so sincerely grateful to you
— because to FEEL that Glory, even for a moment, is a fore-taste of
Heaven—of one’s own freedom and Victory. Oh, I do thank you with
all my heart!
How wonderfully privileged we are to be a part of this activity! I
just ask the Presence to house-clean this old human so I can pour forth
ALL the love and gratitude my heart longs to do.
Looking at that sweet child-face with such pure joy shining through
it does something to me that I can’t explain. But again I call forth the
Eternal blessings of Light upon you and dear Mrs. Westfall. May the
great Joy, Peace and Divine Understanding of your precious Son enfold
you and all your dear ones until the moment of your Ascension.
M y deepest gratitude forever,
Your sincere friend in the Light,
(Signed) PEG G Y M ANNETTE.

The announcement of David’s ascension was made through
the Messenger Guy W. Ballard in the presence of about three
thousand students at the convocation in San Francisco. The fol­
lowing letter was received from my dear friend, Frank Lanning,
who was present:
San Francisco, Cal.
Aug. 14, 1939.
Dear Norman and Mrs. W estfall:
Saint Germain announced through our Beloved M r. Ballard at the
meeting this evening that your Boy has gained his Eternal Freedom in
his Ascension. W e rejoice with you.
FRAN K LANNING.
P.S.—A Transcendent Class is this one.

Yes, friends of Truth, of Light, Love, Wisdom and Power,
I do have a motive in publishing this book, and that motive is
not selfish. I received my Freedom, passed through the Cruci­
fixion, Resurrection and Ascended unto my Cosmic Father June
4, 1941, and I am here to tell about it. One motive in publishing
these matters is to let the world know that one does not have to
die to ascend.
9
LORD M A I T R E Y A
Even if I did not have a true motive myself in the publishing
of these facts, the Ascended Masters themselves have asked me
to publish them and PUBLISH THEM WITHOUT RESER­
VATIONS. Saint Germain is more eager for me to publish them
than anybody else. Why shouldn’t he? He and all the Ascended
Masters have been so outlandishly misrepresented, certainly
someone should come forth and explain to the hungry world the
higher laws that the Masters want explained.
It is most evident to the Masters who know and understand
the higher laws of the Cosmos, that there is no one shown up
yet who can lead the people out of the darkness in which they
find themselves. Since Mr. Ballard passed the last of December,
1939, no discourses have come through to his followers. Not
even the most meagre message was published in the official maga­
zine of the organization from Saint Germain. September 2, 1940,
I was asked by Root Hoomi to write to Mrs. Ballard in reference
to the Ascended Masters. Following is an excerpt from the
letter I wrote her at that time:
“You called to M t. Shasta recently, so this Master told me, for some
Master to come and speak from ‘the platform’ to your students. Should
such a Master come—would you be able to recognize Him? Please do
not judge others. The masters—yes, THE M ASTERS— are much closer
to you than you may realize, possibly. However I do not wish to judge you.
“REMEMBER I have written you in the past, ‘if you ever need
assistance please do not hesitate to call me.’ It was Master Katumah’s desire
that I write you. Following the ascension of my son David, I had much
to do with the ‘passing’ of your husband, Guy W . Ballard, and there
are certain ‘connections from the past’ that must be balanced. Please
believe THE M ASTERS whom I have contacted but during the past
week— even the Lord (CH RIST) Maitreya—whose loving embrace I
am not worthy to claim (yet He embraced me)— do not believe me for
myself, but TH EM , and K N O W they are with you, but I A M He who
would protect you.
“Lovingly,
“NORMAN R. W E ST FALL.”
* * *
I received no answer to a number of letters in which I offered
to assist Mrs. Ballard. As late as October 8 and 9, 1941, I called
her secretary, seeking an interview with Mrs. Ballard, but was
refused. Saint Germain had told me to undertake to assist her
once more.

CHAPTER II
Love is the ruling principle of all Ascended Masters. When
Love no longer reigns in the heart of a student of light, you may
know that student will somehow turn on the “left-hand” path­
way. Love—Divine Love—is the balancing power. It is easy
for the Initiate to determine who are of the Light and those who
are “Brothers of the Shadow.” The “fruit” of each is readily
classified by He who KNOWS. None can hide from the “Eye
of Houri,” the “All-Seeing Eye” of the Master. The Master
does not go about looking for evil, but He knows that where
Light is not radiating, darkness accumulates and the works of
Satan thrive.
“Where your treasure is, there your heart is also,” as Jesus
said, or vice versa, “Where your heart is, there your treasure is
also.” It is not difficult to tell what, of all the things of this
world, one chooses. What you choose determines your heart’s
desire. Generally speaking, those who choose worldly things—
money, fine homes, beautiful garments, jewelry, great real estate
holdings, etc.,—are not people who seek the simple truths the
Masters teach. There are exceptions to all rules! There are
today many great industrialists whose holdings might be worth
billions of dollars, yet they are little wrapped up in earthly pos­
sessions. Their heart is more in doing things that will enable
human beings to work at honest labor and better themselves,
than it is in possessing world wealth. Henry Ford is an example.
He, to my knowledge, for many years has been an exponent of
the Theosophical teachings of the Great Masters. Henry Ford,
personally, is a very plain man, ever expressing the higher princi­
ples of Light and Love; always seeking to better man’s sphere
of activity here on earth, and he is fearless in endeavoring to do
what he thinks best, irrespective of what public opinion may
be about it. Love, Wisdom and Power—in the Light—must be
balanced in an individual before he can attain mastery. Power
without either Love or Wisdom is invariably destructive.
Seldom in the many years I have been under the direction of
the Masters, even during the greatest of trials, was love unseated
from my heart. Ten days before David was taken away, while I
11
LORD M A I T R E Y A
was bending every possible effort toward seeing and talking to
Mr. Ballard, I had an impressive vision or dream. At the time
I thought some great being such as the President of the United
States was passing; however, I recalled, after David was gone,
that a casket clearly seen in the vision was a child’s casket. This
convinced me then that the Great Being passing over the Great
Divide was David. A few days before I left Eureka for Los An­
geles David had asked me when we were alone in the lobby of the
hotel, “Daddy, if I was to ascend, would I be able to come back
and see Anne?” He meant his sister, two years older than he,
whom he loved so very much. I replied, “Yes, David, I think you
would be able to come back and see her, but I am not sure that
she would be able to see you.” My answer seemed to satisfy
him and he asked me no more about it, but little did I think that
he would be ascending so soon. His own Soul-Presence knew,
of course, that he was soon to ascend. He was as matter-of-fact
about it as any grown-up might be.
I was in Los Angeles a part of June, all of July and up to the
12th of August (the time of David’s passing). Just a few days
before the accident David was visiting his dear old friend, Mary
Todd, who lived in an apartment at our hotel on the third floor.
She was a student of the “I AM” principles and loved David
more, I think, than anyone in her own family. She told me later
how David, while deeply engrossed in some little thing he was
playing with on the floor, casually remarked, “No one under­
stands Anne and me.” Mrs. Todd, not believing that he could
have said what he did, asked, “What did you say, David?”
Again he emphatically replied, “No one understands Anne and
me.” “Well, I understand you, David,” she lovingly replied.
“No, no one understands Anne and me,” he determinedly
answered.
To convince you that children sometime, especially some of
our children of the New Age, are frequently controlled by
their own higher presence, or spirit, I am going to relate another
incident regarding David and his parents. In managing the hotel
in downtown Eureka we had arranged so that I slept at the
hotel most of the time instead of at our home, 2904 “F”
Street. One day I was home to see the family when Dorothy
and I got into quite an argument about something. One word
brought on another, as is often the case between man and wife,
until finally we were entirely too heated about the matter to suit
David who was nearby. He was upon a chair on his knees lean-
12
THE N E W GOL DE N AGE
ing over on the dining room table, toying with something in his
hand, saying nothing. In fact I had not noticed him near me.
Dorothy was out in the pantry washing dishes. I would say
something to her, then she would yell back at me. This went on
for some time. After a while there was a pause in the word-
battle. David leaned over closer to me, so that his mother
would not hear what he said, telling me in a half-whisper,
“Daddy, if you will stop talking, Mamma will stop.”
“David, my Angel Boy,” I said, “we will stop right now.”
And we did. He got down from his chair immediately and went
out into the yard to play. That little child had certainly called
me down in the most wonderful and loving manner I had ever
experienced. A few minutes later I told Dorothy about it. Con­
sequently we both enjoyed a good laugh about it all, after we
were through being ashamed of ourselves. “And a little child
shall lead them,” that wise quotation from the Bible, certainly
fit in well for that incident.
As I have previously stated to you, I experienced a prophetic
vision about ten days before David’s passing. I saw a large
harbor in which was a great tall flagpole upon which waved a
huge American flag. A rather large row boat came in to shore.
I assisted the uniformed sailor place a casket into the boat, then
got in with him and he started rowing the boat out toward a large
ship. In referring to the occasion I spoke to the sailor, calling
him Captain. He replied, “I am not a Captain, I am a coxswain.”
As we rowed the boat near to the large ship, cannons were fired,
which I knew to be in honor of the one passing over the Great
Divide. For that reason I had, after I awakened from the vision,
thought the President of the United States or some great per­
sonage such as he was going to pass on. But later, after David
passed, the fact that it was a small casket convinced me that all
the grand arrangements were made for his passing, on the inner
planes of life, and I knew that it meant he was a great soul to
have received such particular attention. This, I might say here,
was all proved to me later when I was able myself to visit him
in the higher planes of life where he is a Buddha Lord in
Nirvana.
Among the children of today we find many re-embodying
who definitely belong to the New Golden Age now dawning.
Those of us who are able to analyze them learn much of the
transcendental laws of life which are to be brought through and
manifest among this New Super-Race. David was the youngest of
13
LORD M A I T R E Y A
our five children. We have three other boys and one girl. I even
was aware of the conception of our first child, a boy, who is now
fourteen years of age. I talked to him in the inner planes three
months before he was born. I knew then he was to be a teacher
of the New Age. I also saw our second child before he was
born, another boy who is now thirteen. Our third boy, now
eleven, I ascertained on the inner planes, was a German aviator
during the World War. It was when he was just a few weeks of
age that I held him on my knee, bouncing him up, talking to him
and questioning him. I talked to him just as if he understood
every word I said, and judging from what took place later, I
might be safe in saying he did understand me most thoroughly,
although he could not explain what he wanted to tell me, since
his physical vehicle was American and he could only talk German,
and too, he had not even trained his tongue to speak that. I
bounced him about, laughing and talking to him. I recall I said,
“Where did you come from, little angel boy?” He would grin
and say “G-o-o-o.” “Just where did you come from, anyway?”
I questioned over and over several times, looking him straight
in the eyes. I visualized deeply into his eyes, actually wondering
where that little soul had come from, and all he could say was
a broad grin and some meaningless “G-o-o-o’s.”
But I have something more to tell you about that little fellow.
I craved so deeply to know where that soul had hailed from that
my own higher self made a thorough investigation a night later.
I had a marvelous soul-experience. I suddenly found myself over
the French-German trenches during the World War. My atten­
tion was centered on two airplanes in a “dog-fight” thousands
of feet above the lines. One was a German, the other French.
They soared about, dodging, leveling shots at each other, see­
sawing back and forth for some time, and then suddenly I noticed
the German plane was crippled. The pilot could glide the plane,
but the engine was out of commission. He was at such high alti­
tude, and being a good glider, took off over Germany, directing
his plane at a swift downward angle. I, in consciousness, went
right along with the plane, watching it to see where it went.
When the pilot had evaded his enemy by quick maneuvering, he
cautiously took to gliding more easily and slowly. This continued
for several minutes, when I saw the plane suddenly take a dive
for the backyard of a beautiful German farmhome. It fell right
in the backyard, bursting into flames. A rather large, kindly-
faced German woman came to the back door and walked out on
14
THE N E W GOLDEN AGE-
the porch. The aviator staggered from the flaming plane. I
rushed forward and started to throw my arms around him. I
looked into his eyes. They were the same eyes of the little soul
I had questioned, “Where did YOU come from?” The woman
who came out on the back porch was his German mother. This
I knew in my consciousness just as surely as if any physical person
had told me. The young man was about 22 years of age, I should
judge. He died as the result of the crack-up and flames. He had
re-incarnated in our family. Time in the spiritual plane is beyond
understanding in our outer consciousness, but I, in my own inner
being, was able to go there and see all of that in the akashic or
etheric records. When little Edward (that is his name) got to
be old enough to talk, he definitely talked with a German accent,
and, strange though it may seem, he would eat sauerkraut and
different German foods the other children would not touch. We
frequently referred to him as our “Little Dutchman” of the
family.
Here is an instance where I was able in my ascended body to
trace and record those etheric records with such precision and
so impressionably that I could bring it all back to my physical or
outer consciousness. The eyes have been frequently referred to
by writers and poets as the “windows of the soul.” This proved
to be true in this case. You will find that when you meet your
friends and relatives in the spiritual planes, their bodies may
appear differently but invariably their eyes are the same, for
truly the “eyes are the etheric expression of the soul,” as well as
they may be simply considered the “windows of the soul.” The
eyes of a corpse do not have that same spiritual expression.
This we know without contradiction.
Another principle brought out in that etheric experience is
the fact that an intense desire or love of something will attract
you to it, even in consciousness, if for some reason you are not
able to go to it in the physical plane or octave of life. Where your
heart is there your treasure is, as Jesus is said to have stated.
It was my keen desire to know where Edward had lived before
he came to my wife and me to live. I knew that we all live before
we come to this world. It is just as logical that we lived before
we came here as it is that we live after we leave here. The fact
is we live eternally. You will one day find that the physical world
is but a “side-issue” so to speak, of life. If for some reason or.
other we happen to lose our physical body, it is quite natural for
us to pick up another. We are not complete without it. We live
15
LORD M A I T R E Y A
and enjoy other realms and worlds simultaneously while living in
this realm. The principal trouble with most of us is that “we are
not all here.” As Saint Germain, my higher presence, said the
other day, “We are all one small body wee, but we are not all
up to par.” The idea is to bring through to this plane our entire,
complete and fully illuminated being—our WHOLE SELF.
The WHOLE (HOLY) SPIRIT, the ONENESS OF ALL
LIFE, IS GOD ALMIGHTY. We have lived hundreds of
times on earth. Each time we build a definite individual spirit
with characteristics corresponding to that embodiment. To
become fully illuminated we must get all those spirits lined up in
a direct channel to GOD, the CENTRAL SUN of all Life. We
must get all side-tracks directed toward the MAIN-LINE, and
that Main-Line becomes the direct radii to the God-Head, the
ALL-FATHER and ALL-MOTHER OF ALL. Your Spiritual
Tree has within it every individual spirit you have accumulated
since you were first projected into the earth realm from God.
This Tree of Life is sometimes alluded to in occult or meta­
physical circles as the “Sky-Tree.” There is some allusion made
to it in the Bible, where it is described as a tree with its “roots
in heaven and its branches reaching down to earth.” Jesus re­
ferred to it when he said, “I AM the vine and ye are the
branches.” You might think of yourself, your real HIGHER
PRESENCE, as being the trunk of your “Life Tree,” and your
various embodiments are the branches and twigs and leaves. It
is the ONENESS of life symbolized in a green living tree that
we must understand and utilize if we are to know CHRIST and
the FATHER-MOTHER GOD. Love is the ruling principle
of mastership. Wisdom and Power are of little eternal and
beneficent value without LOVE.
16
CH APTER III
The first of January, 1941, I sold the hotel at Eureka, and
had a few days previously encouraged Mrs. Westfall to attend
the “I AM” convocation in Los Angeles, she having taken the
two younger children with her. I went to Los Angeles after the
transaction regarding the selling of the hotel was completed,
arriving there about the 3rd of January. I found Dorothy in
bed sick and unable to attend the classes being held at the Shrine
Auditorium. While in the city I gave a brief talk at the Sindelar
Studio regarding the ascension of David. Following my talk
many of the people in the audience wept, my relating little inci­
dents about Him having touched their hearts, for I so loved Him
myself I could not talk about Him without radiating His great
Love. While talking on the rostrum there, it seemed I was being
bathed in a great stream of liquid light.
Within a few days Dorothy was able to return to Eureka.
We moved to Areata, nine miles north of Eureka to be near
Humboldt State College, where Dorothy was determined to con­
tinue her studies in the second semester then starting. She at­
tended during January and February, but by the end of February
was so nervous and irritable from trying to keep house, going to
school during the day and studying at night that I feared she
would have a nervous break-down. I encouraged her to stop
school and take a trip to Oklahoma to visit her mother and
brother. She finally agreed to this. She agreed to take the two
younger children with her and I was to take the two older boys
with me.
It was during February that I was prompted through a strong
inner urge to go to Mt. Shasta. I also had a vision in which I
met a feminine being who called herself “Maria.” I was walking
along a lonely road. A dove came fluttering about in front of me.
It seemed to disappear up my sleeve, so I thought, but then,
suddenly, there appeared a feminine being right in front of me
in a pink flowing garment. I exclaimed as I approached her,
throwing my arms around her, “I have not seen you for a thou­
sand years.” There was a joy about the meeting I had never
experienced before. I began to weep for joy. She rather sternly
17
LORD M A I T R E Y A
remarked, “This is no time for weeping; you must go to the
assistance of Castro.” Immediately I braced up, took a sheet of
paper (from where I got the paper I do not know), hurriedly
wrote a note on the paper and she disappeared as quickly as she
had appeared. While this was going on I seemed to be conscious
of possessing greater powers in higher realms of being, and, as
was indicated by her, the message I wrote on the paper set a
certain being free in a higher plane of life. When I became con­
scious in the outer octave I could not think of anybody I had
ever been close to in this life by the name of “Maria.” It was
not until the following August that I found who Maria was. She
was Mary the Mother of Jesus, and I met her in a human physi­
cal body at Mt. Shasta. That is where my most intensive study
and instruction actually began.
While my wife was in Oklahoma City I founded a weekly
newspaper at Etna, California, Siskiyou County, about thirty
miles from Mt. Shasta. The newspaper was known as the Scott
Valley Beacon. While on a business trip to Redding, California,
on the 29th of August, 1940, I stopped off in Mt. Shasta to see
if I could find the author of an article I had read in another
paper regarding a Great Master who had been seen to walk
forth out of the mountain there. There was certain symbolism
referred to in the article that led me to think there was a hidden
message within it. I found the author of the article, or instead,
I might say, the author found me, for she had been told by a
spiritual messenger that I was down on the street in Mt. Shasta
and wanted to see her. She was told that it was most urgent for
us to meet. She appeared in front of the newspaper office the
instant I inquired there. I asked her if she might sit in my car
at the side of the street and talk to me regarding the “Mt. Shasta
story.” She did. We soon discovered we had much in common.
It was as though two old friends had met for the first time in
many years. I was hesitant in asking her to accompany me on
the business trip to Redding, however, I did, and when I asked
her she replied, “Yes, I shall. I have nothing urgent to do this
afternoon.” I had made an appointment with a man in Redding
for 2 :30 that afternoon and was behind time then, so I was
extremely happy to have the lady accompany me.
Yes, that lady turned out to be Mary the Mother of Jesus,
but I was not informed of this that day. She went with me to
Redding, sat in the car until I finished my business interview with
a man there, then we returned to Mt. Shasta. We talked of the
18
THE N E W GOL DE N AGE
mysteries of life constantly during the entire trip going and
returning. Little did I realize what that trip meant to me. I
realized she was a very enlightened woman, but I did not know
that she was the first of the Ascended Masters I was to meet and
receive through them the highest possible initiations obtainable
on earth through the Great Brotherhoods.
It was less than a week later that I called to see the Mystery
Woman, seeking more Light and instruction regarding the Great
Mysteries. She was happy to see me. I was amazed to find that
she knew all about what I had been doing the past week, even
before I told her anything about it. She also told me of certain
things that were going to take place in my life. She explained
that she had looked into my life-stream, and it did not take her
long to convince me that she knew far more about me than I
knew about myself. For instance, she explained that the day she
had been told to go down town to meet me she had been informed
by the Ascended Master messenger that she should hurry. “There
is a man down on the street who wishes to see you,” he said, “and
it is very important for you to see him. He is somebody I love
very much. He is Abraham Lincoln.”
Now this may seem queer, for I had never seen that lady
before in my life, let alone tell her anything of my own convic­
tion that I had been Abraham Lincoln in a previous embodiment,
but Ave Maria, as she was wont to call herself, could, I later
found, very easily look into your life-stream or “Sky Tree” and
tell you much about yourself in your numerous embodiments,
clear back, as she said, “when you had funny-shaped faces in
very ancient days in the far-distant past.” While sitting talking
to her I was frequently astonished, when I first began to get
acquainted with her, to have her address beings about her who
were entirely invisible to me. Those she usually addressed were
Koot Hoomi, Jesus, Saint Germain, Archangel Michael, Lord
Maitreya, Master Morya and Buddha Gautama. Others she
less frequently talked to were Master Hilarión, Serapis (The
Egyptian Lord), Anoma of Venus and others whom I do not
recall.
I wish to inform you now that Ave Maria does have another
name by which she is known in the outer world. Those of you
who are familiar with the ways of the Masters know, of course,
that they are the most reticent people in the world. They are such
perfect actors, so to speak, that you, unless you are “one of them,”
can no more distinguish one of them from ordinary people than
19
LORD M A I T R E Y A
you can fly. I have met several of them in their natural bodies,
in bodies of others, disembodied, in visions, dreams, and under all
kinds of conditions and circumstances. There is no telling where
or how you are liable to meet an Ascended Master. Their great­
est interest is lifting humanity into higher and higher planes of
consciousness to enable us to establish the Brotherhood of God
among the human beings on this earth. They take advantage of
every opportunity to do this. The manner in which I met Ave
Maria is an example of how one might meet an Ascended Master.
For many many years I watched every possible means by which
I might catch a glimpse of some new angle of the Truth that I
knew to come from the Masters, the Lords, the Gods, the Sons
of Almighty God. It was simply through seeing in one small
newspaper article a certain revelation symbolized, that I was
inadvertently led to one of the greatest Masters of this world—
Ave Maria, the Mother of Jesus.
l ou, seekers after Truth, I must pause for a brief moment
to tell how I feel regarding the Masters and their Great Work.
It was with hesitancy that I could come forth into the world,
telling you of the things I now relate. ’Twas but a few days
ago that I was told by the Great Mahatma Koot Hoomi of
Shigatse, Tibet, that I was chosen by the Great White Brother­
hood, and the Council of the Great White Lodge as the “Chief-
Avatar” of the New Golden Age. For several months I had
known from indistinct and intuitive revelations from the inner
planes of life that I was to carry a sensational message to the
outer world from the Great Council, but I dared not think of
myself as the “Chosen One” to lead mankind out of darkness.
True, I had been conscious of the crucifixion in my etheric body,
of the resurrection and the final ascension, when I ascended into
the Great Cosmic Center of Life, and felt and experienced the
ONENESS WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT, but I knew there
were many others who had been through the same experience.
Most of those I was associated with, those who had taught me
and trained me, were, from all I knew regarding them, older
and wiser than I. Why should I be chosen? I asked Koot Hoomi
about this. It was my Divine Inheritance, he explained. Not
what I have done in this life alone, but what I have done for
humanity in my endeavor to free them down through the ages.
He stated that I had been faithful to God for thousands of years,
that my faith had been unrelenting, that I had for ages struggled
to enlighten my less-informed brothers of the race. In my many
20
THE N E W GOLDEN A GE
embodiments, one of which was Lincoln, another Saint Germain,
another Shakespeare and John, the Brother of Jesus, I had ever
striven to awaken humanity to the Truths of Goodness and the
Love, Wisdom and Power of Almighty God. The accumulation
in my^ Sky Tree” Mahatma Koot Hoomi considered my Divine
Inheritance. Blessed Koot Hoomi and the other Ascended Mas­
ters of the Great Council have asked me to relate the numerous
incidents that have taken place in my life the past year, during
the time that I received matchless instruction and training from
the Ascended Masters, and they insist that I do it “without
reservation.”
Now, friends, I wish you to know, definitely, that I do not
relate these matters for the purpose of putting myself forward,
and I wish it clearly understood that whatever I have received
from the Masters is all possible for you to contact and receive.
It has been planned by the Great White Lodge that I do this in
the manner I am doing it. They have good reasons for having
me do it this way. The time has come when the “Truth, the
Whole Truth and nothing but the Truth” is to be revealed to
struggling mankind. Who will dare stop it? The Great Coun­
cil has so decreed it. This is the time when ALL LIGHTS
MUST UNITE UNDER THE ONE GREAT LIGHT. This
is the time when all churches, all clubs, all societies, all industrial
organizations and all brotherhoods of this world must come
together under that ONE GREAT LIGHT. This is the last
call to the “Brothers of the Shadow.” Those who do not take
heed to this pronouncement of Truth and Light “shall be cast
out into utter darkness.” This is the closing of a manvantara
(cycle), and at its completion only the Children of Light shall
remain on this earth. We of the Light now hold the balance of
power. Love in all its kindly and brotherly aspects shall mani­
fest. “Thy Kingdom, Oh Lord, shall be established on earth.”
The Golden Age is now dawning.
Those of the “shadow,” who plan on the empiric control of
all human life on this planet, shall now find that the Brothers of
Light are numerous throughout the world. This is the first time
in thousands and thousands of years that the Gods of Light hold
the balance of Power. Those who know and understand the
Great Work of the Ascended Masters see clearly, even in the
great war raging in Europe, that the Lords of Love, Wisdom
and Power in the Light of Christ do rule this world. Within the
next year, 1942, you will see swift-moving changes in the climax
21
LORD M A I T R E Y A
in the world’s massive stage of activity. The Light of Christ is
now penetrating into every “nook and corner ’ on this old planet.
For thousands of years there has been a web of darkness woven
about this earth by the sinister forces of evil. Now, with the
dawning of the Golden Age, there is woven a Golden Net about
the whole planet. Its radiance envelops every person, place,
condition and thing in this world. From the center of the earth,
invisible to the average person, radiates forth, under the direc­
tion of the Ascended Masters and the Great Lords of the Rays,
luminous electronic light-substance that now comes forth to the
periphery of the planet, making of it a great luminous Sun, dis­
solving all darkness. This planet is no longer a Dark Star as it
was in the past. It has now become a Golden Blazing Sun. All
darkness and every “shadowy” being shall be driven out, for
they cannot withstand the True Light of Christ. Yes, there are
literally millions who claim they know Christ and they call them­
selves Christians, but the LIGHT OF GOD will prove them to
be what THEY ARE. None can hide their dark faces from
the Son of God. There are no dark places where they may hide.
The dark crypts and dungeons, their damp and musty cathedrals
and walled enclosures shall be swept clean by the Light of Christ.
The Seven Rays of the Lords of Light, and the New Eighth
and Ninth Rays, with their overpowering Light, are now sweep­
ing east and west, north and south, around and about this earth,
cleansing, purifying, dissolving everything that is not of the
Light of God. Christ Lord Maitreya, the same Great Being who
came forth to teach Jesus centuries ago, is my Master-Teacher
today. In His Name, in His Light, by the Word from His Mouth,
I go forth into the outer world, calling all those who would seek
Him. “I am the open door that no man can shut.” I am the
Chosen One of the Great Brotherhood. I am asked to bring the
East and the West together. Krishna, Christ, Buddha, Brahma,
all Sons of the One Almighty God, do call all peoples of this
world to COME UNDER THE ONE GREAT LIGHT.

CHAPTER IV
The few times I was able to visit my new-found Master-
Teacher at Mt. Shasta during the month of September, 1940,
were like visiting a Goddess on a distant star. It was almost
enough to just sit in Her presence and drink in the Liquid Light
from Her radiance. But there was instruction given. Through
Her marvelous teaching I began to see the Light beyond the
shadows that had seemed to enfold me for a number of years
hindering me from expressing the great truths I knew to reside
within my heart. I told my wife of my meeting and the instruc­
tions I was getting. Yes, she was jealous. At one time during
the month when I spoke to her of “the lady at Mt. Shasta,” she
flew into a rage, and for a few minutes the radiations of jealousy
from her mind were terrific. Whenever Dorothy got into a bad
state of mind, such as she did frequently, I would never leave
her alone until I had somehow brought about peace in her mind.
I would talk to her, plead with her, and try in every way I could
to bring about peaceful understanding between us before I dared
leave home for the office. Under the stress and strain we had
to live in for a number of years following the financial crash in
1929, with a large family of five children, all of whom had been
born during the short period of seven years, Dorothy was not
strong. She worried more about money matters than anything.
She was an ideal mother to her children. Their physical and
educational welfare was always uppermost in her mind. There
never was an evening until the time of Little David’s passing that
she did not gather the children about her before bedtime and read
stories to them, explaining, answering questions, and impressing
the higher principles of life upon their impressionable little
minds. She was an ideal teacher and a loving mother; however,
the heavy trials under which we were both placed, tried her so
very much that she became nervous and extremely irritable. For
this reason I never once in my life blamed her for any tantrums
she brought on herself. Even though I might have lost my tem­
per a number of times, invariably our quarrels were followed by
peace-making on my part. Dorothy was extremely stubborn,
which is a good quality if used in the right direction. If there
23
LORD MAITREYA
were any peace-making to be done it was I who had to do it,
which I always did. She was a woman who hid her feelings and
emotions. I am one who expresses them openly. I am of the
nature to reveal all; to bring out into the open everything, for
I know within my heart that we can hide nothing. People who
try to hide certain characteristics they possess are apt to develop
deceit in their personal nature. The person who is open and
frank with you, providing, of course, he is honest, is one from
whom you may learn much. The true characteristics of the gods
are accumulated as we live and learn through the experiences of
the ages. We first came from God, yes, but we were THROW N
OUT, as it were, from the LIFE-CENTER through involution
INTO the primeval elements of EARTH—Earth, Water, Air
and Fire. Then we start on the journey BACK TO GOD, T H E
FATHER, through evolution. We thus evolve until we are
conscious of our own evolution, and then we start to develop.
When we become God-Conscious, we actually get right down to
“Our Father’s Business,” and try OUR UTM OST to become
LIKE H IM . And, my beloved friend, right then is when you
are liable to M EET AN ASCENDED MASTER. I DID.

On the evening of September 21, 1940, Dorothy, the chil­
dren and I had made preparations to go to the Siskiyou County
Fair at Yreka. On the.morning of the 22nd, however, Dorothy
24
THE NE W GOL DE N A GE
did not get up to get breakfast. This was most unusual for her.
I arose and got the breakfast ready for the children. Dorothy
had said she was not able to get up. As she had been complaining
considerable in recent days I did not think much about it.
While we were eating breakfast Dorothy came into the
kitchen, saying she was going to take an aspirin tablet. She felt
miserable, she said, and remarked that she was not going to the
fair, but would stay at home alone. I rather jokingly replied
that “Well, mother, we can have a good time without you,”
thinking, of course, that she really did not mean to stay at home.
She took, I believe, two aspirin tablets, and started back toward
the bedroom. My jovial manner didn’t set well with her. As she
walked through the room where I slept, through which she had
to pass from the kitchen to her room in the front of the house,
she sorrowfully remarked, “One of these days I’ll get a gun and
put an end to the whole thing.” She walked but a few steps
when she gave one shrieking scream and fell to the floor. I ran
into the room and undertook to pick her up. It seemed to me that
some power had hold of her twisting and shaking her body. I
half carried her to her bed. She could not talk. I knew she was
deathly sick. I yelled to my oldest son to run and tell Mr. Horn,
who lived near us, to phone for the doctor, for we lived at the
time two miles out from Etna, California, on the old Horn ranch.
Realizing the terrible condition Dorothy was in, I suddenly
was overcome with grief, put my arms around her, lay my head
upon her breast and wept bitterly. She could hear but could not
move. I knew it would not do for me to weaken, but that I must
brace up and do all I could. In a few minutes Mrs. Frank Horn
came. I was still crying. My pity for her, who was so moved
by the scene, caused me to straighten up, gather myself together
and face the trying ordeal, no matter how painful it may be.
The doctor arrived. He examined the patient, shook his head and
stated that there was nothing he could do but wait and see what
would happen. After waiting a few minutes Dr. Haynes decided
to go back to his office to get some medicine he needed. While he
was gone I felt stronger and undertook to heal Dorothy myself,
since I had healed her many many times in the past. This time,
however, the sudden stroke had so shocked me that I was not in
a state of mind to undertake healing her, but during the absence
of the doctor and the other people who had been in the room, I
drew the Aeth forces from the atmosphere and charged her body
with the healing light. She roused, moved her hands, and in a
25
LORD M A I T R E Y A
few minutes was able to sit up. We talked about different
things, and I tried to cheer her up. I told her that if anything
should happen that she was taken away I would take good care
of the children. I knew that was her greatest worry. I also
spoke to her regarding her statement she had made just before
she was stricken. “Dorothy,” I said, “let this be a lesson to both
of us. Let us try to be kind to each other always. We know better
than to say harsh things. We MUST be kind to each other,
Dorothy.” She agreed that we should do our best to help each
other to be good.
Soon the doctor returned. He was much surprised to see the
patient sitting up. He had by now made a thorough diagnosis of
the case, but did not state just what he understood the disease to
be. He left some medicine to take, and said it would be all right
for her to eat something should she care to. I fixed some tea and
toast for her but she merely sipped the tea once, refusing to eat
anything.
About two hours later another stroke came on Dorothy. I
was bending over her, she grabbed a pencil from my vest pocket
with her left hand. She wanted to write something. I quickly got
an envelope for her to write on, but by that time she could not
even use her left hand. Her right side had first become paralyzed.
She merely got the pencil in position to write, made an unintelli­
gible scribble and then sank back upon her pillow. We sent for
the doctor again. When he came he assisted us to place her in
his large car which was arranged with a stretcher in the back,
and we took her to the hospital at Yreka. Three physicians there
analyzed the case, one a specialist in similar attacks, but they
did not seem to know definitely what ailed her.
The specialist at the General Hospital at Yreka said Dorothy
was unconscious. I knew she was not. About the third day, while
talking to her I noticed her eyes moved. She could look up and
down, rolling her eyes. I told her to look up for “yes,” and down
for “no.” She immediately looked up and then down, proving to
me that she could hear and understand everything I said. When I
realized that she had heard the doctors and nurses talking about
how it was impossible for her to recover, and how dreadfully
sick she was, I shuddered. I asked her if she was in pain. She
answered with her eyes, “No.” From that time on until she
passed, 3 :00 A.M. September 30, I talked to her hours at a
time. I strengthened her spiritually so she could face the great
“passover.” I told her the Masters were with her to direct her
26
THE NE W G OL DE N AGE
on into the higher realms of light and love. I talked to her of
the children and their interests, and took them a time or two to
see their mother.
For nine days Dorothy was paralyzed, yet all that time, up
until just a few hours before her death she was fully conscious
of everything that went on about her. I knew that the Masters
were preparing her etheric body for her ultimate ascension. A
few hours after she passed she came to Ave Maria and me in Mt.
Shasta in spirit, telling us how happy she was, and remarked, “I
would not return for anything in the world.” Two weeks later
she informed us that she had a thousand students under her
instruction in the inner planes of consciousness. She also informed
us that we need not worry about her. “I am going right on up,”
she said.
The remains of Dorothy were cremated at Grants Pass, Ore.,
and on the Thursday following her passing, services were held in
the “I AM” Sanctuary in Eureka, where Mrs. Henrietta Airth
directed the last rites. David had previously been cremated at
Eureka. We, Ave Maria and I, took the ashes of both to the
8500-foot level of Mt. Shasta, where they were scattered in the
presence of the Ascended Masters. But while we were scattering
the ashes of the body of David he came in spirit, crying, and
told us to save some of the ashes for his sister, Anne, who he said
was his Twin Ray. I still have most of the ashes in a copper con­
tainer in which they had been kept at the Crematory in Eureka.
Later David appeared a number of times to his little sister in
Mt. Shasta where she stayed with Ave Maria for about a year.
During that year Anne was instructed by the Masters, actually
went through the crucifixion, resurrected and ascended at the same
time that another woman and myself ascended. We had been told
by Koot Hoomi previously that there were but four ascensions
to take place in the world at this time. This need not discourage
the thousands of people who have been misled into thinking that
all they had to do was to say a few decrees and they would ascend.
One’s ascension at this time or any other depends more upon
their “DIVINE INHERITANCE” than any other one thing.
If you have not “what it takes” in your own “SKY TREE” you
had better “go slow” or you are liable to dig up a few incorrigible
“spirits” in your own “Tree” that may not be to your liking.
The “Sky Tree” and the individual spirits of your life-stream
will be thoroughly explained and symbolized definitely in later
chapters of this book. This is the greatest mystery revealed to
27
LORD M A I T R E Y A
the outside world in this present age. Jesus might have under­
stood these things, I mean from the standpoint of explaining to
the uninitiated, but we have so much greater advantages today
than He had then to explain Christ to people. We have perfect
means of communication and the educational advantages the
world now possesses, along with the religious, scientific and phil­
osophical expansion in our present-day mass-intelligence, all shall
be utilized by the Great Masters and Lords of Wisdom to
disseminate the principles of Christ-Consciousness throughout
the entire world. The “DOOR” is actually now open, and all
who sincerely seek Christ, shall be permitted to be “crucified.”
How many are willing to follow “me.” Do you think I, Koot
Hoomi, Jesus, Morya, or any other being who ever went through
the crucifixion, resurrection and ascension, had an easy time of it?
How many times in the past have I been murdered, crucified,
shot, tomahawked, and dispatched in various other ways by the
ignorant “Brothers of the Shadow?” It is about time the whole
truth be revealed to the seekers of Christ and His Light. How
thankful I am that the forces of darkness are at last “wiped
out.” They will now KNOW there are thousands of us IN THE
LIGHT. They have no dark caverns in which to hide any more.
We and our True Brothers of Light have re-embodied again
and again until at last our message of Light, Love, Wisdom and
Power has “gone over” to the honest God-fearing people of this
world. This is the time when all churches of this world must
actually acknowledge Christ, learn of his Infinite Love and Intel­
ligence, Wisdom and Light, or they will become empty shells
in which the Light of Almighty God is not found. This is the
time when all divisions of God’s people shall be removed. All
must recognize the ONE GOD and come under the ONE
GREAT LIGHT. No longer can religion be used as a means
of livelihood for lazy wine-bibbers and loud Sunday-morning
chatter-boxes. The Greatest Church of all in the future will be
God’s Great Outdoors, with Nature, and the magnificent Snow-
Capped Mountains will be the Towering Cathedrals of His
Saints, the Lesser Mountains will ring with the joyous voices
of His worshippers, the Golden Sun in the Heavens will symbol­
ize the Son of Righteousness (Christ), and the twinkling Stars
in the Vaulted Skies, God’s candles, are the Lords and Masters
of His Infinite Love.
Yes, Brothers of Light, and you who may chance to be just
a little “shadowy” yet, I realize just how a great percentage
28
I
THE NE W GOL DE N AGE
of the people who read this “unheard-of” book will want to
crucify me again. I wish to inform you that it isn’t at all neces­
sary. I have learned my lessons in “physicality.” Do you realize
that jealousy is simply proof of one’s inferiority? Yes, this is
right. The only ones who might wish to crucify me again, in the
flesh, are those who are contemporaries of any “New Interpre­
tation of Christ” that might come into the outer world. There
are hundreds of thousands of priests and ministers of the gospel
as they see and understand it and as they have “sheep-like” been
taught by empiric leaders of orders, churches, so-called brother­
hoods and ecclesiastical regents-of-Christ, etc., who receive high
salaries, live in gorgeously furnished palaces, and have every­
thing their hearts desire, while their lowly followers live poorly
clothed, half-starved, misery-soaked and sorrowful lives. The
princes in palaces are the crucifiers, the hungered are the crucified.
Naturally the crucified will first resurrect, and those to resurrect
will be the first to ascend into His Glory—CHRIST. Oh, that
those in high places in the empiric world knew of Christ and His
Laws of Love, Wisdom and Light! How soon we might change
this world from a battlefield of hate into a paradise of Love
and Goodwill. ALL LIGHTS UNITED UNDER THE ONE
GREAT LIGHT.
Awake, seekers of Truth! Proclaim the laws of Light and
Love throughout the world. “Fear not. I am with you always.”
Have you, Blessed Friend, ever thought of why they actually
crucified Jesus on the Cross? Did it ever occur to you that it
was because he looked just like an ordinary person to ninety-nine
and nine tenths per cent of those who saw Him? Had they seen
Christ, the “SUN” within Him, you know they would not have
killed Him. You, Beloved, can never see Christ in me, until you
KNOW HIM in your own heart through LOVE.
29
CHAPTER V
In spite of all that had befallen me in the sickness and passing
of my wife, I did not miss editing and publishing a single issue
of the Scott Valley Beacon, a weekly newspaper in which I had
been able to publish bits of the Great Truth from time to time
that certainly pleased my loyal readers. One of the first Ascended
Masters to contact me after meeting Ave Maria was Master
Koot Hoomi, who is often referred to as Master KH. Almost
the first thing he spoke to me about was my little newspaper,
and he called me his “Beacon in the West” because of the flashes
of Light and Life I frequently published. I soon found that the
Great Masters certainly know if and when we do anything
which might be efficacious to the Great Work of bringing the
world into the Light of Christ.
During the month of October I visited Ave Maria, with
whom my little daughter lived, several times. Each time it seemed
the Light was expanding within me. When in her presence I was
so amazed with the wonderful instructions I received and the
radiance of Light about Her that I was almost dumbfounded,
however, I must admit, too, that it all seemed to be quite natural.
As I have often thought since, there definitely was an air of
nonchalance about me that even today I cannot explain. And
I do believe had I been anxious about the matter, I should never
have received the marvelous revelations I did.
It was along toward the last of October that I began to under­
stand the “modus operandi” of the Ascended Masters or Lords
of the Higher Worlds. When I did begin to understand I won­
dered why I had not known it all my life. And now I know
I did understand, but I was not able to “bring it through” to
my outer consciousness.
I must explain something to you that is vital to your future
instruction and training. Remember, My Beloved, it is your
understanding, intelligence and expansion of the Light within
you that I am interested in accomplishing above everything. It
is of utmost importance to the whole world that every individual
Life-Light expand, that we might lift this planet into a New
Radiance, the Golden Age.
30
THE NE W GOL DE N A GE
Here it is. “Ye who have ears to hear,” read closely what
I am about to tell you. The life in you that feels and knows
things is your individual “SPIRIT.” Some might call this the
soul. Others might think of it as the sub-conscious mind. A
mathematician or geometrician may refer to it as the fourth
dimensional intelligence; Mrs. Eddy calls it the Spiritual Mind;
Emerson spoke of it as the “Over-Soul;” and I could go on and
on, giving this elusive Life- and Intelligent-Substance different
names that have been placed upon it down through the ages, but
still it is the same principle — LIFE — LIGHT-LIFE — A
SPARK OF THE ALMIGHTY. I am reminded of a simple
analogy I frequently use. “If you have a yellow dog whose name
is Rover and you change his name to Sport, he still remains a
yellow dog. The name-changing didn’t change the dog at all,
in color nor in character.” Well, changing the name of Christ
to Buddha, Brahma, Krishna or any other name, doesn’t change
the Spirit of the Son of God. All the names that are given to the
Third Principle of the God-Head does not change God’s Laws
one whit. Father-Mother-Son is the Creative Principle—the
Triangle of the Godhead.
When you do chance to meet one Ascended Master—one
who has ascended in His Higher Body, is conscious of it in His
outer body, and knows He has an Immortal Body in Christ,
as I AM and have—through that ONE you can easily contact
any Master you might choose to meet. This I have proved con­
clusively to my own satisfaction, I know others who have proved
it to their own satisfaction, and for this very reason I was chosen
to relate these incidents, happenings, and means of revelation
and instruction to you. There have been a great number of men
and some women down through the ages who attained Christ-
hood, Sonship with God, and were able to bring it through to
their outer or physical senses, but there was not enough general
knowledge on the part of the masses of mankind to accept it.
In a sense no one is to blame. The evolution and expansion of
the mass-intelligence had to come about before this EN-LIGHT-
MENT could possibly take place. This is the time. Many of
us who are of the LIGHT and have been IN THE LIGHT
for centuries and centuries, knew the process of evolution,
development and Christ-consciousness had to take place through­
out the world, so to speak, before we as Sons of God can come
forth without being deliberately killed by the ignorant people
of the planet who were greatly in the majority. Thank God, at
31
LORD M A I T R E Y A
last, through the marvelous works of Science, along with Religion
and Philosophy, the human race now has gumption enough to
compare the meagre understanding of the masses at the time
of Jesus with the great intelligence of the average man of today.
Thank God that we do have religious freedom in the United
States, and I, John the Brother of Jesus who became the Christ,
can come forth and speak to you of the Christ Lord Maitreya,
the Solar Christ to this Universe, and not be again crucified as
I have been in the past. I thank God Almighty that our Blessed
Scientists are at last proving, through the Electron, the Radio,
the study of the Stars, and the many revealing facts of chemistry,
that there is a Mighty Intelligence running this Universe. Study
that ONE LIFE, Brother, if you would understand God and
become HIS SON—Christ Incarnate. There is but ONE LIFE,
ONE WISDOM, ONE LOVE, ONE POWER. There are not
two wisdoms. How could there be? Remember, as Pythagoras
said hundreds of years ago, “All life hinges around the numeral
ONE,” in other words. I might inform you that Master Koot
Hoomi, who was Joseph the Father of Jesus in one age, was
also Pythagoras in another embodiment. Thus the Great Ones
return again and again, living and dying in the physical octave
to help lift the human race up again unto God, the Almighty
Father.
So, my friends, I soon found, after I had contacted Ave
Maria, and received certain instruction under her, it was quite
easy for me to contact almost any of the Great Masters I chose.
She became, for my benefit, an oracle, I might say, through which
the Divine Wisdom of the Great Gods was poured out to me
like an everlasting Spring of the Water of Life and Power,
and I was truly bathed in its Glorious Radiance by the Chosen
Sons of God themselves.
One evening while talking to Ave Maria, and while looking
at her, humbly open to receive the slightest whisper of her
blessed wisdom, I noticed her entire countenance changed. Her
voice changed, her words were different, the accent absolutely
foreign to her nature. Even the eyes were strange and more
beautiful. The room took on a radiant glow. I felt an unutterable
peace steal in and about us. In awe I sat, almost afraid to breath,
thinking the “spell” might vanish should I move. Another being
sat before me. Yes, another Ascended Master. A number of
times before that there had been changes in Ave Maria, even
32
THE NE W GOL DE N AGE
in Her manner of talking, but this time, all was so changed,
I knew not what to expect.
“And who do you think I am?” asked the being before me.
“Can’t you recall whom I am? I was with you much even hun­
dreds of years ago. I met you in Rome long ago, in Egypt, and
other places in the Far East.”
I looked more closely at the radiant one who sat near me.
Then I noticed reddish, auburn hair, some freckles, and two
kindly eyes that were very familiar to me. Distinctly I could see
an auburn-colored beard too, and then it dawned upon me I was
looking into the face of Jesus the Christ. The Spirit of Jesus
Christ was in that temple-body before me. Ave Maria was gone.
“Make thy body beautiful, entire and clean that the Gods may
dwell therein,” came to my mind. There was the sweetest half­
smile about His mouth that I had ever seen. I just wanted to
sit there, quietly, saying nothing, drinking in the Light and Love
of His aura. Flow gradual the Masters had handled everything
so that I would not be too astonished about anything. About two
years before I had met Jesus in the inner planes. Yes, we were
together in a garden. He would stoop down and write symbols
in the smooth earth as He explained various principles of Life
and Love to me. At another time years ago I brought back to
this outer consciousness that same face when we were digging
irrigation ditches in Egypt. We were then brothers, too, I
recalled. Now He comes to teach me here in this body, to help
me in my ascension back to Our Father. He said little. He sat
and looked at me. I looked at Him. He simply radiated His
Light, Love, Wisdom and Power into my very heart, into my
mind and body. Our individual Spirits were blending into ONE.
LOVE RULED. LOVE ENFOLDED US. LOVE CAST A
PEACEFUL RADIANT GLOW ABOUT THE ROOM.
LOVE’S LIQUID-GOLD BATHED MY W EARIED
BRAIN, QUIETED MY TROUBLED HEART,
STRENGTHENED MY TIRED BODY AND CAUSED
ME TO FEEL THAT I WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE
GREAT SPIRIT OF ALL LIFE AND LOVE.
After a few minutes He was gone. He slipped away just as
stealthily as He came. Ave Maria returned. She spoke to me
of His having been there.
“Now you know,” she said, “who has been teaching you a
great deal of the time since you came here.”
“Yes,” I replied, “I now begin to understand. You are won-
33
LORD M A I T R E Y A
derful! He is wonderful! All is wonderful! I now begin to see
how the Great Masters and Lords work among mankind. Why
didn’t we know these things in the outer world long ago?”
She then explained to me some of the vital principles regard­
ing the Individual Spirits in one’s own life-stream or “Sky-Tree,”
as it is referred to by the Masters. Ah, Brothers and Sisters of
Light, it was so very remarkably and astonishingly marvelous
to me to learn these simple, though profoundly magnificent laws
of life! Now I knew I was to be supplied the “missing links” in
my CHAIN OF WISDOM, I had been working to create and
weld together down through the dim and shadowy ages. HOW
HAPPY WAS I! Yet, there was that feeling of nonchalance
that seemed to be the protective light and radiance about me
that enabled me to withstand it all. There was a part of me,
as it were, that definitely felt itself equal to any and all beings,
Masters, Lords, Gods or Goddesses whomsoever might come to
converse with me and instruct me in my outer or physical con­
sciousness. This part of me that FELT EQUAL must have been
that part that Abraham Lincoln meant when he said, “All men
are created equal.” And thus it is. “ALL MEN ARE
CREATED EQUAL,” but as Saint Germain now says, “All
are not up to par.” But, Fellow Workers of Light and Love,
WE ARE GOING TO BRING ALL WHO SINCERELY
SEEK THE TRUTH AND LIGHT OF CHRIST UP
“TO PAR.”
I must further explain to you now, as Ave Maria and Jesus
did to me, how that all the Spirits in your life-stream, are the
ones you must “get in line” before you may ascend. As I have
intimated to you before, each embodiment in which you lived
for ages in the past, as we measure time in the physical world,
you created, of your “own free will and accord,” the individual
Spirits that make up your particular “tree of life.” All those
Individual Spirits are in your tree, some of whom are merely
roosting there, some are more or less active, others are quite
dominant, and not a few of them actually want to run everything
because of the selfish characteristics they accumulated when they
were embodied. Those are the “blacks” who want to force
everything in the outer world. Don’t think that all the so-called
“Black Magicians” are in or about other people than yourself.
Anyone, no matter what they think of themselves, who want
to “lord it over” others in this world, are of the “Shadow.”
Any of you who have selfish ideas about your intelligence, wisdom
34
THE NE W GOLDEN AGE
or powers, are not WHOLLY WHITE. Now, do you see where
most of your difficulty is? Most of it is in your own “TREE.”
As some have put it, “In your own backyard.” How true!
As an example for you, as I have intimated, Abraham Lincoln
is one of the Individual Spirits in my “Life Tree.” Well, friends,
I must confess to you that I had no little difficulty in getting
Lincoln lined up and MASTERED, so that he would peaceably
enter the Temple of Love, Wisdom and Power, into which he
had been invited by Our Blessed Lord Maitreya. And that is
not all, Our Dear Lincoln developed quite a fondness for the
Spirit of Ave Maria, and She had to give him to understand that
“he had better get into the Temple of Wisdom and stay there
until he learned definitely what he should do” if he wanted to
assist in the Great Work of establishing the Golden Age
upon earth.
Let me explain more fully, if I may, how these Individual
Spirits work. They have, of course, a great deal of freedom
of their own, yet they are under your control, providing, however,
that you are MASTER of the human vessel, the physical body,
to which they are spiritually attached. In the same sense there
are Spiritual Trees, as it were, which are the Spiritual Ancestral
Trees of Spiritual Families. I, for instance, am of the Ancestral
Tree of Koot Hoomi, directly speaking, who was my spiritual
Father during the time of the Ministry of Jesus. So far as my
Spiritual inception was concerned, as well as my Spiritual Ante­
cedents, my physical parents had very little to do with it other
than that they were selected as earthly vessels through which
entry was made into the physical octave of life. These individual
Spirits in your “Tree” have much to do with your intuitive
faculties, your moods, your .inspirations, your various natural
characteristics, and especially your religious and philosophical
growth and expansion. They are really your spiritual higher
selves, ready and willing to serve you at your bidding, yet, it
is through your own self-generated LOVE that you become
HARMONIOUS with them and thus they work for you. There­
fore, you will see that even the ONE GREAT TREE OF GOD
is the ONENESS Jesus referred to so often when He made
such statements as, “I and the Father are ONE and the SAME.
I do nothing of myself, but by THE FATHER.” Again He said,
“I am the vine, ye are the BRANCHES.” Those of us who had
ascended before we returned here this time, have a fully devel­
oped HIGHER ASCENDED PRESENCE. My Higher Pres-
35
LORD M A I T R E Y A
ence is Saint Germain. Yes, He ascended a few generations back,
but He has had a few bodies since, even though John, whom
He was and is, had been DIVINELY SENT as Jesus was.
However, you of the world today, can readily see why John
was not accepted at that time. Even today not all narrow-minded
religionists will accept the fact that any who ascend become
SONS OF GOD in the same sense that Jesus did. Yet Jesus
tells you that more than once in the Scriptures, through His
Disciples. The people during the time of Jesus—those who
did believe him—could not believe there could be more than
ONE Messiah. Therefore, John, as His Mother told me last
November, 1940, was not accepted because “there was a mis­
understanding.” You may readily see what the “misunderstand­
ing” was. It was ignorance of the underlying laws of Life, just
as today, the people of the world cannot and will not accept
more than they can understand. Even Blessed Jesus, My Beloved
Brother, when on the cross, said, “Father forgive them for they
know not what they do.” I, today, might say of those who dis­
believe me and hate me “without a cause,” “Father forgive them
for they know not Thy laws. They are but children. In time
they will understand. We shall Love them, teach them, and lead
them into the LIGHT OF UNDERSTANDING.”
Yes, Brother, you might criticize me for admitting that I
am John the Brother of Jesus, that I was Lincoln, that My
Higher Presence is Saint Germain, and that My Spiritual Father
is Koot Hoomi. I realize that it isn’t good etiquette to make
such personal statements, as though I’m “blowing my horn” too
much. Well, friend, I am not interested in etiquette. I am inter­
ested in establishing “Thy Kingdom on earth as it is in Heaven,”
and I realize that I will have to blow “my horn” MIGHTY
LOUD if I out-do MY BROTHER JESUS. There certainly
was not anything weak nor timid about Him when it came to
speaking for Himself or His Father. Those subtle rules of
etiquette by which the “Black Brothers” keep a great percentage
of the people of the world in fear, have no power over me, nor
any Brother of Light. The only reason most people do not make
great claims for themselves is the fact that they have nothing
to claim. Everything I have said of myself was first claimed
of me by the Great Brothers of the Great White Brotherhood.
They “Chose” me. I did not go to them and tell them that I
had a “wild scheme” for the salvation of mankind, and put
myself up as a “Perfect Son of God.” They actually came to
36
THE N E W GOL DE N AGE
me and told me that very thing. They had an awful time con­
vincing me that I was the Great Being they said I was. Now,
understand me. I am talking about my Higher Presence, known
to the outer world as Saint Germain. I understand there is
another fellow over in Europe who claims to be Saint Germain.
Well, if he can convince me, Koot Hoomi, Lord Maitreya,
Buddha Gautama, Ave Maria, Jesus, Morya, Serapis, Archangel
Michael, Anoma of Venus, Joshua and a few others I can men­
tion, that he IS Saint Germain, then I will be willing to believe
that he is ME. And I AM HE. I shall expect him to make a
visit to America the very moment he hears about this. Yes,
MOMENT! I have heard he is a duke of some kind in Hungary
or somewhere thereabouts. I shall be glad to meet anybody any
time who might think they ARE SOMEBODY, for I am sure
there are others now embodied who have been misunderstood
just as badly as I have all my life. We Brothers of Light must
get together, ALL OF US. There are thousands of us now,
but there are other thousands still unaccounted for. Even James,
my other brother, is still to be brought into the Light of Christ.
Jesus had two brothers, James and John. It was to me that
Jesus spoke from the cross, “John, know thy mother.” It was
I who took care of Mary after Jesus’ ascension. For that reason
she was able to come to my assistance when I needed help in
my ascension. Isn’t it wonderful that the great Law of Compen­
sation does endure down through the ages? Truly, “Whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”
37
CHAPTER VI
Another vital point in the explanation of the various vehicles
we possess are our individual activities with reference to our
seven bodies that correspond with the seven planes of conscious­
ness. To me, again, it does not seem important what we might
name the seven bodies so long as we understand the divisions
of physical, etheric, mental, spiritual, aesthetic, electronic and
Christ bodies or grades of consciousness we experience in the
ONE LIFE. Vibration is manifest in every form of life. The
colors of the spectrum is one example, the octaves of the piano
is another, altitude is one; even depth might be considered a
fair analogy for explaining vibration, however, electricity is
probably the best—or we may say, the electro-magnetic or nega­
tive-positive principle that has been analyzed by the scientific
physicist. The vibration of waves made by the transmitting or
projecting of electricity into the sea of ether enveloping the earth,
when a radio message is sent out, is the most definite proof to
the mind of the laity of the invisible though tangible forces of
the field of electro-nature. The average person who listens to
a radio program does not realize the great phenomenon mani­
festing. Similarly we of today take many marvelous productions
of science and invention as mere common-place adjuncts of every­
day life. Ordinary minds abhor abstract thinking. A great per­
centage of human beings cannot concentrate on visualizing things
in the abstract. Many of them will actually become nervous and
irritated should you talk to them much of such principles. The
moment you go beyond the etheric reach of another’s mind that
one, in order to justify himself, will, in whatever way he can,
do his utmost to prove you not more than his equal, and may even
try to master you and prove you to be his inferior. It is most
natural for all human beings to be EQUAL. Every ONE
innately feels his EQUALITY, even though it may be so deeply
hidden he gets but a faint glimmer of it in the shadowy recesses
of his limited physical sphere. I shall endeavor to clearly explain
the seven bodies of man.
Taking the earth as an epitome of the Cosmos, we narrow
down the expanse of life to a sphere about twenty-five thousand
38
THE N E W G OL DE N AGE
miles in circumference. The diameter is eight thousand miles.
Air, we are told, extends to about forty miles above the earth’s
surface. Beyond this is ether, a finer element than air, which is
claimed by science to fill all space to the uttermost and nether­
most, the highest and lowest.
What is the secret of all life and activity? That is the great
question of the ages. This has puzzled the greatest of minds,
and there has probably been more said about it, written about it,
than any one thing that was ever thought of. And yet this secret
of secrets lies hidden right in the HEART of man. He, too, is
an epitome of God, of the earth, of the universe, of the COS­
MOS. He is the microcosm, the whole of life and activity is the
macrocosm; he is the little world in the immensity of the ALL­
WORLD; he is a tiny cell in the great BODY OF GOD, a spark
of Light in the luminous sphere of ALL LIGHT.
Relatively, all life is in one MASS-CONSCIOUSNESS.
The CENTER of that CONSCIOUSNESS is GOD. The part
of that consciousness that reaches farthermost from the Center
is the physical atom. You have a body that corresponds to each
plane of the WHOLE of GOD’S CREATION. Your physical
body corresponds to the physical part of HIM; your outer men­
tality corresponds to His Lower Mind or Physical Mind; your
etheric, astral, or emotional being and body harmonize with the
Etheric part of Him; your higher mental body is an extension, in
a sense, of His Higher Mentality; your aesthetic or Bliss-Body is
in keeping with God’s Beauty, Joy, Love and all that is Peaceful
and Blissful; your Electronic Body or Fire-Body is like God’s
LIGHT-BODY, and the Seventh Body, the Christ-Body, is the
Radiant Sun of Light, Love, Intelligence and Power of God
Almighty. Then you become and ARE the Son of God, ONE
WITH HIM in the Glory of His Being. You have always been
His Son. Now you are ONCE MORE realizing IT, the I AM.
God IS IN YOUR HEART. The Christ-Body is THERE. I
AM THAT I AM. I always was and ever shall be. I have a
Christ-Body. It is like God’s Body.
My greatest desire is to assist all mankind to understand all
their Seven Bodies as well as the numerous Spirits that may be
in their Life-Tree or Sky Tree. Love is of primary and utmost
importance in understanding the abstract planes of consciousness
through which God does manifest, even in the physical world.
LOVE IS A DIVINE SUBSTANCE. It is the ALL-PER­
VADING principle by which and through which God works
39
LORD M A I T R E Y A
throughout ALL CREATION. Through your Electronic Body
you work with Light. Through your Aesthetic Body you work
with Love. In your Etheric Body you work with a different
form of electricity than you do with your Higher Mental Body,
etc. Each body you possess has its corresponding substance or
Light-Substance or Essences of God’s Attributes. When we
understand and have mastered and harmonized all the Seven
Bodies we become ONE WITH THE ABSOLUTE — we
become, as I AM, a SUN radiating forth Light, Love, Wisdom
and Power of our own accord, because of our own Divine Right.
I have gone back to the Father IN THE SUN. I still have my
physical body, yet, in consciousness I AM ONE W II H THÉ
FATHER-MOTHER GOD. I went into the Cosmic Heart,
the ONE CENTER, consciously, and AM in my FULL ILLU­
MINATION and CONSCIOUSNESS, ONE WITH GOD.
Beloved friends, the three lower bodies are the ones that
cause us all the trouble here in the physical plane, d he physical,
mental and emotional bodies surely have to be ruled, and every
single spirit in your life-stream and every other person with
whom you come in contact, have much to do with harmonizing
those three lower bodies. The harmonizing, transmuting, regen­
erating and everything that is essential in ascending to God,
must be done right here in the physical body. The physical body
you now possess is by far the most important body you have
through which you can become a regenerated being. A tree can­
not bear fruit without life and the leaves on the tree are the
“life-gatherers” through which the intelligence of the “seed” or
heart of the tree generates fruit. Your physical body, with your
lungs, heart, blood-stream, nervous system and all the other
marvelous attributes you possess, are the laboratory in which
you, a man, are now BECOMING A GOD. Inasmuch as you
become in harmony with God you do become HIM. Therefore,
as soon as you get all of your selves and your Seven Bodies in
harmony, naturally you become the fully Illuminated Son of
God. I have known many fine teachers of transcendental princi­
ples who might have finished and completed their work and
become ONE IN CHRIST had they not taken for granted as
fact that every vision, emanation, psychic experience, etc., they
saw, were of the Highest God. The “Dark” forces can only
work in and through the three lower bodies. How sad it is when
you see those who might otherwise be wonderful beings in the
Garden of God’s Love, but simply because of their misunder-
40
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
standing or not understanding the WHOLE of God’s Creation,
they remain just outside the Temple of Light, Love, Wisdom
and Power whose “DOOR” is Lord .Maitreya, and I AM His
Chief Officer and Representative here in the Earth Plane, through
whom all who sincerely seek Truth and Light, may enter and
dine with the Gods.
Yes, Love is so essential. Without it you cannot harmonize
even your own physical temple, let alone trying to show others
what they should do in order to be saved. Yet, so many become
conceited and egotistical, thinking they should teach the people
of this world. We must become most obedient to the Masters
of Light, otherwise we do not receive the higher teachings each
of us require, to rise higher and higher, until we do KNOW
GOD and become ONE WITH HIM.
I well remember when Lord Maitreya asked me, “Would
you like to go into Nirvana?” I knew little about Nirvana.
Yet I knew it was something very desirable should one want to
aspire to the Highest.
I asked, “How does one go there?”
“I AM THE DOOR TO THE TEMPLE,” He explained.
“The portal is open to you. You may enter in. I am the Lord of
Lords. I will teach you.”
“I shall be glad to go to Nirvana,” I replied.
“It is the Field of Bliss. There you shall rest in Peace, and
you will learn in your Higher Body, in your Higher Presence,
many things you wish to know,” He answered.
Yes, I went to Nirvana. Much I learned. Some of it, at the
time, I brought back to my physical consciousness, but most of
it vaguely I recalled. But none of the great Love, Wisdom, and
Blissful Experiences I contacted there was forgotten. As I
became more harmonious in my three lower bodies gradually
it all came through to my outer mind.
For about three days following my entry into Nirvana, I
felt rather drowsy and dreamy in my mind. You see, my Spirit
was in Nirvana. As we often say, jovially, of course, “I was not
all here.” And, friends, that is the trouble with most all of us.
We are not all here. A great part of ourselves is out somewhere
else feeding on the things our hearts most love. “Where your
treasure is there your heart is also,” as Jesus said. Be sure that
your heart is set on the worthwhile things in God’s creation.
Should you wish to go into Nirvana, there is nothing to fear.
Jesus went into Nirvana, into the Field of Bliss, before He
41
LORD MAI TREYA
could have become the great being He was. If and when we
love Christ enough, we are that instant drawn into the higher
planes of Light and Love. We are taken into the Temple by
Lord Maitreya who is the Lord of Love. I AM the Door.
When Jesus said, “Come unto me, ye who are tired and
heavy laden and I will give you rest,” He was talking about
Nirvana, the Temple of Love, and Lord Maitreya the Lord of
Love now invites you to pass through the “DOOR” into His
Temple, CHRIST’S TEMPLE, where you shall rest in peace,
and learn the Wisdom of the Gods your heart has yearned for
such a long, long time. Mount Shasta in northern California
has definitely been chosen as “The Mountain of God.” From
this mountain the Gods do pour forth their Light, Love, Wisdom
and Power. The “DOOR” is open to TRUE SEEKERS, but
ever closed to those who choose the ways of darkness.
May you, my Brothers and Sisters, ever keep your three
lower bodies in perfect harmony, for thus you shall transmute
all forces in those bodies into the pure Electronic Substance of
Divine Love and it shall all be drawn into the AURA of Lord
Maitreya for the upliftment of ALL MANKIND.
You might ask, Beloved, “Who are those that are invited
to enter the Temple?”
I, my Beloved Friends of Light, am not an active member of
any outer organization or brotherhood. I am a member of the
Great White Brotherhood, and I AM A MEMBER OF THE
COUNCIL OF SEVEN who direct the activities of the Great
White Brotherhood. I am a Priest of the Order of Melchizedek
—THE SPIRITUAL ORDER. I am a member of the ILLU­
MINATI, the SPIRITUAL ORDER OF THE ROSICRU-
CIANS. I am a member of the CELESTIAL LODGE, THE
SPIRITUAL ORDER OF THE MASONIC FRATER­
NITY. And I can go on and on, naming SPIRITUAL BROTH­
ERHOODS without number, almost, of which I am a member.
I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE
“WHITE FORCES” ON THE INNER PLANES OF LIFE
AND THE “CHIEF AVATAR” OVER ALL TRUE
BROTHERS OF LIGHT IN ALL OUTER BROTHER­
HOODS SUCH AS THE “UNIVERSAL BROTHER­
HOOD.” I HOLD THE GREAT SEAL OF “ALPHA AND
OMEGA” OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS. I FEAR NO
ONE IN MAKING THESE STATEMENTS. I EVEN
KNOW OF ALL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE BROTH-
42
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
ERHOODS AND SISTERHOODS OF THE ROMAN
CATHOLIC HIERARCHY, and I AM CHRIST’S TRUE
BROTHER INCARNATE FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE
THE LIGHT IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS JUST THE
SAME AS THE OTHERS I HAVE MENTIONED
ABOVE. I AM NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS. I AM
THE TRUTH, THE LIGHT, LOVE, WISDOM AND
POWER OF GOD ALMIGHTY INCARNATE IN EARTH
FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEADING MANKIND OUT OF
DARKNESS INTO THE LIGHT AND UNDERSTAND­
ING OF THE NEW GOLDEN AGE. COME! COME
ALL—ALL WHO SEEK THE LIGHT OF CHRIST, THE
RADIANT SON OF GOD ALMIGHTY. THE DOOR IS
OPEN. LOVE’S LIGHT WILL LEAD YOU ON INTO
THE TEMPLE OF CHRIST.
No, Friends, there is not one single angle of any religion on
earth that I do not understand. When we become ONE WITH
GOD there is nothing hidden from us. In this I mean the wis­
dom of God and the knowledge of His Divine Laws, and surely
there is not a single principle that any “little man-made church”
on earth might have fostered that God and His Son do not
understand. Beloved, you will be amazed one of these days to
know how ONENESS WITH GOD will solve every problem
you ever thought of.
All outer empirical orders, brotherhoods, fraternities,
churches, groups, organizations, cliques, clans, etc., from the
African Voodoos to the Pope of Rome and the Heads of all
Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or Whatnot national, international
or ecclesiastical, or whatsoever—ALL ARE SUBJECT TO
THE SPIRITUAL HIERARCHY OF GOD. AND THE
GREAT WHITE BROTHERHOOD AND THE COUN­
CIL OF THE GREAT WHITE CELESTIAL LODGE
ARE THE SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY OF GOD AL­
MIGHTY ON THIS EARTH. LET NO MAN THINK
THAT MY WORDS ARE NOT OF TRUTH, LOVE,
WISDOM AND POWER. THOSE WHO QUESTION
SHALL DOUBT. THOSE WHO DOUBT KEEP THEM­
SELVES WITHOUT THE “DOOR.” THOSE WHO BE­
LIEVE SHALL FIND ALL AND EVEN MORE THAN
THEY EVER EXPECTED. HEAR MY WORDS, KNOW
THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH WILL MAKE YOU
FREE. I AM SENT THAT YOU MAY KNOW CHRIST
43
LORD MAI TREYA
THROUGH ME. THOSE WHO DOUBT ME SHALL
NOT BE RECEIVED BY HIM WHO SENT ME. THOSE
WHO ARE NOT WITH ME ARE AGAINST ME. THOSE
WHO DO NOT BELIEVE ME DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE TEACHINGS OF MY ELDER BROTHER JESUS.
THOSE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND JESUS SHALL
NOT SEE CHRIST IN ME. THOSE OF YOU WHO
KNOW CHRIST IN YOUR HEARTS SHALL READILY
RECOGNIZE CHRIST IN ME. CALL ME INTO YOUR
HEART AND JESUS CHRIST AND I, HIS YOUNGER
BROTHER JOHN, SHALL BOTH COME TO YOU AND
BLESS YOU IN THE LIGHT OF CHRIST LORD MAIT­
REYA. WE ARE ALL SONS OF THE ONE FATHER. IF
YOU KNOW THE ONE FATHER THEN YOU SHALL
KNOW ME, FOR TRULY I AND MY FATHER AND
BLESSED KOOT HOOMI, AND ALL THE SONS OF
GOD ARE ONE—“ONE BODY WEE”—POURING OUT
OUR LOVE-LIGHT TO ALL MANKIND. COME UNTO
US AND BECOME ONE W ITH US IN CH RIST.
“CHRIST” means GOD INCARNATE. “AND THE
WORD BECOMES FLESH AND BLOOD AND DWELLS
AMONG MEN.” THE GODS—SONS OF THE ONE
ALMIGHTY GOD — ARE NOW INCARNATING IN
EARTH TO ESTABLISH “THY KINGDOM ON EARTH
AS IT IS IN HEAVEN”—THE GOLDEN AGE. “FEAR
NOT,” WE ARE WITH YOU ALWAYS.
All churches must now band together under the ONE
GREAT LIGHT. This is their last chance to manifest TRUE
BROTHERLY LOVE. If they fail this time, they shall be
thrown into utter darkness—those who choose darkness.
44
CHAPTER VII
During 1937, while managing a hotel in Eureka, Calif., I
had, as was my habit, wherever I chanced to be, taught a class
or group in Esoteric Christianity, or as I might explain, the
secret interpretation of the Holy Scripture. Most of my direct
teaching and explaining of these things had come to me through
the Rosicrucian Fraternity and the various Brotherhoods which
are embraced in its many departments of training, discipline and
other activities of service to mankind.
I must say I have been, in the physical plane, as well as the
inner planes, the most fortunate individual possible when it came
to attracting to myself any and everything I needed for my
philosophical development. Truly, I can say that I never more
than wished for anything in the way of wisdom, when it would
certainly appear on the scene in the form of a vision, inner experi­
ence, a physical man, a spiritual man, a physical book, a spiritual
book, a fraternal connection, through the Holy Bible, or some
other mysterious manner. For the past twenty years nothing has
been hidden from me that I desired to know.
Having first read the initial book of the Ballard “I AM”
activity in 1934, and other books thereafter, it was in 1938 that
I felt I should take a more active part in the OUTER ACTIV­
ITY of the organization, since I had taken a great part for a
number of years in its formation and activity on the inner planes
of consciousness. Frequently I brought back to my outer con­
sciousness the part I was playing in the activity esoterically. I
seemed always to be directing such activities in the inner planes.
I recall distinctly how I brought through to my outer conscious­
ness the organization and production of a New Age Magazine.
This was at the time the “Voice” was first published, a magazine
that Charles Sindelar produced under the direction of the Bal-
lards in 1936. I mention this because I wish to explain another
startling experience I had with Blessed Charles Sindelar at an­
other time. This I shall explain later. He knows nothing of the
things I shall relate in the outer, however he did get all beauti­
fully in the inner.
45
LORD MAI TREYA
I had a very trying time to become an active worker in the
“I AM” organization. I shall relate, in fact produce herewith,
a part of the correspondence and other contacts I made in my
endeavors to help them. There are other letters, copies of which
I did not keep. A great deal of the correspondence I have carried
on with “Students of Light” and friends of mine during the past
many years I made carbon copies, for which I am now most
thankful. At the time I never dreamed they might be useful for
publishing in a book. My intention at the time they were written
was invariably because when I write to one interested in the
LIGHT I become inspired. So frequently I had wished after
mailing a letter that I had kept a copy of it, for I found that
after my inspirations “cooled down,” so to speak, those letters
were very interesting and inspiring. Since I left grammar school
and the printing office where I set type by hand for several years,
I always tried to perfect my writing. This habit of striving for
perfection in writing grew on me. Therefore, when I did get to
the point where I could write inspiring letters I formed the habit
of keeping carbon copies of them. Thanks to the foresight of
“Saint Germain,” I now have some of this correspondence which
was carried on with the Ballards and others of the Light. There
were some previous communications before this one I shall now
quote, but I shall give you a thorough understanding of the
GREAT BATTLE I had in trying to HELP the very ONES
who were PRAISING MY OWN HIGHER PRESENCE—
SO STRANGE BUT YET SO TRUE:

Beloved Enlightened Ones:
Before I went to the Shrine Class in Los Angeles, where I received
so much good, and where I endeavored to find just what I should do in
order to start a class, after having written to Ratana, Box 661, Alhambra,
Calif., to whom I was told by Brother Mike Gallagher to write, after
having also written to M r. and Mrs. Ballard without any definite reply,
and after having heard conflicting reports on the part of several leaders
and students as to just what one should do to start a group, truly, I am
at a loss as to know just what I should do. A ll I can do is to LO O K TO
M Y PRESENCE, the “GREAT I A M ” and do what my heart bids
me do.
Do I need to be invested with any authority from somebody to teach
the T RU T H I K N O W ? Or should I simply start a group, following
46
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
the work as taught by your messengers, and forget about all human
authority ?
I KN O W THE L A W . . . I K N O W THE TRU TH AS
T A U G H T IN THE “I A M ” BOOKS . . . I HAVE EXPERIENCED
A LL PHASES OF THE TEACH IN G . . . SO FAR AS I CAN
SEE . . . EXCEPT THE ASCENSION . . . YEARS BEFORE I
EVER READ THE “UNVEILED M YSTERIES” AND I DO
W A N T TO HELP CARRY THE TEACH IN GS TO THE W O RLD.
I SEE THE NEED OF TH IS N EW CHANNEL . . . U N AD U L­
TERATED . . . FOR THE M ASSES TO RECEIVE THE TRU TH
OF THE “M AG IC PRESENCE.” I HAVE LIVED A BOOK NO
LESS INTERESTING TH AN “UNVEILED M YSTERIES” AND
THE “M AG IC PRESENCE” . . . W IL L YO U BELIEVE ME
W H EN I SAY / W A N T T O H E L P Y O U ? W ill you give me the
least bit of an idea as to just how you would want me to start?
I know how to teach—have been a teacher of Esoteric Christianity for
the past 18 years, and feel that I can be of great help to you if you wish
me to be. I am not egotistical . . . I care not to elevate my personality
. . . I do not need to learn more . . . I need to practice what I know . . .
and teaching others helps one to do this. Above all I wish to aid struggling
humanity . . . a great urge that has welled up within my heart since I
was seven years old. I have attracted to me Masters and teachers from
all over the world. I M U ST go forth to help others.
I have been actively attending group meetings (I A M ) in Eureka for
the past few months. I first contacted the work in 1934, when a teacher
with whom I corresponded (U B) in Washington, D. C., sent me a copy
of “Unveiled Mysteries.”

As early as the middle of the summer, 1936, I had lectured
before audiences in Olympia and Bremerton, Washington, on
the “I AM.” I lectured in a banquet room at the Governor
Hotel in Olympia and at the Enitai Inn in Bremerton. This can
easily be proven. Ernest Van Walker, Olympia, Wash., was
chairman of the meeting there, and my younger brother, D. K.
Westfall, and his wife attended the meeting. I mention names
merely because I want the world to know that I have nothing to
hide. I want all things to come forth into the LIGHT. Should
there appear to be an untruth anywhere in this book I want to
hear about it.

Dear Friends of the Light:
In reply to your note of no date I am returning the Group Leader
Registration card filled out complete, as you required.
A t the time I mailed the card in the first place I had not, as is
explained thereon, started a group, but I supposed that one had to get
some kind of authority, etc., before beginning. I had been told by M r.
Gallagher to start a Minute Men’s Group. I had written to Ratana in
Alhambra without getting a reply. While at the Shrine Class in Los
Angeles I saw Ratana but she was so busy I did not get to go into detail
with her regarding the class or group. Since receiving your note and since
M r. Hamilton was here (with Mrs. Deal) from Oakland, I have, follow­
ing the statement of M r. Hamilton to “go ahead and start,” gotten a
group together in cooperation with Mrs. James and Mrs. Airth and Mrs.
Connick, all of whom, as you know, are leaders here in Eureka.
There have never been many men interested in the “I A M ” here,
but now since we have gotten started with the Minute Men’s Group, we
are gradually getting new-comers, and I am sure, with the great interest
all have shown in the work, we are going right ahead.
W e sincerely ask your blessing in our undertaking. I have dropped all
activity in all other outer work that might interfere with my advancement
in the “I A M .” I was a member of the old Theosophical Society as long
as 16 years ago. I got much good from that study. I was also a student
under Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer for 14 years and I must say I learned
and experienced marvelous P R O O F S OF THE T R U T H OF THE
G R E A T W O R K OF THE M ASTERS. I cannot doubt the least bit
of the work as set forth in the “Unveiled Mysteries,” “The Magic
Presence,” “The ‘I A M ’ Discourses,” “The Ascended Master Dis­
courses” and “Ascended Master Light.” They are all inspired books.
I feel that I should tell you why I took up the “I A M ” as I have.
First the first book, “Unveiled Mysteries,” was sent to me by my leader in
the “U-B” through whom I received documents from the White
Brotherhood.
These documents were wonderful. I learned much from them. I have
always sought the Truth; I have never tired of seeking it. I have been
unusually blessed with proof beyond doubt.
However, I believe M r. Ballard is the One chosen to lead the people
out of darkness. I believe there had to be a new channel created through
which the Unadulterated Truth had to be given to the people. I realize
why he was chosen, and I believe if I had proven as strong and good as
he, then I might have been chosen for a similar work, for I, too, was under
the training of the M asters during the same time he was. I was not chosen
48
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
for that particular work, but I am willing to keep on trying to help others,
and the good I have in me w ill come forth some day to help me help others.
I want you to know that I am for “THE I A M ” and I pray that your
faith in me shall not be in vain. I have had transcendental experiences to
prove the I AM . I have seen some of my past lives. Now, since a few
days ago, or nights, rather, when I contacted Mrs. Ballard’s messenger
(on the inner) as well as M r. Ballard, himself, and I was told to go
ahead with the meetings, I write this letter. I remain yours,
Fearlessly, in THE LIGH T,
NORM AN R. W E STFALL.

The following letter was the first communication I received
from “The Ballards” accepting me as a Group Leader:
PALM ER HOUSE
Chicago
Norman R. Westfall Oct. 21, 1938
Central Hotel
Eureka, Calif.
Blessed Student of the Light,
Thank you so much for your Group Leader’s Registration. W e are
indeed glad to call to the “Mighty I A M Presence” of each one and to the
Great Host of Ascended Masters to take full charge of your entire activity,
produce Ascended Master Perfection, hold it Eternally Sustained and
pour forth a Mighty Radiation to Bless all with whom you come in contact.
Noting the reference made in your letter to your previous channels
of study we feel it advisable to call your attention to the need for each
student and more particularly for each Group Leader to be eternally
vigilant that by no chance does any of the instructions received through
other channels creep into their work in this activity.
The instruction given in the books and magazine, as you have com­
mented, is complete in itself. It requires no interpretation or explanation
in terms of any instruction which you may have received in the past. Of
course Saint Germain and the other Ascended Ones under whose radiation
this work is being given forth appreciate fully the great benefits students
have received through their past studies, but They also realize that there
were many mistakes in much of the instruction previously received and
They realize that the human cannot possibly distinguish between that which
is correct and that which is not. They therefore request that in giving
forth this instruction each Group Leader must be meticulously careful to
adhere strictly to the instructions actually given in the books and magazines
and the Discourses of the Ascended Ones.
You will remember that Jesus in His Discourse given Christmas 1935
and printed in the “Voice” for February 1936, urges all sincere students
49
LORD MAI TREYA
to set aside everything they have studied in the past and stand 100% by
their “Mighty I A M Presence” and the Discourses by Saint Germain.
May you rest assured there is an important reason for this and in carrying
out this, and other similar requests, we ask all Group Leaders to set
aside anything that would act as a reference to other sources of instruction,
such as use of “Inner Names” and other forms of symbology associated
with the other teachings. This must not be taken as any criticism of the
wonderful assistance that has been received through other channels;
it is simply obedience to Saint Germain’s request that this particular
channel be used only for giving forth the instructions which it was
designed to convey.
W e thank you and bless you for your service to the Light and call
forth to you the Limitless Directing Intelligence, Strength, Courage and
Perfection of your own “Mighty I AM Presence” Eternally Sustained.
Our Love and Blessings enfold you always,
GW B/PBC (Signed) THE BALLARDS.

The above letter, to me, is a wonderful message of advice,
even today, after all I have gone through in order to discover
WHO I AM. I hold Mr. G. W. Ballard in my consciousness as
probably the greatest being I ever met up to His time in the
outer octave of life. It is true, no doubt, that he was merely a
MESSENGER, but he was the GREATEST MESSENGER
the world ever knew up to HIS time. He brought forth a
MESSAGE that was the cause or, I should say, the result, of
the GREAT COSMIC CAUSE that issued from WITHIN
OUT at that time. Had I been more IN TUNE with my
OUTER SELF at that time, I would have been chosen as
MESSENGER or to cooperate directly with Him. “WHAT­
SOEVER A MAN SOWETH THAT SHALL HE ALSO
REAP.” I never blame another for what “lack” or sorrows
may be placed upon me. That is the height of stupidity—to
blame others for what we might have to suffer in order to get
BACK TO GOD. “God is not mocked.” LOVE will lead you
to the “threshold” and even on “through the portal” into the
“TEMPLE OF THE LORD.” Brother Ballard held, in a
certain sense, the same position while He was on earth as I
NOW HOLD.
I am certain that Mrs. Ballard never attained the height
Mr. Ballard had mastered. That was all shown to me on the
inner planes at the time of Mr. Ballard’s passing. Mrs. Ballard
was not to have taken charge of the “I AM” activity. Her son,
50
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Donald, was to be in charge of the outer organization. Mrs.
Ballard was left in “a bad way” so far as her “initiations” were
concerned. Her husband and “Master-Teacher” was taken from
her so suddenly she knew not what to do. She was right in the
midst of important steps or “initiations” and trials and tests,
and the “Blacks” so called, pounced on her from all sides. She
could not distinguish between the “good” and “bad.” She had
not advanced to that “degree” of mastery where she was
MASTER enough to KNOW definitely and be able to bring
through to the outer plane the guidance and direction and instruc­
tion that the “I AM” students need to carry them on into NEW
and Necessary FIELDS of KNOWLEDGE and EXPERI­
ENCE. There was so very much that Saint Germain, Koot
Hoomi, Morya, Jesus, Ave Maria and other Ascended Masters
wished to bring through to give to the “I AM” students and all
True Seekers of Light throughout the world. Far be it from me
to blame Mrs. Ballard or any of those BRAVE ONES who
undertook to do the very best they knew under the circumstances.
If you Blessed Ones who feel like blaming them just HAVE
TO BLAME SOME ONE THEN BLAME THE SINISTER
FORCES WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE
TROUBLE. They are the ones who took my little son by
placing him in the powerful rollers of an electric wringer. They
were the ones who tormented me and my dear wife until she,
too, was taken. I have walked through “HELL” many times
to rise through seemingly “ETERNAL OPPOSITION” to get
where I now stand SERENE IN THE FACE OF WORLDLY
TURMOIL. At last I have risen above such trials, and the
GODS STAND BESIDE ME TO PROTECT ME FROM
ALL HARM.
Of course I do not say I could not be harmed in the physical
body, but WOE UNTO THE ONE OR ONES WHO
WOULD DARE TRY TO HARM ME. I did not come
forth into the world to give out this message of the TRUE
ASCENSION until the GREAT MASTERS told me I had
their protection. As soon as I knew the GREAT LAW OF
TFIE GOLDEN AGE and brought it through to my physical
consciousness, WHEN I HAD MASTERED and they told me
“you are now MASTER AMSUMATA,” I did venture forth.
NOW I AM FREE. I AM MASTER. I HAVE ASCENDED
UNTO MY FATHER. MY HIGHER PRESENCE IS
51
LORD MAI TREYA
EVER WITH THE FATHER, GOD OF THE GOLDEN
HEART, MAHACHOHAN.
Had Mr. Ballard remained a little longer, I dare say, so he
could instruct Mrs. Ballard in the few additional “degrees” she
was to have been given, she would have become MASTER. In
order to be Master, we must know and understand how to use
all three—LOVE, WISDOM and POWER, in their perfect
BALANCE, and THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE.
Mrs. Ballard, I shall again dare to say, went too much to the
Wisdom and Power—too much to the positive or masculine side
to be properly balanced. All her activities following her hus­
band’s passing showed this. Had she called to the Master, the
Lord of Love, Maitreya, things would have turned out differ­
ently for her. Forgive ALL, OH, LORD OF LOVE!
What I am more interested in than any other phase of the
Ballard “I AM” activity is getting the essential “next steps” in
the Great Initiations to the millions of students who have taken
the “first steps.” Now there is no one in their organization to
take them on “through the door” into the “TEMPLE” of the
LORD. There must be the MASTER to take them on “IN.”
Mrs. Ballard could not do that. She had not finished her own
“Initiations.” I know. During the trying trials Mrs. Ballard
was passing through the early part of 1941, while I held the
office of Silent Watcher to this world, I was in the presence of
Mrs. Ballard more than once, simply for the purpose of analyz­
ing her to see what was essential to her initiatory welfare. I
have stood within ten feet of her for long periods of time, analyz­
ing every thought that went through her heart and mind. There
is no one on*earth nor in heaven who wanted to help Mrs. Ballard
more than I, but it was impossible to help her because of her
powerful outer mind and innate “stubbornness,” all of which are
magnificent attributes or qualities if rightly used. Mrs. Ballard
definitely went to the glamourous side of life, too, which is dia­
metrically opposed to the ways of the Masters. The Great
Masters dress simply but beautifully. They never COMMAND
outer persons, or impose their powers in any manner whatsoever
upon others. An Ascended Master would never tell one what to
do or even suggest anything unless LOVE REIGNED SU­
PREME IN HIS HEART. I WANT THE WORLD TO
KNOW, HOWEVER, THAT I DO NOT THINK OF MRS.
BALLARD, DONALD BALLARD OR ANYONE CON­
NECTED WITH THAT “I AM” ACTIVITY WITH
52
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
WHICH THEY WERE ASSOCIATED BUT WITH THE
GREATEST RESPECT AND LOVE. THE WHOLE
WORLD SHOULD LOVE THEM EVERYONE, THEN
THE PERFECT VISION THEY HELD OF THE NEW
GOLDEN AGE MIGHT QUICKLY COME INTO MANI­
FESTATION AND JOY AND HAPPINESS REIGN
THROUGHOUT THIS WORLD. EVERY CONSTRUC­
TIVE DECREE THEY HAVE VOICED INTO THE
AETHER SHALL MANIFEST. THE SHATTERING
AND DESTRUCTIVE DECREES THEY MISTAKENLY
VOICED I HEREBY DECLARE “IN THE NAME AND
LIGHT AND LOVE OF LORD MAITREYA” TO BE
TRANSMUTED INTO THE PURE ELECTRONIC
SUBSTANCE OF DIVINE LOVE AND DRAW ALL
INTO THE AURA OF LORD OF LORDS MAITREYA
TO USE AS HE SEES FIT IN THE UPLIFTMENT OF
ALL MANKIND.
There is so very much that is to be taught the students first
before they can possibly enter the Higher Temple of Initiation
that, to us who know, it seems most childish the manner in
which many self-appointed teachers have undertaken to “lift”
their fellowmen. I, as a teacher, authorized by the True Broth­
erhoods since 1925, have never once, to my knowledge, taught
anything I had not experienced. I never once hinted to another,
that I recall, of ever considering myself a Master, until I was
acclaimed “MASTER” by the Great Brothers of the Great
White Lodge. Then it was because of the position I was chosen
to fill as a “World-Teacher,” the “Chief-Avatar,” that I did
state to the world that I am a “MASTER.” And this term,
Beloved Students of Light, signifies that I have MASTERED
my desires, my passions, my forces, my body, the “four elements”
that make up this body and spirit and that I HAVE AS­
CENDED INTO THE COSMIC HEART OF GOD AND
KNOW THAT I HAVE THAT “CELESTIAL BODY”
THAT PAUL SPEAKS OF IN THE HOLY BIBLE. I
KNOW THAT I SHALL LIVE FOREVER. I KNOW
THAT I AM INDESTRUCTIBLE. I REJOICE IN MY
OWN INDIVIDUAL IMMORTALITY. I AM ONE
WITH MY SPIRITUAL FATHER. I BREATHE IN
AND BREATHE OUT THE GREAT SPIRIT OF LIFE
FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD. I AM EVEN
YOUR—you who read these lines—BELOVED TEACHER,
53
LORD MA I T R E Y A
otherwise you would not now be reading them. It is so declared
by Christ, Son of the Living God, whom I AM.
The following letter, written by myself to Mr. and Mrs.
Ballard in answer to their letter dated October 21, 1938, from
Chicago, will clearly show you “where my heart was as well as
my treasure” :
M r. and Mrs. G. W . Ballard Central Hotel
Palmer House Eureka, Calif.
Chicago, 111. Oct. 28, 1938.
Beloved Messengers:
Your letter of acknowledgment of the 21st instant, in that you mention
my Group Leader Registration, I make haste to answer, assuring you of
the happiness it brought me. Though somewhat belated, I do truly con­
sider it a great blessing, coming from you at this time.
For six months, as you may know, I have striven for this acceptance,
having attempted through M r. Gallagher first, at his suggestion, through
Ratana, H. L. Rogers, (at Shrine Class in Los Angeles in July), previous
letters to you and Ratana, Leader Hamilton in Oakland, and M r. Leach
here in Eureka—yes, for six months I have tried to get some kind of
acceptance such as your letter embraces, and at times I must say I was
very discouraged, but at last I A M M O ST T H AN KFU L TO GOD,
THE M IG H T Y “I A M ” PRESENCE, THE ASCENDED M A S­
TERS AND THE HOST OF LIGH T, T H A T YO U R BEAUTIFUL
LETTER, W IT H ALL ITS LOVE AND ENCOURAGING
ADVICE, IS A T HAND. It is so lovingL kind I shall always prize
it as one of my most valued possessions.
I am reminded of the old Alchemist’s advice to the “Fourth Wise
Man” :
“PATIENCE, PATIENCE, Thou earnest into the Desert a
vendor of salt; thou mayest go forth an Alchemist, distilling from
life’s PLEASURES AND SO RRO W S such sweet Attar in Thy Soul
that Thou mayest enter into the C IT Y OF T H Y DESIRE.”
I am thankful that I possessed the patience that has finally brought
to me the loving acceptance I sought. Your suggestions regarding mention
of “inner names” etc., or references to other teachings, I sincerely appreciate.
Forgive me for having ever misused such. However, M r. and Mrs.
Ballard, is it advisable at any time to refer to you regarding any “inner”
experiences we may have had or may have in the future? For instance,
just a few days ago I experienced the following, and I believe it may be of
importance to you and the work:
I had just retired, relaxed, lying on my back, entirely awake,
when a being, apparently similar to “Goddess of Liberty” or some
54
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
being dressed in long flowing garments, came floating by, from right to
left in front and above me. There was just one word spoken—-“BE”
— and it was spoken like a note of music. The power of the word seemed
magnified many times over, and it resounded several times, like you
might pluck a string on “your harp,” thus:
“BE-E-E-E-e-e-e-”
And it seemed to have the power of materializing whatever I
thought of— for instance I seemed to have been thinking of money, thus:
“M O N E Y —BE-e-e-e-e-e-e-e.”
First the sound was very abrupt, musical, and then fading out
gradually as the sound of a musical note, and, the peculiar thing about
it all was that the “Goddess” or being who spoke the word, came into
view and vanished as the sound came and went, with the “E E E E E E
e e e” resounding as the vision disappeared.
In meditating upon the vision afterwards I associated the word
“BE” with “Let there ‘BE’ light, and there was Light,” etc.
I had never before in my life thought of the single word “BE”
BE-ing such a marvelous word. BE there. BE now. Beeeeeee—
manifest. BE—materialize. BE—harmonious. Come into BE-ing.
BE Thou peaceful! BE Thou wealthy! BE Thou Blessed! “BE
TH OU M ADE W H O LE .”
“IN THE NAM E OF THE M IG H T Y ‘I A M ’ PRESENCE”
BE Thou and Thine the manifestation of “LOVE, W ISD O M AND
PO W E R ” in the pouring out of the “LIG H T OF GOD T H A T
NEVER FAILS.” BE E E e-e-e-e . . .
I shall endeavor at all times to see that none of my past teachings
in any way “creeps into the work of this activity.” I have returned all
private books and instruction to my former teacher of certain teachings that
might have not harmonized with the Saint Germain teachings.
I had instructions from another source— indirectly through the White
Brotherhood, I believe, to take up St. Germain’s work— the Universal
Brotherhood— as it is called, and since I was first associated with the
Theosophical Society in 1922— the old Society, in which Katumah was
active, New York City—not the Besant society— I am certain I am to
work with you Blessed People, and I look forward to being a worker in
the field for you or with you or wherever you see fit to place me. I am
particularly blessed with the “power of speech,” and I have been able to
do marvelous healing in several instances where it was deemed to be
essential. Some time I hope you will see fit to converse with me regarding
certain experiences I had, for I AM CERTAIN THE T IM E W IL L
COME W H EN I W IL L BE ABLE TO HELP YO U AND OTHERS
OF M Y FELLOW M EN VERY M UCH.
Washington is the Father of our Country— Lincoln freed the slaves,
but, as I have jokingly said in the past, “Now, it is up to ME to free the
55
LORD MAI TREYA
W H IT E PEOPLE.” (Reader please note this statement. I then knew
that I had been Lincoln, but I had to use the utmost subtlety in referring
to this). I have had some startling experiences with Abraham Lincoln—
so startling and unusual that I almost fear to mention them— but some
time I hope to be able to talk to you, M r. and Mrs. Ballard, face to face,
and when I do, at that time, I hope and pray to be able to manifest the
“Love, Wisdom and Power” now sleeping within my heart, which I am
sure, “WHEN M Y T IM E COM ES,” will be used for the benefit of
suffering humanity.
Thank you for your Blessing, and may the Blessings of the Ascended
Masters be continually upon you and your marvelous son, Donald, in
your Great W ork for the “establishing of the New Kingdom on earth AS
IT IS IN HEAVEN” with the Ascended Hosts of Light.
I send you love from the Eureka Minute Men’s Group—though small in
numbers— sincere in our work of Love.
On your receipt of this letter I shall expect a manifestation of Light
from your heart, M r. Ballard, such as you experienced with “my heart”
at the Shrine Class in Los Angeles. It was marvelous. I felt the Light go
from my heart to yours, and it astonished me when you immediately
mentioned that you experienced something in your heart you had never
experienced before. REM EM BER? God bless you and keep you. I
again ask thy blessing. I can see all the activities that had to take place in
various realms and spaces before I could actually consider myself “one
with you” in the great “St. Germain W ork.” There was QUITE A
SQUABBLE ON OTHER PLANES AB O U T ME AND WHERE
I BELONGED IN THE FUTURE W O R K ON TH IS PLANET.
(Students please note). I am thankful I know positively at last.*
Lovingly in the Light,
(Signed) NORM AN R. W E STFALL.
*In connection with ray mention of Washington and Lincoln in the above letter,
as well as other Lincoln episodes alluded to in other places in this book, I wish to tell
you something which proved most startling to me when I first learned of it.
A few days after my wife passed, while talking to Ave Maria, She informed
me that Dorothy (My Wife) had been the re-embodiment of John Wilkes Booth.
While Ave Maria was telling me this Dorothy was present and first asked Ave Maria
not to tell me the truth about it. But Ave Maria said: “Yes, I shall tell him, for he
should know the truth about it. It is an instance of the quick reaction of the law, and
th e w o r ld sh o u ld k n o w a b o u t it. I know now that you think no less of her because
such was the case.”
I was told by Lord Maitreya to include this note in the book, since it is proof
to me again that “whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.” You will recall
that just a few seconds before Dorothy was stricken she rather hatefully said: “One
of these days I’ll get a gun and put an end to the whole thing.” The full force of
her own remark reacted upon her that instant. Her statement precipitated her phys­
ical end, so to speak. I had wondered for years why she suffered so much. She loved
me, I know, and I loved her, but so frequently she would wail: “Oh, I feel so heavy
—I feel like lead. Oh, Norman, I just feel like I cannot go on.” Again she would
say, “I feel like I’m going insane.” Even years before David was taken from us she
56
CHAPTER V ili
The aim of this book is to actually “initiate” everyone who
reads it into the Great Temple of Light, Love, Wisdom and
Power of Almighty God through His Son, Christ Lord Mait-
reya, a Great Being whose Divine Office is Solar Christ to this
Universe.
The publishing of the letters herein produced is to prove
to any who might have the slightest doubt, that I state nothing
but the TRUTH and the WHOLE TRUTH. Even the tran­
scendental experiences I relate have also been experienced—
many of them—knowingly—by others with whom I was asso­
ciated. All of them, practically speaking, were witnessed—
even MY ASCENSION—by a woman who is the re-embodi­
ment of a Great Being whose own physical body is the focusing
of “The Jewel of the New Golden Age,” the “Bride of Christ,”
referred to previously in the “First Golden Age Manifesto of
the Great White Lodge” as “She Who is Nameless.”
Following is a letter to the Ballards, who were the chosen
Messengers of Saint Germain, having been written by me in
1938, which explains definitely my background so far as my
training and understanding were concerned at that time. You
would pass through the most sorrowful spells of suffering. And the more I tried to
help her the more it seemed to cause her to suffer.
I want the world to know I do not think any less of my wife because of anything
she might have done in any embodiment. I might have done just as bad or worse
things to her in some other embodiment. I know now that she ascended through my
help and others who are Ascended Masters. Had she not been willing to suffer she
would not have been able to “make good” and ascend. May she rest in peace, and
may the Love of Lord Maitreya and all the Lords of Light enfold her in their radi­
ance. She was an ideal mother, worked with me wholeheartedly for the incoming
Golden Age, and promised me when she w
T
as paralyzed that she would continue to
assist me in the Great Work I have to do on earth. God bless her.
Dorothy knew of my undying desire to work for Christ. She knew that I had
been given the name “AMSUMATA” by the Lords in charge of the Universal Broth­
erhood as early as 1930. She herself was a member of the Esoteric Brotherhood
and was a registered student under Master-Teacher R. Swinburne Clymer, Supreme
Master of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood as early as 1918. It may seem strange to you
but Lincoln as well as Booth were students associated, I have been told, with Pascal
Beverly Randolph, who was Supreme Master of the Rosicrucians as early as 1856.
57
LORD MAI TREYA
will notice how wholehearted was my sincere desire to help
humanity:
Dec. 1, 1938
Beloved Messengers, M r. and Mrs. Ballard:
Greetings and salutations— love, Wisdom, Power— and PEACE be
with you. And may the blessings of the Ascended Masters abide with
you always in your transcendent work for the good of humanity.
Somehow, I feel I am talking to you, Mrs. Ballard. I do not wish to
take too much for granted, in you knowing, instantaneously, my inner­
most desires and aspirations, however; but I am certain you will feel and
KN O W the sincerity of my appeal to you.
I need your personal help to aid me in the decision I made long ago,
even as a child, with myself and God—that I would never deny Him, no
matter what happened in my life, and that I would carry the LIG H T
to those who seek the LIGH T.
Numerous miracles, visions, light symbols, soul-conscious or higher-
mental body experiences, the revelation of some of my past embodiments,
etc., have proved to me, Mrs. Ballard, that I know the Truth, for I AM
THE T RU T H M ADE M AN IFEST. I HAVE BEEN U N U SU ­
ALLY BLESSED W IT H PROOF OF ALL YO U TEACH, or
that THE M ASTERS TEACH IN YO UR W O N D ERFU L BOOKS,
W IT H THE EXCEPTION OF THE ASCENSION. I know that
you will believe me; you M U ST believe me, for I must carry the
message—your message and my message—to millions of doubtful souls
in the world today.
I do not fear anything in the world. M y life was even threatened
years ago by a “Black” who said he came direct from the “head man.”
He said he would get me if I didn’t keep still.
In 1924 an unascended Master (really was ascended) came to me in
Olympia, Wash., from M t. Sinai in Arabia—Kelpa—who, in addition
to other teachers I contacted in the outer, taught me, wanted me to
carry on his work since he had told me he would soon be passing on
(which he did in Seattle). This man—Kelpa—who was John Dew, was
an instructor in Oxford University for 40 years—possessor of eleven
different degrees of higher learning—was the only man who ever proved
to me that he could actually transmute the baser metals (Alchemy) into
pure Gold. You probably know of him yourself.
I first contacted Theosophy — the old Blavatsky Lodge — not the
Besant group — in 1916 through a man, W m . E. Mullinaux, in the
Ozark Mountains in Independence County, Ark., having become a mem-
ber-at-large of the original New York Lodge, by recommendation of two
old members, in 1922.
I later studied 14 years under Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer, Supreme
Master of the old American Rosicrucian Order—the one originated by
Dr. Pascal Beverly' Randolph— a descendant of one of the signers of the
58
THE NE W G OL DE N A GE
Declaration of Independence— and he (Dr. Clymer) I do believe, came
nearer bringing the Light to the people than any messenger up until you
and M r. Ballard were “chosen” as bearers of the LIGH T. He stead­
fastly battled the Black Magicians, and, I think, helped make it possible
for the Light to come forth for you, me and others. Following my
studies with Dr. Clymer I contacted the U.B.— a universal brotherhood that
no doubt you know of. I received some wonderful teachings through this
source, indirectly from the Ascended Masters . . . and have received, at
times, instructions direct from Masters who appeared to me in their finer
bodies. They always taught me the higher laws regarding the “Light of
God.”
In a vision about fourteen years ago (in the higher cosmos) I was
told that this Cosmic Light that is coming about through you, Blessed
Messengers, would come upon the earth and become so powerful that
all evil would be dissolved on this planet. I was told that millions of
people would be eliminated, as it were, from this world, because they
will not be able to withstand the higher vibration of Light on earth, etc.
In classes I taught in Tacoma, Portland, Olympia, Centralia, and other
places in the Northwest ten years ago I told my students that the Masters
would materialize and come forth to teach the higher laws.
In 1928 when on a railway train going north near Mt. Shasta, on my
return trip from a tour of the United States, I sensed the heavenly perfume
of the Masters about the Mountain, and told my wife of it on my return
to Olympia. I knew, instinctively, there was at least one Master there,
anyhow.
Please bear with me, Mrs. Ballard, and hear my brief story, and then
you will know how and why I wish so very much to help you in this
Great Work. I might mention that I also studied the “I A M ” with
Chesley, who, as you may know, was a marvelous teacher in her day in
Seattle and vicinity. I have a little book she gave me in 1924, with “I A M ”
on the cover, “I A M the Light,” on another page, etc. You probably
have seen the little book.
I merely mention these various things because I want you to know
that I know the Truth from having studied it most universally as well
as having experienced it. When I first read “Unveiled Mysteries” almost
four years ago, which book was sent to me by my teacher in the U.B.,
naturally I recognized it right away as the true bearer of the Light, and
the unadulterated Truth as the Masters teach it. Had I not been per­
mitted by a Master to visit my own dear father after he passed on in 1925,
in my own higher body, and experienced the unspeakable bliss in the realiza­
tion of my own immortality, my own indestructibility, and the great joy
when I actually felt of that higher Body, glowing as it was with Light
and Power,— as I say, had I not experienced such a thing I probably
would not believe whole-heartedly in every word that you publish in your
books and in “The VOICE,” but I can truthfully say I have seen, and
59
LORD M A I T R E Y A
I do not but believe, I KN O W , and because I do KN O W , and because
I have studied every one of your books, over and over again, as well as
the “VOICE,” I hope you will realize my ability to speak freely of the
“I A M ” without having somebody dictating to me what I should say and
what I should not say. I mean there are two or three blessed students here
in Eureka, who think that because they have been studying for a couple
years they are in the position to dictate to all the leaders just what they
should do. This hampers the leaders and the growth of the work. God—
the Ascended Masters, St. Germain, and all the Hosts of Light know that
I believe in you, M r. and Mrs. Ballard, as the accredited Messengers of
St. Germain. I know St. Germain’s teaching is the NEW, U N AD U LT ­
ERATED CHANNEL TH ROUGH W H ICH THE LIGH T IS
TO BE CARRIED TO A LL THE W O RLD . Years ago, when I
was editor of newspapers in the state of Washington I prophesied the
coming of the Golden Age, I wrote an article one time— in 1931, in
which I said the time would come when people would not be able to
commit crimes or deceive people because what they planned in their minds
would be known before they carried it out. Last week in the new “VOICE”
I noticed the same thought is expressed. That day has come when people
can no longer deceive.
I have a program on KIEM here in Eureka, Mrs. Ballard, known as
“I A M YO U R FRIEND.” Now, I do not talk about the “I A M ” for
I thought some of the students would find fault right away. But what
I do wish you to do is to ask St. Germain if I might be a messenger, so
that I might be more free to speak of the Light, the Truth, the Ascended
Masters and you Blessed Messengers, even as my “I A M ” Presence
prompts me to express. As it is I feel hampered, and I am sure there is no
reason why I should not be able to express myself freely, as long as I
declare myself 100% for you, M r. and Mrs. Ballard, St. Germain and
the Ascended Master teachings as published in your books.
M r. Stickle was here for three meetings last week. He did a marvelous
lot of good for our local groups. I do hope and pray, Mrs. Ballard, that
you will grant me more freedom, such as He, M r. Stickle, has. I would
love to talk about the “I A M ” work as it is published in the books, on
my program. Mrs. M ary Todd, my confidential friend and student here,
suggested that I do this—that I write to you about it, for she thinks I
could do so much to broadcast the “LIG H T ” and start smaller groups
here in Northern California.
I can submit a copy of all talks I might give if you think it necessary.
There is great need of messengers in the field, Mrs. Ballard, and since
I have studied for many years with the intention of carrying the message
of Light to the world, I shall be one of the happiest persons in the world
if you can see fit to sanction my work.
I have asked M Y PRESENCE many times to carry my desire to
Your Mighty Presence.

THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Please answer me soon regarding this matter, and I shall immediately
set to work in real earnest. May the Peace and Blessings of the Ascended
Masters be with you.

You who read my reminiscences of these things, and my
lengthy correspondence with The Ballards, may know that I
realized how very busy they were, but you must understand,
My Beloved Friends of Light, that MY PRESENCE (SAINT
GERMAIN) was doing every possible thing He could in order
to get the Ballards to recognize HIM in this MY OUTER
BODY, but for some reason they could not see ME. I do not
blame the Blessed Ballards. I know now of even greater than
they—even Ascended Masters—who were fooled. This may
sound strange and unbelievable, but I shall relate later an instance
where this happened. You may know now, however, that it is
not so easy for any Master to follow a Spirit Body or Electronic
Body to the physical Body that Spirit uses. This is not hard to
understand when one realizes that the Spirit is Instantaneous.
There are many Ascended Masters re-embodied now. They
shall all be gathered together during the next nine years. Those
who do not BECOME WHITE AND ASCEND will, I am
sorry to say, become Black Masters, those who use their forces
destructively. Should they “turn black” they will be annihilated
or thrown into a “black compound” to await another evolution­
ary age or cycle. This may even be, so far as time in our outer
consciousness is concerned, a million years, before they will have
another opportunity such as now, when CHRIST STANDS
AT THE DOOR AND INVITES THEM INTO HIS
FATHER’S TEMPLE. The STARS IN THE HEAVENS
HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THIS. THE GOOD EN­
LIGHTENED ASTROLOGERS OF TODAY WILL EVEN
PROVE THIS TO YOU. However, do not dabble with
astrology. It is most dangerous to the average student.
About Christmas time, following the writing of the letter
above, I wrote a letter in the form of a Christmas Greeting to
Mr. and Mrs. Ballard, a copy of which I failed to keep. It was,
as I recall, a great out-pouring of Love from My Heart to
61
LORD MAI TREYA
them. Following is their reply to it, an answer I had not expected
at all:

Beloved One of the Light,
Love, Light and Blessings as of a Thousand Suns to you and yours
eternally sustained!
W e want to thank you for your expression of Love and appreciation
sent to us this glorious Christmas season.
Remember, that the Love of the students is the tool with which we work
and we always offer it all up to the Ascended Masters to amplify without
limit, and return it to you as that which is needed most for your Eternal
Victory and Freedom.
May the Love, Blessing and Light of the Great Host of Ascended
Ones, the Legion of Light and the Great Cosmic Beings enfold you always
unto your Ascension.
Lovingly yours in the Service of the Light,

You may understand, even as I did, that the heavy mail
received by The Ballards, hindered them, of course, from answer­
ing many of their communications immediately, and I am also
certain that but few of them were answered personally—I mean
comparatively speaking. So it was evident to me why I had not
yet received a reply from my lengthy letter to them asking for
more FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN MY TEACHING
THE PRINCIPLES OF THE “I AM.” Yet, I wrote another
letter in answer to their Christmas reply. It follows:

Beloved Messengers of the Light:
May your Individual Love, Light and Wisdom be multiplied each day
you work in the service of the Light with the Ascended Masters and the

glorify God in His Cosmic plan for the Love of all Humanity!

THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Your beautiful letter—wholly unexpected, but so greatly appreciated—
in answer to my Christmas letter to you, I prize as one of my treasured
keepsakes.
I did not answer it sooner because I know you Friends in the Light
are so very busy, however, the thought came to me, “Even though my
letter is never read, I may have the joy of writing it, and I K N O W my
thoughts and Love expressed in the letter W IL L GO TO THEIR
INTENDED DESTINATION, from M Y HEART, OVER M Y
O W N IN D IVID U AL LIG H T R AY T O THOSE I LOVE.” I have
proved this many times, and I K N O W it is true, our thoughts go out to
their intended destination on the W IN G S OF LOVE—W H ICH IS
F E E L IN G .
Mrs. Ballard, “I A M ” working on a very big business proposition,
for which I made a trip to San Francisco last week. Now, I know it is
not the proper thing to bring up such among the students in a Sanctuary,
but I was told by a student with whom I was talking personally, to at
least write you and tell you of the idea and ask your blessing for it, since,
if put into operation as I intend, will eventually put about 50,000 people
to work, and I have planned, of course, on putting as many “I A M ”
students to work as possible, for I know any 100% “I A M ” student can
be depended upon to be sincere, honest and industrious.
So, Mrs. Ballard, although I am, I believe, making great progress in
the physical octave as well as in the higher realms, I do sincerely hope for
your blessing. I am certain St. Germain gave me the idea, for I asked for
a plan whereby I could make use of what talent I have in printing,
writing, publishing, radio and newspaper work, (my trade and vocational
work) and the most wonderful thing about the idea is that all the things
in which I am proficient, dovetail together in the plan evolved. Should
I be able to put it over as planned it will be a wonderful publishing project
for the future of the “I A M ” era or Golden Age, for it has to do with
instantaneous record-finding of the inhabitants of America when and after
the plan is worked out and completed.
I hope I have not needlessly taken up your time, I am thankful for your
kind consideration in the past, and I sincerely hope for your future
Friendship in the Light.
May the Blessings of the Ascended Host ever remain with you and
yours, and I do hope to be able to see you sometime during the Oakland
Class, and if possible, talk to you a bit about the publishing project I plan.
I have made great progress in my class work lately, all of which I
am most thankful, and since we are to have Dean and Pauline Sunderland
here all next week, I am certain we are to have a great expansion in the
Eureka Sanctuary. Classes will be held at Eureka Inn, Feb. 7 to 12, Inc.
Lovingly in the Service of the Light,

Then I received a letter—a wonderful letter—from Mr.
Ballard himself dated April 6, 1939, in which he answered at
least three letters I had written him—ALL IN ONE BEAUTI­
FUL LETTER. This proved to me that Mr. Ballard was most
sincere, and when he found a student such as I, who was so whole­
heartedly interested in the “I AM” activity and the plan of the
Masters, he certainly did give him ALL THE ATTENTION
ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM SUCH A BUSY, BUSY
MAN. One could not help but love such a being. The letter
follows :
CONGRESS HOTEL
Chicago, Illinois
Norman R. W estfall April 6, 1939.
Central Hotel
Eureka, Calif.
Blessed student of the Light :
The answer to your most recent letter has been delayed because of the
great pressure of other matters requiring immediate attention and while
we are writing we feel it essential to make some comment regarding your
letter of October 28th. Please be assured before you read any further of
our love for you and of our appreciation of your sincerity and your
determined desire to be of the greatest possible service to the Light.
It is necessary also that we explain to you regarding what is to follow
in this letter, that we are in no way concerned about your private life or
whether or not you are obedient to the Law of Life in your private
activities. In connection with all such matters our only position can be
that we explain the Law of Life and cannot then be concerned whether
or not the individual is obedient.
However, when the safety of this work is involved, as is the case when
the individual is a group leader, then we must make sure that so long
as that individual is to receive our approval and support as a Group Leader,
they must have sufficient understanding and application of this Instruction
as will prevent them from leading the students astray.
W e notice that in your letters you still refer to “the old Alchemist’s
advice,” the “Universal Brotherhood,” “Kelpa,” the “Theosophical
Society,” “Dr. Clymer” etc., etc. W e are taking these names at random
from your correspondence just to illustrate the point that apparently you
have not as yet divorced your attention completely from older systems of
instruction. If you are to remain active as a Group Leader in this activity
it is essential that these things be removed entirely from your consciousness.
W e quoted a definite statement to this effect in our letter of October 21st.
If there are those among the students who still want to cling to these
old forms of instruction, which were so cluttered up with human concepts
and opinions as to still leave the students in relative darkness after all
64
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
of these years, then such students must of course have the privilege of doing
so, but it would be a mistake for us to allow such ones to continue as
Group Leaders.
This attitude is not taken on our own initiative, but is based on the
requests dictated by the Ascended Ones to definitely regulate this activity.
W e note your very great interest in something which you received
inspirationally in connection with the word “Be” and can only suggest
that when the students have been given the definite accurate instructions
of the Ascended Masters Themselves, instructions that are taken down
stenographically when given and then printed without any chance of human
concepts entering in, we cannot see how they would profit by giving their
attention to anything received “inspirationally” through any human channel.
Of course, it is understood that each true Inner experience is of great
help to the student on the path, but the danger is, on the one hand, that
they accept as true experiences things which are merely incidental or
spurious and on the other hand, that they place so great attention and
importance upon their own experiences that they fail to do the one thing
of most importance, the applying of the Ascended Master Instruction in
their daily life.
In your letter of December 1st you say, “I hope you will realize my
ability to speak freely of the ‘I A M ’ without having somebody dictating
to me what I should say and what I should not say.”
While it is quite true that no human being should dictate to you what
you should or should not say, yet it must always be borne in mind that
the Ascended Masters Themselves have requested that in the Study Group
Activity, never, under any circumstances shall any instructions be given
except as direct quotations read verbatim from the books and magazines.
It may be difficult for one just beginning the study of this work to
understand the perfection of that request, yet we can assure you that when
your understanding has expanded and your appreciation for the Per­
fection of the Ascended Masters’ own instructions has become adequate,
you will come into full understanding and agreement with it.
In answer to your question about the radio broadcast we must explain
that Saint Germain has requested that no one broadcast this instruction
over the radio except ourselves personally—a request which we must
respect until such time as He might give other instructions.
Messengers are appointed by Saint Germain alone. W e never under­
take to usurp such responsibility and it is our understanding that it is
not Saint Germain’s intention to appoint any more Messengers.
W e appreciate so much your great enthusiasm and your intense desire
to do your utmost to spread this Light, and we would not dim your ardor
for anything in the world, but we must call to your attention the need
for restraint.
From many expressions and attitudes indicated in your letters, we feel
sure that you have much to achieve in the way of understanding of this
65
LORD MAI TREYA
work and application of it in your daily life before you would be suffi­
ciently stabilized to undertake more than the carefully restricted responsibil­
ity of Group Leadership.
Again may we assure you that all of this is written in the most pro­
found love and gratitude to you for your love and devotion to the Light
and we know that as you continue with your diligent and dynamic
application to your own “Mighty ‘I A M ’ Presence,” you will be caused
to do all that is necessary in order to bring your mind, being and feeling
world into such full Obedience to this Law of Life that you may quickly
become a channel through which your own “Mighty ‘I A M ’ Presence”
and the Ascended Host can Bless without limit all with whom you come
in contact.
Our Love and Blessings enfold you always.

The above letter was dictated personally by Mr. Ballard, I
am sure, and the envelope in which it was mailed, which I still
have, was addressed in his own handwriting.

CHAPTER IX
For fourteen years I studied the Rosicrucian Mysteries
under Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer, M.D., Supreme Master of the
associated brotherhoods of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, such
as Sons of Isis and Osirus, The Illuminati, the Rose Cross
Order, The Magi and Priests of Melchizedek and the Aeth
Priesthood. There is no one of all the teachers I have contacted
in the outer world from whom I learned more than from Dr.
Clymer, and I always, during the many years I studied under
him, revered him greatly. I loved him greatly.
However, at times, I am frank to say, Dr. Clymer did not
understand me, and for a number of years, because of certain
questions arising, there was a feeling of enmity shown on his
part, evidence to me of my having transcended him in the field
of speculative philosophy. Finally, in 1938, after I had written
to him rather sharply because he had—I felt—discussed me too
intimately to another of his students—he wrote me that “he
wanted to hear of me no more.” This saddened me, so after
some weeks’ reflection of the matter, and realizing at the time
that I was not to be long in the outer activity of the world, I
wrote the following letter to Dr. Clymer:
Central Hotel
Eureka, Calif.
Mar. 24, 1939.
M y Blessed Friend:
May the blessings of the Masters of Light be upon you, and may their
Peace and Happiness abide with you. May the Wisdom, Love and Power
from the “innermost and uppermost” inspire you, and may your Light so
shine and expand that it reaches the “outermost and uttermost” points of
being and consciousness as a blessing to all whom it may touch. This is
the wish of "T h e Radiant One.”
“God works in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.” “Judge
not lest ye be judged.”
In our travels on our return to “Our Father’s House” we want
nothing left undone that we may do to hasten that long-sought-after home­
coming. In the glorious pathway that leads to those “Radiant Ones”
whose individual “Lights” ever grow brighter, as we travel on, may we,
67
LORD MAI TREYA
each of us, tread its blissful course unhampered by the least human mistake
that we might have made to with-hold the fulfilment of God’s Eternal
Truth.
I sincerely believe that my contact with you in this embodiment was
just as necessary to the fulfilment and unfoldment of your individual activity
as your contact with me was to mine, and IS to mine.
It is not possible, let alone probable, that I might minimize the
marvelous work you have done in this world, and in spite of certain
statements you might or might not have made to other students of yours,
I A M C E R T A IN it is to the best interests of both of us to remain
friendly helpers to each other. I cannot think that I ever had the least
thought of hate toward you, in spite of all I might have written you.
I beg nothing of you, Blessed Brother, because I do not feel the need
of anything you may have to offer me. Honestly. When I am at one
with my Soul, which has always, in this embodiment, been quite easy for
me to attain, once I desire it, I have invariably received instruction, and
it is probably even true that I have helped you more than you may guess.
I do not know.
Confidently, I believe my aid to you is, and has been, just as essential
to you as your aid has been to me. W hy shouldn’t it be that way?
As I look over the vast correspondence I have carried on with you
throughout the past fourteen years, I cannot help but realize that prob­
ably you were just about as much at a loss to know who I A M — in fact
more— than I have been unable to determine your place in the scheme of
things. Should we weigh the goodness in your correspondence and the
inspiration of my letters to you—measuring one against the other-—I dare
say mine would far over-balance yours. W hat is written IS written.
It is quite easy for me—looking at the drama of activities over the
above mentioned period of time— to observe that you allowed certain
entities influence you regarding me—and you wrote to me and others
accordingly. To say that you never made a mistake would be pure egotism.
Let us be thankful that all such misunderstanding has been consumed
in the true Light of Understanding (LO VE).
If nothing else, dear Brother, I wish to be your friend, T R U L Y
AND SIM PLY BECAUSE I TH IN K I CAN HELP YO U, and
by helping you I will be helping all mankind.
Please do not mistake my kindness and consideration for something
less fitting. Your Loving Friend in the Light,

It will seem strange to any who reads this correspondence I
carried on with Mr. and Mrs. Ballard, the preceding as well as
the following, not to ever have had an interview with either of
68
THE NE W GOL DE N A GE
them. I was never granted an interview with either of them in
my life. Those of you who study this correspondence carefully,
however, will find many essential points of the transcendental
laws of life explained, and you can get a good general idea of
what goes through one’s mind who is about to ascend. I was
near the point of ascending, one phase of it having been described
by me in the following letter:
M r. and Mrs. G. W . Ballard Eureka, Calif.
M urry Hill Hotel April 17, 1939.
Park Avenue, N. Y.
Blessed Teachers of the Light:
Your long letter of April 6 was and IS such an outpouring of your
love and kindly consideration that truly I feel that I can never repay
you for it but through becoming as true an example of humility myself
in the Service of the Light— “The Light of God that never fails.” Thank
you, Blessed Ones, for your Great Blessing.
You were, Oh, so considerate of my every question, and I assure you
that even before I received your letter, since it had been so long a time
since I had first written you— I had received your love and advice through
other and more feeling means.
I am trying with all my H E A R T to be just as obedient and helpful
as your letter indicated I should BE. Your love I return to you a
thousandfold. May the A L M IG H T Y GOD BLESS YOU, and may the
Ascended Host continually attend your every good and constructive wish.
I am enclosing herewith a prospectus of the new business I am under­
taking. The symbol— the geometrical part of it— came to me just a few
days before the Oakland Class in February. Where you see the GOLD
color I saw a radiant, dazzling Liquid-Gold that streamed through the
round disc and struck me in my heart. It almost overcame me, and I
had the most transcendent feeling of love I ever experienced in my life.
It seemed that all the beauty and love in the world was intensified and
magnified or concentrated right in that one round disc, and it became more
and more radiant until I could stand its radiance no longer— IN M Y
HEART. It was wonderful.
Please do not take the time to write in answer to this letter unless you
feel you should, but I simply had to write you of my appreciation for
your marvelous letter. Sometimes, you know, we feel inspired, and in
order to give expression to our love, we sit down and write to those who
are most in harmony with us. To me, Dear Ones, LOVE IS UNDER­
STANDING, and unless I can be with someone or write to someone
who understands, life seems so empty.
I have had a rather hard time to become adjusted to the “I A M ”
but ever since I first read the “Unveiled Mysteries” more than three
69
LORD MAI TREYA
years ago, I knew, more or less, of the N EW CHANNEL, and, since
I had never been able to fully conform to other teachings I had faithfully
followed, there was but one thing for me to do— BECOME ONE W IT H
YO U AND SAIN T GERM AIN.
You both seem so close to me at times— and you, Mrs. Ballard— I
received such a marvelous radiation from you in the San Francisco Sanctu­
ary the Monday night following the closing of the Class there— and I
felt the Light go out from me so powerfully— from my heart and from
my brow. (I was definitely conscious of the spirit of Saint Germain in me
at the time I referred to in the letter, and she, evidently saw my Higher
Presence radiating.)
I am writing to Dean and Pauline Sunderland. God Bless them.
May God bless you all, Sincerely,
(Signed) NORMAN R. W E STFALL.
* * *
The reference made to Mrs. Ballard having noticed me was
an instance in San Francisco in which she somehow was attracted
to me. She was sitting on the rostrum and I was near the back
of the large hall, nevertheless, she caught the radiance from my
aura somehow and we exchanged thoughts back and forth for a
few seconds. She did not realize that my Higher Presence was
Saint Germain any more than I did at that time.
I wish everyone to thoroughly understand how it is easily
possible for one to be such a Spirit as Saint Germain in one’s
Higher “I AM” Presence and still not be aware of it. We are
not aware of our Higher Presence until we consciously ascend
while in the outer body. I had ascended first in 1925, FELL, so
to speak, after I married, then re-ascended in consciousness,
bringing it through again to my outer body and consciousness
June 4, 1941. Understand, please, the re-ascension did not come
about suddenly. I was conscious of many many degrees of initia­
tions received on the inner planes during the interim between
my first conscious ascension and my last. And, I must also inform
you that I almost daily experience some phase of higher enlight­
enment and illumination, even yet, and I dare say I shall so long
as I continue in a physical body.
Mr. and Mrs. Mike Gallagher were messengers sent forth
into the field by Mr. and Mrs. Ballard. Mr. Gallagher had
encouraged me to start a group in Eureka in 1938, but somehow,
somebody had informed Mike of certain things regarding me
(whether true or false I do not know) which he did not fancy,
so he gave me a “cold shoulder,” so to speak, when he later came
70
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
to Eureka to lecture. He was quite rude to me in regard to my
being an usher at the Woman’s Club Hall. Consequently I had
to radiate a little light toward him while he was speaking to the
audience. This wholly upset him so far as his speaking that
evening was concerned. I simply directed the Light from my
“All-Seeing Eye” which I knew I possessed. I did it to protect
myself, not that I would have harmed him for anything. It was
an instance of where the quality he radiated out was multiplied
several times over and returned “to its source”—him.
I knew well then that I was to have a great part to play in
the “I AM” activity before it was finished, and I did not wish
to have anything inharmonious existing between me and any
student, so, in order to try to avoid undesirable feelings or trouble
of any kind in the future I wrote a letter to Mr. Gallagher and
sent a copy of it to Mr. Ballard. The letter to the Ballards I
quote first, followed by the letter to Mr. Gallagher, whom I hope
and trust is even my friend today, for I send out love to every­
one in this world:
M r. and Mrs. Ballard
Saint Germain Press
P. O. Box 1133
Chicago, 111.
Beloved Messengers:
M ay thou, “Governor of the Cosmic Light,” and thou, Blessed Lotus,
stand in the “Fullness of His Light,” The Radiant One, whom “I A M .”
(The first time I ever referred to my own Higher Presence to the Ballards.)
I am enclosing herewith a letter I felt impelled to write to Friend
Mike Gallagher. It is self explanatory, and I do hope it brings about
complete harmony between us, and I decree that “if I have done wrong
in this I call on the law of forgiveness for myself and all humanity, that
the Perfection of the Ascended Masters may come forth on earth and
remain eternally sustained.”
M r. and Mrs. Ballard, PLEASE, may I have an opportunity to see
and speak to you just a few minutes during the Shrine Class? I do feel
that I can Help Oh, so much, and I pray that you will permit me to talk
to you just a few minutes. I have worked hard for many years to bring
about the necessary perfection in myself to carry the Light to struggling
mankind, and all I ask is an opportunity to go out into the field and work.
I implore your advice and assistance in allowing me to “go forth” and
“blaze the Light” to those who need the Light. I K N O W I CAN
HELP VERY M UCH. There are thousands of small towns and villages
in the U. S. that I could work in, and I know there are thousands waiting
Eureka, Calif.
June 8, 1939.
71
LORD MAI TREYA
for me to call on them, for “I A M ” ready and I am willing to be a perfect
instrument through which the Ascended Masters can work.
Please permit me to see you. I ask it in the Name of the Mighty
“I A M ” Presence.
May the Blessings of the Ascended Masters be upon you eternally.
Yours sincerely, In the Light,
NORMAN R. W E ST FALL.

Again you will notice how untiringly I tried to get in touch
with the Blessed Ballards, but never could I get within a few feet
of them. One time during the Shrine Class in Los Angeles, when
there were thirty-three of us attended a banquet (Men Group
Leaders) at the Biltmore Hotel, I did get to shake hands with
Mr. Ballard, and he said, as we shook hands, “GOD BLESS
YOUR DEAR HEART.” Each one present was asked to say
a few words. The principal speakers were Mr. Ballard, Brother
Bill, Paul Stickle and Donald Ballard. The best speech of the
meeting was made by Donald, whom, I felt, was being controlled
by the Spirit of Saint Germain. I had no opportunity at this
meeting to speak to Mr. Ballard as I wished to.
Following is the letter written to Mike Gallagher, a copy of
which was mailed to Mr. Ballard:
M r. Mike Gallagher Eureka, Calif,
c/o “I A M ” Sanctuary June 8, 1939.
133 Powell St.
San Francisco, Calif.
M y dear M ike:
I want to thank you again—you and Ann (Mrs. Gallagher)— for the
marvelous service rendered the Eureka “I A M ” students. W e need
just such enthusiasm here among the students frequently, and I do hope
and DECREE that you will be able to be here for a whole week some­
time soon, for then you will be able to see just what we have accomplished
here. W e do have a very harmonious group of leaders, and I had not
realized there had been any inharmony among any students or leaders
until you alluded to such in your talk— and then, Mike, frankly, I felt
you deliberately acted coldly toward me, which, under the circumstances,
hurt me quite sharply. This is about the third time you have done this,
and it is my fear, that unless the cause of such personal feeling is consumed,
dissolved, annihilated— it might even cause both of us trouble in the future.
W ill you please tell me what it is so that I can do whatever is necessary
to eliminate such a thing, if such exists?
Mike, I am endeavoring to do the very best I can. I hold no grudges
against anyone. I send out love to all “I A M ” students, and to all beings
72
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
in all realms and worlds. Since I started as Group Leader here in Eureka,
following the written blessing of M r. and Mrs. Ballard, I feel that individ­
ually I have accomplished considerable.
I believe I have been responsible for getting more new students into
the “I A M ” than any other one person here. A few times when gossip
or something between some of the leaders— the cause of which I do not
even know— threatened inharmony— I do believe “I A M ” the one who
brought about harmony— BECAUSE I ENDEAVORED TO BRING
THE TROUBLE O U T INTO THE OPEN AND DISSOLVE IT
R IG H T THERE AND THEN. That is just what I want to do in
our case, Mike.
If there is any particular reason why you should act toward me as you
do— I W A N T T O K N O W W H Y AND I BELIEVE I HAVE A
R IG H T UNDER THE DIVINE L A W OF THE ASCENDED
M ASTERS T O DEM AND THIS.
I mean business in the “I A M .” It is no plaything with me. If there
is one insincere thought in my mind or being I hope it is instantly consumed
in the “Violet Consuming Flame of Divine Love.” I K N O W THE
LAW , MIKE, AND I BLAZE THE LIG H T TO ALL ALIKE. I
SEE THE LIG H T — I FEEL THE LIG H T — I K N O W THE
LIG H T —and I do not have to depend upon any personality for the
LIG H T OF GOD T H A T NEVER FAILS. But in my universal,
infinite, cosmic “I A M ” being I love all, and I realize my place in the
world of action.
And I K N O W that “I A M ” one who can help all who may come to
me for help, because I stand in the “fullness of His Light” which “I A M .”
Forgive me, Mike, if I have done anything for which you think I
should ask forgiveness. I call on the law of forgiveness for you, myself
and all humanity, that we may realize the fulness of T H A T LIGH T,
and thus aid A LL H U M A N IT Y in the realization of eternal harmony
for all mankind.
I do hope you can see fit to hold a week’s class here sometime. I am
sure all the leaders here will be only too glad to aid in every way they
can. Then I am sure any misunderstanding that might have accrued from
past incidents, gossip, misplaced words, or whatever it may have been—
will be cleared up. God bless you.
I will be at the Shrine Class, God willing, and I do hope to see you
there and have a little talk with you. W ill you permit it, Mike?
Lovingly, In the Light,
NORM AN R. W E STFALL.
(To avoid further misunderstanding, I shall mail a copy of this letter
to M r. Ballard.)
Mr. Gallagher did approach me and shake hands with me
on the evening of the last day of the class. God bless him.

CHAPTER X
At the time of Mr. Ballard’s passing, which was I believe on
the 29th of December, 1939, I was in the Central Hotel in
Eureka, alone in the apartment we occupied, when I felt a strong
urge to give some decrees or affirmations and prayers for Mr.
Ballard. I felt he was in dire need of assistance. My wife and
two of the children had gone to Los Angeles to attend the Shrine
Class of the “I AM.” I went into another room on the second
floor of the hotel where I felt more secluded and gave a number
of forceful decrees for helping Mr. Ballard, not knowing at the
time that he was passing from the physical plane.
Even after I got to Los Angeles, about the 2nd or 3rd of
January, 1940, I had not heard of the passing of Mr. Ballard.
It was some days after that even before I heard of it. Most of
the students about the Shrine Auditorium were living in great
expectancy. It seems that they thought Mrs. Ballard had some
great surprise for them. They had not been told of Mr. Ballard’s
passing. Later they found that she had expected “Daddy”
Ballard to materialize in his tangible body on the stage of the
auditorium and speak to the students. A few of the intimate
friends of the Ballards knew of his passing. Everything was
wrapped in much mystery and the people did not know what had
become of Mr. Ballard. Mrs. Ballard and Donald, her son,
went on with the classes, allowing the student-body to wonder.
In the meantime I had a strange experience regarding Mr. Bal­
lard which I later wrote about to Mrs. Ballard.
I was in one of my finer bodies on the inner planes. I stood
by a large framework of a temple. Just the skeleton of the build­
ing was erected, the studding, upright timbers, rafters, etc., and
a very good foundation had been built. While I stood there
silently, Mr. Ballard appeared on the scene, dressed much in the
same manner he usually appeared when speaking before the
student-body, a full white evening dress suit, with white tie,
diamond tie pin, etc. Mr. Ballard did not observe me standing
74
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
nearby, which proved to me that I was in a higher body than he.
Donald, his son, was with him, and he was very hurriedly explain­
ing to Donald what to do about finishing the structure he had
started. Mr. Ballard seemed to be in a very great hurry, and
after giving certain explanations to his son, which, I knew at the
time, had reference to the future development of the “I AM”
activity, he quickly passed through the framework of the build­
ing and disappeared. I thought he had passed the “Great Di­
vide.” I then approached Donald who was very busy working
about the foundation of the building. I asked, “May I help you,
Donald?” He replied, “No, I’ve got to hurry. I must put six­
teen inches of salt around the foundation of this building.” That
is all he said, and that is all I brought “through” regarding the
experience.
Now, that vision may mean something different to others,
but to me it meant that Mr. Ballard, who knew in his Higher
Body he was passing, wanted his son Donald to be in charge of
the “I AM” activity. He explained certain things to Donald,
which he may or may not recall in his outer mind, however, I am
certain he will recall them when the proper time comes. The salt
around the foundation signifies to me that Donald realizes his
inadequate training and development at this time to direct the
activity as it should be directed, but he looks well to preserving
the foundation of the work until such time as Saint Germain,
who was present, is able to come forth and assist him. I am sure
it was not Saint Germain’s wish that Mrs. Ballard take charge
of the activity, otherwise Mr. Ballard would have instructed her
instead of Donald on the future of the organization, which was
symbolized in the partially constructed building. I am also of
the opinion that Mrs. Ballard in her outer stubborn nature,
driving out of the organization all who did not agree with her,
due principally to her jealousy, so crushed Mr. Ballard that he
did not care to endure it any longer, therefore wished to pass on.
I dare say, too, that Donald knows whereof I speak, and I
believe Charles Sindelar also understands the case.
More and more I felt that I was to have a very active part
in the very center of the activity in the outer octave as well as on
the inner planes. I had written other letters to Mrs. Ballard
asking to be able to help her. The following letter I received
from Mrs. Ballard:
75
LORD MAI TREYA
THE BILTM ORE HOTEL
Los Angeles
M r. Norman R. W estfall January 30, 1940.
General Delivery
Eureka, Calif.
Blessed Student of the Light:
May the Infinite Powers of Light shower you and yours with Blessings .
and take you forward in the Light.
Replying to yours of January 14th, I do not find it possible to see you
personally. W ith the many duties I have to perform, the world conditions,
etc., it is about a man’s sized job, and personal interviews are out of the
question.
Since our Blessed Daddy is in the Ascended State, He together with
Saint Germain are watching over me and mine and these Activities, and
I am relying wholly upon my “Mighty I A M Presence” and Their Assis­
tance to guide and guard me and the work.
Thanks for your personal interest, and may your Light expand quickly
and lift you into your complete Freedom.
Always in the service of the Light,
EWB/BOM /L M RS. G. W . BALLARD.
* * *
Again you will see that I was refused an opportunity to see
Mrs. Ballard. I wanted to talk to her regarding a great number
of revelations I had received regarding the “I AM” activity,
and most of all, to assist her, because I knew she had more than
she could handle, which proved so within a few months after I
had written her.
The following letter to Mrs. Ballard, in answer to the one
just above, is quite significant, which you will notice:
Mrs. G. W . Ballard P. O. Box 548
Saint Germain Press Areata, Calif.
P. O. Box 1133 Feb. 11, 1940.
Chicago, 111.
Blessed “Mother” Ballard:
I return to you, “In the Name of the Mighty ‘I A M ’ Presence,” and
multiply to you a thousand-fold, all the Blessings you asked the Infinite
Powers to shower upon me, in your letter of January 30, 1940.
I realize how very busy you are, Mrs. Ballard, and do not feel at
all put out because you were unable to give me a personal interview.
However, I did contact you twice on the “inner levels” regarding the one
particular thing I wished so much to talk with you about. TH IS W A S :
76
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
regarding the picture of Blessed David. Everyone who has heard of
Him, and especially those who have seen His picture, want a picture
of Him. W ell, dear Mrs. Ballard, I do not want to deny them a picture,
I do not wish to sell them a picture, and I cannot afford to purchase
enough pictures to supply one-tenth the demand, so I wanted to ask you
if you would not help me solve this matter.
David was especially interested in precipitation and did manifest a
number of things, as it were, “out of the blue,” and this is an idea that
came to me regarding this matter of permitting everyone who desired a
picture to purchase one.
I have given Ratana (I A M TEM PLE in Los Angeles) the negative
of the picture of David that everybody loves to own. Would it not be
possible to allow her to start a “Temple Fund” from the proceeds accruing
from the sale of the pictures? I am sure there would be enough money
come in within a short time to construct a Temple large enough to accom­
modate all students at all classes in Los Angeles. The pictures, in various
sizes, frames and quality materials, will be very much in demand, and
there is, as you know, a very wonderful radiation from the picture.
Wherever that picture goes there will go “David’s joy and radiation.”
I feel that you should handle this, and I shall furnish you with negatives,
and every privilege within my power to grant, should you decide upon
anything definite.
* * *
I hereby give you full privilege to do with this matter whatsoever you
may decide for the good of the Great W ork in the Service of the Light.
Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Ballard’s reply to the above letter in which I had again
offered to help her in her activity from a little different angle,
I herewith quote:

P. O. Box 548
Areata, Calif.
Blessed One of the Light:
Thank you for your letter of the 13th, and check for $1.00 enclosed.
I have read your letter carefully and appreciate how you feel and the
situation as it is. However I cannot allow these pictures to go forth com-
77
LORD MAI TREYA
mercially, nor can we ask Ratana to take charge of such things, for with
the many students making the Ascension, the first we know we would be
swamped.
W hile we know a Radiation can be poured through a picture of this
sort, we prefer to wait until the pictures of them come forth in their
Ascended Master Bodies before offering them to the student body.
W e know you will appreciate the position it would place us in, AND
I A M SURE IT IS NOT SAIN T G ERM AIN ’S W ISH A T TH IS
TIM E. A ll attention must be directed to the protection of America,
and students must not have their attention divided until she is safe.
Please advise what you wish done with the check for $1.00 sent in for
this Fund, and please do not send in any to the Saint Germain Press as
indicated, for we cannot start such a fund.
Accept my deepest Love and Blessings and know I am doing that
which I know is Wisdom for all.
Sincerely in the Light,

The letter I reproduce, one I wrote about a month after I
had again been refused to help in any way whatsoever in the
“I AM” activity that I in My Higher Presence Saint Germain
had so LOVINGLY originated, planned and brought through
to the outer mind and activity of G. W. Ballard,—I say this
letter, which reveals to you and all the world the OVERPOW­
ERING desire I had to carry the “I AM” organization through
to the SPIRITUAL SUCCESS it should have been, I now
produce, as follows:
“GOD BLESS AN Y AND ALL W H O READ T H IS.”
(W ritten across top of page)
Box 548
Areata, Calif.
Mrs. G. W . Ballard Mar. 11, 1940.
Biltmore Hotel
Los Angeles, Calif.
Beloved Messenger of the Light:
May the Presence of Divine Love be with you at all times, and
Eternal Blessings attend you always.
Beloved Mrs. Ballard, I know you must have wondered—you as well
as Daddy Ballard— at my eternal persistence, but there is a DEFINITE
REASON.
I appreciate very much having received the long letters from Blessed
Daddy, which he knew to be vital to my training then, and I somehow
78
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
believe he knew more about me “individually” than he let me know.
If any other in the “I A M ” activity did know of my “Individual Presence,”
then I think it was you. Oh, Mrs. Ballard, believe me! I HAVE
SPOKEN T O A FEW PEOPLE OF M Y PAST EM BODIM ENTS
—PROBABLY A T TIM ES W H EN I SH OULDN’T HAVE DONE
SO. W e have all made mistakes. W e all need more and more discrimina­
tion, wisdom, and all the virtues of the Ascended Host, but, are there
none with whom we may speak of ourselves,” our heart’s cravings, our
plans for activity in the Light, for which I have definitely been trained
the past 20 years? OH, PRECIOUS MESSENGER, M RS. BAL­
LARD, FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS I HAVE
IM PARTED THE L I G H T TO EVERYONE W H O CAM E M Y
Ves, I may have made mistakes— definitely I made mistakes.
Who hasn’t ? But, Blessed One, I have stuck pretty close to the “PAT H ­
W A Y OF L IG H T ,” and TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED.
P L E A S E R E A D O N ! Last summer when I so wanted to see M r.
Ballard— before David ascended, I called several times to see Pat Krouse.
I went to the Biltmore Hotel again and again. I had had a vision of
David’s passing. Dear Mrs. Ballard, I do not want to go into detail what
I went through. I BLAM E NOBODY. I SENT YO U LOVE. I
SEN F D AD D Y BALLARD LOVE. I called on the law of forgiveness
for myself and all mankind. I would not allow myself to hate anybody.
I understand how the sinister force deals with matters such as I wished
to talk to you and Daddy about. I knew something was impending as a
result of my family association that might be avoided. IT W A SN ’T.
D AVID IS GONE, AND I A M SURE IF THERE EVER W A S
AN ANGEL ON EARTH BESIDES JESUS THE CHRIST, IT
W A S HE. I knew he was a Master when he was two months old. I
had definite evidence I was Abraham Lincoln 14 years ago, too. I have
had many proofs of it since and even others had proof of it. That is
what I wanted to talk to you and M r. Ballard about. No one knows my
Presence, I believe, better than I. By this I mean human beings. Of
course the Great Divine Director, Saint Germain, Jesus and the Ascended
Host know about me, just as they do every human being on earth. If they
do not know they can easily find out.
Now, dear Mrs. Ballard, you will understand why I have been so very
anxious to help you in every way possible. You will realize what a great
love I have for mankind; how I have always—especially since coming into
this embodiment—wanted to carry the Light to each and every human
being on earth. I can give you hundreds and hundreds of proofs of this
in magazine articles, newspaper editorials, radio talks, poems (OF
M INE) and other evidences of this undying desire to help all mankind.
Again, I offer you assistance in whatever way I may give it.
If you do not need my assistance in your direct activity, then, Mrs.
Ballard, I decree, in the Name of the “Light of God that never fails,”
79
LORD MAI TREYA
that you permit me the freedom to go forth, wherever my Presence directs,
“in the Service of the Light.”
This is all I ask, and I pray Thy Blessing, and the blessing of Saint
Germain, Jesus, Nada, the Great Divine Director, Sanat Kumara,
Beloved David, “Daddy” and all the Ascended Host.
I am, sincerely, your Servant in the Light,
A M SU M A T A NORM AN R. W E STFALL.

I received, in answer to the above letter, a very bombastic
letter from Mrs. Ballard, to the effect that if I didn’t settle
down and be obedient and quit making wild claims I was liable
to go insane, or something to that way of expression. I hap-
pended to leave that letter in my auto which I had lost to a
finance company in Eureka. When I went back to get it and
some other letters I had left in a small compartment in the dash­
board of the car they had been removed, therefore I cannot
publish the answer Mrs. Ballard wrote to me. However, she has
not written to me once since that time. I am not sure it was
because I look less like Abraham Lincoln than she looks like
Joan of Arc, or whether she feared maybe that Abraham Lincoln
might prove to be more popular than she, anyhow, she has never
seen fit to write to me again since. I have written to her a few
times, and even tried to call her in Los Angeles as late as October
9, 1941. This I do know, MRS. BALLARD CANNOT EN­
DURE TO HAVE ANY PERSON AROUND HER WHO
MIGHT COMPETE WITH HER IN ANY ENDEAVOR
WHATSOEVER.
Some years ago, Mrs. Westfall, who was not so gullible as
I regarding the Ballards and Ascended Masters, had definitely
expressed her opinion of Mrs. Ballard when Mrs. Katherine
Rogers, a beautiful singer, was “turned out” of the “I AM”
activity by her Highness the Governess. Mrs. Westfall frankly
said jealousy was at the bottom of the whole thing. Right she
was. This I now know. I do recall that immediately after Mrs.
Rogers was barred from the activity Mrs. Ballard ran a number
of short decrees (gems) in various places in the “VOICE” mag­
azine for getting rid of jealousy. That jealousy then developed
into a terrific blazing fire of fury which destroyed the REAL
“I AM” organization. Gradually the “WHITE ONES” were
either turned out or quit the organization. Eventually “SHAT-
80
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
TERING DECREES” and all sorts of “BLACK” activities
came forth, glaring evidences of the destructive tendencies of the
VAUNTED LEADER, Mrs Ballard.*
“Have no fear,” you Blessed Children of Light, who were
duped into following Dear Little Lotus. You shall reap your
rewards for your loyalty, no matter whom you remain with to
prove your loyalty. “Whatsoever you sow that shall ye also
reap.” “God is not mocked.”
I shall reproduce the answer to the letter that was lost—the
one Mrs. Ballard wrote to me in answer to the letter in which
I claimed to be Abraham Lincoln re-embodied. It will give you
a clear idea of what Mrs. Ballard wrote to me, since I answered
it most thoroughly and to the point. The letter follows:
Mrs. G. W . Ballard 1715 “J ” St.
Biltmore Hotel Areata, Calif.
Los Angeles, Calif. Sun., Mar. 31/40.
Beloved Messenger of the Light:
I received your letter the day I left for Oregon, and since I had
planned on publishing the small booklet enclosed, (LIG H T OF M T.
SH ASTA) I delayed replying until I could mail you a copy of it. You
are the FIR ST to be mailed one, for I wanted you to see it. I hope
there is nothing in it that you might find fault with, for it truly comes
from my heart, and I want, W IT H ALL M Y HEART, to help you
and Don and the entire staff in every way I can to carry the “L IG H T ”
to every one possible. I am sure “M y Presence” is close to me in this matter.
I have started a small center in Klamath Falls, Ore., (or rather,
Group) and have prospects of getting started in Medford and Grants
Pass. There are also several interested in the “LIG H T ” at Cave
Junction. I am sure I can do a lot of good in this way, and I hope the
work I have planned is not contrary to anything you might approve.
Of course I want to do what the Ascended Masters have denoted in
the books, and I realize that we must, if we are to be FREE, learn to
look to our own Presence. I have studied every book and every magazine
published—much of the dictated work over and over many times. I have
contacted you and M r. Ballard a number of times on the “inner levels”
regarding these things. This you may be aware of or not— I do not know.
About nine months ago I met you and M r. Ballard in a beautiful “field”
*In this I refer to the lower bodies of Mrs. Ballard, not her Higher Mental
body.—A u th o r.
81
LORD MAI TREYA
•
—a rolling pastoral woodland— a few trees here and there—several sheep
grazing peacefully thereabouts—wild flowers bedecked the hills— all very
wonderful; and we three talked of the “LIG H T .” A t other times I
talked to you and M r. Ballard alone.
Night before last I stood near M r. Ballard and Don. M r. Ballard
finished the foundation of a large building, and the frame-work was
“raised”— and everything exactly delineated. M r. Ballard informed Don
to “preserve the foundation,” etc., etc., and then disappeared. I stood
watching Don work for a few minutes, then asked him if he wanted me
to help him. He remarked: “I’ve got to get sixteen inches of ‘SA LT ’
clear around the foundation of this building.” And Don went on working
as fast as he could to get the work on the foundation finished.
Now, Beloved Mrs. Ballard, I have my own ideas about what these
things mean, but my head is not “turned” by any such matters, for I
have been accustomed to such things all my life. I even talked to our
oldest son, Norman, Jr., who is now twelve, before he was born. The
little booklet will probably let you know more of my real nature—which
— of course, I have had to keep to myself most all of my life. Anyhow—
REMEMBER TH IS— should Y O U and D O N ever need help from
O N E who has "no axe to grind” whatever— please call on me.
Believe me, Mrs. Ballard, I want nothing you have. As to my being
or not being Abraham Lincoln, that does not bother me one minute.
(TH E GREATER THE SOUL THE GREATER THE RESPON­
SIBILITY.) However, with the great number of incidents, co-incidences,
etc., on the inner as well as in the outer, that have taken place in my life,
it would be impossible for me to not think I was VE RY CLOSE to
“Honest Abe” or was Him, or He did and DOES “overpower” me—or
something— who knows? ASK SAIN T GERM AIN TO SOLVE IT.
Anyhow— let’s laugh it off. I believe you were more concerned about the
Abraham Lincoln phase of my letter than anything else. W ell, that was
not essential to me at all, and if you will kindly read the letter again,
I believe you will see that you were sidetracked a bit. The main thing is
to get the “LIG H T ” to humanity.
The “Letter of Love” in the back of the booklet enclosed was written
to M y Un-Ascended Master (RSC) in 1925. That should answer your
question.
Love and best wishes to you and Don and ALL the Staff,
NORM AN R. W E STFALL.
(A M SU M A T A )
P.S. I plan on lecturing on “Cosmic Light” in Masonic Lodges, as I
am a Mason. I am scheduled to lecture to the Areata Lodge next week.
I have done much lecturing since 1924 on all phases of “LIG H T .”

THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Should you answer this letter please address me to Box 161, Cave Junction,
Ore. “God Bless You.” (I am sending M r. Sindelar a Booklet.)— NRW .
* * *
On the back of the preceding letter to Mrs. Ballard I had
written with a pen the following: “Lincoln freed the slaves of
the South, but it is now up to us to FREE the so-called White
people.”
Mrs. Ballard did not answer the above letter. While publish­
ing the booklet, “Light of Mt. Shasta” at Cave Junction, I had
a very interesting little incident to happen. It happened at the
time, or just a few days previous to my having written the above
letter. I printed the booklet, of about twenty thousand words,
I guess,—at Cave Junction, a small village in southern Oregon.
While working there on the booklet I stayed at an auto camp
about a block from the post office building where the printing
office was located and the Illinois Valley News is published.
I had received quite an inspiration in writing the booklet, and
I felt sure Saint Germain was “with me” in the publishing of it.
However, I wanted to be sure the Forces of Light were support­
ing me, so I did what I often do as a matter of corroboration in
order to strengthen my own position. I got my Bible and opened
it at random and read the first verse my eyes fell upon. This
may sound a bit superstitious,- but it isn’t. There is a definite
“law” back of every such incident. I TURNED TO 10th Chap­
ter of Ezra, the 4th verse coming directly under my gaze, and
therefore I read: “Arise: for this matter BELONGETH unto
thee: we also WILL BE with thee: be of good courage
and do IT.”
Nothing on earth could have stopped me then, after getting
such a marvelous confirmation of my own conviction.
Another unusual thing happened about the time of Mr.
Ballard’s passing. It was in regard to the long letter he had
written to me—the one I mentioned as having been addressed
(The Envelope) in his own handwriting. I carried that letter
in the inside pocket of my coat for months. Even when I was in
Los Angeles for weeks trying to get an interview with Mr. Bal­
lard, I carried that letter with me. I was proud of that letter.
I had shown it to a few of my most intimate friends who were
students of the “I AM.” It was, as near as I can recall, about
the time my wife and two children left for Los Angeles to attend
the Christmas Class at the Shrine Auditorium in 1940 that I had
83
LORD MAI TREYA
read that letter over again, and before I put it into my pocket
this thought came to me and I penciled it on the back of the
envelope, which I now have before me: “EITHER MY LOVE
FOR YOU WILL BECOME YOUR TORMENT, OR MY
BLESSING THRU YOUR SILENCE, FOR NOW, THAT
I NO LONGER LOOK TO YOU, I RETURN TO GOD,
FROM WHOM I RECEIVED MY INSTRUCTION
BEFORE YOU. BEFORE YOU, I AM.”
I had so loved Mr. Ballard, but at last realizing that it was
impossible to have him know how much our work was to have
been accomplished together, I now KNOW it was MY
HIGHER PRESENCE that prompted me to write those few
words on the back of this envelope, A POWERFUL DECREE
FOR JUSTICE.
84
CHAPTER XI
It was, as you may recall, the 29th day of August, 1940,
that I contacted Mary the Mother of Jesus in a physical body
at Mt. Shasta. The following Sunday I returned there to get
more “LIGHT” regarding the things I had learned. I had writ­
ten other letters to Mrs. Ballard which I do not have copies of
in my files, and I had received one letter on the inner planes from
her, which I have alluded to in the following letter, as well as
other interesting phases of the “I AM” activity referred to:
Etna, Calif.
Mrs. Edna M. Ballard Sept. 2, 1940.
c/o Sindelar Studios
2600 So. Hoover St.
Los Angeles, Calif.
Beloved Mrs. Ballard:
M y last letter to you regarding the “Dove of Peace” and the letter
you— your Higher Body—mailed to me on the “inner,” was evidently
ignored. Please, M y dear Mrs. Ballard, call to your “Higher Mental
Body”—your Mighty Presence— to reveal to you THE ONE W H O IS
TO PRO TECT YO U DURIN G YO U R PRESENT TRIALS. Do
not take my word for it. Call for the truth to be made known. Guy W .
Ballard, in your presence and mine, on the inner plane, in beautiful
surroundings— a pastoral scene—told me to protect you. Do you not recall?
You, M y dear, do have and will have tests and trials until you ascend.
True love is but complete understanding—WHOLENESS. Do you
understand me? Would you judge me? Please be careful in your
judgments.
Now, please believe me— I plead with you—once more—when I tell
you that I was with a Master—whose identity I cannot reveal—just last
Friday— in person— in a tangible bod}'— at M t. Shasta—who asked me
to write to you.
M y son— BELOVED D AVID — is with Koot Hoomi and Sanat
Kumara—particularly with Koot Hoomi. Koot Hoomi, in the presence
of the other Master, told me many things I am to do during the next two
months. Donald, your son, is the Spirit of the “I A M ” activity in the outer
octave. During the next twelve months the great change will take place.
You called to Mt. Shasta recently, so this Master told me, for some
Master to come and speak from “the platform” to your students. Should
85
LORD MAI TREYA
such a Master come—would you be able to recognize H IM ? Please do
not judge others. The masters—yes, THE M ASTERS— are much closer
to you than you may realize, possibly. However, I do not wish to judge you.
REMEMBER I have written you in the past, “If you ever need
assistance please do not hesitate to call me.” It was Master Root Hoomi s
desire that I write you. Following the ascension of my son David, I had
much to do with the “passing” of your husband, Guy W . Ballard, and there
are certain “connections from the past” that must be balanced.
Please believe THE M ASTERS whom I have contacted but during
the past week— even the Lord (CH RIST) Maitreya—whose loving
embrace I am not worthy to claim (yet He embraced me)— do not believe
me for myself, but TH EM — and K N O W that they are with you, but
I A M He who would protect you.
Lovingly,
NORM AN R. W E STFALL.

As you may guess, I received no reply from this letter, and
all the time the students, under Mrs. Ballard’s direction, were
decreeing that the Masters come forth in tangible bodies to speak
to them. She—bless her heart—did not then realize that most
all the Ascended Masters have physical bodies right here on
earth. This is where the “Kingdom is to be established,” and
here is where the Masters are, to DO THE WORK.
The statement in the above letter, “During the next twelve
months the great change will take place,” I wish to explain to
you. At the time Master KH had made the statement to me I
did not know just what was meant. There had been much talk
among the “I AM” students due to the Ballards’ teachings of
a coming cataclysm. This I had thought might be what was
alluded to in the “great change.” But it was not. The great
change that did take place was IN ALL THE GREAT SOLAR
AND PLANETARY OFFICES OR PLACES HELD BY
THE GREAT LORDS, ARCHANGELS AND GODS WHO
GOVERN THIS UNIVERSE. Then, the great war in Europe
took on a much worse manifestation, due, we might say, to the
cosmic and inter-planetary changes above referred to.
In most prophesies we hear in the outer world there is some
basis in truth from which they originate. Frequently I see the
underlying truth of otherwise meaningless rumors. For instance,
if you recall, there was a great change expected on the 16th of
September, 1936. That great change did actually take place and
was given wide publicity on the front pages of the leading news-
86
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
papers of the world through the Associated Press. The matter
had to do with a statement from the Pope of the Roman Reli­
gious Hierarchy or Roman Catholic Church. I do not say that
the canon that came from the ecclesiastical head was “good,
bad or indifferent,” but I am certain that it was a turning point
in the history of the world from the standpoint of the empiric
powers in this world. The present war (1941) is the result of
the stand the Roman Church took at that time (1936). In this
connection here I shall not go into this subject, but in a later
chapter, when world conditions, religions, economics and phil­
osophies are explained and remedies offered, I shall discuss the
important part the Roman Catholic Hierarchy plays in the
GREAT CHANGE now taking place in the world of affairs.
As Lord Maitreya has said to me, “EVERY SOUL MUST
BE SAVED.” All peoples of all the great divisions of the
world—all races and all religions—all states and all nations—
MUST SEE THE ONE GREAT LIGHT.
Surely the time has come when the Great Religions of the
world will SEE THE LIGHT. It is pitiful when we look upon
the sad affairs of the outside world. Why do people, religions,
fraternities, nations and races fight over things? The FATHER
OF ALL LIFE certainly does not want us eternally fighting
over earthly things. We so hope that the world at this time,
with its wonderful spiritual leadership, will SEE THE LIGHT,
and through their Spiritual Illumination and Intelligence build
up a WHITE BROTHERHOOD so much more powerful in
real UNDERSTANDING than anything Mussolini, Hitler
or any other dictator could possibly imagine, that all empiric
power shall realize itself absolutely impotent in creating anything
but the everlasting WHITE SPIRITUAL HIERARCHY
ON EARTH, WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE
THIRD GOLDEN AGE.
Once the Great Leaders of the World realize how the Great
Brotherhood actually directs the affairs of this planet, then they
will see how simple is the means of directing an economic system
that will supply every needy soul on this earth with everything
essential for its gradual development and eventual full illumina­
tion. Did love reign in even sixty per cent of the souls on this
earth HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO SUPPLY THE
MEANS TO CONTINUAL HAPPINESS IN THIS
WORLD!
87
LORD MAI TR EYA
When we, in our individual selves, recognize the ONE GOD
and invoke the direction of HIS SON, THE UNIVERSAL
LORD and KNOW CHRIST IN OUR HEARTS, we shall
not want to buy and sell and make profit on the supplies God
has given his children here on earth. Isn’t it simple? Then,
instead of having Charity Societies, we shall all “LOVE ONE
ANOTHER” as Jesus admonished us to do, and what is pro­
duced in the world will be “OURS” instead of “MINE.” How
silly the majority of human beings are, with all their vaunted
intelligence! As Cain said, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” Every
selfish person, even today, is apt to ask of you, “AM I
MY BROTHER’S KEEPER?” GOD KNOWS YOU
SHOULD BE.
Oh, Brother Mine, you who long for peace and brotherly
love to reign throughout the world, look deeply into your heart
and ask Christ Lord Maitreya to speak to you. He WILL.
I AM HIS REPRESENTATIVE IN THIS EARTHLY
BODY. I have spoken the Spiritual Word into the ethers of
this planet, and I KNOW that each and every sincere heart does
hear MY VOICE. Henceforth you shall have no excuse to say,
“I do not know the truth.” I have spoken the truth into your
heart. Now, should you not heed My Voice, you shall be cast
out into utter darkness, for this is the end of the present world
cycle, and you are given this “LAST WARNING” to turn within
and listen for the “VOICE” of Christ in your heart. “Lo, I AM
with you always.”
I HEAR THE BELLS OF FREEDOM RINGING FOR
ALL THE WORLD AND I KNOW THE BROTHERS
OF THE GREAT WHITE LODGE, WHO ARE GOD’S
TRUE SONS OF LIGHT, NOW HOLD THE BALANCE
OF POWER ON THIS PLANET. SOON ALL SHALL
REALIZE W H AT I SPEAK. THE WORD OF AL­
MIGHTY GOD RULETH. CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD,
IS HERE TO BLESS ALL MANKIND. CHRIST IS GOD
INCARNATE. CHRIST MEANS THE EARTHLY SON
IN ALL LIGHT AND ILLUMINATION. MY LIGHT
I RADIATE TO ALL THE WORLD. I AM COME TO
THOSE WHO SEEK ME. I BLESS ALL WHO HAVE
FAITH IN HIM (M E ). ALL IS NOW REVEALED.
THE LIGHT OF CHRIST DISSOLVES ALL DARKNESS
FROM THIS PLANET. EVEN THE LEAST SHADOW
88
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
UPON THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT BEING SHALL
VANISH BEFORE THE LIGHT OF CHRIST. EVERY
SOUL SHALL BE GARNERED INTO THE GRANARY
OF GOD, THE FATHER. HE NOW CALLS ALL HIS
CHILDREN HOME AGAIN. OUR HOME IS THE
GOLDEN AGE. OUR HOME IN GOD IS THE HIGHER
CONSCIOUSNESS OF TRUE BROTHERLY LOVE THAT
IS THE RULING PRINCIPLE OF THIS GOLDEN AGE.
AGES WE HAVE LABORED FOR THIS HARVEST.
NOW WE SHALL REAP. NOW THE SONS AND
DAUGHTERS OF GOD SH ALL KNOW TH EIR
FATHER, AND THEY SHALL RECOGNIZE ME AS
HIS SON WHO HAS COME TO SHOW THEM THE
WAY UNTO EVERLASTING LIFE.
THE LORD IS WITH YOU WHEN YOU CALL,
EVEN BEFORE YOU CALL. LORD MAITREYA, IN­
STANTANEOUS IN HIS UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE
AND LOVE, ENFOLDS YOU IN HIS LOVE-LIGHT
THE INSTANT YOU THINK OF HIM.
89
LOVE AND LIGHT
Come away from the crowd to my Temple Hill,
In the land where my Soul dwells apart;
And there let your Soul with Divine Love thrill
From melodies deep in your heart.
Both Love and Light does this Temple fill,
As we gaze on a scene so grand;
The earth’s all in tune with God’s Own Will,
And He leads us by the hand.
Oh, the sky is blue, and the ocean, too,
And Love shall reign Supreme;
While the troubles of Man, since our World began,
Seem to us but a troubled dream.
—SANNIKRA.

CHAPTER XII
Teachers of the truth are numerous, but few possess the
silent wisdom to prove they have the faith that works. When
we talk loud of our own knowledge we should feel ashamed
for the modicum of demonstrable learning we actually manifest.
A wise man once wrote, “Those who talk do not know; those
who know do not talk.” What wisdom! An ancient teacher
said, “Be still and know that I AM God.” And the wisest of all
teachers said of His own closest followers : “O, ye of little faith.”
Yes, it was Jesus who said that. When we read of the awful
time Jesus had to get his closest disciples to understand his simple
teachings, I don’t wonder that there are many Gods walking
among us today who have to have another God to tell them of
their own illumination. “Know ye not that ye are the Temples
of the Living God?”
It takes little faith to make money. It requires little know­
ledge to build a material house. With a little confidence you can
memorize volumes of wise sayings of others, but it requires faith,
knowledge, confidence, hard work and UNLIMITED SACRI­
FICE to build a Spiritual Temple. IT REQUIRES THE
WHOLE MAN. For this reason that wise teacher, Jesus, said,
“Ye cannot serve two masters.”
Too many of our so-called wise men of today—would-be
teachers—are hard at work trying to serve two masters. They
accomplish neither. They love to talk about God, Jesus Christ,
the Truth, and repeat the beautiful sayings that were coined by
our wise, good teachers of the past, but when it comes to actually
manifesting the least of those good works they prove to have
very “little faith.” They deny themselves nothing. They sleep
in soft feathery beds, sit in over-stuffed chairs, take joy rides in
their luxurious chariots, and occasionally spout off a few ancient
phrases that are certain to tickle the ears of their hard-hearing
devotees. They are paid much more than “forty pieces of silver.”
Jesus loved His enemies, but He spoke burning words in
condemnation of the “money-changers” in the temple. He was
no coward. He hewed straight to the line of truth and “let the
chips fall where they would.” There was no sham about Him.
91
LORD MAI TREYA
He spoke not words to please people; He spoke the spiritual
words of the Father to displease the hypocrites. He said: “I come
not to bring peace but a sword.”
That sword is here now. It is splitting the world in two.
On the one hand you have the “Money-Changers,” on the other
you have the true seekers of the law of spiritual truth. As our
possession of the truth increases, our love of material wealth
decreases. When we get tired serving one “master” we naturally
turn to the other.
As Kipling has said in his prophetic “L’Envoi” :
“And only the Master shall praise us,
and only the Master shall blame;
And no one shall work for money,
and no one shall work for fame;
But each for the joy of the working,
and each in His separate star,
Shall draw the thing as he sees it
for the God of things as they are!”
The ancient prophets, after having written all the books of
the Old and New Testament, and St. John, after having written
all the other chapters of the Book of Revelation, in the eleventh
verse of the last chapter in the Bible, wrote:
“He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he who is filthy, let
him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and
he that is holy, let him by holy still.”
And he goes on to explain that each shall be rewarded accord­
ing to his works. “And let him who is athirst come (meaning the
water of life).” But in no place in the Bible were the teachers
advised to judge their brothers and tell them they had to do this,
that or the other thing. It was left up to the individual, once
he was told of the truth, to choose for himself what he would do.
The command was, “Go, teach, preach, heal, etc.,” that the
people might know of the truth and the “truth will make you
free.” But a man who changes his mind “against his will, is of
the same opinion still.” Should you know the law of righteousness
and break that law, do you think you will not pay, and pay dearly?
Have you a conscience?
Your conscience is your guide. Your conscience is the law
of right and wrong whispering to you, as you know the law.
When you break that law within your own mind, you pay. Should
92
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
you break the same law again and again, you reap what you
have sown again and again.
Once you learn to analyze your sorrows, your aches and pains,
your reverses and tribulations, you will have learned the site of
your trouble. There is little learned without error.
Some folks are so good they’re good for nothing, and others
are just mean enough to be good for something. “He who hath
not sinned, let him cast the first stone.” “The blind” have been
leading “the blind” for a long time.
It is a grand thing to teach the truth, but it is a dangerous
thing to command the truth of a man who knows not the law
of righteousness. Many a man is asked to drink the truth before
he has had his fill of error. Most people yet eat the “husks”
and live in darkness.
At this time, as many authorities of the transcendental have
intimated, we are at the close of one of the great world cycles.
The great Mahatma Koot Hoomi, no doubt the FATHER, so
to speak, of all Masters now embodied, has told me the time
is very short before the “clearing of the landscape” shall take
place. And I know he meant that all “dark and shadowy
Brothers” on this planet, who have not hearkened to the
“VOICE” of the Almighty, shall be “wiped out.” This is the
time when the BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF LIGHT
shall KNOW they hold the balance of power on earth. The
LIGHT of their very souls IS THAT POWER. The terrible
destructive diseases, electrical vibrations of a cataclysmic nature,
poisonous germ cultures the Germans have developed for future
use, war machinations beyond the human mind to conceive, and
all such things the Black Forces may use in order to hold the
balance of power on this planet,—none of these things will affect
the TRUE BROTHERS OF LIGHT, for the Light, Love,
Wisdom and Power—ALL IN BALANCED PERFECTION
IN THOSE WHO LOOK TO CHRIST LORD MAITREYA
—shall be securely protected. The trying years of the GREAT
TRANSFORMATION shall not harm HIS FOLD, THE
CHILDREN OF LIGHT. BY 1951 the KINGDOM OF-
GOD SHALL BE WELL ESTABLISHED ON EARTH
AND HUMANITY—WHAT IS LEFT—WILL UNDER­
STAND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE GOLDEN AGE
ESTABLISHED ON EARTH.
Just last week a Brother placed in my hand a book, “Letters
of Occult Meditation,” under the authorship of Alice A. Bailey,
93
LORD MAI TREYA
first published in 1922. The letters therein published are pur­
ported to have been dictated by The Tibetan Teacher, to whom
the book is dedicated. As I started to read the book—even the
first paragraph—I sensed the Cosmic Fatherhood of Mahatma
Koot Hoomi. So, my dear reader, to me, Root Hoomi is the
Tibetan so many people refer to, and I dare say you will ulti­
mately find that my intuition is correct. I feel certain, too, that
my beloved teacher, KH, will not, at this late date, object to my
revealing his true identity. Many names and many “faces,” many
titles and many “places” lay claim, as it were, to the Great Cosmic
Beings who have so very much to do with the directing of the
Light, Love, Wisdom and Power to the Truth Seekers on our
earth at this time of Great Change.
In this connection I wish to quote from Alice Bailey’s book,
page 197, second paragraph:
“A t the same time you will see the misuse of those powers— a
misuse that will herald in one of the final struggles between the Lords
of Light and the Lords of Darkness. Great will be the cataclysm and
terrific the disaster, but ever the Light shines in darkness, and He who
reigns above all, and Who holds all within the circumference of His
Aura knows the hour of opportunity, and knows too how to utilize
that which can protect.”
Regarding the cataclysm alluded to above, Lord Maitreya
has told me that such will not be as most so-called prophets might
think. He emphasizes the need for all Children of Light to
remain calm and serene, and “fear not” whatever may come
about. He said, “EVERY SOUL MUST ULTIMATELY
BE SAVED.” He called last June, 1941, on all the Lords of the
Rays and all Gods who have anything to do with this earth and
the direction of such world changes, to AVOID A WORLD
CATACLYSM. It was avoided. The most destructive phase
of the present World War, which actually took place this last
summer between the Fascist Hordes and the Communist Legions,
actually, so to speak, prevented the world cataclysm that was
about to burst forth.
When one of universal understanding looks upon the world
changes, he realizes that the war in Europe, in a sense, LET
OFF ENOUGH OF THE VIRUS OF POISONOUS HAT­
RED THAT HAD GENERATED IN THE EARTH, to
prevent the kind of a world cataclysm the people who were
aware of its approach had expected. Again, when we look at
that terrible spectacle itself we cannot help but consider it of
94
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
cataclysmic proportions. Even thus far it is estimated that no
less than five millions of human beings have lost their lives, and
yet there is no apparent end of the strife in view. Truly the
Whites and the Blacks are warring with each other in that con­
flict. The Masters of physical wealth and power are battling
with the Masters of Light and Understanding. Many are the
sacrifices made on each side, but the ultimate victory will remain
with the WHITE—those who seek Brotherly Love and its pro­
tective Light that shall ESTABLISH THE GOLDEN AGE.
Here I shall tell you something that will amaze you, I am
sure, even more than it did me. Early last spring while I was
in Bremerton, Washington, I know of an Ascended Master who
was sent on the most peculiar mission I had ever heard of. The
Mighty Logos of this world had decided that it was time to take
a physical body on earth for the explicit purpose of aiding in
establishing the NEW LAWS OF THE GOLDEN AGE. The
Lords in charge of this phase of the transcendental duties they
perform for humanity had been watching for some time for
proper parents to be chosen, through whom this GREAT BEING
might be born into our earth world. Such parents were discovered
in a small town in the state of California. The Ascended Master
I know—one whom I had been fortunate enough to receive
instruction from—was sent by the Higher Lords to that Cali­
fornia town. He was told to go to the public library there, where
he would see a young couple who visited the library each evening.
The young mother was said to be with child. They were just
normal, middle-class people, but of high ideals and they were of
the opinion that a mother expecting to give birth to a child should
be given every consideration so far as environment was concerned.
Each evening they carefully selected the best of literature. Even
what an expectant mother studied and thought had a great bear­
ing upon the child to be born, so these young people believed.
Little did they know that the Universal Lord was hovering over
them, guarding them, loving them, and inspiring them to do the
very things they were so joyous in performing. And little did
they dream there was actually an Ascended Master right there
in the library with them for weeks each evening when they went
there for relaxation and study. Think of it, Beloved Friends of
Light, what great interest the Gods do take in the present affairs
of the world changes taking place on our planet. No wonder
the earth is no more a Dark Star but a Blazing Sun. Astrologi-
cally we are receiving the transcendent FAVORS OF THE
95
LORD M A I T R EYA
COSMIC LORDS. AWAKE BROTHERS! AWAKE SIS­
TERS! REALIZE THE TRUTH I NOW GIVE UNTO
YOU. IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD NOT TELL YOU.
The Blessed Age we have dreamed of for ages, for centuries
and centuries, is now upon us. Things are taking place—events
are happening to us and our planet that visit us but once in hun­
dreds of thousands of years as we see and understand time. And
still the so-called Masters of Darkness battle to keep the world
in the same darkness we have endured for all those centuries.
They boast of their ancient monuments—a few hundreds of
years old—like little children boasting about pretty marbles.
I smile when I think of them. The other day Lord Maitreya
spoke to me of the coming two thousand years as though it were
a two-weeks vacation. He told me of changes that will take place
during that time. He mentioned various ones who will be
re-embodying to assist in governing the people of this world
during the Golden Age. Things that may even disturb other
Lords that I have seen and know are so thoroughly understood
by Him from their Cosmic Source to their realization in extrinsi-
cality that He is ETERNALLY THE SERENE MASTER
OF ALL WITHIN HIS SOLAR RING, ABOVE TIME
AND SPACE AND MOTION, THE DIVINE DIRECTOR
OF ALL ACTIVITIES, ESOTERIC AND EXOTERIC, OF
THE SPIRIT AND OF OUR LIMITED EARTH WORLD.
I call to all who seek the Light. Call for the WHITE
LIGHT OF PURITY TO ENVELOP ALL BEINGS OF
THIS EARTH. AND KNOW, BELOVED BROTHERS
OF LIGHT, THAT THE CHILD IS BORN IN THE
UNITED STATES THAT WILL BE THE GREAT ONE
TO LEAD ALL PEOPLES OUT OF DARKNESS INTO
EVERLASTING LIGHT. That child, born the 25th of last
June, will be the one, WHEN BUT TEN YEARS OF AGE,
who will actually be so wise that the officials of the United
States will heed his wisdom and a “little child shall lead them.”
In 1951 that child, who will have been under the direct radiance
and instruction of the Masters of Light, will come forth to teach
the people of this world. HE WILL MANIFEST SUCH
LOVE, WISDOM and POWER THAT HE WILL BE
ACKNOWLEDGED AS A GOD INCARNATE ON
EARTH.

This is the time, Beloved, when such things shall come to
pass. Even today the Gods do walk among us. They are here
to show you the way. Believe. Have faith. Seek the Light.
Learn of the Wisdom of the Great Masters. Look about you
and KNOW that Christ is here again. Walk in His Light, call
to Him and He will come and “sup with you, walk with you and
talk with you” of the marvels of God’s Kingdom now enfolding
us IN OUR HEARTS, IN OUR MINDS, AND EVEN IN
OUR BODIES. CALL TO LORD MAITREYA THE

IT ’S UP TO Y O U !
Figure it out for yourself, my lad,
You’ve all that the greatest of men have had;
Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes,
And a mind to use if you would be wise:
W ith this equipment they all began,
So start from the top and say, “I can.”
Look them over, the wise and great,
They take their food from a common plate,
And similar knives and forks they use,
W ith similar laces they tie their shoes,
The world considers them brave and smart,
But you’ve all they had when they made their start.
You can triumph and come to skill,
You can be great if you only will.
You’re well equipped for what fight you choose;
You have arms and legs and a mind to use:
And the man who has risen great deeds to do
Began his life with no more than you.
YO U are the handicap you must face,
You are the one who must choose your place.
You must say where you want to go,
How much you will study, the truth to know;
God has equipped you for life, and He
W ill help you decide what you want to be.
Courage must come from the soul within
For to man has been furnished the will to win.
So figure it out for .yourself, my lad,
You were born with all that the great have had:
W ith your equipment they all began,
Get hold of yourself and say: “I can.”
—Anon.

CHAPTER XIII
It was during the month of October, 1940, that I began to
receive much instruction direct from the Ascended Masters at
Mt. Shasta, as I heretofore stated. Jesus, Ave Maria and
Mahatma Koot Hoomi were teaching me for some time before
I was able to bring through to the outer plane clearly and defi­
nitely their personal or individual radiance and form outline. I
was so amazed, so enthralled, by it all that I would sit for hours
without hardly moving or uttering a word. The most feeling
aspect of these periods of instruction and radiance, of course,
was the LIGHT and SPIRIT about us when THEY appeared.
I had never been interested in spiritualism so-called, but had
been a student of occult knowledge and training all my life. I did
understand the modus operandi of the mediums with their con­
trols, etc., but I knew that ordinarily mediums do not bring
through very high and constructive knowledge and information.
A medium, in other words, can not bring through knowledge
or Light-Radiance higher than their bodies and minds can with­
stand or understand. For this reason it is best for any student
of higher occult knowledge not to dabble in spiritualism. At
times Masters do use bodies of near-masters, but, unless mediums
KEEP THEIR BODIES IN PERFECT HARMONY
MORALLY, PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY, THEY
ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED BY THE HIGHER MAS­
TERS, FOR THE BLACK FORCES HAVE ACCESS TO
THEIR BODIES AND OFTEN ENTER AND GIVE
DESTRUCTIVE TEACHINGS AND ARE LIABLE TO
BRING ABOUT OTHER MISCHIEF. NO ONE CAN
FOOL A MASTER. HE ALWAYS KNOWS A MASTER
BODY. THERE ARE PROBABLY A HUNDRED DIF­
FERENT WAYS FOR A MASTER TO DEFINITELY
DETERM INE THE SACREDNESS OF A BODY-
TEMPLE. For instance, the voice of the individual, the move­
ments of the body as to grace, the rhythm of the walk, the words
(fruits) spoken, the knowledge expressed, the temperament,
the phrenology and physiognomy of the person, the color and
99
LORD MA I T R EYA
texture of one’s skin, the vibration radiating forth, and, best
of all, the aura of the individual.
Up until this time there have been very few body-temples
the Cosmic Masters could use on earth. This is because the
astrological as well as the astronomical changes taking place in
the heavens are conducive, we may say, to higher evolved beings
incarnating on earth, or, in another sense, man has developed
higher bodies on earth enabling more of the Egoic Groups (the
I AM Presences) of individuals to manifest on earth during this
New Age. It is almost impossible to express some of the higher
principles of soulual evolution and development without the use
of some terms foreign to the average mind, however, I shall
endeavor to more clearly explain this matter of New Age incar­
nation or re-embodying of souls now returning to take earth
bodies.
There are, I believe, 25,000 years in one manvantara (cycle)
such as is now closing. Some authorities on such occult matters
have ventured the statement that this is the closing of even many
such cycles. Should this be true, which I am inclined to believe,
then this universe has become in such close proximity with certain
Cosmic, astral, etheric and terrestrial bodies in the heavens as
to make it possible for us to develop our physical bodies to such a
high degree of perfection that we are now able to manifest the
Higher Ego, the Christ-Body or Individualized God Presence,
right here on earth. These are the kind of bodies we are to use
in the Golden Age now here. I have my new physical body just
about perfect. I have already developed my Golden Body and I
even experience it in my physical body at times when it is essen­
tial for the performance of duties the Cosmic Beings wish me to
do. I have explained to you regarding the Seven Bodies we have.
Those who are not able to manifest in their Highest Bodies
during the next nine years will not be able to live on this planet.
The higher Light Vibrations will not permit any to live here who
do not harmonize with IT. It will be like a “CONSUMING
FIRE.” THIS IS MENTIONED IN THE VERY LAST
CHAPTER IN THE OLD TESTAMENT OF THE HOLY
SCRIPTURE, the Book of Malachi: “For, behold the day
cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and
all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh
shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave
them neither root or branch.”

And in the following verse, I wish to call to the attention of
the CHILDREN OF LIGHT how significant it is when com­
pared with what I have written in this book: “But unto you that
fear my name shall the SUN of RIGHTEOUSNESS rise with
healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves
of the stall.”
Then, the next to last verse in the Old Testament, in the
same chapter: “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before
the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.” WHO
IS ELIJAH? He is one of those who has a PERFECT BODY
IN CHRIST. HE IS HERE NOW.
* * *
I shall now endeavor to give you a number of events that
took place in my initiations and instruction, in their chronological
order, beginning with the 29th of August, 1940, when I first met
Mary the Mother of Jesus in the outer body at Mt. Shasta.
Many important points came and went during the month of
October and up to the 10th of November before I was informed
that I should keep records of certain things that were transpir­
ing. In fact I had little dreamed that I was at all important
concerning these events taking place in which I was even then
one of the principal “actors on the stage of life” being brought
forth by the Great Masters.
I have related to you in a previous chapter how I was taken
into the Field of Nirvana, the Higher Planes of Bliss, His
(Christ’s) Temple, where I “rested” and was taught in my
Higher Body regarding the Great Truths of the Soul, of God
and the Cosmos (symbolically the Isle of Patmos of St. John)
where one who has received certain inner initiations becomes
conscious of his ONENESS WITH THE FATHER. It was
during October that I received these initiations, and it was on
November 10, 1940, that I was informed I should keep records
of certain revelations given to me. By that time I had somehow
suddenly become, so far as those Masters who visited me were
concerned, the SILENT WATCHER. I was told that I was to
do a great deal of investigation work throughout the world in
my Higher Body, that records should be kept, that reports
should be made to the Recorder of the Great White Lodge, and
that I should recommend things that should be done regarding
world affairs and the in-coming Golden Age. Almost overnight
101
LORD MAI TREYA
I had been changed in a most miraculous manner, so it seemed,
from an ordinary human being into at least a Semi-God.
It was November 11 that Lord Maitreya talked to me quite
at length regarding my future work. He told me then, too, that
Ave Maria was in Nirvana for a much-needed rest.
November 11 is recorded as a very important date for an­
other reason, according to the notes I have kept. It was on that
date that Lord Maitreya explained that “No one entereth the
portals of the Temple of Love and Wisdom but through me.”
I asked him then, “Who are you?” He replied in the most
kindly voice, “I am the Lord of Lords.” It was on the same
date, November 11, that the Great Lord Sanat Kumara came
to radiate his Light and Love to me. He showed me how to sit,
how to hold my hands, and told me to “sit IN THE RAINBOW
SPIRIT.” This rainbow spirit, to those who have studied Saint
Germain’s instruction in the “I AM” Presence means this: DO
NOT MERELY VISUALIZE YOURSELF BELOW THE
LIGHT OF THE PRESENCE (THE RAINBOW SPIRIT
SANAT KUMARA CALLS IT) BUT SEE YOURSELF
RIGHT IN IT. There is a vast difference, as you will see, in
being beneath a spirit and BEING RIGHT WITHIN IT. You
should visualize yourself in the CENTER of the PRESENCE
—the SEVEN RAYS OF THE LORDS OF CREATION
SCINTILLATING ABOUT YOU. These rays should be
visualized in the same order as they appear in a rainbow, which
is always the same. Or, if you are able to isolate a ray from the
sun, as some of us are able to do,—study it and get well impressed
in your imagination those colors in their clearest possible radi­
ance. Colors—especially the Cosmic colors in LIGHT—are
most important to one’s advancement and development. If you
can definitely and persistently visualize the harmonious radiation
of those colors about you there will be no question as to your
spiritual unfoldment, joyous health and industriousness or any
other good and constructive activities you may wish to bring
about. In this connection, too, it is well to begin to do CON­
SCIOUS BREATHING. I refer to your being actually aware
of the “prana” or Electronic Light-Substance in the atmosphere
about you. LOVE-LIGHT, a term I first coined, so far as I
know, in a poem I wrote in 1938, a copy of which I mailed to
Mr. G. W. Ballard, is a compound word that may help you in
visualizing the Light about you. Then, too, LOVE-WlLL is
102
THE N E W GOL DE N AGE
another one of my own compound words that is definitely a
great help, for you are combining LOVE and WILL together,
which is absolutely necessary if you accomplish anything. Love-
Will creates FEELING. Without Feeling you do not create
anything.
To anyone who may think they have a monopoly on any
terms I may use, I would refer them to the OAHSPE BIBLE
from which Mr. Ballard received much of the inspiration which
lifted him to the point of illumination where he was, for a time,
a perfect messenger. There are hundreds of messengers in the
world, but there are few MASTERS, yet. The Oahspe Bible,
first copyrighted in 1882 by John Ballou, is one of the most
amazing books ever published in the history of the world. There
are few people, however, who can understand it even today.
Ballard did understand it, and he combined his own knowledge
with that of what he accumulated from a number of other
sources, thereby enabling himself to create the biggest stir in
theological circles since the time of Jesus the Christ. God bless
him (Ballard). We need thousands like him, and within a few
years now we shall have them. Had his wife not become so con­
ceited and egotistically inflated he might have remained on earth
a few more years, as Saint Germain planned. History would have
been different.
November 12, 1940, is a date that should be well remem­
bered in the ages to come. It was on that date that Christ in His
Spirit did first incarnate in a physical body on this earth in
THIS NEW AGE. I was with the physical body in which this
IMMACULATE CONCEPTION OF CHRIST actually took
place. I was directed by the Great White Lodge to be present
in the official capacity of the SILENT WATCHER. Again,
IF IT WERE NOT SO I SHOULD NOT TELL YOU.
I regret very much that I did not record more of the details
of this wonderful INCARNATION. In this connection, how­
ever, I shall give you some amazing occult or transcendental
information, which, so far as I know, HAS NEVER BEEN
EXPLAINED ON THIS EARTH.
Jesus came in His Higher Presence, through that very body
in which CHRIST WAS “BORNING” AND EXPLAINED
TO ME THINGS THAT I COULD NOT FULLY UN­
DERSTAND AT THAT TIME. It was simply too much for
my slowly awakening SPIRIT to wholly grasp. The activity of
103
LORD M A I T R E Y A
the Divine Spirit was all very new to me. I was told that I held
a very important and SACRED office. Of all beings on earth I,
John the Brother of Jesus (Silent Watcher), was chosen to be
with Ave Maria during the incarnation of Christ into that body
for the incoming of the Golden Age. Jesus was very very happy
because He was relieved of His former office, Christ to this
World, and was raised to Lord of this Earth. He explained to
me, also, that I would have to face “great tests, but there will
be GREATER BLESSINGS.” Lord Maitreya came and said
of “Her Who is Nameless,” “She must be known as Ave Maria
only, but not known by the one who works through Her. She
is part of the Godhead that radiates through the heart.”
November 12, too, was when the Great Father the God
Mahachohan, God of the Golden Heart, came and called: “Thou,
PRINCE OF THE GOLDEN HEART, SON of the GOD
OF THE GOLDEN HEART, BORN FROM MY MOUTH,
WHERE ART THOU?” Ave Maria spoke to me saying, “It
is you He is calling—THE GREAT FATHER IS CALLING
YOU.”
I knew not what to do. “You should answer Him,” she said.
Again I heard the voice: “Oh, Prince of the Golden Heart,
where art Thou My Son. I am your Father, God of the Golden
Heart. I come to take you home into the Sun again.”
“Here am I,” I answered. And it was as though a mighty
power within me spoke from my lips, “Thou KNOWEST I
LOVE THEE AND THY TRUTH, THY LIGHT, LOVE
AND WISDOM ABOVE ALL THINGS OF EARTH.”
Thus it is Oh, Beloved Seeker after Light. You must want
Christ and His Light above all things of this world, else the
Love in your Heart is not Great Enough to draw to you YOUR
FATHER, THE GOD OF THE GOLDEN HEART. As
the Bible has stated for centuries, “Love Thy God with ALL
THY HEART, WITH ALL THY SOUL AND BODY.”
If the people of this world only knew the importance of LET­
TING GO of all things earthly in order that CHRIST MAI
COME INTO THEIR HEARTS. Oh, why is it that we
become so enthralled in earthly things? Why is it, even today,
tragic war rages, when, with common sense, the leaders of this
world might bend their efforts toward world peace, EQUALITY,
JUSTICE, ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR ALL WITH A
GUARANTEE OF INTERNATIONAL HARMONY AND
104
THE NEW G OL DE N AGE
ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION FOR ALL PEOPLES,
RACES, CREEDS AND CLANS? Let us again call together
—all of us of the Light: “ALL LIGHTS UNITED IN THE
ONE GREAT LIGHT.”
I shall never forget that 12th of November, 1940. It might
be that few in the outer world realized what a great event had
taken place, but I felt most definitely the miraculous Spiritual
Change in myself and SAW that CHANGE taking place in
another, Ave Maria’s physical body. She acted much like a
woman who had given birth to a new-born babe. I was told by
Mahatma Koot Hoomi to stay close by to protect her from any
harm, physical, etheric or mental. I was given certain signs and
symbols to use in attracting the necessary powers of the Lords
of the Rays there. They came in answer to my calls. Like
Sentinels they came. They taught me many phases of the Great
Work, too, that cannot be published for everybody to read,
however, I am able at this time, because of the higher “level”
and understanding of the masses, to publish much more of the
hidden mysteries of occultism than has ever been allowed for
public perusal before. I am confident there is no one on earth
at this time who has experienced such transcendental states of
consciousness and activity unless it were “She Who is Nameless.”
The body in which “She” abides on earth is forever safe from
the curious eyes of the “uninitiated” world. Yes, “SHE MUST
BE OBEYED.”
November 13, 1940: Master Morya, Lord of Power,
came to us, weeping. He spoke of “OUR KINGDOM.” He
explained that He had been chosen as “King” of the New
Spiritual Kingdom on Earth. Morya is, as I have stated before,
the re-embodiment of St. John the Most Beloved Disciple of
Jesus who wrote the most illuminative Book of the New Testa­
ment, “Revelation.” I would analyze his weeping in this way:
He, knowing that Christ was incarnating at that time, and other
GREAT OFFICES changing simultaneous, He came prayer­
fully pleading that the Great Lords and Gods of the Spiritual
Hierarchy carefully guard “Her Who is Nameless” until such
time as the Powers of Darkness could do Her no harm. As
other great ones came that day I began to realize what a
Grand and Glorious Spectacle was really INCARNATING IN
EARTH. The incarnation of Christ was fully realized, so we
thought, on the 13th. Ave Maria called me to Her, saying she
had something she wished to talk to me about. There was such
105
LORD M A I T R E Y A
a marvelous radiation of love about Her as I approached Her
where she lay restfully reposing upon a couch that I felt just
like a little child approaching its mother. Strange, but that was
just what she wanted to talk to me about.
“Amsumata,” she began, “you are to take a great part in
the affairs of this planet during the approaching Golden Age.
You have been referred to by Master Koot Hoomi and others
of the Divine Family as John the Brother of Jesus. It is true.
You were my son, too, when your older brother, Jesus, was on
earth. You were also Divinely sent, even as He was, but there
was a misunderstanding. It was to you that Jesus spoke when
on the cross, when He said, ‘John, know thy Mother.’ Readers
of the Scriptures thought it was John the Beloved to whom He
spoke, but it was not. You took care of me, John, after Jesus
ascended. You were good to me, and I have always loved you
for it. Now I am able to come and assist you in your time of
great trial.”
I was so touched I wept. She spoke so feelingly of those
times of the past I could actually see them pictured right before
my eyes. Her eyes, too, overflowed with tears. She talked on.
“Much is expected of you, John. Remember, you are one of the
Divine Family. Those of our family must stand together. Our
protection and the New Kingdom now approaching depends
upon us. Your brother James—we do not know where he is. I
always think of him as he was then, with a beard. We must
find him.”
In Tacoma, Wash., years ago I had met and studied under a
remarkable teacher of the mysteries, Harry Eyer, who had inti­
mated to me after I became well acquainted with him, that he
was the re-embodiment of the Apostle Peter. Brother Eyer told
me then that James and John were both embodied and living
in Tacoma at that time. Now, he may have known I was John.
I do not know. Anyhow I had met the one he said was James
and got pretty well acquainted with him, so I told Mother Mary
about it. The whole matter came into my mind instantly as she
mentioned James. “I think I know where James is,” I remarked.
“A teacher I once knew in Tacoma told me he was living there.”
“Do you recall his name?” she asked;—“his name in the
outer world?”
“Yes, in a way I do. It was either Hansen or Larson or
something like that.”
“What work did he follow?” she wanted to know.
106
THE N E W GOL DE N AGE
“He was a building contractor.”
“Yes,” she exclaimed, “that would be just like him, still fol­
lowing his father’s trade.”
For a few minutes it was as though Ave Maria were dozing.
I thought she had gone to sleep. But no. She had gone in spirit
to Tacoma, but returned soon to tell me that she had found James
there. I had told her that he was, even years ago when I knew
him, interested in the Higher Teachings of Christ. She spoke
little regarding James any more, but when I went north from
Mt. Shasta in January, 1941, I visited an old friend and student
of mine, Mark Bartlett, there. While in the city I inquired of
another Norwegian friend of mine if he knew where Larson
was. He said he was still in the city, also in the contracting
business. He was, however, I found, one of the active workers
in Father Divine’s religious movement. I did not see him, but
God Bless him, and while I am on the subject I say, “GOD
BLESS FATHER DIVINE, TOO.” He is doing a marvelous
work for all who seek the True Light of Understanding.
For the benefit of you people who seek the Light of Christ
and yet look down upon the Colored races, I shall later tell you
about the time when I ascended. Next to Ave Maria the ONE
who helped me most was the Goddess of Light. Well, Beloved
Friends of the Light, the Goddess of Light is now embodied in
a Negro body. “Judge not lest ye be judged.” REMEMBER,
as Lord Maitreya said, “EVERY SOUL MUST BE SAVED.”
One thing I have always admired in the Roman Catholic Church
—they make no distinction in color or race in their membership.
The Colored people, to me, are a marvelous race. They make
much more out of a limited opportunity than many of us do out
of great economic and educational advantages. I am now thank­
ful that the Universal Lord placed me in various environments
in this life in which I learned all races, all cliques, creeds, clans
and social and economic conditions. I know human beings of
every kind and grade. Being adept, I can meet any of them on
their own ground.
Other important matters came up on November 13. The
Mighty Cosmic Lord came to pay his respects, so to speak, to
Ave Maria, and called Her the Solar Sun. At High Noon a
Great Spiritual Being annnounced that the Son of Christ was
born in Ave Maria. Later Saint Germain came, declaring with
great power, “THE SWORD OF AVE MARIA MUST
BLAZE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD — EVERY-
107
LORD M A I T R E Y A
WHERE.” Mahatma Koot Hoomi stated that Mary Magda­
lene, who is embodied and living in California, must be given
every possible aid at this time to enable her to ascend. Her
rising to mastery, he explained, is most important to the ascen­
sion of ALL WOMANHOOD of this world.
In my hurry to get this message to the world, I do not have
time to perfect a great work of literature, but, Beloved Brothers
of Light, I do want you to dwell on these marvelous essentials
alluded to in this brief resume, since the blending together of
the numerous “bits of mystery” associated with this REVELA­
TION will definitely and positively lift YOU into the full con­
sciousness and illumination of the GREAT SPIRIT—the Ascen­
sion.
I was told later by an Ascended Master that Mary Magda­
lene is now under the direct instruction of a Master-Teacher.
She was told of what Mary the Mother of Jesus and KH had
said of her near-ascension. She wept with joy, eager to put forth
every possible effort in her own spiritual development and unfold-
ment.
At 5 :30 P.M. Mahatma Koot Hoomi announced, “The
Solar Christ will come March 10, 1941, stepping through to the
earth in full power.” At 6:00 P.M. Buddha Gautama came,
instructing me in some very important phases of the Oriental
teachings of Krishna, and also gave me information regarding
my little daughter’s future training. This I shall take up in
another chapter.
May I remind you once more, Beloved, to repeat now and
again, when it occurs to your mind, the Slogan of the Great
White Lodge: “ALL LIGHTS UNITED IN THE ONE
GREAT LIGHT.” GOD BLESS YOU.
108
CHAPTER XIV
M Y SECRET
No one knows the joys of my heart
No one knows my sorrow;
No one knows my delights of today
Nor my dreams of tomorrow.
I am my joy,
I am my sorrow,
M y delights of today,
M y dreams of tomorrow.
Of course, as you will understand, it is impossible for me to
relate but a very small part of all that transpired on the dates I
mention while with Ave Maria and the Great Masters at Mt.
Shasta. Some of it I did not record, nor do I remember a great
deal of the details of that part not recorded. Other knowledge
given to me and special instruction, I am not permitted to give
to the outside world. It is only as certain ones attain to the
“proper degree” of enlightenment that they are “CHOSEN”
by the Master to receive instructions direct from HIM. Remem­
ber, Beloved, the “student is chosen by the Master.” The student
does not choose the Master. “Many are sent but few are
chosen.” One must definitely understand the basic SPIRITUAL
LAWS IN HIS HEART before he can be chosen to “sit at the
feet of THE MASTER.” Strange it may seem to you, but
WHEN you meet ONE MASTER you have met ALL MAS­
TERS. THE MASTER is “HE WHO IS NAMELESS.”
Mother Mary, I might GUESS, is the FIRST woman ever to
attain FULL ILLUMINATION AND MASTERY ON
EARTH, in the same sense that Jesus was referred to in the
Holy Bible as the “FIRST FRUIT.” HE IS THE BRIDE­
GROOM. SHE IS THE BRIDE. I AM THE BRIDE­
GROOM. SHE IS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. “He who
hath ears to hear, let him hear.” The Spirit of God will reveal
that to you, Beloved, which you are to know. “Maitreya,” the
Lord of Love, is “THE DOOR.”
109
LORD M A I T R E Y A
November 14: Master Morya, The Venetian, Serapis and
Saint Germain came, stood before us in full regalia, saluting
us and saying: “WE ARE WITH YOU.” Morya, as I have
told you, is the Great Manu or King of the New Golden Age;
the Venetian works with the Great Mahachohan on the Third
Ray; Serapis is Lord of the Rosicrucian or Egyptian Fourth
Ray (Green) ; and Saint Germain, at that time was being trans­
ferred from the Seventh Ray (Violet) to the Second (Blue).
The Third Ray is Gold. Contrary to many students of Saint
Germain’s misinterpreted teachings, the Violet Ray is the lowest
of all rays. The Newly Initiated Master is usually placed in
charge of the Violet Ray more or less as a trial or probationary
period. Saint Germain, as I have intimated before, had previ­
ously been initiated as early as 1925, consciously to my outer
mind, but, I AM FRANK TO SAY, I did not bring ALL
through clearly enough to get the complete details. Later, when
I married, my outer consciousness of the inner activities became
more dimmed because (as KH explained later) of abuse that
usually accompanies a human body through misuse of sexual
powers. It is the loss of vital forces by over-indulgence in the
marriage rite that causes more misery in this world than all
other causes put together. Relative to this important phase of
moral and religious instruction I refer the sincere student to the
Seventh Chapter of First Corinthians in the New Testament.
In a later chapter I shall give all the direct information anent
this subject I dare publish. Purity of mind and a GODLY
PURPOSE are the most essential principles that should always
be uppermost in the minds of all persons at all times regarding
any sexual act. However, I dare say I can add little to that Saint
Paul has written about “right and wrong” regarding sex in the
biblical chapter referred to above.
This I will venture to say, even of my personal life: I never
touched a woman before I married my legal wife, whom I mar­
ried July 18, 1926, at the age of thirty. I was conscious of the
first conception of my Blessed Wife after we were married and
talked to our first son, now 14 years of age, three months before
he was born. And again, I reiterate, I first ascended in 1925,
while living in Olympia, Wash., where I then witnessed THE
WHITE DOVE ABOVE THE “MOUNTAIN” IN THE
SEA OF LIFE. My Master-Teacher (RSC) should have known
what took place in my inner initiations at that time, since I had
written to him in their regard, but he was not fully awakened to
110
THE NEW GOL DE N A GE
the significance of these matters, I am sorry to relate, which,
APPARENTLY, delayed the incoming of the Golden Age.
However, Beloved, I do not judge.
The most disgusting thing to me in this world is the appall­
ing fact there are hundreds of thousands of supposed wise priests,
preachers, teachers, philosophers and university professors, and
yet, none of them are able to reasonably interpret the Holy
Bible. There is actually billions of dollars in money paid to
these organized human leeches who suck the life-blood out of
the poor ignorant people under the guise of being God’s chosen
religious servants. Jesus called them “money-changers.” They
sell Christ at so much a month. Some of them probably get as
much as ten thousand dollars a year. Others are paid a certain
percent of the monies collected. God help them. God have pity
on their very souls these “last days.” And the saddest part of
all is that the majority of them are actually sincere because they
“blindly follow the blind.” Someone is going to have a heavy
price to pay when the balancing of the “Lamb’s book of Glory”
is looked into soon. Then there will be “wailing and gnashing
of teeth” aplenty. Don’t blame me, My Shadowy Brothers.
Take my advice right now. Look into your hearts. Look for
the REAL LIGHT OF CHRIST there before it is too late.
In the end then when the balancing of the “book” is brought
about you will thank me for having told you the TRUTH to
your face. Answer me this, you Make-Believe “Wolves-in-
Sheep’s-Clothing” Regents of Christ: “Do you think we might
ever have ‘His Kingdom established on earth’ should we follow
your practices of Mammon?” For almost two thousand years
you have been preaching your Mammon way. Now Christ Him­
self comes forth. With all your organized selfish money-making
false religious teachings, the Stars of Heaven are against you.
The Lords of Light accuse you in your Dark Hearts. Your
burning consciences sear your guilty minds as the Light of the
Christ sifts through your Black Shells. You are now being stript
of your Wolfish Clothes. You stand naked before Him. His
“All-Seeing Eye” discerns your every deceitful thought. You
will pray for “the mountains to fall upon you.” Yes, even your
souls must be “saved.”
I make no apology for stating the Truth regarding these
things. I KNOW the TRUTH and unless I state it my “sins of
omission” would remove me. I must do what MY FATHER
111
LORD M A I T R E Y A
HAS TOLD ME TO DO. I have been told I must “FINISH
THE WORK YOUR ELDER BROTHER JESUS
STARTED TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO.” Yes, My
Father told me that just as plainly as I might say it to you. I
tarried several years, thinking, “surely this cannot be that I am
to go forth making such claims before the people of the world.”
But, Beloved, I DO MAKE THEM NOW and I make them
KNOWING THAT MY FATHER IS WITH ME IN ALL
I SAY OR DO. And all the Lords of Light have promised to
assist me, to protect me, to uphold me and to BLAZE THE
LIGHT AHEAD OF ME WHEREVER I MAY GO. You
who would oppose me, I shall not resist you, but THE LIGHT
OF CHRIST WILL ENFOLD YOU, CONSUMING YOUR
DARKNESS, REVEALING YOURSELF TO YOU. When
you s'ee your own HIGHER SELF then you will know ME.
If you know MY FATHER then you will know ME, for I and
MY FATHER are ONE SPIRIT. I was taken into His Heart.
I AM ONE WITH HIM. To Me, ONE WHO KNOWS
GOD AND HIS LAWS, you cannot hide anything from ME.
November 15, 1940: Ave Maria came forth in the fulness
of Her Spirit and stated that she had been given power over
all Black Magicians. She related to me how she had cast out
the “Prince of the Satans” who was embodied at the time in
Spain. Archangel Michael had, she said, assisted Her in this
great work.
November 18: In the morning Archangel Michael came to
tell us that Joshua (Christ born of Ave Maria) and John the
Brother of Jesus (Amsumata), were asked to go forth to do
a special work in the world. Joshua was claimed as Michael’s
child. This was the first intimation I had regarding anything
like a mission such as I now have to carry out as the “Chief-
Avatar.” The Masters were extremely careful in mentioning
any such thing, for they would say nothing or do nothing that
might cause me to feel personally conceited or egotistical in my
outer mind. When I look over the past fourteen months I am
still amazed at the remarkable manner in which every little
detail in my intensive training was handled. All my life I have
been trained, especially on the inner planes of consciousness, and
I have been under teachers and masters in the outer world for
more than 20 years, but the past 14 months it seems that all I
112
THE NEW GOLDEN A GE
ever dreamed of in the way of spiritual awakening and actual
attainment has culminated in ME NOW AS I AM.
Joshua, the one referred to by Archangel Michael, is my
Twin Ray, so I found later. She, too, has a Golden Body such
as I have in my Higher Presence. I say “SHE” because she is
now embodied in a feminine body. Joshua is the same one who
succeeded Moses and was ruler over the Israelites. He is the
one who “commanded the sun to stand still,” and it STOOD
STILL. When you, Beloved, attain to Joshua, you will have
become a Son .(sun) of the Father. I shall tell you later of an
amazing episode in my training that took place that same day,
November 18. It has much to do with the Spirit as well as the
Body of a Master.
“She Who is Nameless,” I shall henceforth refer to as Ave
Maria. I shall, for convenience in explaining, therefore, refer
to the body of this PARTICULAR MASTER as Ave Maria.
Understand, this ONE BODY, which is used by the Great
Lords as the PERFECT VESSEL in this material world, is the
JEWEL through which Their INDIVIDUAL RAYS scintil­
late to all the world in this outer octave of life. This is a new
activity to this age which has not been made use of in this world
since Jesus was embodied almost two thousand years ago. That
Body is to be used primarily, as I understand, by Jesus Himself,
and it was prepared mostly by Ave Maria, THE JEWEL OF
THE GOLDEN AGE. Joshua and Jesus are the same Spirit.
Even in the Oahspe Bible He was called Joshu. The art of pre­
paring our physical bodies as a Temple in which the Master
may come and abide, is the work of the Alchemist. That is what
I had to do, Jesus had to do, Ave Maria had to do, or any other
who attains mastery. You MUST practice Alchemy.
Jesus will not be alone this time. There are many of us on
earth this time for the purpose of performing the miraculous
task of establishing the Golden Age in all its glory.
November 18 Koot Hoomi also came to tell me that I should
deliver a lecture announcing to the world the Second Coming of
Christ. He cautioned me not to lecture anywhere outside of
Mt. Shasta City. He specified the time, November 24, which
gave me little time to publish it in the local newspaper. I did
hurry about, however, and rented the main Masonic Hall there
for the evening of Nov. 24. The following notice ran in the
113
LORD M A I T R E Y A
Mount Shasta Herald, dated Nov. 21, 1940, as well as a news
story about the same wording:
NOTICE
Norman R. Westfall, former editor, writer,
lecturer, will deliver a lecture at the Masonic
Hall in Mount Shasta
SU N D AY EVENING
NOVEMBER 24
beginning at 7:30; his subject
“CH RIST’S CO M IN G”
in which he will explain how the Cosmic Lords
have N O W prepared the earth through the
Cosmic Light for the Coming of the Solar
Christ into this world.
M r. Westfall represents no particular church
nor organization, but is undenominational, and
invites all churches, lodges and people who
believe in the Light of Christ to attend these
lectures. They are free to the public.
There were eighteen persons present at the lecture. I had
been told by Lord Maitreya on November 18 to “announce to
the world that there is but one standard of life for both, men and
women.” He emphasized the ONE GREAT LIGHT. East and
West, he said, “must unite under the One Great Light. In a
similar manner you are to teach as your Great Brother Saint
Germain teaches.” (At that time I did not know my Higher
Presence was Saint Germain.) An hour before the lecture was
to begin, a Master appeared and said: “I am the Chief Officer
of Lord Maitreya. Saint Germain will deliver the lecture this
evening. Lord Maitreya asked me to explain the Maltese Cross
and Lie wishes you to explain it to your audience.” It all seemed
strange to me. I had often wished for somebody to explain the
symbolism of the Maltese Cross to me, but somehow no one ever
had explained it to me. He indicated that in the first place you
draw a square. Then, he said, you draw a cross from corner to
corner across the square; you cut a part out of each corner of the
dark square, and place a small circle in the center where the two
114
THE NE W GOL DE N A GE
original lines crossed which represents a lotus flower. That
center jewel is gold. The other part or background of square is
blue. As we advance in the transmutation of the baser elements
in our ascension toward God, the Black becomes less and less until
there is nothing left but all the GOLD of our being, on a back­
ground of Blue, which takes the form of a full blown Lotus.
Our ascension takes place then, WHEN ALL THE DROSS
IN OUR MINDS AND BODIES ARE DISSOLVED,
TRANSMUTED AND REGENERATED and we are
FREED FROM THE SQUARE OF MATERIALITY.
The drawings below will give you a better idea of the explanation:
I was greatly inspired during the lecture. Now I knew who
had inspired me so much all during my life when I endeavored
to speak to an audience. It was Saint Germain. Ave Maria
was present in the audience. She saw Saint Germain. I talked,
of course, principally about the Second Coming of Christ and
the Golden Age now here. Ave Maria said my words were
electrifying. She had never heard me speak in public before,
but I had told her of the overpowering inspiration that always
came over me when I spoke to people of the New Age. Lincoln,
she said, was also quite in evidence in my body while I was
talking. I had been told to announce myself as a Disciple of
Christ. Following is the Invocation I used before beginning the
main part of the address:
Master Koot Hoomi, Ave Maria, Jesus the Christ (Issa), Saint
Germain, Archangel Michael, Sanat Kumara (Father of this Planet),
Lord of Lords Maitreya, and Thou Almighty Lord God of the Great
Central Sun of A ll Life, Light, Love, Wisdom and Power,—we
invoke thy blessings here upon us. W e K N O W you hear our call.
W e rejoice with Thee in the Service of the Light. May every heart
in this room be touched by Thy Radiance, and may Thy Blessing
reach to every human heart in this world. W e thank Thee that Thou
hast seen fit to allow us to serve Thee in this present activity. Bless
us, Oh, Lord of Lords, that we may bless others. W e thank Thee.
115
LORD M A I T R E Y A
And thus, Beloved, the first announcement of the incarnation
of Christ into this world in this New Age, was proclaimed
throughout the ethers of this planet. Instead of the few who
were present in their physical bodies, there were millions who
felt that message in their hearts as it sounded and resounded on
the ether waves. The Great Lords were present. I was chosen
as the physical vessel through which it was announced in this
octave or plane of life, but today, one year from that date* when
it was proclaimed, much has changed in the mentalities of all
human beings. There is the mass feeling throughout the whole
world that we are fast approaching SOMETHING VASTLY
DIFFERENT UPON OLD MOTHER EARTH. Time will
bring all that is anticipated by the Children of Light, yes, and
MORE.
That evening, when we gathered together, after the lecture,
Lord Maitreya came and said to me: “You asked that your All-
Seeing Eye and your All-Hearing Ear be opened. I come to
open your eye that you may see with the EYE ABSOLUTE.”
Among other things he told me how pleased he was with the way
I handled the announcement of Christ’s Coming to the World.

CHAPTER XV
Beloved Friends of Light, I wish to tell you now of the most
extraordinary visit I ever experienced in this physical body. It
was on that memorable November 18. I was born on an 18th
and that number as well as nines, twenty-sevens, elevens and
twenty-nines invariably play great parts in my activities here
on earth. My own birthdate I do not care to disclose at this
time. And I would advise any student of Light to desist in
giving out data regarding their birth. “I’ve GOT YOUR NUM­
BER,” has more significance to it than the uninitiated may
suspect.
It was a beautiful sunny afternoon, though cold, windy and
bleak outside, which caused us to appreciate all the more the
cheerful heat from a crackling wood fire indoors. Ave Maria
and I had, as usual, been discussing various principles and teach­
ings of philosophy, and especially those of the Master Jesus.
She told me how He had when on earth during his Great Minis­
try originated the Druid Brotherhood. She gave me the ancient
alphabet of the ANCIENT SCRIPT, the character letters He
used at that time. “Every Avatar,” she said, “always starts a
brotherhood of His own when embodied on earth, and that
Brotherhood disseminates His teachings to the people of earth
following His earthly Ascension. The Druids migrated to the
British Isles following the Ascension of Jesus.”
There dwelt in the room about us an atmosphere wrapt in
mystery. The blissful calm and peacefulness was indeed heavenly.
The Spirit of Jesus was with us. All became perfectly quiet.
Neither of us spoke. For several minutes this unutterable still­
ness lulled us into such blissful repose we were oblivious to all
things earthly.
And then the physical body I thought to be Ave Maria
straightened up on the couch where she reclined. The sweetest
voice I have ever heard spoke to me. The most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen looked at me. “Who are you?” that sweet
little musical voice inquired. “Are you a Master?”
Astonished almost beyond speaking, I answered, “Some
may call me a Master. Maybe I am a Master.”
117
LORD M A I T R E Y A
“Well, you must be a Master or my mother would not be
here. She only associates with Masters,” that childish voice
continued. “I am so lonely where I am,” she added. “Those
who are with me do not understand me. They all think of me
as a little girl. I am not a little girl. I am just living in a little
girl body now. Koot Hoomi teaches me music. Some day he
says I will be a great musician. I am taking lessons in music in
my physical body, too. I go to the Retreat in India, too, in my
Spirit Body. I am studying the Rosicrucian Mysteries.”
“Who are you?” I asked.
“I am Joshua,” she replied.
“Well, Joshua, I am John the Brother of Jesus, so I was
told by Koot Hoomi the other day,” and I spoke to her in as
kindly and fatherly manner as I could.
“Oh, you are John. I have heard of you. Do you teach my
mother?”
“Well, Joshua, I am more inclined to think your mother
teaches me. It might be that we teach each other.”
Beloved, Thou who seekest Light, here was evidenced another
strange form of teaching and instruction which is common among
the White Masters. Joshua, whom I was told is my Twin Ray,
and one who must work with me in the Great Work of bringing
in the Golden Age, had a physical body nine years of age, and
that physical body is the daughter of Ave Maria in the physical
plane. This visit of her with me was wholly unexpected, and I
must say, not at all understood by me until days later when it
was fully explained to me. She so longs to be with her physical
mother at times that her spirit, the Soul of her, actually comes
and dwells in the mother’s body and not only visits with her but
others who might chance to be around. In this particular instance,
Ave Maria was not even conscious of the conversation that went
on between us, Joshua and I, for she (Ave Maria) had gone to
a distant place to carry out an important mission for the Great
White Lodge, and she had called the Spirit of Joshua to remain
in her body while she was out. She wanted, as was the desire
of Koot Hoomi and Lord Maitreya, to have Joshua and me to
get acquainted. That was our first visit, but, I am happy to say,
it was not our last.
Joshua was there with me for at least an hour and a half, I
would judge, and it was just as though a nine-year-old girl had
been talking to me, but for one important difference; she was, I
found, extremely wise, and above all, radiated more love than any
118
THE NE W GOL DE N AGE
individual I had ever talked to before in this life. After a while
she took the liberty to walk about the room, examining various
articles here and there just as a strange child would do. She
asked questions about a statue of Psyche when she picked it up,
which denoted her remarkable understanding of things of the
soul. A picture of her mother when she (Joshua) was a tiny
baby in her mother’s arms was on a little table. She picked it
up, stating that that was herself when she was a little baby.
I must confess that although Joshua was in the body of Ave
Maria, it was all I could do to prevent myself from taking her
in my arms and holding her close to my heart. I might say, too,
that I believe she wanted to be loved just as much as I wanted
to love her. The Masters, I somehow knew, were trying me
severely in this matter. I am of a most affectionate nature, how­
ever, there has never been in my life a time when I was not
master of my desires and passions, I am happy also to confess.
Joshua even told me many things about her mother that Ave
Maria had not told me, some of which, I dare say, she should
not have said. You know how children are. Sometimes they tell
things to outsiders that their parents do not wish published. I
guess she happened to think of this feature of affairs and she
said, “You must be careful what you say about my mother. She
will know everything you say. You cannot keep anything from
her if she wants to know about it.”
I had found already what Joshua said about Ave Maria know­
ing anything and everything she wished to know regarding a per­
son or thing. Of course it is not hard for a Master to know when
anyone is talking about him. And in proportion to his being able
to read the akashic records around a person they can read what
has gone on in a room or any particular environment hours or
even years later.
Joshua told me how dissatisfied she was with matters in her
schooling and her home. She was in a Convent. She said the
Sisters did not understand her. Her father, she said, also, did
not give her the proper consideration. Understand, please, that
Joshua was living at a Convent, or going to school at a Convent
and living with her father who had the custody of the child.
The mother of the child in this embodiment is Ave Maria. Even
the court records can be produced to prove every statement I
make regarding this. The father of Joshua very angrily yelled
in the court when divorce proceedings were in action—alluding
to the mother of the child—“She thinks she’s Mary the Mother
119
LORD M A I T R E Y A
of Jesus and she wants me to be Joseph.” That was when the
child was about seven years of age. The father, a wealthy
physician and surgeon, not understanding the occult and mystical
background of his wife, who was reared in Germany, had the
entire matter brought into the public court in a California city.
She, Ave Maria, was there “crucified,” so to speak by the
uninitiated, who,—GOD HELP THEM—did not understand
what a momentous court proceeding was in session. They accused
her of being insane, took her child from her, provided a small
amount of alimony for her, and tortured her in every conceivable
way they could. But, lo and behold, she rose above it all, the
great being she is, and NOW stands the MOST PRECIOUS
BEING IN A WOMAN’S BODY THAT EVER WALKED
UPON EARTH. WOE UNTO THOSE WHO TOR­
TURED HER.
Just a few days following the court settlement, Ave Maria,
while in her room alone, was visited by Archangel Michael.
He appeared to her in a tangible body. Among other things
He said, “You must go to Koot Hoomi. He will teach you.”
Ave Maria had never heard of Koot Hoomi. She had
studied occult and mystical things all her life, yet she had never
contacted anyone who spoke to her of Master KH, as Koot
Hoomi is generally known. She had, a year or so previous to
the court action, contacted Saint Germain’s teachings through
the Ballard organization. In one of the books later published
there was a discourse dictated by KH, but that book, “Ascended
Master Light,” had not been published when Archangel Michael
appeared to Ave Maria. She later published two wonderful
little books under a pseudonym, which clearly show to the spiritual
discerning mind that she was and IS a person of extraordinary
illumination and development.
Immediately after the visitation of Archangel Michael Ave
Maria got busy to find where this being, Koot Hoomi, was to be
found. You might say, “Well, why didn’t Archangel Michael
tell her?” My Beloved Friend of Light, that is not the way the
Great Masters work. They tell you little, and let you, of your
own “FREE WILL AND ACCORD,” work out MUCH. It
was several weeks before Ave Maria found who, what and where
Koot Floomi IS. Through the Theosophical Society she found
that he IS a Great Ascended Master who lives in a physical body
in India—IN TIBET—to be exact—SHIGATSE, TIBET—
and He is not only an ordinary human being, but a KING. He
120
THE NE W GOLDEN A GE
is the ruler of one-half of Tibet. Even the natives of that far-off
country, which is almost inaccessible from the outside world,
look up to Koot Hoomi as a God, WHICH HE IS, AS IS
KNOWN BY THE OTHER GREAT MASTERS OF THE
RAYS AND BY THE HIGHEST OCCULTISTS AND
TRANSCENDENTALISTS OF THIS WORLD.
As soon as Ave Maria found where Koot Hoomi was and
WHO He IS, things began to happen in order and with rapid-
fire rapidity. As Saint Germain said to me the other day, it was
“fast, faster Fastness.” Now, Beloved, that is getting pretty
fast. Thirty-five hundred dollars was placed at her disposal with
which to arrange for passage by ship to India. She hurried
about to make arrangements for sailing. She was so “lifted up,”
she told me later, that she was actually invisible a part of the
time. The LIGHT VIBRATIONS or SPIRIT had become so
awakened in her that she almost instantly became a being of a
higher order. Fler Higher Body, the Great Presence, became
manifest in her outer body. She told me how that one day she
went to the office of a steamship company to see about her ticket
and other arrangements that had to be made before sailing.
She approached a gentleman there in the office and began talking
to him regarding her ticket, not realizing she was invisible.
The poor man was almost “scared out of his boots.” He stared
about with the most frightful look on his face. At first she
knew not what to think of it all. Then she happened to think
that probably she was invisible. When she suddenly appeared
that did not help matters much. The distraught gentleman was
on the verge of rushing from the place when She, with Her
calmness and mastery, assured him there was nothing wrong.
Ave Maria sailed for Calcutta the latter part of 1938, dis­
embarked there, arranged for travel to Darjeeling and on
through the mountainous regions to the border of Tibet. There
were two native Indo-Chinese who travelled with her in the
higher country beyond where there are railroads—a man and a
woman. They looked after her burros, her lodging, food and
equipment. They were often battling with each other, she said,
over who should do “this and that” regarding her welfare. They
passed through some dangerous regions, however, her guides
knew the country and the people contacted, so all went well
until they came to the border of Tibet. There the officials wrould
not let her pass over, even though she had a passport and every­
thing in perfect order.
121
LORD M A I T R E Y A
They told her it was impossible for a large pack train to
go into that rugged, bandit-infested region at that time, let alone
a woman with a couple of Chinese coolies. For three days she
lodged at the border, wondering what should be done. By the
third day she began to affirm her need and what should be done,
to the Great Masters in Spirit. She called to Koot Hoomi. She
gave Him to understand that she was sent there by Archangel
Michael and it was up to Him to see that she got to her desti­
nation. A miraculous thing happened.
She had been told by “Master Wireless” to make arrange­
ments to have her baggage taken care of for passage on into
Tibet. Koot Hoomi had ordered it moved into the interior.
At the right moment, wholly unexpected to Ave Maria,
Master KH appeared on one side of her and Master Morya
on the other. She was picked up through their powers of levi­
tation and actually carried through the air several hundred
miles and placed “safe and sound” in her own room that had
been prepared for her in the Retreat at Shigatse, Tibet. The
first thing she said, she told me, after she was placed on her feet
and was standing facing Koot Hoomi was, “You are the most
beautiful being I have ever seen.” She admitted to me that she
had not even thought of what she was going to say, and she was
really quite embarrassed.
For more than three months Ave Maria stayed at the Great
Retreat of Koot Hoomi’s, where she received the highest occult
teachings obtainable on earth. After hundreds of years Joseph
and Mary were together once more. Even though Master KH
is considered the Greatest Living Initiate, He acknowledged to
me that He learned much from Ave Maria, and often he has
said to me, “Don’t be fooled; She knows all things. You can
hide nothing from Her. She has access to the highest realms of
life. Nothing daunts Her.” This I have proved, Beloved Seeker
after Truth. Here I have told you of one instance where the
seemingly impossible was accomplished. These things I relate are
but a foretaste of what you will witness in the next nine years on
earth. The time is here, and you shall see that I am not exag­
gerating in the least in what I have told you.
While in Tibet and other regions, including India, Ave Maria
was treated much as a visiting queen from a foreign country.
There were many Great Masters who knew of her coming long
before she arrived. They knew Her Higher Presence—the
Spirit—Mary the Mother of Jesus. At one time she told me of
122
THE NE W GOL DE N AGE
riding along through a certain district on her burro, when,
looking down, the burro had suddenly changed into a beautiful
prancing war horse, and she and the horse were both dressed
in full regalia. Thus she rode along for a considerable distance.
People on both sides of the road were seen bowing and saluting
her as though she were a great general. She explained that one
of her embodiments when she had lived in that country hundreds
of years ago had suddenly become envisaged, and she was living
through that particular episode of the embodiment. After a time
the whole vision vanished and her plodding little burro, none
the worse for the experience, swung along at his regular gait,
probably dreaming of the delicious meal his new mistress would
provide for him at their next stop.
At another time a messenger was seen hurrying toward her
on horseback. She had no idea he was approaching her. But
he was. His master, a great Seer of India, had seen Ave Maria
miles before she came near to his castle. The messenger, with
all the courtesy he could muster, implored her to come and visit
with the Indian Monarch, that arrangements had been made to
entertain her and grant her an interview that would be most
illuminating to her. She did visit with him and found him to be
a Great Master. He, she told me, knew more about her and her
past embodiments than she even dreamed possible.
At still another time she had been asked to attend a cere­
monial gathering in one of the great temples of India. She
stood by a large window high overlooking the open court where
the proceedings were set to take place. Suddenly everything
seemed to be at a standstill. She saw the Master who sat on the
dais or throne look up to where she stood motioning as though
he wished someone from up there to come down to where he
sat the central figure of this auspicious occasion. She thought
he motioned to someone behind her. She looked but there was
no one behind her. In a moment one of the officials of the
Great Buddha who was in charge of the ceremony approached
her saying that she was wanted down below by the Master. Ave
Maria told me she did not understand what was going on at
all, but felt impelled to do as asked. The entire ceremony was
held up until she could approach the Buddha. As she walked
through the throng the people bowed down on the ground before
her. The Master descended from His throne and asked her to
ascend upon it.
123
LORD M A I T R E Y A
The ceremony then proceeded and Ave Maria sat on the
throne during the affair. She said there was an amazing change
in herself when she got on the throne. Even the language of
the people, the ritual and all necessary signs, symbols and such
matters were naturally carried out by her as though it were an
every-day experience.
Now, Friends of Light, you may wonder about all these
strange things happening as they did. I do not wonder. Those
Masters knew of Ave Maria’s past embodiments. They knew
WHOM SHE IS. They knew that even the GREAT
BUDDHA GAUTAMA WAS IN HER BODY AT THAT
VERY MOMENT. The Master was cognizant of that fact.
He could not direct the ceremony himself so long as there was
a Greater One present than Himself. Do you understand, My
Beloved? Again I must remind you that such things will become
so commonplace in the United States of America within the next
few years that they shall not appear miraculous at all.
After months of mystery-wrought experiences in India and
Tibet Ave Maria was told to return to America. She told me
she wept for days when and after she left. It seemed that to her it
would be impossible to return to this harsh world where no one
seems to understand. She was directed later to Mt. Shasta.
That is where I first met her August 29, 1940, and that is when
my life took a startling turn toward Higher Things.
124
CHAPTER XVI
Blessed Seeker after Light, I am most thankful that I have
been so blessed by the Great Ones. Now their blessing I can
radiate on to you and you, in turn, will send it on to those you
deem needful of the Light of Christ Lord Maitreya. This book,
Beloved, is your authority as a Messenger of God. I AM YOUR
TEACHER. You will find every word I tell you true. You will
find in this BOOK, if you meditate upon it and always call for
the Lord of Love to reign in your Golden Heart,—yes, you will
find in this BOOK all the needed instruction to lead you RIGHT
INTO THE GREAT TEMPLE OF LIGHT AND LOVE.
Fear not, My Beloved Student, I am with you IN TRUTH
AND LIGHT AND LOVE, saith Lord Maitreya.
Yes, Beloved, this Book is your authority. You are My
Messenger. You are My Disciple. But, My Beloved, be ever
on guard. Do not go forth boastful of your Light, Love, Wis­
dom and Power. For if you do, you will find yourself utterly
alone. You will be stript of all power you ever possessed. Your
empty words will die on the still air even before they are
uttered. Should you claim things for your personal self your
boastful claims will echo back to you, accusing you of faithless­
ness in Christ. His Spirit will have deserted you. KNOW, oh
Thou who wouldst be a Power for Good, that True Humbleness
before Christ, Son of the Living Almighty God, is, after all,
the DOOR to His Abode. In any undertaking for God’s New
Age, always invoke His guidance and the cooperation of His
Sons, the Great White Masters of Love.
And again, Beloved, I would remind you to be well groomed
and clothed in the Armour of Righteousness before you go forth
to do battle for Christ. Every plate of armour must be in its
right place. You must be beyond reproach to face the rigid world
as a teacher or instructor. Even the tiniest vice you may admit
into your human body, mind or spirit will prove to be a missing
plate in your protective Armour of Righteousness. Weigh care­
fully these words I now speak to you. I AM HERE.
My Beloved Messenger, there are many like you, who now
are ready to go forth unto the Harvest. Truly this is the harvest
125
LORD M A I T R E Y A
time. The closing of the Great Cycle has come. Those who are
mature in Life, Light, Love, Wisdom and Power, shall go forth
FREE. You shall RISE INTO SONSHIP WITH GOD. YOU
SHALL NOW ASCEND. I send you forth as my ambassadors.
Millions stand waiting for YOU. They have heard MY VOICE
in the stillness of the night. I have told them of MY COMING.
In their HEARTS they know ME. When you, My Blessed Mes­
senger, speak to them of ME, they will recall that they heard
MY VOICE.
When you do go forth, Beloved, into the byways and high­
ways of life, KNOW THAT I AM WITH THEE. Realize
that even the Words of Love shall be uttered in your mouth
through His Spirit, Lord Maitreya, that shall awaken your
hearers as by magic. Each Word of Mine is charged by the Intel­
ligent Power of Love. Each Word is Everlasting Life. Each
Word you utter IN HIS NAME AND SPIRIT shall radiate
forth that Godly Wisdom and Illumination that my Elder
Brother Jesus used centuries ago when Lord Maitreya sent Him
forth. WE ARE ONE IN CHRIST.
Your own Individual Spirit, My Beloved, knoweth the
FATHER. In your Higher Mental Body—the One who watches
over you—you were sent forth ages ago to carry a message to
your Brothers and Sisters of the Shadow now living in darkness
on this earth. I now empower you to go forth in His Name,
Lord Maitreya. Now you have the Power and Light to dissolve
all darkness. When a Brother of the Shadow comes near to
you, you have the Intelligent Light and Power to instantly strip
him of his wrongly qualified substance and energies. The Love-
Light radiating from your Golden Heart will take care of him.
He is powerless in the Presence of Christ Lord Maitreya. When
He is with you who can be against you? Therefore, Beloved, be
sure Christ is in your Heart before you step into the battlefield.
Look well to your Armour of Righteousness. I AM WITH
YOU ALWAYS IN ALL GOOD THINGS.
In the Sunlight of Silence I shall come to you, Beloved. Seek
solitude among the flowering works of Nature. In the stillness
of God’s creations I soothe the ruffled feelings of My Children.
In the noise and turmoil of the city I do not forget you. But you
have most forgotten ME. Children of Light, surely you have at
last learned your lesson. Will you not come into My Temple
again? Will you not listen to My Voice, the Voice of Love?
126
THE NE W G OL DE N AGE
Will you not, oh, Beloved, look for ME in these, Your Brothers?
Judge them not. They are but yourself in themselves. They are
this ONE LIFE manifest in many bodies, many minds and many
spirits. Whatsoever you do unto any one of them you do unto
Me, the Beloved Master. I AM SENT TO TEACH
THROUGH LOVE.
Look into your Heart of Gold, Beloved. Look deep and
long. Deeper stare, into the darkness of your being. See thou
there a Light? Even though but the tiniest spark, fan it. Feed
it fuel through Love. Breathe upon it My Light and Love. “Let
there BE LIGHT” ever so bright in thy Golden Heart. See it
expanding, see it enfolding, within you, and about you. “Know
ye not that thou art the Temple of the Living God?” Through
Him, Lord Maitreya, thou art made Whole. Call to your Father,
the God of the Golden Heart, Mahachohan. He hears you. He
answers your call, though feebly it may sound. He calls you
unto His Throne in the Golden Sun. The Prodigal Son He calls
Home again.
“In My Father’s House there are many mansions,” said My
Elder Brother centuries ago. Yes, Beloved, the Fields of Bliss,
too, are numerous. There are Heavenly places even on earth.
Seek out the Beauty Spots where God’s Light scintillates. Beneath
some flowering ledge you may meet the Master of Love. There
He may give you to drink from the “Chalice of Ecstasy.” There
He may come to speak to you, to teach you the ways of Love.
Your Faith, Beloved, may draw Him near unto you. If it were
not so I should not tell you. He cometh unto His own. “Fear
not. God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall
he also reap.”
Nature speaks in a strange voice, but beautifully if left alone.
She heals over all scars when Love is Her helpmate. Forget the
past, Beloved. Henceforth carry with you but the joys and beau­
ties of Life. The marks and blemishes that may have fallen upon
you are gone. The Light of Christ Maitreya dissolved them.
No single shadow remains. His Love-Light enfolds you. His
Love-Will directs you. His Power-Energy fills you. His Illum­
inating Spirit is ONE with you. Our Hearts beat as ONE in
the Glory of His Presence. You are not alone.
Go forth, Beloved, among the Sheep of My Fold. Lift up
the fallen. Heal the weak and weary ones, then teach them My
Truths before you pass on. Bless the stranger. Your ways may
seem strange to him, but he will not forget you. Memory of
127
LORD M A I T R E Y A
you will remain an example for him. Your healing Light will
glow and expand in his aura. Your words will preach sermons
to him long after you are gone. The Love you so stealthily set
aflame in his heart will surely expand. Some day it will claim
his whole being. Nothing IS but of God.
Listen unceasingly for my Voice in your Heart of Gold,
Beloved. You are now an Alchemist, “distilling that Sweet
Attar” in your Heart through Christ’s Love. Its life-giving
essence flows through your veins. It cleanses the very cells of
your brain. Your mind becomes crystal clear through His Love-
Light. Your entire body glows with His Warmth and Radiant
Love. You thrill with His feeling of immortality. He places
about you His Mantle. It is a Garment of Pink Light. He
places in your hand a Golden Sceptre. Radiant Gems encrust
its blazing receptacle. They scintillate forth the Powers of the
Seven Lords of Life, Light and Love. Remember your Garment,
Beloved. Forget not Thy Sceptre. These shall protect you
eternally. Love is the measure by which you shall mete. Love
determines the Vessel through which you receive. Without Love
thou art barren of all good things.
Christ’s Mystery lieth in your Heart. He calleth unto the
Four Angels of Creation through Love and they do His
bidding joyously.
128
CHAPTER XVII
We had thought—Ave Maria and I—that Christ had fully
incarnated in her on November 12, but there was much more
that had to be done in that body of hers before she could with­
stand higher vibrations of The Great Ones in the manner they
wished. She was told there would be another expansion of the
Cosmic Light in her body on November 29. This time it was
even more trying, and we might say, disturbing, to the outer
body than was the first preparation that had taken place on
November 12.
We learned that all such matters were definitely planned by
the Masters of the Great White Lodge. They placed much
emphasis upon the necessary protection for Ave Maria during
these times of stress in her body due to the expansion of the Light
within her. Strange, but several times nuns and priests of the
Catholic Church came there on the etheric plane, some of whom
might have done harm because of their limited understanding,
but being always seen, not only by Ave Maria, myself and Root
Hoomi, but other great beings of the Great Lodge, they were
powerless to even impress their empiric ideas of religious ruler-
ship in the least. There were others at various times of other
churches and empiric orders and organizations who were
attracted there. Archangel Michael stood beside the bed of Ave
Maria all during the night of November 29, and at other times
was present to protect her. Saint Germain, in His Higher Body,
would instantly appear at the slightest call from Her for protec­
tion. She was certainly guarded most closely. Any number of
Lords from the Cosmic Realms came to pay their respects to
her and to assure her of their protective love.
I must remind the reader again that I, while all this prepara­
tion for the incoming of Christ for the New Age was going on,
held the office in the Great White Lodge of SILENT
WATCHER. His powers were for the time being fully invested
in me. I assure you it would have been impossible for any harm
to come to Ave Maria at any time so long as I kept myself
reminded of the power of the SILENT WATCHER in me.
I could feel it at times with such potency and overpowering
radiance, it is no wonder He, the Silent Watcher has been
129
LORD M A I T R E Y A
referred to as the only ONE working in the world INDEPEND­
ENT OF TE1E LOGOS. He, as I understand it, has more
actually to do with the establishing of the Golden Age than any
other one Lord or God. He it is who has the Power of Almighty
God to do AT THIS TIME what is needed to be done in order
to handle the organized forces from the COSMIC STAND­
POINT who naturally, because of selfishness and power in the
outer world, are opposed to any economic changes that must be
brought about before Christ and His New Kingdom is actually
established on earth. Lord Maitreya explained to me how all
such organized forces that have been so long established on
earth preventing God’s Kingdom coming to this planet HAVE
LOST THEIR POWER.
He went on to explain that they possessed power only on
the three lower planes. This he meant to be the power of the
selfish ones. Of course there are selfish priests, ministers and
members to all churches and empiric orders and organizations.
He did not mean that the Catholic Church or any other church
is not for some good purpose in the world. But he did explain
to me that all such powers that they might have held in the past
from a selfish standpoint have been taken from them. In the
past, for instance, the Catholic Church of Rome, because of the
limited understanding of the ecclesiastical heads of the institution,
did many things in the Name of Christ, which, when we analyze
them now, were of the lower order of etheric spirits of selfishness.
Just as an individual has all of his trouble in becoming master
in his three lower bodies, so you may see how the THREE
LOWER BODIES OF ALL THE ECCLESIASTICAL
RULERS AS WELL AS THE OTHER KINGS OF THE
PAST ON EARTH HAVE CREATED CONSIDERABLE
HELL HERE FOR US HUMAN BEINGS TO CONTEND
WITH. There were times on earth, on Atlantis and Lemuria,
when every ruler was One With Christ. In fact the kings were
Christs incarnate. They were Gods Incarnate. Such is now taking
place. The very Gods are incarnating and will rule on this earth
for TWO THOUSAND YEARS, so Lord Maitreya has
informed me.
You will find, My Beloved Student, that all regarding these
matters are set by the Gods, just- as the stars of the heavens, and
if we master selfishness, jealousy, and all human weaknesses
such as history proves to us to have been THE CAUSE of all
the misery we have ever had on earth, then we shall enjoy human
130
THE NE W GOL DE N AGE
happiness through REAL BROTHERLY LOVE and the
Golden Age shall become an ACTUAL MATERIAL REAL­
IZATION. Whether it be Catholic, Jew, Protestant, Lions
Club, Rotary Club, the Masons, the Knights of Columbus,
Federation of Labor or whatnot, wherever selfishness and the
show of power exists for the purpose of providing for only a part
of God’s Children—SUCH POWERS OF SELFISHNESS
SHALL BE ABOLISHED IN THE NAME OF CHRIST
LORD MAITREYA. No longer can the demons of the Etheric
Plane torment the people of this world. Their nefarious schemes
will no longer work. “Truth crushed to earth shall rise again.”
This time the truth shall not only be made known to all True
Seekers, but each and all shall see for themselves, just as I have
seen the other planes and know when those selfish individuals
undertake to bother me in the etheric plane.
In order to make this clear to you I shall tell you of an
incident that was brought about by a Catholic Priest in Olympia,
Washington, one time. Many times I have observed such activ­
ities on the etheric plane, so I know whereof I speak, and I know
that such Black practices are to have no effect in the future upon
those of you who are Children of Light. I had published a little
magazine, as well as having first founded what is now the
Olympia News there. Occasionally I would publish something
regarding the New Age as I understood it. Again I might publish
something regarding the Theosophical Society and its teachings.
Of course in the past the Roman Hierarchy has been strongly
opposed to anything that might lessen their central power
empirically. That is quite natural, however, for any humanly
created organization. One night just after I had retired, about
eleven P. M., I had no more than gotten into bed, stretched out
on my back and relaxed, when Father O--------- appeared at
the side of my bed waving a wand about twelve inches long
over me. I looked at him quite sharply and he disappeared as
quick as a flash. I went to the Catholic parish a few days later
to pay a visit to Father O--------- . He was very nice to me.
I told him I had seen him in a vision and being interested very
much in religious matters, philosophy, etc., I felt that I should
call on him. I asked him about certain parts of the Scripture. It
was interesting to watch his reaction to my questions and state­
ments. Frankly, he did not seem to be human. His eyes had
a glassy stare as though he were hypnotized, or as though he
were endeavoring to hypnotize me. I did not tell him that I saw
131
LORD M A I T R E Y A
the magic wand he had used over me, nor did I explain to him
that I understood why Some Catholic priests used such practices
of the Dark Ages. But, Beloved, I know why they have used
them for centuries and I know why they still use them, and I
know why they do not have power any more over the less-
informed Children of God. It is because too many of us are
wise to those childish tricks of magic. And another reason is:
They are all of the etheric plane, WHICH IS NOT OF
GOD OR THE HIGHER MENTAL BODY. The whole
world, including all who may know a little etheric magic, must
rise into the HIGHER BODY and KNOW CHRIST. The
GODS OF LIGHT are with me in. this matter. That is why
I am not afraid of all the priests and ministers in the world.
Should they try to harm me THE MASTERS OF LIGHT
WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. “So mote it be.”
Now, Beloved, I am not picking on the Catholics. I mention
this incident, WHICH IS EVERY WORD TRUE, because
I want you to know the truth. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy
is the most powerful organization in the empiric realm. They
form an international network throughout the world. But that
does not make them any more like God than Aimee Semple
McPherson’s religious organization. However, that world-wide
net has held the common level of humanity down for centuries.
History proves this. The great Galilleo, the first astronomer to
state that the earth was round, was condemned by Inquisition,
simply because he would not change his statement at the request
of the Pope, who quite naturally thought the world was flat.
I dare say the Pope of Rome today admits that the world is
round, but I firmly believe and KNOW there are many principles
regarding CHRIST and HIS INCARNATION now for the
New Golden Age that even he (the Pope) needs to understand
and “experience,” otherwise he would not proclaim certain tenets,
subscribe to certain international activities under his direction,
and he WOULD advise IN THE NAME OF CHRIST some
very simple things that will ultimately bring about economic peace
throughout the world, which will be the basis upon which the
New Golden Age is to be founded.
I, Beloved, whoever you be, call to Lord Maitreya to bless
you eternally. And know this, My Friend and Seeker after Light,
I LOVE EVERY SOUL UPON THIS EARTH, ELSE I
WOULD NOT PROCLAM WITH SUCH POWER THE
VERY TRUTHS I AM WRITING. They are the TRUTH.
132
M a h -At m a h A msumata
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Lincoln said, “You can fool some of the people all the time, some
of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all the people
all the time.” I say it is now coming to be that you can not fool
anybody any of the time. I believe, also, that the priests and
ministers of the gospel have just about come to that same conclu­
sion, too. You cannot longer keep the truth from the people. And,
furthermore, you cannot longer DECEIVE the people. This book
gives the last great warning to the Brothers of the Shadow.
To return to the main thread of my narrative, it was on the
29th of November, too, that I was paid a visit by the Lord of
Venus. He came into the body of Ave Maria. The room was
filled with His radiance. He stood within three feet of me,
saluting me in a different manner than any salute I had received
from any other Master. For not less than five minutes that
radiant being stood there gazing at me. It may seem strange
to you but I knew what He was thinking all the time He was
looking at me. He looked into every part of my body, my mind
and spiritual being, I think, and He was wondering all the time
whether I would be able to “take it.” After He was well satisfied
I could stand the test, He gave me a blessing in still another
peculiar manner which I cannot reveal here. It was a special sign
and symbolism from the Planet Venus. All this time, mind you,
this Lord had not spoken a word. Following the blessing he
walked into the sitting room, the grace and beauty of his being
radiating through the body of Ave Maria. He sat on the far
side of the room, I took a chair not far from the kitchen door.
Neither of us had spoken a word, nevertheless, I am sure each
of us knew what the other was thinking. In a calm sweet voice
He said, “You have never sat in my aura before, have you?”
Thinking that probably he had been near me at some time
when I was not aware of Him, I replied, “No, have you ever
sat in mine?”
“Well, it isn’t for ME to sit in your aura,” he said in the
most kindly voice. He so loved me when He said it, and I felt
so ashamed of what I had said I assure you that I thought of
my answer and his reply most all the next day. However, even
though He is a God, I believe he misunderstood my meaning of
what I had said, but I dare say that when he got back to Venus
he told some of Elis Celestial Associates there that there was
ONE fellow down on the earth who was not afraid of the Gods
and who felt at least he possessed the potentialities of the Gods
and even looked forward to being ONE some day.
133
LORD MAI TREYA
The Lord of Venus, who later, during our conversation, told
me he was Anoma, explained a number of principles of life to
me, and somehow I felt He was the same individual as Buddha
Gautama or Maitreya. I do know and have proved since that
the Great Ones can play the part of many different beings. Why
shouldn’t they? They are at ONENESS with ALL. It was
Anoma who invested me with the power of the NEW NINTH
RAY. This RAY, in the hands of the Silent Watcher, I believe,
is the most powerful Ray coming into the earth realm at this
time. This is the Ray that is doing a marvelous “cleaning up”
work necessary before the New Golden Age can be peaceably
brought about, first “in the hearts” of mankind.
Yes, the power of the Ninth Ray is quite essential to me
in preserving my life in this physical body until the Gods get
through with me here on earth. I have seen that Ray used already
and I know what it will do any time I need to direct it as a pro­
tective power. And it was never given into my hands until the
Great Ones knew I would not abuse it or misuse it to the hurt
of innocent ones. Blessed Peter of the New Testament is an
example of where one of Christ’s “chosen” ones misused the
Light Rays entrusted to him. You have probably read how the
old lady and old man kept back part of their money from Peter
when all were asked to place their money and valuables into a
common fund. Yes, they no doubt lied to Peter, but Peter should
have handled the situation with a great deal more of Love than
he did. Instead he became exasperated, drew the “Thunder Bolt”
and the two poor ignorant, though selfish, followers dropped
dead. Well, Beloved, you may think that was God who struck
them dead, but I am of the honest opinion that it was Peter’s
temper that got away with him and having those great powers
with him he suddenly lost his head and actually directed the Rays
to them, killing them on the spot. So when anyone tells me of
the wonderful things Peter did I always think of those poor
ignorant ones he murdered.
To substantiate the above reference to Peter, as I have told
you in a previous chapter, I met him in Tacoma, Washington,
where he was embodied, and where he ascended in 1930. Now,
had Peter learned to control his fiery temper when he wras with
Jesus and after He ascended while in that embodiment, he might
have ascended and finished his earthly work several hundred
years ago. Harry Eyer, the body in which Peter embodied in
Tacoma, was a marvelous teacher of the mysteries and the Holy
134
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Bible. He was fearless in his denunciation of all things evil,
and explained to his eager audiences as well as his private students
the most abstruse laws regarding the mysteries and the Cosmic
Light that had ever been brought forth on earth at that time.
He actually enlarged much upon the limited knowledge regarding
the Cosmic Light that Millikan had discovered a few years
previous. He told me how a number of years before Millikan
made his discoveries he had, on the inner planes of consciousness,
made numerous discoveries regarding the Cosmic Light and
experimented with it considerably.
It happened that Mr. Eyer passed from the earth plane
while I was in another part of the United States on a lecture tour.
When I returned to Tacoma, after his decease, I visited with
Mrs. Eyer, who, too, was an Adept, and she told me of the
marvelous work her husband had done the last week he was in
the physical octave. While he was sick that week, she explained,
Jesus came and was with him most all the time. It was necessary
that a Great Being of Peter’s power and understanding, should
do a certain work in preparation for the incoming Golden Age.
Here is what he did, according to Mrs. Eyer: He went through
the stratosphere of the earth and on into the Cosmic Center and
carried a cable of Light through from the Cosmic Heart of Crea­
tion back through the stratosphere into this octave of life here on
earth. He, with the help of Jesus and other Masters of the Great
White Lodge, opened the way, in spite of all the organized selfish
Anti-Christs, “wolves in sheep’s clothing,” etc., yes,—THEY
OPENED THE WAY FOR THE GOLDEN AGE. THEY
BROUGHT INTO THIS HELL THAT WAS CREATED
BY THE BLACK FORCES ON THIS PLANET A NEW
COSMIC ELEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DOING ITS
MARVELOUS WORK ALL THESE YEARS SINCE. Look
closely into this matter just related and you will find the cause
of the history-making “WALL STREET CRASH.”
Brother Eyer (Peter) had just recently returned from Port­
land, where he had delivered a number of lectures on this new
Cosmic Element. Well, Beloved, they got Brother Eyer out of
the body, but he brought in the Cosmic Light that has made it
possible for all the Spiritual Awakening that has come about
in the masses of mankind since 1929. All hail Brother Eyer, a
Blessed Member of the Great White Lodge.

CHAPTER XVIII
During the month of December, our instruction — Ave
Maria’s and mine—continued unabated. It was December 11
that Lord Maitreya informed me I was to teach Ave Maria
something regarding the Mantras and Sutras of the Orient I
had received through the Universal Brotherhood. Now, she
did not know I was a member of that order, nor did she know
that I was conscious of my association with the Masters on the
inner planes. She was somewhat surprised when Lord Mait­
reya, in her presence, told me that I should teach her, for,
frankly, she, in her outer mind, had not considered me anything
of a teacher. I had been so wholly taken up with what had come
to me through Ave Maria and the other Masters I assure you I
was not a little surprised myself when the Great Lord told
me to instruct her.
For twelve years I had received instruction and training
under various Directors of the Universal Brotherhood. I am
not permitted to give their names, but they are numerous all
over the world. But, remember this, Brothers of Light, all
empiric orders and brotherhoods so-called are under the direc­
tion of the Council of the Great White Lodge, and Lord Mait­
reya is the Divine Director over all activities, inner and outer.
Lord Maitreya checked over all the Mantras and Man-
trie Blessings I had carried over my heart for the past twelve
years. Each one he read and checked. Lord Maitreya, I might
tell you now, is the only Great Master among all the Lords and
Masters in this Universe, I was told by another, who under­
stands all languages, dialects and tongues spoken on this earth
by any and all races, nations, clans and tribes. He can speak a
decree into the ethers of this world, too, and every living indi­
vidual upon this earth will understand it instantaneously and
simultaneously in his own mind as though it were spoken in his
own tongue. As we come to the Universal understanding of
Christ this is not so impossible of understanding.
As Lord Maitreya checked over those Mantras He came
to one which was not “shaped” as it should be. “Who was your
Director?” He asked, meaning, of course, the one who had sent
136
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
me the documents of study and the mantras He was examining.
I gave Him the name of the One who had been my Director up
until about a year previous, when all documents stopped.
“There is something wrong here,” He explained. “It is no
wonder you have had so much difficulty. You should have been
advanced long ago. He did not wish to advance you because
you would have superseded him. Such symbols have great
power. He has kept you in the ‘material’.”
“It might be that he did not understand,” I said, hoping to
give the erring brother the “benefit of the doubt.”
“Oh, yes, he did understand,” He exclaimed in a firm voice.
And then He very positively affirmed, “HE WHO WANTED
TO BE FIRST SHALL BE LAST.”
Here, My Blessed Seeker, is an instance when the Great
Divine Director of this Universe came forth to see that I, a
Brother of the Universal Brotherhood who had been wronged,
should be put in my rightful place. “Whatsoever a man soweth
that shall he also reap.” How that saying of Jesus’ had gone
through my mind hundreds and hundreds of times. Never,
Beloved, had I doubted the Truth of that declaration of law.
Be patient and whatsoever is to come to you through the laws
of justice, shall reach you when you least expect it.
I gave Ave Maria, under the direction of Lord Maitreya,
the various instructions I should. He at the same time declared
me a GURU, which means in the words of the Western World,
Master-Teacher.
At that time Mrs. Mary Todd, of Eureka, was staying with
Ave Maria in Mount Shasta City. She had lived at my hotel
in Eureka, was an ardent student of the “I AM” teachings of
Saint Germain, and received much instruction from Ave Maria,
myself and other Masters. She was later carried so high into
the Higher Teachings that her physical body could not with­
stand the vibration. She had physical reactions that all but took
her out of the body. Later, however, she was healed by Koot
Hoomi, myself and others. She consciously went through the
“crucifixion,” so she said when she appeared to Ave Maria and
me in spirit in May, 1941. It is my earnest prayer that she has
attained the ascension she sought so fervently. I am not in touch
with her at this time in the outer plane. She had been a great
admirer of my little son David, who ascended.*
*1 later contacted this lady in Willits, Calif., May 27, 1942, found her well and
happy, thus verifying all I had learned through the Spirit.—A u th o r.
137
LORD MA I T R E Y A
A few days before Christmas Joshua came to me, giving
me much instruction of great importance to me, since I was soon
to leave for the North, where I was to do certain work in the
interest of the Great White Lodge. Saint Germain had told
Koot Hoomi to tell me that I should get out and do some hard
work, physical work, which was essential before I could ascend.
There were certain atomical changes that should take place in
my body, Koot Hoomi explained, as a matter of purification,
before I would be able to receive certain other initiations and
states of consciousness so necessary in the future work I was
expected to do.
Joshua knew I was to go north. She knew I was to be given
severe tests, too, as well as the “hardening” work I was to do.
In other words, Friends of the Light, I was to be placed on
PROBATION. If I passed the tests I was to return to Mt.
Shasta to receive the “Fifth Initiation.” If I were to pass
through the Fifth, then I was to be “crucified.” Should I pass
safely through the Crucifixion, then I would ASCEND. Joshua
spoke to me so compassionately, so beautifully, regarding my
trip north. She said, “You may wonder why so much has been
put upon you, John, but it is BECAUSE THE MASTERS
LOVE YOU SO MUCH. They want you to finish the neces­
sary work as quickly as possible, so you will be through. I do
not like to see you go up north, but they tell me it is essential
to your mastery. Remember, whatever you contact, call upon
us and we will be with you.”
I had nothing to say but, “Yes, Joshua, I understand.” It
seemed that everything she told me I understood within myself
before she spoke. However, the more she spoke to me in that
sweet little voice of hers, the more joyously I could go forth to
do whatever the Masters required of me. She was certainly
preparing me, warning me, arming me, for whatever might
come my way. For about an hour she talked to me, love radiat­
ing from her Blessed Heart, charging every word she spoke.
Before she left I am sure the most excruciating suffering that
might have befallen me could have been endured joyously,
rejoicingly, since I knew that all was for the purpose of pre­
paring me for the BLESSED ASCENSION. GOD BLESS
JOSHUA!
Near the first of December I had been sent on a mission by
Lord Maitreya to Eureka, California. I had been a leader in
the “I AM” movement there under the Ballards, as you will
138
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
recall. Lord Maitreya placed on my finger a ring of Koot
Hoomi’s which Ave Maria had received while in Tibet. It is
a gold ring with the letters KH interwoven upon it. I did not
know just what Lord Maitreya wanted me to do. I asked him
about this. He replied, “You go ahead and do what you think
you should do. I do not interfere with-my Priests. You are
now one of my Priests. Should you start to make a mistake I
will let you know. I DO NOT ALLOW MY PRIESTS TO
MAKE MISTAKES. THIS RING WILL PROTECT YOU
WHILE YOU ARE AWAY FROM HERE.”
I saw a number of things I felt should be done while in
Eureka. I informed all those who had been associated with
me in the “I AM” activity what I had contacted in Mt. Shasta.
I frankly told them of my marvelous experiences. I know Lord
Maitreya wanted it published, for I knew it was to be a part
of the future “build-up,” so to speak, essential in broadcasting
the TRUE EXPERIENCES of the ASCENSION of myself
and Joshua. Most of those I talked to in Eureka, accepted my
message from the Masters, however, many of them wrote in
to Los Angeles to Mrs. Ballard, asking her about it. How­
ever, Mrs. Josephine Barker, the one who succeeded me as
Group Leader in Eureka, and one whom I loved very much,
permitted me to talk to the students in the Eureka Sanctuary
following her regular group meeting. I invoked the Masters
and their Blessings in the Sanctuary, made the “SIGN AND
SALUTATION OF THE GREAT CENTRAL SUN,” and
explained to the Blessed Ones present what would be coming
about within the next few months upon earth. I was greatly
inspired. I spoke with such power it actually shook the building.
I am certain all True Students of Saint Germain’s felt those
words spoken on the inner levels. That is what Lord Maitreya
wanted, I found later. He wanted the Truth radiated through­
out the whole “I AM” group, and He knew that that would
have to be done in one of their regular meeting places in order to
meet or BLESS the EGOIC GROUP. It was done beautifully, so
I was informed by Lord Maitreya when I returned to Mount
Shasta. He almost wept with joy when he told me how per­
fectly I had performed the duties I had been called upon to do.
It was only after that enlightening experience in His charge
that I began to feel the importance of my being a PRIEST OF
LORD MAITREYA’S. All my life I had prayed to be a True
139
LORD MAI TREYA
Minister of the Gospel. I had vowed never to teach or preach
about anything I had not experienced. Now, I thought, I can
go forth into the world with the GREATEST MESSAGE
EVER BROADCAST TO THE WORLD. “How Blessed I
AM,” I repeated to myself again and again. “It is all like a
dream, but I know it is true.”
Following is a letter received by one of the Group Leaders
in Eureka following my visit there for Lord Maitreya:
THE BILTM O RE HOTEL
515 So. Olive St.
Room 9309
Los Angeles, California
Dec. 16, 1940
Beloved One of the Light:
Your letter of December 8th, as well as that of several others from
Eureka, have been received.
Because of more important matters needing my attention at this time,
I will not go into detail regarding the matter you refer to, for the Student
Body knows the Law concerning such things. For your information and
peace of mind, I will state that I have had no contact with M r. Norman
Westphal* personally or otherwise, regarding his new adventure, nor do
I know anything concerning it.
As you know, Students are quite free to follow whatsoever they desire,
and if they accept something outside of the “I A M ” Activity as more
important to them, then their cards will be removed from our files, and
they will not be permitted to attend our classes.
W ith all the Love of my Life-stream, I call to the “Mighty I AM
Presence” and Great Host of Ascended Masters, to take command of
every “I A M ” Student in your city, charge them with Ascended Master
wisdom, Discriminating Intelligence, Invincible Protection, and see they
do the Perfect thing.
Sincerely in the Light,
(Signed) M RS. G. W . BALLARD.
As soon as I returned to Mt. Shasta I wrote Mrs. Ballard
regarding all that had transpired. I venture that she received
my letter a few hours after she had written the above letter to
the many Eureka inquirers, providing Mrs. Ballard knew her
secretary had written such a letter, since I sometimes wonder if
Mrs. Ballard knows all the activities of her trusted secretary.
*Mrs. Ballard spelled my name with a “p,” which significantly told me something
of the sinister forces who were evidently controlling her activity.—A u th o r.
140
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
On Christmas Eve, while a number of us were gathered
about a Christmas tree, a beautiful five-pointed STAR OF
LIGHT actually descended into the room, evidently falling
upon the head of Ave Maria. She exclaimed, “There is the
Star of Christ. He is fully incarnated on earth. Amsumata,
we have accomplished the work expected of us much earlier
than the Masters had planned. This is the greatest Christmas
Eve this world has witnessed since Jesus was on earth most two
thousand years ago.”
Koot Hoomi had told us previously that the Christ would
step forth fully illuminated by March 10, 1941. As it was,
He came forth in His Glory on Christmas Eve, 1940. As I
was leaving that evening for Eureka again on a business trip,
we enjoyed our Christmas party, opening the packages, rejoic­
ing in the Great Spiritual Event, making the children happy
who were present. My four children, Norman, Jr., James,
Edward and Anne Elizabeth, as well as Mrs. Mary Todd, were
present with Ave Maria.
May the Blessing of Lord Maitreya, Christ to this Solar
System, descend upon all Children of Light throughout the
world and may we again sing, “ALL LIGEITS UNITED IN
THE ONE GREAT LIGHT.”
I am so very happy, Blessed Maitreya, that at last the world
is approaching to that illuminating point where they will under­
stand your Light and Love. It is the most transcendent vision
to see all Churches, all Light Groups, all Constructive Organi­
zations in this world coming INTO THE ONE GREAT
LIGHT.
Just think of it, Blessed Students of Light, HOW MAR­
VELOUS IT WILL BE WHEN CATHOLICS, PROTES­
TANTS, JEWS, Mohammedans, Buddhists, Brahmans, Con-
fucianists, and any and all religions and philosophies combine
together in that ONE GREAT LIGHT WHICH IS GOD
ALMIGHTY. Think of the misery and “HELL” we have
caused each other in the world in the past because of our igno­
rance of the WAYS OF GOD AND HIS LIGHT. When we
look back over the BLACK PAGES in THE BOOK OF
EARTH LIFE, do you not shudder with horror? How
happy we are—Saint Germain and all the Spirits in My Life-
stream—when I see the NEW JERUSALEM, as a mighty
SHIP, just in the offing, ready to ENTER THE HARBOR
NOW PREPARED BY THE TRUE CHILDREN OF
141
LORD MA I T R EYA
LIGHT. It matters not to me, Blessed Ones of Light, what
outer church or group you regard yourself in association. Look
deeply into your heart, BE TRUE TO YOURSELF and call
to the ONE MASTER who resides therein. He will hear your
VOICE whenever you SPEAK THOUGH LOVE, for all Love
comes from His Heart, THE LORD OF LOVE, MAITRE1 A,
CHRIST TO THIS UNIVERSE. When you know Christ
you become ONE WITH HIM. When you understand this
SIMPLE MYSTERY you will have known Christ is not “here
nor there,” but in the HEARTS of those who LOVE HIM.
He knoweth His Own. “Let not your heart be troubled. I
AM WITH THEE ALWAYS.” When Thou, My Beloved,
knoweth ONE MASTER thou knoweth ALL MASTERS, for
“We are ONE BODY WEE.” Let all who have “open ears”
hear, and all with “open eyes,” SEE THE TRUTH.
Now that the priests, bishops, cardinals, and all ecclesiasti­
cal rulers of the Roman Catholic Church and all other Catholic
Churches, and all religions in the world, know THEY MUST
ASCEND INTO THE HIGHER PLANES IN ORDER TO
WIELD ANY POWER ANY MORE, WE SHALL ESTAB­
LISH THE NEW KINGDOM.
142
CHAPTER XIX
January 9, 1941, my three sons and myself left Mt. Shasta
for Olympia, Washington, where a younger brother of mine
resides. Although my brother had always been harmonious with
me, I was not surprised to learn that he and his wife were not
willing to cooperate with me a great deal in taking care of the
children. I did not blame them, however, but knew that oppo­
sition was due to my spiritual development. They did, how­
ever, agree to take care of my youngest son, Edward, tempo­
rarily, at least. This I greatly appreciated.
Through a friend of mine in Bremerton, Washington, I was
able to get the kind of employment there I needed. I had lived
in Bremerton previously, and was able to get a job working on
the county highways. Charles Kleinfelter, a former friend and
student of mine and one of the county commissioners of Kitsap
County, gave me employment. I worked hard there a part of
January, February and part of March. Housing conditions
were terrible in Bremerton. For the first few weeks we stayed
at the Navy Y.M.C.A., but because of the need of all available
quarters being needed by the government men we were forced
to leave there. For some time we were compelled to sleep in a
damp basement—the two boys and myself—where nine of us
were quartered in most undesirable conditions. The boys became
sick with the measles, but were not long in getting well. I was
also unable to work for one day. Cost of board and lodging
required all I could make, since I earned but little more than
$100 per month.
While working on that road job I really over-did the matter
of hardening up my muscles and preparing my body for what
Saint Germain had asked. A time or so I lifted too much. I did,
however, enjoy the work. Much of the time it rained. I had
good rain clothes, rubber boots and everything to make the
work agreeable, yet I had much difficulty becoming adjusted to
the climate, the work, as well as the clothing. I was wet with
perspiration inside the clothes most of the time and wet from
rain outside. My body did pass through certain alchemical
changes. I was actually so tired many evenings when I came
143
LORD MAI TR EYA
in from work I would almost fall into a chair where I would
fall asleep to wake up later chilled by the wet clothing I had on
my body. It was during this trying ordeal that Saint Germain
appeared to me in spirit—in that damp, dirty basement—with
a large White-Light Five-Pointed Star which He presented to
me, stating to me in certain well-understood words that I had
PASSED THE TESTS. I knew then that my “hardening” and
re-chemicalization work was finished. I notified Mr. Kleinfelter
that I was quitting, and moved to Seattle. There I planned to
give a few lectures.
I delivered three lectures at the Gowman Hotel in Seattle,
April 27, 28 and 29. There were but eighteen or twenty people
attended. The lectures were little advertised. All who attended
were greatly enthused and asked to keep in touch with me. Mrs.
Maud Brown assisted me a great deal while at the Gowman
Hotel and in other ways helped me in caring for my sons while
there. Mahatma Koot Hoomi appeared to me while at the hotel,
explaining to me certain instructions.
Knowing that I was expected in Mount Shasta by May 11,
1941, to receive certain other initiations, I left Seattle May 9,
arriving there early in the morning of May 10.
Before I continue with the initiatory work I received I wish
to quote for you a letter I was compelled by the Spirit of Lord
Maitreya to write to the outer personality of “She Who Is
Nameless” while at the Y.M.C.A. in Bremerton. This letter
was necessary to bring about complete harmony between us in
the outer activity, which, invariably, is something each and every
Student of Light has to contend with as they travel the “Path
of Attainment.” The letter, self-explanatory, follows, and was
principally for the purpose of developing more LOVE in “HER”
outer person, since she had become overbalanced with “WIS­
DOM AND POWER.” Kindly notice the wisdom Lord Mait­
reya used in the letter. It follows :
March 2, 1941.
Y.M .C.A.
Bremerton, Wash.
Blessed One of the Light:
Even though I do not agree with you in all you have written me,
however, I was exceedingly happy to hear from you, and sincerely ask
Lord Maitreya and the entire Host of Ascended Masters shed their Light
and Intelligence, Wisdom and Power—AND L O V E —upon you, and
keep it forever sustained. May D IV IN IT Y attend you eternally.
144
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I hope you will not be irritated with me should I be most frank with
you. M y desire—just as yours is, I know—is to assist every individual
who needs help. When—even— the body or personality of an Ascended
Master such as I have every reason to believe you are, really needs help,
it is up to me to do my utmost to help you. TH IS IS THE L A W . I
K N O W THE L A W . Even if I never attained what I desire to attain,
still I K N O W W H A T I SHOULD AT T AIN , for I K N O W THE
L A W OF M Y OW N FREE W IL L AND ACCORD and BECAUSE
OF M Y DIVINE RIGH T. You can never attain more than I aspire
to attain. It may be possible that you have attained more than I at
present. This is beside the point. You have not yet proved to me that
you are W ISER.
You speak of standing alone as a PILLAR in one paragraph, and
even in the beginning of your letter you wrote, “I was not moved before
today to write you. AS SOON AS I W A S TO LD TO DO SO I
D ID .” In other words you have to be told what to do. Regarding such
matters as writing to ONE IN THE LIG H T — a Brother— I do not
have to be told when to write. To be most frank I might suggest that
when you K N O W THE L A W well enough to know what to do without
being told, then it might be well for you to preach to others about being
a STRON G PILLAR, standing alone and travelling alone. Please for­
give me if this sounds harsh. M y Heart decided.
You say your misson is not my mission. I do not believe this, for
OUR M ISSION and the mission of every TRU E IN ITIATE is to
ESTABLISH THE GR EAT KIN GD O M ON EARTH “AS IT IS
IN HEAVEN.” Understand, please, that I do not wish to be irreverent,
nor would I say or write one single thing that would deter you from the
Pathway of Light, however I must be true to my Own Presence, My
Individual Master, for it is only by being TRUE TO M YSELF TH AT
I M A Y BE TRUE T O YO U AND ALL M ASTERS AND ALL
M ANKIND.
You mention the note I wrote to you about “going straight to the
Boss.” W ell, my dear, did not Lord Maitreya tell me to do so? You
might recall, if you have forgotten, that Many times Lord Maitreya told
me things that you were not aware of. Are you higher than Lord
Maitreya? Are you higher than God Almighty of the Great Central
Sun? W H O A M I? Have you a right to “judge me” ? Please, dear,
better not judge others. Remember, my Dear Sister, we are both teachers—
natural and Divinely Inspired— and it is up to each of us as well as all
aspiring human beings, Masters, Gods, Lords, Archangels— or what not—
to bear with each other, help each other, love each other, for, after all,
LOVE IS THE GREATEST OF A L L AT T AIN M E N T S OR POS­
SESSIONS, for it is the Universal, Infinite Cement of Understanding.
W IT H O U T IT YO U CANNOT SU RM O U N T THE L A ST FEW

145
LORD M A I T R E Y A
W ISD O M , AND POWER, and if you already have them you cannot
hold them without LOVE — D I V I N E L O V E .
I love you, otherwise I would not be so rigid and frank with you,
and remember, I can be STERN. I have much LOVE for ALL human­
ity, not just a few Chosen Masters. He who has ears to hear let him
hear, and she, too.
Let us not swell up with pride over our attainments, especially in
the physical octave, for IT is such a SM ALL PART of ALL LIFE,
LOVE, W ISD O M AND POW ER.
You have wondered why Blessed Koot Hoomi weeps so much. I do
not wonder, for I, too, weep much— not because of myself, but because of
the lack of understanding, love, wisdom, etc., of humanity in general. The
saddest thing in all the world to me is the lack of wisdom, and the heed­
lessness of human beings. Even though, however, I cannot help but feel
happy when I think of the great advancement that has been made by the
masses of mankind during the past 2,000 years, since my Blessed Elder
Brother Jesus came in His ministry. May His Great W ork go on, and
my dear, may you and all Masters of Light realize the importance of
OUR M ISSION in establishing the Great Kingdom of God on Earth
as it is in Heaven.
Please forget not what you came here to do. Question yourself dili­
gently, lovingly, and remember no one can rise higher than God Almighty,
and surely all of us aspire to LIVE IN THE GOLDEN H EART OF
GOD.
Incidentally, He who gives up all finds ALL. He who would give up
This Life shall find REAL LIFE EVERLASTING. It is probable,
my dear, that the things you prize— IN THE OUTER W O R LD —-I
do not consider at all valuable. I do know, however, that I am being
trained for a very important work to be done after the Big Change, and
I am certain, whether you acknowledge it or not, SHOULD YO U DO
T H A T W H ICH YO U W ERE SENT TO DO, our paths will cross
many times, and we must assist each other in all possible ways in the
work of the Great Kingdom in the Great Circle. Personally, you are
just a human being to me; spiritually you are a DIVINE M ASTER.
Verily, I believe I see more in YO U than you SEE in yourself.
The old saying is “Ye cannot serve two Masters.” It is the One Great
Master, the Master of Masters, the Lord of Lords, I look to. And you?
Meekness before God is a paramount principle for all Masters to
consider. True humbleness is the Key to His Kingdom, Joshua. You have
such a full and complete Love. (Notice here, I am writing to Joshua
through Her Mother.) Your gentleness is expressed through the sweetness
of your musical voice. You have supplied the necessary solvent to my
146
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
toughened heart, and changed it back again to the tenderness of mother-
love. Abracadabra. May every cell within my physical body be transmuted
into the Universal Gold of the Alchemists. May your love, my Blessed
Twin, ever remain my protective mantle.
Yes, I was greatly privileged to have been taught by A. M. The love
She expressed for me ONE D AY shall live for thousands of years. I
recall the first time I saw her in this embodiment—before I met J ............
— on an inner plane of consciousness, walking a lonely road— I remarked
when I embraced Her, “I have not seen you for a thousand years.” I
wept with joy. She first came in the form of a dove, then took on the
form of A.M . and said “I A M M A R IA .”
I am becoming much more in tune with you and others on the inner
planes, Joshua. M y All-Seeing Eye is opening. Lord Maitreya opened
it for me, so He said. I am His Disciple— His Priest. He seems closer
to me than any other, although I feel I must “walk close to Koot Hoomi.”
I have never yet asked Lord Maitreya for a thing that He has not given
it to me. Of course I do not ask Him for non-essential things. I want
to do what He and the Great Presence inspire me to do. He once said
to me, “I do not allow my Priests to make mistakes.” (Please consider.)
The fact that A. M. has gone to the Sun proves Her Infinite Love.
Remember, Joshua, I may make mistakes in the physical octave, but
they are made usually in an endeavor to prove the goodness of God’s Love.
M y Great Presence— the Silent Watcher—does not permit me to stray
far from the eternal Pathway of God’s Light.
So you, Joshua, are chosen to be the Virgin of Wisdom of Joshu.
W hat a blessing! I knew you were going through great initiations, and
I A M with you A L W A Y S in your trials for Supreme Mastery.— S.W .
Regarding the money matters, J ............, I am doing very well, but am
paid by the month, and only received a half month on the 13th of Feb.,
and do not get paid again until the 14th of this month. I shall take care
of all obligations. I am working with this in mind. I told A ............ I
would have to be back there in May. She has a lot of my things there she
is keeping for me. She should not be uneasy. I have had so little time to
write, I hope she will forgive me. Usually I am so tired at night I do not
feel able to do anything but rest. You see, I am doing very hard work—
pick and shovel— the hardest of labor. I feel that it is essential to my
present unfoldment. Please rest assured I am doing all I can. I shall be
in Mt. Shasta in May, God willing.
Night before last Dorothy walked into the room when I was sitting
alone. (In her finer body.) She was very happy. I saw the door open.
She did not think I saw her at first. It made me very happy. I am sure
she is attaining higher and higher planes all the time. She is a busy
Master. She helps me, too.

LORD MA I T R E Y A
I received a letter from dear Mrs. Barker. She said Anne was a
wonderful child, so little bother, and she was so glad to have her there
for a while. I must write to Anne soon. Kiss her for me. She is precious
to all of us. The boys are fine. Edward is with my brother in Olympia.
Give my love and best wishes to Mrs. Todd. I feel very close to her
at times. I talk to Dr. LaC. occasionally.
Lovingly in the Light,
(Not Signed)
P.S.—J ............, should you see fit to do so, and are not too provoked
with me, I hope you will mail this letter back to me, as I would like
to keep it for future reference. Or, should you keep it, I can get it when
I return to Shasta. W ill you kindly do this for me? And will you con­
sider the letter entirely impersonally, for I am sure it comes to you from
ONE BEYOND me in this world? And I do pray that you will not be
irritated too much with me about it. It is your Higher Self I love. I
am not infatuated with you in any other way. Please bear this in mind.
OUR M ISSION is beyond any personal feelings.
Divine Love,
Norman.
Even though I had not slept any on the night of May 9
while I was travelling from Seattle to Mount Shasta City, by
9 o’clock on the morning of the 10th Ave Maria and I were
walking toward Mt. Shasta, talking of the many experiences
we had encountered while apart. We looked up to the sun in
the heavens when we were surprised to see the “Rings of Buddha”
clearly radiating about it like an enlarged picture of the “Rain­
bow Spirit.” Ave Maria knelt on her knees for a few minutes in
supplication to The Lord of Lords.
We soon returned to the abode of Ave Maria where we ate
lunch and later talked over the work we were to do in the interest
of the Great White Lodge. The following day, May 11, we
understood to be a day when certain initiations were to be given
us as well as some others who might be there in body or in
spirit. Ave Maria had made arrangements for such an occa­
sion. We prepared an altar in the yard under a shady apple
tree. There on May 11 at “High Noon” we, Anne Elizabeth,
Ave Maria and I, sitting together, invoked the blessings of the
Great Lords.
148
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Among other instructions and initiatory degrees conferred
upon us I received the following letter from Ave Maria, signed
by her in her outer name signature:
High Noon
May 11, 1941.
M t. Shasta, Calif.
The following I am asked to give to the Masters of the Western
Hemisphere:
Christ was in body on the morning of 12/27/40, drawing the Presence
closer and closer to the body. Buddha Gautama, a Lord from Venus, came
in His full Presence, then Christ spoke:
“Christ and Buddha will now extend the hands of their Presence, each
others hands. Sun Christ and Sun Buddha now unite into oneness and
express as the ONE SUN in Jehovah’s Kingdom.”
The Voice of Jehovah was heard: “M y Son I am well pleased in
this Union.”
Then Master Koot Hoomi stepped through saying: “M y labors are
now over. There were two years when I labored heavy for the Union
of the two Sons of Jehovah. They were years of suffering and pains, but
I am so happy to know that this, which was a great strain for Ave Maria
(M ary) and myself, is accomplished.” “May the world know,” he said,
“She must know that the Union has happened. I, myself, and Ave Maria
claim but one thing, ‘W e lay ourselves a foundation for the Great Temple
(of the Great Temple) of the Golden Age in which two great pillars are
standing— Christ and Buddha, and the Two in ONENESS—THE
GREAT SUN, that shall shine over the Great Waters, and never shall
She go down, but is SHINING BRIGH T IN THE KIN GD O M OF
JEH O VAH .’ ”
(Signed) E. S.
Blessed Students of Light, this letter is the confirmation of
the unifying of the EAST and the WEST in the ONE GREAT
PEIILOSOPHY OF LIFE. One God blesses all mankind. On
the 11th of May, 1941, the Great Mahatma Koot Hoomi did
come forth to declare, in writing, through Ave Maria, that
ALL LIGHTS ARE NOW UNITED IN THE ONE
GREAT LIGHT.
Let us be thankful, Brothers and Sisters of Light throughout
the world, that at last we can see the Universal Christ in the
Light of God Almighty radiating throughout the East and the
West as the all-enfolding Presence in Blessing all mankind.
In September, 1940, Ave Maria had sent to me a paper to
be published in the Scott Valley Beacon, a weekly newspaper I
149
LORD MAI TREYA
published at Etna, California. That article, which she had titled
“Man Know Thyself,” was misplaced somehow and never pub­
lished. Months later, after I had left Etna, I found it among
some valuable papers of my own. I now realize that the article
was not to have been published at that time for reasons the Mas­
ters best understand, but I here produce the paper for your
perusal, which follows:
M AN K N O W TH YSELF
W e have invented means to talk thousands of miles by wire, radio,
television and telephone. A ll are man’s creations. But has man progressed
within as well? Is he transforming his own consciousness into the highest
consciousness possible ? I am speaking of the spiritual man.
In the midst of strange world conditions comes to me, my reader, a
call. “Man Know Thyself” are the very words that were written over
the temples of initiation of the lost world of Atlantis, in the temples of
Greece, of Egypt and Tibet, and these very words are the words that were
spoken by the Masters to their disciples.
If we wish to understand these great wise men of Atlantis we must
let their mind, TH EIR CONSCIOUSNESS, guide us, and the Master-
Mind will FILL US, and find expression through those that have
acquired mastery.
How can we understand the language of the Masters except we
become aware of the powers of the inner man? the true Self? the God
within? unless we give up the world as Christ taught us? This means entry
into our heart, which we must fill with pure thoughts, as the heart is
the Sanctuary of God.
How can we become a follower of the Star, a part of the Brotherhood
of Love? To be initiated into this Brotherhood of Love we must give up
greediness, gossip, fault-finding, and rather become the uplifters of those
that are still in a sleeping state of mind, and we, by doing so, become leaders
of a new generation that is willing to take up the threads of the wise men
of old. W e must be willing to be guided by their wisdom.
Where are the Seers today? Where are the Masters? I hear some
question me. For a second I want to speak to the hearts of those that
question this.
Is it possible that you who are greedy and material-minded w ill hear
the voice of the wise men, the Messengers of God? You that doubt their
existence are the cause of the Masters fleeing today into silence and
obscurity. They become visible for those that believe in them.
Is a communication with the Masters possible ? There is such possibil­
ity. The Masters teach us this: The communications can be between two
mental bodies, between two emotional bodies, between two etheric portions
of two brains. There are three types of telepathy—etheric, emotional and
150
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
mental. The Master sends out a mystic or sacred geometrical symbol,
such as a triangle, a cross, an eight-pointed cross, a cube, an Egyptian cross
or Tau into the etheric substance so that it can be seen by one having
etheric sight. While in the creating of this symbol he sends out etheric
waves. Those waves strike another brain and reproduce in the other brain
an image. Three persons might react to the sacred symbol sent out, each
in a different manner. One might see it in his mind’s eye as a triangle,
another may see the word “triangle”, and the third party may mentally
perceive it. The most active sense will be affected either through the
eye, the ear or the brain.
Emotional telepathy is different than etheric telepathy. The emotional
telepathy is connected with visions or premonitions. The recipient will
become aware of either a vision or a spoken word. Our emotions are felt
by the Masters and they, feeling the sorrow or gloom of others, radiate
to the ones in distress with a wave of healing thoughts, peace, love and
harmony. Mental telepathic thoughts are communicated from the mind
of the sender to the mind of the recipient.
As our race evolves and enters the higher mind for good, for harmo­
nizing the individual mind, the race will be allowed to use such telepathy
and also attune herself to the Universal Mind, the Infinite Mind, so that
Wisdom may come to earth again and the Star of the Wise Men may
shine on our path, and the Lost Word will become the Found Word, and
then man is ready to awaken the God within his heart. The Embodied
Lord then becomes the conscious ruler of Life, Light, Wisdom—the I AM .
151
CHAPTER XX
LONGING
I long for freedom in the world of man,
And peacefulness in it from end to end;
For a place of retreat where silence is found,
So quiet that but my heart-beats may sound
To remind me that I A M ONE W IT H GOD,
Father of man, beast, plant and sod.
I pray that His beauty reign supreme;
That each individual read His theme
And know the plan of the Great Architect
Unfolds to each man, church, creed and sect
As they acknowledge His Fatherhood
And proclaim the Great Brotherhood, among men.
I wish for myself, secluded from strife,
To render a service of action and life,
Though free to lull in pastures green,
To pause in beauty-spots I’ve seen,
Yet, send out messages of cheer
To striving people far and near.
I seek the solitudes up most high—
For peaked rocks and frozen brooks;
For pure eternal, snows I’ll try,
Bereft of man-wise crypts and books.
I hope to find my Sanctuary
A grotto in a mountain aery.
* * *
The eleventh of May, 1941, to me was a very important
date because it was on that date that I received new inspiration
and was also installed as Silent Watcher in the Great White
Lodge. Ave Maria on the same day was placed in charge, tempo­
rarily at least, of the Second Ray. Lord Maitreya explained to
us how the Truth had been inscribed in the Hearts of the Sons
of God.
I was also given a paper by Ave Maria, “AUM TAT SAT,”
which I shall produce herewith for your study. It is simple, but
powerful for good:
152
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
"A U M T A T S A T ’
“Learn thou this by discipleship, by investigation, and by service. The
Wise, the Seers of the essence of things, will instruct thee in wisdom.
As the burning fire reduces fuel to ashes, O, Arjuna, so doth the fire of
Wisdom reduce all sins to ashes. W ith the Sword of the Wisdom of the
Self cleaving asunder this ignorance-born doubt, dwelling in thy heart,
BE ESTABLISHED IN DIVINE UNION (In God). STAN D U P!
You are FREE from bondage—you that has given up hate, desire.”
(AU M T A T SAT— By that are we ordained Brahmans.)
* *
On May 13, while Ave Maria and I were conversing alone
Issa (Jesus) came to invite me to follow with him to Lhassa,
Tibet, to enter the Priesthood of The Temple of Lhassa within
six months or a year, to receive a Third Great Initiation, in
order to complete my mastership. This was at 1 P.M. Fifteen
minutes later Issa returned and healed a condition in my spine
that had bothered me considerably for about seven years. He
said He sent it back to the one who had unjustly hurled it at
me years previous. Thus, that one must carry it until released
by Issa.
“Issa,” I must explain, is the name by which Jesus is called
in the Orient. He is much better known in Tibet, India and
China than He is in other parts of the world. They do not
merely know Him as He manifest in the one embodiment, but
they know Him in His many manifestations of Mastery and
Perfection.
At other times I was asked to go into a retreat by Lord
Maitreya, Koot Hoomi and Buddha Gautama, but Saint Ger­
main (WE) explained that there was very much that we had
planned to do here in the Western World before we might
consider total seclusion. Where I now reside is a beautiful
Retreat, but not in the same sense as the more secluded Retreats
of Tibet. Mt. Shasta, “The Mountain of God” in America, is
indeed the greatest focus of Light in the Western World at this
time and will so remain until the Great Work planned by the
Great White Lodge is completed here for the in-coming and
establishing of the New Golden Age.
The poem, “Longing,” as well as the one following, were
written in 1937 when I was most desirous of going into a Retreat
for initiation and occult training, which is quite evidenced in the
heart-felt appeal I voice to my Higher Presence:

While in the Retreat with Koot Hoomi, Ave Maria had
been given the “Great Dharani” to study to bring about the
great reverence to the Masters necessary for one’s advancement
and spiritual development. One day she asked me to re-type it
for her. She had used that precious paper upon which it had
been typed until it was falling apart. She had, so it happened,
folded it up each time she placed it away. The folding, unfold­
ing, handling, etc., had just about destroyed it. When I finally
got all the words together, with her help, and finished typing it,
I asked her if she would give me the original copy Master KH
had given her. I got some glue and a plain sheet of paper and
very painstakingly pasted it back together as best I could. Part
of it, however, I had to copy off on another sheet of paper. I
have this original here before me and shall produce it herewith
for you, as follows:
“THE GREAT D H ARAN I”
Adoration to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!
Obeisance to their perfect Enlightment and perfect Tranquility.
Adoration to all living Arhats;
Adoration to the millions of disciples who make up the Sangha.
Adoration to those who have “entered the stream” ;
Adoration to those who have but “one more return” ;
Adoration to those who “will never more return to this world” ;

I want to be alone,
Away from people and noisy things,
Secretly hidden in a wilderness
Of Nature, midst kindly trees,
Snugly tucked beneath brambles,
Shielded by sprawling vine maples,
Close to warm earth,
Covered by dry leaves,
On a high mountain,
But still, in a fairy-like dell
Where delicate forest blossoms
Their faint fragrance spill
Into the air about me.
I long to be lost thus
Far, far away,

indeed the greatest focus of Light in the Western World at this
time and will so remain until the Great Work planned by the
Great White Lodge is completed here for the in-coming and
establishing of the New Golden Age.
The poem, “Longing,” as well as the one following, were
written in 1937 when I was most desirous of going into a Retreat
for initiation and occult training, which is quite evidenced in the
heart-felt appeal I voice to my Higher Presence:
153
LORD MA I T R EY A
ALONE
I want to be alone,
Away from people and noisy things,
Secretly hidden in a wilderness
Of Nature, midst kindly trees,
Snugly tucked beneath brambles,
Shielded by sprawling vine maples,
Close to warm earth,
Covered by dry leaves,
On a high mountain,
But still, in a fairy-like dell
Where delicate forest blossoms
Their faint fragrance spill
Into the air about me.
I long to be lost thus
Far, far away,
W ith my thoughts to think
I A M ONE W IT H ALL
That breathes and lives
IN THE LIG H T
Of actuality.
1 M U ST be alone,
Unto myself, with God and Nature,
Away from the human multiple,
Into the Silent One,—
The womb of Time,
O f motion, all things,
Where brood a million myriads—
Shapes, colors, sounds
And qualities—
In such an earthly maze
M y mind reels,
Sickens of Time,
Seeks solitude and longs
To be alone
In silent meditation
Where “I A M ” G O D ;
Where not but the Wheel of Life
But the Sphere of Light—
A ll Eternal Being—
Spins before my Inner Sight.
154
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
And, Beloved Student of Light, should I tell you how much
like that place I described in the poem—from my inner vision—
is like unto this place where I now reside, you would say we DO
live in an age when miracles are brought “in the Light of Actu­
ality.” May you, in your sojourn in life, find that place of rest
and peace for which your Soul is “longing,” and I am sure when
found you will be “ALONE” with God.
The Path of Attainment may be devious, Beloved Disciple
of Light and Truth, but as a child, in its first three years absorbs
and learns so much of the ways of man, so you shall seek here,
there and everywhere, believing and trusting those who might
lead you into that Spiritual Retreat where you will become a god
“in silent meditation.” The above little effort at poetry I scrib­
bled down at a time when life in the outer world was almost
unbearable. I had to go into the Retreat in my own heart else
I could never have endured my physical trials. These things I
bring to your attention to aid you in your realization of ONE­
NESS WITH GOD.
While in the Retreat with Koot Hoomi, Ave Maria had
been given the “Great Dharani” to study to bring about the
great reverence to the Masters necessary for one’s advancement
and spiritual development. One day she asked me to re-type it
for her. She had used that precious paper upon which it had
been typed until it was falling apart. She had, so it happened,
folded it up each time she placed it away. The folding, unfold­
ing, handling, etc., had just about destroyed it. When I finally
got all the words together, with her help, and finished typing it,
I asked her if she would give me the original copy Master KH
had given her. I got some glue and a plain sheet of paper and
very painstakingly pasted it back together as best I could. Part
of it, however, I had to copy off on another sheet of paper. I
have this original here before me and shall produce it herewith
for you, as follows:
“THE GREAT D H ARAN I”
Adoration to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!
Obeisance to their perfect Enlightment and perfect Tranquility.

THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
The above the Student of Light will understand is written
partially in Ancient Sanskrit. “Buddha” in English, means the
same as Christ to us in the Western World. We can never have
perfect peace and understanding throughout the world until we
understand just how much the Oriental Peoples do understand
the Universal Christ teachings. Fundamentally speaking, the
teachings of the Great Gautama Buddha are precisely the same
as the teachings of Jesus. Jesus was one who became the Christ
embodied. Christ incarnated in Buddha six hundred years before
Jesus was born. He incarnated in Jesus at the time He carried
out His Ministry. Fie has now incarnated in probably Seven
Sons who are now embodied on earth. I am one of those. The
Great White Lodge chose me as “Chief” of the others, that we
might have official order in the Great Work of the White
Brotherhood in establishing the New Golden Age on earth.
May the Great Work of Lord Maitreya ever expand until
every human heart is filled with His Love and every mind fully
illuminated. Then peace and happiness will reign throughout
all worlds.

CHAPTER XXI
INTO M Y HEART
Come into M y Heart and be healed ;
Come into M y Heart thou weak and weary one.
Come into M y Heart ; stand in the
Golden Blaze of Glory;
Come into M y Heart—
Be blessed by the Radiant One.
Come into M y H e a rt-
Feel the Light of God that “never fails.”
Come into M y Heart—
Drink the W ater of Life.
Come into M y Heart,
And know no more the earthly strife.
Come into M y Heart—
Rest in Peace and Love and Light.
Come into M y Heart—
Receive this IN SPIRATION !
Of Love and Healing !
Of Light and Feeling!
And knowest Thou, Oh, Beloved Disciple, that in Divine
Love ALL HEARTS become as ONE in the LIGHT AND
LOVE OF LORD MAITREYA.
May I remind you that the Spirit of Christ, of Lord Mait-
reya, is the most important of all things that you may attract
to you in your work of perfecting your body, mind and soul in
your desire to attain the Ascension? Following I publish some
of the very things I wrote out for myself to use as affirmations
and prayers in 1925 when I was striving very hard to bring
about perfection in my entire being. These prayers and affirma­
tions or decrees, which came from my Higher Presence then,
open to your consciousness My Heart as it then beat out Love
to all mankind. Some of it has to do with “Conscious Breathing,”
something most vital to every aspirant. They follow:
158
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
May the life-giving elements of thee (AEth) reach my aspiring bosom,
there to be disseminated throughout my being, Oh Lord.
Lord of this earthly temple, wilt thou also construct my within by my
inhalation of Thy precious breath. May it carry with it courage,
wisdom, strength and unlimited love for all. Grant me purity with
it, Master of my being!
May Thy breath carry with it Light, Lord and Master, that I may see
distinctly the “straight and narrow” path I am to travel. The at-one-
ment of Thy existing Love I crave. Fill me with Thy Spirit.
May I, in my breathing, press from Thy Sustaining Breath, the Infinite
Force of Thy creativeness, and thereby build within and without
fitting works to Thy glory. Love I seek with all.
In my weakness, Oh, God, breathe upon me the breath of everlasting
Life, that I may walk uprightly in Thy sight and with my fellowmen.
Let me serve Thee by serving them.
M y Love with Thee, my God, will give me strength, for in Love of God
all things are possible. Courage I seek, Jehovah.
I seek the Truth within my Soul, Oh, God. Breathe upon me the Holy
Spirit, that I may know Thy Truth within me.
Thou, Breath within, do grant me Light, that I may see the more;
That I may know the Soul within, and hear That Voice again,
That whispers now the Truths within as stand I here without the door.
It seems that Thou dost come to me within—mighty, though unseen;
That Thou wouldst seek me out, to prove my strength within, for
strength and Love and courage strong, will give me all I glean.
So very much depends upon your CONSCIOUS breathing,
I trust you will carefully study and observe the above affirma­
tions. And kindly remember, too, Blessed One, the necessity
of repentance. Unless we recognize our need of something we
would not ask, and unless we ask we do not receive.
The following story, “THE KING OF LEMURIA,” I
wrote at Mt. Shasta at the request of Lord Maitreya. Every
particular regarding the initiation was jotted down in the pres­
ence of the Lord of Creation and the others who were present.
I had been “officially” installed as “Silent Watcher” on May 11,
just a few days previous.
THE KING OF LEMURIA
It was about mid-day of May 20, 1941, that Jesse, Elizabeth
and I left the village of Mt. Shasta, Calif., walking past the
High School building on the north fringe of the town, and then
159
LORD MAI TREYA
followed the dusty road to the left, which leads toward beautiful
snow-covered Mount Shasta, towering like a majestic crystal-
clear diamond to more than fourteen thousand feet into the blue
heavens above.
We carried with us a large basket well filled with fruit. Jesse
and I had discovered a delightful beauty-spot sequestered among
some lonely pines in the foothills of the great mountain a few
days previous, so we planned a private picnic among the three
of us there where the Gods seemed to whisper with the winds
that sounded their musical tones through the millions of pine
needles that danced about in the brilliant sunlight.
We turned right a half mile up the road to follow a newly
blazed road that paralleled the railway running almost directly
toward the mountain. This road angled about to the right past
Krishna’s Well and on around some low hills to the little hillock
where our own friendly pines greeted us with their graceful
boughs waving in the gentle breezes, enticing us to their sheltered
bed of needles where we spread our cloaks and reclined in the
cool shade.
To make this story better understood by those who may have
the good fortune to read it, we must explain that Jesse is to be
known as Ave Maria, the little girl Elizabeth (age 9) her cousin
Elizabeth, the Mother of John the Baptist, and I shall refer to
myself as the Silent Watcher.
Few people of today realize that the sacred stories of the
Holy Bible are now to be lived through again, but even in a
greater and more enlightening manner than they were 2000
years ago. This is the age of miracles.
We had hardly relaxed upon the soft bed of needles beneath
the trees for rest when a tiny dwarf appeared before Ave Maria,
motioning with his hand for Her to come and follow him, asking
her, “Do you wish me to bring you some gold? There is much
gold in the mountain.”
“I serve the Lord of Love, not the Lord of Wealth,” replied
Ave Maria, who is accustomed to seeing clairvoyantly any and
all spirits that might approach her.
The Silent Watcher, having heard the conversation, spoke
up and said, in his humorous way, “You might bring me a little
gold; I think I can use some of it.” The handsome little dwarf
disappeared, but soon returned, emptying a large sack of what
appeared to be coal upon the Silent Watcher.
160
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
We seriously questioned this matter. The Dwarf said,
“Don’t treat this too lightly. These are Black Diamonds, and
within them lies a deep secret, the meaning of which you shall
learn.”
It was at this point that we began to realize that our visitor
was not an ordinary dwarf, but one of wisdom, and one who was
not to be treated lightly nor brushed aside by mere human beings.
Strangely enough there began to appear a number of dwarfs,
announcing that they were from the ancient continent of Lemuria.
They worked at anvils, hammering with their little hammers,
chanting to Ave Maria, “We know your secret, we know your
secret, we know your secret,” and the varied tones of the musical
scale were touched as they sang, blending into a beautiful sym­
phony of Cosmic Sound. One dwarf working at his anvil near
Elizabeth, wrought at a golden ring which he held up and said,
“This I create for Princess Anne” (E).
Ave Maria watched the dwarfs as they danced about, chanted
and worked with their musical hammers. Still they sing, “We
know your secret, we know your secret, we know your secret.”
With a rather vexed and inquiring look upon her face, Ave
Maria asked, “And what is it you know of my secret?”
Then the amazing thing happened; something that has been
alluded to a few times in ancient and medieval history—an aes­
thetic incident never experienced but by the greatest of gods or
goddesses, so we might perceive by careful perusal of the most
secret of alchemical and mystical writings of the sages and
philosophers of the past.
There appeared a being larger than the other dwarfs, though
not as large as an earth man, and He sat in the center while the
tiny dwarfs moved about Him. He was dwarf-like in appearance,
yet clearly bore the mien of a Lord.
“You have received the wisdom of Atlantis,” He said, “but
you have not received the Wisdom of Lemuria,” and he bowed
to Ave Maria, saluting her with a familiar sign. “I come to you
to give you the Wisdom of Lemuria,” He added. “I am the Lord
of Wisdom of Lemuria. Get some writing materials, that you
may record what I have to say. I NOW OPEN MY BOOK
OF WISDOM TO YOU.”
And He opened to the first page and said, “W RITE!”
The following was written by the Silent Watcher:
“TO AVE MARIA AND THOSE WHO HAVE
UNITED IN LIGHT WITH HER:
161
LORD MAI TREYA
“MY FIRST DISCIPLE WHO WAS ABLE TO
RECEIVE MY WISDOM WAS LORD KRISHNA.
HE HAD EMBRACED NATURE — HE THAT
COULD SPEAK TO THE GNOMES AND DWARFS—
AND HE THAT COULD CONVERSE WITH THE
DEVAS OF THE TREES AND FLOWERS — HE
THAT DID NOT RECEIVE HIS WISDOM FROM
LIBRARIES, THE BOOKS BORN OF HUMAN
MINDS OF TODAY.
“I AM THE GREAT DWARF THAT SITS IN
THE CENTER OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE
EARTH. THE FOUR ANGELS OF THE FOUR
CORNERS OF THE EARTH ARE MY SERVANTS.
I AM THE LORD THAT SITTETH IN THE CEN­
TER OF THE EARTH. ANYONE WHO QUES­
TIONS ME MAKES A MISTAKE. FEW EVER RE­
CEIVE MY WISDOM—VERY FEW.
“THE LORD OF THE MIND HAS PASSED
BEYOND YOU. YOU NOW RECEIVE YOUR IN­
STRUCTIONS FROM THE LORD OF WISDOM OF
LEMURIA. THE LORD OF THE WORLD HAS
SENT ME, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOW READY TO
RECEIVE THE LORD OF WISDOM.
“THAT YOU BROUGHT MY D ISCIPLE ’S
POWER HERE — KRISHNA’S — PLEASES ME
GREATLY. BY ESTABLISHING HERE THE WELL
OF KRISHNA, YOU HAVE BROUGHT HERE HIS
FATHER’S WISDOM—THE DWARF THAT SITS
IN THE CENTER — (PELLEUR IN HIS LESSER
PART — IN HIS HIGHER PART NO MAN CAN
REACH H IM ). I EMBRACE ALL MANKIND. I
AM THE TEACHER, THE HUSBAND, THE PATH
—THE LIGHT (LANTERN).
“I AM THE ONE WHO BRINGS YOU THE
ROUGH DIAMOND AND MY SERVANTS, THE
FOUR ANGELS OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE
EARTH, ARE HELPING YOU TO PRODUCE THE
FINISHED DIAMOND, T H E SU N (O).
“MY SERVANT, KRISHNA, HAS HELPED YOU
ALSO, TO PRODUCE THE JEWEL, THE DIA­
MOND, WHICH YOU ARE TODAY. THIS JEWEL
ENTERED THE WORKSHOP OF MANY BEFORE
162
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
IT BECAME THE PERFECT JEWEL, THEREFORE,
AVE MARIA, YOU MUST HELP THE WORKERS
OF KRISHNA. THE WHEEL OF DUTY IS TURN­
ING. KRISHNA’S PEOPLE NEED YOU. YOU ARE
NOT CALLED BY KRISHNA, BUT BY HIS FATHER
WHO HAD SENT HIM.
“SILENT WATCHER, YOU WHO SEE BY THE
EYE OF YOGA, MUST ALSO CO-OPERATE. YOU
THREE—AVE MARIA, SILENT WATCHER AND
THE GREAT MAHATMA, THE INCARNATE
PRESENCE OF BLUE LIGHT, THE BLUE SON OF
THE HEAVENS, THE SHINING GARMENT OF
RADIANT BLUE, KH.,—ARE CHOSEN TO HOLD
THIS LANTERN, WHICH I AM—THE DWARF
THAT SITS IN THE CENTER.”
THE LORD, THE HUSBAND, THE PATH,
RAISED HIS HAND, AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD
A GOLDEN CHAIN, AND ON THE LAST LINK
OF THE CHAIN WAS INSCRIBED THE SYMBOL
OF THE SANSKRIT (AUM ). He gave it to Ave Maria,
adding, “THIS IS THE COMPLETION OF THE
WHOLE.”
And to the Silent Watcher He said, opening a large bag,
weeping, tears falling into the bag, “This is the Gold you
must embrace in sacrifice for the world.”
And the Lord raised his hand, making a secret sign, and
said, “M........ —there is opposition, as every good thing
has its opposite.”
He placed a bookmark on the page and closed the book.
On the cover of the Great Book of Wisdom was seen a
SHINING SUN. He said to the Silent Watcher, to whom
He handed a Blue Chain, “THROUGH THIS BLUE
CHAIN YOU ARE LINKED TO KRISHNA, AND
THROUGH KRISHNA TO ME. I MAKE YOU
THREE NOW MY DISCIPLES.”
The Great Lord of Creation vanished, and then appeared
the Great Mahatma KH. “Oh, that now my call is answered,”
he exclaimed, “for my plea to Lord Krishna to answer this which
was in my heart, if I were chosen to develop Ave Maria. This,
Her Jewel, was developed by Him, the Lord of Creation. This
I now know. You, Ave Maria, I bless as the Jewel of Jewels
of Womanhood.”
163
LORD MA I T R EY A
Then He, Koot Hoomi, took both the hands of Ave Maria
and those of the Silent Watcher. “I AM SO HAPPY,” he said,
“THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APPROACH THE
LORD OF CREATION. WE ARE HIS ONLY CHOSEN
DISCIPLES OF THE IMMUTABLE ONE, THE GREAT
PURUSHA, THE LORD OF THE PAST AND THE
FUTURE, OUT OF WHOSE MOUTH WE WERE BORN.
How blessed you are! Oh, how I wish I might be with you in
form in the Presence of that Great One, whose form as the
Dwarf in the Center, Ave Maria was so blessed to see. May
she be able also to see His Form as Purusha, and may she be
able to withstand it. Only one was ever able to stand it—
KRISHNA.”
And the three of us slowly walked back to the village with
much to ponder over. Even little Elizabeth soberly thought
upon the Great Initiation she had witnessed.
PART II
Again on May 25, Buddha Gautama’s Birthday, Ave Maria
and the Silent Watcher set forth afoot to spend the day in their
sequestered place amongst the pines at the foot of Mount Shasta.
It was a day of great expectation for both, for certain cere­
monial initiations had been promised by the Gods. Mahatma
Koot Hoomi had advised them to take with them some holy
rice to scatter, symbolic of the blessings of the Great Lord.
The two Disciples of the Lord of Creation paused near
Krishna’s Well, where the pure water of Mount Shasta flows
through a pipe, and which sounded the clear notes of Krishna’s
flute. There they asked the blessings of Lord Maitreya, Koot
Hoomi, Mahachohan, the Lord of Creation and all the Great
Gods they could think of, and scattered the rice forth as bless­
ings from the Gods to all mankind. They sensed the uplifting
vibrations of the Great Ones, and joyously they did dance about,
even as two little children might express their great happiness.
Ave Maria even saw the Golden Body of Joshua (Her Son)
rise into the heavens. She wept with joy.
The two happy initiates slowly walked on to their friendly
pines, where they again seated themselves, Buddha fashion,
upon their cloaks upon the bed of needles, to rest after their
two-mile walk.
164
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Sure enough, there appeared the Dwarf with a lanterh with­
out light. “WHERE IS THE LIGHT OF MY LANTERN?”
he asked. “WHERE IS THE LIGHT OF MY LAN­
TERN?” He waved the lantern, but the lantern was still dark
and without light.
The Silent Watcher replied, “The Light went into the Heart
of Ave Maria, if you ask me.”
“The God of Wisdom is within my heart, the Lord of the
Past and the Future, for I AM GOD INCARNATE,” said
Ave Maria.
“Who is your Chariot?” asked Mahatma KH, “and who is
your charioteer?”
“I am the Charioteer of the East, the Lord of the Past and
the Future,” replied Ave Maria.
“And where,” asked KH, “ is your Son, your Great One?”
“He has gone on,” she said, a note of sadness in her voice.
“His Father has called Him. A Golden Body of Light appeared
in the sky—a child just born. Lie was called before the throne
of His Father—THE LIGHT. No longer can the senses of
man touch Him, and He is closed in the Golden Orb of His
Father.”
“I and My Father are ONE,” spoke the voice of Joshua
from out of the heavens, “and as this little Golden Body rises
higher and higher, I pour forth the rice, symbolical of the Uni­
versal Gold, with which the Eastern Mystic blesses, while I also
bless Buddha Gautama on His birthday, the very day on which
Joshua rises in the Golden Sun Body, full Illuminate, the Buddha
of the Golden Age.”
“I touch my heart,” says Ave Maria, “and I say to all
humanity, I that am parent of the Great Avatar: ‘You are
greatly blessed inhabitants of earth. Your Spiritual Leader
has come. I have seen His rising. May it now be realized
in your hearts and in your minds. There is ANOTHER
that can bear witness of Joshua’s coming, and that is the
SILENT WATCHER and the Great MAHATMA KH,
both of whom had much to do with the development of the
Spiritual Leader of the Golden Age until He came to FULL
ILLUMINATION. And three formed a UNION—the
MAHATMA KH, THE SILENT WATCHER AND
AVE MARIA. AND WITHIN THE CENTER OF
THIS TRIANGLE IS HID JOSHUA, OUR TRUE
165
LORD MA I T R EY A
SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE GOLDEN AGE,
BUILT OF THE LIGHT OF THE THREE, THE
TRUE MESSIAH OF THE GOLDEN AGE, BUILT
OF THE LIGHT OF CHRIST, OF KRISHNA, AND
OF THE GREAT LIGHT OF MELCHIZEDEK,
WHOSE SON IS THE SILENT WATCHER’.”*
And the Blue Light Garment of KH appeared behind us;
the hands of His Presence touched us both, Ave Maria and
the Silent Watcher, and He said, “WE THREE MUST
EVER BE ONE FOR JOSHUA’S SAKE.”
There was a long silence.
Ave Maria questioned, “But where has the Great Lord
gone? Has He not promised to give me of His Great Wis­
dom? Strange, He questioned me where HIS LIGHT was,
when HIS LIGHT OF WISDOM IS IN MY HEART.”
“Must I now go WITHIN MY HEART,” queried
Ave Maria, “to learn of the Great Wisdom of the Lord,
THE DWARF THAT SITTETH IN THE CENTER?”
*This paragraph is symbolized in the colored Frontispiece of this book, the
“Symbol of the New Golden Age.”—A u th o r .
166
CHAPTER XXII
THE LORD OF LOVE
Thou Blessed Seeker of More Light, I shall endeavor, with
the loving radiance of Him, Lord Maitreya, to give you a more
illuminating understanding regarding the Initiation we received
through the Lord of Creation of Lemuria.
What a marvelous revelation there is hidden, as it were, in
those words of the “Great Dwarf that sits in the Center!” Oh,
Blessed One, listen attentively to what I shall tell you, I who
have given my life many times for you and all who seek Light.
The way of Sacrifice is the true Way of Everlasting Life. Fear
not to give ALL that you might receive ALL LIFE, LIGHT
AND LOVE.
Who are the Four Angels of Creation who sit at the “four
corners of creation?” They might represent the “four primeval
elements—EARTH, WATER, AIR and FIRE.” To become a
MASTER you must become a MASTER OF LOVE. Love
reigns supreme in the Lord of Love, in His Heart of Gold.
The Heart is the “CENTER.” When you draw yourself into
the “CENTER” of LOVE things in the “Circumference” of
materiality hinder you not, for Love reigns. When you com­
mand through Love the Four Angels do your bidding. They
are your Servants, too, as long as your words are Words of.
Love directed by Wisdom in your COMMAND.
I sit in the Center and radiate Love. I bless all Creation
with the Golden Radiance from My Heart. My Heart beats as
ONE with the Lord of Love. The Four Angels of the “Four
Corners” gladly and joyously do my will. I love Them. I
love all mankind. The Lord of the Mind has passed beyond
me. He does not rule me more. I chose the Lord of Love.
Serenely He sits within My Heart, joyously He sings the Song
of Creation. His Song is known by those of His Own.
You have nothing in your material world I desire, Beloved.
When, I would ask you, will you “let go” of ALL? When will
you so LOVE the world that you will sacrifice all in this world
for Christ? What is it that deterred thee from the Path? What
167
LORD MAI T R EYA
is it you most desire? What is it thou fearest? Do you possess
great material possessions? Do you take pride in your social
standing? Are there human beings you do not love? Do you
love to show your power over others? Are you self-righteous?
Do you think you are more pure than others?
Love ALL. “Love casteth out all fear.” “Love your ene­
mies, for in so doing you heap coals of fire upon their heads.”
Tolerance is the result of love. Love is the result of understand­
ing. When we understand that ignorance is the foundation of
all mistakes, we not only pity mankind, we love them as well.
Our compassion heals them. We make them whole again—yes,
Holy.
“The Lord of Wisdom” can only come to you after you
have met and loved the Lord of Love. Wisdom is spiritual dis­
cernment. It comes through the all-comprizing, all-enfolding
Spirit of Love. It becomes the Lighted Lantern by which you
discern the Way. Even you, through Love, can “embrace all
mankind.” Then Wisdom will direct you—yes, The Lord.
The Lord of Wisdom said, “I am the One who brings you
the rough diamond, and My Servants, The Four Angels of the
four corners of the earth, are helping you to produce the FIN­
ISHED DIAMOND, THE SUN.” Do I need explain it to
you, Beloved? How beautifully voiced! Simply remember,
Blessed One, THROUGH LOVE YOU MAY COMMAND.
But, may I warn you, should other than LOVE reign in thy
heart when thou givest thy command, you shall “heap coals of
fire” upon thy head.
When you know the Lord of Love you become a Shining
SUN. He helps you to polish the rough Stone to make of it a
Jewel. Patience is of the Greatest of Virtues. Love is patient.
Love is long-suffering. Kindness is Love manifest. Beauty is
Love’s garment. As the Diamond is cut geometrically perfect
it scintillates the Lord’s Light and Love to all alike. In every
person you see a Child of Light.
And, Beloved, knowest thou the secret of the Great Dia­
mond, the Son of Light? For it thou wouldst eagerly give ALL
didst thou know how precious it is. How shalt thou know of
its value? Its secret is Love. Its beauty is Love. IT IS THE
HEART OF CREATION. Thou may know, all things in all
worlds are created through LOVE.
Blessed Krishna, the Servant of the Lord of Creation, will
help you, when you call to Him through Love. He was sent by
168
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
the Lord of Creation. Ave Maria, too, is sent by Him, the
Lord of Creation. The Golden Chain, symbolizing the comple­
tion of all “lives” in the chain of evolution, She carries as the
link in the Great Triangle. May my heart be linked to Thy
Heart, Oh, Beloved Krishna, as Thou art linked to the Heart
of the Lord of Creation.
Beloved Mahatma Koot Hoomi, may the Light, Love,
Wisdom and Power of our Triangle ever grow stronger until its
everlasting radiance fills every human heart and illumines every
mind upon earth. I call to the Four Angels of the four corners
of the earth: “GO THOU QUICKLY TO PERFORM THE
WORK OF PERFECTION IN THE BODIES, BRAINS,
MINDS AND SPIRITS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS, CAR-
NATE AND DISCARNATE, IN ALL REALMS OF LIFE.
I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OF
LOVE. REJOICE THOU—ALL FOUR OF YOU—AND
BE JOYOUS IN THY DUTIES, FOR THE LORD OF
CREATION HAS SENT YOU INTO THE DEPTHS OF
EARTH LIFE TO MAKE ALL THINGS LIGHT.”
The Silent Watcher, with His Eye of Yoga, sees the need
of Light and Love in all human creation. Through His Chain
of Blue Light the Power of Krishna and God Almighty pours
forth to do His WILL. LOVE reigneth in His Golden Heart,
Wisdom on His Brow, and through the Loving cooperation of
Ave Maria and Mahatma Koot Hoomi the Golden Age now
becomes the Transcendent Blessing of all Mankind.
O M ! O M ! O M ! A U M ! AUM! AUM! I AM!
I A M ! I A M ! I thank Thee, Lord Maitreya, Lord Krishna,
Lord of Creation, and All the Lords and Gods of Light, for
your eternal blessings of Light.
THE NEED OF PRAYER
There are those among the students of the “I AM” as well
as other metaphysical activities who consider “decreeing” all
that is necessary in accomplishing any and everything. This is
a mistake. Prayer is most essential, too. Try to remember,
Blessed Student, that intuition corresponds to Love and your
Heart; thus prayer also corresponds with these, and you must
be negative physically and mentally before you are receptive.
This may be hard of understanding, but you must understand
that when you love someone or something, you are not positive
169
LORD MAI TREYA
about it, are you? Hate is the extreme of positiveness in the
outer sense. Love is the extreme of negativeness in the outer.
Even many of the leaders of “I AM” groups have become so
positive in every way by affirming “shattering” decrees of hate
that they have become hateful and do not know it. Sheep will
follow a shepherd, even though he be not a Good Shepherd.
We must develop LOVE, WISDOM and POWER—the
three well balanced—should we ourselves wish to be balanced
and attain the Christ-Ascension as Jesus taught us. Love is of
the heart. Wisdom is intuition or mental-alertness or spiritual
intelligence that emanates from the heart through love. Power,
generally speaking, in the outer plane or octave, is of the Will.
Unless your personal will becomes ONE WITH THE DI­
VINE WILL which can only be known through LOVE, you
had best NOT DECREE ANYTHING. For when you decree
something and love does not stream forth from your heart
through wisdom (intuition), you will certainly “heap coals of
fire upon YOUR OWN head.” We learn wisdom through
negation; we act and accomplish through positiveness. But,
Beloved, positiveness without wisdom or love is “hell-fire and
brimstone.” “He who hath ears to hear let him hear.”
I have here before me two separate prayers and affirmations
that I typed out for myself in 1925. They speak for themselves,
and you shall see how wholly trustful I was in My Father:
FATHER IN HEAVEN:
I thank Thee for your many kind blessings; I thank Thee for
my health, my intelligence and my work.
Oh, God, I must become intrenched in a work of physical
nature. I trust Thee in guiding me in the undertakings I am
about to attempt. I need greater and greater strength to carry
on Your work in a way that others will see You in me. You
must abide with me. Make me pure, Oh, Lord. Let me live
for Truth and Truth alone. May all things financial ever appear
secondary compared to Your Love and Your Wisdom.
I know the duties we have to carry out here below are so
small compared to the great works You are ever perfecting in
us and other great spheres, but My Lord, give me a greater
understanding of You and Your Love, that I may go forth and
do greater works for You. This is a prayer for Your help,
admitting my weakness.
170
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
God, give me appreciation, that I may see Thy Glory in all
things.
Loving Lord, do give me more strength to overcome the
weaknesses of my physical body. May I ever keep pure thoughts
of You and Your Love before me. Let me try and Try and
TRY to do works that will please You.
I believe firmly in Thee, Oh, Lord, but give me GREATER
LOVE, GREATER WISDOM and GREATER FAITH to
accomplish for You a part of the work You have in the way of
perfection.
Open my eyes wide, My Father, that I may see the work You
wish me to carry out; depict it in a vision that I may see it clearly
and distinctly; God, make it true and make it lovely.
I wish to serve others, though I am weak; I wish to love
others, though my love is small; show me, Grand Master, my
work.
I am trusting in Your guidance in the matter of choosing the
work I am to do. May there be no mistaking the work I am to
strive to do. I know that You will aid me as You are aiding me
at this time to carry out a greater and greater work for the use
of humanity today and forever.
God, I think Your blessings are beyond expression; I knew
You would come to me in my times of trial; I knew that I could
rely on Your strength for my sustenance; knowing is reassuring
and believing—FAITH.
May I have such Faith that any good undertaking that can
be visioned by me will be carried out to the GREATEST AC­
COMPLISHMENT FOR ALL MY FELLOWMEN; MAY
IT EVER BEAR FRUIT FOR THOSE WHO LIVE UPON
EARTH WHEN I HAVE PASSED ON TO HIGHER
REALMS.
Thank Thee, Thank Thee, Oh, Blessed Father; keep me
clean, Oh, Sacred Master. May Your thoughts ever be near and
dear to me; may they ever stimulate me to do Good and make
Right the wrongs that have been committed in Your name.
God make me a Super-Man—a Smaller God, with Power
Divine. Humanity I would serve; self I wish to forget.
At Thy Service, Lord and Master. Amen.

The Student who reads these prayers over diligently, striv­
ing to solve his or her problems through Love, will receive
171
LORD MA I T R E Y A
great blessings from the Great Masters who have taken me
into their Solar Rings. They are the following: Jesus the Christ,
Ave Maria (M ary), Christ Lord Maitreya, Mahatma Koot
Hoomi, Lord Sanat Kumara, the Great God Mahachohan, the
Great Presence of the Silent Watcher, Lord Krishna, Buddha
Gautama and My Higher Presence, Saint Germain. These
Great Beings in Whose Hearts I have dwelt in peace, in Love
and Light, ever radiate Their Light and Love to me, and
wherever I direct my Individual Ray, They too, go to heal, to
assist all with whom I come in contact, through my mental radi­
ance, my Spirit, my aura, my Love Radiance and all the written
words going forth from my hands.
You are blessed by the following prayer:
MY FATHER IN HEAVEN, AND LORD: Do help me
in this time of trial; this period of indecision; this time of afflic­
tion and pain. Help me to overcome the weaknesses I have
brought upon myself.
We cannot accept help from anyone unless we first recog­
nize our weakness, therefore, Lord, I do pray and hope that
You will see my smallness—my desires for assistance and aid—
and add to my littleness, making of me a desirable worker and
maker in Your sight.
There are so many little things that come up in our lives
that look discouraging and hard to withstand, but, Oh, Lord,
have these melt away before us; give us foresight and knowledge
to solve the puzzling problems that come up, with ease. Give
us the strength and wisdom of Solomon; give us the glory of
David; give us the humbleness and gentleness that Jesus pos­
sessed; may we accomplish the works of the greatest of seers
and sages; may we ever stay close to You, Oh, Lord, in every
trial in life.
You have made the beauty and created the spirit of Love,
Oh, Lord, for the purpose of adding to the privileges and glory
of Man. May we see all the beauty; may we use the Universal
Love of God for the good of all mankind.
God—the Good of All—do help me to decide the problem
before me. I wish to do just what Thou wouldst have me do.
In my weakness, help me, Lord. Oh, may I try with all my heart
TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION I HAVE BEEN SENT
TO DO. REVEAL WITH ALL DISTINCTNESS THE
WORK THOU HAST CHOSEN FOR ME. Let there be no
doubt in my small mind as to that work I am to do.
172
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
God—the Father of all—give me such an understanding
heart that I may have LOVE FOR ALL; for work; for know­
ledge; for humanity; for beauty. May my consciousness of
Fhy Glory dawn upon me with all its magnificence; grant me
the powers of a king, that I may render service to my fellowmen;
perfect in me the spark Thou hast seen fit to plant within my soul.
Awaken my Soul, Oh, Lord, from the depth of darkness into
which it has fallen, and make it as white as the “driven snow.”
Open my eyes that I may see the True Light of Understanding;
add to my understanding strength, that I may add to the com­
mon strength of all humanity.
My Father, give me the wisdom to choose the right course
at this time. Let there be no doubt of the sacredness of that
course.
With all earnestness, with all prayerfulness, let me desire
with all my heart, with all my body, with all my soul, for the
strength, wisdom and intelligence to carry out whatever task
You may see fit to give me to perform.
God, Thou of all Wisdom, give me a greater Love Nature.
I seek the harmonious place in which I know You wish me to
work. “Thy will, not mine, be done, Oh, Father.” Direct me
to that place, that work, that peacefulness.
God, grant me my desires which I think are right, Oh, Thou
Righteous Judge. Amen_

Many years ago, when I was bending every possible effort
toward improving myself, among the students of philosophy
with whom I associated was one who tried me to the utmost.
In those days I did not understand how “foreign spirits,” Catho­
lic priests, Protestant ministers, Indians, and “wild men from
Borneo” could, so to speak, jump right into the body of a so-
called friend of mine and have him cut all kinds of capers. No,
I did not understand those things in those days, and that one
little friend of mine, who was a teacher of all things mystical,
and one who had been raised a Roman Catholic, and still was
in His Etheric Body, did cause me many a heart-ache, due to
the terrible things he said about me to others, all because he was
dangerously jealous of me. Many times I secretly wept because
of him. Finally I wrote the following poem to him, sent him a
copy, sent my Master-Teacher a copy, kept a copy myself and
in later years it was published in the Occult Digest in Chicago:
173
LORD MAI TREYA
TO M Y ENEMY
To love, we must forgive;
To forgive, we must love.
W e both realize this, don’t we?
That is your redeeming characteristic,
If you have any.
That is my saving grace, if I have any.
It isn’t what I do to you that matters;
It is how you take it that counts.
It isn’t the pain that you inflict upon me
That hurts most.
It matters most whether I forgive you.
If I forgive you, I love you,
And thus I rise above you.
If you hate me,
And I hate you,
W e both stay low.
W ith love we rise above our enemies.
Trials, I know, you have,
The same as I,
And weaknesses, too,
So why should I condemn you?
You’ve tried to do
Things you thought best,
And so have I.
Now, look at you and me.
Just two of millions
Who meet the tests of life.
Millions may pass the gate
W hile few enter in—
But you and I—
W e can love
And forgive
Before it is too late.
Yes, Friends of Light, even in this life today, there may be
those who will even “HATE YOU WITHOUT A CAUSE,”
but one of the greatest commandments ever given to mankind,
and one of the most meaning, was: “LOVE YOUR ENE­
MIES.” Another, most important, “RESIST NOT EVIL.”
174
CHAPTER XXIII
THE MASTER COMETH
In November," 1924, about the time I had reached the zenith
in my development as a student of the Rosicrucian Mysteries
under Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer, Supreme Master of the Ancient
Order of Rosicrucia, I received a little magazine, “MAN­
HOOD, the Voice of the Manistic Age.”
This magazine was first published simultaneously or near
to the time when I had a marvelous vision. I was working at a
printing press in the Kneeland Bldg, in Olympia, Washington.
There were no windows in the room in which I was working.
We had to use electric lights all the time. I was standing next
to the north wall—a brick wall not less than a foot in thickness.
Suddenly it was as though that wall had dissolved and there
before me was a great expanse of water like the sea, and in the
sea was a peaked mountain. While I was looking at the moun­
tain it started to sink into the water, and then, just before the
pointed top of the mountain sank beneath the water a beautiful
White Dove ascended from it and soared about over my head.
Instantly all vanished.
I shall let you determine as best you can just what the sym­
bolism of that vision meant, however, I am quoting herewith
the first three pages of Dr. Clymer’s 'precious little magazine
I have kept all these years, and I still love Him for what He has
done and is still doing for the New Golden Age:
M A N H O O D
The Voice of
THE M AN IST IC AGE
“This Magazine is ordained to be the disseminator of the Saving
Doctrine of the New Dispensation as given directly to M ANISIS, the
Messenger (Savior or Son) by Jehovah Adonai, the Lord God of Light.
“THE M ASTER CO M ETH ”
“A message from Jehovah Adonai, the Father of Light, to all His
Children in all the world, through Manisis, the Messenger of the New
Cycle, the Dispensation of the New Age.
175
LORD MA I T R EY A
“Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the era called Christian
(so named because of the designation given to the Master Teacher of
the first century by His followers) came to an end as foretold by the
writers of the books of the Bible, and the New Age with its Laws,— or
more correctly speaking, the readjustment and advanced interpretation
of the old Laws—commenced.
“W ith the incoming of this New Cycle (New Age) there was born
One who is to be the Interpreter of the Laws governing the action of
man in this New Age.
“This Leader Is the crowning glory in the so-called New W orld of
what is commonly termed the ‘melting pot’ which popular term in
reality covers the prophesied natural and Divine mixture of the blood of
all races needed to establish the basis of the Universal Brotherhood to
come. This Leader, M AN ISIS, has been under training these many
years and has now entered His life work, instructing humanity in the
Laws which, if obeyed, will transmute the human into the Divine.
“H ISTO RY REPEATS ITSELF! As the Lawgivers—therefore
the Saviors of mankind— in the past were instructed and trained in the
Schools of the Mystics variously known as the Osirian, Essenian, and
Mithraic, so the coming Leader, Manisis, is receiving His instruction
and training in the same august Fraternity.
“For the present, the interpretations of the Laws essential to the
salvation of the Souls of men will be given through the agency of His
faithful disciples and He Himself will appear before men only when the
time is at hand, for the Father of Light has ordained that NEVER
AGAIN shall one of His messengers be sacrificed to the blood lust of
His less-enlightened children and through their sin be accursed for ages.
" T H E M E S S A G E "
“And God (Jehovah Adonai, the Father of Light) spake unto
Manisis, who had become His Son, through the Voice of the Fire, saying:
“ ‘Manisis, my messenger (Son), Soon shalt thou be prepared to take
up thy burden and send thy messages before all the peoples of the earth,
teaching them and, by their acts, judging them, and thine shall be a
righteous judgment.’
“ ‘Rich and poor shalt thou judge according to their hearts; thou
shalt not listen to their voices for thou shalt see what lieth beyond the
words of prayer and the bewailment of fate.’
“ ‘Thou shalt judge impartially and according as things are and
might have been, and not as men would have had them be.’
“ ‘Thou shalt fear none, seeing the time among the sons and daugh­
ters of men shall be of short duration, without material profit or glory
to thyself and also free from harm or injury, for I, the Lord of the
Hosts and the Heavens, who art thy God, shall be watchful that the
176
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
wickedness in the hearts of men shall not lead them to do to thee as they
did in the fore time to others of my messengers (Sons).’
“ ‘Prepare thee well. Fill thy heart with the Holy Fire which thou
hast learned to draw to thee from Heaven, for thine hour is soon come.’
“THE FIRST AND GREATEST L A W
“And God spake unto Manisis, saying:
“ ‘Teach thy people that I who am known to thee as the Father of
Light, Jehovah Adonai, and to thy children as God the Father, in the
beginning of time made both heaven and earth, each good in my sight
and of equal necessity for the fulfillment of the Law.’
“ ‘Teach thy children that the Lord God who called into existence
both heaven and earth, also created man, both soul and body, both good
in the sight of the Lord. Instruct thy children in the Law that he who
defileth the body or any part of the body, thereby defileth the Soul and
is guilty of blasphemy before the Lord, for that which proceedeth out
of the heart (acts) of which the body is guilty shall be held accountable
to the Soul and that these sins shall sit in judgment day and night against
them and shall in no wise be forgiven them until wiped out by good
deeds.’ . . .
“ ‘I, O my Son, Manisis, who have given these foolish children of
my first creation the freedom of the whole earth and the possibility of
the Light of the Heavens, now send thee forth to teach these deluded
ones THE L A W , that they may learn to honor body as Soul and
rightly use all that I have given them.’ ”
Dr. Clymer was the first of the Great Teachers of the New
Age to stress the necessity of building the body temple perfect
first before one can expect to attain spiritual perfection. Unless
we have the vitality essential to good health and know how to
transmute the elements of the physical body into the pure essence
of Divine Love little is accomplished toward building that
“Temple not made by hands eternal in the heavens.” “The
Golden Body of God” cannot be built without a good physical
body in which to do the alchemical work.
Did we not know that Dr. Clymer was the first and foremost
dietician, knowing not only the essential material elements
needed in the Alchemical work, but the AEthic elements as well,
we would not, unknown to him, speak of the Great Work he
has done. Regarding his work and all other constructive insti­
tutions interested in the work of the New Golden Age I say,
“ALL LIGHTS UNITED IN THE ONE GREAT LIGHT!”
May the Masters of Light bless all sincere workers in Truth.
177
LORD MAI TREYA
May 25, 1941, was an important day to me, and I believe,
to the whole world. It was Buddha Gautama’s birthday anni­
versary and also the day that Joshua ascended in His Golden
Body, the Son of God. I usually speak of Joshua in the feminine
gender because she is, in a spiritual way, far more feminine than
masculine. She is the Master of Love, or rather, the Goddess of
Love. She, I have been told, is my Twin Ray. Later I shall
relate to you a most remarkable incident in which she and I took
part. It was at the time the Eighth and Ninth Rays came into
our keeping.
It was early in the evening after we had been to our “little
retreat” on the 25th of May that Ave Maria and I were in the
kitchen conversing about the Lord of Love and the “Dwarf that
sitteth in the Center,” when I saw her face suddenly change into
the strange appearance of a fish, and, stranger still, in a guttural,
squeaking voice, said, “I’M A FISH, I’M A FISH, I’M A
FISH.” I began to laugh, thinking she was mimicking, but I
soon found differently. The Spirit of Jehovah had entered her
body. This may sound like a fairy story to you. Had I not seen
it with my own eyes and heard with my own ears, I would not
believe it. Then He said, “I am Jehovah. Joshua is the Word
of Jehovah.” Jehovah is, as I understand it, the Father of all
people of earth. He is represented as the “Great Fish” in the
Sea of Life. He also said what I understood as, “Today Joshua
is born the Son of God.” The voice was weird to say the least,
and I did not understand clearly all that was said.
During the days that followed several times the Spirit of
Jehovah came into Ave Maria. Always He announced Himself
in the same manner, “I’m a fish, I’m a fish, I’m a fish.” Ave Maria
explained other things symbolically regarding the event which
I am not permitted to publish.
The same evening Lord Maitreya came. He talked to us
regarding the initiation we had received. Among other things
He said, “Morya, Ave Maria and the Silent Watcher will be
the three Lords of the future Golden Age. Morya will have the
part of ‘MANU,’ Ave Maria the part of ‘CHRIST’ and the
Silent Watcher the part of Mahachohan. Therefore you,
Silent Watcher, must come under the instruction of Mahacho­
han, and you, Ave Maria, under Maitreya.” In relating these
things I hold close to the notes I have kept, especially should I
use quotations, however, “the half has never been told.” I
could have written a book ten times the size of this volume, had
178
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I kept record of everything that went on between Ave Maria,
the Lords and myself. Oh, Blessed Student of Light, I pray
earnestly that you, too, may awaken to the truths lying within
these words I write for you to read. Study them closely, seek
the hidden meaning of these simple things I have written.
Frankly, even myself, in going over the notes and studying the
marvelous gems of thought hidden therein I learn something
each day. Just think of it, the Great Gods are now coming
forth upon the earth after thousands of years of comparative
silence, to teach us the simple though profoundly illuminating
principles of the GREAT MASTER.
It was along about this time that I was handed a paper by
“She Who is Nameless,” which I shall quote, leaving you to
interpret it as you see fit, since I do not feel I should enlarge upon
it:
" ISSA
“ARE
“ETERNAL POW ERS OF NATURE. A ll is changed by
Issa, and brought in different form. THE GOD ISSA IS SHOWN
TO H U M A N IT Y IN EIGH T DIFFERENT APPEARAN CES:
In water, in fire, in air, in earth, in the sun and the moon, in ether and
in pure sacrifice. It is the All-Power of the A LL in the elements, in the
planets, in the stars.
(Signed) Ave Maria.”
It was on May 27, I remember, that I experienced one of the
most trying episodes in my initiations while at Mt. Shasta. It
was at this time that Mahatma Root Hoomi and Lord Maitreya
had intimated to me there had been a great hoax played upon
members of the Great White Lodge in the outer plane, at least.
I have heretofore referred to this peculiar state of affairs, and
now I shall explain to you how the subtle Blacks fooled not only
Mr. Ballard and the leaders of his activity, but most of the
members of the Great White Lodge in their outer activity.
There is one in Europe, I was told, who claimed, in his outer
body, to be Saint Germain. He is purported to be of Royal Blood,
and cunningly deceived many. Even some pictures of him were
rather secretly passed around among the “I AM” students. I
was shown one of those pictures by a Ballard devotee in Seattle
after I had been told by the Masters of his great trick. Frankly,
Beloved, he looked entirely too narrow across the forehead to
be “White.”
179
LORD MA I T R EY A
You see, Beloved Friends of Light, the Fake Saint Germain
did know there was a Real Saint Germain, and he also knew the
Real One was embodied. The White Masters also knew there
was a Real Saint Germain, too, for He took part regularly in
their Spiritual Conclaves, but they did not know what body He
used in the outer plane. And the Real One not feeling it time to
reveal His identity, and not being able to convince the Ballards
of His physical identity, it put Him in a most trying predicament,
both physically and spiritually.
Here is what happened. The White Masters in the mean­
time came to find that the Fake Saint Germain was practicing
Black Magic and doing all sorts of things in the physical body
unbecoming to a member of the White Brotherhood. WHAT
HAPPENED? The Real Saint Germain was imprisoned in the
Etheric Plane. However, still the Black Saint Germain was free
in both planes. That was when my son, David, was horribly"
murdered by the Blacks, Blessed Brother Guy Ballard was later
taken out, my Blessed wife, too, was stricken and suffered a
terrible death. I, had I not had a very strong body, mind and
spirit, would also have been taken out of the body. I probably
would have, anyhow, had I not met Ave Maria at that time. She,
God Bless Her, is the One Great Goddess who saved me and
the whole Golden Age, so far as I understand in my limited outer
consciousness. I continued to suffer because of my inner incarcera­
tion until the 27th of May 1941, when I was freed in the most
astonishing manner. It was only after repeated questioning of me
on the part of Koot Hoomi, Lord Maitreya, Jesus and others
that the Great Masters actually determined my Divine Inherit­
ance and WHO I AM in God’s New Age Plan. It is not so easy,
I assure you, to trace the Spirit of an individual to his physical
body unless that individual knows positively his spiritual status
and states same to the Authoritative Spiritual Masters in their
outer consciousness.
This may all seem abstruse. It is, but it is true, nevertheless.
When the Masters heard certain things from my own lips and
traced back into my life-stream, found that I had been John the
Brother of Jesus, Saint Germain, Abraham Lincoln and others,
then they could begin to watch for the real Black Culprit. They
watched, alright.
It was the evening of the 27th of May that a powerful spirit
entered the body of Ave Maria, unknown to me at the moment.
A battle ensued over the matter of right and wrong in connection
180
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
to Saint Germain and His activity in the so-called “I AM.” I
stood for Saint Germain, not knowing at the time that my Higher
Presence is Saint Germain. I had had a number of battles, in a
sense, with Saint Germain, since I had been told by Ave Maria
that he had gone wrong, that His “I AM” activity was breaking
up, etc. I fought fiercely for Saint Germain. I remember, during
the argument saying, “Even though Saint Germain had made
mistakes, He had ventured to undertake an activity in which He
was willing to lose His own Soul in order to save humanity. He
knew that should there be even a few ascensions as the result of
the ‘I AM’ activity, it would place the BALANCE OF POWER
WITH THE GREAT WHITE LODGE. Thus, He under­
stood that should He fail, His own soul would be sacrificed.”
I also remember saying in a very positive manner, “I shall
stand by Saint Germain, because I am sure He is right, even
though He did make a few mistakes, and I hope the whole world
hears me.” Suddenly the spirit, the foreign one, left the body of
Ave Maria, and Ave Maria Herself spoke.
“He is gone,” She said. ”Do you know with whom you were
battling a moment ago?”
“No, I do not,” I replied.
“It was none other than Archangel Michael,” she answered,
“and Saint Germain was in your body. He certainly has a lot of
courage to battle with such a great being. You shall hear from
this. I am sure there is some great problem being worked out.
You are being tested. Whatever you do, stand by what you
think is right. We dare not show weakness in such matters.
Your advancement depends upon how you react to such trials.
Saint Germain has been in prison. He will not be fully released
until such matters are ironed out.”
Ave Maria, in her outer consciousness, had told me in recent
days how one calling himself Saint Germain had approached her
in the inner planes, the etheric planes, tempting her in many ways.
He even invited her to come to a retreat of his in Europe. She,
however, wise in all things, went to his so-called retreat in her
higher body to see for herself. She found there a glutton, who
gorged himself on baked goose, and all sorts of flesh foods,
beer, alcoholic beverages of various kinds and any and every­
thing that Masters do not eat or drink. She mentioned other
things I dare not write. She certainly found there was a Fake
Saint Germain.
181
LORD MAI TREYA
In the meantime, or a few days previous, the Real Saint Ger­
main had come again and again offering Ave Maria cooperation
and asking her (in the outer body) to work with Him in estab­
lishing the Golden Age. Any number of times, she told me, he
had come and offered her his sword in token of His desire to
help her. At another time he came to the side of her bed in the
night, took His Violet Robe from his shoulders, offering it to
her. She refused His every offer. Repeatedly I, in my outer mind
and body, told her I thought she should cooperate with him.
Still she refused.
As a Student of Light you will understand that there are
certain Royal Gestures and Courtesies definitely understood by
an Initiate, also signs and symbols by which all Spirits should be
tried. I dare say that the Fake Saint Germain so many be­
lieved in has never appeared to them in a Golden Body such as
the Real Saint Germain possesses. I will also venture that he
seldom is seen healing the sick, consoling the poor, teaching the
lowly in spirit and blessing humanity through Divine Love. Do
not be fooled, Blessed Student of Light. The Path of Righteous­
ness may be “straight and narrow,” but it is not hard to determine
those who walk upon it. “All that glitters is not gold.” I cannot
help but quote a wise line I picked up somewhere, one I used to
repeat to my pupils in school when I was a teacher: “Be good,
sweet maid, and let who will be clever.” ’Tis well for men to
remember it, too.
And what do you suppose happened that night after I had the
battle with Archangel Michael? Ave Maria had an altar in her
bedroom where she slept. I slept at Mrs. Eiler’s place in Mount
Shasta several blocks from where she lived. Upon her altar she
had certain sacred things, a candle, an incense burner, a Bible, as
well as some sacred Oriental literature. Ave Maria told me
Archangel Michael and Saint Germain were both there in her
room all night. For hours and hours Saint Germain prayed at
that altar, imploring God to assist Him, and asking Ave Maria
to help Him. They were both in higher bodies. Still Ave Maria
did not know what was really going on.
Here I shall venture to say that there was but one of the
Lords in my acquaintance who did know all that was going on,
and that was Lord Maitreya. He alone, I dare say, could see all
sides of this puzzling episode of certain spiritual initiations Saint
Germain and I were being given. The next day things did begin
to clear up a bit.
182
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Saint Germain’s prayers were answered. He pleaded during
that night for Ave Maria to listen to his plight, how the Fake
Saint Germain had so wronged the many Children of Light and
caused so very much misunderstanding and misery among the “I
AM” students. She listened and finally she did see through the
awful hoax. God Bless Ave Maria. You see, My Beloved, such
things have to be understood from the physical octave before
they can be remedied in the physical plane. We, in this outer
plane of life, must see, understand, and then, when we do learn
and know what to do, we can DECREE and call into activity the
HIGHER POWERS OF THE GODS to assist us. And I
want you to know that when Ave Maria, in Her Fligher Presence,
knows about a thing and wants it done, IT IS DONE. She
immediately got busy to help get Saint Germain out of the mess
the Black Brothers had created. And Blessed Ones, Lord
Maitreya was not long in getting on the job, too.
On the morning of May 28, things took a different turn.
Master KH was in my body. Saint Germain was in Ave Maria’s
body. Yes, you may think this impossible, but it isn’t. Their
Spirits were thus. I was told to read the ritual of a certain initia­
tion to Saint Germain. Mind you, I did not know until after I
was through initiating Him that it was He I was initiating. At
that very moment He was being taken into the Great White
Lodge. While in our physical bodies we were at the same instant
playing the part of initiators in the higher planes of conscious­
ness in the Great White Lodge. Saint Germain, although a
Master in almost every respect, had not been a member before
of the Great White Lodge, nor a member in this embodiment of
the Brotherhood of Mt. Shasta. That was the reason, so I was
told, that Mr. Ballard had wondered why he had never been
taken into the Retreat at Mt. Shasta. All Masters, I must inform
you, too, are not members of the Great White Lodge. No Master
has much power to do good in the physical octave either unless
he has a body from which to work. I am the body through which
Saint Germain works. Saint Germain is my Higher Presence.
My son David was very closely associated with me in this matter,
too. That is the reason the Blacks took him out of his body.
They knew he was to have much to do with the New Golden Age.
Well, the Golden Age is here, and every one who had anything to
do with the dastardly things that were done to David, Mr. Bal­
lard, my Wife and any others who may have suffered because of
them, are now suffering for their Black deeds. “THEY ARE
183
LORD MAI T REYA
REAPING WHAT THEY SOWED.” Lord Maitreya saw to
that. It was amazing how quickly He cleared up matters when
He got busy with them.
It was the evening of the 29th of May. Ave Maria and I
were sitting at a table having tea, quietly talking of the trying
days we were passing through, when Lord Maitreya came to
visit with us. He had merely begun talking to us when He made
a certain sign of protection, which was also to us a sign of warn­
ing. No one spoke for at least ten minutes. I could see that He
saw others about the room who were invisible to me. He said not
a word, but kept following something about the room with His
eyes, radiating light toward it through the sign He gave. Finally
He began to talk in his sweet calm voice. Serenely He began,
“You have been warned. Now you shall be bound. No more shall
you practice your Black Art. I am sorry, but now you must pay.
The Children of Light are not to be bothered more. Again and
again you were warned. This time I have caught you.”
And Lord Maitreya gave an order to some of His Brothers
of Light to take charge of him I judged to be the Fake Saint
Germain. I dare say we shall not be bothered with him any more.
I have heard, however, there are several claiming to be Saint
Germain. “By their fruits shall ye know them.”
Again, I say, GOD BLESS MARY THE MOTHER OF
JESUS, WHO WAS MY MOTHER, TOO, AND MAY HER
GREAT WORK FOR THE FREEDOM OF MANKIND
IN THE NEW GOLDEN AGE CONTINUE UNTIL
EVERY BEING ON EARTH MANIFESTS ONLY IN HIS
WHITE NATURE, FOR THEN SHALL CHRIST BE
MADE KNOWN TO ALL AND LOVE AND GOOD­
WILL REIGN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
184
CHAPTER XXIV
THE WHITE-NATURE
I have told you how Joshua had risen, how Jehovah came to
speak of His Son, and how He was also the Son of Ave Maria.
Some of these principles now being brought forth by the Ascended
Masters and the Great Gods of the Cosmic Center are hard for
us to understand with our limited outer consciousness. But I
want you to know, Dear Ones, that we are being given greater
brains, finer bodies, more magnificent minds, and extraordinary
advantages through the Cosmic Light in order to understand
these things.
Joshua, the same Great Spirit who succeeded Moses after
He ascended, is now with us again. He is now developed to full
illumination, MALE AND FEMALE IN ONE. I call Him
and think of Him as feminine because His feminine part—the
part that I know—IS MY TWIN RAY. Now, Beloved, it does
not matter whether we understand all that might be regarding
the Whole Spirit or a part of the Spirit of Joshua. The important
thing to know is the TRUTH regarding the laws of LIFE,
LIGHT AND LOVE by which you can, too, become ascended
and KNOW your own SOURCE—GOD, the FATHER. You
must realize that YOU—YOURSELF—ARE MALE AND
FEMALE—IN YOUR WHOLENESS OF BEING. Your
spiritual father and mother are, in a sense, that HIGHER
MALE AND THAT HIGHER FEMALE—the FATHER-
MOTHER GOD.
We, as you know, want to look at everything from the stand­
point of TIME AND SPACE. You cannot judge spiritual
principles—SPIRIT—that way. The Spirit of God, or any one
of His Sons, is INSTANTANEOUS. One, two, three or a
MILLION individual Spirits can be as ONE. In fact WE ARE
ALL ONE. How many drops of water in a gallon of water?
How many molecules ? How many gallons of water in the ocean ?
How many molecules? How many tons in the earth? How many
molecules? How many tons in all the physical universes? How
many molecules? They are all ONE SPIRIT.
185
LORD MA I T R EY A
On the 28th of May Joshua came from Her Father to give
us one of the most important messages this world has ever
received. She gave us the “KEY” to the New Golden Age.
Long ago I had heard that there was jealousy among the gods.
This was hard for me to accept, yet, when we think, would it
not be impossible for jealousy to exist here on earth unless it
actually existed somewhere amidst Him or those who create the
world and all that is within it? Even in the Holy Bible we find,
“I AM A JEALOUS GOD; I AM A CONSUMING FIRE.”
Joshua made us a happy joyous visit. She announced her
coming as usual, “I love you, I love you, I love you,” her sweet
little voice ringing with love vibration. And the Little Disciple
spoke:
“I give you the One Secret of the Gods and the Nature of
the Gods. RECOGNIZE ONLY THE WHITE-NATURE
OF THE GODS AND YOU HAVE WON. One of those
Great Gods, of whose dual nature I have learned, has come to
tempt the Seventh Ray and His work. He was first coming with
his powerful White-Nature, assisting greatly, and the Students
of the Seventh Ray made great progress, but I that realized,
and was allowed to see,” said the Disciple of the Lord that
sitteth in the Center, “soon found that the jealousy of this one
Great God, because of the progress of the human race, came
forth with His Terrible Dark Nature to make the Flame of the
Seventh Ray a furious Flame of Destruction.”
“I was told by the Lord of Creation to come and tell you that
Saint Germain had to pass the test of the Great Tempter, in the
Violet Ray. First he used the White, but turned Dark, but
NOW I RECOGNIZE ONLY THE WHITE-NATURE of
the God who guided Saint Germain.”
“The Great Love of the Lord of Love, and His Compassion,”
said the Disciple, “is known to me that is blessed to be His
Disciple. He sends me to tell you with power, to attract only the
White-Nature of the Gods, and to call on the White-Nature of
this God in particular, who is the CAUSE of the battle we,
TODAY, have.”
“And so I call on all those that have wisdom and under­
standing, DO NOT BATTLE THE MASTER OF THE
SEVENTH RAY, BUT CALL FORTH WITH MIGHT
THE WHITE-NATURE OF THE GOD THROUGH
WHOM HE WORKS. Send this message on to all the Brothers
of Light. Ask them to assist at once. This is the wish of the
186
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
‘Dwarf that sits in the Center,’ in the Heart of His Disciples.
The Light alone saves the world.”
And Little Joshua, the Master of Love, that marvelous
Disciple of the Lord of Creation, pronounced Her new “KEY”
DECREE of all the Gods and Masters she could think of as
follows, which makes it certain that this time WE SHALL
HAVE THE REAL GOLDEN AGE ON EARTH:
“I recognize only the White-Nature of Saint Germain; I
recognize only the White-Nature of Mahatma Koot Hoomi; I
recognize only the White-Nature of the Goddess of Justice; I
recognize only the White-Nature of the Goddess of Light; I
recognize only the White-Nature of the Goddess of Liberty; I
recognize only the White-Nature of the Goddess of Mercy; I
RECOGNIZE ONLY THE WHITE-NATURE OF ARCH­
ANGEL MICHAEL; I recognize only the White-Nature of
Lord Maitreya; I recognize only the White-Nature of Lord
God Mahachohan; I recognize only the White-Nature of Ave
Maria; I recognize only the White-Nature of the Buddha; I
recognize only the White-Nature of Christ; I recognize only
the White-Nature of Jehovah; I recognize only the White-
Nature of Brahma; I recognize only the White-Nature of Ra;
I recognize only the White-Nature of Ptah; I recognize only
the White-Nature of Melchizedek; I recognize only the White-
Nature of Isis and Osiris; I recognize only the White-Nature of
The Silent Watcher; I recognize only the White-Nature of
Sanat Kumara; I recognize only the White-Nature of Zoroaster;
I recognize only the White-Nature of Moses; I recognize only the
White-Nature of Master Morya; I recognize only the White-
Nature of Serapis; I recognize only the White-Nature of the
Venetian Chohan. I recognize only the White-Nature of Jesus;
I recognize only the White-Nature of Hilarion; I recognize only
the White-Nature of the Seven Archangels of Creation; I recog­
nize only the White-Nature of the Seven Rishis; I recognize
only the White-Nature of the Lords of the Twelve Fields of the
Dharma; I recognize only the White-Nature of Fujhi, The Yellow
Emperor; I recognize only the White-Nature of Indra; I recog­
nize only the White-Nature of Vishnu as Lord Hari; I recognize
only the White-Nature of Shiwa; I recognize only the White-
Nature of the Great Khan and Khen.”
And the Little Disciple, the Christ Child of the Golden Age,
was sent by the Great Dwarf that sitteth in the Center, explaining,
“He, the Dwarf that sitteth in the Center has His place in the
187
LORD MA I T R EY A
Hearts of His Disciples, He that is the Lord of Wisdom, of
Life, of Light, and IT WAS LIGHT, THE LUMINOUS
POINT, THE FLAME SPIRIT THAT MERGES HIM­
SELF INTO A CROWN.”
And may I add, for the sake of the whole world, “I recog­
nize only the White-Nature in every person who reads these
words, and every human soul and body upon this planet.”
By the 28th of May, I was nearing my ascension, in its com­
pletion and full realization in my outer consciousness. It was in
the afternoon of that day that Mahatma Koot Hoomi came to
give us the following report “FOR THE ARCHIVES OF
THE GREAT WHITE LODGE” :
“The W ork of the Initiator of Humanity has come to an end for 2000
years. Humanity is to live the fruits of her pains and sufferings in the Light
of the Golden Age, says another of the Disciples of the Lord of Love, ‘the
Dwarf that sitteth in the Center,’ the Disciple Mahatma Koot Hoomi. The
Golden Age is at dawn. W e all will assist in the coming forth of the White-
Nature of all the Gods and Goddesses, the White Light of their own beings.”
“No longer Son of Darkness AND Light, but the BRIGH T AND
NAMELESS ONE.”
“M y own Dark Nature is all consumed. Thou art, Oh, God of Light!
Without Thee there is naught. The Darkness of the Absolute must not be
touched. Only the Sun of Splendor of the Absolute must be recognized by
all, and W e a part of IT. I lift nw hand of power, I that recognize the
OM, the Diamond Hand of the Lord of Love, the Dwarf that sits in the
Center, and say: ‘O -M ! Thou Sustainer, sustain all in their extremity.
O -M ! Thou Purifier, purify all that are in the bondage of self. O M !
Thou Perfect Enlightened One, enlighten all sentient beings, and bring
them into the center of the Sun of the ABSO LU TE.’ ”
Ave Maria was asked to make a report for the archives:
She heard a voice speak from Heaven:
“Three new Disciples of the Lord of Love are in the making—Mahatma
Koot Hoomi, Ave Maria and the Silent Watcher.”
And Ave Maria said,
“I touch the vibrations of the Great Lord of Love. I do not claim a
reward.”
Her heart overflowing with the rays of the Lord of Love,
she added:
“A ll my accomplishments I la}^ at your feet, Lord of Love, only happy
to be at your service. I have never before touched such vibrations as the
Lord of Love sends forth. I feel myself held in His aura. To describe how
one feels when becoming one with this Lord is impossible.”
As the Silent Watcher I wrote the following for the archives
188
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
of the Great White Lodge, having been asked to write some­
thing as a mark of appreciation of initiations received:
“The great White-Nature of the Lord of Love, ‘the Dwarf that sitteth
in the Center,’ now comes forth to dwell with the Gods and Goddesses of
the earth, in their Hearts of Light. May all blend into the ONE GREAT
LIGH T that brings forth the Golden Age, when ALL M AN KIN D shall
sorrow no more, but eternal Peace and Goodwill shall reign forever through­
out the world. Now my heart shall rejoice with humanity, and its over­
flowing Light of Gold shall radiate throughout all creation. A ll hail the
Lord of Love! May His Spirit Flame blaze up in every human heart. Let
us recognize only the White-Nature in all beings, conditions and things,
thus the Tempter is M ASTERED, resistance is ended—A M ASTER IS
BORN. Jesus said: ‘Resist not evil’.”
Of course the Student of Light will understand that I can­
not give out for publication all the deeper work I was given
along with the initiations I received, but I wish you to know and
realize that Lord Maitreya is the Great Initiator, and I have been
chosen by the Great White Lodge as well as by Him as His
Chief Priest and Officer in the outer octave or plane of life.
This does not mean necessarily that you need to see me personally
in order to receive the inner initiations.
Any sincere student of Light can call to Saint Germain, Lord
Maitreya, Mahatma Koot Hoomi or any of the Ascended
Masters and if they have advanced or developed sufficiently they
will contact these Great Ones on the inner planes. However
many times the personal contact with a master embodied is
essential to one’s ascension, just as it was with me and has been
with others who have ascended under my instruction since I
first ascended. It is not difficult to classify a student as to his
or her degree of attainment once the Master is near them for a
time.
The ascension of anyone depends upon several factors, among
which are: Karma or the debts you owe in the way of individual
compensation to other persons in your various embodiments;
every destructive act or evil crime you might have done in any
embodiment must be balanced; you must make good every bad
thing you ever did; for the evil seeds you have sown, you must
sow good seeds; you must acquire the habit of constantly thinking
beautifully and constructively; you must sacrifice ALL for the
upliftment of humanity in the same sense that Jesus did; you are
not ready to ascend until you are ready and willing to give your
very life for humanity in order to save them and assist them to
establish the “Kingdom on earth.”
189
LORD MAI T R EYA
That is what Saint Germain did. He agreed with His Father,
even long before He embodied this time, to sacrifice His human
life for mankind. Jesus did the same thing. Koot Hoomi, Ave
Maria, Morya, Hilarion, Serapis, Mahachohan, Maitreya and
all the Lords and Gods, Lordesses and Goddesses of the White-
Nature who are needed, are now embodied to awaken our
Brothers and Sisters of the Shadow to the True Light of Christ.
They are right here on earth in PHYSICAL BODIES LIKE
YOURS IN EVERY RESPECT EXCEPT THAT THEY
DO HAVE QUALITIES WITHIN THEIR BODIES AND
BRAINS AND SPIRITS AS THE RESULT OF THEIR
HAVING ASCENDED INTO THE COSMIC CENTER
that you do not yet possess. But, Beloved, they are here embodied
to teach you, to show you the practical, scientific, means of attain­
ing to the heights of the Gods in body, in mind, in spirit and in
Cosmic Consciousness.
Saint Germain, who had ascended from His outer body, so
it is more or less historically recorded, sometime during the
seventeenth century, conceived the idea of the mass ascension
of all mankind, called for the cooperation of all the Great Gods
in the Cosmic Realms of the Father to assist Him, and thus,
today we have the universal activity of the “I AM” which is
not directed by any one group in the outer. All the advanced
people of Light in whatever organization, church, denomination,
fraternity, club, or whatever they claim, are NOW banded
together in the inner planes with Saint Germain and the Brothers
of the Great White Lodge.
As a matter of explanation, Friends of Light, I see almost
every day, people who are Jewish in their Etheric Bodies, but
Protestant in their physical outer bodies; Protestants in physical
bodies who are Catholics in their etheric bodies; Chinese Oriental
Philosophers in American bodies; Catholic Priests in Protestant
Minister’s bodies; Protestant Ministers in Catholic Priest’s
bodies, etc., etc., but ALL THOSE OF LIGHT ARE BAND­
ING TOGETHER “IN THE ONE BODY WEE,” WHICH
IS CHRIST LORD MAITREYA, and I AM the physical
body of Saint Germain’s and I AM THE LEADER OF THE
WHITE FORCES IN THIS PHYSICAL OCTAVE and “I
AM THE DOOR THAT NO MAN CAN SHUT” for I have
been chosen by Lord Maitreya as the “DOOR.” He who has
ears to hear the “Voice of the Almighty,” let him hear. CHRIST
IS INCARNATE.

CHAPTER XXV
APPLE-BLOSSOM S
There came to me
In early morning’s quiet reverie
A vision of a flowering apple tree,
Filled with blossoms—pink and white
And tints of blue,
In betwix dew-splashed leaf-ends
Peeping through,
Whose shadows cast by the blazing sun,
Traced a filigree of natural art below,
Shimmering on a grassy sea of green just so,
Midst spangled splotches of thick sunshine
The earth, sky and lovely tree combine,
W ith the faint but very fragrant breeze,
That deftly fans my glowing face,
Prompts me stretch forth my hand to trace
This burst of color radiance
Blazing all about the place.
Then, from the quaint silence,
In the cool morning air
That made all sounds come
Like musical notes so clear,
I heard the whistle of a meadow lark shrill,
Singing his happy song from a distant hill.
Amidst such splendor a stillness came over me
’Twas love for a blooming apple tree
Bedecked in the radiant jewels of Nature.
Diamonds of dew,
With sunbeams sifting through;
The glint and the glow
From grasses below;
A million little blossoms,
A trillion tiny faces,
Each beaming a smile,
Each sporting its style;
191
LORD M A I T R E Y A
The lark’s cheery song
As the breeze came along—
Such things of beauty,
Such works of art ;
Each aided the view,
Each did its part
In outpicturing Nature
In form and sound,
AS LOVE W O U LD HAVE IT.
T H A T ’S W H A T I FOUND.
Sun-drenched, scintillating,
Blooming apple trees—
A ll delight in such beauty scenes as these.
It was on May 29, 1941, that I was actually declared
MASTER. Eleven days after my 45th birthday,—eleven days
after May 18, 1941—I was really and truly given—by the
Masters Themselves—the name MASTER Amsumata (The
Radiant One) in my outer body and mind—authorized by Lord
of Lords Maitreya—spoken by Mahatma Koot Hoomi. It was
also explained by Mahatma Koot Hoomi that I AM John, the
Brother of Jesus—John of the Christ School—Amsumata in
the Yoga School.
Koot Hoomi came forth and explained:
“Koot Hoomi speaks,” He said, making the Master’s saluta­
tion to me. “You are of the Priesthood of Lord Maitreya.
Go by one particular name, which is Master Amsumata (The
Radiant One). You are to be known also as John, Disciple of
Christ, during your teaching; in the other work, Yoga, etc.,—
Master Amsumata, now Master of Christ—Master Amsumata of
the Christ Sun, the Radiant One of the Hindus—BOTH
SCHOOLS—School of Christ, School of Yoga.”
Then Koot Hoomi told me something of the Mastery of Ave
Maria which I am not permited to state. However, I will say
this regarding Mary the Mother of Jesus—SHE IS FAR BET­
TER KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD IN THE ORIENT
IN HER HIGHER ACTIVITY THAN SHE IS IN THE
WESTERN WORLD. IT WILL BE A LONG TIME
BEFORE THE AVERAGE MINISTER OR PRIEST IN
THE OUTER WORLD, RISES TO THE HIGH DEGREE
SHE HAS ATTAINED, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
HER. GOD BLESS HER IN ALL HER GREATNESS,
192
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
HER LOVE, HER COSMIC INTELLIGENCE AND HER
FEARLESSNESS IN DOING WHAT SHE KNOWS TO
BE RIGHT AND GOOD.
And just following Mahatma Koot Hoomi’s explanation,
Mary and Joseph appeared to me in their ancient garb of hun­
dreds of years ago. She described the home, even, where we had
lived during the Ministry of Jesus almost 2,000 years ago. She
was dressed neatly as a Galilean. She was not Jewish, she
explained. She was of the House of Jesse. Joseph (He was
KH or KH WAS Joseph) also explained that He was of the
House of David, but did not follow the Jewish religious rites,
but both were of the Essenean Priesthood. They ate no meat of
any kind, he said, and mostly lived on vegetables and fruits, like
the Initiates of the School of Apollo of Greece.
Both, Mary and Joseph, in their ancient garb—in the Spirit of
that time—came to congratulate me, their son John in that age,
upon my attainment of Mastery in this embodiment. They even
took me with them in consciousness back to that time. It was as
though we went there. They lived, or WE lived, in a very com­
fortable home. Mother Mary was a frugal mother and house­
wife. She spun clothing, stored vegetables and fruits and was
immaculately clean in all her household duties. She was alone
much of the time and used any spare moments she had in prayer
and meditation. The Brotherhood to which they belonged taught
the deeper interpretations of the Holy Scripture, but they had
to be most secretive regarding the higher teachings. “Jesus’
teachings had nothing to do with the Jewish doctrines,” Joseph
told me. “This is why the Jews persecuted Jesus as they did.”
Joseph was a good provider. He was, as has been explained
to me by Koot Hoomi and Ave Maria since, a Wise Teacher at
that time. He was of the Magi himself. Those of today who
think Joseph was not the father of Jesus do not understand the
spiritual interpretation of the “Immaculate Conception.” That
Spiritual Conception has little to do with physical parenthood.
Jesus was the son of Joseph and Mary as is distinctly shown
in the First Chapter of St. Matthew, the 16th verse, “And Jacob
begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,
who is CALLED Christ.”
There is much more said or written regarding the birth of
Jesus, all of which I do not deny nor affirm, but I do know that
Christ is not born of man nor woman, but of God the Father.
The one important thing for the millions of so-called Christians
193
LORD M A I T R E Y A
to understand is that Jesus was the physical man; Christ was and
IS the Son of God. This principle had not, when the Bible was
translated and published, been fully understood, nor is it under­
stood by many today. It cannot be understood fully until one
attains Christhood himself. We are now entered into the New
Age when all who “seek shall find” the secret to which I refer.
Ave Maria is the Bride; Lord Maitreya is the Bridegroom.
“Fear not, I am with you always.” To him who has love enough
in his heart all things are possible. Beloved, ask that your love
be increased. Call to the Lord of Love. He is Maitreya. Ask
that your faith be also increased, your wisdom, your intelligence.
Be not afraid of anything, so long as you KNOW you are
RIGHT and TRUE.
Look for the spiritual interpretation of the Bible that is
there hidden for those who are to receive it. “Read the Scrip­
tures for in them ye THINK ye have everlasting life.” Study
them carefully. I have given you some of the keys to the Scrip­
tures. I shall give you more anon.
Pray, affirm, decree, to understand the SPIRIT. Did you
understand the Spirit—yes, THE SPIRIT—then you can come
to me IN SPIRIT and IN TRUTH, and I shall teach you, just
as I have been taught by Lord Maitreya, KH, Ave Maria,
Mahachohan, Jesus, Anoma, Sanat Kumara, Krishna, Buddha
Gautama and others. You know how instantaneous electricity
is in running through a wire or any metallic conductor, don’t you?
Well, Beloved, Lord Maitreya is even more instantaneous, if
that were possible. You have listened to your radio at home,
haven’t you? Do you ever wonder just how you are able to bring
that music, those words and all from out of the atmosphere?
There is but ONE ATMA Sphere. There is but ONE SPIRIT.
You cannot hide from ME. I SEE. YOU THROUGH THE
ONE EYE OF GOD. I HEAR YOU THROUGH THE ONE
EAR OF GOD. I FEEL YOU THROUGH THE ONE
HEART OF GOD. I am here, I am there, I am everywhere
IN SPIRIT. I AM HIS SON. HE IS MY FATHER.
There is nothing in My Father’s House that I do not have access
to. My Father has been so very loving and kind to ME. He is
your Father, too, but maybe you have forgotten to call to Him.
Be not afraid. He has asked you through ME to COME HOME
AGAIN. “I AM THE DOOR.” No one need to know that
I am now talking to you. We—you and I—are Brothers in the
Light. I understand how you feel about all these spiritual mat-
194
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
ters. You are no different than any other human being. That
is right. You are a “chip off the same block,” so to speak. I
probably know much more about you than you do about your­
self, just as those who taught me, knew far more about me than
I did about myself when I first contacted the Masters.
Frankly, candidly, I’m going to tell you, Beloved—now that
we are talking these things over—you and I—here in this Quiet
Spirit—that there is so very much conceit and egoism shown
by the average minister of the present-day churches (the average,
I mean) and priests, too, for that matter—that if I were them, I
sure would be ashamed to call myself a theologian. It is pitiful
how little they really do know. I realize that they will not feel
very friendly toward me when they happen to read these lines,
but I cannot help it because they are ignorant of the truth unless
they first acknowledge their lack of understanding. Then I might
teach them something. I’m not just like “Bob” Ingersoll. He
didn’t know much about the Bible. I do know something about
it—even something the average priest or minister does not know.
I know what they think I do not know and just a little besides.
HOW DO I KNOW? I KNOW THE ONE SPIRIT.
Read the Scriptures. Trust in God, in Lord Maitreya,
Christ, to enlighten you from within your heart. Your heart
knows more than any priest or minister in the world. Your heart
knows more than the Pope at Rome, even though I love the
Pope for the marvelous work he does for the good of mankind.
At the RIGHT TIME the Pope will make one move that will
electrify the world. When Lord Maitreya gets ready for him to
move, HE WILL MOVE. All such ecclesiastical matters are
under the observation of the Lords of Light. Just watch and
pray. “THAT DAY COMETH.” “Love casteth out all fear.”
I am with you, ALWAYS. Christ is incarnate.
These are momentous times. “The great change” is at hand.
The Lords of Light hold supreme power over all peoples at
this time. Soon “the Trumpet will sound,” and the “walls of
Jericho shall fall.”
On June 3, 1941, Lord Maitreya came to me to give me
instructions as to my future activity. As I have intimated to you
before, Lord Maitreya is a being who says nothing unless it is
important. Frequently when Fie comes into my Presence he says
not a word, but radiates His Light and Love about me. At other
times He came to cleanse my aura. He would make a certain
sign, which represents an important symbol, and holding that in
195
LORD MA I T R EY A
His hand He would, in a sense, comb all darkness out of my aura.
It was amazing to me. As we walk among outer people and con­
ditions during the day we often contact dark entities, and unless
we are perfectly harmonious they are apt to hang in our auras.
It takes some affirmation or the power radiated by certain symbols
to dissolve or eradicate such influences. I could actually feel the
pressure of such things lift from me as though He were taking
weights from my brain and body. I have learned how to handle
such things myself now, therefore, as soon as any pressure inimical
to my general welfare comes about me, I immediately use the
protective signs, symbols, WORDS and affirmations given me by
the Ascended Masters. There is no condition they cannot handle.
At any time you do not feel right there is a psychic, etheric, mental
or physical condition causing it. Generally such conditions are
caused in the etheric body. If left to develop they affect the
mentality as well as the physical body, thus serious sickness may
result.
Lord Maitreya told me to take down notes. He gave me the
following instructions regarding my work:
“FROM THE WORLD TEACHER
LORD MAITREYA
“TO THE SILENT WATCHER (AMSUMATA) :
“The next field to be investigated is the field of your
former teacher, D_____ C______ For that reason you
need the assistance of the Master of the Fourth Ray,
Serapis. Kindly give Master Serapis the message that you are
requested to look into the work of D.............C..............., Mas­
ter RC, and his field of activity. You go there without enmity.
This time you go there as the Silent Watcher of the Great
White Lodge, so ask the Goddess Ave Maria to call on
Serapis for permission to investigate D.............C...............and
his activity. She is the head of the religions of the West
and wishes those activities to be investigated.”
“You will deliver a lecture in Seattle that will make you
known as a Master of Wisdom. I believe you need ‘A.............’
• in your investigations as Silent Watcher.”
“The next following to investigate is A............., which
needs a thorough investigation, to say it mildly. All those
mushroom activities need investigation by the Silent Watcher

and Ave Maria as you did in the “I AM” activity. All the
“I AM” activities are now in the hands of the World
Teacher, as through the assistance of Ave Maria, who is
the head of all the religions in the West.”
“I wish Ave Maria to direct Her Light to the Unity
Workers, as the symbol for which they stand is the winged
Sun, which is the symbol Ave Maria also uses. These can be
reached by the Golden Sun, the White Sun, the Blue Sun and
the Pink Sun, as long as it is the Great Light they seek. I see
that the Unity Work can be greatly built out, as one through
which they can be led to Sun Initiation.”
“ ‘THOU ART, OH, GOD, OUR WINGED SELF.’ ”
“She, Ave Maria, must direct her Sun to the Unity
Workers and initiate them, those who are ready—on the
INNER PLANES—NOT ON THE OUTER. She should
do no teaching on the outer. On the inner planes the teaching
is done by the Great Light. The teaching of the outer is by
the Lesser Lights.”
“You and Ave Maria are soon not to be seen, but only
felt. The LIGHT IS THE INITIATOR.”
“You, Silent Watcher, do not have to feel that you are
obligated to anyone. Your spiritual work is payment.”
“The lady, Mrs. C..........., I have in mind starting a sort of
boarding house, where she might keep certain ones who may
come here to be initiated into the Great Light. You might
be able to aid her in finding such a place, in helping her to
build it, even. Something might be built out of shakes and
beaver board—not anything elaborate. You might look about
for a place and assist her. Here you have Krishna’s Well
and Christ’s Well.”
“You will go to Seattle, deliver a lecture and return to
Mt. Shasta in a few months. In Seattle you will look into
various centers to find those ready for initiation. You should
have a place here where to assist them and initiate them. You
two, Ave Maria and Silent Watcher, have an enormous field.”
“You shall speak in Seattle as the Silent Watcher. Those
who do not need blazing decrees, those who are ready to
receive the Wisdom of the Sages, are the ones you shall draw
to you; those who are ready to become Masters.”
“When love offerings are given then the Sister (A.M.)
might buy the property where the barns are located. Then
197
LORD M A I T R E YA
a monastery can be developed with your assistance. Develop
a cheaply constructed monastery. This is your work. It may
be a shack when you first build it, but it will be a palace when
you are finished with it.”
“Reach to all—to all students of religious thought in the
West.”
“Do not limit yourself to any one or other thought or
religion, but embrace all religious thought.”
“Also put up the Wheel of the Dharma and place the
students on the Wheel. Let them be initiated by the different
Bodhisattvas of the Dharma. In the center of the Lake on
the Lotus Throne, is the World Teacher sitting, watching
the turning of the Wheel, and initiations of mankind. And
all are born from His Tathagatta Womb, born anew, His
own true Children.”
“Who that is born of My Spirit is my own heir, my own
True Son, and in My Spirit He goes forth to do My Will.
My Priests are ever ready at My command to do whatever
I ask them to do. Even Ave Maria is recognized by me as
my Great Priest, even though I have not yet spoken to her
regarding this on the outer plane. She is my Great Priest and
I am well pleased with Her services, as the Great Priestess
from on High, the SUN of the FATHER.”
“This to Ave M aria: She is not overlooked, not even by
the World Teacher, and I wish to express my deepest grati­
tude as to what she has done, last night, concerning an activ­
ity which she knows. More power to Ave M aria! All your
powers are now placed in your hands, as I am sure you are
able to take care of it.”
“This message following is given to A.M.; by the World
Teacher:
“Who the World Teacher is you know, Ave Maria.
Do you remember when I allowed you to write a letter to
the most feared being in Europe as the officer of Lord
Maitreya the World Teacher? This is me. Even then you
had accomplished something. This to make you understand,
that you need not escape through the Ninth Ray to unite with
the Cosmic Father. Do, please, cooperate ever, and do not
hurt me. I love you in the Great Love of the Infinite, all
embracing, although there were a few difficulties, rather
misunderstandings, all is well, and I also give you the greet­
ings of your Beloved Husband Mahatma Koot Hoomi. I
198
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
assure you that through you both your radiation of Love
THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE COSMIC
HEART, HUMANITY IS FED WITH THE MILK
OF THE SPIRIT. This, again, to make you understand
that all is well.”
“Mahatma Koot Hoomi is at present on a mission which
He must fulfill for me. Let your heart not be troubled.
In Presence He is ever around you, as you know. As soon as
this mission is fulfilled He will come to you.”
KNOW THIS, BELOVED ONES OF LIGHT “THAT
ONCE IN A TIME THOSE ARE BORN WHO LEAD
HUMANITY, AND WHEN THESE COME, THEY ARE
PROTECTED, AND THERE APPEARS A SIGN, THE
SIGN OF THE CROSS IN THE HEAVENS. THIS SIGN
HAS AGAIN APPEARED AFTER LONG AGES.” And I
AM directed by a Radiant Star that flashes out of the heavens
to remind me of the Way I am to go. And that Star I know
to be the Light of Ave Maria who ever guards Saint Germain
(Amsumata) in His work among the people of earth. Ave
Maria has been called “NADA” by certain Messengers of
Saint Germain. She, Ave Maria, is also known as the “Goddess
of Justice.” She weighs all, and those who “are wanting” now,
shall “reap what they have sown,” for these are “the last days
before that great and dreadful day of the Lord.” “Judge not
lest ye be judged.”

CHAPTER XXVI
The first real proof I had of my ascension in this present
episode of the latter part of my present embodiment, was on the
night of May 29, 1941. The Seven of Us of the Council of the
Great White Lodge were in session in the Inner Council Room
of the Inner Retreat of the Brotherhood of Mount Shasta, all
present also being members of the Lemurian Brotherhood. I
have given you the names of these before.
I shall picturize as nearly as possible just how this strange
meeting appeared. We were all more or less relaxed, some
sitting and a few of us standing, in one end of the chamber.
Before us, in an open space toward the other end of the room,
was a tiny little elf, neatly dressed in the modern appearance of a
present-day business man. Actually he was no more than three
or four inches tall at most. He held a paper in his hand from
which he read a message from the outside world. He was most
emphatic in his discourse regarding the need at this time of
assistance from the Gods in establishing the forth-coming Golden
Age. We all had to give him our utmost attention, for, to say
the least, he was a “silver-tongued orator.” He walked up and
down before us much as a lawyer does when pleading his case
before a judge and jury. I noticed, particularly, his tiny feet, and
how spritely he moved about. He was most serious about the
matter under discussion, which, of course, made his statements
the more emphatic.
There was a great golden door at the end of the chamber
next to our Lilliputian orator. Occasionally he would step toward
that door as though in an endeavor to reach the massive door
knob to open it, as it were, to invite us Great Giants into the
outer world to do there the needed work necessary in preparing
the people of the world for the New Golden Age. I distinctly
recall how massive I felt in the presence of that mite of a figure.
I also definitely recorded in my Saint Germain Mind, too, the
great impression the tiny fellow was making on the minds of the
other Lords present. I gathered from his talk that he was a
newspaper man, a writer, and lecturer. His knowledge of the
great philosophies was comparable, too, I recall, to that of the
200
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Lords of Wisdom of the Great White Lodge. As he tripped so
lightly over the floor toward the Great Door, I noticed those
trim tiny feet again and remarked to those present, “I believe he
is even getting smaller.” Yes, he did seem to be growing smaller
while we were looking at him. And just then another entered
the scene of activity.
Ave Maria, the only Goddess present, soared like a great
bird through an upper door to the left and above the Great
Door of Gold. She said she would go to the outer world to
assist this one who had dared to come to the Council Chamber
of the Great White Lodge and appeal for help for mankind.
Others of us agreed also to assist him.
And as the scene closed I saw the tiny Great Orator walk
again to the Massive Golden Door. Still he strove to open it,
but this time he seemed to know that Ave Maria would open the
door from the other side. The little fellow had been polite,
kind and courteous all through his discourse. In fact I as well
as the others, I believe, were much in love with him because of
his earnestness, his beautiful appearance, and the wisdom of his
words. Just before the “curtain fell” the speaker, while reaching
up toward the door knob, turned his body at such an angle that
I saw the side contour of his head. Then I noticed his hair was
rather long, the shape of his head most familiar, and, on closer
scrutiny, I discovered that he was Norman R. Westfall in minia­
ture. He was then the “passing” of my outer personality. I
heard of him but once after that. He came to me the next day
as a messenger boy from Mahatma Koot Hoomi with a message
for Ave Maria. I have not seen him since. Yes, he was a pretty
nice fellow, I thought.
Every word of this above narrative is true. It was one of the
proofs to me of my being in the outer the Temple in which Saint
Germain carries on His transcendent work among mankind.
“Little Norman” represents just how small your outer person­
ality must become, comparatively speaking, before you can
ascend. Another thing it taught me in my outer mind was the
possibility of us, even in our limited minds and activity, going
DIRECT TO THE ASCENDED MASTERS to get assist­
ance in performing our duties here.
The outer personality must be so “cast down” in one respect,
yet so “enlarged” in another direction, that we are ONE IN
SPIRIT with the Center of All Life. After all, the Ego, which
in one sense is the Electronic Presence or “I AM” Presence,
201
LORD MA I T R E Y A
must become manifest in our outer consciousness. The Person­
ality, on the other hand, must, along with the outer mind, give
way to that Egoic Light. The human mind is the greatest handi­
cap to Spiritual Conception, yet we can do nothing without it.
It must become our willing servant. When we want it to act, it
will act. When we want it to be peaceful, harmonious and per­
fectly tranquil, it will become the “quiet water” upon which we
see the reflections of the Christ Presence.
I shall quote, with the permission of Lord Maitreya and the
Ascended Masters with whom I am associated, a part of a dis­
course delivered by my Higher Christ Presence (Saint Germain)
in Cincinnati, Ohio, October 27, 1936, as it was reprinted in
“The Voice” magazine, December Number, 1936, which gives
a very clear idea about why we have physical bodies:
“Many throughout America and the world have wondered and
wondered: why human beings have physical bodies—why they were
allowed to come into the limited condition in which mankind finds
itself today. The reason is perfectly logical: because in past ages, when
mankind was given free will, individuals steadily and gradually began
to claim and hold the power in the form, in the outer activity of the
mind, through the intellect. That lowered the rate of vibration of the
structure of the bodies, until it has reached its present density. That
activity, having been the reason for lowering your own vibratory action
and causing the density in which you find yourselves today, then in
having the knowledge of your ‘Mighty I A M Presence,’ you CAN
CON SCIOUSLY ASCEND from the point to which you descended.
Mark you! it is A LL the activity of consciousness and feeling is con­
sciousness just the same as thought.”
Now, Blessed Ones, I quote the above principally because
thousands of so-called “I AM” students have gotten the errone­
ous idea that in order to ascend one has to “pass out,” take up
their physical body with them like “David Lloyd” is said to
have done, or something of that kind. The main thing, in order
to ascend, is just what was said above, “YOU CAN CON­
SCIOUSLY ASCEND PROM THE POINT TO WHICH
YOU DESCENDED.” “David Lloyd,” I venture to say, if he
did ascend (and I do not doubt), was taken up just as Ave Maria
was when she was at the border of Tibet at the time she was
carried by levitation by Koot Hoomi and Morya to their Retreat
at Shigatse. Yes, I would guess that “David Lloyd” is now,
sound and well, in a physical body, in one of the Retreats in
India, Arabia, in the Gobi Desert, or somewhere like that. And,
202
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I may add, for the benefit of Mrs. Ballard or any other student
who does not wholly understand, that it is not unusual for
Ascended Masters to do just such stunts as that. I have seen
many things even more strange and mysterious.
The principal point for us to concentrate upon in order to
ascend is service to mankind. When we forget ourselves in our
eagerness to help others to see and understand the higher states
of consciousness, we are liable to catch sight of our “I AM”
Presence. Step by step, in service to mankind, degree by degree,
we lift ourselves in consciousness up to where we were—BACK
TO PAR—BACK TO GOD. And whether you have a physical
body or not does not matter—the main thing is GET THERE
IF YOU CAN.
Now, I know I have that Higher Mental Body. I have seen
it, not once but hundreds of times; examined it, felt of it and
thrilled to the marvelous feeling of immortality, indestructi­
bility. I shall tell you of an experience I had in 1925, which
proved to me that I had even ascended then, for I was conscious
of my “I AM” Presence.
My physical father had passed on but a few months pre­
vious. My father had never understood me. He loved me very
much, but there was always that “something” about me that
put him on “edge” when I was near him, even when I was a tiny
boy. It took me many years to analyze the reason for that.
When I was seven years of age he came home one night intoxi­
cated and almost beat me to death because I would not say “calf
rope.” I did not say it. My mother, at last, weeping, fearing he
might kill me, begged him to stop beating me. Now, I know
there were certain Blacks who knew of my identity and as entities
they entered his body at times to try to get him to get rid of me.
Many were the times I wept because of my father, even after I
was grown up. I was living in Olympia, Wash., when my father
passed. I wanted no ill feeling existing between us after he
passed. I had even sent him occult books to read the last few
years of his life. I desired very much to erase anything that
might hinder him or myself in advancing along the pathway of
Light.
One night I was conscious of going to him in my Higher
Body. I rose or ascended into the air, travelled through the
ether for what seemed like a great distance and finally came
to a beautiful valley. On each side of the wide valley were
scraggy oaks growing on low clay hills, I remember. Below
203
LORD MAI TREYA
in the level plains were farm houses, barns, cattle and other farm
stock. I saw men working in the fields. At last I came to a par­
ticular farm home, went to the barn, around through some stalls
and into a granary, where I found my father. He looked happy,
and joyously embraced me. I noticed that his body was more
rosy than when in earth life, but so far as tangibility is concerned,
he felt just the same. We talked about things there just as if we
had not seen each other for some time. He told me of the farm
and the work he was doing. He had always talked of owning an
ideal farm. He was enjoying just such perfect surroundings. I
felt exactly as if I were visiting a foreign country. I went about
there in the granary feeling of the boards of which it was built
to see if they were like what we have here. Actually I could see
no difference.
There was one thing that did puzzle me, however. My
father had had his left limb amputated above the knee about
seven years before his death. That limb was still missing. I
remarked, “I thought you would have both limbs here.” Before
he could explain anything to me regarding it there was a voice
spoke to me from somewhere which said, “We are applying a
solution upon it. In time it will be all right. We have to erase
from his consciousness the idea that he has that limb amputated.
As soon as his mind is healed he will have both limbs perfectly.”
So, you may see, my father was not in his Higher Mental
Body, but in his Etheric Body. You may understand from this,
Beloved, how important it is to do what work we can in this
octave while we have a good physical body, for what we do not
do here is pretty hard to do after we get beyond this plane. In
this body is where we have to prove to be Master.
Suddenly I took a look at my own body while I was there,
and I saw what a radiant, glowing body I possessed, for when
I looked, it was instantly, as it were, stripped of clothing, and I
stretched forth my hands toward heaven and exclaimed, “Why
I’m immortal! I’m indestructible! Nothing can harm me ! Noth­
ing can touch me!” And I shall never forget that thrilling feel­
ing that vibrated through my being.
I visited with my father for a while and then I said, “Well,
Papa, you know now I can come here and see you.”
“Yes,” he replied, “and I know that not one in a million can
come here and return to where you are going.”
While speaking of the various bodies we possess I wish to
make it known to Students of Light who might have gotten the
204
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
idea that Ascended Masters do not have physical bodies, that
I do not believe they can show me in any of Saint Germain’s dis­
courses, even those delivered by Messenger Guy Ballard, where
he stated that the Ascended Masters did not have physical bodies
on earth. Theosophical students have known for more than a
half century that Koot Hoomi and Morya, who are Ascended
Masters, have physical bodies. I have known two Masters in
particular, right here in the United States, whom I now know
to have been Ascended Masters. Hard-headed human beings
of course cannot accept but what they have actually experienced
themselves.
So, My Doubting Friends, I do not blame you for your
doubts, for I know you cannot KNOW of the Ascension and
ONENESS WITEI THE FATHER until you experience it
yourself. With faith, however, in those of us who have experi­
enced it, we can show you the means by which you can prove it
to yourself, if you will diligently, sincerely follow our instruc­
tions. We cannot tell you just WHEN, for no two students
require the same time nor the same teaching and instruction, but
I, with the help of Lord Maitreya and other Masters of Light,
am sure I can open up a New World for you that will be ample
proof and will satisfy you that life is eternal, and it is exactly
“WHAT YOU MAKE IT.”
Christ is within your Heart. Look for Him there, and re­
member I have given you a Golden Heart. I AM THE
GOLDEN BODY OF GOD. I AM the Son of the God of
the Golden Heart. I AM the Prince of the Golden Heart.
“Fear not, I am with you ALWAYS.”
205
CHAPTER XXVII
Between May 29 and June 4, 1941, I experienced enough,
in the inner planes and my outer activity, should it have been
recorded and written about, to fill several good-sized books.
I had been told of my membership not only in the Great
White Brotherhood, but also definitely experienced, in my Egoic
Presence (I AM Presence) the spiritual knowledge of my being
a member of the Council of Seven of the Great White Lodge.
Yes, Beloved Seeker of Light, I make this statement, without
fear, knowing that My Father and all the Great Masters, includ­
ing Lord Maitreya, Solar Christ (Logos) to this Universe, are
my PROTECTORS.
In 1936 I was tortured by Blacks on the inner and outer
planes to such an extent that I had to leave Bremerton, Wash­
ington, where I then lived. There were several weeks I had to
keep in hiding, even from my wife and children—October and
part of November, 1936—in order to preserve life in this
physical body.
It was during that time that in the presence of two persons,
one a jeweler, the other a shoemaker, in Bremerton, a priest in
Black Robes appeared to me and said, “If you don’t keep still
we will get you. If it were not for your children we would not
allow you to get home this evening. An accident would happen
to your car. I come from the Head Man. You had better keep
still.”
I thank God I had protection then, and I thank the Brothers
Of Light that I have protection now. I decreed in the presence
of the Black Brother, in a very firm voice, “In the Name of Saint
Germain and All the Masters of Light, you go straight to Hell
where you belong. I stand for the LIGHT FIRST, LAST
AND ALL THE TIME, AND I SHALL TALK WHEN­
EVER CHRIST PROMPTS ME TO DO SO. YOU HAVE
NO POWER OVER ME NOR ANY SINCERE STUDENT
OF LIGHT. IN THE NAME OF CHRIST GET OUT OF
HERE AND STAY AWAY FROM ME. BEFORE HIS
LIGHT NO DARKNESS CAN REMAIN.”
206
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
That priest disappeared instantly. A few days later I went
to Portland, Ore., where I lived in an attic for several days,
with little to eat, for I had no money. This I can prove by two
persons, as well as one Master who came to my assistance. I
was on my way to a loan shop to see if I could get 50c or 75c
for my brief case, having had nothing to eat for two days, when
I met a former student of mine, Waldo S. Chase, an artist of
Seattle. He asked me to have lunch with him. He loaned me
five dollars, also, God bless him. E. R. Hansen was another
former student who assisted me at that time. There were many
people I knew in Portland at that time, to whom I could have
gone for assistance. I dared not, for esoteric reasons, approach
them. Those I contacted I met by chance. I still have my brief
case.
Last January, 1941, when I visited Bremerton I found that
both the jeweler as well as the shoemaker, before whom the
priest had appeared, had passed on. I had not heard of their
decease until I returned there. The jeweler’s name was McDon­
ald, the shoemaker, Jack Phipps.
While in Portland I spent most of my time praying for proper
direction in what I should do. I knew that the time for the Great
Mission for which I was sent into this world was approaching.
I also knew I had to be alone to get into the Great Spirit in order
to get my bearings. My physical and mental condition had to be
purified. A Master from Los Angeles (Whittier) came to me,
in His physical body. Through Him and my own Presence of
Light, I was directed to Eureka, California.
Do not fear anybody or anything, Blessed Students of Light,
so long as you know Christ is with you. As Root Hoomi said to
me recently, “When He (Christ Maitreya) is with you, who can
be against you?” By “recognizing only the White-Nature” in
anybody you contact, the Black-Nature cannot act, should they
have a Black-Nature. Light is ALWAYS more powerful than
darkness. When you turn an electric light on in a dark room
there is no struggle between the light and darkness, is there?
To return to my ascension at Mt. Shasta, I must say TIME
is an insignificant element when it comes to eternity and the eter­
nal states of consciousness we no doubt experience in our Christ
Presence. The spiritual episodes of my initiations and my con­
scious work with the Great Masters on the inner planes of life
have no place with time in earth life. I have proved again and
again the fact that a vision or clairvoyant seeing of certain
207
LORD MAI TREYA
phases of outer activity in the inner planes cannot definitely be
dated in the physical plane. For instance, about fifteen years ago,
I saw Japanese troops invading the United States (on the inner
planes). War was just declared last Monday, December 8, 1941,
against Japan, following the invasion by the Japanese aerial
fleet of the Hawaiian Islands.*
I believe it was July 17, 1939, that I attended a meeting of
the “I AM” students in the “I AM” Temple directed by Ratana
in Los Angeles at 123 North Lake Street. Mr. and Mrs. Bal­
lard and their staff were present. Mr. Ballard gave one of his
well-known discourses. The Mighty Kosmos, supposed to be one
of the mightiest of beings from the Cosmic Center of all Life,
was said to have spoken through Mr. Ballard. It was the most
powerful address I have ever heard, was most constructive and
educational, and He (Kosman) stated during the discourse that
He had brought two new Rays into this earth at the time—the
Eighth and Ninth. I saw light flashing about in the temple, and
anyone, who had the least bit of faith, could certainly feel the
marvelous radiance about the place. The audience responded
miraculously to the speaker.
Now, Friend, this is what I wish to explain, or undertake
to clarify a bit: Twenty-four hours previous, just after I had
gone to bed, I had a vision of the whole visit and discourse of
the Mighty Kosman. I even saw the colors of the New Rays,
having been reminded of the time and place while standing in
the audience (all had risen from their seats) in the “I AM”
Temple on the evening of July 17. The question in my own
mind was: “HOW CAN THIS BE?” How can one see in the
outer octave a thing before it actually comes forth in the earth
plane? This matter puzzled me a great deal, even long before
the Kosman episode. However, I was drawn into a second-hand
book store two days later, July 19, and directed by My Presence to
an OAHSPE BIBLE, on a shelf there among other old books,
and I was directed to turn to page 729, which told all about the
KOSMON era now dawning. A map of the Etherean World—
the ARC of KOSMON—is there pictured. I read beneath it
the following:
“Jehovah said: When the world approacheth dan’ha in Sabea, the
nations shall be quickened with new light; for Kosmon cometh out of
the midst. And my etherean hosts shall press upon the understanding
*This book was written in November and December, 1941. Where such dates as
the above occur, please keep this in mind.—A uthor.
208
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
of men, and they shall fill all nations and kingdoms with new discoveries
and inventions and books of learning. And men shall be conceited of
themselves above all the ages past, and they shall deny Me and quarrel
with M y name, and cast Me out. But I will come upon them as a
Father, in love and mercy; AND M Y HOSTS OF HEAVEN
SH ALL CAUSE BABES AND FOOLS TO CONFOUND THE

AND M AKE M Y KIN GD O M S KN O W N . Yea, they shall encom­
pass the whole earth round about with signs and wonders, and set at
naught the philosophy of men and the idolatries of the ancients. For
both, the living and dead, shall know that I, Jehovah, live and reign
over heaven and earth. This shall be a new era, and it shall be called
Kosmon, because it embraceth the present and all the past. T

TH EY PU T A W A Y THEIR LORDS AND TH EIR GODS
AND THEIR SAVIO RS; NOR SH ALL TH EY MORE HAVE

FOR I A M SUFFICIEN T UNTO ALL .”
I mention the above incidents, and quote from the Oahspe
Bible to show you how many of us at this time, NOW EM­
BODIED IN EARTH, are here at the behest of the Great
Gods, Lords, Masters of the ONE ALMIGHTY GOD—THE
GREAT SPIRIT—THE “I AM” PRESENCE, and what we,
in our individual way, are prompted or actually told what to do,
THAT MUST WE DO, otherwise our last state shall be worse
than our first.
I, in my CONSCIOUS ASCENSION back to God or the
Spiritual Center where all Life issues, merely BECAME CON­
SCIOUS OF MYSELF, WHO “I AM” AND WHAT I AM
TO DO. And, Beloved, I AM DOING IT. I am writing this
book. This, at present, is what I am to do. What I am to do in
the future lies with Saint Germain (My Presence Eternal),
Christ Lord Maitreya, Root Hoomi, and all THOSE OF
LIGHT with whom I am associated. What the Council of the
Great White Lodge determines, that shall I do. I shall, how­
ever, have a vote in that matter myself, for I AM ONE WITH
GOD THE FATHER. I AM HIS SON. HE TOOK ME
BACK INTO HIS HOUSE. I LIVE IN THE SUN, YET
209
LORD MAI TREYA
I HAVE A BODY ON EARTH. My SUN-BODY is ray
Golden Body. My Venus-Body is my Love-Body or the source
of Love. Our Seven Bodies correspond to the Color-Radiance
of the Seven Planets, as well as the Rainbow-Rings of the Seven
Great Universes, etc., ad infinitum. There are planets invisible
as well as visible. Scientific astronomers know this. However,
the invisible planets have their influences upon us on earth some­
times even more than the visible planetary forces. The etherean
spaces through which our universe passes from age to age also
affects world conditions on earth just as at the present time. We
must, in order to understand these matters, learn to weigh all
things according to the Infinite Spirit, in which and of which all
things are made, “live, move and have their being.”
On the 3rd of June, 1941, I went through, physically and
mentally speaking, vast changes. There was even a sexual
rechemicalization went on in my physical body that I could not
possibly explain. I do know that it had to do with regeneration
of myself—both MALE AND FEMALE IN ONE, but I am
utterly without words to describe the bliss that accompanied the
ecstasy of feeling that vibrated throughout my being. I had
been told by Blessed Koot Hoomi to concentrate on transmuting
all forces in my three lower bodies into the Electronic Substance
of Divine Love and draw all into my Four Higher Bodies. That
is what I did that night when the “Great Change” came about.
I knew Lord Maitreya and Koot Hoomi had much to do with
it, but somehow I felt Lord Maitreya was more responsible for
all that took place.
It was the following evening, June 4, that I was conscious
of ascending from the etheric plane. A few days previous I had
contacted the Goddess of Light through Ave Maria. We were
sitting talking about different Masters of Light and I happened
to have mentioned the Goddess of Light. Almost immediately
she stepped through the body of Ave Maria, saying, “Ah, you
all wouldn’t care for the Goddess of Light, for I have a colored
body.”
I immediately replied, “I don’t care what kind of a body
you have, I love you just the same.” She is a marvelous being.
She stayed there and talked with us for some time. Several
times later, even after I had ascended, she would come for short
visits with us. On that first visit, however, she told us that she
lived with Jesus as His servant where He now lives in a physical
body in Arabia. In my etheric body I went to the abode where
210
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Jesus lives. Ave Maria was with me. The three of us, The God­
dess of Light, Ave Maria and I, in the living room of that small
cottage, were singing religious songs and rejoicing together when
suddenly I began to spin around and ascend. I rose from the
floor, passed through the ceiling of the room and on into the
heavens in consciousness. Ave Maria rose with me. We seemed
to have been absorbed in Nirvana or the Field of Bliss or
Infinitude.
We later returned to our etheric bodies in that room in
Arabia. I found that my etheric body had fallen, so to speak,
from the ceiling, and Ave Maria, who evidently was more aware
than I of what was taking place, had suddenly thrown her body
beneath mine in order to protect me in the fall. She explained
the matter to me the next day in the outer octave. I had two
other experiences regarding phases of my ascension later—a few
weeks later—in a retreat near Seattle,—one regarding the Great
Purusha, and the other when my body ascended on July 27, the
time that the entire fold of Saint Germain’s ascended on the
inner planes.
That day, June 4, Lord Maitreya had come to bless me and
admonish me regarding certain significant matters in my being
His Priest. He sanctified me with His radiance. He told me
how pleased He was that I had attained illumination and declared
me a Brother of the Great White Lodge. “When you go forth,”
He said, “be humility exemplified. Remember Love must ever
reign in your heart. Never endeavor to show your power or
demonstrate before others. I now take you into my Solar Ring
of Light and Love, My Son, thus you shall ever be protected
by Me, and I shall teach you in My Temple of Light and Love
what your heart desires to know. In the Sunlight of Silence you
shall drink of the Well of Christ and Everlasting Life. I wish
you to meet with the Brothers of the Brotherhood of Mt. Shasta
in incarnate bodies.” *
*Last evening, December 10, 1941, in writing about the ascension as it recurred
to my outer mind following my pondering over brief notes regarding it, I was not
satisfied with the clarity of it nor the fullness with which I felt it should be treated.
When I got to the point indicated by the asterisk above I called to Lord Maitreya,
Root Hoomi, Saint Germain and Ave Maria to bring through to my outer conscious­
ness a better understanding of just what took place at the time of my ascension. I
spoke to them quietly in just about the following manner: “Please give me a better
understanding of just what took place in me when I ascended. I know I ascended,
I know I experienced the consciousness of the Great Spirit. Show me in the inner
planes and explain it to me more clearly and allow me to bring it all back to this
outer mind right now, this evening. I must be able to explain this to my readers more
simply and clearly so they will understand it. I thank you, Beloved Masters of Light,
for your cooperation in this matter now.”

LORD MAI TREYA
I judge it was about two A.M. the next morning, when sound asleep, there was
a very loud knock on the wall just above my head that awakened me most abruptly.
There was no mistaking it as something else. I knew definitely that someone hit that
wall with that awful wallop to awaken me, and Xwas “jerked” back to this outer
consciousness so suddenly that I recalled distinctly who I was talking to and what
was said. I was talking to Ave Maria, and this is the substance of what She said:
“Have you forgotten the Maltese Cross and what it represents? The Dark Square
represents you before you began to dissolve and transmute the forces of your three
lower bodies into the Pure Gold which forms the Golden Lotus in the Center. That
became the Crown or Jewel or Golden Body which ascended, however, before you
could ascend you had to ‘eat me,’ partake of ‘the wine and the bread.’ You actually
ate of my body, My Spirit. This you did after the Resurrection. You recall to your
mind, don’t you, the crucifixion you experienced in your etheric body?” I admitted
that I had remembered it, which I must admit, too, that I had overlooked in my
description of the ascension above. Yes, I recall the great streams of blood that ran
from the holes in my hands, in my feet and from the pierced side. Even today, when
I think of that crucifixion I experienced, I can actually feel the prints of the nails in
my hands, and at times the marks become plainly visible. Then Ave Maria surprised
me by reminding me that I had often explained that “A yawn is the Soul taking a
drink.” And, Beloved, at 2 o’clock when I awakened I immediately began to yawn
and yawn, tears gushing from my eyes. For fear I would go back to sleep and forget
what Ave Maria had told me on the inner plane, I kept yawning and saying over
to myself: “Ave Maria—eating Ave Maria, yawning—Maltese Cross—tears, loud
knock on wall.” For an hour I lay awake thinking about this matter. All Her
explanation came through most clearly: Ave Maria is the BRIDE OF CHRIST;
Maitreya is the BRIDEGROOM. In Spirit I became wedded to Ave Maria; Her
Light, absorbed by my being through “weeping,” longing, yawning, dissolved and
transmuted through REGENERATION the Darkness in my “SQUARE” which
became the Cross of Malta, and in turn the GOLDEN LOTUS, when I became fully
conscious of MY SONSHIP WITH GOD OF THE GOLDEN HEART. Then is
when I became “Prince of the Golden Heart,” Christ Incarnate, which “I AM.”
“Jesus wept” is the shortest verse, I believe, in the Bible. It is also one of the
most significant. I know, too, that science is overlooking something very important
when they do not analyze yawning, for I am certain therein lies one essential invol­
untary action that gives impetus to the awakening ego or Higher Body of the aspiring
individual—an inner “weeping” which draws to the sleeping soul needed LIGHT
in building the “Golden Body,” or “that house not made by hands eternal in the
heavens.”
When you, Beloved, long for Christ Maitreya and Ave Maria with such adora­
tion as to move yourself to weeping, I am sure you will find the “babe in the manger,”
the little Golden Body of Christ. Love will find the way, “And the Spirit and the
Bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst
come; and whosoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.” LOVE, WISDOM
AND POWER are yours and “I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS.”
I quote St. Luke 13:31: “The same day there came certain of the Pharisees,
saying unto him, ‘Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee’.”
“And He (Jesus the Christ) said unto them: ‘Go ye and tell that fox, “BEHOLD
I CAST OUT DEVILS, AND I DO CURES TODAY AND TOMORROW AND
THE T H I R D D A Y I S H A L L B E P E R F E C T E D .” (33) ‘Nevertheless I must walk
today, and tomorrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish
out of Jerusalem. (34) O, Jerusalem! Jerusalem! which killeth the prophets, and
stoneth them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children
together, AS A HEN DOTH GATHER HER BROOD UNDER HER WINGS
AND YE WOULD NOT. (35) Behold your house is left unto you desolate: and
verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the TIME COME when Ye shall
say, ‘Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord’.”
. Luke 14:26: “If any man come to me and hate not his father, and mother, and
wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot
be my disciple.” (Explanation: You must Love the ONE GOD, the ONE LIFE
LIGHT, LOVE, WISDOM AND POWER of ALMIGHTY GOD ABOVE ALL
THINGS to know Christ and become HIS SON.)
212
CHAPTER XXVIII
On the evening of June 9 the Great Sanat Kumara of Venus
came to visit us at Mt. Shasta. It is He who is known as the
Father of this planet. He is one of the Great Cosmic beings
who I believe has no physical body on earth. He is understood
to be one of the Great Kumaras sent here to bring about the civi­
lization of human beings of this earth. When he came on that
evening He entered in His Spirit into the body of Ave Maria.
When He came into her body I was standing within about four
feet of Her. He stepped backward a step. As He did so I felt
His aura strike mine. What He said the few minutes He was
with us I cannot quote, but He did give me a great blessing and
radiated His Light throughout my being. Within a few minutes
following His leaving, one of the strangest manifestations of my
experiences and initiations took place, of which I shall tell you.
The room in which we were seated was still radiant from the
Light of Sanat Kumara, when I noticed the features and radiance
of Ave Maria change completely. With a somewhat amazing
look on her countenance the new visitor said, “Do not fear me;
I am a Bhodisattva. I come to bless you. I am in charge of all
girls until they become of age, and all beings under the Sign of
Virgo in the Dharma Wheel.” I said nothing, for truly I was
astonished. Then She added, “I am not as great as Sanat
Kumara.” Thus I knew that He had come to prepare the way
for her. That, I gathered, was the reason of his very short visit.
“Where am I?” asked the radiant being, her voice filled with
wonderment.
“At Mount Shasta,” I replied as calmly and composedly as
I could, for I myself wondered what this strange celestial being
might do or say next, for I positively knew she was not acting
or pretending, as some might have supposed, had they been in
my place.
“Oh, how wonderful to be here!” she exclaimed, stepping
quickly to a nearby window where she could see magnificent
Mt. Shasta in the approaching twilight, since it was just about
sunset, and at that time the mountain is always aglow with radi­
ant light, usually pink.
213
LORD MAI TREYA
As She walked back from the window, in wonderment I was
looking at Her, when She said, “Don’t fall in love with me. I
am the Virgin—the Eternal Virgin of God. No man can touch
me. I am the Nameless One.”
I realized there was an angel of transcendent glory and beauty
and grace right there in the room with me. Becoming more con­
fident of myself, I asked, “Where do you live in body?”
“I have no body,” she quickly replied, and then I could see a
look of amazement on Her face when she realized she was in a
physical body, and she inquired of me, “Whose body is this? I
am the unborn Virgin of God.” She looked down and about the
body of Ave Maria.
I answered, “Ave Maria’s.”
“Oh,” she exclaimed, “Ave Maria, the Virgin Christos—
the One that is Me on earth. I’m Her mother.”
At that moment Ave Maria, who was conscious of all that
was going on in Her body, broke down and wept. Seldom had I
seen Her weep at all, but she shook with emotion. I endeavored
to console Her after she had wept for several minutes. The
Spirit of the Bhodisattva of Virgo had gone as soon as Ave
Maria had become affected by Her Spirit and radiance. After a
while when Ave Maria became quiet she said, “When She men­
tioned ‘mother’ I could stand it no longer. There was such a
feeling of Her great Spirit and the height of vibration, I could
not keep from weeping. O, it was so wonderful. Just think of it
—my Spiritual Mother was here in my own body—from the
Great Cosmic Center where they have no bodies. They are all
Spirit—Pure Spirit. As we think of time here it has been proba­
bly millions of years since I have been so near to Her.”
For hours Ave Maria talked about that Spiritual visitation.
For days afterward I am sure it affected her, and still does, no
doubt.
On May 10, Lord Maitreya, in His Spirit, was in my body a
great deal of the time. He talked to me much about the changes
imminent, some of which have already come about, others to
come soon. He gave me the names of those who will be working
with me during the Golden Age. These names were mentioned
as “Candidates” Lord Maitreya has “chosen” : Balcheiour, Alcy­
one, Genesthai, Landowne, Clymer and Hall. Vivekananda, He
said, is reincarnating. Rudolph Steiner is willing to re-embody to
assist Ave Maria. Master Morya and the Silent Watcher will
214
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
return again. I agreed to return again to assist in the govern­
ment of the Golden Age.
I was given additional signs, symbols and words for my pro­
tection. I was informed to what Great Temples to look to for
cooperation in my work as a teacher—THE TEMPLE OF
THE BODY OF GOLD — THE DALAI LAMA, THE
HOLY OF HOLIES.
The following significant instruction I was given by Lord
Maitreya, all of which I publish, except certain secrets that can­
not be given the “initiate” until one has passed certain degrees
of attainment, after which he may be entitled to them. He said:
“The Priesthood of Golden Radiance must be initiated by you,
Silent Watcher.”
“The White Eagle is the symbol of Ave Maria, also White Swan,
and White Phoenix Bird. The White Dove is Her individual symbol.
She is the White Body of God.”
“You are the ‘Eagle-Mounted.’ Your symbol is the Golden Eagle.”
“The Sign of Sun, ‘K-20,’ The Solar Terrestial Sigil, the Earth
Sun, the Whole Cube or Universe, from the center of the earth to
Infinity; metal, Gold; color Gold; power of Holiness.”
“You are of the Priesthood of the Golden Radiance of Egypt”
(S.W .).
“You are the Golden Man in the Heart.”
“You are the Prince of the Golden Heart.”
“You are the Golden Presence of the Silent Watcher.”
“You are the Gold of God Incarnate.”
“You are the Universal Gold. Use the Golden Spiral in your work.”
“The Buddhas of the Dharma Fields are the protectors of the Silent
Watcher, the Body of God, protecting ever the Golden Sun, the Silent
Watcher.”
“I am resting on the Golden Lotus-Padma.”
“You are FREE from all desires, all lusts; the W ill to Be Free
makes all— FREE. ‘Phur’ has no more power over you. YO U ARE
FREE. YO U ARE SOL. Life springs from fire, and we become
‘SU L,’ the Master. ‘Sulphur’ or ‘Radchas’ causes great pain through
the chains with which He binds, causes lusts and anger while uncon­
trolled, therefore we learn to purify the Alchemical Sulphur—our
W IL L OF FREEDOM FROM ‘PH U R’ will make us FREE.
YO U HAVE M ASTERED. THE FIRE DOES N O T HARM
US AN YM O RE. SILENT W AT C H E R YO U ARE FREE.”
“Joshua and the Silent Watcher on the Wheel of Dharma in the
Field of Sagittarius, numbers to be used, 8734— metal, tin; letter, ‘O’ ;
planet, Jupiter through the mind; female, Quicksilver (M ercury);
Power of Wisdom; color, Blue.”
215
LORD MAI TREYA
“Ave Maria’s work on the Wheel of Dharma is in the House of
Virgo; numbers, 2 and 6; letter, ‘B’ ; power of soberness, earth of
Sulphur.”
“Koot Hoomi’s work on the Wheel of Dharma is in the House of
Pisces; letter ‘N’ ; numbers, 1 and 5; fire of Sulphur (Alchemical);
power of Destiny.”
On the day I discovered my Higher Presence is Saint Ger­
main, I was handed this message, typewritten, by Ave Maria
from Mahatma Koot Hoomi:
“Blessed One:
“I hasten to write you to give you the message of the Worldteacher
concerning your cooperation with Master Saint Germain. Yesterday our
new Worldteacher was appointed (?) and He writes you through me, he
that is Mahatma Koot Hoomi. I want to make it clear to you, Blessed One.
“Master Saint Germain was asked to resign as for the SERVICE OF
THE NEW W O RLDTEACH ER. Therefore he is not listed amongst
the Masters that serve the New Worldteacher. A new Master as for the
Seventh Ray was chosen, one that needs the experience of being a Master
of a Ray. Who the new Master of the Seventh Ray is I am not able to give
you as yet. You shall hear from me soon again. I am remaining,
“Sincerely,
“M ASTER OF THE W ISD O M .”
On the day the above message was given to me, I sat
down to my typewriter to write a letter to Mahatma Koot Hoomi
regarding my working with the World Teacher. There had been
an election the night previous in the Great White Lodge, which,
frankly, I did not bring through to my outer consciousness clearly
enough to get just what my position was regarding the World
Teacher. There was no date on the message Ave Maria had
given me, therefore, when I put that paper among other notes
I was keeping I failed to make a note of the date, however, I
think it was the 7th of June.
Ave Maria and I got into quite a discussion regarding who
was elected World Teacher. I knew, and She told me, the vote
lay between Koot Hoomi and Saint Germain. Now, Ave Maria,
just like all Masters I’ve seen and become acquainted with, is
very very sensitive regarding any question regarding Her posi­
tion, wisdom, love, light or power, and She is extremely
“touchy” regarding anything that might be said about her hus­
band, Mahatma Koot Hoomi, or any other Master with whom
She is associated in Her Great Work on earth. I had learned
not to disagree with Her in anything whatsoever. And, Beloved,
216
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
never “cross” a Master, or show the least bit of doubt or ques­
tion as to your obedience if you expect them to teach and instruct
you. Generally they instantly take such actions as a signal that
you are “finished” so far as they are concerned. May God bless
you should you lose your temper or control of your tongue.
Patience be with you, humility, love and the gentleness of the
Master Jesus, when you are in doubt about anything. Trying
moments will pass. In silence the Master will direct you.
When I saw that I was being “testily tried” regarding the
election of the World Teacher by the Council of the Great White
Lodge, I got up from my typewriter where I had intended writ­
ing out certain questions regarding this and my individual con­
nection with the matter. I told Ave Maria I would take a walk
alone and think things over. I explained to her (when I use a
capital letter as in “Her,” I understand the Higher Presence of
Ave Maria to be present) that I was sure Lord Maitreya would
inform me clearly about the matter once I got out alone where
I could meditate upon it.
I walked through the city of Mt. Shasta and on Highway 99
toward Shasta Springs. About a mile out of town I was invited
by a gentleman to ride. I rode with him to the entrance of the
Shasta Springs Resort. There I walked through the beautiful
grounds, down the winding trail, across the rustic bridges span­
ning the tumbling streams, and, about five hundred feet below,
seated myself in the circular band stand near the railway, to
meditate upon “WHO I AM.”
Yes, Beloved, I had been told I was this, that and the other,
and I don’t doubt but that I WAS. Right then I AM THE
SILENT WATCHER. At times I WAS LORD MAITREYA.
Again I AM JOHN THE BROTHER OF JESUS. I was
and AM certain I ONCE LIVED AS ABRAHAM LIN­
COLN. I also knew I had been the ONE who directed the Bal-
lards in the “I AM” activity. But, sitting there in this body, by
the railroad, listening to the whir and roar of the talking waters
of Mt. Shasta as they came laughing their way down from the
WHITE PEAK high in the heavens, I wondered, “WHO
AM I?”
Long I meditated there. A group of ladies came by from
up on the resort grounds. They passed very near to me, but I
sat with my chin resting in one palm, like “The Thinker,” im­
movable, still wondering, “WHO AM I?” The Spirit of Al­
mighty God seemed to enfold me. Even my body became filled
217
LORD MAI TREYA
with a tangible substance that caused me to feel rigid like the
statue of “The Thinker” himself. “WHO AM I?”
“I AM WHO?” “I was Norman Robert Westfall,” I said
to myself. Then the question came into my mind, “Yes, but who
is ‘MYSELF’?” I then started to say something about my body
and something or some being within me asked, “Whose body is
this body?” That had me stumped. I thought it was my body,
but I didn’t know who I AM.
And then, after having meditated thus for about an hour
there in that one position “I” spoke from my Heart, “Why, I
AM SAINT GERMAIN.”
Instead of walking up the winding path to the resort grounds
again I walked up the railroad. About a mile toward the city I
found a slender pathway winding its way around among flowering
shrubs, plants and trees as it rose to the height of the precipitous
plateau. I found Highway Nine-Nine and walked all the way
back to Mt. Shasta City.
I went to the cottage of Ave Maria’s where she was preparing
dinner for us both. She knew all about my trip, my medita­
tions, and even mentioned before I spoke of it, “Well, Root
Hoomi says you KNOW ALL now,” meaning, as I knew, that
I KNOW I AM SAINT GERMAIN. And it was then that
she gave me the message from Mahatma Koot Hoomi you read
above. Even now it might be a puzzling paper to me did I not
KNOW I AM ONE WITH GOD AND HIS GOLDEN
SON INCARNATED IN EARTH.
AW AKE N IN G
These days are full of trouble,
They’re also full of thought
For in the field of stubble
Is where the grain was sought.
In our saddest moments,
In the gloom,
Is when our mind’s at ferment
If we give it room.
When the sky is darkened,
Your heart is blue,
Is when you do your thinkin’,
When it comes thru.
218
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Never fear the shadow
When your thoughts are gray
Seeds will never blossom
If on top the earth they lay.
Our soul is like a seed, you know,
First planted in the earth;
The sunlight acts upon it so
It wakens to another birth.
These days are full of trouble,
Most every heart is sad,
Walking thru th’ field o’ stubble
Thinkin’ of the things we had.
Better study nature fairly;
Plant a little seed some day;
Press it down beneath th’ surface,
In the darkness let it stay.
Air, light and moistened earth,
In brooding darkness there
W ill bring to life another birth
Enriching you with fruit most fair.
Are you so doubtful as to think
That souls are planted here
Pressed into the earth to sink
By ruthless nature without care ?
Better think you’re like a seed
Pressed beneath the flowering sod
W ith a mighty spark and speed
To know at once the Light of God.
219
CHAPTER XXIX
I had planned to leave Mt. Shasta for Seattle on the 10th of
June, but Mahatma informed me that the 11th would be a better
day to travel. I do not recall anything of importance taking place
in my activity or experience during the trip that may prove bene­
ficial to my readers. I arrived in Seattle after having spent a day
in Olympia with my brother and his family. A friend and student
of mine there, Melville Burlingame, assisted me much in some
matters regarding my children, all of which were quickly ironed
out by the Masters of Light. The “Dark Brothers” had done a
little of their dirty work through a relative-in-law. I blame no
one. “I recognized only the White-Nature in everybody con­
nected with the matter” and all worked out satisfactorily.
A lady friend of mine had invited me to her home in Seattle.
From there I notified but four students of mine to whom I gave
individual instructions. They asked that I hold a meeting twice
each week, and in this way I hoped to train those few in the
higher work I had received and give them some of the initiations
I knew it was my duty to confer.
As near as I can recall, I think it was the 18th of June, in the
evening, about 11 o’clock, that the unusual again manifested. I
had informed the few students invited not to tell anyone of my
re-appearance in Seattle. When not holding private meetings
with those few I hoped to be alone with my writing and other
occult work I planned. On the particular evening mentioned,
Mrs. B........, Mrs. H........., and myself were sitting talking, when
the door bell rang very abruptly. The lady of the house went to
the door and I could very plainly hear a strong, positive man’s
voice say, “Is there a man here by the name of Amsumata?”
This was all so sudden I did, as it is commonly expressed,
“feel the hair raise up a bit on my head,” for I felt so certain no
one outside our private circle knew I was there. The lady an­
swered him, “Yes, he is here. Will you come in?” The gentle­
man was shown into my presence.
I can hardly describe the man who approached me. He was
most unusual to say the least. I am quick to size up persons, and
I knew this man to be one who had stood out alone in the world.
220
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
He was about my own height—not more than 5 feet 7 inches
tall, but had been taller. His shoulders were stooped from hard
work. He shook hands with me. His hands were large, strong
and almost horny from callouses. He bowed graciously, with a
humility expressive of deep gratitude, as he said, “I hope I am
not intruding, coming here so unexpectedly at this late hour. My
name is S......... ”
“I am indeed glad to make your acquaintance,” I said,
motioning him to a chair. “Will you be seated?” Of all the
characteristics I might have seen about our visitor, the golden
glow and radiance of his aura, which reached out three or four
feet on either side of him, caught my eye, and I could not help
but have a feeling of reverence toward him. His Higher Pres­
ence actually lighted up the entire room. At the same time I
saw the blazing blue Light of Koot Hoomi near him, which
signified to me that this new-found Brother had been sent to me.
Again he wanted to apologize for his coming at that hour.
“I hope you will forgive me, but I just could not wait. I had to
see you, Amsumata.”
“My Brother,” I said, “anyone who has as much light about
them as you have is welcome to come here any time. I do not
know what brought you here, but I do know that Koot Hoomi
is with you. When you mentioned my name at the door I could
not think it possible that any stranger might know of my pres­
ence here, however, seeing you are a Brother of Light, I wish
you to know you are indeed welcome.”
“Yes,” he explained, “Koot Hoomi told me to come here. I
was talking to Mrs. R........ and she told me I should see Amsu­
mata. She kept talking about Amsumata, about his teachings,
etc., until finally I said to her, ‘Where is this Amsumata?’ Well,
she said she was not permitted to tell, for only his students were
allowed to attend the meetings. However, I got around all that
by telling her that I did not think Amsumata would object to me
calling to see him personally. At last she told me where I could
find you. I came directly here. I am thankful to God that I have
found you and you have received me with such a kindly welcome.”
“I assure you, Brother, you are in the right place,” I said.
“If I can be of assistance to you, I shall be happy to do so. My
happiness depends upon making others happy. If I be wise then
my wisdom, in order to be proved, is manifest in service to my
fellowmen. Truly, I do not know when I’ve been so happy to see
a human being as I am this moment when I look upon you,
221
LORD MA I T R E Y A
Brother, and see the golden radiance of your soul shining through
your joyous face. Truly you are a man of God. I feel as though
I have known you always, yet it seems that I have not seen you
for ages. I know our love for each other is mutual.”
“I am a seeker after truth,” our visitor replied. “I had such
a strong urge to come here I know you must have a message for
me. All the way coming here, although I was alone physically,
I am sure there was a great spiritual Presence with me. I was
definitely conscious of it.”
“I am sure my Beloved Teacher, Koot Hoomi, was with you
when you entered the room, Brother. There is no mistaking
that. I saw His mantle of Blue enfold you, and He gave me His
sign through the radiance of His Light. It would have been
impossible for you to come here had you not belonged here. I
am securely protected by the Great Masters.”
Now, Beloved Students, I wish to explain to you just who
and what this all meant. The one who came there to that room
that evening was no other than the great Chinese philosopher
and master, Lao Tse, now embodied. He, in his outer mind, did
not know it, nor did I at the moment. All I knew of him was
that he was and IS a great spiritual being. This I knew by his
radiant aura.
As I do not wish to reveal the true identity of Lao Tse in his
outer embodiment I shall refer to Him henceforth as “that”
Lao Tse.
Lao Tse came to the bi-weekly classes thereafter. It was
after the third meeting he attended, however, that he asked me
to go to his home to stay with him for the night. I did. I do not re­
call the date but I do clearly recall what happened. That I could
never forget. I slept in the living room of the house down-stairs;
he slept in the east bedroom up-stairs. The next morning just
before I awoke I was conscious of Lao Tse in Spirit standing
beside my bed. I looked, and, instead of just seeing one of Him,
there were three of Him, each dressed in white robes and they
were gorgeously bedecked with jewels, too. There was one that
stood near. Off about three or four feet stood another, and off still
another such distance stood the third Lao Tse. The first seemed
to be much taller than the second, the second taller than the
third. The first was indeed quite a giant in size.
222
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Yes, Lao Tse talked to me quite at length. He gave me to
understand, speaking in a firm voice, that He understood all
laws of life; that He was a Master of Life, and He wished me
to assist His outer vehicle to make contact with the Masters in
His outer activity. It was most important to the world, He said,
that the OUTER MAN be initiated into the Great White
Brotherhood in its outer activity, too, so He could accomplish
for mankind what was needed to be done for the in-coming of
the Golden Age. At the time Lao Tse talked to me I must
admit I knew little about His individual philosophy—I mean the
ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tse. I learned much the weeks
that followed.
I was asked to come and live with Lao Tse; myself and two
older sons. We moved there. Lao Tse and I began to plan on
a radio program of a philosophical nature. In the meantime he
worked as he had for many years, doing odd jobs. He was and
is expert at all kinds of mechanical work such as electrical work,
carpentering, masonry, grading, or any type of work one may
think of. He is the first “Jack of all trades and MASTER OF
ALL” that I have ever seen. Every problem, I do believe, that
ever came before him, he has solved.
Each evening after dinner, Lao Tse and I would discuss the
teachings of the Masters. He, before I met him, so he told me,
had never heard of the Great Masters. And, another thing, he
did not believe in brotherhoods, lodges, clubs or anything that
made any show of power from the empiric standpoint. I spoke
to him of Maitreya, Root Hoomi, Sanat Kumara and others.
To him they were all unessential. Jesus, the one he believed in,
was sufficient for him, so he informed me. I tried my utmost to
get him to see that Jesus, too, was a member of the Great White
Lodge, and that every individual in this world, in order to
ascend, must be initiated into the Great Lodge. We must become
conscious of our ONENESS WITH GOD. “Order is heaven’s
first law,” I explained to him, “and God has that means of
directing his activities among his human creatures.” “As above,
so below.” For days we argued these principles. I went about
writing the program we expected to broadcast over KIRO in
Seattle, since I knew Mr. Quilliam, manager of that station,
having made his acquaintance in 1933 when I carried on a pro­
gram known as “Hood Canal’s Outdoor Philosopher” over
KJR. Mr. Quilliam was then commercial manager of KJR.

LORD MA I T R E Y A
I went to see Mr. Quilliam. He was interested. I prepared
the following opening program for him:
A M ESSAGE FROM VENUS
By Guru Amsumata
W ritten July 2, 1941.
Friends of K ............, and you listeners throughout the world :
W ill you kindly be quiet for just a few minutes? I have the most
important message to give you that the people of this world have ever been
able to hear. It is a message of peace and goodwill. It comes to you from
the Planet Venus. This may seem strange to you at first, but if you will
be real quiet for a few minutes, I am sure that strangeness will give way to
an amazing assurance of the truthfulness of my assertion. I am a messenger
from Venus, a Messenger of Sanat Kumara’s. Have you ears to hear?
Never before, in the history of the world, have people had the universal
understanding they now possess. Never before have people throughout the
world been so ready to sacrifice all they possess for UNIVERSAL PEACE.
Friends, it matters not whether j'ou actually think I come from Venus
or not—the message I have to give you— the service I am offering 3rou—-
this is what counts. Your acceptance of this will be worth millions and
millions of dollars to you, if you will but receive it. Money cannot buy the
treasured possession a M AN OF PEACE holds.
People of America, I bring to you a message of Peace from Venus. I
recall a message that came to you a few years ago from Mars— a message
of war and destruction that was marvelously enacted by one over the chan­
nels of your radio broadcasting fields. It was a fit of frenzy projected into
3rour country and the world by the potent spirit of the earth’s war lords.
They wanted to scare you into believing in war, the possibilities of war, the
necessity of preparing for war, as well as the need for creating hate among
the peoples of this world, so they could shove you into a world conflict.
You listened to the message from Mars. Now, will you kindly listen to
a message from Venus, known to the people of the earth as the Love Star.
Thank you, my dear friends, you shall indeed be blessed if you will listen
these few minutes, while I explain to you exactly how the United States may
maintain peace, and at the same time insure the protective power necessary
to see us through the next nine years, a period that may prove to be the most
devastating, yet the most uplifting epoch in the history of your world.
America, you are head and shoulders above any nation on earth in many
respects, but especially in freedom of thought and action are you the most
blessed. That freedom you now enjoy you must maintain, citizens of Amer­
ica. And now is the opportune time to expand that freedom, to prove to the
warring nations of the world that you are strong enough, broad-minded
enough, tolerant enough, to throw aside all narrowness of any sort and
224
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
proclaim to the whole wide world, your belief and understanding of the
Universal Brotherhood of Man, as the plan of God for your world.
Almost two thousand years ago we sent one of our Beloved Brothers
to your earth. He was known to the Western part of your world as Jesus
and is today recognized as the Christ; in the far eastern part of your world
He was known by a different name, yet He was the same Spirit. During
His short ministry on earth Jesus attracted to himself many followers of
all the leading churches and sects of His time. Almost none of the leaders,
however, of that time, understood Jesus. I dare say there was but one of
His own disciples who understood Him. That was Saint John the Beloved.
The record he, John, left, of the sermons of Jesus and His wonderful life,
are evidence that John did thoroughly understand Jesus and His teaching.
And I, your Messenger from Venus, have had evidence presented to me that
John also ascended soon after Jesus ascended.
Your Great Savior, Jesus, is recorded to have said, “If I be lifted up
I shall draw all men unto me.” Do you believe that? Ido. He meant that
you and everyone who may believe Him, and follow His simple command­
ments, may have life everlasting as He has it today. And I happen to know
that He has proved Himself to many people upon this earth in recent years.
There are many, I find, who have had Jesus speak to them of His life and
mission on earth. Of course they do not tell everybody about it. They do
not like to be made fun o f; however, I have talked to people of all the better
known religions of your world, and I find many people of great spirituality.
I find many GREAT ONES who do not even profess any particular reli­
gious belief. They believe in a Universal Brotherhood of man. They wonder
why you people of earth continue, after all these years, to separate yourselves
into groups, fighting each other, as it were, yet you all claim the same
Savior. I wonder at this myself.
I happen to know, dear friends, that there are about sixty per cent of
the people of the United States who have enough real love and understand­
ing of Christ that they have risen above sectarianism. There are thousands
in the Catholic religion, the Methodist religion, the Presbyterian religion,
the Jewish religion, the long-haired religion and the shaved-headed religion,
and all the hundreds of religions of the entire earth world, who believe in
the same Christ, experience the love of the same Christ, and know there is
but ONE UN IVERSAL LOVE manifest throughout this world and all
worlds and realms of being.
Now, my beloved Friends, that is why this message is so very important
to you people of the earth. I have come to call all you real honest-to-goodness
believers together. That is to be your salvation from destruction in a world
conflict. Is this hard to understand? Now, you can continue to fight over
little insignificant passages of your Bible, you can continue to stand apart
and battle over “W ho’s W ho Among the Churches,” or you can actually
come together in truth and in love, just as Jesus wants you to, and win the
greatest battle that was ever staged on earth. That is what Jesus wanted
225
LORD MAI TREYA
the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and all the sects of His time to do. They
were so proud of themselves and their material churches they crucified Him
instead. They did not want love in this world, for it would deprive them
of their high places in their particular organization. The same thing exists
today. People become insane with power. Power begets selfishness. Selfish­
ness keeps the world in the same old ruts it has been in for centuries. A t
the present time the world has an opportunity to throw off that old garment
of selfishness. Who has most to do with keeping that old worn-out garment
on the necks of the people as a burdensome yoke ? The great leaders of our
religions, philosophies, universities, industries, channels of commerce,
societies, and all the groups of the world. But I speak especially to the
leaders of America. Awake to the golden opportunity you have at this time
—this moment. This is the time when the people of Light must rally
together if you are to be saved from the darkness and destruction of the
conniving forces of evil. This is the sifting time. N o longer can the forces
of darkness hide behind honeyed words and phrases, and go on blindly lead­
ing the blind. I call to the leaders of America—the leaders of all walks of
life, industry, religion, education, science, philosophy— you must come out
of your shells and proclaim yourselves above narrow religious barriers,
shallow individual philosophies, and grip the hand of science, and therefore
prove to a peace-hungry world, that there is a Great God, A UNIVERSAL
FATHER, whose “Life, Light and Love” W E ARE, in wondrous beau­
tiful manifestation. You “live and move and have your being IN H IM .”
No, friends, I do not have any preference when it comes to religion or
philosophy. I do not but BELIEVE Christ. I K N O W HIM. He is
above any particular religious belief. He blesses all who believe in Him, no
matter what church they belong to. How could He be otherwise? Now,
doesn’t it seem foolish, how some people look upon their religion? W hat
I would like to see is this: T H A T ALL RELIGIONS, NO M ATTER
W H A T THEIR NAM E OR BELIEF, SEEK TO KN O W , W IT H IN
THEIR OW N HEARTS, W H O CH RIST IS. Wouldn’t that be won­
derful? And wouldn’t it be wonderful, too, if all those who have found
Him in their hearts, could gather together in one great congregation— one
vast audience of people of the Universal Understanding? Even the East
and the West shall meet in that splendid audience.
In thy very soul, America, is the power to shake yourself free from the
barnacles of selfishness! The unawakened ones who have created that
selfishness shall flee from the dawn of this New Day—the LIG H T OF
GOD. The “Sword of Truth and Light” has ripped the sinister net of
darkness open from end to end— from East to West— from North to South.
Freedom of thought and action shall soon, for the first time, encircle our
world, IN THE LIGH T, LOVE, W ISD O M and POW ER of A L ­
M IG H T Y GOD.
Again I call to all beings of Light: “A ll Lights must come under the
One Great Light.” Those who oppose me in this declaration can be classed
226
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
with the forces of darkness. Those who are not for me are against me.
Those who do not declare themselves for Christ and His Light are opposed
to Him. Those who do not put aside all selfishness at this time and declare
themselves for TRU TH , FOR JU ST IC E AND FOR THE INDE­
PENDENCE OF THE AM ERICAS AND THEIR FREEDOM
FROM A LL ENTAN GLIN G ALLIANCES ABROAD, will be
declaring themselves with the forces of darkness and destruction. Should
you declare yourselves for LIG H T and T RU T H you will thus generate
such power, such a masterful intelligence, such a mass ascension of the
people of America, that we shall remain invincible in the face of any trials
that may beset us in the coming years, no matter how trying they may be.
Again I call to all the Brothers of Light throughout the world and through­
out all realms of being: ALL LIGH TS U N ITED ! A LL LIGH TS
U N IT E D ! M A Y THE EAST AND THE W E ST UNITE, AND
L IF T THE EARTH W O R LD INTO ITS R IG H TFU L SPHERE
OF LIGH T, LOVE, W ISD O M AND PO W E R !
Before I return to Venus, Beloved Friends of Earth, may I remind you
people of America, there are a number of beings on earth at the present
time, who, no doubt, were sent into your earthly sphere as Messengers of
Love to assist you to free yourselves from the awful scourge of selfishness,
that has so enthralled your world ? And then, after the Light has dissolved
all selfishness and greed from the earth, THE GOLDEN AGE W IL L
COME, in its full glory, and nobody will lack anything, and all shall enjoy
peace and happiness throughout this world.
I am very thankful that you have seen fit to listen these few minutes to
the first of such programs ever broadcast in America. I shall look forward
to speaking to you again soon, for I am certain you will have many ques­
tions to ask regarding the approaching Golden Age.
Good evening to you, and may the Light of God abide with you always,
protecting you and guiding you eternally. Good evening.

THE STARS OF QUALITIES
Beloved Student, each Master has His individual Quality
just as each Star in the Heavens radiates forth its Celestial
Influence. Look for your individual star in the firmaments. But
until you know your own star and the Quality you may be asked
to radiate to humanity, pray to the Gods who reign in His King­
dom above you. I shall tell you how to pray. Listen to MY
WORDS. May they be remembered and acted upon:
Until you are master yourself you must depend upon and
call for the reflected radiance of another. “Mount Zion” is in
the top of your head. A Master blazes forth His Quality from
227
LORD MAI TREYA
His forehead. It is discernable to those who see with the “open
eye.” Even though you may not see it, you will feel it when you
call feelingly for it.
It may be that you need “Faith”—Greater Faith. Call to
the Lord of Faith. You may need courage—Call to the Lord of
Courage. Even should you feel the need of Purity—call to the
Goddess of Purity. Maitreya is the Lord of Love. Koot Hoomi
and Amsumata are Lords of Wisdom. Morya and Elijah are
Lords of Power. Every quality in nature, in human nature, in
Super-Men and Gods, is in charge of its respective Lord.
When you pray or decree—after you have become wholly
harmonious with the Lord of Love—visualize over and above
your head a radiant dome in which are numberless Golden Doors.
Each door represents and IS the portal into the Individual
Temple of the Lords of Qualities.
When you call to the Goddess of Mercy, Her door opens to
flood you with Her radiance. When you call to Lord Maitreya,
His DOOR TO LOVE is opened to bathe you in His Light and
Love. Remember the DOOR, Beloved.
228
CHAPTER XXX
M Y JE W E L ’S D ELIGH T
Light of my life, I love you;
Breath of my Soul art Thou ;
Sweeter than dews of the morning—
Precious jewels adorning Her brow,
Brighter than sunshine at noonday
Filling the earth with her glow,
Purer than Shasta’s clear waters
As out from the mountain they flow.
Thou art my Soul’s deepest yearning,
Pulse-beat of sorrow art Thou.
Thou art the satisfied longing
Enfolding my Spirit just now;
Thou art the Peace of surrender;
Still is Thy voice as the night,
But it spoke to my Soul in the darkness
A message translucent with Light.
Light of my life, I adore Thee ;
Light of life, Thou art mine.
I have plunged in the sea of surrender;
Light of my life, I A M Thine.
(Dedicated to Joshua.) — L-T.

Just when Lao Tse and I were prepared to start our radio
program, and just when he was becoming fully awakened to his
Higher Presence through instruction I had seen fit to give him,
Ave Maria and my little daughter arrived on the scene. Lao Tse
had dedicated his home and all his property to the use of Jesus
Christ and His disciples some time before I knew him. He had
told me before Ave Maria’s coming that the place was to be
considered a Retreat where the Brothers of Light could assem­
ble, visit with each other and live there as long as they wished.
229
LORD MAI TREYA
Lord Maitreya had told Ave Maria to go to Seattle to assist
me in initiating our newly-found ancient philosopher. I had
spoken to Lao Tse many times of Ave Maria. She had been
informed through Mahatma Koot Hoomi and Lord Maitreya
just who this strange student of life really IS. She drew me
aside after she had been there a few days and said, “We have
here a great philosopher. Do you know who he is?”
“No, I do not,” I replied. “All I know is that he is a Great
One. I saw three of his Higher Bodies, and I know he has
attained Mastery in other embodiments previous to this.”
“I shall tell you who he is,” Ave Maria spoke in a low tone.
“He is no other than the great Chinese Philosopher, Lao Tse,
founder of the religion of Taoism. We must, without fail, initi­
ate him into the Great White Brotherhood in the outer activity.
Lord Maitreya sent me here for that purpose.”
“That accounts for an unusual experience I had in Mt.
Shasta last December,” I explained to Ave Maria. “I was sleep­
ing in a room adjoining the room in which my son, Norman, was
sleeping. In the middle of the night a voice spoke through his
body in a whisper so loud that I distinctly heard it in my room.
I chanced to be awake. That voice said, in a most emphatic way,
‘YOU MUST FIND TAO.’ Now I see what was meant. Here
I was led to Lao Tse, founder of Tao, now embodied to assist
us in the Great Work of the Light of Christ. How wonderful.
I now see how the Great Masters are working with us, and how
all the Great Ones are really embodied at this time for the
Golden Age.”
“This is the age,” she went on to explain, “when all the great
religions and philosophies are to be brought together, simplified,
and explained so that all peoples of the world shall know we
MUST have WORLD PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING.
Lao Tse is one of those Great Leaders of the past now embodied
to help us. You and I, too, as you know, have worked for the
freedom and understanding of mankind down through the ages.
Lao Tse, in His Higher Bodies, has an inner Retreat in the
Mountain of Fujiyama in Japan. There He initiates His devotees
into the higher Mysteries of Life, however, we must initiate this
outer man, the physical temple Lao Tse is now using, into the
Brotherhood of Mt. Shasta. It will take time before he will be
able to bring through to his outer consciousness the full realiza­
tion of what it’s all about, but that is our work for the present.”
230
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Friends of Understanding, it did not take as long to bring
our Brother Lao Tse “through” as might have been expected.
Truly I know him to be one of the very wisest men on earth. I
could write a great book about his experiences in this one embodi­
ment. The sufferings that body endured, the sorrows that mind
experienced, and the physical “crucifixion” by which he was tried,
would make wonderful materials for a drama unsurpassed in
realistic, heart-rending human activity. He, for instance, spent
years in an insane asylum where at one time he was strangled
into insensibility or unconsciousness seventeen times by a warden
without provocation. By the seventeenth time he was choked
Christ appeared to him and spoke to him thus: “You must stay
in thè body this time, for we need you here.” He told me he was
at the point where he cared not to live, but after the vision, his
tormentor quit and he recovered his strength. I shall not mention
the name of the asylum where this took place (even though I
can), but I shall mention the name of the warden, for it is so
significant. His name was “Black.”
Lao Tse told me how, during all his physical trials, over a
long period of time, his own God Presence directed him, guided
him and finally led him to me and Ave Maria, where he was so
thankful to us for the blessings he then received from Koot
Hoomi, Lord Maitreya, Buddha Gautama and others of the
Great Ones. I regret I have not the time to enlarge upon this
phase of my initiatory work.
Within two weeks’ time Lao Tse ascended. He became con­
scious of his Higher Self—His “I AM” Presence, and I am not
exaggerating when I say he could just as easily talk Chinese and
other ancient languages as he could English, his native tongue in
this embodiment. This would all take place when the Individual
Spirits of his life-stream came in his body, of all of which he was
conscious. After he had attained certain degrees of initiation he
went with Ave Maria to Mt. Shasta, where he received additional
degrees through Koot Hoomi and other Masters. It was dur­
ing the latter part of July and the first part of August that Lao
Tse received his instructions from Ave Maria, Koot Hoomi,
other Masters and myself. I think each of us did our part in the
Great Work for him and I believe we learned, or at least con­
firmed many of the Great Truths through Him.
It was while we were working with Lao Tse at his little
retreat and even before then that I had carried on quite a cor­
respondence with a teacher of the Great Work in Los Angeles
231
LORD MAI TREYA
known as Ratana. She had directed the “I AM” Temple there
during the time when Mr. Ballard was active In the “I AM”
activity, and was one of their staunch supporters until Mrs.
Ballard and her devotees came up for trial in the U. S. Court,
when Ratana failed to stand by Mrs. Ballard. It was after I
had carried on a lengthy correspondence with Ratana regarding
her new activity and my own individual teaching that I invited
her and her secretary, Stanley Conrad, to visit our retreat near
Seattle.
Lady Ratana had called to me to assist her in some way to
protect her from the overpowering manner in which Mrs. Bal­
lard seemed to oppose her in the inner realms. This I did through
the assistance of Mahatma Koot Hoomi. I wrote to Ratana,
told her how she might protect herself and her students. She
wrote to me thanking me for the marvelous spiritual protection.
Later she and Stanley came to my retreat near Seattle. They
arrived just two days after Ave Maria and Lao Tse left for
Mt. Shasta. Circumstances compel me to publish herewith a
small part of the correspondence I carried on with Ratana, since
all things must be revealed to prevent certain Blacks from hinder­
ing Ratana as well as myself and others. They must know they
are not dealing with falsehoods nor weaklings, but Masters and
Members of the Great White Lodge. Following is a letter I
wrote to Ratana the day following her departure from the
Seattle Retreat:
Seattle, Wash.
Beloved Ratana: Aug. 24, 1941.
I had such a marvelous revelation through the spirit—the Great Omni­
presence— last night, I do hope I can bring it through clearly enough that
it might conyey some important angle of this Divine Principle to you for
your use in teaching your students.
I saw Jesus and Buddha— BOTH IN ONE PRESENCE—and He
came forth in ONE PERSON to bring PEACE to our divided world. I
sat near this Divine Representative, knowing that I A M a Brother of that
Personification of God, while all about us—but some distance from us—
were millions of people, who were acknowledging HIS CO M IN G—
CH RIST IN HIM. However, I knew in my consciousness that I A M the
ONE to bring the Great Message to the outer world, and even though I
approached near to that other ONE—Jesus and Buddha in ONE, He did
not seem to know that I A M the one having been prepared to bring THE
M ESSAGE to the outer world and expound the Higher Mysteries to the
232
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
people. Yet, I know this is to be SOON. You understand, Ratana, this I
knew in my consciousness while in that other body, sitting there listening
to Him. * * * The Spirit is Omnipresent, Omniscient, and Omnipotent,
as you know. God, to the outer consciousness to any individual, no matter
how high or low he may be, is DEEP M YSTER Y. W e must ever trust
in H IM —GO D — the ALL-FATH ER—ALL-M OTH ER— the EVER­
PRESENT—ALL-PERSON. W e are— it is true—all Children of God
— but the important thing in our individual activity, is to become fully aware
of OUR SONSHIP and K N O W H IM COM PLETELY— BECOME
ONE W IT H H IM IN THE G R E A T S P I R I T .
Strange, Ratana, but I feel that I have not begun to approach the prin­
ciple as I expected to when I experienced the great uplift I received some­
time during last night. As it came to me it was a wonderful POEM —
beautiful, rhythmical, ecstatic, blissful, all-comprehensive, inspirational and
infinitesimal, but NOW , I feel so incapable of giving you even a small taste
of it. Isn’t the physical octave dense?
Please do not overlook the aspects of LOVE in the Physical Octave.
Generation— regeneration— Christ. The Spirit is potent. W e must be
potent to be active. W e must be energetic to do things in this world. W e
must conserve our forces for good thoughts and action. Yet, we dare not be
afraid to make proper use of our forces, knowing that “whatsoever we do we
do to the G LO R Y OF GO D .” Even in the midst of personal love and
affection, TH IN K OF CH RIST AND D R A W A L L FRO M THE
THREE LO W E R BODIES— ONCE T RAN SM U TED — UP INTO
YO U R HIGHER OR GOD PRESENCE. This is regeneration. To
accomplish regeneration we must have something to regenerate.
Never condemn yourself for anything that might happen in your life
or activity when trying to do the best you know. No master would ever
condemn you. Masters do not see faults in you. They see perfection in you
— ONLY PERFECTION. FEAR NOT to do what you feel within your
own consciousness is efficacious to you and the G R EAT W O R K .
REM EM BER: YO U ARE M ASTER. You do not have to say to your
students, “I A M A M AST ER ,” but you can say “I A M M AST E R .”
When you are master of yourself, your mastery is attained—you ARE
M ASTER. Assert your Master}'. “I A M M ASTER OF...........................
JO Y O U SL Y AND G LAD LY DO M Y W IL L .” * * * (Private
instruction.)
I must try again to express:
’Tis love in this world—yes, love uplifted, transmuted, regenerated,
that brings Divine Love to the human octave. How else can the Gods work
here? W hat is it that prevents us—we of the New Kingdom—saying to
each other, “I LOVE YO U. I LOVE Y O U ” ? Read Shakespeare. He
knew. Those who, in their shriveled minds, see but beastly lust in human
love, are but weak children, just beginning to learn Divine Love’s lessons in
233
LORD MA1 TREYA
regeneration. W hy did William Shakespeare (Bacon?), in “Venus and
Adonis,” write verse after verse, page after page, words, words, words, of
inspiration, in simply telling how a GODDESS craved a single kiss—a
token— a symbol, at least, of DIVINE LOVE? And he, Adonis, the longer
he tarried, the more he regenerated the forces in his body into the essence
of Divine Love— for his mind did dwell in the heights, though, perchance,
he did not perceive it. And she, Venus, who might have been the Goddess
of Love, did have for her aspiration, a precious flower, which she placed
in her Heart as a symbol and representation of HIS perfection.
Oh, that human beings might ascend into the higher, heavenly realms
of Divine Love—in Consciousness, at least, is my prayer, my decree. And
may the call to the Lord of Love and the Goddess of Love reveal to them­
selves the great Love of the Universal Christ. The Spirit of Love is the
Beautiful Cloud upon which the Lord of Love and the Goddess of Love
sail upon— the Ethereal Ocean—when they come to visit us in our now-
small world which now expands into the Golden Sphere of Love. “I see
and recognize only the W H ITE-N ATU RE IN ALL A C T IV IT Y on
earth.” LOVE reigns supreme in the minds and hearts of all mankind.
The Lord of Love sits on His Golden Throne in M Y H EART and
YOURS. His Light radiates out to YO U and ALL through all realms
of being.
And still I must confess I cannot convey the rapture that so enthralled
me and caused me to attempt to write to you something of the Mystery of
my experience last night. Time will tell.
As to coming to Los Angeles, I have not yet heard from my sister, but
did get a letter from Brother J ............. He has turned the Retreat here
over to me, but said he knew, just as Ave Maria does, that I have to go
forth to the outer world with my message. He told me how he had arranged
with a neighbor here of his to take care of Anne. So you see they, the
Masters, have been doing some planning on the other end of the line. See?
Frankly, Anne is a problem to me in the outer. . . . so, you see, I feel
that Anne will have to be with me in Los Angeles, eventually. Maybe you
have a suggestion in this regard. I have no secrets regarding the matter.
I am most frank and open to you, Ratana. You know this, I am sure.
W ill you kindly write to me at your earliest convenience. You know,
of course, I send you my Love and I radiate my Light to you and Stanley,
and ask that Our Lord enfold you and all your blessed students in His
Magic Presence.
In Divine Love.

THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I received the following letter from Ratana:
TEM PLE OF CH RIST
123 North Lake Street
Los Angeles, Calif.
Aug. 27th, 1941.
Our Beloved Amsumata:
I have been trying to get a chance to write to you ever since we left you.
This is the very first time I have been able to do so, for I have been so very
busy. I found many good reasons why I should have come home, and real­
ized why I felt I must do so. W e had our first meeting at the Temple last
evening, and we had a good attendance. Some of the Ballard students were
there, to carry the report, I guess. I hope they got their eyes open!
Oh, Blessed One, we can never thank you enough for all you have done
for us! Those few days in Your Retreat were priceless! And that was just
the beginning! You opened the door to us for all that has followed, and
we are eternally grateful! (ETERN ALLY.)
W e were only a short distance on our way when marvelous things began
to take place, and our whole trip home was a trip thru the wonders of the
Cosmic Realms! I would love to tell you about it, but do not feel like
writing it. W e arrived home Monday night between 10 and 11 P.M . And
was Bobby and Elizabeth happy to see us! They had sat in the porch swing
all evening, waiting for us. Of course we found many things awaiting our
attention, but found everything in very good order. That wonderful loyal
group at the Temple were starry eyed with love and joy, in gratitude for
the wonderful messages in the letters I had sent to them. (From Amsumata’s
Retreat.)
I wonder if you can guess how grateful and glad I was to find your
wonderful letter awaiting us, when we arrived home! It was so very
W E L C O M E ! I feel that I get the idea of your glorious experience, and
have felt that you are the ONE to bring forth that Message! Yes, I feel
that you have gotten over to me the Message you desired to, the Message
of your experience. And I, too, feel that you are right. I feel that you are
the One to carry that Message to the world. Oh, Blessed Amsumata, you
were so patient with us, you were so kind to us, you were so wise with us!
I was grateful that I had the insight to see what you were doing, and why
you did things as you did! I feel it is all clear to me, and it was you who
took Stanley and I both thru, for Stanley won thru just three days after
I did.
I had a wonderful experience at Mt. Shasta, but did not see J .............
W e made the calls just as you said, but I felt from the first that we would
not see her there. I felt that you were the one chosen to take us thru, and
that to meet her (Ave Maria) so soon after my marvelous experiences just
after leaving your Retreat, and also the glorious one with you and Anoma
before we left, I felt that to meet her would perhaps change the vibration,
235
LORD MAI T REYA
and perhaps cause confusion, at that time. Each one works differently, and
you had done all the hard work with us. When the right time comes we
will be so happy to meet her. But I leave everything in the hands of the
GREAT ONES, oh, so Gladly. I have no desire to push things. A LL
TH INGS IN DIVINE ORDER!
I feel that something wonderful is right ahead for the GREAT W O R K .
I feel all uplifted and almost breathlessly waiting for SO M ETH IN G !
You and Saint Germain came together to me the last night we were in
M t. Shasta. Both of you showed me how you are both One, in a very
interesting manner. Then you left, and He talked to me a very long time
about the IM PO RTAN CE of the physical body. He plead with me to
assist Him in clearing up all the false things that have gone out about Him
and the Great W ork. I do desire to do all that I possibly can to assist you
both in every way I can in the GREAT W O R K OF THE ASCENDED
M ASTERS.
I believe that I will tell you now, that shortly after we left your Retreat,
the W hite Dove lighted on my head, and I was illumined! The Blessed
Lord Maitreya rode with us all the rest of that day. A little later we were
riding through an avenue of great pine trees, and they bowed across the
road to me, joining together forming an archway, reminding me of pictures
I have seen where swords were held in that manner for someone to pass
thru. The Maha Chohan rode with us the second day, Krishna the Beloved
the third day, Jesus was with us all during the fifth day. The instruction
we received from each one was transcendent! Oh, those wonderful
two weeks!
W e have the use of the big house until around November. There we
can have room for both you and Anne. They have already started fore­
closure proceedings to take the house back. I refer to the bank. W e would
be happy to have you and Anne come to us, and share with us what we have,
even as you shared with us, so lovingly and graciously what you have. I
still have hope that something will turn up that will give us the use of the
home for a Great White Brotherhood Retreat. But that, too, is in the hands
of the Great Ones.
How would you come? If you will let me know at once just what it
would cost to get you and Anne to Los Angeles, I will be glad to see if I
can find some way to take care of that. Perhaps the people who were going
to take Anne, would be glad to look after the precious boys until your sister
comes, so that you would not have to wait. I would not feel right to leave
Anne; she should be with you. She is so precious, I would love to have her
come with you to see us. Perhaps that sounds egotistical, when I say “to
see us,” when I know how all your time is in the Great Work, but I really
mean when you come here so that the Great W ork can go on in a bigger
way than it is at the present. W e will feel honored with your Presence
with us. It is hard to make words express what we desire to say, isn’t it?
But I feel that you will understand me and my intentions.
236
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
W ill you please give my love and blessings to the boys, and to our
darling Anne? Stanley joins me in deepest love and gratitude to you. I
trust that you have received all the love and gratitude we have sent con­
stantly to you. W e love and bless you always! Enclosed please find a tiny
Love Gift to sort of help out there. May it be increased a millionfold to
each one of you. May every desire of your hearts be fulfilled. In deepest
gratitude, I ask all the Great Ones to Bless you with every Good forever.
I am,
Ever in service to Lord Maitreya, the Maha Chohan,
Beloved Jesus and ALL THE GREAT ONES,
(Signed) R A T A N A.
P.S. on back of letter: Amsumata: GREETIN GS! I understand a
great deal more now, and I am grateful to Amsumata and Norman. And I
think Norman is a jolly good fellow. I love you and bless you forever.

While writing an answer to Ratana’s letter above Ave Maria
and Lao Tse returned from Mt. Shasta to the Retreat at Seattle.
They walked into the room where I was writing the letter,
announcing that they were told by Lord Maitreya and Mahatma
Root Hoomi to return to Seattle so I could be released to go
south to Los Angeles. I did not know they even knew what had
gone on at the Retreat, however, Ave Maria knew all that had
gone on, and was ready to cooperate with me in getting the Great
Message to the world.
Ratana had been initiated into the Great White Lodge. She
is remarkably clairvoyant, therefore she could bring all through
just as Ave Maria generally does. In the New Age many women
shall become Masters, for it will be the age for the ascension of
WOMANHOOD.
I shall not quote herewith but a paragraph or two of the
letter I wrote to Ratana, regarding our leaving for Los Angeles,
but we, Anne and I, got busy immediately preparing for the trip
south. Lao Tse provided me with money enough to get to Los
Angeles.
I quote from my letter to her :
Seattle, Wash.
Beloved Ratana: Aug. 30, 1941.
Blessed Sister of the G.W .L., the M : Thou who art ascended into His
Glory, Lord of Lords Maitreya’s, Christ’s: Thou who art in communion
with the Great Ones in the GREAT W O R K : Thou who art ever blessed
237
LORD MAI TREYA
with the LIGH T of the Living, the Love, Wisdom and Power of God
Almighty (Actually, in T RU T H and Sincerity) :
G R EE TIN G S:
Again I weep tears of GREAT JO Y ! W hat is more wonderful? Yes,
W hat? Than tears of joy? Tears of Joy, overflowing from a heart made
most happy with written words of LIFE, of TRU TH , of W ISD O M —
words in SPIRIT, in MIND, in musical SOUND, in beautiful W R IT ­
ING—words of PO W ER vibrating throughout the ethereal atmosphere
of earth, like a CO SM IC BELL ringing out a M ESSAGE OF LOVE
from Maitreya’s LOVE STAR. Now, my dear Ratana, you have every­
thing you need to GO FORTH a Living Example of the Great Work.
W H A T JO Y IS M IN E! To know that M y GREAT BROTHERS
OF LIG H T do cooperate with me, the newly initiated ONE, in carrying
you T H R U so marvelously. I weep over your letter, I read and weep;
read and weep with joy. It seems that my heart will burst for you, Stanley,
all your students, and ALL THE W O RLD . And, strange, I want to
exclaim to my Brothers of L O V E : To think that such a wretch as I should
be so blessed with such Love and cooperation, and yet, I know that every
wrong I ever did in my life was done SEEKING TRU TH , T RYIN G
ALL THINGS, AS Paul said, AND HOLDING FAST TO T H A T
W H ICH IS GOOD. It has been my fearlessness that ever saw me
through. “Fear not. I am with you always.”
Just as soon as I hear from you I will be leaving. I will walk over to
the post office to mail this AIR M A IL so you will get it immediately.
God bless you all. Say to your students: “Lord Maitreya, the Great
Divine Director, sends you his Light and Love, and Joshua, the Goddess
of Love says: ‘I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YO U, I LOVE Y O U ’.”
Sincerely in the service of the Masters.
I am as ever,
A M SU M A T A .
* * *
Instead of waiting for word from Ratana, Lao Tse and Ave
Maria, knowing how urgent Koot Hoomi and Lord Maitreya
and Saint Germain were to get me started in the work I had to
do in the Los Angeles sector, Anne and I left the next day for
Los Angeles.
Ratana had promised me that she would assist me in getting
my book published. Without money, having the children to look
after, and trying to write a book in peace and harmony, is no
little task to accomplish, therefore, she had told me she would
238
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
gladly allow me to live there at her home until I got the book
written and published.
We arrived and were comfortably quartered in the beauti­
ful home of Ratana’s. She had told me how Saint Germain had
appeared to her some years previous, advising her to purchase
that magnificent home. Now, Saint Germain is to live in it with
his daughter, along with Ratana, Stanley and Bobby.
All would have been very nice. Love might have been the
ruling principle in all things that followed, had all been Masters
of Love. Anne was most happy. She started to school. I started
to work on the book. The “Black” forces began to commence
to get ready to get started to “breaking up” our peaceful plans.
Every single individual was put through the “fire.” For four or
five days I felt invading and destructive vibrations. I knew well
enough where they were, but hoped they would be “mastered”
by those who were being tried.
At last all came to the surface. Ratana and Stanley wanted
to talk to me down in the drawing room. Ratana seemed wor­
ried. When we had all been quietly seated she said, “Amsumata,
you are being investigated.”
“Is that so?” I exclaimed, as though I were quite disturbed
about it all. “Well, that is perfectly all right with me. I welcome
investigation, and I am certain whoever investigates me WILL
be investigated most thoroughly.”
“Yes,” Stanley spoke up, “the Government is investigating
you.”
“No, Stanley,” remarked Ratana, “it’s the Great White
Brotherhood.”
Well, I thought, there is quite a difference already in the
opinion of the two as to who is investigating me. Without fur­
ther questioning, I abruptly asked, “When do you wish me to
move?” I then added, “Now, Ratana, so far as any investiga­
tion is concerned, I am absolutely unafraid. I have nothing to
fear. I have never done anything for which I should fear. I
realize the position you are placed in regarding my being here.
For several days I had thought I should suggest my going else­
where to live, for I sensed all this. You prefer to believe others
than to believe me. I am sure it will be better for all of us were
we separate in our activities. You and Stanley have your ideas
about teaching, etc., which I realize you must maintain. I am
one who has my own individual plan and ideas of teaching. I
239
LORD MAI TREYA
know it is too much of a test for some of you with me here. I
shall look about for a place in which to live.”
“Well, you take plenty of time to look about for a little
apartment. There is no hurry,” advised Stanley.
I had been attending the meetings in the Temple of Christ
with Anne. We enjoyed going very much, but due to jealousy of
some of the students, who, of course made remarks to Ratana,
it disturbed her and Stanley. They did not know I was the outer
presence of Saint Germain. They did not realize that I held the
important office I hold in the Great Work of the White Lodge.
Jealousy is a terrible disease. There was one member of her
group who claimed unusual powers and membership in the Great
Lodge. He, Stanley and others all brought their influences to
bear upon Ratana, whom I know to be an Initiate of the Brother­
hood. I do not blame her in the least. I ask Lord Maitreya and
all the Masters of Light to assist her and free her from every
interference, and I know now, that the evil, jealous ones knowing
they are found out, SHE WILL BE FREED. GOD BLESS
RATANA.
I explained to Ratana and Stanley that I would soon receive
help from some other members of the Great Lodge. I wrote
immediately to one in the North who is a high official of the
Universal Brotherhood. Through him and others I was directed
here to Mount Olympus, “A Mountain of God,” where the
book is now almost finished, and where I have been loved and
assisted by REAL BROTHERS OF LOVE WHO WERE
ABLE TO STAND THE TESTS THROUGH WHICH
ALL MUST PASS TO PROVE THEIR MASTERY.
There is one phase of the Great Work I feel I should explain
here for the benefit of those who might some day chance to be
in a similar predicament wherein Ratana and Stanley were
tested. Even after we have been initiated into the Higher Degrees
of the Great Lodge, so to speak, is when our greatest tests are
sure to come. Even after one might be acclaimed a Master, and
has been so informed by his or her master-teacher, THEN IS
WHEN ONE IS PLACED ON PROBATION. It is then that
all eyes of the Great Lodge (ALL-SEEING EYE) are turned
upon the new initiate. If there be the least weakness any­
where in the “armour of righteousness” of the initiate, it will
CERTAINLY be found. Then it isn’t what you may think is
RIGHT, but it is WHAT and WHO YOU ARE that counts.
240
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
As Lord Maitreya once said to me, “Eventually every soul shall
be saved.”
Lord Maitreya also said to me, as I have previously stated,
“I do not allow my Priests to make mistakes.” I know that
regarding initiations and such matters as above related, Loid
Maitreya always directs me and is WITH ME. Until the outer
mind is “slain,” “The Son of Man hath not any place to lay
His head.” But He has the blessings of the “birds” who are
the true Messengers of God.
241
CHAPTER XXXI
On August 31, 1941, just a day or two before I left Seattle
for Los Angeles, Buddha Gautama came to me to bestow His
Great Blessing upon me. He addressed me as, “Petetera,” or
“Peter,” as He explained, “Keeper of the Door of the Great
Presence. It was at 1:15 P.M., as I have indicated in my notes.
He made the sign and salutation of the Masters, announced
His name, “Gautama Buddha!”
He then addressed me, which I did not understand for the
moment, as “The Portal!” Then He said, “Maitreya, Keeper
of the Portal or Great Presence of Buddha, you should say, in
explaining your office, ‘I am the Open Door that no man can
shut.’ I serve Gautama. Gautama place me.”
Buddha Gautama then went on to explain, “No one enters in
to the Great Lord Presence except the Great Disciple of that
paiticulai Lord who is the Portal to this Great Presence permits
them to pass through this Portal which He IS.” He added,
“Refer to Jesus, ‘No one comes to the Father but through me.’ ”
Beloved Students, I did not, for some time realize what was
being conferred upon me, and, I am frank to say, even yet I
probably do not fully realize the great responsibility that was
being placed upon my shoulders at that very moment. Somehow
I had, within myself, felt many times in recent months, that
such honor and responsibility had been placed upon me in the
Great White Lodge. Ave Maria, the most wonderful being on
earth, I do believe, explained it to me after Buddha had gone.
Maitreya was the name of Buddha Gautama’s most beloved
disciple, just as John was the Most Beloved Disciple of Jesus.
I, in this present embodiment and this generation, have been
chosen as the most beloved disciple of Christ who is now incar­
nate in this earth. THE GODS ARE WITH US ONCE
MORE.
Latei in the day Ave Maria sent the following message,
written in long-hand to me. My little daughter brought it from
upstairs and handed it to me:
242
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
“To Amsumata:
“Gentleness is become desirous of the Fires (Father’s) property,
and the desires draw the Gentleness of the Kingdom of LOVE into
itself.
“That (Gentleness) is the W ater of Eternal Life, which the Fire
(Father) drinks, and gives therefrom the Light of Majesty.
“This is the answer or rather interpretation of your letter. It was
accomplished through the Mahatmah, the Great Mahatmah.
“AN O M A.”
P.S.— “The above is the thought of one of Theosophical thought,
and I but applied it. Anoma.”
“I just received a message through one of the Great White Lodge,
that I am granted the title which Buddha Gautama had, ‘Anoma.’
“AN O M A.”
So, Those of You “who have ears to hear,” and “eyes to
see,” there is a mystery worth solving in the above. May I ever
be true to the Great Ones to whom I am obligated. And may
all who have claimed to be true to me, and have vowed their
faithfulness, be true to me, for IN TRUTH AND LIGHT
WE GO FORWARD WITH GOD’S MESSAGE OF THE
NEW GOLDEN AGE. Christ is incarnate, as well as His Most
Beloved Disciple.
On the same day that Buddha Gautama came to bless me and
take me into His Great Solar Ring, Mahatma Root Hoomi
talked to me at length, explaining to me that “Now you have
the protection you have always wanted. You can now go forth in
the world with the Great Message for the people of this world.
The fields are heavy with ripe grain. This is the harvesting time.
Truly it is the harvest time. Have no fear, the Brothers of the
Great White Lodge will be at your side always.”
After leaving the home of Ratana in Los Angeles—but a day
or two thereafter—my two older sons arrived from Seattle. I was
without funds. I had written to two Brothers, explaining the
need of calling the members of the Lodge in the outer for a
convocation. There was so very much needed doing, however,
without money and three children suddenly placed entirely in
my care, I had to accept any kind of employment obtainable.
I accepted the job of janitor at the El Rey Hotel in East Los
Angeles. The work was hard and the pay small. I enjoyed the
work. I really worked too hard.
243
LORD MAI TREYA
Once while mopping the floor beneath the large rubber rug
in the main entrance of the hotel, Mahatmah Koot Hoomi stood
within a few feet of me in His tangible body for several minutes
watching me, blessing me and radiating His Light about me.
He walked back and forth in front of me several times and then
disappeared. He is about six feet two or three inches tall. I
acknowledged His Presence silently. We understood each other
without any outward signs or salutations.
As Students of Light ever be on guard. You never know
when the Master will approach you. And, too, you never know
just HOW He will approach you.
On Sept. 27, 1941, I received a communication from my
friend and Brother in the North, who gave me a card of intro­
duction to be mailed to an official of the Universal Brotherhood.
I, in turn, wrote the following letter to the Brother from the
Hotel El Rey:
Sept. 28, 1941.
M y dear Brother:
I enclose herewith a card of introduction to you from my old friend
and Brother (Sanskrit Name), who has felt it “fitting and proper” to place
me at your disposal, as I am most desirous to meet you and discuss certain
vital issues pertaining to the Great W ork of the G.W .B. in the Western
Hemisphere.
I am in close contact with the Great Mahatma Koot Hoomi (K H ),
and it is His desire (if I may venture such) to make necessary preparations
for His coming to U. S. (Physical) early next year. Moreya El may
accompany Him.
Please address me, should you see fit, (mail) to this hotel, as I am
working here at present,— Norman R. Westfall, El Rey Hotel, Los
Angeles, Calif.
There are other spiritual matters I much wish to talk over with you,
since, I understand, you are in a position to assist me. I feel, too, that I
can help you.
M y office, etc., regarding Great Work, we can discuss when we are
fortunate enough to meet personally.
I might inform you, Brother, that this is the first time I have sought
contact with any Brother other than by chance meeting, in 20 years instruc­
tion and training under the Masters, not to mention considerable sorrowing
discipline. I do pray that you grant me an interview. I assure you IN
THE NAM E OF LORD M AITREYA, you shall not regret it.
Fraternally yours,
A Servant in the Light,
A M SU M A T A .
244
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Two days later I met the new-found Brother at the hotel in
Los Angeles. In another week I was at .................., however, I
first went through a very trying physical test.
I had been told by Mahatmah Koot Hoomi some months
previous I would have to go through quite a painful adjustment
of my etheric body with my physical body due to the time I was
shot when embodied as Abraham Lincoln. He told me my etheric
body was still in need of healing as a result of the bullet that
penetrated my brain at that time. When Brother E.............met
me at the hotel the evening above mentioned he touched a spot
just behind my right ear where a considerable bump had risen.
I had an idea of the cause, and had for a number of years been
troubled by a condition at the base of my brain and in my neck.
The Brother held his finger right on that spot for several
minutes. There was a cold shiver went through my body as
though I had an ague chill. Before I left the hotel that evening
I was almost unable to sit up. I told him nothing of my feelings.
It was all I could do to get home that evening. I was sick
all night. My head began to swell, from the point where the
bump had started upward to the top of my head. By morning
I looked as though I were recovering from a good mauling over
the head. If I happened to move, although I was in bed covered
up, I shook with chills running through my body. The condition
got worse instead of better. I did not call a doctor. I did not
even call the hotel where I had been working. I talked to the
Masters about it. I explained to Them that I was ready to go if
They felt it was time for me to pass on. I did feel exactly as
though I had been shot—as though there was a bullet in there
somewhere—and all I could do was to endure it all. I recall
that I thought, “Well, Lincoln, you didn’t know anything about
the suffering in your physical body at the time you passed, but
now I guess I will have to endure it here in this body.” That is
exactly what had to take place. That etheric body had to be
completely healed while in a physical body before the proper
adjustment could be made. Here is something for scientists to
think about.
For three days I was not sure I would live. I talked to but
few people about my condition at the time. The children were in
school. I finally called the people at the hotel, telling them I
was sick and unable to work. I lost my job, which was all right.
Mrs. Gloria H. Sommerville, who lived at the same place where
I had a small apartment in a garage in the back of the property,
245
LORD MAI TREYA
asked me why I did not call a doctor. She witnessed the awful
swelling of my head when I went to the phone to call my
employers.
After the third day the swelling started going down, and
within a few days was normal. I have not been bothered with
the old condition since. Nor have I felt like the same person. I
feel that I am all here now, whereas, before I felt as though there
was some of me missing. When I lectured to a group of about
thirty people in Long Beach two weeks later one of the men
present asked me following the meeting, “Why is it, all the time
you were speaking I did not see you, I saw Abraham Lincoln?”
You, reader, can answer that question for him. I have had
numerous experiences with Abraham Lincoln. Some I shall
relate.
On October 29, 1941, I was asked to give an address before
two groups of students, in San Bernardino and Long Beach.
I was asked by Lord Maitreya to do this before going into
seclusion to write this book, and for the purpose of determining
the good that might be done and to what extent my message
would be accepted. Following is the message given, which began
at 12:30 P.M .:
BLESSED STUDENTS OF LIGHT:
You are the first group of people I have been able to
speak to since holding the office I have been chosen to fill.
I have been promised the full protection and radiance of
the Brothers of the Great White Lodge, of which I am a
member. I know THIS, I shall not speak to you of one thing
I have not experienced. I have never taught anything I had
not experienced in my life and I have been a teacher for more
than 20 years.
These are momentous times. This is the time, you might
say, of the Passover. We are passing over the bridge into the
greater world, the Golden Age. I want you to see that bridge
clearly. It is a Golden Bridge, which glows with true love,
DIVINE LOVE. Love is more beautiful in silence than in
spoken words. (Silence for several seconds.) It is a radiance
of liquid light, strengthening, power-building. It has all
within it anyone would desire.
Lord Maitreya is the Lord of Love. He is the One
through whom all Love flows into the world. He is the Lord
of Lords. He is the Great Director of the Great White
246
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Lodge. He speaks through Love and those members of the
Great White Lodge who know Him,—every word He speaks
they drink in. He never has to speak but once in His kind
way. Everything He wishes done is done in Love.
Is there anything more wonderful than Love? Love is
the all-pervading Light of Understanding. If I love you I
know you will understand me. Love a person and he can’t
help but understand and work with you, and cooperate with
you. Sometimes in the trials of life, when we have neglected
to keep love burning in our heart’s, we may have done things
and said things that were not done in the spirit of love, and
we regretted them later. But always, when we want to do
things in the spirit of love, do you remember how easily they
were done?
I remember the things I wanted to do with love in my
heart, how quickly, how perfectly they were accomplished.
That is what I wanted to talk to you about today—accomplish­
ing the greatest task that was ever undertaken in this world—
establishing a new order through the magnificent power of
LOVE.
Yes, a few weeks ago, Master KH, and Lord Maitreya
came to me and told me, after months of direct training
and instruction, that I had received, I could go forth into the
world; that they would protect me and see that I was pro­
tected wherever I went; and that I could carry their great
message into the world. But it was not until I came to The
Mountain (Mount Olympus), being directed there by other
Brothers of the White Lodge, that I knew I had been chosen
the Chief-Avatar. I knew there were other Avatars who had
ascended. I was hesitant, but I received a message, stating
that I should not hesitate, but to go forth as the Chief-
Avatar, the office which I was chosen to fill. (Mrs. Gloria
H. Sommerville of Los Angeles, was the witnessing amanu­
ensis through whom the written message was received. She
knew nothing of the circumstances referred to in the letter
from Mahatmah Koot Hoomi.)
There is much to be done by people like you, who know
and understand the higher laws of life. In each of you I see
the wonderful possibilities that you have dreamed of accom­
plishing. I know you would not be here if you had not
dreamed of them. I know by your faces; I know by even
feeling the radiance from your own minds and hearts, the
247
LORD MAI TREYA
confidence you have in feeling that the new Golden Age is
actually dawning now.
I shall not be able after today to speak in the outer world
for several months to come. It just so happens I am working
on a book to be published soon.
I love to speak to people who have faith and see the
vision of this New World. It makes me extremely happy and
if I can make you happy and get you to see the need of
whole-hearted brotherly and sisterly cooperation in this work,
then I will feel that I have performed a worthwhile duty.
I know you understand me, and I know that you feel in your
hearts how sincere I am in every word I speak to you, because
I love you and I take each of you into my Heart of Gold.
I am known among the Brothers as the Prince of the Golden
Heart, and I love to feel that I do have the Heart of Gold,
and that my Heart radiates forth to all with whom I come
in contact, that which will feed your heart, that which it
longs for—DIVINE LOVE. That is the most essential
thing in all the world, THAT LOVE WHICH IS COM­
PLETE UNDERSTANDING.
When Buddha Gautama came to me, after others had
taken me into their Presences, He came and said, “I take you
into my Heart of Hearts, My Most Beloved Disciple Mait-
reya.” He called me Maitreya because Maitreya means
“Most Beloved Disciple.” He explained to me that I would
be the Door through which all those seeking entrance into
the Great White Lodge would pass. In other words I am the
Door-Keeper. Just as there are those of you, no doubt, who
have held offices in such lodges as the Masons (or Knights
of Columbus), the Great White Lodge is similar to the
Masonic Lodge, and there are those chosen, just as in the
outer world.
Many of the laws that are used in the higher planes of
consciousness, are the laws, I might say, that are in operation
much like the laws we have in this world. So, you see, there
are others, I am sure, right here, who are members, and hold
various offices in the Great White Brotherhood. I was, for
quite a while, The Silent Watcher to this world. That office
was the office I held—a powerful office and a very responsible
one. During that time I was instructed and directed by the
Great Divine Director of the White Brotherhood, to investi­
gate the Rosicrucian activities, the Unity Movement, the I
248
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
AM movement in Los Angeles, and ALL OTHER RELIGI­
OUS ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
I went into them to see what was going on, and made
reports to the Recorder of the Great White Lodge of what
I found, then directed what work should be done toward
cleaning them up (Should they need cleaning). Do not think
that this needed cleaning has NOT been done! You need
not have any fear anymore about those forces that have been
tormenting you all these years. The Black and Shady
Brothers know this activity and they have no more power
to bother you. Watch your “Ps” and “Qs,” be sure you are
RIGHT and go ahead. Have no fear, “I am with you
always.” KNOW THAT CHRIST IS WITH YOU AND
ASSERT YOUR MASTERY. Be Master over these physi­
cal bodies and minds of yours. You have what it takes to
become Master. Go forth from this day on, FEELING
YOUR OWN MASTERY. Do not be half-hearted about
it; you cannot be that way. Love, Wisdom and Power, all
three in balance, must be used to become Master. Do not be
afraid.
For years I was in the publishing business. I published
a newspaper. It was not much of a paper (From the outer
standpoint) but it had much in it of Good, of Light and
Truth, of Wisdom and Power. I had a little slogan across
the top of the page, “I fear no one but God and Him only
when I do wrong.” I am telling you friends, Brothers and
Sisters, you can look thousands of people in the face and feel
courage enough to face an army of ten thousand. “I FEAR
NO ONE BUT GOD AND HIM ONLY WHEN I DO
WRONG.” It will strengthen you when you have something
to meet some day.
There are so many things I would like to tell you. I
have had the most marvelous, thrilling instructions given me
in the past 13 months that I could ever dream of. On the
29th of August a year ago, I met at Mount Shasta, Mary the
Mother of Jesus. This may seem strange to you, but there
are so many things coming forth in the next few years that
may seem strange, we may as well get used to it now. It is
all going to break through before you hardly realize it. You
have been feeling it, because many of you have brought
things through in your outer consciousness to prove what I
am saying. After I had met Her (Ave M aria), then I met
249
LORD MA I T R E Y A
Jesus, KH, Lord Maitreya, St. Germain, Morya, Buddha
Gautama, Krishna and God of the Golden Heart Mahacho-
han, My Father; and also the Great Sanat Kumara, who
was Lord of this planet up until last December, when Jesus
became Lord of this Earth.
It was some months before I could accustom myself to
associating with the Gods; but, my friends, we might as well
get used to that now, for they are coming forth to walk
among men. Make the “temples beautiful, entire and clean
that the gods may dwell therein.” In the Spirit of Love any
God or Lord or Master can come to you, sup with you, talk
with you, walk with you, even within yon. Even your Individ­
ual Spirit, as the Spirit of the Almighty, is illimitable.
I have had Lord Maitreya talk to me about the next
two thousand years, just as you and I might talk about the
next two weeks’ vacation. It is all planned, and is now to be
carried out in the physical octave of life, right here among
us. He even told me of those who will be reembodying,
thereby assisting in establishing the Great Golden Age, some
of whom I might mention. Rudolph Steiner—he will be
re-embodying to help us—also Vivekananda. I was also told
of those who will be initiated—some of those who will be
assisting us soon in the establishment of the new order among
men. Remember, this new order, this New Age, is to take
place especially in the hearts of mankind. It is the easiest
thing to accomplish that ever was, if we first understand just
how it is to be done. All these people who are fighting in the
outer state of being today, do not understand. The Golden
Age shall be established right in our hearts, and then it finds
its way to our minds, and then what is there to fight over IF
WE UNDERSTAND? NOTHING. What is my brother’s
is mine, and what is mine is my brother’s. Whatsoever you
sow, that shall you reap. If I strike you, I strike myself.
We are all “one BODY, WEE” in Christ, in God the Great
Spirit.
There are so many phases of this activity I would like
to talk to you about. It is the matter of choosing just which
one might be the most expedient at this time. I shall talk to
you a little about the seven bodies you have. I believe that is
most important.
I want to explain first to you, one thing, which is simple,
250
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
but you have never been told about it in the way you should
have been told.
The three lower bodies are the ones that give us all the
trouble here. The physical, etheric and mental. Most every­
one who has a modicum of spiritual understanding, get to
seeing their etheric body and THINK they are in the Seventh
Heaven. Get those three bodies well under control. Trans­
mute their forces—everything in them, into Divine Love,
and draw it all up into the four Higher Bodies, THEN YOU
WILL BE GETTING SOMEWHERE. You see, it is that
physical body and those desires. Then the mental body.
The etheric body is the one you dream in—the ordinary
dream. The experience you might have in the higher planes
—you usually know the difference when you have had one—
in a real experience—you actually go places and you know
when you come back to the outer consciousness that you have
been someplace and you have been doing something.
It is not uncommon for me to go places and do things.
For many years I have been most active. The things you so
very much want to do, in your heart, while you are here,
and yet do not feel like you will do them,—YOU DO DO
THEM. If the desire and love is strong enough you actually
go out and do them. That is chalked up for you in your
accumulation of Divine Work. The things we really and
truly and honestly want to do IN OUR HEARTS, are done.
Because we actually go out and do them. “Wherever your
heart is, there your treasure is also.” How simple! You
know, you men and women, when you were sweethearts
years ago? You remember when you thought of your sweet­
hearts, how close you were to them? You actually just felt
your arms around her, or him, and they were. Those are
little ways I want to prove the activity which you are doing
many times on the inner levels of consciousness and not being
aware of it on the outer. The Spirit of Love is the most
important of all. The words I speak to you now . . . There
is Wisdom and Power back of every word to do things you
would be interested in doing. Every word is loaded with
Power, sincerity and truth, and you know it. You cannot
fool people. “You can fool some of the people some of the
time and you can fool some of the people all the time, but
you can’t fool all the people all the time.” Now it is getting
so you can’t fool any of the people any of the time. It just
251
LORD MAI TREYA
can’t be done, the people are becoming so wise. These words
are Truth—simple Truth. I want you to know that the great
beings such as Lord Maitreya are the most simple and child­
like beings there ever were. (I can not speak His name with­
out He is here.) I one time was speaking to a sister across a
table, and something was said of which I thought in my mind,
“I wish Lord Maitreya were here to explain that.” No more
had I thought that than He spoke in that person. He said,
“Did you wish to see me?” I asked, “Did you get me that
quickly?” He answered, “I get you instantly.”
You have heard much in the past few years about the
Ascended Masters. The Ascended Masters are those who
actually have, in physical bodies, ascended in consciousness
into the Godhead. That is what they are. I want you to know
—each and everyone of you—and I want you to tell everyone
you see—that you do not have to die to ascend. I HAVE
ASCENDED CONSCIOUSLY, PHYSICALLY, MEN­
TALLY, SPIRITUALLY, in every way possible, AND I
KNOW I HAVE. I AM A LIVING EXAMPLE OF
IT. There have been thousands of people misled through
the misinterpretation of the initiation, who have the idea that
you have to pass on and die before you can ascend. That is
a great mistake. I realize this, since I have ascended: I am
not the same being. Any Master who chooses might come
and speak to you through me. As Saint Germain said the
other day, “We are one small body wee.” When you enter
into that infinite Spirit of Consciousness with God, you are
in the One Body of God in consciousness and reality, in Spirit
and Life and Love, in Wisdom and Power. It is not so hard
to understand, is it? It is so simple that most people over­
look it.
These three lower bodies are the instruments and tools
with which we work in this physical octave in the accumu­
lation of our DIVINE INHERITANCE, which is stored
up in the four Higher Bodies, so we have that to work with
when we are finished with it—the physical body. Mahatma
KH worked several months looking through my life-stream
and checking up on my Divine Inheritance. It took Him
months to find out where I belong in the present activity.
Just the other day I found where I AM. I had my record
placed on the table before us and two of us read it—from the
Great White Lodge. It ended up with these words: “NO
252
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
KARMA.” A lot of other words were recorded, but those
were the most wonderful. A clean slate—that is what we
have to have before we can ascend. We have to clean up
everything—balance up the books—then it is no trouble to
ascend. Everything is out of the way so you can see ahead
from the lowly earth to the very Godhead, God Almighty—
the main thing we feel in the outer consciousness. I can look
you straight in the eye. You are looking me straight in the
eye. When you get so you feel HE can look you straight in
the face, it is a wonderful thing. I am telling you, the first
few weeks after I met Ave Maria, I could just sit and rest
and look at Her without saying one word (for hours), and
just drink in the radiance. I can call to my Higher Presence
and I can direct a Light to you; in proportion to the need
and emergency you can do the same thing, and that Light
will carry with it whatever we desire it to carry. We can
breathe it in, so can you. You can just drink in the liquid
light from the atmosphere, take it into your body and trans­
fer it into anybody else. The main thing is to get into the
harmonious state of mind, radiating love to all mankind.
Feel that very radiance in the air you breathe. YES, FEEL
IT! See evidence in the very air you breathe in. Your vision
and imagination charge the breath you breathe with that
elusive Elixir of Life, which you take into the body, and you
send that into any part of the body you wish. Remember,
your imagination is very important. It is much more power­
ful than you think. Just get quiet and do it. WILL TO
DO IT.
We are going to perform greater miracles some of these
days. Jesus said, “You shall perform even greater miracles
than I.” I was born during the time of Jesus. I was John
that Jesus spoke to when on the cross. He said, “John,
know your mother.” Mary told me it was not John the Be­
loved, it was John the Brother of Jesus, to whom He spoke
those words. I took care of His mother after Jesus ascended.
I helped Her out two thousand years ago, so She came back
to help me this time. It was so wonderful when She came
and told me about this.
Somebody had to be John. If I am that fellow, I guess I
have to take it. There have been a lot of great people in the
world. Take the history books. There are thousands of them
and somebody had to be some of them. And, contrary to
253
LORD MA I T R E Y A
ordinary belief, the higher one becomes, the oftener he re­
embodies. The fellow who knows what he is about can easily
pick a body. I have known of my embodiments many embodi­
ments back.
In 1923 I chose to join the Rosicrucian Brotherhood.
One thing they wanted to know was my birthdate—even the
hour of my birth. I wrote to my mother, asking her about it.
She wrote back she did not know what the hour was, but that
my aunt was present and might know. But, before I wrote to
my aunt I got rather anxious about this matter and went over
to India (higher body) to a certain stone castle there. I was
walking along a path toward the south. In those days we
could tell pretty well by the sun in that country what time it
was. It was 20 minutes past 9 :00 A.M. Something struck
me and I was gone. I knew that was when I passed out. The
hour of my death there was the hour of my birth here. That
was proved conclusively later. (Sometime I shall explain the
entire experience. I lived 33 years in India following the
assassination of Lincoln and before I embodied in my pres­
ent body.)
Lord Maitreya is the Soul of Christ or the one who taught
Jesus. Jesus became one with Maitreya. It is not so wonder­
ful, but what you, too, can expect it. It is simple. Call to
the Masters when you feel alone—all whom you wish to
invite,—they will come if it is at all possible, and you are the
one who makes it possible. We must mention these things in
the outer octave. We have played around enough with creeds
and dogmas. We must be filled with the Great Spirit. This
is the time. You will be surprised what you can do now when
you try. We have all had these trials and tests. I have only
told you about the beautiful part. Not the trials unto death
almost, but I have faced them. It was the Love and the
Truth of the Christ that gave me the strength to carry on
and on until I did ascend into the Godhead, into the Cosmic
Heart and knew that I ascended. No one can harm you.
When you have that feeling, then you have the courage to go
along with it. Nothing can harm you, nothing can touch you.
Archangel Michael really put Saint Germain in His place.
The first thing I was asked to do (following my ascension)
was to take charge of Saint Germain—to reclaim every “I
AM ” student into the right place today. That is the first job
I have to do. There are some three million people who have
254
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
been sidetracked through the Black forces. They do not know
where they are today. They soon will know. The Truth hurts
no one.
Blessed Ones, you cannot tell who your neighbor might
be. You might be Archangel Michael himself, for all I know.
He is around somewhere in a physical body. That is why
Jesus said, “Judge not that ye be not judged.” We are to live
through the Bible again, with all its characters in reality, in
Truth, right here in this octave—however, on a much higher
plane of consciousness and activity. All those things are to be
brought forth, actualized, materialized, right here on this
earth. These people who talk about those who ascend, think
they have to go away UP somewhere. This is where THEY
work (On Earth)—the work has to be done right here.
They are not up there somewhere. They come back here to
this plane to get busy in the establishment of God’s Kingdom
on Earth.
Thank you, Blessed Ones, for listening.

The above address was written down in shorthand by Mrs.
Mary Smith, one of the students present. I always speak extempo­
raneously. Many wonderful reports of good done through the
addresses given on that day were received by us later.

CHAPTER XXXII
To know our own love, wisdom and power it is essential
for us to be tried. We ourselves cannot know our strength
unless there is some way to prove it; we cannot prove our
love unless there is someone or something to love; we cannot
prove our wisdom unless there is someone with whom to match
our wisdom. No matter what we undertake in this world there
will appear an adversary upon the path. He is necessary, other­
wise we cannot generate power to attain what we undertake.
A boxer (pugilist) or wrestler will train hard for months, and
even years, to attain supremacy in his chosen field.
When Sister Ratana and Stanley informed me of their inten­
tion, and the extent of their cooperation with me, I immediately
got busy looking for the way “out” and “into” the next episode
of my training and accomplishment.
I wrote the following letter to a Blessed Brother of mine, a
Brother of the Great White Lodge and a Brother of the Univer­
sal Brotherhood—one who had proved over a period of 16 years
to be a Brother in every sense of the word:
331 New Hampshire South
Los Angeles, Calif.
“M y Beloved Brother O............ : Sept. 16, 1941.
“Just received your ‘Bhashya’ yesterday afternoon, which was delayed
because of forwarding, then, just a few minutes ago I was handed your
postal, which was just as timely and opportune as the letter. This I will be
able to explain to you sometime. It certainly is marvelous how definitely
like ‘clock-work’ some of these things do work out. The uncanny way
things on the inner seem to sift through to our outer activity is astounding.
“Your message going out to the members of ‘M ’ is most timely I think.
I have so much that I might report, much of which has been recorded, I
am sure, in the records of the Great W hite Lodge, that it would be impos­
sible for me to write all, but I do believe the time has come when a general
conclave of the Brothers should be called, so that I as well as others, might
explain some of the New Golden Age principles before an UNDER­
STAN DIN G body of people. To be once clearly understood, to me, will
be a great great happiness. By all means put me in touch with some of
these UNDERSTANDING Brothers here. I shall not be here at this
address long, so please send my mail to ................., Apt. 205, Los Angeles,
257
LORD MAI TREYA
until further notice. And another thing, O............ , please enter D.............
and P............ S...... ....... on your correspondence list. They are very reliable.
I have known them for three years and over . . .
It so happened that I have just started writing a manifesto which I
deem essential to the world. You are perfectly welcome to use whatever of
this you see fit. Koot Hoomi told me the other day that He and Morya
will both be here with me early next year to help me. “She Who is Name­
less, to be known as AN O M A, you and the world will be able to know
next year too. Yes, Christ is here embodied. I have seen Him, inner and
outer. But as is written by Veshanajaya, ‘the ruling powers will be hidden
because of the magnitude of their positions.’ This is most true and well
said. I have proved it true AND MORE.
“Oh, if I could but speak to a group of people who understand! Do
whatever you can, Blessed Brother, to bring this about. In the name of
Christ Maitreya and the Blessed Buddha Gautama, whose Most Beloved
Disciple He has told me I AM , I know great so-called miracles of LOVE,
W ISD O M AND POW ER shall be manifest TH RU ME. So saith
the Lord.
Blessed Brother I feel the importance of your message I received yes­
terday. ‘I love you, I love you, I love you,’ as AN O M A has said to me
many times. AN O M A, Lord of Venus, will be W IT H ME FOR TEN
YEARS. BUDDH A AND JESUS ARE EMBODIED IN ONE
BODY—TH US THE EAST AND THE W E ST are not only symbol­
ically blended and harmonized in ONENESS and LOVE, BUT THE
N EXT TEN YEARS they will actually live and manifest in the ONE
BODY OF AN O M A. Meditate upon this my Brother. You will be
further enlightened thereby. You ARE illuminated.
“I must hurry and mail this AIR M AIL. This is, to me, the most
important step taken by the ‘M ’ in and for the N EW GOLDEN AGE.
Lovingly, “A M SU M A T A .”
The “BHASHYA” referred to in the above letter, which was
mailed out to the members of the Great White Brotherhood
throughout the world, so far as I know, and which gives the
reader some idea of the great scope of the Brotherhood’s activi­
ties, I feel impelled to reprint, owing to the office I hold, and
knowing that the Brother from whom it was received, silently
cooperates with me in its publication:
“BH ASHYA
“B. D H AR SAJA YA OF THE GREAT W H IT E BROTHER­
HOOD sends forth the following message:
“The work of the New Age with the Integral Teaching will carry
forth from here to the furthest corners of our planet. This is the head-
258
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
quarters for the Integral Purpose and through which it will be realized.
I am speaking as a Messenger of the Great W hite Lodge, the heart of
the Great Brotherhood under the Almighty Father. Some of the
Father’s special Messengers for the New Age are now with me. Even
the Messenger who is the Vehicle of the Great Lord that comes once
in a while through the ages; the last time was the time when the Lord,
the Christ, was on earth. W e are preparing for His coming . . . W e
stand as the Messengers preparing for the fulfilment of the prophecies
of the ages of the past.”
“Further, in our present emplacement, we can lead the Disciple to
that place where he will receive his occult initiation before the Silent
Watcher, our Planetary Overlord.”

“B. A M SU M A T A OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE
GOLDEN AGE sends forth the following message:
“St. John the Beloved is to be King (spiritual ruler) during the
incoming Golden Age. Ave Maria and Her son, John (Amsumata),
will be important leaders. John the Beloved is Manu to the Seventh
Race (now begun). The Seventh Angel will come forth with power
Aug. 27, 1941.
“A ll who look for Him will see Him ‘as He is.’ And we have a
promise of God that He will appear in the heavens August 27, 1941,
A.D. May the world rejoice that the Jewel of Jewels is in Complete
Illumination. She is the Law of the New Golden Age.”
* * *
“B. CELA VE SH AN AJAYA OF ARTEM IS says:
“The Law of the New Age is the Law of the Transcendental
TRIAD . The rulers will be a Tri-inity under the inspiration of the
ONE IDEA. The ruling powers will be hidden because of the Magni­
tude of their positions. Their offices will be distinct, their powers will
be Inter-penetrating, and the end will be the establishment of the New
Order. There will be a renovation of Art, a clarifying of Beauty, and
a Great Illumination of Truth. Goodness will abound and the New
Society will be born.” * ^ *
“REJOINDER OF SA T R A JIT A OF SA H A PT IN K IA :
(1) “From the preceding it is evident that there is a presentiment of
the coming of events of great magnitude. This prescience has taken the
form of prophetic vision. Associates of these seers are believed to be
either the reincarnations of previous great souls or vehicles of the Great
Lord.”
(2) “From the foundation laid in the resume above made it is clear
that there is expected to be an appearance of the Universal Lord, and that
259
LORD MAI TREYA
He is to be announced by those who are His forerunners, and that these
forerunners are to be vehicles or reincarnations of former souls who
have served in this same capacity in other Golden Ages, and who are
therefore Adepts in this special W ork.”
(3) “Further, it is clear that the message has preceded the official
announcement by Heralds Unknown. There is a dynamism about the
whole Great Schema that brooks no hindrance. Therefore, it is con­
fusing to some that these reports have gone forth prior to the actual
Advent. Dates have been given, the signs described, and those who have
heard wait patiently for the coming of the Great Lord.”
(4) “In addition to the simple static Idea of the appearance of the
Lord, which leaves all students in honor looking for the Advent, there
has gone forth dynamically the proclamation that He is here. That the
signs of His coming have been seen in the Heavens. And also that the
Universal Lord has gone into the Sanctuary of the Temple where the
Hierarchy of Vehicles, Messengers and Handmaidens, stand ready to
serve and indeed are going forth as Seventh Angels with the dispensation
of the Golden Age Blessings.”
(5) “From the Temple where the HIDDEN LORD of the Uni­
verse sends forth His rule there will go forth a multitude of messengers.
The Transcendental Triad of Goodness, Truth and Beauty will become
the underlying Organon of thought and action. Wisdom, Love and
Power will be given to all. Liberty, Knowledge and Bliss will be the
Spirit of the Great Brotherhood. Realization of these things will bring
Nirvana to earth.
(6) “This we have gathered from the IM PLICATIO N S of the
messages that have been received previous to their having gone forth
officially. Whether any of these messages have any bearing on the actual
appearance of the Lord does not yet appear. If any of the brethren have
any word of confirmation to add to this summation please append on a
separate sheet or sheets and sign your Mystical Name and official status.
Then see that a copy is sent to this scribe. It will be added to the files
and will become regular in its circulation.”
Included among the data received from a high official of
the Universal Brotherhood, was the following paper, which, I
suggest the SEEKING STUDENT to read most carefully,
since it, too, is authorized by the Great White Lodge, for your
protection and direction regarding the Advent of Christ and the
Ascension:
“THE D YN AM ISM OF THE O C C U LT ”
“That is true which reveals its own nature, and the nature of that of
which it is the expression, especially to one who has a right to that reve­
lation.”
260
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
“That is false which denies its own nature, and the truths revealed
which are the expression of that nature, especially to one who knows surely
the truthfulness of that revelation.”
“The Infinite and the Infinite alone has the right to Infinite knowledge,
and this right is ineffable, infinite and eternal.”
“The Infinite is Truth Itself, and the Absolute Logos, which is the
Infinite, is Truth Itself.”
“Truth Itself, Goodness Itself, Love Itself, is the Fullness of the
Godhead bodily. This embodiment fills the Immensity of Space and is
Space Transcendent. The Logos is Spirit. Love is Spirit. Beauty is Spirit.
These are the revelation of the Unity of God, and in nowise are manifested
on the Occult or Ethereal plane.”
“Occult Power manifested is dynamic on the sensual plane, and is dis­
cerned on the Astral plane. A ll physical and occult powers as well as
mental, are manifested in their respective spheres and octaves as vibratory
in nature.”
“Spirit is on the spiritual plane, and does not manifest in the vibratory
world. True LOVE is spiritual. Therefore it is above time and space and
motion.”
“Occult manifestations now disturbing the Astral W orld are the
thought forces of Malignant Spirits who have resorted to the most conven­
ient method of carrying on their malignant operations.”
“Many of the so-called revelations of occult truths that have in recent
years gone forth are the release of knowledge and powers that these myriads
of Astral forms have acquired from great persons of all ages to whose beings
these forms have attached themselves. Upon the death of each of these great
ones the astral forms must of necessity seek new bodies or be destroyed. The
result is that there is today, at the beginning of the Golden Age, a legion of
deceiving Astral Forms occupying in high places, focusing great monuments
of knowledge and power in the hands of many of the so-called Masters in
many of our greatest and foremost Esoteric and Acromatic Orders and
secret Societies.”
“This is a great menace to the propagators of Truth, Wisdom and Love.
To increase the dangers and pitfalls along the way many of these Arch­
deceivers claim to be Ascended Masters. There is hardly a society that has
not been affected. In the abundance of such evidence the most brilliant
minds of today wonder if the Ascended Masters themselves are truly
Ascended Masters. Or are they merely the spawn of these Astral Forms?”
“Therefore, we join with others in advising the True Teachers, Gurus
and Mahatmas of the Great Circle to refuse to entertain any of these self-
acclaimed Ascended Masters on any forbidden plane. To do so is to invite
spiritual enslavement and mental disaster. True Ascended Masters are
Messengers from much higher planes than any ever to be reached by these
deceivers.”"
261
LORD MAI TREYA
“This instruction is in nowise to be taken to refer in the least degree to
those Ascended Masters, if such there be in any territorial jurisdiction, who
are known definitely to be such.”
“If it is known positively that these Ascended Masters have Truly
Ascended in their own individual right, and have received, not only the
highest possible earthly Initiation, but that they passed over the penetralia
of Supernatural Life and have been conducted into the Realms of Supernal
Bliss and Life Eternal, and who bear evidence in their bodies that they have
been changed in the fullest possible measure, and have cast off their mortal
bodies and manifest themselves on human planes in their celestialized
personalities, then these are the True Ascended Masters.”
“More simply put, that is true which reveals its own nature, and the
nature of that of which it is the experience, especially to one who has a right
to that revelation.”
“ASCENSION IS IN ITS OW N NATURE NOT TO BE
DENIED, BUT IS ITSELF OF THE NATURE OF SELF­
REVELATIO N.”
“THE FALSE M ASTER W IL L DENY T H A T THE RE­
QUIREM ENTS FOR ASCENSION ARE A C T U A L L Y AND
LITE R ALLY NECESSARY STEPS IN ASCENSION, AND W IL L
DENY ALSO T H A T A M AN IFESTATIO N OF TRU E CELES-
T IALIZAT IO N IS THE ON LY MEANS BY W H ICH THE
T RU TH IS TO BE REVEALED.”
“THE TRUE M ASTER W IL L LET HIS TEACH IN G AND

AND THE W O RSH IP OF HEROES W IL L NOT BE THE DIS­
TIN GU ISH IN G M ARKS OF THE ASCENDED M ASTER.

Following receipt of the above documents as well as other
letters received by myself, due to other questionings I knew to
be prevalent regarding my newly chosen office of “Chief-Avatar,”
I wrote the following letter along with a copy of a communica­
tion from KH to me, all of which I mailed to the official whom
I had first corresponded with in the North:
Nov. 3, 1941.
Blessed O............:
I am enclosing herewith a letter received from Mahatma Koot Hoomi.
It is really self-explanatory, however, I do wish to express to you, person­
ally, a few words, anent the publishing and advertising of the Great Mes­
sage I have to give the world.
262
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I know very well just where you stand, Brother, even better, I am sure,
than you know. THERE IS NOTH ING HIDDEN FROM ME
T H A T I VERY M UCH DESIRE TO KN O W . God Bless You, I do
not say this to “lord it over on you,” or anything of that sort.
Even after I had asked you to come to Bremerton that time to receive
certain initiations that Lord Maitreya wished me to confer upon you, I met
you on the inner planes, M ERELY IN YO U R ETHERIC BODY,
HOWEVER, and I was deeply hurt that you had the opinion IN YO UR
ETHERIC BODY that you were my superior. Bless your heart, Brother

THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENT WAS ENCLOSED
WITH THE LETTER:
Nov. 3, 1941.
Blessed Ones of the Light:
The following message was received by the “Chief-Avatar,” Guru
Amsumata, Oct. 25, 1941, at Los Angeles, Calif., and the witnessing
Amanuensis was Mrs. Gloria H. Sommerville:
“From Koot Hoomi
“To the Chief Avatar:
“The way may appear obstructed but when ‘He is with you who can
be against you ?’ and when the time is ripe why not let the whole Divine
Family be in the lineup for an overwhelming assemblage, for there is not
or can ever be any compromise between the ‘Haves’ and the ‘Have nots.’
They are either for or against Him, and the ‘FORS’ are winners.
“The law is plainly laid down and all must pay the price of redemp­
tion by the obedience to the Golden Age new law as given, and now
repeated, resurrected and put into practical action.
“The law of the universe is the same now and forever and ever. He
is the ‘Alpha and Omega,’ and time passeth, and all must observe the
law or perish, for as stated, the law was laid down from the beginning.
“The word was spoken and then became law, and the whole uni­
verse is based on L A W AND ORDER, and I, saith Jehovah, give unto
my children the breath of life. W e all breathe according to Divine Law,
and the way is made plain, so plain that even a fool cannot err therein,
and with the New Golden Age, why delay the ushering in of the King­
dom of God’s righteousness on earth ?
“As was said, the way is plain and rules are given, and those who
run may read, and I am to be associated, and director of the great
change, and He, the Chief Avatar, will receive the best and truest
impressions given, and only an outer form of instruction may from time
to time be written to avoid error, but all the Great Masters may urge
the New Dispensation more quickly than expected, and so, in that event,
264
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
a great surprise overtake the ‘Have Nots,’ and THOSE W H O ARE
NOT FU LLY PREPARED, or the ‘lukewarm,’ will have the shock
of being fully surprised by the shortening of time, so abruptly that all
time is blotted out for them, for THE FEAST IS AND HAS BEEN
PREPARED, AND TH EY ARE INVITED TO PARTAKE, and
yet, TO M A N Y ‘O FFAL’ SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE, and
so why should Christ’s mercy be continually delayed to permit the exten­
sion of time to those who do not appreciate God’s laws, or try to
obey them?
“The shock of clearing the landscape is to be suddenly given, and
then will follow the very great expansion of God’s laws to beautify and
cleanse the footstool of God (the earth) to make it the receptacle for
the ‘Heavenly Manna’ with which all will be fed ‘a full participation’
in the table set for all, and to feed those who long have hungered, and I
am ready to leave my ‘craggy abode’ and follow hither and thither ALL
THE W A Y , the world around, up and down, and never a weary
moment following out the instructions of the Master, as laid down, so
we, ‘One Body Wee,’ one for all and all for one, W E STAND
FIR M LY TOGETHER.
“W e follow the precepts and the law. So we will be with those that
are the ‘elect,’ so to you, Avatar, I say W E A R Y NOT OF W E LL
DOING.
“The faith must be fully exemplified, and none will find the supply
wanting, for all is in the hollow of God’s hand, and may be fully
sustained in all and every undertaking, so I am near to answer all calls
and ever ready.
“KO O T H OOM I (K H ).”
P.S. From Amsumata:
(Attached to letter)
“W e trust that all who are permitted to read this message will under­
stand the urgency of all activity and not take up valuable time quibbling
about ‘who’s who’ in this and that. TH IS IS TH E T IM E WHEN
A L L LIGH TS M U ST COME W IT H IN THE ONE GREAT
LIG H T O R P E R IS H . W e want it thoroughly understood, too, that all
orders or commands, or even suggestions, followed by me, and hence, those
who are ‘with me,’ come directly from the COUNCIL OF THE GREAT

PRIEST. URGENT FOR ACTIO N.

It is well that the reader take into serious consideration what
Koot Hoomi has said in the above letter.
When I think of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, just
a week ago last Sunday, December 7, when Koot Hoomi’s letter
was written on October 25, almost ten weeks previous, I do not
wonder, as He said, that the “clearing of the landscape” will be
sudden. The Blessed Children of Light will not have to wait
much longer before they will see God’s retributive laws go into
action. The whole world is now at war. It could not be if it
were not that the people of the world have created it. We must
take what we have sown. However, the Children of Light, of
Goodness, of Truthfulness, of Faithfulness, Purity, Love and
even Long-suffering, ARE THE ONES WHO WILL BE
PROTECTED, DIRECTED AND SHELTERED during
the “AWFUL DAY OF THE LORD.”
Watch and pray, Children of Light. Lord Maitreya is with
you ALWAYS. Call to Him, Christ Maitreya.

CH APTER X X X III
In the correspondence I carried on with my Brother in the
North is the finest of instruction for any student who may pos­
sess the same doubts he expressed. I myself was somewhat
shocked by the tone of the following letter I received from him,
yet, I know the Great Masters work most mysteriously their
wonders to perform, and I feel now, since all was written and
answered, Lord Maitreya (Christ) was actually directing all,
and I am sure the following letter and its answer is the grandest
instruction any seeking student might receive, even though it
may seem at the moment otherwise :
“ (A beautiful Symbol)
(No date)
“Dear Norman:
“It is very timely that you should have found your way to the Temple of
M ............O -............and the Great White Brotherhood. It is needless to say
that I have known of and about this group for many years, and in more
recent years I have been in close touch with the President of the Society and
have had some very illuminative instruction from this very kind and lovable
brother. I would say that he is a TRUE IN ITIATE. He should prove
a good companion and an inspiration to you.
“If there is anyone there qualified to judge any recent attainments on
your part he should be the one. I feel about you just the same as you have
expressed your opinion about me. I feel that I know you better, and much
more fully than you know yourself. I hesitate to formulate in words what
you would no doubt misunderstand. But if you gathered anything good
from my recent and previous visits of myself in the ethereal world know
that indeed those good wishes are true. And if there was anything unpleas­
ant in the Astral projection I wish you to know that the astral projection,
while completely under my control, was only the vile and coarse body, the
emotional body which is bound to betray the emotions we strive the hardest
to overcome. The spiritual body was also present, full of love and compas­
sion, if you had been attuned to feel its presence there. You need only to
open your heart and you will feel the love and uplifting influence of the
spirit therein.
“I know that you have sought sincerely the W A Y and if you have
entered therein I should be the first to rejoice. But you know as well as I
267
LORD MAI TREYA
the phantoms along the way. They do not need to be enumerated if I were
qualified to name them.
“There is one warning I wish to pass on to you, which you may take
or leave as it suits your fancy. True discipleship does not end with Guru-
ship. Guruship does not end with the business of an Avatar. There is still
the INFINITE to be aspired unto. Keep up the discipleship.
“And hand in hand goes this thought. When you stand at the heights
look outward, inward, look straight before you and you will see the breth­
ren. Your lofty attainments do not place the other brethren beneath your
own attainments. NO one is the sole A V A T A R in this the GOLDEN
AGE. Others have seen the new dawn and breathed the fragrance of the
Blessed Flower.
“You speak of your COM M ISSION which came through the written
word, and on perishable materials. Yet I have not questioned your sin­
cerity. You are TO O sincere in some things, and have suffered for it.
Yet you have appreciated what you have accepted as your commission to
the extent that you are willing to devote your best to its service. I have also
been commissioned.
“I have stood on the heights and have looked straight across the abyss.
I have seen the great Light and have heard a great Voice. I have also seen
ONE great Ascended Master. I have received this commission: “Seek
N EW T RU T H with all thy heart, and when thou hast found it, TEACH
it with all thy W ISD O M , LOVE AND PO W E R.” Now this is not
imagination. I have received the commission. No one is too IL LU M I­
NATED for me to converse with, too EXALTED before the brethren for
me to write with any degree of wisdom I may have. But as LOVE must
find the OPEN HEART, so T RU T H must find the OPEN MIND.
“Reincarnation has so many varieties that one hardly knows which to
believe in. Osiris has so many manifestations today that truly he must not
only be confused but diffused as well. Napoleon, likewise. Lincoln and
St. Germain. Quibbling is what you would call anything that didn’t meet
your particular incarnative spirit at this time.
“But this self-assertive ethereal body of mine cannot cease to function
and disagrees with a good many things.
“But— another BUT—AV A T A R S in all ages have revolutionized
world thought, and have brought to focus the CENTRAL TRU TH S that
pertain to that generation and the generations to follow. I might empha­
size the COM M ISSION given you.
“As I remember Koot Hoomi’s teaching, he promulgated the Secret
Traditions of the RACES. These races have progressed, and these teach­
ings have also evolved. But as he says in your commission, the law was laid
down from the beginning. And the whole universe, he says, is based on
L A W AND ORDER.
“Norman, you wish me to avoid the superior attitude of earthly wisdom
and intelligence manifested in reasoning. I wish to God you would tell me
268
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
how to even so much as formulate one first principle of the UNIVERSAL
L A W AND ORDER without the use of reason. Many of us have tried
to feel our way into an appreciation of the A rt of God’s Universe, not
because we despised wisdom, but because we didn’t have it.
“Law and order are based on wisdom, and truth is to be understood.
The W O R D has gone forth and will not return to God void.
“Again brother, you say that I have hurt you while in the ethereal body.
Bless you, my brother, do you think I can read any one of your letters, in
which you tell me of your mighty attainments and how the LORDS, the
GODS, the ASCENDED M ASTERS, the IN ITIATES and all the
BUDDHAS and the LORDS OF THE SEVEN RAYS come and go
at your simple command or beck and call; I say to you, while you complain
that I use too much earthly wisdom of the damned Empiric Order which
also seems to bow the Knee, it hurts me, it grieves me deeply, in fact beyond
repair, that you fail to give me the credit for any sense of proportion what­
ever. Again, in your last letter, you still have not told ALL.
“Do you not know that did I live on the plane on which such things
affect one that the Blood would not run from my hands and my sides and
that vinegar would be my drink for sweetness?
“I wish never to have to say to one who is to be the CHIEF A V A T A R
that he must humble himself and be the servant of all ? There are ‘Lords
many, and Gods Many’ but ONE I know!
“No matter what place you may occupy in any Order I have the pene­
tration of spirit to enter into and perceive the real man and I know that
underneath all the assumptions, all the great outward masks that cover up
the real spirit, all the clouds that arise between us because of such matters,
again in a long confusing sentence I say that I have perceived the real boy
that your mother gave birth to, that struggled through many tough, heart­
breaking years to attain to manhood, and in good clean companionship I
learned to love. He is still there, and while the outward man may change
the things of the INNER TEM PLE are unchangeable. Spirit is eternal
and Gods, MEN and devils are powerless to pollute him. In this NOR­
M AN I LOVE YO U.
“M y blessing to you dear brother is this: where fear followed you there
was nothing to fear. When you thought your spirit was too weak and
small, you were big and kind, and out of your eyes the spirit of youth looked.
But you were not a young spirit. Your body confused you many times, and
your mind was not equal to the mighty demands of the great soul, the
Mahatma, within. It was not your spirit that needed development—it
was your lower mind— by which you were fed. But the age-old spirit craved
expression and the three lower bodies were confused and you sought the
short-cut. I bless you where you do not seek a blessing, but now, once
again, be yourself—man— be yourself.
“Now, Norman, can I help you as a brother and friend?
269
LORD MAI TREYA
“I love to formulate my experiences in documentary form. Do not think
that I seek to deceive. But I do know that I have much that received
gladly will help you or any one with an OPEN M IND AND HEART.
“I salute you with Love alone,
“SA T R A JIT A .”

I shall immediately go right on with the answer to the above
letter. Although I was “busy as a bee” doing the very things
Satrajita thought I was not doing — UNIFYING THE
WORLD IN THE ONE GREAT LIGHT—I did take “time
out” to answer his letter completely, irrevocably, unconditionally,
unreservedly, comprehensively, irrefutably and irregretably as
follows:
“Dear O............, Nov. 9, 1941.
Thou Who Seeketh
Infinity in Christ:
“M y Blessed Brother, May God Bless your Soul, and may Lord
Maitreya take you, Hand in Hand, into His TEM PLE of LOVE, where
Reason is left behind and Your Christ Body, stript of all lower incrusta­
tions, stands revealed for what you ARE, THE SON OF GOD
A LM IG H T Y — ONE W IT H THE FATHER—A G A I N !
“Brother, I shall answer your letter paragraph by paragraph, as busy
as I am, getting together the ‘revolutionized world thought’ for the book
KH and St. G. and L.M . are urging and directing me in writing,—yes, I
shall, Blessed Seeker of Truth, ‘humble myself and be the servant of
YO U .’ Yes, ‘there are Lords many, and Gods many’ but one CH RIST
and HE IS INFINITE, and HIM ‘I K N O W .’ DO Y O U ?
“K N O W THIS, Brother, since you HAVE CHALLENGED ME
AND TH E VERY GODS W H O ARE M Y PROGENITORS, our
swords, YO URS AND MINE— SW O RD S OF LIGH T, LOVE,
W ISD O M AND POW ER—shall fly most quickly and cut with light­
ning speed in the fury of OUR BATTLE to PROVE who’s best Q U ALI­
FIED to lead the Children of the Shadow back into the TEM PLE OF

MINE, HE W H O HAS M O ST OF LOVE SH ALL RISE UPON
THE VANQUISH ED TO LEAD THE ST RU G G LIN G MASSES
OF EARTH ’S CHILDREN T O THE ‘DOOR’ W H ICH YO U —
APPAREN TLY— FAIL TO SEE AND RECOGNIZE. I meet you
on the battlefield of Christ and His Love guides me, STREAM IN G
FROM THE PO R TAL OF M Y G O L D E N H E A R T !
“In your very first paragraph (of your letter I just received) you inti­
mate that I found the Great White Brotherhood on M............O............... In
270
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
this you err, as I found the Great White Brotherhood IN M Y HEART.
That the Brother here is an IN ITIATE I do not question, but this I DO
KN O W , after I had been with him less than a week, HE KN EW T H A T
I W A S THE ONE CHOSEN BY THE GREAT W H IT E LODGE
AS THE ‘CHIEF A V A T A R ’ AND IT DID NOT COME ON A
M AT E R IAL W R I T T E N W O R D . M y inspirations come from the
Gods, not men. I realize the ‘constant’ possibility of the Gods visiting me
directly through my fellowmen, however. The tenor of your letter con­
stantly betrays your true standing in ‘discipleship’ since your definite rating
of me instantly stigmatizes you and places you in the place of limitation, you
in your ‘judgment’ of me would thereby classify me. H IM you should
follow you would dare think you should lead. This is invariably true of all
who aspire upward and onward. W e cannot rise but by challenging those
who STAND IN OUR P A T H W A Y . You would ‘rend my V eil!’ I
shall bless you, since you DARE.
“There are none qualified to ‘judge’ me but Christ, and my ‘recent
attainments’ in the Cosmic Heart were attained through the Highest Initia­
tions obtainable on earth; three of all on earth received them: Mahatma
Koot Hoomi, Ave Maria and Saint Germain (Amsumata), and the ‘Great
Purusha’ was experienced by each of us, Beloved Krishna of long ago having
been the last one on earth to have knowingly gone through such initiation
up to this time. I A M SAIN T GERM AIN.
“It is the ‘vile and coarse body, the emotional body,’ that you need to
dissolve, TRAN SM U TE, REGENERATE AND D R A W INTO
THE A U R A OF CH RIST T H A T HE M A Y L I F T Y O U UNTO
HIS TEM PLE OF LOVE. You, Beloved, must bring Christ into your
body, otherwise He does not ‘dwell among man.’
“I do not doubt but that your ‘spiritual body’ was also present when I
witnessed your astral projection, and should you tell me that you were the
outer body of Lord Maitreya (the one He uses in this physical plane) I
would be inclined to believe you, at least until I proved you otherwise,
W H ICH I CAN, SHOULD I SO DEEPLY DESIRE IT. Each para­
graph of your letter brands you a ‘doubting Thomas.’ However, we need
men such as you to take care of the ‘empiric’ until more ‘John the Beloveds’
are congregated together. You write, ‘You need only to open your heart,’
knowing well that reason does not come from the heart. You had better
take your own advice— OPEN YO U R HEART.
“You say you ‘should be the first to rejoice’ in what I have found. How
can you possibly rejoice W IT H ME until you, too, have found what I
A M — Christ Incarnate? Speaking of ‘phantoms,’ you say ‘They do not
need to be enumerated if I were qualified to name them,’ do you? I AM
QUALIFIED. M y ‘judgment is righteous judgment,’ for I JU D G E IN
CH RIST LORD M AITREYA.
“And then you W AR N ME, M y Little Seeker After Wisdom and
Love. ‘DISCIPLESH IP DOES N OT END W IT H GU R U SH IP’
271
LORD MAI TREYA
nor ‘the business of the Avatar.’ As though I did not know this my Doubt­
ing Brother. There are many higher ‘DEGREES’ that have been conferred
upon me, Brother O............, as I have intimated, when I said ‘I have not
told all.’
“While holding the office of ‘SILENT W AT C H E R T O THIS
EARTH ,’ to be more exact in time, to the day, it was May 22, 1941, that
a part of the Great Initiation I received on Mt. Shasta ended with the
following:
“ ‘The Great Lord of Creation vanished, and then appeared the
Great Mahatma KH. “Oh, that now my call is answered,” he
exclaimed, “for my plea to Lord Krishna to answer this which was in
my heart, if I were chosen to develop Ave Maria. This, Her Jewel,
was developed by Him, The Lord of Creation. This I know now. You,
Ave Maria, I bless as the Jewel of Jewels of Womanhood.”
“ ‘Then he, Koot Hoomi, took both the hands of Ave Maria and
those of the Silent Watcher (Amsumata). “I am so happy,” he said,
“T H A T W E HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APPRO ACH THE
LORD OF CREATION. W E ARE HIS ON LY CHOSEN
DISCIPLES OF T H E I M M U T A B L E O N E , T H E G R E A T
P U R U S H A , T H E L O R D O F T H E P A S T A N D T H E F U T U R E ,
O U T O F W H O S E M O U T H W E W E R E B O R N .” How blessed
you are! Oh, how I wish I might be with you in form in the Presence
of the GREAT ONE, whose form “as the Dwarf in the Center,”
Ave Maria was so blessed to see. May she be able to see His Form as
Purusha, and may she be able to withstand it. Only one was ever able
to stand it— Krishna’.”
“I do believe, Brother, that too much of ‘shoe-selling’ doth cause ye to
be of thy doubting nature. ‘Worship Thy God with ALL thy heart.’ Get
right down to business, ‘your Father’s business.’ If this letter does not turn
the ‘trick’ then I shall say ‘there is no hope for you.’ Just don’t bother to
answer this letter, if you continue to doubt the Chief Avatar, for any help
that such an one might give would only hinder the Great Cause for which
I am sent. Do not think that the ‘Chief Avatar’ does not have a plan for
harmonizing all the religions of the world. He even has more than this in
mind and He has the aid of the Great Ones, W IT H O U T DOUBT.

“In paragraph five of your letter you talk as though I think my ‘lofty
attainments place me above the other brethren.’ W hy did you write that?
Do you want the truth? You are conceited, egotistical, and even jealous of
272
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
me, your Brother, you pretend to love. You, in your reticent, hidden way,
having been so long of the opinion that you are ‘above’ your fellowmen, that
you just can’t bear to have one you have known so well chosen as the ‘Chief
Avatar.’ Your next sentence proves what I write: ‘NO one is the sole'
“Avatar” in this the GOLDEN AGE .’ Meaning of course that you are
an AV A T A R . Who proclaimed you an Avatar? You say, ‘Others have
seen the dawn and breathed the fragrance of the Blessed Flower.’ Then if
you have, for you would have to have experienced it yourself to know that
others have experienced it, then you, my Beloved Brother, would humbly
stand by my side and go with me wherever the Gods determine. You would
do this without question did you know what I do. Of course, my Egotistical
Brother, I know there are others who have attained what I have, in a sense,
and yet it is not the SAME, for there are not two Saint Germains who
have done what ‘I H AVE’ during the past six or seven hundred years. That
is the reason I was chosen the ‘CHIEF’ and if you want to be CHIEF
instead of me, then it means that either you or I get out of the way of the
other, or you will have to stand BY ME and assist me in every way you
possibly can. W H ICH DO YO U W ISH TO DO? I P U T THE
QUESTION RIGH T UP TO YO U. BE A GOD, M A N ; BE A
GOD—come with us and help to harmonize this W H O LE W O R LD and
make of it a fit place for the GODS TO W A N T TO D W E LL IN.
“You then write, ‘Again brother, you say I have hurt you while in the
ethereal body.’ I do not think I said such a thing. I said it hurt me when
I found that you felt yourself superior than I. That is what I said. You
could not hurt my ethereal body.
“And in your next paragraph you all but weep when you say, ‘It hurts
me, it grieves me deeply, in fact beyond repair, that you fail to give me the
credit for any sense of proportion whatever.’ Bless your little wounded
heart. You do have so very very much to learn. Do you want me to sympa­
thize with you ? I would rather give you a GOOD SLAP with the flat side
of M Y SW O RD OF FLAM IN G FIRE to wake you up to a few impor­
tant principles, however, I guess I will have to LOVE YO U another
16 years before you ‘come out of it.’ You, Blessed One, are looking for
credit from someone in the ‘EM PIRIC REALM .’ M Y KIN GD O M IS
NOT OF TH IS REALM . If you, with all the associates you presume to
have in your Empiric W ay, did choose to help me, and they are all of your
limited Spiritual Awakening, H O W M UCH HELP DO YO U TH IN K
YO U M IG H T GIVE ONE W H O HAS ‘CH RIST M AIT R E YA
W IT H M E ’ ? I DO NOT NEED SUCH HELP UNLESS IT W ERE
GIVEN IN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE and by those who at least had
FAITH in the one ‘Chosen’ to lead ALL D O U BTFU L BROTHERS
SUCH AS YO U INTO THE FU LL ILLU M IN ATIO N OF THE
TEM PLE OF GOD. W ERE YO U HALF AS HUMBLE AS YO U
W O U LD HAVE ME TO BE, you would be a worthy Neophyte to take
into HIS TEM PLE. Again, I think the ‘shoe store’ has got you down, and
273
LORD MAI TREYA
I am afraid it is going to keep you down, unless you SNAP O U T OF IT.
W H A T IS W R O N G W IT H YOU, anyway? If you are a product of
the UB—AN EXAM PLE— then I think they had better start over or
have Brother Snell— the one who wrote most all the documents—who is
now in Heaven—dictate some FRESH instructions for you. And, for your
benefit, Brother, I will say, after all, I learned more in the outer and inner
from Brother R.S.C. than I learned from all others put together. Now,
how do you like that ? I was not asleep all those years when you thought
I was not ‘making enough money in the empiric world.’ I was AFTER
JU S T O N E TH IN G AND I FOUND I T — T H E R E A L C H R I S T .
Many of you so-called Christians talk a lot about Jesus, M y Elder Brother,
and Christ, but I want you to know, few of you have found HIM.
“Regarding re-incarnation, Friend O............ , you know, apparently,
just what you have read about it. I talk about what I have experienced
about it. I know of several of my Past Embodiments, and even am
acquainted with the individual spirits that correspond to each of those
embodiments in which I lived. I realize, too, Beloved Friend (FOR I DO
LOVE YO U ) that you have all these knowledges within your own life-
stream but you have not become AW A R E OF TH EM . That is exactly
what I am working so hard to do right now, AW AKE N YO U TO
W H O YO U ARE, and then you will not have to take my word for
anything, and when someone tells you of such things as I have experienced
you .will NOT D O U BT but you will K N O W that I SPEAK THE
TRU TH AND NOTHING BU T THE W H O LE T RU TH . Truly,
if you told me you were Mark, one of Jesus’ Disciples, I would believe you,
for I have met several of the Great Ones already, and I know that most
all the Great Ones are now embodied to FINISH THE JO B OF
ESTABLISH ING THE DIVINE LA W S HERE ON EARTH IN
THE GOLDEN AGE.
“In the above connection, Brother, I recently initiated Lao Tse, the
Great Chinese Philosopher. He was embodied in a very humble, broken
body—a ‘jack of all trades,’ so to speak, near Seattle, but Blessed KH sent
him to me, and it was only a few weeks until he ascended and knew W H O
HE W AS, was able to talk several different languages, including Chinese,
and there is no doubt in my mind that He is That Great One who is N O W
W IL L IN G TO GO W IT H ME and others to establish the Kingdom of
Almighty God on Earth. Now, frankly, Blessed Egoist, have you experi­
enced any such experiences? If so SPEAK UP. Do not be afraid. A ll
things are to be revealed, EVEN IN YO U. You can hide nothing from
me. You will find this out, for Lord Maitreya, M Y BLESSED M A S­
TER-TEACHER IS BY M Y SIDE CON STAN TLY, guarding me,
teaching me, and instantly He responds to my call, and I K N O W IT. I
DO NOT GUESS. Your letter proves to me that you have M UCH TO
BRING TH ROUGH IN YO U R OUTER BODY A N D M I N D
BEFORE YO U M A Y CONSIDER YO URSELF ASCENDED.
274
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
When you prove otherwise to me I shall acknowledge your W ISD O M
and everything else you may possess. I A M NOT SLO W TO PLACE
CREDIT W HERE CREDIT IS DUE. AS A RULE I OVER-DO
TH IS. EVEN YOU, until you got to writing more and revealing your
IGNORANCE, I thought you were somebody LIKE LORD M AIT-
REYA. Had you kept silent I would have continued thinking you were
A GOD. W ell, man, BE A GOD, BE A GOD—yes BE YO UR
HIGHER ‘SELF’— BE YO UR HIGHER ‘SELF’— not merely a MAN
as you suggested I should be. ‘Man you are now, a GOD BY T R YIN G .’
Those lines I wrote in 1936, when I was going through terrible ‘trials,’ yet
I was TRYIN G, TRYIN G, T R YIN G TO BECOME LIKE GOD
— ‘CH RIST.’
“You say you saw ‘ONE Great Ascended Master.’ I have seen hun­
dreds of them. I associate with them in the higher realms; I consciously
attend the meetings of the Great White Lodge. I am one of the Council
of Seven of the Lodge. I’ll tell you the names of the others, of whom you
may be ONE— I do not judge you, the REAL YO U — only the outer
Egoist. Here are their names: Mahatma Koot Hoomi, W orld Teacher;
Ave Maria, co-worker of Saint Germain, and Lordess of the New Eighth
Ray; Saint Germain (Amsumata), Leader of the Whites in all activities
inner and outer, and Lord of the New Ninth Ray, Lord of Sagittarius, and
now prepared to take over the Second Ray (BLUE) of Wisdom which
KH has held for a long long time, holder of initiatory work of ALL
DEGREES AND M ASTER OF ALL M ASTERS IN ALL BROTH­
ERHOODS (Spiritual) active on Earth. He is the One who holds the
Great Seal of Alpha and Omega; Jesus, now Lord of this W orld; Arch­
angel Michael, Lord of the Sun; Lord Maitreya, Christ to this Solar
System (Universe); Silent Watcher, the only One in this world who does
‘work independent of the Logos,’ the M O ST POW ERFUL, no doubt,
OF ALL.
“Your statement, ‘But this self-assertive ethereal body of mine cannot
cease to function and disagrees with a good many things,’ is quite a candid
acknowledgment for you. I am glad you realize there are SEVEN BOD­
IES. This awareness of yours helps some. But there are any number of
Spirits in your life-stream, entities you have created, etc., throughout the
ages, that you don’t seem to be conscious of, and you do not, I dare say,
realize the importance they may play in YO U when you become FU LLY
CONSCIOUS (ascend) OF W H O YO U ARE AND H O W M AN Y.
This, my Dear SA T R A JIT A , is one phase of philosophy that has not been
explained to the outer world ever that I know of, at least not in the clear
and ‘stepped down’ manner that ‘your humble Amsumata’ will explain it.
“M y COM M ISSION AS A V A T A R is already explained; it is simply
that I have been ‘about M y Father’s Business’ even much more than you
have dreamed of, and I K N O W what it’s all about, too. Have no fear but
that I know what my responsibilities are.
275
LORD MAI TREYA
“In regard to K H ’s teachings, I must say KH, so far as my Higher
Consciousness is concerned, is no more my teacher than I am His. I recog­
nize Him as my BELOVED TEACH ER IN THE OUTER, because
He is Most Wise in the outer activities of all true brotherhoods on earth.
Master KH one time last summer came to Ave Maria and me on Mt. Shasta
(since I saw you) and wept with joy because we were able to assist Him
in receiving an initiation He had prayed for all His life. This, He will
prove to you some day, if you ever get over the idea that you ALREAD Y
K N O W EVERYTHING.
“You speak of the ‘superior attitude of earthly wisdom.’ There is no
such thing. Wisdom is not, never was and never will be ‘earthly.’ I am
surprised that one of your supposed intelligence makes so many ‘crack-pot’
remarks about the Mysteries and the Sublime Wisdom. That you state in
regard to ‘wisdom’ and ‘because we didn’t have it,’ is contrary to most of
your letter, however, when you do admit you haven’t something, there is
some chance for you to find it, since you realize the lack of it.
“The W O RD IS GOD, goes nowhere and cannot be ‘void.’
“Paragraph, 3rd page, at top, I answered in a previous paragraph.
“Your insinuations regarding the ‘Blood would not run from my hands’
and ‘vinegar would be my drink for sweetness,’ I shall merely predict that
you will experience the same thing quite soon unless you have already been
‘crucified.’ You can no more ascend until after you have gone through the
‘crucifixion’ than you can ‘fly’ before you can walk. ‘Judge not lest ye be
judged.’ Lord Maitreya will T AK E CARE OF YO U, M Y LITTLE
BOASTER OF T H Y W ISD O M AND EARTH LY KNOW LEDGE.
Fear not, you will be taken care of, and I SH ALL BE W IT H YO U
A L W A Y S.
“You shall never know in reality the ONE GOD only through
CHRIST, and it isn’t an imaginative statement from an ‘ascended Master’
—you will K N O W HIM when you become like Him, and you will be
told you ARE a M ASTER when you become M ASTER of yourself, your
passions, your desires, the ‘four elements,’ jealousy, and all the little things
that keep one from knowing Christ, M EETIN G HIM EMBODIED,
SPEAKING TO HIM FACE TO FACE.
“You may have perceived the ‘real boy’ that my mother gave birth to,
but you certainly have not perceived the CH RIST that has been born in
me through Lord Maitreya, and yet, I think you shall SOON. If you don’t
then only GOD can help you. I shall leave you to your own conceit and
let you lead the Empiric W orld into YO U R LITT LE TEM PLE OF
REASONING.
“There is much truth in your next paragraph, but your lack of wisdom
in the balance of your letter depreciates from the few words of wisdom
you might write, for in the entirety of your letter I have long ago gathered
that any wisdom you might write would be borrowed from some source you
half understand. I suggest that you read that paragraph over several times
276
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
yourself and maybe you will realize that your ‘age-old Spirit (M A N Y OF
TH E M ) craves experience and the three lower bodies are confused’ and
you need to take the ‘short-cut’ that Lord Maitreya has offered you. ‘Once
again, be your HIGHERself—man be your HIGHERself.’
“ ‘Now, O............, can I help you as a brother and friend?’
“I do not like ‘to formulate my experiences in documentary form,’ for I
know it would only he to tickle my own bump of conceit. ‘But I do know
that I have much that, received GLAD LY, will help you or anyone with
an OPEN M IND AND H EART.’
“And my blessed O............, what is keeping you from helping me? Did
I ever tell you once in my life that you could not help me? W hat is it that
you have HIDDEN in that marvelous reasoning mind of yours that you
think I do not know? W ill you kindly tell me? Any time you want to help
me and the Great Brothers, JU S T ST AR T R IG H T IN. THE
W O RLD SURE NEEDS ALL THE ABLE ONES SUCH AS YO U
TH IN K YO U ARE TO HELP IN TH IS GREAT BATTLE OF
ESTABLISH ING THE GOLDEN AGE ON EARTH. W H A T ’S
H OLDING YO U, M Y BROTHER?
“Now, BELOVED (I’m talking to your Spiritual Self now) please
forgive me if you think that will do any good, for all the frank and earnest
words I have spoken to you. I do not care one whit, how you think about
them in the outer. Your real Higher Self knows I have told the truth. I
hope that Egotistical Mind of yours gets so it won’t operate at all. Then
maybe you will find Christ in your Heart.
“That was a fair battle, but I have had bigger, fierier and more interest­
ing battles with mightier ones than you, Dear 0..__......... And I am still
going strong. The mightiest battle I ever had was with Archangel Michael,
Lord of the Sun. However, here is a paragraph I wrote to one RSC March
24, 1939:
“ ‘In our travels on our return to “Our Father’s House” we want
nothing left undone that we may do to hasten that long-sought-after
home-coming. In the glorious pathway that leads to those “radiant
Ones” whose individual “Lights” ever grow brighter, as we travel on,
may we, each of us, tread its blissful course unhampered by the least
human mistake that we might have made to withhold the fulfilment of
God’s eternal Truth.’
“I wish you to know, UNRESERVEDLY, that I do not have one
personal feeling toward you that might hurt you in the least. I am posi­
tively IM PERSON AL in the work Lord Maitreya and the Beloved
Masters want me to do. A ll I have written herein, is written that it might
prove or disprove certain manifestations in your and my individual lives.
Frankly, I believe I can help you, and I am sure you can help me, but
REMEMBER, Blessed Brother, it is the New Kingdom I am interested
in establishing, and in my work, I must be no respecter of persons, empiric
277
LORD MAI TREYA
orders or brotherhoods so-called. I deal with the Ascended Masters and
Members of the Great White Lodge, and I KN O W whereof I speak. I
am not guessing as you seem to be doing most of the time.
“Lovingly, A M SU M A T A .”
The next morning before I mailed the above letter I added
the following postscript, to be sure that I was not misunderstood,
and to have my Brother know I love him:
“P.S.— Beloved Satrajita:— I wish you to know that I fully appreciate
the position you hold. It is important to the outer work. But please be
careful what you do, and A L W A Y S K N O W T H A T LOVE REIGNS
IN YO UR H EART IN W H ATEVE R YO U DO. YO U R ACTIO NS
ARE ALL UNDER THE OBSERVATION OF THE GREAT
M ASTERS. YO U M A Y REST ASSURED OF TH AT.
“You are, M y Friend, tampering with a very dangerous phase of human
and spiritual activity when you tell the Masters of the White Lodge what
to do, especially of the Council of Seven. Again, you may be ONE of the
Seven. I have learned too much about such matters in recent months to
‘judge’ anyone. I might judge your outer actions and words— ‘your fruits’
—but even then I would not judge your Higher Presence. Little did I
really think I was and AM Saint Germain until I G O T HIM IN A
‘CORNER,’ so to speak, AND BOM BASTED H IM SO SEVERELY
T H A T I REALIZED I W A S T O R TU R IN G M YSELF. So be care­
ful. Please don’t judge me by the body of this letter. THERE IS
SOM ETH ING THERE FOR YO U.
“Now, regarding your ‘Ace in the Hole,’ that you are so proud of,
Beloved; I want you to realize that I know how you are ‘working.’ I
realize that you have contacts in Los Angeles. This doesn’t matter to me.
I A M CH RIST INCARNATE, just the same.
“I was asked to give those two lectures in San Bernardino and Long
Beach. Whether you know it or not, YO U R SPIRIT W A S PRESENT
A T BOTH M EETINGS, and I saw you. You had projected your Spirit
—one of them— or your Higher Presence did—and you were manifest to
me in the bodies of those you ‘used.’ BE CAREFUL. There is a lot goes
on in your VARIO U S SPIRITS that probably you do not understand.
This is another reason you should come here and talk over a number of things.
“REMEMBER, Beloved, whatever you do with whatever Power you
have, you must, in the Name of Christ, BE CAREFUL, and use it for
the upliftment of humanity. And I AM chosen by the Great White Lodge
as ‘Chief Avatar’ for the leadership of the White Forces. God KN O W S,
and ALL the White Brothers—W H O HAVE ASCENDED—that I AM
not only SINCERE, 'but ABLE to FILL THE OFFICE for which I
A M chosen, and that I A M EM POW ERED BY TH EM to do the
278
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
JOB that I see and KN O W H O W TO ACCOM PLISH . I am not
chosen for this office because of anything I am in this body. It was because
of my DIVINE INHERITANCE. It took KH several months to check
up on that. The Council of Seven do not make a move unless They KN O W
what they are doing.
“Lovingly,
“ (Signed) SAIN T GERM AIN .”
* * *
A few days later I received an answer from Brother O........,
which proved to me, after all, that he IS AN INITIATE, that
he understands the PARADOXES, and he is ONE with the “I
AM PRESENCE” of the ONE LIFE, LIGHT, LOVE,
WISDOM AND POWER OF INFINITY. His letter follows:
“DEAR N ORM AN :
“May Wisdom, Love and Power be in you and may the LIG H T of

“I A M THE TEM PLE OF LOVE. May the DOOR be opened

(Author’s Note: I question this: that no one can work independently of
the Planetary Logos.)

“I A M ONE BODY. I A M ONE SPIRIT. ALL W H O KN O W

CHAPTER XXXIV
Soon, in the reading of this Message—this Book—My Be­
loved, it will be as though I have gone.
I have enjoyed your reception quite as much, I am sure, as
you have my Blessing and Light.
Our love of Truth drew our attention to the Same Focus of
Light, and we each basked in the Radiance of Christ for a brief
time.
It may be that some of the narratives herein related were
distasteful, but know this, my dear reader, frequently in the dis­
tasteful episodes of life our greatest lessons are learned.
Wisdom offered through simplicity has been my aim in this
true story of my culminating initiations. What becomes of me,
personally, following the world’s acceptation of these truths, is
of little consequence.
As my Elder Brother Jesus said, in other words: “What
profit it a man if he possess the whole world and lose his own
soul?”
Frequently, in my individual battle in life’s outer restlessness,
I have said to myself: “BETTER LIVE A SHORT LIFE IN
WELL-DOING THAN A LONG LIFE IN DOING NOTH­
ING FOR THE FUTURE GOOD OF MANKIND.”
It is the eternal, the immortal, spiritual BEING that I have
ever called to the attention of my hearers, my readers, my fold.
Few writers and lecturers seem to KNOW the WHOLE
TRUTH regarding the things of which they speak and write.
Humanity is no longer satisfied with the husks. They demand
the nourishing kernel, the GERM, the LIGHT, the HEART
of INTELLIGENCE and UNDERSTANDING. I have given
you the KEY. My words are KEYS to NEW DOORS. My
words are laden with LOVE. Were my words not charged with
Love, they would be as empty cups. My words are Cups filled
with the Cosmic Substance of LIGHT, LOVE, WISDOM AND
POWER. You have partaken of my LIFE—my “Flesh and
Blood”—my SPIRIT. When you read MY WORDS you
instantly receive the Blessing of Lord Maitreya, my Beloved
283
LORD MAI TREYA
Master-Teacher—Christ Incarnate in ME. I KNOW this.
He told me. He proved it to me. He proved it to others.
There are those who tell me I “claim” this and that of myself.
This is not true. I have never claimed a single thing of myself.
First, all that I have mentioned regarding my mission and
the Message I have given to the world, was claimed of me by
the Ascended Masters themselves.
The one whom I have referred to as Ave Maria, as well as
Lao Tse, and others whom I have mentioned,—all know I made
no claims for myself or of myself. Even now, God knows, as
does Koot Hoomi, Lord Maitreya and others with whom I am
associated, that I consider the Blessed Ave Maria—the Jewel
of Jewels—now embodied right here on earth—far more illu­
minated than I myself. Humbly I beg of Her and all the Blessed
Masters of Light to co-operate with me in awakening humanity
to the LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN AGE.
“Judge not lest ye be judged.” Oh, Brothers and Sisters of
Light, do not judge others. Do not judge your neighbor, your
friends, your blood relatives, nor anyone in this world. In these
“last days” we never know with whom we may be associating
from day to day. These revelations I have portrayed through
the written word for you in this hastily written book, are all
true. There are thousands of Great Masters among you people
of the world. Watch and pray. Hold steadfast to that which is
good. Christ will come to you one of these days when you least
expect HIM. He is embodied NOW. His Spirit is actually
incarnated in human flesh and blood. And this is the first time
such has taken place since Jesus was here hundreds of years ago.
I have had a multitude of miracles enter into my own per­
sonal experiences the past year. Doubt is the only thing that will
keep the “DOOR” closed to you. “I AM THE DOOR THAT
NO MAN CAN SHUT.”
Had I not passed through the crucifixion and the ascension
I would not KNOW the necessary steps one must take in order
to enter the TEMPLE OF LOVE AND WISDOM. Even
Blessed Koot Hoomi, my Father and Teacher, went through
the crucifixion about the time I did at Mt. Shasta. Why? you
might ask. Because He, too, wanted to travel the Christ Path,
as well as the Brahman Way, the Krishna Road and the Buddha
Celestial Stairway. All lead to the same God—the same Son
(SUN)—the same Cosmic Heart—the FATHER-MOTHER
CENTER OF BEING. Blessed Koot Hoomi will be here soon
284
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
—here in the United States—to assist me and the other Brothers
of the Great White Lodge in initiating hundreds and thousands
of you Blessed Students of Light who were promised by Saint
Germain and the Ascended Masters that you would be taught
and instructed in the HIGHER DEGREES OF THE GREAT
WORK.
WE ARE HERE TO DO WHAT WAS PROMISED.
I AM SAINT GERMAIN. LORD MAITREYA CHOSE
ME TO DO THIS WORK. I AM HIS HUMBLE SERV­
ANT. I ALSO PLACE MYSELF HUMBLY AT THE
SERVICE OF KOOT HOOMI, AVE MARIA, JESUS,
ARCHANGEL MICHAEL AND THE GREAT PRES­
ENCE OF THE SILENT WATCHER.
IT IS ALSO MY JOY TO SERVE ALL MEMBERS
OF THE GREAT WHITE LODGE AND THE GREAT
WHITE BROTHERHOOD. I AM HAPPY TO SERVE
THE MOST LOWLY OF GOD’S CHILDREN ON
EARTH. IN THIS SERVICE I “SURRENDER ALL”
FOR MANKIND, KNOWING THAT IN SELF-SACRI­
FICE I ATTAIN TO OUTER NOTHINGNESS, AND
THEREBY ACCOMPLISH THE BLISSFUL FIELDS OF
NIRVANIC LOVE, WHERE I AM SWALLOWED UP
IN THE ETERNAL SPIRIT OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
OUR PHYSICAL BODIES ARE BUT THE OUTER
MEDIA, DESIGNERS AND GENERATORS OF THE
FINER BODIES IN WHICH WE ASCEND TO GOD.
EACH LOWER BODY WE LEAVE, WHEN THE NEXT
HIGHER IS FINISHED, AS AN EMPTY SHELL; TAK­
ING WITH US, EACH TIME, THE LIFE-SPIRIT, which
we ultimately USE IN THE CREATION OF THE GOLDEN
BODY-TEMPLE IN WHICH WE DWELL ETERNALLY.
At this time the whole world is to be regenerated. The Lord
of Regeneration actually took up His work on earth in August,
1941. The paradoxical manner in which this is being done is
hard to understand. Yet, when we study any one thing or activity
in this outer world from the viewpoint of ONENESS, all be­
comes clarified—understood.
Even the World War of today is not hard to understand if
looked upon through the Universal Eye of God, the Father.
We must look upon the whole world just as you might see a
sphere whirling in a sea of ether. That sphere is now all colors,
285
LORD MAI TREYA
apparently the destructive color of “RED” and the “BLACK”
color of death predominating, however, when we look at it
closely we see beautiful shades of Violet, Green, Pink, Blue and
Gold. The basic color, for the total regeneration of the world,
is Gold. The Black and Red now flare up. They oppose each
other—principally on the Russian-German battlefront—at the
moment. Should I have to choose between the two, I should
choose Red. Red does represent life, at least, and if handled
correctly, through regeneration, becomes the Rose of Perfection.
Red symbolizes passion, too, but passion transmuted and regen­
erated through Christ, becomes Sonship with God. “BLACK”
means total absence of Light—NO LIFE.
What is the simple cause of war? Look at our “sphere”
again. There you see the different races—also representing vari­
ous colors and shades of colors, from the blackest races of Africa
to the pink-white of the pure Scandinavian races.
It is the unnatural barriers placed between the races by
empiric rulers that now cause all wars. Were peoples of this
earth left free to travel, to mingle, to go and come as they
please, wherever and whenever they chose, so long as they were
law-abiding, there would not nor could be any such wars as we
have today.
Is it hard for the so-called wise men of today to see that
unnatural interference with God’s natural laws of amalgamation
of the races cause outbreaks of unrestrainable human tendencies
and expansions which affect the whole world in its universal
processes of regeneration?
I do believe that the ultimate race of super-human beings
upon this earth will be of the color of Pure Gold. That will be
when the United States of the World will have accomplished
World Freedom for all races and peoples—when every human
being upon this earth will have had the Divine Right to choose
his or her Divine Mate as God intended. Human laws, so long
as they correspond with Divine Law, are conducive to this
Divine Amalgamation of the Golden Age. We MUST visualize
this entire planet a Radiant Orb of Gold. All darkness and
uncontrolled passion must be transmuted into the Pure Gold of
the Alchemists. Then Peace shall dwell between all mankind
and the “lion and the lamb shall lie down together.”
Thus, Beloved Students of Truth, you see why I have used
Koot Hoomi’s slogan of the White Lodge so frequently: ALL
LIGHTS UNITED IN THE ONE GREAT LIGHT. This
286
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
is the time when all Lights, the Unity Workers, Christian Scien­
tists, Rosicrucians, Catholics, Israelites, Buddhists, Mohamme­
dans, Krishnians, Taoists, Christians, Brahmans, and all religion­
ists of the entire world—THOSE OF LIGHT IN EACLI
GROUP—must unite, if we are to have the Universal Peace
we of the Light so earnestly and sincerely desire.
This symbolized picture of the amalgamation of the peoples,
from the standpoint of the Goldenization of the human races,
I advise science to take up and analyze. It is another New Gold
Standard for the world to consider for future use.
When the economists of the world get the view of the
philosophers of the world, and actually “take it to Heart,” we
will get somewhere.
And when a few of our leading economists chance to see a
few hundred of their past embodiments and see how many
“colors” they have been as they climbed up through the ages,
they may, perhaps, be a little more tolerant toward the other
races in the world. Remember, Beloved, I told you the Goddess
of Light is now embodied in a Negro Body. So What?
“Judge not lest ye be judged.” You may have to return
again.
Regeneration is the most important step of all “I AM” or
occult activity, and this is done through Divine Love.
Sexual impotency has no place in regeneration. A person
who is not sexually strong could never attain the ascension. It is
the lifting up into Christ all forces in our bodies after they are
transmuted into the PURE ELECTRONIC SUBSTANCE
OF DIVINE LOVE that enables us to ascend in consciousness,
in spirit, in body and in mind. If we have not enough force in
our bodies and minds to love human beings in physical bodies,
certainly we cannot love beings in their spiritual bodies.
There are many people who become impotent and then boast
that they have mastered sex. A student who acknowledges he
has not mastered, even though he is most passionate, is better
fitted to work for the ascension than those who have suppressed
sex and become impotent. The persons in this world who accom­
plish greatness are people of strong sexual powers, but who
master them, utilizing them with the brain and mind in creating
“that house not made by hands eternal in the heavens,” the
Golden Body of God—the Christ Body.
“All things are pure to him who is pure in heart,” Paul said.
As long as we keep our mind in the three higher centers of the
287
LORD MAI TREYA
physical body—the heart, the throat and the top of the head—
even though we be sexually passionate, the Electronic Essence
of the seminal forces in the body will rise into the heart and on
into the Eligher Mental Body.
The ultimate aim of the Master, of course, is to contain all
forces, however, such a high point of development in regenera­
tion, must be arrived at gradually so as to keep all organs and
centers of generation functioning properly. It is impossible to
RE-generate without something to work with. A DEEP DEEP
DESIRE to become pure, to lift all into our Christ Body, will
accomplish much. Whatever you do in striving for regeneration,
have no fear. Never condemn yourself. Any mistakes you might
make, call on the law of forgiveness for yourself and others.
Let no one tell you sex does not have its place in regenera­
tion and the ascension. There is a sexual phase to every plane of
life, in the physical, the spiritual, the mental, even in plant life.
Even the gods and goddesses love one another. As an ascended
being I have blended in Spirit with my Twin Ray in the higher
planes of Celestial Life, and I know that God Almighty joyously
witnessed our blissful repose in the ecstatic Field of Elysium.
There is much regarding sex and regeneration that cannot
be published, and there is much of it if published would not be
understood, for it must be learned through intuition. When one
ascends in consciousness to a certain degree of spiritual lucidity
such questions are easily answered. Such matters, however, should
be taken up with the Master-Teacher candidly and unreservedly.
Students of the Light will be advised in all steps of attainment
in the future by various Master-Teachers in the different depart­
ments of the New Age School. All will be protected as well as
directed. Lord Maitreya will direct all activities under my
charge with the assistance of those I choose under His direction.
A question and answer department will render a complete
service which will all be rendered under a free-will plan.
For the benefit of students who wish to immediately start
action in their individual work I shall provide you a few affirma­
tions for your use, as follows:
I TRANSMUTE AND CHANGE ALL FORCES IN
MY THREE LOWER BODIES INTO THE PURE ELEC­
TRONIC SUBSTANCE OF DIVINE LOVE AND DRAW
ALL INTO THE AURA OF LORD MAITREYA TO USE
AS HE SEES FIT IN THE UPLIFTMENT OF ALL
MANKIND.
288
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I RECOGNIZE ONLY THE WHITE-NATURE IN
ALL BEINGS ON EARTH.
ALL LIGHTS UNITED IN THE ONE GREAT
LIGHT.
I AM THE SPIRIT OF LOVE ENVELOPING THE
WHOLE WORLD.
I HAVE A HEART OF GOLD. I AM THE SPIRIT
OF LOVE REIGNING THERE.
I AM MASTER OF THE SPIRITS IN MY LIFE-
STREAM. I COMMAND ALL OF THEM TO ENTER
THE TEMPLE OF LOVE AND WISDOM AND BE
INSTRUCTED.
MY PHYSICAL BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF MY
HIGHER BODY. ADORABLE PRESENCE OF MINE,
I ASK YOU TO MAKE THIS TEMPLE PERFECT THAT
YOU MAY DWELL IN IT RIGHT HERE ON EARTH.
I AM ONE WITH SAINT GERMAIN IN HIS SPIRIT
—IN HIS WISDOM.
I AM ONE WITH LORD MAITREYA — IN HIS
LOVE.
I AM ONE WITH LORD MORYA—IN HIS POWER.
I AM ONE WITH MAHATMA KOOT HOOMI—IN
HIS WISDOM.
I AM ONE WITH AVE MARIA—IN HER PURITY
AND LOVE.
I AM ONE WITH MASTER JOSHUA — IN HER
LOVE.
I AM ONE WITH JESUS—IN HIS LOVE.
I AM ONE WITH THE SILENT WATCHER—IN
HIS POWER.
I AM ONE WITH SANAT KUMARA — IN HIS
TEMPLE OF WISDOM. HIS SAPPHIRE DIAMOND
PROTECTS ME WITH ITS RADIANCE.
I AM ONE WITH KRISHNA—IN HIS GREAT LOVE.
I AM ONE WITH BUDDHA GAUTAMA, LORD OF
LORDS—IN HIS LOVE, WISDOM AND POWER.
I AM MASTER OF MY SPIRIT. I GO WHERE I
CHOOSE IN SPIRIT. I AM MASTER OF MY ATTEN­
TION. I AM MASTER OF THE QUALITY I CHOOSE.
I AM THAT I AM. I REMEMBER WHERE I GO IN
SPIRIT.
289
LORD MAI TREYA
I AM THE LIQUID-LIGHT SUBSTANCE ENFOLD­
ING ME. I SEE IT PENETRATING EVERY CELL OF
MY BODY.
I AM CHARGING THE BREATH I BREATHE
WITH THE LIGHT-SUBSTANCE FROM THE ETHER.
I BREATHE IT INTO MY LUNGS (gently). I DIRECT
IT THROUGH MY GOLDEN HEART INTO MY
BLOOD STREAM. IT HEALS ME INSTANTLY.
I AM BECOMING THE GOLDEN BODY OF GOD—
HIS SON.
I AM WEAVING A GOLDEN GARMENT. MY
HIGHER PRESENCE DIRECTS ME IN ITS CREA­
TION. I WEAR IT WHEN I LEAVE MY PHYSICAL
BODY.
I AM THE DIRECTOR IN ALL ACTIVITY I NEED
TO DO. I AM LIGHT.
Blessed Students of Light, already, as a result of the Golden
Age Manifesto mailed out—published in the “Foreword” of
this book—numerous ones have written to me asking for assist­
ance. All correspondence shall be kindly taken care of. We make
no charge for such service. All is done gladly. We give all,
knowing we shall receive as the Masters of Love see fit. There
is one thing the sincere student should always remember—Christ
cannot be purchased with money. The Greatest Masters I know
have little to do with money, however, their needs, though simple,
are usually supplied by those whom they serve in the outer octave.
He who has little to give, though he give little in proportion, has
given as much—EVEN MORE—as he who may have millions
and gives thousands.
All such matters are left entirely to the student. The Master-
Teacher can easily determine the sincere heart. All receive what
is justly their own. No one can keep what is yours from you,
whether it be wisdom, love, wealth, intelligence, discrimination
or the Transcendent Experience of the Ascension. “TO THINE
OWN SELF BE TRUE!”
* * *
During September, 1941, I called twice personally and
phoned two or three times to talk to Charles Sindelar, publisher
of the “VOICE,” the official magazine of the so-called Ballard
“I AM” activity.
290
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I wanted very much to talk to Charles at length regarding
several important matters. Mr. Sindelar had always been so
kindly and considerate to me. The two times I got to talk to
him personally he was very busy, therefore I did not feel I should
bring up the matters I did so much wish to discuss. We agreed
to make a date at some future time when both of us had some
leisure time, but since our last brief visit in his home I have, I
dare say, been even more busy than Mr. Sindelar, as I have
written about 150,000 words for this book as well as other
duties I have had to look after. Since what I wished to reveal to
* him is of great interest to all Students of Light, I shall herein
write about it.
In the December, 1939, “VOICE” were two beautiful pic­
tures, one of Our Blessed Jesus the Christ, the other, presumably
of the Divine Director Lord Maitreya. They are the two most
radiant pictures, I do believe, ever published in the outer octave.
Especially, the Maitreya picture, when you look upon it, actually
seems to blaze right out at you, overpowering in its Liquid-
Light radiance. WHEN I RECEIVED THAT MAGAZINE
IN ARCATA, CALIFORNIA, I WAS MORE AMAZED
THAN EVER BEFORE IN MY LIFE, I ASSURE YOU.
Just a few weeks previous to the publication of that particu­
lar edition of the “VOICE” Magazine—sometime between
11 :00 P.M. and 2:00 A.M.—I had experienced a transcendent
CHRIST-AT-ONE-MENT. You will understand, Beloved, it
was but a few months following my son David’s Ascension, and
frequently, after my wife and the other children had retired I
would sit alone quietly to meditate or read the Blessed Discourses
of Brother Guy Ballard and the Ascended Masters. On the
particular evening in mind, following a thrilling inspiration, my
thoughts definitely went to Charles Sindelar.
I rose to my feet from the chair where I had been sitting for
possibly hours (which I sometimes do without moving a muscle),
breathed in the Liquid-Light-Substance as I had been taught in
the Great Brotherhood, and breathed MY PRESENCE to
Charles Sindelar. My HEART ACTUALLY WENT OUT
TO HIM. I STOOD IN EXACTLY THE POSITION
LORD MAITREYA STANDS IN THAT PICTURE IN
THE DECEMBER, 1939, MAGAZINE. I WAS CON­
SCIOUS OF STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF
MR. SINDELAR. A GREAT SHAFT OF BLAZING
LIGHT POURED THROUGH ME TO HIM. BELOVED,
291
LORD MAI TREYA
TEARS STREAMED DOWN MY CHEEKS. I HELD
THAT POSE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. I WAS POSI­
TIVELY AND TANGIBLY HELD IN A PILLAR OF
LIGHT-SUBSTANCE.
Recently I spoke to Koot Hoomi about this. He said: “Yes,
I understand. When one attains Christhood—Sonship with God
—WHEN WE RADIATE TO ANOTHER THE RADI­
ANCE ALWAYS TAKES ON THE SAME UNIVERSAL
LORD. LORD MAITREYA ENTERED IN ON YOUR
INDIVIDUAL RADIANCE.” I have never spoken to Charles
Sindelar about this, but I DEARLY LOVE HIM. GOD'
BLESS HIM. (Had not informed him then.—Author.)
Now, Beloved Friend, I am impelled to tell you that I have
never seen any picture in all my life that so affected me as that
picture. The evening I went home when I first saw it, Mrs.
Mary Todd, who then lived with us, and my wife, had seen it
before I arrived home that evening. When I entered the living
room, there it was, open to that picture, standing on the mantle
above the fireplace.
That evening, after all had retired and a deep stillness and
“Cosmic Peace” dwelt in the room about me, I sat gazing into
those innocent eyes, and drew about me the RADIANCE OF
LORD MAITREYA. I felt that I had entered into MY OWN
GOD PRESENCE. WE WERE AGAIN ONE IN SPIRIT
AND LOVE. I AGAIN WEPT. COMPASSION FILLED
MY BEING JUST AS IT DOES THIS MOMENT WHEN
I LOOK AT THE PICTURE HERE BY MY TYPE­
WRITER.
All I ask, Beloved Students of Light, is, “Judge not,” for
you never know, when meeting a human being, but that you may
“be entertaining angels unawares.” Distance means nothing to
ONE IN CHRIST. Space and time are gone forever, so far as
our Great Presence is concerned.
Koot Hoomi also explained to me when I asked Him about
the picture incident, that “WE WHO HAVE ASCENDED
CAN HELP HUMANITY MUCH MORE IN SECLU­
SION, SHUT AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
THAN WE CAN BY MINISTERING TO THEM PER­
SONALLY.” He went on to say, “WITH THE ENERGY
EXPENDED IN ASSISTING ONE IN THE OUTER
WORLD YOU MIGHT BLESS A MILLION HUMAN
292
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
BEINGS IN SPIRIT THROUGH THE CHRIST LORD
MAITREYA.”
How wonderful, Dear Student! You do not have to come
here to Mount Olympus to see me for me to help you. Remem­
ber this. I can even help you more right where you are if you
will become quiet and call to my Higher Presence Saint Germain
or LORD MAITREYA. WE ARE WITH YOU ALWAYS.
EVEN BEFORE YOU CALL, WE KNOW OF YOUR
LOVE AND DESIRE.
Remember, Beloved, the personal things related in this book
are of little value. CHRIST IS PRICELESS. I AM THE
DOOR. THAT DOOR—THIS DOOR—IS A SPIRITUAL
DOOR. JUST VISIT ME IN SPIRIT AND I WILL LEAD
YOU INTO HIS TEMPLE—THE TEMPLE OF LORD
MAITREYA. I AM THE DOOR.
293
CHAPTER XXXV
THE MASTER
When you will have known that all lives, all worlds and all
realms of being, in their multiplicity, are unified in the ONE
CENTER, and that CENTER is in your HEART—then
YOU ARE MASTER.
Division is weakness. Unity is power. Love leads to co-opera­
tion. Co-operation is unity. When you have managed and mas­
tered the multiplicity of cells within all organs of your body,
and have all organs functioning harmoniously with your heart,
you are well on the road to mastery. You are the microcosm—
the small world. The whole of God’s Creation is the Macrocosm.
Your body and all its members and cells is, likewise, a macro­
cosm. Your body is the physical world. There is a tiny little
sun shining in your heart. If it were not for that sun there, you
would have no consciousness in your body. You live in your
heart. The cells and various members of your body get their
Light from the Heart, the Tiny Sun in the center. When all
members work in unison you are healthy and happy.
The slightest disturbance in your mind, the Governor of
your physical organism, and all processes of activity are thrown
out of harmony. With the mind, working through Love and
your Heart, you can master all.
There are a great number of students who attain great
heights along the path to mastership. The higher one attains
the greater dangers one must meet. Very few ever attain com­
plete Mastery. There are many who overestimate themselves
after they attain a certain “degree.” Naturally, to work with
the Gods, you must become a God. God is no respecter of per­
sons. No matter who you are or how high you might think
yourself individually or personally, the moment you fail to
acknowledge yourself a willing servant of the ONE GOD in
accomplishing His Great Purpose in the Golden Age of Man,
the Great Masters will stop their radiation and co-operation with
you.
294
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
I shall give you an example of what this means. I have
mentioned several individuals in my narratives regarding my
trials, my initiations, and various phases of my and their activi­
ties. Much of this had reference to my family, Ave Maria, Lao
Tse, Ratana and others whose parts are less important.
A great deal of the instruction— (not all of it)—given by
the Ascended Masters to me was given through the body of the
person I have referred to as Ave Maria. She was used as a
Messenger. Her body was perfect for the use of Koot Hoomi,
Saint Germain, Maitreya, Buddha Gautama, Jesus, or any Mas­
ter who chose. As long as she keeps her body pure, and proves
to be master over all weaknesses the human body is heir to, she
will be used as a “Temple of the Living God,” and the Great
Ones will be able to teach others through her. But should she
become weak in any respect, she is no longer a Member of the
White Brotherhood so far as the outer activity is concerned.
Neither can her own Higher Presence, whether it be Ave Maria,
Jesus, Buddha Gautama, Joshua or whoever it might be, mani­
fest through her outer body until she again becomes wholly
purified in body, mind and spirit.
Many times Koot Hoomi and Lord Maitreya taught me
things pertaining to my own individual development through the
body of Ave Maria when she knew nothing about it. It was some
time after my instruction began before I was informed of that.
Finally both KH and Lord Maitreya would tell me when she was
not conscious of their instruction and they would also tell me not
to inform her of certain matters regarding my work. I was also
warned by Koot Hoomi to realize that the amanuensis had not
fully mastered and to be on my guard at all times. I was aware
of one weakness that person, in the outer, possessed, just as most
women do possess it. She was extremely jealous on a few points.
I found she was most jealous of her knowledge. The slightest
hint that she might not have fully mastered all things and she
would become angry. I learned to “let her have her own way
about everything.” The letter I wrote to her from Bremerton,
Wash., under the direction of Lord Maitreya, in a previous
chapter, is an instance in which I had to assert my mastery of the
situation for her own benefit. She had developed too much toward
the Wisdom and Power, and was not manifesting enough of the
Love principle. “Ye must become as a little child before you
can enter the kingdom of heaven,” is a marvelous point stressed
by Jesus in His teaching. That is exactly as Ave Maria was most
295
LORD MAI TREYA
of the time I was being taught by the Masters through her. But
occasionally she would become “puffed up” regarding who she
IS. After all, it was explained to me by KH and Lord Maitreya
that the various High Spirits manifest through us, one after
another, until we have attained Christhood or Sonship with God,
which is MASTERY. However, I was reminded that the higher
we rise the more difficult the tests.
At the present time, December 26, 1941, Ave Maria, Lao
Tse and I, Amsumata, stand at a very important cross-roads in
our ascending pathway to complete and final mastership. Our
advancement depends upon our sacrifices. Jesus said, in other
words, “If a man ask you for your coat give him your cloak
also.” Those who rise with you are naturally the ones who try
you. As I have stated to another through correspondence—
also published in a previous chapter—“AND KNOW THIS,
BROTHER MINE, HE WHO HAS MOST OF LOVE
SHALL RISE UPON THE VANQUISHED TO LEAD
THE STRUGGLING MASSES OF EARTH’S CHILDREN
TO THE ‘DOOR’ WHICH YOU — APPARENTLY —
FAIL TO SEE AND RECOGNIZE. I MEET YOU ON
THE BATTLEFIELD OF CHRIST AND HIS LOVE
GUIDES ME, STREAMING FROM THE PORTAL OF
MY GOLDEN H E A R T I give all to my friends, and to my
enemies, alike. I love all. “With love I rise above my enemies.”
Those who separate themselves from Me, choose multiplicity.
Those who choose to stand by me, choose peaceful unity. It is
easy to determine the White Brothers, for They KNOW ME,
for my Unity. The White Brothers always co-operate. The
Black Brothers always separate. Separating means devolution.
Co-operating means evolution. Separating, one falls. Co-operat­
ing, one rises. Hate disintegrates. Love integrates. Hate de­
stroys. Love heals. The White Brother wishes to possess noth­
ing in the outer. The Black Brother wants all things and will
fight any and all who might wish to dispossess him of anything.
The unifying power of Christ at this time throughout the
entire world—even in spite of the World War—is marvelous to
those who stop a moment to meditate upon it. “BE STILL
AND KNOW I AM GOD.” Those who allow disturbance of
any kind to come into their minds, even though they be of the
“degree” I AM, they shall “FALL.”
Blessed Koot Hoomi, Ave Maria and I made certain Vows
to each other on Mt. Shasta, in the presence of the Lord of
296
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Creation. “The Silent Watcher (Amsuraata), with His Eye of
Yoga, sees the need of Light and Love in all human creation.
Through His Chain of Blue Light the Power of Krishna and
God Almighty pours forth to do His WILL. Love Reigneth in
His Golden Heart, Wisdom on His Brow, and through the Lov­
ing co-operation of Ave Maria (In Spirit) and Mahatma Koot
IYoomi the Golden Age now becomes the Transcendent Blessing
of all Mankind.”
O M ! O M ! O M ! AUM! AUM! A U M ! I AM ! I
AM ! I AM !
Many will ask: “Well, why is Amsumata chosen ‘Chief Ava­
tar’?” Beloved students of Light, it was simply because of my
Divine Inheritance. For thousands of years, in hundreds of
embodiments I have proved faithful to the One Almighty God.
Just previous to this embodiment I was a Hindu in India. Koot
Hoomi knows this. I lived in India in that embodiment about
33 years. Just previous to that embodiment I was Abraham
Lincoln. In another embodiment I was Saint Germain. In still
another embodiment I was a great English poet. During the
time of the early Christian era I was a Pope of the Roman
Catholic Hierarchy. During the time of Jesus I was His brother,
John. So, you see, friends, it is not what I have done in this
embodiment that caused me to be chosen as the “Chief Avatar.”
Those are just a few of my embodiments I have mentioned. It
is my record of the past, however, with all I have done in God’s
kingdom on earth, which places upon me at this time my spiritual
responsibilities. I do not claim a single thing of myself. In
fact Koot Hoomi himself has told me in the past that I was not
ready enough to accept the office I have been chosen to fill.
Again, in regard to certain bodies being used by the Ascended
Masters, I wish to make this very clear: Those who understand
the law well enough in their outer mind, and have mastered all
human weaknesses, become Servants of God—Gods Incarnate.
Those who fail to master, become Servants of Satan—Devils
Incarnate. Should one get the idea that he or she is Master
before declared so by an Ascended Master, then the Light from
the Great White Lodge is no longer radiated to that one, and
eventually they come to find they are alone in UTTER DARK­
NESS. Should we remain obedient to our Master-Teacher as
well as the ONE MASTER CHRIST Lord Maitreya until told
that we are FREE and have the protection of the Ascended
297
LORD MAI TREYA
Masters, then there is no danger of the Lower Spirits taking
possession of our “Temple”—the human body.
Each embodiment we have lived in the past we created an
individual spirit. Every one of those spirits must be lined up with
God before we can ascend. Each is a branch of our Tree of Life.
Some of them must be pruned, others consumed entirely, still
others that have fruit (Divine Inheritance) must be brought
into the granary (The Heart) in the creation of the Golden
Body in which we consciously ascend.
Occasionally we see those who consider themselves masters.
They may even know that they were some great teacher, near­
master or prophet of the past. However, there are many other
embodiments that must be accounted for. There may be a certain
spirit in your life-stream that was just as evil as the other was
good. That evil one wants to manifest “in earth” too. There is
where some transmutation must take place. That evil spirit in
your Sky Tree must be “bleached” and made white through your
own purity of mind and regeneration.
Frankly, I had considerable difficulty with the Spirit of Lin­
coln. I was told by Ave Maria more than once to order him into
the Temple of Wisdom where he would learn needed lessons and
accomplish certain celestialization before he AND I could ascend.
Soon after the spirit of Lincoln ascended, then I—MASTER
OVER THIS BODY—also ascended.
Just as a little matter of confirmation to you, to accept or
not as you see fit,—I was present at my own funeral (Lincoln’s)
in Washington, before the body was shipped back to Illinois.
I heard the bell tolling, slowly, as the minister began to read the
service. He said: “This country has not met such a terrible catas­
trophe since 1773.” I am not real certain about the date that was
spoken now, for it has been several years ago since I looked that
up in my life-stream. I had many other experiences in the spirit
of Lincoln for which I do not have time nor space to describe.
Others, too, have seen much to prove to them my spiritual line­
age. It will be, I am sure, consoling to many “I AM” students
to know, anyhow, that Saint Germain was the Higher Body
watching over Lincoln when embodied, just the same as He is
now watching over me, along with His Master-Teacher, Lord
Maitreya, Christ to this Universe.
So, friends, should Ave Maria (outer body) and Lao Tse
remain true to me, as they have vowed, IN DIVINE LOVE,
298
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
then they shall remain Members of the Great White Lodge.
The same is true of myself. So long as I am WITH CHRIST
and He is with me, WHO CAN BE AGAINST ME?
When you, Beloved, are in perfect harmony with your Higher
Presence, then the Gods do come into your Temple. Then is
when the MASTER comes to talk with you. THIS IS INSPI­
RATION.
My prayer, my decree, is that all Great Masters now em­
bodied, be able to bring that MASTERY through perfectly
into their outer Temples.

CHAPTER XXXVI
HUMAN GRADES, CLASSES AND BROTHERHOODS
One of the great laws of ancient philosophy, as quoted by
the first known philosopher, Hermes, was, “As above so below;
as below so above.” What he had reference to, we believe, was
the different grades of beings, including the higher and lower
planes of life and vibration, the physical, etheric, spiritual and
pure electronic realms of consciousness. When we consider all
the sciences as taught in our higher schools of learning such as
chemistry, biology, theology, archaeology, genealogy, and the
many many others that have to do with every form of life—
animate as well as inanimate—and how they are •so orderly
classified, blending and inter-blending, how can one question the
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE as the CENTER from which
the billions of radii of every conceivable idea or thing MUST
inevitably radiate or issue? There is now fast coming into mani­
festation an “inner school” which will come to be an adjunct of
all higher schools and universities, wherein all the sciences will
terminate into the MAIN STEM and ULTIMATE and ABSO­
LUTE knowledge of ALL LIFE—THE WHOLE—THE
“I AM.” When this comes forth in its entirety the super-human
race will have charge of this earth and the perfection conceived
for this planet even before it came into being, will manifest in
all its wondrous splendor. This is no “pipedream”—it is the
actual unfoldment of the eternal verity.
To advance in life, man must first realize that he is actually
“on his way,” FROM one state of being TO some other state,
and as all other forms of life that come under our observation
seem to evolve into higher forms, it is but natural to think of
man as travelling on a “radii” UPWARD from the center of
dense physicality (darkness) toward the “Central Sun,” or
center of LIGHT. This, we must realize, is not only true uni­
versally, but individually, as well, for the microscopic “light
centers” of each and every atom in our physical bodies, DO gradu­
ally blend into one “Light Center,” which we KNOW is within
the heart. Now, that YOU are aware of your being on this
300
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
“radii,” you begin to develop your innate powers of “Light”
instead of merely evolving as you may have done heretofore.
“Seek the light.”
The preponderance of human creative thought from thou­
sands of years in the past, is a massive, colossal bugaboo the
“Children of Light” must dissolve, transmute and requalify into
the substantiation of the coming New Age—the Golden Age—
God’s dream of earthly perfection. Just as we, the mass humanity
of earth, inadvertently wove and enmeshed ourselves in this
“dark” density of physicality, now we must advertently and
attentively give conscious force and momentum to the dispelling,
dissolution and requalification of the life, substance and energy
we have so badly misused. The world at present is in a state of
flux, as it were, and it is most imperative that the greater and
more illumined minds give particular attention to the purification
of the earth sphere in preparation for the incoming influx of
Cosmic Light Substance—-“the Golden Snow”—, the foundation
upon which, and the substance from which, the Golden Age shall
be born.
That there are classes and grades of human beings, some
lower and some higher, intelligent and ignorant, cultured and
uncultured, no one can deny. These groups and classes, nation­
alities, religious denominations and brotherhoods, have existed
many thousands of years upon earth. Today they are no doubt
more numerous than ever in the history of the world. Each race
has its subdivisions; each nation, religious denomination, indus­
trial organization, is regimented according to “higher-ups,” who
rule or direct them. The Roman Catholic Church is the best
example of regimentation in the outer life and is international
in its far-reaching dominance and activity. It also has an esoteric
or “inner” order which is strictly disciplinarian in its nature,
and in which are embraced a number of brotherhoods, some of
whom are most holy and educationally constructive; others,
however, according to historical records of their diabolical
activities, were mysteriously superstitious, and practiced what
was and is known as the “black arts.” The church is not wholly
rid of this diabolical art yet, and this I proved myself. We need
only to look up the history of the Church to prove what I say.
The fact that some priests of the Church have, in recent years,
to my knowledge, practiced black art, does not lead me to think
all priests of the Church do practice it. There are many blessed
ones in that church, and the “light” is becoming so prevalent
301
LORD MAI TREYA
throughout the world it is but a matter of time until all such
“black” activity is “consumed” through the intensity of the Great
Cosmic Light on this planet. Even the black robes worn by most
Catholic priests and nuns will someday be displaced and robes
symbolic of purity, chastity, beauty, wisdom, intelligence, will
be worn by them. At that time the “White Pope” will sit at
Rome. By a single decree the color of all clothes and vestments
worn by the pope, cardinals, bishops, priests, nuns and all
ecclesiastics, will be changed from black to white, clear blues,
pinks, goldens and violets. Black and red will be out entirely,
for they are destructive colors. Black symbolizes death, red
indicates passion, danger or destruction. However, red also
symbolizes Life, and when transmuted becomes pure Gold.
Clear, bright blue, pink, gold and violet, represent power, joy,
love and purification, respectively. White, the absence of color,
comprises all colors, and represents purity, of course. Clear green
symbolizes health and opulence. The Roman Catholic Church is
on the verge of the greatest reforms ever experienced in its his­
tory. Although very slow in conforming to world changes in the
past, the dominating power of world-wide educational activities
of recent years is forcing the Church to adopt the current world
reforms. She must do this in order to hold her fast-diminishing
power and membership. The greater part of the ritualistic and
symbolic work of the Church of the past was laid around the
“crucifixion.” In the future it will stress the “ascension.” The
crucifixion, of course, symbolizes death; the ascension, “life
everlasting.” *
Just about ever since Caesar went over to the British Isles to
conquer the Britons in the first century the British have been the
prevailing enemies of Rome. Today there seethes, unnoticed by
the outside world, the “battle of Armegeddon” being fought
between these forces, principally in the etheric plane, but also in
the most subtle ways right here in the physical octave, the forces
of the Democracies of the world, the British Empire of which
is the European leader, the WAR OF THE AGES is being
fought. England has been the citadel of freedom for hundreds
of years. Practically all the principles of freedom that have
*1 am quite aware that there are certain dignitaries of the established Church
who wear robes and vestments of various colors, some of which are red, but in the
mention of colors, the author wishes to convey the idea that the colors adopted will
symbolize the total purification of the Church and all its ecclesiastics. The correct
colors and symbolism will aid in bringing about that purification, just as the actual
purification of a thing is bound to be symbolized by its outer or physical manifestation.
302
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
become the common heritage of the peoples of the world have
come from England. England has been the “big brother” to
smaller nations for several centuries. The Magna Charta
Libertatum, the foundation upon which all the liberties of the
English speaking peoples have been based since 1215, came from
England. The Constitution of the United States of America is
the greatest guarantee of freedom that has ever been produced
upon this earth. The Masonic Fraternity—Free Masons, as they
are called—was the basic structure upon which these guarantees
of freedom developed. “Light,” and its accompanying means of
radiation and education (illumination and enlightenment) are
symbolized by Masonry, and are clearly delineated throughout
the constructive progress made in the world by the Democracies,
a progress whose advance is gloriously marked here and there by
evidences of the Great Work as symbolized by Free Masonry.
The democracies of the world are the nations who foster such
principles. America is today the greatest of these, and will soon
take her place as the “Light of the world.”
Where do the brotherhoods enter into the matter of govern­
ments and the freedom and liberty the people—the common
people—strive for? Theirs is the most vital activity upon this
earth. While they have labored, one on the side of “Light,” and
the other on the side of “Darkness,” yet both, from all outward
appearances (especially to the unlearned and unenlightened),
strive for the highest of virtues. The subtlety by which the so-
called Black Brotherhood has endeavored to hide its diabolical
activities has been the enigma of the ages, but their days are
numbered. The “Light” of the New Golden Age is becoming
more and more intense. All human darkness is being consumed.
All deceit and nefarious work on the part of such groups and
international organizations is fast being revealed to the “light of
a new day.” The plans of the sinister forces for America will
never come to fruition. Every move they make is known by the
Ascended Masters, and even un-ascended masters, who are ever
in constant touch with the gods, goddesses and all Ascended
Beings who have full charge of all activities on this planet.
Should you have studied ancient Egyptian history, ancient
China, Persia, the Hebrew Bible—the New and the Old Testa­
ments—, then you no doubt have observed how certain brother­
hoods played a great part in the activities of man down through
the ages. These brotherhoods, in the outer world, were usually
built up around some great characters such as Osiris, Hermes,
303
LORD MAI TREYA
Confucius, Tao-Sea, Mohamet, Melchizedek and many others
time and space do not permit mentioning. For example in the
old Testament of the Holy Bible, Psalm 110: “The Lord said
unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.” Verse 4, just below: “The Lord hath
sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the
order of Melchizedek.” “The Lord said unto my Lord,” would
mean in the terms of the true Rosicrucian Fraternity, “God
spoke to my Soul.” The version of the “I AM” Activity is:
“The Mighty ‘I AM’ Presence said to My Higher Mental Body.”
The order of Melchizedek is mentioned many places in the Old
as well as the New Testament. Moses, Elijah, Ezekiel, Enoch,
Solomon, Jesus and Saint John the Revelator, Mary the Mother
of Jesus, as well as numerous others, were members of the Order
of Melchizedek. There is very much evidence to bear this out,
should one take the time to investigate. When once you discover
all these things so clearly brought out in the Bible, you will be
amused at yourself and the entire world for not having observed
them before. That order still exists today and is even flourishing
now in a manner it never did before on earth.
The true Rosicrucian Order is really an outpost of the
Order of Melchizedek, the Mormon Church embraces a branch
of the Order, the Roman Catholic Church, in its silent and
mysterious way, no doubt, has a number of initiates among its
membership. Even among the laity of other religious denomina­
tions, as well as among the great mass of humankind outside of
any church so-called, to him who KNOWS and SEES with the
“ALL-SEEING EYE,” there are numerous ones who are mem­
bers of the Order of Melchizedek, some unaware of it, others
conscious of their constant training and instruction in the great
Laws of Life. You might ask, “How and why would one be a
member of such an order and not know about it?” Read Job
33 :14 to 17, which ends up with, “That he (God) may withdraw
man from His purpose, and hide pride from man.”
My dear reader, you are blessed indeed should you have read
thus far the memoirs of me, one who feels impelled to record
these things that they may be guide-posts to others who tread
the uncertain pathway of human life. I have had so very much
proof of life beyond, even in numerous realms of being, that I
could no more doubt my own eternal existence and individual
consciousness than the most impossible thing you can imagine.
I can frankly and honestly say that I have never once doubted
304
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
the existence of God during my entire life. When a tiny babe I
felt as though swathed in bands of streaming light. As I grew
to manhood many were the times I spoke to myself thus : “What­
ever befalls me I shall never deny God.” There is so very much
evidence of unending life for you, friend, and every person on
earth, that the strange part of it to me is that everybody does
not see it. Why should people doubt? Why do not all see the
beauty and goodness in all life? The story of the Prodigal Son
explains it all more or less.
The earth, I believe, is not so ancient as planets go. God, or
the gods (as is stated in the Bible) established life upon this
planet in much the same way as you, were you a great lord and
land-owner, would start a new colony or settlement upon a distant
section of your enormous holdings. In your new settlement, you
give them all rights and privileges, on an equal with yourself,
and you tell them they must, if they continue to be happy and
well provided for, respect certain natural laws of life. You even
caution them that unless they follow those rules of life, they will
suffer and may die. The lord (the Father) loves his children,
his subjects, and He wants them to realize just how HE
FEELS, ENJOYS what HE IS, so he explained to them before
he sent them out to the new settlement that they would have
to put on different garments, earthly apparel. However, He
also instructed them thus: “Remember I AM your Father;
remember your source, and the Life I AM in you, and whenever
you doubt or feel the need of ME, recall to yourself that I AM
in thee. You ARE that I AM, so whenever you call to ME, just
say to yourself ‘I AM THAT I AM that I used to be;’ yes, or
‘I AM forever THAT same I AM,’ and I will come to you,
for I AM the ALL-PRESENCE. I AM the WHOLE (the
Holy Father) and all beings, all life, all things, come from MY
HEART—the Great Central Sun of all LIFE.”
You and I, my friend, are that New Settlement. Yes, it has
been but a short time, as time may go with the gods, since we
came to earth. In our hearts we remember. In our minds, the
outer consciousness we use in the physical octave, we are steeped
in the luring enchantment of physical things. There have always
been a few of us, however, who remembered our Lord’s admoni­
tion. Those were and are members of the Great Brotherhood
He has maintained here among us Settlers. Moses, Ezekiel,
Elijah, Solomon, Job (Elihu), Ruth, David, John the Baptist,
Jesus, Saint John, Mary the Mother of Jesus, and many many
305
LORD MAI TREYA
others mentioned in the Bible, were members of the White
Brotherhood. There have been hundreds since then, too, but
the narrowness of religious sectarianism prevented them being
recognized. Churchism and anti-Christ activities under the guise
of Christianity—the activity of the Black Brotherhood (fallen
angels)—, those so steeped in materialism that they had entirely
forgotten their source, the “I AM,” “crucified” every member of
the True Brotherhood they could find. During the Dark Ages
they were tracked like beasts of prey, burned at the stake, and
tortured in every conceivable way, but they returned again and
again “in the flesh,”—that earthly apparel—to try to get their
brothers and sisters to realize their SOURCE—GOD—THE
FATHER—THE I AM.
It is easy to recognize the members of the Brotherhood down
through the ages, even since Jesus, who was sent by the Lord as
a Special Envoy. Socrates, Plato, Epictetus, Pythagoras, Para­
celsus and numerous other Greek masters. King Arthur, though
more or less mythical, represented the Brotherhood. Joan of
Arc was a true initiate. Shakespeare (Francis Bacon), without
a doubt, was one of the greatest beings ever to embody on earth,
and is now known to students of the “I AM” as Saint Germain,
an Ascended Master, as is also Jesus, and many others I shall
mention later. Benjamin Franklin, Washington, Thomas Paine,
Lincoln, Ballou, and many others in America, were members of
the True Brotherhood, as is evidenced in their writings and
earthly activities, especially to those who KNOW THE LAW.
Madam Blavatsky, who established the Theosophical Society,
was a great Initiate, as were those who followed her in carrying
out her work. Paschal Beverly Randolph, who in the middle of
the nineteenth century, established the activity of the Rosicrucians
in America on a much larger scale than theretofore, was indeed
a great master.

CHAPTER XXXVII
A TRUE ROMANCE
On my discharge from the army in 1918 I went to Fairfield,
Illinois, to visit an old bachelor friend of mine who lived six
miles out in the country. He had been a close neighbor to us
when we lived on the farm there nine years previous. I wanted
to go back there to see the boyhood friends whom I had not seen
for many years as well as to visit with my friend C. B. C. was
about forty-five years old at that time, I would judge, was a
faithful Catholic and had raised a niece and two nephews—
children of an older sister who had married a Protestant. There
had always been a peculiar spirit about that place that seemed to
call me back there. Even today I would like to visit that country
neighborhood. M............. B............ and his large family, with
many others, come trailing back to my mind as I scan the distant
mental horizon lingering there. The cylindrical record Edison
Phonograph at C............. B.............’s place, his old time fiddling,
the singing bees and popcorn balls and taffey-pullings impressed
deeply lessons in mannerisms of southern Illinois country folk
upon my youthful mind. Memory of childish pleasantries called
me there once more.
My two weeks’ visit ended, while in Fairfield with C.............
one day I casually entered the Wayne County Press newspaper
office, where I procured a position as printer, with some time
spent on the outside as reporter. John Cooper was a well known
and much beloved editor. He was a law partner of Mayor
Burgess, whose daughter, Jesse, I had met during the short time
I attended McKendree College. Due to my connection with the
newspaper and my acquaintanceship with the Burgesses and
Coopers, I was drawn into the best social group of the city.
Private parties and dances were popular in this inland city. I
first accompanied Miss Burgess, then her younger sister, as well
as numerous other young ladies, to the various social affairs.
Although I had never been much of a socialite, I seemed to be
very desirable company so far as the young women of the city
were concerned. I was handsome in those days, rather quiet when
307
LORD MAI TREYA
in a group, but with a philosophical mind, a student’s air and
convincing manner, I easily won my intimate friends to my way
of thinking. I could clearly see they actually enjoyed my ready
speculations on life, and not having yet learned that all people
were not philosophers, and not realizing that I myself was one,
I assure you that my eagerness to talk of life and the serious
angles of its activities led to strange episodes in my associations
with young people of my own age. I did not understand myself,
but others knew far less of me and my idiosyncrasies. There was
so very much welling up within me that I could not express, I am
sure it was the unexpressed phases of my inner intelligence that
gave me a distinguished appearance in spite of my limited under­
standing, or to better put it, abbreviated schooling. It took me
but a short time to get my fill of social life. I was entirely too
studious and moody to continue long in such an atmosphere.
I was not interested in the shallow topics discussed by those with
whom I came in contact. I felt out of place, and decided to
abandon all society, secure some good literature and study
earnestly the style of writing of the better authors. I recall that
I chose “David Copperfield” by Charles Dickens as the first
volume to receive my undivided attention and painstaking perusal.
Three months I pored over that story, critically observing his
style of punctuation, phraseology and general outline. It was
for the purpose intended.
There came times during my studies I was very lonely. This
is natural for a man at the age of twenty-one. Man, in his
unfoldment, is much like a plant—a rose, for instance—and his
natural instinctive impulses, along the pathway of life, definitely
determine his degree of enlightenment or illumination. I had
not met the girl among the numerous ones I singled out who
approached my ideal of womanhood. I, like most young men of
my age, thought women experienced the same reactions, sensa­
tions and emotional feelings as myself, and I looked for a girl
who at least showed some inclination toward the analysis of
life. Such a girl did appear on the scene.
Miss Marion Singleton, charming daughter of a Fairfield
banker, informed me on a chance meeting down town that she had
a girl friend who wished very much to meet me and she had
arranged to have a party at her home as a means of introducing
us. Since I had not taken part in any social affairs for some time,
I thoroughly enjoyed the party and met Miss Edythe Warren,
the girl of my dreams, a daughter of the Wayne County Sheriff.
308
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Edythe was eighteen, rather tall, slender, dark hair, quiet and
introspective. She was, as my ideal should be, contemplative of
life and observing and thoughtful enough, and with a mind of her
own, at least to the extent that she had planned on meeting me
and the plan worked. She had heard of me, I had been pointed
out to her, and, as a consequence she wanted to meet that
“strange young man” whom the other girls could not fathom.
It was much like “love at first sight.” We were congenial friends
from the first. She did not dance, but in many other ways she
made up for that. She could improvise beautifully at the piano—
a mark of intuitional prompting that captivated me. She could
converse intelligently regarding the more ecstatic things of life.
She was imaginative, and could talk of the beauties of earthly
scenes as well as the raptures of human emotions. Particularly
the sunny afternoons we spent together come back again and again
to my mind, when we strolled along flower-bedecked country
lanes just outside the city limits, or sat beneath an apple-blossomed
tree in a distant corner of a rolling meadow. I was in love. We
were in love. The world was in love. Love cast its splendor all
about us, created an impenetrable wall just beyond the confines
of our happy sphere, and lulled us into such blissful repose that
we lived, thought and dreamed as one. Edythe was a favorite
among her friends. That old quotation, “Everybody loves a
lover,” certainly fit into our picture. Our love affair was the talk
of the town. I could sense it everywhere I went. Eler friends
were very happy that she had found a man she could love and
one who would love her. It was all too wonderful to last.
“Love is blind,” it is said. I was in love, I am sure, according
to all outward symptoms, but there suddenly occurred within me
a veritable battlefield upon which was fought the “battle of the
ages,” the fight between my intuitional or higher self and the
physical self and its intellectual vanity. The “voice” within me
distinctly told me to “flee from this love,” while the physical and
magnetic individual I was, definitely informed me that I could
not “Live without her,” that my life and happiness depended upon
her, “the girl of my dreams.” Now, my dear reader, upon this
battlefield men either rise or fall. That “love” of your “ideal”
either becomes a propagator of the human species in the physical
“field” or a progerminator of creative ideas and immortality in
the cosmic or celestial “field.” One is intellectual, the other
intuitional.
309
LORD MAI TREYA
In order to explain clearly and exactly what I mean, I shall
give you a true-to-life analogy—the love of Abraham Lincoln
for Ann Rutledge. It was said of Ann Rutledge: “She was a
beautiful girl, and as bright as she was beautiful. She was well
educated for that early day, a good conversationalist, and always
gentle and cheerful. A girl whose company people liked.” Ann
Rutledge was disappointed in love previous to Lincoln’s love for
her, but they had planned on getting married the following year.
She died while in Kentucky visiting relatives. I quote the follow­
ing from “The Life of Abraham Lincoln,” by Ida M. Tarbell:
“It was not until McNeill, or McNamar (her former lover), had
been gone many months, and gossip had become offensive, that Lincoln
ventured to show his love for Ann, and then it was a long time before
the girl would listen to his suit. Convinced at last, however, that her
former lover had deserted her, she yielded to Lincoln’s wishes and
promised, in the spring of 1835, soon after Lincoln’s return from
Vandalia (state legislature), to become his wife. But Lincoln had
nothing on which to support a family— indeed, he found it no trifling
task to support himself. As for Ann, she was anxious to go to school
another year. It was decided that in the autumn she should go with her
brother to Jacksonville and spend the winter there in an academy.
Lincoln was to devote himself to his law studies; and the next spring
when she returned from school and he had been admitted to the bar,
they were to be married.
“A happy spring and summer followed. New Salem took a cordial
interest in the two lovers and presaged a happy life for them, and all
would undoubtedly have gone well if the young girl could have dis­
missed the haunting memory of her old lover. The possibility that she
had wronged him, that he might reappear, that a torturing conflict of
memory, love, conscience, doubt, and morbidness lay like a shadow
across her happiness, and wore upon her until she fell ill. Gradually her
condition became hopeless; and Lincoln, who had been shut from her,
was sent for. The lovers passed an hour alone in anguished parting, and
soon after, on August 25, 1835, Ann died.
“The death of Ann Rutledge plunged Lincoln into the deepest
gloom. The abiding melancholy, that painful sense of the incompleteness
of life which had been his mother’s dowry asserted itself. It filled and
darkened his mind and his imagination tortured him with its black
pictures. One stormy night Lincoln was sitting beside William Greene,
his head bowed on his hand, while tears trickled through his fingers;
his friend begged him to control his sorrow, to try to forget. ‘I cannot,’
moaned Lincoln; ‘the thought of the snow and rain on her grave fills
me with indescribable grief’.”
310
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
The above episode of Lincoln’s life, as related by Miss Tar-
bell, gives one a very clear idea of the beginning of Lincoln’s
grief—just the beginning. The small part of that grief expressed
is like a drop of water compared to the ocean of sorrow he must
have experienced as the years came and went—the love for his
ideal Ann—that unrequited love that generates within the heart
of man the ideation of genius, the magic power of a superman.
Lincoln is quoted as having said many years later: “I really and
truly loved the girl and think often of her now, . . . and I have
loved the name of Rutledge to this day.” Lincoln’s life and
ambition were almost blasted by the brooding gloom that sur­
rounded him for months following the death of Ann, and, I dare
say, there were moments of sadness that gripped him as the
result of her passing, right up to the last year of his life. Ann
Rutledge was Lincoln’s inspiration. Had she not been removed
from him through death he probably would never have become
the great emancipator he afterward became. The love of a man’s
ideal “in his heart” has far more potent power and influence for
the good of the world than a man’s love for a woman herself,
provided, of course, the idealist has a constructive aim in life
and the potential abilities or capabilities for attainment. Without
inspiration there can be no genius. Without the ideal love alluded
to above, with its corresponding human affection maintained pure
and unadulterated IN HIS HEART, idealistically envisaged,
man has a small opportunity indeed of attaining greatness of any
kind in this world. Even dark, brooding moments of intense
gloom, as the result of our “unrequited love,” feeds the “light”
within our breast, causing it to expand, expand and expand, creat­
ing vacuums, as it were, in which to house the power and inspira­
tion of genius. It is a peculiar paradox that unsatisfied cravings
mastered are the stepping stones to greatness.
In our saddest moments,
In the gloom,
Is when our mind’s at ferment
If we give it room.
When the sky is darkened,
Your heart is blue,
Is when you do your thinkin’,
When it comes thru.

LORD MAI TREYA
Never fear the shadow
When your thots are grey;
Seeds will never blossom
If on top the earth they lay.
Too frequently we fear the very thing or experience that hap­
pens to be our greatest helper in disguise. Repeatedly this has
been stated by various poets and writers in numerous versions
down through the ages, but seldom do you see such statements
analyzed and explained so ordinary minds might understand
them. Why should darkness be the mother or father of any­
thing? What important part does it play in the gestation of
“life, light and love?” The fecundity of darkness in every phase
of life is undeniably the most mystery-wrought field of all human
speculation. “The night side of life,” one writer expresses it. I
explained my thought briefly regarding this in another of the
verses I wrote in 1933 entitled “Awakening:”
Better study nature fairly ;
Plant a little seed some day;
Press it down beneath the surface;
In the darkness let it stay.
Air, light and moistened earth,
In brooding darkness there,
W ill bring to life another birth
Enriching you with fruit most fair.
Darkness would seem to be the universal storehouse from
which we as Beings of Light draw our energies for activities in
this mundane sphere. Just as the earth, in its rotation around its
axis, is enshrouded in darkness half the time, we, as physical
beings, living on “mother earth,” must conform to her “ways
and means” of resuscitation, until ultimately as earth beings we
have generated and regenerated the light substance from the
“night side” of life and attain the summum bonum—perfection
such as Jesus claimed.
Are you so doubtful as to think
That souls are planted here;
Pressed into the earth to sink
By ruthless nature without care ?
312
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Better think you’re like a seed
Pressed beneath the flowering sod
W ith a mighty spark and speed
To know at once the Light of God!
Just how the forces of life played upon my love and court­
ship the following few months I shall sometime explain. My
heart was all but broken by the trying ordeal, and yet I persisted
in faithfully standing by the promptings of my deeper intuition,
but at the time I was most uncertain about which way I should go.

CHAPTER XXXVIII
GODS INCARNATE ON EARTH
In 1938, while many discourses were being received and
expressed by Guy W. Ballard, the accredited Messenger of the
Saint Germain “I AM” activity, other discourses were being
received by other Messengers, some of which were not to be
disclosed to the world until the psychological time. At the height
of the Ballard activity many of us wondered why the God of
Love and the Goddess of Love did not come forth to give dis­
courses, since all the others had favored the world with their
blessings.
The following discourse, dictated through one of the great
Christ-Channels on this earth at this time by the Goddess of
Love, in Los Angeles, July 7, 1938, will answer many questions
for the “I AM” students which Blessed Guy Ballard left unan­
swered because he could disclose to the outer world but what the
Masters determined, since he was but a messenger:
Discourse Given By the three Great Masters, Hilarion,
K.H. and the Super Spirit, the Hidden One, thru the
channel, or Logos, known to the planet earth as K. P.
Hail Masters! Peace profound—to the rose, to the cross,
to the sun and to the flame; and to all the Great Ones descending
therefrom into the darkened but rising planet called the earth.
To all the Great Ones within God’s great Universe, we face the
Light and say, “Thy will be done—not my will, not my brother’s
will, not my sister’s will, but the Will of the Great Infinite Father
of Great Infinite Spirits controlling this channel being used, being
focused upon and electrified in the use and the service of the
great Ascended Masters, Who are in control of the rising of the
Light and fire spiraling the destiny of the planet earth.”
I am in the center, tonight, of the great fiery triangle, blaz­
ing with Light, blazing with electrons, whose heat atoms make
up this fiery triangle of intensity, second to none. On the top of
the spiral of this triangle stands the great Master of Light,
314
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
Hilarión, Who has, and has had, in His charge and control,
avatars since the Word was first sent forth that the planet earth
should be. He it is Who has directed and taught at least, if not
for a long duration, at least for some space of time, every avatar,
every saviour of humanity, be they in male bodies or female
bodies, at some time or other in their great upward step toward
Mastery. Were they not chosen by the Cosmic to be avatars to
some portion of humanity, or some condition in the planet, He
would never be asked by the Powers ruling Him to waste a
moment of His time training these.
To my left on this fiery triangle stands my ever-present
Master KH; to my right stands the Master, the Supreme Spirit
of the Hidden One; within the center dot stands the channel of
the Great Infinite Spirit in control; and we ask you to see your­
selves again in the great Temple room wherein you in your
appointed place, are ready for only a portion from the Fourth
Alchemist. Only a portion will be given tonight, for certain rea­
sons known to the channel. The whole discourse would have been
forthcoming had conditions been different, but we will give you
tonight the portion that you must bear at this time.
We, the Masters, stand guard over this channel while the
Alchemist appears and relates to you a discourse in part, that
He related unto you many, many centuries ago. The great Mas­
ter is appearing tonight. He steps from behind a very luminous,
white portiere that has been thrown across the entire platform,
and for a special purpose. This luminous, brilliant, white por­
tiere will throw upon you students a vital force which the Masters
have decided is needed for purification, and your understanding
which seems at times to be shadowed. The Alchemist is in His
place. He says:
“My dear one, this night if you could see from your plane of
expression as We do from ours, you would not need this lesson.
We have spoken so often of love, of kindness, of tolerance,
obedience, simplicity and above all, that you each are at such a
place upon the Path that we have granted unto you, We, the
Ascended and Cosmic Beings, the full authorization to be gov­
erned and controlled by your own Great Infinite Self, and the
Master-Teachers working with you, and We are insisting upon
that tonight. Just for this once and never again do we hope to
have to repeat it. The channel used is twenty-four hours of the
day in full obedience to the Masters controlling her, and her own
great Infinite Spirit, and We of the three on the triangle of fire,
315
LORD MAI TREYA
and others, say that there is no need for anyone to offer any
hindrance to that control. She is sealed, guarded, guided and
protected, and knows, if no one else does, that she has signed and
taken the oath of renunciation, which places her always, at all
times, under our guidance. She, at all times, as a human person,
feels the lash of the whip and feels at times she could relax from
that, but it is not so, and never again will be so. She can have no
desire of any kind of herself ever again.
“To the right of me, as I speak, is the Master of the Fourth
Alchemical Chamber, the Great Laboratory of Infinite Spirit,
and there stands the legions of angels who have control of the
swords of blue lightning. Last week, we stepped aside for the
great Master Lanto, who told you at that time what these hosts of
angelic Beings were doing of Themselves, and through certain
perfected instruments, also the full use of this sword of the blue
lightning. How it was sweeping through your administration
buildings in the city of Los Angeles, and make no mistake it is
the city of the angels, for the hand, or mind of man never gave
this spot that name. Not only in your administration buildings is
this sword being used, but it is being swung with a mighty and
tremendous force through all channels that call themselves
Light. They are not attacking only the dark places, but the light
places as well, and why does the Great Infinite God permit that?
“While yet you are in physical bodies there is much need of
this sword of blue lightning. No matter which of you it is, you
must face that fact, and as long as there is one iota of self or
desire left in you, that sword will sway and swing within your
aura and world until every vestige is brought low by your own
guiding Infinite Spirit.
“You are in wonderful days, for the 100,440 type of which
each of you are included, are just on the verge of a revelation
and the unveilment of the ages. Hidden within this nine type
are the hidden angels of Light-—
the hidden Lords of Hosts—
the hidden Lords of the Flame—the hidden Lords of the Race
—the hidden Lords of Light, elected, projected from the moment
that Time began upon the planet earth. That is why there is so
much confusion. The forces of darkness are standing in full
armor to prohibit the unveilment of the elect, but nevertheless,
though dark be the times, the clock of the Father hath struck
and the unveiling, and the placing of each of these great Lights,
hidden within physical forms, is now taking place.
316
THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
“Remember the Biblical injunction: ‘Two shall be sleeping
in a bed, one shall be taken, the other one left. Two shall be
grinding at the mill, one taken, one left.’ What does it mean?
Another night we will give to you a full lecture upon this.
“As sons and daughters of Light, at the separation of this
type, marriage and inter-marriage with the sons of men, was in
direct controversy against the issue at the time of the Creation,
and we have just now arrived at the point where, in spite of all
difficulties of ages passed, the sons and daughters of Light, the
great Lords and Masters, hidden within human forms, will be
separated Eternally from the sons and daughters of men. There
are two distinct types treading the earth plane today and it is
not given unto the type called the sons and daughters of men to
be Lords and Masters in this cycle of Time. That is only for the
hidden lights of God.
“The second point tonight: Each of you are being trained in
the law of precipitation. Before we go further, this channel has
been directed by the Alchemist of the Fourth Division to give
Elis description. Lie is a Hindu Master and has completely sur­
rounded the face of this channel; but she is conscious of His
mouth, nose, eyes and other features.
“There is a fact that can be recorded, and it will be a joy to
you. A joy as of the living waters to each—it is truly a fact, you
have been faithful on Thursday evenings in this Sanctuary, and
also as a matter of record, the channel used tonight has for
nearly six years past always held, worked with, or was in, a
secret place on Thursday night. We will give to you now the
reason.
“In the Reign of Thothmose the III, there are those in this
Sanctuary that were with us. There, in Egypt, at that time and at
that Time I remember not how long ago it was, it is written in
the records, and can be verified by each one of you when you are
taken unto Egypt, in the Temple of Karnak, as well as the Egyp­
tian Temple of Luxor, Thursday nights long, long ago, were
set aside as the Master’s night for the sons and daughters of
Light, who held issue. That group and eternal soul bodies, that
golden thread, reaches from then until now.
“We have more wonderful facts for you shortly, and tonight
we have given you just one-half, but that is sufficient. May our
blessing, our peace, our love, overshadow you and you will have
from this night on more tolerance, more understanding. So be it!”
317
LORD MAI TREYA
BE THOU WISE
Be big enough to be small enough to do the little things THE M A S­
TER prompts you to do.
Be wise enough, ever, to let LOVE be the ruling principle in your life
and personal activity.
Be tolerant with your weaker Brothers and the Spirit of the Lords of
Light will assist you to help them.
Be kind and gentle to the “least of these,” my brethren, and you shall
be lifted to the GREATEST OF THESE, the LORDS.
“When you know who you ARE you will know who I A M .”—Anno.
Be sure thou art true to thyself in presenting thyself as a representative
of Him, Christ Jesus, or Christ Maitreya.
Be thou ONE in HIM, the SUN of LIGH T, and thou art ONE
with all the TRUE SONS OF GOD. H E IS L I G H T ! “CH RIST”
means GOD INCARNATE.
Be thou ever humble before all men and thou art sure to meet THE
M ASTERS OF LIG H T AND LOVE. “Pride goeth before a fall.”
Be thou certain it is CH RIST prompts thee when thou deemest thyself
capable of Great Works in the outer world of activity.
Be thou a seeker unceasing in thy quest of CH RIST’S LIGH T. “I
A M the door that no man can shut.” “It shall be opened unto thee.”
Be thou a Master of Love when thou judgeth a writer of Christ’s
words, then thou becometh as thou judgeth, A M ASTER OF LOVE.
Be thou thinking good of all men, then, in spite of thine own weak­
nesses thou art drawn into the ONE SPIRIT OF GO D —HIS LOVE.
Be thou a lover of thine enemies and thou hast truly become M ASTER.
Thus LOVE proves the greater over the lesser.
Be thou an ALCH EM IST, when thou hast mastered His Satanic
Majesty—all enemies—TH RO U GH LOVE— to become a collector of
FINE GOLD and the designer and perfecter of thine own diadem.
Be remindful that when thou judgeth another thou reflecteth but the
likeness of thyself, and more, thou becometh such.
Be filled with thine own GOOD intentions— IN CH RIST’S LIG H T
—and your attention cannot be drawn to other persons’ business.
Be thou manifest of simplicity even though possessor of LOVE, W IS ­
DOM and POW ER in perfect balance, for BEAU TY IS SIM PLIC ITY.
Be thou like Jesus, who, though an ordinary man in appearance, was
CH RIST M A IT R E YA INCARNATE, because He actually worshiped
God in Spirit and in Truth. Had they known the Spirit of Maitreya they
would not have crucified Him they called Jesus.
Eternal Peace Be unto Thee,
M AH AT M A H A M SU M A T A .

THE NEW GOLDEN AGE
A M ID ST THE STARS
I, in fancy, weave celestial,
A patterned garment of rarest hues—
The woof and warp of star dust—
Yellows, purples, pinks and blues,
Radiant greens and golds I choose.
Days I work ’mongst men of toil,
M y weaving put aside,
But nights again my star-lit home
In Spirit I have spied.
M y joyous task I now begin.
Worlds about me screech and cry,
Their noises blasting earthly things,
But in my world celestial
I work and weave and build ;
M y soul most joyful sings.
The pains and sorrows of my heart,
The griefs I’ve learned to bear—
Each wrought a secret little part
In this Celestial Garment
I’ve earned the right to wear.
Now that my mantle’s finished
And the Colors blend so well,
I draw me deep within my Self
To hear the Cosmic Bell.
All is w ell! A ll is w ell!
Lovingly,
A M SU M A T A .
