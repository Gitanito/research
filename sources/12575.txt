I passed out and stopped breathing. My body completely shut down and the next thing I knew I was in a dark place. It didn't seem like a room because I didn't feel my feet standing on anything solid. I didn't find it strange either that I was floating. I felt a kind of normal-ness, like I knew why I was there and it was okay. In front of me was a podium with an open book on it with a little writing on one of the pages. Beside the book was an inkwell with a quill in it. There was no one else in the room but I felt a presence telling me to look at the book, so I did and I didn't understand anything that was written there but I remember thinking, 'My name isn't here,' so I assumed I wasn't meant to be there. I awoke with my mum and dad standing over me and I remember saying 'I saw the book, that means I'll be going back.'
