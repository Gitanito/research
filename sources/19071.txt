there&#39;s a really hilarious story I like
to share about meeting with the CIA
director for Bill Clinton out here at a
dinner party some years ago about 20
years ago and of course the interest was
policy why the hell aren&#39;t we tell the
why the hell isn&#39;t the president being
told what&#39;s going on why are they lying
to us
I&#39;m the CIA director and I don&#39;t know
nothing about this and so we got through
all that and then we got into more of a
relaxed it was almost three hours we
together my wife was with me and um the
wife of the CIA director was the chief
operating officer of the National
Academy of Sciences over here so she had
a really scientific mind where is the
CIA director was more policy secrecy
policy all that and basically upset and
mad because they had looked into the
issue and knew they were being lied to
which is what of course all the whole
Clinton team knew that and so to Jimmy
Carter Jimmy Carter famously said I
didn&#39;t have a high and I didn&#39;t have a
high enough security clearance to be
told about this even though he had had a
sighting as governor of Georgia but so
she basically said well I don&#39;t
understand how could they be
communicating from one star system let&#39;s
say they&#39;re from a star system way out
there and they&#39;re trying to communicate
with a craft that&#39;s here one of these
UFOs is here they how could they
possibly do that
because the electromagnetic field is the
speed of light you know that&#39;s what your
cell phone is radios 186,000 miles per
second speed of light and I said yes I
know the speed of light is just too damn
slow in them I saw whether or not
they&#39;re using a phased electromagnetic
system that goes beyond the crossing
point of light and by the way the chief
scientists and Naval Research Lab said
they have done experiments at NRL here
that have done signals beyond the speed
of light but it is
classified he said in my condo here and
told me this word-for-word number three
at the whole lab sits in all meetings
with the vice-president I mean I know
this guy&#39;s guy stayed at our home this
is real so but she didn&#39;t know about
this because she was an administrator at
the National Academy of Sciences and I
said well you know my first thought was
if I tell her the truth about this she&#39;s
gonna think I&#39;m a crank and a kook and
you know I&#39;m a young doctor I&#39;m only 35
or something and I have four children I
got to put through college as I&#39;m gonna
ruin myself if I tell her the truth
and but I thought well you know she
asked me the question I owe her an
honest answer and so I said look she
you&#39;ve asked but this bear me out I said
you know let&#39;s take our Milky Way galaxy
the Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light
years across so this if a beam of light
went across at 100 thousand hundred
eighty six thousand miles every second
it would take 100 thousand years to
reach the other side
that&#39;s just our galaxy and in our galaxy
is about a hundred billion star systems
same number of star systems that there
are neurons in our brain cool huh
interesting coincidence and less so
let&#39;s just say there&#39;s a civilization
that is 1000 year light years from here
a light year is a distance not time
measurement distance measurement is the
distance light goes at 186,000 miles a
second in a year so let&#39;s say it&#39;s a
thousand light years from here which is
1% of the way across the Milky Way
galaxy which means it&#39;s in our
neighborhood because we&#39;re not even
intergalactic now at the speed of light
of your cell phone a radio wave a TV
signal a fiber-optic
it&#39;s gonna take a thousand years for a
signal to get from that home planet to
their starship that&#39;s in our solar
system and another thousand years for
the starship to say hi
got your message how are you doing today
to go back it&#39;s the time since the birth
of Christ so say hello and goodbye
is not an it&#39;s not a functional paradigm
so a priori if you&#39;re interstellar you
are transdimensional but why does that
mean it means that your communication
gear as well as your transportation gear
is dropping out of linear space-time in
a non locality a field of nonlocality
now the ultimate field of nonlocality
is pure mind stuff the essence of
awareness but that&#39;s absolute novelty
but between the absolute field of
non-local pure undifferentiated
consciousness and 3d or a countless
numbers of gradations of relative non
locality and they may not be instant but
they&#39;re pretty damn fast and they&#39;re
certainly faster than the speed of light
is this making sense the people I stay
with me so this means that they have
electronic devices that are when they&#39;re
fully materialized 3d have electronics
that can pick up on directed fault and
transmit directed thought and I&#39;ll never
forget dr. Robert Woods who is one of
our witnesses from McDonnell Douglas
telling me a story old man McDonald I
noticed from two sources Laurance
Rockefeller who was very interested in
all this and who funded the original
project starlight effort if you the AP
had this whole release of project
starlight documents from the Clinton
Library is a big scandal a couple years
ago when we were putting all this stuff
together and Laurance Rockefeller was
involved in his lawyer
Henry diamond and all these big folks
and I was putting together all this
stuff he funded the first gathering of
witnesses at Asilomar near Monterrey in
California in 1995 we had KGB people
there and cosmonauts and astronauts and
everybody and what was interesting is
that
this whole group of people kind of
understood this area of thought and
consciousness but not too technically
and what what we discovered was was that
through going back to society even in
the mid 60s McDonnell Douglas was very
interested in this and old man MacDonald
himself was like oh I&#39;ve got to know
about this so dr. Woods who is a very
renowned aerospace guy was sent to
research all this stuff anti-gravity UFO
sightings all this stuff and he came
back with his amazing case of a very
high caliber case well I think it was in
the Baja California where a craft had
materialized and this was back before we
had systems to track them so well and
hit them with electromagnetic weapons
which is what&#39;s happening today we&#39;ll
get to that and this little being came
out and it had a like a little black box
thing here and it was obviously the
communication device and the people who
had the encounter said that basically
the et was it was communicating directly
into their neural content cortex and
made the auditory cortex with this thing
in thought and that when they would
think back to the beam they would have
to speak he would understand it and
receive it and so it was a if you will a
transponder instead of a radio
transponder and now this sounds like
science fiction but it isn&#39;t it&#39;s the
only thing that can explain how you&#39;re
going to scientifically and reliably be
able to have a communication system that
is from one star system or galaxy to
another in real time again spooky effect
two things I want to so you&#39;re great
you&#39;re dropping out of the linear
barrier of space and it&#39;s basically
space is obliterated if you wish to look
at it that way so that it&#39;s all right
here you&#39;d be a billion light years
and is still right here because of the
non-local effect of consciousness and
understanding that other aspects of
reality have a conscious component
including photons electrons and
electromagnetic signals there&#39;s a
carrier wave of thought stuff
consciousness stuff even with an
electromagnetic signal get it that&#39;s why
the ce-5 initiatives actually do work
and when I explain some of this finally
that the wife of the CIA director so I
thought it had to be something like that
what was her response I said yeah of
course you&#39;re smart lady I mean it makes
sense now in polite company polite
scientific company once not allowed to
talk about these things because it&#39;s a
forbidden this is I know we might book
hidden truth forbidden knowledge that
the film series was based on these are
things are just not allowed to talk
about because it&#39;s so paradigm busting
scientifically and even theologically
because it begins to explain a lot of
quote mystical experiences people have
had that become a catechism or get
misinterpreted through the millennia but
ultimately if we want to seek the truth
let&#39;s find the truth and forget our
dogma I love that saying might you know
my my karma ran over my dogma her
something like that
so so it you know it that&#39;s really you
know the pure-hearted pursuit of the
truth no matter where it takes you
is really really key when you&#39;re going
into these emerging Sciences and areas
of thought and consciousness this then
brings us to the numbers of people who
have observed these kinds of phenomenon
in the mainstream where they will have
an object a sphere appear and then
inside the sphere floating into their
house are these little B
in the sphere communicating in their
thought a very famous actor who I&#39;ve
spent time of is at his home in LA had
this happen didn&#39;t think any of this was
true and then of course he he found out
who I was bought all the books and he
said oh my god this why this happened
cuz he read the first book that I wrote
extraterrestrial contact the evidence
and implications it came out in 99 most
people don&#39;t get to that book it&#39;s
really probably the most important one
and what was fascinating is that he said
now I understand it so he contacted me
and I went to his home and we were
sitting where this happened
and then went out on his balcony was
overlooked a Silver Lake reservoir there
in LA and he&#39;s up in the hills and here
comes this object go come straight down
out of space with yellow golden object
comes down goes and goes in front of a
cloud and then he materializes because
did you see that ICO yeah I said they
know we&#39;re talking they I&#39;m sure these
are the same people who came into your
house wonderful lovely so I think that a
lot of people have had these experiences
but they don&#39;t have the understanding my
hope for this gathering today but also
the the video that we&#39;ll put out is that
people will begin to connect these dots
and make some sense of these experiences
we&#39;re in the early days when I started
looking into this I found there were
many many accounts where people would
see a craft or maybe it&#39;s not fully
materialized maybe it&#39;s just a sphere
and they&#39;ll think something and it&#39;ll
react to the thought and people how is
it doing that
was reading my mind well I mean it&#39;s not
Kreskin reading your mind there is a
science of what I call coherent thought
receivers and transmissions that can
take place between transdimensional
interstellar capable civilizations and
humans now we may not understand all the
science and I can&#39;t say I can go to my
laboratory and build one of these things
because I can&#39;t hook up my DVD player
emily has to do that I&#39;m a useless that
kind of thing yeah he&#39;s like nurse or
Emily help you know but the FIB relators
grade and respirators and other stuff no
computers hurl them through the window
I&#39;m all thumbs but you know if we can
understand it so then from an
experiential point of view from that
paradigm we said oh I understand now how
it is content can be initiated but also
if it spontaneously begins to happen how
it begins to unfold and why it can be
both physical and in thought and
electronic and then in these other
phenomenon I call it the epi phenomenon
that happens all the different
manifestations of
you
