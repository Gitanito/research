  1. INTRODUCTION

  &nbsp;

  Some people who have survived a   life-threatening crisis report an extraordinary experience. Near-death   experiences (NDE) occur with increasing frequency because of improved survival   rates resulting from modern techniques of resuscitation. The content of NDE and   the effects on patients seem similar worldwide, across all cultures and times.   The subjective nature and absence of a frame of reference for this experience   lead to individual, cultural, and religious factors determining the vocabulary   used to describe and interpret the experience. NDE can be defined as the   reported memory of the whole of impressions during a special state of   consciousness, including a number of special elements such as out-of-body   experience, pleasant feelings, seeing a tunnel, a light, deceased relatives, or   a life review. Many circumstances are described during which NDE are reported,   such as cardiac arrest (clinical death), shock after loss of blood, traumatic   brain injury or intra-cerebral haemorrhage, near-drowning or asphyxia, but also   in serious diseases not immediately life-threatening. Similar experiences to   near-death ones can occur during the terminal phase of illness, and are called   deathbed visions. Furthermore, identical experiences, so-called 'fear-death'   experiences, are mainly reported after situations in which death seemed   unavoidable like serious traffic or mountaineering accidents. The NDE is   transformational, causing profound changes of life-insight and loss of the fear   of death. An NDE seems to be a relatively regularly occurring, and to many   physicians an inexplicable phenomenon and hence an ignored result of survival in   a critical medical situation.

  And should we also consider the possibility of conscious   experience when someone in coma has been declared brain dead by physicians, and   organ transplantation is about to be started? Recently several books were   published in the Netherlands about what patients had experienced in their   consciousness during coma following a severe traffic accident, following acute   disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or following complications with cerebral   hypertension after surgery for a brain tumour, this last patient being declared   brain dead by his neurologist and neurosurgeon, but the family refused to give   permission for organ donation. All these patients reported, after regaining   consciousness, that they had experienced clear consciousness with memories,   emotions, and perception out of and above their body during the period of their   coma, also 'seeing' nurses, physicians and family in and around the ICU. Does   brain death really means death, or is it just the beginning of the process of   dying that can last for hours to days, and what happens to consciousness during   this period? Should we also consider the possibility that someone who is   clinically dead during cardiac arrest can experience consciousness, and even   whether there could still be consciousness after someone really has died, when   his body is cold? How is consciousness related to the integrity of brain   function? Is it possible to gain insight in this relationship? In my view the   only possible empirical approach to evaluate theories about consciousness is   research on NDE, because in studying the several universal elements that are   reported during NDE, we get the opportunity to verify all the existing theories   about consciousness that have been discussed until now. Consciousness presents   temporal as well as everlasting experiences. Is there a start or an end to   consciousness?

  In this paper I first will discuss some more general aspects   of death, and after that I will describe more details from our prospective study   on near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest in the Netherlands,   which was published in the Lancet.1 I also want to comment on similar   findings from two prospective studies in survivors of cardiac arrest from the   USA2 and from the United Kingdom.3 Finally, I will discuss   implications for consciousness studies, and how it could be possible to explain   the continuity of our consciousness.

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  2. ABOUT DEATH

  &nbsp;

  First I want to discuss death. The confrontation with   death raises many basic questions, also for physicians. Why are we afraid of   death? Are our concepts about death correct? Most of us believe that death is   the end of our existence; we believe that it is the end of everything we are. We   believe that the death of our body is the end of our identity, the end of our   thoughts and memories, that it is the end of our consciousness. Do we have to   change our concepts about death, not only based on what has been thought and   written about death in human history around the world in many cultures, in many   religions, and in all times, but also based on insights from recent scientific   research on NDE?

  What happens when I am dead? What is death? During our   life 500000 cells die each second, each day about 50 billion cells in our body   are replaced, resulting in a new body each year. So cell death is totally   different from body death when you eventually die. During our life our body   changes continuously, each day, each minute, each second. Each year about 98% of   our molecules and atoms in our body have been replaced. Each living being is in   an unstable balance of two opposing processes of continual disintegration and   integration. But no one realizes this constant change. And from where comes the   continuity of our continually changing body? Cells are just the building blocks   of our body, like the bricks of a house, but who is the architect, who   coordinates the building of this house. When someone has died, only mortal   remains are left: only matter. But where is the director of the body? What about   our consciousness when we die? Is someone his body, or do we 'have' a body?

  &nbsp;

  3. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE

  &nbsp;

  In 1969 during my   rotating internship a patient was successfully resuscitated in the cardiac ward   by electrical defibrillation. The patient regained consciousness, and was very,   very disappointed. He told me about a tunnel, beautiful colours, a light and   beautiful music. I have never forgotten this event, but I did not do anything   with it. Years later, in 1976 Raymond Moody first described the so-called   'near-death experiences', and only in 1986 I read about these experiences in the   book by George Ritchie entitled 'Return from Tomorrow,' which relates   what he experienced during a period of clinical death of 6-minutes duration in   1943 during his medical study.4 After reading his book I started to   interview my patients who had survived a cardiac arrest. To my great surprise,   within two years about fifty patients told me about their NDE.

  My scientific curiosity started to grow, because according to   our current medical concepts, it is not possible to experience consciousness   during a cardiac arrest, when circulation and breathing have ceased.

  Several theories on the origin of an   NDE have been proposed. Some think the experience is caused by physiological   changes in the brain such as brain cells dying as a result of cerebral anoxia,   and possibly also caused by release of endorphins, or NMDA receptor blockade.5   Other theories encompass a psychological reaction to approaching death6   or a combination of such reaction and anoxia.7 But until now there   was no prospective, meticulous and scientifically designed study to explain the   cause and content of an NDE. All studies had been retrospective and very   selective with respect to patients. In retrospective studies 5-30 years can   elapse between occurrence of the experience and its investigation, which often   prevents accurate assessment of medical and pharmacological factors. We wanted   to know if there could be a physiological, pharmacological, psychological or   demographic explanation why people experience consciousness during a period of   clinical death. The definition of clinical death was used for the period of   unconsciousness caused by anoxia of the brain due to the arrest of circulation   and breathing that happens during ventricular fibrillation in patients with   acute myocardial infarction.

  We studied patients who survived   cardiac arrest, because this is a well-described life threatening medical   situation, where patients will ultimately die from irreversible damage to the   brain if cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is not initiated within 5 to 10   minutes. It is the closest model of the process of dying.

  So, in 1988 we started a prospective   study of 344 consecutive survivors of cardiac arrest in ten Dutch hospitals with   the aim of investigating the frequency, the cause and the content of an NDE.1   We did a short standardised interview with sufficiently recovered patients   within a few days of resuscitation, and asked whether they could remember the   period of unconsciousness, and what they recalled. In cases where memories were   reported, we coded the experiences according to a weighted core experience   index. In this system the depth of the NDE was measured according to the   reported elements of the content of the NDE. The more elements were reported,   the deeper the experience was and the higher the resulting score was.

  Results: 62 patients (18%) reported   some recollection of the time of clinical death. Of these patients 41 (12%) had   a core experience with a score of 6 or higher, and 21 (6%) had a superficial   NDE. In the core group 23 patients (7%) reported a deep or very deep experience   with a score of 10 or higher. And 282 patients (82%) had no recollection of the   period of cardiac arrest.

  In the American prospective study of 116 survivors of cardiac   arrest 11 patients (10%) reported an NDE with a score of 6 or higher; the   investigators did not specify the number of patients with a superficial NDE with   a low score.2 In the British prospective study of 63 survivors of   cardiac arrest only 4 patients (6.3%) reported an NDE with a score of 6 or   higher, and 3 patients (4.8%) had a superficial NDE, a total of 7 patients (11%)   with memories from the period of cardiac arrest.3

  In our study about 50% of the patients with an NDE reported   awareness of being dead, or had positive emotions, 30% reported moving through a   tunnel, had an observation of a celestial landscape, or had a meeting with   deceased relatives. About 25% of the patients with an NDE had an out-of-body   experience, had communication with 'the light,' or observed colours, 13%   experienced a life review, and 8% experienced a border.

  What might distinguish the small   percentage of patients who report an NDE from those who do not? We found that   neither the duration of cardiac arrest nor the duration of unconsciousness, nor   the need for intubation in complicated CPR, nor induced cardiac arrest in   electrophysiological stimulation (EPS) had any influence on the frequency of   NDE. Neither could we find any relationship between the frequency of NDE and   administered drugs, fear of death before the arrest, foreknowledge of NDE,   religion or education. An NDE was more frequently reported at ages lower than 60   years, and also by patients who had had more than one CPR during their hospital   stay, and by patients who had experienced an NDE previously. Patients with   memory defects induced by lengthy CPR reported an NDE less frequently. Good   short-term memory seems to be essential for remembering an NDE. Unexpectedly, we   found that significantly more patients who had an NDE, especially a deep   experience, died within 30 days of CPR (p&lt;0.0001).

  We performed a longitudinal study   with taped interviews of all late survivors with NDE 2 and 8 years following the   cardiac arrest, along with a matched control group of survivors of cardiac   arrest who did not report an NDE.1 This study was designed to assess   whether the transformation in attitude toward life and death following an NDE is   the result of having an NDE or the result of the cardiac arrest itself. In this   follow-up research into transformational processes after NDE, we found a   significant difference between patients with and without an NDE. The process of   transformation took several years to consolidate. Patients with an NDE did not   show any fear of death, they strongly believed in an afterlife, and their   insight in what is important in life had changed: love and compassion for   oneself, for others, and for nature. They now understood the cosmic law that   everything one does to others will ultimately be returned to oneself: hatred and   violence as well as love and compassion. Remarkably, there was often evidence of   increased intuitive feelings. Furthermore, the long lasting transformational   effects of an experience that lasts only a few minutes was a surprising and   unexpected finding.

  Several theories have been proposed   to explain NDE. However, in our prospective study we did not show that   psychological, physiological or pharmacological factors caused these experiences   after cardiac arrest. With a purely physiological explanation such as cerebral   anoxia, most patients who had been clinically dead should report an NDE. All 344   patients had been unconscious because of anoxia of the brain resulting from   their cardiac arrest. Why should only 18% of the survivors of cardiac arrest   report an NDE?

  And yet,   neurophysiological processes must play some part in NDE, because NDE-like   experiences can be induced through electrical 'stimulation' of some parts of the   cortex in patients with epilepsy,8 with high carbon dioxide levels   (hypercarbia)9 and in decreased cerebral perfusion resulting in local   cerebral hypoxia, as in rapid acceleration during training of fighter pilots,10   or as in hyperventilation followed by Valsalva maneuver.11 Also   NDE-like experiences have been reported after the use of drugs like ketamine,12   LSD,13 or mushrooms.14 These induced experiences can   sometimes result in a period of unconsciousness, but can at the same time also   consist of out-of-body experiences, perception of sound, light or flashes of   recollections from the past. These recollections, however, consist of fragmented   and random memories unlike the panoramic life-review that can occur in NDE.   Further, transformational processes are rarely reported after induced   experiences. Thus, induced experiences are not identical to NDE.

  Another theory holds that NDE might   be a changing state of consciousness (transcendence, or the theory of   continuity), in which memories, identity, and cognition, with emotion, function   independently from the unconscious body, and retain the possibility of   non-sensory perception. Obviously, consciousness during NDE was experienced   independently from the normal body-linked waking consciousness.

  With lack of   evidence for any other theories for NDE, the concept thus far assumed but never   scientifically proven, that consciousness and memories are localized in the   brain should be discussed. Traditionally, it has been argued that thoughts or   consciousness are produced by large groups of neurons or neuronal networks. How   could a clear consciousness outside one's body be experienced at the moment that   the brain no longer functions during a period of clinical death, with flat EEG?15   Furthermore, blind people have also described veridical perceptions during   out-of-body experiences at the time of their NDE.16 Scientific study   of NDE pushes us to the limits of our medical and neurophysiological ideas about   the range of human consciousness and relationship of consciousness and memories   to the brain.

  Also Greyson2 writes in   his discussion: 'No one physiological or psychological model by itself explains   all the common features of NDE. The paradoxical occurrence of heightened, lucid   awareness and logical thought processes during a period of impaired cerebral   perfusion raises particular perplexing questions for our current understanding   of consciousness and its relation to brain function. A clear sensorium and   complex perceptual processes during a period of apparent clinical death   challenge the concept that consciousness is localized exclusively in the brain.'   And Parnia and Fenwick3 write in their discussion: 'The data suggest   that the NDE arises during unconsciousness. This is a surprising conclusion,   because when the brain is so dysfunctional that the patient is deeply comatose,   the cerebral structures, which underpin subjective experience and memory, must   be severely impaired. Complex experiences such as are reported in the NDE should   not arise or be retained in memory. Such patients would be expected to have no   subjective experience [as was the case in the vast majority of patients who   survive cardiac arrest in the three published prospective studies1-3   or at best a confusional state if some brain function is retained. Even if the   unconscious brain is flooded by neurotransmitters this should not produce clear,   lucid remembered experiences, as those cerebral modules, which generate   conscious experience, are impaired by cerebral anoxia. The fact that in a   cardiac arrest loss of cortical function precedes the rapid loss of brainstem   activity lends further support to this view. An alternative explanation would be   that the observed experiences arise during the loss of, or on regaining   consciousness. The transition from consciousness to unconsciousness is rapid,   with the EEG showing changes within a few seconds, and appearing immediate to   the subject. Experiences which occur during the recovery of consciousness are   confusional, which these were not'. In fact, memory is a very sensitive   indicator of brain injury and the length of amnesia before and after   unconsciousness is an indicator of the severity of the injury. Therefore, events   that occur just prior to or just after loss of consciousness would not be   expected to be recalled. And as stated before, in our study1 patients   with loss of memory induced by lengthy CPR reported significantly fewer NDE.   Good short-term memory seems to be essential for remembering NDE.

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  4. SOME   TYPICAL ELEMENTS OF NDE

  &nbsp;

  Before I discuss   in greater detail some neurophysiological aspects of brain functioning during   cardiac arrest, I would like to reconsider certain elements of the NDE, like the   out-of-body experience, the holographic life review and preview, the encounter   with deceased relatives, the return into the body and the disappearance of the   fear of death.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;     4.1. The   Out-of-Body Experience     &nbsp;     In this   experience people have veridical perceptions from a position outside and above   their lifeless body. NDEers have the feeling that they have apparently taken off   their body like an old coat and to their surprise they appear to have retained   their own identity with the possibility of perception, emotions, and a very   clear consciousness. This out-of-body experience is scientifically important   because doctors, nurses, and relatives can verify the reported perceptions. This   is the report of a nurse of a Coronary Care Unit:

  &nbsp;

    'During night shift an ambulance brings in a 44-year old cyanotic, comatose man   into the coronary care unit. He was found in coma about 30 minutes before in a   meadow. When we go to intubate the patient, he turns out to have dentures in his   mouth. I remove these upper dentures and put them onto the 'crash cart.' After   about an hour and a half the patient has sufficient heart rhythm and blood   pressure, but he is still ventilated and intubated, and he is still comatose. He   is transferred to the intensive care unit to continue the necessary artificial   respiration. Only after more than a week do I meet again with the patient, who   is by now back on the cardiac ward. The moment he sees me he says: 'O, that   nurse knows where my dentures are.' I am very surprised. Then he elucidates:   'You were there when I was brought into hospital and you took my dentures out of   my mouth and put them onto that cart, it had all these bottles on it and there   was this sliding drawer underneath, and there you put my teeth.' I was   especially amazed because I remembered this happening while the man was in deep   coma and in the process of CPR. It appeared that the man had seen himself lying   in bed, that he had perceived from above how nurses and doctors had been busy   with the CPR. He was also able to describe correctly and in detail the small   room in which he had been resuscitated as well as the appearance of those   present like myself. He is deeply impressed by his experience and says he is no   longer afraid of death. '

  &nbsp;

  4.2. The   Holographic Life Review

    &nbsp;

  During this life review the subject feels the presence and   renewed experience of not only every act but also every thought from one's past   life, and one realizes that all of it is an energy field which influences   oneself as well as others. All that has been done and thought seems to be   significant and stored. Insight is obtained about whether love was given or on   the contrary withheld. Because one is connected with the memories, emotions and   consciousness of another person, you experience the consequences of your own   thoughts, words and actions to that other person at the very moment in the past   that they occurred. Hence there is during a life review a connection with the   fields of consciousness of other persons as well as with your own fields of   consciousness (interconnectedness). Patients survey their whole life in   one glance; time and space do not seem to exist during such an experience.   Instantaneously they are where they concentrate upon (non-locality), and   they can talk for hours about the content of the life review even though the   resuscitation only took minutes. Quotation:

  &nbsp;

  'All of my   life up till the present seemed to be placed before me in a kind of panoramic,   three-dimensional review, and each event seemed to be accompanied by a   consciousness of good or evil or with an insight into cause or effect. Not only   did I perceive everything from my own viewpoint, but I also knew the thoughts of   everyone involved in the event, as if I had their thoughts within me. This meant   that I perceived not only what I had done or thought, but even in what way it   had influenced others, as if I saw things with all-seeing eyes. And so even your   thoughts are apparently not wiped out. And all the time during the review the   importance of love was emphasised. Looking back, I cannot say how long this life   review and life insight lasted, it may have been long, for every subject came   up, but at the same time it seemed just a fraction of a second, because I   perceived it all at the same moment. Time and distance seemed not to exist. I   was in all places at the same time, and sometimes my attention was drawn to   something, and then

  &nbsp;I would be   present there.'

  &nbsp;     Also a preview can be experienced, in which both future   images from personal life events (sometimes remembered only later in the shape   of 'd'ja vu') as well as more general images from the future occur, even though   it must be stressed that these surveyed images should be considered purely as   possibilities. And again it seems as if time and space do not exist during this   review. Quotation:

  &nbsp;

  'I had a nice eye contact, they   looked at me full of love, and then I surveyed a great part of my life to come;   the care for my children, the terminal illness of my wife, the circumstances I   would be mixed up with, in my job and besides. I surveyed it completely; and   then I got the feeling that I had to decide now: 'I may stay here, or I have to   go back,' but I had to decide now.'

  &nbsp;

  4.3. The Encounter with Deceased Relatives

  &nbsp;

  If deceased acquaintances or   relatives are encountered in an otherworldly dimension, they are usually   recognized by their appearance, while communication is possible through thought   transfer. Thus, during an NDE it is also possible to come into contact with   fields of consciousness of deceased persons (interconnectedness).   Sometimes persons are met whose death was impossible to have known; sometimes   persons unknown to them are encountered during an NDE. Quotation:

  &nbsp;

    'During my cardiac arrest I had a   extensive experience (') and later I saw, apart from my deceased grandmother, a   man who had looked at me lovingly, but whom I did not know. More than 10 years   later, at my mother's deathbed, she confessed to me that I had been born out of   an extramarital relationship, my father being a Jewish man who had been deported   and killed during the second World War, and my mother showed me his picture. The   unknown man that I had seen more than 10 years before during my NDE turned out   to be my biological father.'

    &nbsp;

  4.4. The   Return into the Body

    &nbsp;

  Some patients can describe how they   returned into their body, mostly through the top of the head, after they had   come to understand through wordless communication with a Being of Light or a   deceased relative that 'it wasn't their time yet' or that 'they still had a task   to fulfil.' The conscious return into the body is experienced as something very   oppressive. They regain consciousness in their body and realize that they are   'locked up' in their body, meaning again all the pain and restriction of their   disease. They also realize that a part of their consciousness with deep   knowledge and understanding as well as the feeling of unconditional love and   acceptance have been taken away from them again. Quotation:

  &nbsp;

  'And when I regained consciousness in my body, it was so   terrible, so terrible' that experience was so beautiful, I never would have   liked to come back, I wanted to stay there' and still I came back. And from that   moment on it was a very difficult experience to live my life again in my body,   with all the limitations I felt in that period.'

  &nbsp;

  4.5. The   Disappearance of Fear of Death

    &nbsp;

  Nearly all people who have   experienced an NDE lose their fear of death. This is due to the realization that   there is a continuation of consciousness, even when you have been declared dead   by bystanders or even by doctors. You are separated from the lifeless body,   retaining the ability of perception. Quotation:

  &nbsp;

    'It is outside my domain to discuss   something that can only be proven by death. For me, however, the experience was   decisive in convincing me that consciousness lives on beyond the grave. Death   was not death, but another form of life.'

    &nbsp;

    Another quotation:

  &nbsp;

    'This experience is a blessing for   me, for now I know for sure that body and mind are separated, and that there is   life after death.'

    &nbsp;

    Following an NDE people know of the   continuity of their consciousness, retaining all thoughts and past events. And   this insight causes exactly their process of transformation and the loss of fear   of death. Man appears to be more than just a body.

    &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  5.   NEUROPHYSIOLOGY IN CARDIAC ARREST

  &nbsp;

  All these   elements of an NDE were experienced during the period of cardiac arrest, during   the period of apparent unconsciousness, during the period of clinical death! But   how is it possible to explain these experiences during the period of temporary   loss of all functions of the brain due to acute pancerebral ischemia?

    We know that patients with cardiac   arrest are unconscious within seconds. But how do we know that the   electroencephalogram (EEG) is flat in those patients, and how can we study this?   Complete cessation of cerebral circulation is found in cardiac arrest due to   ventricular fibrillation (VF) during threshold testing at implantation of   internal defibrillators. This complete cerebral ischemic model can be used to   study the result of anoxia of the brain.

  In VF complete   cardiac arrest occurs, with complete cessation of cerebral flow, resulting in   acute pancerebral anoxia. The middle cerebral artery blood flow, Vmca,   which is a reliable trend monitor of the cerebral blood flow, decreases to 0   cm/sec immediately after the induction of VF.17 Through many studies   in both human and animal models, cerebral function has been shown to be severely   compromised during cardiac arrest, and electrical activity in both cerebral   cortex and the deeper structures of the brain has been shown to be absent after   a very short period of time. Monitoring of the electrical activity of the cortex   (EEG) has shown that ischemia produces a decrease of power in fast activity and   in delta activity and an increase of slow delta I activity, sometimes also an   increase in amplitude of theta activity, progressively and ultimately declining   to isoelectricity. More often initial slowing and attenuation of the EEG waves   is the first sign of cerebral ischemia. The first ischemic changes in the EEG   are detected an average of 6.5 seconds after circulatory arrest. With   prolongation of the cerebral ischemia, progression to isoelectricity occurs   within 10 to 20 (mean 15) seconds from the onset of cardiac arrest.18-21

  After   defibrillation the Vmca, measured by transcranial Doppler technique,   returns rapidly within 1-5 seconds after a&nbsp; cardiac arrest of short duration.   However, in the case of a prolonged cardiac arrest of more than 37 seconds, the   Vmca shows an initial overshoot upon reperfusion, a transient global   hyperaemia, followed by a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow up to 50%   or less of normal.22 This results also in an initial overshoot of   cerebral oxygen uptake (hyperoxia) with a fast decrease in cerebral oxygen   uptake to borderline values for a considerable time due to delayed   hypoperfusion.18,22 In the case of a prolonged cardiac arrest the EEG   recovery also takes more time, and normal EEG activity may not return for many   minutes to hours after cardiac function has been restored, depending on the   duration of the cardiac arrest, despite maintenance of adequate blood pressure   during the recovery phase. Additionally, EEG recovery underestimates the   metabolic recovery of the brain, and cerebral oxygen uptake may be depressed for   a considerable time after restoration of circulation.18 In acute   myocardial infarction the duration of cardiac arrest (VF) in the Coronary Care   Unit (CCU) is usually 60-120 seconds, on the cardiac ward 2-5 minutes, and in   out-of-hospital arrest it usually exceeds 5-10 minutes. Only during threshold   testing of internal defibrillators or during electrophysiological stimulation   studies will the duration of cardiac arrest rarely exceed 30-60 seconds.

    Anoxia causes loss of function of   our cell systems. However, in anoxia of only some minute's duration this loss   may be transient;&nbsp; in prolonged anoxia cell death occurs, with permanent   functional loss. During an embolic event a small clot obstructs the blood flow   in a small vessel of the cortex, resulting in anoxia of that part of the brain,   with loss of electrical activity. This results in a functional loss of the   cortex like hemiplegia or aphasia. When the clot is dissolved or broken down   within several minutes the lost cortical function is restored. This is called a   transient ischemic attack (TIA). However, when the clot obstructs the cerebral   vessel for minutes to hours, it will result in neuronal cell death, with a   permanent loss of function of this part of the brain, with persistent hemiplegia   or aphasia, and the diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is made. So   transient anoxia results in transient loss of function.

    In cardiac arrest global anoxia of   the brain occurs within seconds. Timely and adequate CPR reverses this   functional loss of the brain, because definitive damage of the brain cells,   resulting in cell death, has been prevented. Long lasting anoxia, caused by   cessation of blood flow to the brain for more than 5-10 minutes, results in   irreversible damage and extensive cell death in the brain. This is called brain   death, and most patients will ultimately die.

  From these   studies we know that in our prospective study1 as well as in the   other studies2,3 of patients who have been clinically dead (VF on the   ECG), total lack of electric activity of the cortex of the brain (flat EEG) must   have been the only possibility, but also the abolition of brain-stem activity,   such as the loss of the corneal reflex, fixed and dilated pupils, and the loss   of the gag reflex, is a clinical finding in those patients. However, patients   with an NDE can report a clear consciousness, in which cognitive functioning,   emotion, sense of identity, and memory from early childhood was possible, as   well as perception from a position out and above their 'dead' body. Because of   the occasional and verifiable out-of-body experiences, like the one involving   the dentures in our study,1 we know that the NDE must happen during   the period of&nbsp; unconsciousness, and not in the first or last seconds of this   period. There is also a well documented report of a patient with constant   registration of the EEG during surgery for an gigantic aneurysm at the base of   the brain, operated with a body temperature between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius.   She was connected to a heart-lung machine, with VF, with all blood drained from   her head, with a flat line EEG, with clicking devices in both ears, with eyes   taped shut, and this patient experienced an NDE with an out-of-body experience,   and all details she perceived and heard could later be verified.15

  So we have to   conclude that NDE in our study,1 as well as in the American2   and the British study,3 was experienced during a transient functional   loss of all functions of the cortex and of the brainstem. How could a clear   consciousness outside one's body be experienced at the moment that the brain no   longer functions during a period of clinical death, with a flat EEG? Such a   brain would be roughly analogous to a computer with its power source unplugged   and its circuits detached. It couldn't hallucinate; it couldn't do anything at   all. As stated before, up to the present it has generally been assumed that   consciousness and memories are localized inside the brain, that the brain   produces them. According to this unproven concept, consciousness and memories   ought to vanish with physical death, and necessary also during clinical death or   brain death. However, during an NDE patients experience the continuity of their   consciousness with the possibility of perception outside and above one's   lifeless body. Consciousness can be experienced in another dimension without our   conventional body-linked concept of time and space, where all past, present and   future events exist and can be observed simultaneously and instantaneously (non-locality).   In the other dimension, one can be connected with the personal memories and   fields of consciousness of oneself as well as others, including deceased   relatives (universal interconnectedness). And the conscious return into   one's body can be experienced, together with the feeling of bodily limitation,   and also sometimes the awareness of the loss of universal wisdom and love they   had experienced during their NDE.

  6.   NEUROPHYSIOLOGY IN A NORMAL FUNCTIONING BRAIN

  &nbsp;

    For decades, extensive research has   been done to localize consciousness and memories inside the brain, so far   without success. In connection with the unproven assumption that consciousness   and memories are produced and stored inside the brain, we should ask ourselves   how a non-material activity such as concentrated attention or thinking can   correspond to an observable (material) reaction in the form of measurable   electrical, magnetic, and chemical activity at a certain place in the brain,23-25   even an increase in cerebral blood flow is observed during such a non-material   activity as thinking.26 Neurophysiological studies have shown these   aforesaid activities through EEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG), magnetic   resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.   Specific areas of the brain have been shown to become metabolically active in   response to a thought or feeling. However, those studies, although providing   evidence for the role of neuronal networks as an intermediary for the   manifestation of thoughts, do not necessary imply that those cells also produce   the thoughts. Direct evidence of how neurons or neuronal networks could possibly   produce the subjective essence of the mind and thoughts is currently lacking. It   is also not well understood how to explain that in a sensory experiment, the   subject stated that he was aware (conscious) of the sensation a few thousands of   a second following the stimulation, whereas neuronal adequacy in the subject's   brain wasn't achieved until a full 500 msec following the sensation. This   experiment has led to the so-called delay-and-antedating hypothesis,27   and it is a challenge to our current neurophysiological theories, as well as   phenomena like anticipatory activation, or presentiment,28 with   changes on MRI up to 3 seconds preceding emotional stimuli. 29

  The brain contains about 100 billion   neurons, 20 billion of which are situated in the cerebral cortex. Several   thousand neurons die each day, and there is a continuous renewal of the proteins   and lipids constituting cellular membranes on a time-span basis ranging from   several days to a few weeks.30 During life the cerebral cortex   continuously adaptively modifies its neuronal network, including changing the   number and location of synapses. All neurons show an electrical potential across   their cell membranes, and each neuron has tens to hundreds of synapses that   influence other neurons. Transportation of information along neurons occurs   predominantly by means of action potentials, differences in membrane potential   caused by synaptic depolarization and hyperpolarization. The sum total of   changes along neurons causes transient electric fields and therefore also   transient magnetic fields along the synchronously activated dendrites. During   cerebral activity, these electrical and magnetic patterns of the 100 billion   neurons change each nanosecond. Neither the number of neurons, nor the precise   shape of the dendrites, nor the position of synapses, nor the firing of   individual neurons seem to be crucial for information processing properties, but   the derivative, the fleeting, highly ordered 4-dimensional (space and time)   patterns of the electromagnetic fields generated along the dendritic trees of   specialized neuronal networks. These patterns should be thought of as the final   product of chaotic, dynamically governed self-organization.31

    The influence of external localized   magnetic and electric fields on these constant changing electromagnetic fields   during normal functioning of the brain should now be mentioned.   Neurophysiological research is being performed using transcranial magnetic   stimulation (TMS),32 in the course of which localized magnetic fields   are produced. TMS can excite or inhibit different parts of the brain, depending   of the amount of energy given, allowing functional mapping of cortical regions   and creation of transient functional lesions. It allows assessing the   function in focal brain regions on a millisecond scale, and it can study the   contribution of cortical networks to specific cognitive functions. TMS can   interfere with visual and motion perception, by interrupting cortical   processing for 80-100 milliseconds. Intracortical inhibition and facilitation   obtained during paired-pulse studies with TMS reflect the activity of   interneurons in the cortex. Also TMS can alter the functioning of the brain   beyond the time of stimulation, but it does not appear to leave any lasting   effect.32

    Interrupting the electrical fields   of local neuronal networks in parts of the cortex also disturbs the normal   functioning of the brain. By localized electrical stimulation of the temporal   and parietal lobe during surgery for epilepsy the neurosurgeon and Nobel prize   winner Wilder Penfield could sometimes induce flashes of recollection of the   past (never a complete life review), experiences of light, sound or music, and   rarely a kind of out-of-body experience (OBE).33,34 These experiences   did not produce any life-attitude transformation.

    The effect of the external magnetic   or electrical stimulation depends on the intensity and duration of energy given.   There may be no clinical effect; sometimes an effect occurs when only a small   amount of energy is given. But during stimulation with higher energy,   inhibition of local cortical functions occurs by extinction of their   electrical and magnetic fields (personal communication Dr. Olaf Blanke,   neurologist, Laboratory for Presurgical Epilepsy Evaluation and Functional Brain   Mapping Laboratory, Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Geneva,   Switzerland). Blanke recently described a patient with induced OBE by   inhibition of cortical activity caused by more intense external electrical   stimulation of neuronal networks in the gyrus angularis in a patient with   epilepsy.35

    We have to conclude that localized   artificial stimulation with real photons (electrical or magnetic energy)   disturbs and inhibits the constantly changing electromagnetic fields of our   neuronal networks, thereby influencing and inhibiting the normal functions of   our brain. Could consciousness and memories be the product or the result of   these constantly changing fields of photons? Could these photons be the   elementary carriers of consciousness?31

    Some researchers try to create   artificial intelligence by computer technology, hoping to simulate programs   evoking consciousness. But Roger Penrose, a quantum physicist, argues that   'Algorithmic computations cannot simulate mathematical reasoning. The brain, as   a closed system capable of internal and consistent computations, is insufficient   to elicit human consciousness.'36 Penrose offers a quantum mechanical   hypothesis to explain the relation between consciousness and the brain. And   Simon Berkovitch, a professor in Computer Science of the George Washington   University, has calculated that the brain has an absolutely inadequate capacity   to produce and store all the informational processes of all our memories with   associative thoughts. We would need 1024 operations per second, which   is absolutely impossible for our neurons.37 Herms Romijn, a Dutch   neurobiologist, comes to the same conclusion.30 One should conclude   that the brain has not enough computing capacity to store all the memories with   associative thoughts from one's life, has not enough retrieval abilities, and   seems not to be able to elicit consciousness.     &nbsp;

&nbsp;     7. QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THE BRAIN

  &nbsp;

  With our current medical and   scientific concepts it seems impossible to explain all aspects of the subjective   experiences as reported by patients with an NDE during their period of cardiac   arrest, during a transient loss of all functions of the brain. But science, I   believe, is the search for explaining new mysteries rather than the cataloguing   of old facts and concepts. So it is a scientific challenge to discuss new   hypotheses that could explain the reported interconnectedness with the   consciousness of other persons and of deceased relatives, to explain the   possibility to experience instantaneously and simultaneously (non-locality)   a review and a preview of someone's life in a dimension without our   conventional body-linked concept of time and space, where all past, present   and future events exist, and the possibility to have clear consciousness with   memories from early childhood, with self-identity, with cognition, and with   emotion, and the possibility of perception out and above one's lifeless body.

  We should   conclude, like many others, that quantum mechanical processes could have   something critical to do with how consciousness and memories relate with the   brain and the body during normal daily activities as well as during brain death   or clinical death.

  I would like now to discuss some   aspects of quantum physics, because this seems necessary to understand my   concept of the continuity of consciousness. Quantum physics has completely   overturned the existing view of our material, manifest world, the so-called   real-space. It tells us that particles can propagate like waves, and so can be   described by a quantum mechanical wave function. It can be proven that light in   some experiments behaves like particles (photons), and in other experiments it   behaves like waves, and both experiments are true. So waves and particles are   complementary aspects of light (Bohr).38 The experiment of   Aspect, based on Bell's theorem, has established non-locality in quantum   mechanics (non-local interconnectedness).39 Non-locality   happens because all events are interrelated and influence each other.

  Phase-space is an invisible, non-local, higher-dimensional space   consisting of fields of probability, where every past and future   event is available as a possibility. Within this phase-space no matter is   present, everything belongs to uncertainty, and neither measurements nor   observations are possible by physicists.40 The act of observation   instantly changes a probability into an actuality by collapse of the wave   function. Roger Penrose calls this resolution of multiple possibilities into one   definitive state 'objective reduction'.35 So it seems that no   observation is possible without fundamentally changing    the observed subject; only subjectivity   remains.

  The phase-speed in this invisible   and non-measurable phase-space varies from the speed of light to infinity, while   the speed of particles in our manifest physical real-space varies from zero to   the speed of light. At the speed of light, the speed of a particle and the speed   of the wave are identical. But the slower the particle, the faster the   wave-speed, and when the particle stops, the wave-speed is infinite. The   phase-space generates events that can be located in our space-time continuum,   the manifest world, or real-space. Everything visible emanates form the   invisible.

  According to Stuart Hameroff and   Roger Penrose, microtubules in neurons may process information generated by   self-organizing patterns, giving rise to coherent states, and these states could   be the explanation of the possibility of experiencing consciousness.42  Herms Romijn argues that the continuously changing electromagnetic fields   of the neuronal networks, which can be considered as a biological quantum   coherence phenomenon, possibly could be the elementary 'carriers' of   consciousness.31

  Quantum physics cannot explain the essence of consciousness or   the secret of life, but in my concept it is helpful for understanding the   transition between the fields of consciousness in the phase-space (to be   compared with the probability fields as we know from quantum mechanics) and the   body-linked waking consciousness in the real-space, because these are the two   complementary aspects of consciousness.41 Our whole and undivided   consciousness with declarative memories finds its origin in, and is stored in   this phase-space, and the cortex only serves as a relay station for parts of our   consciousness and parts of our memories to be received into our waking   consciousness. In this concept consciousness is not physically rooted. This   could be compared with the internet, which does not originate from the computer   itself, but is only received by it.

  Life creates the transition from phase-space into our   manifest real-space; according to our hypothesis life creates the possibility to   receive the fields of consciousness (waves) into the waking consciousness which   belongs to our physical body (particles). During life, our consciousness has an   aspect of waves as well as of particles, and there is a permanent interaction   between these two aspects of consciousness. This concept is a complementary   theory, like both the wave and particle aspects of light, and not a dualistic   theory. Subjective (conscious) experiences and the corresponding objective   physical properties are two fundamentally different manifestations of one and   the same underlying deeper reality; they cannot be reduced to each other.30   The particle aspect, the physical aspect of consciousness in the material world,   originates from the wave aspect of our consciousness from the phase-space by   collapse of the wave function into particles ('objective reduction'), and can be   measured by means of EEG, MEG, MRI, and PET scan. And different neuronal   networks function as interface for different aspects of our consciousness, as   can be demonstrated by changing images during these registrations of EEG, MRI or   PET scan. The wave aspect of our indestructible consciousness in phase-space,   with non-local interconnectedness, is inherently not measurable by physical   means. When we die, our consciousness will no longer have an aspect of   particles, but only an eternal aspect of waves.

  With this new concept about consciousness and the mind-brain   relation all reported elements of an NDE during cardiac arrest could be   explained. This concept is also compatible with the non-local interconnectedness   with fields of consciousness of other persons in phase-space. Following an NDE   most people, often to their own amazement and confusion, experience an enhanced   intuitive sensibility, like clairvoyance and clairaudience, or prognostic   dreams, in which they 'dream' about future events. In people with an NDE the   functional receiving capacity seems to be permanently enhanced. When you compare   this with a TV set, you receive not only Channel 1, the transmission of your   personal consciousness, but simultaneously Channels 2, 3 and 4 with aspects of   consciousness of others. This remote, non-local communication seems to   have been demonstrated scientifically by positioning subject pairs in two   separate Faraday chambers, which effectively rules out any electromagnetic   transfer mechanism. A visual pattern-reversal stimulus is used to elicit visual   evoked responses in the EEG registration of the stimulated subject, and this was  instantaneously received by the non-stimulated subject resulting in an   analogous neural event with a similar brain wave morphology, or transferred   potentials, as revealed on the EEG.43,44

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  8. THE ROLE OF   DNA

  &nbsp;

  How should we understand the interaction between our   consciousness and our functioning brain in our continuously changing body? As   stated before, during our life the composition of our body changes continuously,   as during each second 500000 cells are being replaced in our body. What could be   the basis of the continuity of our changing body? Cells and molecules are just   the building blocks. In assessing all the theories mentioned above, it seems   reasonable to consider the person-specific DNA in our cells as the place of   resonance, or the interface across which a constant informational exchange takes   place between our personal material body and the phase-space, where all fields   of our personal consciousness are available as fields of possibility.

  DNA is a molecule, composed of nucleotides, with a double   helix structure. In humans it is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes, defines   30,000 genes, and contains about 3 billion base pairs.45 About 95% of   human DNA has a still unknown function, for which reason it is called 'junk   DNA,' non-protein-coding DNA, or introns,46 and the 5% protein-coding   called exons. The more complex a species is, the more introns it has. Simon   Berkovich assumes that&nbsp; this 'junk DNA' could have an identifying purpose,   comparable to a kind of 'barcode' functionality. According to his hypothesis DNA   itself does not contain the hereditary material, but is capable of receiving   hereditary information and memories from the past, as well as the morphogenetic   information, which contains the way the body will be built with all its   different cell systems with specialized functions.47 Person-specific   DNA is in this model the receiver as well as the transmitter of our permanently   evolving personal consciousness.

  According to Erwin Schr'dinger, a quantum physicist, DNA is   an a-statistic molecule, and a-statistic processes are quantum mechanical   processes which originate from phase-space.48 In his theory&nbsp; DNA   should function as a quantum antenna with non-local communication, and also   Stuart Hameroff considers DNA as a chain of quantum bits (qubits) with helical   twist, and according to him DNA could function in a way analogous to   superconductive quantum interference devices. In his quantum computer model&nbsp; the   3 billion base pairs should function as qubits with quantum superposition of   simultaneously zero and one.49

  Following a heart transplant, the donor heart contains DNA   material foreign to the recipient. In a&nbsp; few recent books it has been reported   that sometimes the recipient experiences thoughts and feelings that are totally   strange and new, and later it becomes obvious that they fit with the character   and consciousness of the deceased donor. 50,51 The DNA in the donor   heart seems to give rise to fields of consciousness that are received by the   organ recipient. Unfortunately, until now scientific research on this has not   been possible due to the reluctance of the transplant centers.

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  9. ANALOGY WITH   WORLDWIDE COMMUNICATION

  &nbsp;

  In trying to understand this concept of quantum mechanical   mutual interaction between the invisible phase-space and our visible, material   body, it seems appropriate to compare it with modern worldwide communication.   There is a continuous exchange of objective information by means of   electromagnetic fields for radio, TV, mobile telephone, or laptop computer. We   are unaware of the vast amounts of electromagnetic fields that constantly, day   and night, exist around us and through us, as well as through structures like   walls and buildings. We only become aware of these electromagnetic informational   fields at the moment we use our mobile telephone or by switching on our radio,   TV or laptop. What we receive is not inside the instrument, nor in the   components, but thanks to the receiver, the information from the electromagnetic   fields becomes observable to our senses and hence perception occurs in our   consciousness. The voice we hear over our telephone is not inside the telephone.   The concert we hear over our radio is transmitted to our radio. The images and   music we hear and see on TV are transmitted to our TV set. The internet is not   located inside our laptop. We can receive what is transmitted with the speed of   light from a distance of some hundreds or thousands of miles. And if we switch   off the TV set, the reception disappears, but the transmission continues. The   information transmitted remains present within the electromagnetic fields. The   connection has been interrupted, but it has not vanished and can still be   received elsewhere by using another TV set ('non-locality').

    Could our brain be compared to the   TV set, which receives electromagnetic waves and transforms them into image and   sound, as well as to the TV camera, which transforms image and sound into   electromagnetic waves? This electromagnetic radiation holds the essence of all   information, but is only perceivable by our senses through suitable instruments   like camera and TV set.

  The   informational fields of our consciousness and of our memories, both evolving   during our lifetime by our experiences and by the informational input from our   sense organs, are present around us, and become available to our waking   consciousness only through our functioning brain (and other cells of our body)   in the shape of electromagnetic fields. As soon as the function of the brain has   been lost, as in clinical death or brain death, memories and consciousness do   still exist, but the receptivity is lost, the connection is interrupted.

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  10. CONCLUSION

  &nbsp;

  According to our concept, grounded on the reported aspects of   consciousness experienced during cardiac arrest, we can conclude that our   consciousness could be based on fields of information, consisting of waves, and   that it originates in the phase-space. During cardiac arrest, the functioning of   the brain and of other cells in our body stops because of anoxia. The   electromagnetic fields of our neurons and other cells disappear, and the   possibility of resonance, the interface between consciousness and physical body,   is interrupted.

  Such understanding fundamentally changes one's opinion about   death, because of the almost unavoidable conclusion that at the time of physical   death consciousness will continue to be experienced in another dimension, in an   invisible and immaterial world, the phase-space, in which all past, present and   future is enclosed. Research on NDE cannot give us the irrefutable scientific   proof of this conclusion, because people with an NDE did not quite die, but they   all were very, very close to death, without a functioning brain.

  The conclusion that consciousness can be experienced   independently of brain function might well induce a huge change in the   scientific paradigm in western medicine, and could have practical implications   in actual medical and ethical problems such as the care for comatose or dying   patients, euthanasia, abortion, and the removal of organs for transplantation   from somebody in the dying process with a beating heart in a warm body but a   diagnosis of brain death.

  There are still more questions than answers, but, based on   the aforementioned theoretical aspects of the obviously experienced continuity   of our consciousness, we finally should consider the possibility that death,   like birth, may well be a mere passing from one state of consciousness to   another.
