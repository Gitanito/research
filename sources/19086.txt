the national security state people and
potentially working with and through the
to the stars Academy are going to be
pitching this problem say well you know
we can&#39;t just let that our whole
civilization know that there is this
highly advanced technologically superior
society out there and because our whole
culture will collapse whereas in fact is
quite clear that it&#39;s their defense of
the elite this 1% of the human family
that basically ends up controlling over
40 percent of all the wealth on the
planet that they&#39;re really defending it

defend so that you see that this is a a
subset of a larger question but how
spiritual consciousness and the
evolution of consciousness of
understanding what we really are in the
makeup of the universe is a threat in
itself if you take from um from Italy
and someone from Japan very different
cultures very different people
personalities backgrounds emotional
temperament no extrapolate that out
across the cosmos
think of the vast differences we&#39;re

something deeper and that point of
commonality has been folded within each
of us and that is we are awake conscious
beings they are awake we are awake that
Faculty of being aware of awareness the
consciousness not which conscious of but
the means to be awake that is a
singularity and once we&#39;re anchored into
that state of consciousness the unit of
state
there aren&#39;t any aliens there are just
other people who are a little different
from us this is the point where we can
make contact most easily
