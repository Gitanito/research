 In a query posted at http://www.levity.com/alchemy/frm1400.html, Art Kunklin gives a fascinating overview of "Adiramled" (Delmar DeForest Bryant, Franklin, Pennsylvania, April 30, 1858 - Oklahoma, 1939), the author and editor of this journal.  "Adiramled" was pronounced with emphasis on the penultimate syllable and was said to have been an initiatic name given Bryant.   The name appears to be the reverse of his name ("Delmar") and "Ida"--who perhaps was the complement in his endeavors and was probably Ida Earley Bryant with whom he lived.  She and George W. Carey and Bryant started a rhubarb business in Southern California in 1908.  Bryant was a socialist, radical individualist, and practicing alchemist and the author of both books and lessons on alchemy, especially as "the occult solution of sex."  These almost certainly included some form of the use of sexual power for magical, spiritual and alchemical purposes: he describes the work of his Adiramled School of Hermetic Science  as "Thought-sexation," and quotes from and advertises the books of P.B. Randolph and other New Thought sexual mages with similar ideas, such as Harry Gaze and Alexander James McIvor-Tyndall.  On Gaze, see the notes under Physical Immortality, Soundview, New Daily Life, and The Gaze.  Ohio Historical Society microfilm (incomplete).
