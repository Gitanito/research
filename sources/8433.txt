  ABSTRACT:&nbsp; The 1975 publication of Life after Life (Moody, 1975) led to wide   public recognition of near death experience (NDE).&nbsp; No prior study has   investigated the similarities and differences of NDEs occurring before and after   1975.&nbsp; Much of the earliest NDE research, in the late 1970's and early 1980's,   would have studied NDEs occurring predominantly before 1975.&nbsp; If the content and   aftereffects of NDEs remained constant before and after 1975, this earliest NDE   research may be considered applicable to NDEs occurring more recently.&nbsp; This   study uses the methodology of an Internet based questionnaire survey which has   not been previously reported.&nbsp; A total of 218 NDErs were surveyed.&nbsp; The only   statistical differences between the group with NDEs before 1975 (n=48) compared   with the group with NDEs during or after 1975 (n=170) were due to expected   differences in NDEr age at the time of the NDE, and age currently.&nbsp; No other   significant difference was found between these two groups with regard to NDE   demographics, experience elements, or aftereffects studied.

  INTRODUCTION

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near death experience   (NDE) is a phrase first used by Dr. Raymond Moody in his landmark book 'Life   after Life' (Moody, 1975).&nbsp; Following publication of this best-selling book in   1975, there was tremendous public and media interest resulting in wide   recognition of NDE.&nbsp; It would be of considerable interest to know if NDEs   occurring before 1975 &nbsp;differ in any way from those occurring during or after   the 1975 publication of 'Life after Life.'&nbsp; Identifying significant differences   in NDEs occurring before and after 1975 would have implications for NDE   research.&nbsp; The earliest NDE research, from the late 1970's and early 1980's,   would have investigated NDEs occurring predominantly before 1975.&nbsp; Today's NDE   research investigates an ever-growing number of NDEs occurring after 1975.&nbsp; If   NDE elements remain reasonably constant among NDEs occurring over many decades,   extrapolation of older NDE research findings to those experiencing NDEs more   recently would be reasonable.

  Any retrospective study of the   details of NDEs occurring many years ago must rely on the NDErs accurate   recollection of their experience.&nbsp; Van Lommel, et. al., recently presented the   strongest evidence that details of individual NDE accounts remain consistent   between shortly after their occurrence and years later (van Lommel, 2001).&nbsp; This   investigation prospectively studied 344 cardiac arrest survivors that included a   group of 62 who had a NDE.&nbsp; Careful interviews of NDErs were conducted within   several weeks of the NDE, and again at two and eight years later.&nbsp; Although the   experience was repeatedly recorded over a span of eight years, the investigators   found virtually no change in the details of the experience over time (van Lommel,   2001).&nbsp; This conclusion is certainly consistent with the almost   uniform confidence of NDErs in their recollection of the NDE, even if it   occurred long ago.&nbsp; Given the preceding, we have reasonable confidence in the   validity of recent surveys of NDErs to allow comparison of NDEs occurring before   and after 1975.

  &nbsp;

  METHODOLOGY

  This study is a retrospective review of   data received from an Internet web-based survey.&nbsp; Such a methodology for   studying NDE has not been previously reported.&nbsp; To compare NDEs occurring before   and after 1975, data from the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF)   web site,     www.nderf.org , was utilized (Long, 2002). This   web site was first published in August 1998.&nbsp; The web site has always contained   a detailed questionnaire form for NDErs to share their experiences.&nbsp; The   original questionnaire form was modified in February 1999, and remained   unchanged from that time (Long, 2002).&nbsp; Contributors give informed consent as   the questionnaire introduction and instructions disclose the purpose of the   survey, use of material submitted, assurance of confidentiality to the extent   requested by the contributors, and lack of compensation for participation in the   survey.&nbsp; This questionnaire form contains a section for NDErs to share a   narrative of their experience, and asks over 50 questions regarding   demographics, experience elements, and aftereffects.&nbsp; Many questions allow a   response of 'Yes,' 'No,' 'Uncertain,' and the default response of 'No response'   ('Y,N,U,NR' questions).&nbsp; A narrative response may be entered following each   Y,N,U,NR question.&nbsp; One question asks 'Date   of experience,' and allows a narrative response.&nbsp; All submissions to the web   questionnaire form were entered into a database. &nbsp;A mail-merge document was   created allowing review of questionnaire responses merged next to the specific   questions asked in the survey form.&nbsp; A single document was created from the   combination of all mail-merged survey responses to allow a search of all   accounts by key words.&nbsp; For those web survey contributors allowing e-mail   contact, NDERF has a policy of e-mailing the contributor a copy of their   submission, with a request to review it for accuracy.&nbsp; Both of this study's   investigators reviewed all web questionnaire submissions.

  Approximately 50% of all experiences   submitted to the     www.nderf.org  web site met our research   definition of NDE as 'A lucid   experience associated with perceived consciousness apart from the body occurring   at the time of actual or threatened imminent death' (Long, 2002).&nbsp; If either   investigator made a finding that the submitted experience did not   meet this definition, the NDE was excluded from analysis.&nbsp; Consensus of both   investigators regarding classification of submitted experiences was achieved for   the overwhelming majority of experiences.&nbsp; The NDERF definition of NDE is   consistent with the definition utilized by van Lommel:

  &nbsp;

  'We defined NDE as the reported   memory of all impressions during a special state of consciousness, including   specific elements such as out-of-body experience, pleasant feelings, and seeing   a tunnel, a light, deceased relatives, or a life review.'&nbsp; (van Lommel, 2001, p.   2040).

  &nbsp;

  Van Lommel's definitional   component of a 'special state of consciousness' is certainly achieved by, and   perhaps more narrowly defined, by our definition of NDE.&nbsp; Moreover, van Lommel's   definitional component of 'specific elements such as out-of-body experience,   pleasant feelings, and seeing a tunnel, a light, deceased relatives, or a life   review' is consistent with the experience elements typically encountered in the   accounts reviewed for this study.

  NDEs occurring before 1975 were   compared to NDEs occurring during or after 1975 with regard to demographics,   experience elements, and aftereffects.&nbsp; A total of 227 NDEs were submitted on   the web questionnaire form from February 1999 to the time of analysis in April   2002.&nbsp; Of these, nine NDEs were excluded from analysis, as they did not provide   the year the NDE occurred or multiple NDEs were shared on the questionnaire form   preventing clear analysis of a single NDE.&nbsp; The remaining 218 NDEs provided the   year the experience occurred and are analyzed in this study.&nbsp; Occasionally, the   respondent answered the web survey question 'Date of experience' with a range of   years, indicating the respondent had some uncertainty regarding the exact year   of the experience.&nbsp; The midpoint of the range of years provided was used for   analysis.&nbsp; Only one NDE per person was analyzed.&nbsp; Only NDEs contributed by the   NDEr personally were included in this study.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several methods were   used to assess the validity of the NDERF web questionnaire.&nbsp; At the end of the   web survey, respondents were asked, 'Did the questions asked and information you   provided accurately and comprehensively describe your experience?'&nbsp; Of 204 NDErs   responding to this question (out of the total 227 NDErs responding to the   survey), the responses were:

  &nbsp;

  Response &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Percent

  'Yes'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   163&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 79.9%

  'No'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.8%

  'Uncertain'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.3%

  
  
  &nbsp;

  The nearly 80% positive response   to this question is encouraging regarding the accuracy and comprehensiveness of   the information received from this survey.&nbsp; This is especially impressive, as   NDE is often considered ineffable.

  The validity of the web survey was further   assessed by reviewing responses to two similar questions asked in different   sections of the questionnaire form.&nbsp; When analyzing the check box question 'Did   your experience include light?' of all 227 NDEs submitted, 156   (68.7%) answered affirmatively.&nbsp; Later a question was asked 'Did you see a   light?'&nbsp; Of 215 responding to the question, 144 (67.0%) answered 'Yes.'&nbsp; When   analyzing    the check box question 'Did your experience include   life review?' of all 227 NDEs submitted, 58 (25.6%) answered affirmatively.&nbsp;   Later a question was asked 'Did you experience a review of past events in your   life?'&nbsp; Of 211 responding to the question, 63 (29.9%) answered 'Yes.'&nbsp; The   consistency of these responses further suggests the reliability of responses to   the web survey.

The 218 NDEs   initially analyzed for this study were separated into two groups, one group with   the NDE occurring before 1975, and the other group with the NDE occurring during   or after 1975.&nbsp; Chi-square analysis of the responses of both groups to 21   Y,N,U,NR questions was performed.&nbsp; These 21 questions included three demographic   questions, 12 questions regarding NDE elements, and five questions regarding   experience aftereffects.&nbsp; It was noted that many questions had very few   'Uncertain' responses, which could reduce the reliability of the chi-square   analyses.&nbsp; Thus, chi-square analyses were performed using a 3x3 table with the   responses 'Yes,' 'Uncertain,' and 'No' considered, and responses to the same   question were also analyzed with a 2x2 table considering only the responses of   'Yes' and 'No.'&nbsp; Chi-square analyses were also performed on an additional 11   questions that included five demographic questions, one question regarding NDE   elements, and four questions regarding experience aftereffects.

&nbsp;

  RESULTS

  Of 218 NDEs reviewed, 48 (22%) occurred before 1975   and 170 (78%) occurred during or after 1975.&nbsp; For NDEs occurring before 1975,   the year the NDE occurred ranged from 1943 to 1974, with the average year of NDE   occurrence  of   1963.&nbsp; For NDEs occurring during or after 1975, the year the NDE occurred ranged   from 1975 to 2002, with the average year of NDE occurrence    of 1990.&nbsp;

  Questions asked for this study are   abbreviated in the 'Element' column in the table below.&nbsp; The full text of the   questions asked is on the     www.nderf.org  web site (Long, 2002).&nbsp;   Fifty-three chi-square analyses were performed, with results shown below.&nbsp; When   an exponent ('E' below) is used to express a p value, the exponent is to the 10th   power.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the large   number of analyses performed, the p value indicating significance was selected   to be 0.01.&nbsp; Of the 53 chi-square tests performed, significance indicated by p &lt;   0.01was found in only four.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a   statically significant difference between NDEs occurring before and after 1975,   and age at time of experience (less than 18, or greater than or equal to 18   years old) with p=0.00000525.&nbsp; The trend was in the direction of NDEs occurring   before 1975 more likely to be less than 18 years old at the time of the   experience.&nbsp; This finding is expected, as those having NDEs at a younger age,   before 1975, would have a higher probability of living the additional   approximately 25 years after their NDE necessary for them to share their   experience recently on the web survey.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a   statically significant difference between &nbsp;NDEs occurring before and after 1975,   and age of the NDEr at time of sharing the account on the web survey (less than   age 40, or greater than or equal to 40 years old) with p=0.00000593.&nbsp; This is   also an expected finding, as NDErs with their experience occurring prior to 1975   would be expected to be older on the average than NDErs with their experience   occurring during or after 1975.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A statistically   significant difference was observed between the two groups and the question   'Following the experience, have you had any other events in your life,   medications or substances which reproduced any part of the experience?' with   p=0.000623 for Y,N,U,NR question analysis, and p=0.000132 for analysis of Yes/No   responses only.&nbsp; The most likely explanation for this finding is that NDErs with   their experience before 1975 have lived longer following their NDE, allowing a   higher probability of encountering an event in their life that might reproduce   some part of the experience.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a trend   toward a statistically significant difference between the two groups in response   to the question 'Did you have any changes of attitudes or beliefs following the   experience?' with p=0.089 for the Y,N,U,NR question analysis, and p=0.031 for   analysis of Yes/No responses only.&nbsp; The trend was in the direction NDEs   occurring before 1975 more likely to respond 'No.'&nbsp; This finding should be   interpreted cautiously, as there is only borderline statistical significance.&nbsp;   Further, due to the small number of respondents both answering 'No' to this   question and having their NDE before 1975, the reliability of using chi-square   in the analysis of responses to this question is diminished.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most striking   finding from the Chi-Square Analyses Results table is the lack of statistical   significance in 49 of 53 analyses performed.&nbsp; This strongly suggests no   significant differences between NDEs occurring before 1975 as compared with NDEs   occurring during or after 1975 in our web survey respondents.&nbsp; The few   exceptions are discussed above.&nbsp; All other questions pertaining to demographics,   experience elements and aftereffects were not significantly different between   the two groups.

  DISCUSSION

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study presents a   methodology to study NDE that has not been previously reported.&nbsp; Respondents are   self-selected, must have access to Internet connection, be literate in English,   and be willing to complete a web survey.&nbsp; Thus, our web survey respondents may   not be representative of all NDErs as a whole.&nbsp; The issue of studying   self-selected NDErs is an unavoidable issue in any web survey, and a concern   with virtually all other NDE research.&nbsp; The methodology of this study comparing   two groups responding to the same survey helps mitigate this concern regarding   the results of this study.&nbsp; An advantage of the web survey methodology used is   the ability to survey NDErs throughout the United States and around the world.&nbsp;   The web survey included respondents predominantly from the United States, but   also included many respondents from several other countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment of the   validity of the survey results was accomplished in several ways.&nbsp; Of the two   most similar questions asked in the survey in a redundant fashion, the   percentages of affirmative responses were very similar.&nbsp; The majority of   respondents were e-mailed a narrative of their survey response, including the   survey questions and their responses to the questions.&nbsp; All were encouraged to   review their survey response for accuracy.&nbsp; There were few who subsequently   contacted us regarding corrections, and such corrections were almost uniformly   minor.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is   considered highly unlikely there is any significant number of plagiarized or   fraudulent accounts submitted to the web survey and analyzed in this study.&nbsp;   There was no compensation for completing the web survey, which would   significantly reduce the incentive to share plagiarized or falsified accounts.&nbsp;   Neither investigator reviewing the accounts submitted from the web survey recall   any being commercially published, in whole or in part, elsewhere.&nbsp; Scores of   experiences have been posted on the       www.nderf.org  web site over the years with   well over 100 posted at the current time, which has been a major focus of this   web site.&nbsp; In the history of the web site, there have been well over 100,000   visitors, with vast numbers of people reading the posted experiences.&nbsp; The   investigators may be contacted easily from e-mail links throughout the web   site.&nbsp; We have only been contacted regarding one fraudulent posted account in   the history of the web site.&nbsp; This account was collected by a prior NDERF   associate, and was not shared via the web survey.&nbsp; No other significant concerns   about the validity of any other posted accounts have ever been communicated to   us.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When respondents were   asked in the web survey 'Did the questions asked and information you provided   accurately and comprehensively describe your experience?' 163 (79.9%) of 204   NDErs responding to the question answered 'Yes.'&nbsp; Only 20 (9.8%) responded   'No.'&nbsp; Given the complex and often ineffable nature of NDE, these results   strongly suggest the ability of the web survey to allow the NDE to be accurately   conveyed.&nbsp; Many NDE contributions consist of experiences occurring decades ago.&nbsp;   As previously noted, the van Lommel study found virtually no change in NDE   accounts when NDErs were asked to retell their account two and eight years after   the&nbsp; experience (van Lommel, 2001, p. 2042).&nbsp; Most NDErs are highly confident of   their recollection of the details of NDEs occurring many years ago.

  From the preceding, the web survey methodology of   this study seems valid to retrospectively study NDE and reach the conclusions of   this study.&nbsp; Advances in Internet access and its growing availability suggest   this Internet based research methodology may be increasingly important in the   future.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major finding of this study is that from the web survey results,   there is no statistically significant difference between NDEs occurring before   1975 as compared to NDEs occurring during or after 1975.&nbsp; The only exceptions to   this have been discussed, and are attributable to NDEr age at the time of the   experience and age now.&nbsp; No other significant difference was found between these   two groups with regard to NDE demographics, experience elements, or aftereffects   studied between the 48 NDEs occurring before 1975, and the 170 NDEs occurring   during or after 1975.&nbsp; We are not aware of any prior study of the similarities   and differences of NDEs occurring before and after 1975.&nbsp; For obvious reasons,   there cannot be a prospective study comparing NDEs before 1975 to those   occurring during or after 1975.&nbsp; This issue can only be addressed by   retrospective studies, such as this study.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As previously noted,   the earliest NDE research of the late 1970's and early 1980's would have studied   NDEs occurring predominantly prior to 1975.&nbsp; This study suggests older NDE   research findings may be reasonably considered to be applicable to NDEs   occurring more recently.&nbsp; The results of this study are suggestive that NDEs   likely do not change significantly over time.&nbsp; A more valid statistical   methodology to determine if there are any changes in NDEs over time would be to   consider the year the NDE occurred as a continuous variable for all 218 NDErs,   and compare the year of NDE occurrence with other NDE elements using the   appropriate statistical method.&nbsp; Such an analysis is beyond the scope of this   study.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that this study   finds no significant difference between NDEs occurring before and after 1975, it   is appropriate to address the possible concern that what NDErs share about their   experience may be influenced by their prior understandings about NDE.&nbsp; Such   influence on the details of the experience shared by NDErs could potentially   occur from exposure to information regarding NDE prior to their experience,   after their experience, or both.&nbsp; If the details of NDEs shared after 1975 were   influenced by the NDErs prior knowledge of NDE from other published or shared   accounts, this could theoretically explain the consistency of the NDE elements   and aftereffects reported by NDErs after 1975.&nbsp; This concern has been previously   raised by some NDE critics, who may refer to recent NDEs as 'copycat'   experiences.&nbsp; Prior to 1975 it would have been extremely unlikely for an NDEr to   be aware of, and potentially influenced by, the NDE experiences of others.&nbsp;   After 1975, there was increasing recognition of NDE over time by the public,   with NDE accounts widely shared in media presentations, books, and organizations   interested in NDE.&nbsp; Such increased recognition of NDE and the often intense   public interest in NDE could potentially have influenced what NDErs share.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The available   evidence suggests the similarity of NDE elements and aftereffects described in   NDEs occurring before and after 1975 are due to the experiences actual   similarity, and not due to older experiences influencing the details of NDEs   shared more recently.&nbsp; The strongest evidence for this is from the van Lommel   study (van Lommel, 2001).&nbsp; As previously noted, this study found essentially no   change in accounts NDErs shared when NDErs were asked to tell their account   several weeks, two years, and eight years after its occurrence.&nbsp; In reviewing   the accounts used in this study, we are quite impressed with both the similarity   and diversity of the NDEs shared on the web survey.&nbsp; Subjectively, we see no   pattern in the narrative accounts of NDEs occurring after 1975 suggesting any   influence on them from the narrative accounts of NDEs occurring before 1975.&nbsp;

  To further investigate whether or not   awareness of widely known NDE accounts or NDE researchers influenced the content   of experiences shared with the     www.nderf.org  web site, we electronically   searched the text in approximately 500 experiences, representing all experiences   ever shared with the NDERF web site.&nbsp; Based on our research definition of NDE,   these experiences included both NDE and non-NDE accounts.&nbsp; The rationale for   evaluating all experiences shared with the NDERF web site is to allow these   results to be more generally applicable, and to avoid excluding experiences   solely based on our research definition of NDE.&nbsp; Key words we searched for were   the names of seven widely known NDErs and NDE researchers.&nbsp; In these   approximately 500 accounts, only Dr. Raymond Moody, Dannion Brinkley, and Dr.   Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, were mentioned.&nbsp; Dr. Raymond Moody was the most   frequently mentioned, with his name appearing in seven accounts.&nbsp; These accounts   mostly involve experiences occurring before 1975, and indicate how his book   'Life after Life' positively affected their understanding of their experience.&nbsp;   Dannion Brinkley was mentioned in three accounts, all of whom had their   experience after 1975.&nbsp; Only one comment was in regard to his NDE, the other two   comments discussed his Compassion In Action movement.&nbsp; Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,   was mentioned in two accounts.&nbsp; Both reported the great impact that her work had   on them.&nbsp; If well known NDErs or researchers were highly influential among the   experiencers sharing their accounts, it would be expected they would be   mentioned more frequently than was observed.&nbsp; The very small number of accounts   mentioning well known NDErs or NDE researchers suggests they likely had little   or no influence on the NDErs reporting of the details of their experiences.

  The data from the web survey are analyzed in a   spreadsheet that has been designed to recalculate all chi-square results   automatically as data from new NDEs is added.&nbsp; This will allow relatively easy   re-analysis of results as additional NDEs are contributed over time.&nbsp; As   additional NDEs are shared, it would be interesting to reproduce this study with   more data which would result in even greater confidence in the study findings.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NDERF   will continue the     www.nderf.org  web site as a public service   and continues to encourage experience contributions.&nbsp; The investigators extend a   heartfelt thanks to the large number of experiencers who have shared with us   over the years, and whose willingness to share has made this study possible.
