 The People's Popular Penny Spiritual Paper
 1887  Weekly
 London and Manchester, England.  Publisher: John Heywood (London), Two Worlds Publishing Co. Limited (Manchester).  Editor: Emma Hardinge Britten with E.W. Wallis as sub-editor (from 1887 through February 1892);  E.W. Wallis, Will Phillips, and (from 1906)  J.J. Morse; Ernest W. Oaten; Maurice Barbanell.
 1/1, November 18, 1887-current.   16 pp., 8/1/2 x 14.  One penny a week.

 This was begun by Emma Hardinge Britten who edited it until she left in a huff early in 1892 to begin The Unseen Universe.  The early issues bear her stamp and tend toward the occult, with excerpts from her Ghost Land and articles by "Sirius" that were heavily larded with quotations from her Art Magic.  The early years of the journal also regularly featured two full pages of "Services for Sunday," announcements for spiritualist services in Britain, and three full pages of "Chronicles of Society Work," on the happenings in local spiritualist societies.  The journal was less intellectual and more vigorous and provincial than its London competitors.  It was "the people’s popular penny spiritual paper," as its motto and advertisements read.  When James Burns’ Medium and Daybreak ceased in 1895, The Two Worlds became the leading exponent of progressive, reform, non-Christian spiritualism in Britain.  It continues to exist.
