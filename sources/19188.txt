the study physics at Johns Hopkins for
my BA degree and then I got a master&#39;s
in business administration at the
University of Chuck Chicago I got my PhD
after that at Portland State University
in system science which was an
interdisciplinary program and my thesis
dealt with a range of both astronomy and
geology area studying a new phenomenon
of how the galactic center can affect
the earth through cosmic ray volleys
my interest in electrogravitics which is
Towson Browns work began in 1985 I was
interested because the physics area had
been working on predicted a coupling
between electricity and gravitation
which is pretty much what Browne was
illustrating experimentally in
particularly let&#39;s say in the standard
physics theory with like general
relativity which is our current theory
of gravitation but you have only one
polarity to gravity so masses can only
attract and there&#39;s no possibility for
gravitational repulsion or anti-gravity
anything the physicist comes up with
that is sort of speculating outside of
that framework there physicists have
proposed that there might be some
coupling between electricity and
gravitation at very high energies and
that&#39;s one of their reasons for building
these huge particle colliders is they&#39;re
hoping to find his connection if they
just look before their eyes the
experimental evidence there is a
connection but it just left normal
laboratory voltages that you can
generate brown-headed kind of a maypole
that you built with two disks that he
would charge the disks and the leading
edge of each disk had a wire that would
emit positive ions and the body the disc
was negatively charged can you see that
is it show up up today and he would
charge an initial experiment this type
that you see here he charged with 50,000
volts about 50 watts of power and this
would spin around around 12 miles per
hour in this circuit and then he is
reported to have done a similar thing
but larger on a 50-foot course charging
to 150,000 volts and these were going
several hundred miles per hour so if you
can picture about like model airplane
speed mile airplanes can go several
hundred miles an hour and this was done
something around 1953 in Pearl Harbor
and it demonstrated to some top brass
from military and the subject is
reported to have become classified after
that they were so impressed with the
results some people have said well this
is due to ion propulsion that the ions
coming off of the front of the craft
somehow blow the craft and cause it to
move and there have been experiments
done to show this is not the case in
fact Brown tested his idea in a vacuum
so there was eliminating the idea of
ions and it actually worked better in a
vacuum I was interested because I I
could explain this with my theory
basically that the positive charges
would create gravitational Wells just
like our current concept of a
gravitational well around a massive
object whereas electrons would would do
the opposite they create gravity hills
which in effect you&#39;d say a
gravitational repulsion effect and so if
you look at Browns discs according to my
theory you get a G a gravity potential
Hill G Hill and towards the negative
charged end of the craft energy well
towards the positive and so there&#39;d be
an effect of gravitational gradient
created across that which would tend to
propel it forward well I know that in 52
he put on a demonstration to the Office
of Naval Research it&#39;s a kind of
interesting that why would they end up
classifying a whole project his whole
concept a year later if there wasn&#39;t
this Syria take this approach to take
him seriously
well I believe that there are many ways
to create a gravitational effects or at
least the approaches i&#39;ve seen i&#39;ve
heard of are quite different
it&#39;s like various ways to skin the cat I
guess Brown was using high voltage
charge and it appears that that
technology is used
the b2 it involves using a maser in this
case is that this would be a different
approach than what Braun was doing this
is using microwaves to create pushes
they will to push a distant surface this
is a a very well known technology in the
area of optics and it&#39;s oh there&#39;s a lot
of literature on it in for use in lit
with lasers but you find nothing in the
air of microwaves and I believe the
reason it&#39;s very highly classified
because of its ability to use for UFO
propulsion and the beauty of this is
that the microwaves stay in the beam
they don&#39;t scatter out that&#39;s the nature
of it so you pump up your beam effect
with energy and it&#39;s not lost it&#39;s like
you&#39;re putting your energy into a tube
it&#39;s a resonator and so in fact you
could create a craft it&#39;s standing on
poles that they affect become like solid
poles between the craft and the ground
and this this is how the for example the
tr-3b is some talk about this using
anti-gravity technology it has three
thrusters on the bottom well this is
what the thrusters would be there have
been triangular UFOs the tr-3b is one of
the triangular-shaped UFOs that we&#39;ve
heard about the UFOs it may be of alien
origin disc shaped and some of them may
be some that we have created ourselves
probably use this technology you often
see three dome domes underneath I
believe these are actually microwave
transmitters for the beams
I think Robert Lazar has spoken about
his experience with few of these devices
at area 51 my first exposure to
the discovery that this anti-gravity
research was quite a big area not talked
about very much but it was it was a
major endeavor by major aerospace
corporations this came from this report
electrolytic systems which I found very
revealing this is a photocopy the way
came about this report I was at the
Library of Congress looking under
gravitation to see if there was anything
closely remotely touching on the subject
of electrogravitics which I had at that
time in 1985 just become acquainted with
its existence through some articles
about Townsend Brown and there was only
one card in the whole catalogue which
came close to this and this was about
this report and it interestingly it was
missing from the stacks and they had to
do a search computer search to see where
could there be another one and fellow
said this must be a very rare report
says it&#39;s only one other library in the
whole US and I said where is that said
wright-patterson Air Force Base so I
went ahead and ordered it through an
interlibrary loan request and it was
surprised that they actually sent it the
copy to me it&#39;s actually a red this is
red cardboard jacket and it&#39;s bound to
side and this was produced by a group
called aviation studies International
which is kind of a think-tank in London
that produces intelligence reports and
they&#39;ve been in existence for earlier
still in existence and this report was
dated in 1956 and was basically trying
to encourage the aircraft industry to
develop brown&#39;s technology townsend
brown&#39;s electrogravitics technology with
the idea of developing a mach 3 fighter
craft or maybe even to commercialize it
so we instead of taking jets we will fly
much faster with electrogravitics
and they did a survey the aviation
industry at that time and they named
some major aircraft companies I have
here in my book sub quantum kinetics I
take up excerpts from this study and
just name some companies it says here
Glenn Martin with the former company
name for Martin Marietta which is now
merged then that&#39;s a different name it
said Glenn Martin now feels ready to say
in public that they are examining the
unified field theory to see what can be
done and so on let&#39;s see then further on
says here companies studying the
implications of gravitic SAR said in a
new statement to include Glenn Martin
convair Sperry Rand Sikorsky Bell Lear
and Clark electronics among companies
who have previously evinced interest
include Lockheed Douglas and Hiller and
they were calling the people were
writing this aviation studies report
we&#39;re calling for a manhattan-style
project to develop this that this was
going to change our whole aviation
technology here then later in Business
Week magazine they listed an impressive
array of companies and institutions
backing gravity research is back in the
50s and that included martin grumman
lockheed Sperry R and so on and also
Hughes Aircraft should be added to the
list I do believe that we have
technology presently developed and which
would allow us to easily navigate the
solar system with it I wouldn&#39;t be
surprised if we had bases on Mars and
the moon
and we&#39;re regularly going there with
these kinds of crafts but let&#39;s say
there was a Roswell crash and they said
that the National Security Agency was
formed to keep this all classified now
something like that it&#39;s very emotional
experience when suddenly your government
officials and you realize that we&#39;ve had
content that there is extraterrestrial
life and they have this advanced
technology and when you&#39;re become very
emotional about something
one of reaction is to hide it and then
to see how can we use this for ourselves
we&#39;ve got to keep one step ahead of
other countries are at that time we had
cold war with the Soviet Union so this
was a rationale was to use it for
military purposes you know you can think
back suppose suppose the same thing
happened a hundred years ago at the time
the automobile was developed I sincerely
believe we&#39;d still be driving horse and
buggies today because it would be the
fear that the automobile could change
warfare with being a much higher speed
travel and obviously we should classify
this at that time it wasn&#39;t the same
mechanism in place for we didn&#39;t have
the NSA and this major program to
contain advanced technologies we think
of it as a science it&#39;s a scientific
discipline it&#39;s based on observation and
it&#39;s open to change and one thing I&#39;ve
learned because I have my degree in
physics from since 69 at that time I was
thinking that it was that way that it
was a very objective science and as you
learn more about it and about the people
about the scientists themselves you
realize how much it is a religion it&#39;s
very closed to its resistive to changing
its fundamental principles like its
relativity is
Foundation the energy conservation laws
and other key foundation for example in
the Patent Office any chance of a new
device coming that could help us to
solve our energy crisis problem which
has its getting its energy from
someplace that the patent examiner
doesn&#39;t understand where it might be
coming from he immediately thinks all
this is in violation of the first law of
thermodynamics which is one of the these
principles the physicists have set up
not thinking well maybe there is a
source of energy that we just haven&#39;t
discovered right now doesn&#39;t necessarily
fit into the physics framework instead
of thinking that way they immediately
reject it thinking well this fellow is a
fraud or he did his measurements wrong
and so it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a very
religious feeling where the examiners
have ascribed to a certain belief system
and anything that challenges that they
will deny its existence this was a case
of a Canadian fellow that had developed
a technology for producing enough power
to power your house out of something
about size of a shoebox it was a new way
of wiring something up so some sort of
nonlinear device and he was very open
about it and publicizing it and trying
to find investors to sell the rights and
as I understand the story his house was
one day surrounded by SWAT team and all
his stuff was confiscated and he was
arrested on the grounds that he was
harboring terrorists technology or
weaponry and he was released if he
signed something that he would not
continue doing work in this area and so
now he&#39;s mowing lawns for a living this
is kind of a very lame excuse for
suppressing this kind of thing in my
opinion if they are really that
frightened about the
new technologies they can always license
them just like you licensed radio
stations or whatever to keep tabs on how
much power produces for what purpose and
I think our current crisis what energy
is important enough that this is the
least they can do instead of arresting
people who are trying to help the world
the way I had concluded that b2 may be
using the electrogravitics technology
Townsend Brown was through a article
published in Aviation Week and space
technology and there were some black
project engineers who had disclosed to
the editor of the magazine about some
black project technology that they were
aware of and one of the things they said
was in relation to the b2 that the b2
charges the leading edge of its wing to
a high voltage and it&#39;s exhaust is
charged to an opposite charge high
voltage charge and they had given some
explanations of how this would help for
example soften the sonic boom if you
charge the leading edge of the wing
which is true in fact it&#39;s one of the
things that Braun had talked about also
the exhaust they were saying how this
helps cool exhaust and disguise the
signature the infrared signature the
glass which is also true they didn&#39;t go
further to explain the tie-in with
electrogravitics and that&#39;s the
connection that I made I realized that
this was in effect a description of
townsend brown&#39;s patented device which
looked something like this in his patent
which was issued in 1962 his electro
kinetics patent and he was proposing a
disc-shaped craft that would use what he
called flame jet generators
these are jet engines that have been
converted into sort of giant Van de
Graaff generators you can actually get
he was proposing that you could get
developed actually 15 million volts
through this technique in effect then
the jet becomes your electrical
generator to effect a high voltage
electric generator and he was saying
with that power you were able to feed
the positive side of the generator to
the front of your craft and generate
your ion just like he was doing in those
small disks that he was testing they
were going hundreds of miles per hour
this is from sub quantum kinetics and it
explains how particle comes into being
okay because the reason I&#39;m talking
about this now is that sub quantum
kinetics allows for the possibility of
materialization and dematerialization
now but if you were to be able to raise
this Jeep G well so this a supercritical
region this fertile region disappeared
this particle theoretically would be
materialized would go back to the vacuum
condition in relation to technology of
spacecraft advanced technology there&#39;s
stories of how crap can actually be
materialized visually and so my theory
about this is that they are able to
affect the gravity field of the craft
and cause this this is within the
context of sub quantum kinetics is how I
would think it would occur is that they
are able to make the craft lighter in
effect like a raised gravity potential
to make a G Hill there and the waves the
formed particles would diminish go more
towards the vacuum state there appears
to be a process where the American
Physical Society spokesman Robert Park
makes fun of the new technology on his
website
and make making sort of sarcastic
comments about it or pointing out how it
breaks certain laws of physics that are
their codes of what they believe is
valid and in effect creating the
impression that the this is a fraudulent
idea that the somebody&#39;s doing something
illegal to be trying to sell this idea
or patent and the case of blacklight
they had long than that against the
inventor of this process who was able to
get energy out of just plain water that
glass of water would produce more energy
than if you had that glass filled with
gasoline which is what Mills is finding
he&#39;s finally ultraviolet light is given
off during this transition and this is
how he generates the energy and he has a
catalyst it&#39;s able to release this
energy well he has made some patents on
this and just as the one patent on this
was about to issue was it been actually
announced in the patent Gazette and was
formally going to issue in a week or two
robert park starts making fun of it on
his website and apparently there must
have been a email campaign or contact at
the patent office it embarrassed the
patent office and they pulled the patent
which is really illegal what they did to
withdraw a patent after it been already
approved to be issued because you&#39;re
according to patent law you&#39;re only oh
really
invention is allowed to be patented if
it works it if it&#39;s something new it can
work and break the laws of physics as
physicists know it and it still has the
right to be patented
time and again technology has driven
physics theory physics theory tends to
be restraining on technological advance
because all you would come up with is
the ideas that your theory happen to
predict now if that was the case our
technological advance would slow to a
halt so the system fortunately our
patent system is set up to allow us to
go beyond the laws of physics to pass
things that work now what the Patent
Office in its current approach is it&#39;s
actually breaking the law
it&#39;s trying to make happy the physicists
who are with merica physical society to
keep them in power with their ideas you
might say and withhold from public use
good inventions that could solve our
problems like the energy crisis and well
backlight power the company that has
this invention is not taking this
lightly and they have initiated court
suit I think very strong possibility
they&#39;re going to win this case but you
see this is not an isolated case is a
whole pattern of this going on the
Patent Office I personally know because
I was at the Patent Office for about a
year and I know some people there and I
know some of the things that were going
on and for example there was somebody I
know who issued a patent on a process of
sending signals faster than the speed of
light this was then made fun of by
robert park on his website through their
connections they had this posted
somewhere is the most ridiculous patent
of the Year award this sort of thing in
effect they embarrassed the Patent
Office and shortly after this happened
this embarrassing this embarrassing
publicity occurred the Commission of the
Patent Office reprimanded the examiner
and his supervisor and he threatened to
fire the supervisor so in effect trying
to satisfy the this-this lobby group
that&#39;s all you can call it it&#39;s a lobby
group that&#39;s outside the government that
has undo
influence on the Patent Office and
shouldn&#39;t really be allowed to I mean
they can say what they want with freedom
of speech but for the Patent Office to
do their bidding instead of following a
law that is illegal
you could argue just on the basis of
viewing physics as a religion in a way a
belief system that anything that
challenges their belief system they&#39;re
going to post and they don&#39;t care it&#39;s
something that&#39;s going to help society
if because it would make them look like
fools that jeez they can&#39;t explain this
and maybe their theories are wrong
people are going to start wondering why
do we send our children to colleges why
are these university professors getting
funded to build huge accelerators which
for what purpose you know why do we
spend billions of dollars on the super
collider in Texas and so there obviously
must be a monetary connection here
whether they are trying to protect their
butts for funding too and it&#39;s
self-interest you know and heck with the
rest of the world you know that global
warming happen if doesn&#39;t fit into our
physics box that&#39;s too bad in effect
these new technologies new energy
technologies for example are the
underdog you have to admit it
they don&#39;t fit into the paradigm that is
currently taught and believed and sort
of so they are left out of getting the
funding to be developed or to get their
paths even to the point that they&#39;re
breaking a lot to prevent them from
their paths from being issued without
their patents being issued how our
investor is going to invest in the
company so we need a massive education
program to educate a patent office on
how how they should follow the laws that
are breaking a law we see already with
the oil problems and the high prices we
have heard about the melting of the
Arctic the rise in temperature global
warming effect these are real so we
really have to start initiating this
program as soon as possible
attention that should be a major issue
of concern for Congress the paradigm
that we&#39;re in that&#39;s been taught in the
being taught in our universities and
physics classes chemistry classes it&#39;s
fine for in the past and it&#39;s done well
but we&#39;re at a point where we need to go
beyond that we are we need technologies
that don&#39;t fit in that paradigm to very
dramatic events occurred at MIT
while cold fusion story was evolving
remember March 23rd 1989 the
announcement but within weeks the hot
fusion people were going into action
behind closed doors to disprove I
inadvertently was looking through some
piles of paper that had been given to me
a casual manner by all these hot fusion
physicists as they were trying to do
their calorimetric
