I was only eight years old, so I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to live. I remember my whole family gathered around the cot I was in. I rose up above them, and saw they were all crying. I could also see myself lying in the cot with a nurse next to me. Next thing I knew, I was traveling very fast through this black tunnel towards a bright light. I was so scared, and crying out for my mum. Before I got to the light, a lady appeared to me. She said, 'Come on Bernadette, it's time to go.' I was still crying and said, 'NO! I want my mum!' She looked at me and said, 'You're not ready to go yet.' I remember waking up and seeing my family still crying around my cot.
