There not being a quorum of Members present on the 4th of
November, some necessary matters of business only were considered,
and a confirmat-ory minute was passed on the 2nd of December. The
following report includes the matters so confirmed.
The Members present at the meeting of the Council on the 2nd of
December were :-Professor Sidgwick, Messrs. Walter H. Coffin,
Edmund Gurney, F. W. H. Myers, and J. Herbert Stack. The chair
was taken by Professor Sidgwick.
The Minutes of the last Meeting were read, and signed as correct.
Two new Members a.nd eight new Associates, whose names and

Information was received with regret of the death of Mr. Titus
Salt, J.P., a Member of the Society.
A small number of books were on the table, presents to the
Library, for which a vote of thanks was passed to the donors.
Cash accounts in the usual form were presented for the months of
October and November.
A circular was authorised, under the title of CI Free Distribution
Fund," inviting contributions towards a fund for placing the Proceedings
of the Society, and a certain number of copies of Phantasms of the
Living, in the free public libraries of the country and in other kindred
institutions. It was agreed that the circular should be sent round to
members with the December Jowrnal.
The arrangements that had been made for the Meeting to be held
on the evening of the 2nd of December were sanctioned. It was
further resolved that a General Meeting of the Society should be held
on the evening of the day of the Annual Business Meeting; a
convenient date to be fixed about the usual time at the end of
January. Full notice of this will be given later.
The next Meeting of the Council was fixed for the 13th of
January, 1888.
A MEETING OF THE SOCIETY.
A meeting of the Society, for the description and discussion of
some recent experiments in Hypnotism, was held in the Council
Chamber of the Westminster Town Hall, on the evening of the 2nd of
December. About 150 members and friends were present, cards of
admission having been sent to those who applied, in accordance with
the previous announcement..
Mr. Edmund Gurney described some further experiments of the
sa.me character as some described in his paper on "Peculiarities of
Certain Post-hypnotic States," in Part XI. of the Proceedings; the
point being that the subject, in a normal state, but unknown to his
normal self, executes distinctly mental work which has been suggested
to him in the hypnotic state, and the performance of which cannot
apparently be referredto "unconscious cerebration," since on re-hypno-
tisation he remembers the mental process involved.
An interesting conversational discussion followed, in which Mr. O.
Elton, Mr. Ion Perdicaris (of Tangier), Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Mr. H.
Venman, and others, took part. A variety of points connected with
the experiments were further elucidated by Mr. Gurney's replies.
Mr. Perdicaris referred to some apparently important experiences

of his own in years gone by, in connection with hypnotism, the par-
ticulars of which he was strongly urged to supply in a written fonn.
Some questions were asked as to the possibility of employing hypno-
tism as a means of education. To these Mr. Myers replied that the
power of attention could undoubtedly be strengthened by hypnotic
suggestion. Mr. Myers pointed out also how dreams sometimes
supply a link between a nonnal continuous memory and the markedly
discontinuous memory of hypnotic and other abnorrp.al states.
In reply to some questions as to the facilities for obtaining " sub-
jects," Mr. Gurney said that ~n France the hospitals supplied the
greater number of "subjects," but that in England the only effective
method seems to be by giving entertainments, at which persons were
invited to allow themselves to be' experimented upon. He thought it
exceedingly desirable that the experiments which he had described
should be repeated on persons of more education than the "subjects"
who were obtained in this way; and he should be very glad if such
would offer themselves. He had no idea what proportion of persons
would be found to be sensitive.
Mr. Gurney then proceeded to describe some other experiments on
the hypnotisation (anresthetisation and stiffening) of one' or another
of the" subject's" fingers which were concealed from his view, while
the hypnotiser held his hand without contact over the selected finger.
The novel point was that the finger as a rule remained unaffected if
the operator directed his will to the non-production instead of to the
production of the result. .
EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.
The results here printed of various sets of trials in Thought-
transference have been accumulating for some time. It is earnestly to
be wished that more of our friends would join in this most important
branch of the work.
(1). The following experiments were made by Mrs. Shield, of Bowers
Gifford Rectory, Essex, with two maid-servants' and a "rough farm
lad" as percipients. Mrs. Shield writes, June 18th, 1887 ;-
" There was no thought of deception, I am sure, and I carefully abstained
from suggesting any. No motive for deception existed, for right answers
ca.me more quickly than a pretender would have thought prudent-generally
as quickly as a question could be answered. If there was delay, there was
failure." When the object to be thought of was being selected, the
percipients went into a lobby, closing the door behind them. "We spoke

in whispers, or by dumb signs, needleBBly, that no one should even imagine
he or she 'heard,' and numbe1'8, &c., were always turned from the
percipient, however blindfolded. And they were desirous of excluding
every ray of light, 'that they might see the better,' and impressed the
necessity on occasional visito1'8 who tried. A few boys from the night
school came in with Sam-an assistant in the school was there once-and
most were successful in one or more attempts. But as these were made in
a somewhat scrambling way they are omitted. On the other hand, when we
were able to make a real series of attempts, I entered ewry one, successful
and unsuccessful. All three servants were good agents as well as percipients,
but we got on faster when I acted agent-the only part I am capable of. I
have written as if all four persons were always present. It was not so.
Twice a week Sam attended night school, and if he was to bring in a school-
fellow I waited for him after my usual time. One or other of the girls was
often absent for long or short periods, and I utilised opportunities to test
each singly-finding no difference. Some percipients could not explain how
they got their answe1'8. Sam always saw the thing. He is ,'ery intelligent,
and I regret that he has left the service and gone to' a distance. Other
domestic affairs broke up our meetings-to be resumed some day, perhaps.
" To me the experiments are very easy and very interesting. I cannot
but wonder so few people are disposed to give a little time and attention
to the subject.
"I have omitted to say that when by the Secretary's advice I ceased to
make all present acquainted with the object, the interest much declined,
though I did my best to maintain it, and the answers came more slowly. The
agent and the percipient were left to settle the particular question, and only
the result interested the others.

NOTJ£S :-
Mrs. Shield remarks that on Febrnary lOth, when she acted as agent alone,
the results were unusually poor.
On February 12th, when there were observers p,resent-Misses Evelyn and
Lucy Williams-the experiments were nearly all failures, a card being the only
success, with Sam.
After the 12 experimellts on December 31st, Mrs. Shield suffered for 20
hours with nervous headache.
On all dates after February 8th the 'agent and percipient were alone, except
where otherwise stated. .
(2). The next set of experiments is from Mr. Henry- G. Rawson,
of 23, Old Square, Lincoln's Inn (percipient), L., a young lady friend

(agent). He had never tried any experiments of the sort before. The
trials were made in a railway carriage, but notes were taken. Mr.
Rawson writes, January 26th, 1885:-
"I was seated opposite her [L.] in the railway carriage, the remaining
four of our party, in the other seats, being perfectly quiet, as they were
tired out by a long day. Our method was this: I cloBed my eyes; she then
cut the pack, the one tllUS sent to the bottom being the card to be gueued.
She then said' Yes' as a signal. It seemed to me that certain cards
presented themselves to 'me, apparently at the back of the eyes. In each
case I had three' gueues. In the cases which came right the correct card
appeared to me within five seconds of her saying •Yes.' ..

Mr. Rawson adds that in trials in guessing colour, of cards, L. was right
8 times out of 11 in a first series, and 13 out of ~o in a second.
Mr. Rawson writes, May 18th, 1885 :-
"I have kept the records of all my experiments that proved at all
succeBsful ; and am able from memory to state pretty accurately the number
of times I tried in vain.* With regard to the latter, I should explain that if
in the first 4: or 5 tries I neither see a card at a.ll (which often happens)or see
9newhich is neither right in number nor suit, I give it up as hopeleu for that
day. Therefore, if you count the abortive trials on an average as 5 entire
failures you will be probably well over the mark; indeed, I should say that
the attempt has uaua.lly been abandoned after 3 tries with a new operator."
A month later he writes:-
.. I am positive I have overstated the number of failures, as I desired
not to exaggerate the succeu of the experiments. I have been the percipient
in all the recorded cases. • • • In each case I have sat facing the agent,
with my eyes shut, at a distance varying from 3 to 6 feet; in the first
instance it was in a railway carriage."
The following are his results :-
It is of course most desirable-etI8ential, indeed, for scientific purposes-that aU
records lIhould be kept.

Later, Mr. Rawson again tried experiments in guessing cards
with Miss L. and Miss K. H., but t.he results then were not so striking.
With the former he mooe 26 experiments, guessing the card once
right on the second trial, and the suit right twice on the first trial, and
the number of pips right once on the first trial. With Miss K. H. he
made 20 trials, guessing the card quite right once on the second trial,
the number of pips twice on the second trial, and twice on a fourth.

He also made four experiments in drawing objects looked at by
Miss L. A crochet needle was the only thing approaching success,
which was fairly reproduced, with a. barb [-+].
(3). The next account is from Major Taylor, Royal Military
College, Sandhurst. "J'IIIM 15th, 1887.
" The experiments were in every respect bona fide, and so arranged
that no accidental information could reach the percipient. The per-
cipient sat either in an arm-chair or at a small table; her ey'3S were
lightly bandaged with a silk handkerchief, and care was taken that
there were no reflecting surfaces available for her. The agents sat
behind the percipient, one of whom held up a card on which was drawn
what was to be thought of, and when ready said Now, everyone ("lse
remaining silent. When the guess had been made, nothing was said
as to its correctness or otherwise, but another picture held up, and the
word Now repeated." Trials were first made with letters of the
alphabet, with Miss Manders as percipient and Major Taylor and Dr.
Manders as agents. The percipient, who held Major Taylor's hand,
knew that letters of the alpha.bet would form the subject of experiment.
In thefirst 10 trialswith different letters two were rightly guessed; in
the second trial with 10 letters one was correctly named. Two series
of 11 trials, with figures from 0 to 9, were next tried. In the first
series Miss Manders gave one figure correctly, and in the second series
three were rightly named.
TriR.ls were then made with simple coloured figures prepared by
Major Taylor; such as Star, Diamond, Crescent, Arrowhead, Sham-
rock-leaf, Oxford Frame, Maltese Cross, &c. Miss Manders was in-
formed that they were geometrical figures which could be easily
described:
Ten experiments were made in May, 1884:, with Miss A. Manders
as percipient, and Major Taylor, Dr. and Mrs. Manders, and Mrs. Good,
agents. Two were given quite correctly in colour and shape, and
two right in colour but wrong in shape.
Fifteen experiments were made on June 1st, with the same
percipient, but with Major Taylor and Dr. Manders only as agents.
Two 8hapes were correctly named, with the wrong colours, and two
colour8 with the wrong shapes. Twice during these experiments some
domestic article was looked at without warning, and something
domestic was named, viz., jug ("spoon"); key(" cup ").
Later in June, 18 similar trials were made with fresh drawings, and
the same agents and percipient. One was correctly described both in
shape and colour; three were right in colour, but the shapes wrong.
On this occasion a jug unexpectedly used was described as a "cup."

On November 9th, 1884,6 trials were made with Miss G. Manders
as percipient; agents: Major Taylor, Dr. and Mrs. Manders, and
Mrs. Good. One figure was correctly described-a skull and cross
bones.
In reference to these experiments, Miss G. Manders writes that as
far as she can remember she did not see any of the pictures until after
the experiments were over.
(4). The following experiments in guessing suits were made by
some friends of Miss Porter, in December, 1886, and January and
February, 1887. Miss Porter says:-
"Three girls were lodging together in Kensington-:-art students. They
each guessed a few cards every evening, two acting as agents ; sometimes,
'however, one was absent, and then the remaining two made the experiments.
I cannot find in these cases that the success, was less with one than with
two."
Mr. FentonAylmer, brother of one of the ladies, also tried guessing
on some occasions.

The most probable number of successes for chance to produce was
of course 230.
In addition to these trials, Miss Porter adds that Mr. Fenton
Aylmer, as agent, made about 200 trials both with his sister and
with Miss Costerton, with even greater success; but the records
of these are lost; and " Miss Aylmer tells me that she has succeeded
in drawing simple designs when agented by her brother." Miss Porter
hopes to induce the young ladies to continue the experiments.
(5). Mr. J. G. Keulemans, of 28, St. Mary's-road, Harlesden Park,
N.W., supplies the following' account of experiments:-
"On several previous occasions I had tried to establish a 'l'applYri between
myself and four of my children, experiment.ing alternately with each for a
short time and at irregular intervals; but the results were invariably failures
throughout. I now attribute the failures to my acting upon the principle
that, being their father, I ought also to be their agent, and they my
subjects or percipients. By mere accident I discovered that by reversing the
parts a mpplYri was established between my eldest son (aged 18) and
myself. This was on August 10th last. We happened to be the only
occupants of the house. The place was remarkably quiet, and the causes that
might lead to interruption in these trials totally absent. I had just finished
reading the last paragraph of your correspondent, 'H. G. R.'s' comDlunica-

tion in the July number of the Journal, where the writer quotes it 88 his
experience that he succeeded 88 a percipient but failed 88 operator. This
induced me to also reverse the parts previously adopted in the case with my
children.
Asking my son, in his capacity of agent, to look at II. number he could find
in a newspaper or book within his l'each, and fix his gaze upon a single
figure, it at once struck me that he had cast his eye upon a bold 8. Awaiting
his decision, I [wrote down 8 on the cover of the Journal, which was out
of his sight. Seeing I was ready, he said, pointing to a figure before him,
, Eight.' I then showed him the figure 8 as put down by myself.
Six Imore trials followed-he looking at a single figure, and I trying to
read his thought -and on four occasions I gueBBed rightly. But of these
latter six trials no record was kept, because I did not expect such a decided
success, and hence had made no preparations to write, down the results.
Seeing, however, that a striking improvement was now apparent, I took a
book, placed a sheet of papel' on it, and turning my chair with my back
towards the agent, at once prepared to note down the. results that would
follow. My altent could not, from his position, notice what I would write on
my paper. He stood before my writing-desk, facing the west. I faced the
south-east, the distance between us was three feet.
Trial No.1. -The agent wrote 7 GueBB 1.
Trial No. 2.-The agent wrote 9 Guess 7.
Trial No. 3.-'Ihe agent wrote 3 Guess 3.
Trial No. 4--The agent W1'Qte 9 .'.. Guess 8.
(Agent had previously thought of trying 8.)
Trial No. 5.-The agent wrote 3 Guess 3.
Trial No. 6.-The agent wrote 7 Guess 9.
Trial No. 7.-The agent wrote 2 GueBB 2.
Trial No. 8.-The agent wrote 4 GueBB 4.
(The last guess, although correct, may have been due to anticipation on
my part, as the figure 4 had not as yet occurred in the experiments. My
agent, however, stated that he nevor thought of the figures already used, and
did not select ,the 4 by way of varying the figures.)
Trial No. 9.-The ag.mt wrote 8
Trial No. 10.-The agent wrote 5
Trial No. 11.-The agent wrote 5
Guess 8.
Guess 5.
Guess .5.
Now, out of these ele'l1et. trials, ,even gueBBes were correct, and one,
No.4, was partly so. These coincidences could not, therefore, be attributed
to mere chance only. Especially in the last trial, viz., No. 11, where a
pre"ious figure is repeated, the probability of chance, or that of anticipation,
is well-nigh excluded. I must also state that in all the cases, except No. 4,
where the guess was correct, the figure seemed to flash instantaneously into
my mind and caused me to think that, after all, I was the' agent and my
son the percipient. As to the experiment No.4, where the agent first
intended to write 8 but afterwards wrote a 9, no such instantaneous inlPres-
sion W88 conveyed to me; on the contrary, it took a long time-perhaps a
minute-before I saw the 8 in my mind's eye. I have, or rather what 1

will call • my mind's eye' has, on more than one occasion seen either the
object or the figure thought of by the agent as a whitish, semi-objective
representation coming out clearly against a dark background. If I cast my
eyes in the direction of a wall (instinctively I will always look towards the
darker part of the room when expecting a telepathic impression) then the
object thought of by the agent will appear as before:described, and leave the
impression that it is near that wall-at least, much nearer to"the wall than to
my eyes. If the room be large, the vision will see~ to be farther away from
myself, but it will become visible always near the background, no matter what
its distance. In experiment No.4, the 8 appeared against a set of books,
placed on a shelf in a shaded corner, at a distance of three yards from my
eyes. The figure seemed to be coming forward about two feet away from the
books.
You will, I hope, not object to a description of these details. I quote
them because my experience agrees to some extent with that of your
correspondent, 'H. G. R.,' who sees the object slightly above his eyes. I
see mine straight before me, or slightly ab01le my eyes in case I am sitting in
an easy chair, my head resting against the back, or in a recumbent position.*
From this it is evident that the 'visible impression' is built up in the brain.
After the first series of eleven trials we took a short rest, chiefly because
I thought the guessing at single figures was too simple, and perhaps too
inconclusive, and that besides, in some cases a figure may be guessed by
expectation. Whilst I was meditating upon some more conclusive experi-
ment, my agent prop:lsed to throw numbers by dice. He had a set of
exceedingly small proportions (taken out of a fancy solitaire, I believe) and
threw them out into an empty cigar box. The trial consisted in my reading
or guessing the totaZ of the three respective figures.

eye upon it ...
Trial 2.-Agent throws 4, 6, 3, or total of 13 ...
Trial 3.-Agent throws 2, 2, I, or total of 5 ...
Trial 4.-Agent throws three 6's.
Before he had time to write out the total I saw the dice (in my mind's
eyo) aud observed: • There is a lot this time.' 'Guess,' said agent. I
guessed two 6's and a 5. Very nearly correct !
In trial 5 agent throws 5, 3, 4. Total 12.
I felt unable to gueBS. The two 6's and the 5 were still occupy-
ing my mind. After a pause, I saw a 5, but could not perceive the
remaining 3 and 4.
Trial 6.-1 now asked my agent to concentrate his gaze upon the separate
figures of the dice and not to count the total. I saw a 4 (on the right), a 5
(on the left), and the remaining 3 a little lower down. Not only did I
perceive the different numbers, but also the position of each of the dice. I
described my impression to my agent, i.e., that the dice were not far apart
and formed a crescent. Here the agent became quite excited, calling out

loudly, 'It is quite right I ' This caused me to leave my chair and see for
myself. I found the dice just as I had seen them telepathically. But here,
I must remark, we had both overlooked a somewhat important point.
In experiment I) the agent threw 5, 3, 4. and it struck me as being strange
that in the next trial we should again obtain the very Bame figures.
Were they the same throw as experiment 5, or a fresh one 1 Unfortu-
nately neither agent nor percipient could tell for certain. Yet my agent
said the dice were differently arranged in trial 5. He W&8 sure that the
figure 4 was at the otber end of the box, and not on Uie right of figure 3 &8
on last occasion. In the hurry to verify the results by actual inllpection, I
had also forgotten to note down my impression before leaving my chair.
Trial 7.-Taking extl"& precautions, I noted down 6, 1, 6, this being my
impression as soon &8 I heard that the dice had ceased rolling, and before
my agent informed me he was rcady to hear my report. On comparison my
impression W&8 found to be again correct.
Trial8.-W&8 a complete failure. My agent had thrown 2,4,5. He was
still jubilant over the last successes. and made the mistake of writing down
the total 11 instead of fixing his eye upon the separate figures. I could
see nothing.
Trial 9.-Agent throws 4, 4, 1 •.. Guess 4, 3, 2.
Trial10.-Agent throws 6, 3, 4 ... Guess 1, 3, 4.
Trial 11.--:-Agent throws 1, 1, 2 ... Guess 2, 1, 1.
I latO the 2 nearest to his left hand, the box being placed at his left.
Hence I mentioned the 2 first.
Trial 12.-0ne of the dice fell in the comer. Agent lays it flat between
the other dice-with the figure 6 upwards. I could only see that 6.
Trial 13.-Agent throws 5, 5, 3. I gueSsed a 5 and tried hard to see the
other figures, but did not succeed. The return of the other members of
the family put a sudden stop to further experiments.
My agent has for some time been staying with a relative. He will be
home again in a few days, when further experiments will be made and the
results forwarded to you."
(6). The next set in guessing suits, conducted early in this year,
is from Miss Hopkiuson, of 37, Woburn Place, W.O.
The trials were with young lady friends. A full pack of cards W&8 used.
"We adhere rigidly to the rules &8 to position, cutting, &c.-indeed, I
should not consider it an experiment if we did not do so. • • • My
three young lady friends had no idea I W&8 trying an experiment with them.
Owing to a slight accident I have been confined to my room for many weeks,
and they imagined they were playing a sort of •willing game ' with cards to
amuse me. Had I mentioned my object, both the parents of my young
friends and they themselves would have felt annoyed, and I should not again
have had their company."

this year by the Hon. Miss Tracy, of 44, Grosvenor Gardens, S.W.
The percipients were in most cases her younger brothers and sisters.
The trials were carefully conducted according to instructions; and the
fact that some of the percipients were young children in no way
detracts from the value of the results.

CORRESPONDENCE.
To the Editor of the JOURNA.L OF THE SocmrY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
Sm,-In answer to Mr. J. G. Keulemans' letter, printed in the
November number of the Journal, we would say (1) that Mr. Keulemans
assumes too much in talking of our .. fancies as sceptics," for neither of'us
were or are sceptics in the sense of not being open to conviction ; (2) that
neither of us now depends" upon his memory alone," since our memories
are corroborative of each other, though in several vital points not so of
Mr. Keulelllans; (3) that we were shown many drawings done, by Mr.
Keulemans from" spirits .. (one we both remember of a spirit with claws like
those of an eagle instead of hands), and especially several of spirit lamps, or
lights and phases of materialisation (some of which drawings he supplied to
Light, we believe), all of which Mr. Keulemans told us he had "drawnfronl
life "-{you will have noticed that in his letter Mr. Keulemans refers to a
Bingle drawing, and omits to notice our mention of many)-and finally, that
we distinctly remember Mr. Keulemans telling us the various incidents
described by us in the October number of the Journal as havi-ng happened w
himself an!l within his OtOIl experience. We were most particular to ask at
the time if each incident, as narrated to us, had happened to Mr. Keulemans
himself. It is possible that Mr. Keulemans being at that time, by his own
admission, duped, was anxious to wnvert others, and so exaggerated
(perhaps unconsciously) his" facts."
Neither of us can forge~nd this seems to ns a strong point in Mr. Keule-
mans' explanations-the veryimpressive wayinwhichhe warned us against ever
believing anything until we had absolutely satisfied ourselves, by ocular
demonstration or otherwise, of its truth ; he a8sured 'UB that he himself tlo6116T
did 80.
As Mr. Fry has already said, Mr. Keulemans distinctly told us of the
little girl·spirit-whether she sat on his knee or stood by his side would not
seem to signify; that he used to pass his finger through her eye into her
skull, .. up to the hilt," so to say; this point you will notice he has ignored.
We will now only asa: Mr. Keulemans one question, since he admits that the
little girl·spirit and her pleasing ways were within his own experience. Does
he still believe that story, as he undoubtedly told it to us ; and does he now
think that he used to put his finger into the skull of the medium's daughter 1
If the first, then our position is proved good; if the second, then we shall be
entitled to our own opinion of the value of Mr. Keulemans' evidence.-
Yours obediently.

Sm,-I have been much impressed by Mr. Downing's analysis of expecta-
tion into pure and impure-(see his letter in the October number of the
JoumaZ)-and may at once admit that I am quite satisfied with his conclu-
sion, and with his reconciliation of our apparently conflicting views. Nay,

more j his analysis enables me to understand a phenomenon which was begin-
ning to puzzle me extremely in my experiments, viz., the increasing
difficulty which I find in preventing myself from trying to "think out" the
card, instead of waiting for the impre88ion to strike me. I send you the
result of several experiments made during the Long Vacation,.none of them
nearly so sUcceBBful as those previously recorded. For the present purpose
it will be sufficient to remark, in curious corroboration of my July letter,
that the beat result achieved (three right out of nine) was with a lady with
whom I had had but little success comparatively the previous year, and that
it was only on the first trial with her on this occasion that there were any
correct gU888es, two lubaequent attempts turning out blank, On the other
hand, to my great disappointment, two very succeaaful agents of 1886 pro-
duced no IllSance nearly as satisfactory, though we made three trials. I also
send you some results of a " thought-drawing experiment" (if I may coin a
word) with MiBB K. H., the former of the two ladies mentioned [above].
I have endeavoured to get from the three agents with whom I have been
most succeaaful, hitherto, some'opinion upon Mr. Downing's theory that
SUCC888 depends on the" pure " expectation of it in th~ agent's mind-in
other words, on the non-conception of the negative. Also I asked whether
there had been any conscious exertion of the will in those cases where success
resulted. The !lnswers must be qualified by co~deration of the difficulty
which they have all found in recalling their state of mind on successful, as
distiniuished from unaucce88ful, occasions.
My sister, with whom, as I have before told you, I gueBBed sevon out of
twelve on the first occasion, tella me I was always right, or more nearly right,
when she" felt we would succeed." She believes ahe "never, on succeaaful
occasions, expected any other result." (This, I conceive, is the .. non-concep-
tion of the negative.") But ahe remembers on some occasions having felt
.. disappointed" when ahe was .. sure" that I would see it and I did not. She
further believes that succe88 attended more often an effort of her will. This,
however, I am much inclined to doubt, not only in her case, but in all, for
the following reasons :-(1) The vision of the card in such a large majority
of instances comes instantaneously, and before any concentration of will
could well be produced; (2) cards are so often guessed which the agent did
not intend, much leaS .. will " me to see; (3) as the result of several experi-
l11ents, I find it is no good waiting for the card to appear. I have tried as
many as a dozen •• shots" at the same card, extending over a period of five
minutes, without getting anywhere near it. This, I may remark, tell.
considerably against the theory of mere coincidence.
MiBB B. L., the other very succ888fu1 agent of 1886, thinks Mr.
Downing's theory agrees with her recollection, and that she .. did make up
her mind to succeed." She does not, however, explain our subsequent
comparative failures, both last year and this. MiBB K. H. also confirms Mr.
Downing.
Before reverting to my own experiences as percipient, I may expre88 an
opinion, founded partly on my correspondent's replies, that after our
successful first experiments there were present to their minds not only
conjectures as to SUCC888, i.e., conception of the negative, but also reflections
Digitized byGo~gIe
194 JO'Urnal of Society for Psyckical.ReseaTck. [Dec., 1887.
upon the remarks of third persoll6; all tending to make concentration of
thought, or will, impossible.
It will be seen that I have frequently used above the term" guess" ;
and, with a view to "B. W.'s "letter in the November number, I ought to
say a few words on this point. The word is distinctly a mimomer; it is
my great object to avoid guessing, if possible; and for this reason I always
ask the agent to avoid making any infleation of the voice in auswering
.. No" to my first incorrect gueBS, for otherwise 1 knew sometimes from the
tone that I was nearly right, and then a conscious" shot" was very difficult
to avoid. But, except the word" see," I do not know what term to nse ;
and I ml1Bt confess that since my earlier experimentsI have had leBS and less
power of visualisation, and seem to reach the card by a more purely mental
eff'ort. .
But, seeing that my results have certainly fallen off', it may be that
the failure to "see," and the attempt to supply its place by mental eft"ort,
are at the root of my non-success' As to a power of visualisation apart
from thought-transference, I may mention, in reply to "B. W.," that
I POBSeBB, in common with many people, the faculty of seeing a P888Bg8 in a
book which has roused my attention, and thus finding it with comparatively
little difficulty; but am not aware that I otherwise P088ess any such
power.
Before concluding, I may be allowed to make" remark suggested by my
own experience and by Mr. Creery's letter. If loBS of capacity commonly
at~nds continued experiments of this sort, how great must be the tempta-
tion, especially where credit or pocket is concerned, to call in the aid of art
to produce eff'ects which were undeniably genuine in the first instance. Your
readers will recall Browning's Sludge, the Medium.-Yol1rs truly,
