INTRODUCTION
A fter many years of Intensive research
in to the m ysterious ana hiduen a r ts of in­
vocation, I have fin a lly compiIea tn i sbook,
wnich* I fe e l, w ill be my (greatest oook on
an a rt tn a t has long been lo s t and wnich,
at one tim e, served to give the m agician
and o ccu lt devotee the o ffic e of guardian
of the in v is ib le fo rces.
I t has long been my contention th a t
the story of A lla d in 's Lamp has o ften been
in te rp re te d tn u sly : th a ttn e AlI a d in ' s Lamp
was a mere instrum ent or an incid en t in tne
in v o c a to r's ritu a l and accessory; an in s tru ­
ment by wnich the compack of invocation can
be se le c te d . To many of my "Cnelas" (s tu ­
dents) n av el to ld th a t the h is to ric a l story
of A lladin was fa ls e ly in te rp re te d oy our
h is to ria n s and th a t the tru e s ig n ific a n c e
of the A lla d in 's Lamp was b a sic a lly m ysti­
cal and th a t the invocator nad merely to
rub the soul of tne Lamp to i nvoke tne g e n ii.

The devoted student of occultism and
the mere c u rio sity -se e k e r may both d iff e r
in the adherence to the r i t u a l s th a t l w ill
se t fo rth ju s t as I have in te rp re te d tnem
from the a n c ie n ts. Those of you who seek
5
only to gain success, may gain i t — but tne
g reat re s u lt w ill be, for it is su rely w rit­
ten "That he who uses the luorks of the ma­
gician f a ls e ly , shall him self be fa ls e ly
accused. "
In tne follow ing pages you w ill find
many ways th a t I nave invoKea very many
d iffe re n t S p ir its , Demons, Angels and Gob­
lin s . I implore you; those of you wno w ill
attem pt the invocation of e ith e r gooo or
bad Demons, S p ir its , Angels or Goblins to
do so w ith the g re a te st amount of s e lf - r e ­
spect and confidence. For, I nave found
in many years of experience th a t those who
supply the a ctio n s of God be not serio u sly
considering the s tr a in . Of the many invo­
c atio n s included, you w ill fin d them as an
a n aly sis of the g re a t Solar In te llig e n c e s,
and in te rp re ta tio n leading to an awareness
and complete ap p reciatio n .
Let me, at th is p o in t, pause and go
into what I think the uses of so many of
our frien d s are desirous—of th is hidden
knowledge wnicn I feel nas been revealed
for the f i r s t tim e. In ancient tim es, th e re
is record tn a t c e rta in myst ics invoked many
a s p ir it to do h is bidding. Some h is to r i­
cal records show tn a t C leopatra compelled
an enemy to lose h is power to harm ner and
forced him to become a slave and lover, by
ner magical use of scented o iIs and so rc ery .
At th is time a g re a t c u lt in Egypt was a
sacred and m ystic legion in which Is is and
Asoris were D e itie s. Tne p ra c titio n e rs and
p rie s t in th is c u lt, by a high invocation.
6
were sa id , able to leave the oody ana as-
cena to the 7th Heaven to make compacks
w ith Is is , the Immortal of Im m ortals. As
the sto ry i s to Id, th is son o f a n ig n p r ie s t
was sent to use h is magical a r t in fo rcin g
the nelp and consent of C leopatra to tne
a id o f h is s e c re t o ra e r. By ner g re a t sor­
cery, she co njurea the fo rce s of a g reat
demon wnicn destroyed n is power and caused
him to become ner slav e. When th e g reat
p r ie s ts of the order learned of th is , they
immediately induced high ana mighty invo­
c a tio n s and commanded demons ano g o b lin s,
anu secondary s p i r i t s of e v il and lu s t, to
wreck ner whole kingdom wnich is snown to
us by n is to ric a l account of the f a l l of
C leo p atra by her own hands.
Snakespeare, in th e p I ay "The Tem pest,"

tne work of the invocator and c o n ju rer was
understood, ana i t s a r t p ra c tic e d wi th g reat

was invoked by the Duke of Milan to cause
tne d e stru c tio n ot h is enemey who had oa-
nisned him to a d e se rt isla n d .
From the ear Iie s t n is to ric a l tim es, we
nave found tra c e s of tne many uses of invo­

I, do nerety say, w itnout fear of any

th a t the an cien ts have invoked many of the

SECRET PROCEDURE IN ORDER TO MAKE AN
INVOCATION.
First, from the lis t contained nerein, choose
1 sp irit, oenon, goolin or angel, or a sp irit ot J
friena or close relative, set a Jay tor invocatirvg
tnem ano prepare in tne to Ilowing manner: a uay

Now, ^ nours uetore tne time set tor tne inv>-

Tnisistouno numbered beside tne name of tne sp irit
Iisteu on the back of tne cook. He then moves ail
furni tore to tne sioes of tne room, leaving a clear­
ance in tne center, removing all rugs and clotns
from tne floor so mat nothing but the bare floor
can oe seen. Trven, ma^iny a huge circle, about *
to 4 feet in diameter with cnal k, preferably Dragon's

Ijgnts from the candles ana lets the incense Durn
and removes to tne batnroom. Here he bathes, after
having placed an amount of sanctuary oil in the
tuo. After having bathed himself and anoited him­
self pleasingly with oils, he rubs his forehead
with powder which will later be given. Then ne
dresses himself placing the Tsitsus close to his
oody, and puts on nis regular clothes ana places
the invocator’s gown over tnem. The tal is, he puts
on top Of tnem and binds his heaa and forehead with
the Phylectary.
He then takes the stick and walks to tne room
wnere he has orawn the circle ana enters into the
circle. Once ne enters into tne circle with his
Dooks, wands, incense and all things ne neeos, fid
draws the outer circle about 3 incnes away from tne
circle he iias already orawn and in it he then lights
tne candles, sprays the perfume and re-1ignts the
incense and opens to the firs t invocation as con-
tained in tne book. Tne operator must remember not
to leave tm s circle during tne wnole invocation
until tne closing wurds have ueen said, for as long
as ne remains in tne circle, no natter how fierce

walis of tne circle, for they are bound and pro­

the invocation, tne desires of tn« invocator must
oe written on parchment ano reau to tne deiron,

nao to subdue the demon or goblin by constantly
banging the stick on tne floor in oroer to subdue
them. Then when they are subdued, tne invocator
should nave tne sp irit return on tne following day
or some day wnen tney are ready to go out to oo tne
biouings, and on a day at a certain place witn a
certain oook, tne invocator reads tne desires to
tne demon, sp irit or goblin from virgin parcnment,
ana by invocating the nigii and mighty name of God:
Tetrayramaton, Adenoi,etc. Connence tnen to carry
out this written, sealed ano signed oroer. TnuS,
tney cannot refuse tne request of tne invocator

CHAPTER I I
THE HAOICAL ART OF NECROMANCT
Necromancy, or divination by means or trie
spirits of the dead, from the Greek words, nekros,
dead; and manteia, devinatiun. It is through its
Ital ian from nifrvmjncia. tnat it came to tie known
as tne "Black Art.” With the Greeks it originall>
signified the descent into Hades in order to con­
sult tne dead ratner than stnnonsing tne dead into
tne mortal sphere again. Tiie art is of almost uni­
versal usage. Considerable difference ot opinion
exists among modern adepts as to tne exact methods
to be properly pursued in the necromantic art, and
it must be borne in mind that necromancy, wnicn in
tne Middle Ages was called sorcery, shades into
modern spiritualistic practice. There is no doubt
however, mat necromancy is the touch-stone of oc­
cultist!, for if, after careful preparation tne adept
can carry tnrougn to a successful issue, tne raising
of the soul from tne other world, he has proved the
value of nis art. 1t would be fruitless in tnis
place to enter into a psychological discussion as
to wnetner this feat is possible of acconplisnment
or not, and we wiIl confine ourselves to the mate­
rial which has been placed at our disposal by the
sages of the past, wno have left full details as
to how the process should be approached.
In the case of a compact existing between the
conjuror and the devil, no ceremoney is necessary,
as the fami I iar is ever at hand to do the behests
of his masters. This, however, is never the case
with tne true sorcerer, w
hopreserves his independ­
ence and trusts to nis profound knowledge of tne
12
THE A N C IE N T 'S BOOK OF MAGIC
art and nis powers ot corrmand. His object, there­
fore, is to "constrain" some sp irit to appear before
nim, and to guard himself from the danger of pro­
voking sucn beings. Tne magician, it must be under­
stood, always has an assistant, and every article
named is prepared according to rules well known in
the black art. In tne first place they are to fix
upon a proper spo. for sucn a purpose; wnicn must
be either in a subterranean vault, nuny round with
black, and lighted by a magical torch; or else in
the centre of sone thick wood or desert, or upon
some extensive unfrequented plain, wnere Several
roads meet, or amidst the ruins of ancient castles,
abbeys, monasteries, etc., or amongst tne rocks on
the sea snore, in some private detacned cnurcnyard,
or an> other solemn, melancholy place between tne
hours ot tweIve and one in the nignt, either wnen
the moon shines very brignt, or else when tne ele­
ments are disturbed witn storms of tnunder, light­
ning, wind, and rain: tor, in tnese places, time,
and seasons, it is contended tnat sp irits can witn
less difficulty manifest tnemselves to mortal eyes,
and continue visible with the least pain, in the
elanental external world.
When the proper time and place is fixed upon,
a magic circle is to be formed, witnin whicn, the
master and nis associate are carefully to retire.
The dimensions of tne circle are as follows: A
f. ieceof ground is usual ly cnosen, nine feet square,
at tne full extent of wnicn paral lei Iines are drawn
one witnin the other, naving sundry crosses and
triangles described between tnem, close to whicn
is tornwd tne firs t or outer circle, then about
13
THE A N C IE N T 'S BOOK OF HAOIC
half-a-foot within the same, a second circle is de-
scr ipedand witnin that another square correspondent
to tne fir s t, the centreot wnicnistne seat or spot
where tne master and associate are to be placeo.
,rThe vacancies formed by tne various lines and an­
gles of the figure are rilledupw itn the holy n&uzs
of God, having crosses and triangles described
between them. The reason assigned by magic ians and
otners tor tne institution and use of circles, is,
that so mucn ground being uiessed and consecrated
by such holy words and ceremonies as they make use
of in forming it, natha secret force to expel I all
evil sp irits from the bounds tnereof, arid, being
sprinkled with pure sanctified water tne ground is
purified from all uncleaness; besides, tne hoi/
names of God being written over every uart of it,
u s force becomes so powerful tnat no evil sp irit
hath abilit> to break tnreugn it or to yet at the
magician or his companion, by reason of tne anti-
patny in nature they bear to these sacred names.
And tne reason given for tne triangles, is, tnat
tne sp irit be not easily brought to speak tne trutn,
tney may by tne exorcist conjured to enter tne same,
where, b> virtue of trie names or tne essence and
divinity of God, tne> can speak nothing but wnat is
true ana right.- Tne circle, therefore, according
to tnis account of it, is tne principal fort and
shield of tne magician, from /.men tie is not, at
the peril of nis life, to decari till ne nas cons­
ulete I»-dismissed tne sp irit.__par uyyldr \j__<_!_!*
be of a f icr yor internal nature. Tradition records
many instances of those woo pensned by m is means;
particularly the legencot "Cniancungi, " the famous
Egyptian for tune-tel ler, woo was so famous in Eng­

land in tne 17m century. He undertook tor a
wager, to raide uK tne sp irit "Bokirn," and naving
described trie circle, n« seated nis sister Napula
by nim as ms associate. After frequently repeat­
ing tne forms of exorcism, and calling upon tne
sp irit to appear, and nothing as yet answering his
demand, they grew impatient of tne business, and
quitted the circle, but it cost tnem their lives;
for they were instantaneously seized and crushed
to deatn by that infernal spir it, wno happened not
to be Sufficiently constrained till that monvnt,
to manifest himself to human eyes."
Tnere is a prescribed form of consecrating
the magic circle, which we nave illustrated later
on. Tne proper a ttire or "pontificalibus" of a
magician, is an Epnod made of fine wnile linen,
over that a priestly robe of black Bonfcazine,
reaching to the ground, with the two seals of the
earth drawn correctly upon virgin parchment, and
affixed to a broad consecrated girdle, with the
names, Ya, Ya,----Aie, Aaie,----El ibra,----Elchim,—
Sadai,----Pah Adonai,----two robore,----Cinctus sum.
Upon nis shoes must be wr i tten Tetragramaton, with
crosses round about; upon nis head a high-crowned
cap of silk, and in his hand a Holy Bible, printed
or written in pure Hebrew. Thus attired, and
standing within the charmed circle, the magician
repeats the awful formof exorcism; and presently,
tne infernal sp irits make strange and frightful
noises, bowlings, tremblings, flashes, and most
dreadful shrieks and yells, as tne forerunner be­
comes visible. Tneir fir s t appearance is general ly

in the formoM ierte and terrible Iions or tiyers,
vomiting form i ire, and roaring hideously about
tne circle; all wnicn the time tne exorcist 'nest
not sorter an* tremjurot dismay; for, in mat case,
tney will gain tne ascendency and tne consequences
nay touch nis lire. O
n tr*e contrary, ne must sum
m
on
up a snare of resolution, and continue repeating
all the forms of constriction and conf inemant until
they are drawn nearer to the influence ot trie tri­
angle, wnen their forms will unanye to appearances
less ferocious and frigntful, and oecome more sub­
missive and tractable. W
hen the forms of conjura­
tion have in this manner been sufficiently repeat­
ed, trie spirits forsake their bestial shapes, and
enter tne human form appearing Iike naked nen ot
gentle countenance and behaviour, yet is tne magi­
cian to be warily on nis guard that they deceive
nim not by such mild gestures, for they are exceed­
ingly fraudulent and deceitful in their dealings
with those who Constrain them to appear witnout
compact, naving notniny in view but to suborn nis
mind, or accomplish his destructon. With great
care also must the spirit be discharged after ti*j
ceremony is finished, and ne nas answered ail the
demands made upon nim. Tne ntfigician must wait pa­
tiently till tne spirit passed tnrougn all tne
terricie forms wnicn announce nis coming, and only
when the last shriek nas died away, and every trace
of fire and brimstone has disappeared, ne leave
the circle and depart hom
e in safety,

If the ghost ot a deceased person is to oe
raised, the grave must be resorted to at midnight,
and a different form of conjuration is necessary.

Still another, is tne internal sacrament tor "any

awty with itself;" and in this case the conjurat ions
are performed over the body, which will at last
arise, and standing uprlynt, answer witn a lamt

of a funeral lamp or taper. Tnis lignt snould be
placed behind us, tne portrait snould be uncovered
and we should remain before it for an now, in si­
lence; finally v
*
*
? snould firmgate tne apartment
witn a little good incense, and go out backwards.
On Uw nuriiiriy of Uie day fixed for tne evocation,
we snould adorn owselves as if for a festival, not
salute anyone first, make but a single repast of
bread, wine, and roots, or fruits; tne clotn should
ue white, two covers snould be laid, and one por­
tion of the bread broken should be set aside; a
little wine should aiso be placed in tne'glass of
the person we design to invoke. Tne meal must be
eaten alone in tne cnamber of evocations, and in
presence of tne veiled portrait; it must be all
cleared away at tne end, except tne glass belonging
to tne dead person, andnis portion of bread, which
must be placed before the portrait. In tne evening,
at tne nour tor tne regular v isit, we must repair
in silence to tne cnamber, light a clear fire of
Oak Park, and cast incense seven times tnereon,
pronouncing tne name of tne person wnom we desire
to benold. Tne lamp must tnen be extinguisned and
tne fire permitted to die out. Cn this day tne
portrait must not be unveiled. When tne flame is
extinct, put more incense on tne asnes, and invoke
God according to tne formsof tne religion to wmcn

to manifest to us. Renew tnis prayer mentally,
covering the face witn both nands; then call him

result, the same experiment must be renewed in the

more re a listic and striking it will be.

oratory. This oratory rmstbe invariably darkened;
but we operate in tne daytime, we may leave a nar­
row aperture on tne side wnere the sun will shine
at tne noor of the evocation and place a triangular
prism before tne opening, and a crystal glove,
filled with water, before tne prism. It tne opera­
tion be arranged for the night tne magic lamp must
bo so placed that its single ray Shall upon the
altar smoke. Tne purpose of tne preparations is
to furnish tne magic agent witn elements of cur-

poreal appearance, and to ease as mucn as possiale
the tension of imagination, wn»cn could not be ex­
alted without danger into tne absolute illusion of
orearn. For the rest, it will be easily understood
that a beam of sunl ignt, or trie ray ot a la^p, col­
oured variously, and falling upon curling and ir­
regular smoke, can in no way create a perfect image.
Tne cnafing-disn containing the sacred fire snould
be in tne center of the oratory, and tne altar or
perfumes close by. Tne operator must turn towards
the east to pray, and tne west to invoke; he must
be either alone or assisted bj ore or two persons
perserviny tne strictest silence; lie must wear tr»e
magical vestments, which we have oescribed. H
e
should batrie before the jperation, and all his under
garments must be of trie rrust intact and scrupulous
cleanliness. Tne ceremony should begin with a
prayer suited to tne genius of the spirit about to
be invoked ana one which would be approved by nin.-
self if he still lived. For example, it would be
inpossiole to evoke Voltaire by reciting prayers
in tne style ot St. Bridget. For tne great men of
antiquity, w

mounted by another and similar chafing-disn
which must likewise contain a quantity of
dried olive wood,
"A nigh candelabrum of copper must be
placed by the wall on the southern side,
and must contain a single taper at purest
white wax, wnicn must alone illuminate the
mystery ot the evocation.
"The white colour of tne al t ar , of the
ram's skin, and of the veil, is consecrated
to Gabriel, the planetary archangel of the
moon, and the Genius of mysteries; the green
of tne copper and the t apest ries is dedi­
cated to the Genius ot Venus.

compassed by a magnetized iron chain, and
by three garland composed of the foliage
and Blossoms of the myrtle, the olive and
the rose.

at the top of the head to receive spices
for burning. It is beneath this canopy
tnat the apparitions will manifest, and it
should be remembereJ tnat Magus must turn
to tne east tor prayer and to the west for
evocat ion.
"before entering tnis l i t t l e sanctuary
devoted to tne religion of remembrance, the
operator must be clothed in his vestment.
On nis breast mustoe tne talisman of Venus
depending from a ribbon of azure silk.
"Tne Oratory and all its objects must
be consecrated on a Friday, during tne nour s
wnicn are set apart to ir.e Genius of Venus.
This consecration is performed by burning
vi ol et s and roses in a f i r e of olive wood.
A shaft must be provided in the Oratory for
the Passage of the smoke, but care must be
taken to prevent tne admission of light
through this channel.
"when these preparations ar e finished,
the operator must impose on himself a r e­
treat of one and twenty days, beginning on
tne anniversary of the death of tne beloved
aeing. During tnis period he must ref rai n
from conferring on any one tne least of
those marks of affection which he was ac­
customed to bestow on the departed; he must
2 6
be absolutely chaste, alike in deed and
thought; ne must take daiiy but ore repast,
consisting of bread, wine, roots and f r o i t s .
Tnese tnree conditions are indispensable
to success in evocation and their accom­
plishment requires complete isolation.
"Every day, snortly before mid-night,
the Magus must assume h is consecr ated dress.
On tne stroke of the mystic hour, he must
enter the Oratory, bearing a lignted candle
in nis rignt hand, and in tne other an
nour-gJass. Tne candle must be fixed in
the candelabra, and the hour-glass on the
altar to r egist er tne f l i g h t of time. The
operator must then proceed to replenish

with his face to the East, he shall softly
go over in his mind tne cherished recol lec­

parted being.
"Mien the upper reservoir of tne hour­
glass is empty the time of contemplation
will be over. By the flame of the taper
tne operator must then kindle the laurel

at a slow pace as far as tne threshold.
The same ceremony must ce f u l f i l l e d at the
same hour during every day of the r e t r e a t ,
and at eacn v i s i t tne crown which is above
toe p o r t r a i t , and the garlandsof tne al tar
and tripod must be carefully renewed. Tne
witnered leaves and flowers must be burnt
eacn evening in a room adjoining tne Ora­
tory .
"When tne twenty-f irst day has ar rived,
the Magus must do his best to have no com­
munication with any one, but if this be
impossible, he must not be tne f i r s t to
speak, and ne must postpone all business

must arrange a small circular table in tne
Oratory, and cover it witn a new napkin of
unblemished whiteness. 11 must be garnished
witn two copper cnaiices, and entire ioaf,
and a crystal flagon of the purest wine,
Tne bread must be broken and not cut, and
the wine emptied in equal portions into the

has at iengtn arrived the Magus snail carr)

snaii be cast on the altar flame in honour
of the Supreme Potency wnicn manifests i t ­
self by Ever Active Intelligence and by
Absolute wisdom. When the wood of the two
chaf ing-d i shes has been reduced to embers,

with a plenitude of faitn and affection.
Let him solemnly entreat it to appear and
renew this interior adjuration seven times
under the auspices of the seven providential
Genii, endeavouring during tne wholeoi tne
time to exalt his soul above tne natural
weaxness of humanity.
"Finally, tne operator, with closed
eyes, and with hands covering nis face,
must call the invoked person in a loud but
gentle voice, pronouncing three times all
tne names which he bore.
Some moments after tne third appeal,
ne must extend nis arms in tne form of a
cross, and l i f t i n g up nis eyes, ne will
benold tne beloved being in a recognisable
manner, in front of him. Tnat is to say,
he will perceive that ethereal substance
separated from tne per isrtab Ie t e r r e s t r i a l -
body, the fluidic envelope of tne soul,
wnich Kabalistic i n i t i a t e s have termed the
P e r i s p i r i t . This substance preserves the
human form but is emancipated from human
inf irmi t i es, and is energ i sed by the spec i aI

of the Magus, or for some religious obser­

Lastly, it will indicate the time when tne
evocation may be renewed.
"When it has disappeared, the operator
must turn to trie East, rekindle tne f i r e
on the a l t a r , and make a final ottering of
incense. Then he must detach the crown and
the garlands, take up his candle, and r e­
t i r e with his face to tne rtfest t i l l he is
out of the Oratory. His last duty is to
burn the final remains of the flowers and
leaves. Their ashes, united to those which
have been collected during tne time of re­
treat, must be mixed with myrtle seed and
secretly buried i n a f i e l d at a depth which
will secure it from disturbance of the
p 1qughshare."
The last two examples are, of course,
those of "white” necromancy. The procedure
followed by savage tribes of course is to­
tally different. Among certain Australian
tribe s tne necromants are called Birraark,
It is said that a Birraark was supposed to
be in i tia ted by the "mrarts" Ighusisl when
they met him wandering in tne bush. It was
from the ghosts that he obtained r e p l i e s to
51
THE ASCI E N T ' S BOOK OF H AO I C
questions concerning events passing at a
distance, or yet to happen, which mignt be
of int erest or moment to his tribe. A
n
account of a spiritual seance in tne bush
is given in "Kamilaroi and Kurnai": "The
t i r e s were let down; the Birraark uttered
the cry "Coo-ee" at intervals. At length,
a distant reply was heard, and snort ly
afterwards the sound as ot persons jumping
on the ground in succession. A voice was
tnen heard in the gloom asking in a strange
intonation ,T
V.hat is wanted?" At the t e r ­
mination ot the seance, the s p i r i t voice
said, "*e are go ing. " F ina l ly, t he Bir f aark
was found in the top of an almost inaccess­
ible tree, apparently asleep."
"In japan, ghosts can be raised in
various wa>s. One mode is to "put into an
andon" fa paper lantern in a frame), "a
hundred rushlights, and repeat an incanta­
tion of a hundred lines. One of these
rusnlignts is taken out at tne end of each
line, and the would-be ghost-seer tnen goes
out in the dark with one light s t i l l burn­
ing, and b i o w s l t o u t , when the ghost ought
to appear. Gi r Is who have l o s t t n e i r lovers
by death often try tnat sorcery."
The mode ot procedure as practised in
Scotland was thus. The haunted room was
made ready. He, "wno was to do the daring
deed, about nightfall entered the room,
bearing with him a table, a cha i r , a candle,
5 2
THE ANCI ENT' 9 BOOK OF HAC1IC
a compass, a crucifix if one couid be got,
and a Bible* With the compass he cast a
ci rcle on the middle of the floor, large
enough to hold the chair and the table.
He placed within the ci rcle the chair and
the table, and on the table he laid the
Bible and the crucifix beside the lighted
candle. If he had not a crucifix, then he
drew .the figure of a cross on the floor
within the circle. W
hen all this was done,
he rested himself on the chair, opened the
Bible, and waited for the coming of the
s p i r i t . Exact!* at midnight tne s p i r i t
came. Sometimes the door opened si owl*,
and there glided in noiselessly a lady
sheeted in white with a face of woe and
told her story to the man on his asking her
in the name of God what she wanted. What
she wanted was done in me morning, and the
s p i r i t rested ever after. Sometimes the
s p i r i t rose from the floor and sometimes
came forth from the wall. One there was
who burst into tne room witha strong bound,
danced wildly round the ci rcle and f l o u r ­
ished a long whip round the man's head, but
never dared to step within the circle.
During a pause in his frantic dance he was
asked, in God’s name, what ne wanted. He
ceased his dance and told his wishes. His
wishes were carried out, and tne s p i r i t
was in peace."
In wraxalls' "Memoirs of the Courts of
Berlin, Dresden, Warsaw, and Vienna" there
is an amusing account of the raising of the
33
THE A N C I E N T 'S BOOK O f MAO I C
S^ost of Cneval ier de Saxe. Reports had been
circulated that at his palace at Dresden
there was secreted a large sum of money,
and it was urged that if his s p i r i t could
be compeI led to appear, interesting secrets
•■night be extorted from him. Curiosity,
tombined wi tn avarice, accordingly prompted
h<s principal heir, Prince Charles, to try
the experiment, and, on the appointed night
Schrepfer was the operator in raising tne
apparition. He commenced his proceedings
ty r etiring into the corner of the gallery
where, Kneeling down with many mysterious
cer emon ies, he invoked the s p i r i t t o a p p e a r .
M length a loud c l a t t e r was heard at all
windows on the outs ide, resemb I irig more the
affect produced by a number of wet fingers
drawn over the edge of glasses than anything
else to which it could be compared.
This sound announced the arrival of
the good s p i r i t s , and was shortly followed
byayell of a f r i g h l f u l and unusual nature,
which indicated tne presence of malignant
s p i r i t s . Schrepfer continued his invoca­
tions, when ’’the door suddenly opened with
violence, and something that resembled a
black ball or glubs rolled into the room.
It was enveloped in smoke or cloud, in tne
midst of which appeared a human face, like
tne countenance of the Chevalier de Saxe,
from which issued a loud and angry voice,
exclaiming in German, "Carl, was wollte

CHAPTER M!
ON INVOCATIONS
S p i r i t s can communicate spontaneous I>,
or come at our call; that is, on invocation.
Some persons think we should abstain from
invoking sucn or sucn a s p i r i t , and that
it is preferable to wait tor tne one who
wishes to communicate. This opinion is
founded on tne fact that, in calling a de­
signated s p i r i t , we are not certain that
It is he who presents himself, while he who
comes spontaneously, and ot hi sown impulse,
better proves his identity, as he thus an­
nounces his desire to converse witnus. In
our opinion this is an error; f i r s t l y , be­
cause there are always s p i r i t s around us,
most of them of a low class, who ask no
better than to communicate; in tne second
place, and for this last reason alone in
not calling any one i n p a r t i c u l a r , the door
(s open to all who wish to enter. In an
assembly, not to give the word to any one
in particular; the door is open to all who
wish to enter; and the result ot tnis is
well known. The direct appeal made to a
designated s p i r i t , is a bond between him
and us; we cal I nimby our desire, and thus
erect a kind ot barrier against intruders.
Without a direct appeal, a s p i r i t would
□ I ten have no motive for coming to us, un­
less it might be our tami I iar s p i r i t . These
two methods have each their advantages, and
tne difficulty would be only in the absolute
exclusion of one of tne two. There is no
36
THE A N C I E N T 'S BOOR OF HAOIC
irouble inregard to spontaneous communica­
tions where one is master of the s p i r i t s ,
and is certain not to let the bad gain an>
dominion; then it is often useful to wait
tne good pleasure of those who desire to
communicate, because their tnought is under
no r es t r a i n t ; and in tnisway very admirable
things may be obtained, while you cannot
be sure tnat the s p i r i t you call will be
disposed to speak, or capable of doing so,
in the sense that is desired. The scrupu­
lous examination we have advised is guaran­
tee against evil communications. In regu­
lar reunions, especially In those engaged
on a continuous work, there are always the
accustomed s p i r i t s , who are at the rendez­
vous without being called, because, by
reason of the regul arity of the seances,
tney are pre-engaged; they often begin
spontaneously to t r e a t a certain subject,
develop a proposition, or prescribe what
should be done; and then they are easily
recognized, whether by tne form ot tneir
language, or their writing, or by certain
habits familiar to them.
W
hen it is wished to communicate witn
a designated s p i r i t , ne must of necessity
be invoked. if ne can come, this answer
is usually obtained: Yes; or, I am here;
or, What do you want of me? Sometimes he
enters directly into the matter, answering
by anticipation the Questions we proposed
to address to him.
37
THE A H C I E H T ' S BOOK OF MAO I C
W
hen a s p i r i t is invoked for the f i r s t
time, it is best to designate him with some
precision. In the questions addressed to
h im, we shoold avoid dry, imperative forms;
they might be a reason for his withdrawal.

Kind of anticipated invocation, and as we
always have our familiar s p i r i t s , wno are
identified with uur thoughts, they prepare
the way, so that notning opposes it ; the
s p i r i t whomwewisri to call is already pre­
sent. Wnen t h i s is not tne case, tne fa­
miliar s p i r i t of tne medium, or of the in-
terrogator, or one of tne habitues, goes
to rind him, which does not require muen
time. If the invoked s p i r i t cannot come
instantly, the messenger (the neathens
would have said Mercury^ asks for a delay,
sometimes of five minutes, a quarter of an
nour, and even several days, and when ne
arrives, he says, he is there; and then we
can begin the questions we want to ask him.
The messenger is not always a necessary
intermediary, tor tne appeal of tne invoca­
tor may be heard directly by the s p i r i t .

Ahen we say, make tne invocation in
the name ot God, we mean that our recommend­
ation should be taken seriously, and not
I igntly; those wno see in it only a formula,
and of l i t t l e consequence, would better
abstain from it . Invocations often present
more d<f f icu It ies to med iurns than spontane­
ous dictation, espec ia IIy when exact answer s
are wanted to circumstantial questions.
For tnat end special mediums are required
at once flexible and positive; and we nave
seen that these last are quite rare, for,
as we have said, the fluidic r el a t i o n s
frapports) are not always instantaneously
established with the f i r s t s p i r i t comer.
It is, tneretore, best trial mediums should
not. attempt special invocations, until
assured of tne development of tneir faculty,
and of tne nature of tne sp iri ts wno a s s i s t
them; Torwitn those who are badl y surround­
ed, the invocations could have no characLer
of author i ly.
Mediums are genera I Iy much more sought
for invocations ot private interest then
for communications of general interest;
this is explained by the verjr natural de­
sir e we nave to converse with tnose who afe

make Several important recommendations on
tnis-subject to mediums. First, to accede
to tnis desire only wiin the utmost reserve
with per sons in whose sincerity they cannot
completely t r u st, and to be on their guard
3 9
a
THE A N C I E N T ' S BOOK OF MAOl C
against tne snares that malicious persons
might set for them. Secondly, not to lend
themselves to it under any pretext, if they
discover motives of curiosity or interest,
and not a serious intention on tne part of
me invocator; to refuse themselves to all
idle questions, or those aside from the
c i r c l e of questions that may rationally be
addressed to s p i r i t s . Tne suggestions
snould be addressed to s p i r i t s . Tne sug­
gestions shouldbeput with clearness, per­
spicuity, and without evasion, it categori­
cal answers are desired.
All those that have an insidious char­
acter snould be declined, for it is well
Known tnat s p i r i t s do not line those in­
tended to put them to the proof; to i nsi st
on questions of tnis nature is to wisn to
be deceived. The invocator should go frank­
ly and openly to me desired end, witnout
subterfuge or windings; if ne tears to ex­
plain himself, he would better abstain.
If invocations are made in the absence of
tne one has requested them, it should be
done with the greatest prudence; it is
even often times preferable to abstain en­
t i r e l y , those persons alone being f i t to
cr11icise the answers, to judge of the iden­
t i t y , to cnallange explanations if there
is cause, and to put incidental questions
brought up by circumstances. Besides,

In a word, the medium should avoid all that
could transform him intoaconsu11ing agent,

onymous with a fortune-teller.
Spirits ioho may be invoked,
All s p i r i t s , to wnatever degree of

left tnis life but lately, and those who
have lived in the most remote times; i l ­
lustrious men and the most obscure of our
relatives, our friends, and those who are
indifferent to us; but it is not said that
tney will or can always come at our call:
independently of their will, or if the per­
mission may be refused them by a superior
power, they might be prevented by motives
which i t i s n o t always given to penetrate,

There is, again, his own situation,
Wnile tne state of incarnation ma> not be
an absolute obstacle, it may ts a mndrance
at certain given moments, especially wnen
it takes place in interior wjrids, and when
tne s p i r i t himself is but l i t t l e dumateri-
allied. In tne superior worlds, in those
where the ties of s p i r i t and matter are
very feeble, tne man it es tat ior. is almost
as easy as in the wander irig state, and in
aJ I casus easier than in uijsu *nert the
corporeal matter is more compact.
Tne toreiyncauses pertai ft principally
to tne nature ot the medium, to tn a to f the
invoker, to tne sphere in whicn the invo­
cation is made, and, lastly, to the end
proposed. Some mediums receivc more espec­
ially communications from tneir tamiiiar -
s p i r i t s , who may be more or less elevated;
others are capable of serving as intermedi­
aries to all s p i r i t s ; that depends on the
sympathy or antipathy, tne at t r act i o n or
repulsion, which the personal s p i r i t yt

who offers them no material obstacle. All
things, besides, being equal as to moral
conditions, tne greater f aci lit y a medium
nas in writing or expressing himself the
more nis relations with the s p i r i t world
may be general i zed.
Tne faci lit y with which the nati i t of
co<nniun icat ing with such or such a s p i r i t
gives, must also be taken into considera­
tion; witn time the foreign s p i r i t identi­
fies himself with the s p i r i l o f the medium,
and witn him wno c a l l s him. The question
of Sympatny with render coramunications are
more prompt; this is why a f i r s t conversa­
tion is not always as satisfying as might
be desired, and it also is why tne s p i r i t s
themselves often ask to be recalled. The
s p i r i t who is in tne habit of coming in as
if at nome; ne is fair. i I itr i zed with his
auditors, and with his ir.terpr eter s; tie
speaks and acts more freely.
To recapitulate: From wnat we have
just said, it r esults that tne power of in­
voking any s p i r i t wnatever does not imply
that tne s p i r i t is at our orders; ne can
come at one moment, and not at another,
which such medium or such invocator as
pleases him, and not witn such otner; say
what he pleases, without being constrained
to say what he does not wi sh to say; go
when it is agreeable to him; finally, from
causes dependent or not upon his will,

after naviny shown himself assiduously
during some time, he may suddenly cease to
come. It is from all tnese motives that
when we desire to call a new s p i r i t , it <s
necessary to ash for our guide protector,
if tne invocation is possible; in cases
where it may not be, ne quite generally
gives the motives, and then it is useless
to insist.
A
n important question presents i t s e l f
nere—that of knowing whether or not there
w o u l dbe disagreeabIe consequences from in­
voking a bad s p i r i t . That depends on the
end proposed, and the ascendency that can
be had over them. There is no dif f i cu l t y
when we call them with a serious and in­
structive aim or with a view of improving
them; or commanding them, it is very great,
on tne contrary, if it is from pure curios­
ity or pleasantry or if one puts nimselt
over me ir power by demanding of them an_y
serv ice whatever.
Tne good s p i r i t s , in Such case, can
very well give them tne power to do wnat
is asked of tnem, safe to p u n i s h severely
afterward the rash man who dared to invoke
tneir nelp and believe tnem more p o w e r f u l
than God. It is vain tnat he may have pro­
mised himself to make a good use ot it in
the end, and to dismiss the servitor once

solicited, however minute it may be, is a

veritable pact concluded withthebad sp i r-

Ascendency is exercised over the
i nf e r i o r s p i r i t s only by
moral superiori ty,
The perverse sp ir i ts feel their masters
in good men; witn those wno oppose to them
only strength of will, a kind of brute
force they struggle, and are often strong­
er. A person t r i e d in t h i s way to tame a

One is not astonished that me name
of God invoked against them should often
be powerful. St. Louis has given tne rea­
son in the following manner:-—Tne name of
God has influence over imperfect s p i r i t

Language to hold with Spi ri t s
f
The degree of superiority or i n f e r i ­
ority of the s p i r i t s naturally indicates
the tone it is proper to take with tnern.
It is evident that the more elevated tney
are, the more right they nave to our r e­
spect, ta our regard, and to our submission,
we should show them as much deference as
we should have done during their lives,
but from different motives; on the earth
we should have considered their rank and
their social position; in the world of
s p i r i t s our respect is addressed only to
moral superiority. Their very elevation
raises them above the puerllies ot our ad­
ulatory forms. It is not by words that
we can secure their kind feeling, but by
the sincerity of our sentiments. It would
be ridiculous, then, to give them the t i ­
t l e s whicn our usages consecrate to the
distinction of ranks, and which, during
their lives, might have f l a t t e r e d their
vanity; if tney are really superior, they
not only will not care for them, but to do
so will displease tnem. A good thought
is more agreeable to them than the most
f l a t t e r i n g epitnets; if it were otherwise,
they would not be above humanity. The
s p i r i t of a venerable ec cl esia sti c, who in
this world, was a prince of me church, a
good man, practicing the law qf Jesus,
answered once to a person wno invoked him
under the t i t l e of "my lord," "You should
4 6
THE ANCI ENT' 3 BOOK 0 F MAGIC
at least say, ex-my Lord, for here is no
other Lord but God; know that I see who on
earth knelt before me, and those before
whom I myself bowed."
As to the inferior sp1r i t s , tneir char­
acter shows us tne language proper to use
with them. Among the number there are some
who, though inoffensive, andevenkind, are
t r i f l i n g , ignorant, stupid: to trea t them
the same as serious s p i r i t s , as some per­
sons do is about the same as to bow before
a scholar or an ass muffled ina professor' s
cap. A tone of familiarity would not be
out of place with them, and they do not
take offense at it; on the contrary, tney
Mill ing Iy recei ve it.
Among the inferior s p i r i t s there are
some wno are unnappy. Whatever may be the
faults t h e y are expia t ihg, their sufferings
en t i t l e them to our consideration, so much
ihe more as no one can f l a t t e r nimself
that ne does not deserve these words of tne
Cnrist: "Let him wno is without sin among
you cast the f i r s t stone." The kindness
we show mem is a comfort to them: in de­
fault of sympathy, they should find the in­
dulgence we should wish them to show to j S.
The s p i r i t s wno reveal their in f er i­
ority by the cynicism of their language,
their lies, the baseness of their senti-

ment, the perfidy of th ei r counsels, are
assuredly less worthy of our i nt er es t tnan
tnose whose words Show thei r repentance;
we owe tnem, at l ea st , the pity we accord
the g r e a t e st criminals, and the way to re­

perv ers it y only among persons with whom
they think there i s nothing to f ea r; for

To r e c a p i t u l a t e : as much as i t would
be ir r ev e re nt i a l to t r e a t the superior
s p i r i t s as equals, j us t so mjcn would it
be rid i cu lo u s to extend tne same deference
to all without exception. Here veneration
for tnose wno deserve i t, g rat it ude for
those wno pro te ct and a s s i s t us, for all
the ot he rs that kindness we may some day
need for ourselves. In penet rating into
tne incorporeal world we learn to know it,
and th i sknowledge should regula te us in
our r e l a t i o n s with those who inhabit it.
The ancients, in t h e i r ignorance, elevated

UTILITY OF SPECIAL INVOCATIONS
The communications obtained from very
superior s p i r i t s , or from those who have
animated the great personages of apti quit y,
48
THE A N C I E N T ' 3 BOOK OF MAGIC
are precious from their exalted teachings.
These s p i r i t s have acquired a degree of
perfection which permits them to embrace a
mere extended sphere of ideas, to penetrate
masteries beyond the ordinary limits of
humanity, and consequently, to i n i t i a t e us
batter than others to certain tnings. It
does not follow that communications trom
less elevated s p i r i t s should be without u-
t i l i t y ; the observer may dr aw more than one
instruction. To Know the manners of a
people, it must be studied in every degree
of the scale. He who has seen it under one
aspect only, would only know it. The his­
tory of a people is not that of i t s kings
and upper social circles; to judge it, one
should see it in its private life and Cus­
toms.
Now, tne superior s p i r i t s are the
upper ci rcles of the s p i r i t world: their,
very elevation places them so much above
us that we are frightened at tne distance
that separates us. S p iri ts more bourgeois

circumstances of their new existence more

coming at our call?"

sions with which he may be cnarged; and
s t i l l further, permission may be refused
him. There are s p i r i t s who can never

spheres of pun!shment, at least, without
a superior perrr, iss ion, which is granted
only for the general good. That a s p i r i t
may be ati Ie to common icate, he must have
attained the same degree of advancement
as that of the world to wnich he is
called; otherwise he is strange to the
ideas of that world, and nas no point
of comparison. It is not the same with
those who are sent on missions, or in
expiation, to inferior worlds; they have
the necessary ideas to reply."
4- "For what motives may tne permission to
communicate be refused to a s p i r i t ? 1

It may be a t r i a l or punishment for him,

Tney are often forewarned by the familiar

seek them; but here i s a phenomenon d i f ­
ficul t to explain to you, because you
cannot yet understand the transmission
of thought among s p i r i t s . Aik i can

20- "Is invocation an agreeable o r a p a i n f u l
thing for s p i r i t s ? Do they come volun­
ta ri ly when tney are cal led’ "
"Tnat depends on their character and the
motives from which tney are called.
W
hen the object is praiseworthy, and
when the surrounding is sympathetic to
tnem, it is agreeable to them, and even
at tractive; the s p i r i t s ar e always happy
in the affection t e s t i f i e d for them.
There are those to whom it is a great
happiness to communicate with men, and
who suffer from the indifference in
which they are left. But, as I nave
said, it depends upon their character;
among s p i r i t s there are also misan­
thropes, who do not I ike to be disturbed
and wnose answers show tneir ill humor,
especially when they are called by in­
different people, in whom they are not
at all interested. A s p i r i t has often
no motive for coming at the call of an
unknown person, who is indifferent to
him, and almost always moved by curios­
ity; if he comes, he usually makes but
snort v i s i t s , unless there may be a se­
rious and instructive end in view in
the Invocation."
R«n»rfc: W
e see people who invoke their re­
lations only to ask them the most ordinary
things of material l i f e ; for instance, one
5 8
to know if ha Shall r e n t e r sell his house,
another to know what profit he snail have
from nib nerchandise, tne place where rnone/
is deposited, whetner gr not a certain busi­
ness will be advantageous. Our r el a t i o n s
from beyond the tomb are interested in us
onlj by reason of affection we have tor
them. If all our thought is limited to
thinKing them sorcerers, if we tnink ot
them only to ask favors ot tnom, they can­
not nave any very great sympathy for us,
and we snould notoe astonisned at the l i t ­
t l e benevolence tuey sometimes evince, we
must consider tnein too.
21. " 1s tnere a d i f t er ence between good and
Lad s p i r i t s , in regard to their readi­

"There is a very great difference; bad
s p i r i t s come voluntarily only inasmuch
as they hope to govern and ma*e dupes;
but they experience a strong c o n t r a r i ­
ety when tney are forced to confess
tneir f ault s, and only ask to go away
again, like a pupil cal led up for cor­
rection. Tney can be constrained to
come, by the Superior s p i r i t s , as a
punishment, and for the instruction of
the incarnated. Invocation is painful
for good s p i r i t s when they ar* called
uselessly, for f r i v o l i t i e s ; then thej

"Of course, asyuucan invoke an incar­

the invocation of a living person is during
his natural sleep, because nis s p i r i t , be­

who c a l l s him as to go elsewhere.
When tne invocation is made with
the consent of the person, and he seens to
sleep for the purpose, th» s very desi re may
ret ard the sleep and trouble the s p i r i t ;
an unforced sleep is preferable.

"No; you are yourselves invoked more

—"Who can invoke us if we are but ob­
scure beings?"
"In other existences you may have been

For in tne person consecrating, tnere
is required firmness, constancy, and Holi­
ness ot life; and that tne consecrator him­
self snail, with a firm and undubitable
faith, believe the virtue, power, and ef­
fect thereat.
Then in tne prayer by which the conse­
cration isrnade it derives its v ir tue e i t her
from divine Inspiration, or eibe by compos­
ing [t from sundry piaces i n the Holy Scr ip-
ture, i n the commemora t ion o f same ot t h e
wonderful miracles of God, effects, prom­
ises, sacraments ana sacramental tnings,
of wnicn I nave abundance in holy writ.
Tnere must likewise be used the invo­
cation of divine names, tnat are s i gn i t ica~
t i v e o t t n e work in hand; I ikewi se a sanct i-
fying and expiation w h i c h is wrought Dy
sprinkling with naly w'ater, unctions witn
noly oil, ano odoriferous spffurnigattons.
Therefore in every consecration tnere is
8 0
1
always used a benediction and consecration
of water, earth, oil , tire, and Sotfumiyji-
Lions, rc ., with consecrated wax-rlignts or
lamps burning; for witnout I iyhts no conse­
cration is duly performed- You must tnere-
fore particularly observe this, that wnen
any thing fwriicn I call prophane’ is to be
used, in wnich there is def i Iement or pol­
lution, it must, f i r s t of al l , b ep ur if ied
by an Exorcism, composed solely for that
purpose, which ought to precede the conse­
cration which things being so made pure
are most apt to receive the influences
of the divine virtue. You must also ob­
serve that at the end of any consecration,
after tne prayer is rightly performed, as
I nave mentioned, tne operator ought to
bless the thing consecrated, by breathing
out some sentence witn divine virtue and
power of present consecration, with a com­
memoration of nis virtue and authority,
that so it may be the more duly performed,
and wi tn an earnest and attentive mind.
Now I shall give ye here some examples,
that, by these, a pain may be made to the
wnole perfection tnereot.
THE CQS'SSCRATlOtf OF WATER
So in trie consecration of water, you
must commemorate that God has placed the
firmament in the midst of the waters, and
likewise that God has placed tne fountain
of waters in the earthly paradise, from
whence sprang four holy river s that water

tne wnole eartn; I ikewi se we are to remember
m a t God caused tne waters to Oe an i ns t ru ­
ment of nis j u s t i c e in destroying tne g iants ,
by bringing on tne deluge which covered the
face of tne whole eartn; and in the over­
inrow of the host of Pharaon in tne Red
Sea, and that God led the c n i l d r e n o f Israel
tnrougn on dry land, and tnrough the midst
of the river Jordan, and likewise n i s mar­
vell ously drawing water out of tne stony
rock in tne wilderness; and tnat a t the
prayer of Samson, he caused water t o flow
out of tne jaw-bone of an ass; and likewise
that God has made water the instrument of
his mercy and salvation for the expiation
Of or ig i nal sin; also that Cnrist was bap­
tize d in the ri v e r Jordan, and hath there­
by sa n c t i f i ed and cleansed tne waters;
likewise c e r t a i n divine names a r e t o b e in-
vocated which ar e conformable hereto; as,
that God i s a living fountain, living water,
tne fountain of mercy, and names of tne
I ike so rt.
CONSECRATION OF FIRE
And likewise, in the consecration of
f i r e , you are to commemorate that God hath
created the f i r e to be an instrument to
execute ni s j u s t i c e , for punishment, venge­
ance, and tne e xp ia ti on of sins; also, wnen
God comes to judge the world that he will
pommand a conf lagra t ion of f i r e to go before
him; likewise we are to mention th a t God

loubly ne rekindled the same, being extinct,
and preserved it elsewhere from going out

of tnis sort; likewise tne names of God are
to be cal led upon which are consonant to
thi s; as you read in tne law and prophets,
tnat God is a consuming fire; and likewise
if mere areany divine names wnicn signify
t i r e , as tne glory of God, the i ignt of
God, the spIendor and brigntness of God, tc,
THE CONSECRATION Ob OIL
And likewise in tne consecration of
oil and perfumes you are to mention sucn
tnings as are consonant to this purpose, as
of tnenoly anoitingoii mentioned inExodus,
and divine names significant thereunto;
such as is tne name of Christ, wnich sig­
ni f i es anointed; and whatever mysteries
tnere are r el at i ve to oil in the Scriptures,
as the two olive- trees di s t i l l i ng holy oil

of God, mentioned in Revelations*

of composing the consecrations, wnicn f i r s t

tne consecration of places, instruments
and the like t h i n g s .
THfi CONSECRATION PLACES, GROUND, CIRCLE, f€.
Therefore when you would consecrate
any place or ci rcle, you snould take the
prayer of Lamas used in the dedication and
consecration of the Temple; you must like­
wise bless the place by sprinkIing with
holy water and witn suft umigat ions, and
commemorate in the benediction holy mys­
teries; such as these, tne sanct ificat ion
of thorne of God, of Mount Sinai, of the
tabernacle of tne covenant, of the noly
of nolies, of the temple of Jerusalem: also
the sanctification of Mount Goiogotha, by
the transf i gurat ion and ascension of Christ
*c. And by invocating all divine names
which are significant to tnis; such as the
place of God, the thorne of God, the chair

of God, the tabernacle of God, trie altar
of God, tne habitation or God, and tne line
divine names ot this sort, which are to be
written about the ci rcle, or place to be
consecrated.
And, in the Consecration ot Instru­
ments, and ever> other thing that is used
in this Art, you must proceed after the same
manner, by sprinkling with holy water the
same, by fumigation, by anointingwi tn ho ly
oil, sealing it witn some holy seal, and
blessing it with prater, and by commemo­
rating holy things out ot tHe sacred Scrip­
tures, collecting divine names wnich are
agreeable to the things la be consecrated;
as for example, in the consecration of tne
sword we are to remember in the gospel,
1tne tnat hath two coats," t c . and that in
tne second of the Maccabees, it is said
that a sword was divinely and miraculously
sent to JUDAS M
ACCABEUS; and if mere is
any thing of tng like in tne prophets, as
"take unto two-edged swords," *c. And
you shall also, iri the same manner, con­
secrate experiments an d books, and wnatever
of the like nature, as writings, pictures,
*c., by sprinkling, perfuming, anointing,
sealing, blessing, witn holy commemor at jon5,
and cal ling to remembrance tne s a n c t i f i ­
cation of mysteries; as the table of tne

Such divine names as ar e convert ieni to tn i s;
as inese are, viz. tne testament af Gudr the
book of God, tne Book of Life, tne know­
ledge of God, tne wisdom of God, and tne
I ike, And witn sucn kind of r i t e s as these
is the personal consecration performed,
Tnere are besides these anotner r i t e
of consecration of great power and afT icac>;
and tni s is one of tne kinds of superst i­
tions, viz. when. the writ uf consecration
or collection of an/ sacrament in tne
church is transferred to ma t thing wnicn
we would consecrate,
11 must be noted that vows, oblations,
and sa cr ifi ce s , have the power of consecra­
tion also, as wei I real as personal; and
the/ are as it were, certain conventions
between those names wi tn which trie/ are
made and u s who m^e tnein, strongly cleaving
to our desire and wisned effect s, as wnen
we sacrifice with certain names, or thing;
as fumigations, unctions, rings, images,
mirrors; and some things less material, as
characters, seals, pentacles, encnantments,
orations, pictures, Scriptures, of wnich
we nave largely spoken before.

OF THE IXVOCATION OF EVIL SPIRITS, AND THE
BINDING OF, AND CONSTRAINING
OF THEN TO APPEAR.
Now if thou art desirous of binding
anjr s p i r i t to a ready obedience to thee, I
will show you now a cert ain book may be
made by wnicn they maybe invoked; and t h i s
book is to be consecrated a book of Evil
S p iri ts , cer emori ious ly tu be composed in t he
name and order, whereunto tney bind with a
certain noly oath, the ready and present
obedience of the s p i r i t . Tnis book is
therefore to be made of the most pure and
clean paper, wnicn ts generally called v i r ­
gin paper; and this book must be inscribed
af t e r this manner, viz. let there be drawn
on tne left side of the book the image of
tne s p i r i t , and on the right side thereof
nis character, w i t h t h e o a t h above it, con­
taining the name of the s p i r i t , his dignity
and place, with his office and power. Yet
many Magicians do compose this book other­
wise, omiting trie cnaracters and images;
but I think that it ismucn more efficacious
not to neglect any tning above mentioned
in the forms.
Tnere is likewise to be observed the
circumstances of places, times, hours, ac­
cording to the s t a r s wnicn these s p i r i t s
are under, and are seen to agree to; with
their s i t e , r i t e , andorder, being applied.
THE A N C I E N T 'S BOOK OF MAO I C

THE ANCI ENT* S BOOK OF MAGIC
A'nich booh being so written, is to be
well bound, adorned, garnished, embellish­
ed, and kept secure, wi tn regist er s and seals
lest it should happen after the consecra­
tion to open insome part not designed, and
endanger the operator. And above a l l , let
this book be kept as pure and reverent as
possible; for irreverance of mind causes
it to lose its virtueby poI Iution and pro-
phanat ion*
Now this sacred oooh being thus com­
posed according to the form and manner I
nave delivered, you are to consecrate it
after a two-fold way; the f i r s t is, that
all and singularly each of the s p i r i t s who
are written in the booh be called to th e
ci rcle, according to zhe r i t e s mayic&lr
which we nave before taught, and place tne
book whicn is to be consecrated in a t r i ­
angle on tne outside of tne ci rc le; then
read, in the presence of the s p i r i t s , all
the oatns whicn are contained and written
in that book; then the book to be consecrated
being already placed without the ci r c l e in
a triangle there drawn, compel all the spir-
iis to impose their hands where tneir images
and characters are drawn, and to confirm
and consecrate the same with a special and
common oath. This being done, let tne booh
be shut and preserved as I nave spoken be­
fore; then license the s p i r i t s to depart
according to due r i t e and Magical order.

THE A N C I E N T 'S BOOK OF HAOIC
There is anotner method extant among
us to consecratinga genera I book of $ p i r i t s
which is more easy, and ot as mucn efficacy
to produce every effect, except that in
opening m i s book, the s p i r i t s do not a l ­
ways appear visible. tod tnis way i s t n u s :
let be made a book of s p i r i t s , as we nave
before snown, cut in the end thereof write
invocat ions, bonds, and strong con jurat ions,
wrier ewith every s p i r i t may be bound; then
oind tnisLook between two lamensor tables,
and on the inside thereof draw or let be
drawn two Holy pentaclesof the Divine Maj­
esty, which I nave before set forth, out
of tne Apocalypse. Then let the f i r s t of
them be piaced in the beginning of the book,
and tne second at the end of the same.
This book being thus perfected, let
it be brought, in a d e a r and f a i r nlgnt,
to a ci r c l e prepared in a cross-way, ac­
cording to the art wnicn I have before de­
livered; and there, in the f i r s t place,
tne book ts to be opened, and to be conse­
crated accord ing to tne r i t e s and ways wnicn
we have before delivered concerning conse­
cration, wh ich be ing done, let all the s p i r -

in their own order and place, conjuring
tnrice by the bonds described in the book
that they come to that place within tne
space ot three days, to assure their obedi­

it in the midst ot tne circle* and stop the

covered: the circle being destroyed alter
j On have licensed the spirits* depart be­

the middle of the nignt* return and make
the ci rcle anew and on tn) knees make prater
unto God, and give tnanks to him; and let
a precious perfume be made, open the hole
in which you buried your book and take it
out, and so let i t be kept* not opening me

But when the operator would work by
tne Book tnus consecrated he should do it
in a fair and clear season, when tne s p Jr its
are least troubled; and let nim turn him­
self towards the region of the s p i r i t s ; then
let him open the book under a due register,
and I iKewise Invoke the s p i r i t s by their
Oaths there described and confirmed, and by

until the end of tne days of consecration.
You shall also have in readiness apre cio us
perfume and a pure anointing o i l . — And let
them both be kept consecrated. Tnen set a
censor on the head of tne a l t a r , wnerein
you shall kindle the holy f i r e and make a
precious perfume every day that you pray.
Now for yournabit, you shall nave a
long garment of white linen, close before
and benind, which may come down over me
feet, and gird yourself about the loins
with a girdle. You snalI likewise nave a
veil made of pure white linen on whicn must
ue wrote in a g i l t lamen, tne name Rajpore-
Kogur; a I I things which are to be consecrated
and s anct if ied in order. But you must not
go into t h i s noly place t i l l it be f i r s t
washed and covered with a cloth new and
9 2
clean, and then you rnay enter, but with
your feet naked and bare; and when you
enter therein you snail sprinkle witn holy
water, then make a perfume upon the altar;
and then on tny Knees pray before the al­
tar as we have directed.
Now when the time is expired, on tne
last day, you snaii fast more s t r i c t l y ;
and fasting on tne day following, at tne
rising of tne sun, enter tne holy place,
using the ceremonies betore spoken of, f i r s t
by■ sprinkling thyself, then making a per­
fume, you shall sign the cross with holy
oil in me forehead, and anoint your eyes,
using prayer in all these consecrations*
Then, open the lamen and pray before tne
al tar upon your knees; and then an invoca­
tion may be made as follows:
AN INVOCATION OF THE GOOD SPIRITS
In the name ot the Most Eminent Adepts,
I do desire tnee, strong and mighty spir­

to trie glory and nanour of his divine Maj­

Lord tny will be done on earth as it

And that all things may work together

Let tne perfume and the holy anointing

to be observed, that as often as he enters

OF ORACLES BY DREARS
But natural things and their own mix­

y disciples,
and I always use Sucn to receive oracles
from a s p i r i t by a dream; wnicn are either
by perfumes, unctions, meats, candles,
seals, rings, etc.
Now those who are desir ious to receive
oracles in or tnrougha dr earn. Jet nim make

purpose. There are likewise images of

wnen he goes to sleep, dotn effectually
Sive true dreams of whatever the mind hath
before determined or consulted upon, tne
practice of whicn is as fallows:

make when Leo ascends, the sun being in the
ninth house in Aries; tnou Shalt write upon
tne figure the name of the e f f e c t desired,
and in the nand of tne angel the name of
tne Int ell i genc e of the sun. Let tne same
image be made in Virgo ascending. Mercury
being fortunate in Aries in the ninth; or
Gemini ascending, Mercury being fort unate
in the ninth nouse in Aquarius; and let it
be received with Saturn with a fortunate
aspect, and let the name of the s p i r i t be
wri tt en upon i t. Let tne same likewise be
made in Libra ascending, Venus being r e ­
ceived from Mercury in Gemini in the ninth
house, and write upon it tne angel of Venus.
Again, you may make the same image Aquarius
ascending, Saturn for tunately possessing
the ninth in hi s exaI tat ion, wnicn is Libra;
and let there be written upon it tne angel
of Saturn. Tne same nay be made Cancer
ascending, the moon being received by Jupi-
te r and Venus in Pisces, and being fo r tu ­
nately placed in the ninth nouse, and write
upon it the s p i r i t of the moon.
There are I ikewi semade r inys of dreams
of wonderful efficacy; and there are ring s
of tne Sun and Saturn; and tne consteI Iat ion
of themiswnen tne sun or Saturn ascend
in tnei r e x al t at ions in tne ninth, and when
tne moon is joined to Saturn in tne ninth,
and in that sign wnicn was the ninth house
of tne n a t i v i t y ; and write and engrave upon

or Saturn; and by these rules you may know
how and Lj what means to constitute more ot
thyself: but know this, that such images,
worn nothing 4as they are simple images I
unless they are vividfied by a spirit ual
and celestial virtue, and chiefly by the ar­
dent desire and firm intent ot me soul ot
the operator. But who can give a soul to
an image, or make a stone, or metal, or
clay, or wood, or wax, or paper to live’
Certainly no man; he only hath it who tran­
scends the progress of angels, and comes
to tne very architype himself.
The tables of numbers likewise confer
to the receiving of oracles, being duly
formed under their own consteIlations. Holy
tables and papers likewise serve to this
effect, being especially composed and con­
secrated; such as the Atmutel of Solomon,
and tne Table of tne Revolution of the name
ot Tetr agr ammaton; and those things which
are of this kind, and written to produce
grammaton, and those tnings wnich are of
thi s kind, and written to produce these
effects, out of various figures, numbers,
holy Scriptures, and pictures, with in­
scriptions of the divine names of God and
names of noly angels; the composition where­
of is taken out of diverse places ot the
noly Scriptures, PsaI ms, and versicles, and
other certain promises out of the divine
revelations and prophecies.

After those prayers and orations are said,
let him begin to invocate the s p i r i t which
ne desireth, witn a gentle and loving en­
chantment to all the coasts of the world,
with a commemoration of nis own authority
and power. Then r e s t and look round to see
if any s p i r i t does appear; which if he de­
lays, then let nim repeat his invocation,
as above said, until ne natn done it tnree

so that all nis conjurations and commemora­

And af t e r these courses are finished,
cease; and it tne s p i r i t shall appear let

OF THE PEHTACLR OF THE HIHDU,
It is always necessary to have th i s
pentacle in readiness to bind witn, in case
the s p i r i t s would refuse to be obedient,
as they can have no power over the exorcist
while provided witn and f o r t i f i e d by the
pentacle the virtue of thenoly names there­
in written presiding with wonderful influ­
ence over the s p i r i t s .
It should be made in the day and nour
of Mercury upon parchment made o f a k i d s k i n ,
or vlrgin, or pure, clean, white paper; and
the figures and l e t t e r s wrote in pure gold;
and it ought to be consecrated and sprink led
with holy water.
When the vesture is put on, it will be
convenient to say the following o r ati o n :—

THE MAHHER OF WORKING.
Let the moon be increasing and equal,
it can then be conveniently done; but
especi all y let her not be combust, or in
^ia combusts, which is between fourteen de-
greesor Libra and fourteen degrees of Scor­
pio.
The d i s c i p l e must be clean and p u r i -
f'ed for nine days before he does tne work.
L_et him nave r eady tne per t ume appropr i a ted
to the day wherein he does the work; and he
must be provided with holy water from an
*dePt| or he may make i t holy himself , by
reading over it the c o n s e c r a t i o n of water of
baptism; he must have a new vesseI of e a r t h ,
wan f i r e , the v e s t u r e , and the p e n t a c l e ;
and let all t h e s e t h i n g s be r i g o t l y and duly
consecrated and p r epar ed. Let one of the
companions carry the vessel with f i r e , and
tne perfumes, and l e t another bear tne book,
trie garment, and p e n t a c l e ; and l e t the op­
erator himself c a r r y the sword, over which
should be sa id a prayer of c o n s e c r a t i o n ;
and on the middle of the sword on one s i d e

Side, Tetragrammaton. Ahd the p l a c e being

fixed upon where the c i r c l e is to ce erect­

taught, and sprinkle the same with holy
water, consecrating, etc. etc.
The disciple m u s t therefore be prepared
with fasti ng, chast i ty , and at>si inence, for
the space of three days before the day of

up Corah, Dathan, and Abiram: and in the

deprive you of your o f fic e, joy, and place,

were believed to nave been expelled from
Heaven for their sins; they endeavoured to

but wer e a Iways rejected, and out of revenge
they find their pleasure In injuring ine
inhabitants. Xenoritus thought that pen­
ance and self-mor11f i c a t ion, though not
agreeable to the gods, pacified the malice
of the Cacodaemons. Ahrimanes and his f o l ­

ALBiGENSES:
A sect which originated in the soutn
of France in the twelfth century. They
were sa cal led from one of tne ir terr itor ia I
centres, tnat of Albi, it isprobable that
their heresy came originally from Eastern
Europe, and they were of ten designated Bul­
garians, and undoubtedly kept up intercourse
witn certain secretaries of Thrace, tne
Bogomils; and they are sometimes connected
with tne Paul icians. It is d i f f i c u l t to
form any exact idea of their doctrines, as
A
l b igens ian texts are rare, and contain
l i t t l e concerning the ir etnics, but we know,
tnat tney were strongly opposed to tne Roman
Catholic Church, and protested against me
corruption of its clergy. But it is not as
a religious body that we have to deal with
the Albi genses here but to consider wnetner
or not their cult possessed any occult s ig ­
nificance. It has been claimed by their
opponents that they admi tted two fundamental
principles, good and bad, saying that God
nad produced Lucifer from HimseIf; that in­
deed Lucifer was me son of God who r evolt -
ed aga Inst Him; that he had carr ied wi m h im
,

a rebel ious par ty of ange Is, ^ho v^ere driven
from Heaven a Iong with him; that Lucifer in
his exi le had created t h i s world with its
inhabitants, where ne reigned, and where
a Ii was evil. It is a Ileged that they f ur ­
ther bel ieved that Ood for the re-establ ish-
ment of ordar had produced a second son,
who was Jesus Christ. furthermore the Catn-
o l i c wr i t e r s on tne Albigenses cnarged them
with believing that the souls of men were
demons lodged in mortal bodies in punish­
ment of their crimes*
AII th i s i s, of cour se, mere trad I t ion,
and we may be sure that the d i s l i k e of the
Albigenses for the i r r e g u I a r i t i e s t h e ncur -
rent in the Roman Church, brought such
charges on their heads, They were indeed,
the lineal ancestors of Protestantism. A
crusade was brought against them by Pope
Innocent III, and wholesale massacres took
place* Tne Inquisition was also let loose
upon them, and they were driven to hide in
the f o r e s t s and among tne mountains, where,
like the Covenanters of Scotland, they held
Sur reptitious meetings* Tne Inquisition
terr ori sed the d i s t r i c t in which they nad
dwelt so thoroughly that the very name of
Albigenses was pr act ica lly blotted out, anJ

JEANNE, D'ARC:
Jeanne d'Arc was born in the village
of Domremy, near Vaucouleurs, on tneborder
of Champagne and Lorraine, onjan. f, MI2.
She was taught to spin and sew, but not to
read and wr i te, these accomplishments being
unusual and unnecessary to people in her
station of li fe. W
er parents were devout,
and she was brougnt up piously. Her nature
was gentle, modest and religious; but with
no physical weaxness or morbidity; on the
contrary she was exceptionally strong, as
her later history shows. At or about tne
age of thirteen Jeanne began to e x p e r i e n c e
wnat psychology now calls ''auditory hal lu­
cinati ons. ' 1 In other words, she heard
"voices"—usually accompanied by a bright-
H ght—when no visible person was present.
This, of course, is a common sympton of
Impending mental disorder; but no insanity
developed in Jeanne d'Arc. Startled she
naturally was at f i r s t ; but continuation
led to familiarity and t r u s t . The voices
gave good counsel of a very commonplace
kind, as for Instance, that she "must be a
good girl and go often to church." Soon,
however, she began to nave visions; saw
St. Michael, St. Catherine, and 5t. Marga­
r e t ; was given instructions as to her mis­
sion; eventual*!y made her way to the Dauph in,
put herself at the nead of 6,000 men, and
advanced to tne r el i ef of Orleans, which
was surrounded by the victorious English.
After a fortnight of hard fighting, toe
siege was raised, and the enemy driven off

The tide of war had turned, and in three
months the Dauphin was crowned king at
Rhei ms as Charles the Seventh.
4t thi s point, .Jeanne f el t that her
mission was accomplished. But her wish to
return to her family was overruled by the
king and archbishop, and she took part in
further fighting against the a II ied English
and Burgundian forces, showing great bravery
and tactical s k i l l . But in November, M 30,
a desperate saI ly from Compiegne—whicn was
besieged by the Duke of Burgendy— she fell
into the enemy’s hands, was sold to tne
English, and thrown into a dungeon at their
headquarters in Rouen.
After a y e a r ’s imprisonment sne was
brought to t r i a l before the Rishop of Beau­
vais, in an ec cl esiasti cal court. The
charges were heresy and sorcery. Learned
doctors at the church, subtle lawyers, did
their best to entangle the simple girl in
their dialectical t o i l s ; but she showed a
remarkable power of keeping to her affirma­
tions and of avoidIng heretical statements,
"^od has a Iways been my Lord In all that I
have done," she said. But tne t r i a l was
only pretence, for her fate was already
decided. She was condemned to the stake.
To the end, she solemnly a f f 1rmed the reaI -
ity of her "voices” adding that her depo­
s it io n s were true. Her last word, as the
smoke and flame rolled round her, was'’Jes­
u s . ” Said an English soldier, awestruck by
172
¥
the manner of her passing: "W
e are tost;
we have burned a S a i n t ." The idea was cor­
roborated in popular opinion by events
which followed, for speedy death— as if by
Heaven’s anger--overtook her judges and ac­
cusers. Inspired by her example and claims
and helped by the dissension and weakening
on the side of the enemy, the French took
heart once more; and the English were all
but swept out of the country,
Jeanne's family rfas rewarded by en­
noblement, under the name of De Lys. Twen­
ty- fi ve years after her death, the Pope ac­
ceded to a p et i t i o n that the process by
which she was condemned should be re-exam­
ined. The result was that the judgment was
reversed, and her innocence established and
proclaimed. The li f e of the Maid supplies
a problem which orthodox science cannot
solve. She was a simple peasant g i r l , with
no ambitious bannering after a career. She
rebelled pathetically against ner mission.
" | had far rather rest and spin by m

e r ' s side, for this Is no work of my choosing

i t . She cannot be dismissedon the "simple
idiot" theory of Voltaire, for her genius
in war and her aptitude in repartee un­
doubted! yproved exceptionaI mental powers,
unschooled though she was in what we call
education. W
e cannot call her a mere hys­
t e r i c , for her health and strength were
superb. It is on record that a. man of sci-

ence said to an Abbe:— "Come to the Sal-
p e t r i e r e Hospital, and I will show you
twenty Jeannes d'Arc." To which the Atbe
responded: "Has one of them given us back
Alsace and Lorraine?" The r e t o r t was cer­
t a i n l y neat. S t i l l , though the Sa l p e t ri e re
hy s t er i cs have not won back Alsace and Lor­
raine, it is nevertheless true that many
great movements have sprung from fraud or
h al lu ci na ti o n. May it not have been so,
with Jeanne? She delivered France, and ner
importance in history is great; but may not
ner mission and ner doings have been tne
outcome of merely subjective nalIuc(nations,
induced by the brooding of her sp ecially
r e l i g i o u s and p a t r i o t i c mind on the woes
of her country? The army, being ignorant
and s«r a r s t i t i o u s , would rea dil y believe
in the supernatural nature of her mission,
and great energy and valour would r e s u l t —
for a man f i g h t s well when he fe e l s that
Providence is on his side.
This is the most usual kind of tneory
in explanation of the fa ct s. But it is not
f u l l y s a t i s f a c t o r y . How came i t —one may
ask— that th i s untutored peasant girl could
persuade not only the rude soldiery, but
also the Dauphin and the Court, of her Di­
vine appointment? How came she to ne given
tne command of an army? Surely a post of
such responsibiI ity and power would not be
given to an ignorant girl of eighteen, on
h e re ti ca l strength of her own claim to in-
s p i r a t ion.

is so strong that Mr. Andrew Lang called

these matters. Among other cur ious things,
Jeanne seems to nave repeated to Charles
