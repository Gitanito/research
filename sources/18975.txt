virginia this year
uh-huh okay good surviving this is good
to survive those snows i am so glad i
don&#39;t live in the north anymore yay
yeah
well welcome dr greer and welcome to
everyone who is joining us today for
this interview
um dr greer thank you for doing this and
thank you for doing this to let the
public know
about some upcoming events
and also about some
exciting breaking news
yeah it is well you know everybody needs
to uh
if they can join us the uh april 8th 9th
and 10th in scottsdale we&#39;re going to be
on a native american
uh
uh for a three-day weekend
and uh there&#39;s a link should be
underneath here um you can go to
siriusdisclosure.com and see that the
reason this is so important i&#39;ve been
wanting to do this since
close encounters of the fifth kind came
out and the ce5 contact app came out
to create a sense of community
where ce5 people on teams all over the
world could gather for a extended
weekend
and really network with each other um
you do a deeper uh educational
experience
uh and then every night friday night
saturday night
uh and sunday night we&#39;re gonna do the
meditation the ce5 contact protocols the
last night on sunday we&#39;re actually
going to go out
on the uh native american land
at a place that they&#39;ve
put aside for us
and we&#39;ll do that night event under the
stars the other two will just be indoors
because we can only get that spot for
one night but uh that&#39;ll be very
exciting uh now the good news about it
is that
it holds a fair number of people but not
everybody
so we just i just was handed something
that said that that nighttime event on
sunday
uh april 10th i believe it is
uh is about 50 people shy of being
filled up
so we can take more people in the
conference in the uh hotel
um ballroom than we can take outdoors
unfortunately so
uh if you want if you think you&#39;re going
to want to come in person to that event
on sunday night you probably want to
register pretty quickly
we just announced this a couple weeks
ago and i think
the site we thought would hold more and
we just found out yesterday
we had members of our team who are
organized in the conference go there in
person and found out it actually will
hold 200 people fewer than we thought um
therefore uh if you do want to be out
that night because this would be
exciting now if you can&#39;t come in person
we have a team that will be uh
webinaring it live so the entire weekend
uh friday night saturday sunday and then
sunday night out on the
native lands outside of scottsdale we&#39;re
going to have it webinared
and so what&#39;s great about that is that
each night and including the night out
on the stars if you&#39;re in some location
where you can&#39;t travel or come in you
can be there virtually
for the whole weekend or if you want
just that sunday night you can do either
so that&#39;s um there&#39;s a link at
siriusdisclosure.com for you to go and
uh if you want to register for that
then the re the really
the idea behind this is that
people want an opportunity not only to
experience this live together
but also if you&#39;re there in person you
can network
with all the other ce5 teams and people
from all over the world
and i think what&#39;s exciting about that
uh pat and uh
justice
are some team members in texas and some
other folks
on saturday morning and on sunday
morning are going to be doing
uh workshops on forming teams how people
organize them sort of the nuts and bolts
and then
on sunday we&#39;re going to do a in-depth
in the morning
whole
presentation on what i call
trans-dimensional photography and
videography
what does that mean so you look at the
videos and photos we have
those are highly interactive with
consciousness an interesting part of
this
is that the most amazing photos and
videos we&#39;ve gotten of actual e.t beans
in the field with us or nearby have been
sort of activated with consciousness but
also the person doing the videography or
photography
is very good at connecting to those of
beings and asking permission
and inviting them into
the frame because as we&#39;ve talked about
before
if you&#39;re new to this
interstellar civilizations
most of the time when they&#39;re in near
earth facility
vicinity or around the earth are shifted
beyond the speed of light and what some
would call another dimension but they
can pop in and out of 3d
but sometimes for a fraction of a second
often the human eye will miss it but the
new digital cameras if they&#39;re at the
right setting
it&#39;s very technical and i honestly i
don&#39;t do cameras i mean i&#39;m not
you know give me a
ventilator or a defibrillator i&#39;m fine
but um the people who do this are going
to be there
explaining what the settings should be
so you can learn
the expertise of how these images are
being captured
by people who actually know what they&#39;re
doing which excludes me by the way
i understand the principles behind it
but i&#39;m not a videographer or
photographer by any means so
and i credit everyone else who gets
these photos and videos i don&#39;t do that
i&#39;m busy kind of running the whole
program and doing the contact primarily
but that&#39;s going to be very important
for people to learn as sort of a
hands-on
workshops on saturday and sunday morning
and then the afternoons and evenings
we&#39;re going to be going deep into
consciousness the science of
consciousness
on sunday we&#39;re going to have a whole
afternoon session on what
the uh counterintelligence operations
are from the military and the
intelligence community and the things
that they can do
to confuse people during ce5 contact
and so it&#39;s going to be a very in-depth
uh weekend friday night saturday sunday
and it&#39;s going to be the the sort of the
crew the sort of the ps the resistance
is that last night out under the stars
but as i mentioned um there are about 50
spots left for that um and we just
recently announced that this is
unfortunate i was hoping we could get
more people on that site but the reality
is
it&#39;s going to be capped at about 450
people out there
um and we&#39;re bumping up against that
limit right now
um we&#39;re at about almost 400. so
uh i would encourage people to do that
and and it&#39;s going to be exciting
because what i&#39;m hoping we can do
i&#39;m going to ask some of our you know
big influencers um
who have you know 100 million
followers and whatnot that are
supporters of ce5 contact to also put
the link out so we can have a mass
contact medication that night
so however many people are out under the
stars
there could be you know a hundred times
that number or a thousand times that
number uh live meditating around the
world doing it which as everyone knows
from seeing close encounters of the
fifth kind
which by the way is up on amazon prime
and everywhere still
that has this huge effect
in consciousness where people all over
the world who don&#39;t even know you&#39;re
doing this meditation are affected in
the deepest part of the structure of
higher consciousness that everyone is
tied into
because the total number of minds in the
universe is one it&#39;s a singularity and
so when there&#39;s that many people doing
something with this intention
it not only affects
the cosmos and
facilitates
peaceful open contact with these
interstellar civilizations and ets but
it affects the planet
i mean the
baseline level of where all of
space-time matter and people are flexing
in and out of
this field of consciousness the pure
conscious field so that&#39;s why doing this
together is so important i&#39;m hoping we
can do you know
maybe two or three of these each year
the other important thing is that uh
right after that at the uh sort of two
days later
on april 12th until the 18th for six
nights
after this three-day conference we&#39;re
gonna we found a location it&#39;s only
about
15 20 minutes from the hotel where we&#39;re
doing the
uh weekend we&#39;re going to do an entire
week-long
uh expedition
now that&#39;s only going to be limited to
about 30 25 30 people
and for people to come to that we want
people to either come to a previous
week-long event or this conference or a
previous three-day conference
because we want to be sure that people
coming to that are very experienced
because it&#39;s a small group but i want to
train eventually
those are going to feed into
a program where we&#39;re going to
set up people who are
formal instructors of ce5 contact
something i&#39;ve never done that i know i
need to do
and
that&#39;s something i want to build that
base for that so these week-long events
are now going to be
people who are very experienced so
everyone will have been on a prior
week-long event or at least these
three-day intensives and that&#39;s going to
make for a much higher quality
experience
for a whole week in a small group out
under the stars and we&#39;ll be out in the
desert every night all six nights so
that&#39;ll begin tuesday night the 12th and
go all the way through the 18.
yeah those are very powerful um as you
know
lots of stuff happens on those i mean
tons
yeah it&#39;s unbelievable and we&#39;re going
to be in a remote site that we&#39;ve gotten
clearance to in a park that is
uh knowing and will have access to it
except our group so it&#39;s very
interesting and then during the day
we&#39;re going to be meeting in this huge
remote house adjacent to this park
um where we&#39;ll have afternoon sessions
uh with the 25 30 people who are there
so it&#39;s going to be really exciting for
those who can stay on after the
conference
so we just have yesterday um figured out
all the logistics on that and got them
all nailed down so that&#39;s why i&#39;m
announcing that the registration for
that has not gone out this is sort of a
preliminary announcement this is coming
but people may want to mark that and
it&#39;s it&#39;s over that through that easter
weekend
um this week-long event starts on
tuesday and goes all the way through to
that
easter weekend
um
and uh the three-day conference the
eighth ninth and tenth is the weekend
before easter
i hope everyone who can make it there
will
and uh if you can&#39;t be there in person
join us virtually that&#39;s how we build
this uh
morphogenic field effect as rupert
sheldrake talks about where enough
people uh begin to do something it
shifts
everyone in a positive direction and boy
do we need this planet to start shifting
in a positive direction yes we do yeah
those those things when you get a lot of
people like that in consciousness in
these higher moving into these higher
states of consciousness
it literally affects their consciousness
for a long time
and people&#39;s lives are changed
absolutely you find is that
people who do this with a group of
people they&#39;ve done these in studies
with meditators that if there&#39;s one
person meditating it has a certain
effect for themselves and perhaps the
environment and say at the field of
consciousness but when you have dozens
of people
or in the case of this conference for
this weekend hundreds of people doing it
it has an enormous effect
and this is you know back in the day was
called the maharishi effect where they
found that if you sent a certain number
it was one percent
of uh the population of a town and as
people who understood meditation higher
states of consciousness and they went in
and meditated that crime rates went down
er visits go down uh coherence goes up
and this is when the rest of the
community has no idea that those people
are in their town so there is a
well-documented effect on
social
behavior in a positive way and this is
where the power of meditation prayer
states higher states of consciousness
been very well documented in healing
studies also by the way that dr larry
dossie uh
documented in recovering the soul a book
about this sort of effect of
consciousness and meditative and prayer
states on healing but in our case we&#39;re
doing this to heal the planet
and
the body of humanity let&#39;s say
in developing a future where we become
interstellar
uh citizens and ambassadors to the
universe you know the whole ce5 contact
program is called ambassadors to the
universe where people
you know
empower themselves and that&#39;s what this
weekend and the subsequent weeks about
people empowering themselves to not just
be passive conference junkies
because that&#39;s just tedious
but actually
learn the skills and the knowledge
needed to be
a citizen ambassador from earth
to these other civilizations that are
waiting for that i mean i always tell
people that
they&#39;ve been knocking on our front door
back door side door
for uh decades now
since the uh
atomic bombs first went off
wanting to get an appropriate peaceful
response from humans
and they have not gotten that
not even to this day
and the ce5 contact initiative
when i found it in 1990 with the purpose
of it was this concept of
the everyday
man on the street woman on the street
uh
becoming a liaison from humanity to
these extraterrestrial civilizations
because the governments of the world
have badly dropped the ball on this
and it&#39;s been unfortunately because of
secrecy
been relegated to illegal covert
programs
that have made a complete mess of it so
this is where the responsibility for we
the people steps in not just for our own
planet with our own country
but
more importantly for the future of
humanity and its relationship with these
other stellar interstellar civilizations
and that time has really
uh come where where we can potentiate
this the technologies we have now with
uh the internet and
various social media platforms
and the ability to webinar events gives
us the
ability to really expand
the reach and organizational abilities
of a ce5
initiative
and the contact that&#39;s happening
i think all over the world that i&#39;m
hearing about from team members
is actually going up a lot
because i think there is this quickening
let&#39;s call it this awakening and deeper
consciousness
and knowledge is potentiating it
so that&#39;s really why we want to have
these in-depth conferences and then
followed on by these week-long
expeditions for people who&#39;ve been to
those
and to previous week-long events and
eventually
uh i hope we can uh begin to develop a
program
where people you know on a long training
period
become instructors
of ce5 contact
now what everyone can do is get the app
i mean if you&#39;re to doing this whether
you&#39;re coming in person or
privately come to
these experiences already
trying out how to do it through the ce5
contact app and
i think it&#39;s very important for people
um we we have you know hundreds of
thousands of people around the world
doing this millions uh actually
but the app teaches you how to do the
meditation the remote viewing how to set
up your team
if you really go through the app and it
thoroughly it it is
a complete instruction course uh but
it&#39;s an app it&#39;s not doing it in person
with other people which is why we want
to do this uh
with a larger conference uh so people
actually experience it live
i think it&#39;s much more powerful
when people gather together
and and do it but to prepare to do it on
your own get the app it people have
amazing contact experiences just using
the app we&#39;re hearing every day from
people who&#39;ve had this astonishing
experiences
yeah that um structure of the universe
meditation that&#39;s on that app
i mean people write in all the time and
mention this continuously it&#39;s what a
powerful meditation that is it&#39;s a
guided meditation and it&#39;s just amazing
plus we have all the tones all your
tones are on there
everything you need is in there you just
need a couple pieces of equipment and go
out
and you can play it you bluetooth it to
a portable speaker and
form a team um it&#39;s very powerful and
the more that people do it um the more
it uh signals let&#39;s say it conveys to
the ets that are watching this planet
uh with increasing concern as we
increasingly weaponize space
that there are people on the planet who
are enlightened or awake
are
peaceful
are not filled with superstitious ideas
about this issue
and are willing to put themselves out
there to make contact
uh
they&#39;re they&#39;re wanting us to do this
because who else is doing it state
department isn&#39;t the united nations
isn&#39;t
although we&#39;ve
recommended that they do so
i don&#39;t know of any leader around the
world that has a team set up
making any kind of intelligent
approach
and or any parliament or congress
so
in the absence of that my friends guess
what it&#39;s you and me people say who&#39;s
going to do this i say go look in the
mirror
you look in the mirror you want to see
who&#39;s who&#39;s responsible it&#39;s each and
every one of us and i think that&#39;s where
for a lot of people they go whoa you
know i&#39;m not i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m ready
for that i said well we need to be ready
because time is of the essence
really it&#39;s actually
you know to be ready for this you just
need to
uh you know
be conscious and
be in in a heart filled pure heart
filled you know feeling
it&#39;s very simple it&#39;s not difficult
people always think that this is very
complex
right
well you know this is why i loved it
when uh
dr targ is setting close encounters of
the fifth kind he says yeah you know
you know everyone&#39;s mystified this but
this is that goes back into ancient
ancient
the earliest recorded history of
humanity
that by virtue of being a conscious
awake sentient
being
every single human can do this
we&#39;ve sort of made it
the domain of the mystics and the gurus
and or the priesthood or what have you
uh and i think that&#39;s just frankly an
abuse of power
by people who want to aggrandize
themselves
uh frankly and i&#39;ve always said no i
mean if you&#39;re
a human being or an et
you&#39;re conscious and you can be aware of
that conscious field which is what the
meditative techniques facilitate
experiencing from there you can see any
place be anywhere no any discreet thing
uh we will get into this during the this
conference
in the ancient vedic concept of
rittanburg prague it&#39;s called this level
of consciousness that&#39;s very encoded in
the consciousness field where all
knowledge
all events
all specific needed information is
located it&#39;s like the ultimate cosmic
supercomputer
or ai but it&#39;s that field of
consciousness but there is a level of it
that you can tap into and a study just
came out that said that
15 seconds
in what&#39;s the psychologist called the
hypnagogic state where you&#39;re like you
know when you&#39;re going in into sleep
and you&#39;re just in that state between
awake awakened sleep
that 15 seconds in there
vastly increases people&#39;s creative
abilities and etc and so on now all the
remote viewing experts know that in that
state is when the best images
and and remote viewing uh and i&#39;ve said
this for years it&#39;s you&#39;re going deep
and you&#39;re you&#39;re not so focused like we
are now in in the normal waking
conscious state but you&#39;re not also in
the darkness of sleep it&#39;s that in
between deep state
now the meditative state can take you
there and keep you there but this study
found that 15 seconds
of experiencing that hypnagogic state
has this enormous increase
in the individual mind&#39;s capacity for
creative thinking problem solving all
kinds of virtues
an amazing study that just came out in
the last
couple of weeks
so i think this is the more we
understand the science of consciousness
and its benefits the more we&#39;re going to
be able to transform the planet because
i think that the root of the problem
is really deeply based in
true spiritual crisis not religious
and in the understanding of deep
consciousness higher states of
consciousness and deep spirituality what
i call
original spirituality it&#39;s universal as
opposed to the trappings of organized
religions and traditions
but um which have their place um
but i think that
we if we begin to look at this in a more
universal way
the universality of mind and
consciousness and heart
and being
sentient and awake
and then begin to realize that those
states of uh
meditative states and even when you&#39;re
going to sleep at night
uh beginning to enter into a lucid dream
that there are amazing capabilities that
are in that subtle
very quiet
aspect of mine
where entire dimensions and the universe
can open up to you and knowledge
it&#39;s the wellspring by the way of all
science and arts also that level of
consciousness is the point of
inspiration where people figure out have
inspiration where inventions are
discovered where art and beauty all of
that is in that aspect of consciousness
we&#39;re going to talk about this on this
long weekend together out in
arizona in april
yeah and you know we&#39;ve talked about
this before when people are working on
their consciousness and raising their
consciousness it alters completely how
they relate to other people which is
what is so
desperately needed
uh
on this planet for sure the people
animals i mean and the experiences i&#39;ve
had when you&#39;re in that state even wild
animals come up around you and
just meditate with you i mean i love
this story once we were up in england on
woodbury hill
in alton barnes and we were meditating
setting up to do the sanskrit
puja this ceremony that i do when i&#39;m
teaching the meditation and by the way
we&#39;re going to do that every night
friday night saturday night sunday night
um
and uh
we were doing this out in the middle of
this you know field and they&#39;re all
these giant
cattle
uh had to watch where you stepped but we
found a place to make our circle and do
this and we&#39;re setting up to do the puja
and we sit down and
i&#39;m the and the the cows are they so
hurt
you know some with the horns every come
over
and they all bow they all kneel down
and and lay down around us
and the entire time we&#39;re doing the
sanskrit ceremony and the meditation
and also the contact protocol remote
viewing they&#39;re literally there
meditating with us
and as soon as that&#39;s over and we start
talking again they get up and wander off
and start munching
the grass and we&#39;ve had this happen
quite a few times it&#39;s really beautiful
to see how nature and animals respond to
humans
in this state of peaceful higher
consciousness
we&#39;ve had that happen um
on a ranch in texas
yeah it&#39;s beautiful during this
breathing and moving and i said oh my
gosh what
is that
and we were thinking well what could it
be and we literally turned around and
shined a light on it and here are all
these cows
standing there just watching it was
really
they were like i don&#39;t know eight feet
away it was really amazing it&#39;s
beautiful
it is beautiful the other big breaking
news and this is uh we&#39;re this is a big
pivot
away from what we&#39;re just saying it&#39;s
the other end of the spectrum of what
we&#39;re working on
uh of course everyone knows since that
acknowledge came out about four years
ago there&#39;s been this huge
juggernaut um you know that film had
over 740 million people see it it&#39;s
still one of the top viewed uh films on
sites like amazon prime and
hulu and toby and what have you
when unity moved
to create unfortunately
a uh
counter narrative for disclosure
that had to do with it being a national
security threat
etc and so on and you know of course
people have heard me talk about that
uh
the good news is that
this message that the ufos are are real
that they&#39;re not fictitious it&#39;s been
confirmed by the pentagon what have you
even though that has happened within the
context
of it being spun by the spin meisters
out there
as a national security threat i mean
every article in the new york times cnn
fox
every media around the world the sunday
times of london have always included
that as the narrative we don&#39;t know what
they are that&#39;s a big lie go see the
cosmic hoax it&#39;s up there everywhere for
free to see
the documentary release in july
um and they&#39;re not ours another big lie
and they&#39;re a threat to the national
security so
unfortunately this is the information
that the members of congress that we&#39;ve
been reaching out to are getting
because the foxes guarding the hen house
from these unacknowledged special access
projects these secret projects
have their acolytes and their minions
in the staffers offices in the skiff the
secure communication
information facility where they get
brief the senators and congressmen get
information on this and every
single and this is without exception
because i know who they are
every single person in there
who are briefing the members of congress
and the president for that matter are
either misinformed or deliberately
disinforming
intentionally the members of congress
now this is an issue because in the last
few months
there are senators and congressmen
calling for a permanent office in the
congress to study this the pentagon has
just announced ahead of that that
they&#39;re opening up an office to study
what is now called the new
faith term of the month of uaps
thus replacing ufos that replaced flying
saucers is what they were used to be
called
back in the 50s and 60s so i think that
because of that
there is a huge momentum
of people we&#39;ve now identified about 15
members of the senate and house who are
actively interested in this but we&#39;ve
got to be able to reach them
on a sustained level
now back when we did this a little bit
of history for everyone
when i
in the 90s we were working the system
sort of
behind the scene and everyone knows this
story
project starlight the predecessor to
disclosure project
as an emergency doctor i was shuttling
up to dc and other places to brief
members of congress uh the president&#39;s
people the ci director what have you
and our hope then was that those people
having been
deeply briefed on the issue would do the
right thing they would they were scared
to touch this they were threatened
warned off waved off
now that these covert programs have
pulled the trigger and said oh it&#39;s okay
to study of this
and everyone can talk about it we&#39;re
going to normalize it through the media
because the big mainstream media take
their marching orders from these
operatives
that&#39;s absolutely true
then but you have to talk about it in
this in this certain way
a certain sort of spin it&#39;s a threat
what&#39;s the threat to the national
security
we don&#39;t know what they are we&#39;re going
to call them some made-up name
unexplained aerial phenomenon rubbish
they&#39;re not unexplained they&#39;re not just
ariel and it&#39;s not a phenomenon a
phenomenon is a bowlite or ball
lightning or something
and the other is it&#39;s this threat to the
national security the three big lies
that we outline in the cosmic hoax our
documentary
now
what i found is is that that persistent
talking point
isn&#39;t going away it&#39;s getting deepened
in the last month or two
senator gillibrand of new york has
called for an office being formed or
others uh on the other side of the aisle
senator marco rubio or republican
he was being mentored by the late
senator harry reid who just passed away
in the last couple of weeks from
nevada and i think that what i&#39;ve
observed from being on the inside of
this and having a place in d.c
is that
in order to get the access
persistently
we&#39;re going to have to do something
different
now in 2001 when we did the national
press club event
i tell this story
with trepidation somebody
who i knew very well
came up to me uh at the conference we
held the next day after the press
conference
and he said
how much money can you give these
members of congress and senators i said
what does that have to do with the price
in china he says
you have to you have to have influence
and you have to provide
money to their campaigns and you have to
set up events for them i said well we&#39;re
not set up to do that this is a you know
a non-profit we&#39;re just
he says
they&#39;re not going to listen
now i thought that was a terribly
ugly
ugly and cynical comment
and it was
but it also happens to be
terribly true
so today we have filed an organized
disclosure pac political action
committee nonpartisan
we&#39;re going to organize to support
people who are supporting real
disclosure and not alien invasion
disclosure
we&#39;re going to set up events where they
can be educated
and supported and that is being formed
i&#39;ve never done this we&#39;re going to see
how it applies we have a very
substantial group
in washington who will be facilitating
the logistics of this
so you will be hearing about this in the
coming days but this is going to be a
permanent fixture in washington
um and it&#39;s called disclosure pack pac
political action committee now not at
all partisan doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re
left right center independent
libertarian a socialist it doesn&#39;t
matter because what we&#39;re finding is and
i said this back in 1992 93 94 when we
got involved with the clinton white
house and what have you
this issue transcends all
shorelines politically it should never
be partisan and luckily the senators and
congressmen working the issue
currently even though they&#39;re being
misinformed
have said the same thing this is not a
left right this way goes way
over or transcends the normal fracture
lines left right what have you so that&#39;s
how this is going to be conducted it
will absolutely never be partisan so
those of you who are
partisan uh in your views on things
sorry to tell you
this is going to be completely
nonpartisan not bipartisan nonpartisan
but
the purpose of it is to formalize
a long-term educational effort
to not only educate but also encourage
through support
those members of the senate congress or
a candidate
who really wants to do proper disclosure
which involves
a true disclosure that doesn&#39;t
put
us into a conflict-oriented path
with these visitors
number two
discloses the technologies that are
being kept secret and are being told uh
to these members of congress that
they&#39;re unexplained when we have people
from locked
other aerospace companies that can go in
with me and show them where the man-made
ufos are being built which by the way no
member of the senate or house is briefed
on that
so we need to have a presence there
getting ahead of this tidal wave
of spin that has captured the disclosure
movement in washington and in the
mainstream media and we need to do it
now
i mean we&#39;re running out of time to do
it so that&#39;s what that&#39;s about
i&#39;m in washington almost every week um
but we need to have a structure around
us to legally do this so that&#39;s what
we&#39;re forming
so that is a very big announcement
probably the biggest announcement on
this issue in history
certainly more than the disclosure
project of 2001.
so that&#39;s something we we have to uh
do
quickly
and uh you will be hearing those of you
listening you&#39;ll sign up for we have a
free newsletter at
siriusdisclosure.com and you&#39;ll get
information that will be coming out
uh from us about this activity and how
you can support it and help
um you may know members of the congress
and want to have an event for them that
the disclosure pack can
fund host and then uh educate
these members of the the congress on
or it may be a governor it may not even
be someone in the us congress it could
be a governor the other objective of the
disclosure pack
political action committee
is to also
see that
the resources of the government that are
being wasted
on energy
and alternative energy research some of
that gets put into
the funding
and support
for open source zero point energy
so that we can get off of the fossil
fuels but also frankly windmills and
solar and everything i&#39;m i&#39;m looking at
one of the biggest solar farms in
virginia that&#39;s in my meadow which
unfortunately collapsed in our snow
copper lips we had a hood of heavy snow
collapsed it and we put it back up
but
those are very fickle systems very low
energy output it&#39;s very expensive
not practical to run 8 billion people
it&#39;s too little
too late if we had 200 years or even 50
years we do not
the bias as a civilization we can&#39;t so
that&#39;s another big objective of the
disclosure pack
and
the third is to encourage a diplomatic
governmental
initiative to make contact ce5
contact
but in a peaceful way
non-militarized and also to educate
these uh leaders
on the essential need to keep all
weapons out of space and the ones that
are up there need to be deactivated
because this is a huge looming problem
not only geopolitically around the world
because once everyone starts putting
weapons up there targeting each other
it&#39;s star wars right
but covertly we know
that these uh weaponized systems that
are up there satellites what have you
have been targeting
and
more often than we should ever have done
destroying extraterrestrial vehicles
very dangerous business so that&#39;s
something that i know members of
congress do not know
or even at the united nations i remember
when i was briefing the un secretary
general
and his wife up in the 90s
they turned white they were they they
said are you kidding i said no
this is going on it&#39;s very covert it&#39;s
very unacknowledged and it&#39;s extremely
dangerous
so these are things that need to be
talked about seriously what they&#39;re
really wanting to do what the media
which is your sort of front opera
for the intelligence community that&#39;s
doing this false disclosure of we don&#39;t
know what they are we don&#39;t have
anything that flies this way they&#39;re a
threat to our national security that&#39;s
the three mantras they keep reporting
the problem is is that that means that
our leaders are being completely
uh gaslit
and put in the wrong direction
because enough of them we&#39;re learning
about what we&#39;re doing they did it after
the disclosure project news conference
in 2001 and then they ramped it up again
after the
unacknowledged documentary went
absolutely viral globally
so this is a big problem and i think
that if we&#39;re going to
influence the outcome in a positive way
we&#39;re going to have to do um i hate to
say it we&#39;re going to have to play the
game that everyone plays in washington
uh which i think is is
you know you you almost have to put your
soul through a car wash and even
thinking about this
um however
living in the real world we live we have
to do the world we live in
not the world of our dreams we can
create the world of our dreams but right
now we have to live with the existences
and the realities of the current order
which is utterly corrupt
uh and
access in washington is too often
by who has the influence who can provide
the funding who can actually
so that&#39;s why you this is why there are
thousands of political action committees
this was one however that&#39;s a very
philanthropic one
that&#39;ll be about
disclosure peace and space
peace with our neighbors in space
and the bringing forth
of these illegally suppressed
technologies that would save the
biosphere and eliminate poverty in 15 to
20 years
so that&#39;s our objective with this so
that&#39;s the that&#39;s a big announcement
today
uh
and then there&#39;s one more big one
yep which actually
if you can get all these guys together
and they want to learn how to do ce5 and
you want to do this
this would be the perfect place to do it
yes it would be
so we have just uh acquired a
piece of
land
in uh virginia near hot springs virginia
where thomas jefferson would go to those
uh hot springs there and they&#39;re ancient
native american pools actually
and it&#39;s where the omni homestead is
this is the incredible area
and it&#39;s about an hour and a half um
from my country house here near the
university of virginia in
charlottesville but it&#39;s only about
three hours from washington but it&#39;s in
this enormous
wilderness area
um
there&#39;s
so we got 683 acres
uh that we just closed on a couple weeks
ago just before new year&#39;s
and
we&#39;re wanting to build a ce5 contact
research and retreat center
where
people from all over the world would
come there
because the 683 acres you visualize this
is surrounded by 1.8 million acres of
national forest permanently protected
national forest perfect um and it&#39;s only
about 10 minutes from the land
to the omni homestead which if you look
that up is an amazing resort and about
three minutes from
the jefferson thomas jefferson hot
springs and pools that are right there
and about 10 minutes from there there&#39;s
a 2500 acre lake
that is really all in the national
forest it&#39;s amazingly beautiful so we&#39;re
wanting to
build now of course
anybody out there have a large
construction company that can start on
this this spring or summer let me know
um but we want to build a retreat center
uh you know a modest you know not that
large maybe you know 18 to 20 room
bedrooms where we can have trainings
where we can have retreats
where we can have educational experience
and where ce5 teams can also
uh come
and and uh experience that on a very
private
large track of land
surrounded by pristine nature and stars
well when it&#39;s clear i mean on the east
coast
there aren&#39;t as many clear and sunny
days as there are in the desert but
still it&#39;s an amazingly beautiful spot
and we have already the plans for what
we want to do there
but i&#39;m just announcing this because
it&#39;s an exciting
uh
sort of next step in ce5 contact
training for their teams
and i hope also
where we can have a formal teacher
training program here where people
become really trained to do this so
that&#39;s something we&#39;re going to
uh start on i was wanting to get out
there in the last month or so
to see where we could actually clear
some of the land it&#39;s 100
densely forested you can visualize 683
acres surrounded by
almost two million acres of nothing but
forest i mean literally nothing but i
mean you can&#39;t even see where you&#39;re
going it&#39;s this dense forest
so um
it&#39;s and it&#39;s it&#39;s between 2200 feet and
3000 feet above sea level
um
it gets rather chilly there i have if
anyone knows how to do this give me a
call
i&#39;m wanting to create a translucent
bubble a sphere
that when it&#39;s uh rainy or if it&#39;s cold
we could be in this sphere
but still be outside doing ce5 contact
and be relatively warm and protected
so um it&#39;s something i&#39;d like to
construct as part of the contact site
so in inclement weather or even when
it&#39;s cold we could be in there
and there&#39;s a
like a sports venue you mean where they
have this thing that comes over the top
yeah
but translucent
like a bubble you know like a dome
uh like a translucently perfectly clear
dome you could sit in
so i have the designs for that i don&#39;t
know how to build one but somebody might
so i&#39;m putting this out there to a lot
of people just to say
if you know some a large medium to large
construction firm that can come in
i know no it&#39;s very hard to get anything
built right now because of the supply
chain and labor shortage but if somebody
has such an entity of course they&#39;d have
to relocate for about a year to build
this facility up in this remote area but
by the way the entire county
is more than 50 national forests it only
has 4 400 people so it&#39;s it&#39;s you know
it&#39;s uh
rural let&#39;s say the least
mostly wilderness but that&#39;s the perfect
place to do this and yet
you can fly in any number of airports
and be there within an hour or 45
minutes or even three hours from
washington
so i think that it&#39;ll be a really great
uh place to do this i&#39;ve always wanted
to
eventually have
a place where we can
train people and but also gather as a
ce5 community and have this experience
where it&#39;s dedicated you know we&#39;ve
always used rental houses and airbnbs or
been on
public lands where people can invade the
site and disrupt what we&#39;re doing this
would be a protected dedicated
place
which would correct all those security
problems but also it would create the
energy
this energy field you know it&#39;s like
what they talk about with
sacred places where you can go to a
place
and feel
the experiences that have happened there
that are very enlightened and positive
or if something terrible has happened
you can feel that or too it&#39;s embedded
in the akashic record the fabric
what the naval intelligence people call
the white noise of space-time
so when you but you can create this
amazing energy
on a site where this is being done
as the uh purpose of the land
and um i also when we start finding
where we want to clear the spots
for this
i&#39;m hoping we can do a um go there and
do a a
blessing of the land because i know this
is this is native
uh this part you know i&#39;m part of
cherokee i&#39;m 5 16 a little over a
quarter native american in this area
that area was very much um
a sacred area for native people because
you had the hot springs and the warm
springs there where they could gather
you know which of course uh tribal
peoples would always gather where
there&#39;s only water but also warm water
particularly in a cold climate so uh
it&#39;s it&#39;s a really amazing area but it
also has this interesting history with
the founders of the united states
going there
back in the day so it&#39;s an interesting
let&#39;s call it akashic record
history in this area that we just
we just sort of stumbled across um
and uh so that it&#39;s very exciting i hope
if there&#39;s anyone listening who actually
has um
know someone who could
put in a a a serious
construction operation there
we&#39;re not going to want to do this over
10 years we won&#39;t do it in 12 months and
it can be done i mean
if you were to build like four houses
let&#39;s say in a small development of four
properties
developers going to do that in a year
all the time we need someone who can
come in there and do that
right and it&#39;s really all these
intersecting lines are
are just amazing really
and it&#39;s enough land that eventually
there could be
prototypes of these new energy devices
there
there could be a skiff there if we
needed to
um it&#39;s
it&#39;s an area where you could have
all kinds of meetings
683 acres we could probably get enough
of the cleared because it&#39;s facing west
and south where you could also have a
big solar array until we get a free
energy device that would also um be able
to run a lot of the needs there so that
we&#39;re looking at this in a very
um
comprehensive way from the point of view
the energy of it consciousness of it the
uh ecology the deep spiritual ecology
um and and what have you right
could this be a place where you could
build a lab to work on the zpe or or no
you could have a satellite lab there yes
but i mean you know the one of the
problems with something that remote is
that nobody wants to live there full
full-time
i mean you know most people
most people
well i mean everyone wants to go to
their starbucks or their
nordstrom or they want to go shopping to
a
a grocery store or whole foods i mean
this whole county
only has forty four hundred people and
if you i don&#39;t even know you probably
have to drive an hour or two hours to
find a whole foods or fina you know so
i think a lot of people would would find
it uh
how do you say
kind of reclusive to be living there all
the time
um i mean
out where we live here we&#39;re about 20
minutes from the university of virginia
and people laugh about being out here
when we moved here our neighbor said
dare we use the r word and i said what&#39;s
the r word
reykluse because everyone out here are
these eccentric recluses
who are hiding you know so
it&#39;s really funny it&#39;s a joke in the
family with our kids but um but this
looks like a metropolitan area here
compared to that i mean that&#39;s
you know
we&#39;re talking really mostly wilderness
and the homestead resort now if you look
up on the internet at the omni homestead
resort interestingly they&#39;re about to
put i think 130 million dollars
into improving that area so there&#39;ll be
infrastructure there
um but honestly you know
i think most people would find living in
a community of that size and population
and amenities difficult so you could
certainly have a secure
facility there on that much land
surrounded by that much national forest
um for part of the operation for an
energy lab but i don&#39;t think the main
operation could be there i think a
satellite facility
when i looked that up uh and looked up
the omni which i hadn&#39;t i didn&#39;t know
that was there
that is an absolutely beautiful old
resort i mean i can see where they&#39;re
putting in a lot of they&#39;re putting
millions of dollars into this thing to
upgrade it but
what an absolutely beautiful property
that is really it is beautiful
and uh of course you know this land is
is kind of mountainous and
you know we have to figure out where you
can put these but also where we want our
contact sites
um so i&#39;m hoping ever since we got the
closed on the property it&#39;s been either
a foot of snow and another foot of snow
or
five degrees below zero or some we just
had the most insane
last you know three weeks of weather uh
four weeks but i&#39;m hoping you know soon
i&#39;ll be able to get out there to figure
out
where we can do it when i first saw the
land
it was in october and all the leaves
were out
so you couldn&#39;t see there was maybe one
spot where i could kind of see out
but to get a sense of the land uh you
know when you it&#39;s if you don&#39;t live on
the east coast you don&#39;t realize how
dense
the forests are here
these deciduous forests and uh this
almost all this land are
deciduous forests and giant rhododendron
and mountain laurel and stuff like that
so it&#39;s
it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not a jungle but it&#39;s
probably more like jungle than you would
think
right but you know you&#39;re good at going
into that and sensing the energy um i
remember when we were in tucson i mean
you were like yeah
turn there on that road and we were like
what
that road yeah down there is perfect i
was like
nobody even knew that site was even
there i mean it was amazing i&#39;m like how
do you think he knew that that&#39;s just
amazing so
yeah i think this this sounds like the
perfect place to do ce5
oh it&#39;d be amazing yeah it&#39;d just be
amazing so that&#39;s a that&#39;s an exciting
development in the last couple of weeks
so i wanted to do this uh that this
show to give people an idea of kind of
what we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re planning to
do
and sort of the the other
project
i survive
mission impossible should you accept
this
is that we really want to do
a
feature film this year
on what i call the lost century
so we need people to kind of begin to
think how they can help with that and
what is that about
the law century is what the term i
abused and sort of coined
for the idea that for the last 100 years
we have had
technologies from the time of tesla
i mean not the company but the real
nikola tesla
from his era to now
there have been thousands of
devices
thousands of electromagnetic generators
and motors that would have gotten us off
oil gas coal nuclear ended poverty in
the world created justice for all the
peoples of the world
and
completely transformed human
civilization
the fascist industrialists then and now
have ruthlessly kept that secret
now what this next feature film
documentary we want to do is pulling the
curtain back just on that
all the technologies not just the flying
things that lockheed thunk works has but
the technologies that would run your
house your car
without having 900 pounds of lithium ion
batteries to plug in and charge
by the way you know when you plug in
your electric car
where are you getting the energy from a
coal-fired and gas-fired mostly fossil
fuel power grid
it&#39;s not like it&#39;s coming out of the
ether
so
and and it&#39;s become such a big problem
that there are shortages of electricity
they&#39;re projecting with everyone
plugging in their cars
well tesla correctly called
this zero point or quantum vacuum field
of energy
the infinite energy field because it&#39;s
infinite
if you don&#39;t exhaust it
to run all the energy needs of
the united states
has been likened to by scientists of
taking a thimble of water out of the
great lakes
that&#39;s the density of energy now there
are national security implications if
this is used in a weapon system if it&#39;s
used in a missile system etc and so on
so there are there are
concerns
but if we don&#39;t
get this resolved we&#39;re never going to
fix the environmental problem the global
poverty problem
and so this next feature film
documentary is going to be a laser focus
on that for two hour film it&#39;s going to
show all the evidence
and the proof
and the science but also the vision
we need some really good cgi and motion
graphics people because i really want to
show people what does the world look
like
in 2030
2050 2100
2500 when society has met all of its
material needs
and at that point you have a sustainable
level one
civilization meaning that we&#39;re not
fighting
over land resources or what have you
we&#39;re peaceful
we&#39;re sustainable truly sustainable and
there&#39;s no poverty on the planet at that
point
humanity begins to turn
towards pursuits of higher states of
consciousness creative pursuits
it&#39;s a total change it&#39;s not just about
the material science it&#39;s a spiritual
social and physical transformation
of the earth and humanity and that is
how important these technologies are
i do think that in order to get
us to the point where people are
actually going to support a massive
retooling
of the industrial infrastructure never
mind the research and development of
these technologies which are non-trivial
i mean it&#39;s a serious engineering thing
to
do it
we have to educate a billion people
about it you know if we reach three
quarters of a billion people without
acknowledge we need we need to reach one
or two billion people with this because
we are in an emergency uh on this planet
it&#39;s deepening every day
and so that&#39;s something we want to put
into production and hopefully complete
in 2022.
so now that we&#39;re in january 2022 this
is sort of what we&#39;re wanting to give
people an idea what we&#39;ll be doing
we&#39;re gonna need help on a lot of fronts
obviously
um keep in mind we don&#39;t have a paid
staff or office
so
you know this is how you know
kind of real revolutions evolutions
happen
but that idea about the cgi too steve
because we&#39;ve talked about this
people have no ability to see that kind
of world they just don&#39;t right and so
when you talk about all these wonderful
wonderful things that could change their
lives they have no point of reference
for what that would look like so they&#39;re
like oh you know i&#39;m fine i&#39;m i&#39;m fine
here but if they see
what that world looks like
then
then you have we have a chance
well we also have to show not only the
the obvious first order changes
what do i mean by that
you&#39;re running your house on a a free
energy device quote unquote
the energy is coming from the fabric of
space-time a zero-point quantum vacuum
you have no power bill you have no oil
bill you have no gas bill
and you have no pollution associated
with it that&#39;s obvious
what&#39;s not obvious
most of the deforestation in the world
and
the rainforest
all over the world those are
disappearing because of poverty
by people cutting down trees that make
charcoal or wood to cook their food
right
that&#39;s
half the population of the world by the
way
is living like that half
almost i think it&#39;s something like three
billion people out of the seven and a
half or eight are
living on a subsistence level
so
the second order is that all that stops
because every little village and
community can have one of these devices
for a fraction of the aid being provided
by governments now to impoverished areas
that would give them refrigeration clean
water agriculture irrigation
power et cetera you want to chop down
the rainforest
here&#39;s another implication food
well
if you have energy that&#39;s non-polluting
and at no cost
you can grow oranges at the at the south
pole
in a dome
that is kept at a temperature and
humidity because the energy system
needed to do that
is free and non-polluting
right right uh it&#39;s like in the bible
and it says even the desert shall bloom
water
water in the atmosphere if you have i
know people who have at their homes
these condenser systems where they take
the humidity and create
tap water absolutely but they use a lot
of electricity oh yeah electricity
pollutes and the electricity is
expensive what happens when the when
energy becomes free of cost is coming
from a non-polluting source
think about it our entire civilization
transforms but see we need to show that
to people so that the people who are
wanting us to spend trillions of dollars
on solutions that won&#39;t get us there
understand let&#39;s take point zero zero
zero one percent of that and put it into
an open source
public interest
research and development effort
that&#39;s live stream blockchain protected
that gets out to the public with these
technologies with the magic formula the
circuitry
the plans the schematics all of it
and
that has to happen by there being a
groundswell of the public understanding
it&#39;s possible
just like disclosure couldn&#39;t happen
until we did a certain level of
education so people realized
that this is real and wasn&#39;t just some
fictitious
subject for science fiction advocates
and i think that&#39;s what we want to
achieve with the law century because we
need to actually step up that and that
would tell very well by the way with
disclosure
pack right the passion committee because
you know doing those two things together
would create this juggernaut
of change
uh so that&#39;s one of the uh synergistic
strategies we&#39;re putting together this
year yeah i think if people people
understand what that is and how that
works and they can see it
i think they would want it
well as the et told colonel corso it&#39;s a
new world if you can take it
right i suggest that we take it
we we we take it and create it
it&#39;s all sitting there the information
the novel everything is sitting there
but the people have to organize to make
it happen
uh
right we can&#39;t wait for the government
we need to educate them so they don&#39;t
one of the chief purposes of disclosure
pack is so that the leaders of this
country the most powerful military and
economic country in the world are not
diverted onto the war path
which is where they&#39;re headed right now
but we have to buy some time there
because that happens it&#39;s the end of the
world as we know it quite frankly
um you know the where where these uh
sociopaths are dragging
uh misinforming members of congress and
the president on this stuff
uh is
very very dangerous
uh it&#39;s the most dangerous thing
happening no one&#39;s talking about
so
we have to to intervene we need an
intervention there but we also need to
put together these technologies and the
educational foundation for people to get
their minds around the fact that
energy is embedded in the fabric of
space-time matter
at a level that can has been
stumbled upon and discovered all the way
back to the late 1800s but certainly by
the 19 teens 20s 30s with people like
nikola tesla and others
and so
people forget that in the late 1920s
uh
t towns and brown
and the german scientists
were doing high voltage systems with
things levitating
right levitation anti-gravity those were
in the physics journals in the late 20s
so we&#39;re going to show all this very
hardcore
mainstream scientific proof but then
we&#39;re going to pivot to how do we make
this happen because the headwinds here
are the 800 900 trillion dollars
in
financial instruments special interest
oil gas coal nuclear
and even
solar and wind
what have you so
these technologies definitely need to be
for the betterment of
of mankind rather than being constantly
weaponized
yeah the the only place they&#39;re
operational are in classified programs
and used for very bad purposes um so i
tell people it&#39;s the worst of all worlds
in a sense right now because the worst
applications
of these technologies because they&#39;ve
been sequestered
and used and unacknowledged special
access projects that are not overseen by
the president or the congress or anyone
else is
they&#39;re very dangerous how they&#39;re being
deployed
whereas the beneficial applications that
would save the biosphere eliminate
poverty etc and create a just and
peaceful planet are being withheld
so it is literally the worst of all
situations and by the way my friend the
extraterrestrial civilizations are
watching every bit of this they
certainly know this if i do and so keep
in mind that this is all part and parcel
i always tell people this symbol right
here
is the top one is
ce5 contact higher consciousness
universal peace the other one is
disclosure
and the truth coming out in a way that
the public understands it
and then the other is the technology the
free energy technology that would give
us a new physical civilization but with
it a new social
just civilization that can create the
foundation for enlightenment and an
enlightened civilization that&#39;s what
this is
and so that that&#39;s what
and anybody
any of these people who think that
they&#39;re doing this stuff
um
occult right hidden
yeah you&#39;re not they are being watched
uh
you cannot hide anything in
consciousness
nope absolutely not
uh which is another thing those of you
listening if you know someone who has
one of these devices
sitting in their garage or in their
laboratory
i&#39;ve seen a few of them
network them to us if they&#39;re not snake
oil salesmen i mean honestly
90 plus percent of all leads we&#39;ve had
on this have been
fraudulent enterprises or
mismeasurements of
the the power
dynamics of the system
uh
because people were amateurs and you
know once we got it drilled down on we
found it wasn&#39;t doing what they thought
it was but if someone actually has a
legitimate system
time the time of sitting on your hands
on this is well nigh over
uh and
we do have a team of people now
who could support if we could
in front of the people in our network
now we could get the financial and the
other support to move it out and
disclose it very quickly but it&#39;d have
to be disclosed
open source
and and that&#39;s something someone would
need to cooperate with
and uh
but that doesn&#39;t mean that they couldn&#39;t
be compensated they can&#39;t but it has to
be open source you cannot go through a
patent you can&#39;t keep the technology
secret
and if you don&#39;t have
half a billion to a billion people know
about it
when it the
when it&#39;s operational very quickly
it or you will disappear
so
there is a strategy for doing this it&#39;s
very well thought through
um we&#39;ve tried everything else over the
last 30 years
uh the other
conventional methods of bringing that
this technology to the public have
failed and the people most of them have
vanished with those failed strategies so
there is a strategy for doing this
uh but it cannot be secretive it cannot
be intellectual property it can&#39;t be a
secret sauce
gotta be open source like
github or some of these you know open
source software but in this case the
whole operating system or the energy
device and that&#39;s something that you do
didn&#39;t you say that that that those that
want to make money on it on the
secondary level well they can
well yeah phase two once the whole world
knows this is true and every physicist
and university are
you know building up iterations of that
sure i mean there would be
what we need i mean to all the greedy i
call them the dumb greedy people i mean
it&#39;s really stupid they think it&#39;s like
my precious you know what is that uh
gollum uh lord of the rings yeah you
know my precious my ring
wait a minute you got eight billion
people
you have a over a billion motor vehicles
spewing stuff you have all these people
with electricity in their houses
if you had a thousand companies the size
of apple or amazon
it&#39;s hardly enough
so i don&#39;t know why people get into this
zero-sum game thinking we&#39;re talking
about eight billion people
needing
yesterday like 50 or 100 years ago these
technologies to stand up that level of
financial industrial manufacturing
distribution
you don&#39;t need to be a rockefeller of
new energy to do this you don&#39;t want to
do it as one entity
but there would be i mean in people who
worry about money on this
the trillions that are being spent and
wasted on nonsense it&#39;s um
you know it&#39;s really sad they they&#39;re
thinking too small
way too small
so i think that the truth is
uh
it has to be put out in a way
that the cradle of its birth
isn&#39;t blown to smithereens and that&#39;s
why it needs to be quickly
all over the net blockchain protected
and open source
no patent no intellectual property
and frankly anyone listening that&#39;s the
only basis upon which i will cooperate
with someone because every other person
i&#39;ve tried to do this with
they&#39;ve either been threatened or many
of them are dead
so you know if you know it&#39;s not going
to work why do it you should only do
what&#39;s going to work right
okay well it&#39;s been a bit over an hour
about an hour and 11 minutes went a
little over an hour i wanted to do an
hour but i think we covered a lot we did
yeah and uh
pat thanks for everything you&#39;re an
angel and i hope to see everyone uh
either online or with us out in the
desert in april be a great fun it&#39;ll be
a lot of fun we&#39;ll have a great time
thank you
thank you for your time
thank you bye bye
you
