  		              		Experience Description   

    I gave birth to my daughter after a long labor. I lost a lot of blood fast, losing a total of 2.5 liters. I was rolled over to operation room, seeing darts of lights passing over my head. I remember I thought it looked like a scene in 2001 space odyssey. 

  In the operating room, they put me under general anesthesia. When I was unconscious, I floated out of my body and hovered above it up by the ceiling of the hospital. My mom, who was deceased, was floating beside me. I asked her, 'Is this was like being dead?' She answered, 'No, you're not dead yet honey.' And her words filled me with knowledge and purpose.  I knew that I was  not dead because I still had one job to do, and that was to take care of my new daughter. 

I woke up and did not even remember I had given birth, until later. The nurses said the anesthesia could give me hallucinations, but I have always chosen to believe I talked to my mom for a brief moment.
