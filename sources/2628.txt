Healing power is on inherent quality of
the organism.
The body, from its food, can manufacture
nil elements necessary for healing.
Pain is Natures warning of disturbance
of the balance of the body.
Natures methods: air, light, tempera­
ture, water, food, exercise, relaxation,
3leep, electricity, magnetism, mental
force and spiritual power.
True healing is the restoring of Natures
balance by one or more of these methods.
Many medicines are themselves causes of
disease - to attempt a cure by : tiding
to the cause is irrational.
Potatoes do not create fat.
Overeating often causes thinness - eat
moderately.
Overweight is caused by 3low metabolism;
proper combinations of chemical elements
will overcome this condition.
don't eat too fast.
Constipation is caused by lack of ele-
- 1 -
merits necessary for the formation of di­
gestive fluids.
Milk and acid fi'uits may be eaten if one
is in good health.
There are no two foods that are in them­
selves incompatible.
Human digestive apparatus is made to
work only on a small variety of food at
a time. When too great a variety is
eaten, the digestive juices are unable
to take care of the foods before they
begin to rot - result - gas and stomach
and intestinal trouble and toxic poison­
ing.
1. Use only a few kinds of food at a meal.
2. Eat moderately.

Vitamin A
Carbon 20 - Hydrogen 30 - Oxygen, is the
chemical formula of vitamin A.
- 2 -
Its absence slows growth, causes weak
eyes and bones, bad teeth, brain fatigue
and lowered resistance to infection and
bacterial disease.
Principal vitamin A foods:
Raw whole milk, butter, egg yolk, liver,
heart, fish, animal brains, cod liver
oil, red meats, spinach, lettuce, onions,
brussel3 3prout3, tomatoes, asparagus,
oranges, lemons, grapefruit, raisins and
fruit juices.
Vitamin B.
Chemical formula: - Carbon 12 - Hydrogen
18 - Nitrogen 4 - Osmium. Its absence
causes loss of appetite, upset stomach,
constipation, or the other extreme, brain
fatigue, beri beri, skin lesions and
pellagra.
Principal vitamin B foods:
Germ of seeds, whole wheat, brown rice,
eggs, yeast, peas, beans, lentils, as*
paragus, spinach, tomatoes, turnips, raw
cabbage, okra, bananas, cocoanut, or­
anges, lemons, grapefruit, grapes, rai­
sins, dates, figs, plums, prunes and
berries.
Vitamin C.
Chemical formula - Carbon 6 - Hydrogen 8 -
Oxygen 6, Its absence causes dwarfism,
fragility of bones, loose teeth and
scurvy.
- 3 -
Principal vitamin C foods:
Oranges, grapefruit, tomatoes, raw cab­
bage, carrots, celery, and dark berries.
Vitamin £
)
.
Chemical formula - Carbon 27 - Hydrogen-
42 - Oxygen,
It is the supervisor of calcium and
phosphorus concentration. Vitamin D is
formed from ergo sterol, found in the
skin and many foods. Irradiation with
sunlight or ultra-violet light trans­
mutes this compound to Vitamin D, It is
necessary as a preventative of rickets
and an activator of the parathyroid so­
lution. It should be used in quantities
fo? such diseases as rickets, neuritis
and arthritis.
Principal vitamin D foods:
Cod liver oil, butter, fats and wheat
flour.
Vitamin E.
Possible chemical formula: - Carbon 36 -
Hydrogen 64 - Oxygen 2.
Deficiency of vitamin E causes sterility
and possible paralysis.
Source: Yftieat germ, lettuce leaves, al­
falfa, egg yolk, beef muscle, beef liver,
field peas, raw peanuts and corn germ.
- 4 -
Vitamin G.
Chemical formula; Carbon 17 - Hydrogen
20 - Nitrogen 4 - Oxygen 6.
It is a division of B and is relatively
stable toward heat.
Lack of it results in stunted growth,
lethargy and skin lesions, similar to
pellagra. Heated foods may lose vitamin
B, but still retain G. it is found in
foods containing vitamin B.

m a s t e r c h e m i c a l s
- O X Y G E N -
Oxygen is heavier than air, is only
slightly soluble in water, is a poor
conductor of heat and electricity, and
supports combustion but does not burn.
It is present in all living things, be­
ing a constituent of the primary living
substance, protoplasm.
Deficiency in oxygen causes anemia, in­
fections, aches, pains, nervousness and
sterility.
Excess of oxygen causes obesity, fevers,
pyorrhea, poor circulation, kidney
troubles and heart trouble.
Principal oxygen foods are: Onions, to­
matoes, watery vegetables, alcohol,
spices, sugar, watery fruits, rhubarb,
- 5 -
radishes, fibrin foods, horseradish, wa­
termelon and egg yolk. Also all foods
containing vitamins. Oxygen constitutes
about 65% of the body.
- C A R B O N -
Carbon is the most abundant solid in the
body. It combines with calcium to form
carbonate of lime; it occurs in the
bones, and in combination with other
elements is found in the various organs.
Excess of carbon causes obesity, flabbi­
ness and sluggish mentality. It is a
contributing factor in pyorrhea, acido­
sis and hardening of the arteries.
It is necessary food for growing chil­
dren, but adults should eliminate it
from the diet as much as possible.
Overweight people should eliminate all
carbon foods from their diet.
Carbon foods are:
White bread, malted milk, macaroni, pol­
ished rice, tapioca, candy, cookies, ice
cream, puddings.
The best carbon foods are:
Whole wheat bread, whole rice, shredded
wheat, brown sugar, honey, baked potato,
rye bread, and figs.
- H Y D R ’
. O G E N -
Hydrogen promotes elimination, perspira-
- 6 -
tion, salivation, and circulation of the
blood. It carries off impurities and
soothes the nerves and tissues. It is
an aid in the function of the senses of
taste, smell and hearing. It prevents
inflarnation and pain.
Lack of hydrogen causes shrinking of the
body, premature age and poor circulation.
An excess of hydrogen causes clumsiness,
exzema, obesity and flabby skin.
- C H L O R I N E -
Chlorine, as found in foods is the ac­
tive disinfectant of the body. It pre­
vents intestinal infection and bacterial
fermentation. It makes the tissues
strong and elastic.
Lack of chlorine makes one subject to
the following diseases: Catarrah, rheu­
matism, asthma, arthritis, neuritis,
poor liver, and Bright's disease.
Excess of chlorine shows in a greenish
tinge of the skin. Excess dries up the
body, irritates the mucous membrane of
stomach and intestines, and interferes
with nutrition.
Those who have an excess of hydrogen in
the system and wish to reduce, should
eat chlorine food, but not drink much
water.
Chlorine and sodium combined, form 3alt
which is found in the blood.
Chlorine foods:
Goat milk, goat cheese, organic salt,
roquefort cheese, ham, dried beef, let­
tuce, salty f i 3 h , cocoanut, spinach,
radishes, cabbage, carrots,raw egg yold,
lentils, asparagus, and cucumbers.
- C A L C I U M -
Calcium is found in the bones and blood,
and without it there would be no skeletal
framework. It increases the life of the
cell and keeps them firm. Calcium builds
teeth and bones and gives firmness to
the arteries. Lack of calcium in the
blood brings about acid condition. The
parathyroid secretion keeps the calcium
in the blood in solution and prevents
arthritis. Lack of calcium is a factor
in pyorrhea.
Too much calcium should not be eaten
after forty as it accumulates in the
hardening walls of the arteries. Sodium
helps keep the calcium in solution and
prevents hardening of the arteries.
An expectant mother should have a diet
rich in calcium.
Calcium foods:
Oranges, lemons, limes, grapes, currants,
peaches, prunes, red cabbage, asparagus,
cauliflower, lettuce, endive, rhubarb,
spinach, onions, egg yolk, roquefort
cheese, swi3s cheese, buttermilk, and
goat milk.

- P O T A S S I U M -
Pota3sium is found in rocks, soil,
plants,in most foods, and in the tissues
of animals. When there is a large amount
of potassium in the tissues, there is a
greater quantity of oxygen, producing
greater oxygen activity, life and growth
in the tissues, with greater blood alka­
linity, a stronger system and more effi­
cient muscular equipment.
Potassium is very important. It i3 the
female chemical and is necessary for all
female trouble. Constipation and other
elimination troubles often arise from
lack of potassium.
Potassium foods stimulate activity, tis­
sue oxidation, gives energy to the heart,
lungs and muscles, and induces sleep.
It gives a reddish brown color to the
skin and helps to heal injuries quickly.
An excess of potassium causes one to be
physically aggressive while lack induces
the opposite reaction.
Potassium foods:
Cereals, spinach, carrots, butternuts,
peas, lentils, lettuce, oats, apples,
figs, blackberries, cocoanut, cress, en­
dive, potato skin, asparagus, olives,
whole wheat.

oxygen is necessary as oxygen i3 neces­
sary because ox;/gen attracts iron.
Foods containing chlorine, potassium,
sodium, iron, manganese, calcium, sili­
con, oxygen and iodine, should be eaten
for iron deficiency. Hydrogen, carbon,
sulphur, and nitrogen foods should be
omitted.
Iron foods:
Beets, lettuce, lentils, spinach, peas,
onions, asparagus, cucumbers, red cab­
bage, yellow corn, green beans, whole
rice, prunes, peaches, raisins, berries,
grapes, cherries, rye, rare beef, nuts,
and egg yolk.
- I O D I N E -
Iodine protects the brain and nervous
system from body toxins. It is needed
by the glands, especially the thyroid.
It assists assimilation of oxygen and
calcium. Deficiency causes shattered
nerves and goiter. Iodine neutralizes
the toxins of decomposition that enter
the blood stream from the intestines.
One cannot assimilate an excess of io­
dine .
Iodine foods:
Lobster, shrimp, crab, oysters, salmon,
cod liver oil,raw egg yolk, potato skin,
artichokes, mushrooms, tomatoes, peas,
grapes, strawberries, onions, pineapple,
pears, beets, and garlic.

Fluorine has much to do with the repair,
growth, construction, maintenance and
strength of bone. It forms the enamel
of the teeth. It prevents oxygen from
destroying bone and cartilage and pre­
serves youth.
Deficiency causes ulcers, anemia, vari­
cose veins and hemorroids. A heavy flu­
orine diet is recommended in cases of
syphilis, T.B., gland and vein enlarge­
ments, and skin diseases.
Fluorine foods; I
Egg yolk, water cress, cod liver oil,
brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower,
spinach, roquefort cheese, swiss cheese,
oats, goat milk, black bass, bluefish
and garlic.
- S I L I C O N -
Silicon is a pov/erful antiseptic, alka­
line in nature, next to oxygen the chief
elementary constituent of the earths
crust. Silicon gives hardness and polish
to the bones and teeth, and is needed
for the hair and nails. An abundance of
silicon prevents tumors and nervous ex­
haustion. Mental workers should eat
silicon foods. V'ithout silicon there is
no reproduction of animal life. Silicon
gives sexual vigor.
Silicon foods: *
Oats, apples, figs, cherries, strawber-

ries, egg yolk, peas, carrots, rice, cu­
cumbers, spinach, cabbage, asparagus,
gooseberries, nuts, onions and lettuce.
- M A N G A N E S E -
Manganese, though in minute quantities
in the body, is an important brain and
nerve food. It counteracts body acids
and septic ailments. It is an agent of
purification because of its germicidal
quality. It acts strongly on the uterine
lining through the nerves and acts on
the entire lining of the prostate giand
and ligaments of the sexual organs.
Dificiency of manganese causes confusion
of mind, incoherent speech and erratic
judgment. It is a valuable agent in
treatment of gout, neuritis, weak eyes
and drowsiness.
Manganese foods:
Egg yolk, beechnuts, almonds, walnuts,
chestnuts, peppermint, endive, water­
cress and parsley.
Zinc, osmium, arsenic, bromine, copper,
aluminum. These are found in the body
as traces. It is entirely possible that
every element is present in the body in
such amounts that 03 yet they have not
been detected.

Succulent vegetables are not classed
with the previous foods discussed, for
they do not contain a great amount of
any food element, but are rich in natur­
al salts necessary for chemical balance.
Concentrated proteins (meat, fish, eggs,
nuts) combine well with cooked succulent
vegetables and raw salad vegetables.
Concentrated proteins combine well with
raw juicy fruits. Concentrated proteins
do not combine well with potatoes, milk,
or cheese as it gives too much protein.
Concentrated proteins do not combine
well with each other.
Fats combine with any other food.

hood of tho ’

.Lite Temple, has recently
written a startling prophecy about the
future events of America and the destiny
of the 7/orld. This attractive 40-r-vu;
book is chock-full of astounding infor­
mation concerning the rise and fail of
the nations of the world and the eventu­
al destiny of the American people. It is
a book every red blooded American must
read if he expects to understand the
present world events and the resulting
conditions which will evolve from the
ashes of this spreading conflagration.

Law of Cause and Effect and drawn from
the Sources of undeniable truth.

set on this ‘
work because of its vital
message to American citizens.
