My husband took me to hospital. Until then I was relatively conscious. I was taken to the operating theatre, where I only remember hearing 'She has no pulse, no pressure, we're losing her.' I didn't think this could be about me, as I was ascending a tunnel with a wonderful golden light at the end. I felt extraordinarily happy and a feeling of unforgettable well-being. I don't know when I came to again. What intrigues me is that after a month or two, already completely restored to health, I sometimes saw a young man (40, more or less) in my house, looking at me. I never saw his face, and he neither said anything nor made any movement. This happened on and off for about 5 months.

Now, for the last couple of days, I have dreamed about this person in my sleep, helping me in dangerous situations, holding me tight. I even feel his arm assisting me.
