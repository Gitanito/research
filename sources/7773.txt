  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in the cardiac recovery room after having a stint put into one of my arteries.  I was supposed to have bypass surgery but because of damage done to my lungs during cancer radiation, the doctors believed putting me on a heart/lung machine was very risky.  They decided to put in a stint to reduce chances of heart problems until my lungs could heal.  About an hour after the procedure, I was setting in the recovery room talking to one of my relatives when suddenly, I couldn't breathe  in or out.   I forced air out from my stomach, allowing me to say, 'I need Help.'  I noticed that my daughter-in-law could tell that I was under duress and headed for the nurse's station to get me help. 

   It was at this point, my eyesight  appeared to be a gradual darkening of the area around me.  I was a little confused at first, but then I tried to look around.  I don't remember feeling any sense of movement but I knew that I couldn't see anything but total darkness.  I also couldn't hear any sounds.  hearing any sounds.  Before this happened, the area I was in was full of hospital sounds and talking.
  
  I looked around some more and was astounded by how dark and quite the area  was.  I felt like I wanted to move but could feel no sensation of arms, legs or body.  I then realized that I wasn't feeling any pain.  I felt as if my whole body had been healed.  Before this I had problem with pain in my legs, my lungs, and my left hip.  At this time, I suddenly got the impression that the reason I wasn't feeling anything bad was because I was dead.  I began to feel a great peace take over my mind and I thought I was laughing.  
  
  I was familiar with near death experience information and knew that the next thing I should experience would be the light.  Once again, I felt that I was trying to look around but couldn't find any sign of a light.  I was trying to scream, 'Where's the Light?'  when I heard one of the Male nurses calling my name.  I opened my eyes long enough to see several Doctors and Nurses around me.  I was breathing through some kind of face mask.
  
  I closed my eyes and must have fallen asleep; I don't remember anything else until about an hour later when my son and his wife were standing at the foot of the bed in my room.  One of the Doctors was telling them that I was fine and they would be giving me something to let me sleep.  I was released a couple of days later.  I didn't ask anyone about what had happen and nobody said anything about the incident.  I was ready to go home so I let it drop.  It wasn't until later that I thought back to the moment and remembered what had happened.
