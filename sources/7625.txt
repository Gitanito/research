  		              		Experience Description   

    I died twice the night I had the heart attack. I feel sorry for anyone who says there is no GOD. When I died, I entered into heaven. I couldn't take my eyes off of what I saw. Angels had me underneath each arm, one on my left and one on my right arm. I was aware of their presence, but I couldn't take my eyes off of what was in front of me. What I saw was  like flying a plane into a very rural airport. It was like when you see a light way out in front of you and it gets bigger and brighter the closer you get to it. I believe this is the light at the end of the tunnel effect we hear so much about. 
  
  I saw a wall of the whitest of white clouds with a light emanating from them. I KNEW what was behind those clouds and I KNEW what the source of that light was, I KNEW it was Jesus! I saw Jesus riding the prettiest white horse I have ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off of HIM. HE was riding very fast from my right to my left. We were travelling sideways and toward HIM at the same time. We got closer and HE looked over at us,  held out HIS left hand, and said 'It is not your time.' 

  Instantly, we were travelling backwards at what seemed to be light speed. I remember spiraling back down through the roof of the building. It was strange. Then as I passed through the ceiling tiles and looked down. I saw my body.

   When the heart attack struck, I was at work. I had just come back into the building from the main office. My cell phone battery was dead. I got up from my desk and walked maybe 6 or 7 feet to plug in my phone to charge the battery. I made it back to the side of my desk, then I had the heart attack. I stumbled to my chair and thought that I need to get my feet elevated. So, I put my feet up on the desk and reclined the office chair. No one else was in the building.

   When I came back through the ceiling that is the scene that I saw. My lifeless body was still there just as I left it when I was taken from my body. I slowly floated downward. When I got to the point where I thought I was going to kiss myself, I rolled over and just laid back into my body. I remember taking that first breath and how badly it hurt.

   I don't know how long I was there until I died again. It was almost a carbon copy of the first experience. We were traveling through space at an amazing speed. The only way I know to explain it is like in the movies  Star Wars or Star Trek when they go REALLY fast. The stars look like lines zipping past. The only thing different from the first time was when Jesus held out His hand. This time He said, 'I told you that your time is not yet come.' I felt like I was in trouble for coming back so soon. It wasn't a threatening feeling or anything like that. It was  a feeling of having to be told something a second time. When I came back through the ceiling the second time and saw my body, I braced myself. I knew the pain I was in for. I still had a euphoric feeling of amazement at what had just happened to me, but I knew what I was in for when I entered my body again. GOD let me know everything was going to be all right. There was a peace that came over me like nothing on this earth could ever imagine. I KNEW everything was going to be all right. 

   While this was going on my wife, who was at home 35 miles away, had no idea what was happening. But something told her to get down on her knees and pray for me like she had never prayed for me before. After she did this, she called my work because she knew something was wrong. I answered the phone and she didn't recognize my voice. I was very weak and in a lot of pain. She asked me what was wrong. I simply told her I didn't feel good. I finished my shift and then went to the doctor. They ran tests on me and told me I had a heart attack. They did heart surgery and I came through it okay. If it weren't for GOD's mercy and grace, I wouldn't be here today.   					  

    

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 2/27/12  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.    Heart attack       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I  saw my work place from above as I floated gently back through the roof and ceiling and back into my body.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it.  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   There was ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE when I was out of my body. I am surer of what I saw there than I am sure I am sitting here writing this. You KNOW you are home there and you KNOW everything is as it should be.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When I saw Jesus. I don't remember going up through the ceiling or leaving my body. My first recollections are when we were in what I can only refer to as outer space, just before traveling REALLY, REALLY FAST! I don't remember much about the trips coming back. I remember going backwards really fast after being told it wasn't my time yet. But after that, the next thing I remember is floating down, gently spiraling high above the facility.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I had no sense of time.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       High definition doesn't even begin to describe the clarity in which I was able to see. I had PRK surgery done on both eyes. PRK is the predecessor to LASIK. Due to damage from small pieces of steel being drilled out of my eyes, my eyes could not  be corrected back to 20/20. Yet I saw as if I had ultra 4k definition vision. The highest tech 4k ultra HD TV can't hold a candle to the way I was able to see there.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I have high frequency hearing loss, but didn't notice any difference in my hearing.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     What I saw was like flying a plane into a very rural airport. It is like when you see a light way out in front of you and it gets bigger and brighter the closer you get to it. It gave the appearance of coming out of a tunnel. I believe this is the light at the end of the tunnel effect we hear so much about.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   It was the light from the wall of clouds I described earlier. It was the 'light at the end of the tunnel'  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     When we broke through the clouds, we entered the most beautiful green field after travelling through space.  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?        I felt love, certainty, euphoric, amazement, and a sense that I was HOME. I also felt  a sense that everything was right as rain and that everything was as it should be. I felt a peace that was like no other.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       No  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     Instant and ABSOLUTE knowledge. Before you could finish thinking of a question you knew the answer immediately. And it was the absolute correct answer. There were no 'well I guess this.' It was absolute truth. There was no second guessing!  I KNEW.
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will

Now how much time have they spent researching where they will spend all eternity?
