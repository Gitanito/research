  		              		Experience Description   

  I was going through a depression due to the events in my life. I tried to help myself by engaging myself in parties, get togethers, and even travelling. But everything seemed to be just temporary. I was happy for the moment, but later would return  back to my depression. Every night I use to pray and cry bitterly for help, as I felt that my mind had stopped working and there is no sense of living my life. I didn't even knew what to pray for. I would just go to church or sit at home seeking help from the Almighty and just cry. I wanted to help myself but I was helpless. I was continuously seeking for someone who could pull me out, but I felt that no one could understand this condition of mine and would not  believe me. Days and months passed by and I continued surviving.
  
  One  day I got a interview call from a company situated in Gurgaon (India). I was living in Bhopal at the time. I thought that relocating myself to a new place with a new job can be the perfect way of getting out of depression. I booked my tickets and reached Delhi. 
  
  The next morning was my interview. I woke up with the expectation of a new life ahead. I booked my cab and reached Gurgaon. I asked the cab-driver to drop me near to the company where my interview was scheduled. Thanking him I got down from the cab. It was 8:30 a.m. and my interview was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. I arrived early, so stayed outside the building. I wanted to get some coffee, but didn't see a coffee shop nearby. However, I could see a mall  on the other side of the highway. As it was early morning and the highway was clear, I crossed the road. The mall was  closed. I had no option left. I needed to get back to the company, so I chose to cross the highway again. Before crossing the road, I clearly remember that I promised myself to leave my past life in Bhopal to begin a fresh new life after taking this job. I will not look back at people who didn't loved me. With this thought while crossing the highway, a vehicle hit me. 

  I went unconscious while I bounced off the windshield and onto the road. Although I was unconscious during the entire process, the driver told me what happened to me after my treatment. As I fell on the road, the other vehicle dove over me and I got stuck under the tire. My head was injured and bleeding, my shoulder was fractured, and the left leg was completely smashed. The driver of the vehicle managed to take my body out of the tire. He had great difficulty trying to get my body into his car so that he could take me to the hospital. 
  
     As he was driving me to the hospital, I opened my eyes for some seconds and saw the car.  I was completely painless. I again fell unconscious and saw the entire process which as it was going to happen now. Some unknown voice told me, 'You knew all this is going to happen and you still chose to come here.'

  The next time I opened my eyes, I was in the hospital. The driver was pleading to the doctor to save me somehow. At that moment, I felt enormous pain for the first time after the accident and started screaming. Although the treatment was a long procedure, the experience I had on my way to the hospital can't be explained in words. 

  I don't know if this was a NDE but surely unnatural.
