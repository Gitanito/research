and do it well yeah it doesn&#39;t matter
what kind of evidence you put together
or even signals we get or images the
subject again gets debunked but the
other thing about the SETI project it
like says szostak and people they are
carrying water for someone because
you&#39;re either a blithering you&#39;re either
stupid or you&#39;re corrupt there&#39;s two
things to choose from here if you&#39;ve
really dug into this and you&#39;re at that
level at NASA or the SETI project and I
debated assess szostak on Voice of
America about this I had my military
witnesses at Judge John Callahan who had
all the radar tapes and we basically
cleaned his clock but it&#39;s at a certain
point I said you cannot look at all this
dispositive evidence and proof and
information and just dismiss it while
you sit there and spend hundreds of
millions of dollars saying you&#39;re
listening from a signal from outer space
which by the way they&#39;ve already
received and been covered up now I&#39;m
going to say something here because this
is enough years after it happened a few
years ago there was a show called coast
to coast with art bell and it was on the
cover of Time magazine and I was one of
his favorite guests and when I&#39;d be on
that show it really lit things up at
certain agencies and one time I was on
his show and a few years back towards
the end of his career there and this
issue came up and I said well you know I
have a source high up in SETI that
confirms to me that they in fact have
received an interplanetary signals but
in a kind of phased not normal array it
was kind of a pulsed array and that it
was kept
crit and covered up and the city people
are furious subsequently Seth szostak
got on the show and just said well dr.
Bruno he&#39;s talking about he probably
talked to some volunteer or computer
operator because we have all this
network of volunteers what art bell
didn&#39;t know and what sis szostak didn&#39;t
know which I&#39;m going to say now because
it&#39;s enough water gone under the bridge
is that the guy who&#39;s told me that was
the founder of the city project and a
Drake Equation dr. Drake he told me that
that they had had that contact moreover
a man who had been one of Carl Sagan&#39;s
best friends with best man at his
wedding confirmed it and he had been
present when the WoW signal came in at
Harvard so you know is very frustrating
for me because you know these these are
people who one of them was an astronomer
who was actually at the Georgetown
Westin Hotel in 1997 we were doing
briefings for Congress but his presence
there resulted in him being contact
cause he used to be the editor of sky
and telescope magazine and astronomy
magazine and had worked with Carl Sagan
all these people and he said he
contacted my wife and me after that he
says you know I&#39;ve been told that if I
don&#39;t back off of this I will never have
a working position again and I got kids
in college so he wonderful man wished us
all the best and left so that&#39;s how it
works and you know I mean I gave up my
medical career I mean people say oh my
god you know I say I gave up five
hundred and some thousand dollars a year
to be doing this for nada but most
people who are in a situation like that
who&#39;s an academic and what-have-you
unless they&#39;re independently wealthy
they really can&#39;t turn to the people who
are hiring them as an editor or a
professor and say bug off
and so this this brilliant scientist who
had all this information who started to
come out he never went public but he at
the meeting with the members of Congress
and these other initial witnesses we had
in 97 when I was still trying to get the
White House in Congress to do disclosure
so I wouldn&#39;t have to do it in 2001
right before 9/11 those he was at that
meeting but even being kind of out on
this subject that much caused him to be
contacted and be told don&#39;t stop it or
your career is over and he was it was
made very clear to him you will never
work again no one will hire you so you
know there are a lot of people like that
and so there is this it&#39;s not so much
some sort of Illuminati it&#39;s this
this oppressive condemnation of the
subject along with abuse of power you
know I mean it&#39;s quite illegal for the
CIA to be infiltrating an alleged
independent Air Force investigation at
the University of Colorado and put
someone on their payroll to prejudice
the jury and kill the report on this
subject in 1969 whenever that happened
when the CIA is barred from having any
domestic activities I mean this is
illegal go read the law and it&#39;s also
however why I&#39;ve told people this is why
everything we&#39;re doing is legal very
different from say Edward Snowden who
was disclosing information that the
president knew about and certain members
of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence knew about and the House
Intelligence Committee knew about the
stuff I&#39;m disclosing are things that the
president has being lied to the head of
intelligence Joint Staff who i briefed
admiral wilson who&#39;s lied to the head of
the defense intelligence agency was lied
to a sitting CIA director was lied to
chairman of key committees that i met
with senators and house were lied to
i can prove that in a court of law a
priori those projects are illegal and I
have declared them raw
illegal and therefore they cannot touch
us and that&#39;s the difference all I want
to make this a very clear point there&#39;s
a big difference between disclosing
something that&#39;s being kept secret even
if it&#39;s wrong I&#39;m not saying that what
Snowden disclosed was right or wrong he
probably did a service in the in the in
the long run but but that was being
overseen by the appropriate governmental
elected and appointed officials and
something like this that has no
constitutional oversight and is a
complete criminal operation and rogue
that and this is why you know Danny
Sheehan who worked with me right before
disclosure project he and I discussed
this he&#39;s a constitutional attorney who
did the Silkwood case and the Pentagon
Papers represent the New York Times and
and he said look you know given the
people you&#39;ve met with and the fact that
they&#39;ve been denied access who are at
the top of the heap not only in the
United States with people like that I&#39;ve
met and with in Great Britain France
other places where they&#39;re completely
being left out that is prima facie
evidence of an illegal operation and
therefore if it&#39;s an illegal operation
if they can&#39;t cite the rule of law to
protect themselves which is why our
position was in the late 90s early 2000s
anyone with documents information
whatever about this you can come forward
with without any penalty of violating
your national security oath now saying
it and having people do because they&#39;re
afraid you know people have been
threatened with death people been but we
did get enough people to come forward
because we had a critical mass you know
I didn&#39;t come forward with one or two I
came forward with dozens all at once so
that was that was the the power of unity
and the power of doing it we really need
to have another wave of that happen from
people who are currently in government
and not just retired people but the
closer someone is to central operations
at Lockheed skunkworks or the agency or
the NSA who know about this and the
closer in time they&#39;re related to it the
more afraid they are of Tweep terminate
with extreme prejudice which
the euphemism for what this guy&#39;s the
CIA has told me they call it wet works
wet meaning blood a wet works tweet so
yeah nice well welcome to my world I
live and breathe and that&#39;s why a lot of
these people are very afraid if they&#39;re
really currently in current operations
it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t understand the
legal principle I just articulated in
other countries is it&#39;s a minor version
of the same thing so say in France you
have friendly people just like there are
here very interested in actually trying
to do something but then there&#39;ll be
others who are in a compartmented
operation tied in to this international
group that maintains secrecy and at a
certain point they will be threatened
and that&#39;s what happened we started we
actually had I was contacted by these
people in France and said you know an
official in the United States contacted
the Ambassador from France United States
and said what the hell or you think
you&#39;re doing
after I got this document from the
Ministry of Defense and this big outline
of all the studies they wanted to do at
posts contact biological technological
the whole business amazing document I
have and Isis is a girl you&#39;re here what
little hair I have left would be curled
but when I read it I went wow I can&#39;t
believe I got this from of sitting
government but they got contacted and
and basically they came to some kind of
a truce where they said well you can do
this with dr. Greer so long as you stay
on French soil do not try to do it
anywhere else
they said fine fine fine so that&#39;s why
we did it there
you
