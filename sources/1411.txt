    Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Estes Back to Nature / Estes Back to Nature Magazine.
 A Journal of Reflections that Mirror the Relationship between "Nature"which is God’s Expression and Man Who Is God’s Creation.
 Other titles: Back to Nature Magazine
 1927—1932?  Monthly, bi-monthly
 Hollywood, CA (editorial offices in New York City).  Publisher: Back to Nature Corporation.
  Editor: St. Louis A. Estes.
  1/1, May 1927.  Lasted at least until October 1932.

  Estes (1877-1951) called himself a doctor (he had a dental license from Illinois from the turn of the century) and promoted himself as the "Discoverer of Brain Breathing and Dynamic Breath Controls for Disease Prevention and Life Extension, Father and Founder of the Raw Food Movement, and International Authority on Old Age and Raw Foods."  His ideas and this journal combine general New Thought (”The Depression is a state of mind”) with advocacy of exercise and raw foods.  Estes was a crank who managed to survive repeated marriages, 15 children, being jailed for practicing medicine without a license, and bankruptcies for failing to pay his bills.  Among other enterprises he offered lessons, sold "W.H.Y"(his All-in-One Food Beverage -- It’s a California Product!”) and "Natural Beauty Builders," and ran a Hollywood Health Food Shop with a "complete line of Back-to-Nature Food Produces and Cosmetics.”
