  		              		Experience Description   

  Although, I don't remember the exact date of my NDE,  I remember that I was 21, and I had a 1-1/2 year old little boy. I am currently 30 years old. After all these years, I have a second boy who is now six years old, while the first one is 10.  Now,  I finally have the nerve to talk about my NDE. 

  It was a party at night and I just wanted to have fun and unwind. I was with friends who smoked cannabis joints. I had never smoked this in my life. I wanted to try it and join in their state of delirium. So I smoked a joint of “amnesia” after drinking half a bottle of whiskey. Except, having never smoked before, I had a bad trip. I didn't feel well. I was sweating along with feeling nausea. Out of pride, I dared not tell the friends who were present that I was not feeling well. So I got up to go to the bathroom.  I got to the hallway and  closed the door behind me.  I started to feel my vision blurring, and I was stumbling while walking.  I suddenly fell down. I felt absolutely no pain. 

  Just then, I started to see a dark tunnel with an ultra bright, white and scintillating light at the end.  I was attracted by the light and therefore decided to get closer to it.  Once I arrived in the light, my maternal grandfather who had died when I was 13, welcomed me with open arms.  I was happy to finally be able to see him again. We started talking, and he told me that I had just  fainted, but that I must not worry and that everything was going to be fine. We went over my life  until that day, in a loop format. Then, I saw my paternal grandmother who had died when I was 16.  I asked my grandfather why my grandmother was in the dark. He  told me to  not  look at the dark to always fix the light. He said to me, 'Grandma is in the dark because she left with a heavy secret that was never revealed.' He revealed it to me and told me to use the knowledge wisely. We were not solid, we were like a luminous, shimmering vapor. It felt truly an unconditional love, incomparable to anything down here on earth.  
  
  I also remember that there was a golden line that I wanted to cross.  My grandfather shouted at me to 'Stop! If you cross that line, there is no turning back. But if you don't cross it, you may still be able to choose to return to your body. Look at you.'  I turned around and saw myself in the hall, lying on the ground where I had fallen. My friends were  top of me, trying to revive me. I could  feel their  stress.  I tried to ask them to stop, to tell them that I was fine, and that I was quite well. But of course, no one could hear me. My grandfather said, 'You still have a lot to accomplish here on earth and your earthly mission is not over. The time has not yet come to join me.'  He added, 'You have 1-1/2 half year old son, who needs you.'   I asked, 'How do you know that, since you  died when I was 13 years old?' He replied, 'From  up here, we know everything and see everything!' We both  said to each other, 'See you soon.' 

  I returned to my physical body, as if I were diving from the four-meter high diving board of a swimming pool.    Once my soul had returned to its place in my body, I woke up with friends above me who were more than panicked.  I had trouble breathing and  couldn't speak. They had to take me outside and pour cold water on my face. It took  10 minutes before I could sober up. I  still felt sick, but after the 10 minutes, I remembered in detail the magnificent experience I had just had. I didn't dare share it right away. I was afraid that  would not be believed and called crazy. Although, I knew what had just happened to me. Since then, my intuition is extremely developped and I often enjoy astral outings outside of my body. Death no longer scares me, because I am now convinced that there is another kind of afterlife after the death of our physical body.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     The tunnel was dark. At the end of the tunnel, a sparkling light attracted me like a magnet.

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control.     There were a few episodes of my life that replayed in a loop at that point. It was  displaying all the good deeds I had undertaken up to that experience. But I can no longer describe which ones in a few words.  
  
Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  There was a golden line.
