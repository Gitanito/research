 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  The New Californian</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 New Californian, The.
 1891--1894  Monthly
 San Francisco, and then Los Angeles, CA.  Publisher: Leidecker & Morch.  Editor: Anonymous (probably Jerome A. Anderson, M.D., F.T.S.), Louisa A. Off, Marie A. Walsh.
  1/1, June 1891-3/12, June 1894.  $1.50 a year.  5 x 8 1/2, 32 pp.

 	 Despite the title, this was basically a Theosophical journal with much filler on local California color.  No editor is listed for the first twelve months but it was probably edited from San Francisco by Anderson, who handed the post in July 1892 to Louisa A. Off ( - 1895) (and Marie A. Walsh) in Los Angeles.  Contributions by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Joaquin Miller, J.D. Buck, et al.  Anderson went on to edit the Pacific Theosophist.  The contents of the journal, prepared by the Australian Theosophical Society, are now online at http://www.austheos.org.  California State Library; Pasadena Public Library; Sacramento Public Library; San Jose State University; University of California, Irvine; University of Minnesota; University of Chicago; University of Pennsylvania, et al.
