I was so upset because so many of my own
friends has been murdered by the
resident real I resigned from the
Foreign Service and I then went to the
Ministry of Defense as an intelligence
officer specializing in Russian and
Chinese mantis you see but then you see
for nearly ten years I found myself
working in a top-secret department on
the next floor underneath the floor
where the Royal Air Force was studying
UEFA&#39;s so at a very early date I got
confirmation that your first existed and
although I wasn&#39;t involved in their work
I wasn&#39;t saying building
my name is Gordon crate hmm and I spent
a good many years in the British Foreign
Service I was in the Far Eastern
Department so I became a China
specialist and I had already done
Russian at Cambridge so in the end I had
these two languages at which of course I
used a great deal in this work and I
spent 10 years in China and it was there
in 1941 when I was back again there with
the embassy as it was now an embassy and
I had this sighting of what we call a
UFO of course I didn&#39;t say that goes as
flying saucer all that goes in your foe
but because this was six years of course
before Kenneth Arnold look was whitish
disc totally silent apparently flying
extremely fast and it had a bluish light
on top on the apex it was that bluish
color this would get in arc welding and
that was coming on rhythmically so that
as it went across the sky you could say
it&#39;s coming on there got to come on
there got to come on there come on there
and that was flying from the Northeast
that would be from Manchuria where to
Morris towards Burma towards the
southwest well I never forgot that I
sort of put it in the back well I
thought I&#39;d go back was this daytime or
nighttime Oh daytime midday and it was
not high it was flying underneath the
clouds totally silent it certainly was
very fast because it was much faster
than me the famous Japanese fighter the
zero which we were already seeing at
that time Chinese Communists took over I
didn&#39;t feel happy about the British
policy and recognized them anyway and
USA didn&#39;t what we did like was a
mistake and I also felt very strongly
that yes they should have backed Chiang
kai-shek anyway you wouldn&#39;t have had a
Vietnam War or a Korean War but that&#39;s
or water under the bridge so I resigned
from service and I then went to the
Ministry of Defence in Whitehall which
quite close to Foreign Office
and as an intelligence officer in view
of my knowledge of Russian and Chinese
and I was working there for on
intelligence matters to do with those
two countries and therefore no way in no
way was it connected with the you for a
problem but the fact was that physically
I was on the next floor underneath this
department which we knew who was dealing
with UFOs so AI had seen something in
China and B I was now underneath this
department which was said to be dealing
with the same subject so I already know
you fell face up like you would have
been this would be 53 and what this
division was called you mean the what my
division was all vision dealing with the
UFO problem I think it was their tech
err technical but having of course seen
something and having while I was in the
States seeing the earth in the newspaper
accounts heavily censored by the way
about the through fighters or crowd
rules as the American pilots call them
I was already quite sure you see I
wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t one who believes that
UEFA&#39;s might exist I was satisfied that
I&#39;ve met Germans who&#39;ve seen them of
course German pilots I&#39;ve talked to RAF
people who certainly saw them probably
small you know small devices of the
probably the Foo Fighter type described
to me always has some small globular
either still real golden or fiery
perhaps a foot or two wide I imagined
they would tell him eating devices of
some sort I understand that very
interesting thing happened in Germany
after the war when the eyes were
occupied in Germany one of our bombers
was flying over Germany very low of
course it was not their pressurized
height flying very low with a waste
hatch open apparently one of these
things came in and flew up and down
inside because the whole crew of eight
or so saw it and it then flew out again
and soap on it probably took a total
reading of every man
you know picture of him and took even
his blood pressure and his state of
mental development if any in spiritual
development and as it went and you know
that in Brazil where I was some years
later one crash to the place called
ubatuba and the bits were salvaged and I
think they ended up with the Americans
in the end and I believe it was found to
be very largely um what&#39;s the stuffed
about magnesium largely the content in
other words it was something expendable
he was starting to collect names are
already for subscriptions and two of the
first requests we got were from the Duke
of Edinburgh and from his uncle
Mountbatten now the interesting thing
there is that in that same year fifty
four this proves the interests of the
Duke had a subject it was announced in
the press that he had requested the
British Ministry of Defence to give him
a copy of every are you for a report
they had so if that shows his interest
is a very early date naturally if the
magazine went to him from their lawn so
Duke and is still going to him
in fact I also sent it to Prince Charles
and of course it went to the uncle Lord
Mountbatten until he was till he was so
fascinated she was in London and she was
reporting back and she said that I and
my husband we&#39;re at a cocktail party
last night and we met a man a man whose
name is known to every American a man of
cabinet rank who told us the story about
the crash of craft with small occupancy
but I interpreted that as being a
British crash I didn&#39;t know that was
wrongful
but the interesting thing is that we do
know that on the estate of Lord
Mountbatten which is the South of
England down his house
Hampton
the estate is called problems that in
the early successes I stick it was a
rather very early thing we published the
story the whole story in the early
sixties he had a man working on their
states on the states of grounds when I
think of working outside anyway and this
chap apparently one morning it was
wintertime was snow on the ground and he
was coming in and he apparently saw
youfo hovering and I believe I&#39;m writing
saying he saw it land and he was pretty
shaken we came into the house so they
took this man his name was bridges who
had been in the British Army in the war
they took bridges in to senior now
Burton and Lamberton asked him sell his
story and opened the pulled out a draw
and got a lot of different types of UFO
photos out and showed it see there was
it this one was it this type of this and
apparently which is indicated that one
which was more or less like it and then
they got to a girl a secretary come in
and bridges made his statement
they took six copies of it bridges
signed them all and they gave him a copy
to keep and the Mountbatten put the
other five a draw and that was that well
we got the story I think we got it from
them Desmond Isley but anyhow we
published it at the time so you see
there have been landing on on the estate
of of Mountbatten and that was
Mountbatten&#39;s great interest and it was
one of my closest friends with Hynek a
when Hynek came over here the first time
i went on behalf of our group to meet
him and took about to lunch
and he told me very interesting thing
and this ought to go on the record i
think he said he told me that absol then
the US authorities had not been showing
him
any of the cases that were being coming
in from CIA overseas or from embassies
or tonsils
it was desperately important as we see
from Coursera spooky was desperately
important to the soviets
shouldn&#39;t know what the americas found
out of course we now know by the way we
now know that the Stalin was quicker off
the moment when the Americans were
because you probably know the story of
this star in it
Stalin became aware it was a very early
date in 47 after the story of after
Harold and the Stalin was collecting
reports from all over the place and one
day he called in their top a young
astronomer near in November named
Coralie Akali of Korolyov and showed him
all these reports and Stalin said to him
sit down there look at that
what do you think about it and
apparently Korolyov said well
Stalin said no here in the Kremlin do
this until I you can stay here today I
get your outside so apparently he gave
him the answer he said yes it&#39;s so it&#39;s
not of this world it&#39;s not of this earth
it&#39;s not restful and then Stalin
apparently wanted him to take over
control of it you remember and Charlie
off said said well if you don&#39;t mind I&#39;m
an astronomer and mathematician I don&#39;t
really want to do that and of course he
went on to be the heads of the whole
Soviet rocket program had a very
tremendous career but obviously from the
American point of view it was
desperately important that they but they
should keep it top secret
well I&#39;m sure well like you could say
that the end zone time for any of the
secrecy arrived when certainly when the
Soviet when the Soviet empire dissolved
because there wasn&#39;t that danger and in
longer very little has leaked out over
here a lot less leaked out here than
over on your side they really have to
check the lid on it well here but I&#39;ve
always had the impression that the
Americans were giving
them here very little information that&#39;s
not surprising because there&#39;s more
knowledge about the subject over on that
side than anywhere and I&#39;m quite certain
of course that if ever we do get a
breakthrough we solve this problem it
will be done in the States and that as
Hynek said to me several times when we
discuss hi once I remember asking what
do you think caused this assuming
they&#39;ve always been there but what
caused this great interest in us this
large incursion after 47
I don&#39;t remember he thought from every
so we&#39;ll obviously yes I atom bomb if
you think of if you accept the
multi-dimensional theory it&#39;s highly
likely that we&#39;ve done a hell of a lot
of damage in somebody else as well
nobody we&#39;ve done more damage than we
did here and if you take a beehive
you&#39;re not you should mr. president
please come out look at anything if you
felt they might even a figure and so I&#39;d
my office I think it&#39;s enormously
complicated problem if he carries on is
yes he&#39;s like of times have played with
him as a charge of dynamite in the
hammer he&#39;s going to destroy himself man
could have survived forever with bows
and arrows he&#39;s not going to coexist
forever forever with his present
technology one of the other is going I
am certain that measures have been taken
by agencies to terminate people who who
appear to be inconvenient or troublesome
as her knowing too much I suspect that
if this happened with at least one
editor of cycles from you I suspect that
it happened with a man with MK Jessup in
the States
I&#39;m very puzzled about James McDonald I
cannot understand why that man should
who had a perfectly happy life in fact
cannot understand that he should have
replied attempted as he did to tried to
kill himself as he did and to finally do
it so terrible
Kennedy may have been may have been gay
been engaged in a bit of a struggle with
the CIA in try attempted to get more
information on the youthful subject and
that ostensibly the story goes that he
might have been thinking regarding the
FPU for some people so serious they
ought to take it up with the Russians
now if he was thinking of taking it up
with the Russians they may have thought
this was a premature very dangerous
thing to do and that might account for
his termination I wonder I think
certainly the heavy crash craft I&#39;m sure
the American authorities have got
corpses preserved quite a number of them
probably and I suspect to some other
country so there was definitely at large
chunk of my life missing you know do you
recall anything
interval no it was in 20 years ago they
even then didn&#39;t even think about a UFO
extraterrestrial anything like that it
was just what what I was more concerned
me than I believe this or know that that
thing was blocking the road
it wasn&#39;t what it was
