It was too late for a cesarean section so they did a quick forceps delivery and apparently, I was 'dead' at the time.

I clearly remember floating above and watching them work on my son to get him breathing, cleaning him up and passing him from relative to relative while they worked on me, and I kept asking people to hand me my baby but nobody answered me.

The following day they gave me three units of blood when they realized they had not given me any transfusions and I could not sit up without fainting. My mother insisted I had not been speaking to anyone and could not have seen anyone doing anything to my son because I had been 'dead' at the time.
