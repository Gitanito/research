PREFACE.
It was originally my intention to
make the extraordinary case of Miss
Rider the subject of a commmiication
to one of the Medical Journals ; and,
on that account, though frequently so-
licited, I have uniformly declined to
furnish a statement of the facts for
publication in the newspapers. After
the delivery of the Lecture which forms
the basis of the following history, it
was suggested, by several gentlemen,
that the popular form in which the
subject is here presented, was better
calculated to meet the wishes of the
public than a history more strictly pro-
fessional. From the wide circulation
thai has been given to the partial
accounts which have already appeared,
it is believed that a curiosity to see an
authentic narrative of all the circum-
stances connected with this truly re-
markable case has been excited in many.

Somnambulism, or sleep walking, forms,

dreaming and insanity ; and, in order to a
full understanding of its nature, it will be
necessary to offer a few remarks relative to
these two seemingly different, but really
analogous states. .
Sleep has been defined to be the repose of
the organs of sense and of voluntary motion.

impressions, or the muscles to contract,

expended daring their action. After a pe-
riod of activity, which cannot be extended
beyond certain limits, the mind becomes
insensible to the presence of external things
—sounds are not heard, odors are not per-
ceived, heat or cold is not felt—all access
to the mind through the organs of sense is
closed—the intellectual operations become
dull and confused—recollection finally ceas-
es, and it is supposed that, in perfect sleep,
there is neither thought nor idea of any
kind. During this suspension of action in
the organs of relation, as they are called, or
those by means of which the mind holds
communication with outward objects, the
functions of organic life, such as respiration
and circulation, those which are necessary
to mere animal existence, continue.
Sleep, in the language of poetry, has
been compared to death : and Dr. Good has
stated that the resemblance between them
is not less correct upon the principles of
physiology, than it is beautiful among the
images of poetry. "Sleep is the death or
torpitude of the voluntary organs, while the

torpitude of the voluntary organs, While the

involuntary continue iheir accustomed ac-
tions. Death is the sleep or torpiiude of
the whole." There is also another stiiking"
difference. During the whole of sleep, a
process of renovation is probably going on in
the organs of relation, which adapts them
for subsequent activity, and contrasts sig-
nally with the state of annihilation which
constitutes death.
On the approach of sleep, all the organs
are not simultaneously affected. " The
closure of the eye first shuts out the sight,
the smell yields after the taste, the hearing
after the smell, and finally the touch sleeps.
Sensations of hunger, thirst and pain, are
no longer noticed. From the first, the in-
telleciual and moral pwwers partake of the
languor which pervades the frame—the will
relaxes its control—^the ideas flit for a time
in a disorderly manner, constituting a kind
of delirium—recollection is finally lost, and
the sleep becomes complete.-'

DREAMING AND INSANITY. 13
Philosophers suppose that in every act of
memory or imagination, tlie scene thus
represented to the mind is attended with a
momentary belief of its reality—a belief,
however, which the senses enable us imme-
diately to correct. For example, in think-
ing of a past transaction, we for the moment
regard it as actually present ; and this im-
pression remains till reason, by comparing
the vision with the actual state of things in
the external world, dispels the belief. There
are, however, states in which this belief of
the independent existence of that which is
only passing in the mind is not corrected
by the actual relations of external things.
Of these states, dreaming and insanity con-
stitute two remarkable examples. In in-
sanity, the senses are awake and the will
active ; still, the false impression remains
and influences the conduct. " The maniac
fancies himself a king, possessed of boundless
power, and surrounded by every form of
earthly splendor ; and, with all his bodily
senses in perfect exercise, this hallucination
is in no degree corrected by the sight of his

bed of straw, and all the horrors of his cell."
The same belief in the reality of that which
occupies the mind occurs in dreams ; but
the will, in this state, having no control
over the active powers, the conduct is not
affected, and the vision is dissipated upon
awaking".
Dr. Abercrombie remarks that the pecu-
liar condition of the mind in dreaming, ap-
pears to be referable to two heads :
I. " The impressions which arise in the
mind are believed to have a real and present
existence ; and this belief is not corrected,
as in the waking state, by comparing the
conception with the things of the external
world. II. The ideas or images in the
mind follow one another according to asso-
ciations over which we have no control
;
we cannot, as in the Avaking state, vary the
series, or stop it at our will."
Somnambulism partakes of the character
both of dreaming and insanity. The mind,
as in dreaming, is fixed on its own impres-
sions, which, it supposes, have a real and
present existence—a delusion which is tem-

porar3% and is dispelled on waking—but, as
in insanity, the will excites the organs of
voluntary motion, so that the person acts
under the influence of his conceptions. The
somnambulist is also, to a certain extent,
sensible of the presence of external things ;
but the ideas received through the organs
of sense do not correct the erroneous con-
ceptions, but rather intermingle with and
confirm them. Somnambulism, therefore,
is a state of imperfect sleep, in which the
mind, sensible, to some extent, of the pre-
sence of external things, still believes in the
reality of the visions by which it is occupied,
and acts under the influence of this belief.
This state occurs most frequently in
childhood, and is often connected with
frightful dreams. Soon after going to bed,
before the period of sound repose, dreadful
visions haunt the mind. The individual
imagines himself in some danger from which
he attempts to escape—his first efforts are
unsuccessful, because the limbs do not obey
the will—at length the will regains its
power, and the dreamer, trembling with
apprehension, rises, and often calls for help.

Some time generally elapses before the false
impression vanishesj and the mind becomes
sensible to surrounding objects. Precisely
of the same nature are those dreams from
which adults awake in terror, the heart
palpitating violently, and the whole system
in a state of agitation ; but the organs of
motion in tbem being less easily excited by
the will, they wake in the struggle. It is
under the influence of dreams of a different
kind, that some peisons talk in their sleep,
the will acting in correspondence with the
thoughts which occupy the mind. The
only difference between dreaming and sleep
talking is, that in one case the organs of
speech obey the will, and in the other they
do not.
The next variety occurs in those indi-
viduals, who, under the influence of dreams,
rise from bed, walk about the house, finding
their way without diflSculty and avoiding
obstacles, engage in various employments,
and finally return to bed. These transac-
tions are afterwards remembered only as a
dream. The case of a young nobleman is

mentioned, " Who was observed by his
brother to rise in his sleep, wrap himself in
his cloak, and escape by his window to the
roof of the building. He there tore in pieces
a magpie's nest, wrapped the young birds
in his cloak, returned to his apartment and
went to bed. In the morning he mentioned
the circumstance as having occurred in a
dream, and could not be persuaded that
there had been any thing more than a
dream, till he was shown the magpies in
his cloak." The most remarkable example
of this kind with which I have been per-
sonally acquainted, was that of a young
gentleman in Yale College, who rose in
his sleep, jumped from a window in the
third story of the college buildings, breaking
several panes of glass in his fall, and ran
some rods before he awoke. The account
which he gave of the occurrence was, that
he dreamed he was in the hall stealing
pies ; and finding there was no other way
to avoid detection, he escaped through the
window, and ran, as he imagined, towards

young
gentleman in Yale College, who rose in
his sleep, jumped from a window in the
third story ofthe college buildings, breaking
several panes of glass in his fall, and ran
seine rods before he awoke. The account
which he gave of the occurrence Was, that
he dreamed he was in the hall stealing
pies; and finding there was no other Way
to avoid detection, he escaped through the
window, and ran, as he imagined, towards

his room. He received only a slight injury
from the fall.
So far, the philosophy of somnamhulism
appears perfectly intelligible, and we find
little difficulty in accounting for the phe-
nomena which this class of cases presents.
But there are other cases, which, while
they retain so many points of resemblance
to the preceding as to be included under the
same name, still differ from them in many
important particulars. Some of these pre-
sent symptoms of a very extraordinary
nature. While there is the same belief in
the reality of the scenes which occupy the
mind, united with at least a partial insensi-
bility to external impressions, which exists
in ordinary somnambulism, there is a state
of the intellect ual powers analogous to that
which is occasionally witnessed in insanity,

sensibility in one or more of the organs of

of consciousness, the individual, on waking,

paroxysm.
Several examples of this affection are
given by medical writers, some of wiiich I
will relate. — "An ignorant servant-girl,
mentioned by Dr. Dewar," observes Dr.
Abercrombic, "during paroxysms of this
kind, showed an astonishing knowledge of
geography and astronomy, and expressed
herself in her own language in a manner
wh ch, though often ridiculous, showed an
understanding of the subject. The alterna-
tions of the seasons, for example, she ex-
plained by saying that the earth was set
a-gee. It was afterwards discovered that
her notions on these subjects had been de-
rived from overhearing a tutor giving in-
structions to the young people of the fam-

Another case, in many of its features very

of Aberdeen. " The patient was a servant-

somnolency, which came upon her suddenly

at first, be roused by shaking, or by being
taken out into the open air. She soon be-

the church of England, and concluded with
an extemporary prayer. In her subsequent
paroxysms she began to understand what
was said to her, and to answer with a con-

Jane C. Rider, the subject of the following
history, is a native of Vermont, and in the
17th year of her age. Her father, a very
ingenious and respectable mechanic, resides
in Brattleborough. With him, and with
the friends of her mother, whose sudden
death from disease of the brain rendered her
an orphan in early infancy, she lived till
last April. At that time she removed to
Springfield, and became an inmate of the
family of Mr. Festus Stebbins ; where her
intelligence and uniformly mild and obliging
disposition soon secured the confidence and
love of all with whom she was connected.
Her education is superior to that which is
usually acquired by those occupying the
middle rank in society. She is fond of
reading, and especially delights in poetry,
her selections of which generally evince a
chaste and correct taste. Though of a full
habit, her appearance is prepossessing, and
her plump and rosy cheeks, by the unpro-
fessional observer at least, would be regard-
ed as the index of perfect health. She,
however, has always been subject to fre-

can be no such thing as hnposture. If there
be a mistake, it is in us—in the conclusions
which we draw from our observations—in
her I am satisfied there is no intentional
deception.
The singular affection of which she has
lately been the subject, made its first ap-
pearance on the night of the 24th of June.
I was called, under the impression that she
was deranged, and such at first was my
own belief. She was struggling to get out
of bed, complaining very much at the same
time of pain in the left side of the head.
Her face was flushed, the head hot, eyes
closed, and her pulse much excited. At-
tributing the attack to the presence of undi-
gested food in the stomach, I gave her an
active emetic, which she took voluntarily,
supposing me to be« her father. She reject-
ed a large quantity of green currants, after
which she became more quiet, and soon fell
into a natural sleep, from which she did not

deception.
The singular affection of which she has
lately been the subject, made its first ap-
pearance on the night of the 2-ith of June.
I was called, under the impression that she
was de|'anged, and such at first was
my
own belief. She was
struggling to get out
of bed, complaining very much at the same
time of pain in the left side of the head.
Her face was flushed, the head l1ot, eyes
closed, and her pulse much excited. At-
tributing the attack to t11e presence of undi-
gested food in the stomach, I gave her an
active emetic, which she took voluntarily,
supposing nie to be her father. She reject-
ed a
large quantity of green Clll'1'flI1IS, after
which she became more quiet, and soon fell
into a natural sleep, from which she did not
wake till morning; when she was
totally
unconscious of every thing whichhad passed
in the night, and could scarcely be persuaded

Nearly a month elapsed before another

keep her in bed, it was determined to suffer
her to take her own course, and watch her
movements. Having dressed herself, she
went down stairs, and proceeded to make
preparations for breakfast. She set the
table, arranged the various articles with the
utmost precision, went into a dark room
and to a closet at the most remote corner,
from which she took the coffee cup?, placed
them on a waiter, turned it sideways to
pass through the doors, avoided all inter-

safely on the table.
She then went into the pantry, the blinds
of which were shut, and the door closed
after her. She there skimmed the milk,
poured the cream into one cup and the milk
into another without spilling a drop. She
then cut the bread, placed it regularly

she said was also directed to them, though
it was evident, at times, her conceptions

which she answered hy addressing a little

placed in her hand, she immediately lecog-

roxysm occurred a few hours after she had
eaten a large quantity of green currants ;

disturbed the stomach.
During the fit she very often called for

gratified her appetite. At a time when she
had invariably one or two paroxysms daily,
I gave her an emetic, and afterwards allow-

whether she could read with her eyes

she read with ease a great number of cards

discerned by common eyes. She told the
date of coins, even when the figures were

time. Soon after, on going out of doors,
she observed to her companion, " what a
beautiful day it is, how bright the sun
shines !" It was in fact quite cloudy.
When asked by one of the ladies of the

by probably more than a hundred people.
To this circumstance, undoubtedly, is to be
attributed the unprecedented length of the
paroxysm : for she did not wake till Friday
morning, forty-eight hours after the attack.
During this time she read a great variety of
cards written and presented to her by differ-
ent individuals, told the time by watches,
and wrote short sentences.
For greater security, a second handker-
chief was sometimes placed below the one
which she wore constantly over her eyes,
but apparently without causing any ob-
struction to the vision. She also repeated
with great propriety and distinctness several
pieces of poetry, some of which slie had
learned in childhood, but had forgotten, and
others which she had merely read several
years since without having ever committed
them to memory. In addition to this she
sung several songs, such as " Auld Lang
Syne" and " Bruce's Address to his Army,"

On Wednesday, Nov. 20th, I took a large
black silk handkerchief, placed between the
folds two pieces of cotton batting, and ap-
plied it in such a way that the cotton came
directly over the eyes, and completely filled
the cavity on each side of the nose—the
silk was distinctly seen to be in close contact
with the skin. Various names were then
written on cards, both of persons with whom
she was acquainted, and of those who were*

they were presented to her. This was done
by most of the persons in the room. In
reading she always held the paper the right
side up, and brought it into the line of

she read equally well that which was held

" Immediately after falling asleep she be-

seemed to labor, and she was uneasy and in

of day by a watch, in the dark, with her eyes
closed—the fire was not extinguished, and of
course it was not entirely dark. Her pulse
was 72 in a minute, and without irritation.
She answered questions regularly, but with
an air of impatience ; and said " they kept
asking her to read, but she would not."
She declared she would not go to Worcester,

very sweetly ; sung some tunes with cor-

paroxysms, the Doctor observes, he is now
satisfied were occasioned by improper food,
particularly by the free use of fruit.

the disorder that has brought me to tlie
Hospital. The first attack was in June.
It was about ten in the evening—the people
called a physician ; he thouglit it was par-
tial derangement, and gave me an emetic
that stilled me a little, and I got over it,
and the next day was quite well. The
people thought it was a very strange disor-
der, and let it pass off. But I was troubled
almost every week with the same disorder,
and it soon became something serious. I
found I was growing worse every day, and
was put under the physician's care. Medi-
cine did not seem to have any effect, and I
was still growing worse. In October I was
attacked in the day time. It was Tuesday
morning, and it continued till Fridaj^ morn-
ing, when I went into a natural sleep, and
awoke up and knew nothing of what had
passed. I will not try to give you any de-

Tincture of Sanguinaria, and calomel in
small closes, were also given with the inten-
tion of affecting a secretion, which, at this
period of life, is essential to health, and to
the establishment of which the favorable
change in her state is mainly to be attribu-
ted. Her head was also shaved, and blisters
were applied to the part which had been
painful from the first, and, at one time, to
the inferior extremities likewise. Great care
is still necessary on the subject of diet.
Many of tlie paroxysms may be directly
traced to the quantity or quality of the food
which had previously been taken.
The somnambulism in this case undoubt-
edly depends on physical disease, and theie
is every reason to believe that it will gradu-
ally disappear, if a judicious course be
pursued. Indepen'dent of all other conside-
rations, I have no doubt, fiom the exhibitions
at the Hospital, that all the facts stated in

REMARKS.
Those who have witnessed Jane's con-
duct for a single hour during a paroxysm,
need not be told that she is no impostor.
—
There is an air of honesty about her, which,
however difficult it may be to describe, it is
easy to discern, and hard to counterfeit.
But, independent of any regard to her cha-
racter, the very nature of the facts stated
preclude the idea of imposition ; certainly
unless it be admitted that others were con-
cerned with her in a conspiracy to delude
the public. No art could enable her to see
in a dark room, or when her eyes were closely
covered. Nor is the supposition that she
was assisted by others at all more tenable
;
for aside from the improbability of the thing,
an argument which those only who know
the circumstances can duly appreciate, the

ehare of credulity who can at once be brought
to admit them. But, without entering into
a discussion of this subject, I am satisfied
that all the facts in the case under conside-
ration admit of a solution on less questiona-
ble principles.
Two things are necessary to vision; first,
that an inverted image of the object be
painted on the retina, or nervous expansion
at the back of the eye : secondly, that the
impression be conveyed to the brain in such
a. way as to occasion perception.
The eye is simply an optical instrument,
made up of parts endowed with different

to admit them. But, without entering into
a. discussion of this subject, lam satisfied
that all the facts in the case under conside-
ration admit of a solution on less questiona-
ble principles.
Two things are necessary to vision; first,
that an inverted image of the object be
painted on the retina, or nervous expansion
at the back of the eye: secondly, that the
impression be conveyed to the brain in such
sa. way as to occasion perception.
The eye is simply an optical instrument,
made up of parts endowed with different
refractive powers, so
arranged and combined
as to form a dist.inct image just where it
should fall, on the retina. That part of the
process of vision, therefore, which relates to
the formation of this image, is purely physi-

for the expression which she once used in a
cloudy day—" what a beautiful day it is,

quantity of light which passed through the
eyelid, was sufficient, in the excited state of
the retina, to give her the impression that
the sun shone. The extreme pain which
she experienced when the light was thrown
upon the unprotected eyelid, with the mirror,
is to be explained in the same way. The
effect was equivalent to that which would be

it were suddenly placed in the focus of a

eyelid, as every one can satisfy himself by

are so variously refracted that no distinct

single berries in a cluster of elderberries from
each other, and these berries from black currants.
It has been proved by experiments carefully made,
that in a perfectly dark night, he could distinguish
different dark colors, such as blue and green, from
each other.
When, at the commencement of twilight, a
common eye could not yet distinguish more than
three or four stars in the sky, he could already
discern the different groups of stars, and he could
distinguish the different single stars of which they
were composed, from each other, according to
their magnitudes and the peculiarities of their
colored light. From the enclosure of the castle
at Nuremberg, he could count a row of windows
in the castle of Marloffstein ; and from the castle,
a row of the windows of a house lying below the
fortress of Rothenberg. His sight was as sharp,
in distinguishing objects near by, as it was pene-
trating, in discerning them at a distance. In anat-
omizing plants, he noticed subtile distinctions and
delicate particles, which had entirely escaped the
observation of others.
Scarcely less sharp and penetrating than his

in the world more disagreeable to him than any
other, was the sense of smelling. What to us is
entirely scentless, was not so to him. The most
delicate and delightful odors of flowers, for in-
stance the rose, were perceived by him as insup-
portable stenches, which painfully affected his
nerves.
What announces itself by its smell to others,
only when very near, was scented by him at a
very considerable distance. Excepting the smell
of bread, of fennel, of anise, and of caraway, to
which he says he had already been accustomed in
his prison, — for his bread was seasoned with
these condiments —all kinds of smells were more
or less disagreeable to him. When he was once
asked, which of all other smells was most agreea-
ble to him ? he answered, none at all. Ilis walks
and rides, were often rendered very unpleasant by
leading him near to flower gardens, tobacco fields^
nut trees, and other plants which affected his ol-
factory nerves ; and he paid dearly for his recre-
ations in the free air, by suffering afterwards from
headachs, cold sweats, and attacks of fever. He
smelt tobacco, when in blossom in the fields, at
the distance of fifty paces, and at more than one
hundred paces, when it was hung up in bundles
to dry, as is commonly the case about the houses
in the villages near Nuremberg.
He could distinguish apple, pear, and plum
trees from each other at a considerable distance,
by the smell of their leaves. The different color-

What we call unpleasant smells, were perceiv-

our perfumes. The smell of fresh meat was to
him the most horrible of all smells. When Pro-
fessor Daumer, in the autumn of 1828, walked
with Caspar near to St. John's churchyard, in the
vicinity of Nuremberg, the smell of the dead bo^
dies, of which the professor had not the slightest
perception, affected him so powerfully, that he was
immediately seized with an ague, and began to
shudder. The ague was soon succeeded by a
feverish heat, which at length broke out into a
violent perspiration, by which his linen was thor-
oughly wet.

the metals, and his ability to distinguish them

Daumer has collected a great number of facts,

with hardware and particularly with brass wares.

Daumer placed a gold ring, a steel and brass
compass, and a silver drawing pen under some
paper, so that it was impossible for him to see
what was concealed under it. Daumer directed
him to move his finger over the paper without
touching it ; he did so ; and by the difTerence of
the sensation and strength of the attraction, which
these different metals caused him to feel at the
points of his fingers, he accurately distinguished
them all from each other according to their respec-
tive matter and form. —Once, when the physician,
Dr. Osterhauscn, and the royal crownfiscal Brun-
ner from Munchen happened to be present, Mr.
Daumer led Caspar, in order to try him, to a table
covered with an oil cloth, upon which a sheet of
paper lay, and desired him to say, whether any
metal was under it ; he moved his finger over it
and then said : there it draws !
" But this time,"
replied Daumer, " you are nevertheless mistaken }
for," withdrawing the paper, " nothing lies under
it." Caspar seemed at first to be somewhat em-
barrassed ; but he put his finger again to the place
where he thought he had felt the drawing, and
assured them repeatedly, that he there felt a draw-
ing. The oil cloth was then removed, a stricter
search was made, and a needle was actually found
there.
When he laid his hand upon a horse, a cold
sensation, as he said, went up his arm ; and when
he was mounted, he felt as if a draught of wind
passed through his body. But these sensations
went over after he had several times rode his horse
around the riding school.

It will scarcely escape the observations of
phrenologists, that the organs which, according to
the system of Spurzheim, correspond to the men-
tal faculties that were affected during the parox-
ysms, are grouped together in the anterior part of
the brain, near the region in which she felt such
acute pain. The organs of Color, Tune, Time,
Wit and Imitation, -were evidently, in the language
ofphrenology, morbidly excited. It is certain also
that the excitement was confined almost entirely to

maybe said of the specific details of phrenological

NOTE B.
It will scarcely escape the observations of
phrenologists, that the organs which, according to
the system of Spurzheirn, correspond to the men-
tal faculties that were affected during the parox-
ysms, are
grouped together in the anterior part of
the brain, near the region in which she felt such
acute pain. The organs of Color, Tune, Time,
"Tit and Irnitation,~vere evidently, in the language
ofphrenology, rnorbidly excited. It is certain also
that the excitement was confined almost entirely to
the intellectual faculties-the sentiments and pro-
pensities were not at all affected. There was no
uncommon manifestation of Benevolence, Venera-
tion or
Hope, nor of Combativeness, Destructive-
ness, or
any other of the propensities. Whatever'
may be said of the specific details of phrenological
science, the facts brought to light in this and other
analogous cases, it must be admitted, go very far
towards establishing the fundamental principle
that the mind acts by separate, and to a certain
extent, independent organs.

The power of computation evinced by the
youthful Colburn, springing up as it did sponta-
neously, and without any previous instruction, is
one of the most remarkable facts in the history of
mind; and is in itself much more incomprehensible
than the extraordinary acuteness of vision mani-
fested by the subject of this memoir. Its discov-
ery was purely accidental. Zerah, not having yet
completed his sixth year, was overheard by his
father as he repeated to himself, in his play, parts
of the multiplication table. The father, surprised
to find that a boy, M'ho had hitherto possessed no
advantages beyond a six weeks' attendance at the
district school, discovered such a knowledge of
numbers, proceeded to examine him ; and, findino-
him perfect in the table, asked him the product of
13x97, to which 1261 was instantly given in
answer. The following extract from a memoir
written by himself, and published within the last
year, will show the facility with which he per-
formed numerical operations in his ninth year.
At a meeting of his friends which was held for
the purpose of concerting the best method of pro-
moting the interest of the child by an education
suited to his ttfin of mind, he undertook and
succeeded in raising the number 8 to the sixteenth

power, and gave the answer correctly in the last
result; viz. 281,474,976,710,656. He was then
tried as to other numbers, consisting of one figure,
all of which he raised as high as the tenth power,
with so much facility and dispatch that the person
appointed to take down the results was obliged to
enjoin him not to be too rapid. With respect to
numbers consisting of two figures, he would raise
some of them to the sixth, seventh, and eighth
power, but not always with equal facility ; for the
larger the products became, the more difficult he
found it to proceed. He was asked the square
root of 106,929, and before the number could be
written down he immediately answered 327. He
was -^then requested to name the cube root of
268,336,125, and with equal facihty and prompt-
ness he rephed, 645.
Various other questions of a similar nature
respecting the roots and powers of very high num-
bers, were proposed by several of the gentlemen
present, to all of which satisfactory answers were
given. One of the party requested him to name
the factors which produced the number 247,483,
which he did by menfioning 941 and 263, which
indeed are the only two factors that will produce
it. Another of them proposed 171,395, and he
named the following factors as the only ones,
viz. : 6 X 34279, 7 X 24485, 59 X 2905, 83 X2065,
35X4897, 295X581, 413x415. He was then
asked to give the factors of 36,083, but he im-
mediately replied that it had none ; which in fact
was the case, as 36,083 is a prime number.

the factors which produced the number 24'7,483,
which he did by mentioning 941 and 263, which
indeed are the only two factors that will produce
it. Another of them proposed 1'71,395, and he
named the following factors as the only ones,
viz. = 5 >< 34279, 7 >< 24485, 59 >< 2905, sa ><2o55,
35><4897, 295><581, 413><415. He was then
asked to give the factors of 36,083, but he im-
mediately replied that it had none ; which in fact
was the case, as 36,083 is a
prime number.
It had been asserted and maintained by
APPENDIX. 129
the French mathematicians that 4294967297
(=2^^ +l) is a prime number; but the cele-
brated Euler detected the error by discovering
that it was equal to 641+6,700,417. The same
number was proposed to this child, who found out
the factors by the mere operation of his mind.
On another occasion, he was requested to give
the square of 999,999 ; he said he could not do
this, but he accomplished it by multiplying 37037
by itself, and that product twice by 27. Ans.
999,998,000,001. He then said he could multiply
that by 49 which he did: Ans. 48,999,902,000,049.
He again undertook to multiply this number by
49 : Ans. 2,400,995,198,002,401. And lastly he
multiplied this great sum by 25, giving as the
final product, 60,024,879,950,060,025. Various
efforts were made by the friends of the boy to
elicit a disclosure of the methods by which he per-
formed his calculations, but for nearly three years
he was unable to satisfy their inquiries. There
was, through practice, an increase in his power of
computation ; when first beginning, he went no
farther in multiplying than three places of figures ;
it afterwards became a common thing with him to
multiply four places by four ; in some instances
five figures by five have been given.

Dear Sir,
In reply to your note of the 30th ult. I can
simply state, that I saw Miss Rider, repeatedly,
in the paroxysms of somnambuhsm or reverie.
Her eyes were covered with a closely folded silk
handkerchief, having a thick wadding of cotton
underneath—the whole drawn tightly over her
eyes. In this situation, I saw and heard her read
whatever was presented to her, promptly and dis-
tinctly, under circumstances which precluded, in
my opinion, all chance of deception. Several
experiments of this nature were tried in my pre-
sence, which satisfactorily removed all the distrust-
fulness that I had previously felt.

charge of imposture, so sudden and unexpected,
that she must have betrayed signs of some
emotion, of anger at least, had she been conscious
of what was passing : but such experiments,
though convincing, were unnecessary ; for the
most skeptical could not see her, for any length
of time, without being persuaded that she was
actually in a deep sleep. I saw your experiments,
in which you covered her eyes, and after close
examination, I was convinced that she could not
