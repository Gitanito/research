As Nature's different Laws of Motion change; T.

How to ſet a Clock or Watch by this Table. For example, Jan. ta.
1ſt, I find by looking into the Table, that a Clock to be right muſ
be 3 Minutes 41 Seconds faſter than a Sun Dial; therefore I ſet it to

beſt Time to ſet a Clock or a Watch by a Dial.

ECLIPSES of the SUN and MOON,
W i T H O T H E R
A PPEARANCES IN THE HEAVENS,
- In the Year 1803,
Calculated from New and Improved Aſtronomical
TABLEs,
Founded on the Newtonian Syſtem of Gravitation.
Astronomy hail, Science heav'nly born 1
Thy Schemes the Life affiſt, the Mind adorn;
Thy Aids the Heav'n's ſeal’d Volumes wide impart,
And taught the Seaman firſt his uſeful Art;
Gave changing Seaſons their determin'd Space,
And fix’d to Hours and Years their meaſur'd Race,
Tº will be two Eclipſes of the Sun within the
Limits of this Year; and as they fall about fix
Months diſtance from each other, we muſt expect no
Eclipſe of the Moon, for the Reaſon given by the great
Kepler, Epit. Aſtr. p. 881 : Novilunia duo Centrali
bus propinqua. Ergo circumſtantia Plenilunia illibata
Eclipſis Lunae toto Anno nullo; for which Reaſon alſo
ſuch Solar Eclipſes are ſeldom viſible in theſe Northern
Regions; but however, at the ſecond of theſe Eclipſes
the Moon is gone ſo far North of the Ecliptic Line as
to exhibit to us a viſible Eclipſe of the Sun, and that
too one of the largeſt that is uſually ſeen under ſuch Cir
cumſtances. -
The firſt of theſe Eclipſes happens on Monday, Febru
ary the 21ſt, at 5 Min. paſt our 9 at Night, conſequently
inviſible to all Europe, Africa, and Affa; but in the great
. Southern Pacific Ocean this will be a very great Eclipſe,
even
E C L 1 P S E S, &c. 37
even ſo that in Latitude 11 Degrees South, and 136 De
grees 15 Minutes Weſt Longitude from London, the Sun
will be both centraliy and totally eclipſed, preciſely at
Noon-day; which Place falls on the Globe (viz. the Earth)
near the MA R Quesas, a Group of Iſlands near the ſaid
Southern Pacific Ocean, of which the moſt conſiderable
are, St. Chriſtiana and St. Pedro. Captain Cooke lay ſome
Time at the firſt of theſe, in his ſecond Voyage round
the World, in 1774. Hence this Eclipſe will be ſeen by
the Inhabitants of the Marqueſas, Society, and Friendly
Iſlands. It will be a very great Eclipſe at the Iſland of
Otaheite, which was firſt diſcovered in 1767, by Captain
Wallis, who called it George the Third’s Iſland. The
Hiſtory of Omai, a Native of this Iſland, who was
brought over to England, and carried back by Captain
Cooke, in his laſt Voyage, is well known.—The ſecond
Eclipſe will happen on Wedneſday, Auguſt the 17th, at
about a Quarter before 7 in the Morning, viſible in this
Kingdom, when about a fourth Part of the Sun's Diſk will
be obſcured; but more exactly according to the following
Type and Calculations :
The
38 M O O RE, 1803.
The Moon makes the firſt Impreſſion on the Sun's Diſk,
at 76 Degrees from Sun's Vertex on the right Hand, and
the Eclipſe will be obſerved to begin as at B. (ſee the
Type) at 55 Min. paſt 5 o'clock in the Morning; the
Middle, or Time of the greateſt Obſcuration will be at
42 Min. paſt 6; and the Moon quits the Sun near his
lowermoſt Point, and the Eclipſe ends at 31 Min, paſt 7,
according to apparent Time at London. The Digits
eclipſed will be 3° 12', and the whole Duration of the
Eclipſe 1 Hour 36 Min.
The foregoing Type is a Repreſentation of the Appear
ance expe&ted at London; and as to the Points of Conta&,
in reſpect to the vertical Circle, may tolerably ſerve the
whole Kingdom.
º
Other Appearances in the Heavens this Year, 1803.
The moſt remarkable Appearances, Conjunétions, and
Occultations of the Planets and fixed Stars are theſe fol
lowing, which I have taken ſome Pains to exhibit to view,
for the ſake of ſuch curious Perſons as are furniſhed with
proper Teleſcopes to obſerve them.
On Thurſday, March the 3d, the Moon eclipſes Kappa
Gemino, a Star of the 5th Magnitude, and viſible, the Air
being clear, as will the Reſt following. The Immerfion
takes Place at 58 Min, paſt 5 o'Clock in the Evening;
and the Emerfion at 12 Min. paſt 7, apparent Time, at
lendon.
On Saturday, April the 2d, the Moon eclipſes another
Star of the 5th Magnitude in Leo; Immerſion 2 Min. paſt
7 o’Clock in the Evening, and Emerſion at 46 Min. paſt
7, apparent Time at London.
On Monday, O3. the 31ſt, the Moon eclipſes the Star Era
in the Conſtellation of the Pleiades, which is of the third
'Magnitude; the Immerfion, will be at 49 Min, paſt 5
o'Clock in the Evening, and the Emerfion will be at 37
Min. paſt 6, apparent Time at London. The Moon will
eclipſe others of the ſeven Stars at the ſame Time, namely,
Stars belonging to the ſame Conſtellation.
Conjunétihar
E C L I P S E S, &c. 39
Conjundžions of the Planets, worthy of Remark.
On Sept. the 6th, the Planet Mars comes to a Conjunc
tion with the Georgium Sidus, one of the new-diſcovered
Planets, when the difference of their Latitudes will be
only 14 Min. of a Degree; the Georgium Sidus being more
North, they ſet that Evening at 26 Min. paſt 7 o’Clock.
On the 13th of Sept. Mercury comes to a Conjunétion
with jupiter, at which Time the Difference of their La
titudes will be about two Degrees, that of Mercury being
foutherly ; they ſet ſoon after 7 in the Evening.
On the 15th of Sept. the Planet jupiter will come in
Conjunction with the Georgium Sidus, when the Difference
of their Latitudes will be about 28 Min. of a Degree,
jupiter being more to the North; Jupiter will ſet about 7
in the Evening. -
On the 19th of Sept. Mercury comes to a Conjunction
with Mars, when the Difference of their Latitudes will
be near 2 Degrees, Mercury being more ſouth. They paſs
the Meridian at 1 Hour 28 Min. and ſet at 54 Min. paſt
6 at Night, Mercury being near his greateſt Elongation
frem the Sun; therefore, if the Air be clear, will ſooner
be obſerved, as he generally is hid in the ſolar Blaze 1
Note, the two great ſuperior Planets, Jupiter and
SAT use N, are now ſeparating very faſt from their Con
Junétion, as ſeen from the Earth; which Conjunction
takes Place but once in 20 Years. During the Spring of
this Year, they will make a fine Appearance in the
Heavens; but jupiter will now have got paſt Saturn,
and gone to the Eaſt of him, which any common Ob
{erver may eaſily ſee with the naked Eye. In the Month
of March, they come to an Oppoſition to the Sun (as
ſeen from the Earth); a little before which, and for ſome
Time after, they will be in the beſt Situation to be viewed
with a Teleſcope. - There is now approaching, a great
£clipſ of the Sun, viſible in England another Year

METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS, &c.
Remarks on the Weather in 1801.
ANUARY was a very mild Month, and Vegetation
forward; yet the 26th was a very cold Day.
Feb. the Middle of the Month was froſty, and the 13th
and 14th Days the coldeſt in the Year ; the reſt of the
Month was mild, with but little Rain.—MA Rch was ſo
mild and fine, that by my Journal of the Weather, I ſee
the Thermometer was never ſo low as the Point of
freezing. The Mornings in APR I L were cold, but much
warmer as the Day got up, for it was no unuſual Thing
to ſee the Thermometer in the Shade often 14 or 15 De
grees, or more, higher in the Afternoon than it was in
the Morning; the laſt Week of the Month was very clear,
with Wind Eaſt, and the Barometer very high.-In MAY
nothing much remarkable.—The 9th, Ioth and 29th
Days of June were very hot, almoſt as any in the whole
Year : but on the 13th the Air altered very cold; and
on the 3oth there was a violent Hurricane or Whirlwind,
accompanied with Lightning and Thunder, and much
Rain.-In July there was a good deal of Rain, and on
the 16th and 17th violent Storms of Thunder, Lightning,
and Hail, which was juſt after the Conjunétion of Sa
turn and Mars in Leo : The 22d was the hotteſt Day of
the Year.—Au Gust, Rain at the Beginning, but a
very fine Month afterwards, and the Harveſt was well
got in ; on the 3d the Wind veered to the N. E. with
much Rain, the Barometer high, and kept riſing all the
Day; and notwithſtanding the Wind ſhifted back again,
the Mercury kept advancing in the Tube, a pleaſing
Sight to a Farmer, as it implied a Continuance of fine
Weather to follow, which accordingly happened. Here
are my Maxims, namely, “In wet Weather, if the
Quickſilver riſes high, and it continues to rain two or
three Days after its riſing, if it fall not again during
I that
Meteorological Obſervations, &c. 41
that Time, expett a Continuance of fair Weather to
follow.”—SEPT. nothing particular.—Oct. the oth at
Night a violent Storm of Thunder and Lightning; ‘the
Lightning was very inceſſant.—Nov. Rain and Wind at
the Beginning, and even during the Month, much Rain
and Snow.—Dec. This was in general a cold Month ;
yet on the 5th Day, the Air was warm and moiſt, the
Seaſon of the Year conſidered. I mean this Alman ack,
as to the Weather, &c. to be claſſed with a good Weather
Glaſs, for the Uſe of the Farmer, Grazier, and other
Huſbandmen, as well as for the Uſe of the Curious ;
but thoſe Weather Glaſes hawked about the Country, are
generally worth but little. I caution my Readers alſo
againſt a counterfeit Moore's Almanack, or any other
Pamphlet under the Name of Moore ; for I do aſſure my
Readers, I have no Hand in any other. Something of
this Kind was handed about the Country laſt Year (18oi),
about a Comet, but it was an Impoſition upon the Public.

Cou RT eous RE A De R,
You may remember, that for ſeveral Years paſt, I
mentioned that there appeared a Concurrence of 4%ral
and Prophetical Signs of ſome notable Alterations and
Mutations that were to take Place in the World, even in
Europe; and that it was the Opinion of many wiſe and
judicious Men, who have ſtudied the Revelations of St.
john, &c. that ſome great Revolution was near Manifeſ
tation, and that the Accompliſhment of ſeveral Scripture
Prophecies
42 M O O R E, 1803.
Prophecies was at Hand. The French Revolution has
now produced ſuch aſtoniſhing Effects, that it may be
conſidered as one of the moſt extracrdinary Events that
have been recorded in the Annals of Mankind. It has
not been merely a Revolution in their Government, but
their Manners and religious Profeſſions have been much
changed, and their Example ſeems to have had (and ſtill
is likely to have) an Influence on all the ſurrounding Na
tions. The World at large took an Intereſt in the Af
fairs of the Republic of France, ſo that the Rulers of
the Earth combined together, and led unnumbered Hoſts
againſt them ; but thoſe Enthuſiaſts have now driven them
from their threatened and invaded Country, and have
enlarged its Borders; and Tračts of Spain, Italy, and
Germany, have fallen into the Hands of the Republicans :
and by their Help and Example, the Governments of
Bolland and ſome other Places alſo, have been changed
or overturned ; and it is yet out of the Reach of Human
Wiſdom to aſcertain the End of thoſe wonderful Events.
Though Rome yet ſtandeth, and Popery has ſpread wide,
yet their wickedneſs is diſcloſed, and their Credit is
much abated, and the Time is faſt drawing on, when it
ſhall utterly fall. It has already fallen in the Credit and
Eſtimation of her Dočtrine : It ſhall fall in Wealth and
Riches; it ſhall fall in Power and Authority. And in all
theſe it has begun to fall, and it will continue ſo to do;
for as it did not riſe up all at once, it cannot be expected
to fall all at once, but by Degrees. The decrepid Age
of the Papacy is at Hand: The preſent Scene of Affairs
in Europe, particularly in France, and the Diſtruſt that
all Men begin to have for Prieftly Tyranny, are all ſtrong
Preſumptions that the Papacy will decline and go down,
and that pretty rapidly, as will ſoon appear from Proteſt
antiſm gaining Ground, by being tolerated every where
in the French Republic, and the Reſtoration of the Chriſ
tian Sabbath, notwithſtanding the preſent Adoption of
Roman Catholiciſm refined, as the Religion of the Ma
jority of the French People —The Holy Ghoſt hath often
and plainly affirmed the Downfall of Rome 1 That cer
tainly is true, and there is no Doubt to be made of it;
* for
Aſtrological Predićtions. 43
for what is more plain than to ſay, Rome is fallen—it
ſhall fall—it ſhall go into Perdition—it ſhall fall to De
ſtruction—it ſhall be burnt with Fire—it ſhall be made
deſolate and naked, and without Inhabitants.-Wide Rev.

REALMs, which took place rather ſuddenly, and ſooner
than was expe&ted by moſt People. I rejoiced at it ; I
wiſh it may continue, and that for ever—but there is
Reaſon to fear.
It now appears, that from France we have gained
nothing : To France, it ſeems we have yielded every
Thing. Thus, for the preſent, has cloſed the long, the
obſtinate, the ſanguinary Conflići. France has obtained
not only every Obječt for which ſhe engaged in the
- War, but Objećts which the moſt ambitious of her Mo
narchs never could, and which the moſt ambitious of her
| Stateſmen ſcarcely ever hoped to obtain. All this we
intimated and foretold in our preceding Almanacks,
which has now ačtually too much been fulfilled. In my
laſt, I repreſented the political State of England and
Prance, by two Armies in Battalia, between which was a
Globe with the Pićture of a Bull upon it, which (befides
ſomething more) repreſented the two Countries in an
armed Poſition, looking with a jealous Eye upon each
other. Now, while was quietly paſſing between

Of the Winter Quarter.
THE Brumal Ingreſs, or Winter Quarter, begins,
according to Aſtronomical Computation, on Wedneſday
the 22d Day of December, 1802, at 51 Minutes paſt 11
o'Clock in the Forenoon, for then the Sun enters the
tropical Sign Capricorn, and the Days with us are at
the ſhorteſt. This Quarter, though with us accounted
the laſt, yet, by Numa Pompilius, the Roman, was ac
counted the firſt, and for this Reaſon, becauſe the Sun
then begins to turn towards us ; and as nearly the whole
of it falls in the new Year, we for that Reaſon begin

been ſo for a long Time paſt, even from the Time of
their platique Aſpect; which, amongſt other Things,
denoted peſtilential and contagious Diſtem pers, ſuch as
the Scarlet Fever, putrid ſore Throat, and the like,
which have been but too ſeverely felt in divers Parts of
this Kingdom, ſo as to be almoſt univerſal, which I in
timated in my laſt, p. 4; ; alſo great Inundations of
Waters, which, happily for this Country was not felt
here; but in the laſt Autumn was dreadfully ſo in Italy,
France, and Germany, &c. And as to War, cruel War !
happy for us that it is, at the writing of this, removed
from our Coaſts; but dreadful to relate it has ſince raged
with all its Horrors, in the Iſland of St. Domingo, in the
Weſt Indies; the Plague alſo breaking out in Turkey, with
other Diſaſters to that ill-fated Country. Theſe Planets,

THIS Quarter takes its Beginning on Menaay the 21ſt
Day of March, at 20 Minutes paſt 1 o’Clock in the
Afternoon, at which Time the Configurations of the
planetary Orbs will be as above, which is the grand Radix
of the Year’s Revolution, or Sun's Ingreſs into Aries.
Here the Sun is in a dire&t 3 of nſ, as he was of P a
few Days before, and in 9 Days more comes to a II Aſpect
of 3 , from Cardinal.$1gns; and here alſo we muſt look
to the late Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the
earthly Triplicity, as the Foundation for our aſtrological
as well as cabaliſtical judgment of mundane Affairs,
which are to be purſued until the next Conjunction of
theſe Planets in 1821, which will take place then in
...Aries, the Aſcendant of England; therefore the Effects of
this Conjunction will not terminate in leſs than twenty
. Years This ſeems to be a very eminent and active In
greſs, and there will be very eminent and active Doings;
Perhaps ſome ſudden and unexpected Diviſions may hap

pen amongſt the Powers and Rulers of the Earth. The
World is now poſſeſſed with many Doubts and Fears, in
which Holland, Pruſſia, and the French Republic are
concerned ; neither will Spain and Italy come off Scot
free, nor yet the Turkiſh Empire. Great Murmurings
and Diſcontent of the common People at the A&tions of
their Superiors : Many Places will yet be made ſenſible
of the Malevolence of the planetary Energy in this and
forme ſucceeding Years. Theſe are cautionary Admoni
tions to England, to beware of impending Dangers both
from public and private Enemies. I expect Calamities
and Misfortunes to ſome Countries by Storm, Tempeſts,
Earthquakes, and Inundations, epidemical Sickneſs, and
the like. I hope and wiſh that our honourable City of
LoN Don may triumph in Peace, Health, and a flouriſhing
Trade. O England / England! thy impoveriſhed Cities
and Towns, after ſome Years, ſhall (I have Reaſon to
hope) flouriſh again and again; therefore let us not de
fpair. I wiſh all diſcreet Perſons to be cautious of their
Health, becauſe the Weather is likely to be very mutable,
and change from warm to cold on a ſudden, which may
much difiemper Nature, the Air generally inclining to
Diſtempers more than ordinary.
Of the Summer Quarter.
THIS Eſtival Quarter begins on Wedneſday the 22d Day
of june, 2 Min. paſt 1 I in the Forenoon, when 17 Deg.
of Gemini are on the Medium Coeli, and 20 Deg. of Wirgo
tranfit the Orie...tal Angle; Mercury, Almuton thereof in
the ioth in # to H. ; the Moon in SU in the 11th ; ab. *
2, ad. 3 of Mars. The two Superiors it and H are
en or near the Cuſp of the Aſcendant in tº, a human
Sign and of the earthly Triplicity, and within 12 De
grees of each other. Theſe are more amicable and
happy Poſitions, and promiſe Felicity to the Engliſh Na
tion in particular, and portend Men's Minds to Peace
and Amity; whence we may expect that many long
continued Breaches and Diviſions are now friendly ad
juſted, &c. But not ſo to every Nation, for Wirge is the
Aſcendant
48 M O O R E, 1803.
Aſcendant of Paris, and ſome other Parts of France;
therefore expect ſome Diſturbances there. I fear
fome contagious Diſtemper may break out amongſt the
horned Cattle in foreign Parts. I hope Precaution will
be taken that it is not brought into this Nation,
ſhould that be the Caſe, or any other contagious Sick
neſs. But to ſum up all, though there is no Felicity to
be expected in this World without Alloy, the Contin
gencies of this Quarter will, in all Probability, be more
ſalubrious than either of the two preceding Quarters,
and the Produce of the Earth, I hope, plenteous, though
the Sword ſhould not be ſheathed every where.
Of the Autumnal Quarter.
THIS Quarter begins, this Year, on Saturday, 24th Sep
tember, 1o Minutes before one o’Clock in the Morning,
when 14 Degrees of Y are on the Mid-Heaven, and 6
Deg. of S. poſſeſs the Oriental Angle. The Planets

Animoſities may break out amongſt them, and perhaps
in America too. The 3 of 3 and 8 gives Reaſon to
fear the Highways will be much infeſted by Thieves;
much robbing, thieving, and ſtealing all over the King

Let us implore Heav'n's providential Hand,

From foreign Foes, and from domeſtic Jars,
From Iriſh Rebels, and from civil Wars:
