  		              		Experience Description   

    It was a cold night in 1991. I had been drinking with family.  My wife and I were dropped off at our home. I was arguing.  My uncle's anvil punched through my storm door. While pulling my arm back from  the door, a large chunk of glass fell down on my arm.  It cut me all the way to the bone at the elbow.  Blood started gushing out of the wound while my wife tried to wrap it with a towel.  Then she ran across street to my sister's house to get my aunt to come help.  They got me into the car and headed to the hospital. About three miles down the road, I told my wife to tell my son that I love him.  Then I slumped unconscious, down in seat. Upon arrival, a nurse pulled me out of the car.  I had no heartbeat or pulse. I was told later that I had been dead for at least 5 minutes. 

I watched them work on me from afar. The next thing I remember is watching the firefighters who were standing over me as they loaded me into an ambulance.  No helicopters or planes could land in the foggy weather. I heard the EMT say, 'He'll never make it. He has no blood left.'

 They rushed me 30 miles to another hospital in Indiana.  They could not help me there, so the ambulance rushed to a hospital in Kentucky.  I was rushed into surgery that lasted 11 hours.  

 This is the first time I have talked about this to anybody other than family or friends.
