  		              		Experience Description   

    I experienced a pre-birth event. I recall the following: an older Male who was dark in complexion.  He was lying in bed and gravely ill. He was surrounded by what I assume is a family and a preacher. A young lady, maybe in her early 20's, was holding his hand. She was extremely emotional. He was tapping her hand, stating that everything was going to be all right. I recall him really needing her to stop crying and understand what he was saying. He knew he was about to die, but didn't want to leave while she was so distraught. Another young lady, maybe in her mid to late 20's, grabbed a green phone (old rotary phone). She was controlling her emotions, while telling someone on the other end of the line that they needed to hurry, as 'he won't survive much longer.'  

  The older man continued to try and calm down the young lady holding his hand. All of a sudden, he was above them all, looking down at himself and them. Immediately afterwards, everything he'd ever experienced, felt, thought begun to unwind. It started slow, but got faster, and faster, and faster and eventually becoming a streak of light. This streak of light, I've since learned, was a sperm. There were a LOT of them. All brightly lit, before turning black, as if they were dying off. It's very difficult to explain, but the consciousness of the older man, and my current consciousness either merged, or swamped position. I eventually penetrated what I initially thought was a wall. I was going to hit it and afterwards, splat. Instead, I squeezed through it, as if it was a thick liquid. I saw the embryo but was communicating with something telepathically. It was telling me I had to enter the embryo, but I got a glimpse of another place and wanted to go there. I was very adamant about not wanting to come back here, but, in a very soothing voice, it simply said, 'you have to go back'. I fought and fought until I found myself back in a biological body.   There's a lot more to this. Things most people would find extraordinary, but for me, is simply what this life has been. The above, just describes my arrival here. The other events are many and extremely detailed. It would take hours, upon hours to try and write it all out, and make sure it makes sense. I would like to speak with someone about the rest of it. 

  The reason I am sharing this is because I need to understand how it relates to other things I've learned in these 50 years of existence. I've quietly researched what was that experience and how have I been able to do the things I've been able to do. My entire life has been affected, for better or worse, by these experiences.
