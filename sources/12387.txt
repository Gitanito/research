We had a big barbeque and after went to the beach.  My parents told my siblings and me to wait for at least an hour before swimming.  There was deep water and they didn't want us getting stomach cramps.  I, of course, being the rebellious and 'know-it-all' teenager that I was, ignored their warnings and swam out to a buoy that was about a half-mile out.  When I was about halfway towards the buoy, I started to get cramps.  I almost could not swim, but eventually was able to make it to the buoy.

I grabbed on tightly to the buoy and tried to rest the best I could.  When I felt rested, I attempted to swim back to shore.  While swimming, I again experienced excruciating painful cramps, so painful that I could not swim anymore.  The water was deep and way over my head.  I started slowly sinking to the bottom of the lake.  I remember seeing the sunrays shine down into the deep water and the intense fear that I felt knowing that I would eventually drown.  I held my breath for as long as I could until I started to breath involuntarily.  When the water entered my lungs, I started choking and vomiting.  This seemed to have lasted an eternity.  It was one of the most fearful and painful experiences I have ever had.

All of a sudden, all of the pain and agony ended.  I saw my physical body on the bottom of the lake.  My face showed a lot of pain and distress.  My spiritual body felt no pain, but only relief and peace.  I felt free and liberated. I turned around and saw a long see-through tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was a very intense and bright light. I seemed to be physically drawn to the light, almost as if it was sucking me towards it. The light radiated love and peace. I wanted to experience it and be in its presence.

I then realized that my physical body was dead or dying.  Fear overcame me.  I realized that it was not my time to die.  I wanted to live a long and fulfilling life and have all the experiences and choices that life brings.  I pled and prayed to give me another chance at life.  The next thing I remember is coming to the surface of the water and gulping for air. I felt so much pain and physical torment again. I slowly swam back and almost collapsed when I reached the shore. My family was off doing other things and did not see me come to shore. When I found my parents, they said I looked worn out and exhausted. All I told them was that I swam out too far and had some cramps, but made it back OK.

I did not share this experience with anyone for probably over four years.  I knew and believed what had happened, but I was cautious to share it because I thought that no one would believe me.  This near death experience (NDE) had a big impact on me.  I became a lot more spiritual and had a desire to serve my fellow man.  This experience has given me the knowledge that our conscience exists after death and that there is a Higher Power.  It has grounded me spiritually and has been a source of strength that has helped me through life's trials and tribulations.

  Experience Description 4111  					</p>  					When I was 17, my family and I were camping at Bear Lake in Idaho. We had a big barbeque and then went to the beach. My parents told me and my siblings to not swim out in the deep water for at least an hour because we could get stomach cramps after eating all that food. I, of course, being the rebellious and ‘know it all’ teenager that I was, ignored their warnings and decided to swim to a buoy that was about a half mile out.  When I was about half way to the buoy, I started to get cramps. I struggled to swim but was eventually able to make it to the buoy.

I grabbed on tightly to the buoy and tried to rest the best I could and when I felt rested, I started the swim back to shore. While swimming back, I experienced the same excruciating, painful cramps. I was in so much pain that eventually I could not swim any more. The water was deep and way over my head and I started slowly sinking to the bottom of the lake. I remember seeing the sunrays shining down into the deep water and my feelings of intense fear at knowing that I would eventually drown. I held my breath for as long as I could until I started to breathe involuntarily. When the water entered my lungs, I started choking and vomiting. This seemed to last for an eternity. It was one of the most fearful and painful experiences I have ever had.

All of the pain and agony suddenly ended and I could see my physical body on the bottom of the lake. My face showed pain and distress but my spirit body felt neither, only relief and peace. I felt free and liberated. I turned around and saw a long ‘see through’ tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was a very intense and bright light. I seemed to be physically drawn to that light, almost as if it was sucking me towards it. The light radiated love and I felt at peace. I wanted to experience it and be in its presence.

I then realized that my physical body was either dead or dying. Fear overcame me as I realized that it was not my time to die. I wanted to live a long and fulfilling life and have all the experiences and choices that life brings. I pleaded and prayed to God to give me another chance at life. In the next moment, I was coming to the surface of the water and gasping for air. I felt so much pain and physical torment again. I slowly swam back and almost collapsed when I reached the shore. My family did not see me stumbling to the shore as they were off doing other things. When I saw my parents, they said I looked exhausted and worn out. All I told them was that I swum out too far and had some cramps but made it back okay.

I did not share this experience with anyone for probably over four years. I knew and believed what had happened, but was cautious whom I chose to share it with because I thought that people would not believe me. This near death experience (NDE) had a huge impact on me. I became a lot more spiritual and had a desire to serve God and my fellow man. I also know that there is a life after death and that there is a Supreme Being.  

The experience grounded me spiritually and continues to be a source of strength that helps me through my life’s trials and tribulations
