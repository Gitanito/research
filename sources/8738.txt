  		      2742.        Mary Son Other       10/28/2009.      Other 16047.                Son's drawing in first grade is premonition of death at age 20.   

    2741.        Anna Probable NDE       6/30/2011.      Probable NDE 5229.       Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      This Being was surrounded by light and by other people, but I could not see them well, they were like silhouettes, or shadows. I was told that I should not be there, that it was still not my time that I had to go back to those I had left on earth and solve the problems of my present and future life. I was also warned about what could happen if I committed the same act at some future time, along the lines of: 'Death could stay with you without offering the chance to come back,' and that I needed to cure the evil, which I had in my body (referring to the overdose). This was actually a warning made out of love.  
   Probable NDE from attempted suicide.   

    2740.        Ella J NDE       5/27/2010.      Secondhand NDE 16042.             I entered a large hall. It was so long that I could not see the end of it. It was filled with people. As I was conducted through the throng, the first person I recognized was my Grandpa H. P. Jensen, who was sitting in one end of the room writing. He looked up and seemed surprised to see me. He said, ‘Why! There is my granddaughter, Ella!’  ‘He was very much pleased, greeted me and, as he continued with his writing, I passed on through the room and met a great many of my relatives and friends. It was like going along the crowded street of a large city where you meet many people, only a very few of whom you recognize.  ‘The next one I knew was Uncle Hans Jensen with his wife, Mary Ellen. They had two small children with them. On inquiring who they were, he told me one was his own and the other was Uncle Will's little girl.  
   Mormon NDE from 1891.   

    2739.        Edward S NDE       6/25/2011.      NDE 5239.             Shortly, I heard talking and felt someone lift my arm, hold my wrist for a minute and then say, 'Bag this one too, he's dead.' I said, 'No, I'm not!' and they went into high gear to get me out. After they got me out and into the ambulance, things became strange. It was like I was above the ambulance, watching it going to the hospital. Then, once I got there, I watched from above as they wheeled me into the emergency room. It was really strange.  
   NDE due to severe car crash.   

    2738.        Linda D NDE       6/25/2011.      NDE 5238.             I was floating in this black void, totally conscious of myself and my identity. I was curious, but not afraid. There was nothing to see, just blackness. I had no idea what was going on, but I had the feeling of moving forward and going somewhere. I was extremely excited and happy. As I moved along, the happiness became intense joy.  Then it changed. I had reached some sort of barrier and something indicated to me that I had to 'go back.'  
   NDE due to being hit by car at age thirteen.   

    2737.        HD M Possible NDE       6/25/2011.      Possible NDE 5236.             I was a life guard in New Jersey. Every day before the pool opened, I would hyperventilate dive in and swim the fifty-meter pool under water. That day I decided to take it a little farther. I would swim the fifty meters turn and swim another ten strokes then surface. I swam the fifty meters then counted three more strokes as I swam those strokes I looked to my left and saw the deeper blue of the diving area (eleven to twelve feet deep).  
   Possible NDE from drowning.   

    2736.        Denise B Probable NDE       6/25/2011.      Probable NDE 5234.       From Mexico.      Eventually, the doctor arrived to check on me. I handed him my coloring book where I had colored a picture of a doctor and little girl patient. The image I colored matched perfectly what my physician was wearing in that very moment! I had seen him and purposely colored the page to represent what I knew of him so he would surely believe I knew him prior to actually meeting him. In fact, when he entered my room he immediately began to introduce himself wherein I interrupted to inform him that I already knew him. That's when I held up the coloring page and offered it as a gift to him for doing such a good job with my surgery. He denied the possibility that I could know him when we had not met until that moment. Nothing I would tell him convinced him. I explained that I had heard him talking to the people who were helping him. He denied the possibility of this claiming I was deeply sedated and could hear nothing. I told him I had heard him telling a story to my mom which he also denied.  
   Probable NDE due to surgery at age eight.   

    2735.        John R NDE       6/25/2011.      NDE 5231.       From Canada      While dead, I spoke to someone who told me to go back, that it was not my time. I was told to be patient because there was a need for me. I was also told not to try suicide again because I would not be successful.  
   NDE at age twenty-four due to suicide attempt. Another NDE due to complication of hypothermic heart-lung bypass surgery.   

    2734.        Shawn M Probable NDE       6/25/2011.      Probable NDE 5228.             I felt my body shutting down. I was scared of the black void I was in, but found I was able to breathe. Then I felt calm. But I was brought back. I was angry about having to come back, because I had never felt that kind of joy while I was alive.  
   Probable NDE from suicide attempt.   

    2733.        Robert J Probable NDE       6/25/2011.      Probable NDE 5226.             My father held me in his arms as he, my mother, and the elders prayed during which time I found myself floating near the ceiling of the bedroom. The whole prayer and OBE experience seemed very short, less than a minute.  
   Probable NDE from severe febrile illness at age four. Shared seventy-eight years later.   

    2732.        Michael M Probable NDE       6/25/2011.      Probable NDE 5225.       From Australia.      I died at the hospital, yet I could see and hear everything that was said during the entire time. Even through the coma I could see my children who came to visit, they just couldn't hear me.  
   Probable NDE due to being hit by car.   

    2731.        Charles N NDE       6/25/2011.      NDE 5223.             I was sent to a place where I found myself inside a large building like the Parthenon, with those big columns. To the right, I saw a crimson statue of some kind dragon or beast, like a Chinese lion. As I looked at the columns, I saw from between them that it was night. Coming from a doorway, which led in the direction of the right hand corner of the building, I saw a bright light. So I walked toward the light and, as I did, I saw a hallway, which turned to the right. Its walls were made of gray-veined granite, the kind of stone often used to build mausoleums.  
   NDE due to anesthetic complication.   

    2730.        Albert S Probable NDE       6/25/2011.      Probable NDE 5222.             My hearing was fully tuned to that world. In the distance, I could hear musical wind-chimes, the gentle sounds of a waterfall. Every sound was perfect - soothing, peaceful, loving, harmonious and joyful to my soul. I experienced a sense, or state, of anticipation - perhaps it had to do with moving forward to meet my Maker (God) or looking forward to reaching my final, eternal destiny. The whole experience seemed altogether natural and purposeful. I felt completely content with it. The closer my spiritual body moved toward the light, the more peace, love and joyfulness I felt. I noticed that way up ahead of me, the valley in which I was traveling had an angular turning point from whence the light appeared to be emanating. When I was just about to reach that turning point, I became aware of my eyes slowly closing - and of remaining closed, as my spiritual body started travelling backward, speeding up faster and faster, back to where I had come from.  
   Probable NDE associated with operation   

    2729.        Denise T NDE       1/30/2011.      NDE 31943.             I overdosed on pain meds and was dead for several minutes. I had to have adrenaline shot into my heart. While I was gone, I found myself lying in the grass in a big field filled with beautiful daisies of all different sizes. There were hills and trees in the distance. I experienced a feeling of great love and understanding.  While I was there, I really didn't want to leave that place, but I just knew that when I came back, everything would be OK!  
   NDE due to overdose of pain medications.   

    2728.        Francoise A Probable NDE       6/24/2011.      Probable NDE 5211.       From Italy. Original in Italian, translated to English by Maurizio B.      It was like a tunnel with a beautiful garden that had many flowers.  There was a light at the end of the tunnel that grew steadily stronger and stronger.   Alongside this light was my grandfather who had died approximately six or seven months ago. I smiled at him and felt happy to see him. He was smiling as if he felt well (when I had last seen him, he had always been suffering because he had been sick with cancer).  
   NDE from suicide attempt.   

    2727.        Lorette C NDE       6/21/2011.      NDE 5165.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Simon A.      Then I saw a parade of photos of him and of me, on a boat. Yet I had forgotten these detailed memories, of these moments captured in these photos. As the photos passed before us, I remembered each of those moments. I felt as though I had become a bit drowsy, with my head still on his shoulder. Then, we separated. We were not on the ground; we were floating. He placed his hands on my shoulders, smiling at me gently, and a serene smile.  
   NDE from suicide attempt.   

    2726.        Silvia A NDE       6/16/2011.      NDE 5209.       From Italy. Original in Italian, translated to English by Maurizio B.      I wondered why there was so much excitement. I was in that wonderful peace, where I could not even imagine the pain. I felt my consciousness hovering over the doctors' heads, as if I were preparing to leave my body.  
   NDE from choking.   

    2725.        Emmett M NDE       6/12/2011.      NDE 5219.             I was in a sort of a room area that had three to five monks in it. There was something like a table that had little televisions on it, what I thought were funny typewriters. Later in my life, I recognized these as computers. At least three of the monks were standing in the left-hand portion of the room. Towards the back of the room was something like a large round doorway with very light colored fog in it. There appeared to be a bright light behind the slowly circling fog.  
   NDE at age eleven or twelve due to hanging. Shared about fifty-eight years later.   

    2723.        Hal E FDE       6/5/2011.      FDE 5215.             All of the sudden, I 'felt' a voice. (I say 'felt' instead of 'heard,' because at that time, my ability to 'hear', or process sound was close to zero.) The voice said the following, 'You are forgiven, but it is not your time yet.  
   Fear-Death Experience following auto accident.   

    2722.        Jon J NDE       6/5/2011.      NDE 5212.             I was in a vast field, more beautiful than anything I've ever seen.  There were flowers and grass abundant. I was standing on a small incline that dropped slightly until the field was flat. People made of crystalline light were in the field talking and loitering without a care, the field faded into forest about two hundred feet away. In the sky were moons of red, blue, green, orange, and the stars shone brighter and more gorgeous then any I've seen, it was either dusk, or night time but light enough to see perfectly. After seeing all that, the only thing I could say was 'I'm finally home'  
   NDE due to head injury with apparent seizure. Interesting that a non-ordinary experience began immediately prior to head injury.   

    2721.        MM Grandmother NDE       6/5/2011.      Secondhand NDE 5210.       From Norway, submitted in English.      During this time, my grandmother said that she found herself suddenly somewhere near the ceiling, looking down at all the people surrounding her bed. She saw the midwife's panic and her husband coming to her bedside, crying in despair. She also saw her two eldest daughters near the door, and then her mother pushing them into the next room.  My grandmother turned around then and saw a bright light in the distance, as if it was through the wall of the bedroom. Then her own grandmother appeared beside her and said 'Not yet.'  
   Second-person NDE. Was her Grandmother's NDE at the time of delivery in 1934.   

    2719.        Kyle R NDE       6/5/2011.      NDE 5207.             The next thing I experienced was darkness and a loud deep sound I can best describe as a deep vibration. I recall wondering at the time if it was my alarm clock (thinking I was back in college at the dorm). The darkness was then gone and I recall seeing the upper corner of the gym coming closer as if I were moving toward it. Then I recall looking down and seeing my partner holding up my slumped body. I would say I was off to the side about five feet and up about five to six, about ten feet off the gym floor.  
   NDE due to choking.   

    2718.        Stanley S Possible NDE       5/29/2011.      Possible NDE 5195.       From Germany.      As I placed my hand into His, I immediately found myself in a world of unconditional Love. Today, I feel that the hand was the hand of Jesus the Christ, Son of God. While my hand was in His, I discovered, felt, or believed that I was inside the mind of God. Although there was complete darkness, I felt that there was never a need for forgiveness here, that only unconditional Love existed. At that moment, it seemed to me that I was in the presence of all existing eternity. I believe to this day that what was communicated to me was simply this, 'Don't lie to yourself, nor to anyone.'  
   Possible NDE encounter with Jesus.   

    2717.        Vera G NDE       5/29/2011.      NDE 5201.             Suddenly, I was traveling through space. All around me were stars, and up ahead I saw a pure white light. Then I found myself standing in a clearing - some sort of field that was surrounded by trees. I wasn't alone. All around me were people, hundreds of them, maybe even thousands, but I didn't know anyone. I didn't know where I was or even who I was. You'd think that I would have been afraid, but I wasn't. It was like nothing mattered, not who I was, not who anyone was, and not even where I was, or if I'd be going anywhere. Everyone was talking and laughing. I felt like we all knew each other, but I don't remember recognizing anyone.  
   NDE at age 15 due to unconsciousness with seizure.   

    2716.        Dale T NDE       5/29/2011.      NDE 5198.       From Canada      Suddenly, I was observing the event from a corner of the room near the ceiling.  I could 'see' ME lying on the floor, and my brother and mother watching helplessly. Beside me, in my corner near the ceiling, I sensed a being. I did not know who this being was, but it seemed to me that he was a spiritual 'big brother' that I had known since forever.  Together we watched the events occurring below, as though it was all pre-planned. I knew that we would just wait a bit until things changed somehow, and then we would know when it was the right time, which would be when I would go back to my body.  
   NDE due to choking/suffocating on food at age six.  Shared 55 years later.   

    2715.        Matteo M NDE       5/29/2011.      NDE 5197.       From Italy      As I continued on, the blackness faded and I entered into a space - a place, a dimension that I don't know how to name, which was all white. It seemed to be a perfect white - emanating heat, light, serenity, tranquility, and understanding. I felt good there. I was just my soul - I did not have a sense of my body. I saw people at the bottom left, but they did not seem interested in me. Right in front of me, I saw a sort of silhouette coming towards me, but I couldn't identify what it was, because it/he/she was too bright.  I think the figure spoke to me, and maybe I spoke with it. Anyway, something happened, but I can't remember what, or what words were said (it was actually telepathy, more than words. We communicated without physical speech).  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2714.        Marie C NDE       5/25/2011.      NDE 5117.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Jean Peter.      I was outside of my body, watching myself from above. I saw myself lying in my bed, my arms down by my side. I felt so soothed - very calm and light. When I stopped watching myself 'sleeping,' I saw in front of me a very bright corridor without walls. It was a pale white at the beginning and it became brighter and brighter towards the end. As I went into the tunnel, I felt as if I were pushing my way through light, fluffy cotton. I felt wonderful! Suddenly I felt myself falling back into my body.  
   NDE from imminent life threatening event.   

    2713.        Early Native American NDEs       5/7/2013.      NDE 16038.               
      

    2712.        Pamela J NDE       5/22/2011.      NDE 5192.             I went into labor and then had to have an emergency cesarean section. It went bad. I was drowning in the fluids of my own body and from the childbirth. I was a chain smoker and I couldn't breathe. Then I saw a bright white light - beautiful, peaceful - and I was being drawn into the light, but I was being held back for some reason, like it was not my time. I heard the nurse say, 'Show her baby to her; it could be for the last time.' I didn't want to 'come back' to life. Where I was it was so peaceful and I wanted to stay there, I was not afraid.  
   NDE due to complications of childbirth.   

    2711.        Niel L NDE       5/22/2011.      NDE 5191.       From South Africa.      The next thing I remember is seeing my mother jumping the pool fence and diving into the pool. Her image was distorted as if I was looking through the water. Next, I remember lots of shouting and crying and my family all huddled over something. I remember trying to talk to them, but they couldn't see or hear me. Then I remember a tunnel with a light at the end. It was a very bright light, but it did not hurt my eyes. I can remember not wanting to return to my body, but being forced to go back  
   NDE at age four due to drowning.   

    2710.        Carol I NDE       5/22/2011.      NDE 5188.             You could call it a 'life review' but it was more in-depth than that. It was multi-faceted. These were the facets.  First, I experienced incidents from my life from my own point of view, second, from the point of view of whoever was with me, and third, from the point of view of a witness, a watcher of sorts, all simultaneously. One occasion I relived affected me deeply. I was in the eighth grade and was with my friends at school leading them on in verbally abusing another one of our friends. It was cruel behavior and I was drenched in it. I got to be me and experience that secret little thrill you get when you are cleverly mean to someone.  
   NDE due to complication of aplastic anemia.   

    2709.        Mateo NDE       5/22/2011.      NDE 5171.       From Argentina. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      I felt that I was in my body but I could not move, and far off I could see a little light. Something told me I should follow it. I followed it until it got brighter and brighter, and then something told me that it was not my time and that I had to go back. I was feeling very happy and did not want to return, I felt that I should stay.  
   NDE happened at age eight and shared at age thirteen.   

    2708.        Erika B Probable NDE       5/17/2011.      Probable NDE 5186.             It was strange because I felt throughout this entire experience like I was in my body; and, even though my eyes were shut, I could still see him. In a way, I was not really there.  Yet I could feel, hear, and see everything going on around me.  I saw mostly my husband screaming and slapping me, trying to wake me up. And I was screaming back at him to stop hitting me. I kept yelling, 'I'M AWAKE, I'M FINE!!' I was yelling for what seemed like ten minutes, when I realized that he couldn't hear me - that no one could hear me.  
   Probable NDE due to alcohol poisoning.   

    2707.        Yvonne S NDE       5/17/2011.      NDE 5185.             I'm somewhere around the ceiling looking down at my body on the table. That was when I noticed all the people in the room. They were doing things quickly, crowding around the table and me. A guy went to the speaker on the wall and said, 'Code red!' and then called for my chest x-rays. From my place near the ceiling, I answered him. I told him that they didn't have my chest x-rays, because they hadn't taken any. But he did not appear to hear me.  
   NDE due to complication after surgery.   

    2706.        Chris O NDE       5/17/2011.      NDE 5184.             I see myself standing over there in the darkness. I was asking both of my-selves simultaneously, 'What are you doing there? You don't belong there.' It lasted, to me, about two to three seconds. In the next memory, some of the bigger boys are dragging me. As I start to get my feet back underneath me, I have an indescribable sense of elation or maybe it was euphoria? Having regained consciousness, I tell my friends that 'I feel like I just came from home!'  
   Brief NDE due to fall from bridge at age seven.   

    2705.        Alan M FDE       5/17/2011.      FDE 5181.       From New Zealand.      I didn't see my 'life flash before my eyes' or any of the typical things you hear about - as there wasn't the time for this, I imagine. But, I just remember thinking to myself - 'This is gonna hurt!' Then, out of nowhere, I hear another 'voice' (not my own) saying, 'Alan, you're about to die.'  
   Fear death experience from dramatic fall nearly one thousand feet in a hang glider.   

    2704.        Brenda H NDE       1/18/2011.      NDE 22491.             I fell and the next thing I knew, I was in bed in a hospital room. But I was also up near the ceiling, looking down at myself in the bed. My Mom and my Grandma were at my Grandma's house, and I saw them there, crying.  Next thing I saw was the Universe. Then I saw the light. It kept asking me to come to it. I saw my relatives in line. They told me to go to the light, too.  I finally got to the light, and a voice told me that I have to go back - that they are not ready for me yet - because I still have some things to do. The next thing I remember, is being back in my body.  
   NDE at age 4 due to fall down escalator.   

    2703.        Francisco J NDE       5/17/2011.      NDE 5128.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      Then I saw my whole life in fast-forward. When I woke up there were a lot of people around me, asking me if I was okay, and I told them I was in a bit of pain, then asked them how many hours I had been there. They told me that I had not been there for hours, but just for a few seconds.  
   NDE from going unconscious on the playground as a child.   

    2702.        Christophe NDE       5/9/2011.      NDE 5116.       From France      I feel I am lying on some surface, though. I see a white light in the distance, like a lobby entrance or an opened door. The light is coming closer, or, rather, I feel I am going toward the light - as if I were walking but without walking, I feel my body does not move. It is very hard to describe. Once I arrive close to the light, a being on my right stops me. Without recognizing him by his appearance, I know who he is - he is my Grandfather. He tells me something like, 'No, not now, go back.'  
   NDE from accident.   

    2701.        Joe M NDE       5/7/2011.      NDE 5180.             All of a sudden, a deep peace filled me unlike anything I've felt before or since (even when I was doing drugs). This is the hard part to describe, a darkness, pitch black, 'enveloped' me at the same time but 'enveloped' is only as close as I can get to explaining it. It wasn't scary. It was warm, comforting and safe, safer than I've ever felt before.  
   NDE due to drowning at age seventeen.   

    2700.        Christopher N NDE       5/7/2011.      NDE 5174.             When I came out of my coma, one of the first things I asked her, was 'Why were you crying?' and she stated she wasn't. Then I told her that I had seen her from across the room. When I told her that, the hair stood up on the back of her neck, she told me later. Then she admitted that she had wanted to be strong for me, so she would turn away from me in the bed in order to try to keep me from seeing her weakness. I explained that I had been over by the doorway, out of my body, and that when she had turned to cry, she was actually facing right toward me.  
   NDE from being shot three time with hemorrhage from femoral artery.   

    2699.        Rosa D NDE       5/7/2011.      NDE 5104.       From Argentina. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      Then I saw the room as a glass box, and I could see my relatives outside. When I returned to where my body was, I saw my maternal grandfather to my left (he had died three years before my birth), and to my right was my godfather (who died when I was eight years old). They took me by my hands. Around them was a very beautiful blue light and I felt warmth in their hands. Then, above my head there appeared a tunnel. Many beings were there, and I felt their happiness on seeing me. My grandfather and my godfather told me I must be strong, as it was not yet my time, and I couldn't join them.  
   NDE from surgery complications.   

    2698.        Scott H NDE       4/16/2011.      NDE 16033.             And the light was with me. It was in this curtain of mist about head-level, and it wasn’t a type of light that was blinding. It had a warm, emanating energy from it. It was a combination white/yellow/orange, and it had a warmth, a love, a type of love that I’ve never experienced.  Most people would never be able to comprehend that level of love. A complete and total unconditional love. In the knowledge that forgiveness that God has for us I can’t begin to describe. It blows me away to this day.    

    2697.        Gregg S NDE       5/2/2011.      NDE 3049.             There I met three other human forms. I was informed that we had all incarnated in the past together. We were once a family.  The truth, knowledge, and wisdom they all contained made them look multitudes of light years ahead of me.  They showed me basic Universal laws that exist between the physical and spiritual planes.  I was shown the properties of the Law of Attraction, the responsibilities one has over one’s own space in this matrix of existence since, and everything is truly interconnected. And whatever you do, really does affect all eventually. This was beyond euphoria.  
   NDE from hang gliding accident.   

    2696.        Tracey J Possible Pet Dog NDE       11/9/2010.      NDE 31920.       From Canada      The puppy was neutered last week and it developed complications during the surgery.  It flat lined momentarily but was revived.  I recently brought him home wearing the ‘cone’ and I am not supposed to give him very much activity because of his stitches and the surgery ordeal. In the drawer there was a photo of my dad, upside down, which I stuck in the drawer a couple of days ago planning to put in an album one day.  The dog usually goes crazy for his brush.  He sniffed around in the drawer, his tail wagged like crazy, and then he pulled out the photo very carefully and gingerly carried it in his mouth.  He put it in his crate.  He has never carried paper before without chewing it apart (he absolutely loves eating paper).  This was so odd.  He can't get in the crate because his cone is too large but he set the photo in the crate on his pillow, just inside the door, then went to sleep on the floor. I believe that during my dog's ‘flat line’ moments in surgery, he must have seen my father.  Nothing else explains him putting dad's picture in the crate, or rushing off to dad's grave when he had no way of understanding the significance.  
   Possible pet dog ADC with complication of neutering resulting in flat lining, then inexplicable awareness of contributor's deceased father.   

    2695.        Leonard NDE       4/30/2011.      NDE 5170.             First, I saw the bright light, unlike any light on Earth. I went through the light at a very fast speed and felt no pain, no hunger, and not even any gravity. As a matter of fact, I don't think people on Earth ever feel the way I felt. But it's hard to explain. Then I saw this black curtain open to a color I had never seen here on Earth. I couldn't see anyone there. Then I heard my grandfather's voice say 'There he is!' in a very happy tone.  
   NDE from heroin overdose.   

    2694.        Marty M NDE       4/30/2011.      NDE 5169.             I saw plants and blue sky forming. Somehow, I sensed welcome and love from them. As they materialized, I felt I was way out in the country in a meadow. When they began to form in front of me, I sensed something wonderful was beyond them. I couldn't wait to get beyond them to explore, when suddenly I sensed I couldn't move. I looked down and saw a vast area. Within the area, I saw many little individual areas. One flashed, and at that point, I knew it was this life, and I had to come back.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    2693.        Liz G NDE       4/30/2011.      NDE 5168.             During this experience, my baby consciousness changed to one of a mature, or even an ageless person. I didn't feel as if I was of any particular age (certainly not the age of two) but as if I had already experienced a full life. I was feeling peaceful and calm about the events that were occurring. I felt as though everything was understood and everything was the way it should be.  
   NDE at age two due to drowning.   

    2692.        Derrick Birth Experiences       4/30/2011.      Other 5167.             I remember this being had massive hands and he cradled and caressed me in his hands. I remember him having a voice that was deep, strong and powerful but yet gentle and loving at the same time. I don't know for sure what he said to me since I couldn't understand language at the time but I could think in concepts or feelings such as I could easily tell if someone was talking in a loving way, sad way or angry way. I remember being in a the most wonderful state of peace and love that even to this day I have never felt anything close to. I remember seeing either the spirits or the spirit bodies of other babies that were about to be fitted with their earthly body. They were like swirling around this powerful being who was holding me and even looked like they could have been coming forth every time he spoke.  
   Pre-birth and during-Birth Remembrance. Memories of weeks after birth verified with parents and are medically plausible.   

    2691.   William C NDE   1/19/2017 & 4/30/2011.         NDE 8195/5166.       Exceptional Archive.      Then I looked in front of me and saw my deceased grandmother. She was standing just in front of the 'White Light.' The light radiated warmth, light, love and anything I needed to know. I also noticed other figures off to the left of me. They seemed peaceful in pairs holding each other and swaying with the music. My grandmother delivered the choice to me. I could stay with her or go back to my life. She told me that if I stayed, everything would be o.k. She said that if I went back to my body, it would be the most challenging experience I would ever endure.   
  NDE due to complication of feeding tube following car accident at age 17.   

           2690.        Jody M Probable NDE       4/30/2011.      Probable NDE 5160.             I cut through a vein in my left arm. I lay on the bed for about two hours and bled. I got up with a flashlight and went to the bathroom to see if I could stop the bleeding. As I was trying to stitch the lesion, I noticed that I was getting very weak throughout my upper body. Very soon all light faded away and my body collapsed to the floor. I saw the face of the woman that I was in love with, and I saw my own face simultaneously, next to hers. (She is still alive, just to let you know.) The background behind us was like a vortex. I felt very serene. She may have been my merit that saved me from death.  
   Probable NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    2689.        Nem J NDE       4/30/2011.      NDE 5101.       From Morocco. Original in French, translated to English by Jean Peter.      I recall a moment when I found myself up in the corner of the hospital room near the ceiling. There was also much light - an almost blinding white light. Looking down, I saw a part of my body and my legs, as well as my parents and the doctors standing around me. One of them was wearing white, the other one, blue. He was young and blond. This lasted for just a few seconds.  
   NDE from attempted suicide.   

    2688.        Jaroslaw D NDE       3/26/2012.      NDE 16031.       From Poland, Original in Polish.      My dad and a nurse tore off my clothes. I watched the doctor check my ribs, and then the bones in my arms or legs. He is looking for fractures, but there are none. I see it happen, and I know they are ok. He then checks my spine. There is no visible damage, but my body is limp. ‘Doctor, the pulse is weak,’ says the nurse. I watch someone run into the room and finally tell the doctor that I had fallen from a tree. I can hear my mother. She is crying in despair.  
   NDE at age 12 due to falling from a tree.   

    2687.        Esterlein B NDE       4/28/2011.      NDE 5100.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon.      I was suspended in a kind of starry sky which had the form of an ellipse, and around me were those same 'women' that I had seen many years before when I was in bed. They were holding hands and circling and circling, singing to me. They took me towards a very distant light; it was as if I were floating in space. Since then, I've read that others sometimes go through a tunnel, but that is not what my experience was like. I felt very good.  
   Beginning of a NDE from fainting.   

    2686.        Cherie J Probable NDE       4/25/2011.      Probable NDE 5040.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Jean Peter.      Then I am weightless, all is blue around me; there is a kind of light bridge to cross. At the other end of the bridge, there is more of the same blue - it's a blue path, and on it, there are people dressed in white robes, like monks. Their heads are covered, too. I don't see their faces but I trust them. One of the people parts from the group, looks at me, and waves me away with his hand, telling me to go back to where I came from. I feel strongly that I don't want to, I'd like so much to join them! I feel that this is my grandfather (whom I never knew personally; he died when I was seven months old). I ask him why he doesn't want me to join them, and he tells me, 'This is not your time; you have something very important to do right now.'  
   Probable NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2685.        Wanda C NDE       4/23/2011.      NDE 5155.             Some knowledge came to me and it went like this, 'You have been together and in relationship to each other for eternity. You are bonded, and this will always be. Do not be afraid of losing anyone, as this simply does not happen.' I took it to mean that we may live and die during this life, but we will also live and die again and again - together in different forms. The love between us is eternal. Our selves are eternal. Our bond is eternal.  
   NDE due to stopping breathing while under dental anesthesia.   

    2684.        Haley A NDE       4/23/2011 & 5/22/2011 .      NDE 5190/5154.             Once there I saw a short woman, but she did not look human, rather she looked both bright and transparent at the same time. I knew her; she was my grandmom who passed away when I was an infant. She did not tell me, I just knew. She was with another person, I knew it was my brother who passed away before I was born (I did not know I had a brother that died at the time). My grandmom was telling me to go back, but I felt so good there that I wanted to stay. It was so peaceful. She then started to say, 'Jack. Jack she will not go'. Then my father came out to see me and he held me. It was so right, like I was home. (My father had died when I was 6)  
   NDE at age 9 from head trauma.  Met deceased brother that she did not know she had until the NDE.   

    2683.        Camilla F Probable NDE       4/17/2011.      Probable NDE 5103.       From Sweden. Original in Swedish translated to English by Maria A.      At the end of the tunnel, I came closer to the light. It got brighter. I saw a figure made of shining light in front of me. I could only see the contours of the person, as if through a fog or haze. I felt such love and warmth. I felt I could have stayed there forever; this love surpassed any love I had ever experienced. The figure showered me with love - stronger love than from my parents or others. A love I had never felt before, it filled my whole body and soul. I felt unconditional love flowing to me from this figure of light; it filled me with happiness and it was everything I had ever needed.  
   Life-threatening event not defined at age fifteen, but was in a tent and awoke next day at parents, suggesting likely unconsciousness.   

    2682.        Tami N Probable NDE       4/17/2011.      Probable NDE 5152.             I met some new people and talked to them; they had died, too. I didn't know why I was meeting them, because I had not known them before they died. They just said that later on I would know why. Now I do. After I came back to this life, I met the best friend of one of those people, now that person is MY best friend. Another one of them, a lady that had died, she told me I had to go back and take care of her husband. I had been out of the hospital for a couple of weeks, when I met him. We both felt a special connection and are still together now... And also, my BFF ('best friend forever') - we shared details about his friend who had died - (details which I would not have been able know except for having met him) and he corroborated that everything I remembered about that person was accurate. And the boyfriend I have now - (he is the person whose wife requested I go back and take care of) we talk about his wife (she died over sixteen years ago) and he confirms everything I remember about her, too.  
   Probable NDE due to severe accident.   

    2681.        Dewayne NDE       4/17/2011.      NDE 5150.             When I was nineteen years old, I was stabbed numerous times with a butcher knife. I apparently lost an extreme amount of blood and went unconscious. I then remember floating above my body while emergency personnel were working on my body. It was as if the emergency vehicle was cut open and I could see the individuals inside it working on my body. I distinctly remember thinking. 'They are cutting up my favorite pants.'  
   NDE from blood loss due to stabbing.   

    2680.        Michael J Possible NDE       4/17/2011.      Possible NDE 5148.       From the Philippines.      I was feeling good and relaxed, telling myself, 'This is it; I am dead.' Then I felt myself rising up to where everything was bright white. Suddenly, I was in presence of a human form who was clothed in white. I couldn't see the face. I told myself that this figure must be Saint Peter, holding the key to Heaven. Then the figure spoke to me in English, saying, 'What are you doing here?' I answered, 'I do not know.' The voice said to me, 'Go back.'  
   Spontaneous Out of Body Experience (SOBE), possible NDE from the Philippines.   

    2679.        Evelyn V Probable NDE       2/21/2010.      Probable NDE 16028.             Then I flashed through a black space tunnel at supersonic speeds. A small light was at the end. That light became brighter and brighter, bigger and bigger until I stood in front of a white brilliantly shining figure. I could not see a face, only the bright white robe. I had no fear and the loneliness was gone. It was a state of complete joy and happiness that I had never experienced before. Take the happiest moment of your life and magnify it thousands of times. Then I saw to my left an image of Steve, my husband and John, my son, standing at a distance to my far left. I knew that I had to go back to them even though I was never happier and content.  I said to the figure, ‘I must go back to them, please let me go back and I'll come back again. They need me!’ In a flash, I came back.  
   Coma event that is a probable NDE.   

    2678.        Denise C NDE       4/16/2011.      NDE 5143.             I was at one end of a tunnel and I saw a group of people at the other end of it. From the background, a strong light was emanating, outlining the crowd with a beautiful yellow light. I could not see any of their faces - it was too dark. Two of the men, I knew, were my Irish grandfather's brothers. I could tell that's who they were because they were wearing the same type of hat my grandfather wore - those wool hats from the 1930s and 1940s. Then, I believe, Jesus spoke to me. It was such an incredible voice! The voice said, 'DENISE! GO BACK! IT'S NOT YOUR TIME YET!'  
   NDE at age ten due to illness.   

    2677.        Geri R NDE       4/16/2011.      NDE 5142.             I had had enough of the pain and the tugging and the forceps and the pulling and the bleeding I was floating towards a beautiful golden-bronzed light. It was there that I saw my mother and my husband holding hands smiling at me, they looked so happy and at peace. I wanted to feel that my mother smiled at me and took my hands and for that brief instant I felt it, I felt the peace and tranquility, and it felt so good.  
   NDE due to complication during dental procedure.   

    2676.        Fran E NDE       4/16/2011.      NDE 5140.             I was fascinated, not scared. I saw a small 'pin prick' of light in the upper right hand corner. Then beautiful crystals of light began coming through the small opening. The crystals were like a waterfall and just kept coming and coming. It was absolutely beautiful. I am unable to really describe it.  
   NDE due to heart attack and two cardiac arrests.  Contributor is a nurse.   

    2675.        Cara S NDE       4/16/2011.      NDE 5139.             I then felt my father taking me by the hand and my spirit rising from my body as I could see nurses and surgeon working on my body. I saw a tunnel and bright lights, and felt the presence of other dead people going towards the light through the tunnel. Then as I was getting nearer to the light I was stopped, and my father asked if I wanted to continue, but there would be no return to earth. I said no, I had to get back to my sons.  
   NDE following surgery.   

    2674.        Robert FDE       4/16/2011.      FDE 5138.             I felt helpless and could not steer (and I don't mean the tractor) and unable to get back and comfort my family and friends who were devastated by my tragic accident - well, actually, stupidity. So much in so short a time that it would take to plunge that distance.  
   Fear-Death Experience at age sixteen from fall over a cliff while on a tractor.   

    2673.        Linda F FDE       7/31/2011 & 4/16/2011.      FDE 6623/5136.             I was trying and trying to swim, not quite in a panic, but all of a sudden I stopped thrashing about and I remember looking around the empty pool.  There were people above talking but not paying any attention to me. They didn't know I was down there and a sudden wave of peaceful calmness came over me, and I remember saying to myself, 'so this is what it's like to drown.'  I was ok with it. I thought of nothing, not my parents or friends, etc. I had a very calm attitude. A wave of complete peace came over me. I felt like I never had before; no worries anymore, just a matter of fact attitude and an acceptance of a certain death.  
   Fear-death experience from near drowning and other experiences.   

    2672.        Debbie B NDE       4/16/2011.      NDE 5134.             I was met by my mother who had passed two years earlier. From a distance, I saw family members that had also passed. My mother told me to come with her. We walked down this long sandy path. When I saw a clearing, I heard a sound from behind me that made me stop in my tracks. I was told that it was not my time yet - that my husband and I had a lot to do and that many people would be counting on us.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2671.        Judi M Probable NDE       1/22/2011.      Probable NDE 22469.             I'd then be directed to start grinding a type of grain with a mortar and pestle. I'd chat with others at the scene. I didn't feel particularly important, like a leader. I feel like support to a larger group. The work and chatting seemed to last a while. It felt so natural and peaceful. Then, when, in real life, treatments would restore my vital signs and doctors would call my name, and I went into a lighter coma stage, the man said ‘they are calling for you. You have to go back. We'll be here when you return.’  
   Probable NDE due to blood illness.  Interesting experience in apparent 16th century town.   

    2670.        Willem NDE       4/5/2011.      NDE 5133.       From the Netherlands.      Then I came into a tunnel/or better; it felt like I went up in spirals. The light was blue-green (it could have been the water) and there was a peaceful sound (not music but 'sound'). I arrived and there was a 'person in light' waiting. He/she took me by the hand and we just stood there for a while. It felt like getting home; more THIS WAS HOME. The person in the light and I were totally equal; there was only love without any boundary. And then I was told to go back. I did not want to; I was ordered to go back because there were 'things for me to do down there'.  
   NDE due to drowning at age two. From the Netherlands, shared in English.   

    2669.        Dawn W NDE       4/5/2011.      NDE 5132.             I was in a dark warm breezy place.  It was full of stars. Voices where speaking, though not out of their mouths.  The people looked like film negatives and I know they were failing somehow. There was a debate with another entity about my fate.  I couldn't see him.  I could only feel the knowledge and peace, and joy, like the answer to every question I ever had was answered.  
   NDE due to accident.   

    2668.        Margaret J NDE       4/5/2011.      NDE 5131.             The next thing I knew I was jumping on the clouds, I thought this is great this is wonderful I don't care about all those people I left behind. It was so very beautiful. Years later, as I got to fly on a plane, I saw the same beautiful look of those clouds.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2667.        Robert E NDE       4/5/2011.      NDE 5130.             Next thing I knew, I was on a beach and sky was so beautiful and bright, the sand was so white everything was so peaceful. Then a figure appeared from a distance that looked like a lady holding a child by the hand. The figure waved at me once then again and said, 'No, go back.'  
   NDE due to episode of unconsciousness during illness.   

    2666.        Geary S NDE       4/5/2011.      NDE 5129.             As I floated up to the ceiling area, I was watching the medical team working to place a tube down my throat so they could pump my stomach. I watched them while they were talking back and forth with each other and working on me at the same time. I seemed to float over the wall.  I was above the hallway just outside the door to the room that I was in. I remember seeing a nurse standing in the hallway, right below me and she was writing something on a small tablet. When she finished writing, she slipped the tablet and the pen into one of the pockets of her uniform. The pocket was located on the skirt portion of her uniform, about an arm's length down.  
   NDE due to accidental overdose.   

    2665.        Karen W Probable NDE       4/5/2011.      Probable NDE 5126.             I was reaching toward the light with my right arm - wanted to go into the light. No thoughts of anything else at all - I could make out the figure from a distance inside the light, which I KNEW was the Resurrected Christ. He had his Right hand up, along with his index and middle fingers only. As I got closer, those two fingers went down and that's when I went backwards with unimaginable G-force. I explain it to people in my area as 'like going in reverse on the 'Laser Loop', and older roller-coaster at nearby Kennywood Park, now defunct. I DID NOT WANT TO GO BACK!!!!!!!  
   Probable NDE due to bleeding due to diverticula.   

    2664.        Joy R NDE       1/16/2011.      NDE 22463.             At some point, I was floating in the air, not my body, but my spirit. I saw a crowd gathering on the landing by the pool and I was able to see that it was me on the floor. I saw my friends Fay and Jess crying while everyone was screaming call the ambulance, 'Is she ok?' It was then that some force drew me to the most beautiful and peaceful place that I have ever experienced.  
   NDE due to drowning at age 14.   

    2663.        Alfredo NDE       4/5/2011.      NDE 5064.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      Then I started to see a far distant light and my happiness and placidness went on growing. As I approached the light, I could see that it came from a door, or a frame without a door, as if a white rectangle were drawn on a black card. The light, which shone from this door, bears no comparison even with the light of a thousand stars together, the luminosity was indescribable, but incredibly, it did not harm the eyes. When I was near the door, I saw a woman, outside in the void, with hair down to her waist. She wore a white gown to the ankles and beckoned me with her left hand, gesturing for me to approach her.  
   NDE from childhood fainting game.   

    2662.        Nilda P NDE       4/5/2011.      NDE 5123.       From Brazil. Original in Portuguese, translated to English by C. Rodrigues.      He said, 'I am going to show you some things.' Then, in the distance, I saw a globe that looked like the moon during an eclipse. He said, 'That is the Earth,' and I saw many points of light in the globe. Then he said, 'In every point of light there is someone praying, if all the people on Earth could pray, it would look like that,' and the Earth became illuminated as the sun. 'But so is not,' and the globe darkened again.  
   Remarkable NDE!   

    2661.        Mary I Probable NDE       4/2/2011.      Probable NDE 5110.       From Portugal. Original in Portuguese, translated into English by C. Rodrigues.      My eyes were focused on the switch when I noticed people rushing into my bedroom. I saw a hand moving closer to the switch and at this moment, and before the light was on, I felt that I was 'ascending'. I felt great relief, I had no more pain or discomfort, and I had come out from a situation that in all aspects was terrible. I looked downwards full of curiosity, I tried to look at me but I couldn't see myself clearly, just a figure half hidden by the people around; my bed was away from the wall and there were many people moving on both sides of the bed.  
   Beginnings of an OBE from abortion complications.

After a few days was able to recall what occurred out of my present body.

    2659.        Sylvianne R Possible NDE       3/28/2011.      Possible NDE 5060.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Magalie.      I felt myself leaving, as if I were being sucked in towards a tunnel that was illuminated with a bright yellow light (like the one you can see on a summer morning while watching a sunrise). I was floating. I felt good - and mainly I wasn't feeling pain anymore - it was all gone. I rested while I was floating, I felt marvelously great. I couldn't see myself floating in the light (although I could feel it happening,) but I understood it to be my Self. When I looked down, I saw my husband sleeping and I saw my body beside him. Seeing this, suddenly I panicked and didn't want to be sucked into the tunnel.  
   Possible NDE from pain.   

    2658.        Denise NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5122.             There were colors - brilliant colors everywhere. I was an array of beautiful moving, shimmering, vibrating, and colors. He came closer and said, 'Do you understand now?' I realized I was pure energy, spirit, and part of a flowing consciousness; while still remaining 'Denise'. At that moment, he shared his name, 'John'. As we moved, he also shared with me what was happening.  
   Exceptional NDE due to illness, and a must read. Remarkable apparent shared NDE with person unknown to her. Remarkable encounter with 'John' with discussion of free will. Later mystical experience led to identification of who John was.   

    2657.        Carrie S NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5124.             I remember being above my bed and watching everything from above. I heard everything the doctors and nurses said but I could not respond. In the corner of the room above the bed was a good friend who had died the year before. There was a bright light behind her. Then she hugged me and told me to go back down.  
   NDE due to anaphylactic allergic reaction.   

    2656.        Patricia B NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5125.             As I panicked and struggled to breathe and survive, a wave came. I went under and the next thing I knew I was up above the water looking down at all the people along the shoreline watching in fear. I saw up above in a distance I can't describe groups of people standing in the light. The light was very bright. It was very calm, peaceful, quiet, comforting. It felt like they were beckoning me and I begged them not to take me yet. My whole life flashed before me. I told them my loved ones needed me, would miss me too much, and wouldn't understand and that I wasn't ready to go yet with them. There seemed to be other groups of majestic people in the infinite distance, in a vast perspective, floating together in groups, not necessarily familiar, in different layers, in the distance in the light. I felt at ease, understood, loved and comforted, peaceful, but driven to go back to my body and survive.  
   NDE due to drowning.   

    2655.        Manuel H NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5121.             Then I was sitting next to my then recently deceased son. It was really bright. I had a feeling of instant pain, then nothing. I saw my life, and I questioned my existence here and wondered about my daughter too. My son asked me in a calm voice, (he seemed to be really at peace, too.) 'What are you going to do? Are you going to come with me, or not?' I went with him and found myself sitting in a church with him. My head was bowed, and he was praying with me. (Note: In life, my son had not been a very religious man.)  
   NDE due to drug overdose. This experience occurred a few days prior to it being shared.   

    2654.        CL Possible NDE       3/28/2011.      Possible NDE 5120.             For a few seconds, I could feel the doctor cutting me. It was an incredibly hot, hot feeling. I was aware of what was going on and the fact that I could feel the doctor cutting me, but I could not communicate this with anyone. I could not speak and I could not open my eyes or move. I'm told that that probably was the anesthesia starting to work. Anyway, the next thing I knew, I was waking up and I had this incredible need to write down all these images and voices and feelings that I had had. I spoke to the doctor and one of the nurses who were in the operating room and they confirmed some of the events that were so vivid to me.  
   Possible NDE due to internal bleeding and emergency surgery.   

    2653.        Katalin F NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5118.             As soon as I resigned to go rather than defy him, the decision was made.  We instantly and with great force, moved away from the light.  As we were moving, I watched him in amazement.  He looked very much like a God in the form of a lightning bolt. So handsome and strong and powerful! There we were back in the river next to my body and without hesitation he put his mouth over my body's mouth and he breathed life back into it and in an instant he was gone as if he had never even been there. I felt his absence it was so dark, cold, lonely, and pointless without him. I watched my body come up to catch my first breath.  
   NDE at age sixteen from drowning. Remarkable description of apparent supernatural assistance with escape from drowning.   

    2652.        Marianna C NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5115.       From Canada.      I remember my sister and I trying to swim back to shore. I was concerned for my sister we held hands for a bit. I recall men with ropes swimming into the beach. Then being pulled down into the water. Bright lights turned into the multicolor vision and then into a black darkness.  
   NDE due to drowning.   

    2651.        Glenda Probable NDE       1/4/2013 & 3/28/2011.      Probable NDE 5112/6553.             I got about two foot away from my body and it was totally dark, and I remember feeling total weightlessness, and at the same time I was totally void of any emotion at all.  Then, without hearing a voice, I 'knew' that I was being told to go back into my body, and I remember saying, 'Ok.'  Then, a split second later, I was back in my body.  
   Probable NDE due to stated heart attack.   

    2650.        Harold N NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5107.       From Australia.      I saw I was 'flying' over a bay, which was a deep blue and had lovely sandy beaches. Just out from the bay was what appeared to be a volcanic tropical island. The sun was high in the sky. Sitting at anchor in the bay was an unusual large sailing ship with one huge sail but with multiple decks - at least three. There were tiny people crowding the uppermost deck of the sailing ship and beckoning to me.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest following procedure for treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.   

    2649.        Martina D NDE       3/28/2011.      NDE 5105.       From Canada.      I wasn't walking or floating, it's like someone was carrying me but couldn't see who it was. Then the shadowy lights got bigger and the more I was moving through the path I guess the more the light got brighter. Then I remember asking myself clearly if I was still under water but wasn't feeling pain of out of breath, all I wanted is to see why it was so bright. That's when I saw and felt a presence reaching for me, no face, no body, just shadowy lines in a form of a 'v' all in white. I'm not sure if it was reaching for me but at that moment I felt pushed away like I have been sucked out a tube.  
   NDE at the age of four from drowning.   

    2648.        Lorraine J NDE       3/22/2011.      NDE 5045.       From Germany. Original in German, translated to English by Amy.      I was flying through a tunnel very fast but it felt weird. I heard a noise, like a wind sound. It was all so crazy! The tunnel was black, pitch-black. Then it got light again. At the end of the tunnel was a light. The walls of the tunnel kept moving away from one another. It felt like I was in a cave with smooth walls. It seemed very big and damp. I didn't know what I was doing here and it seemed as though a long time had passed. This place seemed familiar but I couldn't put my finger on it. I waited in the middle of the tunnel or cave.  
   Interesting NDE as a child where she was shown her future husband and told he would be ill but survive - and it did come to pass. She was also told that she would not remember her NDE until later.   

    2647.        Robert B Probable NDE       3/22/2011.      Probable NDE 5050.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Magalie.      During surgery, I didn't see myself outside of my body. I remember this beautiful landscape: a garden, a little stream, a bridge and this amazing and intense light. I had a conversation with a lady who was near a tree. The conversation was through our thoughts and she kept smiling, her lips were not moving. Her message was clear: I had to go back because I still had things to accomplish. I remember resisting and wanting to stay with her because I finally felt at peace. Then, there was this man on the other side of the bridge. He only glanced at me once and I knew I couldn't stay.  
   Probable NDE from surgery complications.   

    2646.        Renate NDE       3/21/2011.      NDE 5016.       From Austria. Original in German, translated to English by Amy.      Then I was drawn into a tunnel. It was narrow but didn't have hard walls. I was pulled through this tunnel. At the other end was an incredible bright warm white light, but it wasn't blinding. There stood a being with a beautiful face and everything around him was bright light, but the being didn't have wings. I knew it was an angel and he emanated so much love. The whole area was beautiful, bright, and warm.  
   NDE from anaphylactic shock.   

    2645.        Roberto Z NDE       3/21/2011.      NDE 4991.       From Italy. Original in Italian, translated to English by Maurizio B.      After fainting, I remember I was looking at the opposite wall.  Suddenly, a fissure was opened from which a wonderful white enveloping light came. The crack widened and I felt drawn to it, while I could see myself covered in blood (I was looking from above) lying on the bed with no doctors around me. I saw blood on the floor. I felt I wanted to come across extremely strongly.  
   NDE from hematoma/stomach bleeding.   

    2644.        Daniel P NDE       3/20/2011.      NDE 5102.             I was looking down at myself in the hospital I think but not sure - all I know is that as nice as this felt, I had the need to get back to this body and what was going on. It was like a struggle because I had this wonderful sensation knowing that this was a definite good warm place and that I had been forgiven. Yet the desire to get back was overwhelming and I tried to cry out and nothing would come out, not a sound. I kept yelling and saying I wanted to come home and there was nothing, no sound to be heard anywhere, just total peace and tranquility and warmth.  
   NDE from being shot.   

    2643.        Lynn S NDE       3/20/2011.      NDE 5098.             I was surrounded by intense brightness that seemed to funnel ahead of me, there was warmth and pleasantness with it... I went on to medical school and now have the privilege to care for many wonderful people, and some, at the time of their death. I know that what happened to me was real. It was not shock, or a dream.  
   NDE from physician due to ruptured appendicitis.   

    2642.        Chris M NDE       3/20/2011.      NDE 5096.             I saw both of my grandmothers. They both hugged me and my Dad's Mom took my hand and said to come on she had someone she wanted me to meet. We walked on this long golden road. It was one sheet of gold so wide you could fit a thousand people across it. I saw a man with long white hair and robe with gold trim playing with children. He arose, marshaled the kids away, and walked towards us. When He reached us, my Grandma said, 'Honey, this is your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.' He touched my forehead with two fingers of His left hand and said, 'It's not your time. You cannot stay, you things to do for Me.' I said that I was home and didn't want to leave. He said, 'You have to go. When it is your time I will call for you so, be ready.'  
   NDE due to heart attack and cardiac arrest.   

    2641.        David J Probable NDE       3/20/2011.      Probable NDE 5095.             With one angel in front and two on the side, we went up high in the clouds. Then, we started moving horizontally going faster than an airplane, and they did not need wings to fly. I thought to myself, 'Shouldn't friction be causing me pain from wind pressure?' The angel in front spoke without using his mouth. He stated 'There's no friction here.' I said mind-to-mind, 'Why isn't gravity making me fall?' He replied 'There's no gravity here.' I remembered learning that temperature in the clouds is extremely cold and I thought, 'Why aren't I cold?' 'There's no cold here,' was the response. I started to think about my job and university and the angel told me 'THERE'S NO STRESS HERE!'  
   Probable NDE after hemorrhagic stroke.

    2639.        Janet M NDE       3/14/2011.      NDE 5092.       From the UK.      The alive me was in a different dimension very strong, very powerful, very alive so, I went down to them. Down to my body into my body I not so much as made a choice, as the power of truth, for not knowing how else to put it, was so strong it gave no other choice it simply was. There were no conscious thoughts of I am wanting to stay, or I am wanting to leave or go up or down. Nothing like that just simply allowing the lie of death was unacceptable. It caused instant response the truth, truth had to be seen given done.  
   NDE due to reaction to illegal drug injection.   

    2638.        Lawrence J Possible NDE       3/14/2011.      Possible NDE 5091.             While having a heart attack and being in the doctor's clinic and being attended to, I saw an extremely bright light and experienced a great calming and thought to myself that I was going to die and thought 'Well, this is going to be a new experience.'  
   Possible NDE due to heart attack.   

    2637.        Annie Probable NDE       3/14/2011.      Probable NDE 5087.       From Australia.      My body was gone, I was a concentration of those colors/energies. At the time, I felt complete. I had reached the perfection in my being - not as a human being but as a part of a great source of energy. I recovered the ultimate knowledge by becoming that energy again. It was fulfilling and intense. After what felt like an eternity, I progressively felt heavier. I realized I had to go back. At the time, I felt like I had a choice to make. Going back to start or finish something in my human body. I knew through the seven energies/colors that I would have to sacrifice something to go back.  
   Probable NDE due to blood loss.   

    2636.        Guy VL NDE       3/14/2011.      NDE 5084.       From Belgium.      I was projected to the light and when I came back through the tunnel, I was on the ceiling of the emergency room and I saw a body on the operating room table. I didn't recognize my body right away. I saw the nurses and the doctor taking off their gloves and I then recognized my body and went back into it. I heard the doctor say, 'He is back.'  
   NDE from Belgium due to bike accident.   

    2635.        Randy M NDE       3/13/2011.      NDE 5083.             The first thing I felt was that I had no body, I felt like I was going to fall but then realized I could not. I realized that I had all my faculties and could still reason. At that moment, I felt the presence of my creator and that my struggle to believe in a God on earth was over. 'IT' had complete control over me, which was so soothing it is indescribable. 'IT' was emanating an unconditional love of 'ITSELF' and for me. My GOD was taking me and it felt so good. I felt no pain anymore nor any of the other miseries felt on earth, including time, there was no time. I was in total comfort.  
   NDE due to seizure, likely due to alcohol withdrawal.   

    2634.        Joyce Y NDE       3/13/2011.      NDE 5082.             I remember saying, 'Oh, Mom.' What I remember next was being somewhere near the ceiling in the corner of the room at the end by head of the bed. I saw nurses beside the bed, taking my blood pressure. I have no recollection of what else they were doing. I distinctly remember looking down at them working on me.  
   NDE following delivery from hypotension.   

    2633.        Eric R Possible NDE       3/13/2011.      Possible NDE 5054.       From Belgium. Original in Dutch, translated to English by Annelies.      When I entered that room I saw a large black book on a sort of altar. I went closer and I opened that book. The first page had only one word written on it and that word was 'languages'. It is evident now that I love to write poems and everyone says I have a real talent. After that we went to the room which said 'love'. I went in and in the center of the room was a very hazy grey cloud. I went closer and inside the cloud I encountered Joke (my first love) and also Lydia (a girl I have lived together with for three years). I didn't know what to do there so I decided to go outside again.  
   Probable NDE from allergic reaction to sleeping pills.   

    2632.        Robert B Dream vs. Intensive Care Unit Psychosis       3/6/2011.      Dream/ICU Psychosis 5074.             Two shadowy figures with long ton heads slinked in front and back of the urns as if they were in some slow ritual dance.  The floors of the hospital were at right angles to each other making it difficult to move from one floor to another. Young hospital interns laid a few pranks on me, one of which involved setting a fire. One nurse was kind to me but got very cross when I said I enacted to leave.  
   Dream vs. Intensive Care Unit Psychosis.  Posted to illustrate the difference between NDEs and experiences of altered stated of consciousness that are not NDEs. Those familiar with NDEs will easily see the difference.   

    2631.        Patricia Z NDE       3/6/2011.      NDE 5076.             I saw my friends working on me. I heard their voices but only saw the female paramedics face. Then I woke up at the hospital but I was out of my body this time and, as I explain later in this survey, I saw my doctor and I could hear them say his name. All the other doctors had hospital shoes on but my doctor had these real cool tennis shoes on. That's what I remember most. Then I was in a type of tunnel and that's where this guy like in shadow form told me it wasn't my time yet.  
   NDE due to heart attack. OBE - saw doctor's distinctive tennis shoes.   

    2630.        Tony M Probable NDE       3/6/2011.      Probable NDE 5075.       From Canada.      Surprisingly, I did not feel the flames of this hellish pit, but was still horrified as I could hear the many screams of the innumerable souls condemned to this seemingly eternal fate. I could see nothing but flames surrounding me. I cried out in horror as the scene switched to a disturbingly hideous and disgusting demon who towered over me, quite similar to a skyscraper next to a human being. I got the impression that this being was made out of pure hate and terror.  
   Probable NDE due to complication after surgery. Hellish experience.   

    2629.        Lisa H NDE       3/6/2011.      NDE 5073.             Two Angelic Beings of Light who seemed to be eight feet tall with Mediterranean skin and dark blue piercing eyes, escorted me from the lake into the light. They wore long robes without actual angel wings.  
   NDE due to boating accident with head injury.   

    2628.        Nubia Possible NDE       3/4/2011.      Possible NDE 5031.       Original in Spanish, translated to English by Susana.      I am not sure how long it took but my pain slowly subsided and when I fell asleep I saw my body lying on the hospital bed. I also saw myself standing by my side. I felt as if I were sinking into a deep well and when I was about to reach the bottom it was no longer a well but a very long and dark tunnel. I felt an inexplicable calm. I felt no pain but I was scared in that darkness. There was no one around, only me. Suddenly I saw a very brilliant white dot, like a light. I ran to reach it and it started to get larger and more brilliant. When I reached the entrance, everything became illuminated and glowing and I was able to leave there.  
   Possible NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2627.        Maria J NDE       3/4/2011.      NDE 5028.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      I was no longer afraid, and I began to notice that my body had no weight, it was as if I was stuck to the ceiling of the room. From above I could see the bed, my inert body and the crib with my daughter in it; I felt no pain at all. Then the moment of darkness came, with no sense of time, but I know that I was fine, peaceful, with no cares, feeling warm. I know there was a small and brilliant light far, far away, though I could sense it behind me rather than see it with my eyes. But I knew it was there.  
   NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2626.        Cynthia H NDE       3/2/2011.      NDE 5071.             'I know you love me and all life, but if you really love all of us continuously without end, then how can You send people to hell throughout eternity?' He said, 'Cindy I do love all life without end. Some people chose to go to hell, I have already forgiven them; but they must forgive themselves.'  
   NDE at age twelve due to a pinealoma (a tumor of the pineal gland, located in the central part of the brain). Exceptional NDE, including interaction with God, who allowed her to ask seven questions which were answered.   

    2625.        Monty D NDE       3/2/2011.      NDE 5070.             I could see myself.  I was surrounded by a total darkness, as if everyone had shut out all the lights in the room, but it felt like it was huge, I had a single light shining down on me from up above, other than that it was all pitch black. I could see myself and I was telling myself, 'You have to wake up.' I was just repeating this to myself and looking around at the emptiness. I felt like I wasn't alone, but I didn't see anything other than the light above shining down, almost like a spotlight.  
   NDE due to auto accident. He was considered dead, and covered with a sheet in preparation to go to the morgue.   

    2624.        Gregory C NDE       3/2/2011.      NDE 5068.             Four days later I was being prepared for an angiogram, a shoulder length blond entered my room and wanted to interview me about my experience in the emergency room. I agreed to the interview and after it was over, she was wiping tears from her eyes. 'Why are you crying if this event happens all the time?' 'Because you are the first that saw things you couldn't have ever seen. You were straight line with your eyes closed and yet witnessed one of the nurse's trip over your wife's foot, and then you were correct about the brunette nurse that took your wife away, and thirdly you saw the bald spot on the top of the Chinese doctor's head. You could not have seen this unless you had left your body.' Apparently people see lights and hear what's going on around them when their heart stops, but I was able to view and hear everything going on while flat on my back with my eyes closed and my heart stopped.  
   NDE due to heart attack with cardiac arrest. Remarkable verification of OBE observation.   

    2623.        Billy S NDEs       3/2/2011.      NDEs 5067/5069.             I only recall walking and talking to Jesus. I didn't seem to have to talk, because it was simply understood between him and me. Also, we were walking on a shimmering road that was translucent, yet not totally. I don't recall music at all, but I was concentrating on Jesus. We didn't talk all that long, but it is pretty vivid to this day. I was upset and disappointed that he said I had to go back.  
   NDE at age eleven due to febrile illness. Also an NDE due to being choked as part of Marine training.    

    2622.        David O NDE       3/2/2011.      NDE 5066.             I became aware at some point of being in a place of great expansion and light and being complete and very peaceful. I think I was moving toward more light, though, it could be that I was in the full light already. I was not aware of anybody, nor any beings around me. But I do remember looking down on my worried and grieving parents. I also remember being given a choice as to whether I would return to the living and it was in seeing my parents in so much distress and having a vision of my mother's great anguish in the future, if I did not return, that I chose to return. I remember quite distinctly knowing that it was for them that I returned and not because life on earth was so much fuller and more important than where I was. I felt at home and complete where I was and unlimited. One could say blissful.  
   NDE due to car accident at age five. Contributor has a doctorate level degree in spite of the severe trauma he experienced at age five. Shared fifty years later.   

    2621.        Cynthia H NDE       3/1/2011.      NDE 5063.             I instantly flew out of my body and found myself standing outside of myself at my right shoulder. I watched as another nurse grabbed a bottle(s) off a shelf. Next recollection I have was a presence (dark with wings?) enveloping me from behind and telling me 'NO.' Then I felt suspended in some sort of colorless void without any senses, but a feeling of peace (or absence of fear). Slowly over the next two days I had a dawning awareness of being enveloped in a warm white light, cocooned in that golden white light, safe.  
   NDE due to post-surgical complication.   

    2620.        Graeme E NDE       3/1/2011.      NDE 5059.       From Australia      This time when they hooked me back up to the machine, something, I don't know what, went wrong. I wasn't getting any air. Every cell in my body started screaming for oxygen, the physical panic was a tidal wave that ripped through me. As the panic  wracked me, sight faded, body sense faded, sound faded and then came the calm.  I found myself disembodied, floating above a crystal clear lake. It was only small, the water shallow with smoothed stones about the size of a spread hand. Lush green foliage with small shiny leaves overhung the water. I was as conscious and able to think as I am here now writing this. Yet I was suffused with the "peace that passes all understanding".  
   NDE due to respiratory failure.   

    2619.        Lisa A NDE       3/1/2011.      NDE 5056.             I felt a Presence with me - and I knew this Presence was our Creator. Through thought, He presented me with a question - 'Do you really want to hurt your family like this?' He did not stop me but wanted me to weigh the price of my decision - to allow myself to cross the line and die, or to choose life. I argued that no one seemed to care whether I lived or died anyway, so what was the point of life.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt by drowning at age thirteen. Remarkable dialogue with God that saved her life.   

    2618.        Rhonda NDE       3/1/2011.      NDE 5055.             I felt myself come out of the body at my feet. It was slow. All I remember was telling them I was going and I fell over on the bed. The last thing I saw was the doctor jumping up out of his chair. Next, I was in darkness. Went I realized I was in the darkness, I saw a bright Light come to me. It was as white as snow.  
   NDE due to loss of consciousness during heart test.   

    2617.        Lorien B Possible NDE       3/1/2011.      Possible NDE 5053.             I was with God. I understood myself literally to be in his palms. But everything was just light, and pure love. It was the most beautiful feeling I have ever had in my life. God told me that my soul's purpose was healing, and that I could just do hands on healing. There was some information about just doing it like three times a week. It's kind of funny, like God was saying, don't stress about it, your soul needs to do this, but it doesn't have to be a huge deal. Now, there were no words said, it was just understanding that flowed from God to me.  
   Possible NDE at time of biopsy of brain abscess.   

    2616.        Jennifer ADC       9/27/2010.      ADC 31888.             Then, just in a space of a few seconds everything started to click for me. The expression on his face was wrong for our conversation. I had made a joke and he didn't laugh. He told me to fight; He said I would have to fight for his daughter. That I needed to make sure she would be safe, and loved. Again, I knew something wasn't right by the look on his face, it looked almost like regret. No anger, no fear, more like disappointment. But, still I kept talking as if we were speaking about him leaving the country. I said 'Jamie, I will take care of your daughter, I would give my life to see that she is safe and happy.' I had a son that passed away ten years ago, that is when I knew Jamie had said goodbye, when he said 'Take care of mine; I got yours' I knew he meant my son.  
   Exceptional ADC dream around time of death of her brother, before she knew he had died.  Remarkable information from brother about need to fight for the custody of his daughter.   

    2615.        Alvaro A NDE       2/15/2011.      NDE 5039.       From Mexico.      I know that there is a 'presence' of somebody at my right side, I didn't see anybody. I started walking, and watched to my left a kind of long stone wall with barred windows, full of people, they screamed 'Help me!' but their mouths don't open, I listened more. I asked the presence, 'Who are they?' and 'he' replied, 'Not yet.' I continued straight ahead and saw a huge and beautiful garden full of people dressed in white, who were turning to see a sort of a stoned wall, from which there was a blinding light. This wall had some closed doors. One more time I asked: 'Who are they?' and the same answer: 'Not yet.' We continued walking toward the front of one of the doors and saw light through the cracks in them. We stopped at the door and I asked: 'What's behind?' and the same answer: 'Not yet.'  
   NDE from going unconscious from pain.   

    2614.        Gregory W NDE       2/12/2011.      NDE 5036.             I'm red/green color blind and am visually impaired. Yet, I saw twelve different colors that made up the wall. The colors where not blended but were clearly defined and each was the same height as the next. I also noted that the content or the making of the walls was solid stone and then realized that it was pure stone.  
   NDE due to insulin reaction. Interesting in that although he has red-green color blindness, he was able to distinguish green.   

    2613.        Charlotte A NDE       2/12/2011.      NDE 5049.             I had a double mastectomy and tug-flap reconstruction. I lost a great deal of blood and they did not have enough to transfuse. My blood pressure dropped and I flat lined for a bit. I was initially delirious and frightened by darkness and a sense of a void. However, shortly after it all began, I felt encompassed by light (I didn't see it, I felt it) and an unearthly awareness from someone/thing imparted the knowledge that I was going to be fine. It wasn't about life or death just that everything was going to be fine. I felt connected to a larger energy than I have known in my lucid life.  
   NDE due to blood loss following surgery.   

    2612.        Jim T Possible NDE       2/12/2011.      Possible NDE 5043.             I am floating at the ceiling level directly above my body watching and listening as the dentist pulled the teeth. I remember noticing how hard he had to work to get the teeth to come out.  I remember that there was quite a bit of blood. I did not float back to my body but sense that I went to sleep again and woke up in the dentist chair.  
   Possible NDE due to dental procedure under anesthesia around age eight to twelve.   

    2611.        William L Possible NDE       2/12/2011 & 3/20/2022.      NDE 5042/9363.       From Canada.      There were No trees or bushes. I couldn’t see any birds flying or animals scurrying about the landscape. It was a dead world as far as I could see or tell. Life had once been here but had long gone away. There were remnants of trees. Buildings that once housed people but had become broken down and destroyed. Similarly like a post war city. Then, I was given the sensation of sound. 
   ICU experience or possibly a NDE from overdose of aspirin.  Hellish experience.   

    2610.        Heather I Probable NDE       2/12/2011.      Probable NDE 5041.             It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I felt like I knew everything and recognized this knowing was different from what my thoughts and feelings had been before. I begged to come back, but only because I have two young daughters... I was not judged by God, but rather by myself. I saw the way things 'really are' and thought, 'Why didn't I ever figure that out.' It seems so simple. They were things about spirituality, humanity and physics.  
   Probable NDE with TBI (traumatic brain injury).   

    2609.        Morris M Probable NDE       2/12/2011.      Probable NDE 5038.             I was up in corner of the room looking down a tunnel, grayish or white in color and cloudy, at my body and the doctor who was prepping me. I could see the blue garments that were over my body and the area above my appendix exposed. I could see him putting iodine on me in a circular motion directly over the appendix area.  
   OBE early in surgery during prepping skin for surgery.   

    2608.        Denise M NDE       2/12/2011.      NDE 5037.             I had the sensation that I was floating down a path or tunnel, I wasn't in body form anymore, and saw a very bright light, like fluorescent. I knew I was dead, but yet I could still think because I thought to myself, 'So, this is what it's like to be dead.' It wasn't a bad thing. I had an immense feeling of love and warmth - like being engulfed in a secure, warm blanket. It was the most intense feeling I have ever felt. I didn't see anyone as others have described, but I felt like I had been down this path before and it was familiar and I didn't want to leave it.  
   NDE due to anesthetic complication. Interesting 'anesthetic awareness' due to insufficient anesthesia followed by NDE, and they were clearly two distinctly different experiences.   

    2607.        Ruben Probable NDE       2/12/2011.      Probable NDE 5026.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Susana.      Everything was black with colored spheres turning, and what sounded like music (although this I don't remember too well). I felt vibrations. I am not sure whether the music was there or whether I was imagining it. I felt very well.  
   Probable NDE from going unconscious.   

    2606.        Louis C NDE       2/6/2011.      NDE 5035.             When I turned to look the most attractive Indian woman was holding me in her arms under this big tree that did not have any leaves (looked like a massive oak tree). I could see a lot of different Indians walking and singing, drums pounding, then the snow started to fall. When it would fall on my face, she would wipe it off. Then she looked up, so did I.  That's when I saw a bright light. It looked like boiling water then it started to pull me into the light, she stood there with her arms out. When I turned to look at the light I woke up, I was in the room. Later my mom told me that I died three times, they almost lost me.  
   NDE due to surgical complication at age six. Contributor has partial Native American ancestry.   

    2605.        Victoria D NDE       2/6/2011.      NDE 5032.       From Australia.      I felt like I had split in two with my physical body remaining on the ground. The other element was where my awareness was and it felt as if this was a ball of energy (I could not see this because my awareness was gone from my physical body). The energy ball hovered at the level of my eyes about ten centimeters away from my physical body's face and watched. I could see the physical body screaming in pain and crying but I felt no connection to that person. After what seemed like an eternity, I travelled as the energy ball up to a place.  
   NDE due to fifty meter fall.   

    2604.        Jim T Probable NDE       2/6/2011.      Probable NDE 5029.             Suddenly I was standing there looking at myself. I was totally calm as it was a long familiar experience that I welcomed.  I walked around looking at the accident and saw everything spread all over.  
   Probable NDE from tractor accident and other experiences.   

    2603.        LaVall M NDE       2/6/2011.      NDE 5025.             I was conscious for maybe one or two minutes, and the next thing I saw was this brilliant white area, and I knew I was there, wherever there was. I cannot even accurately describe the 'Entities' that were with me, they were not physical Beings, but rather I had a sense of this intelligence that I felt very comfortable with, a sense that I was at home, a feeling of total acceptance, compassion and total love, almost euphoric. I was not conscious of being in a physical body, but at the time, that thought never crossed my mind. These Entities communicated in a telepathic way, it seemed that their thoughts originated within me, and I was communicating with them in a similar way.  
   NDE and probable NDE. Probable NDE at age thirteen due to drowning. NDE at age fifty due to diabetic hyperglycemia.   

    2602.        Stephen S NDE       2/6/2011.      NDE 5024.             The next thing I remember was looking down on myself being attended to by two doctors and two nurses trying to revive me. I was totally detached from my body. All the pain that I had been suffering was gone. There was a feeling of complete comfort, ease, enlightenment, and freedom. I was cognizant energy with no body or physical being. The best word for what I felt was ultimate bliss. As the doctors revived me, I could feel all of the stress, pain and physical burdens returning and I did not want to go back. I felt myself being drawn back into my body.  
   NDE during medical procedure for illness.   

    2601.        Robert H NDE       1/16/2011.      Shared NDE 22441.             I was also wearing the same things and standing behind another doctor.  I looked over his shoulder and saw me there on the Emergency Room bed.  So, I went out the double doors leaving the Emergency Room, and found myself opening the front door of my house.  I walked down the hallway to my bedroom.  I stood at the foot of my bed where my wife was asleep.  I reached down and shook her legs.  She jumped up and called my name.  The phone rang in the kitchen.  She got out of bed and I let her pass by me.  I followed her down the hall way as far as the front door.  As she continued to go to the kitchen, I said I have to get back now and I love you.  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident.  Remarkable physical contact with wife in OBE state prior to her being aware he had an accident.   

    2600.        Yvette R Possible NDE       1/31/2011.      Possible NDE 4999.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Magalie.      A very large being of extreme beauty illuminated everything. He exuded Divine Superiority with his presence. He was bare-foot and he stepped away from the group to face me with all his magnificence. He was wearing a long, immaculate white alb. His arms hung alongside his body with his palms opened. My attention was on his long and stringy fingers and his fine, superb hands. He was observing me with a look of infinite goodness and compassion that reached deep inside my being. JESUS CHRIST appeared to me, wrapped me up with his Divine Presence. His radiance embraced my soul. I could feel him with every fiber of my body. The power of his love wrapped itself around me in a surreal silence - I didn't want to leave him!  
   Possible NDE from the flu, at the very least an OBE and spiritually transformative event!   

    2599.        Jutta P NDE       1/31/2011.      NDE 4971.       From Germany. Original in German, translated to English by Aylin.      I fled into a dark tunnel to hide which suddenly opened in front of me. I went further because I saw light in the distance. The nearer I came to the light, I felt lighter, calmer, and happier - and somehow snug.  The Light got brighter, my body felt slight and an overwhelming feeling of freedom and floating passed through me, it was miraculous and I can't forget it. It was a garden made of light.  
   NDE from Dengue Fever.   

    2597.        Shannique S NDE       1/30/2011.      NDE 5021.             I remember being in what seemed like a tunnel filled by a bright, extremely bright, light. I was flying right by the sun but did not fill the heat.  The light given off by the sun is white, not yellow. The light is the color of a white full moon on a clear night. I was going really fast, flying like superman through this tunnel. There was a sense of comfort, and peace. I was not afraid at all. I did not feel fear, or the sense of missing anything.  
   NDE due to ectopic pregnancy.   

    2596.        Brandy L Possible NDE       1/30/2011.      Possible NDE 5020.       From Indonesia      Suddenly I saw 'me' lying on the bed but 'I' was above my sleeping body with a thin thread of golden light attached between my body and me. I floated upwards and found myself drawn to a great white light. I floated towards the light; I was welcomed by beings of light, I felt unconditional love, no pain, hardships or worries, I was bounced gently (as a floating balloon) in to the Light, where I heard a voice (male) who told me 'It's not yet time, you must go back, your work is not yet done.'  
   Possible NDE due to sleeping experience during a time she was bleeding from an ectopic pregnancy. Contributor is Muslim.   

    2595.        Harry J NDE       1/30/2011.      NDE 5019.             At one point in all of this, I was face to face with my guru, Paramahansa Yogananda, who left the body in 1952. He was laughing uproariously. He was surrounded by bolts of incredibly intense light. In fact, I physically felt, more than saw, the light. The vision seemed to last for only a few seconds but it was absolutely overpowering. I had an intuitive sense that I had, through medical technology, prematurely crossed over into a plane of existence that was waiting for me at some time in the future. I think this is what made Master laugh so hard. I was like a naughty child peeking under the Christmas tree.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest during procedure evaluating a cardiac arrhythmia. Remarkable encounter with his deceased guru that he had been following for many years. Experience happened just several weeks ago.   

    2594.        Doug E Possible NDE       1/30/2011.      Possible NDE 5017.             I found myself in the right corner near the ceiling of my room looking down at my body in the bed. The experience didn't scare me, but felt like this was as normal as getting up in the morning. I then found myself in what I guess you would describe as a tunnel. I say 'describe' because it had no walls, floor, or ceiling. Around me was darkness. I felt like I was on an escalator going forward at a somewhat faster pace. Ahead of me was a light that grew larger as I went forward.  
   Possible NDE from medication (valium) and alcohol.   

    2593.        Tom M NDE       1/30/2011.      NDE 5013.       From Mexico      I began a journey at a great speed through a tunnel of light; all that I have narrated to this point is very vivid in my memory, what seems like a dream is what happened after. I have no clear memory of the events that occurred after the trip in the tunnel of light; in fact, the memory of it seems to me more like a dream than an actual event. In this dream, I arrived somewhere or to be more precise I was intercepted before my arrival.  My dead sister and grandmother told me that it was not yet my time and that I must get back.  
   NDE due to criminal attack.   

    2592.        James S NDE       1/30/2011.      NDE 5011.             I am not certain, but there may have been hills behind the city. The city was golden, either from its own internal light or from a golden light at sunset. There were beautiful trees and flowers and lovely smells. The city awakened in me a desperate yearning to go there, though I don't exactly know why. I could somehow see that there were busy people in the houses, which had windows and flat roofs.  Suddenly I could cross the divide! I felt simply wonderful, with no pain, and I was full of powerful feelings of peacefulness.  
   NDE from allergic reaction. Contributor is a university professor of Religious Studies.   

    2591.        Jack D NDE       1/30/2011.      NDE 5009.             The paramedic turned around and grabbed a defibrillator from the side of him and I watched him hit me once with the paddles. At that moment in time it looked as if I was watching 'snow' on a TV screen then the picture came back and I watched him hit me the second time and again, 'the snow' except I was now conscious and was pissed off that they had 'ruined my dream.'  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest following heroin overdose. Remarkable in that his eight year old son stated that God woke him up at night, told him his father was dying, and told him to get his mother.   

    2590.        Anne T Possible NDE       1/30/2011.      Possible NDE 4983.       From Belgium. Original in French, translated to English by Susana.      While I was under the anesthesia, I saw the same bright void and felt the same sweet warmth. I heard 'Not yet.'  
   Two possible NDEs with the common theme of the light.   

    2589.        Carl H Probable NDE       1/30/2011.      Probable NDE 4975.       From Netherlands. Original in Dutch, translated to English by Annelies.      As real as a dream can be but everything that happened can also be called a dream (real as well); I saw myself, I experienced myself in that dream, a wonderful journey in bliss and swathed in love searching for me. My true home, a part of myself that was left behind. I now also know that it is a very special dream which never leaves you and sparkles on and on - and it is not a nightmare.  :)  
   Apparently he has the interview on a website somewhere, but from what he says you can get a probable NDE from what he describes.   

    2588.        Renee M NDE       1/30/2011 & 1/13/2011.      NDE 6683/22437.             I was watching my life unfold right in front of me like a bad dream only it does not feel bad at all. I could see my surroundings but do not feel any physical pain or emotional stress.  My emotions were heightened as I accelerated into pure light energy where there is no space or time. I felt more alive than I have ever felt in my life. There are no words to describe this ascended transformation. It is not humanly conceivable for man to remotely understand.  
   NDE due to motorbike accident.   

    2587.        Stan ADC       12/6/2009.      Shared ADC 31880.             So last night my best friend and I are driving and I tell her umm I think my mom is next to me hugging me and telling me it’s ok son. My mother is very, very happy. My friend's jaw dropped and she started crying. I thought she would think I was crazy, and she thought I would think she was crazy but at the exact same time, she was watching my mother die in a hospital bed with the doctors working over her. We both had chills and goose bumps at the same time. It was like a rush of energy hitting us both. I can’t believe it happened myself, so I don't expect anyone else to believe it. Yet I swear it happened and I have a witness that shared the experience with me!  
   Shared ADC from mother who died when he was three years old.  Shared at same time, with different content, by friend who was with him.   

    2586.        Rick H NDE       3/29/2005.      NDE 16002.       From Canada      I remember my spirit seeing the most overwhelming and wondrous light. While I was being drawn towards this light, this light became larger. Then I found myself in a lit tunnel of tremendous bright light, and other spirits moving past me. I stood still. Midway between the entrance and exit of this tunnel, I actually reviewed my whole life and existence. I contemplated whether I would want to go back to my life on Earth. It was then that I received an incredible amount of knowledge of a great many matters. Knowledge concerning life, death, and the after-life. I can no longer remember what was shared. I was told by God that I was not going to be allowed to retain this incredible amount of knowledge after I would be sent back into my physical body.  
   NDE from accident.  Head trauma kept him from remembering his experience until 20 years later.   

    2585.        Vivienne P Probable NDE       1/22/2011.      Probable NDE 5008.             I had a general anesthetic for a female sterilization operation. I had the injection and expected to wake up on the ward post-operatively. I am a nurse myself. I woke up and found myself in a darkened room lying on a bed that was made of a fabric with all glittering squares. My immediate thought was 'Where am I?' I expected to be on the ward. The information flowed into my head that I had swallowed my tongue in recovery. I felt fantastic, wonderful, happy and full of joy, which was great as I was suffering from depression at the time. Suddenly in the distance is heard a shout of 'Roll her over!' The next thing I knew I was back in a bed on the recovery ward.  
   Probable NDE during post-surgical event.   

    2584.        Erwin V NDE       1/22/2011.      NDE 5007.       From Belgium.      After that I went into a long dark tunnel where I could see a small light at the end (which constantly became closer and bigger and brighter), where arms and hands came out of the wall, trying to grab me and pulling me back. I floated towards a very clear bright but not blinding light, but somehow never reached it totally. During that, I heard the most heavenly music played ever. I felt fear at first, but afterwards I felt so calm and happy, and felt no pain at all. Somehow, I received the message that I had to return, since this life was not fulfilled yet. At that moment I floated back through the dark tunnel, hands pulling me again, back to where I was before.  
   NDE due to traffic accident at age eleven. From Belgium, shared in English.   

    2583.        Odell H NDE       7/21/2012 & 1/21/2011.      NDE 6339/5003.             Although I don't remember the exact words He spoke to me, He in effect said 'Fear not. Be at peace.' His voice was moderately loud and very melodious. I have been very hard of hearing since infant-hood, and have always struggled with hearing and speech. I struggled to attend school and pass my classes. My poor hearing affected my association with teachers and classmates, and I barely passed my exams and advancement to the next grade levels. But when Jesus spoke to me, I heard Him very succinctly and clearly. His voice was very melodious and sounded like music to my ears.  
   NDE due to drowning at age 11 shared experience 60 years later. Long encounter with Jesus. Interesting in that he was severely hearing impaired, but ‘hearing’ during the NDE was supernormal.   

    2582.        Denise H NDE       1/22/2011.      NDE 5002.             I felt warm and all my pain went away. There was light, I remember, just an illuminated space and nothing else that was visible. I was very aware that I was passing over and I was not afraid. I did not see or think of any of my loved ones. I was completely alone and totally at peace. I remember being surprised that I wasn't afraid. For a second I thought I would die but shortly afterward realized that I had to go back and needed to fight for my life with the EMT. I remember coming back and feeling pain and discomfort but with confidence that I was being looked after and would be okay.  
   NDE due to car accident.   

    2581.        Kinyanjui N NDE       1/22/2011.      NDE 5001.       From Kenya.      Once it was about to cover and sweep me away an amazing bright light appeared and I heard a voice, 'Your life has changed together with your destiny.' From there I saw my uncle who was dead and an angel, they were extraordinary happy. One of them said to me 'You stay in that world.' Then they hugged one another and disappeared. From there I saw myself dancing with the angels in the skies. I could see my dead body behind taken to the morgue, postmortem being done, funeral arrangement, my burial until that evening when I regained my consciousness and discovered that I was not dead.  
   Non-Western NDE from Kenya due to suicide attempt.   

    2580.        George K NDE       1/22/2011.      NDE 4998.             I was walking down a path of some sort and was walking with God. He/She was on my left. I was too scared to turn and look at God. I believe I was scared I would turn to salt - not sure - I do know I did not look at God and I do know God was there. I could feel the warmth. I could hear the voice or really feel the voice. It said, 'You are going to be okay. I have got your back. You are going to heaven one day but not today. In the meantime I want you to tell others about this.'  
   NDE from stroke/seizure by court judge with encounter with God.   

    2579.        Kathleen M NDE       1/22/2011.      NDE 4996.             At some point, I remember looking through what seemed to be a big window and I was on the outside. There were lots of people mulling around, some together, some by themselves. No one spoke or looked my way. None was close to me.  They were all far away, and they were all like black shadows of people, there were a few trees and grass, but the only colors I saw was a pink that covered all I looked at including the people. These people were neither happy nor sad but I didn't have any communication with them. When I came to it dawned on me that those were all of my loved ones who had gone before me, I wished that I could see them clearer and talk with them.  
   NDE due to post-surgical complication.   

    2578.        Gini M Probable NDE       1/22/2011.      Probable NDE 4995.             I was walking up a steep gravel path in the early morning sunshine. I looked down the side of the path and could see the tops of very tall trees way down below me. I came to an enormous hand carved wooden door that went up as far as I could see. I heard a man's voice tell me I could go through the door if I wanted to and I would see my father. I told him that I could not go through because my mother would be left alone.  
   Probable NDE in surgery following an accident. It sounds like father died in the accident, and she apparently first learned this during her NDE. Shared fifty-nine years after experience.   

    2577.        Rick M NDE       1/22/2011.      NDE 4994.             During all this I went to a place that was in the stars. At first my friend Kuauhtli reached out and took me by the hand. Kuauhtli is a Peyote Road Man, who does ceremonies all over the world. He is also a twenty year Sun Dancer, who has given his flesh for twenty years. Kuauhtli led me inside a big yellow school bus. I looked around like where are we going? All Kuauhtli did was smile. There were no words spoken. When we entered the school bus, the interior had transformed to a Peyote Ceremony, and we were in a tepee. There were many Elders sitting around the Sacred Fire. Some looked to be very old. Some I recognized!  
   NDE by Native American with traditional beliefs.   

    2576.        Duane NDE       12/17/2010.      NDE 22433.             I then proceeded to describe what I had seen. I described his exact clothing, and the exact place that he was standing in and I also told him what he had under his arm and what he was doing. I think that it troubled him because his eyes welled up and he has never spoken to me about it since, he did confirm that I was one hundred percent correct on all points. A couple of days later I was informed by a surgeon of what had happened to me during the operation.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest during surgery.  Remarkable verified OBE observations.   

    2575.        Anna NDE       1/22/2011.      NDE 4921.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Susana.      There was a very intense light, I guess it was due to the dilation of my pupils. I dreamt of a place filled with people that I did not know, although I felt that I had a connection to them. Without speaking, they communicated information, images and strange theories. Dreams are always difficult to understand. I found myself in an incredible state of peace and relaxation. I wanted to stay there with those people that I did not know, but suddenly I found myself in front of a woman that I found familiar but I have not been able to recognize her. She had an authoritative yet sweet way about her. She was the only person that spoke to me using her mouth and gestures. She told me that I could not be there. I soon started to hear distant screaming. I begged to stay in that place but she did not allow me and showed me a path.  
   NDE from apparent loss of consciousness in hallway of house.   

    2574.        Glenna A NDE       1/16/2011.      NDE 4990.             I was suddenly outside my body watching my parents, sister and doctors talk about me and my possible condition and fixes. I was screaming this could not be happening.  Then, there was my deceased grandparents at my side. They were perfect and so was everything about the world. I was calmed immediately. They began to lead me through a void towards a light. I was not happy at all to be going the direction they wanted me to go. Closer to the light someone asked me if I wanted to go back.  
   NDE due to ruptured ectopic pregnancy.   

    2573.        Mary W NDE       1/16/2011.      NDE 4989.             We came to the end of the woods and directly ahead, there was a beautiful white light with golden rays. I had the impression there was a city or town encased in that light. I was powerfully drawn to that light but stopped at the end of the path.  I knew if I continued forward, I would not return to my life. I explained that I had just had a baby and that my nineteen-month-old son needed me. I missed him incredibly much at that time and knew I had to be there for him. I said I wanted to keep walking forward but I can't. I have to go back to my son and my new baby.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction from contrast injection for diagnostic procedure. Contributor is a nurse who was a hospice nurse, and teaches a college class on end of life issues.   

    2572.        Tom N NDE       1/16/2011.      NDE 4988.             I then went into anaphylactic shock; and suffered cardiac arrest and complete respiratory failure. As soon as I flat lined my spirit and soul left my body. There were no bright lights, no tunnels leading anywhere, and there was no one there waiting to meet me. I just went above the operating table and watched the efforts to revive me. There was no fear, no anxiety, and no concern, just watching and waiting. I was however aware of my existence and I knew it was still me. The surgical team withdrew blood from one arm and put new blood into my other arm, while they were administered shots of adrenalin. As soon as they resuscitated me, I returned into my body.  
   NDE due to anaphylactic allergic reaction due to wasp stings in Vietnam.   

    2571.        Stephanie C NDE       1/16/2011.      NDE 4984.             The next thing I remember was running through a field by myself in a white gown, picking flowers, smiling, laughing. This was a beautiful place with yellow and white flowers everywhere (I know they weren't daisies, they looked like oversized posies). There was a waterfall down the path with stone on either side of it. I just remember being so happy, felt a huge amount of love, I didn't ever want to leave this place.  
   NDE due to blood loss following c'sarian section delivery.   

    2570.        Riley Probable NDE       12/17/2010.      Probable NDE 22432.             I was hit by a car. The rest is really unspeakable. I was told not to tell, but I am.  
   Probable NDE due to being hit by a car.  Very little information shared.  Experience occurred about a month ago.   

    2569.        Kayleen B NDE       12/12/2010.      NDE 22430.             It was dark in my bathroom. I couldn't breathe anymore. I hit the door. When my then husband came in, I was already on the floor. Next thing I know, I'm watching him trying to bring me back to life. He didn't know what he was doing. He kept hitting my body against the wall and hitting my chest. I felt me 'laughing' and 'smiling'. I then 'floated' or 'flew' to the bedroom where my daughters sleep. I only felt calm and happy for a bit; then, sad and then happy again. I felt free! Just free! Then, suddenly, felt myself be swooped back into my body and then breathed air again.  At first, I was very angry that I was alive again. Then, scared that I was actually dead. Realized in a moment, that I had 2 babies to raise, and got scared again.  
   NDE due to unconsciousness from illness.   

    2568.        CL NDE       11/22/2010.      NDE 22425.             During major surgery on my kidney, the medical staff was unable to control bleeding, which caused my heart to stop.  Surgery was stopped in the attempt to resuscitate me.  All I can remember is thinking that I was dreaming.  At first, I was afraid that I had woken up during surgery and just couldn't move but I didn't feel any pain.  Then, I realized that I was in one of the corners of the operating room, floating there and watching the staff working.  I don't know how long that lasted but I eventually woke up in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for Heart Patients, drifting in and out of consciousness.  I found out a couple of days later what had happened.  
   NDE due to bleeding and cardiac arrest during surgery.   

    2567.        Jean C NDE       1/12/2011.      NDE 4982.             At this time, the stairwell began to fill with what seemed like sunshine to me, but it got really bright. A voice told me I was all right and that she was with me. I do not know who this was, but I felt extremely peaceful. I began to shield my eyes. Suddenly, I felt myself tugged back into my body. My body felt like a glove that was too tight.  
   NDE at age seven due to complication of dental extraction.   

    2566.        Christina T NDE       1/12/2011.      NDE 4980.             Then, all of a sudden when I was in the total darkness, a petal of a White Rose came down from the upper right and wrapped around me. It was warm, loving and so very light. Then a petal came down from the left and surrounded me in an even lighter experience. This continued on and on until I thought I was going to explode in the lightness of being enveloped in the LIGHT of the petals of a White Rose, with each petal surrounding me, until it became brighter and brighter and lighter and lighter, to the point of an all-encompassing explosion into the Light.  
   Remarkable and transformative OBE/STE and brief NDE in hospital.   

    2565.        Ruth B Probable FDE       1/12/2011.      Probable FDE 4974.       From France.      Suddenly I felt afraid too, but in the same split second it was as if I zoomed out (out of myself and out into space). First, I saw the immense ocean, then countries alongside, then earth and the galaxy, then the universe, as I was pulled into 'heaven'. As my perspective widened and widened it was accompanied by insights - suddenly I knew how water, climates, the physics worked together, then how people fitted in, how earth was ruled, what was important and what not, then how it all fitted into the universe. I understood 'the system' through and through, how it was meant to be.  
   Probable fear-death experience at age ten with remarkable insights.   

    2564.        Lisa L Possible NDE       1/12/2011.      Shared Possible NDE 4973.             A few feet beyond where I was standing, the tunnel ended and there was a large area of just pure, white light. I could see beings dressed in white flying or moving about within the light. With me inside of the tunnel was my mother. We were talking for a time, though I have never been able to recall what we were talking about. It seems as though we were together for a while, though again, I'm not sure how long it was.  
   Remarkable encounter in tunnel with her mother who was in a coma at the time. Shared OBE, possible NDE during surgery.   

    2563.        Lynn NDE       1/12/2011.      NDE 4972.             Then I felt joy and acceptance form many thousands of people. I thought, 'No, I don't deserve to go to this wonderful loving place.' The people looking at me said wordlessly, 'We know you. We are so happy to have you back with us.'  I turned and checked in with my body, I saw the code team working. Chest tubes were inserted. I knew each person there. I knew their name, what they were thinking - it was as if I could be everywhere at once.  Focusing my attention again on the new world I was entering many were excited to show me the answers about life I had asked so many times. As I saw them, I felt tremendous peace and joy. Everything was as it should be.  Suddenly a voice said, 'Stop! It is not her time.'  
   NDE due to complication following accident. Interesting comparison of OBE at accident scene, and OBE with NDE a few days later.   

    2562.        Nigel R NDE       4/19/2002.      Secondhand NDE 16000.       From South Africa.      On arrival, he bought the cokes, but asked the shop assistant to call Molly to the counter. He wanted to thank Molly for helping save his life. While we waited, Nigel turned to me and said something quite simple yet profound: He said he knew he was dead. He experienced a tremendous whooshing sound, followed by the most beautiful music he had ever heard in his life. Then he woke up in the hospital.  
   Second-hand NDE that happened as children in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).  What is remarkable about this narrative is the effect his friend's NDE had on him.   

    2561.        Clautreaux Possible NDE       1/9/2011.      Possible NDE 4954.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Simon.      Then the pains began to ease, the odors became perfumed, and the colors went progressively from brown to a clear blue and I was very happy to be going where I was going. Suddenly a shadow started walking on my right side. That lasted some time, and I was more and more happy, without pain anywhere. The shadow at my side spoke to me, asking, 'Are you sure you want to go on?' I went on a few paces, and then I turned around, without replying, and began to go back where I had come from.  
   Possible NDE from heart attack after nine days of coma.   

    2560.        Sally M Probable NDE       1/1/2011.      Probable NDE 4970.             I just rested; a peace I never felt before came over me. I saw a bright light through the water and didn't want to get up. It seemed like a long time. A voice said, 'You have to get up before another wave comes.' I got up and walked out without any wave hitting me. I made a decision to live and realized I was not finished here. It was an overcast day without sun.  
   Probable NDE due to drowning.   

    2559.        Ted M NDE       1/1/2011.      NDE 4969.             When I entered a side door, a stair case presented itself and I immediately ascended without thought. On the third step, I hesitated looking back down to see the multitude of souls mired in what seemed to be a river down below. I turned and resumed the ascent to the fifth step where I became centered within enlightenment, a singularity, my universe became clear, I could see beyond time and there before me passed my life, the lives of my parents, the lives of my grandparents, my accomplishments, failures, wants, needs and desires both past and future. It was a very beautiful and loving existence with all thought being as one. As I reviewed the past and future, it became clear that all was good, orderly and correctly defined, I was at peace within the cosmos.  
   NDE due to being shot in head with later cardiac arrest.   

    2558.        Louis S NDE       1/1/2011.      NDE 4968.             About this time, both of my deceased grandmothers appeared from nowhere. One stood there just looking at me and the other was telling me to go back, that I couldn't come in yet. I looked beyond her into the black darkness and felt the presence of my deceased grandfather, my deceased great-grandmother and uncles - family members I had never met. I felt them and saw their spirits gathering in one area. My grandmother was adamant that I didn't take another step. I wanted to continue and she saw this. At this time, she yelled out to me, 'STOP! Cameron (my daughter) is going to need you!' (I was divorced and my daughter lived with my ex at the time.)  
   NDE due to truck accident.   

    2557.        Lonny F NDE       1/1/2011.      NDE 4967.             When I asked if I was dead he said very simply 'Yes, you are.' We never opened our mouths to communicate; everything was by thought alone. So many words were exchanged so fast that it would be impossible for me to account for them all. He made me feel very safe and welcome. He comforted me and let me know that he was there to assist. He asked me if I wanted to still live, and very quickly, without even having to think, I said, 'Yes I do.' He smiled as if he had expected me to say that. I don't know why, but I felt as if we had always known each other, and that it was funny to him that he already knew my answer. I asked him if he could help me get back. I was made to know and understand that he couldn't interfere, but what he could do was to show me what I already knew. Just then, I was pulled away from that bright beach and pulled upward, or inward - I really don't know.  
   NDE at age 15 due to drowning as a result of large waves following an earthquake.  Remarkable knowledge gained during life review helped save his life.   

    2556.        Edna NDE       1/1/2011.      NDE 4965.       From the UK.      As I was floating through this tube, I could hear snippets of conversations from my past. On exiting the tube, I was surrounded by the most wonderful music - similar to pan-pipes. This music was everywhere and the feeling was so peaceful and pain-free. I asked, 'Where am I?' and was told 'The Halls of Music.' There seemed to be a lot of people, and they were all exuding so much love. I went outside to the most wonderful blue sky and green grass. There was a bridge. I asked to cross it, but I could not - there was some kind of invisible barrier. Someone I felt I knew appeared on the other side of the bridge, (I still do not know for certain who it was, but I think it was my grandfather) and he said, 'It is not time yet, you still have work to do.'  
   NDE due to complications of childbirth.   

    2555.        Jean K NDE       1/1/2011.      NDE 4964.             As I looked out at this most beautiful sight of stars, planets, and the great radiant and loving Light, I saw tiny trails of blue, pink and green lights traveling across the expanse of darkness toward the Great Light. I wondered what they were, and instantly I had the information that they were prayers from people seeking the Light. They were very beautiful, and once they reached the Light, they were absorbed into it. Then larger trails of white light traveled from the Great Light outward. I knew that these were answers to prayers. I just wanted to watch the traveling of the lights, be warmed by the Light and enjoy the beautiful view. The Light turned a magnificent blue and rolled toward me like an ocean wave. It was not really close to me, but nevertheless, I could see the image of Jesus within the blue wave. Love poured out upon me, like warm water. Jesus looked just like he did on the poster in my Sunday School class.  
   Exceptional NDE due to respiratory arrest from bronchitis.   

    2554.        Beth L FDE       1/1/2011.      FDE 4963.             We had those old metal ice cube trays that make the giant cubes with the sharp edges. I made a glass of ice water and somehow one of those giant cubes went straight into my throat and blocked me from breathing. As I was choking and panicking, my life seemed to pass before my eyes going backwards. It was me watching me, like in a movie and one 'still' from that movie still stands out in my head, just a picture of myself at a very young age.  
   Fear-death experience due to choking at age seventeen.   

    2553.        James W NDE       1/1/2011.      NDE 4962.             As I looked down at the house, a house where there was a very deep Christian influence, I first noticed a great many people surrounding it. These people, I did not recognize, although I could make out their faces. Beyond those I could see well, stretched a multitude of people into the horizon. That horizon joined the dimension of the one my companion and I were in. The earthly horizon joined the heavenly horizon. Those up close, I sensed were alive at the time, while those in the distance, I sensed as departed. The people up close were all praying for me. I believe they were kneeling. Their prayers appeared as smoke rising into the heavens. They were all facing towards me, more or less, all over the yard.  
   NDE due to clinical death while under general anesthesia.
