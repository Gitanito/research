She worked with Rhea White on testing children for ESP.   Contents   	Life and Career 	Parapsychology 	Selected Articles 	Literature 	Endnotes     Life and Career

Margaret L Anderson was born in Mt. Vernon, Illinois. After graduating from the University of Illinois in 1940 she became a teacher and high school principal. She joined the American Red Cross and served in France and Germany during World War II. She then returned to teaching, obtaining a PhD from the University of Pittsburgh.  Parapsychology

Anderson became interested in the possibility that ‘psi may play a direct role in the educational process as mediated by the teacher-pupil relationship’.1 To investigate this, she obtained a position at the Duke University Parapsychology Laboratory in 1954; there she &nbsp;worked with Rhea White in what became known as the ‘Anderson-White’ school experiments. The pair discovered that the extent of ESP displayed was affected by the positive or negative emotional relationship with the teacher administering the test.2 However, other researchers failed to confirm the effect.3

In 1961 Anderson was the joint-winner with RA McConnell of the prestigious McDougal award for their ESP research, which was published in the Journal of Psychology in the same year.4

Amderson was a member of Parapsychology Association, serving as its treasurer and as president in 1962.   Selected Articles
