  		              		Experience Description   

    On 12/04/2020, I underwent surgery to repair an injury to the tendons of my rotator cuff. The surgery lasted almost 3 ½ hours. In the middle of the procedure, I had to be sedated again because I was waking up.  
  
  During the post-surgery recovery phase, my wife, my mother, and my sister stayed in the room. During that time, I went somewhere else. I was with a person all in white, who’s face I couldn’t see. I was  led me by the hand to a large plantation. Many people were working in  a large vegetable garden. There was a large botanical garden on the other side of that. When I arrived at the vegetable garden, some people came over to speak with me. The first one I spoke with was my grandfather. Then, I spoke with  my father-in-law. My grandma spoke of events and things that had happened to me when I was a child. I saw my cousin, Luis, who had drowned. Then I spoke with Marcos from church, who had been buried to death when he was 7 years old. I spoke with my sister’s mother-in-law. I also spoke with a person I knew who had passed away last month. Then I met Eliane’s great-grandmother. They touched the surgery site and told me  that I would not feel any pain.

 Then, I  heard my mother and the nurse calling me but the person that was with me told me that I was not going back to my body yet.  
  
  Finally, everyone one the other side said goodbye to me one by one. At that point, I was sent to go open a door to leave this place. I opened the door and left.

   I was totally out and didn’t wake up until around 7:00 p.m. A little bit later, I started to remember what had happened during the time that I had been over there. I had been over there 1 hour and 20 minutes. My mother was very moved by what I told her.
