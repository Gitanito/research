            		Experience Description:   

I'm a registered nurse with asthma. I went to the emergency room the day after Christmas with an asthma attack. I was given numerous breathing treatments with no relief. My doctor arrived and told the staff to intubate me. As soon as they started to put the tube down my throat I heard one of them saying, 'She's coding'. All of a sudden, I was laying down in what felt like a hammock filled with cotton. I don't know how else to describe it. I felt like someone or something had their arms around me. It was the most comfortable, warm and loving feeling I have ever felt. Above me was the 'white light' it was bright like the sun, but it didn't hurt my eyes and it was warm. It was a peaceful, and I didn't hurt anymore. I wasn't afraid it was the safest I have ever felt in my life. They coded me for twelve minutes before they could get me back.
