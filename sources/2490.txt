a design to establish the important intt>rebces my author has drawa
from them. And a' to technical terms, in almost all caaea they are
so b:-ought in, that the reader wilt know their meaning u soon as be

As it ia belirved that I contaio a new 1y61em of notiou,-that
my inerits may not be wrongly apprPC:iated, it is my author's ur-

me through attentivl'ly, and in order, from beginning to end.-Ir
my e.leventh chapter be found rather tedious, it is necesury that it
be attentively read, to the right undl'r!ltandiug of what fullows.
That my author might " bt>gin at the beginning,', and tfaat he
might have 11 fit opportunity to adYance a few ideas for the consid-
eration of. those who love to think ; he has inserted my first c:hap·
ter : though he ~annot see as it bas any conoexion with my lead-

Excepting what i~ contained in three or four chapters, I contain

deavored to exhaust nnJ of the various subjects of which be hu

and vnprl!judiced public, by whose decision I must stand or fall;
for there is no such pubiir. in existence.
It is expi'Ctt'd the cri1ics wi!l fKII to nibbling my 1ojl parl1-of
which I possess a prt'tty good share-but my author will nP.v~r be

and if there be a Ma-

ltut that if such Maker wer~ minutely examined by man, man
would discover LlUf"h indications ofwi~dom and design. that it
would be more difficult for him to admit that such MakN was
not ca..teed or con!ltructed by a pre-exastaog Designer, than to
admit that the uoivel't'e was not cau!led or Cousuucted hy a

We know not how recently the word immaterial has been

CHAPTER liT.
On the Dnillerse, POfDer, Cause, Efftct, (-c.
By the word unillerat, we mean every thing that was 'crea·
ted by an Almighty Deaigner. , We do not consider space aa
a real eofity or agent ; we do not think it pro1•er to say that
apace waa created. With us, it ia unconceivable that an agent
should exist 111hich never commenced existence ; but with us,
it is equally inconceivable that space should not have existed
(if it be proper to speak of the existence ofthat which ill not a
'bein~,) from eternity. NeitlJerdo we consider the Designer of
the univer!e lb .. ?"..t nf the universe, but as something dis-
tinct from it: we say that the word univel'l!e ought to be used
to sigmfy every thing that was created, and we say, further·
more, every thing which was cre,a_t~d, .iJ rngtlq:.
Now when any body of matter acts. this body mlly be G~tll­
ed the agent ofsuch action ; and the action itself may be call·
ed an u:ent. Ifan ultim'ate atom of matter act, this atom is,
also, the agent of !lttch action, and the action as truly an event
as any other, although our senses may be too imperfect to
pereeive either the atom or the action; or, in other words, to
perceive either the atom (at rest) or the atom acting; for the
adioo ofao agent is nothing otber than, nothing distinct from,
the agent acting, any more than a property of a body is eorne·
thing distinct from the body.
~vent' do not occur promiscuously; but it is a universal
lac:t, or leu" ofnature, tbat auch event aa is aucceeded by a
\ Digitized by GoogIe
_
-.-,
e;ertBin other event at one time, is at all times sueceeded by
th~ same event, cinumstances bt>iug the same.
We must now ~how what we mean hy cirrumslallcts. The
word circmnsta11ces, it~ a convenient word which we often ul!e
to denote all those preccdiug events which we do not wish te
lie at the trouble of enumeratwg ;-we need not add, that we
.also use it to denote conditior.s. for this is impl1ed, sinct> .he
same cha:n o( antecedent eventtl gives r·isP to the same coudi-
tions. No body is e'er in a condition, except it he put in such
·condition; and this putting any thing in a condition is an
event ; therefore, .rthe circumstances he the same. if the pre-
ceding events be the snme. th>J present conditions will be the
same. Hence, to say the word circumstances means prece-
ding tvents, is as much as to say it means preceding evmts and
prnent conditions.
Now tht> universal fact, or law of nature, that like ante-·
ceclents-aTe itwariabi!J t~ul·c~- a., like cGHseqnents. under
the same circumstances, has given rise to the word!- Power,
Cause. and Effect. Men ha\·e found that a certain action,
or chnnge, of t~_h.od) ~-\. i!l immediattl!J. and under the t~ame
circum,.tances, iniJariuL/y succet>dPd by a certain action of !he
. body B. but that an action of X. although X be brought in
contact with 8, is uot followed by such change or action of
B. Such experien('e has giveu ri~e to the sentiments, (a••d to
the language to expre11to them,) that the action of A is the
cause of the action of B : that the action of B ia the tffect of
eurh cause ; and Ihat Apo!lses!les a something (a power] wleich
enables it to product (both bad terms) a change or action of
B. and which X does not possess.
Ofcause and tffrct we shall treat more fully presently. Aa
to the word pow~r. there can be no harm iu U!'ing it as above,
if it be rightly undenatood. if it gi,·e rise to uo fal~e notions.
By lbe power of A, to produce a change of B, nothiui more
Digitized by GoogIe
~·
eugbt to be meant than the simple fact, that under eertain cir-
cum"tllnces, a certain change ofA is immediately nud inT>aria-
bly !'ucceeded by a certain change of B. Ifa man &uppose
that the power of any body be something distinct from, and
somt:thing more than such body, then is he deceived by lan•
&uage~ &Dd led to believe iu the e:listent::e of a nOQ-eDfity.
&'}iower ofa body, instead of being distinct from, or more
&ban such body, is a part of tiuch body, in the samf' sense thai
a p-ropeny ofa certain kind ol matter is a part ofsuch matter.
Take away, or destroy any property, or power, of any body,
and it is no longer the same body, logically speaking. In-
deed, if there be any difference between a power and a prop·
erty of a body, it must be a very nice and not essential one.
We must make it oul'!clves, by saying that a body possesses
a ~llwer, when we find that it produces certain changes in oth-
,..
tr bodies ; and that a body possesses a property, wben we find
that it ilot only prod.ueeo ch~n~~!l in other bodies, but suffers
ehangel! from the action ofother bodies.
But if there he no more real distinction between a power
and a property, than this, some may wonder why we sf10uld
eay, as above, that, by the power of the body A to produce a
change in the body B, nothing more eught to be meant than
that, under certain circum!tances, a certain change or action
of A is immediately and int1ariably succeeded by a certain
ehange of B. But this wonder will cease when we consider
closely the only reason we have, in any case, for saying a bo-
iy pos11esses a property. It will be found that the only rea-
toni~, because the borly may produce a chauge in some <lther
body, or auifer a change in itself from the action of some oth-
er body.
Some will see, at once, that this as!'ertion is true ; othera
1Jill wonder at it, and ask what change in any other body, a
fiece of &old, laid away in a box, produces, that leads us te
I,
say it is extended, yellow, am! heavy. But it must 1>e remem-
bered, that gold would be to mankind nothing at all, 1fuo p1ece
of gold ever -acted upon any of the selhiCS of any rr.ar. ; andt
certainly, in su<.b case, no man would have any reason to say
that gold isextended.ydlow,and heavy. And as to the par-
ticular piece of gold laid away in a box:, he that knows noth•
ing about this piece of gold, cannot say that this piece of gold
is extended, &c. But some one has seen and felt this piece
of gold,-then this piece of gold produced some change in tbat
which sees and feels ; and on thia account, whoever saw and
felt the gold, has reas<in to say it is extended, yellow, &c.
We do not say but that trees, stones, &c. would have had
the same properties that they now have, if no sentient bemg
had P.Ver e:s:i~ted ; hut the only reason we have for saying
that bodies possess properties, is, because they produce or
suffer changes.
Perhaps one thing that serves to make Alany think there is
more difference between a power and a property than what
there really is, is this; we give properties p11rticular name$,
but we do not powers. We say of a muscle, it has the pow.
er of contracting, and we l!ay it has the property ofcontract-
ing: this property we give the nan.e of contrac.tility, and
1peak of the property of contractility ; but the power ofcon·
~ractility is an expression not in usc.
From what has been said, it appears that in metaphysical
disquisition~, we m4ght very well dispense with the word pow-
•r ; for we cannot give it any more meaning than we give the
word property ; and the reasons we have for s:tying a body
po~see~ea a power, are no more than the reasons we have for
saying it possesse!l a property.
A power is neither an agent por an action, an agent at rest,
nor an agent acting ; but mert:lv to cxpres~o the simple f.1ct,
that, under certain circumstances, a certain chan~e of A is im· ·
Digitized by GoogIe
me3\ately and invariably succeeded by a certain ehange o{
B ; io less words than these, we use the word power, and say
that A has the power of producing a change in B. But it
would be as philosophically correct to say A hali the property
ofproducing a change in B.
It may he asked why a certain c.hange of A is immediately
and invariably succeeded by a certain change of B, under
certain cin:um~tances ? To this question, the only and the
sufficient answer that can be given, is, such is the fact; or
such is the law of nature ; or suc.h is the. will of the Great
.Architect. The two fir~t answers differ only in sound, and
the la!!t i11 like either of them, untees it be supposed that the
Great Architect wills (and of course thinks of) the change of
B to follow immediatPiy after the cha·nge of A, or di.d will
these particular changes to qccur in this very order, at some
forme.- Qeriod.
Jt must be remembered, that in those cases in which it is
!mown and admitted that two events occur i&. immediate con·
nection, none but boys will attempt to explain why the 8ubse-
queot event follows the antecedeut. To explain the connec-
tion between any two events, is nothing more nor less than to
point out intervemng events, and the order in which they oc-
cur; but in case ouc event immediately follow another, there
are no intervening events to be pointed out, ofcourse, no e1·
planation to be given.
To illustrate what we have here said, suppose a man strikes
a ball, and the ball moves; now ifit be asked why his striking
the ball is followed by a motion of the ball, no explanation
can ,.,e given, and no answer can be given, except that such is
the faet, or law of nature. But ifthP. ball move on and knock
down a pin, and it be asked why his strtking the ball is follow·
ed by tbe fall of the pin, the answer, the t"Xplanation is, be..
cause.the IJaU moved on aud hit the pin. Here you see there
24
is an intervening event (the motion ofthe ball) to be pointed
out, and of co.Jrse some explanation to be given.
But in some instances in which one event succeeds anoth-
er, it is not easy to determine whether they occur in i.mme-
diate connection or not ; hence a man may sometimes at-
tempt to. explain the connectiou between two event~ when
there is no explanation to be given ; a man too who would
not think ofattempting to show why one event follows anoth-
er, kno:oing that they occur in immediate succession. We
believe. however, it more frequently happens that men think
that they have arrived at ultimate facts or law's of nature,
when a further analysis might be made, if they only knew all
that is to be known.
When a mao has discovered to a certainty what events in-
tervene between two obvious and well known events, and in
what order these intervening events occur, be may state what
he has discovered ; and au~ etaltment is an explanation of
the connection hetween the two obvious events : it is telling
mhy the fil'llt obvious event is followed by the second, in one
eense of the word why. It is also telling what he kno'llu, and
is mere history. Whereas, when a mao does not ~tbsolutt·ly
know what events interveae between two obvious events, but
knows of facts which render it probable that certain eveuta
do intervene ; he may state what he supposes these events
are, and the order in which he supposes they occur ; and this
statement is an esplaoatioo of the connection between the
two events; but it is hypothetical, or indeed an hypothesis,-
an hypothesis t-upported by facts. But if a man wuppo~c the
f:Xistence efevent11, or agent&, when there are no facta but what
may be as well explained without supposing such events to oc-
cur, or such agents to exist, as with,-why, his.suppposition
is a groundless hypothe~is, or more properly, a whim.

ing. were we to say a phenorrlt'non .,. ~•:y knou:n occurr('nce
or event. Using tht> word in this ser1t~e, we should loll} that,
to ellplain a pheuomenon, is to point out the ageflt which acts,
tht• action ofwhrch coustitutes the phenomenon, and to point
out those events which invariably precede it, or are es~e111 ial
to its occurrence.-A fet'Jing rs a phenomenon or event which
we know take11 place; it is an action ofthat which l't-els; and
to ex,,lain this phenomenon. is to show what (eels. whe-
ther the nervous system or some agent distinct from it, and
to tahow what gives r•~e to-what events must precedt: this-
feeling. All explamttioo~s o( thf' phenomenon of fc•eling mnst
be hypothetical, for the actron (the agent acting] which con·
1titutes a feeling, is not an ~bJect of11ent>e; we <:annot took
into the animal system and ue it feelit~g, as we can look into
eome ttieces of mtchamcal machmery and ~ee the partllmov•
ing, and the order-m wnlch \\•c~c .,.. ,.\,.. acl o\\e upon another
or one after the other. HowevE>r, the supposition that the
nervous system feels, rntay be so well supporred-by facls, that
thO!Ic who know ·these facts, can no more doubt, a11 we think,
that this supposition is correct. than the astronomer can doubt
the ~uppo11ition that the earth turns oo it11 own axis.
To nP!ain phenomena, then, is to show what agents act,
aod tl.e order io which they act. This is all. When it is
lmoUJn that one event immt:diately succeeds another. it would
be even more absurd to ask wby ? than to ask what h,Ydrogen
is composed of.
Now tt is evident, that to show correctly tbe order in which
the events of any chain or 11equence occur, we must point
out all the events of sucb chain ; for if we do not point out
o/1 the link11 of this .chain, we leave out some one or more

nmlter tht~reof not prevJOU!'ly uisting. In either case, w•
bt>licve the Grt•at Architect so organized the universe, tbat it
c:ontmues in harmonious opcrat\on without any further exer-
tiouP on hts pnrt,-without h•s imrne~hate agency. llt:nce,
allhough the Supn·me ia tlw first cause ofall that we behold,.
l1e is not, us we mamtain, the immtdmte cautte of any natural
event. But ifhuman eye ever witnesse~ an unnatural evt:ut,
su•·h C\ent was a miracle, and was immediatei!Jpreceded or
cau~ed hy an act of the Deity.
We do not believe the Deity E'Ver intended, or thought or
en•ry particular cv('nt which has and will take place ; for
th1s would he to helit·vc that he intended or thought of every
motion of t'Vf'ry grain of ~a,,d, of ev«.>ry motion ofe,·ery leu(.
ofeverv thought of evt•ry brain. oL"v~ry ~•ion of every in.-
Bf'ct ; in 10hort, of t·\·ery action of every agent which e\'er ex-
bled, or ncr will exist.
But we do bdicve that, .at the time he organized the uni•
ypr,;e, he d1d intend, aud uf cuur~e think of, some of the more
im: o'rtant events which ha,·e and wdl ot:cur. He inteuded
that the ht>avPnly bodies ~hould revoiYe as they do. aud con-
1«-quently that thPre l!lhould he cold seasons and warm-seed
time and har,·est ; that animals ~hould propa;!Bie their spe•

kiud ;-that all mt>n shnuld die ;-that the nervou!! system
should ft•el and think. &c. &c. Ncvertheles!l, we do not be-
)it·ve lhat :my event. important or tt·itlmg, ever d1d occur
whirh the Dt•ity intencluJ should not occur.

it as to fulfil thet~e objects or designs. And although mAh)l
trifling events o cur, by virtue of this organization, which
were not th011ght uf at the time, still we do a•ot believe that
they oteur ctJnlrary to •he good pleasure of the Almrghty:
certain!, not contrary to his permrssion; and we a>hould thwk
that an Almighty Being would not permit events to occur
whidt diepltase [make unhappy] him. At any rate, if, in this
stupendous ma<.hine,-the universe,-any events occur which
disp\ease the Cr·eator, it would be bla~phemy for man to talk
of blamt> and culpability ; for certainly the fault, if there be
one, is 110t in the pot hut the potter. ·
I know thai mankind have ever· been a proud race of ani•
mats; and although they daily llee other classes of animala
suffering pain, sickneu and dt•sth. men got it into thrir heads,
thousands ofyears ago, that the Deity never intended, and
is d\'l'o\)\eased at, whatever gi,·ell rise to human mi~ery ; or in

and then made another part, t~ compfete the system,-thia
nothing or chance (I care not which you call it,) must have
been a very strange nothing; for to "find out" supposes
thought-a thought implies the existence of something which

Dot ? If a man and a woman ever came into existence without

and assert, that some time or other a man decreed that ·no
men or women commence existence without cause, and that
this is the reason wb~ men and women do not thua commeur.e

piJrl of/aim ut.'Dtt'!J where pre,ent, Jwill now proceed to main·
tain this last; that is, to maintain that the Deity i!l not ofsuch
nst dimensions, that, go where you will, some part of him
•ill always be there.
ThE' doctrine that the Deity exists every where, not only
Virtually but substantially, is of modern origin. 'fhere are
hundred!! of pas11age~ in scripture wh1ch speak of the De1ty
as· a Being o( determinate dimensions, to one which speaks
ofh•m as a Being who fills immensity or all space. Aud ifin
a few instances the scriptures speak ofthe Ueity as though he
'Wf!re of unlimited dimensions, (it is impossible to conceive ·
any limits to space,) we have no reason to regard these few
pa!lt~ages as any other than figurative expressions : we have
Do reason to suppo11e the writers of them would be under;;tood
to suppoBP. that the Dt!ity ia so large that if there were .less
space than there is, there would not be room for the Deity to
es:tst as he now is. No-they would only be undergtood to
mean that the Deity can behold all his creation ; ·that, though
seated on his throne in heaven, he kriows full well what is go•
ing on in everv part ofhit~ !llupendous machine, the universe.
I know that philosophers of old have held that "the uni-
Yerse is an emanation or extension ofthe essence of the Crea-
tor." But what is this " essence of the Creator ?" and
wherein does an emanation of a material world from the es-
senc.e of the Creator, differ from an absolute creation by the
CrE>ator? Did this essence contam all the matter that ncnr
exists ? Ifit did. it was a very gross essence ; if it did not,
• •
there must have been an absolute creation. But waving the
further consideration of this matter, I proceed to state,-the
created uniVf'rse is t~ometbiog distinct from the Creator, or it
is not. Ifit be, let its dimensions ~ what they may, it doel
not follow that its cre11tor mul't be of equal dimensions : but
if the univene be n~tbiog cbstinct from its Creator, then the

Creator and the thing creatP.d, are but one thing ; or rather,
there is no Creator.-Poets have sung :
"Jupiter is the air;
Jupiter is the earth ;
Jupiter is the heaven:
All is Jupiter."
But what is this bu\ a freak of a poet's brain, or 4ownrigbt
atheism? ".4.11 is Jupiter!" The heavens, the earth, the sun,
moon and stan, and all that in them or about them is, are Ju-
'
pitcr. 1 am a part ofJupiter, and you are another pal't.-
Let us not be deceived by empty talk ;-when one thing is
called by several names, let us not so err as to suppose that
each name bas a peculiar thing o( its own : Jup1ter is some·
thing distinct from the univel"'!e, (as I have defined it,) or else
Jupiter is a name without a tbing. God, the Creator, is 6ome•
th\n~ distinct from the universe created, or there is no Crea·
tor nor world.crea\ed ; but a WGrld by chance. ,
It appears, then, that all true atJd real Deists of ancient
times, did not bold that the Deity exists every where, substan-
tially as well as virtually ; and this doctrine, as I have said,
is ofmodem origin.
But the authf?rity ofthe bible, and the opinions ofancient
Deists, are not all I have to offer against tbe absolute omoi·
presence ofGod.
The notion is unfounded, ridiculous and de~rading. It
arose from faithlessness in God's omnipotence. Thinking it
impossible for God to sit on his throne in heaven, and know
what is going on in every paft of his machine ; thinking, al·
so, that God is too powerless an architect to organize the uni-
vene in such a manner that all things may go on in it as bar- .
moniously as they do without his looking to it-,without his
immediate agency,--somebody, I do not know who, advanced
the notion that God is every where present, upboldmg and

But only think what an irreverent notion this ia. ",God is
every where present;" that is, God 's not only where space
otherwise would be, but God is in every mess of matter. The
atmosphere is one mess or body of matter; God is in this.
Each individual stone is anotber body of maHer ; God is ill
every on~ of theac :--1 say God. This is impossible, unless
there be millions and millions _of Gods : I can only mean a
part ofGod. And ifthc:re be such a devil as is talked of,-
, - - - LE't us examine the full extent and bearing of eve·
ry doctrine, entirely unsupportt:d by facts, before we give it
•rcdem·e.
· As to the dimensions of that Being who " created mao af-
ter his own image," I cannot say; but the. God of the Old
Teatameut is represented to be very much Gf the size and
&hape of a man ; and the same we find to be the case w1th
his Son, so frequently mentioned in the New. "Judgi~og frorn
these data, Ihe Author of Mture very mu~h re~embles the hu-
man Fpccies in shape al'd site !
My fifth notion is, that God has Sll organizP.d the uoiver~e,
that all parts of it-all agents, go on acting in the same har·
mooious order in whit.h they do, without any lurtherexl'.rtions
on his part ; or if you do not like the word exerliom, without
any further concern or willing; and, of course, that he is not
the immediate cause of any natural evcut though he is the
jint cam•e of all,-if it be proper to call that a cause whida ia
not immediate/9 followed by whfat we call the etfcr:t.
This notion appears to me much more rational and di~n!f!J·
eng, if I may so say, than the notion that the Deity is the im·
mediate cause of ,;aluraI events. Were we to adopt this last
notion, several strange and irreverent conclusions must neces·

ently of himself, which would be much the mo~;t simple and
direct way of bringing about e~·ents ; or :we must conclude;
contrary to aU our notions of nature's simplicity, that be did
not choose to; but rather chose to be continually in exercise
to make water.run down hiU, to make it thunder, to make
the fire snap, to make. the brain think, to make the earth re-
"rolve, to make one man kiU another, &c. &c.
1 have here mentioned events, some of wbich mtn would
call important; some, they would call trifling, and one, they
would call evil. But I should hope that in these enlightened
days, no man can be found who \viii he so irrational as to as-
scribe natural events to more than one ~ource ;-no man who
will ascribe some to the law~ of nature-some to tbe imme-
diate agency of the Deity, and some to the devil. Bull trust
that every well informed man who questions, what ia the
truth ? aud not, wlwtwill it be to my interest tu nwintain? will
either say there is no main-spring-no motive principle in na•
ture--cvery thing bt·ing a dead mstrument, which ne\·er
moves except the Deity lay Jlis hands upon it; or else say
that all created things were so mad~. at first, as to act as they
.Jo, independent of the Creator. If he say the IaUer, he will
meet \\'ith no difficulties but what proud man has created.-
But if he say that God wilIs ever particular event at the tin;e
it occurs, he will meet with iusupcr.tble difficulties. Not to
say a word about repre~cnting the Deity as a poor Architect,
and a @lave to his own creation. he will be forced to admit,
(what he cannot believe,) that tlwre are millions and millions
of Divine wil111, or else that one Divine will, maJ will millions
and millions of billions of frtllions of particular and distant .
events, at the same identical instant.
If God were the immediate producer of event~. why all thi1
nice organization in mall and olhcr animals.? could he uot3
.,
4i
were He to attend to itl make an inorg'lni~ statue of clay
think, move, and propagate its species ? Do you tell me it
•wall God's good plea11ure to bring about his ends by certain
means? This isjust what I say. That men might be contin·
ually coming info existence without His being continually en·
gaged in making them, He organized a man and a .woman in
such a manner that they could propagate their species. That
men might think without His continual exertions, He made
the first man with a nervous system; and now, d'ye see, as
soon as this nervous system becomes, by any means, impair-
ed, thinking ceases, or goes on irregularly. But I suppose
that by an immediate and direct effort of the Deity, thinki,!ll
mightgo on iu a man, ifbe bad a poor nervous system, oreven
none at all.
Need I use any more words to convince every rational and
dissnltrested man, that God takes no part whatever au the pro-
duction of natural events ?
But it may be asked, if supernatural events or miracles
have not, and do still occur, on or about this little globe of
ours? We ret'ly, that it is far Jrom us to deny the powcr.of
the Deity to interrupt the ordinary course of nature, and of
being himself· the immediate antecedent or cause of events
that would not follow natural antecedents ; neither would we
deny that men have existed who, being ignorant of the lawa
and properties of matter, witnessed phenomena which they
eOuld not e:splain, and which they ascribed to the immediate
agency of the Deity, the devil, or ofwitches. But I think it
an important question that must interel!t every man, and ought
. not to be settled without the most impartial examination ofall
that cao be said on both sides of it :-Which is the most ra•

CHAPTER V.
On Action or Chauge.
Jt win be admitted on aiJ.handF, that no event or change, of
any kind whatever, can take place without action :-not a
sens:ttion or a thought can occur W1thout an achon ofthat
wh1ch sensei' and thinks. True, it is difficult for us to con-
ceive how a few rays of light falling upon the retin~e of one'a
eyes, can excite a change in h1s optic nerves and brain, and,
:u 110me would add, io his 11oul or -mind; but we do know, if
we kn~w any thing, that we see objects, when we are in such
relat1ons with them tbat they may rdlect light upon our eyes,
and we cannot othenviie than believe that this seeing is an
action of that whi<:h sees.
If, theu, no change can take place without action, nor any
action without change, we may cou,oidcr chnnge and action aa
convertible terms. ror sound's sake, we may sometimes use
the one and sometime& the other.
Now au action is nothing other than an agent actin~, and
as there are wide differences between agents, a." it re&Jpects
size, properties and relations with each other ; and morNwer,
as we believe there are two dasses ofactions e11entially di(-
(ereut from each other.• we shall attempt to give a class•tica•
tion ofa:tions or changes.

W.ere we to elan actions according to their e,temial difTc,.
eoces, we should have two ~ivisions only. · One-divisioo
would comprehend all those actions which constitute sensing
and thinkmg, or if you please, sensations and thoughts ; and
1Ve should call thern sentient or contcient actions. This kind
ofaction11 is invariably confined to the nervous system.
The other division would comprehend all other ac1if)na io
the universe ; and we should call them insentient or incon•
scient actions, in contradistinction to <.onscient actions.
But we proceed to make an arra.ngement ofactions accord·
ing to the agents which act. He.nte our first division as into
jnsi~t on it, that an action of any agf'nt whatevrr, can ~nothing
otht!r than a chan,e of plac.., or. "hat is the sante thmg, ehaug.. of .
relation· with somE' other aeeot or btoing ; and that whl'n we say
ou.. action is P!llt'ntiatly dilft•rt>nt from another, we can m~on noth•
ine more than that thf' ·~""' which aet are essPntially di&Pr..nt
frum e~~c'h other. Wf'll, suppn1lng we grant this; then tht' ques.
tion is : Wa11 it thf' dt'tPrmination ol the GrP.at Architf'tt that ac•
tions of a matf'rial Ol"lfllD ...hould coostitutP what we call thinking,
or th11t acti1•ns of ~~n1Pt' immatt>rial thing should con11titut~ thinking !
If we admit th.. Pliltt'nce of this immatf'rial thing, we can no
more cnncf'ive that an action of it is any thing otbt'r t110n a c:han&e
of place or flf ff'hltion with something eta.. than we c:an cnncelye
that an action 11f 10111e pan of tht> bntio is any thing othPr than a
ch:mp of rt>lation with some othN' pan -(We are here speakiul
of vPry minute " pans ofthfo brain.")-Should it be said that this
immatPrial thmg diM'S uot ehan~ its place, or itt relation with any
P'•rt of thP brain.wlwn it thinkl ; but that its parts ehan11e thfir re-
lations with Hrh oth..r; I should reply,. that immatt'rialists hold
that this immaterial thing (tniud or .Oul) has no pdrta; and latbnuld
say, runherm11r?, that admiUiog it to have parts. Wf' can no more
eoncPiVf' h~>w a rhanJ!e of relation amnng th~se p11rts should cen~<ti·

thing itself, and aome para. of the brain, shout.! c:onstitutf' think "I! ;
or than Wf' ~an. how an action of a materiltl org11o, the brain, abould

which compose liquid bodit>tz, and the actiC)os of those which
constitute sohd bodies. If we must distinguish the~e three
divisions of actions by particular appellation!', we can think
of none but the following bungling ones, viz. Gaseous Atom·
ic Adions. Liquid· Atomic Actions, and Textural Actions.
The order of textural acuow1 we will divide into three ge-
nera. The first genus comp1ehending the atomic actions of
elastic bodies ; the second, the atomic actions of contractile
bodies, and the third, the atomic actions of .sen!lible bodies,
(the nervous organs.] Let us say a few words in this piKe
about these different bodiea or textures.
... __
The elastic texture is to be found in the kingdom of inor-
ganic matter!...and in the kingdom of orga'lized beings. The
mainspring of a watch is elastic ; every bough in the woods
is eht!tic; a piece of cartilage is elastic. But what is elasti-
city, or, in other words, when and why do we say a body is.
ela~tic ? Answer : When the particles or atoms of matter
wh1ch compose any hody-art! forced 'from their relations with
each other, by mefhanicalforce, and still retain a tendency-
a mauife,..t tenderky to return to their former relations, the
body whi,:h they compose is said to be elastic, or (lor sound's
sake,) to possess elastrcity.
As to the contracile texture, it is to be found only in or-
ganized bodies, both vegetable and animal. It ill not very
manifest io 1
be vegetahle kintcdom. Wt find it· m the sensi·
tive plant, and have good reuou to suppo~e that it exist!o in
the circulating vessels of all plants. It is very manife10t in
animals, .and constitutes the principal part of those organa
called muscles.-But what is contractility, or in other words, .
when and why do we say a body is contractile?
Answer: When the atoms which compo!le auy body ap·
proaC"h each othf'r more clo~ely in any ont> directron, on the
application ofa 1&imulw, we aayauch body is contractile, or
Digitized by GoogIe
ponesses eontradility ; and th•• approaching of atoms-this
aborten111g of the body-is called contraction. But what t1
a stimulus?
When any agent f':tcites (when the application of any age(lt
iJfoll~d by] a contraclion ofa muscle-not b.) mechautral
k»r'Ce, but by virtue of the organization of the muscle-such
agent is called a stimulus.
Some men call those agents which c·xcite consciP.Dt actiona
of the nervoua &.)stem, stimuli; thus they speak of the stimu-
lus or light, the stimulus ofS<IUnd, &c. But there is no neces-
sity for, but some impropriety in, using the word in lhts double
sense. Those agents which·excite consci-=nt actions may be
called excitants.
As to the sensible texture, it is to be fo11nd only in the Rer-
Yous system; but we would not be underetood to UJ that
ewry part ofthe nervous system is seu,;ible, uor would we
say that on\y con11cient action11 occur in the llt.rvous system.
Ou the contrary, we bdieve that two otblf kinds of artton8
take place io that '!JSiem oforgan~ which is called by the com·
prehensive term, nervou:J ")Stem. One of these kind of ac-
tion!' we call the lltCrtto'!l actions, and the other, the motive ac·
linn11; but as it is probable that the secretory action is an ac·
tion of the contractile texture, and as we cannot speak of the
motillt 11dions of the brain to advantage in this part of the
work, we did not thiuk it exl'edient to mentitJn but three geue·
ra of textur-dl actions.
But what ia sensibility, or in other words, why do we say
the nc"oas system is sensible ? Answer: Because. sentient
actions may be cxcittld in it, by impre:ISiono upon the senses.
Further than this we say not, in this place, as scnsibiltty,
and sentient or consctent actions, will be fully treated of ila
other parts ofthis work.
W• . have now akctcbcd a claasitication of cba.nfes or ac-
Digitized by GoogIe
I
tiont, which we lrnew i11 not perfect ; but eufficiently so, to
answer our present designs.
The question now occurs,-What is tbf! principle but for ,
wl1ich c..reated agtmts would not act 1 Does·the Deity contin- !
uall} move one great wheel in the univene, which wbeel
moves a ~econd, and this a third, and ao on, giving riee to ev•
ery action ofevery agent which acts at all 1 Or did the Dei•
ty, when be created grosser matter, add thereunto a main·
apring. whil'h is the moving principle of nature 1 We believe .
in the main11pring,-and query : What is it? and did any
m11n ever see or feel it!
Many a m:~n has both ~een and felt it, and called it electri·
eity. But for electricity, we believe that other forms of mat-
ter would never move, being otherwise constituted as they
how Pre.
We ~hall not attempt to point out the connection betweeat
electricity and all the various kinds of actions which are
known to occur. Nor shall we ask 7»h!J electricity cau•ea
one body .to attract another ; for this, we believe, would be
to ·question about an ultimate (act, of which, as of all o&her
uh•mate facts, there is no explanation to be given.
We m~ty brie8y state, however, that were it not for tbe
principle· of attraction, matter would not unite with matter.
Animals, ofcourse, would not exist, ei:cept they were every
one organized by the immediate 6at of the Deity ; and then,
the phy!liologist bas good reason to suppnse that they could
not mo,·e witbout the continual enrcise of divine intluence
towards tht>m. And if it can be shown that the actions ofan-
imalt are dependent on this active prir1ciple, there will be no
1reat difficulty in tracing all changes t~ the same 11ouree.
But I have a conjecture relative tn efectricity which ' will
'Yenture to throw out. It is well knnwn that caloric, or the
matter of heat, uilta iu two very diifc:reut ata~es,-in tbatef

f~l satior, of heat and ofexpanding almod.all bodies ; and that of
i,combination, in-which it cea8P.S to he cognizable by our sen-
~ sea Ol'·by the tbennometer. In the former «'ase, it is c&lled
r· free or un~o,nbimd ~alom ; in the latter, latent, or combined
+caloric.
n· This free caloric has a tendency to an equi1ibrium. so that.
:c, hot aad.,fold bodies placed dear to each other, eveo in a vacu•
·! om,. sOon become of the ••me temperature, as may be prov-
ed by applyinc the .bulb of the thennometer to each. They
i·l will: each expand, and of coune raise. the mercury to the .
t·. .ame decree. It is known too, that all bodies do not conduct
Y~ caloric with the same facility. Another fact it, that bodies
DUIJ part with theirfrte caloric without auft"ering a.•yaltera•
; tion m thetr properties. temperature f'XCepted; but not so .
with respect to that caloric •hich is intimately combined with

Elt>cfricity existia•g in thi11etate, niay be called latent orfixed.
Now as latent calorie may be set free, so may electricity
be set free, and it is set free by the galvanic balfery ;-the
plates and liquids, or moist su~tance1.1, which compose the
battery, suffering some change in their physical or chemical
properrie1 at the time. I shall maintain also, that it is set
free by the nf'I'\'OU!i ~<ystem, and constitutes the nervous fluid ;
the blood at the same time linffering some change in its phy·
aical or cht>mical propt:rties by circulating through the ner-
vous sy~~tem. But a11 it is accumulated and conductt'd by or·
ganized bodie11. it is not to he w~ndered at, if it do not appear
to be in all respects the same kand of fluid that is accumulated
by the plvanic battt>ry.-We do not believe there are any
elementar.) substances in man or any other animal whkh do
not exist in the world aro•Jnd them.
J "'ill here remark, that I am far from being convinced that
the weight of bodies of all kind~. is the 11ame in proportion to
the quantity uf gross matter which they contain, or in other
words, in proportion to their density.
Matter attracts matter,-the eartla attra('t8 all bodies to-
wards it, in a line passing 1ts centre : thererefore we say that
bodies on or near the surface of the earth, arP. heavy. But I
bt-lieve that ~orne kinds of mattt>r are more forc.ibly atlratted
by the earth than othl·rs. and hence that the dift'eren('e in
weight betwt>en a rubic iawh oi gold and a cubic inch ofsteel
does oot depend altogether on the didereuce betweeu tho

'loantities of m:.tter which they contain. I he1ine so, 6r&t,
bu·:utsf> a c•thic iuch of steel appears to contain more than
about one thtrd as much matter as r. cubic mch ofgold-and
a cubic inch ofi«;e, or of hard, sohd wood, appeal'll to contain
more than one twentieth 8!1 much matter as a cubic inc'h of
gold ;-a cubic inch ofcork appears to contain more than one
eightieth ~~ much matter as a cubic inch ofgold. Second:
We know that the chemical attraction ofall kinds of mattf>r is
not the same; and we 11uppose that chemical pttraction and
the attraction·or gravitation, both depend upon one principle.
'fhird : I know of no fact that prove~ that an ultimate atom
ofgold, or we'll say of platinum, (as a body of this is of great-
er specific gravity than any other bod)·,) is not heavier than
an ultimate atom .ofsilver, or of any other kind of matter. I
know of ll fact which has been thought to prove that the ulti-
mate atoms of a\\ kinds of matter are of the same weight. ad·
mitting them to be of the same size. The fact is this-" Gold
may, by being dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid, and having
its solution transferred to ether, be made to remain eqwllly
susp~nded in every part of this ether, which is the lightest of
all visible fluids."
But we know that in a minute particle of matter, there ia
infinitely more surface in proportion to the quantit1 ofmatter
which the particle contains, than in a larger body : we know
too, that liquids possess somP. dP.gree of adheeive attraction.
Some portion ofwater (and undoubtedly ofether, until1t evap-
orates,) wil1 adhere to the sides ofa glass or gold vessel which
stands uptight. Now 'we believe that by virtue of this adhe•
sivencss, ether may buoy up minute particles of gold which
present a very large surface to be acted UP,on, in proportion
to the quantity of matter which the particles contain; and
thus we accouot for this fact, which frees us from tbe necesai·

ty of admitting that a piece uf gold contains nearly three
time8 as murh matter as an equally large piece of the finest

CHAPTER VI.
On Union-Mechanical, Chemical, and Organi.
Matter unites with matter in threP. different ways-mechan
ically, chemicaily, and organically. These three kinds or
modes of union are '-Sstnliflll!f different from each other. This
we infer from the fact, that chemical union gives rise to pro-
perties which mechanical union does not, and organic u~ion
gives rise to properties which never arise from mechanical or
chemical uuion. But in every case, certain things are neces-
sary, in order that matter may unite with matter. That mat·
ter may u11ite mechanically, the several quantities must be
brought in contart ; that chemical union may take place, the
several ingredien:s must not Olil)' be brought tpgE'ther, but
they must be in dissimilar el(•ctric ~tales, and ont: or more of
them mul't, in almost all cases, be E'ilher in a gaseous or fluid
state ;-that matter ma)' unite organically. organized bodies
must previously exist.- We say, that a! fire gives rise to fire,
where fuel is pl'e~ent, 80 does organization gi\·e rise to organ·
ization, where fnod and other netesl<arics are not wantiug.
If I he a~ked l:ow the first 01gauized beings of each distinct
species came into existence, I aus\\'er,-God made them.
To instance a case in which mechanical union gives rise to
wh.tt we call a med1an•cal prop~rty :-lake water and gum
arabtc, put them together, and vtsc1dity will anse, which is a
mechauical prol'crty that d1d uol before exist, e1ther in the
water or lhe Jriao!e .ub:,tauce, gum aiabtc.-.By the chemical
Digitized by GoogIe
r• . . ,...---....;a=:
51
union ofsulphur and the elements of water, we have acidity
and 3everal other chemical properties which did not before
es:ist, either in the sulphur, the oxygen, or the hydrogen.-
The compound arising from this union is considered more
importaut than the one arising frorn the mechanical union of
water and gum arabic ; hence a particular name is assigned to
it. It is called sulphuric acid, or oil of vitriol.
By the organic union of phosphorus, sulphur, lime, soda,
chlorine,oxygen, carbon, hydrogen,azote, electricity, and sev-
eral other elements, we have physiological or vital properties
which did not before exist in either of the separate elements.
We wish it to be remembered, that we do not t~tlppo~e that
by union something MORE P.xists, but 11omething utFFto:tt~>.NT1
and hence somet!Jiug uew.
The most important, or at least the bei't known, physiolog-
ica\ properties that result from organic union, are sensibility
and contractility : the first a property of the nervous system ;
the last, a property of the muscular system.
Now the only reason we have in any case for ~aying a body
posse&ses a propet·ty, is because it may produce a change in
some other body, or suffer a chan~e in itself from the action
of some other body. We ,do not suppose that sensibility is
any thing distinct from the nervous system, or any thing t;U·
pcradded to it, any more than we !\uppose that acidity is
something distinct from vinegar or the oil o~ VItriol ; but we
sav the nervous !ystem is sensible or (meaning nothing more).
po5seso;es sensibility, becauseconscienl* actions may be excited
in it by impressions upon the senses.
• One I'Pason, among others, for ·preferrin~t the wurd conscient to
the word sentient, is because the word $t'lltient has bt'f'O RfJpliPd to
actions of the nPrves,-evt'o lhe nervell of fj.-.Jin:r.-''"ly ;-ht.t we
mean by conscient actions, certain actions ofdu: nerves and brain,
one or both.
Digitized by GoogIe
l'ut •hat good reason the immaterialis_ts have to say the
ner~'ous system posf-esses sensibility, I cannot divine ; for
their •• soul" or mind which they talk much, but kuow noth-
ing about, might be acted upon by impressions upon the ~>CD•
ses, if the nervous system possessed no p~operty different
from a piece of catgut, for aught any one car• say to the con·
trary. They cannot sa.)' but tbat their Mked soul, stuck on
to the end ofa stick oftimher, would hear the scratch ofa pin
on the oth<:r end, as readily as when an ear, an auditory
nerve, and a part of a brain, intervene between the soul and
the timber ; yet no man would say a stick of timbcr·possess·
es senstbility. According to the immatcrialilits, it is not the
nervous system that senses and thinks, but some immaterial
thing seated in the brain ;-why, then, in tbe name ofreason,
do they say the nervous system possesses sensibility ?
I know that immaterialists have made a sentence by puttine;
together certain ambiguous words in a certain order, whJ(:h
(hey call an argument against materialism. Some of them
sa,Y,-It is impossible to com:eive how intelligtnce can nrise
from any union or motion ofunintelligent atoms ;-others say,
it i!l impossible to conceive how sensibility can arise from any
motion or umon of insen~ible atoms.
As to intelligence, I believe that the meaning of the word
is 110 far from heing g~ncrally agreed on, that if lh·e hundred
person11 wer~ to gtve each his own definition, no two would
c)efine it preci~ely alike. I beliel·E' that, ai the word is gcne-
raiiJ used, it means notbm~ at all, or else means the same a•
the word knowledge; and I believe a man's knowledge is no-
thing other than his sensorial tendencies. Hence a mau may
havt! knowledge or intelligence when he is asleep; that is.
1Vhe11 he does·not thmk. Now it is much more conceivable
that a m11terial organ t~hould have tendencies to act certain
actions, tban it is that an unextended or immaterial thing
Digitized by GoogIe
a ...........-..
63
should have such tendencies.-The reader will diRcover what
we mf'an by sea!sorial tendencies, in another part of this
work ; and he will then see that the material1st does uot
maintain that intellige~&ce arise~ from aa~y combwataou of unin-
tdligent atoms.
As to eensibility, it is just as conceivable that this physio-
log•cal property sbuuld arise from the organic union of m~;eo·
sible atoms, as it is that acidity, or any other chemical pro··
perty, sbould arise from the chemical union of materials that
were not acid prior to sucb union. And I may W1th all_
<"OD·
fidence add, tbat we have as much evidence, and the !-a.me
kind of reason,for saying, that the nervous system is sensiule,
as we have for aaying that vinegar ia sour.
h is astonishmg that any man acquainteJ with chemistry,
should be so inconsiderate or so haady, as to assert, that it is
impossible for sensibility to arise from any union ofinsensible
atoms. The truth it!, faise notions got abroad thou~ands of
years ago, and gave rise to language which has continued ev-
er since, and which can but serve to perpetuate such notions.
The exalression, "sensibilit_y of the uervous system," carries
with it the idea ofsomething more than-of somethiug distiuct
from-the nervous sptem ; and it is exceediugly difficult to
admit that something MORE can arise from any union of mate-
rial elements.
As we are now upon the subject of organic union, we may
re11. ark, that it is less permanent thau cllht't mechanical or
chemical onion. Substance!! mechanically or chemically uni"
ted, ma.Y remain a great length of time withont undergoing
any cbange. Putty is formed t>y the mechanical union of oil
and ao earthy substance; blue vitriol is a chemical union ofsui·
pburic acid with copper :-both these snbstancet~ may be pre•
served from change an indefinite period. But iu organized
~daes, it is geoeraUy believed that internal cha!Jgcs are con·
Digitized by GoogIe
•
54
tinually taking place,-particles of matter being united with,
and constituting a part of the body at one time, aud at auotb-
er, taken up and carried out of the body: so that a certain
man of to·day, will not be precisely the same man to-morrow,
a!l it re!lpects the particles of matter ofwhich he is composed.
The addition of atoms which ent('r into the constitution of
organized bodies, is called nutrition; their removal is effect-
ed by a proce6s called absorption. When the nutrihon ex-
ceeds the ab!torption, the body is said to /!' ozo ; when the ab-
sorption exceeds the nutrition, it is said to pine.
Furthermore,-!he peculiar propertiP.s of organized hodies
or beings, depend on such nice proportions and arraugernent3
of material elements,-&ome of which are invisible...:._that
these properties may be annulled by changes in such bodies;
which changes cannot be detected by the ~enses. Thus the
nervous system shall ~e no Ionge•· in such a condition that
conscient actions can be excited in it by impre~sions upon the
!Cnses, i. c. it shall become ins•!usible; and Jet it shall appear
like a nervous sptem that is in a condition to act. The nice
organization of a muscle, on which its coutractility depends,
may no longer exist, yet it shall look very much like a muscle
in a condition .to act, aud shall still be called an organiud bo-
dy ; but there is none of that organization there, which I
speak of, for the most part, in thi.- work.
I have said that the nervous system may cease to think and
feel, and yet appear like a nervous sy~tern that is in a con-
dition to act. In this point, I may be di~pul(:d by the medi-
cal faculty, and I doubt myself whethe1 this ever can he, or at
least ever has been ;-we do not verJ often sec the nervous
system when it is in a condition to act ; if we did, we might
perhapl! find that it looks as much diiferent when it is dead,
as the :ountenance does.
There is this intont10vertible.fact: A'o man e-ver dies with-
Digitized by GoogIe
,
ur-- ..
55
otd pretio11sly suffering an important change in some one or
more ofhis organs.
A man docs not die because his " soul" flies away from
him! The truth is, a man is alive, as we express it, when his
organs are in a condition lo act, and when they are not, .he is
dead. This is all. A man never dies until his organs suffer
a change ; if he did, it would be some little shadow of e¥i- _/
dence ofthe existence ofsouls. Jf to die, is to have a soul fly
off from the body, it is passing "trange that in millions of in-
stancts it never once.flies off when the body is in health.
Again : Organized bodies 'having suffered such a change
that their physiological properties no longer exist,-they,
sooner or later, according to their composition and their situ·
ation as to heat and moisture, undergo other changes which
are more ob'1Jious, but not so important, ns the first changes.
These more obvious changes, which take place in bodies that
have by previous changes lost their physiological properties,
are chemical change~.
That.vegetables and animals, after suffering such a change
in their organization that their physiological propertie!l no
longer exist, soon undergo chemical changes, is a fact which
some have brought forward as evidence of the existence of a
life, i:ital spark, or t'!tal prinripic,-mcaning by this life, not a
condition of a body, but a real indf'pendent being. Their
talk is something as follow~ :-So long as the life of an animal
remains in the animal, it controls the laws! ofchemical action;
but when th•s vital j;park flies away from the organized body,
then the laws of chemical action which have heretofore been
controlled by it, exercise their wonted authority ; and chemi-
cal chaPges commence. Now all.thistallc appears to me like
so much nonsense-it is wor~e than absurd, for it is calcula-
ted to make some men think erroneously.-The truth is sim-
ply this : an organized bod)' is a combination of matenal ele-
Digitized by GoogIe
5i
mentR, comhined and arr:mged in a peculiar manner. and io
nice proportions. So long as it is duly supplied with food,
warmth. air, &c. it may continue to be an organized bting-
to be what is called a living and healthy body. But if, from
any cause whatever, evtn its own wear and tear, this healthy
condition be in some degree changed, the properties and ac-
tions of the organized body are impaired ; ifchanged in .a still
greater degree, these properties and actions are not only ex~
tinct, but the body suff~:r:; further changes which it would
not, had it not suffered previous_
changes.
Why certain proportions of certain material elements uni-
ted in a peculiar manner, should not undergo such chemical
change11 as they would were one or more of these materials
ahsent, or present in some other proportion ; or a:t they would
if ~omc other material should be added to them,-I can as
wt'll tell, and no better, as I can why a little salt aclded to
frc~>h meat should prevent the meat from suffering such chem-
ical changes that it otherwise would.
I may remark, that chemical changes do go on in organiz-
ed beings very frequently, btfore such beings are said to be
dead. Now if there be a ''vital spark" in animals lvhich
"(.Ontrols the laws of chemical action," (what an ambiguous
expression!) why do these chemical changes ever take place
before this mighty power quits the body ? The simple fact is:
this vital spark is nothing more uc.r less than orgaa.ization, and
is ofcourse something essentially different from what is to be
found in the kingdom of ino~anic mattcr.-lt would be ab-
surd to Fp<'ilk of organic union, and then say it is nothing es-
sentially different from chemical or mechanical union.
It may he well to observe in this place, that the immaterial
philotiophel'!l do not mean the same thing by the word life,
that they rlo hy the word soul. By the terms soul, m111d,
perceptive principle, or immortal sparit, they mean an imma-
Digitized by GoogIe
57
terial thing which is superadded to the organized body, and
which thinks, feels and moves the body while it is alive, flies
avray When the body dies, and 15et1St:S and thinks, One Or both,
independent of the body. Whereas, by the termt~ life, vital
spark, vital principle, generative principle, or "unknown
power,'' (as Magendie calls it,) they do not mean any thinking
thing ; but an immaterial thing, but ·for which organized bo-
dies would not be generated-would not grow-would not be
kept in decent order as a tenemt-nt for the soul.
Ac<.Ording to these philosophers, a vegetable has a life, and
an animal a life and a soul., It is to be remembered, they
hold that the life and the soul are two real entities-two
agents which may act, may do something ; and which are es-
sentially different from any material agent, being even unex-
tended.
Now whoever believes in the existence ofsouls, is an im·
malerialill, whether he believe in the existence of lives or
not ; and whoe,·er hP.lievPs in the.~nf liYes. i11 a vital-
ist, whether he believe it~ the existence of souls or not.
It may be worth our time to inquire why the belief in the
es.istence of' souls and lives, was ever so very general as ·it
formerly has been ; and even as it is at the present time
among those who are but little acquainted with the anatomy
and physiology of vegetables and animals.
We han• shown, that as chemical combination is a peculiar
mode of union which gives rise to properties that do notre-
sult from any other mode of union, so is organization a pecu-
liar mode of union which gives rise to properties peculiar to
itself. Owing to these properties, organized bodies exhibit
phenomena which inorganic bod•es do not. Men witness
these phenomena, and are led t.> think that they must be re•
ferred to something which is not to be found in inorganic
matter, as in truth they must. And in ancient times, when
8
Digitized by GoogIe
58
men bad a mean opanaon of matter, chemistry not having
taught them that by its union, all the peculiar properties of
compound bodies arise, thia eomt'thina waa supposed to be
some immaterial or spiritual agent, which enters organized
l»odiee, and dodges out again; leuing them an inert and life·
Ius maaa of matter, destitute ofall vital properties.
This notion, we may easily suppose, would be very gene·
n1 ; for it was not the result ofan abstruse speculation of one
man, but it arose from witnessing phenomena which were
present to all men. It was an opinion which the book ofna·
lure-an universal book-sumed to declare. This notion
having become general, gave rise to language which has ever
since served to strengthen and perpetuate it. And when we
consider that men are too cowardly or too lazy to search into
the truth of what every body believes-what nature at first
sight seems to declare-what they have been tau~ht from
their childhood, by parent, priest and primer__;,what the
langua111:e ofall nations seems to confirm :-when we con11ider
also, that the phenomena which first gave rise to the notion,
are still every where present, and are even brought forward
as proofs of its correctness-it is not very n1arvellous tbat this
strange notion, not Jess groundless than tho11e formerly enter•
",( · tained)'! witches, sho~l~ b~ as pr~valent as it ever has been.
Nevertheless, an opmaon as nothmg the truer for being gen·
enl or ancient. The time was when all men thought falsely,
so far as they thought at aU, concerning the movements of tbe
heavenly bodies ;-they took things to be as they appear to
be. And it is one principal object of this work to show that
all men who did not believe that man is constituted entire/!/ of
matter, do not believe things to be as they actually are in na·
tore.

CHAPTER VII.
On Vegetablu.
-Vegetables are iusensible organized bodies :-they are in·
aensible, because they have no ne"ous system.
'fbeir origin is not fortuitous ; but they arise from teeds,
roots or slips which are bodies organized by a pa_rent stock.
By virtue of this organization, they possess certain physiolog-
ical properties, so that when heat and moisture are present,
tbey begin to germinate, and ifsurrounded by such food ae
they have an affinity for, they take it up, and by intern~) ac•
tions which can never be known to man except by their ef·
fectli, tbia food becomes assimilated to the embrio plant, which
being thus enlarged, its plumule 11huots- up from the surface
of the soil, giving rise to the trunk and branches ; while the
rost~lshoots deeper into the soil, giving rise to what we call
the roots.
Stones are said to grow ; but stones, and all other inorga·
nic bodies which may be said to grow, grow by juxta-position
ofpartieles ; .that is, the particles adhere to the outside ;-
they do not enter into or pau by any part of the body to
which they are about to be added. But with orpnized bo-
die! it is not so. We presume that in all instances ~n which
a particle of matter is united with an organized body, such
particle first passes by some other particles whichare alleadJ
united with the body, constituting a part of it.
In what way the vessels of plants circulate their juices, it
is not fully determined. The suppOtition, however, that
these circulating vessels are contractile, best enables us to
a~count for all the phenomena connected with the circula·
Digitized by GoogIe
60
tion of their fluids. Still, so far as f know, the opinion that
the sides ofthe vessels attract the tluids, that extremity of the
"fessel towards which the ftuid flows, attracting with the great·
est force, is far from being proved erroneous. Perhaps the
ftuids are circulated partly by attraction and partly by con·
traction. For my own part, I have no very positive opinion
about the a.Jter, except I <-onfidently believe that the phe-
Domena -~hies, as well as of animals, arc the effects of
material causes-that there are no agenta or operative beings
In either but what are material. And I would furthermore
maintain, that whim I ascribe the peculiar properties of veg-
etables to organization, I give just as much an explanation of
them, as he does who says they depend o!l a life or a vital
principle. And there is this io my favor: we know there is
such a thing as organization-suc.h a thing as material ele-
ments united organically ; but we have not the least evidence
of the existence of a life. The hypothesis of life, also, gives
rise to many difficulties-many unanswerable questions that
cannot be asked, upon the supposition that vegetables arc
constituted entirely of matter : as we will now proceed to-
show.
The life of a vegetable being an entity distinct from the
matter of a vegetable, from whence comes it, and where, and
only where, does it reside ? Does the life ofeach little shrub
and plant come directly from the hand of God ? And if so,
did he create a life for every particular plant which ever has
or ever will exist, at the time be " created all things?" or is
he continually emanating fire-new lives for vegetables as they
apring up! Does the life of a vegetable ever exist any where
but in the vegetable ? He that says it does, ought to !>e able
to show some reason for his saying so. If it do not, what be-
comes of lhe life of a vegetable which dies-a vegetabl~ from
Digitized by GoogIe
-· ,. --- -- - ---
61
which the " vital spark" flies away ?• Does it straightway
dodge otfinto some other vegetable ? When a man clears five
acres ofhis wood-lot, do tbe trees on the remaining five acres
take a start all at once, and grow faster, or discover any oth·
er signs of having received a new life.
To say that you destroy the life of a vegetable when you
destroy its organization, would be saying what a cautious vi·
talist will not readily admit; for this would argue that the life
of a vegetable depen4s on its organi~ation, instead of its or-
ganization beingt'aused, modified, and maintained by its" life;
which would be taking away the supposed evidences of its
I
existence.
Nevertheless, this is the most rational method the vitalists
can suggest for getting rid of their lives of organized beings
when they die ; therefore we will grant it-we will grant,
whatever destroys the organization of a vegetable or an ani·
mal, destroys its life :-and then say :-
As there are no Jives flying otf from plants or animals when
they die, and as it is very difficult to admit that the God of
thousands of worlds is continually making new lives for the
numberless plants and animals that arc continually springing
forth; and furthermore, as the lives of trees and men exist
only \n trees and men, (taking this last for granted, until there
be some evidence to the contrary,) the que~tion arises: from
whence come the lives of new or young plants and animals,
but from the seeds from which they .z;pring ~ But it will not
answer to admit that a vegetable derives its life from the seed
from which it spring9 ; for according to this supposition, we
are driven toone of two pitiful alternatives : we must either
admit that an apple seed, six thousand years ago, contained as
• Whatever I may say relative to the fife of vegetables, will np·
ply with equal force against the life ofanimals, man not excepted.
Digitized by GoogIe
62
much Jife, or as many lives, as all the apple trees and apple
seeds that have ever originated, either directly or indirectly,
from this seed ; or els~ we must admit, that when any seed
begins to grow, new life begin& to be generated. But it would
be a fatal thing to 'Ditalism to admit that lite or Jives are gen·
erated by the propagation orgrowth ofvegetables or animals;
for this would be making life to depend on orga~ization, in-
stead of organization on life.
Finlllly, to give the vitlllists every possible chance to sup-
port their doctrine, let us make one more supposition, nod
the most rational of all that can be suggested. Let us sup-
pose that at the time the Deity "created all things," he crea·
ted one universal vegetable life, which pervades the air and
the soil, from which vegetables draw their support,-not a
distinct life for every species of vegetables; for since there
are thousand• of species, this would be multiplying the ma-
chinery by whkh nature works her ends, to an unwarrantable
degree.
The vitalists, then, cannot do better than to say, that one
universal principle was created for organized beings, or else
one for vegetables and one for animals.
I would now ask, bow one and tbe same vital principle
shall cause one see4 to become an oak and another a thistle ?
Oh, say the vitalists, this is owing to the nature of the seeds
themselves.-Very good. But what do you mean by nature
of seeds ? The vital principle is out of the question-there is
but one -it must of course be the same in all seeds : I repeat
tht: question,-What do you mean by nature of seeds ? Do
you not mean their make or conalitution ? Do you not mean
their organization ? I think this question must bP. answered
in the affirmative. If so, it follows of course that it is differ·
ence of organi7.atioo that gives rise to all the differences be·
/ tween vegetables. This being made out, I care for nothing

more ; but those who choose to fire away their powder and
shot in defence ofau insignificant, brain-begotten vital prioci~
pte, which is not capal1le of effecting any difference between
organized beings, still have the liberty to do so. But I shall
say that the word life, like the word soul, is a nel:ne without a
thing.

CHAPTER VIII.
General Remark• concerning Animal1.
An animal is a sensible, organized body.t
This I consider a correct definition ofan animal, and Jeball
adhere to it. But there are some instances in which it is dif-
ficult to determine whether a being be sensible or not, and of
course to determine whether it be an animal or not. The
reasons ofthis difficulty I will here attempt to show.
AU the higher orders of animals, and perhaps all beings
t Being convinced of the importance of a corrt•ct nomenclature
in the science of physiology, (which, io its broadest sense, includes
all I understand by metaphysiea,) I regret that the word sensible,
as well as the word sensibility, has been used in different senses. It
has been used io the technical or physiological sense, as I have
here used it, denoting a conscieot being, or a being in which sensa-
tions may be excited by impres.<~ions upon its organs ; it has also
been used in a popular st>nse, as whPn it is said ofone who can dts-
cern nice relations, aad think of all that rt>Iates to a subject, bP. is a
IM8i1Jk mao. And whf'n we say of a person oo whom impres- ·
!ions produce more than an ordinary t'ffect-n pt'rson whose finer
feelings or social passion!' are easily escited, he is a person ofgreat
Hn1ihilaty : we do oot use the word in its strictest physiological
sense.
The reader will ood that in this work tht> words 11msible and
sensibility will seldom, if ever, be used io any other tbao tbt:ir
l~boia.l~tiA;oificalions.

that are truly animals, possess a nervous system consisting of
two parts, which, though materially connected, subscrve two
distinct purposes. The one part performs the functions of
senl'ing and thinking; it is also instrumental in the production
of TJoluntary motions; but the other· part bas no direct share
in the production of the conscient phenomena, being wholly
subservient in the production of inTJoluntary actions, as the
actions of the circulating vessels and the alimentary canal.
These actions are vital actions, or in other words, they are
actions of contractile organs ; but they do not necessarily
suppose the existence offeeling or volition ; that is, they may
be, and indeed are performed without either. To distinguish
these two parts of the nervous system from each other, the
former has been termed the nenous system of animal life ;
the latter, the nervous systtm oj organic life. It is not to be
supposed, however, that these two syste:.ns are distinct from
each other in any other respect than that of the offices which
they fulfil. On the contrary, there are many nerves passing
from the one to the other, and so incorpor.atin~ them that those
organs which receive tht':ir nerves from the organic system,
undoubtedly receive along with them a few fibres from the
animal or feeling system ; and on this account these organs
may be the seat of pain, when in a morbid state. Bu~ these
few fibres from the animal system ofnerves, do not appear to
be necessary to enable these organs to perform their ordinary
functions ; for the 11ctions of these organ11 are not directly nor
generally controlled by t_he thoughts or sensations going on in
the ner\'ous system of animal life ; nor are their actions ordi-
narily accompanied with any sensation. It appears that this
connection between the two systems of nerves is designed, not
for ordinary, but for e:~traordinary purposes. By virtue ofit,
inflammations and other diseases ofthe heart, stomach, bow-
els, liver, &c. cannot go on to a final termination without pro-

aucing pain ; hence, by warning the individual or his danser,
~t may often be remol·ed. By it, also, a man's passions may
be expressed in his countenance, in a way which we shall at-
tempt to pomt out in the conrse of this work•.
Now as tilere is, in the higher orders of animals, ~uch a
thing as a nervous structure ; such a thing as contraction i
and such a thing as important and obvious vital actions 'llJith-
out any sensation, thinking. or volition ; so there may be be-
ings ofan inferior order which possess no nervous syt~tem o(
animal life, and ofcourse are never the subjects of any con-
sciousness ; but which may nevertheless possest~ a nervous
texture, an organic nertlot.U system, and a power of acting-
their actions being caused and controlled, not by thoughts,
not by conscient actions of a brain-but by material stimuli,
as are the actions of one's heart. Hence we m11y see organ-
ized automatons, posse~sing something that appear&~ like a
nervous texture, arad y'et not be sure that it is a sensible be-
ing-not be sure that it is an animal.
Here then lies one great difficulty in determining, in some
cases, whether an organized beit~g be an animal or not. Ano-
ther difficulty arises from the fact that an impression wbir.h
may excite a feeling, and a visible, and perhaps voluntary
motion in one organized being, may cJLdte to another organ·
jzed being a visible motion without exciting any feeling :-
we cannot see that action which constitutes a feeling ; and .i(
you touch a polypus. and the polypus contract, you do not
know whether the impre11sion which you make, acts direct/9
as a stimulus on the contractile fibre, or whether it gives rise
to the contraction through the medium of a mill, as immate•
rialist& would express it. The existence of the contractile
texture in any being is no proof oftbe existence ofa sensible
texture in the sante being.
1fthere be any organized automatous beings, which poa·

aess any'part suppt'.l8ed to answer the purpose of a nervous
system oforganized liff', but which are never the subjects of
any con11ciousness, I would neither call them vegetables nor
auimals, but zoophites. '
We desire to avoid any difficulties .that might arise from
not strictly adhering to our own definitions ofterf!lS• It mat-
ters not with us what materials a being is organized out of;
what its mode of existence may bt- ; or. io what way it may
propagate its species: if it do not possess the pbysiologioal
propertJ, sensibility, we say it is not an animal.
Some writers have laid down sensibility and locomotive
power as th~ peculiar characteristics of an animal ; bot pre-
sently they find that some beings arc able to move, in which
no traces of a nervous srstem can be found, and which dis-
cover no signs of feeling ; othel'fl · they find, which they call
plants, but which dJ!icover signs of sensibibility. They are
Dow very much put to their stumps, to draw a line of distinc-
tion between animals and vegetables. But if these men
wo.Jid only adhere e'en to the1r own definition ofanimal, they
wonld find less difficulty than they do. Instead of this, they
define an animal in one place, and perhaps in the next line
tell you that this definition will not bold good, because some
other thing quite different is also an animal. I will here in-
sert a passage to the point, from Good'o Book of Natur~.
•• Yet ifwe hence lay down consciousness or senaation and
locomotion as the two characteristics of animal life, we &hall
soon find our definition untenable, for while the Linnean class
of worms affords instuces, in pl'rbaps every one ofits order&,
ofanimals destitute of locomtltion, and evincing no mark of
consciousness or sensation, there are various species ofplants
that are strictly locomotive, and tbat discover a much nearer
approach to a sensitive faculty."
_ In tbia sentence Dr. Good baa clone as much·as to eay,-if
Digitized by GoogIe
67
we call a sensible, self-movingIM-ing, an tmimal, we 11hatl fincl
our definition untenable; for there are many animals which
have no locomotive power, and evincE' no mark ofsensibility,
as well as some plant• which are locomotive and discover
eign11 of sensibility. Now this is much the same as ifI should
define water, by sayin1 it is a taste.less al'd colourless tluid,
and then say th1s definition is untenable, for a sour and reddish
fluid [vinegar] is water. Surely, if we define an animal a
sensible, self-moving being, then no being is an animal which
is not sensible aJJd autoJDatous, let it be called a worm, a
watch, or what you please.
As to the stu.ff that animals are made of, it may he stated
that there is nothing to .,., round in them but what is to be
found out ofthem. We find that they are organized " out of
the ground," or " the dust ofthe ground," as stated in Geoe-
liis, chap. 2, v. 7, 1iJ.
Anima\ substances are analyzed, at the present day, in such
a manner that it seems impossible for any thing to be lost, ancl
we find that those animals which are not ofthe lowest orders,
are constituted ofthe following elementary substances : pbos·
phorus, sulphur, carbon, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium,
mangane1e, potasium, siliciuin, alumium, chlorine, oxygen,
hydrogen, axote, caloric, light and electricity.
There i11 nothing to be found in mao that is n.ot to be found
in other animals.
It has been a question with phy11iologists whether the blood,
while circulating in a living·animal, is a living substance or
not ; hut this is the same as to inquire whether it be organizecl
or not. For my own part, 1 believe the materials of the
blood are united organically.
The process by wbicb organized beings give rise to org:tD•
ized bodies, baa been considered as ver.f mysterious. But
wbeo aud whJ is there any propriety in saying auy thing ia
68
mysteriouf!l? lfwc do not say it is mysterious that one body
in motion puts another in motion by striking against it, then
there is no propriety in our saying 1t is mysterious that any
one event follows anotbPr, in case the event immediately f~
low ; and if we expunge from the catalogue of mysteries, · ' -
cases in which one event immediately follows another, the
will be no cases in which there ill any propriety in talking of
mystery, but those in which we suppose there are intervening
events between·two obvious events ; which intervening events
we cannot discover to our sati~faction. Whether, in the pro-
cess of generation, there be any more events whic-h we arc
unacquainted with, than there are in the processes of nutri-
tion, volition, or absorption, no rnan can say. But if th~re
be, they are events brought about by virtue of organization ;
and instead of racking our brains in conJeCturing what they
are! we say that the first male ~tnd female of each species of
animals were organized by the Deity in such a manner as to
be able to propagate their species ; and ifthey were able to
propagate their species, they were able to give r1se to other
animals like themselves, which, of course, were able to pro·
pagate their species in the.r tum, and so on, one generation
giving rise to another, to the present time.
We ought not to look upon a germ or embryo as any thing
distinct from the parent body with which it is intimatt'ly uni·
ted, but as a part of such parent body. To be sure, it is in
time to be separated from the body of which it is a part, by a
natmal proress instead ofan artificial one; but it is none the
less a pall ofthe parent body, so long as united with it on this
account, tha1a the l>air on one's head, or one's own heart. A
part (au ovum) of the female becomes developed, or in other
w()rds, grows so as to become a foetus, bec.ause all the parts
concerned are excited into adion by a peculiar kind ofstim-
ulus ; but this is no more wondt.rful tha~ that any other part

shoutd grow when duly fur.nished with nutritive matter. And
1 may add-he who t~ays generation is effected by the influence
or op.erations of•a" nisusformali"Dus which vivifies and shapes
the · :~erto shapeless spermatic matter," as Blumcnbacb baa
.,.,..o more explains to us the process, than another one
doe- · ~~rho says the whole process is accomplished by material
organs, which, by virtue of their organization, have the pow-
er of accomplishing it.•
As to the natural or original superiority ofman over other
animals, we may state in a few words in what it consists : it
consist~ in having hands and a better brain.-All the coosci~nt
pbe~1omena ma} be divided into two classes, sensing and think-
ing. To sense, is to have a sensation, that is, to bave a con•
scient ac"tion of a nerve ~nd the brain ; to think, is to have a
conscient action of th~ brain alone. Judging or reasoning,
remembering and imagining, arc but modes of thinking : in·
deed we can scarcely call th~m different modes, for as it re•
apects what goes on 10 the head, there is no essential differ·
eale laetween remembering, 'judging, imagining, and simply
f\'inkf-~g. When a man is said to remember, imagine, &c.
nothing other occurs in the brain than one thought [one con-
scient action of the brain] after another; but because these
thoughts may occur in different orders, because they may re-
late to different subjecti', and betause of other things which I
cannot here mention to advantage,-tbe terms rememhering,
• It may be remarked, that, hy virtue of organization, means
· as much, and no mnre, as, by rJirluc ofthole properliu or po1flert
slaicla arinfrom orKanization. ·
What, for instance, can be the difference betwl'en sAying tlu! ner-
t'Otu 11JilemJuls by virtue of it• orga,ization, or the 11ervou Byl·

judging, imagining, &c. have got info use. Nevertheless. we
are not to s•1ppose that any more than one single thought oc-
curs in a man's head at the same identical instant ; and as to
double, or compound, or compiez thoughts or ideas, there are
no such thin~. Now all modes of thinking, if such they may
be called, evidently go on in all animals, from a man down to
a mouse, and even several grades lower. But they do not go
on in the same degree of rfficiency, if I may use the best poor
terin I can think of. in the lower orders of animals, that they
do in man--owing to their not having the knowledge, i. e.
the uruoria/ tendencies ofa man.
I know it is very fashionable with the unfeathered bipeds
to extol human reason as a divine endowment, peculiar to
their own species ; but so far from their ev~knowing what
it is, I very much doubt if two out ofa thousand would define
it precisely alike. I am sure 1 should give the word reason
a definition altogether dift'erent from the sense in .which 1t ap·
pears to be generally used.
We have not enumerated the faculty ofcommunicating
ideas by sign!l, that is, by articulate sounds and marks on pa-
per, as a t1atural endowment of man which gives him superi·
ority over other animala ; for as the vocal organs of other an-
imals, and ofthe deaf and dumb of the human species, appt:ar
to be as perfect as those ofany men, we have good reason to
suppose that ifa man had the brain of a hone in his skull, he
could no more articulate than a horse ; anti if he could not,
and had also the anterior hoofed extremtties ofa bone instead
of arms and hands-why, then, if all men had always been so
formed, we should have bad no more language than hon:;ea
have. Hence we see that the natural superiorifJ of man doea
not, even in part, consist in the acquired faculty ofcommuni-
cating ideas. '

that man first rer.cived his language directly ~rom heaven ;
but its origin cag be very satisfactorily accounted tor, without
aucb a supposition as this. The .band is what has enabled
men to bring their language to the present state of perfection.
Among our remarks relative to animals in general,-we may
ttate, that the intellectual or conscient functions of the brain,
are performed in a manner more or less perfect, according to
its natural make and condition. We say, according to its con-
dition, for the brain of the ~ame individual is not at all times
in the same condition or state. It is not in such a state in
infancy and old age as in middle life; and like all other parts
eftbe body~ it is liable to be diseased.
As to original make, the brains of individuals who ltelong
to tbe same S(JeCiefl, widely dift"er. Some men, for instance,
hue a good large plump brain, ~ indicated by a high fore-
head, standing well forward, the temples being full and distant.
Apel'&('n with such a bead, you might take for a natural ge•
DiU!! without much' risk of mistake, ifyou only knew that the
internal organization of his brain is good, and is not envel-
oped by uncommonly thidc skull and membranes·; but as
some brains are, as we may pay, phlegmatic, and not very ac-
tive-not easily·and readily acquiring strong umoriallendtn·
cie1 by exercise ; and as others may be enveloped in uncom;.
moniJ thick skull and membranes, a large head, even on a
small bodY, is no~ a sure indication o( natural superiority as
to thinking abilities. So on the other hand, a man's head·
may be rather narrow, from temple to temple-his forehead
may be low, and soon receding back, and his eyes, instead of
beiog sunk, as it were, into his head, may be nearly as nigh
to you as the 1up~rciliary ridgls of bis osfronlis which arcb
over them ; still such a headed man may " know something;"
but as a general rule, you may conclude there.is no great share
oforiginal nuceptibility in auch a looking bead.

As to the condition of the brain, it is never altered f1·om a
3tate of heallh without a corresponding alteration in its. abili-
ty to think. In infancy it is softer, and in old age it is more
dry aud rigid than in middle age ; and at these two periods it
performs its functions as imperfectly or feebly as do the oth·
er organs of the S)'stem at the5e periods. Diseases, injuries,
and spirituous liquors, disenable it for performing ita intellec-
tual functions at all, or cause 1t to act very feebly and irregu-
larly-as we see in cases ofasphyxia, apoplexy, hydrocepha-
lus, ebriety, compressed brain from depression of a part of the
skull, &c. The brain (and comequently is functions,) is
also under the influence of sex and climate, as are the other
org:ms of the system. Finally, we may lay down the po-
sition (which, if disputed, can never be refuted,) that we have
just the same kind of evidence tbat sen~ing and thinking are
functions of the nervous system, as we have that the secretion
of bile is a function of the liver, or the secretion of urine a
function of the kid nics. And there would be just as much
sense and propriety in my saying the bile is secreted by a bil-
iary agent distinct from the liver, as there is in immaterialists
saying that thinking is performed by a soul, mind, or thinking
agent distinct from the brain. Nor do immaterialists better
the matter by acknowledging, as some of them have, that it is
as much a function of the brain to think, as it is of the liver to
secrete bile, provided they add-the brain is enabled ta per-
form this function by the superaddition of a ''percipient prin-
ciple."-A distinct agent is a distinct agent, (.all it by what
name you please, whether mind, soul, percipient principle,
or something else. lfimmaterialists say that the brain is en-
abled to think by means ofa percipient principle superadded,
1 will say the liver is enabled to secrete bile by means of a
bile-secrettng principle superadded, and then ask them how
this sounds.

CHAPTER IX.
On the .Neroous S!fslem.
The nerl·ous system consists ofseveral parts between whicb
there are obvious marks ofdistinction.; but we cons•der them
as parts of one system, hecause they are not entirely ~cpara­
ted hy the inten·ention of any thing that is not ofthe nt"rvous
texture. Different parts of the nervous system perform d•f-
fereut functions ; hence the reader will not be surpri!led to
hear us speak of the o;gans of the nervous syslem. Indeed,
custom justifies us in speaking of two nervou'~ systems in the
same animal-a nervous system of animal life, and a nervous
system of orgamc lifP., as an ingenious Frencb physiologist has
caiiE'd them.
The Nervous System of Animal Life consists of the brain
which fill~ the skull; tbe spinal marrow-or more properly,
spinal cord-which extends from the brain through the whole
10
T4
length orthe vertebral column ; and all the nerve• which rre·
ceed from the brain and spinal cord. These nerves are dis·
tributed more or less plentifully to every part ofthe bl.'dy in
which a sentcation may be excited.
The brain is a pulp) body ol very irregular figure, having
a number of projections and depressions, corresponding part·
ly with the irregularitie11 of the skull, and partly produced by
convolution~ and cavitiu in thE> brain itself. Scarcely any
thing is known with respect to the ust> of these projections
and depressionta ; therefore we shall not give a part1cular de-
V-ription of them; nor 11hall we describe the membrane•
which envelop the brain and dip into its fissures-some of
them enleringlhd lining what are called the cavities of the
brain. But it is nece68ary to remark, that what I hav& here
called the brain, is generally described as consisting of four
principal divisions, called cerebrum, cerebellum, ponB Varoiii,
and m~dulla oblo,•g·1ta.
The cerebrum completely fills the upper part of the cavlly
of the cranium or ekull, being several times larget than the
other three parts collectively. It is divided into two equal
puts, called hemi5pheres, which are taeparated vertically by
the falx, a membrane which dips down from the skull. This
vertical separation does not extend through the whole depth
ofthe-cerebrum in its central part, but it divides it complete•
ly before and behind. The under surface of each hemi!!phere
ir divided into three lobes, an anterior, middle, and posterior.
The cerebrum, and the cerebellum also, consists of two sub·
atancea of different colourt1 and consistence ; one of which is
~r the most part exterior to the other. The exterior sob-
stance is of a light bl'own colour, very vascular. more soft
than the inner, and has a glandular appearance when exAm-
ined hy the microscope : it is c:\lled the cineritious or cortical
substance. Tbt: lower ancl central portion -
of tbe cerebrum
___ Digitized byGoo~Ie
'75
is white, and in man is largn in proportion to tbe eortical
substance, than in oth~r animals. lu'the footus it is less abun•
daot in proportion to the corticalsub~tanct:, than in the adult.
It is called the medullary snbstance.
I mention these ditfer~nt substances of the brainr because
a3, in the same species of animal3, like etructurcs have like
appearances, and perform like functions, it may be inferred
from this far.t alone that the cortical and medullary portions
of the brain perform different functions ;-and we hne good
reason to euppolle that the cortical secretes a subtile fluid,
but is not seusible, wh1le conscient actions take place in the
medullary portion. Take an animal and slice off portions of
the corticr.l part of its brain, and. it will exhibit no signs of
pain, nor will you destroy its ability to think and move ; but
when you get pretty well down into tbe medullary part, you
produce pain and contractions of the voluntary muscles, and
finally destroy \be animal's ability to thinlt Ami move, t~t ie,
kiU it.
Below the cE-rebrum and cerebellum, we find the pons "»t¥-
rolii, which is formed by processes from the cerebrum and
cerebellum. From this part the mtdulla oblongata proceeda
downwards and backwards under the cerebellum. The me•
duUa oblongata soon reache! a large hole an inch or two pos-
terior to the centre of the base of the l'kull, called thefora-
men magnum of the occipital hone. As soon as the medulla
oblongata passes this foramen, it enters .the spinal canal, and
takes the name ofspinal cord, or spinal marrow.•

From the lowf!r rart of the brain proceed nine pairs of
nerve::, mn,;t of them from the medulla oblongata, some from
t)w cerebrum, but none from tbe c.ercbellum. These nerves
are whit~ cords, consisting mostly of medullary matter; and
it It! impo~siblc for the an:ltomist to trace them to 'one com-
mon centre or point in the brain ; but there can be no doubt
but that thPy all have a connexion with that part of the brain

Behind the olfactory ner,·es are the optic. These are the
nerves of vi11ion. 'fhey pat~s through holes in the back part
of the sockets of the eyes, and (brough the thick strong coat
ofthe eye ball. Here they expand eacb into a semi-tran~pa­
rent, pulpy membrane, called t·elina. Rays of light passing
through the anterior transparent coat, and through the hu-
mors ofthe eye-ball, fall upon the retina and excite that con-
scient action in the optic nerves and brain which constitutes
seeing.
The optic nerves in passing from their origin to the eyes,
run towards each other, and either cross each other so that
the one which arises from the right side of the brain, goes to
the left eye, and vice versa ; or else having united with each
other without any interchange of fibres, they again recede,
each nerve forming in its course to the eye an obtuse angle.
Anatomists are '1\0t agreed as to the nature of this union ; but
there are pathological facts which favor the opinion that they
cross each otiJer.-ln many instances in which the ~· ision of
one eye bas been destroyed by some disease or injury of the
brain, or of an optic nerve before its union with its fellow,
such disease or it•jury has been foulJd by dissection to be on
the side opposite the affected eye.
The third pair of nerves are distribute~ to the muscies
which are attached to the eye-ball, and rolf it upwards aud
downwards, inwards and outwards.
The fout th pair of nerves are so small that they appear like
sewing thread. 'fhey arc exclusively appropriated to a small
muscle ofthe eye.
Thefifth pair of nerves are the largest nt'rves that arise
from the brain ; they have a very t!Xtensive distribution
about the scalp, face and mouth-goiog to mu~:cles, mem-
br&ues, glands, skm, &c. It is importat.t to mention that the

This branch, which is distributed to the tongur., i• called the
lingual or gustatory nerve. An anatomist of Rome, Colum-
bus I think his name was, ono:e had an opportunity to dissect
a man who never had any power of tasting-all foods antl
drinks exciting no other sensation in his mouth than that of
feeling. The gul!tatory nerve was fouud wanting.
· We here ~ee, in th_e case of the fifth pair of nerves, that
branchefl of one and the same nerve ~re the immediate organa
of two different kinds of aen~ti~ tasting and feeling,
Ht>nce we have reason to supposKitlat it is diffe.:ence in the
organization ofthe organic extremities of nerves, that enables
one nem to be excited by one class of agents, and another
only by agents altogether different.
The sixth pair ofn!'rves are small, and pas& to certain mus·
~It; of the eye ; but before they reach the eye they send offa
small twig, which, being joined by another small twigJrom a
branch of the tifth pair, passes out of the skull through the.ca-
nal which admits the <.arotid artery, and unites with the up-
pcr.extremity of the upper cer\ical ganglion, which ganglion
is a nervous body belonging to tLe ntrvous B!JSlem oforganic
life.
We may consider the upper end orthis ganglion as one ex·
tremifJ of the organic nervous system, and these twigs from
the fifth and six1h pairs constitute one of the several commu·
nications between the animal and organic sy&tems.
The uvwth pair of nerves comprise~ two distinct cords on
each t~irle, whith have very d•tfereut destinations ; and have,
therefore, been considered, by sevel'al anatomists. as different
nerves. One (\f these ner\es is appropriated to the interior
of the ear, and is the proper auditory nert>e. The other ia
principally spent upon the face, and baa been called thefa·
ciul; they are, however, more frequently called the seventl&.

iis contact, and their making their exit from the cavity of the
' cranium, through one foramen. But there is a (treat ditfer·
ence in their texture ; hence one is called the portio dura, or
bard portion, a9d the other portio mollis, or soft portion. It
is the portio mollis that is the essential organ of hearing. It
terminates in a pulpy esp11nsion on the internal surface ofcer·
tain sacs and canals, which constitute parts of what is called
the internal ear.
T~ give a particular description of the apparatus of hear-
ing, would be to enter into one of the mo't difficult parts of
anatomy. We might 5ay a great deal, and then not be un·
derstood but by tho3e already acquainted with this apparatus.
But it is necessary that we define the names of ..:ertain agents
and .actions concerned in the production of hearing.
A sound is a vibratory motion impressed on the particles oi
bodies hy percussion, or any other cause. When the parti·
cles of any body have thus been put in action, they communi·
cate it to the elastic bodies which surround them ; these act
in the same manner, and thus the vihratory motion is comma·
~aicated, oftentimes, to a great di!ltance. Elastic bodies alone,
generally speaking, are capable of suffering that vibratory mo·
tion of their particles wh1ch constitutes sound. If these vi-
brations are not equal to thirty in a second, they will not give
rise to that action in the auditory nerves artd btaio which coo·
atitutes hearing, or in other words, they do not constitute
1ound, according to our dull organs. Some have used the
wprd sound, not only to denote the cause of hearing, but the
aensation itself; but this use of the word is improper, and has
given rise to disputes about such questions as this : when a
tree fall5 in the wilderness, is there any sound ·,f there be no
animal with.in miles of the tree?
Now the use of the extemal ear, or what is commonly cal·
led the tar, is to collect the souo1ous vibrations of the air, and
Digitized bvGoogle
80
direct them into th€' meatus auditorius txlernus, which is a ca·
nallead10g to the membrana tympani, which is a tense, thin,
circular membrane, stretclu~d across the inner extremity of
the external meatus, forming a complete partition between
this canal and the tympanum, whic.h is a cavity that constitutes
what anatomists call the middle ear. Across this cavity is
extended a chain of very small bones, one end ofwhicb chain
is attached to the centre ofthe membrana tympani, the other
end to the membrane which closes the foramen o-cale. Pa~s
this mP.mbrane, and you are in the 'Destibulum, which is a cen·
tral cavity or point, where all the other cavities oftbe internal
ear communicate. These cavities are lined with a pulpy ex-
pa·n~ion of the auditory nerve, and are filled with a limpid flu-
id, called the fluid of Cotunnus.
Now when vibrations ofelastic bodies, such as the air and
liquid,;, make impressions upon the membrana tympani, an ac-
tion is communicated to the chain of bones, as well as to the
air in the tympanum; ·(for the tympanum receives ·airthrough
a tube reaching from the back part ofthe mouth;) this chain
or bones trausfers the action to the ml.'mbrane that closes the
foramen ovale, and this again to the ftuid ofVotunnus, and this
to the auditory nerve, and this agaiu to the brain; and thus is
that actiotl excited which constitutes the sensation called
hearing.
The eighth pair of nerves is ofteu called the par 'Dagum, on
account of its \'cry exten11ive distribution. This nerve sends
· branches to the muscles which constitute, in part1 the organs
of re~piration and voice ; it also sends important branches to
the nervous system of organic life-branches which assist
nerves ofthis system in formiug net-works or plu:uses, as they
are called; which are nervous cords uniting with each other
in all direction~, leaving little !~paces or meshes between.

partly on this account, too, that these organs, particularly the

1Joluntary motion;• but they .do not go directly nor plentifully
to all organs which po!lsess any degree ofsensibility or con-
tractile power, as we Phall sec when we come to treat of the
mervous system of OI'Jtanic life.
Among the parts entirely destitute of sensibility, we may
J'eckon the bones, cartilllge!l, and tendons, to mention no oth-
er. These parts are llestitute ofnervt-s ; and it is on this ac-
count that no conscient ac.tion-no feeling-cl\n be excited in
them ; you may pinch. pull, cut, or bum them, without pro-
ducing pain or any other sen11alion, if you do it wjthout ma-
king any impressi.>n on the neighbo1ing parttt which are sen·
aible. It has been said that when these parts are intlamed
they are pai-nful ; but some, if not all, ofthe most learned mo-
dern physiologists, consider this opinion erroneous. The
truth is, (as they beheve,) when these parts are diseased, they
irritate the nenes of the surrounding parts, and thus give rise
to the pain. Should any fact ever prove that these parts,
when inftamed, are the actual scats ofsensations. then it would

not to be discovered by our sense~ ; and we should be under
the necessity ofadmitting that !nftamrnation ofthese parts may
so affect their nerves, that cooscient actions- may be excited
io them.
Some circumstances conneded with the anatomy of the
brain yet remain to be noticed; one is, the great quantity of
blood transmitted to it by the arteries. Haller «'oocluded
that one fifth of the blood of the whole system went to the
head, although the weight ofthe human brain i! not more than
one-fortieth of that of the whole body ; hut admitting the
brain to receive onlyone-teoth of the blood, this will be ave-
ry great over-proportion. The great quantity of blood re-
ceived by the brain is one evidence that this organ performs
very ~mportant functions ; and as those organs which secrete
.fluids. and which are called gland11, receive large proportions
of blood, we have additional reason for supposing that one
fuuctioo of that complicated organ, the brain, is to secrete a
nervous 8uid-we believe, as we have said, that it is tbe cio-
eritious part ofthe brain which secretes this tluid.
Another circ.umstance is, that the brain has no lymphatic
absorbent ves11els, at least, no such ves11el!! can be discovered,
~ven with the ard of a microscop~ ; and considering ttie size
of the brain, and the great quantity of blood which it receives,
we should expec.t its absorbents, if it had any, would Le pret·
ty large. But as this fact has some relation with the pbetlo-
mena of remembering, we 11hall advert to it in another place.
As to the chemical and physical properties of the nervous
matter, they are obviou!!ly peculiar to itself, unlike what we
meet with in any other of the constituentt~ of the body ; but
wherever it is to be found, it exhi&its nearly the same proper-
ties. It is generally agreed that the medullary part of the
llrain ia fibrous, and that these fibres are placed io such a di·
Digitized by GoogIe
84
rection as to converge towards th,e'base of the brain. It ap-
pears from the microscopical o(,&ervatious of several physiol-
ogi&h;1 that these fibre£1 are chains of globules, connected to·
gether by a peculiar g'utinous substance.
A fibrous structure is disco,·ered in the spinal cord, though
less distinct than in the brnin. Tbe fibrous structure of the.
nerves of animal life is very obvious; but the ultimate ner-
. vous filament is not £1opp011ed to be a chain of globules, like
that ofthe brain, but a cylindrical canal, containing a viscid
pulpy matter. · With respect to the nerves oforganic life, and
the branches of the eighth pair from the head, (which branch-
es, after assisting in formiug a plexus, go to involuntary mus-
cles without entering a gangliou,) the disposition of their fibres ·
difters from that of the other nerves. These fibres, instead
of being straight and parallel, are irregularly connected with
each other and twisted together.
As to the ~~~e of the nervous sy11tem of animal life, it is
not our intention to say much in this pldce. But rt may be
well to just glance at aome of the etftcls "·bich arise frem
certain experiments, disea10es and injuries.
By dividing or compresPing, as by a li~turP., the nerves
going to any part or organ, you destroy the power of such or-
gan to sense. Tie the olfactory, optic, auditory and gustato- ·
ry nerves, and you disenable the animal to smell, see, hear,
aud tat~te. Tie all the other nerves from the brain and spinal
cotd, or instead of tying these last, tie the cord as eooc as it
issues from the foramen magnum, and yon destroy, as we may
say, the sensibility of every part of the body ; and not ooly
eo, but you Lomplelely drsenable the animal to move.-lfthe
auimal might still tbmk, not a muscle co11ld he contract ; o(
c:ooree, nut a member could he move, lhough be wJJ to
mov~ them ever so greatly.
Were at possible (Qr an io!ant to be born and to grow to the

iize of an adult, with a ligature. or something to ~e same ef-
fect, around every nervous elongation that proceeds from the
brain, such bein~ would never be the subject ofany sensation,
thought, or emotion-in a word, would never be the subject
ofany more consciou!ness than a block of marble ; and, let
his muscles be ever so good, he would no more possess the
power oflocomotion than any other body you can mention.
This is no speculation-it is plain matter of fact, as every
physiologist well knows ;-he is as certain of it as the astron·
omer is that the earth turns on its own axis.
If, by any means, the lower and central part of the brain be
compressed, all coosciouaness cease!·'until such pressure be
removed. I( the spinal cord be compressed in its course, all
puts receiving nerves that issue from below this spot, can no
loogt'r feel nor be moved by the will.
We have said that a great proportion of the upper part of
the bram may be removed without immediately aff~cting the
animal's ability to think and move ; but it is not so with the
lower and medullary part. And the lower down you get, the
more mischief to these powers do you do; but yet it is pro-
per to mention that thi11 lower part of the brain will suffer ve-
ry gradual changes, in what may be called its mechanical or
phy&ical organization, without affecting its functions"so mucb
as the effects ofsudden changes would lead us to expect.
The fact is, whatever operates suddenly on organized bo·
dies, affects their nir.e internal, physiological organization
more, in proportion to the effects produced oo its physical or
mt>chanical structure, than causes which operate gradually-
giving the organ, as we may t~ay, some chance to accommo-
date itself to the change. Now it is this nice, internal, physio·

The Nervous System of Organic Life consists oftwo claains
ofg:wglions situated within the body! one on each t~ide of the
apinal column ; and of the infinite number of small nen·es
"'hich proceed from these ganglions.
'fhe ganglion!! are little reddish or greyish bodies, ofa tex-
ture which ha11 nothing in common with that of the cerebral
aubstance, being rather spungy than pulpy. Thetie bodies,
a11 well as the nerves which issue from them, posse!ls but a ve-
ry low degree ofFensibility. Bicbat has ~hown that they may
be powerfully irritated in a living anirral without the animal
exhibiting signs of suffering ; but if you irritate a nerve from
the brain or !~pinal cord, the animal instantly cries out and
etruggles. l think it more than probable that what little de-
gree of sensibility the organic system possest!es, is owing tea
the many twigs which it receives from the animal system.
It must be remembered that the nerves of any organ are
what enable the organ to sense,*' and although it is a common
way of speakiug, to 11ay of •uar.h organ, il ia_sen.•ible, sliU it is

"the ganglion& strung alon~ on each side of the spine, from

c~ds straight along, from one ganglion to another. Each

CHAPTER X.
On the Muscular System.
We have already !laid that the contractile texture is the
most important texture in those organs calle~ muscles or
muscular ; we have al~o shown that we mean by contractile
texture, a texture that may be excited to contract by a shm·
·ulus.• We think it proper to call every organ in the animal
system, which po~!'esses the contractile texture, a muscular
organ, whP.ther custom approve of our doing so or not.-
Hence, to determine whether an organ be muscular or not,
we do not pick it to pieces, and squint at it with our poor
eyes, to see ifwe can discover good large red fibres ; but we
query whether or no it contract on the application of a stim•
ulu'l. Should the organ be so miout~. so situated, or its con·
tractions so trifting. that we cann.ot discover its contrac·
tions with our 11enses, we consult reasoo.-Should there be
several facts which may hctter be accounted for by supposing
such organ to contract, th:an in any other WilY ; and if there
be no one fact to prole that such organ does not contract,
we conclude that it coutracts, and of course, call it a museu·
,Jar organ.
In man, and in all the higher orders of animals, there are
two muscular system!', ditfcring ~ssentially from each other io
form, in texture, in the nature of the stimuli by which they
are excited into action, and in the functions which they per-
form.
The muscles of one system are under the control of the
will, and are called tJolu11lary muscles, or musclr.s ofanimal

life, and we may sometimes <'all them the solid muscles. The
muscles of the otb~r system arc not under the control of the
wiJI, and are called int~olur&tary. hollom• or organic muscles.
The Voluntwy .Muscles, by their contractions, give rise to
all tho11e action£ which a man may perform or not perform, as
be chooses. They are uot immediately concerned ih the cir·
culatioo of any maUer, either ..uid, pultaceous, nutritive, or
excrementitious ; hence they are not immediately concerned
in the growth and nutrition ofthe body : they are immediate-
ly concerned in proqaring the materials for this nutrition ;
but the muscles of organic life work upon these materials and
distribute them to every part of the body,. As it is by the
aid of the system of voluntary muscles that we act upon sur·
rounding bodies, and even express our thoughts and sensatioD:S
to .our fellow beings, or in other words, as it is by this system
of muscles that we maintain a relation with the world.aro.und,
it may with propriety be called the muscular system ofrtla·
tionr-an appeJJation already given it by the French physiol-
ogists.
This system of muscles, including its vessels, (which in-
deed are little muscular organs of the organic eystem,) is o£·
more considerable size than any other system oforgans in t~
animal economy. Besides the numerous regions that the~
muscles fill, they are generally spread out under the skin, an~
protect, like it, the adjacent ,,arts, and like it, can bear t~e
action ofexternal bodies without the fatal consequenc.es that
would arise from a lesion of the deep~r seated organs whic"
they defend.
From the -external form of these muscles, they may be di·
vided into long, broad al\d short. The long ones occupy i~
geueral the limbs ; they are situated in a sort of fibrous gut·
ter which retains them powerfully, so that when they contract,
they do not displace themselves as they otherw~e wo.uld.

'llley are in general much thicker in their middle than at
their extremities ; this arises from the abundance of fteshy fi-
bres at this part, which fleshy fibres are the proper muscular
or contractile fihres. As you proceed towards the .endl! of
these muscles, the contractile fibres become less numerous,
until, in many instances, they wholly disappear ; and what
ekes out the muscle and attaches it to the bone, is a strong,
compact, white cord, which as of a nature altogether different
from the middle or belly of the muscle.
This cord is destitute of sensibility and contractility, two
important physiological properties, both of which are possess·
ed by the belly of tbe muscle.-Jt takes no active part in the
production of motion, and when separately considered, we
call it a tendon, and should never thank of calling it a part of
a muscle, were' it not for the inconvenience that would arise
in describing the muscles, if we did not consider them as in..
eluding this part.
In some instances the tendon ofa muscle is longer than the
fteshy or contractile part.
Tbe long muscles almost always have both of their ends
attached to bones ; and in all such instances, they pass by an
articulation-[an articulation is the union of one bone with
another]-an articulation, too, which admits of a motion be·
tween the bones artkulated. This is what we should expect,
knowing that the use ofthese muscles is. by their contraction,
to move one bone upon another, and thus to produc.c tbe mo-
tions of the body. Now when a muscle contracts, it doea
not move both bones to which it is attached, but it moves
one bone upon the other ; and in speaking ofthe attachments
ofa muscle, we say it arises from that bone which generally
t'emains stationary when the muscle contracts, and that it is
inserted into the bone which it moves.
I may here remark, if you divide a muscle in a living ani·
Digitized by GoogIe
arw --
91
mal, or an animal that bas been but a short time dead, the
divided ends will retract from each otber,-th~ limb to which
the muscle is attached being in its natural extended position.
This retraction is owing to the organization of the contractile
part ofthe muscle, and not to that ofits tendinous part. There
are several facts relati~·e to this retractioll of the end!! of a di·
vided muscle, worthy of notice. If the animal be in a weak
and sickly state when the muscle is divided, the retraction
will not be so great as if the animal were 6trong and healthy.
And in case the animal have recently died, the retraction will
be infinitely less if its death were occasioned by a stroke of
lightning; by a diffusible and active poison, as prusic acid;
or by any cause that instantly destroys the secretion ofntMlOU$
fluid, than if ocr.asioned by some other cause.
Owing to the above mentioned facts, some physiologists
have ascribed to muscles a physiological property whicb w~
have not mentioned, and which they called tone, or tonicity.
And it must be admitted, that if the extended state of a mus-
cle be its natural state, the retraction which we have mention-
ed is not one ofthose facts which lead us to say a body is elaa-
tic or pOtsesses elasticity--see p. 44. Consequently·th16 re-
traction must be ascribed to a property peculiar to organized
beings, that is, a physielogical or.vital property. But instead
ofgiving muscles a peculiar property besides their contractil·
ity, on account of this retraction of its divided ends~ I would
attribute it to that organization on which their contractility
depends, and say it is a manifestation of contractility without
a stimulus.
The broad 11oltmtary muscles occupy in general the parie·
tes or walls of the cavities of the animal system, as those of
the thoraJ' or abdomen. They form in part these parietes,
defend 'beioteroal organs, and at the same time, by theilmo-
Digitized by GoogIe
tioil~ _usist their functions. Their thickness is not great1
most of them appearing like q~uscular membranes.
The short muscles are those in which the three dimensions
are nearly ~qual, having a thickness in proportion to their
width and length. They are generally found in places in
which much power is required, and but small extent of mo·
tion permitted.
The muscles which we have been speaking of are each en-
closed in a sort of mcmbraneous sheath, and for the most
part are separated fl'om each other to some little distance by
the interposition of cellular membrane-the many little cells
ofwhich are sometimes ailed with fat. But more than this,
the muscles themselves are fonned of bundles of fib• cs called
larerti, each of which is also enclosed in a sheath of mem-
bralle ; these lacerti are also divisible into still smaller bun·
dies, and these again into smaller, nppar1mtly without any li-
mit,-each IJUudle Still having a very delicate membrane of
its own.
Physiologists suppose, however, that there is an ultimate
muscular fibre, which has its own nervous twig and its own
capillary, ontritive vessel ; and much speculation about the
nature ofthis fibre has been offered. But at present we will
speak of such fibres, or rather bundles of fibres, as may be
d-
istinguished by the naked eye.
In some muscles, even very long one~, the fibres run the
whole length ofthe deshy mau; hnt io other cases they have
an oblique direction forming what are called penniform mus-
cles. In such cases there is a membrane in tbe body of the
muscle to which the fibres are attached.
Bichat says, that " Every muscular fibre runs its coul'!le
without bifurcating or dlViding in any manner." He says,
too. tbat " All the fibres ofthe voluntary muscles are straight,
th()jO ofthe sphincters excepted." Yet when a muscle is lib-

erated from its attachments, it may contract so as to give its
fibres a wave-like appearance.
Mucb more force is required to rupture Jiving than dead
mut~cular fibres, or io oth.er words, when an animal is in that
condition called living, the particles of matter which consti·
tute its mulicular fibres adhere together in a much gruter de-
gree than when such animal is dead. But this is not the cue
with the fibrous textures ; to which class of textures belon'

With reepect to blood ·vessels, there are no organs so
plentifully supplied with them as the muscles, excepting some
oftbe viscera. The arteries are distributed among the fibres
in numer~u~; branches, which divide and subd1vid~ with tto
much minutene::ss, as at length to become no longer visible.
The ca1?illary veins are equally as numerous as the arteries,
but the marner in which the arteries are connected With the
veins, is uot accurately a~>certained.
The appal'lltus of nerves which is sent to the muscles, i11
very considerable ; and especially to those which arc under
the control of the will, being grealer, iu proportion to their
size, than to any other part of the body, except the organs of
the senses.
As to the size and nature of the ultimate muscularfibre, or
that fibre which cannot be divided w1thout a breach of sub-
stance, the mtcroscopical anatomists do not agree. Leeuwen·
hoek supposed that ~any thousands ofthem united t~ form
one visible fibre. Sir A. Carli11le describes the ult1mate fibre
as a solid C)huder, the covc:riu~ of which Ill a ret&culated

larly granulated, and ofvery little cohesive power when dead.
Bauer makes out that it is about 1-2000 ofan inch in diam-
eter ; some have con3idered it as straight, some as zig-zag or
waved, some as knotted, some as being solid and others as
hollow, while othe1·s consider it as jointed, c.onsisting of a
number of parts connected together like a row of beads.
Another opinion was, that it is entirely composed of "·es•
aels, either possessing some peculiar arrangement or consist·
ingoftbe small branches of arteries. Another opinion zeal-.
ously .defended by Cullen, was, that the muscular fibres are
· ,.., .eoiiblmous wi th those of the uerves ;-that they are in fact
nerves under a different structure, &c. &c. But all these
conjectures do nol help ue in the lelld to rrplain the pheno-
mena of contraction ; and I only advance them to show tbat
learned men of renown have suffered themselves to advance
notions that arc not in themselves plausible, and if tru~, do
not help us to explain any thing.
We have already ~aid that if the nerves going to a volunta-
ry muscle be divided or compressed, in any part of their
c:ourse from the brain to the muscle,* the will has no more
power over the muscle until the nerves be restored to their
natural state again. We may here add, that if the arteries
be tied so that no blood can go to the muscles, or the veins
tied so that the blood cannot return from them, their contrac-
1ility is soon extinct.
We believe that the ncrve5 going t~ the voluntary muscles

voluntary muscles fulfil, to wit : convey something to them
which intimately unites with them, and assists in making out
that crganization on which their contractility-their proper·
ty of being excited to contrac.t-depet!ds. The other pur-
pose is to communicate to them whatever it is that is the im·
mediate cause of their contractions.
Many attempts have been made to explain the phenomena
ofmuscular contractions, th~t is, to point out the changes or
events which precede it, and the order in which these events
occur ; but it is not necessary to the accomplishment ofany
ofmy present designs, to lay these attcm('tsbefore the read•
er. J shall advance my own notions m the next chapter.
One remarkable circumstance respecting muscular con-
traction is, that after a stimulus has bceu applied forsome time,
the contraction ceases, although the stimulus continues to be
applied. 'This is observed in all ~xperiments'upon muscles,
with either mechanical or chemical agt:nts ; it likewise takes
place in all natural operations ofthe system, and is to be ob·
ficrved in a remarkable degree in the voluntary muscle11. In
perfo~ing any voluntary act whit·h we strongly desire to
perform, we find ourselves unable to persevere in the action
beyond a ~ertain length of time, ever. if our lives depended
on such perseverance. But merely by resting for a certain
time, "·e may be again able to commence the action, espe•
cially ifthe system be well nourished. Respecting this cir-
cumstance, I know of no facts that l>rove conclusively
whether the muscles Jose their power to contract by their
continut!d exercise, or whether the failure is owing to a lack
of that which causes them to contract; or we will say, a lack ·
of stimulus, be the nature of this stimulus what it may.
Respecting lhe relaxation of muscles, it is generall1 con·
sidered as merely a passive effect, and I believe this opinion
is correct so far as it respects the voluntary muscles, but not
f411 -
Digitized by GoogIe
96
ao a& it respects the hollow or involuntary. And when one
considers all the circumstances which relate to these two clas-
ses of muscles, it does appear to me that be can find no diffi.·
eulty in admitting that what we call the relaxation of one set,
is different in its nature from what we call the relaxation of
the other set.
In the case of the voluntary m!Jsc)es, their constituent par-
ticles ha,·e, at all times, 'tendericy to approach each other
more closely than they do iu their ordinary state ofbeing, aa
is proved by what takes place JVhen we divide a muscle which
is not liberated from its attachments ; but owing to circum·
stances, this tendency of its particles must be inr.reased be-
fore they can approach each other more closely. Now what
are the;;e circumstances ? Why, the muscles are attached to
the bones at both ends, which bones cannot be moved with-
out some force ; but more than this, the voluntary muscles
have their antagonist muscles, which, as we may say, are con-
tinually pulling the contrary way. But when the cerebral stim-
ulus shoots along down into a certain set of muscles, it gives
their particles 110 strong a tendency to approach each other1
that they do so, notwithstanding the powers which they must
overcome in doing so ; but as soon as the cerebral stimulus
ceases to operate, these powers (the antagonist muscles, the
weight of some paris and the elasticity of others,) bring the
contracted musrles batk again to their former state of relax-
.ation; hence this relaxation is a passive elfect. It is not
brought about by the inherent powers of the muscles which
relax, but by other powers.
But mark the circumstances of the hoJiow musdes, for in-
stance the heart. The situation ofthis hollow muscle is such
that the constituent particles ofits t::ontractile 6ores may at-all
ymes approar.h each other as closely as they are disposed to.
Tbe fibres of this organ are not generally on the stretch ;-
••• ..;;1 - --
97
take the heart out of the body and empty out all the fluids
which it may contain, and its fibres will not shorten ; in oth-
er words, the beart will not approach the state which it is in
when comracted, as the solid muscles will when liberated
from their attachments. Cut a gash in the heart, and the cut
surfaces will not recede like the Gut extremities of solid mus·
cles.
From these and other facts which might be adduced, it is
evident that the heart is so organized that it bas a tendency
to remain in that state, which is called the dilated or relaxed
state. Its constituent particles do not want, ifI ma}· so ~ay,
to be any nearer each otht:r than they are when the heart is
dilated ; on the contrary, th~y are disposed to be as distant
from each other as ~hey are when the hea.-t i~ in this state :~
this is their natural state of coaptation. Nevertheless, sue~
is the relation between the fibres of tiJe heart and the blood,
that when the blood comes into the heart, it causes the con·
stituent particles ofthe heart's contractile fibres to approach
each other more closely ; or in other words, canses the heart
to contract. This contraction forces the 61ood out of the
heart, that is, removes the agent which caused the r.ontrac·
tion. This being done, the constituent particles ofthe heart
recede to their former wonted relations, as they have a strong
tendency to do. Hence we see that what is c'alled the rela.~­
ation or diastole of the heart, is not a passive event ; it is
done by the beart't: own powers, and it would require a force
to prevent it, instead of il<~ being caused by the ~peration of
a distinct agent. And instead of saying the blood pours io~o
the heart and dilates it, we ought to say the he.art dilates ai1d
sucks in the blood. But, as we have shown, it is altogether
different with the voluntarv muscle!l-the muscles which
• " • j .
have antagonists; the particles of these mu~cles cannot enj<!Y
the privilege of being in as close contact as they are dispos~d
13 .
03
to be, except they be enabled, by times, by the cerebral stim• ·
ulua; but as soon as this fugitive cause cea!!ea to operate,
they are drawn asunder even further than they are disposed to
lte, and the muscle is said to be relaxed.
This, then, is the conclusion :-The heart in a living state
is disposed to be dilated, and the blot>d most act upon it to
bring it out of this state ; bot when the blood is removed, the
heart resumes its dilated state with some considerable force,
and of its own inherent tendency ; as would a caoutchouc
ltag or bottle, after being compressed in on all sides. Yet I
do not thiuk it strictly proper to say the heart is elastic or pos-
sesses elasticity on account of its dilating itselfafter suffering
contraction : I think it would not be proper, because we ap-
ply the word elastic to those bodi~s, the particles of which
have a manifest tendency to resume their former relations af-
ter being displaced by mec.'aanica/ force ; and every body
who knows what mechanical force is, and what the heart is,
knows that the heart is not caused to contract by such force.
If I must say the heart posseBBes a properl!J, b~cause, after
contracting it dilates as it does, (and 1 have just as good rea-
eon to say so, as 1 have to say vinegar possesses the property
of acidity,) I would rdther name this property exlm.,ibilil!J
than elasticity. And we should say that the distinction be-
tween extensibility ana elasticity is very obvious-extensibil-
ity being invariably confined to the contractile organs, and
manifesting itself after the operation of a stimulus ; whereas
elasticity invariably manifests itself after the operation of a
mechanicalforce. Stop,-this moment it occurs to me that
there is an objection to this ut~e of the word exltnsib&lii!J :-it
has been used to denote the ability ofbeing extended, where·
as 1have used et to denote the faculty of ao orgao to eltend
it!elf.-What ifwe should use the words actiue and pauiTJe to

an orpn bas·the faculty ofextending itself, it possesses active
extensibility ; but when it barely admits of being extended
by a distinct agent, it possesses passive extensibility ?
In support of the above speculations, it may be remarked,
that by grasping the heart of a bullock which is so detached
that it cannot be c.aused to dilate by the rushing in of the
blood, a mao cannot prevent its dilatation, as I remember to
have read somewhere in Bichat's System of General Anato-
my. And fuTthermore, we cannot give a sati11fac~ory explan·
ation ef the circulation ofthe venous blood, but by supposing
the heart to dilate by VIrtue of its .>wn organization, and to
lUCk it up. But this is DOl the place 10 sreak of the proper-
ties and functions--
Of the ln-oolwdary Muscles. 'fhese muscles, like the vol-
untary, are far from being entirely composed of the contrac-
tile texture ; but we shall not notice particularly the less im·
portant textures of which they are in part constituted.
They constitute.a system of organs which agree with each
other in being hollow, iu bf'ing excited to contract by their
contents, and (with the exception of a few, more immediate·
ly concerned in generation,) in being wholly subservient to
the growth and well being of the individual of which they are
a part.
This system comprises the alimentary canal. (with the ex·
ception ofitsextremities, the muscles ofwhicb receive nerves
. from the animal system, and of course are under the control
of the will,) the heart, and the infinite number ofcontractile
vessels concerned in the circulation ofthe blood, in nutrition,
secretion, exhalation, and perhaps absorption ; it includes
also the uterus, the bladder, in. abort, every vessel, whether
tubulated or spheroidal, wbicb is excited to contract by ita
..
contents. .,
Of these organa we must take more partie11lar notice, that

'We mny know more orthe anima) system, and be better pre·
pared for explaining many of its interesting phenomena.
Besides the two extrematies above mentioned, the alimen-
tary canal con!li&~ of an <:esophagus, a stomach, and an intes·
tine ; which la.f:ftJbout six times the length of the system,
[ht>ad, body,.anil·
lbwer limbs;] and having particulaa· names
applied to particular parts of it, we oftt>n speak of intestines
as tbougb there were more than one in the s:~me animal.
The <:esophagus extends from the mouth to the stomatb ;
it is that part wh~ch is vulgarly called the meat-pipe. When
it is empty, its sides collapse, so as to be in contact, or nearly
so ; but like the stomach and intestines, it possesses no small
degree of passive extensibility ; it bas, like the intestines, two
sets of muscular fibres, circular and longitudinal ; the food
passing from the mouth to the stomach excites such an ac.tion
ofthese fibres as assists in propell.ng it along ;-it is not car-
ried along solely by its owu weight : if the resophagu~ pos-
sessed no propelling power, a few mouthfuls swallowed by a
man lying horizoptally, or with his head lowest, would r>ot
reach his stomach.
As soon as the resophagus passes out of the thorax into the
abdomen, it enda, that is to say, the ahmentary canal sudden-
ly widens out at this place, and presently contracts again so
as to form a sac with two openings. This sac is what anato-
mists call stomach, and is quite a different organ, and lies in a
somewhat lower region than what many people appear to
thiok when they Jay their hands upon the anterior part of
the thorax, and speak of a weakuess of the lltomach, of pain
in the stomach, &c.
The superior orifice of the stomach, or that which leads
to t~e <:esophagus, i@ called tlae cardiac orafice ; the inferiorJ
Jeading to the intestines, is called pylorus or pyloric orifice.
Each of these orifices is surrounded with a considerable
Digitized bvGoogle
...C4P--~~-----------------------------
101
quantity of muscular or ~ontractile fibres, in such :\ manner
as to form sphincters, which may close their orifices com-
•
pJetely. It is hy means of its sphincter that the pylorus is
closed so as to retain the fo('d in the stomach uutil it has un-
dergone due c.hanges. We shall pre ently notice an inter-
esting fact relative to the action of the pJiorus.
When the stomach is empty it is collapsed ; when fuJI, it
approaches the conical form, though considerably curved.
That extremity towards the cardiac orifice •~ the largest, and
)if's towards the left side ; the lesser or pyloric extremity is a
little to the right of the centre of tht: body; a~ the stomach
Jies obliquely across the body, inclining a little downwards
from left to right, the pyloric extremity is somewhat lower
than the cardiac extremity.
The stomach is capable of being extended by our foods
and drinks so as to contain from two to 11ix pmts, and in some
rare ca@es, much more: instances of Limosis Experns or in-
satiable craving for food, are given, in which a boy only
twelve years of age has taken in six successive days 384
pounds avoirdupois offoods and drinks ;-in which a lady has
devoured fourteen hundred herrings at a meal,• &c. &c.
Jt is probable that in such cases as thette, some of the food
begins to pass out of the stomach into the intestines before the
person has done his baiting ; but in common cases the food
is tctained in the stomach an hour or two before the pylorus
suffers it to pass into the bowels. _
The stomach, as well as the intestines, consish of three la-
min;e or membraneous coats besides its muscular. One of
these coats performs such important offices, that we must
take notice of it. Jt is the internal coat, and is called the
mucou11 or villous coat ; it is continuous with the internal or
*See Guod'• "Study of .Medicine," vol. 17 p." 73.

1011
mucous coat of the Q!sopbagus and intestines, and like them
possesses an apparatus for secreting a bland viscid ftuid called
, mucus ; but it is df'a different structure from the mucous coat
of the~e organs, and possesses au apparatus for secreting a
fluid of great solvent powers, calledgastric fluid. This tluid,
though destitute of any remarkable sensible qualities, has the
power of producing great changes on the materiala taken into
the stomach. It has frequently been known to dissolve the
coats of the stomach itself, in cases where healthy petsons
have been suddenly killed, as by arctdent, whose stomachs
contained a portion of this ftuid in a high state ofperfection,
without any materials in the stomach for it to work upon. It
is very generally admitted among medical men, that the pre·
tence of this duid in the stomach without material!! for it to
mix with, is the cause of the sensation of hunger. Hunger
may be relieYed by taking this ftuid from the stomach by
means of an elastic tube introduced down the <esophagus.
In cases of inordinate appetite for food, tiJis ftuid may be
more abundant, or of a more active nature than in health, or
what io many cases appears more probable, the mucus of the
stomach which is calculated to defend its surface from the _ac·
tion of the gastric ftuid, may be deficient.
Whatever affects the secretion of this ftuid, so as to impair
its quality or dimiuiah its quantity, injures the appetite; hence
we shall be able to show, in the course of this work, how
~ertain passions take off the appetite, or interrupt the proper
digestion of a meal of victuals already down.-lt will be re·
membered that t:1e stomach receives some of its nerves more
directly from the brain than any other abdominal organ.
Like all organs which perform important functions, and
especially all organs which secrete a fluid, the stomach re·
ceives a large proportion of blood.
'fbe fu"'ctioo of the stomach is to convert the food into
Digitized by Coogle
i03
'thytnt, and to propel it into the intestines. The ehyme ie
generally described as being a homogeneous, pultaceous,grey-
ish substance ; but its properties depend much on the kind
ofaliment, and on the condition of the stomach as being
healthy or unhealthy.
The stomach converts the food into chyme by means ofits
gastric fluid, and it propels the chyme into the bowels by
means of its muscular coat ; the action of this coat also as·
aists the gastric juice in coming in contact with the materials
in the stomach, by moving the chyme onward, out ofits way,
towards the pyloric ortfite, as fast as it i& formed.
If any indigeatible substance, as a piece of metal,present
itself at the pyloric _
orifice for a pa!<~age into the bowels, it is
not at fint permitted to past~, for it excites a contraction of
the sphincter of this orifice-this contraction not being con·
fined to the orifice alone, but extending along towards the
cardiac extremity, tbe indigestible substance is woaked bade
again, for the intent, as it were, of undergoing still longer the
action ofthe gastric fluid. Some time after this a contraction
again comtnences at the cardiac extremity, and again works
the substance along towards the pylorus, but it ie perhapa
again thrown back as before ; but after soliciting a passage
several times, it is at length permitted to pass the pylorus, al-
though it have sutfered no es~ential change by lying 110 long
in tbe stomach. This curious fact we cannot explain, but
by referring it to the influence ofllabit. We say tbr.t in tim~
the pyloric orifice becomes so habituated to the stimulus of
the indigestible substance, that it docs not excite it to con·
tract to so great a degree as at first, and hence it is permitted
to pass. Some other phenomena occur in the animal sys·
tem, analogous to thi11.
About twelve inches of the upper extremity of th~ intes·_,_
tine-the extremity that is couuecled with tbe slomau:b at its
Digitized by GoogIe
104
pyloric orifice-is ealled duodemim. The diameter of this
portion is much larger th:•n !he diameter ofthe jejunum or the
ilmm, &he two next portion!~ in order. A duct from the liver
called the hepatic duct, aod a dutt from the gall bladder call-
ed the cystic duct, unite and form the du(·tus choledocus com•
fltunis; this common duct, and a duct from the pancreas, open
into the duodenum by one common orifice. Bile is convey·
ed into this iutestine by the common bile rluct, and a fluid
analogous to the saliva or spittle. by the pancreatic duct.
The pancreas is a long~ tapering, glandular body, ofa dull
white color. tinged with red, and e:'ltending transversely acro&s
the upper and back part of the abdomen ;-it is that part
which is commonly called the swect·bread ;-it secretes the
pancreatic fluid.
Tht: chyme having pa!~sed from the stomach into the duo-
denum. is here united with the bile and the pancreatic fluid,
and is converted, much of it, into a fluid much resembling
milk, called chyle ; what is not converted into chyle is of no
use in the animal economy, and is called excrementitious mat·
ter. This matter, together with the chyl~, is propelled by
the peristaltic mohon of the duodenum into the jejunum,
where mu(:h of the chyle is taken up by the thousands of mi-
nute vessels that-open on the inner surface ofthis intestine.
These minute ves!>els are .callcd lacteals-We .
shall speak of
. them presently. But all the cJu'le is not taken up by the lac-
teals that open on the inner surface of the jejunum, for the
peristaltic motion that commences in the duodenum, or even
in the stomach, continues· downward, through the whole ex-
tent of the .bowels, or nearly so, and by it much of the chyle
is hurried on, as it were, from the jejunum into the ileum,
where it is taken up by the other lacteals opening into this
intestine ; but the excrementitious matter is propelled into
the ~rge intestines, viz. the crecuw, the colon and the rectum.

105
The peristaltic motion of the int~tioes is eitected by a
contraction of those contractile fibres which form theit ~us­
cular coat ; and these 6br~ are excitP.d to contract by the
matter contained by the intestines ; bef)ce such ll)aUer may
be called their stimulus. In a healthy state this contraction
commences in the upper extremity ofthe in&estin~l canal, and
proceede gradually downwards. It is of such a oahJftl that
the diameter of tbe canal is very much lessene«J wherever it
exidts ; but it exists only in a small ext~nJ of the cao~l at oflfl
time; for relaxation follows close after t()ntraction. We
hue reason to suppose tbat the contraction is so greaf, in
some in,tauces, as to bring the •ides of the capal nearly or
quite in r.ontact ; (QJ" altbo~gh some of the intestines, aa t~
cofon, make such turns that ·whatever passes them mu11t be
forced perpendicularly up, against its own gravity, still quic.k..
silver is thus forced up, as is proved by its having passed froq~.

muscular by its appearance, but by its propertiea : if it may
be exdted to contrad by a stimulus, we call it musc!Jiar ~ for
it is evident that it possesses more or lese contractile fibres.
Now it is certain that the ab&ariH>nt vessels circulate tb~ir

~in the brain, notwithstanding they1tave been much sought
after. Their proper function is a disputed question ; for
experiments prove, and some pathological facts seem to show
that the veins may absorb liquid,, and if the veins can absorb,
of what use are the lymphaticl' ?
I (.onjecture it is the proper function of the lymphatics to
to eat down, as it ,were, and carry off the solad parts·of the
body. which parts arE; continually recruited by another set of
'Vessels, which may be called mttriti'Pe vessela, but which, in
fact. are exceedingly minute branche1t of the arterial system.
I know of no facts tending to show that the lymphlltics do
not perform this officE', nor ofaJ!y facts provmg that the veins
do perform it ; and we can but believe that the lymphatica
have some pcculi&r office to perform-an office wh1ch can•
not, under the present arrangement, or nature of things, be
performed by the veins.
Almost all physiologists admit that all parts orthe body are
continually undergoing changes. the old matter being remov•
ed and new deposited, so that the atoms whkh composed the
body calledG.W. in 1776, were none ofthem pre!!fml, perhaps,
in the body still called G. W. in 1790. But it may hereafter
be admitted that the brain suffers no such changes.
'fhe.lymphatics from the lower extremities, and the lacteal•
from the jejunum and ileum~ unite into on~ common duct, in
the abdomen; ·this duct passes along up from tbe abdomen,
very near the spine, to the upper part of the thorax, and opena
into the left subclavian vein, pouring into the sanguineous sys·
tem both lymph and chyle, mixed togE'Iber. . Other lymphat-
ic vessels from the superior extremities, And from those parts
of tbe head which are exterior to the brain, open into the
right and left subclavian veins.

oftbe old. After entering the· veins, both kinds of matter
soon reach the ~eart, mixed with the blood.
The heart is a hollow muscular organ, of a conical form,
enclosed in a membraneous sac, called pt-ricardium, and ia
situated pretty near the centre of the thorax. It is placed
obliquely in tbe bGdy, so that its base presents backward and
to the right, and its apex forward and to the left. Its cavity
is partitioned into four apartmeuts, two of which are called
Gtlf"icle1. and the other two, 'Dtntricles-the auricles form tbe
base of the cone and receive the blood from the veins ; the
ventricles form the body and apex, and force the blood into
the arteries.-We say that ooe auric.le and one ventricle be-
long to the right side of the heart, and .the other auricle and
ventricle to the left side. The walla of the heart, particular-
ly around the ventricles, are very thick and powerful, being
composed almoat entirely of contractile fibres which crou
each other in various directions.
Two great veins, called 'Dena ca'De, which bring blood from
every part of the body., <>pen into the right auricle, frem
above and from below ; the right auricle opens into the right
nntricle, and from the right ventricle arises the pulmonary
artery, wbic.b paues to the l11ngs. The pulmonary 'Dtim,
whit:b bring back the blood from the lungs, open into the left
auricle; this auricle opens into the left ventricle, and from
this ventricle proceeds the great artery, called the aort•,
which carries blood to every part of the body.
At the instant the right auricle contracts, the right ventricle
dilates, and not only lets in the blood, hut, as we belieYe, 8UCkl
it in from the right auricle; but there is a valve so situated
over the aperture by which the blood enters the ventricle,
that when the ventricle contracts, this valve shuts down, and
the blood, instead of pa11sing back into the auricle, is. forced

f'd with ulves at its origin, so situated that, although they suf-
fer the blood to pass info the artery, they will not pennit it
to return into the ventricle, when it again dilates, 8tld when _
the artery contracts upon it, pusl1ing it along into its branch-
es. The pulmonary artery divides and !>ohdivides into innu-
merabl~ minute branches, which ramify in the delicate mem-
bratles which form the air cells of the lungs.-Concerniug
these air cella, .,e mud iuy a few words in this place.
What are called the lun:;s, are two bodies of minute cc1ls,
if we may so say,-one body is called the right lung, the other
the left ; in shape they !omewbat reaemble the hoofs of an
Ol : the heart is situated-between them, but they are united
above the heart. These minute cells are formed by very
thin membranes, and they communicate with each other in
1uch a manner that the air coming down the trachea or wind-
·pipe during in~pir.ttion, may find Jts way into every one of
them. Tbc::se are the air cells. They are far from being
·entirely emptied by expiration ; but the air generally remain-
·ing in the lungs is estimated at about 2000 cubic inches, and
'the quantity drawn in and forced out by each inspiration and
·expiration, is estimated at about 300 cubic inches. The air
in the cells keeps them expanded, or in other words, keeps
;their parietes stretched out in such a manner that the vessels
of these parietes. which arc very numerous, citv:ulatc their
ftuids with much more facility than they otherwise would.-
Often the venous blood becomes so collected about the right
aide of the ht!art as to give rise to a slight sensation, which
·inay be reli~ved by deep in11pirations or by yawning ; for in
this way much air is inhaled-the air cells are expanded,
and the'circulation orthe blood through the lungs facilitated.
But this is far from being the important use of the air in the
'lungs. .

ellemically united ; there is also mixed with it considerable
~vapour, and a small proportion of carbonic acid gas;
tire proportion of this acid i~ variable, but generany one hun-
~ parts of air contain one of the acid.
~The oxygen is e.o e~sential to the e~istence of animals, that
they die when deprived of it but for a few minutes. Conse·
quently, by being breathed, the air 11ulfers a change, not only
in its chemical composition, but in the materials which are
mixed with it : instead of consisting of 21 parts of oxygen,
79 ofnitrogen, one of carbonic acid, and some aqueous va-
pour, die expired air contains 18 or 19 parts of oxyg~n, 3 or
4 of carbonic acid, and a great quantity of vapour, called pul-
monary transpiration-the proportion of nitrogen remaining
nearly the same. In some instances of hard drinkers, this
pulmonary transpiration becomes· so loaded with alcoholic
JD&tter that it is inflammable ; in suc.h cases the individual
had better be careful about breathing into a candle, unless be
wishes to have his thorax blown to pieces.
Now tbe•«mous blood which is found not only in the veins,
ltut in the fight auricle and ventriCle of the heart, and iii the
pulmonary artery, is of a brown red colour, but when it passes
1hrougb tbe minute branches of the pulmonary artery which
~fy in tbe thin membranes which form the air cells, it suf-
-- a::
G:Jt.-g~t llbanges-it assume~ :1 brighl scarlet colour; its
odour becomes more sensiule, its taste more tlistinct'; its
temperature rises about one degree; a part of its· serum or
more aqueous portion passes off, constituting a part of the
pulmonary t~nspiration, and its tendency to coagulate aug·
meots. The venous blood having suffered these changes, be-
tomes artetial blood. That these changes are produced by
the operation of the oxygen of the air, is mauifest, from
the fact, that if there be any other gas in the lungs, or if
the air be not suitably renewed, these changes do not take

place. Blood exposed to air or to the action of pure oxygen
gas, out of the body·, suffers a like (.hange of colour. Indeed,
if you put venous blood into a moist bladder, and plunge it in·
to oxygen gas, it becomes scarlet all over its surface. Hence
we need not wonder th:at the very delicate vascular walls
which, in the lung!l, separate the blood from the air, are oo
obstacle to the changes of the blood which the air.produces.
But it may be inquired how the oxygen produces t.hese chan·
ges in the venous blood. Chemists are not agreed upon this
point. Sotne think that it combines directly with the blood;
others that it removes from the blood a certain qur.ntity of
earbon; and there are others again, who are iRcliued to be-
lieve that both these effects take place.
When the ncrv.>us blood is changed into arterial, in the
lungs, it does not immediately pass into arteries, but into mi-
nute venous branches, which collect into four trunks, called
pulmonary 'Ceins. 1'he~e four \'eius convey the blood to the
left auricle of the heart ; when the left ventricle dtlates, it re-
ceives the blood from the auricle ; but the aperture by which
it receives it is furnished with a valve, so that when the ven-
tricle contracts, the biood is not forced back into the auricle,
but into the aot ta, which is the great artery that, by its innu-
merable branche!l, con\'eys blood to every part of the body.
This great artery, togcth~ with its brauchc!!, forms what is
commonly called the arterial system. for the objects accom·
pli!lhed by this system of vessels arc altogether different from
the object accomplished by the pulmonary artery. Tbis lar.t
does not carry anything to the lungs for their g~owth or main·
tenancc; its office is to carry,the blood to the lungs that it
m·•J undergo the changes above mentioned. Tile $Ubs:ance
of the lungs receives its ·proper arteries from the common
aortic arterial system, by which it i~ nourished, as does every
•tber part of the body.

•.· .
When the branches of the aorta becnme as small as hairs,
and evea s«>me of them so mucb smaller as to be invisible to
tbe oaked eye, they are called capillary 11essels. Such mi•
.Ute branches of veins may also be called capillary vessels.
Hence, 1.1ot to say a word ·about the lymphatice and lacteals,
we have too grand divisions of capillary veasels-those ofthe
arterial and those of tbe venous system.
As the aorta divides into brand1es, its capacity increases,
that ia, the calibres of all the branches into which any branch
or trunk may divide, taken together, exceed the calibre o£
auch branch or trunk. The.same holds trut' with retopect to
tbe veins. Hence we m~y coti•pare the sanguineous system
to a cone! the apex of whi~b is the heart, and the base o£
which is composed of the arterial and venous capillarit'!l, or,
indeed, if we reckon (as we ought) the pulmonary artery and
Teins as constituting a part of the sanguircous sy~tem, we
may compare it to two cones, the apexes of wbic:b meP.t at
the heart.
It is to be remembered~ too, that the smaller the branches,
the greater the proportion of contractile or muscular fibres
which enter into their structure; this is so much the case,
that we may suppose that the amount of muscular fibres pos·
sessed by tbe arterial and venous capillaric!l, equals, perhaps
far exceeds, the quantity of muscular fibres possessed by the
heart, and consequently that the muscular power of the capil·
laries, collectively, equals or exGeids that of the heart.
'l'bis supposition, not destitute of !!upport derived from ex•
amining the vessels, as John Hunter has showo, will assist us
in explaiuing ~everal phenomena, manifested in many diseas~
es and during the existence of the passions, as we shall see in
the course of this wot k.
It is admitted on all hands that the arterial capillaries ter-
l'llinate in diff~reut ways-:;ome of lhem tt:l'miuate in the ca·
Digitized by GoogIe
112
pillaryveins; t~ome on the surfaces ofmembranes, aa the akin,
the inner or mucous membrane of the alimentary canal and
urinary passages ; and on 1be surface of the several serous
membranes ; some terminate in the secretory glands, as the
salivary ~lands, the liver, kiJnies, panc.reas, &c. ; others,
again, we moat suppose to terminate in the parts in which
they deposit the materials of which tbe parts are formed, and
by w~icb they are kept in repair.
As to our being able to determine, by inspection, where the
arterial capillarieiJ terminate, and where the venal capillariea
commence, we cannot ; but we may say that so long aa tbe
~uids continue to move from the heart, they are in the arte-
ries ; but when they make such turns as to approach the heart,
they are in the veins.·
All the ar!~rial capillaries that do not ferminate in veins,
may be called ~ecreting vessel•, because they all sort out, as
it were, certain materials from the blood. What are com-
monly called nutritive vessels, secrete from the blood the ma-
terials of which o·ur organs are formed.. Other vessels se·
crete materials from the blood which are no longer of. any
u&e,in the animal economy ; such are the materials of the
urine and perspirable matter ; others again secrete fluids
which serl"e important' purposes in the animal economy,-the
bile, the gastric fluid, and many others that might be men-
tioned, are of this description.- It is true, we talk about the
glands l'lecreting; we say the liver sP.cretes bile, the k1dniea
urine, the salivary glands saliva or spittle, &c. &c. This way
of speakin,;; is sufficiently correct for all common purposes;
but the physiologist tells you that certain capillary vessels
belonging to these gland~, arc the immcdia~e organs ol secre-
tion. We do not suppose any of the venal capillaries secrete.
However, many veius from the bowels unite io one truuk
whicb enters the liver and there branches oul again, and we
,c;,· • • .. DigitizedbyJF,OgAJe ._ , •

113
have some reason to suppose that these branches secrtte some
part of the bile ; but admitting that they do so, these branch·
es in the liver have more of the appearance of arteries than
of veins, and we would eooncr call them arteries than admit
that veins secrete.
As some capillaries secrete one kind of fluid, and some
another, and as they all secrete their ·fluids from one common
fountain, the blood,-the phenomena ofsecretion have given
rise to much speculation. It has not only been a question
how any one set of vessels secrete any one particular kind of
duid, but wherein different sets of vessels differ, so as to be
able to secrete different kinds of fluids. I shall not notice
all these speculations, but proceed to offer what I consider
the most rational hypothesis concerning secretion.
I might advance this hypothc!!is to better advantage after
treating of the relation between the nervous and muscular
systems ; for I must here take certain positions as granted
which rshall labor to support in treating of this relation :-
nevertheless, rahall offer the hypothesis in this place.
I hold that all secreting vessels may be excited to contract
by their contents, and of course possess the property of con·
· tractility. and may be called contractile or muscular organs.
But in order that they rnay be contractile, they must receive
something, by way oftheir nen·es, from the nervous systt>m ;
.which something is an invisible fluid, whether you call it
such, or "hether you call it ''nervous energy" or" nervous
intluence." I hold, too, that't!ifferent veesels are differently
·tempered-that they receive different proportions of nervous
energy ; and partly or wholly on this account their contrac-
tility i& different, that is, the same material~:~ will not ~xeite
the same degree ofcontraction in all of them.
Again-different materials will not eJ'cite the same degree
or action in the same vessels ; hence we know tbllt different
15

JJ4
materials, or, if you please, different stimuli, possess different
stimulating qualities, llfld for convenience sake, we ehall call
the ~timulating quality of a ~timulus, its stimability.-Bc it
remembered, then, that the stimulus of any hol\ow mu~cular
organ is the matter which such organ contains, but stimabilily
iii a property of such matter or stimulus."'
'\Ve have seen that the contents of the alimentar.v canal ex-
cite in it a sort ofcontraction by which they are moved along;
we have seen that some indigestible substances in the stom·
ach ~~cite such a contraction of the pylorus as prevents their
pas11ing this orifice, and \ore might have added, that some !iUb·
stances exci'te such a contraction of the intestipes as to pre-
vent their pa~sage. giving rise to a species ofcolic which may
be called constrictivt:, or spasmodic colic. Now we suppose
that something analogous takes plar.e in tho~e little hollow
mu!cular organs called the capillaries-we suppose that, in
order that these vessels may circulate any materials, there
must be a certain due relatio'l ~Jetween the contractility of
the vessels and the stirnability of such materials.
If the etimability be too high for the contractility, or, what
is the ~;amP- thing. if the contractility be too low for the slim-
ability, a ~;ort of constrictive spasm will be excited in the
vessels, which will prevent the materials from passing ; and

such material, in order to gP.t along, must take some other
route-some other vascular branch--which is so tem]Jtred as
to receive tt and be duly excited by it. If it have already
passed by such other vessel, it may be worked back by the
ve;;scl in which it is, to the branching off of such vessel, as
the atomach works back indiges.tible substances from the py-
lorm; ; or it may, after much teasi11g, g:tiu admittance along
the vessel in which it is, the vessel becoming habituated to it,
as the pylorus becomes habituated to the stimulus of indiges-
tible sub3tauces in the stomach ; or it may be removed by
absorbents ; ur, lastly, it may prove a more permauent ob-
struction, gi:viug rise to disease. On the other h:md-
1( the strmability be too low for the contractility, or what
is the same thing, if the contractility be too high for the stim-
ability. a propelling action will not be excited.-What then
becomes of the material? Why, it may be absorbed by some
minute absorbent, penetrating the walls of the vessd ; or it
may be pushed on by the vis a tergo of the heart and arteries
until it come to the op.ening of some branch capable of re-
cci\·ing it, and of being duly excited by it; or, thirdly, it may
be pushed through the whole length of the secretory vessel,
and constitute a bland, aqueous part of the secretion, which
willeoon be removed bJ neighboring absorbent!! ; or, fourth-
ly, it may dog up the vessel, giving rise to another kind ofob-
struction. •
Of these four may·hes! I think the third the most plausi-
ble: we say the vis a tergo ofthe heart and arteries may push
along materials in remote vessel.;, whit:h materials are not
capable of exciting a propelling action of the vessej::~ ;-this
may be granted ; hut if there were no s•1ch vis a tergfl, these
materials might, perhaps, be worked along, mixed with other
materials capable of exciting an action of the vessels ; hence,
a.s some mild materials may, in one way and a&aotber, get

116
worked along through vessels not calculated to .circulate
them, and thu~ constitute a part of a secreted fluid, I am in-
clined to think that the sole use of those absorbents which
open into cavities that contain secreted Buide, is to remove
those parts of the fluid that are secreted, as we may say, by
accident. '
We would not maintain that each secreting capillary of
any organ secrete~ some of all the kinds of materi~ls that en·
ter into the secreted fluid of su<'h organ ; that is, we would
not maintain that each secreting capillary ofthe li\·er, for in-
stance, ~ecretes a portion of perfect bile, but that one vessel ,
secretes one constituent principle of bile, another another
principle, and so on, and that the~e dt1ferent principl~s com-
ing together, unite accordiug to their chemical affinities, and
form the bile.
If we say that each VPs~el pours out a portion of perfect
bile, we must admit such bile is formed before it is poured
out, and it would hi' more difficult to offer any plaus1ble con-
jecture how it is fo~med in individual vessels, than to ad-
admit that different vessels S£ crete different pri.nciples, which,
coming together in little cavities, unite according to their
'bemical affinities.
According to the view of secretion now offered, we see
why one set of ves~P-Is' secrete one kind offluid, and another
another kind; it is ·not becau~e their calibres are different,
and the particles of matter, secreted hy different vesst-ls, are
ofdifferent sizes, so as just to fit the calibres ofthe vessels by
wh1ch they are secreted ; but it is because different sets of
vessels are endowed, as we may say, with different degree>' of
contractility, and hence are excited into doe action by differ-
ent materials. From this view of secretion we also not only
se~ the use ofthe nervf!s of the minute ve~sels, but we shall be

lhe nervous system ; how anger prnmlltes the secretion of
bile, bow fear gives rise to the ~ecrt·tion of a large quantity of
a limpid urine, &c. &c. .
lVe have now g1ven a brief, and consequently. imperfect
sketch of the anatomy and function!~ of the involuntary mus·
cular :rystem. It will be remembered, that what we call the
muscles of thi~ syt:tem are hollow, contractile organs ; that
they are not under the coutl'ol of the will-not excited to
contract by the cerebral stimulus, but that their natural stimu-
lus is their contents ; that they <io not, like the voluntary
muscles, receive their nerves directly from the nervous sys·
tem of ~nimal life, but from the nervous system of organic
life ; that they are endowed with but a very low degree of
sensibility, and that they are organs, not of relation, but of
growth and nutrition.

CHAPTER XI.
On tiLt Relation which subsists between the .llfuscular and Ner-
vous Systems.
We are now about to enter upon a !'ubject which has inter-
ested physiologists more, perhaps, than any other one, and
which is of more importance than one would at first appre-
hend. Jt is relative to a point which the learned Dr. Bos-
tock says may be stated thus:-" When a stimulant acts up-
on a muscular fibre, so as to produce contraction, docs it act
immediately upon the fibre itself, or dot!S it always act through
the intervention· of a nerve ? The nerves al'e the organs of
sensation ; when, therefore, a muscle recei\·es the impression
of a stimulant, is not this impression always, in the first m·
......
--
1I8
stance, received upon the nervous matter distributed through
the mu~dc, aatd the impression then transft!rrt:d from the
nmve to the muscular fibre ?"
To say that the stimulant or impression acts immccliatdy
upon the muscular fibre, would be the 11ame, according to for-
mt'r wrikr~, a~ to an~wcr the following question in the affir-
mative :-Is the power of the muscular SJstem ia;depcndent
of the nervous sy~tcm ? But to say that stimulants ahvaJS
act upon the muscular fibres through. the intervention ifthcir
71cr:;es, would be the same, according to these writers, as to
sny that the power ofthe muscular system is drpmdent on the
nervous ~)Aem.
From what i~ here said, we learn what those \Vho lmYe
meddled with this suhject, mc'ln hy the question,-ls the
power, i. c. the r.outractility of the muscular system, inde-
. dependent of the nervous sys(('rn ? They mean,-Does a
stimulant, when it produces contraction, always act direct/9
upon the muscular fibre, or i11dircctly, as through t}ie medium
of nerves?
Now the qul"stion which we shall put, and the negative
side of which we shall endeavor to establish, we shall put in
the same words, to wit: Is the power ofthe muscular system
independent of the ncl"vous ~ystem? Still this is notthe ques-
tion about which physiologists have wr1tten so much, for we
do not mean the same by it that they do by their11, though
asked in the ~a me words. We do not mean to ask in what
way a stimulus excites a contraction ; whether it act dirr.ctly
upon the texture which contracts, or thr~ngh the medium of
nerves, and of course imlircctly ; but we mean by our ques-
tion this :----"-Do not the muscles rccl'ive something from the nrr-
-cous sy.~tem by way of th.eir neroes, a~ they ·do from the san-
guineous systf'm byzvay uf their arteries-which somflhing is
essential i1l making end and su1!tai11ing that organizatio" o"
_,...........-- :-
119
which t.~eir ability to contrart depends? We lun·e said that we
shall endeavor to establish the negative of this question, that
is, that they Jo receive something ft·om the nen·ou8 system, or
what is the same thing, that their power is not independent
ofthe nervous system.
It appears that phJ sioJogists have been unable to settle the
tlnestion,-ls the power of the muscular system independent
of the nervous system ? because this question has been asked
and understood in a wrong sense-in such a sense that ifwe
:mswer it in the affirmativ~ or in the negative, we do not
state the truth of the matter, for as it respects one part ofthe
muscular system, (the ,-olunt~ry,) stimulants do act upon the
mu;cular fibres through tht! inter\·ention of ncr\'cs ; but as it
respects the involuntary part, they act immediately upon the
musrul:u fibres. It seems, also, that they would inquire
whether nerves arc in all cases necessary to muscular contrac-
tion ; and that th~y take it for granted, that if they be, they
act in a certain way ; but on thinking O\'er facts, some physi-
ologists conclude that they do not act in this certain way, and
or cour~e conclude that nerves are not nece5:sary to muscular
contrr,ction in all cases. I say it seems that physiologi11ts
would inquire thus ; but nothing is more obvious than that
nerve!! are always necessary in the production of voluntary
contractions. Hence some physiologists have inquired whe-
ther nen·es are necessary to contractility, which is qnite a dif·
fcreut thing from contraction : contractility is a prope1·ty,
and may exist without contraction, which is an ~ction.
But how does this question comport with what Bostock:
says is the grand question at issue ? He says (and I believe he
nates the question in the sense in which it is under~tood even
by those who query whether c.nntractilit!J is independent ~f
the nervous system,) that the question i11 this: "When a stim-
ulant acts upon a muscular fibre so as to produce c.ontraction,
Digitized bvGoogle
120
does it ad immediately 'upon the fibre itself, or doe8 it always
act through the intervention of a nerve ?" Is thi!! queo;tioning
whether contractility is independent of the nervous system?
:May not a mus•:ular fibre be contr'dctile, and may it r.ot re·
ccive Foomething from "the r•ervoua !iystem which enables it to
be so, even if a ~>timulant net immediately upon the muscular
fibre? If it may, then contractility may be dependent on the
nervous system, although a stimulu~ act immtdiately upon the
muscular fibre.
The truth is, tho~e who inquire whether contractility, and
not contraction. is independent of the nervous system, would
be understood to inquire whether a stimu1ant acts immedialtly
upon the muscular fihrc, when it excites contraction. Of
cotme,. if you prove that it does, then you prove to these
phpiologists that contractility is indl'pl'ndent of the nervous
system; but if you prove that it always acts through the in·
tervention of a nerve: then you prove to tht!se physiologists
that contractility is dependent on the nen'ous system.
Now, as we have said, our quetotion, though asked in the
same words, is altogethf'r different from this. When we ask
\\·hether contrectilily is iudPpendent of the nervous system,
we do not qtH'r}' whether a stimulant always acts im111ediately
upon the muscular fibre in exciting contraction, and nol
through the intervention of a nerve ; but we qtie~y whether
muscular fibres reeeive r;omething from the nervous sy~tem
by way of their nerves, as they do from the sanguineous sy•·
tern by way of their arteries, whtch is essential in making out
and maintainiug that organization on which their ability to
contract depends. That they d~, itt w.&iat we shall endearor
to prove.
We need not labor to show that all CO!Jiractile organs, in
sentient organized beings, are well supplied wtth nerves. But
it is doubtful whether tbe iuvoluutary muscles receive more

121
or less than the voluntary, in proportion to the quantity of
tbeir muscular fibres, and the force witb which tbey contract.
Should it be proved tbat the voluntary receive the most, in
!portion to their power and quantity of mu11cular fibres,
might suppose that this arrangement is necessary, because,
only the power o{ the voluntary mul!cles is dependent on
tSe nervons system, but their slimulus comes from this system
by way of nerves, whl'reas the stimulus ofthe involuntary or
·hollow: muscles, is their contents.
We need not labor to show that the nervous organs, the
brain, spinal cord, &c. from which tbe nerves proceed, are
secreting organs, i11 all probability, and that the nerves con·
duct offwhatever they secrete. Nor need we .labor to make
physiologists believe that all natural parts o( any magnitude
in the animal economy are ofsome use. Tllf~Y will not deny
but that the nerves going to the involuntary muscles, as the
beart and circulating vessels, the stomach and bowels, are of
some use. But as these muscles are not under the control of
the will-as they are not excited to contrdct by a stimulus
brought to theRI by their nerves, their stimulus being their
C!)ntents, ofwhat use are the nerves going to these muscles?
This is what we believe : We believe that the muscular
aystem, tbat is, the whole mu&cular system, the voluntary part
as well as the involuntary, is conl~nWJlly receiving something
frotn the nt:rvous system by way of its nerves, alS it is from
the sanguineous system by way of its arteries, which is essen-
tially oeressar)' in making out and in maintaining that organ.
izattoo on whic.h their contmctility depends. This being the
case, the use of the nerves to the lu~art, &c. is obvious.
That which the nervous glands secrete, and which the
oen·es are pretty much co·nlinually conveying to·the musc.lest
we call tbe nervotU fluid ; but shall not at present query
about its nature. ·

We d<' 'not suppoqe, however, but that when s muscie is
once organized so as to be contractile, it may remain c.ontrac-
tile for a short timt:, aftt:r its connexion wi1h tbe nervous
and sanguineous system, one or both is destroyed. There ic
nothing strange in thi8, and we marvel not at all to tcee a vol•
uutary or involuutar·y muscle confrac.t, on the application of
a stimulu~, even hours after separation from the body ; and
its doing so no more prove~ that coutractili'y is independent
of the 11ervous or sanguineous system, than a store of n.uts re-
maining after tl1e squirrel is dead, proves that it was not ac.·
cumulated by the squirrel. N:1y, nor so much so : the store
of nuts will remain indcfir11tely, after the l!quirrel is dead,
though no·spec1al pains ht taken to presen·e it ; hut cootrae.
tilify will not remain loug after the nervous or sanguinE'OUI
sy tern id destro)ed, take what paius you can to preserve it.
Nevertheless, whatever interr~rpts the regular llo\t of the
nervous or sanguint>ous fluids to the muscles, a.ffectl, but not
instar1lly de.~trays, thP.ir contractility. Hence what are com•
monly called the passions, may influence the power& and ac-
tions of the involuntary and voluntary muscles, in a way which
we shall presently point out.
I lmow that Dr. Philip, in his " Experimental Inquiry intb
the Laws of the Vital r1rnrtions," relates an experiment
which he thinks shows that IIH:' contractility whit·h a muscle
retains after beiug separated from the uervous system, is not
owing to the nervous " influence," as he calls it, which .it re-
ceived prior to the separation. Philip wished to make thi•
out, for he was writing a book to prove that contractility II
an inherent property of the' musculdr tibre, and of coune not
depend~nt on the nervous system. But it appears very clear
to us, that the experiment dtows no such thing ; inde~d, al·
tho!Jgh his principles are quite different from ours, still, be.
lievm& oUt principles correct, we should expect, a priori, the
Digitized by Coogle
128
very phenomenon which he co011iden as evidence of'the cor·
rectness ofhis principles. Such are the errors we are liable
to fall into by not thinking ofall that relates to any question
concerning wbich we judge. We shall soon advert to th11
experiment.
As we maintain that the ne"ous system secretes a duid
wbic.h dows, with the excf'plion of c~sual interruption•, con·
tinuall) to the muscles, and assists in making out that organi·
zation on which their contractility depends. it may he proper
for us to state what parts of the nervous system secrete thi1
Buid, .ldld from whatjparts of it the voluntary and involuntarJ
muscles re~eive their respective supplies.
The brain, the spinal marruw, and the ganglions, are the
parts which we suppose secrete the fiuid ; and it is from the
two former portions that the volu••tary mu.,cJes receive their
portion; but it is highly probable that some of the fluid re·
ceived by the involuntary musdP.ll i11 aecreted b}· the brain
and spinal marrow, and some ofit by the ganglion&, or" little
brains," as they are sometimes called, of the nervous aystem
of organic life.
Some physiologists are not disposed to admit that these
ganglion& aecrete any ftuid ; but they have quite as much o(
the glandular appearance as the brain or spinal marrow ;
the,y are well supplied with arterial blood, and, what is a still
more important consideration, as we descend the scale ofan·
imal beings, we find that the gangiionic system bears a great•
er and greater proportion to the animal nervou9 system ;-
indeed, in some organized beings, zoophites, perhaps, thi1
system alone is to be found, their being neither i>rain nor
epinal marrow. Even in the frog tt.ia &)'stem is oho much
more comparative impe>rtance than in man, that one maJ
live, that is, its heart ~ay continue to b.-.at, for nine hours or
snore after ita brain and tpuw marrow are ~tro)ed; but we
Digitized by GoogIe
p-es•tme the heart ora man would not continuP. to beat nine
Jninutes after his brain and spinal marrow should be destroy-
ed. These facts, together with many others that might be
adduced, not to mention the consideration that the ganglions-
must undoubtedly perform some office, have lerl me to con-
clude that they secrete a portion of nen·ous fluid. True,
some have thought that their office is to unite the nervous
1luids coming from the brain and the different parts of the spi·
nal marrow ; but such an object as this m1ght be fulfilled just
as well mercl}' by a plexus, for aught we can see ; and more
than this, the ganglions give off more nerves than cdJ!Ie to
them from the brain and spinal marrow. Indeed, we are not
sure but it would be as correct to say that the spinal marrow
and brain receive nerves from the ganglions, as to say that
the ganglions receive them from these organs.
Let us now consider, more particularly, the relation which
subsists betweon the oorvous "1etem and the 1Jolun.tar9 mus-
cl.es.
If these muscles Rre almost continually receil·ing from the
llervouR system n flow of fluid ~hich is essentially necessary
. in making out and maintaining that organization on which
their power to contract depends, as many facts seem to
show that th<>y do, then we can find no difficulty in admitting
that although their contractility may eventually be destroyed
by di\'iding their nerves, still this contractility may remain,
ror a time, after their connexion with the nervous system is
destroyed. I know of no fact, with the exception of one,
'Which has heen supposed to prove that voluntary muscles do
not receive something by way of their nerves which is essen-
tial to their contractility ; this fa('t ill the result of an experi-
ment which was made by Dr. Philip, aud which we referred
to a page or two back. ·
Immediately after having showo .that th~contractility of the

voluntary muscles may be" exhatrsted," as the common ex•.
pression is, by stimuli operating u1•on them by way of their
nerves-stimuli which are applied to the brain or ~pinal mal'"
row,-he relates to us an experiment which be l!lupposea
proves that the~ muscles do not receive any thing from the
nervous system on which their contractility depends. We
will state the experiment iQ his own words, as well as &Qme
of his remarks relating to it.
'' E~periment 32. All the nerves ~upplying one of the bin•
der limbs of a frog were divided, so that they became com-
pletely paralytic.• The skin was rE-moved from the muscles
of the leg, and salt ,;prinkled upon them. which being renew•
ed from time to time, excited contractions in them for 1711elve
minutes : at the end of which time they were found no longer
capable of being excited. The corresponding muscles of the
other limb, in which the nerve:-; were entire, and ·or whic.b
eon~equently the animal had a perfect command, were then
laid bare, and the salt tprinkled to them in the san•e manner. •
In lm minutes they ceased to contract, and the animal had
J~t the command of them. The ner\les of this limb were
now Jivided, as those of the other had been, but the excilab•l·
ity [contractility] of the muscles to which the Fait had been
applied, was gone: it~ application excited no contraction in
them. It somftimes happens ~lull w!ti/e the tunes of the limbs

Now what does Dr. Philip infer from this experiment!
Why, he infens that the contractility of the muscul'ar syatem,
so far from being dependent on the nervous tystem, or ner-
vous" influence," is exhausted by it ; because, thinks he, if
the contractility be dependent on the nervous in4uence; it
ought to hold out longest, under the application of the salt, in
those mur.c.les whose nerves were entire; instead of which it
was in those muscles soonest exhausted. But our reasonin«
is this: we say that the nervous fluid and the stimulus ofthe
will, or the cerebral stimulus, are two thinga ; that the first
flows -
more or less continually to the muscles, and assists in
making out that organization OR which their contractility de·
pends; and that the cerebral stimulus may exhaust this con-
tractility by exciting contractions. Consequently the con-
tractility of those muscles whose nerves were enti1e, was
soonest exhausted, because tbey were subjected to the opera•
tion of two stimuli at the same time-the s~imulus of the salt
and the cert'bral stimulus ; wheff'as those whose nerves were
divided, were wrought upon only by the stimulus of the salt.
That the muscles whose nerves were entire, were wrought
upon by the cerebral stimulus, we are led to believe, not only
from the consideration that an finimal would endeavor to
move it!llimb when salt is put upon its bare muscles,- but from
Dr. Philip's statement,-" It sometimes happens that while
the nerves of the limb are entire, the voluntary efforts of the
animal prevent," &c.
It is said that after a .muscle which is separated from the
body, has been excited to c_
ontrclct by a mechar.icnl or chemi·
cal stimulull, antil it can be excited to contract no longer, it
may, after being suffered to rest, be excited again by the 88•1•e
stimulus ; and this fact has been thought to favor. though not
to prove rorrer.t, the opinion that contractility is independt!nt
ef the nervous system. But a4mittiog tbat such is the faet,

it is quite'u rutlicult for the Hallerian to account for it as for
the neurologist, perhaps more so."'
Tbe oourologist mav say that the muscular fibrett have a
natural capacity for nervous ftuid, which ftuid is, in all proba·
ility, the electric fluid, or some modilil:ation of it ; and
hen~ by the operation of stimulants, they are deprived of
that portion for which they have an inherent affinity, if they
cannot be supplied by the nervous systeD'!, they will attract
it from the air or other surrounding substances, and thus be·
come again contractile. Or he may deny that the muscles
(; il to contract for want of nervous fluid, and say what the
Hallerian must ~ay, that by frequently repeated applications
of a timulu;;, the relation which the particles of the fibres have
a tendency to maintain among themselves is destroyed, and
that the.e particles require some time to arrange themselves in
their former order, so that the fibres may be again contractile.
\V ben water freezes, we suppose that its partic.le~ enter into
some new arrangement; but ifyou keep stirring the water so
a to give its particles no time to do this, it does not so readi·
Jy become icc. Nothing is more evident than ifit were pos·
sible to keep every individual particle of water changing its
relation. with other particle@, the water must remain liquid,
let it be ever so cold-its particles must have some time to
arrange themselves so as to form ice.
This last method of accounting for the fac.t, that after a
musdt·, Peparated from tbe body, is exhausted, it will, •fper·
mitteJ to re~t, become ag~in, in some small degree, coutra<.-
tile, appears to me much the most rational. Indeed, I am

inclined to maintain, that in all case• in~hich a muscle issaid
to become ~.xluzusted, it doe& not part with any one ofits prila·
ciples, oxygen, azote, nervow.fluid, or any other; but that
by ee1cise that nice organiza•ioo on which its contractihty
depends. sntfers an alteration-a sort of mechanical altera-
tion. as we may say, among its particles. And we may sup-
pose that iu the li•ing eystem tbe lymphatics aHist in restor- '
ing this :nice organization by taking. up the misplaced particleP,
while other particles arc placed where they ought to be, by
tbe nutritive capillaries.
Many facts will occur to. the pliyeiologist in fBTor of this
or" •uon. We talk about the old worn out matter ofthe sys-
tt-m; hut suppose a muscle to be well organized-to be very
cot~tract•le, how io the name of eommo~ sense.can this con-
tractil!:y be de6troyed, so long ae every indi~idual atom of
matter of which the mlll>cle is compo~ed, retains its precise
l_)lace and relation With the olhe1· aloma.. Tbe thing is im·
po~~ible.
How, too, wht'n you destroy (we wiU not say e:rhawt.) the
contractility of the muscle:. of a limb, merely by tou<'hiog the
end or a nerve th:~t goes to these muscles. witb a wir~l tay;
how do you •ll'~troy the contractility by such means ? Do you
take auy Hung from the mu.cle, or do you communicate any
th;n6 but an action to it-do you attract the nervous duid
from it! or do yon cohvey electricity to 1t ? Jonce entertain·
ed such netioos, but I found that by touching tht: nerves go-

cannot he talcen from it without givi11~ ri~e to an alteration- in

Matter is immortal! At least. matter Hver'weats out ;......
there is just as much matter now M there ever was ; and
wheft we talk about the worn-out matt~r of the system, we
mean the mispluced matter.:.__,nisplaced by exercise-by the
system's own •• w-ear a!~d tear." And the office of the ab-
sorbent. is to remove the misplaced matter of our organs.

Are they not abundant in the contractile part of a mMcle r
but .can you 6nd even any in a tendon or a bone ? Certainly,
they are not so plentiful in th~ last mentioned parts, and'
we see why their office .is not so r),uch requirl•d. Fmally',
we may v~nture to lay it dowu as a principlt-, that when the ..
contractility ofmuscles iS destroyed by exercise, it is because .
that. nice organization on which their contractility depends

od to it! 1t may be replied, that if this be done, phy~iologists
will admit the opinion as correct, for they know ofmany con-
aidE-rations which ere directly ih favor of it, as well as many
difficulties that attend the opposite opinion. Some of these
~on11iderations we will advance in thi11 place.
WhE'n tht> muscles about o"e side. of the mouth are para-
lytic, the muscles of the opposite side draw the lips towards
the sound side. This paralysis ia genf'rally, perhaps always,
cauSf!d by some misaffE>ction of that part of the nt>rvou!>. sys·
•
tem from which, or by which, the palsied muscles receive
their nervous 6uid, wlten they receive it at all. It may he
said that thi11 fact does not prove that these muscles have loet
their contractility, but only their tont. But this would be
sayiug aomething which is not proved. nor can it be proved,
but by applying mechanical or chemiCAl stimuli to the pal·
sied muscles, and finding them oontrnctile; whereas it is ve·
ry difficult for the physiologist to admit that a muscle may
lose its tone, or cohesiveness, and still be contractile. That
the musclt:s should be found contractile, even in those c.ases
ofapoplexy in which all po~er of volition is absent, \Ve won·
der not at all. In tbese c.ascs, volition is lost, not because
U1e nervous ftuid ceases to be secreted, but because the dis·
ease of the brain prevents th< cerebral stimulus (be this stim-
ulus a ftuid or an action,) from being coml'(lunicated to the
·muscles. No 'Dolurltary contraction t~an ~ke place without
the cerebral stimulus.
Nor do we doubt that in many r.ases,,even of longstanding,
of paralysis of the muscles which rec.eive nerves from the
spinal marrow.-tbey may be found contractile on the applica-
cation of stimuli : an affection of the brain or even ofnervea
may preveQt the communication of tbe cerebral stimulus,
but not the secretion and ftow of the nervous fluid. But in
tbe case of the paralysis ofthe muscles ofone side of the face;
Digitized by GoogIe
M sea-..:-- ·-
131
in which the antagonist muscles of tbe sound side keep th~
mouth constantly drawn .towards this side, we are very_
conti·
dent thAt thelie muscles would be found to possess little or no
eontr-•etility.
Another consideration is, that many affi•c.tions of the ner·
yous system, among which we may reckon some of the pas-
lions, evidently weaken or otherwjse affect the muscles them•
selves, and not the power by which they are excitt:d. In
cases of death by lightning, the muscles are found to have
lost the1r contractility. Perhaps this is to be accounted for,
by supp~sing that the ~hock of lightning so deranges the ner·
vous system as to del!troy at once the nervous eecr<'tion ;
whereas, in death from ordinary causes, the nervous seue·
tion may go on for a time, after th~ cessation of the conscieot
and motive actions ofthe nervous system. '
Again-it is admitted by those who maintain that contrac-
tility is indepeudent of the nervous system, that the nervoua
Jluid has an important part to perform in the production of
secretP.d tluids. Now can there' bt> any such thing as growth
or nutrition without st:cretion ?. Is it not strictly correct to
aay that the nutritive capillaries ucrete the materials 6f which
the muscl~s are forme~ ? and can we suppose that the ncr·
vous infiuence is essential to the ser retion of 6uids, and not
to the growth or organization of the solidi! ? Is not the·em-
bryo furnished with nervous iud11ence from the m-.ternal sys·
tein, until it have a nervous system of its o-vn ? o., not the
muscles of a youth's limb cease to grow after the nerves go·
ing to them are destroyed, or perhaps only injured by dis·
eue or accident ? In short, Jo we not have abundaut reat~Oil
to believe that the nutrition, growth, or_organization of a
musc.le, is, immediateiJ dependent on the nervous system ?
If this be l!dmitted, it would be a mere play upon words to
say that contractility is not immediately depeudenl ou the

oervoussy!ltem. Need 1 repeat that the contnH:tility of a
~nuscle is nothiog distinct from the muscle itself, allhough our
language wou!d 11eem to repre~ent that it is? Fora muscle to
be o~anized in a certain manner, or to be contractile, or to
possess contractility, are all one and the same thing. If you
Jnerely compress an organ, you atfcct its organization ; and
11othing is more true than that there nt:ver is an alteration of
property without an alteration of organization.
Jt is well known that ·whatever affects the nef\·ous system
in any great deg1ee, affects the cmdracliotl of the V?luntary
~nusc.les ; but the Hallerians asst>rt that in thel'e cases, the
affection of the nervous system does not produce this effect
by increasing or diminishing their C011lractility, but by increas-
ing, diminishing, accelerating, retarding, or in some way or
othE-r affecting the ct:rehral stimulus ; and they demand of
the neurologil'l& to prove that it is not so.
Now this is not so easily proved, directly and conclusive-
ly, in the ca!ie of the volvn1ary muscles, as in tt.at of the in-
voluutary. But if it 11hould appear, as I think it will, that
the nerves ofthe inTJoluntary mu~cles do not, at any time, con·
vey any thing to them "'hich t:rciles them, but are at all times
' convE-ying something to Cilem which .serves to reqdc.-r them
e:rciJable orcontractile; I ~ay, ifthie ehould appear to be tbe
fact, it will be a Vf'ry rational iuference that the TJoluntary
mu~des, al~o, rt'ceive something from the nervous •y11tem,
which rendel'll them contractile. lienee, I think it will ap•
pPar !Ifill more evident, before we get through this chapter,
that the contractility of the voluntary musclt•s IS d1•pt•11dent
on the nervous ~ystt•m, than it now does ; although we may
pot labor directly in 11upport of this point.
Of rht Ctrtbrnl stimulus. Cunuruing the naturE' or what
WE' have called the cereh1al ~timulu~. we hav<> thouJ,:hl not a

nature as the nervous fluid : we surro•ed that the nervou•
fluid tlowing into and uniting with the particle~ of the museu.
Jar fibre, giv~s the~e particles a dispo111tion to approach each
other more clo~ely than what the attachments of the muscles
will admit of; but that, when these particles receive au addi·
tiona) flow ofthis fluid, reser\red in the brain for' the purpose1
(which re~erved portion we denominated the cerebral stimu•
Ius,) thE'ir disposition to c1pproach each' other is· so much in·
creased that tht>y do so, notwithstanding the powers they must
overcome in so ·doing ;-this approaching together of the
p3rticles of the muscular fibres, constituting muscular con·
tmction.
Wc entertained this opinion relati~E', to the <"erebral stimu·
Ius, white writing the chapter4•n the muscular 11Yt!tem, as may •
be inferred from a few wordt~ lhtrf' dropped : but although it
a11peared to tJs m~re plau~ible th'\n any otlll'r notion tltat we
have ever t1e..:o advanced rela1ive to voluntary contrr.ction,
still we were not entirely sahsfied wllh it : it naturally g:we
ri~e to many d•fficult que,.tions. We were therefore led to
reftect more maturely upon the subj~ct, and the fdC'f th;tt
have occurred to u~, have brought us to the conclu:oion, that
the voluntary mu~cle• are not excited to contract by any ner-
vous fluid or" influence," as :~ome <'all it, brough• to them &y
their nerve~; and, cou!!equently, that the term cerebral .,tim·
ulm, is no more the name ofan agcnl than the word l!ensatiOil
or the word motion.
We suppose that when 11ny one contract!l his mnscles vol·
untarily, an actil)n, not a fluid-not 11n agmt. pro,:eeds along
the·nerves from the b1ain to th~ muscles. We w1lluow ad·
vance some of our rea~ons for SIIJlposing ~o.
First. It i11just as conceivable h.
ow a conscienl action of the
brain, that i11, a thought, should excite (lle immt'diately suc-
ceeded b)] a mati11e action of the ~raiu, aml tbll.t tbis action
Digitized by GoogIe
134
should continue elong down some nervous tract ihto the ams-
c:les, and be immediately followed by a contraction of the
muscles, a& it is bow a conscient action o( the brain, or a wil·
ling, if you please, should:throw or let off, or cause to be left
off; a portion of fluid which, keeping its right couree, goes to
the muscles, and causes them to contract.
Second. We know that by irritating the lower part of the
brain, or the.spinat ·mano'w, or the nerves going to certain
muscles, with any hard substance, as a wire or bit of glass,
we excite -contractions. We can excite as ltlnny contractions
by irritatiug the nerves that go to certain musclt:s, as we can
by irritating the spinal marrow from which the nerves·pru·
ceed. Now what ftuid do we throw upon, or cause to be
thrown upon, the mot~cles, in .these ca~oes ? Do you say that
we cam~e a ftuid contained by the brain, the llpinal marrow
and the nerves, to move along into the muscles ? I say, prove
your assertion, and show us why you cannot excite more con·
tractions in the same muscles, wlien you irritate the brain or
the spinal marrow, than JOU can merely by irritating the
nerve&-the brain and spinal marrow, witb all their supposed
tlimulus, being removed.
Third. If a man apply his ear to the end of a sound stick
of timber, tmpported from the ground, (it matters little how
large or long the st.ick may be,) while another person very
slightly scratches the other end as with a pin, the man who
applies his ear will instant!.)' hear the scratching. This he
will do, let him appty his ear to what part of the end of the
Jog he may. Now what are we to 11uppose in this case ? Can
we do otherwise than admit that a very slight degree of me·
,chaoical Coree gives rise to an action throughout the_whole
stick of timber t It either must excite an action among the
pArticles that compose the solid matter ofthe stick, causing
them, of count:, to change their relations, more or Jess, with

eaeh other ; or it must excite an adion of the air which thie
pores of the stick may be supposed to contain. Some might
at first tbink it most probable that the I'Cratching excites ao
action of the air only ; but we have sufficient reason to COl)>.
elude, notwithstanding, that the atoms of matter which com-
pose the stick itself, are put in action.
This fact shows us what an exceedingly slight degree of
mechanical force is reqnired to excite ato~ic actions through-
out solid bodies ; and it enables us to admit that a certaia
change in some part of the braiR may be followed, as an ef-
fect, by a change or action of some other part, and this again
by a change all along down a nerve into a muscle, and then
be followed by a contraction of the muscle.
Jt is maintained, and generally, perhaps universally, ad-
mitted by philMophers, that the grosser atoms of the most
dense, hard and compact bodies, do not absolutely touch
each other, but that space, or some very subtile 6u1d, as ca-
loric or electricity, intervent:s. And this opinion appears to
be countenanced by the fact, that in many bodies atomic ac•
tiona may be excited without much more mechanical force ·
bt:ing communicated to the 'body than what would seem ne-
cessary to move one of its separate particles.
It appears that what we call a body of matter, is a little
world of atoms, and that, in many in~tances, ifyou commu-
nicate force enough to one or more ofthese atoms to move
them, these atoms communicate it to others, and so on, some-
thing as bodies act upon bodies. This being the case, we
need not marvel that such slight force is necessary to excite
-atomic actions in some bodies.
Now we cannot tell by the appearances of bodies, whether
their atoms be so arranged that they will communicate ac-
tions among themseh·es or not ? nor indeed do we know but
that ao imperceptible atomic action takes place in all bodies

that it does, altllollgh we mi~ht judge from the appearances
of such bodie$, that it would not.
Who would judgf', on lookin~ upon a stick of timber, that
an atomic action may be excited throughout its whole extent,
merely hy a very t:light scratch of a common dressing pin ?
Who "·ould jud~e, on examining the optic nerves and brain,
that an atomic action may be excitt>rl in them· by a few rays
of light falling upon the retium ? Who would judge that an
inconceivably slight action of the brain may give ri~e to an
action all alon~ down the Apinal marrow? Yet such appear
to be the facts. Howcve~, in order that atomic actions may
take place in bodies, it is neces~ary thjlt the atoms be ira eer-
tain relations w.ith f'ach otl•er; •I theJ be too far apart or too
near togt>ther, tbea>e actions will not take place, at lea3t, not
exactly a!> tlwy otherwise would. If you crack a bell, it will
not sound a<~ before; di\·idc tt.e nerves going to a voluntary
muscle, and the atomic action of the upper portion will not
eontinuc on into the lower porti•>n ; hence the muscle is no
longer under the rontrol of the will. On the other hand, if
you compress a nerve so ·as to bring its atoms too near to-
gether, you interrupt tht' atomic actione of the nerve, and in
~his way de~troy volition, Neverlheles!l, if I mi~takc not,

ft must be rt'mertlherefl, that when one event immecliafrly
follows another, we cannot cxpl~in ''"'"' or tohy; for, to ex•
plain the connexion between two events, or to Pxplai~ why
one event follows another, is but to point out intervening
events, showing in what order the5e intervening events oc-
cur. But when two events occur in imJ!Iediate succession,
there are oo intervening e\·ents to be pointed out, and we cao
only say that the oile follows the other, because such is the
law of nature. Suppo11ing the moving body A strike against
the body B, and put B in motion-we cannot explain why A
!hould put B in motion by striking against it ; but if B move
on and knock down the bodJ C, and it be asked why the mo-
tion of A is followed by the falling of C, the answer, the ex-
planation, is, because A put B in motion, and B struck C.
Here we see that between the motion of A, which is one
eveot, and the motion of C, which is another event, there is
an intervening event, the motion of B, to be pointed out ; of

that the at'tion of the brain giH'II ri11e to an action ofa nerve,
and the action of the nerve ex('ite~ an action of the muscle.
This would be explaihing the phenomenon or contraction. at
well as the present state of our knowledge enables us to do;
and it is, pt;rhaps. as complete an explanation as we give to
the quMtion, why is the motion of A succeedt:d hy the fall of
C?
It iil'fn1e th.d in ca!les of mu11cular contraction, there is, at
we may say, a generation of force; but this is owing te the
contractility of the mutlcle. Were there no such gcneratioa
o{ force, we should hue no ru~;on to 11ay a muscle is con•

Fourth. Most ofthose who apparently believe that an agent
palldes from the brain to the muscles in case of voluntary
contraction, 11uppost> this agent to be the C'~mrnon electric flu·
id, or some modification of it. Now it is well known that the
.~lectric and galvanic fluids pass throogh the most compact
,bcuiiel with qutte as much f.tcdity as the more porous j but
j)uly compress a nerve a little, and the mu'lcle to which the
perve is distributed cannot bo escited by the will. This fact
{avon the opinion that it is an action, and not an agent, that
passes from the brain to the mu~cles when voluntary contrac•
tiona are excited ; for this compres11ion is much more likely
tb arrest an impercepttble atomic actio11 ofthe nervous trunk
than to arrest a fluid any thin& like the electric, And t~honld
tile esperimeut be tr1ed, we doubt not but that it wou:d be
found that tbe electric or galvanic fluid will pass a compres•
aed or divided nerve as read1ly as ooe that is not divided or
GomprC!Ised.
Fiftb. After the brain and upper part ofthe 11pinal marrow
have been removed or deetroyed, you may, by wouudmg the
muscles ofone of the hinder limbt~ of the animal. excite con-
tractions of the muscles of the other hinder limb. In thit
case it appears to us much more rea~onable to suppose that
you excite an action of the nerves of the muscles which yoq
1t'ound, and that tbis action ruut1 along np the nerves into the
1pinal marrow, and from thence down the nerves ofthe other
limb, than it does to suppose that you caulle any portion o(
fiuid to run up the nerves of one ltmb and down the nervee
of the otber. It i& no uncommon thing for a nervous actioa
to continue up some nervous tract and escite an action in, or
communicate an action to, some other nervous tract whicla
11a1 run either up or dowu. Some i.uatallcea of what pbyai·
..
140
cians ca11 ~ympathy, are to be accounted for in this way.-
When muscles are contractile, fll that seems necessary to
cause them to contract, i$ a certain action (no matter by what ,
mean:! excited.) of the nerve~ that go to them. Thoughts and
seu11ahons are as far from being essentially uece~sary to.mus·
cular contraction, as a galvanic trough.
It is well known that the electric and galvanic fluids arc the
best chemical (or pf'rhaps we may as well say mtchaniclll)
agent,; that we can use for exciting contractions of the volun·
tary muscle~. This fact i11 oue that I thou~ht of when I coo·
eluded that the cerehral11timulus is a fluid ; but it only pro\·es
that the electri<. and galvanic fluids are powerful excitan!s of
that action of the ner'e~ which is excited by certain consdcnt
actions of the brain, aud by many chemical and mechanical
agents.
Perhaps mechanical and chernical agents may excite con·
tractions by operating directly upon the muscular fibre ; .we
can only say we know that they may excite contr~ctaons by
oper11ting through the medium of nerves. ·
The reader will remember that the question, whether or no
these agents ever excite contr.teti<lll!S hy opemting directly
upon the muscular fihre, is the one a~ont which phytiiologistl
have di11puted ~o mut"h ; supposing all the while, that they
were disputing whether the contractility or power of the
mu,;r.ular sy~tem i~ independent of the nervous !I)'Stem.
Sixth. We cannot bdicve thai any invi~iblc fluid or" in-
ftl)ence" pdsses into the ,·ery teJture ofthe iuvoluntary mus·
cles, and caust>s them to contract, when they are excited, aa
\\>e say. by thPir contents.
The precedmg are !"ome ofthe considerations which lead
ua to conclude that the cerebtal st•mulu~s is not a fluid, but an
action.
Whether the nerves going to the voluntary musdes contain
141
a fluid which does not move along in them, when the!le mus"'
cles are exerted to coutract ; but which is the immediate seat
of the atomic actions a~out whi<-h we have been speaking.
Wf" would not stop to inquire, · For, if they do, such fixed
ftnid is as much a 'part of the nerve it~elf, as any other, and
the question no)more concerns us, than it does whether the.
nerves contain any sulphur, azote, oxy~en, or any other par•
ticular material. We may remark, howe~er, that there i1
nothing in favor o~ the opinion that the nen·es po11se!ls an7
such filed fluid, which is the medium hy which actions are
transmitted from the brain to the muscles.
If the certbral .timulus be n...thing other than an action of
I
the nervous system, we may be asked why we give the actioo
this name? We answer, it is for convenience: $&ke~the onl7
reason we ha\e for giving any thing a nnme. It is convenient
to have 11 name to dtstmgui~h that which is •he cau8e ofvol·
untary contractions from thuse agents or actrons which are
causes of involuntary contractions. And as the immediate
and invariable antet:edent, or cau~e ofvoltmtary contractions,
I
(we do no• say routractions ofvoluntary mmcles,) is a uervoua
action which undou'>tedly commences in the brain-perhap1
in that part of it ulled cerebrum; and as all phy~iologists
agree to call every thing a tallmulus which excites muscular
contractions, we call tbe cause of.voluntary contractions tbe
cerebrallitimulus.
lt must be remembered that we do not ttay the nervoua
system is Pensib'e because tho~e at:tious take place in it which
immediately and invariably prect>de voluntary contractions.
We suppose that two kmds of actions, t'Sl!entially ditferent
from eacb otht:r, take place in rhe nervons system-conseitnt
actions and mnli1:e attious ; and that the conscient action1
constitute our 11ensations and thou~httl, whert>as the motive
ac:tiuna, tbou'b oiten excited by the cc;~oecaent, may occur
Digilized by GoogIe
,
t4t
•ithout any consciousnes!l whatever. These ftre t~ actioos
,1rhich immediately precede voluntary contractions.
· It is true, a sensation generally alteuds voluntary contrac·
tions, but we consider this aconstqtftnce of the contraction,
·and not a neceBSary or snvariable ante~edent.- We suppoee
that the motive actions of ihe nervoul.' !'ystemgive rise to mus-
'ular contractions, and as there are senti~nt nerves in or
about the muscles. the coutr,.ctions ncite conscieot actions
in such sentient nerve!l. The mnscle~t would contract if
there were no sentient nerves distributed to them.
I would add, in tbis plare, lhaJ all the 11pinal nerves havt
a double origin, a posterior aud anterior root, and lhaat, by dj.
.teet experiment, it is proved that the muscles to which thea&
berves are sent, are rendered paralytic and insensible respect·
ively, according as the anterior or poc;terior roots are divided.
Hence it is proved that the voluntary mu8cle& receive two 1
kinds of nervous fibrils, motive and sentient. The 10otive
berves communicate actions from tbe brain to the muscles
trbicb are the immediate and invariable antec.edents ofvol-
untary contractions. The sentient are those in which Gon·
acient actions are excited by impressions upon their organi'
extremities.
We now proceed to a more partict~lar consideration of the
relation wbich subsists between the involuntary muscles and
the nervou11 syt~tem.
Our opinion is that, like the voluntRry, the involuntary mos•
clea receive a ftuid from the nervous system which is one
thing essential to tlaat organization, wbicb is but aoQtber word
for their power, or contractility.
The following are some of the principal co~siderations di·
.rectly in f11vor of this opinion.
First. T ..e involuntary mu~cles are well supplied with
aervca which must be supposed 10 have aome oillce to per-
D1g1
11zed by Google
148
tbrm in the twilinttry operations o( the animal ma~llinf! ; ana
it is pretty clear that they do not communicate a stimnln!l to
these muscles, for these muscles are not under the control
ofthe will, but are excited by their contents.
Second. It is probable that the brain. spinal marrow and
pnglions, secrete a fluid which is conducted off by the nerves,
but which is not a stimulus, ettber to the voluntary or invol•
untary muscle11.
Third. Affections of the ne"ous !lystem influence the in•
Yolontary, 88 well as voluntary muscles, as indicated by 80
a\terntion of their actions. Every body knows how the ac•
tion of the heart, for instance, is influenced by the pas•ions.
Fourth. By' destroying the connection between these mul-
eles and the ne"ous system, you destroy, though not instant-
ly, their contractility.
Fifth. Secretion is undoubtedly a function of minute mns-·
eular organs, and thar. fuu<.tion is destroyed in propCirtion at
'ou destroy the t"onnection between their organs and the
llet"Dom glandJ, or in proportion as you destroy these glands
themselves.
Sixth. It ill proved that what goes from the ne"ous t~ysteiD •
to the stomach and enables its capillary vessels to secrete the
patric 8uid, is not an action, and as we know it is not a solid
nor a liquid, it must of cour!le be a fluid.
Lastly. We know "f no factopposed to this opinion.
We know, however &hat physiologists have dil!puted wheth•
It nerves, or. nenoua indueuce, are essentially necessary to
muscular contraction, thiuking all the tame that they were
disputing w~etht-r mus,·ular cor.tractili!!J is iudt•pendent oC
the ne"ous system. _ To such ph)$iologists there are some
icts wbich appear to be opposed to the opinion that the
power of the muscular $y$tem is dependent on the nerYOUI

some, to be oppo~ed to our opinion of the rPlation betweea
the involuntary musdeE and the nervous system. But-
The fact that muscles remain in !'orne degree contractile,
for some time after separated from the nervou~ systt'm, does
not militate .against our opinion in the least, as we bave be·
fore said.•
The fact that fret~~es have been born with hearts.beating,
but without a brain or spinal marrow, weighs very little io-
dePd ngain!'t us, until two things be shown: first, that Focb
fret uses have no nervous system oforganic life; Sf'cond, that ,
the fret us, which is as much a part of the maternal system u '
any other, until separat£'d from it, does not receive a nerv0111
fluid from this sy~tem -Pretty certain it is, ndlwithiltandiJJC
all that has been said to the contrary, that somt of the markl
and deformities of fretnses are cau!'ed by affections of the
mother,& nervous system ; and this fact is no more iocxplica·
ble than the fact that children often resemble their parents,
or the fact that animals propagate their own 11pecies instead
of s,ome other species.-By the by, I wonder some ofour
profound thinkers ha,·e not denied that animals proragate
their species, for the good reason that they cannot explain
the fact!
The fact that the involuntary mu~cles are not very seosi·
ble, argucfl nothing againl't our opi11jon ; it only t~hows tbat
they posee~s hut few l'Clltient nerves. It is rather in fa1oor of
our opinion, for if they were very sens.ihle, it might, with tile
more propriety, he said that the U!!e of their nerves is to ren·
der them !leusihle.
The fact that the contractile tnture is to be fonnd in some
zoophites and !!orne ve(!ctables, in which no trdces of a ner·
'fOus system can be seen, pro\·es nothing, only " that the

!fe&t AutnUl' 01 n&~11te is the lord, and not the slave, of hia
own laws." The question is not, what may be, but what is;
the question is not whether a contractile texture may be or-
ganized without the intervention of a nervous system ; but
wbether, in animals (in which, for good and wise purposes,
the several parts are so intimately united that what affecta
one part affects another.) this texture is organized and kept
in repair without the inte"ention of the nervous system.
Dr. Philip, a writer well known to gentlemen of the medi·
cal profet~sion, has performed. many experiments on rabbits
and frogs, to determine the relation wbicb subsists between
the nervous and muscular syatems, and tbe ultimate conclu·
sion to ~hicb he arrives, is, that the power of voluntary and
involuntary muscles is independent of the nervous system ;
but that these muscles may be influenced through, or by, the
ne"ous system.
Now we know that the voluntary muscles are under the
direct induence of the nervou~J system ; it is from this system
that tbey derive their stimulus; and it is conceivable (though
not probable) that the voluntary muscles may be independ·
ent of the nervous syetem, as respecta their power, and yet be
ioluenced throu&h this system. But as to th~ involuntary
muscles, which are excited by their contents, whicb are not
onder the control ofthe will, and whicb cannot be excited to
contract by mechanical or chemica) agents applied to their
ne"ee, it is very difficult to admit that they are independent
or the ne"ous system! and yet influenced throttgh it. It ia
what no man will admit, if the facu which led Dr. Philip to
this conclusion can be rationally accounted for upon some
otber principle.
Dr. Philip himselfappears to have been aware ofthis liifti·
cotty. After relating two sets of experiments, the first o£
wbicb be thinks" proves that the power of the heart and u.s·
19
Digitized by GoogIe
146
aels ofcirculation is independent of th£' brain and spinal mu~
row ; aud the secoud, u that the ;ction of the heart ant.l ves-
sels of circulation may be influenced by agents apphed either
1:0 the brain or "pinal marrow,"-he remark!':-
" If it be said that the results of these experiments imply
a contradiction, that we cannot suppose the power of the
heart and vess.els to be wholly indeptmdent of the brain and
spinal marrow, and yet influt"nce'd by 11timuli applied to them,
the reply is, such are the facts, of the truth of which any or.e
may P-asily sati~fy himself.
"On a clo~er cxamiloation of the phenomena of the ner-
vous t~ystem, we shall find other similar 111FFICULTI£S.'';,.
We will endeavor to show how unsatil'far.tory is the coo-
clut~ion, that the iuvoluntary muscles are independent of, but
may be influenced through, the nervous system.
First. The power of these mu~cle~ being indf'pendent of
th£' nervou!l F}Stcm, and their mual, if uot their only, stimulus
bt:ing al<~o ind£'pendent of this &y~tem. we would allk, how
their actions can he influenced hy affectious of the nervous
II} stt-m ? How, for instanc~, r.an ft·ar increase the action of
the heart ? DoE's it stimulate the h£>art, extraordinarily, by
• exciting an action which thrill~ alol\g the uerves into the
heart ? Does it cause a portion of nervous fluid to he thrown
upon the heart ? It woult.l appear that Dr. Philip suppose~ a
portion ofduid, or" influence," as he calls it, is thrown up-
on th«> heart. But if thP. nerves whirh go to the heart are
capable of <::ondurtiug off the nervous tlotid, t.luring the exist·
ence of fear. what prevents the fluid from fiowin!! to the heart
at anv time? We pre~ume that Dr. Ph• lip woult.l not admit
that the nervon11 ftuid is continualiJ flowin~ to the heart, for,
according to his principles, it can. in ordinary cao;es, have
nothin~ to do afl£'r arriving there.

Second. It is admitted on all hands, that the proper stim·
uJu:~ of the heart is the blood ; now can we admit that the
heart or any other mu:~cular organ has tw• natural stimuli, so
dift'ert>nt as the blo1d and nervou~ fluid apparently arc-stim·
uti, too, which excite only one and the same kind of action ?
Third. If that action constituting fear may throw a por4
tion of nervous tl11id upon the ht>arl, wby m~y not that action
wh1ch constitutes a willi11g. do the same. Dr. Philip bas at4
tempted to show why the involuntary muscle11, are involunta-
ry ; but what he t:ays appears to us to amount to uo more
than this :-The voluntary musclc:s are in\·oluulary because
the} are involuntary.
Fourth•.-\ccording to Philit)'s conclusion, about which we
are now speaking, the grand q •estion .which weighs I!O heavily
against the opimon of the indevendcnt power of the heart,
does not appear to be satisfactorily answered. Of what use
are the nerves of the heart ? This is the que,.tion, and Dr.
Philip tinds no use for them exct'pt on extraordinary occa-
sions, except during the existence of the passions. Hia
word~ are :-'"The heart is supplied with nerves, and sub-
ject to the influence of the pa"sions, because, although inde4
pt>ndcnt of the ner¥ous system it is capable of bc:.ing inlluen4
C:(·d thronJ!h i1.""
This is the sum and substance of all he has to offer in any
place in ao~wer to the que>~tion, of what use are the nerves of ,
the heart? But is this sati11factory ? The sense of the sen·
teuce may be eJtj)re~sed as follows :
The heart is indt!pendent of the ·nervous 11ystt>m ; but i1
subject to the iuflueuce of the passions, because ll is &upphell
with nerves.

injury to the sense ofthe sentence; for ifthe heart be "sub-
ject to the influence· of the passions," it must of coul'!le be
"capable of being inftuenc~d through the nervous system."
And we may further add, that the passions arP. the only in·
atances in which the nervE's of the heart perform any func·
tion, according to Dr. Philip.
It is true that the action of the heart may be influenced
by mechanical or chemical stimuli applied to the nervous
system ; but no one will pretend that it is a function of the
nerves of the heart, to influence its action, in these cases.
On the whole, Dr. Philip tells us that the heart is influen-
ced by the passions, because it is supplied with nerves ; but
he does not show that the nerves of the heart are of any use
but to subject this orgau to the influence of the passions. As
to there being any use in this, so far as we can see. there is
Done at all :-itappears to be one of those incidental circum-
atances which, in many instances, occur under the present
order of nature, and which men call evil•.
Furthermore, it is contrary to all reason and analogy to
auppose that we have organs which perform no office in the
ordmary operations ofour•ystems-organs, too, which, when
they do perform their r.upposed functions. bring about nothing
Dew, but only accelerate or retard accustomed actions, which
are frequently accelerated or retarded b.) other means.-lt
is well known that the action of the heart is increased by ex·
ercise as well as .by the pas~ions ; but wbo would think ofas-
cribing the increased action of the heart, in this ca!e, to any
action of the nerves of the heart ? Is it Dot owing to an in·
creased ftow ()f blood towards the henrt, or to some obstruc·
tion (in the lungs) to the free circulation of the blood from
the lungs-one or both ?
Puaiug strange it must be, that the heart and muscular

may have a little bit of a palpitation, or a little bit ofa diar·
rbrea in case be chance to be frightened !
We have now offered several consrderat1oos in favor of the
opinion that the cootractility of the inwoluntary muscles is
dependent on the nervous system. We ha.ve abo endeavor•
ed to remove what might appear to some as ohjectrons to this
opinion ; and we have shown how uuatistactory is the con·
clu.sion, that the involuntary muscles are indeperuJerit of, but
may be indueoced through, tbe nervous syt~tem.
We now proceed to show i" fllhat way the action oftbe heart
aAd other involuntary muscular organs may be i11tluenct~d by
the passion• ; admitting that the contractility of Uwse organs
i! tkptncUr.t on the nervous syt~tem, and that the)· rccetve No
ITUIULUS by way of theis· nerves.
Wt! suppose that the nervous glands secrete a ftOJid which
ftuws to atl the iuvoluotary muscular organJ-not excet•ting
the minut.-.st capillary vesl'cls ; a'ud that the contractility of
these organs depends ou this nervous fluid. Hence whatever
interrupts the secretion ofthe nervou:; duid, lowers, as we may
aay, lhe contractil•ty of the~e organs. This being done, the
atimability of their contents provt.'ll too bigh for their con"
trac.tility ; they are stimulated by such contents to a higher
degree than they can bear without increased action; (we all
know that a frequent pulse is a sign ofweakneBS) ; the capil·
laries are es.cited to contract, (and tbe aum of all their capa•
(.itie• is very great); this contraction ofthe capillaries forces
tbe duide upon the heart, aud thus we have a triple cause tor
the iocreat~ed action of the hf'art ; first, an increased discrep·
ancy between its contrac.tility and the etima~ility of the
blood ; second, an increased quantity of blood {its proper
stimulus) forced upon it by the contraction of the capillaric!l,
wbicb may, with mucb propriety, be called the heart'• llUlat;•

eniPt; third, obstruction to the free circulation of the blood,
through the lungs, out of the heart's way, '"as a body ma1
say."
· But what, it is time to ask, suppres8E's the secretion of the
nervous fluid, in' the sound state of the system, and thus de-
stroys the proper balan<:e between the contractllity of the cir-
culating v.e~!'els and tht: ~timability of their contents? We an-
swer, the passions, or at least, some of the passions. Fear,
for instance, is a peculiar, intense, couscient action of the
brain, which is incom~atible, as we may eay, with the secre-
tory action of this organ, and as the several parts of the Aer-
vous ~ystem act in concurrence, fear, by supprell8ing the lle-
creto•y action of &he brain, suppresses it throu~;houl the
•hole ncrvons S.)Stem. ·Hence. in case of fr:ar, the mao is
wt·ak, his countenance is pale, tlis heart fiullers, and .often
much limpid urme is secreted.
Much limpjd urine is secreted. because the r.ontractility of
the ~ecreting capillaries of the kidnies is brought down to a
due relation with'the stimability of such urinary matter. The
counten'ance is pal.e. becau!le the contractility of many of the
CBJiiUaries of the face, which usually admit the red globules
of the blood, is so muc~h reduced, that thet:e glohules prove
too stimulating for them-they cause the vessels to contract
upon them, aud ~;hut tltt•m out.
Anger, on the other haud, is a peculiar, intcnsf, eonscient
action of the O('rvous system, whi<:h appears to iucrease the
nenou~ spcretion. ThE>re is no sen~c of weakne§s about a
man io anger ; the contractility of h.i11 capillary ve!I!ICis iF so
rail'cd tbat fT!any of them stand in due relation with the red
blood, ·which, befor~, circulated only colourlesi fluids; hence
the <.ounten:mcc is aushed in anger; ltut we pre!lurne that
the artion of the heart is never increased immtdiaulyand tli-
recll!J by this passion alone. •Yet we may tiJ,d, perhaps, that

in mo~t e:u:es of anger, the action of the heart is somewl;Jat
acc·clerated ; but we may find that in these c.a11es, the action
of the heart was quickened by some cause, previous to the
anger, or that it is increas,td by exercis~ during the anger, or,
what is still more probablt', we may find that fear, or so111e
such like passion, accompanies the anger. Men when angry
often think of taking reve~e, but they Jtar the conscqueu·
ees--they Jtar to grapple ; they turn pale and tremble ;
tben. undoubtedly, the heart Outters. ·
In order to profe that anger, olone, does, in a direct man·
ner,. acr.elerate the action of the hE-art, it must be shown that
this unmingled passion excites the heart independent of the
nercise of bim in whom the anger occurs. we all know
that a man sitting still. with a calm circulation, may have
the action of his ht>art a<!telerated by some noise, or visible
object, which may ncite sudden and intenst> fear, or fright,
as it is llometimes called ; but I am inclined to think that the
action ofthe heart is never accelerated by pure anger, under
such circumstances.
But supposing it tlhould be found that the unmingled pas·
1ion, anger, may a.::celerate the action of the heart in as di-
rect a manner as the passion· called fear ; it w«;~uld' not de·
stroy our hypothesis to its lowest foundation.-We say that
the oontractility i!l increased, dimini11htd, lowertd, &c. but we
use these term~ for the want of better. It would be II!' welt,
perhaps, not to spin out our hypothesis any fi1rther than to
say-the passions influence the actions of the circulating or-
gans, by destroying the due relation, or proper balance, be-
tween their contr.tctility and the stimahi.lity of their contents.
This view of the suhject reeonciles many diJliculties ; it
sbows us how the heart. the cou.otenance, the secretions, &c.
may b•· influenced by the passion11, although the hol111w mus•

ceive no stimt~lus by way of the nervous sy11fem. But Philip
has not ,;hown, satisfactorily, how this can be-he has oot
even shown, t!atisfactorily, why the ~nvoluutary musclt:s are
involo.mtltry. He says :~
.. We can surely be at no lo~s to account for the action of
these mu!lcles being involuntary. when we know that they are
all expo~ed to the constant or conetanlly reu-:wed action of

w~ here see that Dr. Philip gives us twd reat!ons for the

to the constant or constautly renewt•d Action of stimuli, over
"hirh the will ha!l no power." Seco:ad-·• the action of

amine his tir~t rea~on.

tract them at pleasure! for-Philip's second reason is a false
statement. It is this : "'fbe actton of these organa produces
no sensible effect."
We all know that the action of the heart doe!! produce a
" sensible effect," in the common sense of the expression ;
but it may be said, that the Doctor would attach some pecu•
liar meaning to the expression. Hence it is necessary to ex-
amine attentively what follows the exprt'ssion in the place it
is used. On doing this we find, that if the Doctor would at-
tach any peculiar meaning to the expression, " sensible ef·
fect," he would be understood to mean the same by it as by
''an end desired."
But suppose I wish my pulse to beat 130 strokes in a min·
ute, or only 30 strokes in the same length oftime, that my phy·
sician may think me a very sick man, requiring his best atten-
tion-would not thi~ be "an end desired ?" And could I ac-
complish it,1 would it not be a " sensible effect ?" as strictly
so as an} other?
" We will," says the Doctor, ' to move a limb, and not to
excite a muscle." But why this talk ?-If an anatomist
should will to contract his orbicularis om muscle, instead of
wilhng to pucker hi<t lips, could he not df! it ? But in this
case the wish would be" to excite a muscle," and not" to
move a limb."
The DGctor sayE-" If we had no wish to handle, the mus-
cles of the fingers of course would never becomt' subject to
the will." Does the Doctor mean by this as murh as to !'ay,
the make of a man depenJs upon the wishes he may chance
to ha,·e after he is made !
Finally, the Doctor's reaso~s for the heart and blood ves·
sets being involuntary, amount to this :-We can perform no
att of VOlition, lhat is, DO voluntary act, W1th the hearl Of
20

154
blood ve~seJs, becau~e, forsooth, " what act ofvolition can we
perform by the heart or blood vestielli ?"
But it may be asked, what reasons zct have to offi·r for the
involuntary mu:odes bei,tg i••voluntarJ ? Two or three very
rational, yea, verJ probable, suppositions rna) be offered.
We may suppo~e that the nerves of tl~se organs do not,
like nervu of the voluntary muscles, have that direct connex·
ion with the sensori.um (that part of the brain whi~h thinkl',l
which is necessary in order that motive actious rnay be cxci·
ted in them. hy con!'cient ac.tious of this part of the brain.
Second. Anatomists kuow that the par vagum and ull other
ner~es distributed to the hollow musclt>s, "differ fi'Om the
other nerves in the di~po~ition of their 6hreJ, which, instead
of being straight and parallel, are i~regularly connected to
each other. and twisted togdher."~ Hence it Is probable
that they are not in themst>lves capable of communicating
such actions from the brain to the muscles, ·as the nen·es of
the voluntary muscles are. We kuow that we cannot cause
the hollow mu!iclcs to contract by irritating, by mechanical
or chemical agents, the nerves which go to them. ·
Third. The organization oftlw hollow muscles is sufficient·
Jy different from that of the voluutnry, to account for their not
being excitable bJ the same means. The voluntary muscles
. are excited hy the cerebral ~timulut~; the heart is excited by
the blood; and if the cerebral stimulus ehould be communi·
cated to the hea1 t, and a contraction of the heart ahould not
· follow, JNe should lh> mor~.; wonder than we !'hould if the vol·
un~ary tnU!•cle~ rhould cor•trclct on having a few ounces of
blood poutt·d upon them.
We have now 6hown in what toay we suppo;e the pa11sioos
influence the actions of the hollow muscular organs, aud why

these organs rannot he excited by those conscient actions of
the brain which Cc>nstitufP. what we call a desire, or willing.
But something more m••st he said in df!fence of the opinion,
that the passions influence the action of the heart, &c. in the
way and manner which we have pointed out.
Perhaps; in point of weight, the first seeming objection to
this opinion that may be bronght, is the short space of time
that passes .hctween the commencement of the pa@sion and
its apparent influence on the hollo'v muscles. We have
maintained that the ncrvou5 influence enters into the organi·
zation of the muscuJ.ar libre, and is one of its t'~seutial princi~
pies, as much so, ns aRy thing brought to it by the arteries;
and that the muscular fibre being once organized so as to be
contractile, may, as we know, remain, in some degree, con-
tractile even for ·hour~ after separaled from the nervous sys-
tem. Now if the ordinary actions of the minut-e vessels and
other muscular organs. are so dependcut on a puuctiliou:~ sup-
ply of ncn·ous IJu1d, that thc~e actions are altered wht>n thia
supply is withheld for .a few moments ; some may wonder
that these organs remain at all contractile, for hours, after
cut offfrom this supply.- We will now eudeavor to remove
all doubts arising from this sc.orc.
In the first place, a man docs not turn pale, and the action
of hiil heart is not acccleratet1 the iustant the passion fear, for
instance, is exdted.-Fright is an intense fear, suddenly and
unexpectedly excitcd. Now I kuow ·(fo•· I have thought to
notice immediately the occasi9n,} that I am oftc!l frigMened,
and the fri~;bt is all over, without any iucrca~ed acti~u ofthe
htart. But it may be said that such per!On$ al! ate ~ailed.

riding, and which he has learnt by experience is apt to stum·
ble.
This we grant, but this instant sensation does not prove
that the person instantly turns pale, or that the action of his
heart is instantly accelerated ; nor doe11 it in any degree prove
that in other cases of passion, the action of the h~art, &c. is
altered by means of a conscicnt action exter.ding along cer·
ta.in nervous tracts. Consciousness (by which I mean as much
as any one does by thoughts and sensations,) ha·s nothing to
do with muscular contraction, a' its immedittJe cause or ante·
cedent,-not, indeed, in case of voluntary contraction. That
con11cient ac.tion ofthe br<lin called a willing, is not the imme-
diate antecedent ofvoluntar1 contr:~ctions; but this consci~nt
action excites a motive action of the nervous sy~tP.m, and this
is the immediate antecedent of voluntary contractions. All
this will appear more clearly in the chapter on Vulition.
But after all, it must be admitted that in many cases the ac·
tion of tbe heart is very soon altered after the commencement
of a pa~sion. And we are now about to offer some consid-
erations tending to recon.::ile this fact~ with tbe fact that mus·
cular organs often remain in .some degree contractile, even.
for hours after they cannot be suppo&ed to receive any ner-
vous fluid from the brain and spinal marrow.
The reader must remember, that in man the brain bears
a greater proportion to the rest of the ner\·ous system, than
in any other animal ; and that as we descend the scale~f ani·
mal beittgs, the brait. becomes, as we m~ty say, of less and less
consequence. In rabbits, llnd particularly in frogs, so great
a proportion of the nervous duid, which their hollow musr.Jes
receive, is secreted b~ the ganglion!' (a11 we suppose) that
these mul!cles will remain contractile much longer after the
brain and spinal marrow are destroyed, than they would in
man aftt:r Lbe destruction of tbe brain and spinal marrow.

In the case of frogs, Dr. Philip h~s shown, that after the
brain and spinal marrow are destro)ed, the capillary ves~ela
remain contractile, t>O as to circulr.te their contents, •• many
minutes ;"' and that the heart generally remains contractile
an hour or two. But in man we doubt if tile heart or capil·
lary vessels would continue to act one minute after being
treated as the frogs w•:re treated. We presume that if the
brain and spinal marrow of a man were destroyed, bis mus•
cular organs would not be found to be contractile so long af-
ter, as they are after death from straugulation, or some other
cause which may not prevent the nervous secretion from ~;o­
ing on, a little, after what we call death. In some instanccs7
fear so completely suppresses the nervous system, and keeps
it locked up, as it were, f~>r such a leugth of time, as to de-
stroy life ; in such ca!es it is found that the muscles have
l~t, or quickly lose, all contractile power. Be it remem-
bered, also, that according to our principles, the passions in·
ftuence the action of the heart chiefly through the medium of
tbe capillary vessels; and as the contractile texture of these
Tessels is exceedingly delicate, We need not wonder that a
momentary increase or momentary suspension ofthe nervous
secretion, so destroys the proper balance between the con-
tractility of these vessels and the stimabihty of their contents,
as to caust an alteration of their actions. Finally, wben \Ve
comider all the differences betwren a bull·frog and a man,
lre need not wonder that in the latter, the passions may, in a.
few seconds of time, influence the capillary vessels, and con·
aequently the heart. m the way we have supposed ; although
, afrog's beart may remain co11tractile a few hours, and his
capillary ves11els " a few minutes," after the bram and spinal
marrow are d~!itro \ cd.
I am aware tbat Dr. Philip has performed certain experi-

ments, tl1c results of which I must show to be reconcilable
with the principks I have been cndfavoring to maintain.
With mallets, knives, wires, and hot pokers, he has crush·
ed, mangled, pierced and singed the brain and spinal marrow
of rabbits nud frogs, and has also poured upon them spirits of
wine, laudanum, and infusion~ of tobacco. And what were
the general results ? Why, the more he i1~urcd the nervous
system-the more he !'la~hed it, and the more alcohol he ,_
.
poured upon it, so much the more he quickened the action of
the heart. Hence the Doctor ~upposed, that by these meall5
he stimulated the heart ; whertlas, we !luppose he derangtd
the nervous secretion-impaired the ~:ontractility ofthe heart ~
~nd blood vessels,· and caused the heart to beat more fre- r•
quently1 in much the same way that fear does. T;.e spirits of
wine did not excite the heart in the same wa) that they do
when d.runk : in this case, it may excite the nervous secre·
tion somewhat, (perhaps. howe\·cr, by exciting the c.ircula·
tion,) but it enters mto the blood and raises its stimability
more than it raises the contractility of the heart ; and in tbil
way gives rise to an increasf'll action of the heart.* When

the ('OP.tractility of a man's heart is 'reduced by disease, a
!pirituous potation acr.elerates its action more than when ita
contractilit}' is in a high state. as in healtJ••
When Philip crushed the brain with a hammer, he gave
the nervous system such a shock as completely to arrest, for
a time, the nervous secretion. This so reduced the power of
the heart and the contractility of the capillarie~, that the ca- .
pillaries couiJ not withstand the stimulatiou of their contents
-they were excited into a sort ofconstrictive ~pasm, by which
means the blood was so crouded iuto the enfeebled heart, that
it could not contract so as to free itselfof its load ; yet its
dispositior1 to contract was great, that is, the diicrepancy be-
tween its contractility and the stimabilit.v of its contentt~, was
great. But preseutly the shock of the nervous aystem passes
off-the contractility of the heart and capillaries begins to be
re11tored-the capillaries give more room for the blood-the
beart begin!! to str••ggle ; and finally, for atime, again sup-
ports the circulatiOn, though more feebly than· before the
brain was crushed. Now what does Dr. Philip conclude
from this ? He concludes that so far fr~m the power of the
heart being dt'pendent on the nervous s~·~tem. it may, of ita
own self, re,·over its power, " precisely as a muscle of volun-
tary motion will by rest recover its excilability, although all
its nerves are divided." Surely! tt.is is explaining a mystery,
merely by comparing it with a greater, which greater be no-
where attempts to explain.
Now we do not thiuk the two cases are alike. · It is aatu-
ral for a voluntary muscle to contract but a few times in im-
mediate succession; but it is natural for tht~ heart to contrnct
once a second or oftener, co11linual/y ; the heart is notfa-
t;gued, wht~n it stops afh:r the crushing of the brain; and if

pendent of the nervous 11ystem, we wi~h the Doctor Wl'uld
just show u~ why it ceases to act after crushing the brain.
Dr. Philip found th~tt he did not stop the action of the heart
by removing the brain or spinal m~rrow, as he did by cru~b·
ing these organs; but why, he does not explain.-We will at·
tempt it. You cannot remove the brain and spinal marrow '
without some loss of blood ; this prevents the heart from be·
ing 100 completely overluaded that it cannot act. True, Philip
sometimes contrived it, so as to snip offa frog's head without
much Joss of blood ; but then, he left the spinal marrow and
the ganglions which, with the nerve~, form the chief part o£
a frog'~' nervous system ; and in ~nipping offthe bead, which,
by the by, contains a pretty good share of the blood of the an·
imal, he did nor gl\·c the nervous system such a shock, as
when he crushed the brain. ·
Dr. Philip found that when he mangled the brain but little,
or poured aJcohol upon ouly a small part of it, he altE'red the
action of the heart lillie or noue. Th•s fact he does not t:t·
plain-he only refers it to a law which he is endeavoring to
establish ; but we suppose it i3 because be did not destroy
the nervou! secretion to any great degree. He found, also,
that his applicatiOil to the outer parts of the brain did not
cause any contraction of the voluntary musdes ; but that
when he. got down to the IOIVer part ofthe brain, ~here the
conscient actions go.on, he did. Why ? Because he then got
down to, and excited motive actions in, that part of the brain
in which the motive actions are excited by the '• will," as the
~pression is.
Again-Dr. Philip states that when he took out the back
part ofthe brain; and a(h!rwards poured alcohol upon lhe
anterior part; he found the aclion of the heart a!! much quick·
ened as if he had l(•ft the nervous sy!'lem entire. Why so?

derang<>d the nervous secretion as much, as if he had not ta-
ken out any part ofthe brnin. Should he tP.II me that the ac-
tion of the heart was not incr<'a~cd until he applied the alco·
bol, I should begin to.think it is pretty qui!er ifyou may catch
a frog and fall to mangling it, without exciting an increased
action of the heart,-1 should think that frogs are so unlike
men, that experiments made on them will nevergive us much
correct information concerning the economy of human be-
Jngs.
Another fact which Dr. Philip doe:1 not explain, butwhich,
so far from causing us to wonder, i!! what our principles would
lead us, a priori, to expect, is this: A transverse division of
the Bpinal marrow renders the voluntary muscles helow, par-
alytic, (in. one sense of the word,) hut does not intl4ence the
powers or ac-tions of the holl\lW muscles. Need we ~how
why this is ? Does not the reader sec that the division of the
spinal marrow P,revents the communication ~f the motive ac-
tion~ of the brain to the muscles below, but that it does not
in the least destroy the nervous secretion, either in the parts
above or below the division ?
Dr. Philip has shown that liquic1 preparations ofopium and
tobacco applied to the nervous system, cau;;~ the heart to
beat less frequently. This fact led him to make a statement
which appear~ to us quite i.-ational.
On rcviewmg the. inferences from his experiments, he savs,
(p. 234): " The nervous influence is capable of acting as a
stimulus both to the heart and vessels of circulation." And
in the lines next immediatelv following1 he says ; " The. ner-
vous influence is capable of acting as a sult1ti11e both to the
heart and vessels of circulation, even to such a degree as to
d('stroy their power." He then refers us to the experimenta
whith lead him to this conclusion, and on turning to them we
ind them to ~e the CJperimeuls in which tbe hammer, the

epium, and the tobacco, suppressed or relilrd'eu l11e action o(
the beart.-1 wonder if the Doctor supposes that hammers
and opium operate on the.same principle !-We do not sup·
pose the nervous influence, directly, either accelerates or re-
tards the action of the heart, but if it did either, it would ap-
pear irrational to suppos~ it does both.
Now although Dr. Philip bas given us no explanation of
the fact, that preparations of opium and tobacco, applied to
the nervous system, cause the heart to beat less frequently ;
still, in offering opinions oppo~ed to his, it may be thought
incumbent on us· to explain aJI thing~ ; therefore, we shall, at
least, attempt to explain this fact. But in confirmation of
what we have said about the detrimental action of alcohol on
the nervous s)'stcm, and of what we arc about to sa)' concern·
ing the modus operandi of opiUm, &c. ; we will first quote a
passage from Philip.
'' Mr. Hastings had found, that immersing the hind legs of
a frog in tincture of opium, [laudanum] in less than a minute,
deprives it of seusibility. This docs not ari~e from any ac·
tion of the opium ; a watery solution of opium, we found,
however strong, does not produce the effect. It is immedi-
ately produced by simple spirit of wine, and arises from the
action ofthe spirit on the nerves of the part to which it is ap-
plied. •It is remarkable, that if &imple spirit ofwine·is used,
the animal expresses severe pain•; if tincture of opium, very
little."
From this passage we learn that alcohol makes such rack·
ing work with the delicate nervous texture, even when not
applied immediately ro it, as to destroy its sensibility, where·
as opium does not. Knowing this, we may the more readily
admit that alcohol, applied to the nen·ons glands, may de-
range the nervous secretion, and yet, tbat liquid preparations
Digitized by GoogIe
163
of opium and tobacco may promote it, which is the position
that we shall maintain.
We suppose that opium is a real and powerful promoter,
not of muscular contractions, but of the nervous secretion,
and that when laudanum is applied to a considP.rable part of
the nervous ~ystem, and the animal gets a little over the shock
of the operation, it moderates the action of the heart as fol-
lows :-Jt increases the nervous secretion, whereby it raises ·
the contractility of the heart and circulating vessels, and this,
so far as it respects the relation between the contractility of
these organs and the stimability of their contuts, is eqniva-
lent to diminishing such stimability., This speculation being
admitted, we see in wltat way preparations of opium and to-
bacco, applied to the nervous system, moderate the action of
the heart; we sec, also, in what way opium, given to living
animals, produces a full, slow pulse. This slow pulse is not,
in fact, a sedative effect of the opium, considered in relation
to its action on the nervous system ; but it is a sedative ef-
fect, con,sidered in relation to its influence on the heart, pro-
vided \Ve insist on calling every thing a sedative which mod-
erates the action of this organ.
The real 11cdative _!!tfects of opium do not follow its being
taken into the stomach, until twelve or fourteen hours after-
then the patient begins to feel weak, faint, &c.-then it is that
the nervous system is resting from its high action. True,
opium may raise the contractility of the capillary vessels so
that many of them may admit red blood, which, before, did
not ; hence so much blood may be permitted to rush into the
brain as to produce some impediment to the recurrence and
occurrence of its conscient actions; so we see, that in this
way opium may induce,sleep; and yet it may be all the time
promoting the nervous secretion.-Surely, there is a wide
difference between the modua operandi of opium apd ham~

164
mers upon the nc.rvous srstcm; althou~h the one may m~
erate the action of the heart, and the other destroy it. •
REMARKS•..:_ It app(~ar!' to us that very many writers have en·
tertained an erroneous notiot. 1cl••tive to the actions of mU!)CU
Jar organs : it seems as thou~h they have reasoned so~1cthing
like this : A dead organ acts not at all-a living organ acts
some ; hence the more life~ the more action, and the reverse,
the more action, the more life or power. But this sort o.
mathematical reasoning will not hold in the present case, cer-
tainly not as it rc~tpects the heart. For a frequent, quick
pulse, we are to look to the sickly a11d enervated ; for a slow,
full pulse, to the hardy yeomanry. The :>hysician knows
that those causes which "appear to be calculated to injure the
nervou11 secretion, predispose to spasmodtc action'; and be
will find, on reviewing all the facts any way related to the
subject, that the foiiCiwing is a univerdal fact, or law ofthe nn-
_imal eeunomy, if you please to call it such, viz. The lower
the contractility of a muscle (until it get to a very reduced
point,) the less able is it to withstand the action of a stimulus,
or in othu word!!, the more is it excited by the same agPnt.
Nevertheless, w~ must make a distinction bet;cen a frequent,
quick. and easily uc.ited action of a muscular organ, and a
forcible action ; all'o, between the disposition of an organ
.to act, and its power to act. For instance, the slimability of
the blood remaining the same, you may increase the disposi-
tion ef the heart to act, pretty much in the eame ratio you di·
minish its power or contractility.
It is true we sometime• meet with a slow pulse in a debili-
tated subject ; but this slowness is not owing to tbe atonic
, state of the circulating organs. It is owing to the reduced
stimabilify or their contents. This stimability ia·brought so
near to a level with the contractility of the organ11, that it e~·
titea them but moderately. Give such patie-nt a glass Gf

.es, or a little stimulating food, And you will quicken hia
.~e much more than- you would by the same means were
oe weJJ.
1 -some diseases thP- contractility of the circulating organa
is so much redu,:ed, that the capillary vessels cannot, as we
may say, patiently bear the stimulation of their contents ; a
'- .·ofconstrictive spasm is excited in them ; they press the
•'upon, or r11ther into, the enfeebled heart ; the surface
Ill ,.ale, and the puhe is slow and struggling. Draw a little
hi :d and you remove some ofthe heart's load, enabling it to
act more freely; hence you naise the frequt:ncy of the pultae
to tbe healthy standard. But if yen bleed copiou~Jy, ) ou
take from the nervous system that which is necessary to main-
tain its secretion ; hence you lower the <.ontractility of the
circulating orgtnll to a greater degree than what the dic;ease
has done, a.1d the 11cart flutters, and may soon cease te .
%at. In such r.ase, nothing w11l save the patient but
the prompt administration ofsuch medicines as will pr~mote
and maintain the ncrvoussecretion ;-opium, in regularly re·
pealed doses, i:\ pe•haps the very best.
When a robu~t man is take•l down with a common intlctm•
matory fever, you will find that some cause has r-Jised the
stimability of his fluids, (spirit~; may do this, or cold may do it
by suppressing the perspiration,) or else that some cause hat
lowered the contrdetility of his circulating organs, increasing
their disposition to act. Therefore, in ~uch patient you find
afrequent and forcible pulse. Bleed him, and gi\·e him dilu-
ent drinks, and you '>ring down the stimability of the tluid to
a proper relation with the contractility of the organs which
contain them 1 and thu& you moderate the action of the heart.
But bletd him very copiously, and you take away that lvhich
i• nece~sary to Fnpport the nervous secretion, and thus you

mote the nervous secretion, and again calm the action of the
heart.
We might fill pages with pathological evidence in favor of
our opinion of the relation between the nervous and muscular
systems. But we must proceed to recapitulate the more im·
portant principles already advanced; for it is necessary that
the reader remember them, as they will enable u11 to explain
the phenomena of the passions, and many other interesting
phenomena ; by doing which we ehaJI remove much of that
mystery which. has hung over the phenomena of man;
and we shall show immaterialists, that with all their imag.nn·
ry machinery, ~hey cannot begin with the materialists in ex·
plaining the phenomena of man.-Oh for tt.e time when man·
kind will be no longer deceived by mere verbosity !
Some of the more important principles which we hal'e been
laboring to maintain, in this chapter, are the following :
1. That the contractility of the whole muscular system is 1
dependent on a nervous fluid.
2. That the immediate antecedent or cause of the contrac·
tions of the voluntary muscles, is an action of the nervous sys·
tcm, which action we, for convenience sake, call the cerebral
SJimulu1. But so much of this action as t~kes place in the
bmin, we call a motive action, in contradistinction to the con·
sdent actionll ofthe brain.
3. That the onl!J stimulus of the hollow muscles, is their
content!.
4. That the passions influence the actions ofthese organs,
by destroying the proper balance bP-tween their contractility
and the stimability of their contents.
b. That.by diminishing the contractility of a muscle, you
render it more irritable, in the good old pathological sense of
the term; but less powerful-for the peculiar pomer efa mus·
elc is nothing other than its contrac.tility.

eoneerning the nature ofthe nervous fluid, we shall say but
few words. Many arc already acquainted with the evidence
in favor of its bci ng the electric fluid, or some modification of
it ; those "'ho are not, I must refer to Philip's " Inquiry into
the Laws of the Vital Functions."
I will just otft:r two or three considerations which, with the
evidence alluded to, convince me that the. nervous fluid is
the electric fluid, or more probably, that peculiar modification
of i~ called the gah·anic. First. There are no elements in
man t~at do not exist out of the animal system. No man will
have the hardihood to deny this. Now if we had full liberty
to imagine every thing without prol·ing any thing, we could
uot imagine any agent by which we could any better explain
certain phenomena connected with muscular ac.tion, than we
now can, by supposing the electric fluid to be concerned in
the production of these phe~omena.
Suppose we adiJ}it fot· the moment, that the nervous tluid
i; something essentially different from the galvanic, and sup-
pose we give it the name of life; and if you please, we will
suppose nnother a~cnt, totally different from any thing we
have any knowledge of, and give it the name of soul,-now I
~sk the reader, if there is a single phenomenon of man which
be can any more explain, or any better explain, these things
admitted, than he can without supposing the existence of any
unknown substances. Strange it is that.men should think to
explain the known by the unknown, and strange it is, that metl
shool<l think they txplain phenomena, when they only refer
them to some brain-begotten agent.
Second. Chemists can bring many facts in favor of the
opinion that bodies have each a certain l'apacity for electri-
(ity as well as for caloric, and that when they yield any share
of their fixed electricity, they suffer some change, even in
their physical properties; hence, when substances sutf~r sucla
Digitized by GoogIe
168
changes as they do, during the processes of digestion, circula·
tion, &c. we may easily ~uppose that some ot them yield a
portion of the1r fixed elec.tricity to those <.urious galvanic
batteries, the nervous glands. .
Animal htat undoubtedly ari!leR from a change of capacity
for caloric, which material!' undP.J'go during the changes that
are continually going on in the system. It is more than pro·
bable that the electric or nervou~ fluid has an important part
to perform in the production of these c.hanges, consequ~otly
in the production of animal heat.
We arc now about to treat of the conscient phenomena of
man ; but before the rea~cr procPeds any further, we wish be
would return to, and read, the two first pages of the chapteron
Union1 and also tht: note at page 44.

CHAPTER XII.
I
On Sensation and Peretption.
!'he five senqes have sometimes been called the trltrna1
llen~es, in c.ontradistinction to the internal senses, a cla:IS of
beings (not very harmlel'~<,)' begotten hy the well organised
brain of Mr. Locke. We, however, do not speak of tbe •·
iernal sense~. but of the sensts; and mean by them, thoae«-
gaus upon which impression~; immediately operate in exciting
conscient actions of the nerveus 'ystem. As to the internal
senses, they are none of our machinery.
It must be remembered, that the nerves are the essential
parts of every sense ; no organ is an organ ofsense, or a sen·
sible organ, unle~!' it po~se•,; a sentient ncn·e.
1f we have not, we must now inforo1 th.e reader, that: by

physiologist$, the two extremities of each nerve or nervous
tract, are distinguished by the names cerebral a~d organic-
the first bt'ing connected with the brain, and the other with
the sensible organs.
Now the nerves arc of a different make at their OrJ!:anic
(and und.oubtedly at their cerebral) extremities, from what ·
they are between the brain and their organic extremities ;-
at least, we know it is so with the optic and auditory nerves ;
and not only analogy, but very many phenomena, lead us to
conclude it is so, with all other sentient nerves. Indeed, we
may add, that microscopical observers prett!nd to tell us that
the nerves of the tongue, skin, &c. terminate in minute emi~
oences, which they call nervous papilliZ.
We ha\'e somewhere said, that a sensation is a conscient
action of a nerve and the brain-the action ofthe brain being
one which ia immtdiately excited by ~he nervous action.-
'i'ilis definition is concise, and sufficiently correct for the
occasion on which we used it; but we shall now treat ofsen-
sation more fully, and, as soon as we get ready, show more
precisely what it consists in. ·
Sensations are. generally excited by impressions. By an
impression, we mean any agent acting upon any organ so as
to excite. a con~cient action of the nervous system-all parts
concerned, being in a healthy state.
An impression never reaches the brain. It does not pro-
eeed along a nerve any more th~&n a man proceeds along a
cord, when, by touchiAg some part of it, ht: causes it to vi-
brate throughout its whole length. It is the action which
the impression excites, that proceeds along the nerve ; and
if this action continue on so as to excite an action of the
brain, it cannot be said, strictly, that the brain receives the
impression, nor, indeed, that the impre!sion excites the brdin ;
for it is not the immediate antecedent of tbe cerebralac~ion,
~2
Digitized by GoogIe
170
But it is the nervous action that excites the Cf'rebral aclion.
Yet, when we do not attempt to sa•eak with precision, we
may speak of impressions exc1tiug the brain, of impressions
pasemg to the b1aiu, &c. ; but our meauiug will now he un-
derstood.
Between the brain and the nerves there is this important
difference: when a cousdent action has hcen t•xcited one or
more times in the brain, there is product·d in it such a
tendency to act after the sarot! manner again, that it may thus
act without the r('·applicatiou of the impr{·ss•oh to the senses
which first exdtt·d the action ; but iu the nencs this reac-
tion, or action without impression, scldnm takes place-it
takes place so l!eldomly, that when it does occur, it is consid-
ered a morbid action. The brain, the••, is much more iufiu-
enced by habit than the nerves.
Now the results of uperiments, and the effect!! of di~>cases
and accidents, pro\·e conrlusivd) that conscient actions of
the brain are not action~ ol the whole brain, but only of the
lower and ceutral part of it ; the precise part is not fully de-
termint>d• But that p<~rt of the brain wluch does take on this
kind of action, we call the sensori~Sm commune. This is that
part of the brain which thiuks, that is, act's Without impres-
sion. In th1s part only one conscicut actiOn occurs in the
same identical in!ltant. Thi!~ is admit!ed on all Lands, at
least, it is admittt>d on all hands, that whatt!vcr thinks, thiuks
but one thought at a·time.
We now take the liberty to Pay, that the nerves from all
the senses estend into the brain so a!l to reach tl1c sensorium
commune. But in l.'llying thi~, we would not be undcrstoC'd
to maintain, that if our means of disl'ection were more per·
fect, we could trace nervous cords to the sensorium com-
mune, (though, indeed, this maJ be thP. fact.) but we would
have the reader uud~:~rstaud, tbat, for convenience sake, we

alter a little the common import of the word. ntrtle, so as to
include all parts of the nervous system in which a conscient
action may be E>xcitcd, the H'nsorium excepted. Perhaps we
include ~orne part that is commonly considered as a part of
tht: brain itself, and which we, a~ anatomists, should describe
as such-perhaps we do not. Therefore, as it will h,e very
convenient, in treating of the conscicnt phenomena, to give
the name of nerve to the whole tract of nervo:Js matter pro-
ceeding from a sensible organ to the sensorium, we take the
liberty to do so.
From what we have now said, is is evid.mt that wed~ not
pretend to determine what is scnsoriu•n and what i3 nerve,
by any obvious marks of di~;tinctioo between them. But we
say that the sensorium and the sentient nerves consti'tute the
only parts of the animal system in which conscieut actions
may be excited ; and that the sensorium is the one individual
part which easily acquires a habit of acting without impres•
sion, and which docs not act two actions at the same time,
any more than one body exists in two places at the same time.
Having premised thus rimch, we are nGw ready to state, that
a sensation is a conscient action of the organic. and cerebral
extremities of a nerve-let the action commence in which
extremity it may. But in thus stating what constitutes a sen-
sation1 we do not say but that if a conscient action be excited
in the tnmk of a nerve and in its cerebral (>Xtremity, we should
have a sensation.-Every one knows that a blow on a certain
part of the elbow jo!nt, may excite a conscieut action in the
trur1k of the ulnar nervr:>, constituting (wi tb the action in the
head) a peculiar pain.
In ordinary cases, howev~r, sensationt are excited by im-
presllions upon the organic extremities of nerves ; and when
the action excited t.y the impression cof'ltinues on, not onl1
to, but i"to, tbe ~ensorium, then we have a perception.
Digitized by GoogIe
172
This, then, is onr meaning of the word perception. It is
something more than a sensation or a thought.
A sensation is a conscient action of the two extremities o£
a nerve ; a perception is a conscient action ofthe two extrem-
ities of a nerve and the sensorium ; a thought, or idea, is this
same action of the sensor1um alone.
Suppose a clock to be in a room where a man is playing at
chess-the clock strikes and excites a conscient action of the
man's auditory nerves. This much constitutes a sensation.
Now ifthe 11ensorium have such a strong disposition to think
about tht: game, that the action o( the auditory nerves does
not, in the least, change the actions going on in it, then, of
course, the man keeps thinking right on, just as be would if
the clock had not struck, and the striking ofthe clock excileto
in him, not a perception, but a sensation. Ask him if he heard
the clock &trike, and he will tell yo•J no. But why does not
the man remember, as the expression is, that the clock has
struck ? 'Tis f)bvious-the clock excited no action in that
part of the brain which reacts without impression-no action
of the sensorium.
Ne,·ertheless, I am inclined to think that the cases are ra-
ther rare in which the actions of the sensorium continue on,
when an imprest~ion is made upon the senses, just as they
would if no such impression had been made. I think it much
more frequently happens that the impression excites an action
of the sensorium; but owing to its being, as we may say, so
much engaged about something quite forei~ to the impres-
sing agent, the action of the sensorium which the impression
excites, does not call on, call up, excite, or c.ause to occur,
any other conscient action of the sensorium in any way rela-
ted to it; and on this account it will not readily occur again,
(without the re-application of the impression,) as no thought
•r coosc:ieol action of the seoeorium readily occurs, or, more
);J,i;edlyGoogle
........
178
properly, rtcur1, except it have previously occurred in con-
. nexion with some other thoughts, in 'lome way or other rela-
ted to it. Indeed, we shall show, that mercl) to have recur
any 011e action of the sensorium relative to any one thing,
does not constitute a rememberin~, but merely an individual
thought, notion, idea, or (if the action be one that was origi·
nally excited by way of the optic ner\'es, it is often called
a) conception.
To remember any thing, is to have more than one conscient
action of the sensorium relative to tbi6 thing.-No doubt the
chess-player might have a notion of the striking of a clock,
but this would not constitute a remembering that a certain
clock struck at a certain time.
Some may be Jed to ·maintain that there never is such a
thing as a sensation without a perccption-·such a thing as a
&ensation without an ad of that which thinks, and which we
~ay is the sensorium. For if there be such a thing as a sen-
satioo without perception, then the sensorium is left free to
think about any thing .it bas tendencies to ; au.d if it ~hould
bt: decided that a man may he the subject of one or more sen-
sations and ofthoughb, at the same time-why, such decision
would be a death-blow to modern immaterialism, For it is
admitted on all hands, that one unexteoded, and consequent·
ly indivisible. thing cannot b~ the subject, or more properly,
the agent, of two acts at the same identical instant. ludecd,
nothing can be: more absurd than to assert that it can-I say
assert, for the thing caunot be believed or conceived-it is
inconceivable.
But facts are stubborn thing!' ; and it i11 afact that a mnn
m:~y have two or more sensations at the same identical in-
stant ; and not only so, but he may bal'e ~ne, two or more
sensations at the s<tme identical instant that he is thinking of
somcthiug, even quite foreign to either of them. A mao may

s~e a candle, (or any olher object.) hear a noise, and ha,·e
the toothache at the same identical instant ; or he may see a
candle,.hear a story, and think of the characters aud plares
mentioned, or ofother characters.and pJaces ever sodistant, all
at the same identical in!'tant; hut he cannot think about tbc
candle, and the char.tcters mentioned in the story, at the same
identical instant. If the action of the optic nerves excited
by the can~le, excite a corresponding action of the seAsori-
um, then the man bas a ptruption of the candle; and if this
action of the sen11orium call up other actions relative ~a­
suggest other thoughts relative to-the candle, as, what afirtt
light that candlt gi-oes, what mischiifmight bt done by npplying
it to a cask of gunpn711der, &c. &,-, then, to use th(·, at pre·
sent, convenient language of the schoolmen, the man atttnds
to, or pays attention to, the candle. But so long R!! the ac·
tions ofthe sensorium relate to the candle, there is excited in
the man, not perceptions, but only sensations, b) him who is
telling the story.
To deny that a man may he the !'llhject of two or more sen·
satiout~~, or of sensations and thou~hts, at the same time, is to
assert, that when a man hear5, he instantly turns blind. his
eyes being wide open in broad daylight, and when he sees he
iust&ntly turns deaf, and when he thinks of absent objects,
pa!tt events, mathem:ttical problems, &c. he is the subject of
no sensation whatever.-What an easy matter to cure the

Ca!lt your eyes, reader. ujwn any object that may be be-
fore you -the rays of light reflected from the object fctll upon
the organic extremity of your optic ntrve, aud excite a con-
scient action in this and the cerebral extremity, (this is a sen-
lalirm,) perhaps in your sen,;orium, constituting a perception
of the object; now mak~ a noise with. the heel ofyour ~hoP,
still keeping your eyes upon the object. and observe if you
do not hear the noi~e with)ut th~ least alteration of your view
of the ~bject, al the instant you hear it-Now shut your eyes
and make the same noise, observing if it appear any way djf.'
ferent from befnre. Now st~p- keep youI' eyes shut, and
try to have an irlt!a of the object and of the heel ofyour shoe,
or try to have, at the same instant, an idea of any two things
so situated that a man could not see them both at one single
view, and see ifit is not impossible.
If you grant these things, I may almost venture to put you
down as a materialist without ceremony. If you lir?d it diffi·
cult to satis'fy yourself that you do not have a distinct idea of
the ohject and ~f the heel ofyour shoe at the same insbwt, ~till
you will find no diffic.ulty in satisfying yourself that you may
have two or more distinct sensations at the same time ; and
if you know what the immaterialists hold to, and c.an st?e the
force of arguments, I may still put you down as a materialist
convinced, if not a materiali~t confe5sed.
You certainly will find rt very difficult to determine by di-
rtct expen'mwt that yon cannot have two thorfghts (different
thoughts, of course,) at the same instant ; for this very deter·
71'1ining, obser'Ping, noticing, &c. supposes an action of that
Digitized by GoogIe
176
which thinks, and when this action occul"!!, no other act or
thought can occur ; hence this very difficulty is evidence that
you cannot ha'e but one thought, idea, notion, or conscient
action of the sen11orium at the same insbnt. If we could
think w.~at we think, how we thiuk, &c. at the very .instant
we think, then every man, lf!arned or unlearned, might as ea·
sily tell what goes on in his head when he reasons, imagines,
&c. as he may now satisfy himself that he may have two sen-
sations at a time, or as easily as he can tell how a machine
operates, every part of which ia op('n to his view. But the

We know that two or more sensations, or thoughts and sen·
.eationt:, exi11ting simultaneously, constitute a" complex state
of the mind," according to the late professor Brown ofEdin·
burg, whose speculations concerning the intellectual or con·
scient 'phenomena, are, for the most part, less absurd than
1hose ofany other immaterialist with which we are acquain·
ted.
But this "mind'' of profe11sor Brown, is one single, unet·
tended, indivisible being, capable ofexisting in only one state
at the same time, and of course, all our sensations. thoughts,
and " emotions," are but so many simple states of the mind.
Wher.l see a candle, my mind is in one state, according to Dr.
Brown, if I hear, feel, taste orsmell nothing at the time·; so if
I bear, my mind is in another state, whethf!r I see any thing
or not. These two states are e~sentially different from each
other, as every one will readily grant,pro~idt:d they occur at
different times. Now I ask if they are any the leas so, when
they occur simultnneously. On trying the e~periment as
abo,-e requested, did not the reader fiud that a seeing and a
hearing are two sensations, u di~tinctly different from each
other, when they existed simultaneously, as when they exist·

ed sepantely ? Surely he djd, unless he be tonstituted entire•
ly different from myself. Now I ask if this single fact alone
d(leS not destroy the very foundation of Brown,s fine spun
-,eculations? Would he attempt to get .a_!ong by using the
word comple:a.? telling us that although a man may see and
laear at the tame time, and although these two sensations are
as ditt~fferent from ead1 other as when th!y occur at
diif.ereilltimes, Atill the man's mind is not iu two states, bot
in :ooe" simple," '' cO!mplex" state!
Soppo•e that one were to mainta.in that even an t:rl~ed
body, as of wax, (which may exi!lt as a sphere at one time; and
as a cube at another,) may exist in such a state as to consti-
titute both a sphere and a cube at the same time, and yet be
.O.ae body-would he expect to render his proposition true, or
· ~ make people believe him, merely by makin~ use of the
' 11rord complex? saying, when it exists as a sphere and a cube
i.t;the same time, it does uot exist in two states, but in a com·
plex state ? . "',,,
Ifa certain state of the mind constitnte a certain hearing-
at by Brown maintained-then suth state of the mind and
such hearing arc tbe same thing : the existence of the mind
in such state, is e1stntial to the existence of such hearing:-
the hearing can never be, excE'pt the mind be in such state;
and the mind cannot be in such state without the hearing el[·
isting. And ifa certain 11tate of the mind constitute a certain
seeing, tht'n preciseJy the same stnte of the mind is a/mays
and t~1entially neces~ary to the existence of the same seeing.
Now, a certain hearing and a certain seE"ing, either ofwhich
may exist separately, may bolh exist at the same identical in-
8tanl. It follows, then, as clearly and as irresistibly as de-
monstration, that this " mind'' consists of pa•ts, and, cont~e·
qnently is extended ; and that when a man hears, a pnrl oC
his miod acts or exiats in a certain state; but when be comes

to see as well .as ht>ar, another part ofhis mind is brought int•
action ; and when he thinks at the .same time. he sees and
h~ars, (and I am as certain I can do this as I am that I e:~ist,)
then three parts of his mind act, or exist in certain atates.-
Act they must, (or a cha,•gt ofstate supposes action.
This fact, that a man may think, hear, ~ee, &c. at the same
instant, is a fact which very well agrees with what we be·
lieve to be the truth. But it coml'letely overthrows-we
say it dogmatically, for we f~£>1 tt-this single fact alone com·
pletely overthrows modern immaterialism.
All that Brown has written does not touch the ca11e-does
not reconcile this fact with his fundamental principles. What
he bas written about simple and complex statt:s ofthe mind,
whep brought over to the side ofmateriali~m, can relate only
to the phenomena of tbe sensorium. True, on being asked
what state the mind it~ in wh£>n a man thinks, hears, ~ees, &c.
at'One time, he would uudoubtedly ~ay, it is in a complex
state : we cannot conce.iYe what else he could s~y. But he
generally means (indeed, although W£' have read his whole
work on the philosophy of the mind, we cannot tum to a pas·
sage which shows that he does not alma!!' mean) by a com·
pit:& state of the mind, a simple state in which the mind wo1•ld
not have existed had it not previously existed in certain other
statt>ll-a state too, whi<.h is seemingly equivalent to these
preceding states ; bearing much the same relation to them
that one body bears to the elements of which it is composed.
See some ofhis own words.
" The mind, it must be allowed, is ab!lolutely simple in all
its states ; e\·er.) state or affection of it must, therefore, be ab·
eolutely simple ; but in certain uses io which a feeling is tbc

pear to involve the union of those prect:ding rcelings; and to

ofwbicb, on r<'flection, it thus seems to be comprehensive, is
to perform an intellectual process, wh1ch, though not a real
analy ii!, is an analysis at least relatively to our conception.
It rna.> still, indeed, be said with truth, that the different feel·
ing .-the ~tates or affections of the mind which we term
complex,-are absolutely simple and imlivisible, as much as
the feelings or affections of the mind which we term simple. '
Of thi there can be no douhl. But the complexity with
'Which alone we are concemed is not absnlute, but relative,-
& 6eeming complexity, which is involved in lbe very feeling of
rclation of every sort. "~
From this pa3sage we learn that Brown means by a com-
plex tate ofthe mind, a state absolutely simple and iudivisi-
blc, but a state whic.b is " the result of other preceding feel-
ings." We learn, too, that Brown does not use the word _
" feeling" exclusively to denote one ofthe five species ofsen•
sation, but uses it to denote any thought, emotion, or affec-
ti~n.
Now admitting Brown's leading principle!! to be correct, in
his meaning of the expression complex state.ofthe mind, as
above expressed, he does not comprehend those cases in which
men see, hear, and even think, at the same time ; for in
th011e cases the state of the mind is nol indivisible, in any
sense in which we can speak of the divisibility or indivisi·
bility of a state. The state which conetituteetbe hearing, is
independent of the state which constitutes the seeing, and tbe
state which constitutes the seeing, is independent of the state
which constitute~ the hearing. This is ct>rtain, for these two
l!e08ations moy exist separately. Therefore, when a mao
sees and bears at the same instant, his mind is not in an indi·

vi'~ible state, or rather, his mind.is not an indivisible tbing,
but consists of partt<, and is consequently extended.
Should the Immaterialists remodel their doctrine, .and
send it abroad under an extended form, we t~hould tell tbem, if
their mind be extf'nded, it is nothing but so much space, un•
less it possest~cs some other property ; and if it do possess
some other property, then it is a conbina,ion ofpropertiu, i.e.
it is matter. Yet we should not espect to refute their doc•
trine in Ibis way, but in the way in which we expected to re•
fute immat('rialism at the time we commenced this work i
that is, by giving a more rational explanation oftbe phenome-
na of man, without supposing the exi11tence ofany mind, than
bas ever been given by those who have admilted its exist•
ence ; showing, also, the many insuperable difficulties that
attend the immaterial hypothesis, and calling on its advocatel'
to show us one glimpse of evidence in favor of it.
We have said that ordinary !!ensation!l con~ist in a conscient
action of the organic and cerebral cxtrt'mities of a nerve.
But what, it may be uked, do we mean by an extraordinary
sensation ? We mean t.ensations which consist, in part, ofa
('onscicnt action of a trunk of a nerve. . In ordinary sensa·
tiona, thf're is no conscient llction of the trunk of a nerve;
if there were, when a hot iron is applied to one's hand, there
would be a feeling excited, not only iu tbe band, but all along
liP the ann.
Now if the nerves distributed to nny part, be eompreasecl
or divided any where in their course from such part to the
tenPorium, no ttensation is caused by impressions made oa
eucb part. This fact &f'ems to prove, that in case ofseasa·
tion, somf'thing passes along the nerves from the part upon
which an impression is made to the head.
N,,w, what it it that pas~es along the trunk ofa nt>"e in
tue of ienaation? is it an action, or is it a 6uid ? We bt:li~ve

it is an action ; and the r~>.ader will be very apt to believeso too,
if he believe what we have said concerning the cerebral stim-
ulus. But is this a<.tion of the 11amc nature with that which
immediately precedes voluntary contractions, except it runt
towards, instead of from the braiu ? and what name shall we
pvt: it?
Concerning the first question, we can go so far as to say,
that this action and that which immediatt>ly precedes a vol·
untary contraction, agree io o~e respe<.t, in that of being in•
consc.ieot: further than this, we cannot say.
As to naming it,~incc it will be convenient to di11tinguisb
it from tht: cerebral stimulw, as al11o from thf.l conscimt actions
ofthe nervous nstem,-wc will call it a nervous action.
Sho1,1ld any one be so httle acquainted with the nature of
organized being!!, as to wonder why a conscieot action does
not always occur in the trunk ofa nerve in case ofsensation, '
since it appears that by much force (as a blow on the elbow-
joint,) this kind of action may be excited in the trunk of a
nerve, we will do away this wonder.
It must be remembered that the property of an organ is
nothing distinct from the organ itself; that these properties
are, in fi1ct, mere words of r',!lation. Because a certain part
aulfers certain changes under certain circumstances, we say
it has a certain property ; and a~ parts ditfereuily organized
do not suffer the same chang<'s under the same circumstances,
it becomes nece!sary for us to say, they possess different pro-
perties. or one common property in different degrees, as we
think most proper-most convenient. And as the trunks of
berves are not organized like their extremities, a stronger
impression is required to excite a r.onscieut action in them,
tban in the exhcmities; hem·e we say, the trunks of nerves
PO&fiess a lower degree of sensibility than their extremities.
Tbia we prove by the same fact wbich causes us to sa) it,-
Digitized byGoogle·
182
tbe fact, that it require~t a stronger impression to excite a con·
scient action in them, than in the extremities.
We will now adduce a fact or two, which seems to ~how,
that when impressions are made upon the trunks of nerves so
as to excite n conscient action in the part upon which the im-
preuion is made, or even so as only to escHe a nt:MIOW acti011
in this part, this neM~ous action extends doaln the nen·e as well
as up. When a strong impression is made upon the trunk o(
the ulnar nerve in the elbow joint, a conscient action is ex·
cited in this part of the nerve, and a nervous action in the
parte continuous, and as there is excited a peculiar feeling in
the hand and fingers, we suppose the ner\'ous action contin•
ues down the ulnar nerve as well as up, and excites a con-
acient action in its estremitie!.l, these being more sensible
than its larger branches. A disease in the vicinity of a ne,..
voua trunk may excite a nerrou£1, but not a conscient, action in
it~ This action may extend down to the extremities of such
11erve, and in the@e more sensible parts excite a conscient
action. Hence a ~an having a disease ofthe hip joint, which
disease is ce>nfint-d to parts nearly OT quite insensible, there
ahaII be no pain, or nearly none, in the hip ; but the disease
making an impression upon the trunks of those nerves which
are distribu~ed to parts below, there may be a pain in thde
lower parts, causing the patient, and possibly the physiciao,
to believe that the real seat of the disease is in the!le paru.
If I am not mistaken, it has bP.en maintained that in reality
all sensntions exist only in the head ; or to express the senti·
meot in our own langu11ge, that there is no conscient action
except in the brain. Consequently, when a man has the
gout, or the tooth-ache, there is no pain, absolutely, in the
diaeased part: he may think that there is, but 'tis all a no·
tion; the pain is absolutely in the head whPre the soul is, nod
this deluded thing refeN it to the diseased part. ~bat sort

•1 a thing a pain is, that the part (that une:ttendedpart! cailed
soul,) in which it exists, may refer it to a part iri which it doee
not exist, I do not stop to inquire, but proceed to remark, that
this strange doctrine, which men of commOA 1enu' (a terna
which passes very smoothlJ ifwe do not attempt to define it,)
will never admit, necessarily follows from the doctrine o{
mind. The phi_losopher takes it for granted-for there is no
evidence of it-that there is a eoul or mind in m~n, which
thinks and feels ; this soul he places iu the brain ; and theo
says, " :as nothing can ac.t where it is not, any more than wheo
it •s not," (wbkh is very true,) all thinking and feeling must
go on in the bead. .
You need not be surprised ifyou hear such philosopher P.ay
of a person. " he imagines a thou&and strange feelings.'' But
unless the word imagine be used in some other sense than ita
usual one, such talk i& absurd. Unless to imagine a feeling
mean the same as to experience a feeling, the cause of which
is not obvious, then it is as absurd to say a man imagines a
feeling, as to say he feels as though be feels, which cau only
mean he feels. Ifthese "strange feelings" may be cured by
cheerful company, good news, fright, or by any thing which
excites new cooscient actions 'of the nervous system, it is not
proved that they are not rtal-it is only proved that they
arise from such causes that they may be cured by such means.
Certainly, there is no such thing as an unreal feeling, any
more than ;on unreal coughing, or an unreal motion of any
kind. It sometimes happens that a conscient action com-
mences in the sensorium, and extends d,wn certain nervous
tracts, constituting what some call an emotion, and what we
&hall call a sensorial passion ; and it may be that some of
those feelings called imaginary, consist of <;On!cie!lt actions
which commence in the sensorium ; con!equently, ns we
»hould suppose, may be curt:d, or for the time removed, by

any thing which m:ay excite a new train ofideas, a new trait
ofsensorial actions.
When we say that every flensation is a real sensation, and
1opposes a c.onscient llCtioJo of a nerve in which the sensatioll
~xists, or as some would say, seems to exitrt, we are aware it
10ay be said, that after a pen•on has had a limb amputated, he
often thinks he experien..:c£1 a 11ensation in the amputated
part. · But we account for the fact as follows :-A paio io
the left foot, for instance, is a disagreeable trensation, a disa·
greeable conscient al'tio11, commencing in the nerves of tbia 1
foot, and by the intervention of u nervous action, giving ri&e
to a consrient action of the cerebral extremity ofsuch nerves
~perhaps of the sensorium ; if so, it bt'comes a painful per·
ception, or pain per•·t'ivcd. This action of the sensoriom 1
(which, whf'n it occul'll without the sensation, constitutes a
thought,) may be tollowed hy other sen~orial actions [other
thoughtfl] related to it ; and if tro, then the person attends to,
or thinks about the pain of hill foot ; and his thoughts may be
1uch as may be e\:pressed by these words : " pain in my left
{oot-my left foot-down in my left foot," &c. Now let bi1
left foot be amputated-a(tt'rwardt~ a coosc.ient action com·
mences in the stump, and i! immediately succeeded by a nt'r- 1
VOU£1 action extending up to the brain in the same neroou1 tracl
that formerly conveyed actions from the left toot. Getti"'
up to the brain, a cou~cieut action of the cerebral extremity
ofthis tract :md of the Fcn~orium ill excited. This action of
the sem•orium l'ng~,;est11, or, if you please, is followed by, those
actlon£1 [thoughbo] which formerly occurred on the sensorium
being excited by an ar.tion of the cerebral extremity of thi& I
tract-to wit,. tho!'e ac~ions or thoughts which may be ex-
pre!lsed hy-" pain in my left foot-left foot-down in my
left foot," &c. Tais we l'ontend is all that constitutes a sen·
lation iu the amputated left foot.

We suppose that those wno tell of experiencing a sensatioo
in an amputated part, have frequeutly and recently experien-
ced a sensation in such part, lind thought much a!>out tbe
part; and after the part is removed, some irritating cause,
operating upon the same ne"ous tract which before connect-
ed this part with the brain, gives rise to a conscient actioo ·
of tbe cerebral extremiCy of this tract, and of the sensorium,
which action of the sensorium is associated w.ith ideas rela-
tive to the removed part; and Chat all this. constitutes what
passes for a sensation in such removed part. But let the
person consider, for a moment, that he now possesses no such
part, and be will tell you, if honest, •hat lu does not ab1olutely
t:rperience precisely the 1ame consciousness that he did befort
lhe part tonA amputated; but that it seems to him, somebm~
or other, as though there was a sort of feeling somewhere in
that quarter.
A perception consists in a conscient action of the organic
and cert::bral utremities ofa ne"e [a sensation] and a corru·
ponding actiun of the sensorium. We now proceed to show
what we mean by a corresponding action of the sensorium.
It is that action of the sensorium which immediately succeed&
e conscient action of the cerebral extremity ofa nerve-im-
mediately succeeds a sensation-not by virtue of R tendency
of the sensorium to act such action, but as the effect of the
f;onscient action of the nerve. lt is a r.onscient action of the ,
sensorium which, together with the sensation that immediate-
ly excites it, ·constitutes a perception. It is an action which
is excited in every person's sensorium on the same impres·
lion being made upon his senses, provided the impression ex•
cite a perception, and not merely a sensation. Conscient
actions of the sensorium are contmually taking place when
the pel'l!on is awake ; and in this state, too, there is perhaps
always an impreeaion operating upon 119mc one ofhisscnaes,
24

186
exciting a eeneafion ; which sensation must ofcoune 'be ;m•
mediately aucceeded by some action of the seneorium ; but if
the action orthe sensoriUm'be one that occurs by virtue of·one
ofits tendencies, and not one that is excited by the sensation
-not an at•tion that corresponds with the senaation-tben it
is not a perception that takea place io the man, bot a sema·
lion and a thought.
The sensorial actions or thoughts which follow a certain
perception-but neither of which con11titutet any part ofa
perception at the time it occur1--may he very different io
different persons. The rea~on of this is, because dift"erent
.men possess diff'el'f'nt sensorial tendencies-as will appear
more clearly hereafter.
1 must be permitted to dweU a little upon the subject o(
. perception, even if' I repeat very nearly the same sentimeott
over and over agam ; for I wish 1o have the rea4er think jud
as I do conceminK it.
There is no such thing as a perfect perception without a
sensation, but as we use the word perception, there may be a
perception without attention ; this we say is pessible in the
nature of things-it is conceivable. But I think that w.hen a
man b11s a percepti~n of any object, he generally·altends to it
more or less.-A thought or an idea is an action ofthat which
thinks, and which we eay is the sensorium. Now, although
an action of the sensorium that ie immedia.ttly excited by.a
sensation, is not what I ull a thought 'liJhen it is thus excited,
but a part ofa perception ; (yet it is a thought when it recurs
without the aen,.ation ;) still it may be followed b) other ac"
tiona of the t~ensorium which art' related to it, and ofcoune;.
related to tbe object which exdtt:S the perception ; and if it
be so, then the person thinh about the object or attendl toiL
And to attend to any thing, is the same as to 'Pa!l attention to

to or paying attention. The faculty of attention can ·only
mean that hut for which a man would not attend-would not
att~od to his perceptions, or what is the same thing in other .
words, would not attend to the objects which exc.ite b1s pe.r-
ceprions. Now this something but for which a mlln would .
Dot attend to_.would not think about-an object perceived,
is his sensorial .tendencies ; which tendencies are nothing
original io his constitution, but something arquired, and some·
thing which he never posse!lses until after be has perceivei
-as we shall presently proceed to show.
J am inclined to think that the organic •end cerebral ex.
tremities of the optic and auditory nerves, are so near to each
other. that a conscient action of the sensorium, together with .
a correspcmding action of only the cerebral e:rhemily of one .
of these nerves, is a consciousne1s so nearly like that ofa
perfect perception, that one who is not in tb~ habit of attend·
ing to his percel'tions might mistake it for a perfect percep-
tion-mistake it, I say, that is, be might talk, act and believe,
just as though it were a perfect perception. For illustration,
a certain man is.bt:fore your open eyes-rays oflight are re-
Sected from him, and strike upon the organic extremity of
your optic nerves in such a manner as to excite a certain
consc:ient action in the organic and cerebral extremities of
your optic nerves, and in your sensorium~ This is a peifed
perception of the man. At another time, your brain being
in a morbid state, not only this action ofyour sensorium may
arise, but it may immediately give rise to the action of the .
cerebral extremity of your optic nerves ; which action of the
sensorium and the cerebral extremity ofyour optic nerves is
a consciousness so nearly like a perfect perception of said
man, that you would say the man or his gboet is before you.-
You would say yo~ have something more than a mere idea or
conception of the mao. You would believe him to be pre·

sent until, putting forth your hands, you could not feel him ;
or tlntil something else should cause you to believe that you
experience a " delusion ofthe senses."
The reader is already aware that we use the word sensa·
tion as a sort ofgeneric term, including five species, as seeing,
hearing, feel!ng, &c.; which last mentioned t=pecies has sev-
eral varieties, ,as hunger, thirst, &c. Now we have as many
dift"erer.t species ofperceptions and ideas, as we have ofsensa·
tions. We may ba\'e perceptions by way of the optic, audi-
tory, olfactory, and gustatory nerves, and by wAy of the
nerves offeeling; which last are very widely distributed, go-
ing not only to the skin, but to many internal parts. And as
that action ofthe ~ensorium which, existing together with the
eensation whicb~immediately excites it, constitutes a part of
a perception, doeg. when it occurs indepeodcnt of such sen·
aation, constitute.a thought or idea, we see that we have five
sorts of ideas, as well as five sorts of senaations and percep-
tions. But metaphysical writers have generally very little
reprded only one sort ofour perceptions and ideas, and these
are oar optical ideas and perceptions. In the present work,
most of our observations relative to perceptions and ideas,
will l,e confined to those which come by way of the eye and
the ear, or, if you please, by way of the optic and auditory
nerfes. But as we shall often have occasion to distinguish
these two sorts of perceptions and ideas from each other, we
propose to call those which come by way of the optic nerves,
.,tical percf'ptions and ideas, and those which come by wa1
ef the auditory nerves, audial perceptioua and ideas.

CHAPTER XIII.
On Ideas, and Sensorial Tertdtncies.
Excepting sensations and perceptions, all the conscient or
intellectual phenomena of n•an CO!Jsist in nothing other tl)aq
in having conscient actions of the &ensorium, one after anoth-
er. And all these actions are such as have sometime or oth-
er been excited by impressions upon the senses, or sentient
nerves. .When they were first excited, (and at all times
when they are immediately re·excited by a sensation, or, if
you please, by an impression upon the senses,) each one con-
stituted an essential part of a perception ; but when any one
of these actions of the sensorium occurs without being imme-
diately excited by a corresponding action of a nen-e-when
it does not constitute a part of a pt:rception-then it consti-
tutes what we call a thought, or idea.
But why does· the sensorium react without the reapplica-
tion of thP. impression to the senses, whkh first excited the
action ? This is a question about an ultimate fact, and of
course admits ofno explanation. We know that it is a law of •
the animal economy, that when an action has been excited
oue or more times in a nervous or muscular organ, such or-
gan is more or less disposed to act after the same manner
again. It is on this account we say animals are influenced by
habit; and on this account we might say animals possess the
property of hability, 'with the same propriety that we say they
possess semibility, or any other property which arises from
organization.•
Now there is not, perhaps, in the whole kingdom of organ-
ized ~eiugs, any animal, organ, or part of an OrJ1;an, which is
ltlore influenced bJ habit, or in other words, possessesa great-
,

er degree ofhability, than that part of the human brain which
is called the t!ensorium. This is so mul·h or RO readily inftu.
enced by habit, that when a conscient action has been exci·
ted in it one or more times by an impression upon the senses,
it acquires such a strong di!lposition or tendency to act after
the same manner again, that it does thus act without the re·
application of the impression to the senses, which first esci•
ted the action.
We now proceed to maintain one orthe important posi·
tiona laid down in the first paragraph of this chapter, whicb '
is. in amount, this : No man ever has an ide~ which .is DOl in
the first instance excited by an impression upon one of bil
1enses.
Ofthe truth ofthis position we are most firmly convinced;
yet, owing to the abstruse nature of the subject, and more es-
pecially to the language which we mu11t use in treating ofi~
1re shall not be able to convince our readers ofits truth with·
out some effort on their part. They must remember in what
sense we use certain important words, espr.cially the word
idea, and as they read along, they must frequently "tum their
thoughts inward," as Locke would say, and attempt tbe dilfi·
cult task of determining if what we say be true or faalse.
We begin by telling the reader, that with the exception of
the ideas of words, (which ideas he never much regarded,)
he never bad a quarter so many ideas as be thinks he baa-
we mean real ideas, and not subllituted ideas. He may have

Should you tell me, reader, that you have neverseen Lon·
cloo, but that JQ.U have an idea of that place whi ·h is ddfer-
ent from any idea of any city you have seen-that what yoa ·
call your idea of London, is an idea of a larger city than the
largest you have ever seen, I should suspect tha.t you have
uever been much in the.habit of " turning your thoughts in·
ward," and that, as like as any way, you have no idea of any
city at the time you say so. Think closely, I trust you will
have the luck to satisfy yourself that you cao not have one
distinct, and iodantaneous idea of a bigger cluster of build-
iags than the biggest you have ever seen. But you may have
an idea ofone cluster, and then ofanother to the right OJ" left
of it, and then ofa third, and so on, and when you get through
you may say you hne bad an idea ofa very large city. Yet
we will ventnre to tell you that you never did have ont dis· ·
tinct, and consequently, im~tsntaneou11 idea, real or substitnt·
ed, of a larger cluster ofbuilding• than you have ever seen at
one single view.
Now if we admit that you may have ideas ofobjects which
you have never eeen, .you must remember that you do not
have what we call real ideas ofsuch objects, and tbat by call-
iog a real idea ofone thing, an idea of 1motber thing, you do
not increase your store of ideas. You will remember, too,

You cannot have an idea, not even a substituted idea, o( I
a golden mountain. You may talk about such~ thing and you
may have an idea of a large hill, for you have seen one; butto
have an instantaneous idea of a large hill all o-cer !Jtllom you
cannot. I once thought thai I could, but I am.now satisfied
that my ideal mQuntain all overytllom is not larger than theJar·
gest yellow, convex or globular body I have ever seen. Ifyou
have any doubt!! whether you can ba\·e an idea ofa bill some
miles in circumferance all over yellow, make the attempt, and
then have an idea of a yellow ball a few inches in diameter,
and see how much more distinct and satisfactory is your ideaof
the yellow· ball than ,of the yellow mountain, think of the
blossom of a dandelion on the side of a large hill, and extend
if you can, this yellowness all over the mountain, so as to
have one distinct idea or thinking view ofall the sides ofa
yellow mountain. I trust you will find that you have first an
idea of one part of the mountain, and then of another, and
that you canuot have an idea of a larger yellow surface, than
the large&t yellow &orface, vou have ever seen.
Putting colour aside, I doubt ifyou can have an idea of all
the sides of a mountain, at the same instant. You may, in·
df!ed, have an idea of all the sidt:s of nn eminence at one in·
atant; but on second thought, this eminence instead ofbeing
a rough hill, miles over, is about as smooth and about as large:

man behind me, yet I can have an idea of a great number of
men standing so that I could see them at a single glance ; for
before now I have seen at one glance, many men ~tandin&
thus.
Can a man have any idea of the things (not o( the words)
bonor, glory, pride, indu;~try, soul, behef, trnth, sensibility,
tbe, therefore, yes, and thousands ofsuch hke thing~, if things
they m:ty be called ? To be sure a man may have what he
calls an idea of honor, for instance, but putting aside th!! idea
of the name, or word, what is it? Can be even satisfy bim·
self?
For mv own put, an optical or audial perception of the
word honor, is not invariably followed br any one id('a which
I can call my idea of honor ; but an optical or a11dial per-
ception of the word cow- is generally followed by ont idea,
wh1ch I may in truth call my ide'\ of the thing row. I would
not say my idea ofthe thing cow, is a four-leged idea, po!l!les-
sing two white horns, and a bag with four teats ; neither
would I say my idea of an extended object is an extended
idea-by the by, no man ever had an idea of extension ; he'
may have ideas extended object:', but strictly ~peaking no
idea of extensiou,-what pas!les for an idt!a of space, is a !IUb-
stituted idea, it is that sensorial actiou which ill excited when
a man looks offinto the air. An idea is nothing more nor
less than a conscient action <>f the sensonurn, occurring with-
out the sensation which first excited it, and whic:h may ex-
cite it agai'n, though whenever it be ncited hy its sensation,
it is not the11 au idea, hut a part of a perception. In the sen~e
in which 1use the word idea, I hnve no idea of honor-my
optical and audial ideas of the word itselfe.xcepted. An idea
is ~me idea, and one idea is OOe COn:ocieut action of the SeRSo-
rium ; it is an action which was originally excited by one

•hat is called an idea of honor; but this is usii1g tire word in
.i~ popular sense, we sbould say they constitute a notion of
honor.
We would say that a man may have a notion of honor. of
glory. o( goodnet~fl, of charity, and s••ch like thingless names,
but these notions are composed, aa it Wt're, oft~everal ideas or
sensorial actions. Hence ditr~rent men may have different
notions of honor, glory, charity &c.. So far as I tan deter·
mine, my notion of honor generally consists of ideas of a man
equipped in the style of our highest milit11ry officcN, upon an
elegant horse, at the head of a body ofarmed men. Never·
theleae thot~e ideas which arise when I see or hear tht: wont
honor, and whieh con11titute the notion of honor I then have,
are not always the same, but df'pend somewlnt on the other
words wh1ch I see or hear in <'onncxion w1th the word honor.
A man's idea of an action is but an idea of an age11t act-
ing; and the same may be t~aid with respect to his idea of an
event.-An event is nothing other than one or more agents
acting; and puttin~ a~;ide bolh the oplical and audial idea of
the vJtJrd, a man has no other idea ofau event than that of
one or more agents acting.
When a man goes to church aud hear$ what his prPacber
has to say, let him cease paying attention, and instantly con·
sider what thought~ h~ve been running through hil! brain ; he
will 6nd that be has h~td nothing but a chain of real or substi·
tuted (mostly substituted) ideas, of real or surposed entities;
he will tind, that a!' muct1 as may have been said about heav·
en, Deity, glory, spirit, charity, &c. &c. he has had no idea
of any thing which he has never witnessed.
Finally, ifany man will r-oint out to us any idea which he ·
can have, and which he suppo11e& he did not acquire, directly,
by way of his aeues, we will t:D&&p to lihow him that such

idea is, in fact, nothing other than a number of simple and
real ideas~ occurring in close successien; and is more proper-
ly a sentiment, opinion, or notion, than an idea ; or else that
it is merely a substituted idea, as is that man's idea of Lon·
don who has never seen that city. .
Tbe truth is, as a few material clements combined together
in different ways and proportions, constitute the infinite va·
riety of material bodies which we behold; so the few ideas
which a man may have (I do not ~ay has, for a man never baa
but one idea at a time,) by occurring, different numben in
dilferent orders, constitute all his opinions, rememberinge,
judgiogs, imagini1•gs, &c. And we willjust add in this place,
that the succession of one's ideas is not regulated by any
" willing" principle existing in one's head ; but they occur
according to their relation:! with -each other, and accordinc
to tht: strength of their re!pective scn110rial tendendes.-An
idea is a conscicot artion of the sensorium, and the atron~er
the disposi lion or tendency ofthf: sensorium to act any action,
the more likel.v is this action to occur.
But if our idea~, after excepting ideas of words, are so ver1
few, it may be asked why we have so many words, it being
!Cnerally admitted that words are but signs or representative•
of ideas. Perhaps_ sevtral reasons might be given, but it
seems to us that the two following are the principal ones :-
First, because our ideas, .what few we have, may occur iu dif-
ferent orders Ol' relations with e11ch other. constituting differ·
ent sentiments ; second, because we sub!ltitule an idea ofone
thing for an idea ofanother thing, perhaps for a third or fourth,
and so on-and thus we have what we call ideas of thousand•
of thiugs which we never saw, and which, perhaps, never ex·
isted.

Association of /dens. The !lensorium not only has tenden-
ciu to act iuJividual actions, but it is di!'posed to act, in im-
mE-diate succes~ion, those actions that are. in !'orne way or
other, related, Cl(leCiaJiy tho~e that are related in rt>Sp( ct to
the time in which they have before occurred, or been exci-
ted. If two idl·as have occurred in immediate conuexion,
they have occilrred at the same time, according to the com·
mon manuer .)f speaking; and in this respect, ifin no other,
they are related.
When we talk about a man's thought~, ideas, or sensorial
actions being relatPd, Wf! u~e conveuient language ; but Jan·
guage that is not so strictly correct as language that might be
hl\'ented.--$ince the sen~orium acts but oue ac~tiou at the
eame in~tant, strictly 11peaking, these action!', directly and of
tht·mselves, can no more be related, than one thing whi1.h
does exist, nn be related t9 a thing which does not exist, or
what is the same thing, no more than a thing which doc~ ex-
i!lt can he related to nothi11g. However, we shall still con·
tjnue to speak of relatione betw~en a man's idt•a!l, and shall
now endea\·or to show in what re~pcct ideas arc related, !iO
8S to rllll toge!her Or IIS!lOCial~ in families, Or trains.
First. They are related in respect to time. When two or
more actions or ideas have occu•re•l in conne~tion, they have
occurre-d nearly in the same timt>; and .the sensorium is
anore or less dispo~ed to act afler the same manner again,
that i!l, to act lhe!le actions in connrxion again : it is more
di~tJO~ed to do thi!l, than it is to act in connexion tho11e actions
whi~h never Jt:l oc:currrd in connexion, other things being
equill. All action!l or idea!l that haveocc11rred in immediate
auccesaioo are 11aid to be related, as to time.

Second. When ohjPds are in any way rt>lated, our ideaa
of these objects are relatrd. A giant i'l a very large man. a
dw11rfa very 11mall man : they are both men of uncommon_
tize; in this respect they are related. And when a man
!t'es or thinks of a dwarf, he may soon think of a very large
man; he may think, ho_w much smaller thi1 man is than some
oflh.t large men me read of.
Aman's portrait has some re~emblance to the man him·
self; in thib respect they are related; and a sight or thought
ofthe portrait is very likely to be followed by an idea of the
man. Ohjecb of a similar appearance excite similar actions
of the sensorium ; and it i" not strange that the sensorium
should act similar actions in conncxion, instead of di~similar,
all other things being equal. The sensorium has many Ldrong
tendencies to act, and when it is in a good condition to act,
some action .or other is continually taking place; but when
it bt•comes tired, as the express10n is, it cc~es to act, aud
becomes recruited by Rleep.
Those ideas which are related on account o(some relation
between their objects, may be said to be related hy way of
their objects ; and we cannot see as there would be any im·
propriety in calling this sorl of relalion between ideas, objec·
lil)e relation.
A~ some objects are related by way of their names, the
written or Ppoken name of one object may be followed by an
idea of another object, though this name and this object are.
as dis•imilar as boots and butter. The word huok may be
socfeeded by an idea not only of the word bu't of the thini
book.
When a man acquires two or more sen~orJal tendencies in
the same place, I do not think the~e tendencies or their \!Or•
responding actions are related, barely on account of his hav·
,._
iog acquired them in the same place. To be sure, they may
~98
be·related, hut it is became they were acquired atthe same
time. Or if time inten·ene-if the man acquire one tenden·
cy on one day, and remaining in the same place, acquire an·
other tendency on another day, these tendencies are linked
together, as it were, by intervening tendencies, that is, by ten·
dencies acquired between the two days.
Nevertheless, a man may be in a certain place, and there
see a c.arriage turn over ; but this carriage is not all he sees;
be sees something which remains there for years ; and all be
aees at a ~ingle glance, excites but one action of his sensori-
um ; and when the man returns to the 'place years after, be
may, for aught we know, think of the carriage; nut solely be·
cau8e he saw it at t~.e time he saw the place, but because a
part of the scene which ncited this one action &till remains,
and is enough to re·excite, or call up, this one action which
irtdudes, as we may say, an idea of the carriage~
Perhaps it will be said thllt we have now done as g~>od as to
g;ve up what we have just been contending for, viz. that sen-
sorial tendencies acquired in the same place are none the
more related, barely em this account ; but we believe that
we have not. The ~e~ond view of the place does not call
op, immediately and directly, an idea of the carriage alont,
but it excites an action, which is much like that excited by
the first view ; the sensorial action excited by the first vit>w
of cour!c recurs, aud inc.ludes, as we may t>ay, an idea ofthe
carriage-in other words, the second sight of the place doea
not suggest an idea ofthe carriage alone, but an idea which in-
cludes ao idea ofthe carriage. This, however, is a nice dis-
tinction between mattel'll and thmgs, and we have written
this, and the precedil'lg paragraph, chiefly for the purpose of
·!bowing what ma)· ~e 6aid, being all the while pretty posi-
tive that the second view of the place calls up the idea of
the carriage, solely because the man bad' previously aeen the

place and the carriage at the same timt. To enable our read·
ers the better to decide concerning this matter, we put the
following question :
Suppose a man goes to a certain strange place, and there
acquires a sensorial tendency by seeing a very deformed mau ;
this tendency l;e retainA, but every other one acquired at the
place soon dies away, ~o that he can have no notion ofthe
place, the name of the man, nor of ""Y thing which he wit•
nessed at the place, the bare conception ofthe.deformed man
excepted. Now let the man go to the iarn6place again, and
acquire one more tendency, and only one which he retains ;
tbe man bas now two senllorial tendencies acq•Jired at the
same place. But do you think they are any more likely to
become operative together-do you think thctr corr«-sponding
actions or ideas are ·any more likely to occur in connexion
on this account ? If you answer no, then you decide that ideas
are none the morP- related and none the more apt to occur in
connexion, barely because they were excited when the man
was in the same place; and that if such ideas are disposed to
run together, it is Gwing to &orne other cause.
Putting aside all things without the skull, and going into the_
aensorinm, we 11hall find but two kmda ofrelations between ttl
lt:ndencies, objective and timal.•
It is true, that two or more tendencies m:ly be equally
strong; in this respect they agrte'; but they are not on this
account related. A man may have an hundred sensorial ten•
dencies of equal strength ; but if the tenth become operative,
the corresponding action of the eleventh is no more likely to

ded there be no relation between these hundred tendencies,
eJtcept their bein~ of equa ll'trength.
Suppose all the !'ensorial teuderrr.ies which a man pos!lesPet
were of equal ~trength, but there is nothing of what we call
relation between tht>m ; then his thoughts would occur pro-
mi~ruously-thc partiwlar thought. A, would just &tl hkely
be succeeded by the thought L. F, X, or any other thought,
as by the thought B, or auy other particular thought. But
when we say t:ensorial teudencres are not re!att>d, merely on
account of their agreeing as to streugth, it must not bt> sup·
posed that the succt'asion ofa mau's thoughts is no ways inftu·
enced hy the strength of his teudcucica ; for. putting a!'rde
impressions upon the senses, the succession of a man'•
thoughts is governed by two things only. and streogth of ten·
dencies is one, of them: their relations with each other is the
other.-Let us suppo!le there are three thou~ht~J. A. 8, C,
equally related. (related hy way of their tendencie11.) hut that
ttre str~ngth of their rt·!'pective terrdencies is different, that of
.A being equal to 2. as we will say ; that of B equal to 3, and
that of C equal to 4. Now if any thing sugge~t the thought
A, the thought C will immf'diately follow in preference to the
. thought B, becau~e. although no more clot~ely related to the
thought A thar1 is the thought B. there is a stronger tendency
ofthe sensorium to think thi~ tho••J?;ht, or to act this action,
than there is to act that action whict. constitutes tht' thought B.
lfthe sensorium were not di!>posed to think those thoughts
in connection which are in snme way or other related, or
rather, if our thoughts Wt!re not rdated (for indeP.d, we sbould
not say our tboughb are rt>latcd only that we find they occur
in some kind of order) we should not be intelligent bf'ings,-
we might be sentient, preceptive, and even thinking ber~ ;

iew ten•lencies stronger than the rest, the!e tendencif'P, only,
would be continually giving rise to actions just as it happens.
It i~ owing to the disposition of the sensorium to act tho11e
actions in connexion, which it ha11 previously acted thu11, that
we are enahled to make U!le of language, or signs. The writ·
ten or spoken word, John, may excite a notion of a man; a
certain man llecanse that sensorial action which constitutes
(in part) a perceptio-n of the word John,,has before bPen excit-
ed. or has before occurred, in connexion with the sensorial
action which constitutes, in part, a perception of a man, a
certain man. Ifthese two sensorial actions were not dispos-
ed to occr1r in connexion the seeing or hearing of the word
John, might be immediately succeeded by a notion ofa triao-
cle, or ofany thing eltte you may please to mention.
Were it not for this disposition of Ihe sensorium, neithf'r or
those modes ofthinking whkh we call, remembering,_judgtng,
and imagining, would be found in us. We should have no
substituted ideas. The word London would not call up an
idea of a cluster of buildin~s. We should be as much below
beasts in point of intelligence as beast~ are now below ut.-
When we @et through with the intellectual phenomena the
reader will be prepared to a~ree with us, wheu \Ve say, it is
probable that so far as the functions of the SPilsorium alone
are concerned, beasts differ from men in the strength or per·
fectio" (neither word suits us} of th~ir associating principle,
by which ambiguous expression we mean, the disposrtion or
tendency of the sensorium to think those tbougbts in coonex·
ion, which are in any way related.
This disposition of the sensorium is also a sourse of plea11ure
as well as of pain to us. Wf' have painful and pleasurable
thoughts, as well as painful and pleasurable sen!'ationP ; that
is, we have conscienl actions of the sensorium al,ne which
we call painful or pleasurable, a.; tile case ma) be, as well as
~6
Digitized bvGoogle
202
actions of the nerves and ·the e;ensorium, or of the nerYes
alone, which we call pleasurable or painful. Besides these
actions of the sensorium we have many of an intermediate
nature, which we may call neutral, as to pleasure or pain,
sine~, of themselves they constitu~e neither the one nor the
other. Now ifa plea!lurable or painful ar.tion occur in con·
ncxion with one of these neutral actions, a timal relation is
formed between them. and all that may afterwards be neces-
sary, to produr.e the p~tinful or pleasurable action or thought,
is to excite the neutral action.
Some neutral thoughts may be related both to pleasurable
and painful, or if you please, agrceRblc and disagn·eable
ones; and when such neutral thonghts are excited or sug-
ge~led, the agreeable and dis~gre_eahlc ones may sucr.eed so
intermingled, as to con$titute emotious which, tal,en as a
\\hole. one can scarcely call agreeable or disagreeable.
There is a cane which I have often seen or thought of, nt
the same time I have seen or thought of mJ friend,-my friend
is now dead. nnd when I see or think of the cane sorrowful
thoughts relative to my friend aud his death occur. There
is a lady who~e company has pleu!led me m•Jrh; and whatev-
er excites a netion of this Indy giv.e:~ rise to agreeable thought!,
or recollections, I care not "'hich you call them, since cv<'ry
body knows that by giving one thing two names, you do not
make two things of out',
It is ill manners to cause to occnr. disagreeable thoughts or
emotions, in any _one in company wtth you ; hence, owing io
the di~tposition of the .sensorium, to thi11k those thoughts in
coAnexion which are any way related, it is ill manners to men-
tion any thing which has any relation to a subject which any
one pr~.sent cannot think of but with disagrecablt> emotions.
A man of thought and civility, in company with a lady who
has been unfortunate, or with a person whose near relative
..
:203
bas been hung for a heinous crime, will never say or, do any
thing, in any ·way calculated to call up an idea of her misfo...
tune. or any thiogcalculated toexcite an idea ofthe halter or
even of hemp.
Owing to this disposition of the brain, als!), it may be con·
sidered slanderous for one man to say ofanother, •· he ought
to be carried out of town upon two chips!''
A knowledge of the sensorial tendencies shows the house·
keeper that no woman can be called neat who sets a filthy
mess of matter by the side of any kind of food, even if it be
-k~10wn that notl.ii•g can be communicated from 1he filthy
mess to the food ; for whoever sees these tw<> things in the
same place, sees them at the !la,me time, and hence acquires a
tendency to think ofthem at the same time, and it is not agree·
ablt: to think of filthy matter when one is eating.
It does not appear very strange to us, that actions of the
sensorium, which arc somewhat alike, (alike, I say, for like
impress1oos-like objects, to appearance, excite like action!<,)
ihould occur in c.onnexion; and not at all strange that the
•~•~?rium shouid be disposed to act in connexion those ac-
tions which it has previously actad in connesion; for this
fact appears to be much akin to m'•"Y other facts with which
we.arc familiar. Still the fact admits of no explanation. To
refer it to the inftuence of habit, is not to explain it-to refer
it to a law of the a'nimal economy, is not to uplain it ;--this
law is only au ultimate, inexplicable, and general fact, of
which the fact in question is an instance. And if we call any
thing mysterious, this f11ct is my:!teri<>us; it is just as myeteri-
ous, and no more so, as it is that one body io motion should
put another in motion by striking againit it. But what we
would more particularly impress at this time, is this: That
thought whi<.b is immediately succeedt:d by anotl.er thought,
is as much a 4:ause of the oc.curreuce of thia other thought, al

the motion of one body is the cause of the motion of another

It is sometimes said that one thought Juggt•ll anotla~r, is
the occasion of another, &c. ; this is all wt:ll enough ; it is
but saying in ottu~r word!', that one thought i!l the catllt of
another. A thought ia an act ofthat which thinks, be it wbat
it may; it is an event ;-but we have no events without cau·
aes since the Deity organized the unh·erse, and every event
(every thought, of course,) which does occur, must as nec:es·
Barily occur as an effect must follow its cause. This is a fact
which the immatt>rialist cannot dt'ny, admitting his fundame~·
tal principles to be true ; males!l he first refute the principle,
universally admitted,.that there are no event& without cauw.
The se11sorialtendencies are strengthened by intensity. and
by repetition of at·tions-We believe that actions of thuen-
aorium may be of different degrees of intensity, as well as the
actions ofother agents, and the more intense any action of the
aeusorium may be, the stronger tendency does it produce to-
wards its re(;urrence. As to frequency of action or repeti·
tion ofaction, every body knows that the more frequently, or
the more times, be thinks any thought, or <;hain of tbougbla,
the more apt is he to think such thoughts again.
The 11ensorial tendencies ma} be weakened or even de-
llroyed by whatever may impair the healthy condition oftbe
brain. Diseases, accidents, intemperance, and old age, may
do this, aod are said to weaken, impair, or destroy tbe "me·
mory."
But it is not to be forgotten, that there is a wide difference
between weakening or destroying the sensorial tendencies,
and choking them.-A man receives an inJury of his heed;
some piece of bone or some effusion of hlood compret~ses the
brain, (consequently·the sensorium,) so that the thoughts or

man is in a eomato!le or sleeping state, and for the timP. being
he is dead as to all perception or thinking as he ever will be;
but after a ti~e. either by an artificial or natural process,
thrs pre1111Ure is remo\ed. and the brain bcgms to think again,
and to think the same 'thoughts too, and the sarr·e chains ~r
trains ofthoughts that it did before the injury. This proves
that the sensorial tendencies were not destroyed by the ir~o­
ry, but only choked or counteracted ;-the sensorium was so
compressed that it could not act, though it still possessed its
tendencies to act.
Jn some instances, an injury of the brain is partly but not ·
entirely remond. In such cases the man may see, but riot
hear, or may hear and not see; he may be insane, ~hat is, his
though~s may occur in odd, unnatural relations, or he may not
be able to think at all until his sensorium ha\'E' acquired new
tendencies. If we mit~take not, there are instances on re-
cord of pe~ons recovering (in part) from diseases and inju-
ries, who could not think a single thought until they had ac-
quired new tendencies by impressions upon the senses, and
yet succeed very well in acquiring a new education. In
such cases we should he pretty positive that all old tenden·
cies were destroyed, were it not for the fact, that old tenden-
cies have been choked by some lurkin~ c.log in the brain, for
years, and yet become operative after such clog is removed.
\Ve have somewhere read of a man who learnt two langua·
ges, and being taken sick, he could not, on recovery, recol· •
Ject but one of them for several ye~V"S ; but at length he be-
gao to have notions of the words of the otheNanguage, and
theee notions were succeeded by notions or ideas of the
things which these words represented, or in other words, the
man began to f'tmember the otber language. Now the rea-
son why the man, on recovery, could remembf'r oue language
aud not tbe otber, was undoubtedly this :-The tendencies

<Felative to the langoa~P. which he r.ould recollect, were
• strmlger than the tcndcucie!! relative, to I he other laug11age ;
and all the tendencies of his sensorium were so far choked,
obslrueted, or counteracted, (neitht>r word exactly suits,) that
the weaker could not give ri~e to actions. ' .
A fall, a blow upon the head, or a fright, sometimef; removes
the lurking clfJg in .one's brain, enabling it to perform all its
intellectual f11nctions as before it received any injury.
There are many facts which seem to show that the brain
may suffer a greater degree ofinjury in \'ihat we may call its
phyttical or:;anization, witholtt dc:stroying its functions, if
·such injury be produced gradually, than it may if the same
apparent injury be produced suddenly.
As t0 oiJ a~P-, it is probable that it operat('s, not so much
bv destroying old tendencies as by disenabling the brain for
arquiring new ones ; for those tendencie!' whi-ch were acquir·
ed in youth, and wh.ch h;,ve been 10trengtlu:ued by repetition
of action through a long Feries of.years, may become opt>ra·
tive, when the impressions ofycsterd.ty produced such weak
tendencies ; that they will not become operative to-day, on
any or.casion whatP.ver, short of the reapplication of the im·
pre~sionc;, and .then, indeed, it is not the tendencies of the
sensorium th:Jt give rise to the sensorial actions, but the im·
pressions which excited these same actions yc~terday.
The sensorial tendencies ar.e nothing distinct from that
part of the brain "hich we call the sensorium. If the sen~o·
rium be removed or dt•stroyed, these tendencies go along with
it. When aU..he tendencies produced by witnessing an event
are annihilated, the person can no longer recollect the event.

or fifteen year!, (no one pretends to state the time exactly,)
the old malter ofone'~ system iR all clnnged for new.
If thi~ supposition b~ correct, it follo\VS that none of the
particles of matter whcch ~ompo~ed my sensorium fifteen
year; ago. constitute any part of it at the prc~ent time ; hc1t I
can remember events which I \Yitnessed more than liftren
)'t'ars ago. Some may think th1s fact argues against our
principles, but we think not.
We will admit, for the pre5ent, that the sensorium under·
goes sur.h changes as to be constituted entirely of new matter ·
as often as once in seven years ;-we shall be under the ne-
cc>sity ofmaking no irrational suppositioll~ to reconcile the
fact, that au old man may remember the events of his youth,
with our principles. All that is nec(;s~nry to produce a ten·
dency of the sensorium to act any action, ie: to have this ac-
tion occur one or more times; no matter by what means or
in what way it is caused to occur. Now suppose the senso-
rium have a tendency to ad a certain action, and now eup-
po~c again, that a few of the particle11 which f'nter its struc-
ture arc removed ;-the tendency to act this action is not de·
!lroy<'d-to say the most, it is only weakened, and the action
may again recur, renewing the ~trcngth of the tendency to-
wards its recurrence ; nnd in this way the tendencies of the
liensorium may be kept good, ·nl•hough the old particles of
~·hich it is organizcd are gradually changed for others.
The fact that an old man may remember an c\·ent of his
youth. argues nothing agAinst our principles, until two things
be established. Ftrst, ·that the !!ensorium does un<lergo such
chaugcs as we ha\·e admitted, as often, we will say, as once
in seven years. Second, that during the10e se\·en years
(or we will even say three of them,) the old man who remem-
bers an event of his youth, did not thiuk of this event.
But neither of the~e tbiugs can e\·er be proved, and, in.

deed, tht're is not the lea~t shadow off"vidence in favor of one
of them, and very little in favor of the other. There is no
~vidence that. a man doe~ not thiuk of tho~e eveut.s of bia
· youth which he remembers whf"n old, a~ often as once eve-
ry three years from the period of his l'outh to that of his
old age.
Not a day pa!l!lt!'S in which Wf" do not think of hundreds of
events without heing able, at 0 ht, io say that we ha.ve or
ba,·e not thought of surh eveuts. A man may thiuk of an
evr.nt of his youlh a thousand times a year, and not be able
to say at the ypa r's end, that h_
e has thought of it once. He
is not likely to renwmher that he h~s~ thought CJf it. u·nle~s he
thought of it on some momentous occasion, as tor instance,
when one of his old friends and playmate;; called on him, and
talked o"er the scenet~ which they witnesH·d while young.
As to the ~t>nsorium undergoing such changes a!! are brought
about -by the processes of absorption and nutritiou, tbere is uo
proof of it.
The reader knows that lymphatic absorhent11 are found
in mol't, if nut all, parts of the body, exo:!pt the brain, and
the~e absorbents are ~;up post d to take up aud carry o1f the o:d
material• of o11r orgau11. Now the cluef evadence (if t Yi-
dence it may be callt-d} in favour of the brain having lymphat-
ic absorbents, is merely analogical-mo~t parts of the bodJ
possess such absorbents, and it is iuft:red that the brain ~oes.
But the ac.ulest anatomists ofevery age that has gone before
us, with all their uice imtrnmtnts and magnif.> ing glaSSf'S,
have not been able to di~co,·cr a !lingle lJmphatic vessel o{

this in~hility to discover any proper abPorbents ofthe brain,
is very slronj evidence that the brain has no such absorbents.
1t is true that the wins may, and do ab11orh liquids from va·
riou,s parts of the body ;-the veins of the llrain ·may absorb
water from the ventricles. The veius may absorb adventi-
tious fluids applied to a wounded ~urfacc, or e,·en to the
sound integumt"nts; at least, we will admit so much; but
there is not a single fact. pa1 '•"1ogical or experimental, that
tends to show that the veins '\::., •. down, a11 it were, and carry
off the sohd fabric of our bodies-This is undoubtedly a pe-
culiar function of the lymphatics. The brain never piuefl
away during sickness.
CHAPTER XIV.
On Remembering.
To have conscient ac.tions of the sensorium recur without
impressions, is to think, and to think is essentially the same
as to remember.
To remember any thing, is to think more than one thought
re\ative to this thiug.
I taee a man ; this 11upposes one action of my sensorium,
(that is, if my seeing is not a mere sensation, but a percep·
ti.on) ; I think of his name, his' homt>, his father, his occupa-
tion, &c. ; this suppo3c& other actiona of my, sensorium.
Sometime after, iu a distant land, this man again presents
himself before my eyes, and excites the same single action of
llly &Pn&orium that was excited when I before saw the man-
excites that action whkh, if it recur without impres~ion,
thut is, wbeu the mau ts ubsent, coostltut~ what the school-
27
o;9,t;zed by Coogle
2iO
.nen r.all ~conception of the man; but to have this action ex·
cited, is not to remember the man. The man ~ays to me,
" my name is Bartlett ;"but if the action excited in my brain
by his pronouncing this wCJrd, not the action excited by seeing
the man, do not call up some other action, 11ueh as constitutes
a notion of his home, or of his father. or ofsomething else re-
lative to him, it canuot properly be ~aid that I remember the
man. So, on the other hand. ifa certain man's name be .John,
it cannot properly be said that I remember tltis man's name,
when I merely have occur that sensorial action which is ex•
cited when I see, or that which is excited wl1en 1hear, the
word John. This ~ould be but to have an optical or audial
idea of the word; but to remember tbis man's name, these
ideas must be connected with others, such as an idea of
this man • ofsome place in which I ha,·e seen him, &c.
To remember an event which I ha'Dt witnessed, I must have
something more than merely an idea of an agent acting-
merely this would be nothing more than a conception. I
must have an idea of the place in which the event occurred,
and of myFelf being there. But to remember an event which
I ha\'e heard of, it is not ueceFsary that I have a notion of my-
self being at the place where the event is said to have trans·
pired.
I do not think it is est~ential to the rememhcrin~ ofa past
event, that I have what is called a '' scn~e of the past ;" yet
when one remember!! an event which he ha~ witncsiied, cer-
tain conscient actions of the sensorium will always occur,
which conS'titute what we call a sen~e of the past ; aud •e
1hall presently attempt to show whnt thet<e actions are, or in
other word~, by what impres!!ions they are excited.
It is true, that in order to remember the time in which a
particular event took place, one must have something more
than notions of agents acting, and of places. Suppose ao

event happened on the lOth of June, 1824; in order tore;
member this particular time, one must have a notion ofa day
audoftbemarks or word&, 10TH or JuNE, 1824.
As to what con11titutes a notion of a day, (not of the mo,.d
day,) so far as Ican judge, when .I have a notion of the sun in
th«: east, over my head, in the west, and ofgoing to breakfast,
dinner, &c. I have "'hat I call a notion ofa day. Neverthe·
leas, I pre!ume that different actions of the sensorium. at dif·
ferent times, con:!ltitute what goes for a notion ofa day.-When
I endeavor to detNmine what~onstitutes my notiou ofa day,
putting aside all ideas of the word, I fintl that it is something
that comes .and goes pretty quit·k ; and I am not !>Ure as it is,
in thet:e cases, any more than one action ofmy sensorium,-
perhaps that action which is excited wlwn I 90 out in the
morning_and take a glance at things around-the arched he.av·
ens, the sun in the ea:>t, and the terrestrial objects that may
fall within my sphere of vision. ·
I generally have a peculiar idea ofan afternoon. It is that
action of my sensorium which has been many times excited,
when I have bl·en in my father's west room, aud seen the suo
shining in at the windows.-When I undertake tu determine
what is my idea of an afternoon, I 6ud that this action or idea
alway~ occurs; and I cannot find that I have auy other idea
which can 6e more properl.v called an idea of an afternoon .
than this ; therefore I call this my idea of ao afternoon. Per-
haps some will determine that theiridt>a of au afternoon, is an
idea of that part of the arching heavens which extends from
the meridian to the western horizon. But as for our baviug
any thing but a substitutrd idea or notion of an afternoon, or
of any thing else that bas never excited an action in our
brains, we cannot.
But what constitutes a " sen~e of the past ?" When a mao
remem'>ers an event which hi! wituessed l~st fall, be ba11 a tense
it!
of pat!t ; now what constitutes this sense ! It is t'erta.in ac-
tions of the sensorium that have been excited since last fall ;
sue~, for instance, as constitute notions ofa wint~r or spring.
One's notion ofa winter consists ofsuch actions as are exci·
ted by looking at white fielda, by seeing cutters run by-by
hearing sleigh·bells, &c.
If a man witness an event and instantly become perfectly
senseleSt!, and remain so, I don't care ifyou say, ten thousand
yean, and then come instantly into the same thinking state in
which he was the instanf before he became senseless, he will
tell you that he saw this event, but an instant ago; he will
have no sense of any time having passed, from the moment
he saw the event, to the moment he tells you so. Th1s will
be admitted, and it is proof that when a man remembers an
event which be bas &een and has a sense of past, this sense
consists in having recur at the time, certain sensorial actions
that have occurred between his witnessing the cveut, and his
remembering it.
Perhaps it may be determined that we have not mention-
. ed every thing which musnake place in on~'• head to con-
stitute a rememberiag a man, a remembering an event, &c.
But if we have said enough to show that our definition of re·
membering is correct, we care for nothing more. We think
:we are advancing new prinCiples, but do not pretend to fol-
low out all the fine·spun speculations that may be connected
with these principles. We only aim to convince that we are
right in the main.

CHAPTER XV.
On Imagining.
We are too apt to think that every word must have some
peculiar meaning. The word, imagination and the word
· imagining, are so incorporated, a:~ we may say, into our lan-
guage that we cannot com·eniently do without them ; and it
would appear rather presumptuous in any one to say that tht•y
mean nothing. Yet we will venture to say this, with re:;pcct
to the word imagination ; and as to the word, imaginin~, it
will puzzle any one to gtve it a satisfactory dtfinition. It can
mean nothing more than a mode ofthinking which ts not essen·
tially diJierent from any other mode. When a man imagines,
nothing more can take place in his sensorium, than one con-
ecient ac.tion after another, (it is admitted.on all haud~ that
whatever thinln!, thinks but one thought at a time.) and this
is what. takes place when a man thinks, or remembers, or
judgeE~.
,~We would have every reader endeavour to determine for
himself, what goes on in his head when he docs that which he
call1 imagining. He will probably find that he has notlung
but real or substituted ideas of things, o11e after another; b1,1t
he may find that a very great proportion of his ideas are sub-.
stituted ; and perhaps we cannot define imagining in a less
objectionable way than by saymg it consi~ts in substituting
ideas. But there are objections to this definition, as well as
to every one that we can think of, one. objection is this :-
We often substitute ideas when it would not generally he said
that we imagine. To avoid this, we must alter the common
meaning of the wo.-d, (if any body know what this i~.) and
say that whenever a man substitutes au idt:a of one tiuug for
Digitized by GoogIe
ll14
an idea of nnothP.r, he im:~gines. Let us now see what g08
on in the scusorium when a man substitutes one idea for
auother.
We begin by remarking that every substituted idea is, in
itself. 8 rt-al idea ; it 1!1 a real action of the "en!lorium excit·
ed by ~omP. o~jert, which action constitutes a real idea of this
ohject, but when this 1dea occurs in connexion with an idea
of the name of some other object, it bf!comes a 8UbsiitutuJ
idea of !'nch other objt>ct, aud is not a real 1dea r>f such ob-
.fect, and ) ct it is a real idea. I have t~een a clutltcr of build-
ings ; of course I can have a real idea of this cluster of build-
ings ; and if thi!l idea occur when I read of London or when I
think of the name, Lortdon, I ha\'e a substituted idea of Lon-
dor..
Whf'n I ":lY that, I lttbstitutt one idea for another, I use
such laugua~c a!l I am obliged to-it is the language of a false
philos!)phy, aad is,calculated to deceive. The reader must
know from what has ht>en l!aid, that l a!' a 'free agent, do
nothing,-/ don't "will" an idt•a, I don't substitute one idea
for anotll(•r ; hut rather. an idea of one thing occurs in me,
in t•onnexion with an idea of :t.e name of another thing; and
this i!l all that COio!'titutes a substituting of an idea ofone thing
fnr 1m idE"a of anotht>r thing-this is all that constitutes an
imagining how thi~ otlwr thing looks. Our metaphysical
vocabulary i~ full of nonseusical word11 and expressions. Lt:t
every man " turn his thoughts inward" and not be deceived.
A man may say that he can imagine a horse standing upon
tht top ofa house, although he never saw such a sight. Let
us examin~:: this matter.
In the fin:t place we may put aside the word imagine, with·
out any pn·_indicc to thE: scuse of1he sentence, and say:-
"he can ha\ e an idta of a horse sta~ding upon the top of a
house." Now if tbis man have any knack at examining his
Bii·'rl···· -.

•
ideas, he will find that he does not have an idea of a hone,
:sl the same instant he has an idea of the house. He may'
have one single instantaneous· idea of somethi11g largt at •h&
boltom and little at the top, for be has seen many such things,
be b:is seen houses with chimnies extending out above the
roof, and he has seen several other things upon the top of
bou!'es; but he cannot have a real, and of course distinci,
idea of a horse upon the top ofa house and such idea of the
house at the same time. Howt'ver, it is the ea!liest thing in
the world, to talk and write about a horse upon the top of
a- house, and while a man is doing this he has time to have
real aud distinct ideas of a good many things. But this talk·
ing and writing are sGmcthing more than what goes on in the
brain,-we are only endeavouring to show what goes on iu a
man's sensorium when he is !laid to imagint>. And \Ve do not
hesitate to give it ne our opinion, that when a man has what
be calls an idea of a horse upon the top of a t.ouse, no individ-
ual action of his !lensorium occurs, which has not, sometime
or other, been excited hy an impression upon the senses.
Perhaps !!lome may say that imagining con!li!!ts iu discover-
ing new relation!' bt:tween thingt~ ; but by this exprc,~;ion the'
can mean nothing more than that the imagining person thinlcs
ofsome relation between things which no one evt-r thought of
before.;_the relation itself is a:1 old as tho~e that Wf'rc thought
of years before. 1 neve-r thou~ht of any relation betwt>en a
homely girl and a black~mith's leather apron, until somebody
said tht'y both ~eep the sparks off. Now he that fir~t thought
this, disco'!ltred a utw relation, as the expression is, betl'(een
a homely girl and a blacksmith's leather apton-he imagined.
But whAt took placE: in his 11ensorium ? Surely, no uew ac:·
tion, no uew thought ; but Qld actions in a new ord,!r. This
is all. And rhese actions did not lakt- place in this order, be•.

dencies were such as to give rise to them in this order.

011 Signs.
By t~igns, we here mean 11uch motions, marks, noises, and
bodies, a~ excite in us ideas of ~omething besides themselves.•
This is the best briifoletinillon of signs that D!e can give ;
but it may be said, in opposition to this definition, that if, in
any man, at any time, the word dun give rise to an idea of
the thing gun, then, according to this ddiuition, the word dun
i11, in this inl'tance, a sign of the thing gun. Thi~ we cannot
deny ; but the mark or word dun does not generalis excite,
and is not generally i11tmded to exrllP, the idea of a gun i
tl.erefore we do not call the word dun, a sign of the thing
gun. Yct the word dun is a sign-it is the sign of a written
or verbal request to a man to pay a •lebt.
The motions whtch we ha~ referrence to, above, are, for
the mo8t part, those of a person's head, lips, eye-lid~, and su·
perior extrem1tte!'. The marks, chiefly those which we see
upon paper. whHher letiers, word~, arithmetical figure~, or
hieroglyphi<.ks. Tt.e noises, such as one makes when he
talks. Aud the bodies, carved images or any otht:r bodies
that are u~ed as representatives of somethiug besides lh~;m·

In treating of signs, we shall r.biefly ronftne our remarke t~
wo1ds written or ~polren. We scarcely need tell the reader.
that by written words we not only mean words made by a
pen, but printed words.
We shall first attempt to show hote or why it i• that word'
excite, or more properly, call up. ideas of things distinct from
themselves, and even absent from him, in whom such idea•
occur. Aller this we shall rhow in what way we suppose
words fin;t got into use-in what way Adam and Eve came
by their language.
The reader knows already, that with us a thought, idea, ana
a conscient action, or simply an action of the sensorium, are
all synonymous terms or expressions. He knows, too, that
the sensorium is disposed to, or in other words, dot~ think
those thoughts in.connexion, which are in some way or other,
related ; and furthermore, that nothing relates thoughts more_
closely., than their occurring in connexion, that is, in imme"'
diate &IUccession.
New if I he11r the word, ratllt-boz,• at the time the thing,
rattle-box, is presented to my ,·iew, two actions are excited
in my head, one by hearing the word and one by seeing the
thing ; and as the~e actions are excited in connexion, noth•
ing more may afterwards be necessary to call up tbat senso•
rial action which constitutes an idea ofthe thing than the noise
or sound, which is made by pronouncing the word. So on
the other hand, nothing more is wanting to call up that audial
action of the sensorium which was excited by .this sound, thao
a eight of the thing rattle-box. .~gain : The written word
rattle-box is aa much a visible thing or object as the box it.

&ear it pronounced, on optical action of nw sensorium is tt~
eited in connexion with an audial, which optical action is di(.
fert>nt from the one excited when I saw the lhing rattle-box;
And it may now be said that my sensorium possesses three rat~
tle-box-tendf'nties, which are very c.losely related. One ten·
dency is to act that action which constitutes an idea of the
thing rattle-box ; another tendency is to ac.t that action whicb
constitutes an audial idea ofthP 'IIJOrclrattle-bos; and the third
is a tendency to act that action which constitutes an optical
idea of the word rattle-box-an idea, thought, conception, or
thinking 'Pie'IIJ, of the marks, RATTLE-Box, as they here staod.
The first tendency is related to the second, and by fiJO!J of
th1 second, to the third, inasmuch as, by supposition, I never
1arr the word rattle-box, until I had hearcl the word and see11
the thing rattle-box.
Now as these three tf'ndencies arc related, when either
of them gives rise to its action, the other two may instaotty
do the same; hence an impression which ucile$, or a thought
.which suggesll that sensorial action which con11titutes, in the
first case, a part of a perception, aud in the latter, an idea of
.a rattle·box, may cause to occur two other sensorial actions
relative to a rattle-box; the one such as is excited by hearing,
the other, such as is excited by seeing, the 'IIJord rattle·box.
So on the other hand, whatever may caul!e to occur, either of
these two sensorial actions, may be followed by an idea o{
••
the thing rattle-box.
From what has now been 11aid, we see that if A be a sign ot
B, then ia B, also a sign of A; and if B is a sign of C, then
is A an indirect sign of C. The thing ox is a sign of the word
os, as well as this word, a sign of the thing ox, that is, in the
broad sense of the word sign ; but as the thing ox, is not
6tnerally intmded to represent the word os, it is not a 8igo
of this word, in the restricted aen&e in which we generally

.~the word sip. Ifthe thing ox be a sign of a yoke, the~
is the word ox, an indirect .•ign of a yoke.
Any one thing becomes the sign of another, in the broad
.tense of the word, when these two things have often excited
actions of the seneorium. at the same time; or when these
two things have often been thought of, at the same time.
Hence it is easy to see and admit, that what .is a sign of one
thing to one man may not be a sign of the same thing to ano-.
tber.man.
I may have sometime dug a certain well, in doing which .I
aaed a pick-axe, day after day, and tho't of the pick-axe and

wen. -
There is not, perhaps, a man in this country who, if he
were to plough up a tomahawk, would not inatailtly think of
Indians; but there may be thousands of men in other parts of
the world who would not instantly think of Indians on seeing
a tomahawk. If there be not, it is only bP.cause there are no
people who have not thought of a tomahawk and Indians, at
the same time. '
The same word may at different times be a sign of different
Jhings, to the same person; this is owing to its connexien with
·other words, and to several other circ.umatan('es, that might
· be mentioned. H a man should say to me, •· Do you recollect
that John whom you saw at York?" I should ha,·e an adea of
large, dark complexioned man; but if he should say," Do
yoa recollect that John who made your boots?" I should have
an idea of a short, light complexioned, blue-eyed fellow.
We scarcely need mention that signs call up sensorial a~
tioos only, and not nenous actions--thoughts, and not sensa·
tioos. Jf they called up, or re-excited nervous actions, then
the sight or sound of the word Gout, would produce excruc..

reader will be careful that be do not here misunderstand us.
When we aay that signs do not recall nervous actions ; when
;,e say the sight or sound of the word goul does not rc·excite
that oervou3 ·action which constitutes the pain ofgout, we do
not mean that this sight or sound excites no action of the op-
tic or auditory ne,u, as the case may be. Altho' a view of
the word ox does not excite that action or the optic nerves
which ia excited when we see an ox, we do not say it uci!es
Ito action of the optic nerves.
As we much more frequently hear words than see them. we
believe that' the oplical action of the sensorium which is e:r-
eited by 1eting a word, and which occurring alone (without a
sensation] conatitutes a conception of a word, never occurs
without being immtdiattly succeeded by that audial action of
the sensorium, which is excited when we hear this word spok-
en. Yet when we hear words spoken, as in common dis-
course, we seldom have conceptions of these words-seldom
·thiFak how they look on paper: the sound of each word excites
its own peculiar action of the auditory nerves (perhaps ofthe
eensorium also, constituting a perception) and this action is
followed by an action of the sensorium which constitutes a no•
tioo of some object. and not by an action which constitutes a
conception ofsuch word written on paper. We think that no
person will find much difficulty in satisfying himself, that the
opinions we have here advanced, are true•

John, than his optical idea or conception of John himse:C
d;tfena from a seeing of John, He will fiud, also, Ihat the au•
dial actions of the sen11oriu1n which take place in him whde
pcrusiug a book, are immediatel!J, and of cour10c very iustanta-
lleously &ucceeded by o~ical notions of objects mentiont>d in
the hook.
But every person may fiod that when he listens to him
'lfho is telling a atory, he does not generaII} have conc~ptious
of Ihe words which the story teller uses; hut that all his con-
tcptions arc of objects menti(\ned or suggested by the story
teller ; which conceptions may be real or tmb&tilntcd.
We lay it down, then, R5 a general fact, that the seeing of
aword it almost invariably !!Ucce~dcd by that sensorial action
•hich constitutes an idea of the sound of such word ; but
that the hearing of a word ia not generaily succcctlcd hy that
sensorial action which constitutes a conception of it. Why
it is ,o, we do not r.crtainly know, but 8,tuiB it is this ; When
we first Wf!nt to ~chool, and began to learn our letters, and to
read and spell. we seldom saw a word without htuing it pro•
oourJccd at the time; and furthermore, no word was then a
sign of a thing to us, until we had heard it pronounced ; but
before, dur.ing, and afler our 6rst going to school, we have
\'ery frequently heard words pron~uoced, and at the nine
time ~een the things of .which lhey arc names, when we did
not see tbelle words.
We are now about to offer an opinion, which mar. at first
appear il'l'lltional, but whicb we believe w1ll1- sometime or
other, be generally admitted as true. It is thi11 :
When a person mho isfamiliar mit!& t,\e mortl1, reads a book
er bear11 a story. perceptions are very_rarely excited in him• .
The reader must have a correct notion of wh.lt we mean
by a perrrption. Hr must conceive ofthe sensorium as au
actiYe little organ, situated ~omewhere about the centre of
the brain. pos~essing many tendencies to act, and contiootllf
at ''• wht·u the man i~ awake; and that it i11 the OI'J;BD which
't!.iuks. He must remember, too, that five kinds of nenes
exlend to. and unite with, this organ ; that an action ofany
one of tht>~'.: ncn•cs i$ a Ecnsation, and that if this 1ame lnrwl
of ucrvous action conti,1ue along into the sensorium, tben we
ha' c u perception; hut if this puticular nervous artion, in·
stead of continuing along into the aen1orium. qnly continue
.ul' tn it, and cause 1hc 11cnsorium to act some other actioa,
whid• it (liiJrrwise would not, we do not have a ptrceptitm,
but a H)IH t . !I aud n thougl&t.
Fer A mnre particular illustration, if I look at the word
Juhn. an action will be <:xdted in my optic nerves, which we
call an optical actiun, and I shall have a sensation, a seeing of
this word, if this opticnl action extend no further; hut if it
coniinue a!ong into the sensorium, then I shall have a ptrCtp'
tion, an optical pfretplio,., of the word John. If this optical
adion, in5tead of continuing Into the sen:~orium, onl1 extend
up lo it, nnd the ~cmorium,. on this ocr.asion, owing to ill
teradettcie!', take on that action which constitutes an audial
iclt>a of the word John, I do not have a perception of the word
Jolm ; but I hnvc a sensation and· a thought. Now we be·
lievc that tilis is what frt-qucntly, ifnot generally, takes place
wh('n one is reading a book which much interests him, and
" ·hich is writlrn in an t'asy style and familiar language. He
tlorat attend to the words the~aelves ; he dont think ofthem ;
his scnsori11m is continoa11y and uninterruptedly tbinkiog
about something elt~e: it appears to act, as .we may uy, ac·
corcling to the knocks which it receives upon the outside, aod
Mt according to any gentlemen wlaich come into the hou~e.
Yet when this reading man come• acron a new and singular
Bil
i word, er a word printed in large capitals, he has a pereeptioa
· ofsuch word, and may, therefore, have a conception of it
when he getit'through witb the page and closes the book.
However, it is a mere matter of judgment whethe•·, whea
one reads1ln interesting book, every word excites its own pe..
c:uliar action of the Jen!orium, and always must remain so.;
for Ihe in!ta.nt we attempt to determine the question by1ot..
serving what goes on in ourselves, that very instant ahal1 we
have perceptions, and not sensations of words, orat least, thiJ,t
t~ry instant do actions cease to go on in our brai.:•bef
d1d before. And we must confeas that we are a .. · ·.u.._
that one has audia1 ideas of words when he pentsel:a book,
except wben he stops to consider whether he has or not, and
even then, some may perhaps decide that they bave, and oth-
ers that they have not.
. But if we cannot determine whether a man alway~; percetvt-9
words when he reads, except by considering [thiuking of'}
facts, it may be asked wliat facts we think of when we come
to the conclueion that he ~oes not. Some of the facts, oJ
more properly considerations, are the following : ..
First. We know 1t is not impossible nor uncommon fora
man to tbinJc and sense at the same instant ;~we know that
we ean see an object, hear a noise, and think of something.
~oite foreign to either of tht>m, at the same instant ;-if we
dont know this, then we- dont know that we exist.
Second. When ptrceptifml of words have bt>t-n instantly
succeeded by ideas of objects, many times, it is not diffieult
·to admit that these ideas may be caused to occur b) mere
sensatioos ofsu\!b words ; and if we admit this, then we have
the ten5orium free to think of objects, without being every
moment interrupted when one peruses a book. And it frees
.lis from the necessity of admitting that the sensorium acts .'JO
"'ceedinslylinlJ aa it does upon the supposition, th1•t w~

one reads :md under!ttlnds an author, every word of the au-
thor must be perceived before it can suggeet an idea ofa thing.
However, there are many words which are Qfj. tbe signs of
any particular entities, and wheo a person readt a -.triag of i
such words, a great proportion of "his sensorial actions art 1
rncre audial ideas, or ideas of sounds, and a large share If
'the remainder, substituted, instead ofreal ideas. If the Bi«bt
·ofthe words the, 011, yes, tndh, honor, gratitude, &c. e~:cite
any thing but mere audial ideas, such other ideas most be
such as we call aubttituted ; for, surely, thf're are no 1ud
lhings as the, oo, truth, &c. in existence ; and it would be
-absurd to say a man can have a real idea of a thing whicll
never existed ; we might as well say :1 man has been to Jio-
co, when there is riot, and never was, il.ny JiogOt for a mAn It
co to.
As we -have now bee" showing why it is that a perception
er a thought of one thing rnay call up a thought of another
thing, or in other wort.ls, why one thing may be, to us, a sip
ofanoth,er, it is a,fit place to offer a few remarks conceroioc
J,rutt>s. We believe that, lo Jar at the 1emorium alorat il
"•rmcirned, the chief, if not the only reason, why brutes can·
110t U&e Olle thing as the sign ofanother, il because thi& orpn
1u them does not acquire t~ufficiently strong tendencies to ac~
jn immediate tutcenion, th,,se actions which it has previoully

(figurAtive hao6uage, because their tugguting prin~k u se

~ut whethP.r a brute's l'ensorial tendencies do ss readily
become as strong as those of men," it is very difficult to
dt'lcrmine ; for if the ~ensorial tendencies of a brute, to indi-
. fidual actions, shonld be as t:trong as tho'5e of men, &till they
might not become operative on such sli~ht occasion!', as those
ef men, owing to the weakness'of the brute's suggesting prin·
ciplc.
That brutes po~sess a suggesting principle, or in more co·r·
rect lang•aage. that tho~>e :~eu~ua·ialactiuus which have occur-
cd in close successioli, in them, are more or less disposed to
occur so again, i~ true beyond a doubt. Many 1111 old experi·
enced ox has been known to loll on a cold winter's morning, on
seeing the ,-oke about to be put upon his neck ; but why does
the ox loll ? It is not because he i~ warm, but because the
sight of the yoke &c. excite!', or more properly suggt-sl!l, for-
mer ideas. It causes him to think of his labouring in the
field or on the road, aud to think that his master has often
ceased to drive him when he has breathed quick and sbort,
and suffered his tongue to l}ang out.
It is true that the ox's sensorial ac,ions on this occasion,
are quite d•lferent from the -11ct~ons that 'rould be excited by
bearing or set!mg the words which we have u;,ed in stating
\\'hat the ox thinkll ; but these wordi arc ~uch as we are un·
der the necessity of using.

only a little more defl'ective than what it now is. Sucn meR
see, already, how a little difference in this principle may give
rase to the striking differences between a stupid fellow aad a
man of wit, or a man ofjudgment. Such men, too. are now•
rt>ady to admit that the original difft>reur.e between the intel·
lt·ctual powers of Adam, and the bruled around him, might
be almost, perhaps altog"ther, owing to the d1fference be-
tween his and their suggestir•Kprinciple ; by which short and
convenient expression, 1. lru~t I shall not be understood to
mean any thing more than the disposition of the brain to
think in connt>xion those thoughts which are in any way re-
lated ; and by thiR dispo~itiou, we mean nothing more than
simply the fact, that the brain dots thiuk ~uch thought~ in
connexion. Should there be a'ny who ca1tnot conceive how
a little dioerrenct> in the suggeFting principle should be one
of the grand, original, or as we may say, fundamental1 causes
ofthe intellectual difference between a man of wit and a stu-
pid fellow, or between a man and a beast ; they will, per·
haps, be enabled to do ,o, by r£'adin;,; the chapter on Judg-
ing, to which they will ~oon come.
It is generally said that wo1ds are marks, signs, or repre-
sentatives ofideaf'. This saying has not been strictly exam-
ined. Concerning it much might be ~aid. We shall merely
remark that :-Mauy. words are more properly the ~igns of
objects, actions1 q•mlities, and of relatio115 between the!e
.thing~, th:tn they arc of ideas ; that rna1•y other words arc
not the signs of any thing, putting aside the ideas of these
wot·ds themselves-the word, S.nJ, we r.lass among thiS num-
ber. And on the whole, as we use words more particulart,y
for the purpose of making our fellow beings think of some-
thing besides our ickas (which, by the by, are things th:tt no
man caa have a.• idea of) aud RS they answer the purpose for
whicb ti.e.) a1e U:ied, "e conclude lb.tt there is no great pro-

of ideas. They are more properly signs of tbings without
the skull.
We now proceed to offer a 11upposition of the way and
manner in which Adam and EYe came by their language,
and to offer a few remarks concerning the way in wbicb chil·
dren acquire a use of the signs, the words. already in use.
Suppose that the first time Adam saw Eve, he met her
with a large red opple in hill hand : Eve had eaten such
looking apples, and found that they were pleasant; she there·
fore wishes to obtain this one : She approaches Adam, and
puts out her band to take it from him. Adam seeing he is
about to lose his apple, withdraws his hand. Eve, at first,
know~ not that this motion has any particular meaning ; but
after making several attempts to take the apple, and finding
that Adam alwaJI withdraws .it from her, she is led to think
that Adam intends not to let her have the apple. She, how·
ever, makes one more attempt ; Adam now withdraws his
hand, holding the apple, and Ill tha same time makes a noit~e
with his vocal organs.. This noise is at first an insignificant
&ollnd to Eve ; but again attempting to take the apple, or
something cl.;e, and finding that this sound always attends the
act of refusal, she at 'length thinks, as a c-hild wo•Jid, that Ad·
am wonld have her to understand by the noi11e, the same that
he does by the ge!lture. To satisfy herself as to this, sbe
again attempts to take the apple ; Adam only makes the
noise ; Eve is not yet satisfied ; Adam sees she is not, by her
still persisting ; he therefore spe.tks louder, perhaps repeats
h•s souud, and at the same time repulse11 Eve. By this time
Eve is satisfied that Adam means by h•s sound the same that
We now e~press by these words-gou •hall not haTJe it.
Pre~ently Eve finds somethrng which Adam wishes to ob-
taiu. He approaches E\e as Eve bad approached him; but

!ve ma1cP!l thP t~ame noi~e that Adam did ; and Adam knows
full wt>ll what l!he means by it; he know~ that 11he mean!l the
same that he did. They are now a~reed as to the n!!e of one
sound ; and this may aid tht>m in acquiring the use ofothen.
Adam and Eve now walk about together, and when they
come to a tref', ror.k, brook, or any other o~ject, one points
at it, and at the same time makes a noise, which noi~e. of
course, becomes to them a sign of such o~iect.-The object
excites one action of the z>ensorium. the sound or noise an-
other ; and these two actions having been excited togetht>r,
all that is nece~sary to suggest. au idea of the object, when
absent from it. ill to make the noise.
At one time Adam jumps over a log. and al the same time
makes a certain noi~e. Here is an action, an event, and a
sign to denote this artion, and henceforth, this noise may be
followed bJ an idea of the event. •
SuppoE>e, now, that Adam and Eve had pen, ink anif paper,
or what would an~wer the purposes of these material>l, Adam
m:tkes a mark, but to Eve it hns no meaning, until Adam,
pointin~ at it, m·•kes a noil'e; it is now to Eve a sign of this
110ise ; and if the noise be the same which Adam made when
he pointed out a tree. it is also a !'ign of a trf'e, and of couNe,
of thP. same use to Adam and Eve that the mark TR.U: now is
to us. ln thi:s way could Ada·m and Eve go on and form, for
themselves, a sort of language, which might, as we can eAsily
perceive, be improved by succe<.'ding generatious, so "' to
become as perfect as any lang!Htge now i11.
Ifthis !lupposition of the way and manner in which our first
parents acquired a Ul'e of sign!! he <"Orrect, we flee that they
were enabled to do ~o. because th'lt when two or more actions
are excited ir1 the sensorium at the t~ame time, it becomes dis·

had been organizt•d a httlc d•tfcrent, so th:~t lht!Y would ~ot
acquirf! any di$po~ition to act two or more action!! in close

place in the nursery fur the three or four fi•·st years ofthechild's

.When a child is learning the lette" of the alphnhet, two
kind11 ofacti ms are excited in his sensorium ; one by way of
the optic nerves, the other bv '-.:t)' of the auditory ; the tirst,
a~ the readf'r know!!, we call optical actions of the sensorium,
to distinguish them rrom the latter, which we call ftudial ac·
tion!l of the sensorium. ~ow when a child has thoroughiJ
J~arnt a letter, the optical action of..this (by which I mean, ez·
cited by this) letter will be immediately succeeded by the au·
dial action orthis letter; or the audial action will {perhap:5)
be immediately succeeded hy the optical, should the audial
chance to occur prst. Jt matters not whether the optical or
the audial action be excited or 1uggested, in either Cll!!e the
one will be follo~ed by the other.
The child having lc:ant the letters of the alphabet, the
tE:acher turns to words. Let us suppose him to turn to the
Word !UN ; what dOCS the teacher do, and what goes Orl in the
ehild'>~ head when he is said to Jearn to read the word man ?
The teacher points to the first Jetter and says : What is
that ? The child says, M. What is tbat ? A. What is that ?
N. "VE'ry well," sa)'s the teacher, ''pronounce it." But
thf' chil(l knows not what the teacher means by "pronounce
it ;" howf'ver, it sounds to him like a command to do some·
thing, and he looks the teacher iu the face, to know what.
1'ht> teacher now pronounces the word, and the child soon
learn!l what he means by ''pronoun<'e." He will now tell off
the letters and pronounce the word. After a time, the teach-
er shuts the book, and tells the child to 11pell rna,.. But the
child know~ uot the meaning of the word "spell," and must
learn it in the same way that he learnt the meaoing of the
word pronounce. After this the child can spell man, Cor the
action exctted in his liensorium when the tP.acher puts out
the word to him to F>J•f'll, suggests a notion of the three let·

to do, but to tell"off'theae three letter as he · sees them in his
"min~'s eye," and then say, ma11, as t1e has often done he·
fore, immediately after tellir.g off the three letters 11 A~.
From this we see, that the action of the sensorium, excited
by way of the audi!ory nerves, when a word is put out to
spell, calls up that action of the sensorium whirh has before
been excited by seeing 11uch word; just as the sight ofa word
calls up that audial action of the sensorium which has been
excited by hearing such word pronounced.
Our httle urchin has now learnt his !etten and learnt to
read and spell the word man; but if this is all that ht: has
learnt concerning this word, th•·n it is to him, no sign ofa being
which talkt~, laughs, and walks upright, upon two legs, and
it never will b~ until such being be pointed out to him, at the
1ame time he is told, "thj, is a man;" or, until h~ be told
"that was a man which you 11aw pass by just now ;"or, until
he have learnt the meaning of the words, talk, laugh, walk
v.pright, hoo ll'gs, &r.. and found by a dictionary that a MAN
is a being that talks, laughs, and walks upright upon two
leg!!.''
Bt>fore clo~ing this chnpter. it may be well to say a little
concerning the or•gin of the word soul; in doing which we
thall give the reader 1t clue for accounting for the origin of
many thingi{'!!B ·narnes.
To be brief, we will at once say, thot men learnt.by expe•
lienee (the only way, in the bre;ad sense of the term, that they
come to know any thing) that there i~ an essential difference
between animals and inorganic bodies ; and a wide, if not an
tBwJJial dilft!rence between men and other animals. Now it
is the same thing in different words expre~sed, for a man to
lt·arn that there is an essential .ditference between two things,
as it is, to learn that there is something in one of these things,
which there ia not in the other. And having learnt that llaere

in the pre~enl enl!ghtened age, ht:liPve in the exi5fence of
souls or mind:-~, as dtstinct th:n~~ from the animal system.
As every hody knows that there is something peculiar in
animal:,~, and as this something is said. by tho~e who pa~s for
learned, to be a heing distinct f10m the body--to be a aoul ;
it is a!l natural for the unlearned to believe in the existeJI(.e of
a soul, as it is for them to bf'licve that the earth stand:5 still,
while the sun moves round the earth. · And as as,tronomy
alone has taught us the motions of the heavenly bodiel', so
must phJsiology alone, teach us the constitution of man ;-
neither I he one -11or the other is to be learnt in any book writ·
ten by the ancients. And as materialif,m must, and will be
established, the prudent religionist will no more think of op-
posing it with his Btble, or his Koran, than he docs of oppo-
sing the present system of astronomy by the same book-it
would be like bringing an egg against a ro(.k. As christians,
we would no !Ooner admit that materialism is opposed to
christianity, than we would admit that christia01ity is fitll'e.
As to showing how we come to have au idea of a soul, we
shall leave the task to such not.tble brains as that of Mr.
Locke, (who has charged us not to bdie\'C in the existf'nr.e of
thing,; of which we cannot form di:~tinct ideas,} since w~ know
that, putting aside our opti(.al and audial ideas of the word it·

Nevertheless, in stating those f<.>cts and considerations,

whi«'h have Jed. us to a cer~ain conclusion, we gt-n.-rally pre-
fer some nne arrangement to another ; but this arise!l from
the fact, that by diffL'feUI arrangements of the t~amc words
and sentence!!, w~ may t~ugge~t d•ft'l!rent thou,;hts in others.
We endeavor to arrauge our remarks in such order that
the true force and meaning of one may not fail of oeing un·
dt'rstood for want of some knowledge that ought to have pre·
•iously been given. It will never answer to begin in the mid·
die ofa story, unless we suppose our reader or bearer to be
already acquainted with the first part.
Aod if tbere be any ditft!renee between JUdging and reason·
ing, the difference is this :-When we reason we not onl1
judge, not only think over thoughts relative to a quest1o111
but we etpress our thoughts in an order, arul for the purpo5e
ofconvincing other~. But in aclmitting this difft!rence, st.ill
i~ iSte!ISentiaJiy t~e same to reason as to judge, liO far as it re·
spects what goes on in the brain, batiug it~ motive act10ns.
It appears to us that the only consideration which any one
will even thi~k of bringi11g forward in opposition to the opin·
ion that wheu a man judge~', it mattrrs little iu what order his
thoughts occur, is thi~: if d,tft•rent men knowing the same
facts concerning any opinion, undertake to cortv;nce other1

can detErmine, that when we jud~e coucerning any su~;ect,
ourthoughtsoccur,as we may~>ay, all aho•lt,ju_~t as it hap·
pens. They octur much r..~ter than we could express thelll
by speech or by pen and iuk, and in such an order as "'

\Ve think th~t imrnateriali:~t~ have but two ditf«'rent I)Otions
concerning the nature of idea.;; the one that au idea is some·
thing distinct from the mind ; the other, that an idea is a state
of the mind. Now it is granted on all hands, th~t the mind
can e~ist but in one !!late at a time, or,..cousidering 1111 idea as
something diqti net from the mind, that there can be but one
idea in the •• mind's pre~et;ce-chamber,'' at the same timc.-
Tu be sure, ~orne speak of a" store of ideas," but these very
pt•rsomi themseh·es know not what they mean, nor does any
one else, uuless they mean thn sensor:aI tendencies.-N'lbody
bdieve!l that we can oo\·e hut one thought, iclf'a, or act of
that tohicl& thiuki at the ~;arne identical instant. It is certain,
al~o, that 'every idea is (in itself cousidcrt:d, and uot consid·
ered in relation to somdhiug cis~>, or all the s<:hoolmen would
tay, abstracteclly con!1idcred,) a rial idea, and must either ex•
ist or not exist ; and as only one idea exi5fs at one limP, no
other idea exists at the same time. Now, in the name o£
common sen~c, how does one ~>late of the mind compare to-
~tber two other states that do uot exist ? or how doe!l one
idea compare together two other ideas that do not exist ? or
bow does on~ act of that which thinks, compare together twp ,
other acts that do not exist? or how docs one state, idea. or
act. compare itstlfwith anothl'r state. idea. or act, whic.n does
not exi~:~t, or what is the same thing, compare itself with no·
thing?
If we admit, for the sake of argument, that a man may be
laid to compare two ideas. in auy common at·ceptation of the
word comp.trt>, we m••st admit that this comparing is an act
o( that which compare11-of that which thi!1ks ; and if an ac·

But the truth i~, when a ,man is @aid (\-·erJ improperly) to
compare two thoughts together, and to be smsiblr of a differ-
ence hrtwu:n Ihem. no third thought intervenes. To have two
cli.ffi:rrnl thou~hts in immt·diate succession, is to be sensible
of a dtllerem·e bt>twt·en tlwm• . This i$ the very nature of
Chought!l. If wt• could not ~ay tlmt we are ~ensible of a dif-
ference hetwecn two thouu:hts, then the~e two thoughts wouJd
be alike ; tlwy would. to all intents and purposes, be hut one
thought orc.urring twice. When we say we are sensible o(

However, by altering the common meaning of words, you
can make out any thing you please; you can make out that
three times ten is not thirty, ifyou alter the common meaniaig
of the word thirty. and 'loay it is equal to seven times five; and
in thii! way you cnn make out, that when a man judges, he
not only compares together things that exi11t without the head,
but ideas with ideas. And as it is a common way of speaking,
to say of a man. he compares ideas, compares one thing with
another, &c. when he judges, it may, perhaps, be as well not
to dil!card thi/form'of speech. but to show what the word com·
1'are mul!t, in truth, signify, in the various instances in which
a m.tn is said to compare.
If we compare two bodies that are present for examination,
in order to be sen~ible whether they differ in app,arance; the
act of comparing con!lists in nothing other than in viewing
these bodaes on all side11; and if there be any difference of
appearance between them. we are immediately sens1ble of it,
without an)· subsequent actio11 of or re·a.:tion of the r.ensori-
um. Ohjet~ts that are difff·rent io appearance excite dsfferent
actions in the optic nenes and sensorium-excite d•tfel'ent
perceptions ; and a 1eme of di.Jfere"ce beiween our percep-
tions, as between our thoughts, supposes nothmg more than
that these pear.eptions ate different-if there be no sense o(
difference between two perc«>ptions, then .these perceFtioul
are, in truth, one per•·t>ption occurring twice. To be sen&i-

In the abovt• case, the fi•cts which le-.td to the conclu"ioo
that a two inch cnbc ofgold is worth eight timt>s as much as
a cubic inch, arc, as the exp1eesion i11, 11elf-evidcnt-there ie .
no dispute about tht-m. men are univtraally agreed as to the
meaniug ol each word used ; heuce if the judger think of all
of them, and not u•e any word in 11omt> new sense, the conclu•
aion which he comes to, aud which he expres11es, must be o£
the same certain and ind•sputable nature. But if there lle
tome error in the data-ifthejudger take that for true, which
is not true; and if there be not two errors that shall counter·
balance each other. the conclusion must certain!}' be fal11e.
Suppose a man who does not know what a two inch cuhe
is. were requested to say what the difference is between an
inch cube and a two inch cube ; he might think : An inc.h ia
one inch, two is twice one, and hence a two inch cube ie
twice as much as an inch cube. Here would be an error of
the judger ; it would be an t>rror to think that a two inch cube
bean the same relation to an inch cube, tbat two bears to
ene. It maltere not what the cauae oftbe error be, whether

i1 be owing to so much perfect ignorance; or to a slip of the
man's sen!orium ; or, to !!peak in intelligible language, whf·
ther it be owing to a toant oftho~e sensorial tendencies which
. .
give rise to such thoughts (not to mention others) as we ex-
press by these words :-A cube i; a body of six equal sides,
which join or meet at right angles; or whether it be owing to
the wefJkneu of these tendencies, so that the man thinks ~he
would if he had them not.-As we have said, an ignorant'
man's opinion is as likely to be correct, as the opiuion of him
who docs not think.
In all cases in which a man thinks erroneous data, the con·
elusion must he false, unless the errors be such a& exactly to
counh ract, or counterbalauce each other.
For illustration, suppose a man is to judgE'! how long it will
take a hor~c to travel from Templeton to Boston. Theda·
ta are : It is ~fventy·tu:o miles from Templeton to Boston; a
horse can ll'aVt•l ~>ix miles an hour :-the conclusion is, it will
take a horse twelve hours to travel from Templeton to Boston.
But this conclu~hn, though correct according to the data, i1
in reality erruocom;, bt·cause one of the datu is erroneous;-
it'is but ~ixty rniles from Templeton to Boston. Yet as we
l1avc satd, two errors may he of such a n.•ture as to counter·
ad ea<.h otlwr, and the conclusion may still be correct. If,
ill the ahove t'aS(', ll1e man had llbt only thought that it is
H'\·cnty-two miles frorn Tunplcton to Boston, but had thought
that l'ix i~ contained in SC\'cntJ·lwo just ltn timt'~, Ius conclu·

the doctrine of free ager1cy. exrept that Gud Almighty will
damn men to all eternity if they don't do so and 100, and that a
miln may do as he please11, choo~es, or ha~ a" mmd to." As
to the first, I never heard God Almighty say that ht> should

a matter ofjudgment whether he ever did.• Now I have no
doubt but that he will do so, if he said he should ; but I

he never did any thing without a cau11e-never did any thing

though not as o!J~iously absurd, as fo 11ay that a man has con·
trol over his o~ginal organization-ali to say a male might
have been born a female, or might have gro.vn to be a female
after he was born, the power being within himself, and the
Jaws of nature being subject to such power.
"A man has no absolute control over his dE'sires, and none

su(·h that he thinks o\·cr) all the bad con@t>qut:nces of goiug,
such as diseat'f', self. r~proar h, loss of character, loss ofmouer,
perhaps of life-he thinks how probable it is that some of
these evils will at1end his goin~ ; and on the whole, airhough
his desire to go to said house be grt'at, his desire to avoid the
conseque~tcet~ ofgoing ijl 111tll greater, and so, iu:stead of curb·
iug or coutrollit:g his del'ire£1, he only acts Agreeable to the
strongest, as e' ery body else does; for such is the law of vo·

to the que;;tioA. (iden,., which are of cot1r>1e dispo!:ed to run
together, for inasmuch as they relate to the suhjed they are
related to each other,) occur, one after another. And if, by
conrpar ing id,as the schoolml'n mel4n hnving ideas ocrur in
tlose tucetsaion, there is f!Ome truth in the espresl'ion; but if
they do not mean this, we must contiitue to say, that they talk
nonl'ense, until they shf'w Ull, distinctly, what they do mean.
From what has been said, it appears, that those who talk
about a judging, a rea~oning, a guessing, or an intuitive '' prin-
ciple." meaning by aut:h principle, ~otnt•thing t4Uperatlded to
that whtch thinks, talk about that which hat~ no existence.
When any thing is reported to.an assembly ofmen, 11ome may
think the report is true, and some that it is not. In sul'h case it
would he no uncommon way of speaking, to say thai each man
forms his opinion, by comparing the report with his former
knowledge; and dtlfereut men form ditfcrent opinion!', because
they tHe men of different knowlt'dge. Such language as this,
though figurative, is not absurd, it means something. Suppose
that Asa report& that Ben, of Cotk, has murdered Davtd of
that place. One man thinks this report is true; because he
knows that such reports are l{ellt'rally true; because he has
been told that Ben~ the murdt·rer, is a \'icion~ drunken fdlow
and very quarrelseme ; because he has bt•en lt-d to believe
that Asa, the reporter, wtll not lie or tell marvellous thinga
merely to exc.ite notice, &c. &c. But auother man thmks
the report is false ; because he knows that Asa is a liar; he·
cau~e he kuows that Ben, notwithstanding "hat has been !laid
of him. is a )Jeaccable and sober man ; bt•cau:te he has
lately been at Cork, is well acquainted there, and knows of
no such inhabitant in town as David.
In the abuve ca~e, it may be said that the men compare
what they bear with what they know, (it matters not whether

they hue been taught falsely or truly, it is len!"" to them,)
and being men of different knowledge,' they come to differ-
ent conclusions. But this comparing consists in nothing other
than thinking over one thought after another.
But '!hen men on bearing the 1ame statementtl, conclude,
some ofthem. that tbe thing statt·d is false, and others that it
is true, it would be unmeaning, or at least, unphilosophical,
to say that they do so because they are men ofdifferen_t "judg·
ments." It would, also, be incorrect to say that they come
to different conclusions on thinking over the same faols or
data.
In the first place, a man's 11 judgment'' can mean nothing
other tban his opinion, belief, or conclusion; and to say that
men believe differently1 Or hllVf! different opinions COliCeI nil\{
. any mattu, because they are men of different jud~ments,
would be as nonrensical as to say that they have diffcr<'nt
opinions; because they have different opinions. As to saying
they form din~reut conc.lusions from the toame data, thit! is
false ; unless we usc the word data in a certain restricted
sense :-tht-y do not come to different conclusions on think•
ing over the same thoughts. It must never be forgotten, that
the statements narrated to any oue in any story or bit ofnews,
arc very far from being all that such one thinks of in case he
judge whether the main stor.) be true or false. Every impor·
tant (.Onsideration, relative to the subject, is likely to occur;
and every thing which has any bearing upon the subjet.t, aud
which the ju:Jger thinks of, may, in the broad sense of the
word, be considered as data to suchjudger. We believe th.t
aU men, on thinking the same thoughts, on thiuking of the
88me facts, always come to the same conclusion.
We have said that judging consists in thinking orevery thing
which rP.Jate11 to the snhject, in a connected order ; but we
would be understood, that this is important to c.orrect judg·
Digitized by GoogIe
.ing. Whot>ver comes to a conclusion in tM!I way, will nevet
entertain a d1ffcrent, unless falsehoods have been or shllll be
imposed on him for facts. We, are far. from saying that a
man cannot jud~e con~erning any question unless he b~ ac·
quainted with all the facts of importance that relate to the
quc:itioo. But we would say that the more any man knows
concerning any question, the more likely is his opinion con-
cerning this question to be correct. When a man thinks of
every thing he knows concerning any q•Jestion, in a clear and
uninterruptE'd order, he judges as well as he ever can con·
c:erning this question, until he knows more relative to it.
It may be asked if men generally think of every particular
fact that relates to a question, before they t•ome to have that
consciousne&s which we call a belief, opinion, conclusion, or
conviction, concerning this question-before they fed a con-
viction that the negative or affirmative uf. such queatioo it
true ? We ans\\·er, no.
Men often ft·el satisfied aa to the truth or falsity of any thine
stated to them, the mornent they hear it; and it is too fre·
qnently the case that they utter their opinion, and blindly in•
aist on its being correct, before they have been at the pains of
thinking over every thing that relatea to it. The reason they
feel ~atisfied so instantly, i11 thi11: they have previously thought
ofmany facts relative to the subject, and in this way have ar-
rived to certain conclusions ; these conclusion!! they, o(
course, hold to be true; (for this is .only saying in other
words, that they arrive to such conclusions ;) they hold them
as principles by which the truth of other sayings are to be
tested ; and to test them they have only to think them in con·
nexion with such principles. If the sayings agree wit,h these
principles, they are immediately senaible of it, on tliinking of
them in connt!xion with the principles ; so if they disagree,
tbey are immediately sensible of it. For illllitratioa: 1tiJ

A6ain. It may he asked. if a man's conclusion may not be
c:orrect, if, while he is lhiukiug on~r ~he facts that relate to a
question, he chance to thiuk, here and there, many thoughts
which a·re foreign to the qncstion? We an"wer, •~o; but it
will be said, how often docs it happ~o that while a man is
judging he is intcrruptcJ hy qu~stions and the like, which ex·
cite thoughts fort·ign to the subject under comideration; and
)et the man arri\·e to a correct conclusion! All this we grant,
but the truth i11, after bf'ing interrupted in his cogitations, the
man begins anew, aud thinks all the particular fitcts over again,
or else he haJ. prc\·ious to bl'iug interruph•d, summed up, as
it were, all the~e particulars into a few minor conclu!ions, so
that after, he ha~ only to thi11k of these conclusions in one sm·
. gle and'uuinlerrnpted glance, to .come to the same conctu~ioo
that he would if he had not been interrupted. Hence a mao
m<~y cog•tate half an hour upon some que$(ion and not come

tains a sorplu!! orword~;;) at this instllnt he may be intf'rrupt-
ed, and afterwards come to a final juJgmeJ.It, in five minutes.
It appears to uo; 11retty clear that in order to judge correctly
concerning any subject, a man must thmk of every thing that
has any important beariug on the subject, in one single, and
uninterruph•d train, or elsE> he mu&t have the numerous indi-
vidual fnchl summed up into mi•.or l·ouclu~ions, a11d must !hi11k
over these conclusions in a like uninterrupted succt>Rsion.
Were it uot IIPCel'Eary to think evf'ry imp01 taut thought or
fact, then a man rmght be ig11orant of alii important fact, ~nd
yet form just a~ corrccl a conclu,-ion; and if he could do Uais,
we should, indeed, t~ease to call the fact important, as it re·
spt'cls the conclusion. We are led to thiuk that all the im•
portant partkular fact~ (or their t'quivalent!') con.:erning any
subject, or question, must occur iu an uuintl'rrupted order to
constitute a jud~ing process, not only from finding (t>o far as
we can detf.'rmine by "turning our thoughts inw'\rd") that
this is what takell place in us when we judge; but from the
following con!liderations.
Fin;t. That whicl1 th1nk" can think but one thought at a
time, and if a man be caused to stop in the middle of a train
of thoughts relative to a question, and to thiuk 'omething
quate foreigu to this question ; then Ius train is divided into
two parts; one part of which is past and gone, and lhe other
part of which is still to comt>. Now if the first part, or some
conclusion arrivt:d at by thinking o,·er the 6r:~t part, do not
again recur in connexion with the latter; it seems to us as
though the man's conclusion mtJst be the same all if the first
part had never occurred at all-mu~t be the same as if the
man were eo ignorant as not to know the facts which he
thought of in the first part of the train.
Secoud. If we grant, as we do, that what is called a judg-
ing or reasoning proceas 1s u11fcreu\ from "bat is ordtnarily

-,....I
going on in o.ur beads; it would puzzle us exceedingly to tell"
what this ditft:rence consists in, if we did not say it consists in
thinking over every thing related to the subject concerning
•hu b wejudge, in a connected order. To think ofeYery thing
in a disconnected order, would not constitute a judging; if it
•·ould, one might think ofone thing relative to a certain aub-
jt·rt ltJ·day, ofanother thing to-morrow, and soon, until in the
course of a week or fortnight be may have thought of every
thing relative to the !lubject, and then be said to have judged
concerning it; although he may have not th~augbt of two thiop
relative the subject, in conoexion.
Third. If a man, while reading a book, think o( this, that,
and the other thing which does not.relate to the subject be·
fore him, be does not obtain the author's meaning, and io or·
de•· to do this. must read the page or sentence over again.
What is ntr.cssary to constitute a good judger ? Several
thin~s are neccs~ary to conetitute a good judger. We will
nollce three or four• .
Fir!it. It is neccss11ry that the brain be a moderately active
on~; thAt is, a brain in which one action, or one thought,
proves thE' occasion of another which is pretty nearly related
f,) it ; and not a brain which thinks one thought after another,
"ioirh thoughts bear only very alight and unimportant reJa.
tt•)•ts lo earh other. If the brain be too active, or, to speak
fi~11rately, if the suggettinx principle be too active, thoughts
nr:-liable to occur when the man is judging, whi<.h bear only
...a.e o:1ttr.ure and unimporlant relation to each other. Sucb
a '1rain, iustead of thinking oYer in a connected order, all
t:.n:.t:!;hts that h:we any important bearing upon the questioo
u.ult:r consideration, would ekip off, as it were, to some other
eul~jcct ; h('uce incongraous thoughts would, here and there,
be popping iuto exi$tence, dividing tbe trne judging train into

a clear and distin~:t vit-w of a aubjcet.-Jnstead of not thi._
iog enoogh. such a brain thinks too much.
On the other hand, if the brain be not active enougb, ma-
ny important thoughts may not occur, although these tboughtt.
be such as have before occurred in the same brain ; and on
this account the conclusion may be as different from what it
otherwise would have been, as a chemical compound from
what it would have been, had many elemellts entered into it,
which did not.-Wits have very active brains ; reasoners,
moderately active ones ; and blockhe:rds, very dull brains.
Second. To be a good judger, it is necessary that the brain!
~r nlore strictly, the sensorium, possess such tendencies that,
on tlle occasion, it will think all, or at least a great proportion
of the thought" that have any bearing upon the subject judg·
ed of. In other words, knowledge is necessar1 to a good
judger. _It is a bad thing to hllve the sensorium possess false
teodencies-tendc~ucies to think of things differently from
1rhat they actually are in nature ; as if, for instance, one had
been taught, and ofcourse had tendencies to think, what we
would express by these words: Gtmporockr, ifsown, unll
tome up and bear a nea crop ofgunptntJder.
Third. It is necessary that the sensorial tend~:ncies be suf-
ficiently strong to become operative on the occasion. The
sensorium 1nay be well orpnized-may be tlaltcrally active
enough. and may posse11s a good number of tendencies ; but
ow10g to its having acted but few times, these tendeocie11 may

in dotng whirh we shall give our views of thfl nature of this
prt:iudice. Suppo~e tht" pa!l~ion of love to have been excited
iu a man hy a lady of fine acco:nplishments, and in whose
company he has er~joyed m:tny pleasurable emotions-sup-
P"~'e him now to travel unto some distant laud, aud there it:e
a similar looking lady, of whose character he knows nothing:
this lady, owing to the disposition of his s~nsorium to act io
connexion those actions which are rt>lated, re-cxritf'!l many
ofthose plf'a!lnrable emotion~ which th(> man experienced
while in company with the other lady. He would, on this ac-
count, he f~tvorably disposed toward:> her ; and if he were
now told of any crime wh•ch ~he had done, he would nol 10
rt:adily believe it, or, at least, if he did belic\·e it. (as he
would if he thought over the !lame thoughts as others who be-
lieved it,) he would look upon it, as we may say. with a for-
givi~rg temper-he would think whether or uo l'ht were not
placed under peculiar circum~tanre~. And acted from better
motives thAn is generally suppo!led. Th•• det·d would not ap-
peAr so hcinoufo to h•m-would not ex.-ite such a lively sense
of disapprohation as though she had never awaken(•d a••Y
pleasurable emotions in him. The rea~on i~ thi~ : even now
tlu~ thoughts ofthe evil dt·cd arf' mingled with the pleasurable
emotions, so that what he now experiences is not plt:asurable
emotions, purely, nor purely a sense of di~approbat10n.
When a man will uot hear or read arguments again!t doc·
trines whirh he believes, or when convinced of hi~ errors, he
will not own it; we would not speak so favorably of him a1
to say he i!l prP.judiced; we would say he· ii a wilful old hy-

and which has 110 long been in familiar use, ~hat we cannot

CHAPTER XVIII.
On Beliif• .
Before we attempt to define belie(, or rather, be(ore we at-
tempt to show what takes place in a man711 head whEn he it
said to belitvc; we must say a little conceruing the meaninc
of certain other words and ~xpres!lions.
We consider the expres~ions- TQ think-to think lhoughta

as ~ynonimou~ expres.,ion~, or so nearly ~ynonimous that we

their head~ about it. And we hold that lo think, meaus the

kuows, that we cous1der a lhougln, and a couacieut action of

the senaorium, as one and the same thing. By inconf!rtli)UI
thoughts, (an cxpres~ioo we shall soon have occa~ion to use)
we mean such thoughts as we should ex11ress by what we call-
ed, contrary terms or statements. P('ter testHies that John
Ktmdall was at his house last Saturdny evening at eight o'-
clock; Goodell l<'stifies that he lives twenty miles from Pc•
ter's and that said John Kendall was at his house last ~atur·
day evening at eight o'clock, and that he sto}t:d there all night.
These two evidences excite in us, iur:ongruous thoughts-
their te~;timonies are in<.ongru<.us, and tht·y are incongruous
evidenr.es.
There are two species of belief, sensorial or rational belief,
and nervous or sentient belief.
Rational belief is that consciousness which f!xists when a
•
man thinks over congruous thoughts or te!>limonies. H the
thoughts be perfe<.tly cougruou3-be all bearing one way,
the belief may be said to be of the highest degree; but if
there be any disagreement, or incongruity betw~cn one's
thoiJght~, relative to a particular subject or que~tion, his be·
Jief relative to thh• subject or question, will be of a lowe•· de-
gree. Jf the evidence;; for and against any question exactly
. counterbalance each other there is no bt>lief &s to this q11es·
tion-the man does not fu.l any con'J1ictim•, as the expref!lion
itt, that an affirmative or a negative answer to this questior.
would be tl1e true on~.
Now comes the rub.-
We lay down the following positions as indisput11hle :-th:tt
whatever thinks. can think but one thought at a time--that a
~' thought is an act of that which thinks-and that putting a11ide
sen!llltions,consciousness dOf'!l not exist when tlutt "·hich think&
is in11ctive. Hence it follows, that when a man thinks he is
not con!lcions, and when he is conscious he does not thi11k, or
else, that, to thiok, aud to be c.onaciou!, are oue.aud the same

ous, and calculated to puzzle the philosopher and deceive
tho~<e who " take words for things and suppose that names in
books signify real entities in nature." No one, we think, can
ht-sitate, for a moment, which to eay-he will say that to thiuk
is to be con$«;ious.
Thus much we have said, that the r.eader may the better
understand and admit what we are about to &B) concerninc
belief. We do not suppose that the word belief signifiel' any
particular act of that which thinks-any act which alwit}'l
occurs when a mlln bcltevea, let him belie,·e what he may ;
but we suppose that, TO TRiNK ova:a co~oauous THOUGHTS,
IS TO B-.:Lt&V£. Henc-e a man may have as ·many belief~ al
he may think over tntins of congruous thoughts, rclative to
the innumerable subjects and questions with which mankind
are concerned.
A man can have no idea of belief, except of the word ibelf,
nor can he say that whP.n he believes he always nperiencea
some particular feeling or conaciousness. But this he can
say, to believe a thihg and not to believe it, are ltot one and
the same thing; and this is pretty much nil he can say about
it, 1f be be no metaphisiculn. If he turn hit thoughts inward,
and attempt to satisfy him~elf by observation, 'li1Mt it i1, to be·
lieve, be gets no satisfaction-he cannot find that any thing
more or less takes place within, than ideas of objects, sounds,
tlavors, &c. one after another. It is not an easy matter to
determine by direct observation what constitutes believing.
Every man woul<\ always believe the shortest statement that
can be made concerning any thing, if this statement contained
within itself no contradiction, and if the statement ,did not
suggest any -further thoughts relative to the same thing. If a
man should step in, and say to me, thert i1 a CotD in your gar·
clen, I should certainly beli~ve bim if notbiD& furlber should

.ry instant I heu him, and may this in!tant start to drive ht-r
out; but tbe next instant some thought may occur to me,
9bich is inconsistent with this atatement, and this instant my
belief is weakened if not destroyed. If I think that my gar·
den is so fenced that no cow can get into it except through the
«ate, that I wasjust now in my garden, looked all over it, aud
there was no cow in it then, and that when I came out I lock-
ed the only gat~, put, and still have, the key in my pocket ; I
10ay even believe in a high degree, that there is no cow iu my
sarden, 80 turn about and come back.
The reason why we believe that four and four are eight,
and that the three angles of-a triangle are equal to two right
angles, il becau11c we think oter no incongruous thoughts con-
cerning the11e things. It is universally agreed that the name
of that sum which is equal to twice four, ~hall be eight ; but
auppose that a child were told by oue, that four and four are
eleven, by another that four and four are six, and by a third
that four and four are eight; would he believe that four a11d
four are eight? Surely he would, as the· expression is, har;e
doubll about it.
If two men should tell him that fotir and four are six to one
that tells him that four and four are eight, he would, other

of the word right-arrgle, some saying it is an angle of 80 de-

that the thr~e angles of a triangle are equal to two ril{ht oo-
gltt. It is true that this dit~pute and uncertainty about !he
meaning of one or more word!l, would ~ot alter the absolute
nature or relation of angles; but it would cause some to make
statements concerning them which others would not believe.
Disputt'ii and disJgreements give rise to ttllCtrlainty; by
which term we mean a low degree of belif'f, or even ntutral·
ity of opinion.--When a man is neuter as to his opinion con·
terning any question, it is common to hear him 11ay, •·I
acarcely know what to believe about the mattt>r."
Our intuitit~e belief of, or relative to, mathematical axioms,
is owing to the universality of agreemt>nl among men all to
the meaning of the terms of the matht>maticalsrienr.es, ancl .
to the unchangeableness. t~f the relations between nnmbt'rs,
an~les, &c. in themttelves considered. If t~elve cubic inch
blorks, placed side by side, extt>ud a certam distance, whicb
distance we call a foot, the same number of like block11, pia·
ced in like m~tnner, will always extt:nd the same di11tance ;
whether w'e do or do not use the same word to deuote this
distance, and the sam~ word to denote this number of blockd.
Hence we say tbe rel~tion between thrs distance and this
number of blocks, is unalterable. But the relations between
rna,.y things in nature suffer changes, some of which arc un.
known, and others of which we have no terms to express;
and moTe than this, when speaking of these relations, differ-
ent men often use differt>nt terms to express the same ideas

1"hr reason why every body believes that the 11ame ant~ce·

ed hy the same conseqnent!l, is because they never knew like
antecedents be followed hy unlike consequents, under the
aame circnm11tance~. Had men frequently, or even once,
eecn a candle continue to burn. when dipped into water, they
would afterwards,. on being asked if they believe that a can·
die will be extingui~hed when dipped into water, think that
tlu!y have !lE'en it'continue to bum in such case ; consequent·
ly tht·ir belief that it will be extingui11hed, would not be of
th£> hi~hc8l de~ree.-h•stead of thinking over congruoUII

be e~prP~se~ thulf : Candles M'lle been extinguished by dip-
ping into water-candles M'De noa been extinguished by dip·
pi.;~ i!•lo water.
&ppol!e that a man· haa found by his own experience, u
well as ~ y the tE'!il irnony ofothers, that a candle just all fre·
qut>-ntly continut-s to burr• when dipped into water, as to go
out. he would ha\'c no ~elief, oue way or the other, about the
q•11·~tion- Will this candle go out if I dip it into water ? He

Should a man have learnt that candles more frequently go
out when dipped info water than otherwise, he would have
1ome degree o~ behef that a candle will now go o11t if dipped
into the water; and this degree would be bEllow firm convic·
tion, in proportion to the number or times that (a& be bae

ly (as he bat~leamt) that a candle continues to burn when
dipped into water, the less would be his belief that a c~tndle
\viii go out on being dipped into water.-Tbe events which
take place within the skull occur according to law and order,
as much as those that occur without; and every man, learn·
ed or unlearned, would say so, if he could but think ho"ID he
thinks at tbe same time he thinks-he would find that in the
ikull the same au(ecedc.ntt; are always followed by the sam~
conacquents1 under the same circum~tances.
A man's bflicf depend~ as mUt:h oo the fact~ which are told,
or which occur to him-depends as much on the thoughts
which he thinks, as the properties of a chemical compound
depend oo the kinds and proportions of elemf'nts that enter
ioto it ; and'lll a neutral salt may be rendered decidedly a~id,
or de~idedly alkaline, by the additaon ofa.little more acid, or
a little more alkali. so a man being opinion neuter, as to any
q•re!'ltion, for instance, •• Is the body ofl\lorgan found?" may,
by a httle newspaper report, be made to believe one thing to·
day and by an opposrt~ report be m~~:de to·belie!'e the coa·
trary to·morrow. And we may here add,~ ptau'a belief is
nothmgtl•stinct from the thoughts which he thinks, any more
than the properties of a body are aomething distinct from such
body. As these properties constilute the body, 110 do the
thoughts whirh one thmks constitute his belief-to thi11k over
congruom; thoughts is to belit•ve. Yet our language, in ~Jpite
of our teeth, conveys the !!entimcnt that t.'u proptrlies OF abo-
dy are Fomethin" dito~iinct from, or something besides lht body
itstlf; and that a man's belid" or CIIIICltuion concerning auy

port as readily as be believes his own senses. Several fllcta
co to prove this statement.
If.·owing to diseAse, any sense have deceived " man a few
times, (which deception a "ane man discovers by the aid or
his other senses, and by a judging proce11s.) he does not.im·
plicitly cr•:dit :hili sense; he would sooner beline the testi•
mony of his frtends. If, in a mall who has been a few times
dt•ceived by his eyes, a candle should excite the same ac.tions
that two c~tndles do in a healthy man, he would 11ay :-" It
seems to me. that there are two candles, but l am not certain,
my eyes sometime• deceive me."
Wbcn men see objects, a mountnin, for instance, which ap-
pear but five miles olf. th.:y do not have a high degree of be·
lief that they !'fe but five miles otf, because they know that
by measurement, o~iects have often beeu found to be farlhl'r
off' than the eye tefit•fies them to be. A medicine or an arti•
c.le of food may taste bitter to a sick man ; but ifhis attend·
ants tdl him that it is not, in its nature, bitter, he belien~s
that it is not, even if it be aomething that he never tasted o€
while in health. For he believes, or by arcument can be
made to believe, that an article of tood or medicine may taste
bitter to a 11ick man, though it doea n'ot to others. The11e
facts, and some others that might be adduced, tend to show
that the reason why a man so readily belie'Dts hu senres, as the
expression is, is because they so seldom testify falsely, so ael-
clom contradict each other, in proportion to the number of
times that they agree.
As a !ense may testify falsely, it may be asked how w~ can
know that all our senses do not, at all times, testify falsely ;
bow w• can know that any of the exter11al objects re•lly e'·

mony.is suc.h that no man can disbelieve them if he would,
any m~re than water can ·run up bill.-No one can alter the
immutable laws of belief.
Lest the reader should (ail Q( .;<>tting our precise notions
concerning sen~itive belief. bein~ deceived by the expression,

goes on in the head. This remark- we consider important,
and wish it might be remembered ; for it is langnage which
got into use in days of ignorance, that, more than any thing
eiRe, canses men to think that something very mysterious
goes on within the skull. 'fhe time will come, however,
when it will be geuerally admitted, that nothing more or lea
occurs, than conscient actions which are, or have bun exci-
ted by impressions upon the senses,-speaking with reference
to the conscient or intellectual phenomena only.
From what has been advanced in this work, thus far, we
see tbat a man i:s 11u more.culpnhle or meritorious for believ•
ing whatever be doe11 believe, than water is for running down
hill. Every thing takes place according to the immutable
laws of nature, and whatever thinks, is as much uuder the
control of these lawe, as water or any thing else. And we
may here observe, that nothing is more absurd and abuflive,
Dothing more clearly indicates a want of penetration, or ll
Darrow, selfi11h. sectarian spirit, and disregard for truth, than
to eoodemo any ooe for his belit.:f. It is absurJ, because a

man's beliefcannot be altered exr.ept hy facts and argumt'nfs;
degrading epithets, u~friendly treatment, or appaling threats,
caut.ot change a man's belief-the laws of bdrefwill not ad-
mit of it. It is ahu~i\'c, because it i~ puni,.hing a man for
what he does not do with evil intentions, when such punish·
ment can have no good effect. It indicates a want ofpene-
tration, for any one who knows that no events take place
without cause~, (and who don't know this ?) m~st be lihort·
sighted indeed, not to 1.1ec that one event Ill nec.e3!1arily takes
place as another, whether it or.cur within or without the hu·
man skull ; and that one man is no morP to blame for his be-
lirf, whatever it may he, than another. It indi1·ales a narrow,
!'lelfi~h, sectarian Fpirit, and disregard for truth, becau!.le we
never see it in well informed men, who do not so much care
what truth is. as to kmno what it is.
But although we say it is ab~urd and abu!live to ('ondemn ll
man for his opinions, we do not !Ia)' it is so to·applaud or
condemn a man for hrs good or bad deeds. The reason is
obvious : By applauding or condemniRg rnen for their deeds,
you may greatly influence their cot.duct ;-this apph1ud•ng
and condemning are links in the chain of cau!"es which regu-
late human actions ; but facts and arguments are the only ef-
fl!ctual weapons with which you can attack a man's opiuions;
and no other ever ought to be u~ed for the purfl()se.-Lct ev-

CHAPTER XIX~
On Kn,.,/edgt.
A' we freqttently hear a mnn'• knowledtre tpoken.of aa
though it were something distinct from wh11t stands up in hit
library-so~ething which he carries abcM in his head ; and
as no one that we know of, hall ever clearly defined the
word, we have concluded to give the word a place in our met•
aphyaical vocabulary, and devote a abort chapter to the coo•
sideaation of it.
All the ~nsorial tendencies possec;sed by one man consti•
tute the man's knowledge. The word does not signify all the
tendencies that ever have nisted in what is called the •amt
man; for in time some of·the •~n~orial tendencies uudoubt·
edly become entirely extinct, and the man can no more think
those thoughts which these tendencies once enabled him to
think, than ifthese tendencies had never been produced ; he
is therefore as ignorant, perhap1, concerning the things to
which these lost tendencies related, as if he had never learnt
any thing aho•at them. We eay perhap1, because a man may
Jose part of hi11 knowled~e concerning a particular subject
or event, but not the whole of it, and ofcourse not be as ig·
morant concerning such subject or event, as though he bad
ne\'er learnt any thing concerning it. On t~e other hand, a
man':~ knowled~e comprehends all his sensorial tendenciea
that do exist, even if eome of these tendencies do not become
opel'lltive, do not giYe rise to action or thought, on a desired
or.caFion. Thus a man may wi11h to think, or think oj, anoth·
er man's name, hut cannot at the time, and still he may be
sa•d to know the m11n's name, 11ince there still exists a tf'n-
tleucy of bi11 sensorium to think it, u will be proved, about•

be think it on another occasion, without having teea it os
beard it spoken, from the tilDe he wiahed to mink it, to the
time he does think it.
Every diffeaent impre!'sion may excite a different action ia
one's nerve_s and brain, producing, ofcourse, a new &ellsorial
tendency, mort> or lese strong. Hence there are, as it were,
no limits to the knowledge whkh a man may acquire, for the
Dumber of differeut impressions that may be made upou his
tenses is infinite. Nor is this ali.-
We ma-y divi~e the sensorial tendencies into two classes;
one class comprehending the tendencies to act individual ac..
tiona, or, ifyou pleatoe, to think individual thoughts; the other
claas comprehending te;1dencies to think tbeae thought& in
certain orden;-to think them over, one after another. ac..
cording to rertain relationnvbi(.h ~ay subaiet between them.
'fbe first class of tendencies are all produced by impressions
upon the tenses ; the others, more or less of them, may arise
from mere cogitation. Hence there is a certain kind of
knowledge which the sen;~oriurn may be said to acquire by its
own exeruse, without the immed1ate agency of nerves. The
first tendencies may be called primiti11e ltndtnciu, or tendm"
eiufrom imprti1iom; the •econd, •erondary, or relali'De It,...
dencu1, or tmd1nciu from cogitation. The reader already
knows that t!1e first sort of tendencies give rise to tmae ac•.
tions which constitute what we call idecu. Mauy ofthe secoo•
dary tendencies are tendencies to think over in conne;t:ion,
certain congruou1 idea11, constitutmg what may, properly
enough, be callf!d a nnlimtnt•

. By an obs<'rvation made in two or three separate places in
this work, the reader might learn, if his own efforts did not
convince him, that it is not a very easy matter for me to de-
termiue what are my own ideas that gf':nerally occur, when I

For S<'Vt:ral dayI', whenevqr I chanced to think ofit, I have bf'en

ideas whieh I find I have when I endt>avor to determine what
ideas C!>nstitute the sentiment, that calomel and opium u:ill
ture inflammation.• But the same fact may be expressed in
other words, as follows :-A man has a red, swollen, painfu.
f.tce, foul tongne, quick pulse-in short, an infiammation of the
fac.e ; the physician gives bim calomel and opium; tbeae aymp·
toms disarpear-such instances frequently happen-if no
medicine be given it bas been found that such in6ammations
generally termir.ate fatally. All this it mucb as to say, calo-
mel and opium cure injlam11Wtions, and to think over these
facts, is to think that calomel and opium cure inflammations.
But why does this thinking constitute a lulitf that calomelnnd
opium cure infiammations? It ia because the thoughts are
congruous-they are not connected with other thoughts that
would be expressed by contrary tcnns-the man does not
think of any fact opposed to the fact or proposition, that calo-
mel and opium cure injlamma4ion. It is true, he may think o(
patients that died with inftammation, who took calomel and
opium; but this is not opposed to the propositioR that, calo-
mel and opium cure inflammation-it is only oppot~ed to the
position that calomel and opium ai11Ja!JS cure intla~mation, a
position which no man believes.
There may be some disagrel'ment among men about the
use of the word stntiment ;-some may use it in such a broad
sense as to include all the grand ultimate conclusions to
which a man may arrive ; but it would be -:onveuient if there

oonclusions or principle~, whicb occur to an old, learned
thinker when he is said to generalize.
Knowledge, then, is oftwo kinds, primitive and sec.ondary.
The first is acquired by the direct exercise of the senses ;
the secondary arises from tltat exercise of the sensorium to
which primitive knowledge gives rise•
. The more we investigate the intellectual ph..enomena, the
more firmly are we convinced that the mystery which is so
generally supposed to hang about them, is chiefty owing to the
language to which false notions long ago gave rise, and which,
more or less of it, we are still under the necessity of using.-
We speak ofa man's belief, faith, judgments, sentiments, con·
elusions, doctrines and principle~, which words are in them·
selves as different from e11ch othf'r, as the words stone and
slcam ; and one can scarcely believe that, so far as it re-
spects any thing which txists or goes on in the head, all the&e
words mean one and tlte same thing. When we speak ahout
comparing ideas, and distinguishing differences between them,
one is natyrally led to suppose that we mean something more
than merdy having thest> tdeas occur in immediate succession.
When we say a man substitutes an idea uf one thing for an
idea of another, one would not suppose that this s•tbstituting
consists in nothing other tha~ in having an idt'a of one tlliug,
in connexion with an idea of the name of another thing•
.Arid when we say A man believes the testimony of his sen~es,
who at first though!, would suppose that, to have perceptions,
means as mucl1 ? But let the reader lay aside all language
and, diHegarding the speculations of other~, consider what
goes on in his own head. He will fi11d, that, putting aside
perceptions and sensations, nothing more at any time 'orcurs
than ideas ofobjects (among which are wntten words) sounds
flavors, odors, and feeling~. one after another.
What of mystery concerning the intellectual phenomena,
:l75
is not owing to our present bad language, is owing to our be·
ing unable to observe what goes on in ua, when we remember,
judge, &c. at the very instant we remember or judge : all
things without continue to exist the same, when we ·examine
them, as when we do not examine them; but the moment a
man undertakes to examine a judging process, that very mo·
ment does the judging process cease, or go on differently
from what it does when a man is not paying attention to it.
It is not mysteriou11 that sensibility should arise from the or•
ganic union of insensible atome, or that a sensation or per·
ception should be excited in the nervous system when it
possesses sensability. If it be, then every thing in nature
is mysterious ; it ia mysterious that acadaty should arise from
the chemical union of non-acid atoms, and that a. liquid pos-
sessing the property of acidity should change a vegetable
blue color to red ; and mysh:rious tbat one bGdy shout•
move an other by impulse;
CHAPTER XX.
On Ptrsonalldentity.
The word, identity means sam~ntu; and the term, pertor&•
al identity, means s11me person. But almo11t every body io
nature is continually suffering some kind of change : a piece
of gold wrapped in dry paper and laid away in a tight box is
continually undergoing a change ofrelation with the heanoly
bodies, and with every thing that moves upon the face of the
globe. When even an individual particle of matter is added
too or taken from any body, such body sufl'era a chaoge,-it
suffers a change even when a few of ita own parti,lea change

their relations with each other. It follows, then, that there
are but few if any bodies in existenr.e to day, which are, in
the most strict and absolute sense of the term, the I'ITM bod-
ies thllt exitated yesterday. But notwith:1tanding this, men
&ay olbodies that exist to day, they are the 1ame bodies which
existed five, ten, fifty or an hundred yt...· rs ago, unless these
bodies have undergone very great, perhaps we may say, total
changes. Therefore when we inquire w;..:ther a body which
exists to day, be the same body which exisrcd yesterday, we
do not so mur.h regard the changes which it may have under-
gone !ince yesterday, as the ch11nges whic:._ it has not under-
gone ; and yet men have n"t agreed what changes any body
must not undergo, that it may tatill be called the same bod.v.
~ Bu~ it will generally be adm•tted that John Jrown who is the
first son of a certain Caleb Brown, is the same man that was
called John Brown and that bore thi• pecu.Jiar relation to •aid
Caleb Brown ten years ago, let him have undergone what
ch11nges he may since that time. If this be ~ ~milled, it fol-
low•, that all that is necesssary, m order that a man who exists
to day may be to the rDorld around the same man that exi$led
ten yeara ago, is, that he be known to the world a1ound, as the
man who bore a certain peculiar relation to sontething else,
ten years ago,-a re-lation which no other being but this
could or ever can bear to this same something elt\e.
But the grand question, relative to personal identity, about
Which philosophers have been so much puzzled,. is not what
tonstitutes the sa·me man to the world around : there is no
more difficulty about this than there is about what constitutes
the satne tree, house, or jacknife. The grand question is,
what constitutes the same man as it respects himself-what
tonstitntP.s the rame TliiNkiNG man ? By which we mean
tnuch the same that Professor Brown does by "M'ENTAL idtn·
lily." We answer at once :-Jhe same 1emorial tcnd11"iu.

lethe proof is clear. Take from my brain or sensorium Ita
e. '4resent tendencies, an.d I should think not at all ; hut give it
~e tendencies of John Brown's brain, and I tohould then
a:::t.ink, believe, remember, judge, imagine, &c. J>recisely as
rtr.fohn Brown now does t1r may think, believe, &c. I should
lmbelieve that ·my name ill:fohn Brown, myfather's narne is Ca·

doio short, I should thft-Jk of every thing, and believe ever1
:thin-g, just as John J"'own now thinks aud belie\·e~. or may
.· behcve; and nothing ia more clear than thRt ll'hould be John
.· Brown, so far as it respects the thinking man, to all inteuta
and purposes. 1
Suppose, now, that John Brown knows tne, my family, my
. boll6e, &c. and 11uppose that I receivl', not his tendelt.~if's, but
tendencies precisely like his, while abed and a~>leep at home:
when I awake, I tr''gin to thmk precisely as tho other John
Brown would bad he been broug~ in his slevp and put in my
place. t should, on looking around, think that I had slt'pt
very soundly, a'hd that while 11le~-ping, some trickish fellow
had taken me out of my [John Brown'~] hou11e, and put me
to bed in C. K's house along with his wife. I t~hould lau~h
at the trick, hnt retaining my [C. K'i!.] present looks, thia
wife would wonder what I was laughing at. I !!hf)uld enter
il)to such convP.rsation with her, that she would be satistied
that I was either crazy, or el11e had a p~ruliRr fitculty·oftalk·
ing as thot~gh I Wf're somebody besides C. K. But I, on the
other hand, should be surprised that 'lhe !lhould take ·1ne to
be C. K. and not John Brown. She emgh~, pet·hapt~, Sa) to
me : look in the glas!, aud you will see thMt )"OU are the same
C. K. that you was yesterday. Should I then look iu the

Digitized by GoogIe
278
that my looks h!ld undergone such a change that I now look
precisely like C. K.; (for by suppo11ition, John Brown knows
how I [C. K.] look ; but notwithstanding this, the world
could no more convince m"' that I am not John Brown, tbaa
it (·an uow conviucc me that I am not Charles Knowlton. I
, should klloW that I nm Johu Brown, every thing elee to the
contraty notwithstanding. I should &oon be making towards 1
my home, frorn whence I was brought, {by some supernatural
power, proh>tbly, !IIDCe nothing short o{ such could have~
changed my look!!,) and if, on arriving there, the ether Joha
Brown should he at home, a warm contention would sooa
arise about 'rights and propert) ; I should own to him that he
looks just as I drd before rny looks were changed, but tell him
that I drd not expect be would think to claim my wife, my
children, and my property, on this ~tccount. Some might
c;on"idcr me cra?.y in rest•ect to this one thing,-taking my·
srlf to be John Brown,-·although I might appear as rational
in ~very other re~pec.t, as any other man ; but many, (iftbey
were irnm~terialists,) and especially tbe other John Brown,
would take me to be Charles Knowlton, inhabited by anotlur
ruprrmdural sr·rRrT; for this John Brown would find that I
could tell him of every place he ever had been in, of every
deed he had ever done, Rnd of every thought and intention of
hrs '' heart," ju~t as well as be could tell them himself.-1
e,·en doubt if he would not give up his whole estate to me, if
J in~ist9d on his doing &o, as I probably should, kno11>ing that it
all helonged to me.
B•tt if 'tother John Brown, instead of retainiOK his old FeD·
sorial tendencies, should loose them all, and receive C. K's
on the sRmelnight that C. K. receives his, then the oew John
Brown on going to hu hom(·, would probably meet tile
arew C. K. going to his home,-both equally astonished at

~o changed. The world would take both to be insane, but
both would be as confident that they art not, as any man is
that he is not insane ; and there would be no conlentiona
between them, about property and privileges.
Let us suppose that I, Charles Knowlton, not only swop
sensorial tendencies with John Brown, but that my body be
so remodelled as to look precisely like John Brown, and John
Brown so remodelled as to look like me. I should then be
coove.-tcd into John Brown, and the present John Brown
would become Charles Knowlton, not only as it respects the
thinking man, but as it respects the world around, or the world's
man. Hence we sec that the particles ofmatter which com-
po~e a man, have nothing to do with his identity, in any im·
portant sense of the term; and at the day ofresurrection, or
rather of reor;;:tnizatiou, it will m:.tter not what particles of
matter we ihall be co:nposed of, any more than it now c.on·
tt>rns us whether our bodies are composed of the matter of
the bread, meat, butter and cheese ofVP.rmont, or of the fi~h,
rice, and fruits of a south.ern climate. All that will be neces·
sary to constitute the same man, to all intenb and purpo11es,
will be to have the same looking body organized out ofany
m<ttter, possessing the same sensorial tendencies.
As a man may undergo great changes io his looks, and still
be the same man to the world around, so m.-y he undergo
great changes in his sen,oori.al tentlencie!, and still be the
same mau to himself ;-he m:t1 forgPt m•teh, (outgrow many
tendencies] and he m·ty learn rnuch, (acq•1ire many new ten·
dencies,] aull still know, believe, or be conscious that he is
the 4;uneman.
We would not undertake to determine what tendencies
m11~t be retained in order to give ri11e to those thought3 which
ton~tit•Jte one's belief that he is the same man ; we think,
huw~:ver, Lhat they are very few ; perhaps no more tbu
Digitized by GoogIe
280
enough to give ri~~e to a remembering of his name, of hi• pa-
rents, and of some one thing that he has done.
It may he askE'd, if it be not naturally possible for two per-
eons to acqr1ire preci~ely the same tendencies, and ofcourse
be precisety alike as it respects themt~elves. We answer, no.
)f two children be organized preci11ely alike, and born at the
same time and place, and called by the same name, it would
be impo~ible for them to acquire the same sensorial tenden-
cie~ ; for they could not btJth be in the eame place, and in the
same relation to each other and things around at all times;
hence. preci~ely the s11me impre£osions could not be made
upon their ttenses at the same time, and merely on this ac·
count, they may in time berome quite difft·rt'nt men as it re·
spPct!l the mggtsting principle, wlli•:h term llhiuk I may now
U~t'. without ht~lllg mJ!iUilder~tood.
After all that we have said nhout sensorial tendencies, it
m11y h~ Mid that their existence is purely hypothetical. We
grant it.-•o is the diur011l re\·olut.ion of the earth hypotheti-
cal. WP. arc not immediately conscious of any motion of
the earth ; b•1t the suppo"ition th:tt it does move euables us
to explain many ~tstronomical phenomena; and the supposi·
tion of the !ICn!lorial tendencies enables us to explain many
phy~iolo~ical or conscient phenomena; and there is nothing
oppMed to either suppo!'ition. There is a great <t.fference be-
twcf'n a ;;n,lposition which enables us to explain many phe·
nomP.na, and one which afford!! no such aid, but on the con·
trary renders MJch pht'nornena ten times more complicated,
mysterious, and inromprehent~ihle. If such suppoEition be
not directly contradicted hy any one fact, still it is contradict-
ed,-it i!'! contradicted hy the simplicity of nature, and the

1pecu1atiQnS of prof<Jssor Brown concerni"ng personal identi·
ty ; or as he choo,;es to term it, mental identity. He admits
that the upreeaion, same man, is generally considered to
mean something more than same mind ; he say11, however,
but little coneernin~ corporeal identity, or the identity of a·
man to the world around ; but he writes about fifty, full, oc·
tavo pages to establish his notiona concerning mental iJcnti·
ty : a fact which, of itself, argnes much llg:ainst his o'piniont.
His most important positions couceruiug mental. identity, are
the two following:- ·
Firt~t. Mental identity consisll in the "unity and sameness
of that which thinks and Ieels," independent ofall the eudle!ls
variety of its transient state!l or ~hanges-independent of all
thoughts and sensations.* Second. A man'8 btliifthat he
is the same man, "arises from a laTD ofthought," which law
is'' a principle of intuitive belief ;-as it were, an internal
never-ceasing voice from the Creator and preserver ·of our
being--an internal rt>velation from on high,-too important
to be left to the casual discovery of reasora."!! l
We see that according to professor Brown, personal, or
mental identity, consista in that which makes no difference
between men-in that which (if it exi~t) is the same in all
men, for aught any one can eay to the contrary. He places
it in an indivisible, unextended (no-) thing; fur such is what he
means by " that whu,h thin.k1 andjeels;"-he places it in such
thing. indeJlendeot ofall the 1tutu it may chance to be in, in-
dependent of all thought&, feeling~, and belief~. Hence it fol·

ton that I now am! This is what I say would he tht· case, ae•
cording to professor Brown's do(:trine ; for the t~ame mind
(the thing in which he places my identity) \\·hich he toupp~
to have bef:n iu me, when an infant, and when &Jit'ep, "·ould
still be in me, and constitute the V('ry me, my~elf.
Concerning Profe11sor Brown's second position, that "The ·
"6tliifof identity of self, as the one permanent subject o( the
·transient feehngs remembered by us, ari!les from a lo"' of
thought," it appear!! unnere!'sary to say much.
I presume it will he admitted that a law of thonght is a law
ofnature, and a univcftlal law ; hut I m11y observe that there
i• no law of thoqght in me, whil-h gives me to" the beliefof
the identity of self, 118 one pt>rmauwt t!Ubject of the transient
feelings remembered by me." To be sure, I belteve that I
am the 1amt man that did a certain act, felt a certain pain,
er came to a certain conclusion, at !lome former period ; but
I believe it, in the rommon t~ent~e ofthe word same-in that
sense in which I u~e it, when I say,-the horse in my t:table
is the 1ame that I bought four Jt-ars ago. I do not 1-H!Iieve
that I am one ptrmantnt ~uhject of the thoughlll and actiont,
said to be the thoughts and action11 of Charles Knowhon.-
By the pronoun!! /, mt, and my•e'J. I always mean that vi!li·
ble, extended being('alled Charlefl Knowlton. I never hne,

ef. tfo•Jr presf'nt bad Jangua~e som,.timec Jeaves me under
the neceiiSity of using th~ pronouns I, myself, &c. as though
they meant something distinct from the Charles Knowlton bo·
dy, ~thll I do not mea~ so.· Neither do I h~ve reference to my
sensorium, any more than any other part of my body, uules~ 1
specify this part, or ~peak in particular reference to it.-
Wnen in common conversation, I say I walked to Troy, I do
not meAu, more especially, that my legs walked to Troy;
and when I say I think, I do not mean, more especially, my
1en:~orium .thinks, unle11s I am upon some metaphysical sub-
ject. But although, by the pronouns I, me, and myself, (
mean an elllended being, still, if a part of thts being &hould
be remored, the part which retained the sensorium would
&till call ilst'lf, /, my•elf, &c. What more convenient language
could it use ? Now I believe that the being ulled Charles ·
Knowlton, that is, I, myself, is, like every thin~ el•e in nature,
contmually undergoing changes, and is not a pl!rmanmt !ub-
ject. But until we have a different language, and until I have
ditferent &eusorial tendencies: I shall continue to call myself,
and believe myself to be,•the 1ame Charles Knowlton that
did ~f!rtain things ten years ago.-Certaiu teadencies ofmy
sensorium give rise to such thoughts as.eonstitute such belief;
but wh!J, in any ease, con~ruous thoughts occurring together
constitute a belief, I can as well tell, and no better, as I can
why oxygen and hydrogen chemically united iu certain pro·
portio.na, constitute water. You may say that such is a law
of thought, or a law of nature, or, what is the llame thing, that
it as one of those ultimate and universal facts, of which there
ia no explanation to be giv~n, aod ofwbicb none but the iguoo-
rant will ask for ao explanation.
Now when Brown saya that a mao's belie( of his identity
arises from A LAW oF THOUGHT, and 1a!J' no more than thi1,
we do not objecl to the esprejsiou; but it it the aawe law eC

are equo~l to eight ; that a candle will cease to burn whf'n
you d1p it into water; the ~11me law of thought, from whu·h
arises a lower de!!ree of ·hf'licf that tht·re wtll be some !!now
next winter, and from which ari~es a still lower degref' of be-
lief, that we Phall ha\'c some rain within three weeks. There
is not a particular law of belief for cvt-ry p:trticular belid
which we have-there is but one law of ht'licf: those belief,
called intuitive are such as they are, ht-caul'e they cousist of
thoughts that :uc perfecii!J congruous; there is not a fingle
contradictory thought united with them ; they relate to things
. concerning which there is not the least contradiction ofany
kind.
We may further remark, concerning Profellsor Brown's
speculatioi1s, that, accordirrg to Ius test of idcutity, ice and
taloric are precisely the same thing as the steam made out of
lhis ice and caloric ; and certain bodics of oxygen, hydro-
ge!l, atad sulphur, arc the same thing a!l the oil of vitriol that
may aftt·rwards be made out of !h(·m, tht-y being the !lame
suh~tauce rxistiu~ in a diffcrent 11tate. So. too, a ball of wax,

No one will think to ohject to our doctrine of identity, by·
aaying we place it in something which cloea not permaue~ttly
remain the same absolutely. To say thi11, would oo"o speak
in commendation of it, since we know that the inner, or think·

l~Juguage, so as not to be dccei'ved hy slu·h as the writer mKy
be under the nece~sity of using. He musl hal-e corn:ct no-
tions of cause and etfect,-he must remember that a cause
is nothing more than an event which is immtdi.ately aud int:CJ•
riably followed by a certain othf;r ~vent, undu the same cir-
cumt<tanct-~,-and indeed we often U3e the word when it can-
not be said to mean so rriurh lUI this, unle~s we give the word
et~mt, a broader meai1ing than "an agent acli11g ;"-but he
must not suppose that the succeeding r.vt'nl never does and
never can occ.ur, except it be immediately preceded by one
and the same event :-The body A may sh 1ke the bodJ B,
and thi~ body may move a certain distanc.e in a Ct'r1ain di·
rection. This is an event caused (immediately preceded)
by the stroke of tht~ body, A; but the body X may be brought
pretty near the body B, and by attraction cause it to rno"e
the same di,dance and in the same direction that it dtd wht'n
impulsed by the body A. Here then, are two /ike events, or
the 1ame event occurring twice, from ditfereut caut~ea. It is
necessary, also, thd the rt>ader be aware, that it is ju" .as
natural for matter to act. be it in what state it may, as itlk
for it not to act ;-that, being at rest, it never moves qr acts
without caufle, and being in action, it never rests or ceases
to act without cause. An internal action going on in any
organ, no more ceases to so on without some cause for its ceas·
ing, than a cannon ball c·eases to move without a cause, after
being forced from the mouth of a cannon :-some change,
some wear and tear, mu3t take place in the organ, from its
own action ; or some alteration in the kind and quantity of
fiuids Jlowing to and from the organ, mu!lt take place ; or

the laffli ofn11ture, be followed· by a cessation of the attioll.
which ceases.
In treating of the relation between the nervous and museu·
lar systems, we come to the condusion· that the immediate
antect•dcnt or cause of voluntary contractions, is a~1 action
commencing in the br.tin and exten•ling along the nerves into
the voluntary muscles. Thi1 action of the nen·ous system is
an u11con•crous action, and we call it the motille action of tbe
nervous sya~tem.
We are of opini011 that this :.ctio~ does not commence in
the sensorinm, or that part of the brain in which conscient
actions occur; but in a contiguous part-perhap~ in the ce-
rebral extremities of nervous fibrils, of a differ.ent organization
than those which take on conscient act1ons ; and is excited,
ea11sed, or more properly, is immediately preceded by certain
conscient actions of the sensorium, just as any other efft:ct is
immediatt!ty preceded by its cause.
The relation between the con11cient actions ofthe t~ensori·
om, and the motive actions of the brain, may be jJiustrated
by the relation which tmbsistA between a master and hisser-
vant. 'fhe master and the servant ~ay act independent of
each other ; yet when the master commands, do tmr-do tlaat
-go on-slop, the servant obf'ys ; b~t the master is not con·
·trolled by the servqnt. So the conscit.-nt aa.d motive action•
may even commmce. and continue, independent of each oth-
er; yet the motive actions (unlestt they are unruly, as in epi·
lepsy, tetanus, &c.) commence, vary, and slop at the com-
mand of the con~cietJt actions ; that is. they commence, vary,
and stop, according to those conscient actions of the senso·
rium_which oc~ur. But the motive actions do not f{OVtm

or law, tbat_ when 1111cb aod auch motive actions occur, iuch

been exerted by the consrient actions, m11y continue to go on
as at fir~t, indtpendenl of the conscier.t actions, until varied or
atopped by the couscient action!!, or until some change, some
wear and tear, takes place in the brain, ·inconsistent with
tht>ir further corttinuanre, at which time a man may desire to
move ever.so murh. but he canuot.

some relation between them, we say that the. thought whic.b
·precedes, is the ur.cnsion ofthe thought whJ(:t, succet•ds. With
.re11pe~:t to the motive actions, we cannot, in few word!', 11how
distinctly what we mean, when we say tl1at they occur on
occasions : we must suppose a cas.--Suppo!>e that I have
performed a dozen difft•rent actions in immediate !ltlcccssioo,
a thousand times or more ; now if a desire excite that motive
action of the brain that corrcspondt~ to the fir11t ofthis dozt:>o
actions, and then I think of something quite foreign to tbe!e
action!!, the remaining eleven ,may I!fill follow ; and if ~o. we
should say that one motive action of the brain ii the occcuion
•f that other which immediately succeeds it.
When we say that one thought, or oue motivl' action ofthe
brain, i£ the occallion of another, we do not mean that sucb
thoughts and such actions are not, as truly and as really, cau-
ses of the thoughts and actions which tlttcceed them, as im·
pressions upon the sens~s are caust-s of sent~ations and per-
ceptions. But these causes or antecedents are diff~rent from
the antecedents ofthelie thoughts and aclions, thr first timt or
times thf!J occurred; on this account, and for somul's t-ake,
we call tht'm occasions. Indeed, considering the notions gcn·
erally annexed to the word ctzuse, and to the word occati~~n,
we think it would alway& be more correct to say that one
e\ent IS the occasion of another, than to l!ay that one e\'Cilt it
the cause ofanother.

at the trnth in this w~ty, oor experimenting only s,erv~ to
confirm us iu error. But let a man who is trudging onward,
musing on his wordly plots, stop of a sudJen, and think whe·
ther he have been willing, det~iring, or thinking something re·
latave to, every !ltep which he h11s taken for m•lell·back.
It would' be absurd to say that he has, but was not consciou1
orat at the time, for to will is lntt to think, .and to think is to
be conscious-to say that a tnan wills or de11ires any thing,
and ts not conscious of it at the time, is a downright contra•
daction. And as for saJing that a man wills e\'ery stl'p whicb
he takt>s, whtle thiukiug of something quite foreign to hi1 _
walking, hut cannot afterwards remembt'r it, it would be say•
iug something which no man can ever prove to be true. but.
wh.ch we have the fuJiowmg good reasoua for bdteviug to bf
false.
First. It is strange indeed, if r.ertain thoughts or com•cient .
actions do occur several thou8and times wilhin an hour ot
two, and canuot recur at the end of th•s time, liO cpm.ected
"ith other thoughts, as altogf't,her !o constitute a remember·
ing that these certam thought:! havt occured within this time-
strauge. I say, since it so often happens that a con!'Cient ac•
tion of the sc:nsorHJm, hav111g occurred two or three times to-
tlay, may recur a wet.k hence without impression.
Seco.•d. When couscient actions do actually excite motiv•
ones, we can remember it ;-we must add, 1ometime1, aod not
add alzoay•,-lest tt be said that we l)pg the que!tion. But
this every man w11l own, wht>n he performs any new or un· ·
commou act, or e\'en when he quickens his pace while walk&
iog, he can afterwards remember that he thought something ·
about it-that he willed it, aud well may he wonder that he
cannot remember that he willed baa moat common actions, if

plain a(rd sati~factory; but rf the man also have a de!'ire to

clmni<~lll force, or unttl he have a greater desire to do ~orne­
thing el~e, tl11m to do what he is doing. If a man have a de-
arr·e to do oue thing. and a desire to do another thing, both
which things he cannot do, or cannot do at the same time,
he ads agreeable to the predominant de>~ire ; but if the two
dc,rr·es <•xact ly rqual, cotmlet·balartce, or neutralize each other,
lu· ads ~tcrordirog to r:c~llhcr, f'J:cept one ofthe desires be to

but uot superior to the force by which it .is attracted to the

have thoughts and of course, a thinking part, but we have
no evidence at all, that we have any willing part, besides the
thinking part; we c:tnnot discover in any of our v:illings that
we have any thing besides sensations and thoughts. And if
,imple truth had preceded complicated error, and we had
nev~r heard any thing about the ..:»ill" and the many other
pomer1 andfuculties ofthe Soul, (all thingless, and the aecond
and third very ambiguous names,) we never should have
thought any thing, more or less. about volition than this :-
on the occurrence of certain 11ensations and thoughts, or CP.r-
tai n thoughts alone, certain motions of the body immediately
follow. ·
As we maintain that not more than one aensorial desire
ean exist in the same man, at one and the same iMtant, nod
·as it is clear, that, in this instant, the desire which dGes exist,
cannot be equalled or counterbalanced by an oppos~te de-
sire; it may be asked why, the moment a man bas any de-
sire to do a thini, the motive actions ofthe brain do not set in
and the man start to do this thing ?
In answer to this q••estion, we offer the following corJec-
ture: We suppose that thoughts succeed thoughts, a little
more quickly than motive actions succeed thoughts. Hence,
jfconscient actions, constitutang a de&Jre, be immediately iUC•
·eeeded by such as cnostitute an opposite desire, there is no
time f?r the motive actions to set in so as to give rise to mus-
eular contractions ; but 1f one de&ire be not immediattlf/suc-
ceeded by an oppo&ing tho11ght, the motive actions do set in.
But we know from what we have e1perienced in ourselves,
that after a man has set out to do a thing, a "second thought"
aometimes stops him quicker than a cannon ball would do• .
Difl'erE:nt desires give rise to different motions ; this will be

state an ultimate fact, or law of nature, or volition, and none
but those who disbelieve this, will talk about e:s:plraining it..
We Jon't hear any one talk about explaining laws of nature :
to explain her phenomena, is to c:s:plaio every tbiug to be ex-
plained. The Deity himself cannot explain a law of nature
in the seode in which the word explain ought to be used by
men.
When two ditfert>nt desires which are ~nctly equtal, imme-
cliately succeed each other, the mao may be said to be choice·
neuter, but when tbere be but one desire, or when one desire
is more than equalled by another, he may be said to be
choice-absolule.
A man seldom remains cbeice-neuter for any len&th of
time ; for as the semorium is continually thinking, some
thought is apt to occur, which ia sutlicient to turn the scale,
already on the balance: when this is doDe, the mao is choice·
absolute, and the moti\·e actions set in.
Ninety-nine times out of a hundr('d, the thought which
turn.& the scale, or the desire which gives rise to action, when
not counteracted by an opposinc thou~ht, is 10 triBin;,• that
one can 'hardly 11ay what induced him to do so and so, and
will very readily say, '' I might have done otherwise if I llad
had a mind to." This we grant, objecting only to the lan-
~uage used. If'the conscient actions of his sensorium had
been different, his actions would have bet:n different ; but aa
it was, his actions were as much necessary consequents of
t~eir antecedents, 81 other effects are' necessary cou•equeola
of their antecedent!!.

interest 'in chokio' truth, may talk and scribble, the fact it at
stubborn and unalterable as the Iaws of nature, that whatPver
a man has done-, he could not otherwise than do, and his do-
ing so, is absolute proof that he, ae he was, under all the cir·
cumstances of the case, could not do otherwif'e than he did~
If a man do not do a thing, it is proved that he might not,
nay, could not do this thing at the time.-To say that a man
might have done s& and so, if be had desired, chose, or bad a
" mimi to," is to say nothing at all in favor of the doctrine oC
free agency, or against the doctrine of necessity. So may
water run up hill, ifsufficient force be given it,-so may gun-
powder not explode on the application of a spark, ifit be
well drenched·witb water; nay, water must run up hill, and
gunpowder cannot es:pl9de, under these circumstances. lo
all cases where the antecedents are ditferent, the consequent•
not only may, but must, be different; for such are the laws
of nature.
The sequences ofnature are linked together, if we may use
a figurative expression, by an indissoluble bond : the same
antecedents must, under the same circumstances, be foliowe~
by the same consequents ; and every individual act or event,
whether it occur without Of' within the human skull, is the
consequent of an antecedent, or in older language, th~ etfect
of a cause. It is one of the links in the chain of events that
constitute the phenomena of nature~
We hardly know what to .•ay of a man who admits that
there are no events without causes ; that a cause is that
which must, from the nature of thingt, be followed by ao ef-
fect ; and then says that man is a free agent. He might as
well admit that hoo limes and twice are aynooymous termtt,-
that twice four are equal to eight, and tbenaay that two times
four are not equal to eight.

you cannot help believi,ng it. Toe laws of belief are the
same with you as with me ; you may uot own that you be-

to argue against it ; but to a~sert, or to argue, is not to bt:lieve
or disbelieve, But how do yon know that the state of soci-
ety would be worse than it now is-how do you know that
there would be ·le;s human happiness, or more human mise-
ry in the world, than there now il', ifthe doctrine of necessity
should be universally believed ? Have you any rea~on to sup·
pose that a general knowledge of truth will incrca~e the sum

brctins might be a little more phlegmatick. Dafferent aud
more effectual inducements would be held forth for men to do
good, and refrain from doing evil ;-if any one did societ} an

Perhaps there is no other subj~ct under heaven, concern-
ing which men ~o gehtrally enttrtain erroneous views, '
whirh views may so easily be shown to be erroneous, as they

such general use, that it is better, for the present, to u~e it,
than to invent a substitute, we permit you to u~e it. But we
must ask you what causes the will [the fact!) to act? We
suppose you will grant that every willing is an act of that
which wills ; but there are no events without causes, no gaps
in the great chain of events, and we do not see but that you
must suppose another will, to cause your old one to act, and
so go on, ~upposing wills, one atop of another: until you get
to heaven, the Great First Source of all events ! !
Immcilerialist.-1 must confess this is rather difficult ground
to maintain-more so than I ever be fo1e th-ought. I have

to believe differently from his lleighbor:', that I never dreamt

We.-To be sure, this is not so absurrl a!! to say, afact cau-

which have no being; but the question before ns doPs not re-
late altogether to the fitness of expressions : the main ques·

thought which DOES orcllt", must uot as neccs•nrily occur, a1
pain·must follow the application of a red hot iron to the skin
of a living· and healthy man ; in short, whether it be, or be
not, the effect of a cause ? And to establillh $UCh free ageocr,
we should as soon have thought ofyour rt'ferring to any other
at1thority as to t~at of Brown. Although Brown wa1
not a profe~sed materialist nor necessarir.n, he bas done
more, perhap!, than any other one man towards establishing
materialism and other important truths. Locke did cons1d·
erahle, by banishing the world of innate ideas. Every tflan
who dispels any of the metaphysical darkness of the schools,
furthers the cau!<e of materialism, wht>ther he designs to or
not. But to the point. It must he grauted, that accordinc

Now, where are you ! A certain state of the mind (ll state
which constitutes a desire, mill, or toilling,) is immediatel1
succeeded by a certain other state, constituting a thought ;
but what caused tl1e mind to exist in the fin I state ?-oo
evc:nts without causes-no gaps in the everla~ttlng chain o£

to be es:ercised in the prt'sent case ;-we may rea11oo away
all the exslted seotimeuts concerning human nature, and
make a man a mere organized machine, who is no more abso•
lutely culpable for any thing he does, in the eyes of his Maker,
than a cotton factory ; destro.) ing, thus, the fundAmental prin-
ciples of that wholesome morality which is productive of so
much human--happinl'ss, I know that when I am deter-
minP.d to think of any subject, I can and do think of it, and
when 1choose to think of t<ome other subject, I can [do]

He ttays that when he is determined to, or choose• to thinlt
of any !lubject, he can [does] think ef such subject ; and that
this is all he means by saying bis thought~ are under the coo·
trol of his will. But if this be all he mean, we admit that his
thoughts are under the control of his will ; and it argues .ex-
actly as much in favor of man's free agency, and ~onst'qbt'nt­
ly against the doctrine o( necessity, as to say, that wheri fire
is applied to gunpowder, tbe gunpowtier can [does] explode.
Let us say, for instance, that a man is determined to think of
heaven. This lang~•age suffers nothing in 11en11e by rendf'r·
ing it thus :-the man think!l he will think ofor about heaven.
But i~ there no cause for his thinking he will think thus? If
be cast b<t('k a little, he will find that these thoughts were
prer.eded by f)ther thoughts, in some way or other, related to
them, and th~se, again, hy others, and so on. He will see
that, considering his sensorial tendencit's and the laws o(
thought. every thought which does in him occur, must as ne-
ce!lsarily occur, as an unconfined body must move when
itruck by a heavier body sw•ftly moving• .
A man having got so far as to think he will think of heaven,
alrtady thinks of hea\"en ; and as all thoughts relative to
heaven are relate4 to each other, Wf' ~hould expect, according
to the principle9 which ·we havr. said regulate the succession
of thoughts, that he would thirak more about heaven, than
merely to think he will think of heaven,..
We see that it argues nothing to say a man may think as
be plt!a~es. choo~es, or" has a mintf to;" and besides, the
expression is very nonllensical, a~ omr.h so as to say, a man
may think as he thinks ; for to please, choose, or hue·a mind

Why, if a man may will his thoughts, doea he not alway1
think of a man's name when he wi- desire!o it? If you do
think of a man's uame on a desired occasion, it oc~urs to you
in this way: Swne ideas, more or less remotely related to the
idea of the man's name. are, in some way or other, cawed 1o
occur ;-the fact that you desire to think ofhis name, i1 proof
that some such ideas ha\·e occurred : the dt~ire, as it is cal·
led, conliists of some such ideas; and as idt'as that are related
are apt to suf!gest each other, it is clear on what principle the
idea of the man's name occurs to you.
But why all this talk to prove that the actions ofthat which
thinks, arc not controlled hy-the ac.tions ofthat ~hi•:h thin.ke,
when it may be done by one short argument ? The very ex-
pression, will a thnu8ht implies a contradiction. Who ca11
will a thmg until he have ao idea of what to will ? But the
instant a man have an idea of what thought to will, that vc'1
instant is tbe thought already present-it has occurred accor-
ding to the principles whaob we have mentioned in several
parts of this work.
We must here be permitted to offer a few remarks, which,
howcYer, relate more f>articularly to what we have said in the
fore part of this chapter, tban to what we havejust been ad•
vancing.
We have said, that on the occurrence ofcertain conscient
actions of the sensorium, certain motive actions of the brain
and nerves immediately set in, and certain muscular contrac•
tiona immediately follow. 1'be11e <:Oillcient actioo1 Wfll 'aJl

aeaires, mf'rely to distinguish them from conseient action!! of
tbe sensorium that are not immediately tmcceeded by mot1ve
actions. In doing thi!l, howenr, we use tht• word desire, in
a sense somewhat peculiar, for there may or may not be, that
·consciousness which is ge11erally called desi•·e. These de-
airt:s we call thovghts, also,· for we call every conscient,ac-
tioo of the 1.1emorium alone, a thought. Should the reader
ask why we do not usc the word 'lllill in the instancf's in whi('h
we use the word de~ire, we answer, because we fear the con·
1equences of using this word ; we think it would be more apt
to suggeat erroneous notions than the word desire.
Perhaps the reader may find more dilfculty than we do in
admitting that it is a thought which, through the medium of
the motive actions o(the nervous system, gi-.·es rise to volun-
tary contractions. If he do, it is hecause be does not bave
the same notion of a thought that we do : he may own that a
J»i/ling fiUI:'poec~ con~dousness, but does not feel right in call·
ing il a lhot~ght, or thinking; 110d for this very good reason,
he'calls it a tDilling and ner has done so. But he must re-
·member that, in many cases, words which are quite ditfcrent
in them11elves mean the same thing in reality.
• If a man would have just such notions as we do, concern-
ing thoughts or idea!', and concerning volition ; he must pnt
aside all preconceited notions ; must look right into a man's
head, and there s•.·e the Feusorium ncar the centre of the brain,
with nerves running op to it frorn all puts of the hody, and
11ee it acting one action after auother, (c.alling each one
of tht:se action11, a thought or ide~a) and Ff'e that when a

We may, perhaps be told, that, notwithstandingAIJ we have
said, the existence ofthe motive actions of the nervous sys·

are not immediately sensible oftheir existence-they are not
ol~ects of1ense ; but the liaurnal revolution of the earth is

CHAPTER XXII.
On the Pcusions.
The pas11ions consist ofthoughts and natural sen~atione, not
immediately excited by agents exterior to the body. Some
o(them consist of conl'cient actions that commence in the
nerves and extend te the sensorium, otheN const!lt of con•
scient actions that commt>nce in the seusorium and t>xtcud
down the nervefl. The former we propose to denomiuate
the organic pa~~ions ; the latter, the stusorial passions.

sations, nut oecaust we auppose lht:ie is any thin& in nalure

\fllich ia not. 11trictly ttpP.aking, truly nalut:~l ; but to exclude
from our deliuition of the passions, alllho!<e t<entlations wbftb
arille from mo,·bid states of the system. as the tooth-ache, tht
belly·Ache, the pain of ~he gout, &c. &c.
The definition of passion, which we have given, i11, we
think more philosophically correct than any other that c·aa
be given. The ·only objection to 1t. is, the word hAS not gen·
eraJly been UFed in SO broad a St'll&e ; for aCCOrding lt. this
definition it may be contt>nde~ that e\·en the pains of a nat·
ural labor must he 'considered as constituting one of the organ-
ic passions, and it would require a good deal of metapbysJcal
subtlety to make it appear that they do not.
As we do not generally know.pr~cisely, by what and how,
the organic passions are excited, we shall take the libt:rty
to say they are excited .,y, or arisl' from. statu of the
organs. When the stomach contains a quant•ty of heal-
thy gastric fluid, and ·no food, it is in such state that /uua.
ger arises ;-when the organs 11ub~ervient to genention are
in a state of plenitude;, or in an irritable .t~tate, tbe venereal
passion often arises without what may be called an excitiac
CBU!'e.
The sensorial pat~sions may, also, be said to be owing to
the statu of our organs, and especially to the state of the
sensorium. The actions which coustiJute the sensorial pa'·
sions, we say, commence in the sensorium : if a mau become
angry on account of what he sees, hears, or feels, we do not
say, the anger commenced in the f!yc, ear, or shin-tbe ac-
tions oC.the optic., auditory or cutaneous nerves constitute oo
part <'fthc anger. And as no anger would arise Oil tht- oc:·
currence ofthese sensations, if the sensorium w~re destitute
oftt>odencies, it may trUIJ be said, that the sensorial passions
arfl wore especially owing to the l!ltatc of the sensorium, than
to the state of any other .Part of the system. But if it were
Digitized by GoogIe
---------
pessible-for two persons to possess sensorial tendencies pr•
cisely alike, in kind, number, strength, relation, in !!hort, in
evtry possible rc~pect ; we believe that one of these persons
might becotpe angry on seeing, hearing, or feeling, what the
other might.~ee, hear, or feel and not become .angry. We
are led to this opinion by the fact1 that the same man does
not, at different times, become angry on wt.at would be ad-
mitted to be eq1Jally vexing ; aud yet we nooot suppose this
difference of ~usct·ptihility to an~er ia owing to any change
that ltas taken place iu hi~ se1;sorial tendencies. What wouJd
vex the weary laborer at eve, he may with pa~ieoce bear,
after a recruiting night's sleep ;-what would be taken in
good humour by the mao who has just taken his dram, may
the next hour make him mad. It appears, then, that so far
as tht: sensorial passions are depending on lll.lles of our or·
gans. they are not owing altogether to the sensorial teodeo-
cielJ, though the!!e are essential to their existence; it appears, ·
also, that when the nervous system is in such state as it is, af·
lt>r exhaustion from fatigue, mu~.~cular or sensorial, or frum
high stim•Jiation, it more readily takes on such actions as
eono;titute anger, (and the same might be said ofsome othet
panions,) than at other times.
According to our views, a mao is never in a passion,. or
morl! properly, a pas:1ion is never in man, when there is no
eonscient action of a nerve. Actions of the sensorium alone,
may be more or Jell& vivid, we admit ; but when vivid, they
alotle constitute nothing tnore than what we would call vivid
thiuki11g.-A man's thoughts may be distinct and numerous,
but tb~y do not. of themselves, constitute a passion.
The organic passions are often called appetilt:s; the sen·
sorial, especiallr the fainter ones, are often called emotions.
In mo~t iulllances of the sensorial pas~ions, the nervoUI ac·
tions are confined to the nerves about the epigastrium, or that
Digitized by GoogIe
•pper and m.ddle region of the abdpmen, Wh!cn includes tbe
" ptt of the stomach ;" but in some imtaor.es, as gamestel'l
well know. the nervous actiona thrill down tbe back, even JD·
to the extrt>mities.
When any, thing is first told to us, which does not aceord
wtth what we have been in the habit of believing, it at first
appears to 01 irrational ; but on more mature consider-
ation we often think of some fact which we admit as such,
but which we must odmit to bt> £>qually ioexplicahle with the
thing told us ; this tbiug then ceases to appear so strange aocl
irratiooal as before we thought of t~ur.h fact. Men have been
so much in the habit of thinking that conscient actions com-
mence in the orgaJtic extremities of nerves, and extend to--
wards the brain, that when it is said they sometime• com-
mence in the brain and extend down the ne•·ves, it, at first
thought, seems irrational ; but wheu they consider that they
cannot explain the fact that an action commences in the or-
ganic extremitieta of nerves, and extends towards the brain,
and that theJ admit it because there are well known facts that
cannot be explained Without admitting it-because that fact1
seem to prove it ; then they more readily admit that an ac-
tion may commence in the brain and extend down a nerve.
And they will admit it, if fatt6 be adduced which appear, t•
them, to show that it is so.
Now the fact, that, on the occurrence ofthought~ relative
to one's well being, t~ensations without impressions often fol•
low, (and follow too so instantly, th~tt we must snppo&e them
the immediate con~equents of the seusorial actions,) appean
to prove that con~cient actions may commence in the brain
and run down the nt·n ·ous prolou~ations connected with it.
-It seems to be U!lclt•ss to 11ay a •Y thing 4o show that the

H:1ving shown what we mean by the pa~sionfl, Wf' now pro.
eeed to offer a few \Vords couceruiu~; some of their '.ffrcll, on
the 111di\·idual in whom they occttr. Although some have
found it eas1er to deny the existence ofa nervous lluid se<~re­
ted by the nervou~ glrrnd1, than to prove it, still its existeuce .
is admitted by most physiolo~ist~. and will we think, 'in time,
be admitted by all. Those who adm1t the rt•alit) of this !le•
cretion, will not deny that some of the pa5$ions increase, and
others diminish it. By adm1tting thi~, and admitting its use
to be what we hllve SUjlposed, in the chapter on the rehttion
between the n~rvous and muscular ~ystem~, they can find no
difficulty in showing in what way some of the passions give
rise to II flu.•hed face, a sparkling eye, a strong llfm, and an in•
crea~ed secretion of bile ; while otlwrs give rise to a pale
f.1cc, a tluttcrin~ heart, a trembling knt>e, a d1arrhrea, an ill·
creased secretion of limp1d urine, &c. &c.•
Although we suppo~e th:tt, in cases of emotion, a nervous
action exteud~ from the brain; still we are of the opinion that,
in all tho~e cases in which there is any paleness of the couute·
nance, the iensat1on in the epigastric region is in part owing
to the pressurt.· of tluid~ in this quarler. We will not stay to
adnnce aU the cousiderationa in favor of I his opinion,-only
the few following: When the fluids strilrt j), from the surface,
as indicated hy pale shrunken features, there must be an UIIU-
sual prc~sure about the heart and lung!'-a pre~surP. whir:h in
some d·sea~es is very ~reat, and undoubtedly gives ri~e to the
oppref~ivc feelin~ which medical men term anxiety. Second,
A little ·iii·Ju('k, or bad news is much more apt to produce
a disagreeable feeling about the epigal!!trium and breast when
the coutract•lity of the mu~cular S)Slern (iucludmg the capil·
laric~ of the luu:;s) 1s 110 lnw that the blood gets through the

ble, oppressive feeling which a man experiences when he
thinks of things wltich be believes \Viii (and consequently do,
at the time) diminish I. , happiness.
A!thot,t~h we hold t!t.lt n pnssiou supposes an action of a
nerve, we are not prep11r.ed to say that some conscient actions i
of the sen~or;um. alone, are not more agreeable than others- :
s&mc thoughts more agr.cr•1blc than others; but to ask, mhy! \
would bt: like a11king why o:xJgr.n i8 dilferent from hydrogen. 1
No explanation can be ~iven, and no answer can be given, ex-
cept we say. S'.Ich is the fad, sU<:h is the very nature ofthem;
or something like this. ~tt!hcr could any man tell another
what i!l an agreeable thought, if this other uever experienced
oue him~elf.
Jt has been a question why one thing please~ us, and ar10tber
di$plcallC8 US,-Wi. one thiug excites such R .COIISCiOUShetl
in us that we call f>lea~ant, or beautiful, and another thing,
that we call it Ull(lleA.;ani, homely or ugly. Now we suppose
that in some in!!lances this quc~tion i~ a very proper one, at
something of the why and whcrdorc may be said of it; but
in other instances it must be consitlcrcd as a question relative
to an ultimate fac.t; and when we arc satisfied that any thing
is an ultimate fact, it wcould be as foolisll to a&k rvhy is it ro?

-and in another man, ~uch consctouslless that he call it homely;
we must suppose that t>ither in tht' .ue ca~~e or the otht>r, the
a~reeahle or disagreeable consciousness is not an action unme-
diatcly excited, but an action suggested by means of the piece
of dress; for it is probable that all men are organized so uear
alike, that what immediately and o£ ·.;elf excites an agreeable
consciousness in one does. o;o in all, and may be said to be na·
iurally agreeable. Perhaps neither the agreeable <'Onflcious-
ness of me nor the dt!agrceablc C~Jnllt-iouliuess of the oitter
man, is an action t:rrited by 1he piece •'./dress, but in bolla

that when a man sees a like looking piece of dress, be it
where or upon whom it ma.h it etcites an action of hi~ ner·

If this piece of dress he not naturally handsome, and an-
other man have frequently seen it at the same time he has
expe'rienced unpleasant emotion!!, and seen it on!y at ~itch
times. then it will call up unpleasant emotions ir. such mi4n,
and he will say it is a homely looking thing. The fact that

As the notions of many concerning love. are rather un~atis·
factory, and the notions of 80me concerning conscitnce, 11re
rather ridir.ulou~, we ~hall dwell a little on the~e two pas·
sion~, bdore closing this chapter. And first, of Love.-We
de, not call the venert>al appetite the pas~ion of lo\·e ;-the
pa~~ion of love itt one of the !lt'nsorial pa~sious, but the pecu-
liar l.1ve of one s•·x for another, ari!les from tile \'etwreal ap·
petilf·. A man low's what he regards as a cause of happiness
in him, (and the gratification of any organic passion is so
much happiness, though often called pleasure,) and the dtf-
f•·reut ~exes may be a cause of a peculiar happiness in each
other, on account of the vener1•al appetite ; ht~nce tht> pecu-

OJ Conscitncr. It i$ an ultimate fact, or law of the ner·
vous system, that ·on the o1:cu~rrnrP of certain ro11~cicnt ac-
tions ofthe ~ensorium, certain con~cicnt actions of the nt·n·es,
immediately fullow. Thc~e actio••s of the nerve~, together
with the actic.ns of the ~cnsori•un. constitute, as "e have ~aid,
the seusorial pa~~ion~. wh1ch are ofteu rallt·d, not irnpropt·r·
ly. <>motions. The ar.tinns of the uerv<•s alom~ may bt' called

from sensations excited hy a;;P11b extf'rior to the body; retro-

tute (in part) the orgauic l'as;:ions, which !'ensations consi~t of
conscient actions tl.at run toward~, in~tcad of from, till' hrain.
What thoughts or conscient actions of the sen~orium arc
thus succeeded by intt·rnal, retrograde scnsatious, we can ~ay
no more parti<'ularlJ. than that tht·y arc thought~ whieh re·
late to the happiness or miH•ry of ou1selves or othtr •eut•t~nt
being~. All thoughts ahout futu1c misery, ht' tlus m•,:er) • X•
pected at what pe1 iod it may, are of thi!' nature. A man who
meets with a little •lllnck, or lwars a lit1lc news which caus·

debauch, a disagreeable sensation in the breast and epigadric
region. If he have been led to do any thing or even think
about doing any thing which calls up idea~ of misery-any
thing which he has been taught to believe he shall b~ punH.h-
ed for in a future state-the same kiud of sensation ari+les.
That this sensation is the same in kind a!' that which a.fl!'les
whim a man thinks of the bad conditions he expects to be in,
to-morrow, next week or next year, no one will doubt, after
paying 110 much attention to it as the pret~ent writer has done;
but if it should be granted that it it! not, it would not follow
that conscience is not as much a passion as joy.
Tqe notions entertained, or at least expres~ed, ('Onceming
conscience, are whimsical enough: It has ln:"t:n talked about,
as though it were a "divine voice" (if auy one can tell what
this is) either slipped into us about the time we wt>re begotten,
or else coming directly to us from heaven just hefore, at the
time, or soon after we do any thing which the book of nature,
or a paper book has taught us to believe we ought not to do.
And the "dictate& of conscience" [cont~cience itself] have
been talked ofas though they were "the strivings ofthe lioly
Spirit ;" hut by the by it is a spirit which, in nine cases out of
ten, a glass of grog will banish from one's stomach, until tbe
atimulating effects of the grog are over, but which will then
return, more troublesome than before, if the system be not,
in the mean time, recruited by re&t and nourishing food.
We do not maintain that the passion conscience, is no sign
that the person in whom it occurs is not a ptr,sun ofprinciple, as
the expression is, but the reverse,-it is the mo3t sure sign he
un ha\'e that he is a man ofprinciple-it is certain evidence.
But it is not the least &hadow ofevidence that his principles
are true. It is evidence only that he belie-:>t:s them to be true,
which bdief is what constitutE's him a man of principle.•-

Onlr m:tkc a child believe it wicked to whistle, that it displeasr
es God, and that he will suffer eternal, ucl·er·endiug torments
in an unqnenchable hell fire, for whistling; such child, should
he chance to whistle, would experience the same compunc·
tious feelings that many good boys now do, when in a moment
ofexcitement they incautiously swear, or take the Lord's name
in vain. Yet for an this, it might he as innocent to whistle, in
the views ofthe Almi~hty, as every body now supposes itto be.
The law of conscience is, that it arise whenever a man con·
templates an act of his which he belie~es is wrong. We
think, however that it is more intense and partakes of the ·
nature of.fear in case the man believe be shall suffer for do·
ing such act. Be this as it may, the existence of conscience
in an~· man, on a certain occasion, dt'pends on what the man
has b<'en made to belie,·e, be it truth or falsehood. And as a
mCln's belief, opinious, views, sentiments, ctr whatever you
please to call them, may undergo changes, we sec why it is
that a man may do an act at one period of his life, without
such compunctious feelings as arose at a former period, on
doing the ~;ame act. We see, too, why men of ditfereJ!t na-
tions, and different men of the same nation, do not feel re-
morse alike, on doing the sRme deeds, though they may be
m~n of a similar weak and nervous constitution.
Nevertheless, it .i~:o freely admitte(!, that what sct'ms wrong
to one, would, ifknown, very generally be p10nounccd wrong
by all men. This however 1s very easily accounted for. It

CHAPTER ·XXIII.
On Rdigion.
-The word religion, is used in q•tite d:ffcrent t~enset~. Ac·
«ording to one very comruon use of the word, religion is an
affection of the human system. In this scn~e of the word. it
~elongs to the physiologist, or, if you please, metaphysic•an,
to examine into the nature and causes of rdigiou ; and it is
the more uecet~~ary that he do so, because mo"t per.-ons. even
in this enlightened age, appear to be much in the dark con·
cerning thi,; malter. lndt>ed, th('! notions thai haTJe but& ex·
pressed concerning it, are such as to excite emotio1111 in e\'ery
well informed man. It ha~ beet~ t~itid that religion j,. can~t>d
by, or consist!! in, (we scarcely know which to say,) heing
born acairr of water and the Spirit,-an eXJift'lol~iun so ve•·y
ambiguous, that if any one totally unacqustinced with all rcli •
gious notion~. should ask if this b'ing bom again (Jf-water and

Ghange of heart; by which it is not meant, however, that he
must have his thorax opened and his natural or congenital
heart taken out, and a new one put in its place. At other
time!l, religion was spol<eu of as though it were cau~ed by, or
consisted in, certain operations of the Holy Ghost or the Spi-
Jit ofthc Lord.
• But to !!pPak truly and intelligibly, the religion of which
we are treating-often called the religion of the heart-is uo-
thing more nor les~ than .a !>ensorial passion ; that is, con-
scient actions of ner,·es preceded by couscient actions ofthe
scnsori11m as a cause. A share of the conscient actions -
of the
sensoaium which gil'e r1sc to these actions of the nerves, are
such as constitute thoughts ct>nccrning religious doctrines,
occurring in e:uch order-so free from intermixture of oppo-
sing or contradictory thoughts-as to constitute a belif!f th~t
sur.h religious dodriHC8 are true. Hence we see that a be·
lief in' religious doctrines is es~cntial to, :md indeed consti-
tutes a pari of, the religion of which we are speal{lng.
Having "hown what inward religion is, \VC proceed to treat
ofits-caus<'s and effect~.
Mankind are now too much enlightened to mistake mysti-
ficlltiiJn for explanation, or altrihute effects to supernatural
cau~es, when natural cau8e~, amply !lufficient to account for
thPm, may be pointNI out. Something like a thou!c'and years
ago, of course durin~ the dark age, it is said-howe,·cr in-
cr~dihle it may appear to men of thts enlightened age-that
men attrihuh•d the1r inward religion to special operations of
tlw 1-ioly Gho~t upon the heart! and 80me, if history be true,
en·n virtually a~sertcd that thiF B"ing-oftP.n spoken of as
though he were uothing J,.,.s than tlw Creator of the univcr~e
-r11tered thf' human !1J~tem and dwelt for a time at least. all

aud that rc!igiou:s cmoti:>us were caused by this agent. Ifan

"&\vakening'' or" revival" took place, these men of the dark
age used to attribute it to "outpourings of tbe Spirit," and
tell of the Lord paying them a special visit. But these no•
tions now remain in history as monuments ofancient igno;,
ranee, and meo are left free, so far as it respects ltgal pun-
ishments, to search out the .true causes of all known evt-nts.
Consequently they have found that inward religion is eft'eclu·
ated in the following manner.
Children are presented with books which teach them that
the first man and \Voman ate an apple or some suda thing, in
conseq••ence of which the whole human ·race are totally de·
praved. and deserve not only to earn their bread by the sweat
of their brow, to endure mu<.h misery in this life, aud the
pains of dying, but to be eternally wretched after they are
dead ! That the uuthor of nature; in his infinite goodness and
mercy, C<tuscd a child to be brought fonh bJ a wumao who
had nol known her husband-a child who, by the by, was as
old as his Father. That this chitd having become a man,
was by men unjustly executed ; but came to life again, three
days aft~r, and ascwded up into heaven, (for heaven is aboy~
us, in the day time.) That on account of these things man·
kind will not be eternally miserable after they die, merely be-
cause of the apple affair ; but still, on account of this, their
natures are so very corrupt, that is, they have such strong
passions or propensities for doing those things which they
ought not to do, and are so little disposed to do the thin~
which they ought to do, that they can[\ot or do not (it
makes no odds which,you say) refrain from doing many evil
deeds, for doing even one of which they deserve to be eter-
nally damned, and indeed will be ; unlc<Js, before they die
they are sorry for doiug such deeds ; and furthermore, pro·
fess to belive such things as we are now stating, and many oth·
ors equally rational, to be true. But if they are thus sorry,

.and fhn" profP!I•, instead of being efernaJiy wretched, they
will he eternally and most exquisrtely happy.
Alier more pains are taken to make children, and young
per~oa~ (who have not yet !Ufticient knowledge to reason r.or-
ref'tly) hdieve the thingt~, than would he llf!cessary· to cause
them to lwlit'Vt' the most romantic story that ever fmmd rt1
way into books ; many of them do .believe them in rather a
)ow degrc!e. Am! they think that after accomplishing cer· -
tain worldly ohjet·t!!, and indulging II little more in those
• thingR for wh•ch they have a wicked {but natural) propensity,
tbPy must altt>nd to the repenting part.
While tht y are in this state striving perhaps to render their
f:·llow b~:ing11 more happy, of whatever sect or denomination
they may he, they met't with one or more persons who under-
take to com•ert their mere_
,:old behefin religious doctrine•-
which is at bestliltle heltcr than mere morality-into realer-
ective religion, a religion that will move the lor.gue. For thia
purpo~e a contociou~ness a little lower down than the -brarn,
must be t·J.cited,-tlll're must be an emotion. In effecting thi~,
eome Rre more !'killed than others. The means by wh•<·b
they operate, are varrou!l, depending somewhat on circum-
tlancea;. For the mo11t part, they are w~ll calculated to ef-
fect the.ohject in view, ·though not un1formly succes~ful. If
they think lh£ir subjects are not pro1lerly prep11red for a real
gelft~r-np of n:vival11, that is, their belief in the religious doc-
trines is not of a Fuftit:iently high degree, their first object is,
thou"h a liltle out of their favorite line of busines11-to in-
crealle llU<·h belief. Th1s being done, they aim to imprus
their Huhjects with the imminent dangt·r they are in ofhlosing
their souls," and heing eteruaiiJ wrt~tcbt'd in hell fire (a ter-

one gloriou~ cause, he is not a mere thinking man, but a joy-
ful man. His breast is alive with a new passion ;-he is not
now the repenting child of sorrow,-the stage of oppreS!ioo
has pa1111ed off,-he is one of the most h<tppy beings on earth;
he tastes of paradise below. He has made his peace with
God, and prof~sses religion, (another thing to be glad of,)
he think;, that no one who has not experienced the like,
can know his joys. He thinks that nothing false or earthly
cotJld give him such bliss ; and would that all would repent
of their sins, and be a brother of his, on the Lord's side. He
is t'nlhusiastic ; and ifyou express any doubts as to the truth
of I he doctrines which he so firmly believes, and is so happy
in believing, since he has been led to believe that he shall be
infinitely happy, he pities ,-ou ;-or if you go so far as to ad-
vance arguments which bear hard against such doctrines,
may be offended at you, and even sec•·etly endeavor to in-
jure you in your lawful occupations. He is not now equally
kind· and charitable to persons of all denominations ; for
he has taken sides in a cause, in promoting whach he
believes (for so he has been taught,) be is doing God's
service; and in whicb he may have a wordly interest, and,
being !ltill human, a pride in promotiflg. Consequently those
who are·of his secl arc to be encouraged, and those who are
not, put down.
Now it is this change in one's thoughts and feelings con-
ceruing religious matters, that constitutes what is somt'times
called a "ucw birth," eometimcs ''getting religion," and at
ether~," a change of heart." ·
It is .well kuown to every one at all acquainted with the

animal economy, that the exprt-:ssion, thange of heart, aa u~ed
by religionists, is as figurative, tbou~h not quite so amoigu-
o•Js, as the expression, bom again ofwater a"d the Spirit.-
T:Je heart is a thick muscular organ, situated in the ch~st,
and containing four apartments. Its function is "to assist in
circulating the blood, by which it is excited to act. It pos·
sesse!l a much lower degree of sensibility than the ~kin, and
is never the seat of any feeling except it be in a diseased
state. Its action is often accderated during the passions,
probahly in the manner we have explained in the course of
this work ; but" it has no more to do with a man's thou;;hts
and feeling!! than his lungs ; and we have no more reason to
suppose it is ever the seat or habitation of any good or evi_l
spirit, than we have to belie\·e there arc such beings in exist-
en<"e as witches. It is less liable to change than almost any
other important or<~an. anrl P.very l'hange of it ·is a di~ease, re-
quiring medicine. ll.Jt the heart is in the neighb•Jrh,.od of
tho~;e nerves which take on con,;cient actions during the sen-
sorial passions, ani! as it is often infiuenced by these passion!!,
it is not str:mge that the ancients regarded it as the st:at of
some 'of them, as well as of good and evil spirit!',-n mil'take
which gave rise to language that is still in use with those who
prefer ambiguous to plain matter-of.fact language.
There arc some who seem to regard their religions joy
not only as the effect of some supernatural agency, b•tt even
as evidence of the divine otigin of the religious doctrines
which they believe ; but these we think are mistaken notions.
1111lecd, if every person whu firmly believes the doctrines of
the chri~tian reli~ion, who has repented of hi3 sins, and made
a profess,ou, should not be as happy as any person e\'er was,
it would be something so unnatural that no philosopher could
account fnr it. W.hat ! a mau believe that he is a sure can·

est man that ever lived is as nothing co:nj)ared w1th !ltJCh a

mMt frllntic with _joy o~ meeting with a I1Uie good luck, which
they know can be a cau~e of happineliill!! to them, but a fmt•
1hort and uncertain years ? Surely, if there benny myster1
concerning the ·religiout~ joy of penitent and professed believ•
e.-.; of the doctrines of the christian religion, it is becauie
they are not much more h•trpy than they are. We should
thiuk they would sink into perfect apathy llS to the thin~ o(

not account for their love of life, and their sorro\Yi under

as h:ive bef'n expended in the cause of christianity, since its
first introduction into the world.
One grand reason why so many believe in the christian re-
ligion, ill this ; They are not onl) taught to belie,·e it. before .
they are old enough to reason, hut they are at this tendu age
deeply impre:~sed with the idea that they ouglll to believe it,
and that they will be eternally wretclwd after they die if they
do not belie,·e it : con~cquently they think that they arc not
only justifiable, but even praiseworthy, in reading every thinq;·
that has been written in favor of it, and r~jectin~, witho•1t
reading, every thing that has been written against it. And
thii delusion is not a little encouraged in maturer years by
tho3e influential persons who have a pecuniary interest in the
cause of religion. Oo~ly let all per,ons come to the •ge of
rta~on before ·they are made acquainted with any religinua
notions more than what they draw from the book of natur~ ;
afterwards preaent them with the bible, togt'tner with all that
has been or.can be written, both for and again!'t it; and let
as many persons, under equally favorable circumstan<:es, be
employed to convince them that christianity i$ not divine,
and the general scheme of it not true, :ts there are to con·
vinct: them to the contrary ; then might the pre-ponderance
of either party be con~idt:red a~ some small evidenc.e in fa-
vor of its principles.
But when we consider how much time and treasure, aa
well as bldbd, have bee-n expt>ndad in the cause of christiani-
ty ; the smallness ot the proportion of mankind whir.h truly
believe in it, seemd to ar~ue OIIIC'h again~t itd truth and divin-

place in gratifying suc.h passion; or in other words, in what
way do the organic pas~ious give rise to muscular actions?
IR answer to the first question, we say that animals are so or-
ganized that they have no natura/appetites or pt·opensitics to
do any thing which is not'for theirgood ; and not being Jed to
d'O any thing because they judge it will be to their good, (as
they often arc after acquiring many sensorial tendencies, and
hence often do wrong, for they often judge erroneoudy,) they
seldom do any thing which is oot to their good.· ·
The second question is the most difficult to answer ; but in
OQr attempts to answer it, we may derive some aid from the.
facts, if facts they be, pointed out in the chapter on vulition.
Those organic passi<.Jns which give riae to instinctive actions
we will, for the· present, call hankerings for lomething-not
hankerings for any particular thing which the young animal
has any idea of before he have seen it-but a hankering for
something, or if you please, a hallkering. The young duck
hatched by a hen has a hankering for something, and the new-
born ca If has a hankering for something ; but suppose them
both at the side of a pond, the one with its foster-mother the
hen, the other with its natural mother a cow; the hankering of
the duck will cause it to rush into the water, while the han-
kering of the calf will cause it to lay hold of the cow's teats
and suck. Now why this difference?· Why does not the calf
rush into the water, and the duck atfcmpt to suck the cow?
lYe cannot say the duck's hankering is a desire to go i11to the
water, and that this is the reason it goes into the water; for a
desire to go into the water supposes ~~~ idea of water, but by
supposition, the cluck has no idea of water. We believe it
is an ultimate fact that whatever will gratify an inward long-
ing of a young animal, looks goctd as soon as he sees it, feels
good as soon as he feels it, and tastes good as soon he tastes
it, without having ·previously learned that it will promote
43
Digitized by GoogIe
338
its health or make it grow; and that the duck goes intq· tbe
water because its oq. ni~ssions are such that the w~ter
looks good, or seems 1.. .sirable ; and that the calf Jays hol<f: of
the cow's teats for simtlar reasons. \
But an auimal to b1.. e a hankering, and to see something
before. is"not to Jay ho. of such thing-to Jay hold suppos~s
motions, supposes m11sc '"lr contractions, supposes motive ac~
tions of the nervous 3yst.,~.~ ttQ1f what gorJtrns, as we ma,)'
say, these motive actions,o:•re they immediately anttcttltn" ~.
or cauicd by the ~onscie-< ctions that constitute the hanker- ·
ings ? or are they immcct.... ely antecedented hy the actions '
excited by the things that anpear good, desirable or inviting?
or do they set in, on the C(. existence of both these sensations?
The duck may have its h •kering for'something, but seeing
no water may stay by the 111de of its mother, the hen, which
never goes into the water ; and again, the duck having been
in the w,ater suffers such a change in its system, that for the
time being, has no such 1.. .kering, but a desire to return to
its mother on the land, an~ so goes to its mother, and doe.;
not immediately go into the water again, although it still sees
the water. Such being the facts, it would appear that in the
case of the duck, the hankering and the goodly looking thing,
have each a share in giving rise to its movements.
But it may be said that migrating birds and fish steer olf
certain courses to certain places which they never saw ; and
this too perhaps without being guided by any that hue seen
such places; and to such birds and fish these places do not
look desirable or pleasant ; for they neither see· them nor
have an idea of them. Now what causes these birds and 6sh
to steer off these courses as they do ? We suppose it is the
mere pleasurc,···the ~ere feeling of fitness or right which
they experience in doing so; and we suppose if they t•Jrn out
of these course•, they do not feet woll, do not feel right.-

suppose that a young duck hatched by a ben, on a dry plain~
wou j stee~ offsome str.iight course until it came to water,. if
its.... -ganic passions were such that it wt.,nld experience a plea-
•urable and proper feeling merely in ~ing so.
We suppose that migrating birds arid fish steer off tooth-
er r~gions at certain times o' year, oc..c:ause at such times o'
year such changes take place in theil.linward feelings, and in
the weather, that they feel better iP.doing so, than in staying
where they are. Young anu1.J • ~t from the feelings of the
nJomeot, and not from any long-h wl.lcd calculations about fu-
ture consequences; and they do .t , 1t which is right because
there is nothing to cause them to ~-> otherwise, and there are
no etfects without cause;;. ·
Men may draw some confirma·~on of what we have said
concerning instinctive phenome' l, by considering what they
experience in themselves. We ba~'P. supposed that instinctive
actions are such as the organic passions lead aoi~als to per·
form without knowing, and consequently without thinking
about or regarding, the consequt:r•as of such (,ctions; now do
not organic passions;often lead nkn to perform actions, not be·
cause they expect any future good to arise from performing
'hem, but because of the pleasure they experience in perform-
ing them ? Do they not often act without paying any regard to
or even thinking about future consequences, and even io some
cases in which they believe the future consequences;will be bad,
rather than good? Think ofthe venereal appetite. In ninety-
nine cases ofa hundred, we consider the1e movemnit1 as strictly
instinctive, and not performed because, by a chain ofrcasoning,
the man or woman has come to a conclusion that it will be to
his or her future well being. Nature apurs them on as she
does the y<'ung mammalian to suck.
Again. Does nor a man know that a lady looks pecaliarly
good, desirable, or inviting, on account of a peculiar OJianic
, Digitized by GoogIe
340
passio:t on:s ? and does be not know that when this passion it
gratified, hi' mere r;exual love i:! ~&bated ; but that it returns
again, as the passion returns? And I would put this question:
Suppose a man have been brought up to the age of 20, with·
out ever having ~een a woman or learned any thing con-
cerning one, and yet so brought up as not to fear to approach
any being. Now let him loose among women and all sorts oC
animals-let not a word be said, or an indicative motion be
made; (we will have the wo.nen naked if you please;) do you
Dot suppose the women •o1lld seem to him more agreeable,
fitting and desirable than ;.ny of the other living beings about
him? Would he not as~ociate with them, in preference to any
ofthe otheranimals? Ifyon admit these questions, why would
you oot ad~nit that water looks desirable to au untaught duck,
and that be ruFhes into it, not because he has learnt by expe-
rience that it will be to bis good, but because ofsome organic
passion? .
Ifthe immaterialists are not satiitied with our speculations
concerning instinctive phenomeua, (we do not say concern-
ing inslincl, for there is no such thing,) may they offer some-
thing better: remembering all the while, that we do not cal-
culate to be deceived by empty talk, and led to suppose that
they explain thinga when they only myslify them.

CHAPTER XXV.
Or, Sleep.
According to our views, nothing is easier than to define
sleep. It is that state of a living animal, in which no con·
scient aclions occur. Indeed, we may leave out the word
living, for in truth a dead animal is just ~o animal at all ;
and such are the s~ntiments of those who say of a man who
baa died, he no longtr txisu.
But although we can have no doubts that a sleeping st~te
is a state in which neither sensations (of cour$e not percep·
tions) or thoughts occur, •till some questions may ame con-
cerning sleep; as, does a man evN sleep? ifhe do, what cau·
ses operate in bringing him into a sleeping state ? and how do
theEe causes operate in bringing about the ultimate effect?
There are but few, perhaps not any, who will not readily
admit that they do sometimes sleep, according to our defini-
tion of tbc term ; but putting aside one's own belief about
the matter, it is not so easy to prove, by argument, that a
man ever sleeps, as some may at first think. However, he
that asserts that a man neTer slet>pi!, asserts that of wh1ch
there is not any evidence-there is nothing to favor the opin-
ion that a man never. sleeps ; his continuing 10 breathe, we
consider as no evidence of such opinion. But there arc some
con11iderations in favor of the opinion that a man often sleepE,
and they may have borne weight ~Yith those who may be dis-
posed to maintain that a man's belief that he somelnncs sleeps,
is no proof th~&t he believes <~orrectly.
It must be, and is admitted, eve~ by immaterialists. that
thinking supposes some kind of exercise of 1ht" brain ;• and
.., Abernethy, the latest medical writt'r whose love of popularity
Digitized by GoogIe
M
every studious m:~n is as sensible that this exercise \vearit:
h;~ br.1in as he i~ that walking wearies his lower limbs. lle
·Jcnow~ too, that during those hours in which he is not awake.
and in which he does uqt dream as he can remember, this wea·
rinc~s of his brain, hke the weariness of his limbs, goes olf:
but when he does dream, as he can remember, he is sel)siblt
that the weariness of his brain does not pass off, as when be
dol'S not dream. Finally' then~ is much evidence in favor.
if not absolute proof of the opinion, that a m&n often !!lccpi;
and until something more than we can now think of, can be
brought in favor of the ~pinion that a man never sleeps, it
wall be a _princtplc with us, that a man sleeps ~urin~ that time
which ~eems a perfect blank to him, and durins which be '
dreamt uot, as he can remember.
The causes of sleep are muscular, or even mere sensorial,
exercise; narcotics ; and compre!~ion of the brain.
By exercise, th~ l'eusorium, er we may say, the whole ner-
vous !lystcm, suffers such a change that it is not in such good
condition to act-is not so disposed to, act, as before such u-
ercihf'1 other things being equal. Hence stronger or more io·
terl·~ting impre~sions, or stronger sensorial tcnde_ncies, are
nece,5ary to keep a man awake after exercise, tban b~forc ;
hence, too, a man retiring from noise to a soft couch, and clo-
sing his eye~, sooner ceases to think and sense, after having
studied or toiled all day, than he docs on placini himselfin a
similar situation when not tired•.
Wc may r-ay that exercise is a predisposing cause of sleep,
and t:1c avoiding of impressions a more immediate cause. To
go to slt:ep, is to have all conscicut actions cease. \Ve do
h~s ~;iven him courage to advocate the doctrine of immaterialism.
bas " admitted the assertion that the brain is as much an organ or
sensation and thought, as the liver and stomach are organs for the
secretion of bile and gastric fluid."

uot believe 1na~ 111 orJinarJ casei, the consc1ent aclions of
th. brain arc atopped by any accumulation ofblood within the
brain. There is no need of such a supposition to account for
ordinary or healthy sleep. We do not see why, when the
brain is not in a good fi:ondition to act, and strong impressions
are avoiucd, it shou"ld not cease to act until it autfer a change
of condition, or until stronger impressions are made upon
some of the sentient nerves.-Because the sen!orial tenden-
cies arc sutlicient to keep up an action ofthe brain when1t is
in a good condition to act, it does not follow that they may
keep up such actions under other circumstancea:. ·
But there is some reason to 11uppose tllat narcotics induce
&Jeep by causing the vessels oftbe brain to become more dis-
tended with blood, hereby obstructing the actions ofthe sen-
sorium. It may be, however, that they affect the condition
of the brain, so as to canse sleep in some other way. This
is certain, after full doses of opium are taken, the vessels of
the head become more full. By turning to page 163, the
reader will find our notions concerning the modus operandi of
opium in producing sleep. We wish the immaterialists would
tell us how they suppose opium operates in stopping the ac-
tions o( tht-ir unextcndcd soul, or prevents it from changing
"statcs."-An unextended thing can never be squeezed or
obstructed in any of its actions : we suspect, too, that it pos-
ses!les no chemical affinities.
That morbid sleep is sometimes caused by compression,
there can be no douht. A 'pice of ~tkull driven in upon the
brain, or an accumulation of blood as in apoplexy, or of wa-
ter, as in hydrocephalu~, stops the consr.icnt actions of the
brain in this way ; and when no cooscicnt action of the brain
can be ('Xcited, (meaning by brain all the nerVQIIS matter with·
in the skull,) no sensation can be excited ; for the co-existence

of a conscient action of the erganic and cerebral exlremitje,
of a nerve is RS e~~ential to a sensation. as two tong;; put tG-
gether are to a pair of tongs.
Before closing this chapter, a f~w words may be offered
concerning some of the cau~cs that may prevent sleep. It i5
quite conceh·able and even probable that a morbid action ot
the minnie vc~sels of the brain, especially that part of it which
we call the sensorium, m_ay prevent the conscient actions of
the sf'nsorinm from cea!!ing, may cause a morbid watchfulne!S.
The physician often finds great difficulty in causing bis pa·
ticnts to sleep in such dise;~ses as _.are attended with an excit-
ed action of the vessels of the brain-exc.ited, as he ha~ good
reason to believe from other considerations than merely that
his patient cannot sleep. With that disease peculiar to bard
drinkers, known by the name of Delirium Tremens, or Brain
Fever, it is uot uncommon for patients to pass three or four
days and nig~ts in succes~ion without sleeping.
Another cause of watchfulness may be exceedingly strong
sensorial tendencies.-Whatever appears to us to have an
impol'tant influence on our happiness, int':!rests us greatly,
and whatever interests us greatly, gives rise to very strong
sensorial tendencies; either because we think much about it,
or because our thoughts .-elatave to thi8 thing are very in-
tense. Now when the sen~o1ium is strongly disposed to think
about any thing, the man will sometimes lie tumbling and
thinking half the night, in spite of all his "willing" to go to

CHAPTER XXVI.
On Dreaming, Somnambulism, and Somnamloquism.
Man e:~ists in three t~tates, a sleeping, a dreaming and a wak·
ing stale• 'fhe dreaming slate though essentially differf'nt
from either of the other two, partakes more of the nature o(
the waking than the sleeping state.
Although it is very common for pe1-sons to dream, we class
dreaming among the morbid actlon!l of the nervous syst~m;
and chiefly for the three follow in~ rt>a~ons: F1rst, D•~eased
pereons are more apt to dream than well ones. Secorld, We
cannot see that dreaming is eubserviwt to the well being of
the individual who dreams, as all healthy adions are. Thrrd,
We suppose that in dreaming, C<lnscient action~ sometimes
commence in the sensorium and extend into the nerves, as
they probably do in delirium, which last atf~:ction is univer-
sally admitted to he a morbid one.
There is no difficulty in pointing out an obvious distinction
between a eleeping, and a dreaming or a waking state; but
to determine the pl'ecise nature of the diffcreuce between a
dreaming a1'd a waking statt>, appears to bt: rather more diffi-
cult. And although it will be admitted that in most ca~es
there is a wide, nay, an e~~E'Iltial difference betwt>en these .
two states; yet, for a Rhort time, a man sometimes £•xi~ts in
1uch a state that he scarcely knows whether tl) cousl(ler it a
dreaming or a waking state. · ~

believe that Chc l!ame, or ur.'l ruarlythe sarm, conscit>nt ac-

conscient actions m:~y extend frnm the ~;en!'orium it~to tbe

which feeling• are t;~USED by the act1ons of the sem:onum.
It is true, we may dream of !leeing a red hot iron, or a piece

awakes.*
As to audial perceptions while dreaming, we believe that
we frequently have imperfect oues, and sometimes perfect
ones ; and that the latter are those which cause us to awake
as suddenly as though the perception \Vere a natural one-as
though it were excited by an impressi,on.
As to those perceptions which consist, in pr.rt, o~ action.
s
of nerves of feeling, we believe tbNe are many men, and
some women, who might testify that they have, while dream-
ing, experienced such perceptions ; attcuded too with other
eeus•l>le phenomena whidt com·ince them that there is no
mistake about the· matter. But there may be ~orne dispute
whether these ,,erceptions commence in the sensorium, or
the genital organs.-We are of the opinion that they some-
times commeuce in the one, and sometimes in the other.
We have said that the sensorium is less active in a dream-
ing than in a waking s!ate. By this, we mean it is not so
mu.ch disposed to act, and its actions are less intense than in
a waking state ; but 01any say their thoughts oa· ideas are
more distinct or vivid. when. dreaming than when awake ;
and such per~ous may be di!>posed to maintain that whatever

oc:onscient action:i of his semorinm, auJ tu:rve~ too, art· ler.s
intense, and thoile of the sensorium le~s numerous, thau when
awake.
It has been said that in dreaming hours, our thm;l!;hts occur
in \'ery uuuatural relatiou!!, allllthat we imagine many st rar:ge
allll t11111atural thing~ ; auri yet it is gcaa~rally admilled :hat
their succc!>siou is ~ov erncd hl· tht! saine priuctple~ a,; "hen

11atural relations.
The materiali~t, however, is not much puzzled by the p~e-_
oomena of dreaming : he supposes that if our ideas, "hen
awake, should become perceptions-that if our stm~orial ac·
tious should be allended with corrc~pond111g actions of 1he
optic and audrtory nerves-we should hear noise~!!, see strange
o~jects, and ·be iu n~ many rlifft·rcnt and di~tant places in a mi·

Itsometimf's happens tbat when a man .is not awake, those
motive alltious of his brain which preccd~ the contractions o(
the muscles of locomotion and voice, will not set in, on the
occurrence of certain ttensorial actions, as they do when the
man is awake. In such case the man may urgently desire to
speak, or mo\·e his limhs or body, but cannot-his muscles
do not contract. He has the Incubus or nightmare. We
are inclined to believe that in 1.1ome rare cases, even thqse
motive actions of the brain which precede the contractions of
the muscles of rcspintion, ceas~, Qnd the person dies without
moving a limb. We well recollect a death which we conjec•
ture wa~ cau,.ed in thi~ way. It was the death of an elderly
gentleman who had not been threatened with any kind of fits,
nor su~pected of ha\•ing any disease of the bloodvessels. He
died in hcd; and from all appearanc:e, it was el·idcnt that he
died without movin~ a limb. Qtwry. Ifin sur.h cases, the cir-
culation should cease the instant the respiration ceases, would
such changes take place in the system as to render it impo5-
sible to excite it into actio•• again, liO quickly as when the
heart continues to beat, and thus gi\·es rise to accumulations
of venous blood?
At other times those motive action:~ of the brain which pre-
cede the contractions of the muscles of loco-motion and voice,
do as readily 10et in on the occurrence of certain sen~orial ac.-
tions, as when the person is awake. In such case the person
talks, walks, and performs many other muscular actions. It~
is not ~enerally the ca&e, however, that the !'ame person talks
and walks in his dreaming hours; and indf"ed, sleep talking
and sleep walking are considered as different affections~ aud
are furnished with different names,-somnamloqui~m for the
former, and som11ambulism for the latter; but they are not es-
sentially diffi!rent, pathologically considered.

and it is proh11hle th:-tt his optic nern~ are iA u eycitable a
cond1tion as when his oth«!r 5euses arc n~t iu a torpid state,
as when he i"-awakc. If so, he has natural and perfect per•
cetttion~, he seer as distlllctly as a wakiug man does with the
•
r.une degree of light. At other timeil his eyes are closed,
and he goes about from place to place as a man in
the dark, or as a hliud man, and sometimes meets with acci·
dents. Tho~e who are fond of the marvellous do not tell us of
the accidents wt.ich somnambuh~ts meet with, in their blind
excursions; but the~e accident~ occur so frequently that most
men are acquainted with partkular instance1. We have ma·
ny wondtrfv.l accounts, or many accounts of the wond. rful do-
it•gs, of somnambulists; but the.}' have not puzzled philoso-
phers eo much as 1ht: somniloqnists. The latter ofien utter
long discourses, particularly religious discourse~, when alone
or when closely surrounded by many persons, and with greater
ftuency than they probably would, were they awake. If qucs-
tillnB are put to them, they often give rational an!lwers; and
what is perhaps still more difficult to account for, thP.y cannot
remember, alter they awake, that they dreamed or uttered
any thing-provided we may rely on their testimony.
We suppose that somniloqnists cannot gcnerl\lly remelll•
Tter their dreams, because they con!list of ideas only.-A man
nPver remembers his mere ideas. We remember our per-
ceptions, that is, we rememder what we have sem, .
'teard, &c.
But to have an idea occur to us to-day, is not to rt>memher that
it occorred to us last night, or at any other particulllr time.
Ideas may orc:ur to us to-day, which are not uew to us, and
which we do not consider as !ltJch ; but to remember that they
occurred to us at a particular time, we must have an 1dea ef
ourselves in a PLACE at a certain time, mu!lt have ideas of the
thmge that were around us at that time, and must think that
this idea occurred to us when we we1e iu 11ucb place. When a
4~
Digitized bvGoogle
wan remembers a dream, he remembers or thinks of, what he
1am, heard, &c. when he was not awake. A man may have
thousands of mer~ ideas when not awake, byt if he have
no perceptions, he cannot 11ay, wheu awake, that these ideal
occurred to him when he was not awSke : Milhona of i4eaa
occur to the waking man cn~ry day, and at night he may nGt
beable to say, with certain!} that ooe of them has occur-
red to him thi,, day. ·Thl' reader will remember that in tbe
._chapter on sleep, we came to the conclusion that we often lie
hollrs together without having any ideas, not so much from
the consideration that we cannot remember, aftt:r we awake,
that any ideas occurred to u~ during these hours, as from oth·
er con!iderations.
But we shall be told that somniloquists do sometimes have
p'erceptiona; that they give rational answers to questions, aud
undoubtedly hear and reg:ml, 8uch qoe~tions. Tbis we must
grant; but they do not have surh perceptions as enable them
to say in tbe morning, that they had the@e perceptions the night
prtvious. A~k them ifthey t~er heard or thought ofsuch ques-
tion a1 you know was put to them last mght, ana they may
tell yon yes, hut cannot say whether it was last night, ,-ez;ter~
day, or ayear ngo.
If this way of accounting for the fact, that somnil oquistl
are often, nay, generally, unable to rP.member that they dream•
ed at the time that bystandl'rs heard them talk, be not satisfac.
tory to all, we sh:tll uot thing it stran,e. We are not, our.
seh·es, f.ntirely sati~fied with it; but under tbe present stale
of our ignoranec we caunot accouut for it in a more plausible
way. We assume what we cannot prove, and what some
may not be disposed to grant; and that ill, that the dreams
which aomniloq•Jists canuot remember, are not like the
dre11ms which men do remem"er, but consist of mere ideas
with a few scatterin& p<:rccptions.
a
'Should the remarks of the pre!lent writer be thooght wor;.
thy of notice, the 'assertion, that we uever r~member oul!
'idea~a, may give rise to !ngeuious ditcussions; aud if so,
we doubt not that it will be determined that we do not re-
member an idea, in the sense we remember a thunder ahower,
or any other event that takes place without.
That a mao should readily hear when not awake,· ia no*
more strange. than tha,t one sense should be less torpid, at the
time others are more torpid. •
The reason why somniloquist• sometimes talk more du·
ently than they would were they awake, is this. their train of
ideas relative to the subject concerning which they talk, is oot
interr•tpted by auch discordant ideas or sensorial action1, as
would occur were they awake. When" a waking man con•
verses with others ou any SIJ'-!ject, he thinks what words are
most proper for him to use; thtnkl' how his ht>arers will b~
pleased with what he says; thinks what they will think of hit
person and jestures; in ehort, he has mauy perceptions and
ideas which prevent the regulAr, connected Bow of ideas rela• ·
tive to the subject he is talking a!tout; and hence does not
converse with the ease and tluency th11t he would were he ira
the conrlition of a somniloquist. We are all of us acquaiat•
ed with, inen who undoubtt>dly think fi11ely in t~eir 1tud1t>8 i
but who, when they attempt "to speak in puhlic. make very
bad work of it. A man cannot 11peak in public, flippantly •'
' and to the purpose, until he be .rt>gardless about what words
be n~e~, regardless about what hili heart'l'l'l will think: he must
think righ1 on about his subject, and nothing but his suhject.
As to the Immediate cauus of dreama, they may be divided
into two claase!l, sensorial and nenoJU. The sensorial caus- •
es are nothing more nor less than the sent~orial tendencies ; the
nervous are 1111~h stales of organs, aod aucb impreuioua, al
&ive 1ise to actiooa of our oervet.

There are manv C8U!!e8 which serve to bring tbe DerYOUS
system into that weak, tit:klish slate·which medical men call
irritable; all such ClAUses may be considered as predisposmg
cau~e• ofdreams. Affedton~ of the digestive organs; mental,
or more properly sensorial agitations, and bard drinki11g are
of this kind.
When a weary man fir~t goes to sleep, his nervous system is
·bot in a favorable couditiou to act ; but after sleepin& some
time, his nervous ~ystt•m hecomes recruited, and as the sen·
'aori~m is disposed to act-as it has many and strong tenden·
cies to act, it will set to work of its own accord, if it be not
eet to work by some nervous action. Every thing else beiog
equal, the stronger sensorial teudenc•es give rise to actions in
_
prt-fereoce to the weaker, and as we are str >ngly dispoeed
to think about !loch &u~jec.ls as we have rect.ntlythought much
about, our ltr,sorial dreams (speaking with reterence to their
cause) generally relate to sucb subjects as have lately P.ngag·
•d our attention Juring our waking hours.
When dreams are cau~t'd by states of organs, or by irn-
pre!'sioos, they generally have !lome relation to such organs,
or to the impressing agents. Thus, if a bottle of hot water
at the feet be the imprt'ssing agent, the penon may dream of
making a journey to the top of Mount .JEtna aud of fiuding
the heat of the ground almo~t in!'urportable ; if a blister ap·
plied to the head, tbe person may dream of being scalped by a
:party of ludians. The bladder and semiual vessels beiug re·
pltte with their respective fluids, give rite to dreams having
eorne rd~ttion to these organs. A tt1ll stomach, obstructing a
free motion ofthe diaphragm, causes 1u1 accumulAtion ofblood
abnut the heart aud lungs, and in this WflY gives rise to a 11ense
-
of weight or load at the breal<t ; and the person dreams of a .
"huge and hideous spectre, tyrannic~tlly squalled upon the
cbtal, aud striving to take away tbe breath."

that paper fr-em the Western Monthly Review. The editor
of this review finds the story in a work whtch i@ entitled
"Bea~ley on the Human Mind," a work which i~ said

minutes, and at lenglh I became a l1ttle more calm; and as 1
was extremely ·exhnu~ted, Isoon after fell into a troubled kind
of slumber, which lasted for about half an hour. The vision
\vas ascribed to the great agitation of mmd in which I had
been, and it was supposed that I should have nothing more
.to apprehend from that cause ; but the violent affection hav•
iug put mv 1ltrors into au unusual state. from this arose other
~onsequences, which require a more detailed dt:scription.
' In the afternoon, a little after four o'clock, the figure
which I had 11een in the morning again appeared. I was
alone when it happened ; a circumstance wbicb, as rna) be
eaEily conceived, could not be \·ery agreeable. I went there·
fore to the apartment of my wife, to whom I related it. But
thither also the figu~e pursued me. Sometimes it wail pre·
sent, sometimes it vani&hed ; but when seen it was always
the same standing figure. A li(tle after six o'clock, several
stalking figures also appeared ; but they had no connexion

deep and distressing vexauon, and had reflected on the con·
sequence:~ of it, in order, if po~s•ble, to a\"oul them; and that
this havpeued three hour& after dmner, at the time when the
digestion first begins.
'At length I became more composed, with respect to the

found myself in ~ather respects perfectly well, yet the appari..

cd in number, and were tran~formcd in the most extraordiua·
ry manner.
' After I had retovered from the 6~t impression of terror,
I never felt m)'!elfparticularly agitated by the!e appariaions,
as I considered them Ia be rP.al/ythP extraordinary consequmcu
ofindisposition. Oti the contrary, I emleavored as much u
possible to preserve my composure of mmd, that I might re-
main disfinctly con!lcious of what pa~sed within me. I ob·
served these phantom~ with great accuracy, and very oileD
rctlected on my pr('vioas thoughts, with a view to discover
r;ome lnw in the association of ideas, by which esact1y those
or other figures' might present themselves to the imagioatioo.
Sometimf's I thought I had made a di5covery, especially in
the latter part of my visrot;s ; but on the whole, I could trace
no connexion which tl•e various figures, that thus appeared
and disappeaJCd to my sight, had with my state of mind, or
with my employment and the other thoughts wltich engaged
my attention. After frequent accurate observations on tbe
subject, having fairly proved and maturely considP.red it, I
could form no ot~r conclusion than that when the nervous
system is weak, and at the t:nme time too much excited, or
rather deranged, similAr fig11res maJ appear in such • maftfttt'

ca~e, ~ere not the consequence of any know11 law of reason,
of the imagination, or other usual as~ociation of idea ; aocl
such also is the case with other men, as far as we can reason
from the few examples we know.

~ervatioo, that acquaintances with whom I daily convenecl
nevea· appeared to me as phantoms; but always such as
\Vere at a distance. When these apparitions had continued
aorne weeks, and I could regard them with the greatest com·
posure, I afterwards endeavored at my own plt~asure to call
forth phantomtl of several acquaintances, whom I, for that
reason, represented to my imagination in the mo~t lively man·
ner, but in vain:;- ·for however accurately I picturf!d to my
mind the fi~ures of such per~ons, I never once could succeed
in my desire of seeing them esternally, though .I had some
short time before ~ceo them as phantom•, and &hey had, per·
haps, afterwards unexpectedly prescnt~d t!iemselves to me in
every case involuntarily, as if they had been presented ex-
ternally, lfke the phenomena in nature; though they cerlaillly
lr.ad thtir origin i1llernalt!J ; at the same time I toas al'll1flys able
to di~ti11guish, with the greartst precision. phautoms from phe·
nomma. Indeed I never once erred in this, ae I was gen-
erally calm and llelf-collected on the occasion. I knew ex·
tremely well when it only appeared to me that the doo~ was
opened and a phantom entered, and when the door really waa
opened : and any per~on came in.
'It is also to be noted, that these figures appeared to me at
all times, and under the most different circumstances, equally
distinct and clear. Whether I "·as alone or in company, by
broad daylight, or in the ni~ht time ; in my own, or in my
neighbor's house ; only when I I'VaS at another person's house
they were less frequent ; and when I walked the street, they
very seldom appeared. When I shut my eyes, sometimes
the figures disappeared ; sometimes they remained even af-
ter I closed them. If they vani~hed in the former case, on
opening my eyes again, nearly the same figul'es appeart:d
which I haabefore seen.
' I sometimes conversed with my physt.:iau and my wife,

.ooceming the phantoms which at the time hovered arouoi
me ; for in general the form~ appeared oftener in motiou than
at rest. They did not alwa)S continue present; they fre-
quently left me altogether, and again appeared for a short
time or a longer space of t•me. siRgly or more at once, but in
general several appeared together. For the most part, I saw
humRn figtlrt:s of both sexes ; they commonly pas~ed to and
fro as if they had no connexion with eRch other, like peorle
at a fair when all is bu~tle, sometimes they appeared fl) have
'busineu with one another. Once or twice (saw among them
persons on horseback, and dogs and bird" ; these figures aU
appeared to me in their natural size, as distinctly a~ if they
bad existed in real life, with the 11everal tints on the uncover-
ed parts ofthe body, and with all the different kind11 ~f c:Diours
of clothes. But I think, howe\·cr, that the colors were some-
what paler than tht>y are in nature.
' None of thf'se 6gurt's had any distinguit~hing <'haracten;
tht'y were neither terrible, ludicrous or repulsive ; most of
them were ordinary in their appearanr.e ; some were e\•ca
agrt>eable.
' On the whole, the longf'_r I continued in this state. the
more did the number of the ph'lntatlmll increa!'t', and the R~

beard it in r.ompan), intermixed with the conversation of real
persons; frequently in single phrases only, but sometimea
even in connected discourse.

' This was performed on the 20th of April, at elevea
o'clock in the forenoon. I was alone with the surgeon ; but
during the operatioh the room swarmed w1th human forms of
every description, which crowded fast on '>ne auother; this
continuetl till half past four o'clock, when the digestion com•
mences. I then obsen·ed that the figures began to move
slowly ; soon afterwards the colours became gradually paler,
and ever.v !Ieven minutes they lost more and m'lre of their in•
tensity, without :tny alteration in the di5tinct figure of the ap• -
paritions. At halfpast six o'clock all the figures were entire•
Jy white, and moved very little, yet the form~ appeared per•
(ectly distinct ; by degrees they became visibly tess plain,•
without decreasmg in number, as had often formerly been the
case. The figures did not move off, neither did they vanisb,
which had also usually happened on former occasion!!. lo

by.degrees were lost to the eye. At about eight o'clock there
did not remain a vestigE' of any of them, and I have never

allowed to expres; myself, or a sensation as if I saw some•

The.fourth clau1>e ravors the opinion which we ventured to

our opll'cal and audial one!l are so nearly like perfect ones, as.
to influence a man's conduct much the same &s perfect orees,
or in other words, as to be mistakt>n for perlect ones. Al-
though M. Ntcholai's morbid perceptio~s were almost exactly
like natural one,-although they were certai;tly t~~nmethiug
essentially d•ffi~rent from mere iclt•as or conctptious, still, be·
ing <twake and ratioual, h~ " was always able to di$tinguish,
with the greate~t pre~i~ion, phantoms from phenomena;" and
we have no rc!lson to suppose that he d1d so by re~ortinl( to
the te~timouy of the sense of feding-by p•1Hing forth his
hands to feel the phantoms in the places where tht:y appear•

him return to the seventeenth chapter of this work, before he
proceedsany farther.
It is not probable that a case ·ever did or will occur in
which three of the five senses testified f.1lsely concerning one
thing ; but if the eye, the ear, and the hand, should testify to
any person that an enemy is pre~ent, threatening him. when
there is not, snch person would undoubted!) believ•! that ~ud.
person is present, and all the world could n.,t change his be-
lief; of c.ourse, his conduct would be so influenced by bi1
false perceptions, that all sane pel"!!olls would pronounce him
io&ane, respecting thi9 enemy, if nothing more. WP. see,
then, that a case of insanity from false perceptions is suppoltl·
blt. But the case of M. Nicolai shows that whe;-~ the thoughts
occur in a natural order-mlten ihe suggesting principle is ix
DTtUr, a man may have false optical and audial perceptions,
and yet, 110 far from being insane, reason on t~ll ~ubjt:Cts as
soundly as the soundest philo:>opher. This tht>n is e•sential
to insanity-the ~uggesting prir~iph mwt be out oforder; or in
plain mattcr-of·fact language, the sensorium mu!ot act helter-
akelter, fiNt one thought and then another, without any pro-
per order or relation.
When the nervous system is in such state that the sensori-
um acts lhus, the schoolmen would s11y, the judgment is dis··
ordered ; and furthennore, when the nervous system is in
auch 11tate, fal11e perceptions are apt to artee; when theae oc•
cur, tbey would say, the perception is dil!ordered, or lbe mao
is delirU>w•
.According to our views, delirium is not el'sential to insani·
ty ; but, although a case of insanity from mere false percep-
tions, is auppotable, insanity is essential to delirium. A certain
variety of in!'anity is delirium, or delirium is a frequent at·
tendant.on insanity. The mere false perceptions which do

CHAPTER XXVIII.
On Idiotism.
As the intelle.!luAI powers of different species ofAnimals are
more or less perfect, accordh1gly as their brnins are more or
Jesl' developed ; so the intellectual powers of different i~di­
'fiduals of the same specie~ corre!lpond, in perfection, with
the perfection oftheir brains; and one may decide with much
certainty whether a roan be a genius or a fool, mereIy by view·
ing his head. If the individual possess a full, high forehead,
and other parh of the head in natural proportions, it is pretty
certain that he is not a natural, that ~s, congtniltll, fool ; and
highly probable that he is a man of good natural part~ ; yet
he may not be reputed as a man of talents, for although the
aensorium be ever so fully developed and well organized, it
cannot thiuk without tendencies. Knowled~e is as es~ential
to intellectual superiority as a good br11m ; but a good brain
will acquire knowled~e with greater facility than a poor
one. 1-Awever, a full, high forehead, and a large facial an·
gle,• are not sure iodication11 of a good sensorium ; for the

skull and the membranes which envelope the brain may be
unusually thick; or the outer aod inseusible part of the cere-

sible part-(Jf which part the sensorium constit"utcs a share ;
or the 11ensible part, though dufficiently large, may be poorly
organized,-it may be too dry and stitf, or too soft and phleg-

tal idiotism, the forehe11d is low and narrow, indictlting a c:oa·
tracted aensorium.-Parents who are naturally idiotic, tbat
is, idiotic from oricinal make of their thinking organ, are as li·
able to have .idiotic offspriag, as they are to have offspring
which resembltt them in features ; for like orca~ized animals
beget like organi?.ed offipring; and as the organa are, soare
their functions.
The more remote causes of idiotism, when not eongenital,
are habitual inebriety, excessive and enervating pleasures, vi·
olent passiona, injudicioua management in ecphronia, [iliiall•
ity] and especially an excessive usc ofthe lancet. To which
some add, the suppression of accustomed discharges, and the
drinking of human blood. But in all cases the immediate
cause·is aome misaffection of the brain ; and in a great ma·
jority of cases this morbid affection i• mamfest to the eenses
of the anatomist. Sometimes the brain is softer than oatu•
ral, but more frequently harder and denser ; sometime& polr
pous and even bony coocretioos are diecove~:ed.
" In idiotism," says Dr. Good, "there is no meiDory, no
language, no reason." But" the idiot has all the animal in·
stints, and some of the past'ious." How it is that idiots may
have organic and even sensorial pa11sione, and yet " no mem·
ory, no language, no reaeon," tbe materialist find" no diffi·
culty in showing; as those who have perused thi11 work thus
far, mn!lt be prepared to admit. But why idiota should have
poorer souls than· other human beings, rather puzzles Ul-
perhaps it i1 becau11e their brains are eo badly organized they
do. not deserve better. We wish the immaterialists would
clear up thi~ matter. It will uot satisfy us, for them to com·
pare the brain to a fiddle, and the soul to a fiddler, and tell
us that when the·fiddl• is out of tune, the beet musician can-
not play a g~od tunP. l1pOD it, for We know that impressiont

are, in many instances, under the necessity of regarding tM
soul as the fiddle and the brain as the fiddler. they must ad·
mit that there is no music, no ideas, until the brain playa up·
on the soul. But more ofthis in another place.

eHAPTER XXIX.
On Deal,\ and Dying.
When all actions of the nervous and muscular systems
cease, the person dies J and if the system have suffered such
derangement that these ac:tions, or even tholie ofthe nervoua
system alone, cannot, by any natural means, be eKited ag"clio,
the person is absolutely dead,-dead in the common sense of
the word. That a man may be dead in the common sense
ofthe word, it is not necessary that hie muscular organs have
undergone euch change m their physiological organization
that no contractions can by any means be excited in them.
Otherwise the criminal i11 not "dead, dead," whose l'olunta·
ry muscles may be excited to contract by galvanism ; nor the
senaelets bullock whose blood is let out, but whose beart con·
tinues to act.
If a ca11e 1hould occur in which all muscular actions, even
those of the minutest capillaries, should cease, and the con·
ac:ient actions of the nervous system continue, the person
would appear to be dead ;-he would be speechless, pul&e-
lell, motionletas, and probably," pale as death." But if by-
standers knew that he continued to think and senae, or even
think, they would not say such penon ia dead; this, bowel'·
er, they could not know ; and tbe person would be dead to
the byataodere, but nut dead as it respects himself. Where-

as every person is dead, for the time heing, as it respeau
himself, whenever the conscient action• ofhis ne"ous system
cease. In every case ofaapby:xy from drowcing, banging, in•
bahng irrespirable gases, from lightning and intense cold;
and in every case of compressed brain in which conscient ac-
tions do not occur from strength of sensorial tendencies, and
caooot be excited by impressions upon the senses ; and we
may add, in ~~ery case ofnatural sleep,-the person is deal,
for the time being, so far as it respects himself, whatever may
be the muscular actions that tak~ place.
Sleep, eithe~ morbid or natural, is a temporary death, as
it respects the individual who sleeps-he is none the lesa
dead to himself, for the time being, becauae be may think
and sense again before his body is decomposed. What would
often prove to be only a temporary death, if proper means
were u'Jed to bring the ne"ons system again into an active
state, proves a sleep to the hour of reorganizatioD or reaurrec•
tion, merely for want of a surgeon with his imtraments, or
even a pair of bellows to bring the aoul back again into the
brain ! Death, a thing often personified, is not an old dry·
bones walking to and fro the earth, and up and down in it,
striking sick folks ; but merely a d~ad state eforganized be·
ings•
.After the animal system has undergone such changes that
its physiological proportiee. no longer exist, c;r in other words,
afler it bas undergone such changes that it cannot be excited
into actioa by natural means, it soon undergoes still further
changes, called chemical ; but it is no more myster~ous tbat
it does so, than that a barrel of beer should tum sour, afler
undergoing the proce11 of fermentation, and suffering some
other slight changes. The espression, that life, or the lawe
of thE'! vital principle, control the lawe of chemistry or of
chemical actions, if not so much mere noDJenee, is at leut a

Jfery figurative e-spret11ion, which we trust will no tnore de-
ceive evt:r. weak heat!~.
Dying, though often spoken of u an act, is more properly
the ceMation of vital actions ; and the immediate cause o(
dying is not the cessation of vital actions! for this is dying;
and the same thing cannot be both the cause and the thing
caused : the immediate cause of dying is, in evny insttnl('e,
some change in the condition of nervous system. This change
is Renerally apparent on d1ssection, th?ugh not always, for the
ne"ous system may suffer some change in its nice, pbyaio-
logical organization, which destroys ita sensibility ; and
yet not be cognizable by the imperfect senses of the anato-
mist. But wht:n this change of the nervous system i!! not ob-
'fious, and often when it is, a,chanie in some other important
organ, or in the duids o(the system, may be discovered. Tlaue
ehanges are ofte~ considered as causes of the death ; but
tbey are to be classed among the remote causes: they are
not the imrmdiate cause of the consciP.nt actions ceasing.
In the few ioatances-if any there be-in which it may
be said that persons die of old ~e, the change& which take
place in their systems, are very gradual ; but they are none
the less real on this account. You can no more make a phy-
sician believe that death ever takes place without sonie mor-
bid change of the/ystem, aa its cause, than you can make him
'believe that fire will not burn him. But the immaterial the-
ologists have not yet decided, that I know of, whether a mao
dies beeause the soul quits the body~ or whetht'r he diu be-
cause the body is disordered, and the ~;oul fi•es offbecause tbe
body is dead. Should they eTer t~eriou&ly consider this mat..
ter. they will find themselves compelled to admit-if they re-
sard tbe e•idenr.e which the book of nature furnishes-that a
derangf"ment ofthe syslf'~ i& the caut~t' ofevery death~ Were
it a fact, that men quite as frequently die instantly, without

any derangement of the system, as otherwise, it would be
some smaiLevidence in favor of immaterialism. Nor have
the immaterinlists yet informed us what become11 of the sonl,
and what it is about, dllring those hours, days, and even week•
(if reports be true) in which the bodj is dead as it respect•
it&elf, and apparently dead to by-standers7 after wbkh time,
bowe,·er, it is brought again into a thinking condition, by na-
tural means. Should they tell us tbat, during this time, the
soul remains inactive within the body; we should be induced
to ask several other questions, to which they must give ration·
al answers, before their doctrines wilt be rendered as clear and
satisfactory ae the doctrines of the materialist. We would not
insist on their informing us by what means we car. ever know
when the 'soul has quit the body; but we would ask th'em w~1
the soul does not continue to think and sense even in ifthe bo-
dy be deranged :-we suppose they will contend that it thinks
and senses after· it quits the body ; (if it do not, it is a matter
ofindifference whether 1tgn to heaven or hell-it is the sheer·
est little uothing that ever did exi!l.;) 'now if it may think and
sense without any body at all, why may it not thiuk when in a
disonlered body? Is the unes.tended thing squeezed! or otber•·
wiee obstructed in its operations ? If it lie, why does it not_;:_
being intelligent-quit the c:layey taberuacle, and lmnt its way
back-for I r.m sure there is nOthing in my .head that knows
the way--t~ the celestial abodes ? But should the imma-
terialists tell us that in case ofasphysy, the soul quits the bo-
dy ; we should like to know how inftating the lu11gs, warming
and rubbing the body, applying volatiles to the nostrils, &c.,
bring it backagain.-Oh, yemen ofmysteries, clear up tbese
difficulties, or the groundless hypothesis which gives rise to
them, will not much longer be believed by men ofsound brains.
The pains ofdeath are undoubtedly much less thau most
persons have been Jed to bt:lien. To die, is to go to sleep ;
,-.- '

and we doubt ~ot th:tl most persons who Jive to the age of
puberty, undergo tenfold more misery in thinking ol death,
than in the simple act of dying; nay, tenfold more mitery
than they would, did they but entertain correct -.iews con·
cerning this change.-Error, of whatever description, inva·
riably gives rise to more human misery than happiness: it is
the ban~ of human felicity-the black devil ofthe earth. Me-
thinks I call see that the doctrine of soul, or we will say, the
ignorance ofmen concerning tbe constitution oforganized be·
iogs, has been the aooT of more human misery than would be
endured, if every human being now Jiving, were put to death
by hours ofexcruciating torture ; and yet it has been grave-
Jy asked, what good can res•Jlt from diffusing the rrinciples
ofmater~alism, admitting them to be true!
In all cases of dying, the individual· suffers no pain after
the sensibility of his nervous system is destroyed ; {or after
this, there ·is neither sensation nor thought. ' We say, rJ
thought, for we have every reason to believe that when the
senaorium has suffered such change that conscient actions
cannot be ezciled in it, such actions w1ll occur merely by
-.irtue of its tendenciea. Now the sensibility of the nervous
ayatem is often destroyed without much, and sometimes with•
out any, previou11 pain. Those who are !truck dead by a
stroke of lightning, those who are decapitated with one blow
of the axe, and those who are instantly destroyed by a crush
of the brain, experience no pain at all, in passing from a state
of life to a dead state. One moment's expectation of being
thus destroyed, far exceeds in.misery the pain during the act.
Those who faint away, on having a little blood taken from the
arm, or on any other occasion, have already endured all tbe
misery they ~ver would in this world, did they not again re·
"ive. Those who die of fevers, and most other diseases, su(.
fer their greatest pain, as a general thing, hours, or even
Digitized by GoogIe
3i5
days, before they expire. The sensibility of their ne"ous
system becomes gradually diminiahed, their pain• become
Jess and less acute under the same exciting cause ; and at tbe
moment when their friends think them in the greatest distress,
tbey are more at ease than they have been for days pre-.·ious:
their disease, as far as it respects their feelings, begins to act
upon them like au opiate. Indeed, many are already dead,
as it re1pects them•elves, when ignorant bystanJers are much
tbe most to be pitied, not for th~ loss of their friend, but for
their sympathising anguish. Those diseases which destroy
Jife without immediately aft'ecting the ~ondition ofthe nervous
eystem, give riae to more pain than those that do affect this
system, so as to impair its sensibility. The 'tllost painful
deaths which human beings inflict on each other, are produ•
ced by the rack and the faggot. The halter is not so cruel as ·
t#tber of these, but more savage than the axe. Horror and
pain considered, it aeems to us as though we should chooae a
narcotic to either.
We think that moat penons have been Jed to regard dying
as a much more painful change than it generally i11, first, be-
~ause they bave found by what they have experienced in
themselves aQd seen in others, that sentient beings often strug-
gle when in distress ; hence struggling is to them a sign, an
invariable sign, of di11tress. But we may remark, that strug·
glee are very far from being invariable signs ofdistress ; mus- ·
cular action and consciousness are two distinct things, often
esi&ting 11eparately ; and we ban abundance of reason to be·
lieve, that in a great proportion of cases, those struggles ofa
d1ing man which are so clistreuing to behold, are as entirely
, independent ofconeciousnese, ae the struggles ofthe recently ·
decap1tated fowl. A 1econd real!on why most persons are led
to regard dying as a very painful change, is, because they
koow that men often endure sreat pain without dying, and,
Si6
forgetting that like cause1.1 produce like eJfects onlyunder nn•·
ilar citcumstancu, they infer that life cannot be destroyed
without still greater pain. Third, because they beline tbat
th,ere is something in man, whreh is the subject of as vivid
consciousness when be is dyin&, and almoat dead, as wheo be
is in health.
Most persons, aml espetially young persona, desire to live,
and this is as much as to say, tbey desire not to die ; but the
horrors of death, which render a considerable portion of the
majority of men's lin& much less happy than they otherwise
would be, arc net owing to this desire to live. Nor do they
consist but in part in dread ofthe 11ains of death : they consist
mostly in ddleful ideas of a future slate, fear of endlese and
most desperate punishments, &c. b11t if this share ofhuman
misery be thought a blessing to mankind, we may thank igno·
raoce and her big baby superstition for it. The materialist,
who bas been so fortunate as aot to have his reason !!hackled,
looks on death with much more composure than any one else,
exceptiog a very small proportion of mankind who have been
lead to believe, confidently, that they shall be extremely hap·
py in a future state.
The materialist who has studied the book of nator;e;an.d
drawn his cOAclusions from it, regarding the books of men as
erroneous in all points in which they do not agree with it,
says to himself: I( a body he organized at some future period,
posllcssing the same sensorial tendencies which I possess, 1of
course, 11hall again exist. And if I do, 1 shall neither be ex-
tremely happy nor extremely miserable. The same mer·
ciful and unchangeable God, whu governs now, will cov·
em then, and we have no reason to 1uppose that hi1
Jaws will he altc~ed. He will not, with a vengeance, punish,
for deeds done in this life, any being who was involuntarily
born into the world, with passions to tpur him to ac:tion, and

so circu"mstanccd that there was a CAUSE for every action of
his, whether mu5cular gr nervou:>. Bot as tn this life if I stray
from the path of rectitude, there will alway& be something to -
prick; and the more I go astray, the more mi.ierable shall I
be.
· But ifI donot exist in a future state, I shall not care a straw;
for when I am dend, I shall not exist; and it is absurd to sup-
pose that a being will care, which does not exist. When the·
body, which the constmction of our langun;!e compels me to
speak of as though .it were something besides mysf'lf, calling
it my body, is in the grave; tht~re will be no thinking I, off in
some other region, thinking about the cold gra'Oe, and anxious-
ly awating the dny of resurrection. No; my thoughts of an-
nihilation are far from being horrible to me-they are not
blended with the strange notion of caring about it, after_l am
dead; and I have nt::ver been cajoled mto the belief that I
shall be extremely happy hereafter, like one who may have
been led to believe that he deserves, and will indeed draw, a
larg esum, becau~e he has bought a ticket. Comequentl_v my
reason goes ahroad without me£:ting with information which
blasts my fondest,firmest expectations.

CHAPTER XXX.
!1n Attempt to SM'ID that Materialism is as consistent roith Chris·
tianity as Immaterialism.
We presume to Ftate in tenns unqualified, that whoever
maintains that christianity is opposed to materialism~ virtual-
ly maintains that christianity is opposed to trutb. Cba-iltian-

ity must ac·cord with materialism or she cannot have a pass-
age; for truth will go when he once get~ under weigh.
Whether it be possible· to reconcile either materialism or
immaterinli~m with ~hristiauity, we cannot wtth certainty say,
until the divf'~e religious sects professing christiamty agree
among them~clves what christianity consists in, and inform us
of their decision. However, we can proceed· to show, that,
according to our view" of christianity, materialism is as con-
sistent with it as i111materialism.
According to our ,·iews, the sentiment tliat whatever thinks
and sen~~s is something di~tinct from the nervous system, and
may seu~e and think independent of it, is uotes~cntialto chris-
tianity. This being the case, certain doctrines. of which this
sentJmf'nt is not one, may constitute christianity; and who-
ever believes in these doctrines may be a christian, though at
the same time a mate~ialist. And again, according to our
views, the idea that the bible writers w~re inspired with a pre-
ternatural share of scientific knowledge, as of Astronomy,
Auatomy, Physiology. &c., is not essential to christianity.
Now if it be admitted that neither of these sentiments or
doctrines, are es~eut11~ to chrit<tianity. that theJ coustitute no
e!'sential part of it; then are materialism and chri~tinily com-
patible. For, admhti~1g it is the nervous SJSlem, which sens-
. cs and thinks, it 'doee n~t follow from this but that every chris-
tian doctrine.• may be trtte.
But if the doctrine of soul be essential to christianity, so
that there is no christianity witt.out it ; then it it~ as evident
that chrjstJanity is false 'lb that the earth turns on its own ax·
is. An~ if the idea that the bihle wrilt·rs were inspired with
true knowledge concerning physical subjects, (and the consti-
tutinn of man and otht'f' animals is one ofthes(·,) he es!'ential
to ebiistiaoity; then shall we prove 'that christianity is false,

when we prove that these writers. w.cre not thus ~nspired ; as
we now prot·ecd to do.
" And God made the firmament and divided the waters
\Vhicb were under the firmament from the waters which were
above I he firmament. And God called the firmament heaven.
And God eaitl, Let the waters under the heaven bt• gathered
together into one place, and let the dry land appear."-Gen.
ch. lst, v. 7, 8, 9. " And God created two great lights, and
the stars abo, and stt them in the.firmament C?fheaven."-Gen.
ch. 1st, v. JG, 17. "And the windowsofheavm wen~ open-
ed, and the rain was upon the earth forty days aud forty
nighiii."-Gcn. ch. 7. v. 11, 12. "And the wwdows ofheav-
en were stopped, and the rain from he:<''cn wa~ restrained.,
-Gen. ch. 8, v. 2. The!'e passages show clearly that who-
ever wrote the book of Gcuesi!l, IJPiit•vcd that the blue and
'seemingly arched canopy over our head", is tht. firrnanaeut of
heaven.; and that the sun, moou ·and to tars, are all equi-dis-
tant from the earth, 'or at least, that they are all set in this
arching canopy, they being all "set in the firmament_ofheav-
en;' wh•ch divides the waters, &c. This il' llll opinion which
children and all persons ignorant of astronomy would natu·
rally entertain. It is clear. aiEOo, 4hal this writer believed
that when it raius, or at least, when it rained in the lime uf
the flood, the windows of heaven were opened, and the wa•
ter •' above the firmament" ran down-large stream11 being
broken into drops, no doubt, by fallmg &o great a dastance.
Now it is certain that these notions about the firmament;
about the sun, moon and stars being set in the firmament ;
about the windows of heaven which are windows of the fir-
mament, (for " God ~ailed the firmament heaven ;") aboat
tbe water above the firmament, that is, up in heaven, where
the God or Gods of the old aud new teataments dwell ; about

the rain, &c. &c. arc f.1l,:c; and of course the writer that en-
tertained them did no! receive them by inspiration.
Perhaps it will be said that thi! writ~r"' expressEd himself
in figurative language, and that we do not know but that he
thought correctI). Very .~ell, we will then say, aud wilh
quite as good reason, that whoever has spoken of a soul in
tbe hible, spoke figuratively ; and we have uo more reason
to suppose he believed the word means any thing distinct
from the nervous system, than we have that this writer be·
lieved the firmament of heaven and the windows thereof, to
be real beings.
In the niuth chapter, thirteenth verse, of Genesis, we read
" I will set my bow in the cloud, aud if shall be for a token of
a cm·enant between me and the earth."
Before we offer any remarks concerning this passa~:e, we
would observe, it is impossible for us to believe (and who is
to blame for it,) that the Author of worlds on worlds, ever
descendf'd iu a cloud of fire, 11moke, or any other vehicle, to
this ea~;th, and conversed with a man! What should we think
ohny man nowadays, if he sh')•Jid gravely as!crt that he had
been up to the top of Mount Tom and seen and conversed
wath God Almighty? Why is it that men will soouer believe
a whole strmg of bag stories than a single one ? If Moses ever
saw and heard whilt his unk~own historian has dedarcd that
bt> did, it i<~ much more ratroual to suppose that actions oc·
currcd in his ontic and auditory nen·es without impre~sions,
than thd the Deity ever paid him a visit and conversed with
him. From wbat we know ofthe God of nature, he brings
about bas ends hy the most .~imple mean~ ; and if he be un·

changeable. as the book of nature declares, and we believe, it
is but reasonable to suppose he always did so.
From the passage last quotett from Genc~is, and from oth-
ers immediately ·connected with it, it is evident that the writer
considered the .rainbow as a thing that made its appearance
:_. the fir!t time, after the flood, as a token of a covenant, &c.,
; .whereas it is a natural phenomenon which must always occur
when rays of light from the sun are reflected by drops of rain
in a particular manner; and ~vhich must necessarily have ta•
ken place, the unalteraule Jaws of nature being such, before
the flood as well as now.
What we read in the tenth chapter of Joshua, twelfth and
thirteenth verses, about the sun and moon standing still-tak·
en in connection with other passage• in the the bible \vhich
- · speak of the earth as standing on pillowfw-sbows clearly
that the bible writers, some of them at least, were so very ig-
norant of astronomy as to believe thllt the r.un and moon move
round the earth, instead of the earth turning round on its own
axts.
Anothererroneous notion entertained by the bi.ble writers,
is of a physiolog1cal nature-it _
relates to the c.onstitution of
man; it is the notion that man con~ists of material organs and
an inconceivaLI~ something else superadded, a something that
scuds out of him when his organs cease to act, and steers off,
or by angles is carried off, to heaven; and enjoys pleasure and
endures pain independent of the body.
It is true that with the exception of man, the writers ofthe
Old and ~ew Testaments, seldom had occasion to discover
their opinions concerning the nature of tlungs; but from what
little they have said concerning natural objects, it is evident
that they knew no more about them than thousaoda of other
men of their age ; it is evident they were not inspired
with a knowledge of the nature and constitution oforganic or
Digitized by GoogIe
382
in(!rganic bodies. Co: sequently, if the opmton th2t they
were, be e~!lential to christianity then is c:hristianity f.tl.e.
But if it be admitted that they were not thus in!~pired. all they
have written about soul:; amounts to r.o more than if the sarne
bad been written by any other man of thetr age. To enquire
whether a man has a soul or uot is to inquire into the constitu-
tion of man ; and this is a subject that belongs to thai bra••.cb
of physics called phys10lo~y. Strange indeed it is, nry
strange, if the opinions of divines concernin~ the coustituttoa
of man, are to be regarded in prefereuce to the opinious of
physicians.
It may be asked ifChrist did not oncn ~peak as though man
possesses a pout. Wc. grant that those who have written ac-
count& of his birth, death, and doings, have written that he did.
But what then? was Chrilit born into this world, to teach men
physiology? Admitting that .he, though the son of a carpen-
ter's wife, knew every thing and could do almost auy thing, it
does not fotlo.v that be must work a m1racle in ev~ry man's
brain to convince him that he has no soul, or convir.ct: him so
by a long reasoning process. Before the science of cht:mis-
try had taught men that new combinations give rise to new
properties it would have required an octavo volume of great·
er size than this, to convince them that they are composed
entirely of matter. It was an object of -Jesus to make
men believe certain doctrine~ whtch he delivcr~d unto them;
and-it would have operated much against him, to have con·
tradicted an opinion so firmly and universally belie\•ed, as
was the opinion that each man has a &oul in his head : unlm
he convinced the people that this opinion ·is erroneous: a
tllin~ which he could not do, short of working a miracle in
every mau's brain, or of a long reasoning process•.
Now as it was not an object of Jesus to teach men what
they are made of, but to_tcach them their duty towards their
Digitized by GoogIe
•
~faker and towards each other; and to teach them that they
will come to life at some future period, and be punished or
rewarded according to their behaviour bt>fore they die; in-
stead of contradicting their opinions concerning their consti-
tutiOn. he spoke to his hearers in the same language that they
used; he could not otherwise converse wtlh them, Hence
accorrling to Matthew, chap. x, v. 28, he said •· Fear not them
wh1ch kill the body but are not able to kill the soul, but rather
fe11r htm which ts able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
Bnt haJ all his hearers been materialists-none of the lan-
guage of immaterialism bein~ in usc-we may well suppose
he would have ~atd: Fear not them who are able to kill the
body only; but rather fear him who is able to destroy thy
prc;ent existence, and render the future miserable.
:Matthew was undoubtedly an immaterialist ; but Luke
writes more like a rnatenaltst. Luke informs us that Chnst
said : ·• I ~ay unto }OU, my friends, Be not afraid of them that
kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do:
but I will forewarn you whom you shall fear: Fear him, which
after he ha~h killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say
unto you, fear him." Not a word is here said ahout a soul ;
but that Lu~e here had reference to the same saying of Jesus,
that .Matthew. had in the pas~age we have quoted from his
tenth chapter, no one can doubt, after comparin~ together this
chapter of .Matthew and the twelfth chapter of Luke.
We do not know that Luke wal! ft materialist ; but he does
not appear to have been vt:ry friendly to the word soul. lilt
·the whole of his book containing 24 chapters, it occurs in
only four instances; and in only one of these does it appear
that Jesus used it, in an expreFsion strictly his own. In the
first instance, chap. 1, v. 46, it occurs in an expre~sion ofMa-
ry-" And Mary said. My soul doth maguify the Lord." A
very figurative expre11sion this. What ! a woman'• soul mag-
Digitized by GoogIe
- ...........
384
nify God Almighty ? Surely, it can mean nothing more than
that ~he rejoiced and felt that.kful because the '' Lord had re-
garded her low estate." In the second instance, chap. JO,
v. 27, a lawJer tell11 Jesus, •' It is written m tht: law, Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all

This strong but figurative past1age means not bing more than,
you shall love the Lord as n~uch as yon can ; and we defy
any man. be he a necessarian or not, to love him less. In
the tw'!lftlt chapter it is written that Jesus spakc a parable;
and in th1s parable it i!l repre~t:nted th.tt a rich man addressed

of Christ's histprian~ that were voted genuinf', and we had
never seen those oftire other Evangeli:>ts, we @hould bave had
no reason to suppose that Jesus was an immaterialist from
any thing he said concerning ~oul,;. Admitting that Jesus of·
ten spoke of a soul, it is no sort of ~vidence that he beheved
it to be any thing distinct from the body. Scarcely a day
pas11es but that mnterialists Ul't' the word soul or mind aa
though it were something distinct from the body, or at least,
as though rt were something beside~o the body ; aud if, twenty
)'Cars hence, their conversation should be written in a book,
it would be JUSt as much evidenre to future generations that
these materialists were immaterialr~u. as the few clauses ia
the New Testament which repre~~ent that Jes1111 11poke of a
soul, are that he believed in the exitttence ofa feeling think·
ing thing that scuds away from a man when be dres.
Perhaps it may be said that tbc1-e are sayings of Jesua
which favor immaterialism, althou~h they contain nothing
express conct'rning t~ouls. According. to Luke, he said to
one of the malefactors who wat put to death with him: .. Ve-
l'ily I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with me in para-
dise." But what are we to underl4taud hy this ! Do not .the
pronouns I, me, and myself, mean the ~oame thing? and did
not JesuF, bv paradise, here mean heaven, the place to wh•cb
it is said he ascended! the place where hr11 F~tther and the ~tn~
gels dwell ? T he first que!lion JOUSt be an~wered in the affir-
mative, and if the second be not, we wi11h our learned divines

adil!r- be heaven, the place where it is rcJ>resenled that the
God of the hible dwells ; then Ch·ri~t did not go to paradise
for several days after he was crucified. For after he carne
to life, he appeared to his di,;ciples, and said unto them, "-Be-
hold rny hands and my feet, that it is I MYSELF, handle me
and see; lor a spirit hath not flesh and bones, ae ye see me
have.'~ This much to show that Jcsus d1d not consider him-
self as consisting tn something which has not flesh and bones.
(Genuine materialism th1~.) Now accordin~ to J_
ohn, cbnp.
xx. v. 27, Jesus said to Mary," I am not yet ascended to my
F:.ther ;" and this W3!! several days ~fter he was crucified.
From all_ this, it appears that the malefactor, soul nor body,
coul<l not be in paradise wtth Je::.U!! tbc sa1nc day, as it respecb
time, that he was put to death ; for Jesus himself was uot
there. However, the <.hristian materialist ~nds n~ difficulty
in getting along with this : he· says that when a man dies, he
docs indeed die; ofcour11e, if he he in the grave ten thousand
years, it is no time at all to him ;-every man passes from
this hfe to the future in the twinkling of an eye as it respecl8
hitmelj. ·though millious of years ma'y elapse between bill
<\eath and reorganization. Consequently the malefactor will
be iQ paradise the day he died, as it respec~s himself, ~hould
he not be there for thousands of years to come.
What Jesus said in a parahl_e concerning the rich man and
Lazarus, has·been conEidered by some as favoring immateri-
alism. But the nch man died and was buried, and in hell he
lifted up his eyes and saw Lazarus in Abraham's ~osom ; and
cried out to Abraham to let Lazarus come and dip his lingers
in water, and cool his tougue; Now in the name of common
sense, how comes it that an uncxtended soul has eyes and a
tongue in hell ? and why did not the old fellow help bimscJi
to water if it were hJndy -? and how large must Abraham~s
bosom be to boJu Lazarus? We should tbiuk the immaterial-

ists had better keep this pass1ge in the back ground, if they
do not wish to be puzzlt;d.. Will they tell us that wh~n the
so.ul quit~ the body and goe11 to heaven or bell, it becomes ex·
tended, and has the parts of a man? Let them say so ; but
this would be nothin~ more nor less than creating a material
man out ofan immatcrial--uolhing !-The christian material-
ist may admit, if he pleases, that when men die, men of like
sensorial tendencies are instantly-as it respects timc-or-
gani;,~:ed in ~ome distant region ; but why, then, the "resur-
rection of the dead,'' which is certainly the most important,
and we should think an essential doctrine of christianity? fs
there going to be two sets of human bei.ngs preci'sely alike ?
Methinks there would be much contention if they should ever
get together; and perhaps some mistakes among the men and
women! .
Immediately after noticing the third instance in which the
word soul occurs ip Luke, we meant to have remarked that
the same Greek word which is tran~lated soul in the New
Testament, i3, in as much as thirty instances in this Testa·
ment, translated life.
'fhus much have we written to show that materialism is
consistent with christianity, We shall now proceed to show
that immaterialism is not consistent with christianity ; after
which we trust all will be convinced that materialism.is at
lea6t as consistent with christisnity as immaterialism.
As intimated in the fore part of th•s chapter, we shall not
decide dogmatically what c.hri11tianity is; for this would be
to decide a ctuestion concerning which the different sects cal-
ling themselves christianA, are a~ war. It would be to decid-=
a que!ltioo in which we do not feel at all interested :-we can
only say, we wish those do~trines the least success which
make men the worst neighbors and citizeas, We proceed
according to our own notions of christianity.

According to our vi~ws, the doctrine of the resurrection of

aequer.tly, whot Vt>r do(•s not helu ve in lh•s, 11 not strictly a

many virtuouto men bt-fore the chrr~tian t'fa; perhaps more in
proportion to the whole human family and their unenlighten·
ed litate than there now are.
Now tf the doctrine of the resurrertion of the dead, he es-
aeutial to <'hr•stianity, then is immaterialism, or the dottriue
ofsoul, r.ltogether at ~ariancP. ·with christianity. For acc:or-.
ding to this doctrine, the n~au never dies; that thinking, feel-
ing being which r.onstitute11 the man-that being, m the same·
Desl' of which the immaterialists place personal identity, nel·er
dies. To be eure it qu•ts its old material tenement, but tbiJ
is nothing but changi,,g it11 place. Tlwrefore the many passa·
ges in the New Testament which t~pt'ak of a man d} ing, and
of his resurrec;ttoo from the dead-an exemplificahou of
which we have in the death and resurrection of Jesus-are
diametrically ~pposed .to immaterialism.
Is not dt>ath Fpokt•n of all a slnp, that is an uncon,cious state?

must be re-organized because there is no future existence
without it; and it is the body tha~ 1s punished ana rewarded,
for it is the body that acted-acted as independently as any
thing can that is governed by the laws of pature. He says
the body rnay be organized out of any matter, for•all that ·is
necessary to constitute the same person, to all intents and
purpo11es, is to ha,·e the same looking body, possessing the
same sensorial tendencies.
It is a little curio!Js that materialists must be cried down
by some christians, when they maintain tbc only doctrine con-
cerning the constitution o.f man, that can be made to hannQ-
nize with christianity.
Christianity is not to be proved or disproved by our deci-
sion concerning the nature of that which thinks, unless the
doctrine ofsoul be essential to christianity. The pre!'entwriter
was a firm materialist y~ars before he liisbclievcd so many
of the christian doctrines, that it would he hypocrisy ql him
to pretend to believe in r.hristianity. But he now feels the
same _moral obligations towards his. fellow creatures that he
ever did, and'is much more happy in hit thoughts concern-
ing death and a future existence, than forme~ly.-Oh tr.uth !
Thtm art fair and lovely ; there is symmetry in all thy parts ;
and he that knows thee, is not cold and hot, .hoi and coM,
alternately ;--he is not distressed with fears and doubts at
one time. and -1lushed with expectations of unnatural joys at
another. Thou causest peace in one's own breast, peace in
neighborhoods, and peace between nations. .Blood may be
shed in the cause of the adversary ; but thou wilt ultimat~ly
coru1uP.r with no other weapon than the pen!
Before closing this chapter, we make some extracts from a
pamphlet which we have recently reeeived, entitled '' Tn£
ScRIPTURE DocTRINE oF MATERIALHiM." It is written by a
masterly pen; but the author is to be reprehended by every ·

friend of Iruth and intellectual freedom, for not putting his
name to it. In making these extracts, we shall not add any
words of our own except in brackets, and the authors own
words will not appear in the form of quotations, that the read-
er may the more easily understand what words are his, and
what tire words of writers from whom he makes extracts.
After this, can it be said, that the separate existence of an
immortal soul is the doctrine ofChrist? I am lost in utter as·
tonishment at the presumptuous hardihood that can !!late this
doctrine as an essential article of the christian faith ! at the
impudent intolerance that can cry down a man's character
and standing in society-can intertlict him like the bani~hed
of old, from fire, water and shelter-because examining Scrip-
ture for him~elf, he cannot cons~icntiously accept as di~·iAe
truth, the metaphysical revenes of Calvinistic theology!
The question is not, is there any tc:d in the bible that seems
to countenance the notion ofa t1oul;.(for the b1hle was trans·
J;,tcd by pcrsous who took tha! doctrine for granted ;)-the
que.~tion i~. what is the general tenor of the doctrine on the
snbjt:>ct laid down· by Jc:tus Christ : does he countenance it?
The apostles wrote and $_poke verJ 6guratively, and frequent•
ly in ronformity aud altusion to the previous notion~ of those
they were add1essing. To establish the doctrine of a soul as
a Christian doctnue. do not refer m·e to a few tells that seem
to countenance it .i you must shew it me plainly, clearly, and
undoubtedly laid down, explained, and urged by Cbrist him-
Relf: and that I think cannot IJe done from the Evangelists.
All else is evidence so inferior as to have little weight on the
question.
All persons conversant with the Scripture, know, that the
v!ir10us and discordant tenets of metaphysical Christianity are
founded, a~serted. and denied on the license of figurative ex-
pressil)fl used by the apolltles, a~d principally by St. Paul.
In this war of words I desire to take no part, and I therefore
appeal exclusively to the gospels.

assurllnce of a future existence than what they have in tbe
New Testament. The doctrine of re:'lurrection is thereio
clearly and expressly avowed ; and if any one want any ful"'
ther evidence of n future exietence than what he hat in tbit
te,;!ament, it is clear that he does not firmly believe in tbe
christian religion. Yet there are 1onu who would be glad to
find evidence of thi~ pleasing doctrine in the book of nature•
.And at~ there can be no harm in believing in a future slate,
even if the1e never.will I.e any such state, prm~idul se&cb be·
liefdo not prov~ a c:wse of le!!s happinees or more misery in
thi!!life than we should otherwise experience, we shall glellD
what evidence we can from the book of nature in favor of it.
Perh11ps we l>hall remove doubts and fe&l'll concerning a ·fu-
ture state, as much by showing there is no evidence againat
suc;h state, ashy advancing all the arguments we can in favor
of it. Tlull then will be our irst object.
- - - - - Really, we know not what to tray-we seem
to lack idea!!; we cannot think of any thing which any mao
is shor~sighted enough to bring for.vard as an argument againd
a future state of existence. We thmk we have shown· cor·
rectly and satiafar.torily what personal identity consists in;
and if we have, such d1fficulties as might arise before it was
satisfactorily &bown what penooal identity consists in, will not
oow be urgt:d. According to our views it is ofno consequence
wh~tt becomes of the matter which composes- our bodies at the
time we die. It matten not if the 1ame identical matter com-
pose a thousand human bod.es io ~uccession. at the time they
die. We t~ay all that is necessary to constitute the aame per•
son, to all intents a1.d purposes, is a like looking body, with
likt> sensorial tendencres, organized out ofan!J matter. And oo
one who believes in a God, will d011bt his power to re-organ-

izcd, i:~ no evidence that such men will not hP re-org1111ized
at 1ome future period; but 1fmen who died at !lome former pe·
riod, bad yet been re-organized to our certain knowlt'dge, it
would be some nidenc:e to us, that otherdead men will be re·
organized. However, the lack of this evidence for a future
existence, is no evi6fence again.t it. Suppose a man should be
born in the 11ummf:r, possessing as good a share ofknowledgr u
.any other man, except what is acql1ired by esperienciug the
changes ofseasoDt; would sucb man, in a few da.)S or wef'kS,
judge from what he had esperienced that there will be a win·
ter 1 would he judge there will be short days, long n•ghts7
freezing weather and snow upon the: grom1d? He certainly
would not.-judging only from what he had witnessed-put-
ting human testimony aside-he would say there will be. only
warm days, longer than the nights, and the surface of the
earth will be covered w1th green vegetables-. Yet his ha,·mg
never experienced a winter and his judging tbere will never be
such a sea110n, would be no evidence that there will be no win-
ter. So our having never witnessed a re ·org-c~nization of per-
t.Jns who formerly existed, and all our lack of belief tbat men
will be re-organized, are oo sort or evidence tbat tbey never
will be. ·
Ten, fifty, or an bumlred tbou&and years, compared with
eternity, ·are u a moment compared with an age. The world
is yet in its infancy ; it has but just be&an to be 1 but a 5mall
part of it is yet brought into a atate of cultivation; men have
not yet a~rived to the highest degree of perft:ction that their
present natures adm1t of; they are grossly ignorant and su•
pen~titious compared with what they w•ll be in a few centu·
ries after intellectual freedom i" obtamed. These things con·
sidered, we are very far from having any reason to suppose

state nf things would b,e put, by this time. if it were the iotea-
tion of the Almighty that they ever will be. .
Now if there be no evidence against a future state ; and i(
we were to admit that there is no ev1dence in favor of it, the
question as to our future existence would come under the
common head of, It may be so, or, It may not. It would be a
qu<>stion concerning which we mu ~t be opinion·nentt'r, there
betng no evidence Jor nor against. But if any evidence in
fa\ or of a future state car! be adduced, then have weo so much
reason to believe in a future t~late. That some such evidence
can he gleaned from tbe book ofnature, we shall uow allempt
to show.
We find that every thing-unless we exrept man-appean
to be formed for something be)'ond its present exi~tence, for
eome other purpose than merel) that it may exist. By mt>an1
of the heavenly bodies, the sun, earth, &c. vegetablE's exist ;
vegetables give support to animals ; one animal is auhservi·
ent to another, this to another, and so on, up to man. Now
are we to say that man who is buried six feet below the sur-
face of the earth, is an exception to this rule ?• and are we to
suppose that the exi!tence of man in this life, is the highest
and ultimate o~ect ofGod 1 Is the God of nature a God that

bis w:l) s of bringing about this hat•piness. or, if you please, of
increasing it, is to first teach men what misery is-tcacb
them by experience, the only way in which they can be

CHAPTER XXXH.
On Ilwnan Happineu, Good and E.,;il, Moralily, 4rc:
Human happinen coNSISTS in agreeable couscient ar.tiona
of the nervous system of human beings,-be these actions,
actions of tbe·organtc and cerebral e:dremitiea of the nervea
atone ; or of nerves and the sensorium together ; or of the
sensorium alone. When these actions take place only in
the organic and cerebral extremities of nerves, tbey consti•
tute agreeable sensalions ; when 'they takt: place in oervea
and the sensorium to&ether, they constitute agreeable perctp•
lior" ; and when tl:iey take place in the sensorium alone, they
constitute agreeable thoughts.
That portion of happin~;.ss which consists in agreeable sen·
aatiuni and perceptions, is generally called pleasure. As
all sensatio01 and perceptions are a higher degree ofconscioua·
Dess than mere sensorial actions or thoughts ; that portion
or happine88 called pleasure is more vivtd than mere senso•
rial happ;ness. But in proportion as it is mere vivid, its du·
ration it more transient ; for it is attended witb a greater
wear and t~ar of the system, which wear and tear not only
disenables-t~e systc!m for being the subject of agreeable con-
scient actions, but often gives rise to conscient actions of a
diff~rent -ar.d opposite nature, constituting misery.-NercotU
ltappineu or pleasure is like the ftash of shaving~ ; but senso·
rial happiness, like tbe burning of coal, is leaa vivid a11d mora
permanent.
The CAUSES of happiness may be divided into two.clat~se•,
i•mediate and remolt. !fhe im~e(liate causes are impre&•
sions upon the senses and sensorial tendencies ; the latter are
causes orsensorial happiness, the former ofnervous happiness,
or pleasure. The remote causes of happiness are very nu-
merous and varied: whatever conduces to our health is ef
this class; and what people mean by honor, wealth, power,
&c., belongs to this class of causes ; thougb, i11de~d, we are
not so happy in postessio& these things as we are in the act of
obtaining tb~:m.

ottruction of the instrument, and the manner of ueing it, thia
mischief ofieu happens. But if you had occaeion to deieribe
instruments of torture or execution, this, you would aay, i!l to
dislocate thejoin~; this to breAk the bones; this to scorcb the
soles ofthe feet. Here pain and misery are tile very objut1 of
the contrivance. N«»w nothing ofthis sort is tobe found in the
works of nature. we never discover atrain ofcontrivance
·to bring about an evil purpose. No anatomist ever discov-
ered a system of organization calculated to produce pain aod
·disease ; or; in explaining the parts of the human body, ever
said, this is to irritate ; this to inftame ; this duct iJI to coo-
vey the gravel to the kidneys ; tbis gland to ser.rete the ha·
mour which forms the Jl:Out. If by chance he come at a part
of whic-h he knows not the use, the mo&t he can say i~. tbat it
is useless ; no one ever suspects that it is put there to iucom-
mQae, to annoy, or to torment. Since then God hath called
forth his consummate wisdom to contrive and provide for our
happinesa, and the world appears to have been constituted
with this design at lirst, !!O long a~ this constitution is uphold-
en by him, we must in rea~on suppose the same design to coo·
tinue." ·
But we are not altogether satisfied with the learned Doc-
tor's reasoning. When he speaks ofour happiness and misery
in the first sentence of the preceding quotation, we wisb he
bad informed us whether, when God created the human spe·
c:ies, h~ wished them to be totally happy or totally miserable;
or only as happy as we are and as miserable as we are. If
this last be his meaning, we can agree with him,-we can ad·
mit that when God created the human species, be intended

But if he mean perfect happiness and perftcl misf'ry, then we
have two things to say. First, as we are somewhat happ1
And somewhat miserable, "God hath called forth hi11 consum-

vain ;-he is not almighty, he cannot accomplish even his
own wishes and designs. Second, this sentence of Paley,
thougt. advanced as i( it were a eelf.evident propo!ition, ia
very fitr from being such. Jf God neither wished our perfect
happiness, nor perfect mi~;ery, it does not follow that t.e '~ wu

about either. 'tVe should Aot say this-we should say be

ju~t what tbe .!Jlmighty wished it to be when be "called forth
bis consummate w1sdom" an creating the universe, of which
m~m is a part.
Paley remarks that the world abounds with contrivances,
but among the whole there is not one contrivance ofnature's
God for the express purpose of producing misery ; and this
be thinks is sutfic•cnt evidence that God wills thefbappiness
of mankind. But Paley does oot •eem to come to the point
concerning thia matler.-AII misery is confined to the ner-
Yous system ; it is a d11agreeahle consciousness-a dlsar.ree-
able con11cient action of tbe brain, or of the brain and nerves-
together ; and the qne1tion is, d•d· be who is the Author of
our beiog, and of all thing:$ around, so constitute the nervous
system that disagreeable conscient actions may be excited in
it; and has he created any things which are capable of exci·
ting these actions? lfso, then he is the author of our misery
in thf' same s.
ense he is' the author of our happiness. There
may be more things which give us plcat~ul"e, than there are
that give us pain-though few if any things are created ex·
pre!lsly and exclus•vely for either-and mau may be the su.b-
Ject of much more lutppine!ls than misery ; but there is notb·
ing under bt>aven wlucb lltgues that God wi~hed the pt:rfect
happiness of mankind. Ou the contrary, Wl' have sufficient
reason to believe that he is able to render us perfectly happy,
and to accomplish every thing he wishes to, notwithstandiog
all the bra1o-begottcn devil& that be.-We shall show present•
Jy why many deists and believers in a supernatural religioo
arc so loth to admit that He. who is the Author of our nature,
arid of all thintr around, is the Author of our miaery, in tbe
same sense be is the Au&hor of our happiness.
The words Good and EtJil, like a11 other word!l, are ofhu·
mao invention. They atre both general terms. Every thing
which 1s productive of human happinet-!1, is good ; every thing
which is productive of human misery, is evil. All things are

Now as it i~ not known that our conduct in this life, will
have any inil•Jeuce •m our happiness hereafter, we th.nk it
proper to COJHIIder morality and reli~•on a~ two distinct things
-the oue a~ having relation to· our happine11s irl thita hfe, the
othf'r as consisting of doctrines aud speculations .concerning
~ur future ex•stcut·e. Rerig10n may •:oncur with moralil}, or
include it, as one thing include~ another; but st•ll the.v are dis·
stinct things, and a man may be moral rf not religious, and re·
ligious (according to our definition of religion) if not moral.
He may believe and profest. to believe certain doctrine,., opi-
mons, ~tatements, &c.; and yet he may not ac.t in conformity
to tho~e principle!> wluch are, or are believed to he, productrve
of happ111es~ in this life. If religion be nothing but morality,
then is it nothing better or worse than morality; but if it
be something besides morality, then is it something distinct
from 1t.
Acoording to these views. if it be a religiom doctrine that
certain couhes in this life are necf's~ary to our happiness in
.the future; theu,.as the future will be 1nfiuitely longer in du-
ration than the present, whoever beiJe,·es such doctrine acts
consistent wrth his belief in pursuing such courses and in Rtriv-
ing to ha"e oth~rs pursue them. even if he sacrr6ce all world·
ly enjoyments and renclt>r all around him unhapp) in doing so.
The glcmou~ end he has 111 v1cw just1fies the mean1. h is
purrha~ing a pearl of great worth, without any thrng like aa
erptivalent-he mortifies the flesh to be sure, hut then it i11 to
ensure the everlasting happi11e11s of the •• soul.'' which is as
great a reward as the mo;;t ~el6•h m>~n could a11k.
But the mere mora I man auns at. the happiness of the hu-
man fam•ly (inrlud111g him!lelf of eour.u·) 111 this hfe; and do•
ing what he can to reuder his own days loug and happy. aa

~ood purpose, will deal mercrfully with h•m 111 a future state
of e1.1stence. But to return to the cousider>ttion of virtue.

ou~ht we to obey the will of God ? But in this case, the hi~
est induc:ement to perform a certain deed-that which renden
it obligatory on us to pt-rform it-1s the con~equent happmess.
Should any one pre~ume to say, that the Alm1ghty is pleas-
ed at some of our action!', and.di~pleased at othen;, and that
we ought to perform r.ertain actions becansc they please the
Almighty ; then happiness would be the eud and inducement
of performing such 11ctions : the happ111eBs however would be
thwt ofthe Oeity-de1sllcal happines!!', instead ofhuman. But
we can hardly brmg ourselvet~to ~ay that the happiness ofthe
Almighly il' at all dependent oo the dependent worms of his
creation.
We do not believe in acts ofdismterested benevolence ;-
we believe it would be contrary to the laws of volit•on for a
mRn to do a 'Doluntary act which he does not desire to do: and
to gnttify a desire is to grat1(v self. Those who maiutr.io
that we often do acts of kiudues~ without am· seltirn motl\·e,
rely much on .the fact that we often flJ to the relief of a fel·
)ow creature in distres5 before we have had time to reflect oo
the e;ood that will result to us from doing so. But the ad\'o•
, ·c:ah!~o .of the sellish sy5tem may reply, that the 11u.::ce~~iou of
thnughts.is so rapid, that it IS impossible for any to ~ay, w1tb
~ertainty, that we ever fty to the relief of any one on !lt'eing
him in distress, before we have had time to think over several
thoughts. They may say, also, that we have- previously
found out that it gives u11 pleasure to help one in distress-
that it causes such one to feel grateful towards us, and we feel
well in knowmg that one feelto grateful towa1 ds us. Conse-
quently when we see a per~on in d1stress,tbere 11 no more need
of our stopping to consider whether it will be conducive to
our happiuP.~s to help h•m, than there is of our stopping to
consider whether we had better e:s:ert ourselves to prevent
onr falhng into the fire, wheh we are in danger of 1t. Agam,
it may be said, that owi.-.g to the principle of as~or.iat1on, it
gives us disagreeable con~ciousness to s~c a fellow being io
di~tress; and by g1ving him relief we relieve this disa~reea­
ble consciousness, that is, rendu ourselves more happy, or if
you plea11e, less miserable.
We do not say that we alwavs think of self, any more than
we think of the king of England, when we 6y to the relief of

do a voluntary act whu~h we ha\·e no de~•re to do.-lf to
maintain th1t he to maintain a selfish system of moralit), then
we maintain such sy..tt>m.
But although w.e do not believe in ar.t11 ofdi~intf'rested be·
nevolt-nce, (u11i•1g thE>se terms in a !ltrtct ph1'osos•h•cal Ft'll!le,)
still we would uot Fay it i11 rig/at for a man to perform R <'er•
iain act10n-thRt he ought to perform it_-that it is virfWJtU
in him to perform 1t ; hecaU!lf' by performing it he increases
h1s tJllln h11ppine!ls solely ; and e<~pecially if he incre..se tl at
the expense uf another'~' happint•ss. But we say an action is
virtuous-is an action which the a-gent ought to perform-is
an action, for pcrfnrmi11g which ttl~ ~~~ent ito meritorious, when
in the long run and broad run it inrrea"ett the sum of human
bappine11s more than it increRsell the FUm of human misery.
Perhaps it will be asked if a man ought to do an 11ct which
renrlrl'tl hirmclf less happy, provided by dom~ 11~ he render
two or more as much more happy as he doe!' htmself less.
To this we answer, he is under no higher obligahou to do eo,
than be.. is to practice virtue. We t:hould not call him vi·
cious-we should not call him a producer of misery-•f he did
not perform such act ; hut he wo•tld be virtuou11 if he dtd. As
it bappena. the nature of things it' such that a man very, sel-
dom renderto him~elf les!l happy by rendermg others more ~o,
provided he act ~ith the 1nteution of doing what he thinks is
right-what he thinks will be produrti.ve of more happiness
than misery in the lon~ run and broad run. A man may reo·
der a highwayman more happy by assisting him to escape jus•
tice, and may bring misEry upon himst>lf by doing so ; but he
does not do what he thinks is right when he doPs thi11; that
is, if he know the h1ghwaymRn to be such : but if he do not,
law does not require hirn to be punished for the act.-Let us

CHAPTER XXXIII•
.11 Bnif Sketch ofthe Opinions ~f sereral .llncient and ModeNJ.
Philosupltl'rs, conctrT'.ing the Con~titution and Phmomn/4 of
Man : Givw partlyfor th.t purprm of" shnwing that the Hy-
rmthesis of Suul ga1;e ris~; to ihe Sceptical Philosophy of
Berkley and Hume.
I do not know that any ancient philosopher ever ques-
tioued the ex1stcnr:e of something which the word suul may
with propriety be u~ed to ~;ignify : it appears that all took the
existence of some such thing for granted. But thfly thought
differently concerning itil nature, and speculated not a little
concernins; the wr.y and manner in wh1ch it i~ affected by ex-
ternal objects. Somt• maint11ined that it is of a spiritual. and
others that it is of a material nature. Those who held that it
is material, disputed to"' hich ofthe four elem~uts tt belongs ;
whether to earth, air, fire, or water. Some held that it coo-
sists 111 part of all the!le element,; ; and that tt perceives earth
bJ the earthly part; water by the watery part ; aud firt·, by
the fiery part of the soul.
"The most spiritu<JI and suhlime notion," says Dr. Reid,
" concerning the nature of Ill(' soul, to be met with among
the ancient phllo~ophers, I rol!cetve to bt' thut of lhf' Piato-
ni~Is. who held that it il' made of that ct>lc:@tial and incorrup·
tible maltu f)( which tht• fiud !'tar!' were made, and there·
{ore has a naturaltc·ttdc•tt<.y to rejoin its propc·relement."
From th1s it appears that the most •· spiritual" notion of
the attc1ent philo~ophcr" cottcc·ruiug the nature of the soul,
is. that it i!l made of " mallt'r !" and of nflltter too, as gross
perhaps as that of which tlti~ earth ill formed.
"It mn~t bt' obvious," Ray~ Dr. Good, in his Book ofNa·
ture, vol. 2, ·• tl at there cwver ''• nor can be, auy dtrect com·
munir.ation between the mind and the external objt•cts the
nund perceives, which are usually, indeed, at some distance
{rom the sense that gives notice of them. Thus. in look111g
at a tree, it is the eye alone that really beholds the tree,
while the mind ouly receives a notion of its presence, by
aome mean!! or othet, from the visual organ. What theu is

the brain, to have a corrE>spondent per<"eption of the forrn,
· 1ize, colour, smell, and even distance of ot~jects with the sen•
ses wnich are seated on the surface of the body ; and which,
at. tht'! same tim*' it conVCJS this mformatton, prod•tces sucb
an additional effi~ct t.hat the miud is able at its optioll to re-
vive the perception, or call up an exact notion or idea of
these qualities at a di!itant period, or when the objects them•
seive:o arc no longer present ?"
•• The princtpal SJSlcms that were 11tarted among the phi·
)o!!ophers of Greece lo explain the origin and value of human
knowledge, "ere those of Pl11to, of Ari~totle, of Epicurus,
and of the sceptics. especially 1'.)trho and Arresilas ; and the
princ1pal systems to wh1ch ttwy have g•ven birth in later
times. are thost of Dea Cartee, Locke, Ber~ lE-y, Hume, Hart•
ley, Kaut, and the Scl'tttsh school or Common Sense, at the
bead of which we are to place Dr. Reid.
'' I halll ot:casion to ob11erve, in our fir!lt 11eriE's of lectures,
that it was a do~ma common to many of the Greek tchooll,
that matter, though essen!ially eternal, is also, in its prtmlll
and •imple state, esSentially amorphous, or destitute ofall
forrn and quality t»hale'otr; [we can as readily admit that
1uch matter is eternal, all that nuthing •s eternal ;] and I fur-
ther remarked, that the gro•md-work of this dogma consi!ltecl
in a belief that form and quality are the contrivance of an in·
tellige••t agent; while matter, though essentially eternal, ie
essenttally unintelligent. Matter, therefore. it w11s cont~nd­
ed. Clutnot po11sibly assume one mode of form ntther than
another mode ; for if it were t"apable of 8$SUmin~ any kind,
it mu~t have been capable of a~lluming every kiud, and of
cour~e of exhibttiug intelligent effects without any intelligent
cause.
" Fonn, then; according to the Platonic 11chools, in which
tbi~ was priucipally taught, exillting di11tiuct from matter hy
the mere will of the Great Fir~I Cau!le, presented itl!elf, from
all eternity, to his wtsdom or logos, in every possible vanety;
or, in other words. Ul!dcr at\ iutinite multiplicity of IIICOrpo•

which the founder of thi11 11chool gave the name of ima1; a

to favor the OIHIIIOn that he did uot consider an idea as any
thiul{ dit'tlllct j(l}m the mmd.
"l'he other wav of retention, is the power to revive again
in our minds tho!le ideas, whkh after imprmting have disap·
peared, or have bec;n as it were laid aside out of stght ; and
thi~ we do, when we conceive heat or hght, yellow or @Weet,
the o~ject bemg removed. Thts is memory, wh1ch is, as it
were, the sfote·house of our ide.ts. For the narrow mind of
mau no: being capable of having many ideas under view and
Ullosideratton at onfe, 1t was necetsary to have a repository
to ht.) up those ideas, wh1ch at another tirnf' it mi~ht have use

Ou the whole. it appears to us that Locke con1idered ideas
as !'Omethwg dtstinct from the mind-if oot picturel! or images
of things-l'ometh•ug whwh wt> acquire by way of our seuHlS
or by •• rt"fh:ct1ou ;" but still when they are not perceivf'd1
wllen they are "laid a10ide as it wt>re out of sight,'' and oot
"under view and consideration," they are something so uuhke
ide:l3 iu the mind's presmce chamber, that tht·y cannot properiJ
be eallf'd 1deas; for an idea. as he has defined it, is "wl-.atever a
man t>hs(•rves and is consciutu to himl'elf he has in his mind;"
const'quenlly as tdeas •· the_v are no when·,"-'' ideas ceasing
to be any flung (to the o.an thllt pos~esses them) •htn they

At any rclu:, tf Locke did not couaider ideas as something

'• Is not," says Sir INSac Ne"ton. "the sen11orium ofanimals
the place where the sentient substance is prt:t>cnt; and to whtr.h
sensihle sp~cies ofthings are brought, throuJ;?;h the nerve~ :.nd
brdin, that there they may be perceived by the mind pre'lent
in that place?" Aud say!' Dr. Clark, m one of h1!l letters to
Lt-ibnitz-" Without being pre~ent to the ima~es of thu.gs
perceived, the soul could not pos~ibly perceive them. A liv-
ing substance can only there perceive, where it 1s p~~ent.
Nothing can any more act, or be acted upon tohtre it i• Hot
present than it can when it is not p•e~eut." Sa)s Dr. Por-
ter~field -" How body acts upon mind or rn111d upon body, I
kuow not; but this I am very certa111 of, that noth111g cau act,
or be acted upon, where it is not; and tht'refort·, our mind
can never perceive any thing but Ill' own proper modifica-

present: 110 that •t is not the ellterual !lun and moon which are
in th<· heavens, which our m111d perce1ves, but only their
image ()r reprcsentatiou, impressed upouthe sen!lorium. How
the soul of a seewg malt sees these images, or how it receives
those ideas, from ,ucb ,llgitat•ons in the sen~orium, I know not;
but I am sure it can uever perceive the exteral bodies them-
selves, to which it is not pn•sent." •• The slightest philoso-
phy," saJ s Mr. Home, •• tcache:- us. that nothmg can ever be
pre&cnt to the mind, but an image or perception ; aud that the
senses are only the inlets through wh•ch these imagPsare con-
veyed; without being able to produce auy immedtate inter-
course between the mind and the object. The table which
we ~etl seems to d1minish. as we remove farther from it: hut
the real table which eststs independent of U!l, sutfcfl' no alter-

brain, for to say notbin~ of its size, and the velocity witb
which it must move, it cannot be in but one brain at a time-
yet million11 may t~ee the sun at the same instant; consequent-
ly the necessary contlusion is, that when the soul perceives
an ohject, something passe11 fro m the ot.ject into the brain, to
be present to the soul-a someth111~ which by different philo·
sophers has been called by the different names of idea, phan- •
tasm, species, image, and Impression. But hy whatever name
it be called, it is that which is present to the sou l when it per-
ceives ; and indeed it is the only thmg that the soul does per-
ceive; though for convenience sake, we say we perceive the
object which j!"iVes it off.
Thu~ we see that the hypothesis of soul gave rise to the
hypothesis of ideas or images, as things distinct from the per-
Cl•iving soul and the exterual objects said to be perceived.
Now says Mr. Hume, we have no evidence at all, and
never can have any, that any thing more exi~ts than the per-
ceiving thing, and the image~ or iolpressions perceived. We
tal" about the sun, moon, and other object!! without us, but
we can have no evidence that there are any such things-
we do not see them, we do not feel therri-the seeing, feeling
thing perceives notiJing bnt images or impressions, which may
-for aught auy one Cllll say to the contrary-exist indepen·
dent of any thing more gross and substantial; and it is quite
beneath a ph•losopher to admit the existence of any thing of
which there is no evidence. Indeed, Mr. Hume did not
stop here; but so far as I can learn from other authors, his
train of reasoning proceeded thus :-As to the existence of
matter or body, it is entirely out of the question, it is what no
rea~onable man or philosopher can possibly think of contend-
ing for. There is nothing in nature but mind and perceptioos
of mind-pertepiions diver~ilit·d, indeed. by being sometimes
stronger, and sometimes we;tker, and which may on this ac·
count be properly distinguished hy thP. 1111mes of impres~ions
and ideas. But how do Wt: know ~hat there is any mmd-
how d• we know that there is any thing but impressious and
ideas ? This is t'he utmost we can kuow, and even this we can-
not know to a certainty: for no body but fools will pretend
certainly to know or beheve any thmg. The~e ideas and
impressions follow each other. and are thcrPfore coujoincd;
but we have no proof that there is any m·ce~~ary .-onnexion
between th~m. They are a "bundle of perceptions" that sue·.

d Refutation ofProfe.osor Stewart's Argumentfor the ezistmcc
ofSoul or Mind.*
" The notions we anne'!t to the word~ mattf'r and mind, as
is well remark•·d by Dr. RPid, arc merely relative. If I am
a~ked what I mean hy matter, I can o·nly explain myself by
taying it is that which i~ exltmded. figured, coloured. movea-
ble, hard, soft, rough or smooth. hot nr cold-that i!!, I can
dt·611e it in no other way than by enumerating its sensible
qualities. It is not matter or body whi~;h I perceive by my
senses ; [f;o said ~fr. Burne !] but only ext~n~ion, figure, co-
lour, and <.ertain other qualities, which the conslitulion tifmy
nature [rather an ambi15uoo~ t'Xpre~sionl IE'ads me to refer to
somethmg that i~ extended. figured a..d coloured. Thf ca!le
is preci~t>ly the same with re~perf to mind. We are not im-
mediately ro11~ciou~ of ••~ existence ; but we are conscious

-same evidence of the ex•stPIICP. of mmd, that we have of the
existence of mattcr,-nuy, iftbere bt- any d•tfcrcnc;e between
the two cases. that we have stronger evidence for it, ioaa.
m1.u.h as the one [the mmd] is t~ugge&ted to us by the 1ubject1
ofour tonsciousmss, and tbe other merely by the object11 of
our perceptions.''
Well, reader, what do you think ! You mur1t know that al•
most all men whose opinion!> concerning the su~ject are of
much weight. {I mean phyt~.ologtsts,) are decidedly of the
opinion that thcre is no such mmd in (:xistence as Stewart
•l'eaks of; and yet of the two, it is rather more ev1der.t that
there i:1, than that there is any tlung without our skulls,-we
are taught so by the constitution tifour nutures.
It appears very dear to mc. that wheu professor Stewart
wrote the forego•ng pas10ages, he did not think of every thu.g.
that relatetl to tlw subject ; or t-lse he was endeavoring-and
k11owmgly too-to ~upport a fcehle cau~e hy 110phistry. He
is all wrong,-so completely so, I scarcely know where to
bt-gm with h•m.
I define matter, a combination o{'properlits :-take from
any kind of malte.r, the prop•·rty of exteu~tan and impenetra·
bility. and every othet propert) that may be presf!nt, and no.
thiug.would remain. A11..i he tha1 a~sert~ thai matter is some
un~nown th111g du1t111Cl fwm the propt:rl ie!l wb1ch tt ts satd to
posl!ess, asserts tl.at, 111 support of which there is not the least
ahadolW of evidence,-we def)· hirn to hrto~; the lea11t tittle.
But Stewart says that he rrm dcfiue maHer in no other way,
thau hy saying tl is that which i" extt>ndt~d, figured, coloured,
moveable, hard, soft, &c. Well, then, let us take thill ddi·
nition of matter-let it he remcmhered that whatever is eX•
tended, fi~ured, moveable. &c. is matter. Now Stewart ad·
mits I hat he can perceive exten,;ion, figure, colour, hardness,
&c. by his senses, aud yet say& he caonot perceive matter!*
1~ not this-I seroously ask-i~ not this a mere quihble ? Yea,
to be sure, the existence of a !IOUI to be proved by a quibble.

Stewart may speak for himself, and I will ~peak for myseiC.
For my own part, lam not led by the constitution of my na·
ture, lo consider that b·ing which I call m.,yse~f, as something
distinct from my body ; :111d I have a" shrewd su~pidon" that
my readers will say ·the ~ame for them~t·tves. If so, it will
appear that the constitution of Stewart's nature is rather an
odd one.
As to m_y,tlf being impaired by the los5 or m'ntilation of
any of my organs." I f!raut that the loss of my toes or my
e11rs would not destroy m_y per~onal identity, or my belief

ago; hnt I have a very •hr.-wd ~~~~picion that that paTt of me

the man who is C.ODSCiO•JS; or is it the action of the sensorium
··which COII!~titutes the consciousnes~; or is it the e:demal ob-
jr.ct which first exc1ted this action?
Exceptio" thf'se three thmg!t, I defy any man to show that
it can be any thing at ·all. ·Now we cannot suppose that
• Stewart believed that a man's hntin is the subject of his con-
sciousness for his brain is one subject. but Stewart speaks of
1uhjtcts. , If we say that the conscient action of the brain ie
• the 11ubject of the man's corMciousnes~. thf'n the same thin'
~ot only constitntcs consciou!lness, but is the mhjtct of con-

precise things that are the "objects o( our perceptions," in
' • almost all case11. And I must \!onfess that a stone, or any
th;ng else which I think about. ~;oes as far in convincing me
that I have a soul or mind, as the simple act of thinki· g.
In th111 place I may notice an an<•cdote wbich I ouce saw
in the Botton Recorder-.an anecdote 10 which there is no-
thing 11olid but something 1.1pecious-though I have reaaon to
- think that somf' shHrt-sighted pt~ons thought it contatned an
irrefragable repartee. I can only rt'latc it 11s I can remember
it. It Wll& in sub8tanc:e as follows:-·
A phvsician asked a methodit~t preacher if he ever saw a
soul? Nu. Did you ever hear a ~ooul t No. Did you eYer
taste a !IOUI ? No. D1d you e~er smell a soul? No. Did
you evf'r feel a soul? Yes. Well, says the physician, thPre
are four evrdenc~:s a~ainst one that there il' no soul. S11id
the preacher in his turn. D1d you ever see a pain? No. Did
you Pver hear a pain? No. DrJ you ever. taste a pam? No.

Yea. Well, says the preacher t.hl're Are four evidences
· againf;t one that there is no pain, yet you know there is pain,
. and I know •here is a soul.
We here see that too preacher commits the same bluntler
that StPwart has dour; he not onlv t11kf's consciousne!tii as
proof that consciou!lne~s exi11t1-a thing that no man will de-

CHAPTER XXXV.
Profusor !.CJwrence's Lecture on the Functions of the Brain
As the opinions of Professor Lawrence concerning the con-
stitutJou of man, are-with the exception of other physiolo-
grsts-of more weight than tbe opinion~ of all the world be-
side~ ; we think his lecture on the functions of the brain can-
no: fail of bemg highly iutere!'ting to . most of our readers.
Therefore we shall give it in hit own words, without addition
or subatraction :-it stands in no need of comment.
" ThP.re would be little inducement to compare together
the variou!l an•mat structures, to follow any apparatus thro'
the whole animal series. unless the structure were a measure
and criterion of the fu•1ction. Just in the same proportion
as organization is reduced, life is reduced ; exactly as the
organic parts are diminished in number and simplified, the
vital pheuomena become fewer and more simple : and t'ach
function ends, when the respective organ cease!!. This is
true throu~hout zoology ; there is no exception io behalf of
nny vital manifE-stations.
"The same kind off.1cts, the 8ame n·a~oning, the same ~<ort
of evidence altogether, which show digeslion to be the func-
tion of I he alimentary canal, the motion of the muscles, and
various secretions of their respective glauds, prove that sen-
sation, perception, memory. judgment, reasoning, thought-
in a word, all the marufestations called mental or intellectual,
-are the an•mnl funct10ns of tbcir appropriate organic appa-

arrives in bis corporeal dwelling, the interesting and impor·
tant moment of amalgamation or combiuation ol the earthly
dust and the etherral essence. The Roman Catholic church
hu cut the knot, which no one el~e could untie; and has de·
cided that tbe little mortal, on its pas~age into this world of
trouble, has a soul to be saved ; it accordingly dtrec.ts and
authorizes midwives, in cases of difficult labor, where the
death of the infant is apprehMded, to bapt•se 1t by means of
a syringe introduced into the vagina, and thos to save it from
perdition!!! ·
"They whose scruple~ are not quite set nt rest by the above
mentioned decision of the c·hur<'h, nor by being told that the
mind has not yet taken up its q11arteu in the brain, endeavor
to account for the entire abse1tce ofmental phenomena at the
time of birth, by the 'senses and bra1n not having been yet
called into action by tbe 1mpressions of external objects.
" These organ!! begin t~ be e~erc•sed as tooon as the child
is born : and a faint ghmmering of mind is dtmly perceived
in the course of the first months of existence : but it is as
weak and infantile as the body.
" As the senses acquire thetr powers, and the CE'rebral jel·
ly becomes firmer, the mind gradually strengthens ; slowly
advances, With the bndy, through t..htldhood to puberty; and
becomes adult wben the developerneut of the frame is r.om·
plete ; it is, moreover, male or lemale, ~according to the sex
of the body. In the perfect period of organization, the mind
is seen iu the plerritude of its powers ; but this state of full
vigo>r is shurt in duration, both for the intellect and the cor·
poreal fabric.- Tile wear and tear of the latter is evidenced
10 its mental moYements: w1th the dediue of organization
the mind decay'4 ; it becomes dec•·epit with the body; and
both are at the same time extin~ui~hed by death.
" What do we infer from thi:i succeFsion of phenomena !
the existence and action of a principle entirely dtstinct from
body ? or a close anttlogy to the hi11tory of all other organa
and functions ?

opement of the brain. The mmd of the Negro and Hotten·

more exquisite, perfect, and complex. its functions ought to
be proportionally so. It iii no r.light proof of the doctrine
now enforn~d, that the fact 111 actu11lly thus: that the mental
powers of brutes, eo far as we can see, are propo1 t1oual to
their nrganization. .
41 We cannot deny to animals all participation in rational
endowments, without shuning our eyes to the most ob\inus

aervation of mankind has not faaled to recognise aud appre·
ciate. Without adverting to theo well known instanceos of

If the intellectual ph<>nomena of man require an immaterial
principle superadded to the bram, we m•asl equally concede

.Are we to believe that these serve ooly to round the figure of
the organ, or to fill the cranium ?
"It 1s necessary for you to form clear opinions on this sub-
ject, as it has immediate reference to an important branch o(
pathology. They who consider the mental operations as ar:ts
of an immaterial being, and .thus disconnect the 11ouud state
of the mind from organization, act very c.onsistently in dis·
joining insanity also from the corporeal tltructure. and in re-
pre•enting it as a disease not of the brain, but of the mind.
·Thus we come to disease of an immatt>rial being! for wbicb,
suitahly enough, moral treatment hlls been recommended.
••I firmly believe, on the contrary, that the various fol'RII
of insanity-that all the affections comprehended under tbe
general terms of mental derangemc.>nt-are only evidences of
cerebral affer.tion11, disof\fered manifestations of those organ•
whose healthy action produces the phenomena called men-
tal; in short, symptoms of diser.sed brain.
''These symptoms have the &llme relation to the brain, as
vomiting, i11digestion, heart burn, to the stomach; cough,
asthma, to the lung3; or any other dt:ranged functions to their
correspondent organs.
" If the biliary secretion be inorea~ed, diminished, sua·
pended, or altered, we have no hesitation in referring to chan·
l(es in the condition of the liver, aa· the immediatE' causE of
these phenomena. We explain the state of re~piration, wbe·
ther 11low, hurried, impeded by cough, &pasm, &c. by the va-
rious conditions of the lungs and other parts concPrned.io
breathing. These explanations are deemed perfectly satis-
factory. -
44 What should we think of a person who told us that the
organs have nothing to do with th~ business; that cholera,
jaundice, hepatitis, are diseases ofan immaterial hepatic be-
ing; that asthma, cough, consumption, are affection& ofa sub·
tile pulmonary matt~r ; or that in both cases the disorder
is not in bodily organs, but in a vital principle ! If su,·h a
statement would be.deemed too absurd for any 1erious com·
meut in the derangement of ihe liver, lungs, and other Oflan·
ic parta, how can it be received in the brain ?
439
a The very persons who use this lan~uage of di~eases of
the mind, !'peak and reason correctly respectang the other af·
fections of the brain. When it is compre!ll!lec:l by a piece of
bone, or effused blood or t~er•Jm, and when all intellectual
phenomena are more o.r lc~s completely 11uspended, they do
not say that the mind is squeezed, that the immaterial prin-
ciple suffers pressure. For the ravings of delirium and phren•
zy, the excitation and subsequent stupor of intoxication, they
find an adequate explanation i11 the state of the ce•ebral cir--
culation, without fancying that the mind is delirious, mad, or
drunk.
"In these cases the seat of the diacase. the cause of the
symptoms, is too obvious to escape notice. In many forms
of insanity, the affection of the cerebral organization ill less
strongly marked, slower in its progress. but generally very re-
cognizable, and abund;mtlv sufficient to explain the diseased
manifestation,-to afford a material orgauic c.ause for the
phenomena-for the augmented or diminished energy, or the
altered nature of the various feelings and intellectual facul-
ties.
" ( have examined after death the heads of many insane
persons, and have hardly seen a 11ingle brain which did not
exhibit obvious mark!! ofdisease ; in recent ca~es, loaded ve&•
sels, i11creased seroul! secretions : in all instances of longer
duration, unequivocal signa of pre!lent or (PBl increased ac-
tion : blood ves!'els apparently more numerout, membrane&
thickened and opaque, depositions of coagulable lymph form•
ing adhesions or adventitious membranes, w~ttery effu~ionp,
even abscesses: add to this, ·the insane often become p~tra·
Jytic, or are suddenly cut off by apoplexy.
" Sometimes, indeed, the mental phenomena are disturbed
without any visible deviation from the healthy structure of
tbe brain : as digestion or biliary secretion may be impaired
or altered without any recognizable change of structure in
the stomach or liver. The brain, like otlll'r parts of this
complicated machine, may be da~used sy1npathetacally ; and
we aee it recover.
"ThlJS we find the brain, like other parts, subject to what
is called f11nctional dasorder; but, although we cannot actu-
ally demonatrate ·the tact, we no more doubt thnt the material
cause of the symptoms or external signs of disease is iu thas

CHAPTER XXXVI.
Some of the Difficulties that attend the Hypothesis of Soul,
but do not attend the Doctrine of Materialum.
One of the greatest absurdities ever admitted by men, is
the existence of an unextended being. It IS astonishing that
any man of common sense, should ~•ve his assent to such
a whim. We should think that before any man would ad·
mit the existence of an unextended being, he would disregard
all facts,-abandon all reasoning, and boldly assert that the
soul is extended. Yet it appears that philosophers have
not done th1s ; but hl\ve regarded the difficulties that attend
the idea of the soul being extended, and freely admitted that
it has neither pa,.ts nor ex.tension. But passit~g by thi!l diffi-
culty, we would ask where the soul comes from ?-Oh, from
the celestial regions, to be tmre. Well, then, is it a part of
the immaterial Deity himst-lf-who by the by we must sup-
pose to be unextended and destitute of rarts ; for if the want
ofthe property of extension be essentia to the immateriality
ofone being, it must be to another-or is it something made
by the Deity ? And if the latter, were all r;ouls made at the
time the Deity created· all th111gs, or Rre souls made as there
is a demand for them ?-which demand is sometimes greater,
and sometimeslel!s, as we may wel.l suppose,-deP,ending al·
!ogcther on the nccidmts that befall certain individuals ! But
if all souls were made at the time the Deity created all things,
what are they about before· tt.ey enter human bodies? lt is
probable that they can think before they enter the body ; if
they cannot, what reason have we to suppose that they can
after they fly away from it? If our souls did think before they
entered our bodiu, they cannot remember that they did, now
they are in our bodies ; and ifo•u souls cannot remember in
the body what they thought out of it, why should we suppose
that after they get out of it, they cnn remember what they
thought while in it? And if, after the soul gets out of the bo-
dy, it cannot remember what it thought while in the body,
why t!hould it be rewarded or punished for what it made the
body do ? It woul:l be like pun•~hing Sam for the deeds of
Thomas ; or like punishing a man for deeds which he can
have no idea ofever doing. Again, how can hell-tire, or any
other agent, operate upon llll unextended thing so as to re-
ward it or punish it? Do you tell me tbat there is no rew~M-
56
Digitized by GoogIe
ing or punishing until after the body is reorganized'! Wliy,.
then, all tbis fuss and contention with religionists about the
c:tistence of souls, since our future happincs~, after all, de-
pends on the reor~an4zation of the body ? _
Are all souls originally alike ? Ifyou l!ay so, then youg1vc
organization nearly as much credit as the materialist contends
for ; since it is diJfere:Jce of organization that lllllkes all the
difference between a Newton and an idiet, or a Newton
nod a flea.• If not alilee, we cannot suppose it is a matter
of indifference what soul enters this or that infant's lu·ain ;
and the que~tion arisea : what sorts out and directs the pro-
per souls to the right brains,-the male sQuls to the male
brains, and the ft>male !>ouls to the female brains ; the Hot•
tentot ~ouls to the Hottentot brains ; and the European souls
to the European brains ? Do you say that God directs them?
Pray, what are your 11otions of the relation that subsists be-
tween the Creator and the events of the uuiverse? Did not
God- so orgamze the universe that all natural events take
place by virt•Je of lhi!! organization-though God is the first
cause of all things, is he the immediate cause of any n:Jtural
event? dors the fire snap, does watet' run down hill, docs the
brain think, because the Deity is continually exercising bis
influence to produce these events ?-is God, as it were, a
slave to hiR own creation? or, hke a skilful artist, did he not
rro organize this wonderful machin~. the ~niver!le, that it con-
tinues in harmonious o:>eration withottt his immediate agen-
cy; .and will thus continue, until il be slopped by the same
power that created it? Any other supposition bnt this la~t,
would be ab~urd aud degrading. Now the generation and
growl_b of the material bod_v, are natural events-they are
not miracles-we can trace their connexion with other natu•·
• Abernethy, In his very unsuccessful crusade against his hrother

'l'al events. But between the generation of a homunculus,
and the starling oi' a soul from the celestial re~ions, we can
trace no connexiou.-The !'oul is started and directed by the·
immedillle ageney of the Deity, and of course, thi!l event is a
miracle.~ And a perfect and entire man, according to the im·
material hypothc:~is, is not altogether a natural production ;
but he is hrou!!ht inta being, partly by natural operations,
and partly by miracle !
After the soul is snugly nested in the brain, what does it
do? An~wer, it perceives, thinks, jud;::es, &c. Now bea~ts,
bird~, fish, and .in~e>ct~, pcrcei\·e, and almost all of them evi-
dently think ; and to think is essentially the same; as we
have shown, as to juti~e, rca~on, &c. -jndgiog is hut a mode
of thinkin~; and animals jutlgc d•fThrently, because they pos·
sess different sensorial ten•leucies. Now what will you do
with the souls of beasts, li~h. and mseets? Jfthe soul be ne•
cessarily, and in its very nature immortal, then all soul~ must
continue to live, (if any body can tell what the life of a !foul
consi'lts in,) whether in the body or out. But if the snul be
not naturally immortal-and we have not even scripture tes·
timony that it ts-what reason bas it for tlatteriug itselftbat
it will exist and be conscious after the body is dead, any more
than the body has for believing that it will exist io a future
state-which body has the assurauce of scripture, at least,
that it will be reorganized. .
How docs the soul seated in the brain, perceive objects ex-
terior to the body, and in many instances quite distant from
it? You have already seen that some supposed that the soul
quit3 the body, and tl•cs to the obJect; and others, that some
image, species, or phantasm, tlies from the object and enters
the brain, to be P.resent to the eoul : which last suppositieo
is the branch that gave rise to the sceptical philosophy of
Berkley and Hume. But if it should be said that when a
man see~, (to say nothing of other perceptions,) rays of light
excite an action in his optic nerve• and brain, and this actioo
of the brain excite~t an action or change (no matter whic.h
word you use,) of the unextended soul-yes, an aetion of an
unextendtd soul !- and that this action constitutes the seeing; _
I would a~k why we should not say that the action!l of the
optic nerves aud brain constitute the &eeiAg, and not suppose
the existence of an inconceivable something of which there
h uo evidence.-It is just as conceivable that an action of all

organ constitutes a sensation or a thou~~ll, as that an action
of something cl•e constitutes a thought.
• Again. how does a thing which posiesses no pMt~, sec, hca r.
and think, at the same time? Different parts of an extended
thing, may exist in different states, or take on different ac-
tions, at the same time; but if a certain state or action of nn
unextended thing be essential to the existence of a certain
·sensation, and another !tate or action. to the existence of a
certain other sensation; then it is ab~olutcly .impossible fur
this unextended thing to be at one time in such state as to
constitute both these sensations: but we can see, hear, feel,
and even think, at the same timc.-Remcmber what is said
in the chapter on sen,;ation and perceplton.
Furthermore, if an unextcnded soul, ~eated in the head, be
that which is conscious, how does consr.iou~ness or feeling-
which is generally a much higher degree of Lonsciousness
than mere thinking-exist in the foot. or any other member;
and this too even while thinking is going on in the head 1 No-
thing can be conscious where it is not, any more than rohtn it
is not; now we KNow that we often experience feelings in
different parts of our bodies at times when the soul cannot be
in such parts; for thinking is at the time going on in our heads;
and not only this, but an unextcnded thing cannot he .in two
different parts of our bodies-to 11ay nothing of the he'ld-at
the same time. Should any one have the hardihood to as-
sert that the soul extends throughout all nervous aamifications
that take on couscient actions, or an olher words, po~sess s«!n-
sibility; I wooldjU!•t ask him to imagine what a queer shaped
thing it is, and bow it would look, if by some chemical agent
the nervous system should be di8solved, and the soul at the
same time be endowed with the power of reflecting lig~t.
Methinks it would look somewhat like a slt.lrled ~kein of
yam, or a hone's tail that needed combing. I would nsk,
too, what becomes of that part of the fooul which is cut off
when a man has a leg amputated! and what makes the !loul
grow, so as to keep pace with the. growth and exten!iion of
nervous svstem ?
The imm-tterialists have not informed us at what period
the soul enten the brain; but those of modern times main-
tain that when it does enter, it is as destitute of ideas ,san
unwritten sheet of paper is of words; (and for my own part I
cannot conceive how an uncxtended thin~ can ever contain
orpoueu ideas, or any thing that can give ri::~e to ideas ;) but

presently the brain begins to act upon it-no'~ it is that it
begins to perceive, to have idea!'. and to think; and uow it is
that they regard the bout as a fiddle, and the brain as the fid-
dl~r that plays upon it--the perccptic.us, thought3, &c., c·on-
stituting the music. But after a ttme the child lwcom~s a
man, and the man becomes insane; the physirian now pro-
ceeds to bleed, blister, phy~ic, and salivate, ju!!l as he does in
other bodii!J diseases ; and finally cures the insauity; or, the •
man dyi:1g, an obv1ous disease of his brarn is discovered. The
immaterialist no\v begins to reason. The soul, thiuks he;. is
an immaterial, indiv1s1ble, immortal thing; now can we ~>up-
~ pose that such a thing is C\'er sick? or can we suppo~e that a
sick ~out, if there ev•·r were such a thing, is to be cured by
calomel, jalap, and hli~teriug plasters? No, this would be ab-
surd-an immortal soul is never sick--the truth i~. the brain
is the instrument by wluch the soul operates; and wheu the
instrument is out of order, the 'best mu~ician in the. world
cannot play upon it ~o as to make harmoulous music. Thus
we see that at one t1me the immaterialists tell uto that the
brain plays flpou the soul, at another, that the soul play11 up- •
on the brain-first one is the fidJic and then the other, just as
the d.ffir.nlties attending the immaterial hypothesis seern to
require !If.

11rriwd to this piau. I cannot bt-lieve you have used me so un·
fairly as to tumble our the leaves, rt'ading a little here and a little
there, with no other view than to find something to refute or coo-
demo ; if you l1ave, fire away ! but bl' careful that yoo ~o not
shoot at a shadow-many a time has an author been combattt>d,
because he was not atlentively read and rightly understood. But
ifyou are a lover of tru~h. (as all prl!ftss to be,) and have been to·
tert'sted in perusing this work, bl'rause you believed I was doing
something to fur: her the cause of it ; you will be pleased, I think,
to know a little more about me, and how J came to be such an in-
fidel all I am. -Nuw then you shall have a little bit of my history.
As it respects the " inner man." I am a sort of self-made creature,
not yet 29 years of age. I suppose my books would excite more
notice, were I some big professor, with a head of grey hairs upon
my shoulders ; but as I have all along endt>avored to tell you the
truth, boldly, I do not intend to alter lilY hand now, .for any pecu-
niary consideration. At Templf'ton, this state, (Mass.) I was
born and bred a farm~>r. 1\ty parents are still living. They never
enjoyed any adnntages for acquiring knowledge, though I believe
they possess pretty well organized brains. They bro~•ght me up in
the" fear of~ the Lord," and, with much ndo, taught me the West·
mioster Catechism, for I was a confounded dull scholar until 14 er
15 years of age After this p~>riod 1 made some proficiency in fig·
ures and the English gr~tmmar, considering my opportunities ; for

him flatly, for we have just as much proof thut it does, as we ltue
that gold is yellow, heavy. and dt•ctile. At page :l6!!, ht> says,
"Madness is· indeed ao awful malady, and might at first sight con.

decay of our material strtKture, but it surely oni,Y shows the inti·

deoc<>, if further evidence be needed, that it is the brain that thioks.
As to Dr. Armstrong, comparing the brain to a fiddle or any
other musical instrument, we have no objections, but it is very
strange that he should not be aware, that it ;, played upon by the

year, until 17 or 1S years or'age. From this age to that of 2 r,.
my health was such that I could not labor. DtJring this time I
spPnt nearly thrf'e mAPths in an academy, where I studied the
mathematics and the English language ; and I ncvPr studied auy
ether language under tho• tuition ofan.) onP1 with the exception .of
Dr. Charles .'\dams, of Keent>, N. H. BPing uader his care as a
patient for a few weeks, he spent a few hours, during this time, in
hearing my le~sun~ in the Latin grammar. A short tiRte before I
was 21 1 I married. My father in law, ;\lr Richard tuart,ufWio-
chendon, Mass. possr-sst>cl Pain~>'s Age ol Reason, and spoke highly
ef it ; but I cared not a fig fur it-did not read it : I supposed it a
had book, and its author a very roicked man. Mr. Stuart, too, wu,
and still is, a materialist in reality ; but in those days I knew not
what materiahm is-1 remembf'r asking him one day what he
supposed becomes of the soul when a person dies : he gave aoe ne
answer but this :-Wh<~t becomes of the blaze of a candle when v
you blow it out ? Soon after 2 I years ofage, I bf'gan to study med-
icine, under very unpropitious circumstances, fir•t with Dr. Charles
Wilder of Templl'ton; then with Dr. Stf'phen B:~tchellcr of Roy-
alston : and lastly with Dr. Amos Twitchell ofKet:ne, N. H.-io
thf' mean time attending two courses of mrdical lectures at Hano-
ver; where I receivf'd the degree of l\1. D. 1824. While with Dr.
Batcheller, I reari Bichat's works. This author maintains that
some of the passions have their seat in the thoracic and abdominal
viscera,-a doctrinf' with which I was not satisfied. Here I began
to cogitate concernin~ the constitution and phenomena of anan.
So far as I can remember; I had a notion something like.this :-
That the soul or mind is nothing that comes fr"~ the celestial re-
gions; but something which the brain forms, or to which it gives
rise, as the liver does to bile; that ideas come by way of the sen•
ses; and when they are in the mind, they are real ideas, or rather,
the mind sees them or is conscious of their existence; but they sooo-
dodge out into lome part of the brain ; but may be brought back
again into the mind by the memory. I believed that the passions.
must have their seat in the nt-rvous sy&tem, and that every mao
would believe so too, if it could be shown how they influence the
action of the heart, the secretion ofbile, &c. upon thia supposition.
This I thought I could do ; thf'relore I concluded to write my
graduating thesis on the passions. Before I undertook tn write th;..
th!!sis~ matters so turned out, that I waM safely lodged in Worcester
jail, for the no IP.ss heinous crime than that of being instrumental
(as was suppo.~ed) in depriving a parcel· of worma oftlteir dinner.
Here I was without books, excepting Good's Study of Medicine.
At the timf' of entering the jail, where I remained two months, (
firmly believed in the existence of souls, and although I supposed
them to be formed by the brain, I believed that they may exist in-

Jieve4 that something which I C'ln call myuf(, wi1l t'Xist in a state

Knowlton dies. I 1hd not kn·•w that an_) man ever doohted tht=

the world; but ·r supposetl tlwy held, that the soul is .. formt'd of

lay on my couch one oi~bt, what if I should put the soul entirely
