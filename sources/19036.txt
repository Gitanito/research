the beautiful thing about the earth is
that she really is a self-correcting
living conscious being organism and that
if given the opportunity the environment
can correct includes itself very quickly
you know there was the big northeastern
United States blackout some years ago
and the satellite images showed the area
around New York New Jersey a whole area
within hours the air that had been
almost just filthy could barely see
became pristine because no one that they
that the coal-fired power plant shut
down so the ability of the earth to fix
the problems is very great but with 7.2
billion people living on her like a few
million lived in the 1800s with
coal-fired power plants and gas engines
and what-have-you this can&#39;t happen
because we&#39;re overwhelming her natural
defense systems taking the biological
pair of analogy a little further it&#39;s
what we call it a rapid decompensation
in the ER where you&#39;ll see people who
they don&#39;t look that sick but there&#39;s an
underlying problem and they they&#39;re
going like this and and their systems
are trying to maintain and then they
crash boom very quickly unfortunately
that&#39;s where we are with the earth
