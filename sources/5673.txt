And, probably, the Adventure's men,
who went on ſhore ſo unguardedlyat New
Zealand, would not have met with the
fate they did, had they taken the ſame
wiſe precautions, with fire-arms, for their
preſervation, on their going on ſhore, as
the Endeavour’s men always did. In New
Zealand, and other iſlands of the South
Seas, there are found very few quadrupeds
either for uſe or food, from which and
the ignorance and ſavage diſpoſition; in
living upon one another, and on ſuch

aſſigned. And the ſame reaſon is given
(beſides what the ſavage cuſtom war

remote parts of Chili, or Peru, in Ame

lies, where the moiſt vapours lodge and
accumulate, that are required for the uſe
and ſupport of animal and vegetable be
ings ; the overplus of which accumulated
vapours returns again, by brooks, rivulets,
and rivers, into the ſea, adminiſtering ſup
plies as they paſs, from a ſort of chemical
or diſtillatory operation between the ſun,
the ſea, and the atmoſphere. The clouds,
firſt formed by exhalation from the ſea,
contribute their aid in this part of the
noble and grand ſcheme of the univerſal
Creator. This circulation is performed
like that of the blood of animals, ſent out
from the heart, by its pulſation through
the aorta, to the extremities of the body,
by the arteries, (veſſels lying deep, and
guarded from injury by the muſcles, as
are the nervous organs of ſenſation,)
returning again to the heart, by the
ſuperficial veins, in the conſtant round of
circulation. So likewiſe the vapour from
the ſea, (like the nutritive juices forming
the blood,) accumulates in rain and ſprings,
by falling into the chinks and caverns of,
the earth, and thence, overſiowing from
the ſuperficial brooks, rivulets, and rivers,

of the ECLIPSES of this preſent Year 1816.
IN the courſe of this year, there will be four Eclipſes, and
they will happen in the following order, as they were com
puted by Mr. Andrews, from very correót tables of the Sue
and Moon, founded on the Newton1AN ſyſtem of gravitation;
which tables wonderfully agree with obſervations. Of theſe
four Eclipſes, there will be two of the Sun, and two of the
Moon. **
The firſt is an Eclipſe of the Sun, on Monday the 27th of
May, about three o’clock in the morning, conſequently inviſi
ble, not to us only, but even to all Europe; but in the unknown
ſouthern parts of the world, it will be a very great Eclipſe;
for in latitude 58 deg. 52 min. ſouth, and 138 deg. 26 min.
eaſt longitude from London, namely, in the Great South Sea,
the Sun will be centrally eclipſed at noon-day, not total, but
annular, a bright circle will appear round the Sun, like a gold
ring; beautiful to behold. This place falls near Captain
Cook's track in his voyage round the world in 1775, and
weſtward of the Iſland of New Zealand. This Eğthen
will be viſible, more or leſs eclipſed, at New Zealand, and
New Holland, and all along the coaſt of New South Wales;
and therefore viſible at Botany Bay, and Port Jackſon. Th

air prove clear and fine, may be ſeen . us in this kingdom,
and not by us only, but alo by theinhabitants of all the ſtates
and kingdoms in Europe and Africa, together with the weſtern
parts of Aſia, and the eaſtern parts of America; but in Siam,
China, and º Tartary, &c. in the eaſtern parts of Aſia,
the fore-part only will be viſible, the Moon ſetting with them
before the Eclipſe be over. It will be all viſible in South
America; but the Moon riſes eclipſed in North America as ap
pears by confidering her poſition, in reſpect of thoſe parts of .
the earth, during the time of the Eclipſe ; for at the begin-"
ning the Moon will be vertical, or right over-head at mid
night, under 23 deg. 8 min. of ſouth latitude, and 6 deg. 22.5
min. eaſt from London. At the time of the middle, the Moon.
is vertical under 23-deg. 19-min. of ſouth latitude, and
18 deg. 49 min, weſt longitude from London. At the end
of the Eclipſe the Moon will be vertical under 23 deg 28-min.

The third of theſe Eclipſes, is a notable one of the Sun,
upon Tueſday the 19th day of November in the morning, vifible
in theſe parts of the Globe. -
It will be firſt ſeen to begin upon the Sun's vertical point at
his riſing, in the Atlantic Ocean, in latitude 47 deg 55 min.
north, and in Io deg. 51 min. weſt longitude from
London, which place is about 4 degrees weſt of the Iſland
of Uſhant, near the coaſt of France. The central Eclipſe.
begins in 66 deg. 18 min. of north latitude, in o deg. 15 min.
of eaſt longitude from Londºn, which falls near the Arétic
Circle, and directing its courſe towards the ſouth-eaſt, it will
paſs over ſome parts of Norway, the coaſt of Sweden, near the
Categate, it then croſſes the Baltic, and the Iſland of Born
holm; it enters Pomerania, and paſſes over ſome parts of Po
Jand, Hungary, European Turkey, and entering the Black
Sea, the Sun will there he centrally and totally eclipſed at
.namely, in the meridian, and this .# i. in lati
tude 43 deg. 24 min, north, and in 29 deg. 42 min. of longi

Black Sea, it enters. Aftatic Tartary, croſſes that country into
Perſia, behding its courſe more northerly, it paſſes over the
northern parts of Hindºffan, into the great Empire of China,
where the central ſhade quits the earth with a ſetting fun;
which place falls in the great Deſert of Cobi, in latitude 35
deg. 55 min. north, 83 deg. Iomin, of eaſt longitude from

not far from the coaſt of Malabar in the Eaſt Indies; in which
place the Eclipſe will be laſt ſeen to end with the ſetting
fun. This Eclipſe will be viſible to all Europe, the north
ern parts of Africa, and the weſtern parts of Aſia. This
Eclipſe where total, will not be of long continuance, for the
Moon's viſible diameter only exceeds that of the Sun's by,
about 46 ſeconds, at its greateſt altitude, and in the horizon.
but about 27 ſeconds; however, the Eclipſe will be total all.
along the central track, and for ſome diſtance on each fide ofit."

N. B. At Greenwich and London, the Moon will make the firſt
impreſſion on the Sun's diſk at 18 deg. 19 min, from his ver
tex on the right hand, and nearly as the above delineation for
the City of ºrk, and the Fclipſe begins accordingly, at 15
min, paſt eight o'clock, apparent time. The true ecliptic
conjunction at London, Nov. 18th, 22h. 22m.43s. Sun and
Moon's place then. in 27° of 59"; and the Moon's true latitude
50°47′N. decreaſing, ſemi-diameter of the Sun 16'13", ſe
mi-diameter of the Moon 16" 26"; horary motion of Moon from
Sun 34 12"; Moon's horizontal parallax 60'16", and that of
the Sun's, 9". In viewing the Sun, I would adviſe thoſe that
have not got proper teleſcopes, to uſe a dark glaſs, or a piece
ofwindow, glaſs ſmoked over the flame of a candle, as the beſt
ſecurity to their eyes. This will be the greateſt Eclipſe of the
Sun we have had in England, ſince that on the 5th of September,
in the year 1793. There was a great Eclipſe #:Sun, on the
1ſt of April, in the year 1764, which was a very large one, the
largeſt there has been viſible in England, fince the great total
one in the year 1715. The Eclipſe of º: Andrews
had the pleaſure of obſerving, with ſeveral Gentlemen, at the
ſeat of sº Chriſtopher, now Sir Thomas Whichcot, at Aftwar
&y, near Skafºrd, in Lincolnſhire. tº ºf .
The fourth and laſt of theſe Eclipſes, is a partial and viſi
ble one of the Moon, upon Wednesday the 4th of December. At
the time of the middle or greateſt obſcuration, the Moon will
be vertical, or directly over head, at midnight, to the great
Sandy Deſart of Arabia, in Aſia, under 22 deg. 53 min. of
north latitude, and 48 deg. 52 min. of eaſt longitude from
London; in this great Deſart, the Arabs remove from place to
place, partly for the ſake of paſture, and partly to lie in wait
for the caravans, which they often rob, as they travel over
that part of this Deſart from Baſorah to Aleppo, and from
Egypt to Mecca, in order to viſit Mahomet's Tomb. This
Eclipſe will alſo be viſible in Africa, the Iſland of Madagas
car, and all the leſſer iſlands of the eaſtern or Indian Sea, in
** **. Suma

Sumatra, the Maguſ, Empire, in Arabia, Perſia, alf Europe,
Iceland, Greenland; but the Moon, will only riſe eclipſed in
Newfoundland, and the ſame to the eaſtern parts of North
and South America. - . . . ºn
In this our Iſland of Great Britain, the time and º:
i. appearance may be expected to correſpond with the foſ
lowing conſtrućtion and calculation. The time of . this
Eclipſe will be nearly the ſame at Cambridge and, alſo at
Royffon, as it is at London, both being nearly under the ſamt
meridian. At Oxford, it will be 5 min. ſooner than at Lan
doh.

*The falling ſtars, and other fiery meteors, which are fre
Auently ſeen at a conſiderable height in the air or atmoſphere,
and which have received different names according to the va
riety of their figure and ſize, ariſe from the fermentation of
the effluvia of acid and alkaline bodies, which float in the at
moſphere. When the more ſubtle parts of the effluvia are
burnt away, the viſcous and earthy parts become too heavy
for the air to ſupport, and by their gravity fall to the earth.
The diſappearance offiery meteors is frequently accompani
ed by a loud exploſion like a clap ofthunder, and heavy ſtrong
bodies have been obſerved to fall from them to the earth.
Theſe ſtony bodies when found, are always hot, and their
fize differs from a few ounces to a very great weight, even to
ſeveral tons !! They are uſually round, and always covered
with a black cruſt. When broken, they appear of an aſh-grey
colour, and ofa granular texture, like coarſe ſand-ſtone. Theſe
ſubſtances are probably concretions aćtually formed in the at
moſphere, but in what manner no rational account has yet
been given.

There have been various opinions and conjećtures reſpect
ing the cauſe and properties of theſe extraordinary pheno
mena or appearances; and the moſt probable opinion is,
that they ariſe from exhalations, and are produced by a com
buſtion of inflammable air, cauſed by eleētricity. This in
flammable air is generated particularly between the tropics,
(the middle parts of the earth, where it is always very *}
by many natural operations, ſuch as the putrefaction o
animal and vegetable ſubſtances, volcanoes, &c. and being
lighter than any other, aſcends to the upper regions of the
atmoſphere, and, by the motion of the earth, is urged towards
the poles; for it has been proved by experiments that what
ever is lighter, or ſwims on a fluid which revolves on an
axis, is urged towards the extreme points of that axis:
hence, theſe inflammable particles continually accumulate at
the poles, and by meeting with heterogeneous *::::

fire, and cauſe thoſe luminous appearances frequently, ſeen
towards the polar regions, as we in England ſee it towards
the north, and it ſometimes appears ſo light there, as ifthe
moon was riſing; for in high latitudes the Aurorae Boreales
appear with the greateſt luſtre, and extend over the greater
part of the hemiſphere, varying their colours from all the
tints of yellow to the moſt obſcure ruſſet. In the north-eaſt
parts of Siberia, Hudſon's Bay, &c. they are attended by a
continual hiſting and cracking noiſe through the air, fimilar
to that produced by fire-works. To the north of Scotland,
they appear very frequently, where they call them the
merry dancers. - ºf

The SUN's ENTRANCE into CAPRICORN, which intro
duces the WINTER QUARTER. * . . .
I mean always now to begin the new year with this quar
ter, and not with the ſpring quarter as formerly, becauſe it
all falls within the new year, excepting a few days. The
winter quarter .#. when the sun according to appearance
enters the tropical ſign Capricorn, which takes place on Fri
day the 22d of December, at 46 minutes paſt 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, 1815. At this time, the laſt degree of II, is
aſcending in the eaſt, and .24 degrees of ::, are on the mid
heaven. The Moon is under the earth, departing from a ſex
tile aſpečt of Venus, and a ſquare aſpect of Mercury. The
planet Mars is ſtrong in his own domal dignities, located in
the 11th houſe. The planet Saturn is in the 9th houſe, in a
ſquare aſpect of P'enus. The Q is going down in the weſt,
and the Moon is with 11, 2, and #, under the earth. Theſe
are the principal configurations of the planet at this tropical
ingreſs. Of late years, many remarkable things and occur
rences have turned up and taken place ; and wonderful to re
late, amongſt the reſt, the return of Buon APARTE to the throne
of France, which has excited no little agitation amongſt all
the powers of Europe; and indeed, I expect from the plane
tary configurations at this ingreſs, ſome farther remarkable
occurrences are likely to take place, and ſome have already
taken place, and others are now on the anvil of ſtate; as
many eminent councils, and great conſultations, are carrying

on in the various cabinets of Europe; for kings, princes, and
other potentates, are much perplexed and diſturbed at the
late events. The French nation has been threatened by the
armies of theſurrounding powers, which has cauſed great diſ
turbances in that country, together with civil broils and con
tentions amongſt themſelves—Civil war and diſmay in that
unhappy country, fomented by foreign powers! Indeed, if
they would but conſider the great evil there is in war, as it is
~ amongſt the plagues with which God often threatens ſinful na
tions, and is of itſelf a diabolical work, which ravages the .
fair face of God’s creation, and hurls deſtrućtion amongſt the
mobleſt of his creatures in this world; the abettors of this evil,
be who they may, will ſurely have to anſwer for it at the
throne of God.—How blind the politics, how infatuated the
divinity, that can make even war palatable to the taſte! The
influences and effects of the planets at this time, together
with the 8 of 1ſ and 3 , and the D of Ł and 3, now com
ing forward, will affe&t ſeveral parts of Germany, together with
France, Holland, Portugal, Spain, and even Italy. Several of the
Baropean powersare ſtill ačtive, and I rather expect more ſo in
the Spring following; at preſent they ſeem to be conſulting and
: contriving ſuch ways and means as may bring about ſome im
portant event. England, I am afraid, is too much conneéted
with continental affairs, which I doubt will be to her detriment
- and loſs; for ſhe will ſuffer in ſome degree from the inſults
of open enemies, and the perfidy of pretended friends, yet
ſhe will, I hope, triumph in the end over both, as appears
2by the poſition of the planet Mars, who is the proper ſigni
tºficator of England, being ſtrong in an aſtrological ſenſe, in
... the 11th houſe of the figure, ſet for this tropical ingreſs. In
...this enſuing winter, there will be as uſual great complaints
9 of heavy taxation, with murmuring and repining againſt men
in authority.

more than the public intereſt. The French are ſtill ačtive
in their councils, and with their ſwords too, if it ſhould be
neceſſary. It alſo ſeems as if much liberty, both civil and
religious, are given to the French people, ſuch as hitherto
unknown, under their former kings. It alſo ſeems to me,
that ſome of the powers on the continent of Europe, are
much inclined to bring about a reconciliation between the
French nation and thoſe that are and have been hoſtile againſt
her. It alſo appears from the figure, that the people of Eng
land have their doubts and fears reſpecting ſome events that
have lately taken place in France, Spain, and Holland, as well
as in ſome parts of Germany. We ſhall aſſuredly find this as
well as the laſt a very buſy year, in which many notable
matters will be vigorously tranſacted. It is the influence of
Heaven which inſtigates and drives on various reſolutions in
the people in general, and they are ordained by Almighty
God, to ſhew that kingdoms and commonwealths have both
riſings and downfalls in the affections of ſubječts, and that
no engagements hold ſo long, and ſo firm in the people's af.
fečtions, as juſtice impartially diſtributed, and a ſeaſonable
compliance for redreſs of people's grievances. If the Engliſh
nation wiſely improve their talents, (as I hope they will)then
will their fame ſpread abroad, and England will flouriſh
again and again. As to America, I think the peace now be-, ,

Mars, have lately been in a ſquare aſpect. From all which I
infer, that this, like the laſt, will prove a very buſy quarter,
and rumours there will be of ſome approaching troubles in
foreign countries, but I hope England will flouriſh and remain
in tranquillity and peace, amidſt all theſe changes and altera

The SUN's ENTRANCE into LIBRA, which introduces
the AUTUMNAL QUARTER.
This quarter takes place when the Sun according to appear
ance enters the equinoëtial ſign Libra, which he will do on
Monday the 23d day of sº, at 43 min. paſt 4 o'clock in
the morning, when 16 degrees of Virgo, aſcends in the eaſt,

the Sun and Mars are in the aſcendant, afflicting each other;
Venus, the Moon, and Mercury near each other in the ſecond

This quarter then by theſe configurations of the planets,
will, like the foregoing, produce ſome particular occurrences
both in France, Spain, Italy, and ſome parts of Germany alſo;
there ſeems to be a reſtleſs party, who will ſtir up broils and
contentions, if not war. There are a race of men in the
world, who will bear no reſtraint or controul, though they
be promoting the moſt unjuſt and illegal attempts ; but the
time is approaching, when tyrannical governments muſt

and ſuch like beaſts of cruelty will no longer prevail—for all
things are eſtabliſhed in certain periods of time, and we are
all ruled by the pre-ordained councils of impending fate.
