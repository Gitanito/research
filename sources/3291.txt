HOW T O READ YO U R PAST
AND FUTURE LIVES
n P H E science of Astrology had its beginning
with the most learned nations of antiquity.
The first astrologers, priests, and philosophers,
found no conflict between the principles of
Astrology and the sacred philosophical sys­
tems which, ancient historians agree, were
first revealed to humanity by the gods. Thus
Astrology not only conforms with those uni­
versal laws which were the foundations of
ancient wisdom, but is also perfectly com­
patible with ancient standards of morality
and ethics.
Unfortunately, the philosophy of Astrology
finds few exponents in this modern age. Men,
more interested in material fortune than die
metaphysical mysteries of the soul, have ig­
nored die more profound issues of the astral
science. But Brahmin sages in rock-hewn tem­
ples, Chaldean Magi on their lofty ziggurats,
Egyptian priests in their stone observatories,
(3)
did not devote thousands of years to the per­
fection of Astrology merely out of curiosity
concerning their mundane affairs. To all of
these wise ones the mysteries of the heavens
were a revelation of divine principles and
divine will. The handwriting of stars on the
wall of heaven was to them in the very lan­
guage of the gods.
The nations most given to astrological re­
search also accepted the doctrine of the rebirth
of human souls. Since these two import­
ant teachings, Astrology and Reincarnation,
developed side by side, and the believers in
the one teaching were also the exponents of
the other, it is evident that no point of conflict
exists between the belief in rebirth and the
science of the stars.
The Hermetic philosophers, the wisest of the
Egyptians, possessed a profound knowledge of
both of these mysteries; as did also Pythagoras,
Plato, and Aristotle, the noblest thinkers
among the Greeks. The Druid priests of
Britain and Gaul included both Reincarnation
and Astrology among their secret teachings.
These noble men, revered as among the wisest
and most virtuous of mortals, could not have
been party to ignorance or superstition. In
these matters then, we should consider their
opinions with all seriousness.
(4)
Among Oriental nations the science of
Astrology and the doctrine of Rebirth are still
included together in the philosophy of life.
Old Hindu textbooks on Astrology, attributed
to the saints and Rishis, contain hints and
allusions to the method of determining past
and future states of existence from a natal
horoscope. Among the lamas of Tibet secret
formulas, carefully guarded from the profane,
are still used by astrologer-priests to determine
the parts of the previous existence from the
positions of the stars at the beginning of this
life.
The problems which these Tibetan priests
seek to solve are comprehended under three
headings:
1. The place of the spiritual entity among
the nidanas or the sequences of consequences
which cause the physical incarnation of the
soul.
2. The level or plane of consciousness in
which the entity functioned prior to its present
life, which contributes the moral force to the
present existence.
3. Such details and circumstances of the
previous existence as may account for the kar­
ma, or processes of retribution, which are at
work in the present existence.
(5)
In addition to these, a horoscope may be
erected for the moment of death by which the
future state of the soul or entity is estimáted.
Altogether, this part of Astrology is con­
cerned with that larger theatre of action of
which the present life is but a fragment.
To all philosophic peoples, man’s present
state is the result of previous life"and action.
To understand this, is to discover the cause
of present conditions. Asiatic astrologers have
practiced this part of the science for thousands
of years, and their findings should be of in­
terest to western students of Astrology.
The principle behind the Bhava Chakra (or
Cycle of Transmigratory Existence) recorded
on the ceiling of the Lamaist monastery at
Sikkim is entirely astrological. The outer cir­
cle of the figure is divided into 12 parts
which are termed the nidanas, or the causes
which move the soul to rebirth. These nida­
nas are the 12 Zodiacal signs, each one of
which contains within it an impulse to action
or, as the ancients termed it, a cause of con­
tact.
The first nidana, under Aries, is called the
unconscious will. It is represented by a blind
man and signifies the soul passing from death
to rebirth.
(6)
The second nidana, under Taurus, is called
conformation, and is represented by a potter
and his pots, signifying the soul shaping the
materials of the mental and physical natures.
The third nidana, under Gemini, is called
the conscious will, and is typified by the
restlessness of the monkey, and signifies the
rise of conscious experience in the soul.
The fourth nidana, under Cancer, called
self-consciousness, is represented by a ship con­
taining man, woman, and animals, and signi­
fies the rise of the quality of individuality.
The fifth nidana, under Leo, is represented
by an empty house and signifies the develop­
ment of the sensory perceptions.
The sixth nidana, under Virgo, is a figure
representing marriage, and signifies the focus­
ing of the sense perceptions upon exterior ob­
jects.
The seventh nidana, under Libra, is repre­
sented by a figure with an arrow in its eye,
and signifies the illusions of pain and pleasure,
and their reaction upon the soul.
The eighth nidana, under Scorpio, is called
desire and is involved in the experiences of
gratification.
The ninth nidana, under Sagittarius, is
termed indulgence and is represented by a
(7)
man collecting fruit into a basket. It signifies
attachment to worldly possessions.
The tenth nidana, under Capricorn, repre­
sents maturity and signifies the fullness of ma­
terial existence brought to its highest philo­
sophical level.
The eleventh nidana, under Aquarius, is
compensation represented by the birth of a
son. This signifies the paying of all debts to
nature and final detachment therefrom.
The twelfth nidana, under Pisces, shows the
dead body being carried to the grave. It signi­
fies decay of all points of contact by which the
life is held to the material state.
After the twelfth, the first begins again, and
so on through all the cycles of existence. The
nidanas, of course, represent the dominating
consciousness, or the place of the spiritual Self
in the great cycle of progress. While our little
life has its birth, growth, maturity and decay,
so do many hundreds of these lives form to­
gether a greater cycle involving a vast pro­
cess of life moving through its several stages.
By the position of the Sun the nidana is de­
termined, and by the Ascendant the subdivi­
sion of the nidana is ascertained.
Thus a person born with the Sun in Pisces
is born to the experience of detachment, for
he is bringing a cycle of experience to an end.
(8)
A person born with the Sun in Scorpio is
born under the eighth nidana; the soul pur­
pose of his existence is to experience the con­
sequences of greed, personality, and possession.
The Ascendant of the horoscope represents
a minor cycle of experience within a greater
one. It qualifies and specializes the general
significance. Thus, for example, the fifth ni­
dana, or Leo, is an externalizing of the senso­
ry power and generally manifests as ambition.
If the Ascendant is in the third m fltinaTor
Gemini, representing the effort to establish in­
dividual sufficiency, it qualifies the major fac­
tor and denotes that the ambitions will be of
an intellectual or mental nature.
By calculations based upon this arrange­
ment, the primary purpose of the soul’s incar­
nation is established. In application, it is gen­
erally found that this purpose more or less
dominates the individual in whose horoscope
it is indicated.
In the Tibetan monastery figure, the central
part of the design, representing the world or,
more exactly, the conditions of consciousness
which together make up the world, is divided
into six parts. In the painting these parts or
panels are filled with elaborate designs setting
forth the condition of souls in various levels
or degrees of spiritual development.
(9)
The six compartments of the circle are di­
vided into an upper and lower hemisphere of
three compartments each. The upper hemi­
sphere represents the three nobler states of be­
ing, which are denominated in degrees of ex­
cellence: (1) the world of the gods; (2) the
world of the Titans or Heroes; (3) the world
of men. Together these three parts depict the
happy states of consciousness which are the
reward of good Karma, that is, lives of noble
thought and action.
The three compartments of the lower hemi­
sphere of the circle depict the miseries result­
ant from bad Karma, or destructive thought,
emotion and action. The three compartments
are named respectively: (1) the world of ani­
mals; (2) the world of ghosts; (3) and the
worlds of hells or spheres of violent retribution.
In each of these six parts of the world is also
depicted a form of the Buddha symbolical of
universal enlightenment, which regenerates
and preserves evolving souls in all the spheres
of being.
The Sun of course represents the Buddha,
the power of diffused illumination. The solar
energy, distributed through the natural crea­
tion, is the universal source of the impulse to­
ward light and truth.
(10)
The six compartments through which the
Sun’s light shines pertain to the other major
bodies of the solar system known to the old
astrologers. The world of the gods is the
sphere of Jupiterian consciousness; that of the
Titans, Martial consciousness; that of human
beings, Mercurial consciousness. These planets
therefore dominate the upper hemisphere of
the sphere of consciousness.
Venus represents animal consciousness; the
Moon the imaginative consciousness, termed
the world of ghosts; and Saturn the retribu­
tion consciousness, or the Karmic hells.
In the East it is taught that each soul com­
ing into material life enters from one of the
six compartments of the Wheel of the Law.
Astrologically, the rule for determining the
origin of the soul’s present life cycle is as fol­
lows:
Examine the horoscope and discover wheth­
er the Sun or the Moon is the stronger. Deter­
mine this from position, dignity, and aspect.
Then observe in which decanate the more
powerful luminary is placed. Find the ruler
of this decanate according to ordinary astrolo­
gical practice, and the ruler of the decanate
shall signify the sphere of consciousness or
L o \a from which the soul came into birth.
Next, examine the position of the planet
( i d
which is ruler of the decanate as to its dignity,
position, aspect, etc. From this determine the
quality of the previous life. If the ruler of the
decanate enjoys dignity and high position, the
same would be true of the previous life of the
native. If it is afflicted, cadent, or ill placed,
the previous state of the life was lowly or
unfortunate.
A similar system is practiced by the Brah­
mins. They consider only four worlds, but
the method of determining this important
matter is identical in both systems.
In Astrology, the sign ascending on the East­
ern angle of the heavens at the moment of
birth is the general significator of the present
incarnation, and the entire horoscope is read
from this Ascendant, and all the testimonies of
the chart are blended with the fundamental
keynote of this ascending sign. The Zodiacal
sign upon the cusp of the 12th house may be
termed the preceding sign to the Ascendant,
and the Zodiacal sign upon the cusp of the
2nd house may be termed the succeeding sign
from the Ascendant. As the Ascendant sig­
nifies the present state of the evolving soul,
the cusp of the 12th house becomes the signi­
ficator of the previous life to the present one,
and the sign upon the cusp of the 2nd house
the next incarnation after the present one.
(12)
The rule is that angular houses signify the
present life, succeedent houses the next life
to come, and cadent houses the previous life
and its Karma.
If then we move the horoscope sufficiently
to bring the 12th house cusp to the Ascendant,
we can then read the horoscope as the nativity
of the previous life.
Ordinarily the 12th house of the horoscope
is termed the house of self-undoing, in that it
reveals thè fundamental weaknesses of charac­
ter which undermine the probability of pres­
ent success. The term “self-undoing” is iden­
tical in meaning with Karma, or the accumu­
lations of past actions which overshadow pres­
ent conditions. This accumulation is carried
forward from life to life until all weaknesses
are overcome and final perfection is achieved.
It naturally follows that whatever Zodiacal
sign dominates the present life of the individ­
ual, the sign previous to it signifies the Karma
brought forward from the past. The position
of the ruler of that sign and planets in the
12th house revealed the circumstances of the
previous existence, the probable place and
time of the previous birth, and the general
circumstances of that existence.
The sign Aries ascending indicates Pisces to
have dominated the previous existence. Aries
(13)
as the first sign of the Zodiac is the beginning
of a new cycle of experience. Aries people
have come into this life from a previous exist­
ence of limitation, responsibility, and bondage.
Their present life is therefore a release and
they move forward, dominated by strong am­
bition and enthusiasm.
If Taurus is ascending they have brought
forward the impulse of the previous Arian
existence. Most Taurus people bring forward
the positive militant attitudes of Aries, and
beneath their artistic surface emotional fires
bear witness to the militancy of their previous
incarnation.
When Gemini ascends we find beneath the
intellectual attitude the Karmic pressure of
Taurus. The superficiality of the Gemini tem­
perament is evident throughout this country,
which is strongly Mercurial. Yet under the
general intellectual surface of the nation is a
powerful and despotic economic force that is
a distinct Taurian hangover.
When Cancer ascends, Gemini lurks in the
background. Cancer people are subject to the
distorted imaginations of a negative and un­
controlled Mercury. It is hard for Cancer
people to be natural and relaxed, for behind
them is a life lived under the influence of a
negative Mercury agitating the intellect by a
(14)
complex of opinions and fears that are too
often allowed to grow into acceptance as facts.
When Leo is ascending there is generally a
strength complex arising out of the weakness
of the previous life. For this reason Leo peo­
ple are apt to be egotistic and power-loving,
building a positive outward front to protect a
very sensitive, emotional, imaginative, subjec­
tive nature held over from the Cancer influ­
ence.
W hen Virgo is ascending there is a subcon­
scious repentance in the soul. The previous
life was under the forceful, dominating influ­
ence of Leo. The Leo incarnation revealed the
emptiness and vainness of authority and the
native is born into Virgo with a strong tend­
ency to the simple life. Virgo is a sign of
atonement, and the individual has the impulse
to help a world which he probably tyrannized
over in the previous life. Down deep inside
of themselves many people have rather a def­
inite Leo superiority complex and a tendency
to boss.
W hen Libra ascends, the individual brings
into life Virgo karma. The people of Virgo
have a tendency to lean and depend, and this
weakness comes forward in Libra as a sense of
internal insufficiency. The Libra native is of
an artistic, somewhat irritable, delicate tem-
(15)
perament. They have strong vanity arising
out of their Virgo repentance.
When Scorpio ascends, the strong emotion­
al power of the previous life combines its force
with the fiery nature of this sign. Libra is
artistic and emotional with a tendency to mel­
ancholy. Scorpio intensifies these qualities,
giving also depth and organization to the
thought. The self-gratification of Libra is the
natural foundation for the powerful ambitions
of Scorpio.
The sign Sagitarius ascending produces a
jovial temperament, but the Scorpio qualities
of the previous life are also present here, pro­
ducing their love of the mysterious, religious,
and philosophic aspirations, a strong emotion­
al nature, a love of power and position, and
danger of over indulgence. T he schemes and
plots of Scorpio are released as vast prom o­
tion projects by the Sagittarians.
It may at first seem improbable that we
should find much of Sagittarius in the Capri-
cornian. W ith Capricorn rising, however, we
find great emphasis upon the ambitions and a
considerable measure of the Sagittarian con­
cept of justice. W hen Capricorn ascends the
individual generally feels that he is lim ited or
inhibited. The large Jupiterian prom otions of
(16)
his previous life are curtailed by the Saturnine
limitations of his present sphere of action, so
he is dissatisfied and repressed.
As Capricorn is the most limited sign in
the zodiac (a limitation, however, mostly self-
imposed) it is natural that the next incarna­
tion should be a revolt against limitation. The
result is the Aquarian whose life is often dedi­
cated to unconventionality. With Aquarius
rising, there is a general revolt against pre­
cedent, convention, and conservativeness. Gen­
erous in large matters, Aquarians often retain
a selfishness in small things essentially Capri-
cornian.
Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac and this
sign brings to an end the cycle of Karma set
in motion in Aries. People with this sign
rising will therefore usually have rather hectic
lives, gathering up the loose ends of unfinished
business. From Aquarius, the preceding sign,
comes vacillation, inconsistency, and nervous­
ness. From all the preceding signs come re­
sponsibilities and problems to be assimilated
and transmuted into soul power. It is the par­
ticular duty of the Piscean to put his life in
order and prepare himself for a new begin­
ning and a higher level of action. Pisces is
the weakest of the signs because it represents
the end of a cycle of experience.
(17)
By reading the 12th house as the Ascendant,
the general pattern of the previous life can be
determined with reasonable detail and we can
discover the subtle forces which have brought
us up to our present state and dominate our
present life in this world. Through the un­
derstanding of this branch of Astrology we
can appreciate the old philosophical belief that
all that we are today is the result of what we
have been, and that what we will be tomorrow
must be the result of what we are today. We
learn from the past, we labor in the present,
and we build for the future.

ASTROLOGY AND REINCARNATION
■pLAVIUS Claudius Julian, generally known
as the Apostate Emperor of Rome, was
born at Constantinople, November 6, A. D.
331. He propitiated the god Mercury as Lord
of his geniture, and from this circumstance,
checked by his appearance and the circum­
stances of his life, it appears that he was born
with the sign of Gemini ascending.
Julian was by far the most learned and
philosophical of the Roman emperors and
probably also exceeded all the others in per­
sonal virtue and integrity. At the time of his
birth the Flavian family, which ruled over
Rome, was nominally Christian as the result
of the conversion of Constantine, surnamed
the Great. Julian was educated as a Christian
in Nicomedia by the Bishop Eusebius, and
even officiated as a lecturer in the Christian
church.
The circumstances which caused Julian to
denounce the Christian faith and return to the
pagan doctrines of the classical world have
been variously described. The young man
was of an extremely religious and sensitive
(19)
nature, with strong development of the facul­
ty oi veneration. His tine sense of values led
him early to the realization of the greatness
of Pythagoras* Plato and Aristotle. His child­
hood brought him in constant contact with
the iniquities of the Christian house of Fla­
vian. The Christian emperor Constantius
massacred Julian's father and most of his
relatives* his half brother* Callus* was ban­
ished to Ionia* and Julian was spared only be­
cause of his extreme youth. A third factor in
Julian's conversion to paganism was probably
the Grecian influence in the prevailing educa­
tional system. Julian's teachers were men
who highly venerated the Grecian philos­
ophies and early instilled the old lore into the
young man's mind.
In his twentieth year Julian was secretly
initiated into the Mysteries of the Ephesians
by the priest-philosopher Maximus* and four
years later in Athens he was solemnly accepted
into the Mysteries of Eleusus. He may there­
fore be regarded as one of the last great ini­
tiates of the pagan world.
There is no evidence that Julian ever perse­
cuted the Christians* although he wrote a
powerful essay against the corruptions of their
faith. It is certain* however* that he gave
favor in government to pagans* and surround-
cvl himself w ith philosophers and priests of
non-Christian rites.
T he call to the purple came on his birthday,
November 6, A. D, 355, which seems to check
the probability of die accuracy of his horos­
cope as given. T he responsibilities of govern*
m eat weighed heavily upon the soul of the
philosopher-emperor and interfered seriously
w ith the development of his religious ideals.
But it has been said of him that he penetrated
as far in philosophy as the responsibilities of
em pire would permit.
Representations of the Emperor Julian por­
tray him as a man of noble visage, heavy
beard, prom inent nose, and a definitely Scor­
pio asymmetry of features. H e described him ­
self as being utterly indifferent to the formali­
ties of rulership and the niceties of personal
appearance. H e tells us that even while cam­
paigning he continued his studies and writ­
ing, and that on the battlefield his fingers
were stained w ith ink. Bound by the circum­
stances of the times in which he lived, Julian
nevertheless represented a standard of personal
integrity far above the majority of his contem­
poraries and worthy of recognition in any age.
T he historian Libanius thus describes Ju­
lian's am azing life and tem peram ent: Always
abstemious, and never oppressed by food, he
applied himself to business with the activity
of a bird, and dispatched it with infinite ease.
In one and the same day he gave audiences,
he wrote to cities, to magistrates, to generals
of armies, to his absent friends, to those who
were on the spot; he heard letters read that
were addressed to him, examined petitions,
and dictated with such rapidity that the short'
hand writers could not keep pace with him«
He alone had the secret of accurately hearing,
speaking, and writing at the same time«
Through this multitude of complications he
dispatched business, then dined merely
through urgent necessity and thereafter shut
himself up in his library, to read and conv
pose until affairs of State summoned him. A
•upper even more sparing than his dinner was
followed by a sleep as light as his meals.
Upon awakening he labored with other se~
cretariet whom he had allowed to sleep
through the preceding day. His ministers
were obliged to relieve each other; but he
knew no repose but change of employment.
Always he labored, multiplied himself, as­
sumed as many form» as Proteus. Julian was
pontif, author, diviner, judge, general of the
army, and, in all these characters, the father
of his country.

According to Hugath. probably the most
itlitb lt sudwiity on die subject» Alexander
die Qpest was born B. C iSb^ probably in the
month of October, h x tn k u m of Alexander
and written descriptions of his appearance
agree in general that he was a man of medi­
um height» with a strong» squarely-built body.
His head was large, face somewhat fcht. eyes
large and wide apart» forehead low with a
heavy prominent lock or tuft of hair low in
the center. His eyes are described as liquid
and melting. His neck was somewhat large,
chin square, tips full. This is a pretty good
description of a Taurean. George Washing­
ton had the conquering power of Taurus
ascending, and it dominated the nativity of
General Grant. From Hogath's data, the
Sun sign was most likely Libra. This sign
is also often associated with leadership and
conquering genius. According to the given
time. Napoleon I had Libra rising, and an­
other example of the ambitions of this sign
is Adolph Hkler. Gandhi abo has the Sun
in Libra.
The lives of Alexander and Julian certainly
parallel in many respects. Both men were
devoted to classical learning. Alexander the
Great respected his tutor Aristotle above all
other men. O n one occasion he declared Aris-
tode to be far dearer to him than his own
father, for he said, “My father gave me being,
but Aristode gives me well-being.” The youth
of both Alexander and Julian was similarily
involved in conspiracies and disasters. Both
men died at an early age. There was only
one year's difference in the length of their
lives. Alexander died of poison, Julian of a
wound. Both died at a distance from their
native lands, while on campaigns of con­
quest, and the places of death were not far
removed. Alexander died in Babylon, Julian
in Assyria.
Following the rules set forth in the preced­
ing chapter, let us examine the chart of Julian.
The first rule is to observe which of the lumi­
naries is most dignified, and take the ruler of
the decan as the significator of the estate and
condition of the previous life.
The Sun and Moon are both highly digni­
fied in the chart of Julian, but the Moon en­
joys the added strength of being in its own
sign. The Moon is in the second decan of
Cancer, which is under the rulership of
Scorpio, therefore Mars is the significant
planet
From this we should read that in his pre­
vious incarnation Julian should have been a
soldier, or some person engaged in Martial
(26)
pursuits. In Julian’s nativity, Mars is in the
10th house, the house of kingship, leadership
and honors; and is so placed in part of the
grand trine to enjoy powerful benefic aspects
from the Sun, Moon, and Mercury. It would
be perfectly proper according to the most
conservative rules of Astrology to declare
Mars so placed to represent an extraordinary
measure of Martial dignity, and a royal or at
least highly honored position among men.
Our second rule relates to the progress of
the Sun and Ascendant from life to life.
According to this, the sign on the cusp of
the 12th house should indicate the Ascendant
of the previous life, and the sign previous to
the Sun sign should represent the Sun sign
of the previous life. If Alexander was bom
in October, it is quite reasonable to suppose
that his Sun sign could have been Libra,
which is the sign previous to the Sun sign of
the Emperor Julian. The description of Alex­
ander is so definitely Taurean that it is well
within possibility that he had Taurus rising.
Alexander believed himself to be the incar­
nation or embodiment of the god Dionysius.
This divinity was frequently depicted with
the horns of a bull, and is usually associated
by mythologists with the sign of Taurus. It
is therefore quite possible that Alexander pro-
(27)
pitiaicd Dionysius 11« the clicty of his useending
hour, in the same way that Julian propitiated
Mercury.
Some astrologers maintain that the sign rul­
ing the 12th house may indicate the nation­
ality of the previous life. Taurus rules Greece.
To follow out this theory, that the 12th house
cusp signifies the previous incarnation, turn
the chart of Julian so that the cusp of the
12th becomes the Ascendant, and discover if
possible to what degree this position could
represent the life of Alexander.
To point out a few possibilities, Capricorn
becomes the ruler of the Midheaven. Capri­
corn governs India, and it was one of Alexan­
der's greatest ambitions to convert the Hindus
to Grecian art and religion. Mars and Ura­
nus arc in the 11th house, to represent Alexan­
der's hopes, ideals and ambitions. May not
the grand trine focussing upon these planets
signify the extreme emphasis of ambition in
the life of Alexander, who wailed to his gen­
erals that there were no more worlds to con­
quer? Sagittarius is on the 8th cusp becom­
ing die significator of death. Jupiter, die
ruler of the house of death, is in the 5th
opposing Mars and Uranus, to signify his
undoing. Venus also is in the 8di house and
shares with Jupiter in signifying the cir-
(28)
cumstanccs of clinsolution. Alexander feasted
and debauched for six days (Jupiter in the
5th), and was finally poisoned (Venus in the
8th), and died a great distance from home
(Sagittarius on the cusp of the 8th).
From these indications and others it is pos­
sible to conclude that if Julian was not the
reincarnation of Alexander he was certainly
the incarnation of a person much like Alexan­
der in many respects — a brilliant military
genius whose ambitions were inordinate and
against the balancing and reasoning forces of
Jupiter.
It is also interesting to ask the fate of the
soul of Julian after it was freed from the body
of the Roman Emperor. Move the horoscope
so that the 2nd house becomes the Ascendant
and try to solve the mystery of the next life
of Julian the Apostate.

ASTROLOGY AND KARMA
HOW WE MAKE OUR OWN FATE
u r PHERE is no fatal necessity in the stars,”
wrote Lord Bacon, “and this, more
prudent astrologers have consistently allowed.”
Opponents of astrology frequently advance
the argument that belief in the influence of
the heavenly bodies leads to a fatalistic attitude
towards all the problems of life. We all like
to think of ourselves as free agents. We chafe
at any factor of restraint, physical or psycho­
logical. We all like to talk about free coun­
tries, free speech, and free trade. The very
thought of freedom has become a fetish. We
rise in righteous wrath against anyone who
seeks to curb the spontaneous abandon of our
actions. We acknowledge no authority super­
ior to our own desires, and feel that the demo­
cratic theory of government has released us
forever from supervision and restraint. Are
we not all born free and equal? May not the
humblest child hope to be a Senator when he
grows up? Were not all our great capitalists,
(30)
prize-fighters, and movie stars once humble
and insignificant persons? Every m an knows
he is the equal of every other m an and super­
ior to most. Success is a m atter of “breaks.”
Even the subtle restraint of the m erit system,
dem anding certain standards of thought and
action, has been dissipated by the equality
complex.
T he materialist views astrology as a sort of
astral theology. H e feels that old orthodoxies
are being fed to him again under a new name.
H e feels the influence of the heavenly bodies
to be as im probable as heaven and hell, and
relegates angels and planets to a common
limbo. T he m odem m an, wise w ith the con­
ceits of tw entieth century scholasticism, can
find nothing in the universe nobler than
himself, and settles dow n to a fanatical vene­
ration of his ow n superiority.
It is not of course w ithin the province of
any science to convert a m an againt his will,
yet even a little thought m ust convince the
reasonable-m inded m an that some principle of
order binds together the far flung purposes of
the cosmos. It certainly cannot be scientific­
ally dem onstrated that the universe is merely
one vast accident m anifesting by means of
innum erable lesser accidents. Despite the con­
ceits of m ortals, the vast pageantry of cosmic
(31)
order throughout its every |k irt manifests ah
1solute nml im m utable law»
The very thought of this cosmic law op>
presses and disturbs the lawless mortals of this
generation» Man hates to think that he is a
mere atom moved by inevitable and iuunut
able laws. Egotism is the most easily offended
of the conceits, and man is mortally offended
by the immensities of the universe about Inin.
The universe of the wise man is unendur­
able to the foolish» To case the aching of his
personal pride, the Sophist has decreed that
space he regarded as mindless and soulless,
that man alone is endowed with sovereign
reason, decreed by the accident of fate to he
come master of all the works of the Infinite
Will,
Ilow different from this modern attitude
was the gentler vision of the ancients,
They held all creation to he ensouled by a
divine will and a universal purpose. Instead
of being offended hy the sense of their own
smallness, (hey rejoiced in the vastness and
sufficiency of the wisdom that preserved all
life and sustained the order of cosmic progress,
It was among the wisest of ancient: nations
that philosophy and astrology grew up to*
gether, each accepted as a complement of the

<iiIll'll Nm was tintit|iii(y enfeebled by a
sense of fatalism. Killher. It! rejoiced in the

in which no elements nl change or accident
existed. I hiving discovered anil accepted Ihe
great laws of life, the philosophers of oncicj
ii ity pm their own lives in order, gladly
acknowledging die sovereign wisdom which
regulated justly and with certainty all celestial
and terrestrial allairs.
The law of Cause and b'.ilcci is one ol the
most important of die seven great laws by
which, according in die ancient wisdom, the
universe is sustained. The acceptance of ibis
law and the understanding ol its inferences is
found in nearly all of die old systems ol reli­
gion and science. O v n forty great nations of
die past have preserved this law in their
scriptures hy the statement which we call die
(«olden Rule. Unrecognised hy most, this
same law preserves all die consistencies of life
and action.
The fanner plants his seed with perfect
assurance that it will grow. Science accepts
this law in every laboratory experiment. We
live from day to day sustained by the convic­
tion that certain causes will always produce
consistent ellcets, and wc have never yet been
disappointed.
Yet very few people apply the law of Cause
and Effect to personal action. Sometimes this
is because of ignorance, but more often, as
already observed, it is because the training of
the modern man has caused him to feel that
he is in some way superior to or apart from
the ordinary edicts of nature.
The great philosopher of India, Gautama
Buddha, once said: “Effect follows cause as
the wheel of the cart follows the foot of the
oxen.” W e live in a world completely ruled
by a law of universal compensation. Most of
the miseries which now afflict suffering mor­
tals are due to ignoring the principle of com­
pensation in action. W e do not sense the
profound moral inference behind the story of
the sowing and the reaping.
It is perfectly natural to ask how does astrol­
ogy fit into this picture. W hat part do the
stars play in the administration of the law of
Cause and Effect. To understand this point
we must also have recourse to another law of
the ancients—Reincarnation. Life, eternally
building, is constantly improving vehicles for
its own expression.
For our present purpose we narrow this
subject down to the life of man, for as
Socrates once wisely observed, “The proper
study for m ankind is man.”
(34)
Reincarnation applied to man teaches that
each hum an being has already lived many
times upon this earth and in future ages will
frequently return. The present life of a per­
son is therefore not the whole of his existence,
but a mere fragment.
Causes leading up to this present existence
are not always evident in this life, nor are the
consequences, which, arising from present
action, will manifest in some future life. The
ancients believed that from the horoscope it
was possible to discover certain generalities of
the previous life.
The law of Cause and Effect, when applied
particularly to hum an concerns, was called by
the ancients Karma. Karma does not mean
fatalism, but rather, compensation. W hen a
m an buys something on credit he creates a
debt, and the law declares that he must pay
that debt. In a material, economic transac­
tion this would not be regarded as fatalism,
but as responsibility. Every action which a
hum an being performs may thus be regarded
as a cause, and every cause thus set in motion
must have an effect consistent with itself.
This is not fatality, this is compensation, or
Karma.
In this unphilosophic age we all like to hope
that by some mysterious formula we can es-
(35)
cape the responsibilities of destructive action.
We want to be selfish, but we do not want
to suffer the reactions of selfishness. We con-
standy break natural law and we are all seek­
ing some panacea which will remove from us
the unhappy consequences of our indiscre­
tions. The theological doctrine of the for­
giveness of sin is a salve to take the sting from
the reactions of iniquity, but the law of Cause
and Effect can never be evaded, and all the
evils that we do return to us again. There is
no escape from any part of them.
The law of compensation, or Karma, has
two distinct aspects. Good Karma is the ben­
eficent reaction of constructive action. Fine
and noble causations produce like conse­
quences, bringing us joy and security and the
good things of life. Bad Karma is the re­
action of destructive action. Evil causes set in
motion produce evil consequences, resulting
in the miseries and misfortunes which afflict
this present life.
When we are born into this world there are
three factors working together, molding and
modifying our existence here. The first is
good Karma, which brings certain privileges
of happiness and improvement and surrounds
us with such good things as we have earned.
The second is bad Karma, which manifests as
(36)
the difficulties of the hour and the apparent
evil fatality which dogs our footsteps. The
third factor is action itself, our individual
expression which is constantly making new
Karma, good or bad according to the merit
of the action itself.
Philosophy therefore teaches us to be modest
in success (good Karma), patient in adversity
(bad Karma), and constructive in all action.
A life so lived promises future lives of greater
enlightenment and happiness.
- The law of Cause and Effect controls
j | among other things the actual phenomenon
0 of birth itself. We are born at the time which
* we have merited, and into conditions which
[ ^ ^ we have merited, and into opportunities suit­
able for the next stage of our development.
Each person is in the place he has earned for
himself, and if he is dissatisfied with his
present condition then he must set up within
himself the causes which will result in a
better state. _
Astrology is the mechanism which adminis­
ters the law of Karma. The universe is vibra­
tion. The interaction of the heavenly bodies
is constantly setting up fields of specialized vi­
bration. The incarnating entity of man is also
a rate of vibration, modified by the Karmic
factors within itself. The incarnation of the
(37)
individual is determined by these vibratory
factors. He is born into circumstances con­
sistent with the Karmic modifications of his
own nature. He is born when the planets are
arranged in a pattern consistent with his own
Karma. With his first breath, man breathes
in the sidereal influences; and what he has
merited comes to him from the stars and be­
comes the individuality determinant for his
entire life.
The stars then are not merely sending bane­
ful influences upon some poor weak, helpless
mortal. They are really administering univer­
sal justice, bestowing upon each according to
his own works. This is not fatalism. It is
compensation. One of the first things that
every philosopher must learn is to pay gladly
the debts which he has incurred in nature.
All Karma, both good and bad, leads finally
to enlightenment through experience.
It is very often possible to determine to
some degree the Karmic elements in life from
the horoscope, for in many respects the nativ­
ity is a statement of indebtedness, a bill ren­
dered to each of us when we are born. In it
are set forth the debits and credits of Karma,
as these apply directly to the present life.
The path of progress is with the Sun, and
as Karma arises from past action it is most apt
(38)
to be revealed through the qualities of the
signs preceding those occupied by the Sun and
the Ascendant in this present life.
The signs of the zodiac are alternatively
positive and negative. The positive signs are
Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and
Aquarius. The negative signs are Taurus,
Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces.
To understand what is meant by positive
and negative, it would probably be more ap­
propriate to use the terms objective and sub­
jective. (Objective^ signs gain experience by
contact with external sources of knowledge
and objectify impulses. (The subjective^ signs
are much more introverted and their reactions
rise from within themselves rather than from
external contact.
The positive and negative signs alternating
represent an ebb and flow of energy. The
Oriental philosophers symbolized it by an in­
breathing and outbreathing an alternating
process of externalizing. These signs are
closely related therefore to Cause and Effect,
the positive signs being causes, and the nega­
tive signs effects; or actions and reactions.
Persons born under the positive signs of the
zodiac are not so apt to sense the Karmic fac­
tors in life as those born under the more sensi­
tive psychical negative signs. This does not
(39)
mean that the positive signs escape cosmic
law, but they interpret impulses so definitely
into action that they seldom feel the retrib­
utive aspect of energy. This explains why
people born under the negative signs are
much more fatalistic than their positive sign
brothers and sisters.
You may have already observed that each of
the zodiacal signs includes am ong their key­
word qualities belonging to previous signs.
I believe that each sign works out the Karma
of the previous sign. Also, each sign rebels
against the limitations of the previous sign.
T he sign of the zodiac under which we are
born reveals not only the personal tendencies
of the present personality, but also brings for­
ward a statement of unfinished business from
the past. If previous action has merited a for­
tunate Karm a, then the qualities of the sign
are positively stated. If previous action merits
an unfortunate K arm a, then the negative re­
sponds to the negative vibration of the sign.
All of the sideral influences are in themselves
neutral, but they manifest as constructive or
destructive according to the m erit of the in­
dividual himself.
Let us consider the signs in their order,
bearing in m ind especially the workings of
the law of karm a:
(40)
Aries, the first sign, is in itself positive, but
it carries with it much of the negativeness of
Pisces, the preceding sign. There is no more
certain indication of weakness than constant
effort to be strong, or an over-statement of
ambition. Aries is a sign of rebellion against
the limitations and restraint of Pisces. Disap­
pointment may be considered an Aries charac­
teristic. Persons born under the sign are
constantly struggling to overcome obstacles,
not realizing that their greatest obstacle is the
Piscean weakness within themselves.
Taurus is a negative sign, but persons bom
under it are in many ways more positive than
negative in their impulses. Many men success­
ful in industry and the military are born un­
der this supposedly negative sign. The reason
is, the inordinate ambitions of Aries lie in
the Karmic background of all Taurus people.
The reason the sign is termed negative is be­
cause very often these dynamic impulses are
blocked in their manifestation by the inflex­
ible Taurean temperament. Ambition is locked
in and comes to nothing, unless the Taurean
person subjects his life to a powerful self-dis­
cipline. Even the successful Taurean people
are notoriously unhappy. Whatever they
achieve is unsatisfying, and they live and die
(41)
in bondage to unfulfilled desires. Their Aries
Karma denies them contentment.
Gemini is considered to be a strong, positive
intellectual sign, but throughout all of its as­
pects it is dominated by the subjective emo­
tional impulses of Taurus. Gemini people are
notoriously irritable and inconstant. One of
the chief professions of the sign is writing,
and literature as a whole is emotional and
artistic, and its inspiration comes much more
from Venus than from Mercury. Mercurial
people are strongly temperamental, often
moody, and not infrequently have morbid
imaginations. The negative Mercurial fre­
quently lacks integrity and is largely domin­
ated by impulses and sense gratification,
which is brought over from Venus the ruler
of Taurus.
Cancer is a negative sign, strongly sympa­
thetic and frequently a victim of inadequate
mental control. The bad Karma of Gemini
works out through the dubious reasoning
powers of the Cancer type. The undeveloped
Cancer persons develop the most extraordin­
ary attitudes on the numerous problems of
life and relationship. Their sympathies do
their thinking for them and sentimental anti­
pathies breed furious dislikes. Failure to orient
in the intellectual sphere while living under
(42)
the Gemini influence means a scattered exis­
tence under Cancer, with the thinking powers
partly eclipsed by the hallucinations of the
sentiments.
Leo is a positive sign, but is frequently a
victim of the evils of the sign Cancer. Un­
balanced Leo types frequently suffer from
some form of obsession, a malady peculiar to
the psychism of Cancer. The obsession may
range from a diyinity complex to a highly
aggravated infallibility complex. Leo people
frequently feel that they are not as other
mortals, that they are made by a special
pattern, peculiarly endowed with semi-divine
attributes. Their professions may vary, but
whether they be evangelists or dictators, artists
or financiers, they are overwhelmed with the
impulse to reform. Leo is a sign of parenthood
and teaching and Leo people feel that they
are the fathers and teachers of all mankind.
Virgo is a negative sign and is, so to speak,
the let-down from Leo. Virgo people very
often find Leo circumstances thrust upon
them and they are forced by conditions be­
yond their control into positions of responsi­
bility and leadership. The Virgo mind natur­
ally seeks comfort, security and protection,
but is seldom privileged to enjoy either. It is a
sign of responsibility and signifies the servant
(43)
and the bread-winner. T he sign of Leo is
frequently associated w ith monetary affairs
and the problems of Virgo are usually mone­
tary ones. If Virgo inherits a good Karma
¡from its Leo past, then it may be placed in
positions of responsibility and trust and be
come an administrator of power and author­
ity. If the Leo person has tram pled on others
in his path to power, he is apt to find his Vir­
go incarnation one of hopeless limitation and
financial reverse.
Libra is a positive sign and is regarded as
one of the most artistic of the twelve. Though
under the rulership of Venus, Libra manifests
many tendencies of the Mercurial sign which
precedes it. Libra frequently revolts against
class limitation and rises to superiority usual­
ly from humble ancestry. In other words, it
is a climbing sign. T w o good examples of
this climbing tendency of Libra are Napoleon
Bonaparte and Adolph H ider. Virgo symbol­
izes the proletariat and the fundam ental psy­
chology of Libra is a struggle against medioc­
rity. From its V irgo background the Libra
type also secures the capacity to judge human
nature. Libra types become public idols be­
cause of the ability to handle people. Their
bad Karm a however frequendy limits their
(44)
capacity to rem ain in high position, and dis­
aster follows honor.
Scorpio is a negative sign, yet in many ways
it manifests a strength not always to be found
in positive signs. But again the course of the
impulses is introverted. Scorpio’s great prob­
lem is emotional control. The emotions of
Scorpio arc not derived from Mars, the ruler
of the sign, but from the accumulated Karma
of Libra ruled by the emotional planet Venus,
Libra signifies justice and its symbol is the
scales. But w here bad Karma has caused the
Libra native to depart from standards of in­
tegrity, the distortion of the justice sense
comes out in Scorpio, where truth becomes
involved in a thousand emotional reflexes and
loses all semblance to integrity. It is the bad
K arm a of Scorpio to always know that it is
right, w hether it is right or not. It becomes
its own standard of integrity. In a highly
advanced Scorpio this sense of justice may be
highly perfected and lead to great attainment
in the occult arts, but in a less developed type
judgm ent is usually hopelessly biased by the
intensities of the emotions.
Sagittarius is a positive sign and seems to
deliberately revolt against the introversions of
Scorpio. T he Sagittarian is a good organizer
and promoter. H e receives these qualities as
(45)
a legacy from Scorpio, but he puts them to
much more evident use. The Sagittarian is
usually entirely open and above-board with
his plans. This is a reaction from the Scorpio
secretiveness. Sagittarius is a religious sign,
which again is due to the strong emotional
influence of Scorpio. Sagittarius is also the
sign of long journeys on water, yet is not it­
self a water sign but borrows its affinity to
liquids from Scorpio. Sagittarians frequently
engage in occupations of a Scorpio nature, as
medicine, occultism, diplomacy, etc. The
Karmic tie between the two signs often mani­
fests as dissipation, which is a negative Scor­
pio weakness.
Capricorn is a negative sign, though in
many ways one of the strongest and most en­
during of the twelve. In no sign is there more
danger of introversion than in this one. The
negative quality of the sign turns all the im­
pulses back upon themselves and makes nor­
mal mental, emotional, and physical expres­
sion difficult. Yet Capricorn people are filled
with the bubbling enthusiasm of Sagittarius.
They are an independent, ambitious, naturally
progressive group of people, but their normal
expression is made almost impossible because
of a peculiar crystallized personality. The
Capricorn person inherits from his Sagittarian
(46)
incarnation high aspirations and widely scat­
tered resources. The lesson of Capricorn is
a moderating of all extremes of living. Most
of all, the Capricorn native must master the
impatience and inordinate ambition of the
Sagittarian and settle down to an apprecia­
tion of reasonable and simple things. Capri­
corn people are often unhappy not so much
from the evils of their state, but from the com­
parison between their present position and
some abstract standard towards which their
ambitions are pointed.
Aquarius is the last of the positive signs and
inherits from Capricorn a peculiar fixation of
viewpoint in the midst of an otherwise almost
complete inconsistency. Aquarius is termed
the sign of the liberals, and from social
reform to dietetics the Aquarian is apt to be
found pointing out the advantages of some­
thing new, and the hopeless disadvantage of
things as they are. It may be said that Aquar­
ians are born in the objective case. One that
I know once referred to himself as one of
the cranks that make the world go round.
The sign is original and capable, and receives
from Cparicorn certain psychic undercurrents
which strongly influence all of its activities.
First, it embodies the 'Capricorn tenacity of
viewpoint and at the same time it lives in a
(47)
constant state of revolt against Capricorn con-
servatism and accepted institutions. From
Capricorn also comes a definite strain of mel­
ancholia, and like Capricornians, Aquarians
have very few close friends. This is not be­
cause people do not like them, but because
they cannot penetrate the Aquarian aura of
super-individuality. The Aquarians should
try to overcome the Capricorn Karma of iso­
lation and try to mingle in a happy genuine
way with the numerous interests of mankind.
Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac and is
also a negative sign. As the 12th house rules
Karma particularly, and Pisces is the 12th
house sign and the last division of the Zodiac,
it has special Karmic significance. Aquarius
is the greatest energy waster in the Zodiac,
because people born under that sign do not
know how to relax. This waste is reflected in
the debilities of the Piscean. Pisces also is
completing a cycle and gathering up the
loose ends of incarnations in the preceding
eleven signs. The result is a heavy load of
Karma. When the Karmic debt to the uni­
verse has been paid in the Pisces incarnation,
the incarnating soul is then ready to start out
afresh with a considerable part of Karma sub­
limated ijnto soul^goygcty
