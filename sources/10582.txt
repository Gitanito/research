            		Experience Description:   

I was out of my office after work, when I wanted to pass the road I saw a car in high speed coming in my direction. After a few seconds I felt a strange comfortable feeling I didn't have it before at although the hard of the accident. The accident was at 11:00 in the morning. After, I felt as if I was flying on the air. Though the weather was very hot, I couldn't feel the heat. Then I heard somebody in the road tried to get me to say the words which Muslims say before dying which is 'No Gods but one God, and Muhammad is a prophet of the God.' Then I felt very happy moments I didn't experience at all in my life. I didn't feel pain at all. But I woke up when entering the hospital and heard the voices of the nurses and doctors.
