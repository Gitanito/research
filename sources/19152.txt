well our
mortuary had the contract for all
military services out at the
roswell army airfield and this
gentleman called and said he was a
mortuary officer at the base
he needed some information and i said
what do you need you said
how many uh hermetically sealed infant
caskets do you have
three and a half four foot in stock and
so we don&#39;t have any
how long would it take you to get them
and i said well i can call amarillo
by 3 30 this afternoon and have him in
here in the morning
i said what&#39;s going on he said that&#39;s
not important i said well it is
important also but anyway then i hung up
then he called back later and he said
i need more information and you won&#39;t
know what embalming chemicals that would
alter the tissue the stomach contents
and what is our preparation for
uh taking care of bodies that laying out
in the ailments
for several days and i said you&#39;re the
mortuary officer and you&#39;re asking me
because i do it your way you know
i&#39;ve tried to find out who i was talking
to
but there again i
was very stupid and i hung up again and
so
but anyway later on the day i got an
emergency we had a
the only ambush business in roswell at
that time
and this airman was riding an old indian
motorcycle and he hit the back end of a
farmer&#39;s trailer
out here going into the gym and so when
i arrived at the base where i usually
back up to this ramp and unload the
patients there was three field
army air air force
hamlets backed up against the rim and uh
so i had to swing around but anyway we
were walking up the ramp and i saw a lot
of debris
and so when i got in and checked him in
got all the vouchers and everything
signed i said
this captain there and i said sir it
looked like we had a crash
i need to get ready for it and who in
the hell are you and what are you doing
here
and i said well i had an emergency and
we had the contract from military
services
it looks like he had a crash he just
said stay right here don&#39;t move and so i
stayed there and pretty soon he came
back with two military police and said
get this guy off of the base you&#39;re not
supposed to be here
whenever this happened whatever it
happened
all the doctors and nurses that were
stationed here in that area and
everything were given that were
stationed here permanently we were given
orders not to report
because my understanding and everything
later on it came that
the reason for that being that these
were all specialists and they were all
sent in from wright patterson
and so anyway
what he wanted know from me
i had seen some uh had seen
evidently i was involved in things that
i shouldn&#39;t have been involved in
when you said you saw some debris can
you go back i saw that and that&#39;s what
started it but
what he really wanted to know later on
see i knew this nurse and this nurse
said
she didn&#39;t get orders not to report
either because she was going to join the
saint mary&#39;s order and her hospital was
the saint mary&#39;s
and she would come up like on the
weekends and not go back until
you know until her weekend started again
and she&#39;d go in
when she went in to sign in for an extra
turn anyway
that&#39;s when uh they were in this supply
room
and uh there were two pathologists
i understood they were from
wright-patterson they were not doing an
autopsy they were examining what was
brought in from the roswell crash what
we call the roswell crash
and uh but the reason that
she started out the door and then they
said lieutenant we still have to have
some help
and this is what you&#39;re going to do and
they wanted her and so they&#39;d take a
forcep and turn a hand she&#39;d say four
fragile fingers so many centimeters and
all this kind of stuff
and she said she hadn&#39;t wasn&#39;t in there
over 20 or 30 minutes at the most
and all their eyes and it started
burning in their skin they were feeling
it was getting real warm and real hot so
that&#39;s when they just immediately they
had no idea what they had the
two pathologists said there wasn&#39;t
anything in there
in the anatomy books there wasn&#39;t
anything in what our medical schools
they had never seen anything like this
and that&#39;s immediately after that they
were put in these uh
pouches but in a hermetically sealed
container and flown directly to wright
patterson
and she actually described for you what
they look like
yeah when i uh the mps were taking me
out
down the hall that&#39;s when she came out
of this supply room with this towel over
her face and that&#39;s when she screamed
then get out of here as fast as you can
and i met her then i kept calling and i
met her the next morning at the officers
club in a conference room and
that&#39;s when she gave me a little diagram
of what they were going on what
what they look like and it looks like
what you see today
most of the little diagrams you know the
four fragile fingers and the long arm
real short joint the large eyes
she said the heads were almost
completely demolished but they could see
they only had two orifices they didn&#39;t
have earlobes they had two ear canals
the mouth is only about one inch and
that&#39;s why she described it to me
and i was with her until about 11 30
that day and then at
3 30 that afternoon her supervisor
called and said your friend just been
transferred out
and i had a serial number and everything
else but i never have found her to this
day i&#39;ve never made contact with her so
i&#39;m sure i think the best thing they she
was going to join a convent and i&#39;d
imagine they&#39;d discharge it and let her
go
it&#39;s good place to keep somebody quiet
and he came up to him and
he was punching me on the shoulder just
lightly i mean he wasn&#39;t rough anything
and he just said look mister you don&#39;t
go in and start any rumors and roswell&#39;s
nothing happened down here
and he said if you do you you know it&#39;d
be real serious problems
and then
so i just being as
my character was at that time i said i&#39;m
a civilian you can go to hill
and that&#39;s where he said you may be the
one going to hell
and then that&#39;s when he really told me
he said somebody be picking your bones
out of sin if you do that so
it didn&#39;t look like plane crash it
didn&#39;t look like
aluminum or you burn aluminum because
i&#39;ve seen a lot of that in stainless
steel but
what it looked like of course it didn&#39;t
have any in those days what it looked
like more it was a real light gray
almost of white
and some of it was a real dark gray
grave it looked more like what
fiberglass might look like today
and it it wasn&#39;t dead or anything it was
then there wasn&#39;t any dents but what it
was is in pieces looked like it had been
twisted and shredded and all this kind
of stuff
but i didn&#39;t see any real sharp dance of
course i didn&#39;t stand there and look at
it either you know
just what i noticed on the way going out
but i know it was very thin i could see
that it was very very thin
i didn&#39;t want to embarrass my family for
the first place
next thing i didn&#39;t that being in the
march we&#39;ve been this is not an easy
business
and i didn&#39;t want to embarrass the
funeral home i didn&#39;t want to embarrass
uh
my father was a no contractor and i
didn&#39;t want to embarrass him because
if i had to come out who was an alien
you know and all this back in those days
hell they would have left me out of town
my folks near i thought it would be very
embarrassing
and i didn&#39;t want it mainly i idolized
my father
and i didn&#39;t want to embarrass him
because he and i was very very close
and i and i was told
one of those one of those
sergeants out there said well let him go
hell nobody&#39;s going to believe him
anyway nobody&#39;s going to believe this
anyway so
but i that didn&#39;t have anything to do
with it it was my family that i wanted
to protect
and the funeral goodness he was scared
to death he says
but he managed to take a tumble weave
and throw under it when it was faded
when it was gone just to see if he was
hallucinating or
if it was real it came back again
he says that he touched it it was cool
to the touch on the side
he says when it disappeared again or
went back out of phase again
the tumbleweed was crushed so he knew it
was physical
