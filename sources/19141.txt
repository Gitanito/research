I wanted to open this up now for
questions and there are a number of that
have come in and where did you check
them over there okay so I&#39;ll just look
at these and because there&#39;s not a mic
in the audience and we want the people
on the webinar and everyone to hear it
so one question is that are there
benevolent and forward-thinking
allied governments or research
organizations yes there are a number
that are working to resolve this problem
though here&#39;s the issue is that the
center of gravity is mainly us but the
way this these programs are structure is
that they&#39;re transnational now notice
I&#39;m using the word transnational rather
than international international what
connotes something like through the UN
conventional government to conventional
government the management of these
operations is that there are satellite
programs that are embedded within other
countries all over the world and those
are operating under primarily US but not
exclusive US control mainly because this
is the center of gravity economically
but more importantly technologically and
also military spending if you took the
top 10 countries in the world besides
the u.s. added up their entire defense
budgets it would be less than the u.s.
expenditure so that&#39;s one of the big
problems is is that the amount of
resources that can be siphoned off as
sort of a contingency 10 or 20 percent
contingency out of US defense and
intelligence and related spending is so
large that that by itself our black
budget eclipses the next largest country
in the world
entire budget now this means that it&#39;s
very difficult you know some years ago
the Ministry of Defense of France was
working with us on a ce-5 initiative you
all know about the French Connection and
we did an expedition to France the cover
story was a training for a group of 60
people out on this estate in Normandy
and but you know one of the senior
administer defense officials Admiral
Moran was there with his assistant and
they had satellite systems and tracking
systems set up and we did the ce-5 and
they were very I have a beautiful
document from the French government
committing to a long term
forward-looking effort to make peaceful
contact with these civilizations and
it&#39;s officially signed you know I
released that a couple of years ago
those of you haven&#39;t seen it you should
go to our website serious disclosure
comm s IRI US disclosure calm and it you
know you have to navigate around but
it&#39;s it&#39;s up there and there are a lot
of countries the problem is is that the
well intending people in a few countries
even if they&#39;re fairly in court in g7
countries have a very difficult time
taking on this cabal of operations
moreover there are people inside those
governments who will sabotage their
efforts and this is a big problem so it
needs to get you know corrected it
really needs some courageous leadership
last month I you know I read at the end
of that webinars you may have seen a
draft address for a world leader to make
addressing the public on this issue I
don&#39;t know if you all saw it I&#39;m gonna
release it soon I was asked to write
that for a point of contact I have two
President Trump and a point of contact I
have two President Putin of Russia and
there are people concerned at those
levels but they&#39;re really not in control
and I think that support yes
moral support
certainly tangible change coming from a
governmental entity I haven&#39;t seen it in
20-some years so I do see that the
public is awakening I mean it&#39;s a good
thing that a hundred thousand people a
day are seeing unacknowledged we&#39;re
gonna come out the next big educational
documentary we&#39;re gonna do is gonna be
on Close Encounters at the 5th kind in
higher states of consciousness and
there&#39;s something else that I can&#39;t talk
about that&#39;s going to be a major even
larger event so one of the things that
we&#39;re trying to do is bypass government
because and it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think
government is important I just think
that it&#39;s extraordinarily dysfunctional
and broken and I think it&#39;s more likely
that the people awakening to this and
knowing what the truth is and then
taking affirmative positive steps such
as forming their own interplanetary
contact team so that close encounters
are the fifth kind in ishutin
using those protocols which you know
people who have just downloaded the app
the called the et contact tool that we
have you link to it from our website on
the iTunes Store or wherever have found
that they can use those protocols and
the remote viewing training that&#39;s in
that app go out and they have amazing
contact experiences having never been on
one of these week-long expeditions with
us so I think that everyone can empower
themselves to do that as far as
governments what I do now when I have a
meetings with people in the government
and the mainstream is sort of a service
that because I feel they have a need to
know and they should know my
expectations however are rather low that
they&#39;re going to take the issue on
because they have to bite some very big
hands they have to they have to bite the
hands of the most powerful intelligence
and military operations in the world
that have lethal force they have to bite
the hands of the oil gas coal nuclear
power public utility macro-economic
petro dollar gang banksters system
which they&#39;re all they&#39;re all nursing on
they&#39;re all you know they&#39;re all sort of
feeding off that system because when you
come out with these technologies for
peaceful use you will terminate very
quickly hundreds of trillions of dollars
in assets you&#39;ll have a new civilization
you&#39;ll end poverty Olympus used peaceful
you&#39;ll have a world that is capable of
interplanetary exploration peacefully
however the stakeholders that are out
there we&#39;re out there a hundred years
ago with the JPMorgan&#39;s and the
Rockefellers and what-have-you they&#39;re
still out there and but they&#39;re you know
X generations later but actually more
powerful the centralization of money and
power isn&#39;t in the governments it&#39;s in
the private banking and corporate sector
to give you an idea the derivatives
involved with the trading of commodities
alone Chicago Board of Trade and futures
is around seven or eight hundred
trillion dollars a year the US federal
budgets what four or five trillion
go do the math okay so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a
complicated problem and I have never met
a world leader or Minister of Defense or
a head of an intelligence Directorate or
mi6 or Minister of Defense overseas or
in this country who wants to try to take
that on nevermind a senator or a
congressman so I think that that kind of
leadership and courage and integrity has
to come from you guys and from us you
know I think I and it&#39;s not that all to
dismiss government it&#39;s just to say if
they want to make themselves irrelevant
they have then they&#39;ll be irrelevant to
the future that they want to make
themselves relevant they can jump on
board at any time and someone had asked
the question about Trump&#39;s space force I
think we talked about that a moment ago
how many a RVs have been created and so
far in total on the face of the earth or
underground and
how many of those are privately or
corporately owned and how many are
government-owned that&#39;s a good question
they number in the thousands it&#39;s not
just a few they&#39;ve gone through multiple
generation of these man-made UFOs from
the 50s to now pretty much every form
and shape that an ET craft has taken
they try to replicate now here&#39;s an
important distinction when you&#39;re up
close and see one of these that are
man-made you&#39;re gonna notice there are
seams rivets sections parts the et craft
do not have those they&#39;re seamless and
just a quick example of ET manufacturing
when we manufacture something we you
know we dig something up at out of the
ground and then smelt the iron or the
aluminum or whatever and then make
sheets of metal and rivet them together
bla bla bla right no that&#39;s not how an
interstellar civilization manufactures
which is why all these things about all
they have to come to the earth which
they have they&#39;re such things here they
have to have I&#39;m going oh yeah right you
know nothing about transdimensional
interstellar physics so you&#39;re able to
set up a standing wave a resonant field
that is in the near astral like a
blueprint like an architectural
blueprint and resonate it and
materialize it bring it into this
dimension all in a part it&#39;s why they&#39;re
seamless and this is why one of the
comical stories I like to tell is this
captain of a naval contract vessel that
was retrieving ICBMs that were being
fired downrange in the South Atlantic
contacted me years ago because they had
one of these ET craft on radar at night
and they were able to triangulate it and
apparently their command center hit it
with one of these electromagnetic
weapons and I believe in 1963 and the
captain of this research vessel that we
ended up retrieving it the next date
went in he contacted me mainly they gave
me the information but also he had
another
one of these questions that he had they
couldn&#39;t understand and the ET was in a
metallus eyes sort of uniform and it was
all one piece and it didn&#39;t have any
zippers or buttons or anything he&#39;s and
he was his old crusty neba guy he says
why do I don&#39;t understand how in the
world could he have gotten in and out of
that there&#39;s no way to get in it no way
to get out of it you&#39;d have the living
in all his life I said no but they set
up a an electromagnetic electromagnetic
field and it actually formed fits
materializes around him all in one piece
in a fraction of a second and the
uniform is in of itself also integrated
into his bio electric field and
communication systems so it&#39;s not just
clothing you know I made in a slave
factory in Bangladesh
you know bought by Banana Republic or
whatever sorry but you know I think what
you have to understand is that you&#39;re
dealing with civilizations whose
technologies are not what we are trying
to answer eccentric we project on them
so there are thousands of and they&#39;re
not just in the u.s. they&#39;re an
underground basis underwater bases
Australia UK around the world that are
man-made but they&#39;re not used all that
much but they&#39;ve gone through a number
of series of developments but they&#39;re
not at the level of refinement of an
transdimensional interstellar spacecraft
in terms of how they look how they
operate how they feel and it&#39;s important
thing for you to know because if you&#39;re
out doing you know ce-5 contact you know
is it real or is it Memorex like the old
commercial used to say is an ET craft or
was it one of ours sometimes you don&#39;t
know until you get a closer or more
intimate event happen like the ET
resonantly forms in the circle with you
or begins to speak actually one of the
ones that we photographed at Joshua Tree
was actually speaking right outside the
circle there were five four or five of
them
but they were noncorporeal you couldn&#39;t
see any bodies you could hear them
speaking everyone did and we got quiet
and a friend of mine Raven took a
photograph and here&#39;s this et who I
named is you he told me his name was
Bijou from Andromeda two and a half
million light-years from here beautiful
experience and that then continued on
the rest of the night with all manner of
an incredible intimate contact so the
the man-made machines are going to look
and feel like a machine they&#39;re going to
be invasive and they&#39;re going to have
structural parts you can tell that they
were manufactured together but there are
quite a few of them so look that I don&#39;t
know if that clarified or not I&#39;m trying
to use each question to go in to share
stuff that I think is important as
there&#39;s a question here if I think that
all are some abduction experiences are
instigated by the military or the
alphabet agencies yeah let me be really
clear about this there are people who
had contact with ETS and they may have
been frightened or startled by it and
there are people who have been abducted
by things that look alien that
absolutely are being done by the
intelligence community and there&#39;s an
area of overlap where people don&#39;t know
what&#39;s going on because this the the
stagecraft the ability to hoax one
versus the other is so good
interestingly wouldn&#39;t when Stan
romanette when we were at his house and
he had this he should played this tape
of someone who had called and left a
message for him Ricky was there and we
and there was someone who was trying to
give him a heads-up and they were using
a synthesized British sounding voice and
this event that had happened I think of
the next day or very recently after that
this this person called using this
computer-generated voice saying Stan it
was one of the fake ones we didn&#39;t know
what a fake one meant I said well it&#39;s a
man-made one so there are people who
have had actual contact with ETS and
have acts where on board experiences
that&#39;s how I got involved with this from
a event that happened
to me when I was 18 and then there are
people who have had very invasive events
happen from the intelligence community
and paramilitary operations that look
100% alien but aren&#39;t and then sometimes
you don&#39;t know which was which I&#39;m not
saying people haven&#39;t had contact at all
I&#39;m just saying that you have to have
this in your differential diagnosis as
we say in medicine and one of my
concerns is you know I was had contacted
years ago by the head of something
called the intruders foundation that but
Hopkins had and the executive director
called me up he says dr. Greer you don&#39;t
know how right you are we have a lot of
people in our group that have said
they&#39;ve been abducted and in their
memories they see that the things that
look like aliens are actually being
commanded and directed by military
personnel but that&#39;s all being sanitized
out of the reports to the public on the
other hand people have had actual
contact with ETS where it was a positive
experience or healing experience or in
life those we leave out totally and
there is this sampling skew selective
data cherry-picking of stuff that has
gone on in the abduction and UFO
research community for 40 or 40 years or
more that&#39;s worrisome because what that
means is the public is only being
presented with the stage crafted
disinformation part of the picture and
the rest gets taken out I didn&#39;t believe
it when I first heard it and it turned
out it 100 percent true so this is where
I become very like very questioning of
when someone has an experience I have to
drill down on what part of it might have
been actually key or was it something
being done by these advanced systems
electromagnetic mental physical
transdimensional that the intelligence
community has because I know they have
them and they know they&#39;ve deployed them
many many many many times probably
thousands of times the question always
is if you can&#39;t tell the difference then
what do you make of it within you to say
well we don&#39;t know you have to be
agnostic I mean is you sometimes you
don&#39;t know what what the what the
initiating source of the experience was
but you have to keep an open mind and
try to get more data more information
and try to get to the truth I mean after
all this is no mean science and and also
exploration it&#39;s about finding the truth
wherever it leads you now this
particular truth has made me quite hated
and in the UFO subculture as sort of an
apologist for the evil aliens I&#39;m going
well you know I&#39;m just trying to explain
what&#39;s actually going on alright there&#39;s
a question about it is there any insight
on the release of new technologies and
what them insiders are saying I think
that there there are some people as I
mentioned there&#39;s an initiative out of
Salt Lake City that&#39;s a private
corporation Equity Research that has a
anti grab what&#39;s interesting to me is
that that is being it&#39;s been intercepted
by the intelligence community who at
this time or pretending to be friendly
to it to support its disclosure as of a
month or two ago now what I don&#39;t know
is if they&#39;re going to go through with
it and if they do how it will be spun
because unfortunately this system is not
just a zero-point energy generating
system it&#39;s one that they&#39;ve developed
the capability of tapping into these
interdimensional fields as well as
life-forms and that that I&#39;ve been told
is of interest for its psychological
warfare value to disclose that as what
aliens are and as distinct from
transdimensional extraterrestrial
biological that are from other star
systems and I think this is the question
is will that technology be disclosed for
purposes that could be good
for the human future or it will it be
part of a counterintelligence initiative
that&#39;s what I&#39;m fighting right now I do
know it&#39;s been fast-tracked and approved
the last I heard it was for disclosure I
understand here in Colorado and end of
April early May they had a week-long
meeting with a lot of government and
other people to discuss this and the
outcome of which is unknown so I&#39;m not
sure where that&#39;s going I&#39;m hoping that
they do not use it in the way that I
have been told they intend to which
would be in the direction of really
misinforming dis informing the public
about this we&#39;re always looking for
people who have on their own figured out
so-called zero point or technologies
there are some that we&#39;re pursuing now
up in Canada
so far we&#39;ve never found one that past&#39;s
is muster both technologically but also
strategically meaning that they&#39;re
willing to have it disclosed on a
massive scale on an open-source non
intellectual property basis what I mean
by that is if you go the IP route
intellectual property route and the
patenting route it&#39;s going to get
intercepted you&#39;re gonna get a national
security order on it if you go through
the conventional funding mechanism it&#39;s
also going to be a takedown there are
about a thousand ways these technologies
get in snared and every single inventor
and investor group that I know that&#39;s
stepped into this space has fallen into
one or more of those traps so we have a
very specific requirement that the first
now is they need to be financially
compensated there are people that I&#39;m
working with who have that ability to do
so very easily and I don&#39;t want it but
it&#39;s you know substantial to get it
clear to be an open source system open
source meaning that it would be dumped
on the internet no secrecy no patent no
intellectual property hole
back massively disclosed so someone had
a hundred million dollars twenty million
dollars could go to acquire and further
developed a technology eighty needs to
go into the disclosure of it so that
every man woman and child would have
access to the Internet on planet earth
which is at least half the planet would
know about it that has to happen because
if it&#39;s secret and it&#39;s small it will
vanish and they always vanish and the
team will vanish as well so we are
pursuing that from speaking personally I
try to avoid technologies that are not
if the holders of the technology and
particularly the the money people don&#39;t
want to go through that strategic
pathway even if they&#39;re compensated then
I don&#39;t really want to even know about
it because they&#39;re gonna all be
assassinated you know the people who
acquired Stan Meyers material we were
trying to get it through my project the
Orion project a group that had more
money than we had because we only had a
few hundred thousand ended up acquiring
it up in Michigan an engineering group a
couple years later I get a call from
their chief funder who is Lord so-and-so
I&#39;m not gonna say his name here up in
Great Britain and he says look you know
they&#39;ve gotten these things operational
including Stan Meyers toroid and he had
a doughnut-shaped object that had a
national security order on it and that
was the main thing we were wanting to
get and this group got it operational
and it was over unity it was putting out
free energy it had a kind of a liquefied
magnetically charged material in the
center of this toroid and murder
incorporated came after them and they
were getting death threats and all kinds
of problems all kinds of WS FM
electromagnetic weapons systems and they
were their fantasy was that they were
gonna evacuate to a eco friendly country
I&#39;d say you&#39;d have to go to an eco
friendly planet there is no country on
this planet that these henchmen won&#39;t
find you so I wrote out of three
Paige strategic thing they needed to do
instantly to protect themselves and
protect the technology that included a
massive data dump into the internet and
a press conference in getting it out of
their own hands in a secretive corporate
way they wouldn&#39;t do it and the last I
heard they&#39;ve all been assassinated
they&#39;re all dead
so I&#39;ve been through from 1991 to now
probably dozens of these sort of
initiatives they&#39;ve all ended in
absolute mine crushing heartbreaking
disasters I won&#39;t do it anymore it has
to be someone who understands what
they&#39;re up against and most of the tech
most of the engineering people think oh
I have a better mousetrap the world will
beat a path to my door no murder
incorporated it&#39;s going to be to pass
your door first and or they think that
you know I&#39;m going to outwit the
intelligence community I was talking to
a guy in Orange County had one of these
we&#39;re gonna put it into a hundred and
fifty different patents and they won&#39;t
know what we have I said they have know
what you have already I&#39;ve already heard
from people at the agency about what
you&#39;re doing you you have I so of course
they monitor everything in real-time
Hey as soon as you have a device
operating that taps into that field
the zero-point field are related that&#39;s
picked up by a satellite the same as if
you can set off a nuclear weapon they
know what you have when you have it
before you have it or in
contemporaneously at the same time I
said you&#39;re delusional if you think
you&#39;re gonna trick anyone in the
unacknowledged special access project
world they have these kinds of
technologies and be off the radar
there&#39;s another guy up in Canada I met
with a year ago and he said oh well
we&#39;re gonna put it in power plants in
Africa nobody will know we have it boy
or the rock I&#39;m gonna kill myself right
now you know it&#39;s just like so
completely ridiculous because there&#39;s
they just don&#39;t understand strategically
what they&#39;re up against that and this is
the Achilles heel of people who are
brilliant engineers and we even
brilliant
fien on Sears they think it&#39;s like
coming out with a new version of an
iPhone
it isn&#39;t you&#39;re coming out with
something that&#39;s going to terminate
hundreds of trillions of dollars of oil
gas coal banking petrodollar etc
macroeconomic power not just money power
those folks are going to do everything
within their ability to stop you so your
your you have a handful of petrol Nazis
and gang banksters who want this stopped
but you have seven and a half billion
people who&#39;ll be on your side give it to
the people so that&#39;s my message there&#39;s
a way to do it it&#39;s a heavy lift and
even then it&#39;s dangerous now frankly I
think that the first level of disclosure
on those technologies needs to be a
stationary and always sit on your table
here or set up where your heat pump is
that would be an energy generating
system I think that the things that are
teleportation or anti grab and
what-have-you that can be weaponized
into a missile delivery system needs to
be a second level of disclosure in terms
of an Applied Technology because
obviously that anything that can be
applied by anyone once they have the
knowledge into a weapon delivery system
and that gets into this other big
question of what are we gonna do when we
grow up as a people you know I mean
we&#39;re stuck in the 1800s paradigm with
our energy and technology no fool
yourself with all your little computer
gadgets I mean everything this planet is
running on is circa 1800s late 1800s oil
gas coal even nuclear is mid nineteen
hundreds so if we want to move on to a
level one civilization this has to come
out but it cannot come out if it&#39;s going
to be used in a weaponized way so we
have to have an evolution of
consciousness and the structures within
society to have let&#39;s call it an
enforceable peace I know that sounds
like a contradiction but where we
maintain the world in a stable peaceful
state so these technologies can be used
safely to then transform the world from
a place that&#39;s collapsing
environmentally but also in terms of the
suffering and poverty on the planet and
could be transformed into a prosperous
abundant stable environment clean
environment and the earth
she is a conscious living being and she
will she will be able to heal herself
very quickly if we stop abusing her but
we keep abusing her and we have to lift
the burden from the earth and these
scientists and technologies would do it
but where it&#39;s not a step forward if we
bring the technologies out and then
they&#39;re applied to be put into a
different a new weapon system now in all
honesty that&#39;s what&#39;s already happened
between 1940s and now the most advanced
of these technologies are in the
absolute worst possible hands many of
them and who are not being overseen by
We the People or our government of We
the People or by any accountable agency
and what that means is the people who
are the holders and controllers of those
systems it&#39;s sort of checkmate and this
gets into a really deep problem I&#39;d
begin one of the things that happened
when I was briefing the head of
intelligence for the Joint Staff Admiral
Wilson he was very upset about all of
this and he had made an inquiry into
these projects prior to my meeting with
him and I did a what&#39;s called a stand-up
briefing the Pentagon for him and Astra
Edgar Mitchell was with me and a few
other people I was teaching I was
teaching
Eggar Mitchell about these things and he
when I was in this briefing at the end I
said we really need your help
Admiral in disclosing this information
and getting these technologies under
control and into folks like you the
white hats which is most of the people
in the military intelligence community
are very good people actually but we
need your help he says well what am I
going to do I&#39;ve learned that there are
groups that are denying me access
because he had tried to access one of
these connect knowledge compartmented
projects
and they said sir we will not read you
into this and hung up on him
he says but they won&#39;t let me in and the
best thing I have that I know about is
to be too stealth and they have things
that are a hundred generations further
along that are anti-gravity induced
circles around my be to sell its point
set match he says I&#39;ve been checkmated
number one number two he said who else
have you met with who is being denied
access like I am I said well the current
director of the CIA and the president
and the Secretary of Defense Cohen and
people like that and he said well what
the hell am I gonna do if I don&#39;t get an
order from the civilian commanders then
I&#39;m going rogue
how do I get control of it and they
won&#39;t give me the order because they&#39;re
scared shitless that&#39;s when I realized
between 93 and 97 98 we have to do this
so and we have to bring out the sciences
the technologies the information and
also be the ambassadors of peace to
these civilizations that&#39;s what has to
happen how do we protect ourselves from
the technologies that are used to harm
or deceive us and how do we develop our
highest consciousness a great question
I like answering questions like this
there was a sort of apocryphal that
people learned through stories back in
94 and July 94 I was asked to meet with
Prince hans-adam von Lichtenstein the
Crown Prince of Liechtenstein who was
funding all the abduction cults in the
United States because as he worded it to
me he&#39;d like us to go to World War 3 so
that Jesus Christ would return and no
I&#39;m quoting so yeah I kid you not
anyway welcome to my world anyway so
doing so zing but that&#39;s the way my life
is I mean yeah anybody want to make a
movie so anyway so you know we have this
many our meeting and and you know he was
trying to convince me to cross over to
the dark side hate to sound like Star
Wars but and I said you know I
understand what&#39;s going on and but he
was really trying to convince me and he
said you know the reason I fund these
abduction groups is that I want people
to hate the alien so that we can make
the case for Armageddon in World War 3
now these of course Lichtenstein the
banking entities course funded Hitler
and now there&#39;s a lot of money going
into these programs I said well I don&#39;t
really share that paradigm world view
but so we had you know we agreed to
disagree and and what-have-you but what
happened that night is that I was at the
st. Moritz hotel on Central Park South
and my daughter was with one of my
daughters and there was I went to sleep
and there was an electromagnetic weapons
system that targeted me that&#39;s said oh
yeah
you don&#39;t want to go into that air we&#39;re
gonna hit you with one so they attempted
to abduct me now the way a lot of these
abductions are done is through what I
call an astral body extraction where
they target you and then try to pull out
your body and then you&#39;ll have an
experience thinking it was in your
physical body and you actually will have
physical stigmata when you get back in
it because the astral body and the body
of light actually manifests this one is
what you&#39;ve got to understand primacy is
with consciousness and the subtle
transdimensional interdimensional realms
that then manifest the 3d not the other
way around so I knew this was happening
it was actually really terrifying and I
was like oh so what I did I went in and
I meditated and I went into deep
meditation and called on the power of
God as I understand the supreme great
being and I transcended into sort of
this beautiful cosmic consciousness
state and stopped because the drop of my
individuality became
the ocean and they can&#39;t grab the ocean
they can only grab the drop got it so I
said this is the spirit warrior stuff I
was talking about that&#39;s the next
workshops gonna be a whole afternoon of
that so I think what people have to
understand is yes these systems are
frightening and they are effective but
only if you don&#39;t understand the
god-given gifts you have folded within
you and I love the quote that says think
it&#39;s thyself a puny form when within the
the universe is folded it&#39;s a rhetorical
question in other words you&#39;re not just
a little thing you have the entirety of
the cosmos and creation folded as a
quantum conscious hologram in every
single person so as you go into higher
states of consciousness and meditative
practice you begin to realize that that
can be used in very practical ways and
that&#39;s how I kind of cut off that
abduction attempt that make sense does
that help no you transcend beyond the
Astro because they&#39;re operating on
astral so that no quick trip through the
cosmology you have your physical body
you have your body of light you have the
essence the thought form that is your
individuality folded within all of that
is in and permeating it is the
consciousness field the consciousness
field is non-local infinite infinite
power eternal boundless when you connect
into that aspect of consciousness in
quiet mind you&#39;ve transcended the drop
is now the ocean and the power of the
ocean is at your is in your support
you&#39;re not isolating yourself in ego so
you have to go beyond even individuation
or individuality but that&#39;s the
transcendent experience of the
meditative state
well you know that first it just seems
like there&#39;s you&#39;re awake but you
weren&#39;t aware of anything it was just
aware aware of awareness pure
consciousness it&#39;s simple it&#39;s very
beautiful when I died in one I was 17
you may know the story I was raised a
devout atheist and I had this experience
where I died because I was very sick and
you know it&#39;s long story one time for it
but I had this experience of unity
consciousness where I became the
unboundedness of the cosmos and I were
singularity and it was beautiful but
that calls me to search how to do it
here so I learned meditation and the
first time I meditated Bing transcended
I went to Samadhi so what that was was
that I had the pathway was open even
though I was like this
seventeen-year-old kid that was raised
an atheist and enormous poverty and I
was all that but I realized oh well this
is everyone can do this now my
meditation teacher turned to looked at
me at the end of the twenty minute
meditation said will you transcend it of
course I was so naive I saw that what we
were supposed to do I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t
understand you were supposed to make a -
Riya bout this and flagellate yourself
for 50 years on a bed of nails in order
to go into this state but actually it&#39;s
incredibly simple it ordinarily simple
you just let go of yourself and in this
case I was using a mantra and then sits
like oh and then I became aware of
awareness and just only into that ocean
of unbounded mind so I got to where I
could do this at will very easily and
that&#39;s that&#39;s what I trained people now
to do because those when you&#39;re in that
state you&#39;re not in a you&#39;re not really
that vulnerable yeah I don&#39;t know for
whatever reason I mean well I was a
stupid jock who had an injury on my left
thigh and bicycle 200 miles and
this huge infection and then I had a bad
a renal syndrome and kidney failure and
I was so poor I was in high school
supporting myself in my own apartment
and I died you know because I didn&#39;t
couldn&#39;t go to a doctor it was too poor
to see a doctor you know because we
don&#39;t have healthcare in this country
speaking as a public emergency doctor
anyway so you know so but luckily you
know I survived well no I actually I
didn&#39;t want to come back I was asked to
but that&#39;s a long story long story
so you know that&#39;s one of the things
that you have to kind of understand is
that all these technologies it&#39;s like a
gnat flying in front of the Sun if you
understand the Sun is inside of each of
you so don&#39;t don&#39;t give it ice what I
said a while back
don&#39;t give this more power than it
deserves it doesn&#39;t deserve that much
power it is in a sense electromagnetic
witchcraft and dark magic and dark use
of energies but the light is always a
millionfold infinitely greater than the
dark and if you stay connected to that
don&#39;t worry about it and mean it won&#39;t
be difficult and they&#39;re the experiences
I&#39;ve had that are very scary and I&#39;ve
had a few near-death experiences and you
know you know the story back in the 90s
were three people my team through these
warfare systems got cancer the same
month I was one of them no you know so
yeah they can do some nasty stuff but we
you know I survived and unfortunately
two didn&#39;t and then the Wetworks teams
you know that when we were going to get
one of these technology systems from
Bill Colby the CIA director they killed
him made it look like an accidental
drowning but the week we were going to
meet with hit him with a member of my
board they found him floating down the
Potomac River and that&#39;s when for years
I&#39;d had people come to me and say do you
want protection you know from the
intelligence community who on our side
of this the white hats and I would say
no I don&#39;t want to get involved in that
spy versus spy stuff then I said yes
so that&#39;s in place so you know someone
crosses me at their great peril and I
won&#39;t have to I only know about it yes
well I mean there are people who have
natural out-of-body experiences that
frighten them just cause it&#39;s something
unusual and I&#39;m talking about a specific
electronic warfare system inducing it in
this case I knew I mean it was a
directional I mean I could even tell
what direction from the wind out of the
window this was coming at me from and
I&#39;m highly intuitive sort of like a dog
you know you know you look at it dog
will have us back to you and see if you
look at it will feel in turn I&#39;m like
that you know sort of like a big dog but
I love animals by the way that&#39;s a
compliment so it&#39;s something you
definitely can do and I think one of the
important things to learn from these
technologies is that they&#39;re all based
from what I said earlier think about the
Vedic cities sidd H is every single one
of those capabilities are folded within
you and Nate Lee and when you need them
and you to practice consciousness
development they will be there for you
now they may not be there all the time
but I have had a couple of levitation
experiences just because I didn&#39;t need
it it was just in a state and
spontaneously happen and I floated so
any of these experiences can come to you
spontaneously as you practice meditation
experience higher states of
consciousness and learn the structure of
the cosmos and as you go into that
journey and it is it&#39;s not religious
development but spiritual development
which I make a distinction between the
two since they&#39;re usually
180 degrees opposite not always but
frequently so religiosity and
spirituality are usually 180 degrees
opposites the dock for an overruns is
the spiritual part but at any rate if
you practice these and from whatever
tradition is works for you for me it was
the the meditative state and the the
ancient Vedic knowledge in the cities
but then I began to realize that those
were all not only mirrored in the
extra-terrestrial phenomenon of
teleportation by location solid objects
like here at Blanca peak a massive ET
craft and broad daylight went straight
into that mountain and didn&#39;t hit it
because it was just slightly able to
resonantly shift its field so solid
matter can go straight through solid
matter as you realize you know most of
this quote matter that makes up your
body if you cook the space out of it
would fit on the tip of a needle a tip
of a pen that&#39;s how much matter you or
the rest is this other energy field so
if you just took the matter and moved it
a little bit out of spin or angular
momentum with other solid systems you
could pass right through it which is
what a vedic master does when he walks
through a wall right or an ET craft when
the shifted and goes straight into the
earth or ensure the water and doesn&#39;t
explode because it&#39;s not no atom of the
one is touching the other does this make
sense
so but think about that you have that
ability built within you within your
hardware into your software of a human
or of an ET so all these technologies
need that you can demystify them by
understanding yourself and understanding
your own spiritual capabilities and what
the capabilities are in humanity and the
beauty of that is that then is not so
alien it&#39;s actually very natural but you
there is a sort of an education on
discovery process to that that has
to do with with understanding what the
human potential is which is enormous
beautiful there was a question about the
any of these civilizations can protect
us if they wish from anything here&#39;s the
big problem and I&#39;m glad you asked this
question the reason I met with the head
of the Defense Intelligence Agency in
1990s early 2000s was to read him into
these projects that he was being denied
access to and give him a warning that
our systems in on earth and in space had
become so developed that they had become
an existential threat to et operations
and that the ETS for millions of years
and one few civilizations for upwards of
a billion years have been guardians
protecting life on Earth but when we
force them too far out of this dimension
then there are things out in space that
could be very harmful to us that could
hit us and it isn&#39;t to say that they
couldn&#39;t then re-emerge but at their own
great peril so we are putting the planet
at risk for things that it has
traditionally been protected from that
we have very little knowledge of because
we have weaponized these satellite
systems in space and also ground-based
systems that can reach so what that
means is these technologies in the wrong
hands are you know it&#39;s like forgive
them they know not what they do they
don&#39;t even understand some of these
folks how reckless and foolish the
Tuohy&#39;s is sort of a Strangelove Ian
Loveall dr. Strangelove my reference
their strange Strangelove in level of a
madness like the mad scientist and mad
people who are in their own little
covert bubble but there are consequences
to doing this and this is why I wanted
to wrap up with a few simple point
the solutions are the disclosure and
ethical oversight of these use app
technologies now that&#39;s a big one it&#39;s
what we were just talking about we have
to reach a point where these systems and
the technologies have an ethical and
conscious and enlightened oversight
without that it is very dangerous and
that is why the disclosure project I why
I founded it back in the 90s higher
states of consciousness by understanding
and entering into these states of
consciousness not only can you know what
they&#39;re doing but you can protect
yourself and the planet because people
who get come together in prayerful and
meditative states have a morphogenetic
field effect that&#39;s enormous ly
protective beyond what you can imagine
even in the physical domain this is why
they&#39;ve done studies with intercession
Airi prayer studies where they found you
know people praying and within with a
pure heart for someone who&#39;s thousand
miles away it has a very amazing effect
and so if people act together in a
conscious and enlightened way it it
really can put us off the course of
destruction onto a path of enlightenment
and universal peace and this is why the
next big of program we&#39;re gonna roll out
is a global mass awareness of Close
Encounters of the fifth kind if you
understand I think one time I was called
the Maharishi effect because they&#39;d send
meditators into a city and they&#39;d
meditate and the crime rates would go
down it only took one percent so if you
you know if Denver has two million
people then you would need 20,000 people
to go there but what they found is that
and this is also true in physics is that
if you if you look at in quantum physics
superfluidity and helium it only takes
about 1% of the molecules becoming
coherent in that substrate in the helium
as it approaches absolute zero and when
one percent is reached the entire
container takes on these magical prop
that our we&#39;re all of them at once go
bang superfluid and coherent they all
align so don&#39;t think that you have to
get 99% of the public or forty fifty
point one this is not a election you
need one percent who understand where we
are what the risks are what the
solutions are in consciousness and
meditation peaceful contact and even
these technological solutions moving
together now on earth that would be
about seventy five million people we
hope with this next documentary and
educational program we can reach about a
hundred million people to enter into
meditative states together and contact
states together to show these
civilizations another face to humanity
an enlightened peaceful face that can
then put us on the path of where we&#39;re
supposed to have been a hundred years
ago and that is universal peace the
ending of poverty the stabilization of
the environment with these wondrous new
sciences and technologies that would
heal the earth and go forward as an
interstellar people peacefully that&#39;s
where we&#39;re headed and it is gonna take
a certain quantum number but it isn&#39;t
ninety nine percent it&#39;s like one
percent so that&#39;s what our next project
is and I hope you will all help us with
that endeavor thank you very much
you
