I was so scared of injections and doctor tools. I have experienced NDE several times. I did not know it was an NDE until I saw a video of Anita and then went to your website.

Once I was taken to the hospital for a high fever and the nurse gave me an injection. The next second, what I sensed was that I was passing through a black, hollow tube at tremendous speed. I did not feel my body. I was scared. It was so thick and dark. Somehow, I regained consciousness and saw my mother and doctor by my bed.

That was a bitter experience and even now at age 32, I am scared if it will happen again.

One time, I fell on the sand, causing my knee to bleed. I kept a Band-Aid on and rushed to my college bus to reach home fast. When I reached home after 6 hours, I tried to remove the Band-Aid. I felt severe pain and fainted. I went to the same hollow path as before.  When I opened my eyes, my mother told me that my body was shivering as if I had epilepsy. I experienced this many times until I was 20 years of age.
